We have not had a patch since i think 18th dec or something last year. They said it was on the tables and most likely will be in a patch this month or next when ever the next patches are.

I think fusion cells would be a better choice for a power supply. A fusion core just for a flashlight would be kinda crazy
---
Introducing the real money auction house. If anyone’s gonna make money off our mistakes, it’s us!

Lemme getthose fluorescent flux. Will trade or sum for them

---
&gt;If they were fun to fight, that would be a great reward in itself.
---

---
Exactly. If you think the only definition of "rewarding" is "super farming mechanic," broaden yo' horizons.
---
Do you have a map to reference?
---
Vendor bot chad got some sass on him.
---
I had this discussion with some randos, and we were at a consensus that fast travel is "cheesy" but limiting fast travel points to/from train stations, even free would still be less absurd than "poof'ing" anywhere anytime in a multiplayer game.
---
Just a thought.
---
sorry if I came off as hostile, hard to convey tone in a text chat ;)  
---
When I say I disagree with your assumptions, it's just that.  You baked in assumptions in your op and throughout this convo.    
---
Nothing wrong with any of this, slipping assumptions into a debate is  a common argument technique and I don't fault you or anyone for using it. 
---
Yes I know. Op wanted heating coils in witch case it's possible to have a super sledge with the same stats as all rise
---
Hmmmm i may try a cliffside estate next time i move camp! Just a pain to make something nice a big, only to be limited on decorations/lighting.. 
---
SOLD!
---
Yeah, I do understand what you mean. I think that's why there shouldn't be any additional rewards outside of junk from it, because it would just encourage far too much of it. It's a very difficult thing to balance and otherwise incentivize gameplay that isn't always kill on sight with any PvP game. A part of me simply hopes that the community would turn it into something more dynamic than the typical survival sandbox game, but that's probably not very realistic.
---
and yet, every single day I wish I could kill her.
---
A man of culture I see 
---
 you are really lucky,  if you can please sell me handmade rifle plan schematic
---
 I'll be happy to pay you three times its value just that I do not have to hope any more 
---
Congrats!  You always get that great sense of accomplishment for your first.  
---
After a dozen, you’ll just get annoyed.  
---
My dream now is to face off with a dusky Yao  guai and live.  
---
I’m thinking lvl 200 or so.
---
Silly wabbit, everyone knows "badly designed" means "I don't like it" and "well-designed" means "I play it all the time!"
---
Not yet! I need to get an album set up. It started with a dead frog I found in a cool pose. I moved on to live stuff after that.
---
When you say completely unnecessary, you mean like your comment right? Or like bringing up the engines age for the 50th time?
---
This is absolutely brilliant, I wish we could hear the voice chat
---
Good idea, we'll let them know.
---
What platform
---
PvP clearly doesn't appeal to you.
---
&gt;I have no interest in PVP, therefore I will avoid PVP servers as much as possible.
---
So you want the game to remove PvP for you.
---
There are notes in the bunker that tell you where you will likely find them. Includes what plants turn into what flux.
---
They are just the dragons in Skyrim if all they did was spit fire and only gave you two gold when killing them
---
I put the assy in Classy
---
I've had prime and ultracite drop from lvl 60+ regular scorchbeasts
---
Cool! Where exactly?
---
For me I love the Frank Horrigan feeling with the .50 and the X0-1. But I also the look of the Light Machine Gun with Ultracite power armor, makes me feel like a Kerberos Panzer Cop.
---
Did we just become best friends?
---
Because many of us don't like to play games that are easy and require no strategy? I'll get the latest F2P phone game garbage when I want that, not shell out $60 for a major studio release.
---
Triple-A is a dead concept.
---
Tancels... *sees username* your *wife’s* username huh?
---
Would be cool if mutations modified you physically 
---
Then I must apologize for calling you a bullshitter hahah you seem like a passionate guy who wants what’s best for the game, and I suppose I am too, so that’s one thing we agree on! 
---
Noticed a possible issue with the tesla may be working as intended but when you think tse tesla you would think explosive chain lightning unfortunately the effect of explosive on a telsa gimps the gun into a single explosive shot and loses the ability to chain onto multiple enemys even if it only had the explosive effect on the first enemy and still had the ability to chain the gun would be so much better then as is right now.
---
Yeah. I’m just thinking that we wouldn’t want to ‘reload’ the light often. A core would maybe last longer
---
You can also use third person to extend your reach. The further back you zoom the camera, the longer your reach. 
---
Most likely cannot mention certain things. Especially around things that will have to be brought up once a fix has been found.
---
And up weapons max lvl
---
On Xbox. 
---
Pssh. How bout a fertilizer fueled thrower or cannon 
---
Screw stairs!  Where's my elevator?  XD
---
This is how the Fallout addiction began for me as well. Even with how glitchy 76 is, I still have such a soft spot for the game
---
Also if you happen to be in the area of west tek research center there's a good chance you can get up to 30-50 plastic easy. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
1st you're going to need the perk card scrapper then next thing you going to is kill any super mutant that is holding a laser sniper rilfe - which breaks down to 6 plastic and some other stuff.
---
People have been bitching about this game since before it launched. On a multitude of platforms in a multitude of ways. I think Bethesda gets the point by now?
---
Two thing that is needed is a Cap on how much weight your character can hold as dupers have their carry weight in the millions and have a cap of about of 5000Ib that one character can hold at a time and wipe people inventories that have a massive amounts. The fact people are selling dupes on eBay is just a joke.
---
No. I want the option to either have PVP or not have PVP. Why is that such a hard concept to understand.
---
Nah. When it dropped down by 40-60% IN A WEEK, that was bad. Yes, I know, Black Friday, blah blah. I just hope you guys at Bethesda realize I'll never buy any of your games again at full price anywhere close to any kind of a holiday that might result in a sale. 
---
But a price dropping by half within 2 months is really, really, really, *really* common, and happens even to the best of games. Assassin's Creed Odyssey, for example, came out in early October, and by December it was half-off. I remember Hitman (the reboot) being dirt cheap within a month or so of release. Lesser games drop in price just as fast. 
---
In short, this is normal. It's why /r/patientgamers exists.
---
This is my hope!!!! I think it’ll fix some core issues we are seeing today, naturally, assuming they fix the duplication issues 
---
Nice!  Enjoy exploring the wasteland :)
---
In the shop area thats by the codeword generator.  Theres notes scattered around that room.
---
I hate the 'sorry, this collides with something invisible or minor, like that piece of metal that you should be able to move? Yeah, you can't so you can't put a structure there haha you suck!"
---
Not as dull and unrewarding as wasting away hours of your life grinding for something you may not get for months.
---
What about those damn garbage cans, those little ducks are the worst cause a blade of grass hides them
---
I actually came here [to leave this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e3/1c/7a/e31c7a10f8691a8f0d57bd3c4ffc88c9.jpg), lol.
---
*yarrrrrrrrrrr*
---
Fun
---
Sick. Thanks!
---
Yep!
---
Exactly, it doesn’t need to strangle people it just needs to address the people who crash an entire server trying to load there 10,000 handmades into the game 
---
You know, the game is playable without having what many consider the best gun you can make in game. 
---
You've gotten this far without it. 
---
Yeah, if I can cobble a a Gauss rifle together from coat hangers and telephones I should be able to make a fridge.
---
Containers and corpses are simultaneously personal and shared. They'll spawn in loot for you, that only you can see, but if you (or another player) drops something into it, then anyone can access that loot.
---
Additionally, quest items for your teammates will show up for the whole team, but only the owner can pick it up.
---
Wanna do karate at my camp
---
Hmm, is there a hard cap on SPECIAL stats? Haven't bothered to look.
---
Next build: all points into STR. Multi-wielding broadsiders!
---
30 is not a trivial amount for me but I respect your view
---
I'm currently listening to a podcast about serial killers, and this comment is triggering alarms. 😜
---
Good times
---
I think it's near new gad, but my favorite is a canoe filled with bears all holding oars. 
---
Same. I have all kinds of stuff to trade or caps. PC here. 
---
I’m level 187 and they use up a good amount of my annoying for my TSE
---
Great common man nice work
---
Screw what I said... I actually like this idea more. The fast traveling does kind of ruin the feel of the game since I’m no longer exploring but just teleporting between locations. Maybe players should be allowed to pick ten locations on the map that they can fast travel to and they would have to pay 100 caps to change any one of them. 
---
It’s edgy
---
Pretty entitled don't you think? To have all the required information available to tell you that PvP in Fallout 76 is always-on. Then to buy it and start demanding for a PvP-off mode?
---
Lol, Richapalooza82 on Xbox...  Feel free to send a request
---
Well if Stromboli is a pepperoni roll with bacon, surely I should have one of those instead as it would be better? I mean bacon makes everything better. Even vegans had to try and make fake bacon because they know it’s just so damn good
---
*shivers*
---
I got a lot of room for activities 
---
I dislike that I think of many of the games enemies this way. I enjoying scavving and exploring in low level areas more than high level because it only takes a few shots from any old gun to remove threats.
---
There should be a weapon, or perk, or dragon shout to force them to land and then bitch slap them to death. 
---
I only need 5-8 seconds to defeat them once in the ground (I use super fast&amp;stronk deathclaw gauntlet strikes).
---
That sorta looks like destiny 2 
---
Dang! That’s a better idea! 
---
Well... yeah. It's literally all some people do: work on ways of cheating the code and finding exploits. Look at GTAO. There are websites you can go to where people work out dupe glitches and workarounds to patches on the dupe glitches, despite GTAO patching some dupe glitches *within hours*. They spend more time working on glitches and exploits than playing than actual game. That's some people's enjoyment unfortunately (I say that because I'd like everything and everyone in-game to be legit).
---
I was referring to pacifist mode.  It should simply turn off pvp instead of inviting griefing by glass cannons who are very ironically immune from retaliation.
---
whats your problem? I use 50cal, its exchange rate is similar or better to minigun ammo. I walk into a battle with 5k at minimum. get ammosmith, superduper, excavator power armor, kill some muties and scrap their weapons and find a place for lead. (ive got a place for infinite lead that's not an exploit, but its a trade secret~ :wink: ) 
---
Mine crashes within 15 mins each time
---
Unless you're planning on 20 hour play sessions you'll be fine. But if you're really that worried you shouldn't risk it. As a matter of fact pack it up and put it in the closet, just to be safe.
---
And by the way, I know what was done in Fallout 4, but thanks for the history lesson.
---
Boo, it's the same. 
---
Input lag isnt terrible in this game actually, it's more of the servers becoming unstable, weather it be cause of duping or not, idk, probably. 
---
Oh! That really stinks. I am sorry, I have seen so many people complain but the were killing unstarred Legendary.
---
Near the monorail elevator. I found it while hunting down a treasure.

Folks replying here are more like community managers, a part time role for support staff.  They facilitate communication and aggregate feedback.  They don’t decide what is in the game or changes or roadmap.
---
Devs similarly, often design technical systems but aren’t usually deciding what features or content are in the game or balancing things. That’s the role of game designers, producers, and other flavors of user experience designer.
---
Unfortunately, community managers also can’t say things like “yeah we all know that feature is needed but it’s impossible to build in this ancient engine” or “that would take staff we don’t have assigned to 76 so forget it”.
---
Hence, “thanks for the great suggestion, I’ll pass it along to the dev team.”  It’s a bit like saying “our thoughts and prayers are with this feature”
---
They're gonna own everything from A to Z one day.
---
Do you think people got the Xbox One changed by being silent? Do you think people got rid of online passes by being silent? Do you think we got Bethesda to send out the collectors item that they advertised by being silent? No, it was by doing this. It was by constantly talking about it and never relenting, so get the fuck out with your nonsense.
---
I think becoming a non-feral ghoul would be great... but a super mutant? You’d literally have to go around yelling “YOU HIT LIKE A RADROACH!” at random players. Super mutants don’t even have half a brain, and are slow as hell. 
---
Glad to hear it. If you find yourself needing anything let me know, same ign. No charge. I usually put together a survival kit for newer players if they want. Stimpaks, purified water, radaway, food, and some ammo if you want.
---
Well if you look like the mutation would that mean you’d be immune to that type? I mean would you be able to get a Ghoul mutation which had the same effect as a ghoul mask.
---
Most likely because it would require them to work on another skeleton rig for armor sets for them. Then they would also have the issue of it cutting into the atom store.
---
I could see ghouls been a thing though same model and armor could be with them.
---
My spot is mostly camouflaged by trees, it has a pretty nice water source, the ground is nice and flat for building and agriculture, mobs spawn nearby but don’t attack, and a town is nearby so I can farm junk, scavenge ammo and scrap weapons from enemies. 
---
It’s so peaceful living out in the woods, but I think I’m going insane from the lack of human interaction. There can’t be giant moths, right? ...r-right?
---
That being said, i dont feel jipped for the 60 dollar purchase. The game ends up being fairly cheap by the hour. 
---
I only buy 2 to 5 games a year , im never in buyers remorse about 200 bucks a year. Its a cheap hobby after all. 
---
The entire tech industry has its problems. I dont know a big tech company i would consider myself loyal to. Except maybe nintendo. As for the small guys, the studios behind: the witcher, divinity original sin &amp; Civilization are pretty great.  
---
When holding companies, shareholders, quarterly earnings get involved, shit gets messy. Fallout 76, loot boxes, Diablo for mobile. Happens in every industry really. My company was purchased by a public company in 2017. There are new layers of stupid. Decisions get pushed down from 40,000 ft. Its tough.
---
 It appears insanely greedy in a company with employee to profit ratios we see in the tech industry. 
---
this is common. if you hold him too long he'll explode. i think it's to prevent people farming him. 
---
Responder Bots (Grafton, Welch, Lewisburg), and you have to be lvl 25+. 
---
Source?
---
Maybe I'm thinking of something else? I snap full-sized walls to those, on two diff characters. Different walls, too: one had Metal, the new guy used lowly Wood. Full-sized walls.
---
You're talking about the framework with a stair piece up to a catwalk, that snaps to a non-stair piece just like it?
---
Hmm. Now that I'm typing this, I've never bothered putting them on foundations: I just sink them a few inches into the ground. I've seen deeply weird interactions so maybe the foundation is causing this issue.
---
Exactly.  I used just about the same example (I said plasma rifle from a lunchbox, beer bottle and a scrapped circuit board) to a buddy.  
---
But no way to preserve food?
---
Farm low level scorch and use scrapper breaking down their weapons. Tin cans is another good one. 
---
Thanks!
---
Doesn't sound familiar!
---
Why can’t you craft it? 
---
Only found at Watoga vendors &amp; Grahm. Base price is 11500 caps I believe. Comes with every neon letter &amp; symbol plan along with the “open” sign. Definitely a must need if you like working on your camp. 
---
I don't understand what all the complaining is about! I personally enjoy the idea of having a apex monster to fear in the wasteland. It always bothers me in games when the player is the baddest thing in the game. 
---
Scorchbeasts keep me on my toes.
---
I appreciate you. 
---
You don’t understand how burn in works then lol burn in is a cumulative effect, not something that happens in one sitting. Even if I play the game one hour a day for the next year eventually the health bar, compass and AP bars will start to burn in because they’re in the same place every time
---
[removed]
---
All of them haha. 
---
It could just be internet problems, since it's a cryptic error and [their help page](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/43844/~/what-do-i-do-if-i-get-error-during-bethesda.net-login-when-trying-to-launch) only suggests that it couldn't reach the server.
---
Because they may have lost the war, but they won the catwalk. Stylish.
---
Currently sitting on 8000 rounds. which sounds reasonable until you remember i fired off 2k rounds on a tri-barrel in like, 2 hours of normal play, no nuke zones/silos etc, and this is explosive, though, not two shot. Fun, though. Also shiny AF. 
---
I liked her during the questline - but cant listen to her station
---
Well, that hasn't been a problem for me, I hope it doesn't become one in the future neither! 
---
Stop talking like your a political activist. It's a videogame.
---
If people like you were this enthusiastic about ACTUAL REAL problems, maybe the world wouldnt be in the shit state its in now 🤷‍♂️and that's all I have to say on the matter. 
---
I feel like if they did, they would kinda be killing the design logic behind why there are no human NPCs in 76 (i.e. so players don't confuse other players with friendly NPCs).
---
There is a small chance to get a Prime plan off them, but you're better off just going for the queen, which can now drop decent loot if you don't crash.  Still, total crap encounter.
---
Your right of course, they should be straight shooting, unlike VAT'S.   I'd rather they just told it like it is "we knew that when we sold you it".
---
Although as there are lots of really good ideas on the forums, maybe they're to busy discussing them with the Devs to incorporate any of them.  Just a thought..........
---
I usually do a run threw Whitesprings Then head over to Watoga for the Monster Mash event. Get a ton of XP that way.
---
AP failing to update occurs when you lose connection to the server, even if its momentary. You can look at it as a feature instead of a bug. Here's how.
---
AP is actually a great indicator of synchronicity. If you're looking to loot corpses and only get the loading wheel, you can just watch your AP meter to let you know when you're synced enough to loot again. When the meter moves, you're good to go.
---
Same with loading screens.  If you've ever entered a location, started walking, and had it rubberband you back to the starting point, that's an example of syncing problems. Your local game knows you are loaded but you can't really go beyond where the server thinks you are. If you see flickering textures that tell you your load-in isn't synchronized yet, wait for the AP meter to move so you don't have to be annoyed by rubberbanding.
---
I can't say about bags dropped when dying, because I have never had any of those disappear on me. I have lost a **lot** of bags when dropping stuff, and I don't think this invisible bag issue is common. There been many times where I knew exactly where it was supposed to drop and it wasn't there in any way. 
---
Also, if you drop a bag right near you dropped a previous (non buggy) bag, they will combine. I have had many times where I had a bag disappear and then dropped another bag right on top of that spot, and not had them combine. The old bag was just gone. 
---
(And before people ask why I keep dropping bags when they disappear on me, I always do the "drop something useless, then access the bag to add what you really want" trick, so I have a lot of bags disappear, but not much of value.)
---
Also use the perk to bring it down to 9600 caps.
---
Wow, thank you so much! If I feel like I'm stuck in a quest I'd love to get some advices from a higher level player, could you help me in that case please? 
---
They have mason jars and empty moonshine jugs all over. They missed a huge opportunity. Let me can my stuff or produce liquor. I mean that is an age old system. Make it require a perk and plans. Maybe add an actual still.
---
Sadly, yes the others are not mentioned but aside from a full “Reimagine”  (Wipe) those are not rectifiable without some form of outright negating the mutations and mods for everyone.
---
They have the full alphabet, numbers 0-9, period, exclamation mark, question mark, quotation marks, apostrophe, and it might have #.
---
I found it in the wild near the ski lodge by the top of the world.
---
Grafton Station vendor and Welch station vendor stock them after 25 I believe. But think they may have a similar bug to the handmade and only spawn in shop consistently early on, virtually level locking you out at higher level
---
Somehow server stability has gotten worse?
---
Actually they can't be killed by other players or by you, only NPC monsters, and they will just respawn the next time you relog. Now that makes them a very valuable asset to your camp but at the same time a liability as once you have a pet there is no way to get rid of it. So make sure your camp is almost fully built with everything you want and a tiny little but of budget left before taming a pet. You can however replace it by taming another creature.
---
Same! I had 3 of my buddies looking for the hidden gnome! None of them found it.
---
is it server hopping next to a gym ? I tend to hit all three silos and just raid the gyms in the first part, then leave. lead for weeks. 
---
76 is soo weird when it comes to visuals, as a whole it is stunning at times, but each individual part is rough and kind of ugly.
---
I don't mind them being difficult enemies and their sonic attack though annoying isn't a big deal to me... the lack of decent loot from them is the major glaring issue. Anything this tough that requires this amount of resources (ammo, repairs, stimpacks, etc.) should be well worth the effort. These things are definitely not worth the effort.
---
Premium pricetag? It was cheaper than a full-price game. I don't have low standards, I'm just realistic. I played games since PS1 and I know what games are, I'm even making games myself and going to uni to expand my knowledge. 
---
I bought it in Harper's ferry @ level 60.
---
Perk helps. If you’re low on caps I think you should wait it out for someone to sell or trade for cheap in the market. A lot of users buy them thinking theyre rare &amp; they can profit but they’re pretty common. 
---
Just to clarify, the infinite sonic blast *is* a bug. They've confirmed this.
---
No problem, what's the point of even playing an mmo if we won't try to keep players playing? If you have a mic i can help you that way much quicker.
---
You can stack those metal grate-floor staircases and make actual stairwells, but it takes some work if you then want to add walls to your stairwell.
---
Anyone remember the guy who posted the video? He uses stair supports: snap three little ones, or the one big one then a short one, on top of the metal stair platform.
---
Delete the lower large (or lower two smalls).
---
Another stair platform piece will then snap in place - UNDER the remaining floating support.
---
You can then delete that support, or continue to use it to keep stacking.
---
ONE WARNING:
---
If you want to put walls along any of its sides, the game gets super super super fiddly. He doesn't try it in his video, I discovered this making a tower: you have to place all the walls you want BEFORE creating your next upper level. If you just create a giant stack o' stairs, you will never get walls around it. PITA.
---
However, doing it the fiddly roundabout way does work. Currently have a 5-floor tower.
---
Now we need the gilt paintjob to put on our legendaries instead of that one spawn / SQB drops. Still, that chrome paint is gorgeous.  
---

---
Look. All I'm saying is that there is a better way to deal with this, to appeal to more people who don't want PVP. They'd make more money and have more support and better reviews if they had more options. Maybe pick your own servers like battlefield has
---
Mason jars are far more complicated than a fusion generator.
---
I actually like the atmosphere it creates. 
---
Lonesome and isolating. 
---
It makes random Dom player interactions stand out that much more.
---
Ps4
---
I was debating moving mine too. It sucks when you have a sweet spot.
---
I totally agree with you. I have been priced smacked too many times by developers and am getting tired of it. It should be a $10 drop in price per year not week!
---
Got mine at Welch... just had to server hop 2 or 3 times. I think I was over 45 and below 50.
---
I’m on XB1 and trying to get my wife into it. I’ll look you guys up on there, I’m JunkMustard.

Armory is what the room is called

Just like a status bar and navigation keys on a phone. I've had an oled phone for 9 months and have zero signs of burn in. But if you want to be paranoid have fun with that.

---
And from personal experience, I've found:  
---
Whitesprings:
---
Yellowcake (Soot Flower, Blackberry)
---
Fluorescent (Rhododendrons, which turn into Raydodendrons)
---
Cobalt (Glowing Resin, Firecracker Berries)
---
Fissure Prime (Cranberry Bog):
---
Yellowcake 
---
Crimson (Diseased and regular Cranberries, turn into Blast Berries)
---
Violet (Pitcher Plants and Mutated Ferns around the outside of the Sundew Groves)
---
Fluorescent (Glowing Fungus, usually in the bottom of the trenches you'll inevitably fall into)  
---
Hope this helps!
---
It’s like they didn’t even play test then...
---
Hell, i can just jetpack up on a rock and do this now.
---
Same, I got over 20 level points I havnt even used, Got all the perk cards I want set up the way I want.
---
Thanks! In case I find myself in trouble I'll let you know. And yes, I do have a mic :) 
---
Yeah someone did the analysis a while back
---
Well I've had the Rose quests done for a while and I thought you were able to craft them afterwards but I the karma barrel doesn't show up in the menu
---
Exit the game completely, and try again. If that doesn't work, just play for a while. I had quests disappear, but pop back in after 20 mins or so of playing the game. It might also help to do an event of some kind, which will update your quest tracker, that sometimes gets things unstuck.
---
It still has bugs from fallout 4 carried over. No, I haven't seen any improvement, and gameplay is still frustrating

TL;DR Tamed Deathclaws remain red and attack anyone besides owner, cannot tame scorched/glowing/etc versions of normally tamable animals, Mega Sloth has pathfinding issues when traveling to base and never makes it or dies on arrival.
---
Tamed Deathclaws (and possibly other tamed animals) will still appear red to their owners, and tend to attack other players and teammates. They won't actually damage teammates, and I'm not sure about them damaging random people. If you pacify a Deathclaw instead of taming it, they do become non-aggressive like they should. Mirelurk Kings and Hunters will appear white to their owners and teammates, and will not attack your own team.
---
Honestly not quite sure if this is a bug or feature, seeing as it is a Deathclaw.....
---
Also, not sure if this is a bug or just part of the mechanics of it, but the only version of Deathclaws I seem to be able to tame are the base versions without any glowing/albino/etc modifier on it. I was able to tame a non-base version of the Mega Sloth, a Sluggish version, however he had a lot of issues traveling to my base and never made it. He spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to get over a small crack in the road.
---
Agreed. 
---
1 minute tops for intial load. 15 seconds tops for location changes and fast travel. 
---
It's the PC Master race. Their machine can't be the problem. It never could be.
---
Ah ok
---
Got mine from Welch also. Doesn't seem to be an upper level limit. I've seen it for sale at 100+
---
&gt;It was cheaper than a full-price game.
---
It was AAA-priced.
---
&gt;I don't have low standards, I'm just realistic.
---
That must make other games looks like they have been made by some sort of god then because they sure as hell aren't as bug-ridden as Fallout 76.
---
&gt;I played games since PS1 and I know what games are
---
Oh, well ok then. Remember back when developers had to release robust games because they couldn't just patch the physical copies that people bought and played offline? I guess we've managed to regress but still keep to your standards?
---
&gt;I'm even making games myself and going to uni to expand my knowledge.
---
Well perhaps once you graduate and work in the industry you'll have a better understanding of what a QA process is and why it's important. Or if you take the business modules you can learn how to squeeze every possible drop out of a consumer base that is hopelessly naive.
---
Agreed, they should be mutually exclusive effects
---
I feel like I'm one of the few that, most of the time, enjoy fighting scorchbeasts. Not that they're not poorly designed (they are, you need to be able to take cover from their gas and sonic blast--btw gas masks would REALLY be great if they could prevent the gas damage), but I enjoy challenging my build against them to see how much I can tank and how quickly I can kill them. I run a mostly tank build and seeing their blasts barely tickle me is weirdly satisfying.
---
They need to be more exciting, and have variety. They're already considered Skyrim dragons, just make them Skyrim dragons--make one shoot ballistic damage, another energy, and maybe rarely a radiation one. Have it so you can get cover from their gas and sonic attacks, or add shields or something so you can defend against them. Make them land more often as well.
---
I was level 24 so me and my level 6 friend went out to fight a scorch beast and ended up low on all ammo and got pretty much nothing out of it I was a little disappointed 
---
Okay, I will when I get on my PC tomorrow :) 
---
Scorchbeasts can be easy AND rewarding. 
---
I like to game them in cranberry bog. Repair a couple of the red middle turrets and just pop a couple bullets in them and profit. 
---
I got a prime receiver for a western revolver from a level 50 or 80 (I was fighting 2 at once). I have a nocturnal exploding western revolver so I can’t wait to upgrade it when I get my next level of gunsmith. 
---
I thought so
---
Whitespring almost has it all. The aster turn dark red and so does the brain fungus down that alley of sweeping gusty pods and dumpsters. The berry bushes are florescent. Carrot flowers and raydodrendrons are yellowcake. The blue isn't as plentiful as those others but it's there. Go back by the enclave entrance and the silt beans are now blue. Also check trees in the distance for now blue sap. Could look for the small golf club office building with an umbrella table on the roof near the north guard post. Right outside is a tree with three helpings of the blue and there are 4 silt beans close by. 
---
The glowing ghouls are perfect for helping low levels get loot to sell and xp fast. It's a goddamn blast being outside that golf clubhouse during the nuke. 
---
For violet you want the bog queen fights. The pitcher plants give violet instead of goo when irradiated. Mutated ferns turn violet too and are easy to find under the trees. 
---
Near a junk extraction on the water front as I am a water farmer.

The Lord has provided you with the sun kissed perk to stem your need for such a modern convenience as radaway.
---
The government has been shut down for two weeks dude and you're whining about a videogame 
---
Definitely. Wear is based directly on the number of shots that are fired in combat, and maybe on the number that actually hit. Since the gat fires slower, it lasts longer. That being said, it hits like a mule and is deadly accurate if you aren't moving around very fast. It's the go to weapon for heavy weapon specs for a reason. :) 
---
I still believe that their spam attack is not intended and that the animation just needs a tone down. Not sure they tested it well with multiple of them attacking at once as well.
---
Me too ive had this same error code for like 3 weeks and ive tried everything including what was suggested above, someone please help
---
Probably been reported already, but when one member of a team takes a Workshop, only that person is able to fast travel to the workshop, delete anything from the workshop, and use special items like the vertibot grenades. I feel that this is a bug and that everyone in the team should have full rights to a workshop, but if this is working as intended, then I'm definitely requesting this as a feature request.
---
That's a great spot. Not the prettiest, and kinda out of the way, but I'm pretty sure it's the only location on the map where you can get both extractor types in one camp.
---
Players are never prevented from unequiping perks.  That would presumably be a big design and coding change.
---
Sounds good, i'll keep an eye out :) keep enjoying the game.
---
Hand craft a bed from wood.
---
People just want to game the system 
---
TBH I'd take being able to play with all of my friends regardless of what system they're playing on over making a garbage PvP system slightly more garbage. 
---
Grafton for me, lv 25, took me 5 server hops. The handmade plans at harpers ferry,  had to be lvl 15, took me 3 server hops.
---
Maybe just a misc crafting item, lasts forever. 1 core, 1 copper, 1 glass and like 2 plastic or steel.
---
The Grafton area is the northern part of the map iirc.   I have been hitting that area pretty good.  I'm still getting rolled by some of the mobs in that area.  I had a few rad scorps that were about 10 levels higher then I was obliterate me.  Haha. I'll keep plugging away.
---
Really, I don't care about the rest of your post, but the fact that you "went and looked" at apparently the ENTIRE internet to say that "Even No Man's Sky didn't get *this* much obnoxious noise" accurately is very impressive. Kudos for your internet omniscience.
---
Found the small letters plan in Defiance... Is that part of it? 
---
I need to figure out how to more easily share pics ... I've got a camp up inside a monorail pylon
---
Love how this finally turns into some tale of generosity on your part when it started off as you wanting to collect things and how you need certain items. 
---
I see, thanks!
---
I have a Zealot's Gatling gun that makes short work of up to 3 Scorchbeasts at once. That said, I hate to fight them, since I don't want to use my Gatling Gun constantly when I have Scorchbeasts attacking overhead just because I want to be able to see where I'm actually aiming my weapons.
---
Seriously, I don't mind killing a Scorchbeast every now and then. But with the frequency I encounter them, it's like I have no other weapons but the Gatling Gun, even though the 50 Cal LMG is by far my favourite weapon, especially my legendary one, with 20% more damage on enemies with &gt;40% HP, and 20% more fire rate.
---
They need to add hitboxs to the wings
---
Yeah like how I think orange(just guessing here) highlights living things. Something that highlights dead would be a bit useful. A chem I'd actually use.
---
What's amazing is stumbling into 3 or more. And just being blinded and trying to run away. Can't even fight back because blinded.
---
I can fight them one at a time....most of the time, unless  they bug and spam attack you. It's just a huge waste of time for little to no reward.

---
I’ve done the quest and didn’t get any plans/mods for it either. :(
---
The motion-assist servos will still give you 2 more str, fyi
---
It’s different. Not as cool. It’s the same letterings &amp; actually comes with fully spelt words like “ammo” “armor” &amp; so on. They’re super small while the more expensive plan are pretty big. 
---
There is also a random event spawn at the lake next to thunder mountain. If you see the picture of the fish on the map, just follow it south to the shoreline and that is where it is at.
---
Interestingly these random even spawns are also the best places to get tamable animals which is why I have seen this location enough times to know it is a event spawn point.
---
From here I have seen:
---
* Vmad and Mia robots (my favorite) 
---
* Random mankins standing around
---
* Robot that wants you to help research by using recon scope (have seen in other areas too)
---
* The prize bot
---
* A group if like 10 Brahim corpses (have this this in other places to)
---
* a group of radstag
---
* Super mutants fighting liberators (also have seen this spawned at near Abbys bunker)
---
* Random self spawning creatures that can be tamed like the bear, rad toad and mega sloth.
---
* one time it spawned 3 scotchbeast pretty much sitting on top of each other
---
Also if you go just to the south, literally just up the hill nearby there is another one that spawns random events like:
---
*a broken down tank and robots (mr gusts etc)
---
* an albino deathclaw and a dead travelling vendor brahmin (have also seen this near abbys bunker)
---
* something that looks like a supply drop  with the flare and protectrons around it (it's not proper air drop because it doesn't show on your missions)
---
* a tent with some scorched or ghouls around it
---
Starting with [addictol](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9y9dhk/addicted_to_adictol_wtf/) so that it doesn't cure the rest.
---
Sfl thank u
---
Col. Gutsys are pretty broken too 
---
If you drop grenades and damage the base you end up wanted.
---
If you're still having an issue trading you might have to do a fresh install see if that cleans it up. Just set it to install after you logout for the day so you don't lose any playtime. 
---
Yeah I’ve been trying to collect bloatfly glands to make the syringer barrel and  storing them in the box so I didn’t accidentally scrap them just to have them get scrapped when smelting or whatever.
---
Wow I didn't think it was possible but someone I might be late on the topic but someone alone kills a SBQ in under 10 sec.

Taking 1000 Explosive Bobble Heads and KILLING THE SCORCHED BEAST QUEEN!|| World record? Fallout 76

what you guys think?
---
I met his glowing cousin last night.
---
My condolences...
---
If you do buy them just be ready, they each require 1 power. If you don’t have the fusion generator yet then try to get that first by completing the event “powering up Poseidon”
---
Mutations on the Effects screen will occasionally stop showing their positive effects, even though you still experience the positive effects of them. And no, at the time my mutations were not suppressed by a radaway or rad-x or anything.
---
Nice! Do you have stairs all the way down?
---
I'm on ps4 if you still need it. 
---
That would teleport random stuff to the player.  In addition to the coding challenge, it will only make the immersion issue more challenging.  (Magically accessible stashes are already a major departure from the internal consistency of the game world.  As is teleportation/fast travel for caps, for that matter.)
---
Not too hard to take down. I agree with you.
---
You don't need flux, or any materials to apply a prebuilt mod to a weapon/armor. You only need the materials for mods that you build yourself. 
---
I thought that was scripted? Not the dying, but the poison cloud. I recently went through it with a friend and we fought through the poison.
---
We call them Cancer Bats
---
And what if the fusion core fill level effects the durability 
---
Thanks. He was only there for about 2 minutes. His are other people on Reddit holding him for other people for longer?
---
2k?
---
I think the higher the level, the better chance it has of dropping a plan. Most of mine have come from killing the lvl 80's and maybe 1 or 2 from the 65s. I've never gotten a plan from the 50s.
---
I bought the power armor edition, so it does sting a bit. but then I look at how cool it looks on my shelf and see how many hours of poured into this game since I got it and i'm ok with the purchase even at full price. 
---
But bruh i just got my adhesive farm going!
---
HA. Dead ass....  
---
I remember my first time getting killed by a high level cliff racer, wondering how there was any counter play to that... haha
---
Thank you for the tip.  And thanks for the up!
---
its amazing how some junk can accumulate so fast you realize, "Holy crap, why do I have 30 lbs of cloth?!"
---
I'm sure I've tried that, but will give it another go.
---
Can start a new character and focus on a melee 2hander build.
---
You can 2-3 shot everything at low levels, but once you get the correct perk cards you'll start to 1-shot everything. 1-shot everything till end-game.
---
I can 3-shot level 50 scorchbeasts and 2 shot level 50 deathclaws.
---
When you hit level 50 you can start rolling on perk cards and decide whether you want to try a gun build later.
---
I got them as a random drop from an event last night. Most likely Uranium Fever or the Dropped Connection quest in Watoga, as those are the only ones I remember running yesterday.
---
if anyone is curious on how fast you can kill a SBQ SOLO with the bobbleheads
---

---
The video blew my mind on fast 
---
Naw.. It was in the "From The Vault" news letter that they are planning on implementing a fix in an update this month sometime.
---
I’ve thought about this a lot. Like honestly, who in their right mind and in good faith would release a game the way they did? There is absolutely no way in hell that they knew this game was finish. They didn’t beta test it. We’ve been beta testing it for them since release. How in the world could that man get up on that stage and feed us all the lies he did, and then still have the audacity to sell the game in its state with a straight face? Yeah sure, go out to every event to promote your game, but after the release turn into a ghost. “It just works.” What about it works? Countless glitches, horrible AI, bugged items, horrible servers. 
---
How many more patches are we going to have to wait for, for the game to be what it should’ve been at release. From the game, to the canvas bag, to the cola bottle. Everything has ended in failure. And there’s still people, like me, that have still stayed because there really is a good game somewhere in here. But to be lied to and not get compensation for it? Whatever man. You def lost a customer, and I hope it shows on their next release. 
---
That bed is oK
---
Just to make sure, you are aware that you can add food and water items to your favorites wheel to quickly eat without going into your Pip-Boy? Takes like 2 seconds to eat or drink then.
---
Love the idea about Perk Card loadouts, hopefully they add them.
---
wow i am actually impressed, like it can be a dick move to new players and all but overall i am impressed by the design and tricking capabilities of it, its a good use of firetraps too.
---
You need for the Calibrated Shocks or is that just your charge?
---
That's actually exactly what I mentioned when I saw a recipe that had about 5 or 6 ingredients.  I'd love to make a dish with scorchbeast parts, but I'd have to kill more than one to actually make it, and I'd also have to work against the clock to find all the parts before the raw bits spoil.
---
It's really inconvenient to make such a complex recipe like this most of the time, and the resulting product doesn't even have the courtesy of being immune to spoiling.
---
How many barrels are there ?
---
Don't pvp if you can't understand it, save your caps and nerves
---
Supermutants: you would have a very low cap on int, limited weapons choice, boost to strength, any you can shoot a pipe pistol 300 yards from your hip with freakish exact precision and devastating damage to knock out turrets before they even see you.
---
haha, i took a screenshot in [the exact same spot](https://i.imgur.com/93fvRpn.png)! the wendigo cave is alarmingly beautiful in places.
---
What does the officer under armour look  like 
---
You dont get stronger over lvl 50. Onlything that might be different, is that you could have found better weapons. But at the moment PVP dmg is quite high. Its quite easy to oneshot someone.  I'd say avoid pvp.
---
is there a different variation of it or is it just blue letters?
---
my max at once was 4, 1 already in the area and 3 spawning on me
---
I checked this out and I could, thanks! Saved me like 60lb in stash!
---
I am on Xbox, what’s your tag?
---
Thanks for that possible ending!
---
I don't know if I have exceptional luck in this game (would be weird considering my luck seems to be terrible in every other MMO endgame grind) but I've had very good luck with Scorched Earth.  Granted I've only gotten a \*\*\* item three or four times from the SBQ, but the two star items have been very good.  My very first run I got a mutant slayers explosive combat rifle, and my latest run I got a \*\*\* heavy combat chest piece with +10 mutation DR, +1 End and 20% food/chem weight reduction.  I cant imagine finding something better than that for my  sniper build.  I also got 2 different plans once, one as an event reward and one on the queen.  One was a prime single action revolver receiver and the other was ultracite arms.  I don't use pistols or power armor, but it'll be nice to be able to make parts and mods for other people when camp vending is a thing.
---
I do agree that the ultimate end game event should have a 75+% or guaranteed chance at a 3 star legendary upon completion, with a similar RNG table upon looting the queen, who is clearly far beyond a 3\* legendary enemy.  Given the breadth of weapons, armor and legendary effects, finding even a \*\* weapon you can use with decent effects is very difficult.  My close quarters weapon is an armor piercing handmade rifle with VATS accuracy bonus.  Ideally, I'd want a two shot with armor piercing or instigating effect.  Explosive effect is dangerous at close quarters, even with padded chest armor.  
---
For builds that don't use power armor, Scorched Earth is not that significant of an event aside from prime receivers, which are ridiculously cost-ineffective to use.  The ammo should be normal or possibly require double standard materials.  Stabilized flux is not that easy to get, weighs a pound each in the stash and doesn't yield that much ammo even with ammosmith and super duper.  Finding one armor piercing legendary rifle that I can use as a dedicated Scorched Earth gun would be nice, except that rifles weigh 20+ in the game and I can't justify stashing that plus special ammo for one event.  Swapping receiver mods from prime to normal and back again is costly as well.  My real life lever action hunting rifle easily weighs less than 10 lbs with wood furniture, a full 8 round tube, a canvas sling and a 10x scope.
---
I didn't know about superduper i'll have to try and get that.
---
Haha it always seems to be rubber for me.
---
This is the only thing on my mind. Hopefully the player trade can recover as player owned vendors are brought in.
---
I'm the same, I'm actually paying for this skin with the atoms I've gotten for doing the weekly and daily challenges. 
---
1k was to much for 1 skin I admit but this if way more appealing to me. 
---
Bought it yesterday at Grafton station @ level 45, took me about 30 minutes server hopping for it to spawn in its inventory.
---
Think the price was around 700 caps with the 3* bargain perk.
---
Take note the plan is called something like "lever rifle plan" not lever action rifle plan.
---
Nope, I was 50+ when I bought it.
---
Yeah, essentially.
---
Now it's just daily events, general events, and workshops. Grind for better legendaries if you're into that. I'm working on challanges as something to do. The atoms are nice as well.
---
no, that's the "repair the bot" quest, and he dies every time after you fix him unless you can't then he explodes
---
They're easy enough when the game works properly and you're geared out with a TSE weapon. Sometimes I can take one down with four to five rounds, even if they don't touch down. Sometimes they bug out and don't seelem to register the fact that they should be taking damage or falling out of the sky. 
---
Really glad to hear that!! I wish I could buy that lol
---
It would make sense since a playground killed everyone.  But I'd love to see humans coming from the capital  wasteland eventually
---
You should be able to get them by taking the Lakeside Cabins workshop.
---
You have the shield BoS under armor plan? Do tell where you got it. 
---
Possibly. I suspect that's exactly what this is, too. 
---
They do drop prime receiver plans rarely. I got probably 5 or 6 off regular scorch beasts and the rest from the queen. I know every prime receiver now so I don't even bother looting scorchbeasts. 
---
It's weird that they don't become legendary ever. And I can gain more experience killing a sentry bot in whitesprings than a level 80 SB. 
---
Last patch was Dec. 19th and it was just a hot fix. Last real patch was the 11th. Almost 1 month. Bethesda has already abandoned this title. They'll might be another patch or two this year but don't expect much. 
---
Stay away from the pink stuff, it has side effects
---
It’s the duplicators fault. They are doing something wrong and they know it.
---
If you find a wallet and don’t give it back when you could, that is wring. Just because another party gives you the means to be immoral doesn’t excuse you.
---
I like the game, too, but this is accurate. The sycophants need to stop with downvotes. You can love the game and still acknowledge it's a mess.
---
Honestly, I don't trust anything I see. Outside the guy Bethesda flat-out said they banned, I don't trust that they're banning anybody. 
---
I do also find mole miners creepy
---
When I first fought one I thought it'd be a formidable foe. And that was the height of the experience. I ran out of ammo and my friend whose a melee build was more frustrated than I was. In the end the loot wasnt worth it and I spent the next hour finding materials for gun repairs.
---
Don't pick up that fookin nightkin skull
---
I hope they give you a choice to load into a PvP server, or a PvE sever. Kinda like what WoW does, or at least did in 2010 when I last played. 99% sure this was the game that allowed you to pick... Anyway, I'd love to never have to worry about player to player damage again.
---
A bug this major really shouldn't be in the game 2 months after release
---
Not sure if it just add physical damage or multiplies explosive but it does increase damage 
---
Like the knights underarmor, but the orange is black and black is cool. 
---
Sorry couldnt find a good picture on google and im about to hit the bed.

Dont you mean the Morgantown High School?
---
Replying for later use
---
\^\^ That's why I don't bother. Plus there are many glitches making them OP. There is also that Critical Hit Glitch, basically every shot is a critical hit, players in PVP love to use it.
---
It's not treated as an explosive weapon. Heavy weapons will buff the gun damage, and explosive perks will buff the explosion damage. So you can do both, explosive Legendaries are fucking stupid like that. 
---
Go ahead and use the heavy gunner perks. The non-explosive means fatman and grenade launchers.
---
It will still scale the damage, slightly, if you really want damage you want to get Demolition Expert.
---
I haven't had issues. Of course I'm a big guns explosive build. I use bunker buster and a furious prime exploding plasma gatling gun. Can kill 3 per plasma core. 50 cal is also a quick way to put them down. 
---
Nice I have the knights under armour. I’ll have to go check the spot myself and hope to find it :D black one looks cooler 
---
That chrome though 👌
---
Awesome, tyvm everyone =D
---
Welcome the wheel of time is my second favorite series 
---
nope, just the plan to craft the "officers underarmor", so the black version.  
---
atm can only upgrade to protective lining and treated lining :/
---
mutation cure serum would be neat
---
I got a car and a lifetime supply of cram on separate occasions. run into this one a lot but never got any good gear, luck shouldn't be the issue I have 12 in luck.
---
I think an exploding radium is best. Turn off demo expert but keep AOE increase perks on to get tags. I just picked one up and the damage is tiny but I haven’t missed any tags
---
Yeah it's fixed 
---
My biggest pet peeve... SMs are always taking out my turrets before that can attack back. 
---
Yeah, I agree they should do something to fix that constant Spam in the long run.
---
Christ, I wish. Duped two-shot explosive weapons have spread like herpes since they fixed it. 
---
yeah ashing/gooing an enemy breaks the lootability (which kinda makes sense but also overly punishes and already heavily punished weapon type) and the Robots issue at white spring is due to people log cycling with buddies to force respawn things like ghouls during a nuke to farm legendaries
---
Sometimes Gatling Guns do the same for some odd reason every once in a while, the shots literally go off to the side when firing straight forward and nothing hits, even at point-blank range. Normally swapping to another gun and swapping back helps, but that doesn't even work all the time... Damn Bethesda and the endless bugs lol
---
Your a moron if you think I'm actually calling it a movie when I'm clearly using that term to describe poor gameplay mechanics and horrendous mission design. Which I've been clear about, so it's much more than a buzz word. But like the gameplay and mission design, your argument is weak as fuck.
---
Scorched beasts can still be a bit buggy but much improved 
---
haha, well at the rate the price is dropping and the hate is rising i'm sure you can get it for less than you paid for the standard copy soon enough. 
---
PVP is crap.... We don't understand it because it's crap. It's not the fault of people that really enjoy the fallout series that Bethesda decided to add it to a great game and destroy the foundations of what it was built on.
---
I couldn't stop laughing when i found that one.
---
tbh getting wood and scrap is easier and faster than getting 100 caps
---
but that's just my low charisma character 
---
Gather them when "hearth of the swamp" becomes active on the map, BEFORE completing the event.
---
Yeh Ive been a lucky boi and had 2months paid leave. Not much to do in my neck of the woods when you are trying to save money.
---
Lucky my other job involves little more then monitoring a device and then pushing buttons, so I could still play at the same time.
---
TLDR
---
I was paid to play F76.
---
Lol then your still missing some plans :p. Was excited for a second you gave me hope that my long search was over. 
---
Haha still good job as a fellow BoS heavy combat armor user welcome to the club 
---
Fixed
---
Awesome ty.
---
That's understandable.  My issue wasn't so much about the fight being easy or hard . It was more to do with how there is this perceived sense of entitlement, that people think if they beat it, they deserve a substantial reward. I'm saying yes the fight could and probably should be scaled or changed to possibly be more ' fun ' but that I don't see an issue with the fight not dropping baller loot everytime.
---
no it's not
---
it was in the patch notes but still happens
---
less often with regular enemies, but it's pretty much the same with Scorchbeasts still

no. im talking ore. so much goddamn ore that you'll be wondering how to get more steel to keep up. (i havent found a way yet myself)

If it's anything like the PS4 experience you'll be find most of the time... But you will run into a day where you'll get disconnected several times in a row. I find if you get disconnected more than twice in an hour it's best just to put it down for a bit and come back a few hours later.
---
Because we are in unacknowledged beta.
---
I rage quit after fighting scorch queen for the third time and my gun stopped doing damage ( and all your guns). Guess I'll try it out again.
---
I never found them anywhere except at Vendor Bot Greg in central Grafton, none of the railway bots ever had it after a week of searching. It's around 790 caps with level 3 Barter perks.
---
My friend is thinking of building there and doesnt mind running back up. 
---
Is this the spot where you have to climb the cliff, cross on the downed trees to the tracks, then run out to the pylon?  Pretty far run on one beam.
---
Question: Can you place any foundation up there?

I agree travel mats should work!!

*not* fixed

Huh, this is more the subreddit that I was looking for. Thank you

I appreciate the beautiful caves of Skyrim. I’m just biting my nails waiting for an ugly Falmer to pop out from behind one of those rocks.

Close the application completely and restart it.

You get those for free from the Miner Miracles quest :/

Then it must be fixed for everyone but you.

I wasnt bragging. More telling the truth and proving a point that the OPs logic is munted.
---
In fact OP is cutting their nose to spite thier face, thats my point.
---
I got mine from defending billings homstead
---
Ever since I got my TSE Dragon they haven't bothered me, I really haven't even seen one...
---
Which one?
---
bad luck. i still see them pretty regularly, it just seems that they're less common now because advanced connectors no longer shares the name.

I am Interested as well

Queen doesnt bug at all now. regular scorched beast will regen sometimes but die easy for the most parts
---
If your on pc you can use perk manager its like top downloaded mod for 76. A click of a button and boom you swap all perks around. Set up a camp set , melee , range , quick hacking , quick lockpicking ajd so on what ever you desire.
---
Its such a QOL mod.
---
right after the patch hit there were multiple people reporting the same
---
there still are, saw a topic a few days ago
---
It dosent happen to me
---
Hey good luck on the interview, don't sell yourself short. They're the ones who need you!
---
Chems
---
For my first few hours of my game some guy kept following me and my friend 
---
Well the fat man is still pretty underpowered so it wouldnt do that anyways. Couldve been a group grinding it out with a bunch of legendaries. Once you get the queen to land its not as hard to kill her. Granted u gotta fight off scorched and such but in my experience it makes it so so much easier when people can just wail on her with melee
---
They're only easy to kill if you have OP stuff. If you're a general player that isn't min maxing they're extremely difficult and you get nothing from it.

“Mad Max Style leather armor”

Like the “[Road Leathers](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Road_leathers_(Fallout_76))”? 
---
Oh dang, I'm xbox. Good thing it exists already then, that's useful.
---
As I have seen it the issues that seriously hurt this game are the same bugs going all the way back to the first game this engine was used for, Morrowind, and if they had just borrowed/stolen/bought the fixes from the community for their previous games it could have avoided a large amount of the grief over this "incomplete" game.
---
We didn't do anything. It is all about the bottom line.  The new, cheaper prices are only that way bc sales were lagging.
---
Sadly internet warriors rarely get anything accomplished.
---
I meant to upgrade to the next level tier so it can grow with you.
---
Me and the crew I team up with got our first last night. Damn thing was at my camp. Heck of a surprise when I fast traveled there with my friends that are all lvl 20's or lower. 
---

---
Pulowski Preservation shelters protect you! As long as you don't open the door when the blight is falling. The problem is the scorchbeast seems to not forget about you and won't leave.
---
O poo see this is why they need to hurry up and support mods in game like FO4. Even if its just interface mods until private servers. Too mant QOL stuff is done through mods in Beth games.
---
Yea I agree with you. We will see what they come up with. I just really hate the atmosphere player interaction currently has and dislike pacifist mode in general. I feel like whether you want to risk accidentally harming another player should be a part of the game. With TSEs and melee being the two best ways to fight currently I think forcing people to risk harming teammates and other players and leaving nuke zones with high bounties would help reduce the use of TSEs in general. 
---
Now hear me out what if they used the player vending to help develop the community from moving towards always kill on site on pvp servers. They should allow you to “blacklist” players from buying from your vendor or just automatically make it where you can’t interact with vendors owned by players that you have killed. There are so many players that killing other players from time to time won’t hurt you that much but if “raiding” becomes your thing it will eventually come back to bite you in the ass. 
---
I mean I have my fair amount of duped weapons as lets be honest that just about every TSE gun is a dupe, and if they wipe every TSE from the game at this point I really wouldn't care as I believe one of the main balancing issues with two shot explosives is that everybody has one and it was meant to be a rare RG drop. And they kinda make that game boring.
---
That's good.
---
Not every 3 star is even good.
---
Nah
---
Reddit isn't the place for this form of communication. It's not effective or lend itself to analysis very easily. Content gets lost. People feel lost. And things get repeated a lot instead of consolidated where everyone reactions can be measured.
---
It's just not ideal for reporting bugs and giving suggestions. That's a misuse of Reddit and that's why it's frustrating to everyone.
---
What console mate?
---
I can whip you up a serum if you're on xbox
---
i can confirm, very rare now but it happened twice to me over the weekend with my harpoon
---
Its possible to 3 shot her solo with the right weapons and right amount of bobble head's (duped) apparently :/
---
&gt;It’s a $60 movie 
---
&gt;lmao I’m not calling it a movie
---
&gt;“Your a moron”
---
Nice. Either come up with a clear argument or stop replying, seriously. Also, using a term like “movie” as a loose way to describe something is literally a buzzword, so good job on admitting that’s exactly how you’re using it. 
---
I can near endlessly list of super hard fights in a variety of different games that are only there for the achievement of beating it, or offer little to no reward. I don't think ' it's a game ' justifies the position that you should be rewarded over and above for beating end game content. That's my opinion at least. 
---
Kinda fixed. Airborne monsters still regen health if shot with tse, often.
---
Not only do these items not have Condition, but they don't possess any other variables as well. Ro the database they are just a name and a yes/no.
---
You must live near me. It's $20 for the movies before you get popcorn and a drink. They cost as much as the tickets.
---
Thanks. I just claimed it and got a bear proof trash can, though. It must be random.

What, this? No, this is unyielding armor. No chameleon armor here no sir. Oh, my trade window is bugged. I can't accept trades.

Things will never be like that time long ago. Get used to it. Me personally a big fan of f 1 and 2, but all I got today is this and I can't do anything about it. So make the best of it.
---
The serums are selling for 500 ish on the secondary market. Post on r/fo76bazaar that you're looking for some and someone will undoubtedly contact you.  
---
kinda, its super rare but still occurs (i had it twice over the weekend with my harpoon gun)
---
Nah stromboli is something else completely different. I ain't hating on a stromboli....but true pepperoni rolls are unique that you find in Mom and Pop has stations around here. 
---
Now mind you home made pepperoni rolls are da bomb but you can still be satisfied with the ones from the school fundraisers that your coworkers kid comes into your office and guilt trips you in to buying 30$ worth of them.
---
In Northern WV they put peppers in them, which orginally from south centralish wv (between Huntington and Charleston) was unheard of. I mean I grew up beside some good hollars that had some good people but never was there peppers on a pepperoni roll.
---
When I moved closer to Morgantown I found this to be true in the in betweens of Morgantown and New Martinsville. 
---
I think it might be the evils of the PA boarders seeping in but I give it up to some different cultural traditions.
---
See Northern Mining and Southern mining differ some in WV.
---
Also why the hell do they have Welch and not Matewan.
---
I makes no sense. 
---
Also Stewart's original hotdogs are so much better than those gourmet dogs they serve at Hill Billy hotdogs, I mean that was a product of those Hipsters and such.
---
AND WHERE ARE THE RIVERS
---
But I digress....
---
Pepperoni rolls , as much as a stereotype for West Virginia has become, it is one of those jokes that we take to heart and are proud of. Like ramps and RC cola.
---
AND I KNOW THEY CAN'T LISCENSE TRADEMARK NAMES.
---
But pepperoni rolls are our thing, as much as Mothman as much as coal.
---
ITT: Bunch of min max mutation players in groups assuming everyone is like them or has the time to farm scorchqueen kills 
---
I'd say so
---
I am pretty much in the same boat. I don't like server hopping as I may or may not get stuck in an infinite load screen. I love my 2 shot (non explosive) gatling gun, my furious gatling gun and my ghoul slayers (explosive one shot) gatling gun. I keep all 3 on me (because sometimes if you get like one sb after another after another your weapon will break before you finish killing them all) and farm for lead all day to make bullets lol
---
But I always win. Unless I get discod
---
I like it a lot on my T-60 ... It feels like it is about 50% faster AP Regen over stock.
---
This is the main reason I'm so glad I have an explosive Gatling. If it doesn't land in about a minute or just spams it's sonic attack literally non-stop for 30 seconds causing me to heal over and over, I close the game and re-log. If it lands relatively quickly, the gun kills it fast without wasting hundreds of rounds. If two or three aggro, I log out immediately. 
---
Lmao let people the game it's really not hurting you.
---
this whole thread is a big yikes
---
Do you know what MMO stands for?
---
Which in this game is considered fixed
---
I'm going to agree because that is the dumbest autocorrect.
---
Most of the time he sleeps in technically third unmarked lake from Twin Lakes which you can get to following streams from lakes. Camp by him is really neat as he always drops nicely modded weapons, armors, caps, ammo, some junk and nuclear material.
---
So you have never played dark souls? 
---
My favorite part is going to be suppressing y'all's mutations with rad-x. Just try and jump with those TSE weapons without your marsupial. &gt;:3
---
I’m not saying duplicating isn’t immoral, I’m saying if someone laid $60 for a game, they should not be permanently banned for the servers being so slow that you can duplicate items by leaving and rejoining. 
---
These could've been the coolest encounters in the game totally missed the mark Bethesda 
---
At the vaulttec farm facility near flat woods in the “barn” where the last protection leader spawns for the “fertile soil” event,  upstairs and arguing the little central bit next to a barrel there’s a rad bear and a bubblegum bear in a 69.
---
For me sorting by condition is completely broken, at the top I get a random assortment of things that have no spoil timer and a mix of high and low condition stuff.
---
The queen has a lot of dmg resist. To damage her you need perk that ignores armor. If you are using a explosive shotgun the best you can do is cripple her with the enforcer perk and take care of mobs around the melee players while they are hitting the queen, just let them get some kills before she lands so they can charge their adrenaline perk.
---
I understand that, it was just in reference to a previous comment .
---
Yeah, there's some RNG involved. I got both the barn plans and the warehouse from that one and the Junkyard workshop near Vault 76.
---
*shrug*  And I would counter saying I farmed this spawn for about a month of real time, granted I play short sessions and don't server hop.
---
Given the sheer jankiness of the engine and the inability of even modders to correct certain bugs and errors, who actually knows?  All I can relay is what I've seen.
---
Under conditions where the only observable variable that was different was the CAMP location, it affected the ability of the vendor to spawn in the trials I witnessed.
---
I have wondered though if it's really the CAMP that does it, or the proximity of another player to the area triggering the encounters before you get there?  That's still a good reason not to put the CAMP there of course.
---
Be sure to put your platform in the original post so people know whether they can team up with ya!
---
Yes thank you i completely forgot
---
Confirmed for me at level 67 - I server-hopped for 2 hrs last night and didn't get anything (going to both vendors at Grafton each time), but got all three sets of plans (arms, legs, chest) in only 5 hops today.
---
Platform?
---
Only reason I did the quest. Though excavator armour is pretty useful it turns out :)
---
Go read a dictionary dumbass. Lol.
---
Yes i forgot to mention it im on pc
---
Let us know your platform buddy. I spend alot of time crafting gear and weapons to help low levels out.
---
Doubt anything like this could be implemented BUT you can get creative with what we have available now. Bethesda could add more natural cave features for us to improve. 
---
You can build down. On cliffs. There are cliffs with caves, U shaped cliffs, and a few [rock arches](https://www.google.com/search?q=rock+arch&amp;oq=rock+arch&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l3.2353j0j7&amp;client=ms-android-att-us&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8) there are some narrow crevices/canyons you could improve too. Create the illusion of what you want. 
---
You already get pretty dang close. The game could use more caves, narrow crevaces craters etc.  I think thats how they planned on adding to the game anyway. Its a mining town.
---
That’s the thing, all these people are arguing with me to ban all dupers or anyone who has a duped item. Yet we all have a TSE, like literally every one of us, and purely from a statistical point of view, 95% or more of them are duplicated, whether you got it from a duper or 10 trades down the line, it’s all the same, it’s duped. So to ban everyone who has used duped shit would be like.... everyone.... 
---
I am on pc 
---
I just got killed in 3 shots while in pacifist mode
---
What platform are you on?
---
From what I've read of people testing, that's exactly what happens.
---
If you have mutfruits in your inventory at 10% condition, all the mutfrut you pick up will end up with 10% condition. This can however be used in reverse if you care to. Drop all your almost spoiled food, pick up fresh food, then pick up the almost spoiled stack. Everything will have full condition.
---
I’m not really that good at deterring stats but it looks like it’d be pretty good for tanking some damage while dishing it out too. Might be better on a different melee weapon, though 
---
I’m 66 and I don’t have any TSE. I use a .308/.50 hunting rifle and cover then switch to a dragon to crit their face. The sonic attacks don’t penetrate trees so you just circle a tree and shoot them. The crop dusting is negligible with  radshield. The 80s from nuke zones are tougher but only because there’s often less cover. 
---
I hope you don’t mind if I send you guys a friend request too. 😉😂
---
Just keep playing.  I've been solo the whole way and now lvl 80.  Do some events.  People will show up and help.  Keep scrounging, it's part of the game.  Keep on passive mode so you don't get into PVP attacks.  Someone starts trying something just ignore them and move on, or jump servers.
---

---
Add me HeroJoker1992 
---
I will keep you supplied and my camp is setup at Overseers camp all the free food, water, rad shower , ap / bed buffs and all crafting stations man.
---
Same- I just picture every dusty corpse is Marcy Long. Still wish I could’ve banished her from our settlement. Nothing we did was ever good enough for that constant complainer
---
Ok ill add you asap thank you for your generosity
---
Should be hopefully, they said the next patch is gonna be a big one. They had said mid-January at some point so I would think it'll be a week from today
---
yeah cover interacts really wierd with the sonic attack... it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't for me.
---
Liked it worked in glassed cavern's, and in the line in the sand event but then three show up in white spring and they blasts just go through the pillars and such like they aren't there...
---
No problem my man you will find most of the community does the same. Also i will be on in a few  days currently away at work.
---
When are you online normaly
---
Not even mentioning that a fool enemy is a crutch to hide bad enemies or lack of challenge, they aren’t even a good foil. Anyone with a gun can kill them by around level 40 with no real danger, and anyone with melee just has to go somewhere else. Why would anyone want to deal with that?
---
The only thing I found really efficient is sharing the rad sponge perk with your group
---
That looks horrible.
---
Me too, he's dead set against it. 
---
Actually quite easy solo as not as many turrets and robots spawn. If you're that worries there are shortcuts you can take via hacking and lock picking so maybe Google them. 
---
Take 10 to be safe I guess, my advice is if it's your first one don't Google a thing stock up to like 30 and take your time! I loved my first silo, one of my wasteland tales :) 
---
Good luck!
---
I only kill them for ultracite scrap, or if they’re in the way. Sometimes though, I’ll just server hop. I just ran into two hovering over some place right in the middle of the Ash Heap. Someone trained them there, and I couldn’t do anything in the Ash Heap cause otherwise their “Magic Player Location Sense” would just cause them to find me and harass me, F. That. Plus this is on my melee character, what a pain.
---
Work sucks but at least your getting paid
---
If my husband did this to me I'd be so pissed 😂
---
To be fair, we tend to carry each other. He started a second character before me so it's fun to kick ass to protect him sometimes lol 
---
I’ve been combining rad-x and rad shield. There is probably a better method.
---
I use a hazmat suit, always. PA is for pussies!
---
But really the PA I wanna wear is garbage .. everywhere. So this is easier for me. I also sneak a lot so I rarely get hit .. something to take into account.
---
BUT
---
Rad x, diluted Rad x, rad shield .. I know there is a food that helps but I can't remember it off the top of my head. T60 with BoS paint job.
---
I didnt know there was passive mode thats nice
---
an abundant amount of rad x and radaway 
---
Why pay when fast travel can be free? 
---
I know, I know, I'll close the door when I leave. 
---
Some crazy fuck launched three consecutive nukes last night, but he was a level 240 lol I haven’t even tried myself, wish I could tell ya. I heard that a good run usually takes approx. 15 mins.
---
I work odd hours and day/ night swapping so i couldn't tell ya. But when i am on i spend my time helping others and so does the BOS group i am apart of. Since we are decked to the nines ready and waiting for vaults.
---
No idea on plasma flamer or legendary fore effects, but it does work with the shishkebab.
---
Ah okay. I’ll start trying that more often too. Hopefully won’t take too much longer. Thanks!
---
This is why I stopped buying games at release more or less and wait for the eventual price slash. Been burned by too many games for me to consider preorder's at this point
---
Yeah. 
---
Probably where I got it. 
---
1. Robots blew the daylights out of me and 2 others who showed up. It wasn't a cakewalk. 
---
2. There are probably some folks who would like to have one *before* they get powerful enough to do the quest. 
---
3. Some server hopping farmers have lots of caps and would appreciate the convenience of being able to meet someone in Flatwoods and just buy one. 
---
Yeah we all have our rolls to play and all have to work and i enjoy my job. :)
---
I generally use Rad-X with my Power Armor. I don’t use anything else par a radaway every so often. These are all easy to come by.
---
It sucks because when I first saw them I was absolutely amazed. I couldn’t stop following it with my eyes. Now I groan whenever I hear a fucking screech
---
Just something to try not sure it works have not tried it out but I saw a u tube video that showed moving the little camp workshop around inside the green area can actually change your spawn location. 
---
Okay thanks. I didn’t know the connectors had been fixed, so that’s good at least. I’ll keep on stopping by.
---
I think there's a fair number of new players buying up plans this week.  Sure they will be there at Harper's sooner than later.  If he hasn't got them maybe try another server as likely you'll find most vendors have sold out of all CAMP Plans.
---
My friend and I had him for a lot longer than that. Be sure to actually interact with him(sell him a stimpac or something or buy something). Only reason we lost him was a server drop
---
I'm assuming nothing.  I'm saying the game is too easy, and that making it easier is going to make it worse.  Everyone wants loot.  Games that give everyone loot aren't fun.
---
1. PC:  
---
GTX1080  
---
ryzen 2700x  
---
16 GB ram

2. Pomatomaster
---
3. n/a
---
4. I'm trying to complete to obtain a government id for the brotherhood quest in Charleston. Every time I try and exit the DMV however to get the postal stamp, my game hard freezes. I've tried lowering my settings and that didnt seem to fix the problem.
---
u/southcitytan has a great description of where to find it with screenshots. Check out that post
---
I don't wait for the prize, I just shoot lol
---
Aim for crits on wings. Works 90% of the time to force then to land 
---
Its not that they're apex or difficult, its the sheer annoyance on how long it'll normally take to kill, considering they have endless breath for their screech. There should be SOME sort of inhale time or something to give us a break from that, thats my main complaint about them, everything else is manageable
---
Yes, I did it solo, not much higher level than you..  I probably did use up a lot of stims and plasma grenades.  I'd bring at least 20 or so diluted stims.  I forgot which mission, but somehow I got a 10mm auto pistol and an assaultron blade that are buffed for robots.  Helps some.  One tip is to try and hack terminals to make turrets work for you.  Also, once you get most of the servers fixed, best bet is to try and make the rest at the tinker bench.  A bit tricky if using power armor hopping in/out.
---
I'll give you a hug because you've clearly had a bad day. I've had a bad few months myself. \*HUG\*  
---
Platinum platter please. I don't think it makes anything easier. We already have the information but not in an easily distinguishable form. A problem I hadn't considered is where items in a stack have differing conditions. If you have a suggestion for that then please add it  :)
---
Smg with drum mag, closest thing to a handmade
---
Really feeling like the 15 would be a good spot and seems others feel that way as well.
---
this so much tesla can chain off players to so you dont have to worry about people walking in front of you
---
Wait.... you can make serums? Do I need to find a recipe? (I’m on PS4)
---
I have to agree with DrAckrite here, duplication is in fact a game mechanic even if its an exploit. These days its not as common but in the past, it was incredibly normal for people to exploit game mechanics for their own advantage because it was accepted as part of the game. Sometimes exploits resulted in negatively impacting the game, such as Diablo 1 and Phantasy Star Online, but other times they resulted in huge positive effects to the game such as in Smash Brothers Melee and Starcraft 1. In some games, exploits were so common that people didn't even know they were exploits like bunny-hopping in the original Counterstrike.
---
I understand that duping is almost an entirely nother level of a problem and so it might be treated differently, but I still think permabanning on first offense without a prior warning is a bit extreme. There can be some people who have duped without knowing how bad it was and its long term potential impact on the game economy, essentially i think only people who duped with actual bad intentions should actually be banned, so the best way to determine this is to give warnings or temp bans and then a perma ban for the second infraction.
---
While we’re on topic.
---
The trashcan fire item for basebuilding is pretty nice. 
---
I like the lighting effects it gives off.
---
I did it with 3 stims and 1 super stim in about 20 mins, died 3 times when the reactor was malfunctioning and I had to wear my hazmat suit because dumb fuck over here ran out of fusion cores, got through it tho and defended the lads as they set up the nuke and at the very end my dumb ass put in the wrong code so it didn’t launch diddly squat 
---
suppressors is pretty blah.
---
The only 3 star loot I have I bought, I have launched 3 nukes a week and fight in at least 2 SBQ events a day for about a month now, I get a 1 star wood armor and ultracite armor plan and mod plan from her and usually a prime receiver plan from the quest reward. I'm lvl 115 and don't even have a TSE gun yet, best weapon is a 2 shot .50 cal machine gun but I don't have the prime receiver for it yet.
---
Did the event twice, no blooms.  Others are in bloom but wouldn't let me pick albeit the A. was there.
---
I like this idea, but we all kinda have an idea of what we need to keep and we maintain those numbers ourselves yeah?
---
Every once in awhile, aka whenever I’m full, I’ll go through and reduce my junk numbers in categories that don’t matter much. 
---
Explosive is overpowered for the most part, if you have the explosives expert perk it'll usually deal more damage than a two shot. However, two shots do seem to work better against enemies like Scorchbeasts because it seems like the explosive has trouble hitting them in the air. Combat rifle, I believe would do the most damage of of these.
---
I really wish they'd streamline power connection, or allow us to have powered wall pieces with an outlet, like the vault walls in Fo4.  I can appreciate exposed wires running everywhere for that rough wasteland look, but it looks really weird with a brick walled house.  Even the advanced power connection plan with the conduit system is really clunky and difficult to use, and doesn't look all that great.  Instead of wires everywhere, you have an intricate system of tubes all over the house that sucks up your camp budget.  They don't follow ceilings or walls well.
---
Personally, I'd make all structural pieces like walls, floors and roofs electrified if you put a socket connecting a wall to the generator, and all pieces connected to that have the option to share the camp power grid.  Using a conduit that could snap-attach to any structural piece would allow you to attach a wire easily to peripherals like turrets, water purifiers, and powered things without running wires all over the place and clogging up the budget with dozens of connectors everywhere.
---
With the vault pieces from the Fo4 DLC, the basic coding is there for integrated structural power and could be applied to 76 without massive effort.
---
This is your best option, and I've found that Rad Sponge 2 works just fine and 3 isn't necessary. If you're not in a team then just bring plenty of Rad Away and have it favorited.
---
what did he say?
---
my friend got a TSE handmade from Uranium Fever legendary mole miners at the blackwater mine
---
Oh yeah I agree. I never had a problem with 400 and thought complaints were silly then until I hit level 50 and I was carrying around level 50 stuff. 
---
So yeah 400 was doable but imo not long term. 600 is a much more long term limit and I'm perfectly fine never increasing it again. Unless they add more items to the game.
---
Combat rifle is overall best for general gameplay most of the time. 
---
Radium is best against environment targets that have no radiation protection. Most scorch beasts is an example. 
---
Submachine gun is hilarious. Use it when you're bored of single shot stuff and want to tear things apart with extreme messiness 
---
All of these weapons are good for PvP as long as you're fighting players that don't have explosive rounds.  Check my bio if your looking for other PvP fans on Xbox one 
---
Which post exactly 
---
Reloaded my Gamma gun yesterday. Somehow it went from from 100 magazine capacity to 300? Then again it happened jumping from 300 to 306. 
---
How? Why? Huh?
---
No clue how/why this happened or how to restore my gun to its original capacity outside of scrapping mods :/
---
Thats great its not too common where someone acually enjoys their job :)
---
Agreed
---
Thanks!  It was hidden in plain site for sure 😁👍
---
So not really worth anything.
---
Even the weight savings?
---
Did someone give you a set before you finished the mission?
---
Did you do Miner Miracles?
---
There's a lot of good videos on youtube on this, but he best spot for legendaries is at the whitespring's golf resort. Just stand out side and start server hopping every time you defeat them. there are quite a lot of ghouls, so be careful. I would also recommend jumping in a hazmat suit or power armor to protect yourself in case a nuke was dropped there. Great for farming ammo and meds.
---
If you were a ghoul you could go around slapping scorch fossils to heal.  OP AF.
---
From what I hear the inventory system isn't exactly...appropriate for the current use case.
---
Supposedly the game tracks literally every individual item. As in, stack of 3000 steel scrap is 3000 entries tracked, instead of doing something sane like tracking it as one entry with an additional variable to track the amount.
---
Uncle Handy’s naked handy basement.
---
I appreciate you taking the time to answer my question thank you!
---
It's easier to do with just a couple of people that have high DPS than a server of players (especially if lowbies are there). 
---
Queens' health scales with the number of players in the event area. 
---
Anything he does say WILL be taken the wrong way by the community, I think it is wise, he will start speaking when the heat does down or they add a bunch of content or something.
---
PA + all three variants of rad-x or just diluted rad-x + radshield if you have mutations.
---
for comparison, a damaged hazmat has 500 rad resist and I can comfortably trek through an irradiated Whitesprings.
---
keep in mind that you need a full set of PA for the rad resist to work. if you're missing a limb it won't work.
---
I went into site Alpha in Excavator armor without knowing it was supposed to be a group thing.  I knew absolutely nothing about what was inside.  It's not particularly difficult, but it is a grind.
---
Food was more of an issue for me than stimpacks.  I think I used maybe 20 stimpacks total, but there was almost no food in there so I had to switch in the food perk and still ended up starving by the time I finished.
---
As a rifleman, I ran out of ammo on my main weapon and backup, and ended up finding and modding a shotgun in there just to finish it off.
---
I also crashed once and ended up having to do about 1/3 of it over again :/
---
800 sounds great, my gamertag is "Zombi3 2000" if you wanna add me and then message me on there and ill invite you when im on if that sounds good?
---
Making Wood furniture is definitely going to be a big part of my day LOL
---
That lists a jetpack mod for the excavator armor.  Does it actually exist? Never seen anyone with one equipped. 
---
I have seen videos of how useful the Cryolator is in this fight, haven't seen it firsthand yet.  Maybe if I farm up a two shot one for the extra ammo savings.  I also would like to add make sure you have someone with the syringer doing the -25% dmg resist debuff and if anyone has any a pumpkin grenade every time she lands greatly speeds up killing her as well.  Without the cryolator a decent, not even a best in slot super pimped out team, but a decent team of four can drop her in under 6 minutes, even when half the server shows up.
---
Syringe with Endangerol barrel makes a big difference. 2 shot 50cal should be doing your part. 
---
Get the Health Regeneration mutation. 
---
Haha yeah I’m not that great but I am trying. Gimme some time and check back in to let me know if I’ve improved.  Always up for constructive dialogue. 
---
I %100 agree with you, but we need communication. That's the reason there is so much hate. From the 500 atoms canvas bag to the nuka dark rum. Communication is key.
---
Done that a couple times.  Got nothing special.
---
Then it is extremely rare. All I use is explosive weapons, and I use them a lot, my friends too. Hasn't happened to any of us since the patch. So I guess if it is still happening it is so rare it has become a non-issue. Before the patch I couldn't get through a silo without getting the glitch. Now it hasn't happened at all for me or anyone I know. Of course non of us use full auto. Perhaps that has something to do with it. I'd be interested in seeing how many of the people whos still see this happen use explosive weapons with high rates of fire.
---
They don't pay him enough for this shit. Lol
---
But in all seriousness I'm guessing they told him to stay silent til further notice or he is the lonevaultwanderer.
---
Yeah they did fix it so that it doesn't double dip anymore unfortunately.
---
Yup
---
Or he's on holidays. 
---
People forget, the more rich you are the longer your holidays are.
---
He's gotta be doing ok for himself financially, decent paying gig. Having a few weeks off on holiday is also possible.
---
They've communicated to us about all those things already though.. (sans the rum). 
---
It worked for no man's sky. 
---
&gt;It’s like Bethesda didn’t even try to fight one,
---
I have 300 hours invested in this game on PS4 and enjoyed the ride with friends in spite of the serious shortcomings in polish, the world is complete with places to explore and story to learn.
---
**I believe that no one on the Bethesda or otherwise team even played this game as a whole.**
---
I really don't see how else repair costs for leather armor would be more expensive than actually building the armor...  or that you have no way of seeing what mods you already have when buying mods... or that your mods scrap when you have no steel in your inventory...  or that when buying mods sometimes you can't even see what gun it's for because the name is too long.
---
I really don't think they tested or played it much at all.  I don't believe there was any real testing with this game.
---
I still enjoyed it because I like the Fallout universe and the over arching plot is not bad.
---
Just did a WS nuke run today, and a Prime right after.  Probably killed around 10 legendaries at each one, all crap drops.  Didn't do the the server hop.  Never knew the nukes happen on all servers at the same time?  Always thought it was server specific.
---
Ayyyaayayyyy that reminds me of my company and our current archaic inventory system lol I’m on the process improvement team so now I know Bethesda’s pain because trying to revamp the system when it’s set up in such a shitty way is NOT easy
---
Parked mine near the penitentiary for easy checking of Event: Patrol Duty. Once I have the weapon plans I'm chasing, I'll probably move it over near Whitesprings somewhere, for cheaper fast travel to areas I frequent there.
---
Aqua boy I think
---
No not at all. Stop by anytime and enjoy our camp. Well she’s there more than I am but still. Stop by and say hi. 
---
Maybe lead belly?
---
there's nothing they *can* say. they acted in bad faith, no doubt about that. they were perfectly aware that what they were doing was wrong, but greenlit it anyhow.
---
so either they keep quiet or face potential legal repercussions.
---
yes and I also need Unyielding heavy metal right hand,  if you can help me  I would really reward you   
---
simply after throwing hundreds and hundreds useless legendary item just did not have luck with my right hand 
---
Turn on pacifist and you won’t have to worry about getting wanted for shooting peoples stuff
---
&gt; Buzzwords often derive from technical terms yet often have much of the original technical meaning removed through fashionable use, being simply used to impress others.
---
Calling a video game a movie is a buzzword. Something tells me you don’t spend any time reading, let alone actually knowing how to use words. 
---
True, though it'd be nice to be able to set those values once and not have to worry about it again. My stash fills up far too quickly and I've had to clear out unwanted junk 4 times today already. Checking bulked vs scrapped to make sure I don't throw away too much can be rather time consuming.
---
In my opinion, he's doing the smart thing and probably similar to what I'd do too in his position.
---
There's nothing really to say. What do you want, an apology? A detailed AMA on all the issues regarding Fallout 76?
---
People would just relitigate all their past missteps and misdeeds and even blame them for things they'd have no control over whatsoever.
---
It's a moronic PR move to put you into a no-win situation.
---
When there is something to announce, and something positive at that ideally, I'm sure he'll come out of the woodwork. He'll unquestioningly be around during the lead up to the next DLC/content release.
---
That's all assuming he's still not on holidays. 
---
EDIT: thirst quencher
---
I will also point out that the Marketing and Communications director does not need to be directly engaged on social media. 
---
He's the director. He directs. He directs other people below him...
---
Not to mention their ability to continuously stream their sonic attack.
---
A two shot fifty is fine tbh; it has reasonable sustained dps.
---
Just some pointers:
---
* Bring lots of ammo. A longer fight can be 10+ minutes. A short one with fewer, well-geared people can be over in a few minutes.
---
* Try to be aware of who is using explosive weapons because you really don't want to cross into their line of fire and get them killed.
---
* If you're even partially specced into melee (R2/3 Incisor with a good melee weapon) you might be better meleeing when the Queen lands.
---
* One Gun Army is good for scorchbeasts and melee enemies.
---
* If you don't see people jetpacking or jumping (Marsupial mutation) really high and firing at the ground with explosive weapons that's a sign that the group has lower dps and is busy dealing with the enemies the Queen is spawning. If you feel your dps is low you can help by killing those enemies while higher dps people focus on the Queen. A coordinated group of explosive weapons players will fire at enemies near other explosive toting players to help clear each other of mobs without risk of killing themselves.
---
* If they were smart they nuked the Prime Fissure so that you can group up at the fenced bunker without being in the nuke zone proper (no radiation). Jumping on top of the fence means you evade the melee enemies and can probably just shrug off any ranged if you're in power armor. You can jump on top of the bunker, but 1) melee enemies can path there, and 2) it's a smaller area for players to strafe through so accidentally gibbing yourself with an explosive weapon is riskier.
---
Honestly, just have fun. People complain about Queen scaling but it's *really not that hard.* The timer is generous and it's been weeks since I've seen a random Queen group not have the dps to kill her.
---
It is only server specific. But the two locations, from what I've seen, is Prime and Whitesprings. 
---
Ugh. Nuka rum. Not Bethesda's issue. 
---
Take it up with the bottling company who made the product.
---
Ski sword?  Look at Little Lord Fauntleroy over here with his ski sword!  I got cornered and had to try to poke a supermutant overlord to death with a fokken combat knife last night.  
---
Lucky Hole Mine
---
My favourite one I came across was a lion king style one. It was at the top of these shelves in a garage and one bear was holding the other bear over the edge...LONG LIVE THE KING 
---
What exactly can he say? I don't think he'd have anything meaningful to contribute right now. It would just be platitudes, and most people would see that as lip service. 
---
Bethesdas' community managers (including lonevaultwanderer) are the people to watch, they're the ones keeping the player base updated. 
---
Just go play the game and stop whining about not having certain items. 
---
Try moving your camp device around to change your spawn point
---
So there is a walking responder vendor that can randomly spawn near the Charleston area. The most consistent place to make him spawn is to travel to the Charleston train station, cross the red bridge near by, turn around and walk back over the bridge and head towards the wood shack next to the lake there. It will either spawn a random event (like a mister gust walking some dogs, a responder eye bot leading mice or a group of super mutants etc) or he vendor.
---
He sells random stuff not sold anywhere else like the hunter coat and other things. The inventory he has is random per person though.
---
I only used about 5.  Using T-51B/T-45 armor
---
How long did take you to find such a marvelous unsourced definition that loosely supports your argument? 
---
Oh yeah? What legal repurcussions Mr Lawyer?
---
Because, if hungy law firms haven't jumped on the lawsuit train..... I'm sure some random fuck redditor knows something they don't. 
---
People sell them for about 1500+ caps.. I bought one off a guy the other day for 1800. He said he was part of a clan that sold rare weapons, items and armour but I would bet that the gun I was sold was a dupe because he had multiple in his inventory. 
---
I hope they do. Most of the code is already there I'd imagine.
---
people forget Bethesda had to sign off on it. either that or they signed a very poor contract, which I doubt.
---
When I say planning I mean just knowing the resources you need and focusing on those. Springs? Go to sugar Grove or the basic training camp, there's a bunch. Plastic? The schools. Black titanium? Kill molemen. Lead? Lucky hole mine.. Etc etc. If you know you need stuff to craft PA let's say, then focus on that. People are so used to just picking up tons of crap and now it just makes it more complicated because you toss everything on your stash and half of it gets used. I had like 200 circuits, 600 rubber. Why? I clearly wasn't using it, so I bulk it up and sell it.
---
I only spend like 10 mins each play session figuring out what I need, bulking up previous loot, and selling and cleaning out my stash a bit. If I don't need it on my main, I transfer it to my alt.
---
I think some people just overexaggerate though "the stash is too small I can't play the game". It's crazy, it works if you are just mindful of what your looting when you play.
---
600 is fine, if they increase it then sure I'm not gonna argue. I just hope they do something to at least make traders viable. Right now I feel for those people who have to ration themselves even more just because they are role-playing as a vendor and they need to hold stock as well as their junk too. 
---
Could be very good (fun to try) against other players that have builds centred around one-hit melee tactics. 
---
If you're on Xbox one and want to sell it, I'll take it off you for some caps or something else you need. I play PvP all the time and even built my camp to attract PvP fans. Check my bio to see it! 
---
Bethesda had to sign off on what? A bottle case?
---
What's the problem there? 
---
If you have a friend to play with then have them or you share rad sponge (2) and then share ghoulish (1) and you'll get passive healing in the nuke zone.
---
Wear power armor when you teleport but also make sure your using a helmet.
---
Yeah, I personally believe they forgot they have it lol.
---
Ah, that's unfortunate.
---
Oh well. It wasn't the center of my build, anyway. It was just a nice little bonus that synergized well.
---
Want a few hundred 40mm grenades? :'D
---
I started a monster lmao
---
I just want them to make the queen loot auto-delivered via quest completion. Their Looting mechanic is buggy as all get out...
---
We’ll it wasn’t happening on release it happened after the 2nd set of updates I think 😑 
---
This would be so helpful 👍
---
I wouldn't be so bothered about scorchbeast attacks if they weren't like the equivalent of an AC130
---
I completely disagree. If you look at the star system, there are a very limited number of possible drops. That means every drop possible will drop every day if you implemented this idea.
---
Fuck it let's just name them FISTO
---
The dream &lt;3 
---
The enemies will progressively get stronger the further east you go, so I'd recommend taking it slow with the main quest. There are plenty of places to explore and events/quests/dailies in the Ash Heap, Forest and Toxic Valley that should have level appropriate enemies and will help you progress. 
---
If you really want to continue into the Savage Divide or Mire just remember that enemies scale to the highest player, so if there's anyone higher than you in the area you'll get wrecked a lot. 
---
I ended up out of ammo, and with broken weapons and armor a few times before I realised it was best to just leave and come back later. 
---
I'm curious does it count as explosive? Also is it ballistic, energy or radioactive? 
---
You sir. So many words for your stupidity lol
---
XD
---
It could, but no promises. It's likelier based on what they said that near the end of the month we will get information about what the next big content drop (probably early feb in that case) will be
---
I got that yesterday for fighting the sbq, plus a 1 star wood leg. #TrulyBlessed
---
Thanks for the replies everyone.  Will give it a go 
---
I just use my ultracite armor with rad-x diluted (to keep my mutations) and then use radaway every so often. 
---
Five seconds on Wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword
---
I can be on during the nights (I live in Cali, PST time zone) and during the weekends I play almost all day, although I AM level 46
---
Both actually
---
they had to OK the final design. it's their ip, after all. the rum company was just borrowing it.
---
Oh. You mean Bethesda should have said 
---
"Wait a second!. This isn't the custom glass bottle that you in no way promised or said it would be! Our fans, who will buy an 80 dollar bottle of liquor for the glass bottle, which again they just assumed would be custom, and still forked out the money, despite never being told there would be a custom molded bottle, from a company who has yet to produce non standard custom molded bottles are going to be pissed"
---
I've noticed the CND bar doesn't even work sometimes. Some days I can play for an hour or two, and have no drop in the bar, then all of the sudden it's at 10%
---
1) good ambience 
---
2) near water 
---
3 low chance of being blitzed by enemies 
---
4) secluded 
---
My personal favourite spot to set up camp is the lake below lake Eloise. 
---
I came across a kitchen where on one side a teddy bear is sitting at the kitchen island holding a knife with a cutting board in front of him and on the other side is a camera on a tripod with a chair behind it and another teddy bear wearing a bandana like a scarf, sun glasses, and a newsboy cap on sitting in the chair, and another teddy bear off in another chair holding a clipboard. 
---
It made me laugh.
---
Hey All,
---
I just wanted to say that my initial convo w/ the Beth Staff was less than stellar and I unfortunately ran out of a patience to follow up after my ticket was cancelled on their end.... I kind of wrote it off. 
---
**Please see this message I received today in my email from Bethesda** 
---
 *Greetings,*  
---
 
---
*Thank you for your interest in receiving a Power Armor Edition Canvas  Bag replacement.

---
*Once we have confirmed the ATOMS are in your account, you will receive another confirmation email.*  
---
*Thank you for your patience.*  
---
*Regards,*  
---
 *Bethesda Support* 
---
I was honestly not expecting this and I want to extend my thanks to all on this reddit for your support, as well as Bethesda and the community managers here for re-evaluating my original purchase claim for the bag.  This was a pleasant surprise and honestly, a great start to 2019 for me personally. 
---
Hoping all other users are able to get a similar resolution for valid claims.  :)  Cheers!
---
Drop a bunch of your useless holotapes, or put them in your stash. If you have too many in your inventory it can cause this issue.
---
Hazmat suits protect against waterbourne and airborne diseases
---
There is a problem in the game when you are carrying too many holotapes the game doesn’t register the bottom few on the list on the terminal drop a few holotapes load the master then you can pick up the ones you dropped
---
You better make sure that screen door shuts.
---
are you seriously defending Bethesda after everything that's happened? wow.
---
the canvas bag alone is proof they acted in bad faith. companies get screwed over for much less deceitful advertising.
---
&gt;Because, if hungy law firms haven't jumped on the lawsuit train...
---
do you even know costly a lawsuit this big would be? it's not something you do willy-nilly. 
---
Does it really matter? Disease Cure is pretty easy to get and most diseases aren't super detrimental anyway.
---
Now kiss
---
I forgot you poor guys on console don't have this. It's an absolute necessity, this mod has spoiled me and just the thought of having to swap out perks every time I want to use a different weapon or pick a lock is disgusting. This should be near the top of the priorities list, and if one modder managed to do it within a few weeks of the game coming out, surely it wouldn't be too much trouble for bethesda to officially make
---
Anytime I find an activity that requires me to wear a uniform it's a woman's uniform besides being in the military
---
Dogs are the most broken enemy in the game. 
---
The other day, I had to switch servers because dogs spawned inside my camp when I travelled there. The walls appeared and killed them, and their bodies stretched all around the camp. 
---
But they didn’t stop moving. 
---
Constant fleshy whacking sounds as their tendrils caressed my house. 
---
Terrifying. 
---
I’ve seen a dog stretch over a mountain. 
---
Natural resistance in the endurance perk tree
---
The prize bot spawns random after you listen to the holo tape in the farm that's west of the ice cream place.
---
I wouldn’t cheat on you baby lol
---
Maybe it is a ripoff.
---
do you really wanna waste a disease cure on something so minuscule so often 
---
and actually, this last time i lost all my junk.  wonderful
---
Damn, I'm going to test this right now, this could kill me at lvl 114 as it takes a lot of effort to move up just 1 level now. If I'm losing even a 10% level progression from logging out I'll put this game away until it's in a patch note its fixed.
---
COMING IN HOT!
---
yeah. it's common sense, really.
---
you'd have to be fresh out of grad with absolutely no knowledge of gaming at all in order to look at that mess and go "yeah, this looks OK". and I'm sure Bethesda can afford better professionals.
---
hell, you'd have to be high on top of that. there's no justification, at all.
---
I really wanna play as a ghoul.
---
He's waiting for you to figure it out.
---
*Bless us, Queen, for the meal we are about to receive...*
---
❤
---
i had the same thing with my hunting rifle a while back.
---
i'd have like 500/50 so never had to reload very odd glitch but welcome at low lvl when i didnt have much weaponry.
---
You can't go down endlessly. I've definitely hit limits building down from the peak of a cliff.
---
Up to the craft part about 70 levels ago. Stuck on the build part. 
---
Yup I've been seeing dupes reach the Reddit Marketplace a while ago. There's still lots of people unaware of what's Happening. Im well aware of how bad it's got. if your on xbox and go to the "looking for group" people are selling dupes super cheap. Lowest I've seen TSE for was 500c, and if you don't hop on a God tier gun for that Cheap you're at a disadvantage as everyone has one. It's really messed up the economy and one thing I enjoyed about fallout 76 was the whole Traders aspect of the game as I enjoyed trading with players in Warframe and was enjoying it in this game I even traded with you at one point. Now you can't sell anyting that's not god tier or endgame unless the person is ignorant. As for banning I don't think they should ban all dupers as usually a good majority of players try exploits and stop when its patched. But  people with ridiculous amount of carry weight should have inventory wipes and all the people who continued to dupe after patch and patch should be banned. I'm pretty sure it's not hard to track somebody who keeps disconnecting as I pretty sure they have a log. And there should be no goddamn Mercy to the people selling dupes on eBay. I'm glad you made this post as duping is gotten so out of hand.
---
FWIW, like most people, I've had the best luck with handmade plans in Harper's with characters below lvl 20. Found it twice now. I've seen lever gun plans but I don't remember where, probably also in Harper's but at high levels.
---
I just want to have a chance to learn a placeable decoration version of the teddy bears by scrapping bears.
---
Another suggestion: Turrets will target them and hit them occassionally. It will kill them eventually, albeit not quickly, but it will die.
---
From my perusal of the data, im seeing that the first vault will be opening sometime mid Feb (thats just based on some event spotlight weekly values I spotted, could change) and prior to that will be the new PVP mode.
---
Every time my best friend shows up, my internet goes out. It’s the worst.

---
You've got that backwards. 
---
Ultracite has superior ballistic resistance. 
---
X-01 has superior energy and rad resistance. 
---
X-01 is better for fighting scorchbeasts. 
---
Let me walk yout through this. Without decent gameplay all you're left with is the cutscenes. You're a special type of moron if you're not understanding that. Thus making it a "movie" that as I said before "that you play". Obviously I never called it an actual movie you fucking moron. Are you fucking serious? You're arguments make literally no sense. Come back when you find a brain.
---
I usually just tough most diseases.
---
No stimpaks were harmed in the making of this video. Also, I didn't have the correct 2 hand melee perks active so I wasn't hitting near full potential.
---
Nope. Never even put a set of PA on 
---
Cliff Racers dont tend to eat an entire armory of weapons for breakfast before they go down.
---
That's good to know
---
no you literally can't get legendary weapons from them
---
so I had a group of lvl 135 or higher attack my camp and completely destroyed everything and they received no punishment what so ever and were already wanted but they were so high lvl and so many of them that no one can stop them please bethesda fix this
---
that was awesome dude, bravo!
---
Got mine out of the treasure hunts, try "patrol duty" near Grafton
---
I always unlock chests etc in F76. Got some cool rare plans and other rare items. Bit different to fallout of past though.
---
that's just lazy on Bethesda's part then
---
I’ve seen a group with duped two shot fat men take several minutes to kill her. This group took seconds
---
Seeing as how weapon scrapping gets you everything you little of what you need (moar steel) since its in full supply from every other thing ; and barely any of what you actually need to repair a weapon, I'd call that lame and respectfully disagree.
---
What kinda headaches have you experienced with your shotgun build? My junkie/crit shotgun build is easily the most OP build I've ever created
---
Love this
---
It's about 2.5 flights up,  wil find pics
---
The flares are to signal for help lol
---
You can build as far down from where you place your camp module as you can up. 
---
Like the ideas. I have simple fix to the legendary dupe effect. Make those tse traits exclusively not available together. You either get explosion or two shot. Not both. To correct the effect, have the trait re-rolled. They did this is in the division with OP builds. Agreed on the nerf to explosion splash and damage. Make me earn my kill, not one shot people.

&gt; Super mutants don’t even have half a brain

Ah the old it's impossible to care about more than one thing at once fallacy. Classic.

There’s one near Charleston junkyard on the road leading to the Nuka Cola plant.

*Pump up the volume*
---
I know that water purifier in your stored tab shouldn't take 100% of the budget but have you tried scrapping that and then moving your camp to a new location? 
---
Just yes...

Sounds doable, but why aren't you wearing power armor? Everyone is supposed to be wearing power armor...
---
Is it your camp or a workshop in the pictures?
---
Amen
---
Me too man, ever since fallout 3 I wanted to have a option to become ghoulified, I'd be happy if it was even just astectic with no perks just for the role playing possibilities.
---
X01 definitely covers you as far as rads go lol
---
Radx, Diluted Radx, and Radshield all stack, and there's a couple food items like glowing mushroom soup that provide some benefit as well. With RadX and Diluted active I can keep my rads in the 1.5/second range, and just pop a RadAway every now and then.
---
That said, I have Level 3 Rad Sponge and try to find someone to share it with, which pretty much eliminates the need for drugs.
---
Its my camp in the picture
---
On PC open pipboy and right click weaponnor armor
---
I'm not sure if sonics actually gets blocked when it's already shot but I find a Large Tent (not CAMP) very effective against Scorchbeast because they have no line of sight and they stop their sonic attacks (they change strats to strafing run which goes through or drop down). A bus is also good for the same purpose jus slightly not as effective at breaking LoS (probably because of the windows).
---
This has happened with just about every game last year at some point, besides RDR2. Spider-Man, BO4, and Battlefield 5 are all cheaper than they were at launch 
---
Actually I am on PC. Kinda forgot about mods but also don't want to get the random banhammer because of it. I remember now that that specific one exists, glad it was made, but yeah it ought to be official.
---
Thats my strategy right now with the RadAway, hoping for something better.
---
Same bug
---
pipeboy shows junk but when i go to scrap it its empty and i cant scrap anything
---
For whatever reason I am unable to scrap the water purifier 
---
Yes I find that too I tried a 3 story with a raised roof and kept clipping out and dissapearing 
---
Have you purchased any Atoms? If not stop asking and if you did buy more.
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9vo50b/updated_power_armor_stats_all_sets/#ampf=undefined
---
As stated several times 600 isn't an okay stash limit, needs to be at least 1000.
---
Yeah, but the metal armor paint is still 800 :/
---
Also, this is the same skin that the minigun inside the hornwright mansion has. It turned into a normal minigun when you picked it up but it clearly had a shiny black exterior on the shelf, which is now clearly the chrome paint. I don't know if they ever removed this, I mentioned this once like a month ago and since then haven't seen any mention of it
---
&gt; this is a PVE game ... if the player chooses easy mode , how does it really effect anyone else? Just wondering?
---
They are planning a PVP mode. It will very much affect everyone
---
I just don't like it tbh. It feels too tank-y and the landing animation when you jump from too high is annoying. I know you can cancel that, but still. And it just takes that much more scrap to maintain. It's just easier to pop it on when I'm planning on doing a nuke zone, which isn't very often.
---
I just use my skullcandy uproar. Nice and cheap, good sound quality, good enough mic that I use it to take meetings for work with. 
---
I recently moved my camp to the same spot i was in due to a bug where it would not place it regardless of server swapping. Problem was i lost about 70% of my base because of this.
---
Point is there is alot of bugs around the camp system that need to be correct including the wire bug. The only thing you can do is wait now for it to be correct after reporting it.
---
It sucks but seems like you have done everything you can to correct it.
---
I didnt look at it like that. More like if I get x item it will make x play 10x easier and more enjoyable. Nothing to do with worth but I agree there are those out there who fit this bill.
---
I dont need anyone to help me taking the Scorch beast queen out by myself. (And I await the callouts that im BSing haha).
---
Mass effect much
---
That might be the culprit. Can you move next to water then place it in the world then scrap it?
---
Junk for me, my regular stash would probably end up empty tbh
---
shielded raider lining plans drop from "one violent night" too, got mine the other day.
---
Here here
---
I sent you a request accept it when you can
---
Well yes, but the style like it was in Fallout 1-3
---
Sorry I’m on PS4. 
---
Give it to a friend.
---
Okay, so any game with poor gameplay is a movie. Got it. Superman 64 is a movie, makes sense. Sure sounds like you’re using a buzzword to me my friend but good job on moving the goalposts and pulling out every ad hom attack in the process. You just come across as incredibly bitter and salty and that’s all I wanted to point out, no one thinks you’re intelligent for calling a critically acclaimed game a “movie”. 
---
With someone you trust, or the risky way of dumping it into a container in a world you can join back into.
---
Just put it on before you quit.  Saving in whitesprings without hazmat or power armor is a death sentence. 
---
I only have to repair my armor like, once a week. Are you standing still and taking damage or something? 
---
I like the Blue stuff. Snowball Ice is around that price range, though I'd lean more towards a second hand Blue Yeti if you can find one in your price rance.
---
i made mine overlooking The Dam and surrounding empty lake..
---
Also built there as it far up the hill good overlook and good place far enough from hustle and bustle.
---
If people are wandering to Whitesrpings they will come across me so is great peaceful spot.
---
For the love of all that is good I wish they would stop spamming the same attack from the air every second... there is no stop to it... 
---
We need announcements for the announcement's announcement now.
---
So instead of just using a similar weapon with similar parts and function to repair the condition of your weapon, you'll just scrap that weapon to make steel and a penny and go rummaging through homes and airports looking for the other components that mysteriously disappear into thin air when you scrapped the weapon. The one weapon to repair (increase) the condition of other weapons made finding a similar weapon eternally useful. Now once you stop getting mods for weapons theres no point in even picking them up. I respectfully disagree, and feel bethesda did it the way they did to increase the grind. Instant MMO.  
---
I found inside a house somewhere a group of teddy bears filming a cooking show. I took a snapshot. I'll see if I can find it when I go home.
---
Working on it with the fam, might wait for a patch to fix all the bugs first.
---
He’s an exception
---
Appreciate your comment. But If you want pvp play fortnite.... this isn’t pvp by any stretch of the imagination.... unless they rebalance all weapons and armor to be the same level so that there is only a “skill” gap. 
---
I needed to Google that big word. Learn something new every day. Thanks.
---
Okay, that my friend is too far. For all we know there could be a huge number of the population with duped stuff.
---
I think it’s just one per piece of armour 
---
Ultracite Power Armor (Level 50)
---
453 DR (+60 from chassis = 513)
---
393 ER (+60 from chassis = 453)
---
393 RR
---
Prototype X-01 Power Armor (Level 50)
---
398 DR (+60 from chassis = 458)
---
453 ER (+60 from chassis = 513)
---
453 RR
---
Unless i'm missing something, my statement still stands. With better energy and rad resistance, X-01 is superior at fighting scorchbeasts?
---
Do you have anything in blueprints?
---
I will add ya when i am back on Saturday. :)
---
My base is a tad broken atm because of a nasty bug that made me lose about 70% of it. So i am currently working on fixing that again. It even caused me to lose my rad shower so that means i gotta flux farm again.
---
But yeah i have most mods and can make almost all things in the game. So i should be able to deck ya out very nicely. Our group uses my base area alot as they help others as well. So should always be someone around.
---
Yep, totally agree. Lost a set of power armour fighting 3 that all happened to spawn near my C.A.M.P. I have pretty garbage weapons and the only people around to help were &lt; level 15. Not worth it at all. 
---
Probably because not many know, thanks for the photos. I found this thread by googling the challenge.
---
I have 4 of 5 cataloged below.
---

Alvon, Lansing, Spruce Knob and Canaan
---
Still looking for the coal train Depot location if anyone comes across it and can share.
---
Be more selective with your partners and have a no-butt-stuff policy?
---
I gameshare with my wife's xbox she doesn't play fallout so I use her character as a mule
---
There is a PvP mode coming soon, whether or not you think it's needed. 
---
Haha that’s totally gonna be me with my boyfriend when he finally picks up a copy for himself 
---
What's fucked is anthem is a destiny ripoff. It's like they forgot destiny was a shitty mass effect ripoff (as far as aesthetic and lore and space magic anyway)
---
Well at least there would be developers at that point
---
Don't. Play the game as intended. Don't exploit the game just because you can.
---
I take a bunch of damage when I'm at fissure prime nuke zone. And sometimes I go into whitespring nuke zones, but I take a lot less damage there.
---
My leg pieces break like every other time I go to fissure prime. But I'm not spec'd into power armor at all, so that has a lot to do with it. Idk, just not really my play style.
---
How do you know exactly what that sounds like? 
---
Omfg I literally just fucking told you that it obviously is not a movie you fucking moron. How fucking stupid are you to come back respond like that. Really? How fucking stupid do you have to be. You haven't used ad hominem in any of your comments??? Lolololol try harder moron. Don't bother responding, you are clearly either a troll or mentally handicapped. You come across very dumb and salty that someone doesn't like the same game as you. Get the fuck over it you fucking baby. Jesus.
---
You said it, man.
---
They told us a month ago that the next update is coming in the middle of january....what exactly were you expecting?
---
Harpers Ferry jas it semi often.
---
If your on pc and don't want to drop the cash for a mic. I would reccomend the text chat mod its one of the most downloaded on nexus. Unreal community on there as well. Including a trade channel , party , global and a clan chat for setting up clans among friends.
---
Meh. The interface for that would be tedious at best, especially on consoles.
---
This is both hilarious and helpful -- I usually use the last recommendation but will try the others.
---
Sounds like that's what I'll have to do 
---
Just tried placing the water purifier in water and I was unable too for whatever reason.
---
Or just like, when they continue fixing the game like they’ve been doing over the last 3 months?
---
Not true. RDR2 at most dropped like $15 (only on Black Friday) and has since then stayed at $60.
---
This dude is out of his element.
---
I feel like dragons landed way more, I take these dudes out fast with my sniper but on a melee build I just keep running or log out :/
---
Yep you can plop them down in mud sludge flatland or water....OR you can snap them to foundations but when putting the foundation you can’t put a full wall.
---
But now that I know half walls work I’m making an open air box perimeter 
---
I currently do not have any stored blueprints
---
ok
---
It actually does. It might be like "10% Chance your AP bar will refill completely after depleting it" Might go up to 30%
---
I wanna play as a Glowing boi
---
Would love to just wobble around with my pus-filled sacs on the verge of bursting all over my victims longcoat.
---
THICC
---
Depends on your console or pc 
---
Also depends on if your want wireless or wired 
---
I know you said 80 but my personal favorite would be some Astro 20s  they around 120 you can find them cheaper sometimes but they are a great overall if your not looking to spend much 
---
You can get some arctic 5s full name steel series attic 5 gaming headset 
---
Turtle beach is a good overrall headset 
---
I know Logitech and hyperXcloud make decent headsets
---
Try to get your headset from somewhere you can return it if it doesn’t work out for you 
---
upvote this so it gets on the front page
---
and get me a chrome .50 cal goddamn it
---
Except for the fact that mules aren't even exploiting the game, and people wouldn't have to use mules if they would finally fix the carry weight for players.
---
I started Bulking everything that bulks just so it is easier (for me at least) to pull out a bulk if I have to much.
---
So the computer at Garrahan Mining HQ in the workshop looking area not the office area won't teach you the plans when you click excavator blueprints or something of that sort (sorry at work can't check exact option, but it should be the top one).
---
\+1 for grafton station vendor
---
Not sure i would consider muling an exploit. Having alts is a great way to store resources, caps and items. 
---
What the dupers do now thats an exploit and one i truly depise.
---
My point is this ... I’ve watched YouTube videos that some guys have builts that allow a fire axe to do 9k dmg ..... like in what world. In order to have “fair” pvp , which is the main complaint of TSE that it’s unfair, all weapons and armor need rebalance. At the end of the day though even in its current state, it’s really low risk pvp anyway... like if u have no junk on you, what would you loose? Unwanted encounters? Server hop and move on
---
To you, a lot of people find it funny. To each their own though.
---
I've had a few events (like the swarm of suitors events) where you can't fast travel to the event but if you run there, you'll see a few minutes left on the clock but the trigger event (at least one player gets to the island) won't work. 
---
Ouch. I didnt get lucky either. I ended up buying 4 of the 5 i have. 
---
Get them from players. They can get as cheap as 500 caps each. 
---
Once you try this let me know. Another thing you could try is by making an entirely new character. You could move your camp, then delete the entire blueprint. 
---
Lol, I had to deal with that (the grunting - not the anal buggery) during a WS nuke run.  Didn't want to exit and re-enter because I knew the nuke zone would be gone, but finally gave up and left.  It was too damn irritating.
---
same except, one kept glitching threw the cave walls spamming me while I had to fight another which I assume was suppose to be there. As  dozen or so scorched kept respawing every 3-5 mins to fight me.
---
I play a female character.. but sometimes emit a clearly male grunt over and over... either that or im being buttfucked by an invisible survivor
---
atom store limited time 
---
You sure it's not the Blackbird paint? Black with red details?
---
O for god sakes now you have given me more ideas.......
---
Darn you OP and your amazing base!.
---
And please make sure we can remap any and all controls to our liking on pc. Please. Currently as an ESDF player the buildmode is near unusable as the F key is turn object for some reason. Totally redundant as these functions are already on your mouse buttons.
---
there's nothing inherently wrong with mules. most always-online games have stashes, except for gacha shit.
---
which makes me wonder why Fo76 doesn't have one.
---
We are the playtesters
---
It just works.  Same happend to me but I had items stored scrapped everything 
---
Nope. Says they are on an external device and to check it. I went thru all my notes and tapes and nothing. 
---
They cant reproduce either ... could be an improvement for some!
---
Do you know the plans or did someone place it for you originally? 
---
Level 139 found one at Grafton and two at Lewisburg 
---
i bought the game on a website for $49 AUD on release. now its $18 AUD
---
This is why we need more build space and limits my god i love building in this game. I wish we could he neighbours with others and build almost settlements with one another.
---
Strong already has a lot of that.
---
There are two mod slots on each power armor piece: mod and paint. Helmets also have a third slot for headlamps. So you could use the bright headlamp with either the recon sensor or targeting hud, but not both, but you can also put any paint you have unlocked on it
---
It would have been nice if they'd given beta-buyers some kind of atom compensation, but we can't expect it.
---
All we can do it remember it when they release their next game.
---
I couldn't find it any less than $60 black friday and looked everywhere.
---
anyone who claims they were banned for using a mod is lying, it's that simple. all Bethesda "not supporting" mods means is if you break your game with a mod, they're not obligated to help you fix it. Reshade and CheatEngine (what people were actually banned for using) aren't mods, but nobody banned for using cheats is ever going to admit they were cheating, and mods are a convenient scapegoat
---
Idk why people downvote anything have to do with camps so hardcore but thank you I guess.
---
&gt;Later this month, we are providing resolutions by way of new patches for Fallout 76. Like our December 11 update, we will have a big update that will address many of the issues you’ve been providing feedback on. Full patch notes will follow soon.
---
&gt;We’re also building an incredible list of future updates that we can’t wait to share, including new quests, weekly in-game events, new Vaults opening, a new PvP mode, Player Vending and much more.
---
&gt;2019 is an exciting year for Fallout 76 and we can’t wait to grow it with you. Keep providing your feedback and letting us know what you’d like to see.
---
What the fuck does *any* of this mean? Fixing which issues? Does this include balance? Will the game stop crashing? Are the Atom store items going to stop being stupid jokes? Is there ever going to be an endgame? Are nukes going to matter? Will the Queen matter? New vaults? We can't even use the old one. When is "soon?" Is player vending going to be affected by duping? Is the PvP mode going include 1-shot TSEs? "Much more?" Is this just a hype train trying not to blow its load early? Who's running this operation? Is this game even a long-term asset?
---
Writing's on the wall.
---
Thanks so much! I didn’t want to lose the headlamp
---
I can't go without my excavator armor, how does anyone have less than 200lbs in their inventory at any point? lol
---
I dont even bother curing diseases
---
If it really bothers you just drink from the fountain at Whitesprings, it cures diseases apparently
---
Only 3* weapon I have I got from a random whitesprings ghoul and it’s an assault rifle that ignores 50% armour, does 50% more limb damage and gives 250 damage resistance when you reload. I use it with a hardened reciever because I don’t like automatic weapons and my perks are set up to compliment that but it’s really not very good and it makes me sad 
---
I know it's never ending. This is build number 49. 50 coming up soon!
---
Synth would be neat but outside of lore.
---
I...I do alright, lvl 39 poking Super Mutants in the eyes!
---
I’m open to purchasing one of those
---
Yep, I do know the plans. Its a little odd isnt?
---
Have you tried relogging since the issue has occured?
---
Yes im sure i saw the Enclave logo on the chest and the stars on the shoulders
---
I said the results were a mixed bag. It works for some people, and doesn't for others. By all means it's worth a shot, but it's never helped for me, so don't expect it to really do much.
---
yes excitement of discovering for the first time 
---
I did it already and now with second characters 
---
can not pretend to not know where is what 
---
it's only unknown when will RNG gaming reward you for playing that slot machine
---
Melee weapons and weapons you already have a lot of mods for won't unlock a new mod every time they're scrapped. Some melee weapons do seem to not have any mods, though.
---
I hope you die soon because you have serious mental issues. People are not safe around you. Did you sacrifice cats as a child while wearing black lipstick by any chance? You sick fuck.
---
Well-well look. I already told you: I deal with the god damn customers so the engineers don't have to. I have people skills; I am good at dealing with people. Can't you understand that? What the hell is wrong with you people?
---
I'm still gathering springs for my x-01 legs. Why is there such a spring shortage!?
---
You’re the one over the line. 
---
I picked up a quad double barrel shotgun the fire rate is Insane. 
---
Your sure? I cant find any info about this paint job not on youtube or google like it doesnt exist
---
They were finally goaded into communicating about a couple things because they literally did something illegal and then made a half hearted apology and the public outrage reached critical mass. Let’s not act like the communication they finally did have was some positive thing. 
---
Rust is pretty good too, easily clocked 500 hours and that was half a year ago so there’s a ton more content, I just need to get back into it.
---
Have you tried relogging since this issue has occurred? Sorry if you have just trying to think of every little thing to help.
---
Wait, Divinity 2 Ego Draconis ran on a gamebryo-based engine? No wonder it was so is janky.
---
Spoiler alert: You do the exact same thing in FO76
---
Yep break and rebuild to see what else is possible. I hope one of the updates is focused building. You know what would be really great.
---
Clans brought into the game with an instance build area. My god the fun you could have setting up towns for the clan.
---
I have perks that require no power armor and I try to stay around 200. I drink to much booze and chems in this game tho plus all those glowing meats weigh a lot
---
Probably a lot harder to implement with the differences in this game (multiplayer, no pausing, etc..).  But I never got into using the app in 4, so I'm not sure how prohibitive it'd be here.
---
Vats not ending when you run out of AP would actually be a pain with full-auto in a lot of cases, because your gun would stop shooting instead of just continuing to unload into your target. Even worse if your gun has a spin-up (gatling plasma/laser, chainsaw, Ripper, etc.)
---
O screw them man its probably lurkers who hate the game and downvote all fun posts.
---
Gas masks prevent diseases
---
There was a post discussing this. The build zone is a sphere not a cylinder based on where you put the CAMP. If you could set it on a shelf you could go lower down the cliff.
---
Omg I haven’t literally laughed out loud while reading a post in a while. Thanks 🙏 
---
I will just say this, my favorite enemy is the freaking hermit crab.  It came out of nowhere the first time I encountered it; I did not expect it, and it kicked my ass.  Also, made me jump like the mothman did.  Rewards are not that great, but I love it.  Scorchbeasts, I hate them, but I also love how freaking annoying they are and frustrating to get them to land.  As for rewards, I don't care, I just kill anything that moves.  I kill every squirrel that runs across my path.  I think the developer did a good job with respect to the scorchbeast, got you to come online and vent; so they are not all that bad for an enemy.
---
free = caps for replacing base location?
---
:thinking: 
---
I have the infinite ammo one right now that is fucking insane.  (it is a bug though) 
---
This is near the top of my wish list - I swap around perks so much.
---
I agree pvp is really meaningless, can’t lose much, can get griefed for caps, I personally want a much better pvp system, tune in I’ll talk about it in another post! 
---
At Lady Janet's Soft Serve, there's one having a cookout, complete with hotdogs and beer at one of the grills.
---
Dude take a deep breath and reread our conversation and objectively look at the statement you just made, or come back at a later time and do it when you’ve calmed down and I think you’ll see it in a different light. You sound literally just as booty blasted as the OP of this thread is and he reached astronomical levels of butthurt, and here you are ready to take that achievement away from him. Have a good night. 
---
Oh, I seen people at level 289 and maybe higher, with insane DPS.  I believe it
---
Players can
---
You can buy a whole recipe from other players for between 1-4k caps
---
They drop off the queen
---
I understand. I guess my full stash frequency is much further apart because I only pick up essential junk that I have tagged to gather. 
---
Sorry just trying to go through everything I can think of. What is the error message that displays when trying to put into the water (no budget, item is floating, etc.)
---
They may attack teammates but do no damage, they only attack rando's if rando's attack them which can lead to you coming home to either a loot bag as your turrets turned on the rando or a dead pet. Depending on if things glitched or not. 
---
Yup. Every level you'll be able to move one point. After 50 of course. 
---
you can hardly see them from a few hundred meters away if you're not in a really flat area like the Toxic Valley or Cranberry Bog. They should buff their height.
---
There is a building by robco that actually was in control of the experiments that made the super mutants 
---
I've had a floating platform I couldn't remove because it would prevent accessibility. Accessibility to what? The sky?
---
It was the last piece I needed to remove. My foundations and stairs had already been removed.
---
That's a new one I haven't heard of
---
If only this game had more nice outfits, a lot of them seem really low res, and bulky. Sniper outfit is really nice though, and goes well with a Lever Action Rifle.
---
I had this happen Monday, delete/scrap everything stored in your C.A.M.P. and then relog. Fixed it. Somehow everything in my camp duplicated and I was like 200% over my budget.
---
The worst part is that they can spam their sonic attack when running away as if the sonic comes from their ass. How you gonna sonic screech when your facing away from me? Also why the hell wont you land! I can kill them in about 8 seconds but i use melee so i need them to land. But of course they won't land. 
---
You literally come back claiming each time that I'm calling it a literal movie when I've made it clear that I never was. I'm not the one that needs to go back and re-read. I don't know why you're so butthurt about me not liking rdr2. Who fucking cares dude. Grow up.
---
It should be one of two things.
---
 STASH as a standard has the effect of all max rank perk cards that effect weight. (Iffy on this, as bandolier makes some ammo types completely weightless; so maybe have those ammos cap at an amount). All items in inventory weigh as normal, or effected by whichever perk cards are active.
---
Or, as you invest in perks that reduce weight, your STASH is passively effected by the purchased card. Meaning your STASH is thenceforth effected whether the perk is equipped or not.
---
There is no Cavaliers you can either have blocking 15% or sprinting 15% but not both. 
---
Not as many turret/bot spawns solo!?!  I don't wanna see the mess doing this with a team then - I was swarmed.
---
HyperX Cloud Core. 70 bucks, universal, great quality. 
---
Team Mayhue. Let's go. Level 115 though.
---
Happen to me twice. I guess just put on suit if you are logging out at whitespring. That is the only place that gets nuked anyway
---
No error when trying to place it, its almost like its not stored.
---
Black and gold?
---
Yeah the fallout 76 community is great but tbh the players that dropped the weapons were probably glad to be rid of them do to the lack of stash box space
---
Who hurt you bud?
---
If you learned it, you can't read it again. Go to a fallout market subreddit and sell it, it's decently valuable. 
---
Lol
---
According to the upvote to down vote ratio in this conversation, people seem to disagree with that sentiment.
---
No it was rly dark grey with white enclave logo on it
---
I'd like this to be a feature. when i saw there were multiple containers in the stash tab, i thought that's how it would work. obviously that's not how it works. also the fact that you can lock your door is basically pointless without this feature. why even lock your door? lol there's nothing to steal, and if they wanna destroy your base a locked door won't stop them 
---
What’s the player oven?
---
He must be trying to be ironic
---
My explosive flamer agrees.
---
It don't think it would be. It could be made rather simple. Visually, component view would look pretty the same as it does in the player inventory with the difference being it'd display the current limit for each item too. Eg:
---
Acid 80/100
---
Aluminum 120/150
---
Asbestos 50/50
---
Any of the unused buttons on that screen could be used to switch between item select and limit select. If I remember correctly X on Xbox isn't used for anything on that screen.
---
Fix? The carry weight is the same that other fallouts were. I have a character on 3 with 10 strength carry weight 200ish and on 76 I have 7 strength and its only a few off 
---
Theyre non explosive. Only the LAR is, but that stays with me always as its 90% reduced weight. 
---
Hm, not sure, but if is enclave my best guess would be rng reward from doing enclave events 
---
what a god
---
Lol fallout fanboy losers suck  i hope next one is good but you fanboys need to learn dont defend bad rproducts

The Cavaliers will reduce 15% while sprinting. I have one piece with assassins.
---
Homophobic much
---
Here's the trick I've found with my Gatling gun, start shooting in non-aiming mode, when you are making hits, hit the aim button and you'll have them until you start missing a lot or stop firing for a period of time. 
---
Maybe thats a good point🤔
---
Yeah.. I just about lost it when that first mr handy called me "mr f@#ker". Good times

Exactly, that first month the market was so fun!!! I remember I had heard rumor of explosive shotguns, I was like level 50, and I made this huge elaborate line of trades to be able to get a two shot combat rifle, in order to trade it for this guys lvl 35 junkies explosive shotgun, I was hot shit with my friends for like a week, and then bam I started seeing TSE’s popping up, and knew it was all over..... i loved trading, I posted sometimes multiple times a day, and was doing easily 20-30 trades a day, that whole aspect is ruined for me, now I build bases for income instead... 
---
I definitely agree anyone selling weapons for real money is breaking not only the rules, but I think the law, and that’s a problem for bethesda for sure 
---
.... say the guy whining on the sub .... pot meet kettle. 
---
Tried logging and a few hops. Nothing. Tried the power armor station and white springs and wont let me craft there either. 
---
I may try grabbing my ultricite and sticking it in a station to see if that works 
---
Explain?
---
Mass Effect 3, FF XV, Dragon Age 2
---
I'm pretty sure you're suffering from the artificial sensation that this is good value due to the previous ridiculous prices.  $4 for a low-effort reskin of the identical minigun model but chrome is still hardly a great deal.
---
I have no experience with the radium rifle, Combat Rifle is great both as a semi-automatic weapon and automatic (would even go so far as to say better than the handmade if not for the small magazine), and the submachine gun is just ridiculous to control the recoil of a two shot unless you're using VATS, so I would say go with the combat. and ALWAYS aim, don't hip fire, you'll see the shots hit much closer together
---
Understand what's happening.
---
1. Your character has a set inventory/stash space limit. 
---
2. You're using a mechanism not available in-game to use more space via "mule" characters, otherwise you could just transfer items between characters.
---
Of course it's an exploit. Otherwise, it'd be an intended feature.
---
This and duping are both exploiting. Pointing out one as truly one to despise (which it is), doesn't make the other any less exploiting.
---
They are just random I farmed the golf course for like 20 levels and have only seen one dragon
---
Any plan you can read will become a permanent option for you, provided you have the associated perk card at the necessary rank. 
---
If you can't read a plan, it's because you already know it.
---
Why does everyone keep saying this? 
---
I can kill a Scorchbeast in under 1 minute [without a legendary gun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWxnG3s1wAs&amp;t=100)

I'm on the lake just north of watoga and by the time I got into the nuke zone it was over 
---
What about blueprints?
---
Something funny 
---
Combat rifle auto or non?
---
Are you saying the Radium Rifle is effective against SB?
---
Hilariois in a good way or bad?
---
I really dont get into PvP to be honest. Also PS4
---
It is by the very virtue that if it wasn't you'd be able to transfer items between characters in-game.
---
Player ovens eh? Your ideas interest me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter
---
Is this intentionally ironic?
---
I've had 3 spawn on me while doing AWOL Armaments Event. Fuck that noise. Instant server change.
---
What a pointless post.
---
Items like mods and plans should also have descriptions as to what they do. How is a casual player supposed to know what an Internal Database does when you add it to your PA? 
---
You could hotkey a hazmat suit (might have to favorite from inventory, since I don't see armor listed when I try to favorite from the favorites menu). I should probably do that.
---
I try to deposit my junk before logging out, pulling other things out of my stash if it's already full.
---
If it's ever nuked while you're still logged in, or you just want a shortcut, the bunker has hotel exit to enter the whitespring and get to your stash without ever stepping outside.
---
Cool. They've never said weekly patches at any point.
---
Player Oven thread deserves another gold just for triggering this snowflake.
---
Challenges are broken
---
I thought it was funny. Sue me
---
You prob saw the paint job that comes with the Tricentennial version. It's similar to the Enclave ligo but not quite 
---
So far so true
---
I meant it looks horrible for you I'd hate that. This is the reason me and my friend avoided one another in game for like 30 levels.
---
Made a post about it earlier seems other people have had the same bug, but none of us can replicate it so now I have a 2 star instagateing explosive double barrel with unlimited ammo. 
---
The fact that paint for any gun costs 4-10$ is shameful, though.
---
I think that managing your perk cards for situations is part of the game. I find it fun and makes me take my time.
---
I generally do the same, though I usually end up loads of other crap from scrapping weapons. After a few events, especially Uranium Fever, my stash is full to the brim with rubber and wood, among other things.
---
Came here to say this as well. 
---
No i saw the enclave paint job 100% sure
---
If you sign a contract (TOS) and break it, you are subject to whatever punishment is laid out in the contract, no matter what it cost you to enter into it.
---
Needs to be the opposite. You're stash has say 150-200, and your lootable stash has 500+. 
---
So great! 😂I want to see her comic 😂

I’m pointing out the fact you claimed you weren’t using a buzzword when you clearly were, that’s it. A buzzword is literally using a word in a non literal sense and stripping the technicality of it, and that’s what I said you did. And then I said you used it in a silly way that didn’t seem to coincide with your argument. That’s it, my guy. I don’t care that you don’t like a video game, I’m just pointing out that some of your logic in your earlier arguments was flawed and that you came across as salty because people don’t like a game YOU like (Fo76), and you come off as very defensive against RDR probably because people praise that game and shit on Fo76 and you’re sick of it. I don’t care that you don’t like RDR, but you seem to care a lot that people do like it. That’s just my point. 
---
Happened to me too.  I've only been able to fight the queen twice - first time it crashed on me before she died, second time it crashed right after she died and I didnt get to loot. :(.  Did get the mission rewards though thankfully - was really needing that arch.

---
isn’t every game a cash grab at this point other than minecraft 
---
Sorry was thinking FO4s Cavalier's	Reduces damage while blocking or sprinting by 15%.
---
Just needed clarity on which one it is you wanted. 
---
More often than not the water gives parasites. Either I have to use a cure or eat a lot more while it is active. 
---
I currently do not have any blueprints stored
---
Interesting. I'll have to keep my eyes peeled.
---
I am in your boat. Over 200hrs into fo76 and have thrown in the towel until they can get stability and just the basics fixed for xb1. Rdr2 though guided is a good game to play and the online can be just as humorous but lacks some content.
---
It's all about where you search. Go to Sugar Grove and you can find a ton of clipboards which will give you springs.  
---
Errr end game vats builds are only limited by AP.
---
Having it regen while in vats would be insanity.
---
There was a shout that literally forced dragons to land.  We are missing that mechanic in this game.
---
I've def gotten my money's worth out of the game. But yeah Minecraft is dope.
---
They could use some work, I agree, but I genuinely enjoy killing them, they almost feel like dragons in Skyrim. They just need a bit more HP but a way to more reliable bring them to the ground. And a better loot table of course.
---
This is why I never go to bleakfalls barrow in Skyrim.
---
AFAIK you can only craft disease cures specific to different regions. My camp is in the mire, requires mire disease cure (which I haven't found yet)
---
Wanted to thank you. This worked every time. Waited for teammate to get through and then I entered. Never had any problems. Again thanks. 
---
You have to spec in endurance and a weapon type. Most pvp is straight one hit wonders. Thats why i stoped. It's pretty boring. Honestly hope they super nerf pvp dam. So it would be an actual fight. Not just who can hit who first.
---
Do you have any?
---
Yeah, I haven't had too many bad experiences with players and I've had some other good ones. One guy gave me a 2 shot lvl45 pump action. Another stalked me in a ritual outfit and a chameleon armor piece after leaving a crazy religious rambling note in a bag on my doorstep, but never attacked. Just watched. Which was creepy and entertaining. 
---
I've bought triple A titles at full price and just loathed them.  And I've bought them months later for a pittance and loathed them too.  
---
I feel the HUNDREDS if hours I get from 76 the balance to that.  I got it for $48 via Amazon Prime, and would be happy to have paid $60.
---
I try to bulk everything but always run out of plastic first. It's one of the only materials I've never thrown away, along with screws, springs and lead.
---
YASS!!
---
I'm already bored of it just barely thinking about it.
---
I agree. The level/environmental design in fo76 is top notch in general, something that doesn't get spoken about enough since this game gets so much hate.
---
Yep, I've definitely done this. Gave a lvl 20 some mediocre legendaries I couldn't sell and he'd be able to use soon. 
---
Just need 4000 more caps...
---
I hear you. 
---
Do you scrap lots of guns?
---
Just a thought, but what perks are you thinking about running?  Are you going to try damage, or really make it hard and do all passives?
---
I don't care if you don't like Fallout 76. Since I literally have not mentioned f76 whatsoever and this entire thread is about rdr2. You are the one that came along seeing someone calling out rdr2 for what it is and getting butthurt. I haven't said anything about f76 that must mean im being very defensive of it....ok whatever you say.
---
Probably not as bored as I am of having to manually clear my stash several times a day.
---
Confirmed. Just make it dead however, then switch to the sword. As long as it's in your hand when the game decides to check whether it qualifies, you'll get the credit.
---
Anyone?
---
Someone thinks it's a good idea for it to be a feature.
---

Maybe you should stop compulsively collecting all of the junk in your path instead?

My wife used to run her own business.  She used to have people ask her for discounts.  She'd say, "Do you call Coke and ask them to discount soda?  Or do you do it at the grocery store?  The price is the price."

You don't like your price, blame your VENDOR, not the publisher.

After certain events, like Uranium Fever, yes. I only pick up the guns when I know there's a workbench nearby.

Any PR director I've worked with knows that silence when the company is under legitimate fire, unless for legal reasons, only supplies more ammunition.
---
I’ll be your companion op.
---
I can make random remarks about stuff we see
---
That list might have stuff that isn't in the game - its not 100% accurate.
---
&gt;If you ever invested the time to make yourself you don't wanna do it again. 
---
My mother says the same thing.
---
&gt; there's nothing inherently wrong with mules 
---
Evidence in the game suggests otherwise, otherwise you'd be able to do it with ease without the need of a third party.
---
Think of what you're doing. You're exploiting the inherent stash/inventory of another character for what you might consider to be your "main". That "mule" character's purpose isn't to play the game but act as additional storage. 
---
Even transferring items to another character is questionable but if that other character is ALSO going to be played, it has some purpose. In the case of a mule, it's sole purpose is extra storage.
---
Since that's not an intended purpose of that character, exploit. It's as plain as day. It's self-evidently an exploit.
---
You may not consider it as bad of an exploit as say duping, but let's at least not kid ourselves into thinking that mule characters are not exploits.
---
Own it for what it is.
---
The icon showing me i can play when i turn on my ps4 isn't bugged. Im always able to start up the game :)
---
Nice didn’t know that :D
---
I don't... I have lead, screws, springs, adhesive and plastic marked and only pick up junk containing them. Maybe you should stop making assumptions.
---
Sorry this is very wrong and i don't see the issue with alts as banks. We did the same thing in world of warcraft. Online games are well known for bank alts. 
---
Concur. Borderlands did this. 
---
I tested this one out awhile ago!
---
- plasma flamer: No.
---
- legendary weapons that normally don’t deal fire damage: What? If you mean weapons like Perfect Storm that proc burn effects: No.
---
- scale with weapon damage: Kinda. You can see this when using it with a Shishkebab and it does heal but hardly any per hit, it’s super slow this way. Then if you use a flamer, it’s better. I think it scales better with perk ranks than anything else, and rate of fire. 
---
- also doesn’t work with chainsaw’s flamer mod.
---
The big issue is finding weapons it works for. I think it’s only two: flamers and Shishkebab. The only test I didn’t do is Shishkebab’s extra flame jets mod cause I couldn’t attach them. But considering the results, I don’t think it’ll help. The best healing would be with a flamer and rank 3 of the perk, but at that point you’re dealing with the massive cost of fuel for the flamer. Meeeeeeeh!
---
I decided in the end Team Medic was way better.
---
Or even better, sorting that works as well as any of the popular inventory sorting mods from FO4.  Honestly.
---
Turtle Beach makes good headsets

Content needs to drop soon.!!! Ive completed the game twice over now rgeres nothing to do but farm farm farm and be a wingman to the new vault dwellers

Hey, I use an explosive double barrel sometimes (no two shot though) and kill enemies in 1-2 shots, and I don't know anything about spawn conditions.
---
I think they mean the * 
---
This. F Marcy Long and her emo husband.
---
Just had 3 guys attack me while on a terminal at Morgantown Airport. I just stood there and watched my HP - their damage was miniscule. It annoyed me to stay there while being hit so I walked out and they followed me. Probably hit me 30-40 times yet didn't take even half my health. I ended up grabbing a stimpack and fast traveling away. Pacifist mode is 100% worth it to leave on, although it was annoying that I had to leave the area. 
---
IDK, I bet it sold fairly well and it doesn’t appear to have had much put into the development and the swag they sold in the special editions were cheap AF. On top of that you know a lot of people have bought Atoms so altogether I’m guessing they have turned a nice profit even if it’s less than what managers might have anticipated. 
---
SpicyPapaCake. You can add me.
---
Its a great world they just need to add more content and fill out the world. We will get it soon enough man. It's just kinda bland if you don't enjoy exploring and finding the hidden places they have across the map.
---
I wonder how Bethesda will fix this issue. Especially with pvp, what's the point of any other build than explosives and shotguns. Just one shot everyone. I guess they will need a Nerf in damage or removal of the explosives effect. What's the point of explosive effect anyway. Nobody needed or asked for it. If you want explosives let us use the actual explosives like 40mm, nukes, gernades, mines. Come on Bethesda
---
Dupers: Am I a joke to you?
---
Good way to harvest Acid nodes without pissing of your character
---
Im there maybe its my privacy settings im not sure. Send me your psn ill add you instead... what u glt anyway?
---
From testing different armor mods it seems like it’s just explosive, but it could also be a combo of both energy and explosive.
---
Have to treat him nicer or meaner depending on his decisions too.
---
It isn't. It's not cheating or manipulation of the game. It's just time saving. I don't need 100 stims and a few hundred pounds of junk on me.. or a weapon I'm saving for a friend. I'll store it elsewhere until I need it. 
---
Also keeps me from accidentally scrapping/bulking/using my mods... for the fifth time. 
---
It definitely is. I do end up with ridiculous amounts of cloth, leather and wood too.
---
Ok, present your counter-evidence. Saying it's wrong doesn't make it so. Prove your case.
---
&gt; We did the same thing in world of warcraft. Online games are well known for bank alts. 
---
Just because an exploit wasn't policed, it doesn't make it any less of an exploit. Much the same way that jaywalking is breaking the law but often isn't policed either. As stupid as it would be to consider jaywalking legal, it would be equally dumb to consider mule characters and not exploiting.
---
It’s an easy way for the dupers to force crash a server 
---
That'd be cool, but it's beyond the kind of general UI improvements I'm looking for here.
---
Happening a lot to me last night when I played.  It was always the legendary that this happened with.  Haven’t been on tonight to see if it’s still happening.  On PS4.   I noticed a ton of first time glitches last night.

MVP!
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer 
---
Good morning buddy just wanted a quick favor from you. Could you verify Bethesda stance on bank alts if possible. From what i have seen on the support page it should not be an issue but better safe than sorry.
---
The very first thing you did in this thread was defend Bethesda against Rockstar, which is what makes me believe you’re defending Fo76 against Rockstar’s game which gets more praise than Bethesda’s. But that’s okay. 
---
I'd just spew NPC nonsense. Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
---
How far in are you? I feel like a dick asking so high levs to carry me
---
It’s all fun and games until you hear of another settlement that needs our help
---
He's been missing in action since this whole shitstorm began. To cone out with an apology would be a nice start. Bought the game at $40 the first day it got reduced on xbox, with free Microsoft money earned through Bing rewards, and I Still feel ripped off.
---
We need a Dragonrend equivalent ability. In Skyrim using that ability forced dragons to land. Bethesda needs to work in a quest that gives the player a "Scortchbeast Gun" that does the same thing. I bet that it would be locked behind pay dlc.
---
Lol I thought at first you were asking for a turret that literally shoots bubbles. 
---
I need to remember this. Right now my best loading screen is my character (old, balding guy with a beard) in his undies giving a thumbs up like a senile nut job. 
---
Right now 39.
---
Sure, when that system happen, awesome. However, that system isn't the same as what's happening with mule characters. It's a false equivalence.
---
If people still have mule characters on top of this, that mule character is STILL an exploit. If you transfer items so that the other character is played, ok cool. I imagine that's the intended feature.
---
ALSO, community manager thinking it's a good idea doesn't mean the devs do. 
---
If the devs say that mule characters are fine, I'll retract my statement. Until the, exploit, plain as day.
---
it is little frustrating that after 541 hours of playing for some things you just can wait for casino to reward you 
---
Hyperbole much?
---
I get it. We definitely need some changes, and I think you made some great suggestions.
---
Thanks for the link bro appreciate it. Still need to find what im looking for and be the 1st in there but yeh not too bad
---
The water purifier is a known bug.  I have one, too.
---
He's living with Sean Murray. 😂😂😂
---
lol, that would be the gama turret by the way. but no meaning the wall and ceiling turrets you see everywhere. 
---
Haaha. That would suck! But i dont play for stuff. I play for fun.
---
Actually I was commenting about the irony of rockstar fanboys unable to acknowledge the issues with rdr2 while complaining about another developers game engine. I didn't say anything about Bethesda but I understand, reading comprehension is difficult. It's okay buddy.
---
Server Roll Back / AKA: Not Saved
---
Every time you get an amazing item, you need to log off the game to force a save. 
---
Hemlock holes  maintenance has 3 (?) acid generators. The cranberry bog has snallygasters that drop decent acid as well.
---
I have played a lot of MMOs, and have always loved ones that have a shared bank. My new characters always have a good start with some weapons and armor, like something nice for level 5, something nice for level 10, etc. If I found a mage item I'd keep it for when I make a mage. Stuff like that. I'm a hoarder so I love to keep things for when I need them, or to give to someone if they need them, and when I need them or someone else needs them it makes it all worth while.
---
To expand on what the other person said, every time you level up from 51 onward you have the option of moving 1 SPECIAL point or choosing a perk card. You can't do both.
---
Someone might have the marsupial serum plan that could make it for you
---
(A bit of extra detail) After 50 each level up you get gives you an option. Either you pick a perk card, or you can move a single perk point from one attribute to another. 
---
There’s a difference between criticism and being an asshole. Most of you are doing the latter.
---
I have a vast collection of these things for no reason
---
Ive seen this happen when the gun an enemy is holding drops on the ground when they die instead of in the corpse container. Has happened to me with both legendary and non legendary enemies.
---
This is definitely a problem. I know this because I somehow have a fast travel mat. I'm not sure how. Maybe it was left over from the beta or something. But I have it at my camp. And when I travel to camp, there's like a 50/50 chance I'm trying to fight my way out of a concrete foundation. 
---
Which is tomorrow can’t wait 
---
There's a big patch coming. We'll learn about it tomorrow.
---
I bet alot of ppl are going to have meltdowns though.
---
Everyone running around with tse guns and bloodied builds are never going to be challenged and unless those builds are nerfed nothing will replace those setups.
---
Im down to join up, level 114 with melee/rifle build. Gt is Gator Vz.
---
Yeeeew me too bro. :D
---
Thank you MrE78!
---
I love my fishy !
---
This so much. 
---
(Thinks back 24 hours and how a group of 3 scorch beasts tore me apart on my current lvl 15 character) Uhhh, I think I’ll give it a pass this time. 
---
They were in the BETA. And if you had it in the BETA and never scrapped it it's still there, as is mine seen in the recent photo (notice my camp and decon shower): http://imgur.com/6RSihqa
---
It does put me here when I fast travel, but if I'm at my camp and load into the world it will place me in a different location that was relative to where I first placed my camp.
---
I mean I can tell. I’m so pissed. Now my game won’t load. Forced to validate my god damn files when I could’ve been leveling up for the past 40 minutes!
---
that’ll be like 50k caps. 
---
Went and looked Just a blocking piece but it is crap low level for an alt.  I seemed to have only hoarded weight reductions. 
---
Good to know they have a robust regression suite for the game.
---
Yes
---
You do know that both Devann and Lone have posted on the idea of shared stashes between alts and love the idea of sharing loot between alts right?.
---
Even still if it will shut you up i have asked Lone to comment on it for ya. :)
---
I'm going to call BS on this, that's not a fix, that's a Band-Aid. And a not very effective one at that.
---
Go to the prison, kill supers and do quest, and server hop.  Its a great way to get plans and XP. 
---
There was a post recently where a Bethesda rep acknowledged this suggestion.

---
Aside from Hemlock Holes in the Toxic Valley, there's a federal disposal site way down south in the Savage Divide that has an acid extractor. 
---
Seconded. Just fix the issues where it loads you in before the floors. You often get stuck in the foundation. I know because I somehow still have a mat. I'm guessing it's left over from the beta.
---
On a related note, let me choose other options for said mat. I want to relocate it but it looks weird having a welcome mat in the middle of my house. 
---
Trust me, you don't want Engineers in here.  They'll cause a shitstorm.
---
So now we are assholes for criticizing a game we paid $60 for on false promises?
---
I saw my first one today (lvl 50). It was flying around ..  I turned in the other direction and hailed my lvl 7 ass back the way I came! 
---
Overcumbered of course 
---
Yeh Im level 229.
---
To the point that sometimes I will leave or switch to farming hardened mass etc when below level 40's rock up with low level gear and weapons. They exponentially raise the DR of her.
---
Because I am not wasting any of my ultracite ammo etc so others get a free ride. I might if Im in a nice mood though.
---
Its to the point sometimes that I can see that out of 15ish people I am the only one doing any significant damage. (Millimeters at a time mind you). And im talking with level 100ishes in the mix.

Has anyone found a survey marker in the ash heap , the challenge says mountains by the coal train depot . Please help 
---
I've seen it happen a couple of times. Makes me wonder if that's the issue with legendaries not dropping any legendary items. Maybe their weapon got flung away when they died. 
---
How many legendary enemies got to keep the loot from you? About 20 from launch have hidden prone in those fields for me.
---
Her husband was also bouncing ideas off him for designing stuff for her. 
---
Yeah my first encounter was the one by pumpkin house. I tried hiding in the little shack by the fissure and he still hit me. I was pissed. 
---
i did it solo first, died once, a lot of looking around about what to do...the ceiling turrets are definitely the most annoying. I did it with melee so i had to run up to them and i keep thinking it would be much easier on my vats character... iv also experienced more super mutants all rushing toward me than the robots in the silo. it's just long, but not the hardest in the game.
---
...there were only 4 locations though.

Has more of a point than a post crying and bitching about it.

Hats can't be crafted currently, they're bugged.

You know I haven't decided yet. Probably will do Marksman line at least. Focusing endurance early

I would have less of an issue if those epilepsy  beams didn't blind you. Once they start spamming it, I just stop shooting until I can get a better view or they begin to fly around

You don’t have to wait for nuke to disappear, you can just keep nuking her. She will spawn each time. If you nuke from all 3 silos then I’d hop servers, but you definitely don’t have to wait out the nuke zone.

Dunno if this is new or not but since the new year just being attacked by enemies is making me crash to desktop, first was a single strike from a ghoul and next was after the third hit from a deathskull radscorpion.

I do this as well. Its a little fiddly, but it works. I have a tool shed attached to the back of my house done this way. 
---
i thought the same, but he has a point, vats not regenerating because it was a moment in time.  Now, in real time, it should definitely regenerate.  I don't use vats too often, but I agree with OP 100%
---
Alright give me ten to fifteen minutes to run the silo
---
It's so weird, like we could conquer the world together and fight badass things.... 🤩🤩🤩
---
Ive got a plus one wjth me, Ttly Kyle
---
Yeah, shared stash isn't something I have an issue with at all. I presume you do so so that you can actually play more than 1 character, right?
---
However, let's clarify for certain. I have no problem being wrong but let's see if using a character just for extra storage isn't considered an exploit.
---
Since the workshop nerfs it seems much faster and more rewarding to just go out and find the junk to scrap. But for 3 resource collectors it might be worth it. At least until I can find a good run
---
I'd very much like a staircase that goes up on a single foundation piece. I have a spire in my base, but can't actually get up the top. 
---
GT is statesidellama join on me I guess? Everytime I try to join I crash. 
---
I understand. It gets easier. 
---
Explore the ash heap and Charleston areas. Super mutants and mole miners give more XP than similar levels of ghouls and scorched and usually drop ammo and gear. The mistress of mysteries quest line will give you some direction if your looking a task more than a grind, but ramps up quickly. 
---
Otherwise find a hazmat suit, a pile of Molotov's, and a whitesprings nuke zone. Other than the occasional Chad/Karen most players will be fine with you tagging along for the mass XP/loot as long as your not using frags to fling bodies all over the map. 
---
GT is statesidellama if I don't drop an invite. 
---
Put a couple points into Charisma and get the Rad Sponge perk. Share it, and offer to team up with anyone you can. The perk causes everyone on the team to proc the effect fairly frequently, which means none of you should have to worry about radiation.
---
I paid full price and love it. 
---
I'm playing a maxed luck, maxed agility VATS build and honestly wouldn't need more AP regen. Every second hit is a critical, and it regens so quickly even without Action Girl.  
---
Oh, didn't see that coming
---
Hah, I actually took this as part of the lore because the “owner” was kind of paranoid, so I assumed he made a shizload of dummy keys to throw people off the trail.
---
Yeah I expected us to get some kind of scorch beast disable device during the main quest line, we set up early detection systems, inoculated against their plague, and even figured out a weakness with the sonic emitter. But nah. 
---
And how many of those fights have gameplay designed around ‘now do the same thing again...and again...oh and guess what, again’. Scorchbeasts are not boss fights they are just annoying trash mobs that serve to deplete resources so that the grind for ammo and meds can be extended.
---
If Final Fantasy has an achievement ‘Beat OmegaBahamut with just a Wooden Rod’ I wouldn’t expect the game to then throw OmegaBahamuts at me every now and then and remove all my gear just so I could get that same rush of achievement satisfaction again.
---
Who cares what the devs say or your statement? People are going to play exactly how they want to and there's nothing anyone can do about it. You can use the big scary word exploit all you want, but there's a big difference between an exploit that causes harm to the game and players experience, and an exploit that makes a players experience better that doesn't affect anyone. Some people like to collect things. They like to collect every clothing item, every weapon, every legendary effect. The game punishes them for that. While people who don't care about anything and just trash and sell everything get rewarded with lots of caps, sprinting and fast travelling everywhere, perfect damage and defense build, etc. While those who want to collect and plan ahead are gimped with weight reduction perks and low AP all the time.
---
I have a 2 shot plasma flamethrower and it melts everything. Quickly.
---
It makes sense. If you have an overloaded help desk for FO76 and the employees for ESO aren't seeing that much traffic it would make sense to assign some of the team to help out with tickets.
---
How about we get some power armors with shovels to fill in all those damn ditches while we're at it.
---
Yeah dude
---
Shotgun plus skeet shooter and enforcer is awesome. 
---
With a vats build and AP regen during you could do critical shots indefinitely.
---
Just one after another, forever.
---
If yours last 5 secs you are doing it wrong. Mines about 10-15 secs.
---
But then again its not the flying aspect that is the power of the jetpack.
---
Imagine asking this in October.
---
Oh no you don’t understand what I meant. He shot them once and runs away. Hence the boards. He doesn’t even kill them. It’s just to crash the server.
---
This sounds like the basis for a Vault building DLC as well! I’d be happy with both being implemented.
---
They're just bullet sponges, no fun in killing them.
---
You aren't given loot though since a 3 star legendary doesn't guarantee you anything. 
---
Actually a 3 star can be worse than a 1 or 2 star.
---
Move your little CAMP box, it alters your spawn point. 
---
You're fantastic guy. And so is the dude who's giving you the stuff 😅
---
I got two copies of tricentennial for 35 each :) But I also now own 3 copies of the game across 2 platforms so rip.
---
Its fun...
---
I'm not - this is generally asking for UI improvements and I figured I'd throw in "Let me level up my fun legendaries" while I was posting.
---
I liked the video, but OP is right. You guys are all hypocrites when it comes to murdering noobs.
---
I'm pretty sure they are winding this game down.  They did an update a week leading up to xmas for sales.  
---
Now they are finished with this experiment.  Duping has ruined all and  the multiplayer never really took off.  Too few people per server.
---
TL:DR They aren't going to make this game viably good.
---
Its pretty funny
---
OK lets consider if AP continued to regen in VATS just like it does outside of VATS. Either way your DPS is limited by the regen rate so the main difference is only quality of life - you don't have to bounce in and out of VATS just to regen AP. If anything there are already advantages to disengaging VATS (actions unavailable while in VATS) so it should be up to the player if they want to disengage VATS in order to do something else or if they just want to wait for AP to regen.
---
The release was like $80aud I'm pretty sure, and it don't have beef with it given how beautiful the world looks, I have no beef with a company making money, no one should.  
---
Every game has bugs or worse, imbalances. Imbalance or poor balancing are worse than bugs since bugs are unintentional.  
---
PS1 development was easy, it was a quick process since graphics were ass. There was no need for really high end stuff which is expected in todays games. Also patching a game is much more efficient method especially as a business. If you can make money in the interim of fixing things and adding content then it seems like a smart way to go.  
---
"Well perhaps once you graduate" I really want to know you're experience now, are you a full time AAA dev or just a basement dweller. I know the QA Process, I have done QA for two companies now in gaming and software so I do know what it is and it's role, you moron. Furthermore I don't think the consumer base is too naive, not in a brushstroke way anyhow; people see what they like and buy stuff. Heck in this day and age if people are so naive they can look stuff up.   
---
I played Skyrim heaps and just from that you get exposure to community patches, fixes, expansions and workarounds. You get used to the idea that the devs are human and the modders are too. It is a companies best interest to make money, I think people are under the impression that gaming is charity work and given that a study shown people believe in Socialism, it doesn't surprise me.
---
*Assuming that everybody on this sub is from USA*
---
South east of the top of the world there's a lake with a boat on it.
---
On the map its that green thing.
---
In the middle of the lake, to the right if walking down the boat, is an acid node, in the water.
---
I've been built there for residual acid as i collect it everywhere i go.
---
&gt; - legendary weapons that normally don’t deal fire damage: What? If you mean weapons like Perfect Storm that proc burn effects: No.
---
Perfect storm was exactly what I was thinking of.
---
Man, so much wasted potential with this perk. I haven't FF gotten yet, but team medic and stim related perks has been great for keeping my team alive.
---
One more thing, does it work with the mod for the laser rifle that inflicts burning?
---
You can also bulk 10 acid using 2 plastic. Then break down the bulk acid for 15 acid. 
---
You can basically turn 2 plastic into 5 acid. 
---
you can accidentally buy a plan you already own unless you have a google spreadsheet letting you know which ones you have
---
Dude, saying you don’t have a legal case =/= defending something. If you could sue a game company over this it would have happened years ago.
---
a level 80 is about \~20-25 shoot with a two shot gaus. the problem is they don't drop usefull loot.
---
You would really thing that a NUKE would cut / burn the damn grass.  I guess its got a high lead content or something. 
---
"they make this game unfun" is a bit dramatic poorly designed nah it's bugged. But the scream spam is annoying. 
---
I just found one at Tanagra town. Very top level. 4 story house to the left of the blue car as you keep climbing up. Pretty sure it's the highest point at Tanagra Town. It's on the highest level of the house. A little tricky to get to (with power armor).
---
Its also one of my fave game series because in addition to what you mention there are many ways to skin a cat.
---
While farming at Whitesprings, I had a piece of armor in my inventory that provided a 50% chance of auto-reviving if I went down. 
---
Seemed to work, as I don’t have any other perks or armors equipped to do this. 
---
I play with my partner and I swear she makes smarter decisions than me. She is a far superior gamer to me. 
---
Thank you.
---
no its all about the lvls and the play time stop being a dick
---
On the pc, there was a command to disable grass completely. Which was FANTASTIC. It no longer works since one of the last patches. But it was VERY easy to find corpses as well as plants.
---
That always pissed me off. Why am i going through a 2 min load screen only for nothing in the world to be loaded before me? I thought the point of the load screen was for the game to... I dont know, load?
---
Two words: Mirelurk King
---
I really like that Bethesda reps reply here a lot but from what I seen there has been radio silence on this even though it is one of the most widely discussed topics. It's almost like they were specifically told not to touch on this issue... 
---
Exactly. Until I was given the idea of alt accounts, I sold or just dropped stuff. Which sucks. I'm meeting new players I'd love to pass this on to. So now I save it. 
---
Getting the plans for mods isn't very likely - Excavator plans are only from Camden Park and I'm not sure of the probabilities but the others aren't commonly seen either except for the few you mentioned.  Plus for some mods you'll need rare materials like flux as well to craft the mod.
---
Also if you READ it says SQUARE... PS4
---
Nice I wonder what other armor perks might apply as well. I know through personal experience that chameleon and cloaking don’t do maybe it’s only items that trigger chems?
---
Agreed; i have my camp built half off the side of a cliff and sometimes i end up spawning between a wall and the cliff.
---
Most strains of the fev virus don't end with people retaining intelligence like Virgil. He had a special, modified strain. Most, especially most of those on the east coast, resulted in lumbering, aggressive, idiots. The strain at Mariposa on the west coast was better at retaining intelligence, but it still wasn't perfect. 
---
You talk like perks don't exist.
---
With  lone wonderer AP regen is jacked up by 30%.
---
Playing an instrument gives another 25%.
---
Are you running a vats build? 
---
Upvote for "mellifluous."
---
It really doesn't make a difference as far as crits - currently when your AP runs out VATS cancels and you wait for it to regen, then you have to re-engage VATS and continue to use your crit meter. It would feel better if the player can just stay in VATS so the UI doesn't have to shift. What would inadvertently be buffed by my suggestion are Concentrated Fire and Gun Fu - those benefits go away when you cancel VATS, but I don't think it would be overpowered anyway.
---
You don’t spend an hour in front of a door shouting “OPEN DOOR!” “USE DOOR!” “USE HANDLE!” “TURN HANDLE!” “TURN DOORKNOB”  “USE DOORKNOB...” while trying to find out the exact text input you need to do in order to open a door 
---
Teddy Bears-250
---
and get banned? no thanks :/
---
Possibly. Any armor that provides chem-use seems to work passively when not equipped. There may be others, the effects are less apparent and thus unnoticed. 
---
Until lvl 35 mutations are useless. You need sta rched Gene's
---
Wow. I just figured out had to do with being able to move your base. It obviously takes time for the server to recognize it. Probably a lot more simple in FO4 where you could only build in certain areas. 
---
Hope you get some kind of fix. Can you scrap you mat? Sounds like a pain vs just waiting for stuff to load.
---
There have been a decent amount of times where I had the Garb of Mysteries’ benefit without even having it equipped. 
---
For shotguns its the whole buckshot.
---
Unless its explosive then magically its each pellet.
---
Agreed. Just keep me in the loading screen for another 25 seconds so it's all loaded in. 
---
My fav is a teddy fear drumming on some pots smoking with a collander on its head. 
---
It’s supposed to be random but there’s some rumors that what you’re doing can affect the mutation you get. Like jumping around for Marsupial. 
---
... Who gave you the opinion that interface mods will get you banned?.
---
Reshade and Cheat engine are the only ones i know of that are not allowed. 
---
Super mutant class  = a bunch of Thanos clones running around with power fists.
---
For me that will be the next fallout.
---
I revisist them from time to time (especially vegas):
---
Stopped tactics cause F3 came out.
---
Stopped F3 cause vegas came out.
---
Stopped vegas cause F4 came out.
---
Stopped F4 cause F76 came out.
---
So I will never ever burn out from this series. I love the game and series that much.
---
I agree somewhat with your post although it generalizes some people.
---
&gt;there's a big difference between an exploit that causes harm to the game and players experience, and an exploit that makes a players experience better 
---
So we can agree that you've conceded that mule characters are an exploit?
---
See the thing is I agree with your statement about there being a big difference. Not so much that it doesn't affect anyone. It gives those that can/do exploit it an advantage over those who can't. 
---
Those who cheat the system by using extra storage that wasn't intended for that purpose don't have the pressures that people who can't do the same have. So no, the mule character exploit does affect other people because exploiters don't suffer the same pressures as regular players do. They can't storage a bunch of junk materials or legendary items for later use. 
---
Those differences might or might not have a tangible effect. However, once again, let's not pretend that you're not cheating the system.
---
Bear in mind that's all separate to whether the game could do with better storage management but that's not what we're talking about.
---
Y'all doing my boy Slink dirty. Times have been hard since Andy turned into a scorched, and Woody and Buzz were scrapped for plastic and cloth... 
---
I wish. The colorful paint isnt metal. A nice PA skin would of been nice also
---
I guess so, depends on climate as well, a dry area wouldn't collect as much moisture... It's generally not a good idea to use a compressor to clean out with though.
---
One thing folks don't mention as often is that the targeting is underdeveloped across all enemies. After level 100 I shouldn't be grunting because level one mole rat is biting my ankle. In the whole instant Agro thing has been with the franchise since Oblivion. Scorch beasts are no different. They're flying along minding their business, if they catch a glimpse of me it becomes their life purpose to fuck with me until I can fast travel away. Targeting is fucked.
---
Don't screw with the noobies like this....lol
---
Lesser dog has gone where no dog has gone before 
---
Those two have removed most of the barriers the previous gen had on updates. And BGS is fine with delayed patches as at least one recent patch came out on consoles two days later than PC.
---
Man, I found one long ago but vendored it, thinking it was kinda useless. Didn’t realize what a meme it would become. 
---
Don't bother with mutations until you have both the Starched Genes and Class Freak cards.  They're in the luck category.  Until you get those, the mutations are more trouble than they're worth.
---
Maybe a Raider one even? Give people a better reason to wear it more?
---
Welcome to the naughty list, and it gets checked twice.
---
Haha, I said rumors.
---
Ahh yes. I remember how Fallout 3 would only let you store 600 units in your house before making you literally throw everything away.
---
Sorry are you saying feedback and suggestions are pointless and we should not want the best for the game?.
---
It'd be more feasible than a class action suit against Bethesda.
---
It's like the letters I get from the bank telling me they're going to write to me about something.
---
I hear you man. I want to put together a house design that's more complex than the standard 2-year old crayon drawing, and it's like there's always a rule in the way of everything I try no matter if it would work just fine in real life. 
---
I dig it! Just wasn't sure if I read that right
---
Well some plans are pricey. Either due to vendor purchase or low drop rates. Plus there is no way of telling what plans you already have. So I imagine they use the caps to buy every possible plan in order to have access to everything?
---
Get a pair of headphones with a built in mic from Dollar General or whatever.  Like $15 tops. 
---
Try your luck with a set of earbuds with a built in mic they sell those for starting at about $5. 
---
I’ve used both before and ruined both. They didn’t have issues until I pulled the usual and caught them on something and ripped them off my head. 
---
Well maybe not those mechanics but the depth of the world comes from text in both
---
This is a 10/10 idea. One of those things that i’d like to see once the mess of duping, bugs, and stability settles down. 
---
Yeah if you want to see fanboys unable to see downsides to a game you’ve certainly come to the right place. You come off as a complete asshole and you’ve been unable to be civil in any response you’ve conjured up so I have no reason to think your opinion is built on anything but pure spite. See you later partner. 
---
its easy to fix. just scan a players inventory and if u find a similar legandary item just remove all. a simple scripe can do this.
---
At least *he* gets laid.
---
I don't disagree, but I also don't hold much hope of Bethesda improving it.
---
They stash them away on alts so that they can buy any item they see to dupe. Especially when higher lvl/star weapona come out. The originals will be very expensive of new drops. That's at least what i assume, because i don't see any other reason.
---
I'll join, I've ran with ya a couple times before
---
Great idea.

"Alright everybody got your flare gun?"

I had three workshops today, chugging along. Red Rocket, the Ammo shop, and Hemlock Holes. Red Rocket got hit with a 3 lv 80 SB attack, which I just fucking ran from and rebuilt after they left. Then the god damn ammo shop got hit by the same attack, so I crouched inside and wandered around my house for 20 minutes doing other shit because I was so frustrated with it. I come back, THEY'RE STILL FUCKING THERE FLAPPING AROUND. Ran from that shit too. Luckily, I never got one on Hemlock Holes, but good sweet christ, I'm pretty much convinced that Scorchbeasts are the WORST FUCKING DESIGNED ENEMIES IN VIDEO GAME HISTORY. Don't @ me because there is no debate. If Bethesda is ashamed of nothing else about this game, they should be ashamed about the fucking Scorchbeasts.
---
Full time corporate critical infrastructure developer. In before ‘but games aren’t as important as that stuff so they can be more reckless’.
---
If you’ve worked for two companies in QA and you think the Fallout 76 release and current state is in any way acceptable then you are the moron. Sev 1s at go live, critical functionality regressions, horrendous server stability, the list goes on.
---
I didnt know that, in theory provided u had enough plastic if u bulked it then broke it down, rinse and repeat wouldnt that exponentially multiply your acid?
---
They better not nerf shit in my inventory, I’ve worked my balls off to be untouchable 
---
Yes I play a VATS build with all of those perks and more (Action Boy/Girl, Core Assembly on Power Armor OR increased AP regen armor. I have plenty of AP and I'm not asking for more AP. That's not the issue. I just find it jarring to have to disengage VATS to wait for AP regen, then go back into VATS to keep shooting. Pointless animation / UI shifting. Let the player control when VATS is on or off. Don't force the player out of VATS to regen.
---
LAR is good if you're using rifleman, but if you're just looking for an automatic Combat rifle will probably be the best.
---
I'll show you my needle in a haystack alright
---
 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Outside of sitting on max its just a case of selling them off for real money. From the looks of ebay sold listings alone its sad how many people are buying duped items...
---
But yeah alt account fill it everything so your main account does not get banned (when it happens). Have the best of the best for your main then make a nice profit of the rest off your dupes.
---
u can but it for 15$...
---
That's what i am hoping for they keep doing releasing console behind pc but updating on Sony is still a bitch and a half
---
If you have any special mods don’t bulk steel because the bench will scrap them over the bulk steel. Bethesda has acknowledged this and it’ll be fixed in the next update.
---
Suggestions? But last month we were being told by this community that if we didn’t like the game as-is we shouldn’t have bought it.
---
Get yourself grim reapers sprint for a chance to restore all AP after a kill in vats. Along with quick hands you can keep going &amp; going if luck is with you.
---
Well Santa was taken off of the list of richest fictional characters due to the fact Santa is real. So jokes on you!

Why is coal so damn hard to find in this game
---
I'd sell my first born for some DOOM stuff
---
I actually just need marsupial so I can jump up this mountain at like 15 hp and place my camp. Although you are correct I did that on my main, now flying with class freak + strange in numbers.
---
I really wish you could wear a hazmat suit and still trigger chameleon. I'd have a pure black powder build by now. 
---
&gt; You guys are all hypocrites when it comes to murdering noobs.
---
How so? I've never suggested murdering noobs is bad, and I merrily do it myself when so inclined. 
---
Moreover, Op called us whiny, entitled, crybaby, millennial fags - not hypocrites. I remain totally lost as to how supporting a thread about creative, player-generated content made me any of those things (although I'd have to admit, a reddit single upvote changing my sexual orientation *and* my generational cohort would be an impressive feat).
---
"You're"? No, not me. I haven't done it yet. I suffer walking a lot of the time getting from point A to B. Unless I want to take out my fully modded Excavator and fast travel, but sometimes that isn't an option, even with probably more than 20 points in weight reduction perks equipped. But the OP is asking how to do it, and there are ways to do it that anyone can do if they want to take the risk of losing them. A fake friend might steal the items. Or the server might crash. Or you might not be able to rejoin the server. So I guess if you did want to do it don't put all of your eggs in one basket as the saying goes. Just add a friend, join their server, put stuff in a stash box, and go back on your other character and pick it up. There are risks involved but anyone can do it.
---
Nothing. They eventually own every thing have have nothing much left to do with them. 
---

I thought the industrial purifier had to built in a water source.

Alright. Give me a sec someone dropped a nuke on this server and everyone is being quite aggressive 
---
Looking at your post history you dont seem to be a fan of Fallout 76 at all. So not really sure where you got that information from as your most likely twisting someones words.
---
You think they sell these for caps? The big league dupers sell their duped weapons for cash. 
---
That’s what I’ve been thinking.  Today I bought a 2 star legendary handmade from a player for a very reasonable price of 1000 caps.  But he had two of the exact same ones.  I just wonder what the hell you can do with the caps.
---
Hm, I can make 510 lbs of weapons weigh 83. 
---
Basic game design. If an enemy is hard, it must reward you accordingly, otherwise it's a bad design and people won't keep playing the game.
---
I honestly don’t remember them saying that, only that they would increase it in the future once they assessed server stability.
---
My assumption is dupers have tainted stability data so they have to wait until they’ve got reliable data or dealt with them.
---
I realize that.  But players are selling for caps too.  I bought one today.
---
I know it's random, when I did the grind for all mutations on my main It felt like 50/50. Not sure about the jumping around thing however, lots of rumors in FO76.
---
I just paid $9800 and it hurt
---
Walmart .. yep Logitech is your answer, like 30 bucks; headset/microphone it's dope. Mind the mute button though, on the wire it tends to auto click itself but otherwise you'll put the females in heat.

I was going to go to Fort Defiance to get some ballistic fiber to repair some armor, but ran into the Scorchbeast on the way there, while I was there and leaving! Instead of needing to repair a single piece of armor I now needed to repair all my armor &amp; most of my power armor! I also used all my aid &amp; ammo. And to top it all off, I lost all my junk when I was disconnected from the server before I could die a thousand times trying to get my loot back! I was so devastated that I was going to quit Fallout 76 permanently! I decided not to quit since it was my fault for venturing that far alone at my level. I was only level 25 at the time. I am almost level 40, and I finally got some revenge with the help of the Fort Defiance SAM (surface to air missile) turret. 
---
Its called spsghetti feedback.

Toss everything at the wall and hope it sticks.

The reality is nothing does and ppl get pissy.

Last line made me lol. 
---
Seems to be consensus. Any personal reasons why?
---
 And i can boost everything except auto pistols to 30%. I like playing with things like Night Person (things that effect things other than guns) so im not going to the full 60%. Too many points when i can have half the power for a third of the cost.
---
Yes. If you had a ton of plastic to burn.
---
How'd that interview go? Hope that good real life karma was cashed in.
---
Enclave paint doesn’t exist yet. It WAS Tricentenial paint. 
---
Yep me too. If I get attacked by a scorchbeast, I quit the server instantly. They never stop chasing you half the time and you can’t even hide inside a structure because their gas goes through the walls
---
Pretty sure my game is glitched or some shit with SB. I seem to encounter at minimum 3 a day and one particularly nasty day fucking 12  I don't typically hang out close to fissure spots either. I'm also pretty sure the are bugged in that my TSE dragon does the same damage as shooting it with my TSE handmade maybe once every few SB it does the damage it should and melts them
---
Brilliant!  I'd be proud to die in this trap!

Yes it exists i saw it by my self!!

They have made the canvas bag thing right and the lawfirm that did pick up the false advertising has moved on to investigating other people

My first time into a nuke zone was at Whitesprings at level 20 or so and immediately ran into a level 95 Behemoth taking out a guard booth of robots. I not only survived but killed him by exploiting his inability to jump over obstacles. He was on one side of the cars that are bumper to bumper on the roadway and I was on the other side. I kept shooting him (doing hardly any damage) and then he would run to the end of the line of cars to come around and get me. I would just hop up over to the other side and start shooting him again. Did this on repeat for about 20 minutes straight and almost ran out of ammo for every gun I had before finally dropping him. Got a one star Vampiric Sledgehammer off of his corpse that has been my go to weapon ever since.
---
Yes indeed it will. I did it a bunch when I first found this out and tripled my acid just a few minutes.  Kinda silly but it works.
---
Think it was probably an oversight.
---
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

Actually most of the posts here are critical of the game so once again you don't know what you're talking about and it's hilarious how you think you've been civil. Yeah, so your opinion isn't built on anything more than bullshit.
---
They get rad resist I would assume 
---
A salient observation. I wish we had the real numbers because they alone would tell us the whole story and let us know whether it's worth staying in or getting out.
---
I'm sure it will be patched eventually
---
I’ve found 2 TSE since Reclamation Day and I enjoy them greatly. I don’t tend to use them in PvP unless they deserve to be 1 Shotted...like the griefer douchebags that like to team up 2 or 3 against 1 and attack me while I’m out wandering alone....they get insta killed until they give up on revenge and go back to camp to pout
---
Ha, okay. I was on my level 7 alt in Whitesprings trying to tag ghouls to level up. A level 179 turned up, and outright killed me 3 times, getting a bounty in the process.
---
"Nice community" okay.
---
The water purifier shown in the picture is a glitch and I am unable to remove it.
---
It saves weight on lead and aluminum - that's it.
---
Read the stories in main missions &amp; side quests, tells you why there are no human npc's
---
Recoil is insane on 10mm, radium's Rad damage will be useless against some enemies. Combat Rifle works in all situations.
---
Then a full minute later they're done reloading 
---
It was literally the response of this sub to criticism of the game. All these hatetrain memes spawned from people here complaining that people only hated FO76 because it ‘wasn’t the game they wanted’ that they shouldn’t have bought it if that was the case. But now as the shine wears off and people are bored (just like the original reviews) requests to change the game are suddenly becoming accepted. You can see the same cycle in the ‘Ive only played 5 hours but I’m having a blast’ posts, give it 2 weeks and they’ll have moved into the ‘now I’m bored’ category, and target will be the ones blowing up a level 5’s CAMP because there is nothing else to do.
---
The difference is some people could see how shallow the game was immediately, others had to wait for the superficial shine to wear off.
---
Lots lol, I do know that an easy way to grind for them is to just collect dirty water over and over though.
---
That bot is part of an event, so immortal
---
Cool thanks will try that tomorrow. Put in a ticket too but all they did was email me where to get the quest. 
---
“Massively multiplayer online game, a video game that can be played by many people simultaneously”

Does the game have an online world [check]
---
Does the game have a large number of players per server [check]

Does the game have RPG mechanics [check]

Find power armor in the wasteland, paint each part with a different paint job and leave it for someone to find.
---
I'm a level 55 and have yet to find plans. I am dying inside.
---
My first death was rad poisoning 
---
Didn’t fallout 3 have a perk called “marked for death” or something? Which made killed enemies glow for a period of time. Having a perk like that would be handy, even if I had to give up a point of perception for it. 
---
Thank you for posting this. I had the same problem and was frustrating!  I dropped all non Quest holotapes and then used the specific one needed, it works. I picked up all of my dropped holotapes and carried on. Thanks again :-)
---
I think this game could fit in actual survivors if the story progresses from Reclamation Day at some point, it just need proper direction.  My hope is that we'll see the storyline advance and offer new things beyond the scorched plague and silos.
---
Must be long service leave.
---
PUT KEY IN DOOR
---
I dont think you can do that.
---
GODDAMN IT GAME LET ME FUCKING OPEN THIS DOOR FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!
---
*Ah yes, nothing says "The Whitespring" quite like 2 scorchbeasts, an army of robots, and "You have contracted The Blight"*
---
I saw a post recently about the fact that some people seem to not like lowbies in Whitesprings because they consider it their territory. Sucks that happened to you :( I've still never done the feral golfer quest because it's always scaled to level 50 or so
---
Human were wiped out I know but the design decision behind that is what I'm curious about
---
I'm really not sure why you'd want this, 99.9% of the weapons and armor you find on bodies are worse than what you have, and usually by a lot, assuming you've even vaguely attempted to upgrade your gear over time. I definitely don't think it would be effective or fun to constantly be swooping up level 5 and 10 weapons when you could be rolling something much higher, not to mention getting chewed up with low level armor. 
---
What if they purchase the rights to the alphabet
---
I tried on an alt at around level 2 and didn't seem to be able to get them, but then aw few levels later got my first one. Think it might have been around level 5.
---
Confirmed, just sitting there on the ground.
---
Why, are they more obnoxious than Xbox or something?
---
im wondering if they sell caps to those "gold farmer" companys for real $$$
---
I agree
---
I like to put mods In the pieces and leave them lying around. I imagine it's more exciting to find a tesla braced t60 arm than the 8th regular t60 arm 
---
Going to wait till later tonight or tommorow. Sorry had a change of plans
---
&gt; The people who were banned for using Reshade
---
Do you have a link for this?  I've not seen any evidence of people being banned for Reshade, nor has anyone posted such in the actual mods forum which seems unlikely.
---
I would like to have a backpack like the one you can buy in the Creation Club.  
---
119 myself 100s of hours in the game and i still enjoy myelf. But even from the start i noticed many issues that need fixing even now still. I almost spat it with the exploiters ruining the player market as its been a clear issue since Beta.
---
But i have not seen anyone say this and i lurk here alot. I have seen posts where people mouth off in a manner that makes their post an instant downvote. Even though if they worded it in a proper way would of done right by the community.
---
I really don’t get this obsession some people have with NPCs 
---
Then you start clutching at straws “KICK DOOR DOWN” “KICK DOWN DOOR” “KICK DOOR” “USE AXE ON DOOR” “BURN HOUSE DOWN!” “USE TORCH ON HOUSE”
---
Dont settle for 400
---
Never said it was acceptable, never said the QA was good, heck some of the base functionality of the game didn't work for a while. But for the parts that didn't work, they could be ignored until later. I hit the token machine bug early on and just kept going. People aren't as resilient or strong-willed as they used to be.   
---
Also too the server stability is a hell of a lot better than many AAA games on the market. Off the top of my head Ark Survival Evolved was a headache, Vermintide 2 has spazzed on me more times, and even Call of Duty Black Ops 4 has had it's issues.
---
Turns out all of Fo76 is actually a trippy dungeon side quest in Tamriel
---
&gt;When there is something to announce, and something positive at that ideally, I'm sure he'll come out of the woodwork. He'll unquestioningly be around during the lead up to the next DLC/content release.
---
But wouldn't that be a bad move?
---
People are gonna pile onto the next tweet he makes.
---
The big reveal will be swamped by people making comments on all of the previous issues.
---
Can you stop pretending you couldn't earn 400 atoms in less than a week of challenges. 
---
Can you link a video?
---
By chance did you have a base there maybe with some turrets?.
---
5 mins
---
Welp that's a question I keep asking myself. 
---
But I come to a couple of conclusions.
---
One would be that the energy from home powered fusion reactors completely negated the need for those little black pieces of carbon.
---
Now they still wanted to include the whole mining industry complex and play off the Union and Commie angle so they threw ulcrite and uranium in there which the former is a fake mineral and the other is used in nuclear power. 
---
Now I know you know this but I'm just reiterating this for the kids out there that may have not had enough science classes yet but can somehow figure out porn hub.
---
Mining plays off a central theme in Appalachia that encompasses alot of what we in Wv deal with. The effects of energy industries that becomes so ingrained in our makeup that it's almost impossible to break free of it. 
---
You can see that with the whole excavator armor quest line.
---
You have the John Henry vs the Steam engine analogy brought forth in a very retro futuristic fashion. Basically spelling out the doom for the blue collar workers to the machines left to rot and mutate into ghouls or scorched while the upper class sat in their ivory vaults.
---
I mean its heart breaking because they got right. 
---
Bethesda got that part right.....hell they got alot right..like how the responders act. If you've lived in WV long enough you see we really do care about our fellow man and like to take care of our own. 
---
It's one of those things. 
---
I'm rambling.....
---
But yeah they replaced the mineral to make it more of a reason it would be mined due to the fact you can walk around in Nuclear reactor suits.
---
Right like what about grahm theres your humanoid npc lmao
---
You know a game can still be "what they wanted" and have suggestions on how it can be further improved. Its not a black and white situation where its either perfect or shit. heck i love the game, and yet I still see some much needed improvements. And im sure some are getting bored of the game, but playing for a few hours every day since launch and nowhere near the end, im certainly far from bored.
---
Somebody never payed Sonic 06
---
I typically find level 40 weapons or similar to whatever level I am in the game and I hate farming materials after my fights. It seems more and more like this is just not the game for me. However there are plenty of games that don't get this kind of reception and people need to stop pretending that isn't true
---
Yes sony is very if you want to update your game you have ti submit it three weeks in advance plus Bethesda and sony aren't great bed fellows 
---
Anywhere with mole miners. Kill em, take the pile of shotguns, missile launchers, gauntlets. Equip scrapper perk and be swimming in steel. Uranium fever with 3+ people to trigger the higher spawn rates is a 10 minute 700+ steel farm.
---
I been trying to figure out that , how can I search for the real life survey markers ? 
---
&gt; Wonder if it is a hold over from fallout 4 
---
Nailed it I'm sure. Used to pause all the timers running in the game (there is no "the game" to pause, right, think of all the various systems as a set of timers independently doin' their thing). I'll bet you a dollar they just missed it when removing the pause functions from all the other timers.
---
I had the unyielding effect, but I didn't have any unyielding armor equipped. It was puzzling.
---
The Fort Defiance SAM is what I spam repair whenever I met the scorchbeast. I can't be bothered to waste ammo.
---
You're a very sensitive lad aren't you?  I'm not sure the raider life is for you.
---
yes indeed. have stopped
---
They gave us a map filled with mountains and hills but make it so difficult to build anything other than a perfectly flat surface
---
I work in the oil field and am on a rig sooo, Steel, Oil, Wood, Acid, Plastic, Aluminum, Nuclear material, springs, screws, circuitry.  I think i am ready....  No lead tho.... I do have graphite... and in fallout pencils have lead... soo not sure about that one. 
---
It’s not condition in of itself, it’s whether the item type can stack by nature.
---
Stacking items like scrapped junk and ammo save the number of themselves as a property and there’s no data difference between 1 missile and 99,999 missiles or whatever the max number is.
---
Mutt Chops have condition but they can stack if they have the same value so once again no data difference.
---
Armor and weapons can’t stack because they can have different mods at any time in addition to varying conditions, duping all of those kinds of items are what kill the servers.
---
Hell, having too many of a normal amount is a problem which is why we have a limited stash.
---
We need a special sort of harpoon gun that has a rope or chain attached to the projectile. Hit the flying trash can, pull his ass to the ground and lit him up. 
---
It's not all bad playing a buggy broken mess.
---
Np, thanks for the heads up
---
Isn't Crosshairs still technically in the forest?
---
I dont get it
---
I've had long dogs too, killed them by swinging a machete wildly. 
---
Lube?
---
Oh, excellent point. Guess I’d let the fire do me in... take my burning like a man.
---
Let this be a lesson to people who preorder. Hint: It won’t.
---
Sure, for some I would imagine. I would wager that they get lost in all the comments about the updates themselves. 
---
Could be snarky passive-aggressive comments. Could also be positive or other comments about said update and so focus is there.
---
If they make a new announcement and you're all "but what about the bag situation", you start to look petty. 
---
Anyhow, Pete's a grown man. He can take it. At least he's seasoned enough not to pull bone-headed gaffs like "what, don't you all have phones?".
---
I'm tired of having the workbench suggest I use item X to build another item X. How does that make any sense?
---
Hi, I'm a quest giver. Please find 10 screws and 2 radstag meat and i'll give you a random legendary and recipe book. -Majis 
---
I'd also like to snap columns to corners instead of the middle.
---
They forgot to add the West Virginia state flower to the landscape.
---
Abbies bunker missions reward the Tesla and Fire traps. And I have heard that you can get the Rad trap at the prison. I don't know if it's an event reward or if it's lying around somewhere. I don't have that one yet.
---
&gt; I can near endlessly list off super hard fights in a variety of different games
---
And we're not talking about any of those games, are we?
---
The Sorchbeast always destroys it at least once every battle. So I still have to use my ammo.
---
Messed with them a bit this evening. They radiate power like pylons do, but in a much smaller sphere of influence. Basically, one of these on the floor will power a ceiling light *almost* directly above it. Can be off center a few feet before it loses power. Good for making light switches for specific lights, etc. 
---
Not a given. It’s not like every game went on sale in Black Friday. Waiting for Black Friday to buy rdr2 would have done nothing 
---
I won't argue with you, but I think you're just rationalizing and validating their pricing by saying it's equally cool to grind daily challenges for a week for this incredibly basic skin.
---
&gt;put 15 points in luck
---
&gt;Stay below 30% hp
---
&gt;equip Serendipity and mysterious saviour
---
&gt;I can die?
---
They also sell caps for Real money
---
Wait, that sounds like a last gen rule. It doesn’t seem like BGS could have patched anything since launch at the same time as everyone else as not everything was known such as method specific duping exploits pre-launch.
---
Is the Sony bad relationship over console mods still.
---
Covers kind of hit and miss. There's also the projectile itself (which is not the same size as the visual) and the splash (and like any splash, the splash emits from where the projectile hit, not from the scorchbeast).
---
I've managed to block it with a tree before though. Don't stand right up on the tree or the splash gets you, and you need some space behind you for the projectiles to go bast or you'll get back/side splashed.
---
There’s one on the corner of 76th and King Drive 
---
Ba dum tssssss
---
Killing Scorchbeasts sense of pride and accomplishment.
---
I assume. I'll let you know if I ever kill one. 
---
Yep get out of white springs lol
---
the one that spawns at the shed outside blackwater mine seems to always be raider power armor. maybe try that. Also try middle mountain cabins im pretty sure that one is always raiders too.
---
They spend the caps on an e-peenie enlargement procedure.
---
This is what I understand the least of all, I think. Even setting aside the terrible degree of "modders will fix it" that peaked with FO4... MODDERS FIXED IT. Why the HELL would you keep the same broken vanilla code and ignore the solutions?
---
Fuck it I'll take the down votes if they come...
---
Paid* 
---
Am I the only one who kinda wants the self destruct shown lol like if your in game when they self destruct you get a countdown and can drop them, and need to drop them or they explode in inventory, doing some measure of damage for each piece you have lol 
---
Mid of the bog, cheep fast travel on both sides map, water near, fun to take the near by settlements
---
So is it pretty much agreed on that the dupers are causing the server instability?
---
I found a shower stall with one glowing mushroom growing out of the drain, love that good bathroom humour
---
Ohhh, so that's what this dude i saw on playstation was doing, then again, can't really tell when the game crashes every 7 minutes 
---
Dude Mordor and cranberry bog are in the exact same location if you overlay the map of middle earth on fo76. Mount doom = fissure site prime confirmed

The camp makes a sphere or cylinder shape where you can build, it extends down every bit as it does up.
---
Good ol bear arms
---
The tall white concrete walls under defense line up pretty exactly with it (though they don't snap to it). They eat your budget like candy though.
---
It seems like it would save alot of stress on the system as well if they moved the spawn point inside for Whitesprings. Everyone spawns outside so the game has to load all of that only for almost everyone to run directly indoors and have to load all of that, it is a waste of resources. 
---
I agree. :( I wanted to use this for cheaper spot-healing or after people Radaway that stubborn sliver of rads that always seems to stick around, but...even for that, it took too much. I think with three ranks it could MAYBE POSSIBLY be serviceable for that at least but....that isn’t worth three perk ranks.
---
No, laser burn capacitors do not work either. :/
---
The world is full of all the things you need just waiting to be picked up.

I call it lame that you don’t know that.

It's your duty to destroy any and all camps that have locked water purifiers and locked doors. If they don't want to share then they will pay in resources.

ROFL I didn't even think of using VATS, can't stand it, this would have been a good time to remember it existed! Had one of these racing around my camp the other day, it was kind of horrifying tbh. I wound up just flailing around with melee until it died.
---
 only the ones right near the ghoul spawns? Or all? 
---
Again, tell that to the furious handmade my heavy gunner has. I legit got it from a petrified corpse. Whether or not you are supposed to get legendary drops or not, it happened. 
---
XD I love it 
---
I just found a vampire's one, I need to see if it's as OP as I think it will. A beta tuner receiver is a nice bonus too
---
WOW. Excellent insight.
---
Rhododendron are in the game, unless this was a joke, in which case /r woosh
---
The long coat is proving difficult, already grinder five hours but not giving up!
---
They don’t need to, the heart attack already killed you.
---
come on i got two scorchbitch wings and some awesome leather armor today, thankfully it wasn't legendary and i was able to scrap it.  then a was able to fast travel all over the map looking for led to replace all the ammo i ~~wasted~~ used..... how cool is that
---
Run to a doorway to get out or put down your PA... Happens all the time. Dont panic.
---
Well it seems its more down, it took me 5 stairs to get up the cliff where my camp was placed but I can only go up 2
---
CONGRATULATIONS! Heres a peice of paper that says you have won a years worth of food, but can't obtain because everyone who works for the company is dead... CONGRATULATIONS!
---
There's one that increases perception by 2.
---
I live in a place in cranberry bog with lots of tarberries nearby, I always start a session with around 30 tarberryjuice on my hotbar, they restore a lot of ap allowing me to practically run from one end of the map and back without ever having to slow down.
---
Bethesda have said twice now that they are going to improve communication. 
---
Sweet Little Lies™
---
They land fairly quickly and melee shreds them.
---
Yeah if I had 2 I'd give you one :/ payed 1k for it and was lucky the guy even sold it to me lol xD you know where to get it right?
---
Ark is not Triple A.
---
And ‘putting up’ with issues like the token machine is the naïveté I was talking about. You aren’t more resilient than other gamers. You just have a lower standard of quality. If, as you say, base parts of the game don’t work then it has no business being released. The fact that some subset of gamers are prepared to ignore critical issues does nothing but reduce the level of quality required for a game to turn a profit off this core of ‘resilient’ gamers. And that means each game will push the boundaries, trimming more and more in the pursuit of the highest margin on a minimum viable product. This game, much like EAs lootboxes, was when the major part mainstream gaming said ‘enough’. When older Bethesda titles were a buggy mess we could look to the community patches and mod tools. Not this time. Todd (or his speech writers) had the bad foresight to add a quip about Bethesda games being reliably buggy in their FO76 floorspeech. And that would have been funny if they proved it wrong. Instead it makes it seem like they don’t actually give a shit, that bugs and defects are quaint hallmarks of the BGS brand, and that branding will carry any game to the big bucks.
---
And yes, I have no doubt that the game could have been even worse but that’s not exactly a resounding endorsement of it.
---
It's a garunteed source of ultracite plans and stabilized flux, that's worth it.
---
Thank, I have murder ideas that have been held back because of RNG. Some people do not have good ideas and I want to put something out before the glory hogs roll through, read the trap schematics, and take all the credit from redditors.
---
Well, I know what im farming for after work 
---
What system are you on? I’m just curious, I’ve done numerous silos and have yet to get stuck in my PA. I’m curious if it’s a system bug or gamewide.  
---
Haha great now I just need to theorycraft a unequipped weightless armor build. But seriously, depending on what perks work, there could be some game breaking combinations like sentinel/cavalier stacked armor effects.
---
In level 120, and I just got it for 760 caps with Hard Bargain 3 on at Welch Station
---
Weird flex
---
Ghoul spawns 
---
We could just drop a nuke on them, amirite?
---
Found a duper fuck who does this as well lmao go fys and stop ruining the game for others
---
Yeah, trying to find cover from SB sonic attacks is pretty much impossible unless you get into a building with a roof. Even then they'll just crop dust you until you move from that cover. The most hilarious part of Scorchbeast sonic attacks is that, if you're undetected by one that is attacking someone else and you are in the way of the projectiles, the projectiles pretty much fly right through you without so much as damaging you. Nothing makes sense with SBs, at all.
---
Omg your life is the worst ever! You played 541 hours and the game had treated you so unfairly! 
---
Having fun is the reward for the game. Not items that are no more than electrical pulses. 
---
If your really serious, don’t you think you might have some issues you need to work on?
---
None of its real. 
---
Good bye. 
---
Also snallys by Hemlock as well
---
These seem like the best solutions. It’d help fix some other balance issues like bullet sponge enemies as well.
---
Off topic: what’s the name of that dictation app? Sounds interesting!
---
https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/datasheets/
---
NOAA has great data on lots of stuff.
---
Im not ruining the game for others, I've never done this. But tbh theres nothing wrong with doing this 
---
rekt
---
Yeah I have a lot of fun ideas too. I need to do a bunch of testing at workshops to see how all of the pvp mechanics work. So far they are really stupid. I don't know if people get flagged for disarming a trap. I don't know if it flags you or if they take full damage from them. But workshops are great because they have much higher budget available.
---
I am torn on this. It's definitely a more reasonable price, chrome is always cool, but... it's for the minigun. It isn't the weakest weapon in the game because the chainsaw exists. I keep almost getting this skin, but then I can't justify any purchase, no matter how cheap, if it'll never be used....
---
I like using heavy weapons. Main a Plasma Gatling coz I just like the thing and grit my teeth and hope something in the next 2 patches will fix its many issues. But I've tried using the minigun just for fun also, and it was not fun. 4,246,220 rounds to watch something's healthbar move four and a half pixels was just kinda *killing the mood.*
---
So is the problem that aggroing too many enemies crashes the server a problem with the player doing it or a problem with the design of the game?  BecUse I think it’s the latter.
---
Love the caves!
---
[Except for when this happens](https://i.imgur.com/D8iSrV7.gifv)
---
It just teaches people not to buy games on release in the current climate of releasing unfinished games. 
---
Just wait a week or 2 on break until the January updates come out and then try again. Level 150+ guys are usually exploiters from the early days. I exploited some but I just hit level 100
---
Life-saver armour. You just pop back to life. Takes away your control for a second though, so probably you're just back in the one shotters sights.
---
Hilarious for just jumping off a cliff next to people who then get confused about how you survived without power armor. though.
---
Both. Also asshole players exploiting this.
---
100%, you should be able to crash a server by aggroing a bunch of robots. He’s not cheating or glitching or doing anything outside of what the game allows him to do.

List of all mods and what they do, hope this helps.
---
That's exactly how they fixed it the last 2 times.
---
And I bought it! I like having a shiny drill when I seek to pierce the heavens.
---
8 dragons would take almost 2 full minutes to reload without perks. (13 seconds each) 
---
One also occasionally spawns at bogtown? Can't remember name. Between the time travel tower and the saboteur barn.
---
As I said, being nowhere near ‘the end’ is the saving grace if you play the game minute by minute. But if you sat down and planned out ‘Ok, once I have become death and killed the big bad what do I do?’ it becomes very threadbare. The only solution is to play the game at a pace to match the telease cycle of brand new content, because the repeatable part of the game is a barren soulless grind. There are other games that devolve into an endless item stash&amp;grind bonanza but they manage to keep it engaging through gameplay and mechanics, if a game is carried primarily by atmosphere and storytelling then when that story ends it all falls apart. And that is mainly where Bethesda have failed in the live-service multiplayer arena.
---
I got my T-51b CS plans from Vendor Bot Phoenix in Watoga.
---
&gt;So now we are assholes for criticizing a game we paid $60 for on false promises?
---
No, you're an asshole because you're ruining the game for everyone by shitting on the people that happen to actually like the game, warts and all. 
---
You're an asshole because most of you aren't actually criticizing the game, you're throwing a temper tantrum and lashing out at everyone. 
---
You're an asshole because most of you don't actually care for the game and would rather see it die than get improved, just so you can get fallout 5 which will most likely, like every bethesda made game before it, come out just as buggy as the other four games.
---
You're an asshole because, rather than actually look at what your side is doing, the being a general douchebag over a fucking game as we can see by most of the comments here, you deflect it and go "ITS JUST CRITICISM!" when it really isn't, at least not constructive criticism. 
---
I could go on and on about why you people are assholes, but i doubt you'll even read this and just call me a fallout fanboy, despite the fact that i've said multiple times how much i despise Fallout 4 for the broken uninteresting shallow piece of shit that it actually was.

How did Beth throw them under the bus 
---
PS3 problems were due to its shitty experimental architecture that simply hit BGS games more than others, Sony dropped it like a flaming potato for the PS4 because it sucked that much.
---
Mods for FO4 were a pain with Sony because they refused to budge on protecting their super secret proprietary sound and texture file formats.
---
Beth is tight with MS because MS literally saved them. After Elder Scrolls 2 Beth did a ton of different types of games; racers, fighters, even a Terminator game they can’t really talk about because IP rights are weird.
---
But those didn’t sell and they were close to going under when MS approached them about making a launch window game for their first console. If MS didn’t help fund TES3: Morrowind they would likely not be around.
---
If Sony did that for a dev I’d expect that dev to be tight with them too.
---
Idk why I thought they said 4. My bad.
---
I have one is there something special about it that I'm missing
---
&gt;sales were lagging
---
You realize that if this IS true, you just confirmed we had a hand in it? Or do you think everyone here criticising the prices were all still buying everything?
---
In a vacuum, a good manager will always find someone else to blame for their terrible ideas not working out. But shit sales combined with widespread outcry about ridiculous prices, and that gives someone at Beth leverage to effect a change in policy.
---
It does make sense for the lore. Raider pa would have been made by hand after the war. If the person who made it was killed, its more than likely their armor would have been wrecked first.
---
They wouldn’t be able to exploit it if it wasn’t such a shitty game. It’s not like he’s using an exploit or whatever, he’s literally just aggroing a bunch of robots, the robots that bethesda put into whitesprings themselves.
---
Guys thank for all your replies and help, I’ve tried all your suggestions but nothing seemed to work. I searched on google and found someone with the same issue who stated he dropped all his Holotapes and it work. I tried it and it worked! I don’t know why but it seemed to reset and allowed me to load the Holotape.
---
And they thought it was fine. It's not their fault people spent $80 on tacky branded rum and were disappointed that the case looked *exactly* like it was originally advertised. 
---
Good idea.
---
When I first got this game I thought it was so easy I don’t think I died until level 25-30 (excluding beta because don’t remember that) 
---
And that was when I stumbled upon a scorch beast...
---
How far have all of you gone before dying?
---
I was running overencumbered and didn't drain AP one day, and I spent 20 minutes trying to figure out if running down hill was an actual way to conserve AP. But yah, it happens uphill as well. 
---
So I wonder if it calculates speed based on how far you move horizontally, and thinks you aren't running when on slopes because it can't take the angle into account? 
---
Its just funny because its useless
---
You can go to Charleston station and farm the grafton monster for lots of caps acid and oil
---
I can definitely relate I agree the minigun is weak in the base model. But I was lucky enough to trade for a TSE a few days ago. This new gun skin is just the icing on the cake of finishing my heavy gun build 
---
Bethesda basically told everyone that it was sony fault that mods were taking so long for fallout 4
---
Praise the Bomb and pass the ammunition!
---
Solution oriented point.  That's awesome and unlike a lot players (and non players) complaining out there.  Look folks, there are certain weapons that take down a scorch beast relatively fast.  You can all of them WITHOUT CHEATING (looking at you, dupers).  Buy the plans, craft the weapons, mod them, get the appropriate perk cards, kill the beasts, and ffs get over it
---
hey if your on ps4 and still have the cap, i’ll buy it and i not, where exactly did you find it ?
---
Well put, but no, I assume that people that sub to this page do not typically buy the over priced items. 
---
That being said I assume that under 10% of people who play 76 are active on this sub, so may were not aware that the prices were higher than they should be. I know a lot of non gamers here in WV who picked up 76. They have no frame of reference for what is a good or bad price for a cosmetic item. 
---
I got mine from the quest with Abbie’s Bunker 
---
I'm a casual player as I don't have all the free time in the world and just recently began visiting White Springs to farm for loot and xp and I've seen camps there three or four times already. One had missiles. All were just the floating platform camps. It's very irritating.
---
Pc, sorry. I believe it was a random spawn in the whitesprings
---
No, I was level 7, how am I gonna have a base with turrets lol
---
I am hoping at some point the genius in charge of giving orders to the artists lets them start making stuff we actually use
---
I mean good gawd don't they have metrics on the most used items or anything?
---
Maybe you are spending AP as fast as you are regenerating it because you are tracking enemies?
---
Accompany this with melee perk cards and you can have a solid defensive/attacking build.
---
Mutation Serums.
---
Or just hoarding for some inevitable future cap sink. For instance in Warframe, vet players had every mod maxed out, so why would they ever bother running weekly Ayatan quest for Endo (used to upgrade mods) anymore. Then the Sacrifice quest dropped, and there were suddenly 5 prime tier mods costing 200k endo or whatever to max out.
---
Yyyyyyes, but I feel like there's a pretty big gap between 4 and 10? I'll admit 4 is probably my limit, especially for a single-item purchase. 5 or 6 and I wouldn't even be considering it. As it is, not sure $4 is worth it for a gun only used for lulz.
---
Wasn’t that owing to exposure to radiation? Thought that’s why they went after folks from vaults
---
Fair enough i just know the turret bases there are a big problem and tend to annoy everyone. So they are quickly destroyed to stop it.
---
Wtf? Damn sounds like she has no damn health if there’s so few people 
---
I've played every day since beta launch, and I still haven't launched my own nuke. I've helped others do it, but I'm not in a hurry myself 😎
---
Right not
---
Each silo per server has its own cool down (3h) you can check this using the “mission silo state holotape”
---
Each player also has a personal cooldown timer per silo (3h) you have to keep track of this yourself...
---
As long as you wait for the queen to be killed from the first nuke, you can launch another right after and she will spawn again..
---
Thanks for the advice bro I think you're right.  
---
First day of beta I set up in a picnic pavilion on the hill above Flatwoods at the east side of the bridge and I'm still there. Not a great location re fast travel costs but I've customized it, it has everything I need and I like it.
---
There’s a spawn point in Gorge Junkyard, but it’s inside a locked semi trailer with a level 3 lock, so... yeah. 
---
two spawns i know of are Ingram Mansion and Seneca Gang Camp
---
ArchAngeisWrath I'll b on tomorrow and i have a lv 54 that I'm working on the story.  How far are you through it?
---
I was able to collect them during a nuke in the swamp. Not sure if the heart if darkness quest was going.
---
I mean you can kind of play moira with the whole flamer/healing perk
---
As a previous vault dweller stated "COMMUNISM HAS NO PLACE IN MY APPALACHIA" 
---
Well that answers that, but doesn’t dying (especially in a nuke zone) suck like extra hard
---
HHAHAHAHA my boyfriend and I play (separately because we only have one ps4 sadly) but if this doesn't describe him  I don't know what does.
---
Nope... Ultimately its a terrible system but as of now there's no way to tell if you have a plan or not besides physically seeing that you can or can't craft something while in the menu
---
Actually, no. The lighting is bad in all their screenshots and it's not great at the mansion, but what you saw was [the Gilded Minigun](https://imgur.com/gallery/lB0HKTg).
---
It's black with gold detailing. It's supposed to be that Hornwright's gun, but, don't be shocked now, it's bugged. The Gilded can still drop from mobs. Don't get your hopes up, it's capped at level 35 for some brilliant reason.
---
Again, screenshots are awful, but if you go into the Atom Shop and click to the second and third images, the chrome shine shows up a lot better. I dunno what intern they had make the product shot for the first image but someone should tell them it just looks matte black, lolsigh.
---
Rad shield does just fine 
---
I just became a volunteer lol I was farming fusion cores and shotgun shells a majority of the 5 hrs I have invested 
---
Not really,  no.  Not so far anyway. 
---
&gt; Sadly internet warriors rarely get anything accomplished.
---
Sadly? Thank *god* game devs ignore 90% of whatever the internet decides to be mad about. 
---
My gf seems to remember reading somthing like that in her lol lvls. 5 levels shouldn't be bad thanks for the help.
---
I agree, that was a bit of an unnecessary jab &gt;&lt;
---
Looks like the cats out of the bag.  Chameleon also works this way. I was hoping they would patch it before it became common knowledge.
---
Never have to worry about things like ammo, durability, meds, drugs, or material costs, can easily help others in a pinch with supplies and materials at no expenditure on my part, never have to fast travel back and forth to my base for any reason, get to see all the hidden unmarked spots along the roadway. There are a lot of perks to having lots of options. I don't even use the perks to increase weapon durability anymore aside from artisan when I do stop to repair.
---
I carry for reference, 2 50cal, 2 broadsiders, daisy cutter, bunker buster, 5 super sledges, 3 sledge hammers, an auto grenade launcher, 2 handmades, 2 assault rifles, a combat rifle, 4 dragons, 2 BP rifles, 3 bp pistols, 3 machetes, 2 gatling guns, a 10mm smg, 2 10mm pistols, 4 gatling plasmas, a plasma rifle, and a couple other odds and ends. I got more hammers than most people have weapons, and can out last and outshoot a whole horde without any sort of worry about weapons breaking. And repairs are simple when you strip anything not bolted down, then get out your bolt gun to unbolt things to take the floor they're bolted to.
---
There are really only 2 major downsides, I can't easily get to rare events, and I can't fight the scorchbeast queen unassisted. As in it takes me so long to get from the silo to site prime the fight is already over one way or the other, not that I can't spawn her for other people, I can run fivesilo runs back to back without having to use any form of workbench other than tinkers to repair those computer cores in the fifth(?) area to open the door. You need someone to get you to the launch room I will do it handily, only need help fixing the pipes in the reactor, being slow and on a time limit is my only weakness. Once you get there I need a head start leaving to get to the drop zone is all.
---
I keep running into bots that ask me for repairs. Im a bleeding heart so I repair them with some scrap. I get a reward and their thanks, then they get maybe like two steps away from me...then die. So depressing... 
---
&gt; No, you're an asshole because you're ruining the game for everyone by shitting on the people that happen to actually like the game, warts and all.
---
I haven't shit on any people, and this is the second time I've been called an asshole for criticizing the game.  Are you blind to your hypocrisy?
---
I hope my luck doesnt run out then, I'd be one to take out the turrets methinks.
---
 The problem is expecting an end game when the game isn't meant to end and your aren't supposed to race to boredomville. Those that blew through the content only have themselves to blame. Wow taught people bad habits. Taught people too race and grind to get the gear needed to do new current which gives better gear for the next content. Well what if that's not how this game is going to play out? What if new content just means new themed gear. New weapons and such balanced to what's already in the game. Still want to race to "end game"?
---
Seriously...racing to end game is like trying to eat an entire package of Oreos and somehow skipping all the filling from the cookies. No wonder those players are grumpy. 
---
The rumors are good and bad, reminds me of secrets in games back in the day. Yes that is a good method I was just doing that.
---
Hey hey hey I'll unlock my doors but no touchie my purified water, that's how I make caps
---
I'm not too far ahead I saved the story missions for after lv 50 to get max level quest rewards so once you get a quest to follow madigan's trail that's where I'm at.  Like I said I'll b able to play all day tomorrow so if your on just send me an invite.
---
I had the same thought, I was so excited to see the tag updated to Heavy Metal... and then saw nothing remotely what I had expected. 
---
“I’m, too sexy for this trench, too sexy for the trench, too sexy...”
---
Hey, the trolls can't bitch about the game itself anymore because it's actually kinda fun and good. They have to take their hits where they can...
---
I never do stuff like what I'm about to mention. I logged of the game while I was at golf club before I went to bed. When I logged in the next day I figured I would kill a few ghouls before fast traveling back to my camp. Of course there was a camp right there at the back of the golf course. I decided just to go to a different server and try again. Now I know the odds of logging in to 2 servers with camps at the back of the golf course back to back are really low, or so I thought. Nope same scenario. So I noticed he was afk in his camp. Not wanting a bounty I decided to nuke the golf course and his camp and him all in one go. By the time I launched the nuke he was no longer at his camp, but it was still at the golf club. In hind sight, though it felt good to do, it didn't really do much. It took me more time and energy to prove my point than it did him to fix his camp.
---
This made my harlequin heart happy. 
---
If anything you can role play as a ghoul with a raspy ass voice
---
That's interesting. I'd assume that a non-gamer unfamiliar with cosmetic micro would be less receptive to cosmetic prices tho ("I just bought this game and now they want another ten bucks for one single item? WTF"). How did they react to the Atom Shop? Have they gotten anything?
---
Do you have to reload each bullet separately? Imagining a Quad Dragon...
---
What choices do you make? The actual effect are minimal. Usually the difference between killing a group of raiders or not killing them.  All you do with NPCs is click on talk then run though all their dialogue then go off to do what ever mission they have. The exact same with tapes. 
---
This. Sell the duped weapons for caps, then sell caps for real cash. 
---
&gt; farm for lead all day 
---
If you haven't yet, take a suit of excavator PA through Lucky Hole Mine and you should end up with tons of lead.  You'll have to craft it at the chem bench afterwards but Super Duper makes it a good time.  
---
The last time I went through there and then crafted the lead I think I ended up with 750 as a result.
---
Game isn't empty there is plenty to do. Events, quests, explorations, base building, helping new players out. 
---
The barn behind silva homestead occasionally has several bags of chlorine.
---
Broken on Jan 8th
---
This is the best story on the subreddit, change my mind.
---
Dont forget to pick up a Tech Data from the bank of desks before Command stairwell
---
Ba dum, tiss \*rimshot\*
---
I keep my doors locked to keep mobs out while I am trying to craft shit.
---
Up top in full view is every crafting station along with a stash box for anybody to use.
---
Yes please.  Make it so that any recipes you know already are GRAYED OUT in vendors, bags, and when you're trading with players.  That would make life soooo much easier for a completionist like myself....lol
---
 The whole in-game recent players is either bugged or misleading, I’m starting to think it’s in fact not recent but a log of the current players you are playing with as it lists everyone on the server, and greys out the people who leave, or their name disappears.
---
but it still doesn’t work as intended  if it’s actually a recent player log because when you leave the server that list wipes, so that’s kinda why I begun to think it was actually just a list of who you are playing with but I don’t actually know, it just makes sense.
---
To answer your question, yeah I don’t use that it’s just based on remembering certain individuals in the game lobby and messaging through PSN asking if they are still on the same server, it’s all luck. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn’t. It’ll be this way until Bethesda decides to spend 20 minutes fixing bugs such as the recent player list instead of 20 minutes on atomic shop skins.
---
In fallout 4 we could eject fusion cores for a small nuclear explosion
---

---
It actually worked for me the other day. I play on xbox so maybe it's different per platform 
---
This is my bloodied melee build probably could be better I use power armor and also get Emergency protocols mod on your power armor
---

---
I’ve thought of a piratey character as well, I’m glad to see it works - I won’t be able to use a broadsider so I’ll just carry more pistols!
---
Hahhahaa yea sure Bethesda will 100% try to program complex thing like that. Land on earth dude
---
 let's not do that. Try to keep it somewhat lore friendly. 
---
We need raider themed stuff in the store
---
They do both from what I have seen online. People have been selling game currency and items for over 2 decades so that will never stop. 
---
thank you for saying the ones with turrets i build my camp on one of the streams cause it looks nice but i have 0 turrets i don't believe in the zombie spam
---
True that.... until I got explosive weapons gutsys were my most hated foe even on my melee toon.
---
Of course I want to build my own vault/bunker, it's to get the hell away from other players. :)
---
I was thinking this exactly.
---
Just because they try doesnt mean anyone actually buys it, there is no reason to buy caps at all so I'd like so see someone who actually would be stupid enough to have bought caps for real money xD
---
I miss this and i would love to see perks more or less changing up gameplay over just % increases. Throw them in some passive type tree system.
---
&gt; I haven't shit on any people
---
You may not have. But many, if not most, of the detractors of this game have. 
---
&gt;You take any criticism of the game as a personal attack on yourself
---
I'm not taking any criticism as a personal attack. I'm saying that most of you aren't actually giving criticism, but rather throwing a temper tantrum. That's clear from r/fallout and even these very comments on this post. 
---
It's true, while SBs suck to fight and usually drop crap, they DO have a drop table with the end game gear (prime plans) on it.
---
I gotta kill 4 more for officer on deck....
---
Just get TSE weapons 4head
---
Seriously. I hate walking in a field of grass and then suddenly falling into a trench I didn’t see. They’re all over that damn place. Yes I know marsupial will let me hop right out, I don’t have it cause I am putting off farming it.
---
That's basically true, and for the love of God! Keep away from Radium rifles, I had to learn the hard way! :)
---
Has this been a recent occurrence because I could swear I would’ve noticed this if it’s been since launch
---
 good night ;)
---
 a little song just for you [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7j8wa9sWOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7j8wa9sWOE)
---
Considering the amount of spawns at the golf course and the amount of Legendaries the whole area should be camp free
---
I think most people go for targetting HUD, but it's pretty underwhelming to be honest
---
I lucked out last night at a fissure and they seemed to land when I put them in "caution" status with my stealth melee build and then I punched them to death before they took off (about 8 blows per)
---
My reward for killing 4 of them? 
---
A legendary level 30 double barrel shotgun that did a bonus 10% damage if I was mutated.  
---
I actually got better loot from a legendary super mutant in the blast zone that gave me a mediocre plasma gattling gun. 
---
Other than the excitement that I could finally kill a SB it quickly changed to disappointment when my first experience of killing not one, not two, not even three, but four beasts and pretty much all I really had to show for it that was worth the time was a chunk of XP
---
Awesome 
---
People in general do dumb shit all the time. "What harm will it do if I just do it this one time?"
---
Hah, I got killed by someone 170 levels below me in four hits whereas I could barely damage him. It wasn't even worth the ammo trying. So the PVP just gets worse as you get higher level.
---
Chameleon has to be equipped. I’ve never had it make me go invisible when in inventory and not equipped.
---
The best you could get is a peaceable door like a trap door and it would give you a room to build in that's in a separate cell. 
---
I don't think they can modify the base world geometry like that.
---
Um no its not hard to level into the 200-300 area at the moment. You should be wondering this about the 800+ players.
---
No the game sucks go to RDR2
---
Play with a group. If you have people to bs around with, it actually isn't that bad
---
Get friends, it's better with friends.
---
Team up with people, do random things, help newbies, PVP.
---
In my Bestiary scroll there are elusive Zetan Aliens amongst our nutrient radiated world. It's definitely for the kind hearted lvl 52 Zetan Star Admirals max out at Base Health: 550, Dmg Resistance: 50,  Energy Resistance: 100, Radiation Resistance: 250 happy travels. 
---
 I noticed it last month. 
---
This is everyone’s issue from the beta even. Notice from the vault tomorrow hopefully this and all the dupers get fixed next patch 
---
Valid points and all too true.
---
I'm saying that since they're changing the entire Fallout series dynamic by moving it online, they should look at multiplayer friendly mechanics, not single player as in the past games.
---
There are countless examples in other online games with leads they could follow and even improve upon.
---
I have. I don't know why it started it but I did report it.
---
Honestly it would've got you in by now if it was going to sorry. It just doesn't appeal to everyone. I think people feel a little less engaged with quests without NPCs. I love the game, but it really isn't for everyone.
---
...I....do not have this. How does one get this?
---
We still have that...have you run into the mr nanny with the stories uggh
---
At first glance I thought your title said long dong.
---
I do an orbital strike on them. Fun to see it happen. 
---
OK so who wants to crash the server?
---
All we have to do is get everyone together and meet up at the restaurant and sit down. Lets see if Mr Waiter goes Short Circuit Johnny 5 on us or not
---
Jesus I messed up gained over 300 in bounty 3 times today doing this record some events glorious ones lol and aware !!!!
---
Bounty Caps come out your pocket so yeah I gave away a bounty the last time to a level 15 he must felt awesome to take me down lol
---
Nope. It is what it is .. a survival game, you need to constantly replenish shit and do the same shit over and over because you have no space to store extras, if however you find a way to engineer a fun time along the way great stick around. Playing with people makes it easier or the lure of females around the bend or over the hill but mainly it's up to you
---
Not that reality is important in fallout but don’t you think it’d be a little silly to see a person harpoon a fucking dragon and pull it out of the sky
---
I thought that this was a thing, but I had a perk card active with a very similar effect
---
The game (as in the designed immersive story) is absolutely meant to end, and to have an endgame. There is a final main quest, a definitive ‘tour quest log is now empty ‘ moment. There is a repeatable ‘mission’ that offers the most sought after rewards. You sau WoW taught people bad habits, well Bethesda went right ahead and added in a repeatable daily/weekly system for people to keep on grinding. It is designed with a ‘story over now go grind’ gameplay loop but it falls miles short on the engaging features that make an item grinder enjoyable. 
---
It would almost be better if there wasn’t an endgame so we could all go, oh ok the story is over just like every other fallout game, once you do the big deed that’s kind of it. But nope, there is this faint whiff of an attempt at repeatable grinding that is made so laborious by the godawful combat system that is almost a trademark of fallout games at this point (the engine does not lend itself to gunplay). And the first time a quest sends you to Radroach Central Terminal 5 it might scratch the itch when you find all the well placed environment decor, but when you get sent there the 10th time to splat 10 legendary roaches for 40 atoms? Or the 100th time you trudge to Whitesprings to empty your entire stash of ammo for a roll on a plan for better ammo? Maybe if actually using that ammo in itself felt satisfying but again, back to the trademark clunky combat system.
---
Actually, I haven't played since November, I want some reasons to go back and play it. I should've mentioned that earlier, sorry.
---
Dont get hit by a ghoul, and dont use decontamination showers
---
That'll be 10 caps
---
Thats amazing haha
---
I hate to say this man but this game is not for everyone even for past Fallout fans. You gotta love survival / explore esk type games.
---
The locations and the quests are pretty well done. But it might just not be your liking. 76 is very very different from past Fallout games.
---
While i love the game it's easy to see why others may not. I believe Todd even said the game would not be for everyone. If someone could pull up that video and link it here.
---
Try the Scan &amp; Repair option on the launcher, might help.
---
This is the problem with simply raising the weapon level cap, explosive is just broken. A l30 explosive shotgun will crap over any level 50 non-explosive weapon you care to mention.
---
I’m playing on Xbox
---
Do you have the electrically charged mutation? Things with a crackly sound effect crash some people...showers, firecracker berries, Tesla rifles etc..not sure of the fix though sorry, but you could try this https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a37rrn/crash_to_desktop_fix_for_pc/ Don't use it myself and have no idea if it works, just reposting it.
---
They did have an adverse reaction to the atom at first, but I explained that the DLC was free, so they at least understand why the items are there.  Also I explained (though now it seems I explained incorrectly since my atom income has almost fome to a stop) that they could get atoms by just playing the game.   I do not know if they have spent extra money on the game though.
---
I want something cute maybe kitty ears or something  some flowery paint job 
---
Nope, 1 lengthy reload for all 4 bullets. 
---
I have played it, and it's a very good game, but I think we should go to the topic on hand.
---
Exactly :)
---
Sounds like a great excuse to make a black powder weapon build.
---
Nope 
---
No I only have speed demon and carnivore
---
COMMIE
---
That is amazing!  I have started the mistress of mysteries line and I'm at that ramped up part...
---
...reminds me of Rathalos
---
EXCEPT I CAN'T FLASHBOMB SCORCHBEAST
---
I do enjoy survival games, it's one the reasons I got it, an online survival version of Fallout sounded fun to me, maybe it's just that I haven't really played with people that much.
---
&gt; I'm not taking any criticism as a personal attack. I'm saying that most of you aren't actually giving criticism, but rather throwing a temper tantrum. That's clear from r/fallout and even these very comments on this post.
---
Yet the only comments attacking people are those of your own, calling me an asshole for criticizing the game being a poor value and falsely advertised.  "16 times the level of detail" is a good start when almost all of the assets are the same 100% from fallout 4
---
Thanks for your thoughts.
---
You provoked the idea that two shot is perfect for Radiums lack of ballistic damage. Itll be closer to 100 per shot than any non twoshot, and then the rad damage is just bonus to anything that takes it.
---
The biggest problem is that there isn't really "ground" to dig into. The ground is a pixel thick with an empty space underneath. I would think it would be somewhat more complicated than it sounds.
---
It might work out alright if you had a "room" you could build. Once inside the room, you could have a list of other rooms you could add onto it. It would have to be entirely enclosed at all times, or else you will have access the the undermap.  
---
Then again, I have always wished I could kill those a\*\*hat molerats that don't want to come up and play.
---
Xbox I should edit it
---
They're not even that hard to kill. I've killed them before with a Level 1 Pipe Gun. 
---
The main problem is that you can't see when their screaming at you with their explosive projectiles. In addition, sometimes their AI makes them do nothing but constantly scream at you. I thing the AI and the projectiles need to be tweaked. I suggest you get yourself a better build / weapons in the meantime.
---
Ive lived on the golf course before it was cool (beta) because the grass is so pretty but i have a proper camp with turrets for my safety and leave doors unlocked as a refuge as no mobs can get up the stairs to my place .. cant remember if my purifier is unlocked  but if it is i will unlock it cuz wth its only water
---
That’s almost worse! Kinda funny though.
---
Uh... yeah, it's randomized.  Almost all games are.  What's your point?  The bottom line is that the request here, ultimately, is to be getting more loot.  This game needs the opposite of more loot.
---
You can melee VATS hit them, no critical needed.  I keep a combat on me for these fearsome long dogs.
---
Solo is really fun as well i am only level 119 and i still find alot of fun though through helping others and grinding nuke zones.
---
No harm in it if the game is not grabbing ya. I don't think anything we say can change that. Heck i prefer this game over RDR2 and i know alot of the gaming community would heavily disagree with that.
---
I've been in on killing her three times now since the game came out and all three times it has been utter fucking shite. Just garbage. Instantly sold at Watoga for like 3 caps.
---
Well hell, I've never even seen reference to this gun. I wonder how many other surprises are locked behind bugs or silly decisions? It's been a while since I visited that mansion, but I don't recall seeing the barrels gold though. I just remember a shiny black body. I'll look into it though
---
Late to the party, but when you say that two shot effectively doubles the total damage what do you mean exactly since only one pellet is added?
---
Yeah that was my first thought but I would imagine it could be possible to add another layer underneath the map. But I know very little with game design lol.
---
Sometimes, I got nothing but a rotating refresh sign. And then, the body just disappeared.
---
They buy plans, or rare building materials, or ammo, or legendaries they dont already have.
---
&gt;plays fallout 76
---
&gt;complains that it’s a shit game 
---
&gt;o my combat shotgun with legendary armor ignore and superior piercing mag... doesn't need the piercing mag? I am sorry I am slow. Am I helping my gun or gimping my gu
---
it depends on enemy's armor. your damages not reached 4.8 times then enemy's armor, then you still gain full benefit from of piercing magazine.
---
When you say you saw it by yourself there is no credence to your statement because there is no witness or picture proof.
---
Yup as someone that loves this game, agree 100x.
---
They are the antithesis of fun. 
---
I have X-01 shocks and I’m just missing the one violet flux to craft. Not crafting until I get it.
---
Can’t. Won’t. This is fucking cool, A+ OC.
---
I was confused and forgot to take a pic from it but there is a paint job
---
I still need one violet flux to craft my X-01 shocks.
---
That’s funny because I’m level 60 and every time I go I get level 9-22 
---
If you follow ANY social media post of anything associated with Fallout (twitter facebook etc), it’s angry fanboys taking jabs at the game. Once they started attacking Pete on his personal twitter over his personal life, I can’t blame him for taking a twitter sabbatical. 
---
I was talking based purely off fallout 4, idk if they changed it here or not. It seems like some things have been changed so two shot could have very well also been changed because of how messy it was. It seems that two shot does provide damage that's about double even for shotguns, and somehow that damage is calculated to provide that. By now somebody has probably tested this thoroughly and figured it out, but that person is not me
---
Yep, I have seen some one with a 2k bounty that I kid you not they had because some ass hat had a tower camp near the big spawn. Just spewed rockets into it every time apparently it was a hacker as you can't built 20 turrest on a camp or build camps that close.  
---
Either way no one tried to take that bounty. 
---
I absolutely love the mention/ use of the flare gun. It’s something I always hope will happen, to see one and answer the call, or to fire one on my lowbie character and have some hardcore badasses show up and rain death. 
---
Ah okay, I just didn’t know if you had some first-hand experience with this in 76 as I’m very curious. Cheers
---
Make a melee build. Less resources less grinding. Having a blast smacking shit. 
---
Don't you think it's a little silly that a dragon exists at all in fallout?
---
Lol, I also had a wall, floating all by itself, not attached to any floor, foundation or anything that couldn't be removed because something would be inaccessible. Go figure. 
---
Nah, I take 'em down pretty easy with armor piercing ranged weapons.
---
Pffft blue smurfs. Still, must say the read was entertaining 
---
watoga just out side AMS building near the downed vertibird
---
there were a couple really high levels like level 100's so i wonder if they were buffed up or something 
---
&gt; Also Stewart's original hotdogs are so much better than those gourmet dogs they serve at Hill Billy hotdogs  
---
T&amp;L has been around for a while, too, and they're pretty good. I was a little surprised that King Tut (or a variation) didn't make it into Beckley.
---
Ok thanks. I'm not sure I'll be on tomorrow due to work but I'll add ya when i am
---
why can't u access ur pipboy while on ur bed...
---
Do you guys not have a phone?
---
Do we know whether the Luck stat affects lot drops out not? I took with 14 lick and I feel like I do ok, but i don't know any different. I also have never killed the queen, so idk.

Heads up, with Xbox you can both get Live access and play digital games with only one digital copy. Sounds like her account is the oldest account, so use hers as the one that "owns" the games. On your Xbox, log into her account and set your Xbox as her "home Xbox". Now anyone that signs into your Xbox gets Live access and access to her games *without* her needing to be signed in. In her Xbox, anyone (her account included) gets Live access and access to her games as long as she is signed in. This way you only pay for Live and games once, but both of you get access to them. Also let's you share Game Pass games too. It works because each account gets 2 licenses for everything, one for your "Home Xbox", and one for a guest Xbox. "Home Xbox" doesn't require her account to be signed in, guest Xbox does require her to be signed in. She always plays on her Xbox, and you on yours, and there's no issue at all. My wife and I have been doing this basically since Xbox One was first released. My brother let me set my Xbox as his "Home Xbox" so I could play RDR2 for free. 😀
---
Get gud son!!! .... sorry it was building up in me
---
Monorail elevator was pretty incredible when I stumbled upon it. Cool idea, great view.
---
try hopping prison and then fastravel to the dam. rinse and repeat. thats what i did bak in the day.
---
Kinda they just spawn at the level of who ever was there before you seems. If I go when there are no meat piles usually they spawn at the right level 
---
i just did that *chuckles* im in danger
---
I’ve just left Shitesprong (typed it wrong but I’m not going to correct it because it sounds hilarious) and there were hundreds of robots - even dupes of the unique ones. 
---
Am I missing something? Why were there loads, how are they doing it and why are they doing it?
---
Likely because the answer is “we told the sales people this was a problem, and they told us to ship the game.”
---
Not really considering the other monsters in the game like centaurs, mirelurks and giants hermit crabs
---
New to the game, can somebody explain?
---
Had all the teddy bears altogether they weigh close to 75 pounds lol
---
Personally, I think the best solution is far easier. It's been too long and too botched to do any of the things they should have done in the first place, like boot them all, so now the only good solution is to just identify those who have duped items, and relegate them to duper-specific servers.... 
---
They get to keep playing and slow walking around with a bunch of other players that have no need to buy their shit, but they can still power through any enemy or endgame content. Any server slowdowns/issues they experience are their cost of doing business, and they can play the game the way they like without fucking everyone else via pvp or economy. 
---
The rest of us can play non-dupe servers without the allegedly dupe related glitches, and play the way we want without getting shot in the face by TSE shotguns. 
---
This is awesome. Never knew that was possible. Thanks so much!
---
Do tell :)
---
ORBITAL STRIKE
---
I always go to Monongah Power or whatever, there is a set that spawns directly inside one of the doors (facing north, has yellow light above it I think). Its just a stones throw from Morgantown, which is a pretty early destination and I don't recall the enemies being too overwhelming.  
---
Worst part is it generally starts up the stupid event which I have no interest in a majority of the time.   
---
I've seen it spawn at the mine near The Whitespring as well, which I'd say even a low level could sneak in there and nab it real quick without too much fuss from the Mole Miners. 
---
Gotta get that mirv 2 shot fatman man 
---
RDR2 dropped to like $35 for Black Friday, and it came out a week before 76.
---
Sounds like it’s related to taking/removing rads. Have you tried to see what happens if you take a Radaway?
---
Also ye olde classic, exit game and reload?
---
Yeah ik people like to build camps there because of the grass 
---
Well *that*'s gonna get fixed, how that hasn't been fixed already is incomprehensible to me.
---
I mean I don't mind it now that I know, but still.
---
Wow did teach people bad habits. Not just players, but devs as well. Suggestions is how we tell the devs in what way to better the game. To evolve it to its full potential. 
---
And the game doesn't end. I'm sorry you or anyone else raced through it all and ran out of shit to do. You're fault. More content is coming. If you paced yourself, then you'd never run out if shit you do. Again your fault for racing through content. 
---
End game content was designed as basically a hamster wheel. Something to keep you guys busy while the devs worked on new content. Then you all got whiny because you did all that running on the wheel and wanted a prize. 
---
No, I understand that, but earlier it sounded like it was said that you could learn a mod from scrapping even if it was. I equipped.
---
So why would grappling a big thing down to the ground silly when we have all this other weird shit going on
---
That quest is horrid. Out of my numerous visits there and hundreds of ghouls killed, I am only at 4/10 required.
---
All done ?
---
They're annoying, but they're not that hard to get rid of if you can get into a building.
---
If they can't shoot you with their sonic blast for some reason, they'll get bored and leave after a little while.  Seriously, they'll just fly away (off the map?).  Even an outhouse with an intact door or a porta-potty will work.
---
I think the sonic blast spam is a bug, though.
---
I think of it as only 1,000 Atoms for the business cut in the front, and just 1,000 Atoms for the party cut in the rear.  Deal!
---
Yes I have and it doesn’t crash the game
---
I built mine on the road behind the golf club amazing place, 7/10 dermatologist recommend the location.
---
Personally i love the game.. Sucks to suck I guess 😂
---
Chrome Excavator
---
that's my charge. 
---
Human ones yes that comes later. If you played FO4 though there are quite a few ghouls that didn’t turn feral and lived the full 200 years since. I am sure they will add wandering ghoul traders just from knowing that. 
---
oh that explains why then 
---
We should use machetes tbh
---
Forward station alpha, near Watoga station and a fissure site almost always has t60 for me.
---
That's right. It can be a bare bone item and you still have a chance of learning a mod.
---
I saw these last night. PS4 
---
Because a flying dragon is much stronger than a human man/woman
---
Not half as bad as the cliff racers in Morrowind (ESIII not the online thing).
---
I managed to crawl up to 6 but haven't been able to go further. Don't even know if it is possible now that I'm such high level :(
---
Higher INT gives you more Max Condition on the items you craft.  Useful when you go to craft your power armor mainly.
---
i can sell you them too but i get on a plane in 4 hours LUL. so i'll be back in two weeks to start my merching up again and yeah i'm on PC
---
Very helpful thanks!
---
Yeha I always look at the person who has the bounty before killing them 
---
The whitesprings golf club has a huge density of high level ghouls, which have a decent chance of being legendary, so it's a popular place for people to farm if they don't enjoy actually playing the game. Putting a camp with turrets next to it is a real asshole move because it lags everybody's game, provides a much higher risk of crashing the server, and steals kills to NOBODY's benefit. Even the player who built the camp doesn't get xp/loot from the ghouls unless they damage the ghouls first. 
---
so far in my testing it only applies to you using flamers, not base parts.
---
That's how Mafia works
---
Which tree?
---
Thanks for your response! Let me double check for you! 
---
Thanks! I was basing my statement on saving weight for lead since that was what I was dealing with at the time.
---
Looking at several other materials, not lead or aluminum, the weights do seem to match up.
---
Although, using up the plastic to make bulk items makes it just a smidge more efficient.
---
The moral of the story, I guess, is just dump all the excess mats unless you’re looking to sell to make caps.
---
Yeah, if any part of the blast can pass through a hole or gap, it can potentially hit you.
---
Thank you!
---
I've heard rumor that they give more experience gained, that they let you craft higher durability items. But you know how rumors can be, out in the wasteland.
---
Is there a perk specific for crafting like the civil war era stuff like there is for the crossbow? Because it’s not anywhere in the armor station
---
Yeah if they surround me and I’m nowhere near a building to go into so that I can fast travel away or I’m not doing some sort of objective per say...
---
I just dashboard and restart the app, probably would be more beneficial to just pause and exit the world but that’s how annoyed I am when they spawn 
---
Wait really?
---
Serendipity doesn’t work for explosions, apparently. Someone data mined it.
---
I do it solo all the time without power armor or VATs. I’ve got my damage resistance up in the high 300s and an armor piece that mitigates damage from robots by 15%. For weapons I use two: a regular pump shotgun (Enforcer 3, Skeet Shooter 1, long barrel) that I use to cripple and a two-shot handmade for dps. The shotgun is fantastic for blowing the legs off of Assaultrons, then destroying their lasers by shooting them in the face. I just leave them to crawl around doing nothing. Hacker 3 is a must for me for turning off the turrets in each room. Also Picklock 3 will apparently let you skip the reactor room.
---
I thought I was getting that(that thinner inner line that runs to the right) with my maxxed out "fix it good!" perk cards. 
---
Do you mean the overall wider condition bar? 
---
Love it!
---
Also, can mods not deposit before actual junk when we do store all junk? I'm sick of constantly having to remove the same mods so i can cram another 8 lbs of junk in there.
---
I recall reading somebody had put a terminal inside to operate the switch outside.  
---
They should bring back logic gates from FO4, as that made it easy as hell to accomplish. 
---
Southeast of the train station that is there, a bit before you get to the road intersection
---
Ask your mom
---
If the game doesn’t end why is there ‘endgame’ content at all? That’s just either wilfully ignorant or a lie. There is a definitive final quest, an end to the existing story. All games have a finite ‘on the rails ‘ experience and through the basic laws of the universe that story becomes a smaller and smaller percentage of your playtime compared to the time spent in the endgame unless you make the conscious decision that you are going to play the game less so that you don’t hit that endgame. But why would you do that? Is it because it is boring? Well that’s a crippling design flaw in a game that is designed to push you into an endgame.
---
Don't feed the trolls.
---
Sorry for the late response, had to call off the whole thing. Work comes early tommorow for me. I'll let you know when though. 
---
When I went there today, being level 16 or 17, it was filled with level 40 scorched. I thought, “This practice huh must be really good.” I was wrong. I blew threw my 10mm ammo (I didn’t have much because I threw a lot out b/c it weighed me and my stash down) and my throwing knives (What I was using to actually make a considerable dent in their health). I was rushed and retreated black while stopping to stand my ground and repeat. I died. Seeing that it was a bug made me very relieved. I’ll just try again tomorrow. 
---
huh intresting i have a terminal outside ill try switching see if that helps.. and yes they should 
---
And give us stairs without railings
---
through wall conduit and 2 switches.
---
What also annoys me is that they comment on posts where someone build a cool C.A.M.P. or so. The game has some big problems atm I think we can all agree on that so they should imo only take a look at the complaints.
---
first thing i bought in less than a minute
---
The roaming vendor bot has a chance to have in his inventory. He randomky spawns right outside Charleston station. You can look a a quick video on YouTube for the exact location and turn around spot.
---
They don't give experience though. Not like murdering bots in Watoga. 
---
where would i put conduit? outside or inside?
---
That's a very vague weapon list. Croquet mallet is a skin for the super sledge. Camden whacker is a version of the commie whacker. Musket could be the blackpowder rifles, pistols, and blunderbuss.
---
PC?
---
Maybe YOUR man/woman, but mine is a hulking, mutated beast with an effective STR of 22.
---
He cam eriding from the south side slowly looking all around
---
I don't think you can do a true 2 way, but you can do 2 master ons or a master on just on the inside. You could use a keypad for the outside to lock it.
---
Even that’s hard to do when your fuckin’ character is constantly over encumbered haha
---
&gt;Game keys go for 17-27€ max these days. I try to look on the bright side and picked up an extra copy for my brother.
---
Many of those keys are bought with stolen credit cards and resold by people looking for quick cash. You can't base prices on shady gray market sites. 
---
Will it only auto-scrap mods that produce steel? Because some mods scrap into other mats.
---
Persistant servers would solve the mule issue.
---
You know who knows about that your mom :D
---
You get the recipe and 3 Radshield by following the quest line in the Mire that requires you to go to the abandoned bunkers (can’t remember exactly which one it’s called), relatively easy quest other than the 1 Deathclaw you have to kill.
---
Yeah i see em all the time. Use em to make Stable flux. You mostly get them from nuke zones tho. So idk why they’re there 🤔 
---
The plans for it only appear between levels 15-44, I think it starts at 15 but may be wrong. I know level 44 is the last time you can find it outside of an event which almost never pops up. Found this out weeks ago and was salty since I was around 115 at the time. If you want it, do what I did. Make a new character and level it to around 15-18, transfer caps to that character and server hop at harper's ferry or Watoga until it pops up. Also level up Charisma on the new character and take on Hard Bargain to make it way cheaper to buy.
---
I’m level 63 all the scorchedbeasts that ever spawn on me are always lvl 80, sometimes there’s 2 of them
---
Organic solution quest in the mire, Ella Ames. 
---
Sorry, no, I should have specified earlier, PS4. 
---
I put a sight on my 5mm gataling gun to help with aim the it points waaaay off when you go into sight mode. Sight on the harpoon gun works well though.
---
it don't really matter, but I usually put it on the side the power source is.
---
Did you take over a workshop?
---
ahhh i just noticed my typo in my title and i cant change it
---
Timed events, think fast...
---
Would guess so. 
---
I did not. 
---
In case you still need it for the other character. Small letter set can drop from defense event at the ammo factory. A few others do too but I've seen it there the most.
---
I've found that golf balls laying around in Whitesprings are a good source of plastic. Also, the gym at the Overseer's high school has a shitload of plastic plates in it.
---
2 switches won't give you a 2 way though. Switches only have an on or off state and won't switch states depending on the input state
---
At Garhon mining HQ there is a terminal in the area with the pa stations try looking at that again
---
Try hard resetting your console. Hold the power button til it turns off then unplug wait 30 seconds or so then plug it back in. 
---
I would go one step further. Once the duping problem has been fixed just do away with the explosive legendary perk. Have it be replaced with a random roll on the gun you currently have. Maybe in the future bring it back once they tone it down, or replace it with something else. Honestly I would like to see more weapons like the perfect storm.
---
Hell they could even make players, and player made structures immune to it's effects.
---
Once I hit endgame i'll probably put the game down (unless new content rolls out before then, which at this rate it will). Because even traditional MMO endgames bore the hell out of me, im not into the whole grinding for epic equipment, or PVP, or anything like that, I like F76 because its Fallout with multiplayer, its not an MMO
---
Go get on your wheel hamster. They'll being you your treat later. 
---
I think he meant laser musket, and that’s not in the game 
---
If one piece has taught me anything horses are next
---
Ok I will try it when my game reinstalls
---
Power gates work the best as a “timed” power switch. I have a crazy door system. Come see it sometime! 
---
You can. It take a little work though. This is my camp. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6uttbrES8Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6uttbrES8Q)
---
I was considering redownloading the game after I rage quit that shit but Ill wait until 2-3 patch will be out
---
Just load up like you are Charlie Sheen.
---
hmm havent tried that and the keypad is trash they only have one beside the door one and anyone can open it even without knowing keypad 
---
I like to sell off the junk that bulks into cheaper bundles (like under 60) and collect basically as much as i possibly can of the more expensive ones.
---
I also stay over encumbered, so maybe I'm not the best to be giving advice. That next stash limit increase can't come fast enough!
---
I agree with the title of the thread. But ask your mom
---
That's a real shame.
---
Very weird list huh? It's almost gibberish. 
---
My husband and I tried couple days ago and couldn’t do it, so next time we’d welcome the help. Psn Linzsays 
---
They are at least some what responsible for it. It's still mostly Bethesdas fault.
---
I’m a very sad console user right now. 
---
12 strength and power armor on in order to be able to use it.  Otherwise, yes that sounds epic as long as it comes with some sweet animations.  Could you imagine yanking a scorchbeast to the ground like a post apocalyptic cowboy in Morgantown when all the new players see one for the first time?
---
As a Gatling gun user I hate them with a massive passion. 
---
It's not super rare, I've found two pieces for it on my own, if you can make mutations serums it's pretty easy to get caps and then trade for the rest of the pieces.
---
Supposedly grants more scrap when scrapping junk. And it grants bonus durability as the White Overcondition bar that you can’t replenish with Lucky Break/Luck of the Draw, and normal repairing won’t bring it back either. So, think of Int as giving you the same effect as Fix it Good and Weapon Artisan except is when you create something. Fun note: armor and melee weapons get bonus stats with the Overcondition, and get more of a bonus the more you get.
---
This is relatively useless. Unless you like crafting cheap melee weapons and then scrapping them when they lose their white bar. But here are some uses:
---
- bonuses are static, so they make all those “very fast” melee weapons grind through enemies a *lot* faster. Other fast melees benefit too, like combat knives and Bowie knives.
---
- cheap armor like heavy leather or light combat armor. Scrap it when the white bar is gone and craft some more!
---
You need 20 Int to create as much white bar as the repair perks when they are maxed (200%). I don’t know what happens when you go beyond 20...perhaps that will be my test tomorrow.
---
Why don’t you go and ‘suggest’ to Bethesda that the endgame is so shit that you are actively avoiding finishing the main game so that you don’t encounter it?
---
If you set it up so it’s power to inside switch, then conduit and power to outside switch, as long as the inside switch is on the door opens from the outside, but once you turn the inside switch off the switch outside is no longer powered. You have to use conduits to get through walls 
---
Actually have wondered about that myself. Not luck but if the regeneration helps their drops as it always seemed to. Guess I'll have to use my other weapons since my sledge and gatling gun one hit most of them, probably robbed myself of getting a bunch of interesting gear haha!
---
boohoo
---
Not everyone knows that
---
I believe he just wanted to be able to open the same door from both sides. It is possible. as long as there is a switch on both sides of the door and both are tied to the power source separate from one another and both are connected to the door you can get a door that opens from both sides.
---
Thank you! I was thinking I wanted it on both characters now and was tossing up which one would get it. I've done heaps of workshop defences trying to get it but not usually the ammo factory. I'll keep doing that one!
---
Like the other poster said, the BOS camps around the fissure site prime near watoga are pretty reliable to get t60 pieces. I found all the parts there. I wish I knew where the plans to build my own t60 were though.
---
Ask your mum that question
---
So how about a full squad being able to do it?  I believe 4 humans in power armor is enough to pull a dragon out of the sky after its muscles have been pierced by grappling hooks.  At the very least it's enough to temporarily disrupt its flight ability and bring it to the ground.
---
That sounds a bit more reasonable
---
Lmao yeah 
---
Batteries included does work for gauss ammo.
---
In power armor with super steroids and often times for events in groups of 5+. 
---
But Fallout 76 is clearly designed as a ‘main story then repetitive grind’ game. If people are actively avoiding the post-story component of the game then that is a major design problem. The ‘endgame’ is where the majority of their atom shop whales are going to be spending the majority of their time. 
---
mines new the first town you find because i like the area plus seeing new players getting used to the game. and giving them a couple items but nothing special
---
And would be a pretty interesting thing to watch play out
---
You’re the reason I level bases.
---
He spent a little too much time on Teddy Hub. 
---
Ask your mom bruh
---
I got lucky and I one shot the bastards out of the sky and the best thing I got from one of them was a 10mm prime receiver plan. 
---
I think you have to find the Dragonrend shout to bring them down 
---
They come out of the fissures... 
---
Well at least now you have something to agitate a crazy dream cycle to wake you early so you're not late, after all teaching is more important than playing games with some chick.
---
You can stack sentinel assassin legendary armor for a total of 75% damage standing still plus 40% damage less from players to resist even two shot explosive shotguns point blank. This armor combo is also possible with cavalier and assassin's but you have to be sprinting instead of standing still.
---
That’s where I grind to level up lol every time I go there I run into lvl 60 and up ferals, and scorchbeasts 
---
I would have it so each hit on it would slow it down by 25% until the 4th one immobilizes it, bringing it down.  Would be a pretty epic way to meet some strangers.  It should also have a strength requirement for the gun like New Vegas had, since the guns effectiveness is dependent upon your strength.
---
Sounds like hacks to me. I mean it's literally breaking established laws so yeah my only idea. But I do have a question, what do you mean by capping Centurion?
---
Dupers shouldn't be selling anything (weapons, plans, etc) for caps at all. It takes approximately 80 minutes to go from 0 caps to 25k. It's pointless to make trades. Dupers should just be passing shit out like Santa Claus. 
---
How long does a nuke zone last?
---
My mom's gone.
---
At least they are junk so you can save them up.
---
I can't think of a single other "MMO" that has literally tens of thousands of respawning, lootable objects scattered around the world, where the servers have to keep track of every single random clipboard and desk fan, who picked it up, when it needs to respawn, etc. I'm not talking instanced loot or lootable plants, I mean all of the random objects that were hand placed everywhere and need to be kept track of until they're scrapped and or respawn Ed. 
---
This engine was never designed for MP gaming, and the fact that they made it work is fucking crazy. 
---
Class freak is good if you have lots of mutations. I use luck of the draw 3 star and it works okay, probs not worth the 3 points space.
---
a crap ton of wood and like 10 metel
---
Love these stories.
---
Morgantown Highschool.  I pull 90-100 plastic out of there every trip.
---
It won't out right negate the need for durability boosts like gumsmith, but Luck of the Draw and Lucky Break are fairly useful for delaying repairs.
---
I'm sorry but what is the point of doing this 
---
Purge the unclean the mutant the heritic....
---
Isnt it only herbivore and carnivore tha cant co-exist?
---
How is it unpossible? 
---
(Deliberate sp. Mistake xD)
---
Oh baby jesus
---
Define "replace". Even with Gunsmith AND Luck of the Draw, your gun will still break eventually. Also, it depends on the gun. I find Luck of the Draw procs on shotguns all the time, but not so much on other weapons, especially slow rifles. It seems with shotguns the chance is per-pellet, same as Four Leaf Clover. There's also magazines you can find in the game which for an hour give 30% durability loss reduction to your weapon. 
---
It's nice to have, and I try to have it when leveling up. But as part of a complete endgame build, it's not good enough, IMHO.
---
Alright just message me whenever you launch I am usually online around 5 pm to 11 pm on the week and usually most of the weekend 
---
Why would.you have herbivore and carnivore 
---
Because there is no valid reason against it lol
---
Oh that one, putting that one on hold because I have nowhere to put the Daisycutter.
---
I dont think they can stack 
---
Agreed. Good for filling the gaps is about it.
---
They also made sure that sneaking away is near impossible because, even when hidden, they fucking follow you
---
The only good mutie is a dead mutie
---
Interview went alright. Tonight was from a job I applied for on a whim. The real news may be coming later this week. Trying to transition into SaaS sales. Def a big step from where I am now.
---
I've gotten 2 items from the store since beta. Ive got almost 6k in atoms without buying any. Items were free before for me and they're still free. It's not 3.5 bucks for a skin. It is 5 days of playing the game or 70 cents a day you don't. 
---
I use one all the time, I'm ready!
---
Pretty sure. Farmed the mutations from radiation, once I got carnivore, I never saw Herbivore 
---
I’m level 39 now and I’ve seen like 5 Gatling guns and one legendary 
---
It’s not my main weapon type though. 
---
They can
---
Awesome camp! Very cool. How do you do it it though? I thought switches were only on or off. Can't you only make master ons or master offs?
---
There's better uses for lck than that perk imo.
---
It procs so infrequently that's its a waste.
---
Of course, they created a mmo where this duping glitch is possible 
---
After nuking W/S a homie told me that a camper\* was set up by clubhouse, I launched a second nuke right on top of the first one with no outline, got a bunch of chumps as well. Primed the third and waited for him to rebuild his camp, he/she disconnected before #3 hit.
---
Multi/masked nuking is a hobby of mine, I do wish they would reduce the timer though, or make the circle not visible until the final 30s.
---
Yep, I found a torso and both legs here just yesterday.
---
Mate, marsupial was a game changer
---
Get on that serum, lol
---
If you need to craft, take rad-x though, cause -4 int sucks when you want to craft
---
It does specifically say molotovs don't work so at least they specify that
---
That’s a good set up for someone like me. The only legendaries I find are always unrelated to my playstyle
---
MUTIES!
---
Im not saying ppl are, im saying I will, I dont get into repetitive grind without purpose in any game, including all MMOs that are designed with repetitive grind as being the core part of the game, I'll fight the queen once and that'll be it for me until new content, just because the game was  designed as a  ‘main story then repetitive grind’ does no mean everyone will enjoy every aspect of it, and does not indicate a design problem. 
---
I mean wheres the design problem in traditional MMOs that block large portions of content off to people who dont enjoy grouping with others (this is apparently not considered a design problem, altho there are ppl, ie. me who actively avoid it). 
---
Im sure there are plenty of games out there where a majority of users enjoy one part, and a majority enjoy another part, and another group may enjoy all of it
---
Idk man, farmed all the mutations I could for quite a while. Once I got carnivore, I never got herbivore. 
---
That, would be handy
---
Can be the glowing legendary's green aura, existing assets
---
Won't even lie I have 15 luck so far I have enough stimpacks to embarass Ray Charles.  But I cannot get anything above 1 star to be useful. 
---
My piss poor way of saying level 100 players. 
---
I thought it may be a form of hacking but wasn't sure if they could do it through the ps4, but I'm not much of a techie type person. 
---
You might have to force it with reruns but I know it's possible 
---
Console pleb, grass, grass as far as the eye can't see forever
---
Based on?
---
&gt; The bugs go well beyond typical bethesda fair as well.
---
No, they don't. Or at least for me they don't. 
---
&gt;with crashing 3+ times a day being more than enough to make people stop playing entirely
---
I crashed literally 20 times in one day during my latest playthrough of Fallout 4 in the summer. Worse yet, i actually lost progress to the point where a simple restart from save wouldn't fix it, but rather a full restart of the full game. From the actual start. It got so bad that I literally couldn't go into boston for a week until i downloaded a mod that made that area stable. Compared to 4, 76 runs way fucking smoother. 
---
&gt;"16 times the level of detail" is a good start when almost all of the assets are the same 100% from fallout 4.
---
That doesn't mean there's more stuff in the game. that means they upgraded the graphics, which i think they did. I noticed a lot of stuff looked way better than it did in 4. like the power armor for instance. 
---
That is a master on not a 2 way
---
I have a strong back, am a traveling pharmacy, bear arms, an ordinance express, thu-hiker, and a bonafide pack rat. I'm normally under 190lb with 5 weapons, 100 stims, dog food, and purified water.
---
No need for excavator armor here! :P
---
https://netsenshi.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/foh-protestors.jpg
---
Yeah, but on that thinking, they'd probably put unpassable fire everywhere,which prevents looting xD
---
Where do you get more of the orbital strikes?
---
What do you swap in for lockpick and hacker?
---
glad it was only scorced and not a scorchbeast
---
I have 13 mutations, dont have eagle eye (dont use guns) , herbivore (have carnivore), empath (dont play on team) herd mentallity (dont play on team) unstable isotope (dont like the rads side effect) or plague walker (rarely have a disease). 
---
I love it. 
---
Did you own a workshop?
---
One time while trying the enclave quest my character floated around as if to swimming for a well minute thirty! Until then I died, during this time I was able to dual wield two of these Gatling guns and it appeared my character to have four arms cranking and aiming! :D I love game too these paper bags I'm always am finding at certain areas
---
I saw a screen shot a month or so back where a level 50 had EVERY mutation including both of them. If I can find a link or other proof I'll edit it in.
---
Please do
---
Lol, the de-excavator?
---
Wait where do you find so much steel?
---
Tesla coil excavator torso mod &gt; long dog stealth :)   The last wolf in my 'leader of the pack' event the other night was a longboi; almost timed-out the event before I thought to try it. If he gets close enough to bite, he gets hit. Feels a bit lame letting him take himself out, but the loot was decent and I saved my bullets.
---
if you are on ps4 then yeah ill check it out
---
Having played 4 to 100% and over 100 hours of 76 I am calling shenanigans.  It's clear that you don;t think rationally involving the game, going as far to take criticism of the game as personal attacks.  It isn't hard to believe you have strong cognitive dissonance set in at this point to protect your view so you simply overlook everything going wrong in 76 to affirm your views
---
These times it's been going on for me, I'll trade with a man and when he's not in the menu any longer is attacking on me. While this time he is swapped over to a ranged gun and kills me one shot or two! I was never even hitting him. He just killed me there
---
Well good luck brotha 👊
---
90% of the super mutants at summersville drop  .308 ammo..it takes about 10 mins to clear the area..I do multiple rounds doing this by server hoppknf they are beyond easy too
---
No, unfortunately :(
---
I have a heavy spiked rocket sledgehammer mod for my super sledge, but I can’t put it on. WHYYYYYYY
---
there's booze, guns, mothman, and robots, what else do you need?
---
Item shops are on a player basis, not server
---
Unfortunately there just is no end game. I’m an elitist and a completionist and I power through games, so once I got to end game it just felt empty. I launch nukes to grind violet flux + SBQ, that’s about it. That’s why I’m saying enjoy it while it lasts.
---
Inb4 'raider roleplay'
---
I'm saying what is the rational behind the thinking of the explanation, why the Perk does what it does.
---
I aim with my mouse, I know "Expert Rifleman" doesn't affect my aim - but what would the *meaning* be?  I have to assume it would mean that you're good at pointing the thing and hitting stuff with it.  So, you do more damage, because you shoot better.  Even though I do the actual aiming myself.  Make sense?
---
Thanks for the feedback, is this from personal testing?
---
Still a dick
---
I was collecting it solely to make the Blackberry Honey Crisp recipe, but since the jelly is a junk item the cooking interface says you don't have them.  I just put in a ticket for that, but I'm afraid I might junk them by accident.  I wish we had another storage box besides our stash to store items we want to keep separate.
---
The world is supposed to feel empty to an extent...that’s kind of the point
---
I am loveing these brown paper bags :D finding them is joy when I do, I'm looking around when people are dying around me. Always have an eye on the bag, I'm helping you but if you go down that sweet paper bag is on mine! I'm loveing these bags, always springs and the steel and copper as well as the fluxes I need for my showers and thing, also there is wood, I'm needing wood alot often and this makes me not farm for that wood. The bags are brown so we take them and are everywhere if you look hard.
---
You should be able to start up the purification machine even after the quest. If you go into the plant you should still be able to load in the ingredients. Haven't tested it myself sadly. 
---
Are they stored? Check your stored/blueprints. Or when you go to place a new plant does it say (16) or (8) or something underneath the name of the plant? If so they're stored and you can plant them without using resources.
---
When you move a camp I think it just moves the main structure and stores anything not attached
---
I agree, but the "I'm roleplaying a raider" excuse is usually on every post. Except I've never seen these roleplayers using raider PA, so maybe they just suck? :)
---
Are you sure they were level 0? maybe it was 1000 and just cut off. Ive seen a pic of a level 1600+ character so it is possible for someone to be that high level (thru exploits that were available early on)
---
I’ve fought worse in other games (looking at you Castlevania) but I’m with you so much on how awful they are
---
Always expect dickery and offload junk into your stash as often as you can. Even if it means fucking off back to the traino for a moment.
---
People are flakey cunts in game and out. 
---
I’m saying people are. The endgame repetitive grind is missing some pretty major things to actually keep people engaged. The combat is dull, the rewards are lacklustre, the enemies aren’t particularly threatening or interesting. It is the most bare bones Skinner box system I have ever seen. There are games out there that have gameplay loops that will keep people in the same grind not only for a long time, but also through seasonal. Fallout 76 is not one of those, but it has all the components that scream for people to repeat the same loop as nauseum.
---
This is not a case where the design decision gates players (as per you need a group to do this), this is a case of the gameplay not supporting the grind loop that has been put into it.
---
 I'm not avoiding finishing the main quest line. I'm just in no rush. There's a lot to be found under every rock. Things they added in for others to find that end game rushers miss. You sit at a table in the Whitesprings restaurant and the waiter brings you a menu. Pointless perhaps, but it brought a smile to my face. 
---
1: landing for 30 seconds is extremely generous 
---
2: their crop duster attack also goes through solid concrete, and in general buildings do far less than you'd expect against them
---
Nice camp!
---
Honestly at this point it seems pretty fair to say that Bethesda are not listening to us. 
---
*waits for next ATOM store update* 
---
Nope, sorry I should’ve added that. My “house” and turrets are all in the stored section and were able to be pleased, but all of my plants are gone.
---
I couldn't put items in my stash...
---
The golf club is a nice enough place to live. Why don’t you just piss off and leave them alone
---
I was showing that the door can be opened from both sides. I believe that is all he was trying to achieve. The switch is not 2 way, but the door is.
---
Can't find it. I just saw something about if you have both you can't eat so the guy had to scrap his mutation character because he couldnt just get rid of carnivore or herbivore and wind up losing multiple. 
---
Maybe after tomorrow. I need egghead to test crafting with extremely high Int effects.
---
I really want it though!
---
Probably used TSE weapon. Most likely the double barrel shotgun.
---
That's sick tbh.
---
Bird Bones does offer a bonus of AGI and imo falling in slomo is just too damn fun. You can reach quite a bit farther than a normal jump. 
---
Wow! Your so cool.
---
Be glad it was ultrasmurfs. Any other chapter would have used you as a meatshield.
---
Eagle eyes add to crit damage for everything, so get it, dont think carni/herbi stack, empath/herd mentality, fair, unstable isotope not as bad as you might think, and plague walker puts your diseases to good use, especially against those pesky small insects and mole rats 
---
All scorchbeasts should drop legendary loot tbh
---
DOOFUS. C
---
ause their not there to live
---
Well yes, from a lore or understanding standpoint, it would mean you're better at shooting. From a game standpoint, it's just a name for a damage modifier.
---
Whenever I'm havinge the bugs I'm usually spraying them. My local grocer has the various sprays for the bugs. They will usually run and hide but I will always find and spray on them with my sprays from the store
---
Ok. I live there 
---
Wait wha...are you saying we literally have no way to make those crisps?
---
I am convinced that’s why. I have a fast travel mat, and it doesn’t work at all if the CAMP hasn’t loaded in yet.
---
Hmmm, I'm still skeptical. But you can still gain mutational back easily. So scrapping the char doesnt make sense.  Sounds fictional 
---
If I park an empty pa frame in a bench it will let me craft it. Figured it out
---
Would it bring a smile to your face if there was a daily quest on the repeat cycle to have 15 menus brought to you? I said that the game is fine for environmental quirkiness within the rails, but it is clearly designed to carry on after that. 
---
Sweet 
---
IMBECILE, as long as your not using turrets and actually have a base and not just a platform to farm kills your good 
---
Probably is i just read it somewhere
---
That's entirely possible and I can't rule it out. Our armour should have at least done something, as should the pacifist setting. 
---
First time our team has encountered this in our combined experience. 
---
You should unlock a blueprint for it after getting your first ones from the quest. They require 2 of a raw flux and some other materials to make
---
Just an excuse to be an asshole in some cases. Others would argue raider PA isn't that good for what you need in nuke zones. 
---
However I'm now seeing he's the big bug, you might want to be calling in the boys downtown on that. If it's big bug the sprays from the local stores may not be enough for this bug. The guys they come in a minivan and when they do it they will spray. Thet spray is better than the hardware store ones. They might even take Thet bug in the minivan
---
Haha no worries. Wish we did had real switches though. I'm an electrician irl and the lack of proper switching annoys me a lot.
---
I think they also dont want people trapping players. Not that it makes much difference, as we saw earlier on the subreddit people making human barbeques... and people can pretty much always fast travel out. 
---
/shrug
---
Yeah I think just just be cool with your friends. Or if you meet someone nice, then go the extra mile. I made an alt mule yesterday and a LVL 5 player who had been playing for the 1st day came up and was being nice trying to give me weapons, so I friended them and changed over to my main to make them shielded underarmor.
---
My husband and I sit next to each other on the couch with 2 TV's and 2 Xboxs. Great for snack sharing and looking at each other's loot, building a camp together, etc
---
How long did you wait?
---
Ive seen gear take 30 seconds to pop up.
---
Only atoms shop
---
Lewisburg has them pretty consistently.
---
I was trying to be nice for others, such as the low levels I was carrying. And sadly I don't have any friends.
---
They will never call them "drugs", they're marketed as "chems" for a reason.
---
*paid
---
7 minutes at the longest we were all frozen and had to wait for the server to play catch up.
---
So never ever walk away from bodies till ya get your loot. This is the case for Whitespring nukes as well. Even if you only get normal loot check the corpse a little after a well as you might find more loot on them  like legendary items.
---
Mate, i've played it 4 to 100% as well, and over 200 hours of 76. It ain't shenanigans or lies. I genuinely had an unpleasant experience with 4. I don't know if it was an update that fucked it up or what. But it was pretty fucked up. I didn't even have many mods on it outside of an service rifle mod and the militarized minutemen mod and the Galactac armor mod and the one i mentioned earlier.
---
Fallout 76 has legitimately been a better experience outside of dealing with the scorchbeasts which aren't as hard to deal with now that i know you can just trick them by using stealth. It sounds like you're the one that takes everything as a personal attack and that you're the one trying to protect your views. 
---
Me too because it takes more work to achieve the same result.
---
It's unfortunate you lost your stuff.
---
Part of the design of this system is to add an element of risk to playing the game. Without risk, you are free to play the game recklessly until you get a reward. A game without risk begins not to feel like a game at all doesn't it?
---
So although I empathize with your story, and I'm of the opinion "players not flagged for pvp shouldn't lose their loot when they die" I also have to recognize that this game has to have an element of risk or consequence for dying. You couple this issue with other issues like limited stash and I begin to sway in your favor. 
---
What's the alternative? 
---
* You can run around and die all you want and never lose anything?
---
* Start a grief-ing war between you and the person who picked up your loot?
---
* Rework the game architecture around inventory and item management so we can have larger stashes w/o burdening the serves more?
---
Just wondering if you have any solution to this problem that still allows risk to exist.
---
Demolition Expert will also boost the damage.
---
Where
---
It was never valid. It was always a false rumor. 
---
Kk i already walked away. Bgs needs to hurry up and deal with dupers
---
tell her to max out lead belly first, ez
---
if you're already so bored with the game that you're griefing others, how the hell do you need more resources? I have hundreds of copper and steel despite trying my best to use them up, I'd even offer to give you a few hundred if you didn't sound like a dick
---
Thank you for commenting. It is greatly appreciated.
---
I don't ride the wheel. Sorry. 
---
I did a testing on collecting all mutations a while back, i got doubles of mutations but couldn't have both carnivore and herbivore at the same time
---
As a Southern man who graduated in 97, I would consider this a worthy investment.

I like raider PA but don't grief people, does that count?
---
I have one but I never use it. Maybe I’ll walk into my level 39 ass into watoga and see what’s what. 
---
Awesome, thanks man.
---
I'm fine with consequence, what I'm not fine with is people that are able to steal loot without consequence. It's bullshit, try to pick a lock? Your wanted and anyone can kill you. Try to steal someones hard earned junk? Your not wanted and you can run away and enjoy your new-found treasures
---
Many time I'm doing on the scorchbeasts queen. She's flying and flapping and hissing and wiggling about the whole place, in the air and sky! I'm shoot and shoot and nothing working on her, I'm looking and I see help only they are not helping. These cowards are HIDING! What are you doing in there? Do you need help? No! No you don't need the help! I'm the one out there shoot and shoot and taking the radiation's to my meter while there in this wooden shed! Help me hello please help! I'm sory this is happened today early and I'm still unbelieving
---
I think everyone's beginning to convince me that I need to make this happen!
---
If you ever need help (from a level 45 and friends) just ask me on Xbox, my gamertag is: NotoriusNewbs11. 
---
I'm always happy to help others out when it comes to these types of games.
---
Good luck and have fun playing with your wife!
---
This no idea how it started and freaked me out as well. But i tested this to no end with people you can't take an item from someone.
---
The closest issue we found is that if you try to set a price on an item at the same time someone request the item. It can put that price on the item underneath it.
---
Ive heard plenty of stories now of people one shotting people even without engaging, ridiculous weapons mixed with stacking bobbleheads (if that is actually a thing, i always assumed u could only have one active, but ive heard they are stacking them to get crazy damage values, like 80k damage). Now these are all just stories, i havent seen proof, or experienced anything for myself.
---
Good for you. Doesn’t change the fact that Bethesda have designed a square wheel.
---
At lvl 42 it was a small challenge. The mirelurk kings are bullet sponges. 
---
And be warned. If you see one wendigo.. make sure you see the other one. Is how i died. 
---
The main wendigo combat area is a loop. You can lure one around and dash round and break los to hide and crit kill it. 
---
If nothin else.. i will go back into the fire with ya broman_907 on ps4
---
too funny, scorchbeasts are easy. You are just weak and suck at video games. Maybe your mommy shouldn't have bought you the game.
---
Damn. Burn like an atom bomb baby 
---
&gt; I don't have a mellifluous voice. 
---
Maybe not but you have a very cromulent vocabulary.
---
Yup. That happens a lot. I try to just go slow and 1 item at a time 
---
Were not all as neck beardy as you. I hadn’t even thought of doing that. Stop being a dick 
---
My theory is that some traders/dupers started spreading this around to try to curb the massive cap inflation so all their duped two shot explosives could actually be worth something for longer. Less trading = smaller economy + less competition. 
---
Just take your time, view requests/offers carefully.
---
My gut tells me ppl go to buy from someone, that person requests instead of offers and they accept it.
---
I M B E C I L E : im just looking out for other people playing the game , stop being a cunt 
---
Exactly. I can see what the devs had in mind, to keep players from stockpiling and getting bored...but...
---
The thing about enemies designed for endgame, is that they need to be *worth* being endgame content. And Scorchbeasts are everything you said with essentially no payoff. How do they so clearly design them to be endgame mobs and resource sinks yet make it completely unrewarding to kill them?
---
The drop rate for Prime plans is so stupidly rare that out of the ~20 I've killed? I have two Prime Pipe plans. *Woo-hoo...*
---
As if I need a fucking Prime Receiver anyway, about the only thing a well built character can't murder in a few shots max by level 50 are, guess what? Fucking Scorchbeasts.
---
Im down. I love the nature aspects of the game. I might cosplay my character but he looks like I would anyway. You know the dry lakebed north of the capital? What’s that all about irl? 
---
I nuked fissure prime just to follow the quest. Didn't even get to kill her. 
---
None of my friends play fallout 76, I just have a few people that met from playing who are cool and sometimes play with them. If you were on PS4 I would say you could add me if you wanted. Have you heard of the union merchants, it's a group of high LVL players that sometimes host events with prizes and are nice people helping lower LVL players. I'm not sure if they operate on PC though
---
Int gives you more xp while crafting, but not much 
---
The Treachery of Poems: Ceci n’est pas un PSA
---
Sure.
---
People who don't understand the concept of multiplayer are upset that other human beings are setting their camp down too close to a popular farming location and taking some of their kills with their turrets, so rather than finding a different spot to grind or taking a few seconds to hop servers, they go on reddit and advocate destroying the bases like children throwing tantrums.
---
Honestly, I miss having stuff to do. Go here, do this, talk to this person, get shitty rewards. You know, fallout 4 lol
---
I agree. And while we are at it, let us craft the indoor plant boxes. Like the ones you see in the world now. Rectangular shape. 
---
figured I should add: they’re not exactly dragons but mutated bats so maybe they’d be weaker and if you have power armor you could pull them down. just a thought. 
---
I have always thought when it comes to this that. Taking loot from a bag should bounty your ass at 1 cap per item you take lol.
---
A popup message appears when you open a bag letting you know this is someones loot and you can take it but it comes with a price.
---
Thats why we are stocking up on 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bobbleheads &amp; TSE. If the next patch fixes duping &amp; doesn't add 8 new methods to dupe, they have NO WAY to deal with duped items because there is no unique ID lol. 
---
Yes more please, A serious ass kickin scene would be most outstanding
---
Springs are the new currency. Seriously though, if someone dies, I'd dig through their bags for those springs cause repair shit takes way too many of them. 
---
I love the wendigo glitch
---
How funny it is to see someone blow their dick off, on a scale of 1-10, it's a solid 8. We've all been there homie, the loot is nothing compared to the humiliation of being your own worst enemy. Take a break if you need it, hopefully the player base will improve or the games mechanics will get a touch-up.
---
Playing whiteknight will get you little to no sympathy from other players. 
---
If transfer failed notice appears, try logging off and hop back into your server. 
---
You were using an explosive shotgun at whitesprings, took 30m on the silo, and brought loot into a nuke zone.
---
that is the job of the guard, be the shield of the emperors finest

Yea its bullshit, pick a lock? Your wanted. Steal someone's shit? Your not wanted

True dat, I also just quit my game and find a new server
---
Just a question, where do you find T51 jet packs? Are they at a specific vendor or?
---
all the ghouls wanted to do is show you the love of nurgle, the same love that festers in the emperor right now, always trust a smurf to ruin a party 
---
This is true. I have tried it myself and it works. In the build mode pickup your camp module and move it somewhere else in the green zone. Fast travel to your base and see where you end up. Repeat this until you end up in a good spot. It’s just trial and error. I can’t figure out any rhyme or reason to where it puts you. Took me about 5-10 tries to get it where I wanted to be. 
---
What do you mean by "white knight" and also, it didn't matter, the transfer always failed, I reloaded my game for a solid hour and it never let me take/put anything in my stash
---
Not a bug.
---
Exactly if they ignore the message and pick up all the loot then the owner now has a chance to reclaim it from them.
---
non legendary handmades can kill them too in under a minute. People just love to complain, don't they?
---
Me and my friend just did it and damn that atmosphere is crazy. 
---
I didn’t get the challenge done though so I wore the stupid clown outfit for no reason 
---
That would be a great feature and I would spend 100$ on Atoms if they added it 
---
I dont think people are asking for anyone with a traded duped weapon to be banned, just the people with millions of carry weight etc.. I doube Bethesda even has a way of tracking individually duped items.
---
One thing I noticed even remotely similar was if they requested something it would disappear from your inventory then poof back up a few seconds later. There was never an exploit just people spreading false info. 
---
If I'm seeing you in the wasteland you better be know that I'll take any of brown paper bag. Thet loot in the bag is what I'm always after. Having one eye on the bags at all times I'll take the woods and the springs and the gears, maybe all of them! :D one time on adventuring three noobs were on me at this time. I was helping them but keeping my mind on the bags. "Don't make friends" I told me "you are here to take bags" then it happen, my level made it so thet super mutant are here but much higher on levels than the noobs. I'm laughing but shooting so they aren't suspecting of me. I'm also missing on every of my shoots! :D  these noobs take damage until on of them dies on the ground, I'm laughing and I shoot the car they are hiding on to kill them rest! All three! I'm loveing these paper bags on the ground! I'm now taking all of these noobs loots like screws and steals and maybe a few springs sometimes they aren't much because they are level 12 or some and not picking up valuable thing. I'm knowing better and will put better use at these
---
This its not a bug you need to collect the amount each time. Its to stop it from stacking up , it can produce the full amount each hour as long as your picking them up.
---
Great feedback! I’ll pass this along to the dev team!
---
Well if you're on xbox, I can make them
---
We don't like your logical thinkin around these parts fellar, us inbreeds prefer to stick to the ol'sayin "dam dupers!!!! its all their fault"
---
No, he wasn't a hacker.
---
Yes, you can build that close.
---
There's currently a bug that causes your base to duplicate if you spawn into a server with your spot occupied, making you go over budget. 
---
I literally stopped playing the game because of scrochbeast and their so called "ENDGAME"
---
I'm just going to wait for Outer Worlds for a better experience. 
---
They do. I have a **legendary handmade with full perception and it does work
---
Huh. So... it can create 24 an hour. I just have to pick it up three at a time. Good to know.
---
Hell do it in an update where they also throw up custom paper bags in the atom shop and i would show my support for it.
---
Plus it adds about more content to the game through a small change. Now when ya die and someone ahole takes your stuff. You can hunt them down and reclaim it from them.
---
Otherwise still enjoy the fact that they now have a large bounty on their head lol.
---
Yes sir
---
The game allows you to do this, should the players check with RocketRetro before playing the game they paid for?
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
Take your excavator armor south of the unfinished mansion for steel. Two pieces of road from a v. Within the imaginary triangle of the v are 8 iron nodes.
---
Yes, sell them to vendors for caps.  Best use for them I've found.
---
Also a Tunnel Snakes PA paint for the love of Atom. 
---
It is. A dragon, even. 
---
New "Chrome Paper Bag" only $8!
---
[Fucking *excuse* me?*(https://i.imgur.com/6kSgeUI.gif)
---
Sturdy combat chest armor you’re welcome.
---
I can't believe the thought was there to equip it and use, I usually just run like hell, thats some quick thinking 
---
Clear evidence that the vast majority of players has left and its an awful bug riddled game.
---
Would prefer flash bangs be in the game,  daze enemies and ground sierra bravos.
---
Psn neonspacetrash - issue an hour ago - mission  the mother lode - reported on system the error that contains video - error cleared mission 3 times during game play. First when I entered the building and in mid walk it froze - 2nd in the elevator after card first activated to use it - third when walking from the terminal to the repair beacon key pad. 
---
Fast travel worked for the first time after the last update. So many weird glitches/issues, but it’s so fun aside from that.
---
Just take my upvote, take it!  
---
If I find a bag worth the salt thats in it, I wait 5-10 min (usually browse the subreddit on my phone) for anyone to show up and before afk kicks me. If they dont show up then I pick out what Im interested in and move on. 
---
Don't look right and no helmet. Also don't cover entire body. Doomguy skin would probably go on combat armor make it cover body and add helmet that's also a gas mask. 
---
Nah gotta have proper ones lol.
---
A jack in the box that has a vault boy in it that pops when looted. ;
---
A bloodbag for mutant players.
---
Maybe a lunchbox looking one. :D
---
Psn bryangolley. I'm also from Australia. I'm a high LVL character so if you need someone to build stuff in your camp (I have pretty much all the plans) or help with a difficult mission
---
 I wouldn't think they would keep the stash storage always loaded either.  At which point, occasionally loaded storage would be about the same.
---
We are at best guessing at their architecture.   It's possible these things are the same level of effort, or different in either way, its not like they are going to tell us :)
---
I'm just saying, unless somehow implementing cross character storage is somehow lots easier than expanding existing storage, that it might not be the best way to go.  I dont want to feel forced to mule things :)
---
They probably thought you were the asshole. I, for one, don't like going into nuke zones and picking a fight, only to have some overcompensating jerkwad steamroll the place with some likely duped TSE weapon. Takes all the fun and challenge out of it.
---
Not saying that's specifically you, mind, but it's a pretty common thing that people do in my experience.
---
I killed a 3* legendary glowing angler tonight and all I got was a drill. No mods on it, just a drill. I even double checked it a minute or two later and nope. Just a drill. 
---
Well, not *all* mutations:
---
* Empath may be unwanted for solo and/or because Class Freak doesn’t reduce it
---
* Grounded may be unwanted because Gauss Rifle and Class Freak may fail to reduce it
---
* Herd Mentality because Class Freak may result in fractions resulting in Barbarian and Evasive not working.
---
* Plague Walker because I hear it may also damage bistanders even if one lacks a disease (?)
---
Start with 30 acid. Stop at 500 acid. Use the acid until your back down to 30. I always make sure to keep at least 30 so I can bulk and scrap.
---
Yes.
---
They all had mics, and were actually happy that I had my shotgun. I was helping them, I let them get a shot, then I shot.
---
Oh boy
---
Just sent a request 
---
Best bet is treasure maps but i bought mine from another player
---
In one sentence you say you can't in the next you describe the exact method it is done.
---
The only things that hold weapons are scorched, super mutants and miners.. So that's unlikely given people normally farm ghouls and the SBQ. 
---
You deserve everything that is happening to you for even using a TSE in a nuked area. Actually, I wish it happens to you forever here on out.
---
Well, I mean, you could say that about basically every enemy in the game.
---
They have other attacks?
---
I just skip these comments at this point. I appreciate them, but I’ve played my Christmas break and have had frustrations.
---
&gt;Didnt realize you included FO4 - so I can scrap the whole truck 
---
Ah, 10 steel. Same as 5 tin cans.
---
do you know someone who could apply winterized paint to my t-51b?
---
You're welcome. I can't even imagine how much money it's saved my wife and me. $60 less a year for Live, and $60 less per game that we've ever bought to play together, more so for some games like Destiny with loads of extra DLCs. Honestly, it's one of the biggest reasons I'm glad I went with an OG Xbox instead of PS all though years ago.
---
That's freaking awesome. I love this and would have giggled my ass off once I got over the sizzling shock!
---
Brilliant
---
Funny story but....Level 23 in PA running from level 50 ghouls?  "C'mon man" 
---
I put my camp there on release because the place is refreshingly clean and well kept.
---
So, if I come back to this game, I gotta face this mess.
---
ugh.
---
This game will eventually be fixed, but ugh Fuck it.
---
Read, I was helping people. They were all low levels (around level 20) and had mics, I shot with my shotgun at a house and they were like "that guy can help us" I let them get shots on all of them, then I killed them. Please read the post before you comment.
---
No... thats not the same thing at all.
---
The claims are they could take things from you for 0 caps. They could even see what players had in the inventory without even trading. 
---
Were you not here at all for this?.
---
This one is a simple bug that is in the traders control. If you see an item requested you just have to cancel your pricing and reclick on it.
---
...You killed yourself, you dropped that junk, losing it is the **only** penalty you pay. If it was "treasure worthy" you stash that asap, if you can't then slap it onto a mule or fix the issue before hauling around your supplies if you know your going into a high traffic area.  
---
While playing with teammates/friends/rando's make sure to tell them ahead of time to take your stuff before some one els does, even then don't expect all of it to end up back into your possession, because again you killed yourself.
---
Well I have travelling pharmacy, bear arms, ordinance express, thru-hiker, and bandolier, but I still seem to be always over 220, lol. I probably carry more drugs and guns than I should. Also the Auto-Grenade launcher and Rifles seem unaffected by any weight reducing perks.
---
I move mine around alot but i enjoy building the camps. I usually choose places that have unique and odd landscapes. I like too build the camp with the surroundings. Kinda like a weird puzzle.
---
so i somewhat got it. but not really. i can open and close from inside and outside but if i open from the outside i cant close from inside and vice versa if you get what i mean lol...side not anyone know what the deal is with keypad pylon? even without putting in correct pin people can still turn it off an on 
---
Submitted a ticket on what? a mechanic is working as intended? You know its in the game because they wanted people to use it. You don't set the rules in multiplayer, submit a ticket because this post is upsetting you.
---
I can't just "slap it onto a mule" and I was communicating, I was asking for them to cover up my loot.
---
I'm level 40, when can I expect to see Legendary mods? Does this make it worth keeping a low-level weapon at the higher levels?
---
Well, there's plenty of room in whitesprings. It's directly outside the golf club that people get pissy about
---
No u
---
You win the internet.  I watched each video more than a few times throughout my work day.   Thanks for that!
---
Well I think it is really well made and it’s a shame they are not doing anything with it.
---
Oh yea? Might have to go back to Sugar Grove. Guess I should check the wiki for the best spots, though it doesn't seem to always be accurate.
---
killed 20 scorchbeasts, and you got 2 plans?  I've killed many more than that and never got a single one
---
would be helpful to put what platform your on
---
When I'm in a Power Armour, I usually start a movie on my second monitor while waiting this weird flying thing to lands. That is how boring it is.
---
You are right, it is impossible for me to change your mind/opinion, only you can change it.
---
Anyway, I disagree that every build should and you can't change my mind, so don't bother.
---
I did that today with all my collected energy ammo. Dropped thousands of fusion cells, hundreds of plasma carts, and dozens of plasma cores into containers into the train stations. 
---
Avoiding criticisms.
---
When I start freezing a lot I go ahead and do a hard reboot on my Xbox thiseems to help for a while.
---
Probably. I know I can store it. But I don't want to get rid of it. 
---
No it's not in their control. They request multiple items, when you are setting the price for 1 of them, say 0 caps, 1 caaap, or 100 caps, they request another item maybe your best weapon at the time when you set the price for 0, 1 or 100 or whatever. Then they quickly buy it because the game is a buggy mess.
---
You're a dumbass
---
Then they will have everything from ama to zon
---
I got the scorch killer fatman with armor pierce. Life is goodm
---
No way
---
I'm actually not running Lockpick or Hacker yet. I'm at 15 PER (Skeet Shooter instead of Lockpick) and 10 INT (Demo, Gunsmith).
---
Might put the extra points into AGI. Might even spec out of CHR, too.
---
I've heard of a group of people being raiders that would go find low levels and offer them caps to fight in the fighting ring near Top of the World, and then people would bet on which low level would win, and they would give the winner caps and such. That's good RP haha
---
I'm a true American, who still believes in the American way of life. I wont discriminate against those who want to build their homes at the golf course, or anywhere else for that matter. You on the other hand, ARE the commie rat bastard who would. 
---
You can get the neon letter for free? Have played quite a bit myself and never seen them drop. Where did you get them? Or is it the small letter and numbers one?
---
Executioner's/40% Swing Speed Meathook.

Oof that sucks i can help you with repairs also do you have power armor stations? I have just a frame but i dont want to lose it so i was wondering if i can keep it in there when im not using it
---
Maybe a Slayer buff or something that increases damage with each scorch beast killed. Stack like 5 times or whatever.
---
I tried to give a lvl 6 player couple things( legandery weapons/armour) that I got from couple events that I had just finished. I'm only lvl 28 and it was like lvl 10 gear that he could use soon.
---
 Man that was an awkward time. Took almost 15 mins for him to finally pick up the bag. 
---
Yes.  “Max Condition” is more specifically called “Durability” and (as you’ve seen from those perks) the condition can go above 100% of the Durability but for repairs is ultimately based on the Durability, and INT increases both initial Condition and Durability.  Perks like Armorer 3 and Power Smith 3 also increase Durability (apparently, if the text of those perks is to be believed).
---
I remember people like you when I was low level in nuked whitesprings, and I really appreciated it. Now way I'm gonna kill a bloated glowing one with my level 15 10mm haha
---
Oops sorry. Edited above.
---
Not gonna deny the game is a buggy mess. But any trader worth their weight will tell ya you don't trade with your weapons out. This is also why you do all trading in your store.
---
If i am selling a weapon or armor piece then all items in that tab are placed into stash for my trade to be smooth and easy. Normally because you want to make sure only your wares are shown. Since we are unable to hide items on us that are not for sale.
---
Not until the royal jelly gets categorized as an Aid item.  In the real world royal jelly is a secretion bees make that has medicinal uses so it would make sense to have it be perhaps some low effect healing item and of course be listed under the aid tab.
---
I wish you luck
---
They drop bones, which is used to scrap for ultracite, tones of it.
---
What platform you on?
---
There is a deathclaw gauntlet. That would be cool
---
No need buddy. :) 
---
You don't get to my level without having a butt load of resources lol.
---
Da fuq?
---
There's also a suit behind the locked door in the transport hub, which is generally level 50 t51/t60 and a suit in the main hall of the civic center, which can be t45/51/60. If you've done the BoS quest, theres also a generally high level t51/t60 spawn point on the 4th floor in the room with the PA frames. 
---
Further afield, the house to the right hand side (across from the beer hall entrance) in the sons of dane compound has a high level PA spawn point behind a lvl 3 locked door in the basement. 
---
There's several more reliable high level PA spawns, but i cba typing more, sorry. 
---
You EVIL SCHEMING RED MENACE , any red blooded American knows what he kills is his loot not some other guy with turrets loot , this is the number 1 rule in the bill of rights , it's what our country was built off of
---
no worries.. on ps4 sadly...but goodluck my dude. and remeber store junk if you want to pvp and bulk all your junk.. hoard plastic,screws,gears,springs 
---
I dont take credit for it: https://imgur.com/a/qBoLaeV

When I found it I grabbed it. :) 
---
I thought it summed up F76 beautifully- especially where I found it.
---
They certainly should, given their endless practice creating them for Elder Scrolls
---
But they were Pipe plans.
---
That's like winning a medal made from cheap plastic.
---
Ok Ark is not AAA but you admited to CoD Bo4 so there you go.

Im resilient in the fact that unlike most millennials I feel no need to make one issue a revenge story where I must seek vengeance for fuck all reason.

I enjoy things of higher quality but imagine only like 8 year old scotch then complaining that 4 year old scotch isn't good enough. 
---
You don't keep a pen and pad of graph paper next to you, along with your character sheet?

You sir, are a douchebag.

Lol, shit, what roller coaster that was

How much did you pay for BT? And why? XD
---
Spartan13_2
---
Dude lmao
---
I know but im saying that i can go on supply runs if you need it im not evtirely focused on levels if someone needs help
---
I dropped $5 on the mosaic tiles but I also got 10+ items just playing the game. My personal cost per item is at 50 cents on the high end. Regardless, atoms sale will pay for future content drops so I'm cool with it. 
---
hope they talk about DLC because need more stuff to do as the last mission is way to hard
---
Probably because you were using an explosive shotgun. I know you said you were helping people but the vast majority of people who use explosive shotguns are arseholes. The only time I see it as ok when in a nuke zone is if you’re the one who launched the nuke but they probably didn’t know it was your nuke.
---
Might be best to take a break until there’s more content anyway.
---
The Thanos Turret
---
Well, the bright side is you learned a valuable lesson. You had to make your stable flux for it to be stored in junk, so that means you made the stable flux then didn't store it. Always expect the worst. I do agree with your suggestion though, taking someone's loot who dies randomly outside of PVP is a dick move. But to counter them just always be on point with never having good junk on you. (mostly the flux since you make it and most likely had it next to your stash when you did make it.)
---
That deleting of characters over a certain weight would have to be a massively high value. I've got a level 2 with heaps of power armour pieces on them who is something like 1000 pounds over capacity. I stopped collecting them a while ago as well. 
---
Never duped, I'm simply storing all the PA I come across with the hope that one day they are worth selling or even deconstructing, since they sell for basically nothing and scrapping doesn't yield any good mats or mods.
---
I have a two-shot plasma gatling gun that works pretty well too. Do you use Bunker Buster when they land? I can never seem to hit them in the air with that.
---
I experienced it myself, except I was giving stuff away for free so it didn't bother me. The person kept requesting plans. I kept setting them to 0. Then I noticed things being set to zero caps that I didn't set to 0 yet. So yeah, the trade exploit can still happen unless they fixed that particular thing. People just didn't know how it was happening. And "Having your weapon out" is nonsense and just makes people have a false sense of security.
---
Dang I'm on xbox cause I would've dropped 200 black titanium for ya 
---
Well I let them know I was using the shotgun, they were actually happy.
---
Hey bb u on PC? 
---
You just need a connector close by to them. Wires don't connect directly. 
---
Give them to a friend who can give them to your main character.
---
Honestly I’m surprised I haven’t seen someone with a low level account server hopping for the plans and selling at a much higher price. Maybe I’ve just missed those people.
---
I call them cunts with wings 
---
Yes, I made my flux stable. But I couldn't put it in my stash... like I said in the post whenever I try to put/take a item from my stash it says "trade failed on server:
---
I payed 500 for it and I’m on ps4 but nah I don’t think it was a set up lol just unlucky 
---
well, somone posted a pic of a shotgun on here a few days ago that did 95k dmg. Whilst i've tested a 3k dmg shotgun and found that still can't kill you through pacifist mode in one hit, i'm fairly certain a 95k hit probably can. So i'd guess its either that or haxx.
---
Something needs to be done about enemy levels scaling with the highest level player in the area. I have to CONSTANTLY server hop to finish quests, lest my level 25 ass be killed by a cave of level 50 mole miners
---
Had a total of four quests this morning. Now I only have one...and one of them was the "research the docs notes" one.
---
Don’t worry about it bro thanks thoe
---
Let me see how much I have in stash I’m on ps4
---
High level locations, it's random
---
If there's a connecter nearby, it automatically provides energy to it. So if you were to put those little connectors on your roof or wall, connected to a power supply, it will provide electricity to a small radius
---
Explain how this is griefing? Greedy, inconsiderate, yea but the fo76 community is throwing this buzzword around every chance they can. 
---
Griefing would be killing players while they're in pacifist,  repeatedly, then taking their junk.
---
Another form is using the game mechanics to force a player into a no win situation against their will.(there are ways to do this).
---
Picking up junk another player dropped due to poor preparation/planning...self induced wounds is frowned upon, but not exploiting the game.
---
I also tried running to Whitespring to get help fighting the Scorchbeast, but they didn't fight each other!
---
I'd agree that it's not good enough for nuke zones. But if you're playing a raider, would a raider risk going into a nuke zone? They're traditionally a cowardly bunch
---
I managed to off one at level 11 with a shitton of turrets. It attacked my workshop. 
---
Try to use melee and don't worry once you get the hang of what needs to be done it gets easier/faster to do. If you are using PA the pain train card might be nice. Saw a teammate waltz his way through the silo hordes the other day. Also shooting off arms on protectrons and the eyes/thruster of gutsy will save ammo. Silo runs drain ammo though yes.
---
Damnit I can’t play until Sunday!  
---
That will be 18$ please.
---
Surprised Rowboat Girlyman didn't show up since he's back (of course its not really him - just Alpharius trolling us again)
---
Make a spell combining paralyze and soul trap. It freezes them forever. 
---
once you step inside turn that switch on then turn the outside one off. Then the inside switch will contol the doors. To reverse it turn the outside switch on then go back in and turn the inside one off. Now the outside swiych should control the door. When I get up tomorrow I'll make a video on how to set it up. I feel like there might be a few more people that may want to know how to do this as well.
---
Still working. Enjoy.
---
I try to drop stuff when I can, especially when it ends up in my box and I realize I'm not going to use it. I appreciate that others do it. I still have no idea what people need to farm so much for, I have $1600 credits and I'd have a lot more if I didn't spend it on fast travel. 
---
Anybody know how long the drops stay there?
---
I have 30 black titanium scrap you can have, add me Imguck2 PS4 
---
Add me psn bryangolley. If I'm on later and you are too. I'll give a bunch of ultracite.
---
I have never had this problem.
---
There is this invisible radius around any wires or conduits that powers your lights. Or you can just run wires around the house and any lights you put down will be powered.

Isn't the fat man a nuke sling shot? Could be where the leather came from.

Is the mr. Fuzzy only obtainable by camden tokens?

I'm not sure about stacking bobbleheads, I've personally heard it was magazines that stacked. I know that there was a little oversight with food items being able to stack a lot of effects, like infinitely stacking ap regen etc..

Is it bundled or 18 for each skin piece? 
---
Will do! Thanks man
---
&gt; alarmmissilesilodistant.xwm
---
Do you have this MP3 you can upload?
---
look forward to seeing this.im fine with how i have it right now feel like its the best we can do at the moment with how jacked up wiring is in the game lol. 
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA so pathetic. This guy's been going on and on about disconnects on r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS and anyone who says that it's a him problem is being called "salty" by him. Source: I commented on his post.
---
I've noticed that graphically the bar appears at zero when you log in but will restore to where it was previously after a minute or so.
---
And yes, it will feel like you're "stuck" in a level range for awhile if you're not efficiently farming XP. Once you hit the 20s, you won't be gaining 2 or 3 levels in an hour so it will feel like it's taking forever.
---
You are the first person i have seen say they use plasma gatling other than myself. How do you manage the Condition? I find mine break constantly, so i swapped to a melee build. Doing scorched earth, my gun lasted maybe two plasma cores? And then broke. Meanwhile i can pull out my baseball bat or super sledge and go all day.  When they do break, they are cheap AF to repair. 
---
I bought one of these [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trust-21670-Vintage-Microphone-Laptop/dp/B01MTYD2Z9/ref=sr\_1\_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1547011007&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Trust+21670+Elvii+Vintage+Microphone](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trust-21670-Vintage-Microphone-Laptop/dp/B01MTYD2Z9/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1547011007&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Trust+21670+Elvii+Vintage+Microphone) like, a year ago 'cause i needed a mic quick. turns out its hilariously good for gaming, quality is pretty much perfect, doesn't pick up anything from behind it; from your speakers, or from more than about 3 feet away, so you don't get kids/dogs/music/etc transmitting over your mic. it also looks frikkin awsome, it -is- cheap plastic though. 
---
Finally something to spend my atoms on!
---
When considering INT-boosting armor, consider Unyielding armor instead (+3 to all stats besides END, but only at very low health, could have +15 to each stat with the full set).  Maybe you’ll get yourself 80% irradiated and then in this adrenaline-fueled jacked up state you can perform heroic acts of crafting and selling (and killing too? search for unyielding perk builds)
---
it's impossible to be level 0 unless they were hacking, characters are created at level 1, and immediately level to 2 before leaving the vault. It was much more likely a clipping issue on a high leveled player's icon.
---
Mr. Toad’s wild ride.
---
I thought the max amount of caps you can hold is 25k.

I mean, you could have that event, but only a max if like 4 people will go to it as even events don't have much party from what I've seen.
---
You were using an explosive shotgun, and blew yourself up, the whiteknight blew himself up... they were all laughing, even I was laughing while reading that.
---
White knight/ˈˌ(h)wīt ˈnīt/*noun*
---
1. a person or thing that comes to someone's aid of others.
---
&gt;...wandering around with my explosive shotgun helping lower levels ...
---
which is why i was asking, as im assuming its a high high level character cut off, given the fact its PS4, hacking is very unlikely.
---
The whole situation is a freak accident then, my comment isn't really about blaming you for not putting it in the stash. My main point is always expecting the worst, never expect random people to act in the best way possible. This means putting things in your stash, but since that didn't work for you in this situation you would have been better off accepting the loss ahead of time oh, not that it would definitely happen but that it easily could happen. Another thing you could do for future reference might be to find some random container and just put them there for safekeeping before you go somewhere dangerous, like a temporary stash. But obviously this last point would only be useful if it was some kind of weird situation like not being able to put stuff in your stash. 
---
I totally ROFLMAOED when I saw this comment!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Got the plan at Grafton on my first try.  Lvl 98
---
Todd just back from Hawaii: How's everyone liking the game so far team?
---
Devs: Great Todd, they really love what you did with the Scorchbeast Sonic attacks!  However, they are complaining about storage space again, and the explosive two-shot weapons...
---
Todd: Good, good...let's launch the new PVP 
---
Oh okay so it goes back to normal after a bit.  That's good then I'll have to make sure I check it in a bit more time than I did before I guess.  That's a relief for sure!  Thanks :)
---
Ive gotten multiple prime plans, mirv grenades etc
---
If they are a drain on your resources then don’t fight them
---
Your new name is Lawnmower Man
---
Depends on the weapon really.  With Shotguns, it and Gunsmith 5 are a godsend.  With most Heavy and Energy weapons, the weapons will still break.  Pistols can get away with Gunsmith 4 and LotD 2 and never need to repair again.
---
Yea dude, fuck me for trying to help lower levels! 
---
Mine is behind the clubhouse but further back - the range on my 3 turrets is about halfway to the clubhouse, are on a power switch which I keep turned off unless I'm hunting, and theres a big arrow pointing to the switch with a message next to said switch that says "turn on if you need to - please turn off when done".  We cool?
---
I just want the bucket helmet!
---
There's a level 15 set that spawns in the locked end of the bridge above flatwoods (east gorge?) Key for the door is on the roller coaster in camden park, where there is also a raider PA spawn in the raider area the coaster surrounds, though it seems to not spawn often, there's often peices in a container there too, though.  
---
For 1 character. You can have 5 character in one account that's 125k. If you have 2 account you can store 250k.
---
Will remember that, thank you.
---
Another decent spot that doesn’t take long is the fire station, you literally just pick up all the dumbbells and bars in one of the first rooms and you get a bunch of lead, in about 1 minute. It’s great for a quick top off of you happen to be on the bottom left of the map
---
Hm fair enough. Wonder how trust works with that. *let me just get on my other character for the rest, vanishes forever*
---
Wow, you are an asshole 
---
It can be done if you use half walls (windows) and a conduit with a switch on the inside and outside the garage door. I did it before but my friend set it up for me because I couldn’t figure it out.
---
That sounds fun. I wish this game allowed more opportunities to RP like that. People here have to go far out of their way to do so, and will often suffer bounties for it. One thing I absolutely loved about the FOnline games was how much RP you could do
---
Awesome advice! I had no idea about that mechanic, if someone of a higher level is in the area the area matches their level - makes great sense though! Thanks! 
---
It would be nice to be able to rename or mark in some way which power armor frames are which. My T-51b armor has the Tricentennial paint on it so it's marked with the atom icon, but only while it's in my inventory and only after I've gotten in it, gotten out, and put it back in my inventory. That icon disappears as soon as it's put back in my stash though, I can't tell it apart from an empty frame or my Excavator frame. Let us rename them or rename them based on what armor they have on them, eg. a frame with Excavator armor would be called "Excavator Armor Frame" or "Power Armor Frame (Excavator)" or something.
---
I personally make it a point to travel down the the prime fissure and such once a session if I have time. I pulled 3 prime plans from 5 scorchbeasts just the other day. I can kill them with less than 80 rounds of a two shot gatling buffed by stabilized and adrenal mutation. Yea, the attacks are annoying but it doesn't take long to kill one. I like swatting them out of the air even though the RNG for prime plans is generally terrible.
---
Just realised I replied to you and not op. I agree with what you're saying 😉
---
Change servers. Problem solved. 
---
intresting i got it to set up but. i cant open from outside and close from inside &amp; vice versa if you get what i mean
---
Until you go to another server
---
This made me laugh hard because of how it’s worded
---
Yeah, of course you can add food to your wheel.  I keep some meds and Nuka Cherry as it is.  But imo that only solves the problem if you make the same food/drink all the time, and I don't really do that.  I carry a lot of purified water, but tend to save it for healing hp.  I like to do batches of melon juice, some kind of soup, or some kind of tea whenever I'm back at camp, which is infrequent. And food is all over the place for me so I don't think binds will do it for me. 
---
It’s easier to store all your junk and get killed. Or just server hop.
---
&gt; They shall be my finest warriors, these men who give of themselves to me. Like clay I shall mould them, and in the furnace of war forge them. They will be of iron will and steely muscle. In great armour shall I clad them and with the mightiest guns will they be armed. They will be untouched by plague or disease, no sickness will blight them. They will have tactics, strategies and machines so that no foe can best them in battle. They are my bulwark against the Terror. **They are the Defenders of Humanity**. They are my Space Marines and they shall know no fear.

---
Um yeah, the moment I got slapped hard as shit, I ran, and realized a few more hits would down me, I tried swinging my sledge into them but it did jack shit. 
---
I’ve heard from randos about this happening. 
---
Once the club house was spawning glowing ones like it was nuked when it wasn’t. Kept spawning consistently every three minutes for about 40 minutes until it stopped. Got my two shot explosive handmaid that day. 
---
And how to receive the 125K? Hmm
---
My approach is to not use power armor LOL. I'd rather take all the extra damage then have to deal with repairing that stuff.
---
The idea of having people constantly around sounds like a nuke zone. It's not any written law, sure, but nuke zones are very widely considered a coop event by the community. People help each other out, heal each other, usually sit with pacifist on, and don't steal each other's shit. If this happened out in the middle of nowhere or in some random dungeon out in the world, I'd understand it, but if it is nuke zones then I consider it griefing to actively seek out people who died and take their loot while everybody else works together
---
Oh, that's very common. Market value settled down to the 1k-1.5k range.
---
Another small thing, if you're attempting to VATS even if there's no target, it drains your AP every time you click the button.
---
And of course I, Cato Sicarius, Chapter Master of the Ultramarines, who follow I, Cato Sicarius!
---
If you use the resource that the mod has and you have all of the resource needed bulked, then the bench will automatically scrap the mod with the resource, could be ballistic fiber, black titanium etc.
---
I don’t know if that’s possible without logic gates. All I wanted was for the ability to stop people locking players inside the garage. So the switch on the inside, controlled the power to the pylon controlling garage door. I really don’t recall I got rid of the door ‘cause I wanted to change my camp up. 
---
still on if it popped up in game its just that session and you should be able to  rejoin anither session. yes it says server but its not the whole 76 server just the lobby
---
Logging off for now never responded so heading to bed Goodluck!
---
Really?
---
If I recall, before I had any AP Regen, just going into vats drained action points.  Is that still the case?
---
The worst part about the queens? Half the time you're gana get dced during the fight and half the times you get dced you're gana miss the kill and get nothing.
---
Normal scorch beasts are bad enough, but whether it's the nuke or the queen itself, until stability is VASTLY improved, there's absolutely no way I'm ever doing another queen.
---
TSE handmade. Easily shreds those things, but still at least 100 ammo for a level 80. Kinda expensive since they spawn three at a time on my camp. 300 ammo is easily 100 caps. :( 
---
I can hook you up with a "survival kit" if you want. It's a mix of water, food, and meds that i give to newer players. Plus ammo for a weapon of your choice. I don't charge for the items. Otherwise, let me know if i can help somehow.
---
Not saying not to help lower players, just don't expect anything in return.  It's an unwritten rule, that you should try to get used to. 
---
I roam around chasing cargobots, and get rando's to tag them so we can trade some stimpacks/supplies for the nuke card. I accept that some of them take the free stims/ammo and run/server hop, its fine  and just move onto the next one. 
---
I farmed the assaultrons there for heads, I was able to walk freely after finishing off anything I damaged and then going hidden. I could then stand up and walk right up to them no prob.
---
This had it happen yesterday got a 5 min timer that the server was closing. Just jumped to a new server and kept on going. Mind you yesterday was really bad for crashing and dcs. 
---
If you're using conduits then you either need to use the power emitter or the conduit to wire adapter and a power connector... The adapters don't emit power even though they look like they have a power connector in them. 
---
The pole style connectors also emit energy.. 
---
Don't forget to pick the locks and steal the water first though.
---
My bad bro I honestly didn’t get the notification let me know when you can
---
You seem pretty mad about me helping them, and I wasn't expecting anything in return...
---
Pretty easy to mistake a bug for an exploit when you have a game full of issues.
---
Careful you don't break an arm jerking yourself off.
---
You can actually scrap whole stacks and still get the chance to unlock the mod for each. I used to scrap stacks of 50 leather arms to turn steel into cloth.
---
To piggy back the Skyrim dragon bit, Scorchbeasts make the same noises as dragons did when taking damage/dying
---
Marsupial with speed demon allows you to escape long enough to pick one off and its easier when its only two.
---
It becomes an exploit when someone figures out the bug and does it intentionally.
---
Yes hitting the VATS uses up a small amount of AP. I figured it was to discourage spamming VATS to scan for targets.
---
If by "Skyrim" you mean "Fallout 3" then yes.
---
I heard about using a flare gun for help early on in my adventures! Always have it bound to slot 6
---
I want teddy bears, lots of teddy bears and golf balls, I'll die happy, oh and cat bowls and some plastic forks...
---
My life is complete :)
---
If you're looking for a challenge, you could try removing perks or stop using OP weapons. If you try a sort of RP build and think about what his/her strengths and weaknesses might be and choose weapons and perks based on that. You don't have to play in easy mode if you don't want to
---
That was in the forest; north west part of map. The building with all the scorched in it.
---
but, think about this, put a huge ass motor on the grapple line that reels the scorchbeast down. shoot the shot, hit the scorchbeast, shoot the ground, and the second projectile that comes out is a motor that reels the beast down to ground level where you have at most 10-15 seconds of time to kill it. and this could be utilized against other enemies as well, grapple them in place, grapple them to a wall, or slingshot them up a cliff face. it could be hilarious but thats also getting too close to the just cause franchise. another idea is like adding a net mod where you shoot out a net and can immobalize a group of enemies long enough for you to either escape, or deal some serious damage. the ammo would of course have to be very expensive and very heavy for both modifications, as well as the weapon used.
---
My least favorite encounter with them is on one of the BoS quests where there is a bunker surrounded by like 10 of them, yet due to the scarcity of quests available early on I couldn't hurt them or level up to beat them so I just kept dying over and over. I just went back to 4 and fucked around with stupid builds like explosives only instead
---
Don't believe me? Ask the dishes!
---
Lucky you this sounded awesome till i just checked my stuff. Because the bots were level 1 all my stuff is too lol
---
For a couple weeks now,  on occasion we go killing hordes of bots there for fun just to see how many we can kill all at once...  we don’t ever get lag...... never seen the server crash. Not once during those activities and we had a massive shit ton amassed. Tell me more?
---
Are you an idiot? 
---
Mine is built there purposefully with out turrets to prevent the guy from putting a rocket turret base in my server. If I see them with any turrets I will ALWAYS break it all down. If they are there Ill tell them to put it up, but they never do.
---
Really! By switching 5 character?
---
Except empath and grounded because class freak doesn't negate their effects, yes. Empath is 100% useless solo and generally sucks because of the negative effect and previous stated reason. Grounded is basically destroys any hopes of energy gun build and same reason with class freak. 
---
Game is shit.
---
*pulls out pipe revolver &amp; spins barrell* I have just the thing .....
---
Max level on what? Highest I've seen is player level 231
---
I wouldn't say the wiring is jacked up. It's just very basic and lacking of some needed components. To do more complicated things you need to do a lot more work with connectors and wires. Maybe they will give us better switches or doors that open from both side later on. One can only hope anyways.
---
Why were you flagged for pvp?
---
Ikr, other than *the holidays* they've been regularly patching the game.
---
People have such short memories.
---
My friend built a camp there just to utilize the vendors and take advantage of the robot body guards before players where launching nukes every ten minutes. 
---
Sucks that the Whitesprings is basically nuke central now. 
---
I think i'm the youngest at 13 but who cares really a fun game is played by all all age categories really
---
woah, a whole another level of sensation, and here i thought that a numb arm was the top
---
Lol This guy is gay for himself
---
BABYFACEKILLA000 
---
Edited to get my point across better.
---
Doesnt radx stack aswell?  Taking 3 should keep you safe aswell.
---
Not sure. I dropped an Instigating Broadsider in the Flatwoods church medbox and it was still there half an hour later. Possibly people picked it up, tried it and immediately put it back in the box.
---
Not trying to argue with you here, just pointing out that you did expect something in return whether you believe it or not. You expected them tonight screw you over. I completely understand why it would upset you to help someone and then have them screw you over right after, but I think the point that he's trying to make his don't even expect them to appreciate your help, only help if it is it's own reward. 
---
No I'm just making a point, he's probably just doing it for fun, there is a entire legion of robots to shoot. So basically what your saying is that shooting around 40 ghouls at the golf club is fine, but shooting 20 robots at the resort is horrible
---
So I was surprised today. I’ve had ultra-cite PA plans dropped by scorchies before, but today I got a mission to defend the red rocket workshop, from a sole invading L65 or L80 diseased scorchie. 
---
To my great surprise, it dropped a plan for a prime receiver (for a western revolver).  
---
I haven't played that part of the game much. I did solo the silo my first run and it was tough but I could do it a lot faster and easier now. I also want to do a stealth run with robot hacking. When I did it I used the turrets against the robots a lot. I didn't notice many legendaries if any. Maybe the silo itself could be a rewarding dungeon experience with a bunch of 3 star legendaries. They could make the game much more fun by putting a bunch more legendary spawns all over the place. Silos, West Tek, Caves, etc. It's always nice to get a 3 star legendary, even if the loot is usually useless to you, at least you get another chance to roll the dice and maybe get something good.
---
Do you still get bounty if you use orbital strike?
---
Okay then, I will make note to never help people again, thanks for the advice.
---
Plus it wasn't even a TSE, just a regular explosive
---
Problem is that regular rad-x suppresses mutations,  so if you rely on those, youre only looking at a +400.  Still awesome though when paired with the bonus from x-01
---
You forgot the part where they will totally fuck up your C.A.M.P. (even if you have half a dozen missile batteries on the roof) and cost you a heap of resources to repair.
---
Its a good reason to put down the TSE weapons man. They cake walk everything and get boring quickly.
---
Why do you want blackberry honey crisp? The ap regen? Because if you're hunting honey beasts anyways why not use company tea? It takes 2 honeycomb to make a Labrador tea which can sometimes super dupe, and the company tea gives 10 ap regen instead of 5 
---
Plus honeycomb are aid items and the recipe works fine... Still a pain in the ass to farm tho. 
---
One last thing, speaking of farming honey beasts... There's an event called irrational fear, it spawns up the hill behind raleighs bunker. Even when the event isn't up you can find the robot there just north of the hydro line tower. 
---
The event is to escort him while he gathers honey, and you get ambushed three times by honey beasts and yao gui... I had probably 6 or 7 attack... No idea what spawns it but I've only seen in up one time so I think it might be triggered like patrol duty, probably by going near the bot I'd assume 
---
The Fallout world is Krieg
---
PS4, thanks for the kind offer though!
---
I my self would like more challenge but this game is intended for the casual players, nothing wrong with that, just not challenging for some. I knew that before buying however, it's why I always go back to Rust.
---
This is a kind of similar build to mine, do you have an automatic combat rifle modded out? Because that is what I use on scorchbeasts and they die after like 3, 20 round clips with vats. Really not a big deal.
---
Fair enough. An extended wheel like with the Atomic Store emotes would be better. Open that favorites section and it expands to show all food and drink that's in your inventory, with a little counter for quantity and for hunger/thirst that's restored by it. Special stats on them wouldn't be shown cuz there's just not enough room, and you'd go to your Pip-Boy for that specifically.
---
I don't use melee, why would I lower my stats non-trivial amounts and accuracy ~12% for melee buffs I never use?
---
I'm rarely in a team, why would I permanently debuff myself with herd mentality?
---
Same for thing for empath.
---
Etc.
---
I expect my delta shortly.
---
As in above level 50
---
Mine procs constantly. My repairs have been cut back in a humongous way. Rarely do my guns break now. 
---
I highly doubt they would ever leave the game. Look at ESO my god that game was in a bad state on launch. Look at it now it thrives and is such an amazing game.
---
Give it time and the potential 76 has will be seen and this game will be on ESO level. Mind you its insanely fun to play now just bogged down in bugs ,crashes and exploiters currently.
---
I paid full price for this game at release, so how it's handled will be the deciding factor if I buy any more of their games at release, or wait a month (or whatever) to get it for less than half price.
---
Gatling plasma is also my preferred method of fighting scorchbeasts. There are several useful perks I use to increase condition duration.
---
First is obviously Gunsmith lvl 5 for 50% slower condition loss
---
Second is Weapon Artison. Repairing guns to 200% is a huge help and you only need equip the park when crafting
---
Lastly is the Luck of the Draw lvl 3 perk. This is great for if you're far from workbenches and have loads of junk. The downside is that it uses up your scrap materials quickly but can be used situationally. 
---
Of course I also have a furious fire axe that I can pull out and whale on the beasties if/when they land
---
I've been on servers for hours that were perfectly stable.  Other times it could be not that long after I join.
---
To be honest, i don't know. Bethesda isn't really known for making online games. Maybe they need time to understand how to handle that kind of stuff. 
---
Good to know. Thank you, even more, for grinding out those jellies to find out.
---
And that +600 resist in nuke zones doesn't help at all for Regular Armor, sadly.
---
Bring me cazadors 
---
Lol I love the ted talk reference!
---
And here I am, the dumb bastard who bought the Fatman skin for my 2 shot Fat man
---
I have laid claim over a dozen Power Plant Workshops and have only collected 2 cores total on 2 separate occasions.  I monitor to see if people are stealing them and that does not appear to be the case.  Typical scenario: login, claim PP workshop immediately, power up fusion core processor.  Then I wander the wasteland doing whatever.  I return after \~1hour and often there's nothing (ZERO).  This is hugely frustrating.
---
Yep, those instances are amazing and I'll never leave unless I crash/disconnect. 
---
Sorry when I dropped my bag it glitched but hopefully the junk will give you some cash GL!
---
If you think someone would make this post over 20 robots, you haven't been there when there were a hundred or so. It's a fucking slide show. 
---
I had fun fighting dragons though, using the shout to force them to land and than 'hammering them in the ass' while walking in circles so he can't bite you....
---
Good times.
---
If you dont care for sound quality, don't worry about brand or specs.
---
One thing I strongly recommend is grabbing a USB connector mic/headset, that over the old timey A/V looking jack, as many newer sound cards and laptop jacks don't transmit mic and headset at the same time unless it's USB
---
Buying from those people enables them. It lets them get away with duping and making a profit out of it. It creates demand for their supply. It causes massive inflation because these people are doing the equivalent of printing money. Quite literally, in the cases of those who are duping thousands of nuka colas. Ultimately it is up to you, I've bought a few things myself that looking back on it I'm sure are duped. But creating a stigma around it, refusing to deal with known dupers, is the only way of preventing it in any form
---
Not community managers, reddit moderators. I'm sorry to say but community management requires a relevant university degree...
---
Such a poor design. I lost some mods for my t60 armor making ammo a while back due to this and have been so paranoid about it since.
---
At the end of the day, I applaud your effort to find a solution without banning accounts. There probably isn't a great solution for everyone here and the dupers are the real cause. I don't have any irreplaceable weapons at the moment, so Priority #2 wouldn't make me quit.
---
But the way the loot gathering system works, if I am halfway through a long dungeon crawl and cannot find a close scrap bench, I would probably log out if I had to drop something and fast travel to clear inventory space and then have to fast travel back and walk through the bunker/cave/whatever again.
---
This is a widely known issue and the community is sick of exploiters.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aaedli/want_to_know_why_the_servers_are_unstable_bethesda/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
We are just holding out hope they have some way to address it and all the issues it has brought. See its not just having unlimited caps. Its about flooding the servers with TSE items and BIS armor. Its about flooding their inventory with 20k plus bobbleheads to hit the million + damage markers. Its also about the exp from crafting stims on a mass level ( i know seems pointless). Or the server stability issues that have been ever growing the more that do it. But last its about all the ebay, websites and posts that sell duped stuff for real money.
---
Its one of the biggest issues 76 has had since Beta. We just gotta hold out hope that Bethesda has plans to stop it and punish those abusers.
---
What if you farmed real hard for a great legendary only to find it's worth pennies on the player market cause someone's selling duped copies for dirt? 
---
Workshops aren't worth keeping, but they are worth claiming. The rewards for simply taking one over are worth getting. 
---
I would buy the fuck out of Chrome Power Armor Paint
---
Not enough damage for slap unless he owned a workshop. That automatically flags for pvp with no slap damage.
---
Directly copied from inside the vault Nov 21st to the new one...
---
Are you stating that the power armor headlamps are dim? Because there's a mod for that. 
---
If there was 100, then thats not the players fault, thats Bethesda's fault
---
Mostly looking for a good way to farm xp at low levels so that I can get into the 20s and 30s and start fighting tougher stuff and getting better loot haha
---
Or nerf the ludicrous multiplicative damage scaling and TSE.
---
I hate those people, like my camp is in southern ash-heap so 11 cap fast travel and I either go for legendaries or just because of the enclave, but 2/5 times I go literally nothing is there.
---
Well if you're ok that you bought duped items then that's that. As far as is it ok? I tend to believe that it isn't ethical since exploiting the game is against the ToS of the game. I liken it to buying something illegal on the black market. Or to be less dramatc, it's like buying a teachers test from an aid. Reguardless it's almost impossible to tell what's been duped and what hasn't at this point. 
---
Hey, that's copied from the Nov 27th post.
---
I'm cataloguing a master list of cooking recipes which I hope to post tomorrow with effects and several other tidbits of info I've collected.  I don't particularly care for that recipe and I would never attempt to make it for any other reason.  I made another post last week or two on an abridged list of nice recipes with really beneficial effects that was pretty popular so I decided to take it the rest of the way.  Simply leveling for the sake of leveling gets boring :)
---
I agree that nuke zones are better when worked together, loot-wise, and xp. 
---
But we need to address the elephant in the room before dealing with the over-use of griefing to describe anything unfair or undesirable. I almost never turn off pacifist, but live in power armor so far nothing has come close to tickling me, but know it's possible to be one shotted by **actual griefers,** that involves exploiting the games mechanics in such a way that the devs did not intend to be possible(damage/aids/stack exploit).
---
"picking up dropped loot" is far from griefing,  "100k damage for an hour, can kill anyone even through slap damage" has griefing potential. 
---
Don't cry wolf at every dog/mutt you see, for when you see a real wolf you worlds will hold no weight.
---
exactly. being able to get two randomized plans for your camp from claiming and defending is great.
---
Well, you're a celebrity now. Are you on PC? Fairly certain you tried to get me about a month ago at white springs - during a nuke? I said, "nah, that security door looks sketchy" and gave you a disease cure.
---
Obviously it didn't help.
---
Can I play with you?
---
It's always a risk to buy a game at launch. You either accept the risk or you wait. The one positive thing that you could get from this experience is to be patient with buying games that don't have pre-launch reviews up.
---
I bought FO76 at launch and really enjoyed a good 30 hours or so. Now, the game is shelved until a compelling enough update is released.
---
Yep, an enterprising redditor worked in out a while back but I can't figure out how to link it on mobile. 
---
Hats aren't assigned any category in the game files so they can't be made. 
---
You can find all the hats (I think) spawned in game though. 
---
I think I can speak for a lot of people by saying give us an excavator skin. 
---
Pro tip: do not play with PA, TSE, Explosive or Melee.  They are broken.  They will ruin your game.
---
I deleted my main toons that broke the game, started over.  I started playing a no legendary or PA toon with all the QoL perks and weight reduction perks.  Guess what?  It's fun!  And a challenge.
---
I mean lets be real. Bethesda has been hammered, for a long time, with legitimate criticism for NOT fixing major game breaking bugs in their titles...they are STILL putting out new copies of skyrim with bugs that were known about within days of release.   
---
The only thing that they might kill is the always on servers hosted by bethesda. We can HOPE that when they realize that won't be profitable they release home server code and do enough development where people can do what people have ALWAYS done with this sort of game..host a home server or contract with a server company. 
---
I like to drop stuff for noobies a lot.  I know how much of a struggle it is to get started.
---
How I would have killed my friend for a stimpack.....lol
---
I have so many now I just drop them 20-30 at a time, problem solved :)

---
I don't know about the inflation thing. Wouldn't the supply be so high that costs come down? I'm not saying that is good... I'd much rather see a God roll from a legendary I killed with my duplicated axe. This is the regulating body's problem (my beloved Bethesta). 
---
The except is most parts (If not all) of the Forest, since it's the starting area it stays low level. I've never seen anything over level 15 I think. 
---
any tse weapon, because OP. maybe bunker buster for the homing missiles. the gatling guns pretty solid too, no spread increase from shooting, has a slow fire rate though
---
Lore-wise, the Responders were keeping the Raiders of the Savage Divide away, so the Forest has less Raider stuff.
---
Gameplay-wise, yes, the Fallout 4 truth that Raider power armor exists and is the worst power armor I guess had to be maintained (?), but yet it doesn’t work well with the new-to-Fallout-76 truth that Raiders are a mid-game faction instead of an early game enemy.
---
Maybe they woulda coulda shoulda made Responders power armor.  Robocop meets Roboparamedic.  Hmm, or how about Scorched power armor? :)
---
Will never ever spend money to respec. 
---
Will spend atoms for dance emotes. 
---
I mean, how many hours have you put into this character to grind for that gear...or did you buy a TSE gun and now you're going "OH GOD IT'S ALL TOO EASY"? 
---
I can build Atom Shop hats (including tricentennial) so it’s specifically in-game ones? That blows.
---
I've not been playing to long, but if I see one I'll certainly try.
---
Bethesda has stated that they are planning on fixing this _known bug_ that people are _exploiting_. 
---
Ahh I thought you meant the full 19 was not possible.
---
Apparently theres secret ones out there.
---
Cucks.. go gargle each other's loads in fallout 76👌 enjoy the worst game created in the last 5 years...
---
Sorry, can you explain what's wrong a bit more?
---
I started doing this last night and "paid" my bounty like an adult.
---
Some fucknut had 4 missile turrets pointed at the back doors.
---
Was nothing to my daisycutter. 
---
Wait how does that work?
---
Yes, this; similar perhaps to the way sentry bots have to "cool down" every once in a while.
---
Oh. That’s where my mods go...
---
How do you produce them? Weapons bench?
---
Fallout 76 is in the toilet...
---
The dupers are the ones with infinite supply, they can monopolise to keep the costs high. 
---
Wow so original.. no wonder you love this game
---
"It's dark as a dungeon... and damp as the dew..."
---
Please leave the fallout fandom. We dont want you here. Todd Howard doesnt want your money.
---
Yah im gone.. people like you are the only reason this game exists... Once something better comes along this game is dead forever
---
It really is
---
Materials for your sweat shop, I assume
---
Yea, so? Its gonna take weeks until the next update 
---
Yea, it helps the buyer but kills any chance of unique sellers. Good point. I might want to farm caps but others may want to farm legendaries. 
---
I have a pistol, vats, crit character that maximizes AP and AP Regen.  Because vats no longer stops or slows time, we should get our AP Regen during vats!
---
Did you already scrap them? They still show up as junk, but obvs not at the crafting stations.
---
hmu, I'll stand right at the launchpad controls until someone lets me know they're fighting a SB, and I'll nuke it!
---
...three minutes from then, anyway.  You'd best both still be in the area.
---
the silos are weird, i solo'd one at level 50 and there were minimal robots and the few bots that were there were lvl 20. but i agree that the silos could be converted into more of an actual dungeon with legendarys and the likes, and maybe nuke zones could have a 50/50 mix of legendays and non-legendarys with the legendarys being in the 2 - 3\* range, and a fix to legendary enemies so 3\* enemies actually drop 3\* leveled loot instead of 1\* lvl 5 wood armour
---
yeah, you can just stare and scream in ignorance of what you've received
---
Guess I'm going to make some lvl 1s happy tomorrow. I'm going to be like Oprah "legendary for you, legendary for you, legendary for you!"
---
Didn't notice someone set one up once. Have my camp set at the lead deposit nearby with mortars and used a signal flare. Mortars start bombing and I get a warning telling me that I destroyed someone's camp. I burst out laughing.
---
All they need to do is go on Nexus, or just keep porting/releasing models from F4. Pure genius. 
---
no
---
Maybe it's bad luck but I can't seem to get that at the vendor 😔
---
I mean inflation of the market as a whole, not caps specifically. Everything is becoming worthless because there is so much of it. Some dupers have hundreds of thousands of bobbleheads on them so they can abuse the glitch to stack damage infinitely. So what's going to happen to this new guy starting out who has 6 spare bobbleheads and wants to sell them? Also, caps are consistently easy to get at a somewhat fixed amount. You can get 1400 a day from vendors, and a few hundred a day by grinding out events. With the value of end-game gear decreasing as quickly as it is, eventually the pennies that a lvl 20 is carrying around will be able to buy everything you need to dominate the wasteland. At that point the market will have imploded in itself and we will likely have a dead economy
---
Yup. Ill claim and mebe defend it once but then walk away...
---
I’ve been playing for the last 4 hours and didnt get kicked. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Bye
---
Or just make it so junk weighs nothing in the stash
---
Too cluttered for me and my ocd. xD
---
Nah, it's something else. Tinker's or chem, I don't remember which one
---
I really want to see 40 rocket turrets light up a scorchbeast. 
---
This is so fucking weird
---
Honestly, going slong with the main "story" is the best way to get some levels. Do any misc quests that you see pop up, and events if you feel like it. Whitesprings farming is the most efficient way, but that depends if you want to do that. I would get the main story done first though, so that you can launch nukes as well.
---
If only you had there ip so you could get them in trouble with homeland security 
---
I have my camp on top of some hill near by the ammunation workshop, and sometimes 3 scorchbeasts spawn there and they will attack my camp even if they haven't spotted me. I guess it's time for me to move.. 
---
Definitely true. 30-50 caps for some plans, if the owner doesnt come to get you and then you'll lose about 150-200 because you are high level.. 
---
 Im just mad, but I really hope they announce some good fixes today/tomorrow with the announcement of the next 2 updates... 
---
But I thought people had a problem with not enough stash space to store their junk. But you don't wanna spend it as well. Hmmm.
---
This i want to straighten them out..
---
Wait a new update? Or just some patch notes?
---
I know ill prolyy get downvoted for speaking my mind (isnt that somewhat better?) but to me all its done is fast forward the game 12 months instead of being what it is- nearly 3 months.
---
1. Convenient for fast travel. Clearing vendors and making relish asap w/o spoiling my inventory because of fast travel.
---
2. 2. Junk uhh any kind of extractor hehe
---
3. Area popular with mid lvl players. Preferably in a spot where they need to scrap or too far from locations.
---
I have a screenshot with the program that may display their IP address at the top. One of their guys sent it in the message. I also got voice recordings of the threats. 
---
Exactly. I think I just ran into some dummies. 
---
Try wearing chamelon anything in front of a scorchbeast. You'll be pleasantly surprised.
---
Jesus yeah that's literally a crime to do all that geek sqaud near me got the FBI on them for just looking at some dudes IP address from there shop it's a big deal 
---
Does this go for camps on the golf course itself away from the central white springs buildings? Because I like to build out there simply because of the relatively flat surface provided and nearby construction robots.
---
I don't need steel. I just go kill a bunch of mole miners and scrap their weapons, plenty of steel 
---
Before the bombs dropped propane or heating fuel had to be so expensive that they are probably empty.  No one could afford to fill them.  They were there because they were used at one time, but probably not for a while.  
---
If people think its unethical or immoral they are thinking a little too hard on this. Lets be honest. Dupers provide a service. You provide the monetary value they want. Supply and demand means within a few months they wont be able to sell it and maybe they will learn. Until then every one can be on a relatively even playing field for 2 or 3 hours of in game time. Maybe they can fix it. Easy fix would be make sure all the dupes are patched then increase the level cap.
---
I mainly use my TSE Gatling gun that does 600 damage per shop but the TS 50 cal isn’t bad either.
---
In your desperation, with your neighborhood blacked out, cable companies scrambling, you quickly picked up your phone and...got on Reddit?
---
dont forget the supreme grand master mister doctor Kaldor Draigo
---
This happens in other Bethesda games too.
---
Usually when you cheat
---
You think I should lawyer up? I mean, these guys seem like they’ve been doing this for awhile and was very confident in their ability to deliver this. 
---
Lucky hole you say. that's a lead mine? There are lead nodes in there? SWEEET thanks
---
Tomorrow they will explain what is coming for the two January patches 
---
Pretty sure the one you are asking for come from whitesprings furniture vendor. He should have it at all times.
---
Might wanna file something and see what you can do Bethesda would have to present or something it's there game they have partial responsibility in what happened there support might be a start if that fails bigger things are needed 
---
Buck-buck-bucket
---
Weird hey. I wonder if Bethesda did something tobtheir servers but I managed to stay on a server with no disconnects for about 3hrs last night. I actually logged off properly for once.
---
And in saying that I fully got to explore a well radiated, post nuke cranberry bog. Im not giving it away but I saw things that I never had before.
---
My buddy had a similar issue the other day. I think he deleted the .ini file in the game folder. I'll have to ask tomorrow.
---
My anxiety has the best of me right now. It’s 1:09 am and I value the Reddit feedback community. Instead of questioning my actions why not acknowledge the fact that I held you to a higher regard in the hopes of you would be knowledgeable enough to help me? 
---
Some people are playing the wrong game lol. This isn't Barney's Sparkle Spectacular...
---
Tons of indie devs on PC putting out great games
---
Hold up, is this the same bunch of cock spanks that say there are no npc’s while talking about npc’s? You guys must be the ones with shitty PCs and constant disconnects. 
---
Bought at watoga multiple times.
---
Xbox is the best... DreadfulNirvana wife and me Dreadfulturkey is son and daughter soon their own accounts
---
Can I have more details on this random encounter.
---
Well id rather put my junk to something usefull like caps or anything. Not throw it away.
---
I love Bethesda. Its their game and they can do what they want.
---
I do remember seeing Todd mention "give us a chance we've never done this before".
---
Some items have to be selected individually to scrap like...bottles, baseballs and other items that can be used as in whole or scrapped state.  Not sure if that is your issue or not.
---
I appreciate that. My friend said we should contact Sony, and I know their offices are closed. I’ll try tomorrow for sure. I just didn’t know if there was a work around this network issue but I believe he has the MAC address of our devices in his hands. I feel so powerless, lol. 
---
This is sort of my problem with Fallout 4/76 in general.  Like your fight  with the Scorchbeast, none of the "work" in these games has a satisfying pay-off.  You can level, gather, craft, build, perk, and shoot to your hearts content - but the mechanics of each of those activities is pretty poor and un-fun after a while (to varying degrees), and the pay-offs are as crappy/pointless as fighting the Scorchbeast.   They include:
---
- building camps that get wiped
---
- building settlements that don't work
---
- attaining perks with anti-synergy
---
- getting caps to buy things that don't matter
---
- gathering materials to build things that don't matter
---
- making weapons to shoot things that don't matter
---
- inventory management hell
---
etc...
---
The expectation of satisfying pay-offs can carry you through the game for quite some time, along with the entertainment involved in just exploring the world, which is interesting in and of itself.  But once you realize there's nothing else fun in that light at the end of the tunnel, the luster of the world wears thin.  There are just better things to do, in other games or life activities :P
---
Is 5x Chameleon or 5x Weightless(+Mutation) also helpful in this setup?  Is "better stealth" affix better than those 2 (I'm aware gear can have both, but getting a god roll like that is unlikely)?
---
Who cares about accuracy when everything you shoot explodes?
---
One update can erase it all. Every mmorpg goes through this. 
---
Be realistic. You can get 400 atoms in a few days. If they lower the price even more, how will they make money? 
---
Hey man. Nice work. Found and subscribed to your channel. Can you describe exactly how to wire the garage door?
---
Can confirm.
---
Quickly leaving the server (Main Menu or quitting using the menu) might work better actually, server might despawn you sooner. 
---
This is without any knowledge as to how the executable handles alt-f4.
---
Yeah fun PvP losing your level worth caps every time you die. Who thought that was a good idea? In some games where you can drop your currency in PvP at least you can stash it so you don't lose any. This game has the double whammy of being extremely inconvenient to PvP with weird rules concerning flagging and slap damage that make it a nightmare trying to PvP even consensually, while at the same time being even more punishing for participating in consensual PvP than most open PvP games.
---
Picking up someone’s death bag should flag you for PVP against that person.
---
It doesn’t, but it should
---
Cryolator does freeze her. Especially when she is airborne. For some reason on the ground sometimes it wouldn't apply the frozen effect. But she would stagger for 1 sec and then speed up like 10x when grounded for the rest of the fight. Not sure if it was patched or is just an inconsistent bug (For a lack of better words). Also saw a mention of crystalizing barrel. Doesn't it actually lower your effective dps?
---
Gimmmmmme.
---
Wensdays are government propaganda created secretly by Todd Howard who is the leader of Illuminati
---
1% for jetpack after 100 hops?? Man I wish...I've hopped over 400 times...close to maybe 500 now and still no jetpack. I've seen 1 CS and that's it.
---
Haha you should see what it's like on a Ps4 Pro 😐
---
Also bulk your acid (10 acid) and then scrap the bulked pack (15 acid) to get more acid at the cost of plastic to smelt all the lead ore.
---
Ah I have as well a few times. I was very confused. 
---
Yeah having someone's stuff like that is shitty but knowing how this has happened before they'll probably reverse the origin of the stuff see if it matches the guy there after and go from there but the least they could do is permanently ban them from the network on psn or just straight up ban his account and console from use its happened before and by God did the guys it happened to have a fit

Pressure plates would work but it's not going to lock out others. Terminal isn't going to help as one outside can be used by anyone. Until they fix the keypads you might be stuck.
---
I made an alt yesterday to try out a pistol build. Made it to level 11 and within that 6 hour stint of gameplay I got attacked by an invisible player after being invited to his squad (I could see him on the map but not in-game), and I got griefed by two level 100+ guys with orbital beacons while I was building a shack.  
---
Other than that I haven't had any interaction with any other players, outside of a single event.
---
I call BS. 5 shots for normal lvl 50 scorchbeast min.
---
Is there a preferred third perk for this FotM?
---
I built my camp on a lead deposit, super nice 
---
If you stack both, you will be twice as invisible. Try it! 
---
What platform are you on, you should be able to just download the pics, if you on PC they in your fallout folder, just upload to imgur. If you on XB1, just go to [xboxdvr.com](https://xboxdvr.com) and download your pic. Someone on PS can tell you how.
---
One of the other campsites just north (if I remember) of defiance has two missile batteries. It also has ditches between them so you can just hang out in there until one breaks and jump up to repair then keep your head down.

Yep, the laser musket is probably a code relic from Fallout 4:

I got the plans today and I'm level 73, got them from phoenix 
---
This scares the hell outta me...and not because of the way you look, but because this is exactly what would happen with the power armor bug. I couldn't use power armor for weeks....it sucked.
---
The Warden Eternal of Fallout games.
---
There should be a few changes to VATs, especially conerning bugs.
---
However, considering how strong VATs is, especially once you have a complete VATs build, I don't know if this is necessary. It may be for balance.
---
Sometimes random people on the internet are better than the cable guys and I imagine the entire population of the complex is shitting on the cable guys right now 
---
I’m not going to lie, I went off him in that channel because I got tired of the threats, over some PvP scuffle that he lost. Soon as he joined the channel on PSN that’s when he was able to join the IP address. They had it coordinated because the guy that initially joined said: “Hold on let me get my friend in here.” I went off, and we all lost our internet. As an update though, seems everyone else’s Internet is restored but mine. 
---
Yeah you can have chameleon and better stealth on same item. But im running, i dont stay crouched, useless for me, and you cant teabaging with chameleon.
---
Yeh for the uninitiated- it can happen 2 ways (that ive come across): either you will get the msg and just &gt; main menu &gt; new server or it will follow you to the lobby to which you must restart the game.
---
Unless they change it, they normally do a full maintenance on a Tuesday night (or monday or wednesday depending on where you live).
---
Havent seen one in a while though.
---
Guy who doesn't understand the concept of multiplayer games is upset that other human beings are destroying player camps whose sole purpose is to steal kills from others for no benefit of either party. So rather than just grind with them or maybe take a few seconds to make friends he heads to Reddit and writes a paragraph and ends up sounding like a child throwing a tantrum.
---
If we increase the level cap, dupers have the plans and supplies to just "build their way up"
---
It will help normalize the field but the people with millions of springs/bobble/stims, will still hold a giant advantage.  I like the term Reimagined\* it sounds pleasant, compared to wipe ,but so far is the most comprehensive long term repair for the cancer that duping has caused.
---
and the users will often be just as defensive and flame you for pointing out what a lot of people are already talking about.
---
Well what ever program he used is the stupid ddos stuff that can shut your internet off till they see fit but the cable guys can change that it's not hard for them but they definitely dont like it 
---
Crit shotgun build huh? That sounds pretty freaking nasty. I can't believe I didn't consider that. I'm assuming the crits are absurd, and that range isn't a proble?
---
Embrace the bounties brothers, for no number is high enough to prevent the destruction of heathen bases. Let their turrets crumble to the ground and let their homesteads lay in ashen piles.
---
Its whack though. Sometimes Ive just run around for a bit and they become allies again. Other times they just never forget (which seems to be more often the case).
---
+karma
---
Particularly the cap on weapon and armor levels need to be more dynamic. If you're level 180 and cheating or buying a duplicated level 45 weapon... Wtf. 
---
This made might night.
---
Ive thought the same, got killed- nope still hostile.
---
I usually send them to another account from my capture gallery, and download the message from the message app.
---
Yeah I’ve got mine at the lower end of the golf course just outside of typical blast zones. I just like the area. I’ve got two missile turrets but that’s just for defending my base. 
---
Kill them all. Problem solved :)
---
Used to be a good cap at 40-50 but then dupers are around and now a max level 50 is just not gonna cut it. 100 would be better imo
---
MODUS has approved your request, rejoice. 
---

---
I have this exact opinion but about the scorched. 
---
I’m kinda ok with scorchbeasts when they don’t spam sonic shit and I can avoid encountering them 90% of the time. 
---
But the scorched are lil filthy pain in the arse.
---
I absolutely misread this as the legendary long dong - I was going to say, "what the crap, dude! bethesda actually put that into their game?"
---
Todd force choked him for his failure.
---
You can find his body in a ditch somewhere in maryland buried in copies of skyrim.
---
Because it’s a token gesture of “hey look we are involved with the community”
---
You’ll note that the interactions come in flurries, then you won’t hear shit for a week.

It’s basically a soccer mom working part time

no i just cant scrap them

i cant they are now just taking space up and i cant do anything with them

You can take water and pick fruit without going wanted. You'll get in trouble if you pick locks or break things though
---
Lingering radiation. Happens after every and any nuke.
---
Yes. That seemed to work for the mariposa strain. Though east coast strains don't seem to work the same way. The institute probably only tested on irradiated surface dwellers. But vault 87 was just pre war vault dwellers and they led to the DC super mutants. And Huntersville happened pre war. 
---
This too very much, Whitesprings has an issue with robots multiplying upon death. Sometimes you cannot even walk down paths as there are so many robots stuck and blocking the way. It just feels like the PS4 cannot handle all the robots shooting in Whitesprings.
---
IMO the fallout series isn't a good choice for someone looking to rush through a game. So much of the "meat" of fallout is the lore, exploration, and small details.
---
tag them when you complain, but they are humans, if they want to look at things other than the bad they are allowed too.
---
I built my character around power armor and good rifle damage, so I got through relatively easily with my lever action and T-60 PA. Took me a lot of ammo and time, but didn’t really come close to dying
---
Once modders can step in we will have our pick of the crop. How they intend to allow modding while not effecting the atom store is another thing though.
---
From what I can tell, when you press the spring button, you enter sprint mode and your AP starts to drain. What takes you out of sprint mode is a non sprinting movement or running out of AP.
---
Letting go of forward isn't enough, you'll still be in sprint mode.
---
If you stop then move an inch any direction it'll stop the drain properly. 
---
It'd be like diabling a cargo drone, knocking out each thruster has a significant effect on its flight.
---
Another option is a harpoon turret. An anchored turret with a powered winch should bring it down regardless of your charater strength.
---
Evolve had a few harpoon snares for holding large creatures, a few flavours to choose from there.
---
I 100% agree with your over-all complaint, not gonna lie, I wish the system was BETTER. You keep the stuff you build at a specific workshop, so you can use it again, as an example. "re-connect to last server" option, with all owned assets intact. Basic stuff, that should be easy to implement. 
---
This also happened to me but when it did I first was around blackwater mine. Instead of molemen, it was all eyebots. Proceeded to the golf club....more eyebots.
---
I'm hoping for a single player or co-op story on the current map.  The setting is great and could be experienced as a solo game in full.  
---
If not, as long as they add content every now and then I think it's really up to us and how the community evolves.  
---
Both would be ideal.
---
Imagine how fast they'd able to power farm with a level 1 TSE. 
---
I'm surprised that we don't have the excavator skin from some of the posters. The black and red one.
---
You are literally miss the point if you thought you would have loots like typical mmorpg.
---
This is NOT mmorpg. This is survival in a ridiculous fallout state with friends and foes. 
---
You may find yourselves doing stupid mission with great lores and stories hidden in the holotapes / notes. 
---
You may find yourselves hanging out together, nuking dangerous zone, pacifying big bad creatures, and make a living... or may be not. 
---
Not every run gives you reward, some day you have a good run, and the others might get you exhausted, even crippled your resource... 
---
If you are bad at management, it is common to find yourselves run out of food, ammo, stimpacks, etc, which you need to find a good spot to replenish your supplies. And not hoarding unwanted materials at all.
---
Kinda why I picked the scorchbeast flair. Just to trigger some terrible memories.
---
Blue prints for workshop would be awesome. I would just have to claim the workshop and im done! 
---
That's never happened to me on PS4. Infact, random DC's are pretty much a rarity for me lately on console. 
---
Yeah. I can't remember the quest but i had to get around one to use a terminal and i couldn't. Literally could kill me in 5 seconds, in that time, i would deal negligible damage. I ended up have to kind of cheese the AI to chasing me then sprint to the terminal and try to checkpoint before it caught up and 1 shot me.
---
If you ever modded items with legendary buffs in F4 you will know why this is occuring.
---
Its the same reason you dont see any TSE missile or fatboys.
---
Odd that what you mentioned made it in the game though.
---
I have not ready anything yet definitive on this one way or the other.   I do wear two pieces right now because I'm waiting for my last perfect piece, and I see no diff in effectiveness after 1 piece.  YMMV.
---
I just stumbled on that the other day. I loved it. 
---
Mess with the roboto and you get the shot-o
---
Aren't worth keeping? I use mine to travel around the map for free! The amount of caps I save is...a lot! 
---
That would be cool. I'm tired of looking like a giant rubber duck.
---
Does that at night.
---
As long as you're paying caps, and trading, I say all good.
---
There's a black market demand, because currently there's no way to spec out your own min / max with grinding.  The legendary loot weapon drops are pretty awful.  Armor drops are even worse.
---
If they would just make it so you could:
---
1. Allow you to LOCK items in your inventory so you couldn't scrap, trade, or drop them (this is KEY)
---
2. Allow you to scrap any UNLOCKED legendaries for a small (say 5% chance) to pull 1 legendary modifier off that weapon as a 1 time use mod.
---
3. Then you could work on and grind your min / max loadout.
---
That puts an end to the need for dupers pretty much.  Their duped weapons become worth even less.  Player created weapons become worth more.  Everyone but the dupers win....lol
---
To be fair... I could make that claim any any time, and there's a very good chance the server would go down within the next 20 minutes anyway.  They were probably bluffing lol.
---
I like the Greens, flat land, nice sightlines.
---
There isn't anything interesting to build, So I leave up All the crafting stuff and Turrets to keep them alive from the occasional spawns. 
---
Let random strangers have a place to dump junk, craft, sleep whatever. Oh and a Couple Vault Boy Statues for fun (I'm a wildman, I know)
---
Simple fix would be: Can't lot turret kills, and no XP from them
---
Can we poke fun instead? What did you do besides pvp to piss em off because let’s be real there is more to this. Also pacifist is your friend.
---
This is why all the NPCs are dead. They heard mysterious noises and decided to check them out.  ;-)
---
I dunno, I'm 179 and I see a lot higher than me here and there. Most people my level get bored and leave but some stay. I love Fallout. Maybe just make it dynamic so you can still get higher level gear, but you need much higher levels to get it. 
---
Commies would share it.  Nuke those capilist pigs.
---
Or that nameless means excavator. Or that you can't identify power armour sets without pulling them all out of your inventory
---
*is to steal kills* 
---
Oh I'm sorry. Did they have your name on it?
---
Yes it works, but it's not foolproof.
---
If you are firing an unsilenced gun they can lock on to you pretty quick.
---
Even if you're firing a silenced gun, they'll start moving in your direction.
---
Note, you can still get some sneak attacks in EVEN IF they're shooting at you.
---
I don't really want to do the mutation, because I don't feel like farming weightless gear when there are more beneficial other legendary effects for armor.
---
Go for 1 chameleon piece of armor.  That's all you need.
---
Guy had maybe 100+ robots following him. Couldn’t even take out my gun. Lots of lag. Long loading screen after death respawn. Ended up quitting. Yup.
---
Vault Tech Ted X Talk
---
Everything Two Shot + Explosive pretty much is OP in this game. 
---
Not have had the luck yet myself to get one. The biggest luck i had was a Assault Rifle with Mutant +10% damage and Explosive Shots.
---
Or two shot .44 or Plasma Pistol. 
---
But yeah. Be careful with it as well i say if you want to buy something. There are so many duped weapons right now... nearly everyone runs around with TSE shot guns. And it can quickly ruin your fun when a lvl 250 pops in into a Event and oneshots absolutely everything. Not even giving a single fuck if you at least shot the enemy to get some loot. 
---
I puke everytime i see them roflstomping Legendary Enemies. And i can easily say they are selfish pricks, since they clearly saw me over and over again sitting there at the same event like Uranium Fever.
---
So yeah. For the Queen herself.. It pretty much also boils down on your build. I have seen even melee berserker builds who have fist weapons that deal 600+ damage per hit. They pretty much are melting Queens even with huge groups of people and her sometimes broken scaling. (It is nigh impossible to kill the queen with standard equipment when lvl 25 people pop in to an event they shouldn't even be at)
---
For the firearms. If you can't afford a TSE weapon or TS itself, you are always golden with a normal gatling gun too. Just sustain your damage on her. More importantly though. Do not understimate her damage towards you. Just because you see the others jumping in headfirst means you can do that too automatically. 
---
Most of those have their armor maxed out and mutations going to be able to sustain her damage and pumping Stims like mad.
---
The only times i switch targets (Her adds) is when i see that they are either too much or big targets spawned in (Deathclaws, Hunters, Legendaries)
---
Otherwise keep your crosshair fixed on the queen to your best of abilities.
---
Get a ranged cripple option, since you are using rifles it will be under luck for you tormentor t2 would be enough. Especially for endgame it will come in handy. Lifegiver seems good but there are better options. Not a numbers guy but I would imagine you want those melee cards higher to be effective with it. Endurance tips no solid answer but when I dropped lifegiver it got replaced by nocturnal fortitude(+20/40 hp at night), Solar powered (gain 1/2/3 STR &amp; END during day), Cola nut (Doubles/triples nuka cola effects). Its a bit lazy and more hp focused since I only use 3 END on my main. Depending on your build there might be better ones. But the first 2 ones should be better together then the lifegiver in my opinion. Also adamantium skeleton is kinda meh. Also why only 1 tier in every dmg card? Did I miss some PSA about these cards not stacking ?
---
Why the fuck are you spamming this in every thread?.
---
And how does the "sneak increase" 3rd affix compare to chameleon?
---
Spoiler: Modding will be the Atom Store. It’ll be the same thing from Fallout 4 and Skyrim SE. 
---
they are CRASHING the SERVER. Aka wasting people’s TIME. Alas making the game UNENJOYABLE. Please. Tell me more how Im not advocating for people who PAID for this GAME, so that they are GETTING what they PAID FOR. Clear?
---
It may seem completely one sided but all we did was shoot at them and they fought back. Guess his buddy was pissed cause his friends were lower level but they attacked first. Regardless of the fact, he started off by sending voice recordings calling me the N word excessively demanding his caps back. He joined the party and I went off ...  I had a similar situation happen day before when a guy harassed me for 20 minutes again calling me the N word. I don’t care about the word but I care about the action. We didn’t deserve this. 
---
My drunk Ukrainian friend talk like that! 
---
&gt;There's currently a bug that causes your base to duplicate if you spawn into a server with your CAMP spot occupied, making it so you can place down items over your budget. 
---
Views and follows make them moist and no need to buy them drinks or a cab home.
---
Reeeeeeeeeee
---
Creation club is a very high possibility as it allowd modders to create the content and they can still remain profiting from the atom currency.
---
Will be a wierd thing to have to paid for mods. But i suppose it started up in FO4.
---
Could of been a test run.
---
I think it was just fixing it's butt, nothing more than that.
---
If you loot the stitched bear though, the stitches stay behind, so to speak.
---
Theres a small hollow in the north of the mire that always has 3+ honeybeasts and 5+ bloatflies. I tried putting my camp there a while back but they just spawned too frequently. 
---
Nah it actually happened bro, got the screenshot with the program they use. I see my IP address and location. 
---
Yeh its shitty. 
---
Good thing is just like in any game, skill takes you very far. Even with all this god stuff ive only come across a small handful where I had to sit up all of a sudden lol.
---
TSE have weaknesses. Just like alot of other god items.
---
Probably going to get downvoted by those constantly smashef by them, but there are some things you can do to lessen their impact. I can survive 2-3 shots from TSE currently. Only 2 weapons make it harder, but they too have shortcomings.
---
Probably notes, dates, and descriptions of 2 big patches
---
Yeah... It's super frustrating.  I have wasted so many caps on this shit
---
And they made calgar a primus.  Jayzus.  Fucking pretty marines.  ALWAYS ANGRY!  ALL THE TIME!
---
Congratulations. Now go play more Fortnite. We are not worthy of your greatness. We bow before your competence with the game.
---
Next.
---
It is odd, they can even "shoot" the sonic blast when not looking at you (which adds to spam)
---
scorchbeasts were rushed enemies IMO, not alotta thought went into the loot they drop nor the way the act in fight. i hope bethesda can rectify the loot and attack patterns
---
While I agree with your point can you really deny that he’s wrong. They need to be reworked so that the drop is worth the fight. I don’t mind spending half my ammo and stimpaks if I get a legendary weapon or armor piece that’s possibly better than what I have or is worth a lot of caps.
---
you could use the app with the game unpaused, so it shouldn't be a problem here
---
Yes I agree, patch the dupe exploits for server stability. No chance the “market” will truly recover without full wipe and yes a full wipe would be detrimental to the playerbase.
---
Releasing higher level gear or better gear is something I believe they intend to do anyways. Making level 50 gear completely obsolete will require a pretty large jump in difficulty and damage. Duped godroll max level items will still have value most likely. 
---
Your #3 punishes everyone except the pre-patch artillery dupers. Completely disagree. Your solution doesn’t solve the problem of the dupers with all of their duped items in their stash. It just punishes regular players using mules and the players who duped after the artillery was patched.
---
Wanna know a better solution that doesn’t punish regular players and promotes playing? Make caps worthless (even more so).
---
Increase cap gains. Say 100 caps per legendary mob, 250 caps per elite mob (scorch beasts, mirelurk queens, Grafton monsters etc) and 1500 for scorchbeast queen.
---
Introduce a new currency that makes the current “market” irrelevant (because it already is) that can only be spent/traded on new content. E.g. Sunset Sarsaparilla Star Caps or Vim! Caps. 
---
New vendors/vending machines that sell new content and only take the new currency.
---
New junk items that are needed to build/craft new content and can only be traded for with new currency.
---
I can go on longer but you should get the general idea. 
---
Basically to make all the vanilla content obsolete enough to where duped items are irrelevant. 
---
Have 90,000 steel? Well that’s not going to help you build this new badass PA set that requires titanium. Oh want to trade for titanium with caps? Too bad.
---
That would rule. I just want to continue to have something to work towards. I can't even believe TSE weapons dropped for anyone. 
---
Totally understand your point. I personally don't duper because I don't need to. I literally have every plan for houses, Every PA moded, Every TSE there is in multiple iterations. Every serum recipe. You name it, I got it. But honestly I dont blame people for doing it. If thats how you want to play. Give'r hell IMO.
---
We have no idea. Sales wise this game seems to have performed pretty poorly, so it’s entirely possible they may consider this venture into the online genre a failure and stop devoting resources to it entirely.
---
You already can with ghoulish perk
---
scorchbeasts are pretty good looking creatures, but they're annoying as all hell
---
You on pc? If soIll make you one brussy.
---
Depends on your system I have had to fully power cycle my Xbox and restart the game and it worked 
---
Give us a legendary weapon via quest or whatever that equates to Dragonrend for Scorchbeasts, give better loot, wash hands. There’s no point to a bullet sponge if the sponge doesn’t contain something worth blowing a stash box full of bullets on. 
---
Xbox
---
I remember hearing somewhere they tend to fly closer and closer to you even if you have not been detected. Better to run the opposite way than to sneak your way out of it.
---
Lets see the screenshot, just blur out your IP and Location. Coz Im finding this whole chain of events highly improbable. Some evidence will go along way to verifying your claim.
---
But if at all true, then your best bet will be to report to Sony (given this is on the PS4 platform) and let them deal with whoever they have to deal with.
---
What is them?  I can tell you if it's scrappable or already scrapped if I knew what it was 😀
---
Thinks hes gonna get record deal
---
Go lick a 9-Volt battery. 
---
Aim for the eyeballs
---
&gt; It must hurt knowing Bethesda doesn't give a fuck about you.
---
Must it?  Why? Should I be hurt that Rockstar doesn't give a fuck about me either?  Or any other large corporation?
---
You appear to be a teep as well as a precog.
---
&gt; You know what I mean by "dead." 
---
Actually, no I don't.
---
Apparently by "dead" you mean "not the biggest success in the history of games".  That is not a meaning of the word I'd ever considered.
---
He used an ip sniffer to get your ip and DDOS you. Along with his toxic messages, these are all reasons to report someone to PSN. In the future, don't join a toxic ass' party. It's either just an insult fest or they'll DDOS you. 
---
Sorry this happened, bud. 
---
Yeah, that's the one. They just spend hours at a time sitting there waiting for ghouls to respawn so they can try at a decent legendary weapon...
---
There is like a cultist site in one mine, were there are like 5 of those around a wall....pretty weird place because its not a mothman thing
---
The non-feral ghoul is a great idea, alotta people would appriciate being able to play as one for roleplay purposes (Nuka break cosplay anyone?). supermutant and robots (unless gen 1 synth or cyborg)? bad ideas, though... maybe a supermutant skin for power armor would be cool
---
He was probably saying that it is possible to have your hazmat suit on underneath PA..... but if that's the case, it's useless information because you can have any other non-PA piece equipped underneath your PA (but without the stats) anyway. It's like saying you can be naked underneath your PA. Duh?
---
Regardless of who started it or is at fault, it's a video game. No reason to hurl hate and DDOS someone. You must have triggered them goooood though, aha.
---
Wait to you accidently scrap your first one FML.
---
I’ve learned a lot tonight and hope this will be fixed and I appreciate your feedback. Thank you. 
---
This plus some weapons rebalance and fixing exploits and would make this game a 9/10 for me
---
Phantom of the Opera reference?
---
Sooo junkie trait is crap and need some loving from Beth.
---
I upvote this each time it's suggested.
---
Yeah man, lol, I’m not going to lie it got heavy. I’ve learned my lesson but they didn’t touch not one of us in PvP, lol. 
---
yeah I got that bit, but if the spot is occupied do I build in the same spot of move the camp and build there?  Not sure on how it works.
---
It is, but for people there its easy loot. I got 400 screws off of some guy who died of rads while loading in. Along with tons of springs, gears, and at least 5 bulk everything else
---
Its okay lol
---
That’s shitty. Cool. 
---
As I've only made 100 hops, 1% might as well mean 0-1%
---
and the new stuff is not time limited, yay!
---
Starting to think the eye bots are plotting!
---
Shitty for him huge gain for me I got all the stuff I needed to make my XO1 set at the time
---
Cool. 
---
They’re butler protectrons- they should be called buttrons.
---
Thanks for the nightmares
---
Instigating is top tier number 1 must have.
---
Dang. If you were pc i would have kitted you up.
---
Melee's were 10-shotting the SBQ well before duped tse were common. (12/16) was the first time i saw a god tier hammer-bro sky-walk and hulk smash the queen mid air... He was only level \~lvl70
---
The enemies are all boring/predictable, literally just trading shots. The mole rats/radscorpians don't dig the teleport. The **only** way they make enemies harder is just giving them more health/resistance, nothing interesting at all. 
---
Players so far like to face tank and feel powerful, I want a creature to change that mentality, along with the cheesy hiding inside/ontop a building and taking potshots.
---
Ahhh okay okay. Didnt know about that, thanks! Funny enough i get on fo76 today and there was turrets shooting there too. Feels bad.
---
Duping is 100% a problem and needs addressed, but I’m not convinced they’ve just “given up” on the game. It was holiday season in the States, our studio has been closed for three weeks. People are just now getting back in. If, say by February, nothing is done? Then yeah, time to panic or just play Anthem or wait for Division like everyone else.
---
Legit? Ive never thought to do that. Man I love the depth that is fallout. Thx if you are being sincere.
---
Why on earth would you have the Empath mutation as a melee build!?! Of course you're soft! Seriously though, you should ditch that dead weight.
---
As for your actual question, Marine Armor provides 15 rad resist if you install both the Welded plating and Lead-Lined mod. Nothing compared to a hazmat suit, but better than nothing? It is also possible to find legendary items with a "Rad Resistant" legendary affix or something like that, which provides 25 more rad resist and can be found on any type of armor pieces.
---
I also have noticed that, similar to in Fallout 4, the "BOS" combat armor plating mods \*CLAIM\* that they increase radiation resistance (in FO4 I think it was +25 rad resist, but lowered ballistic/energy resist). However, upon actually installing the BOS plating on 2 of my armor pieces, I do not see any increase in my rad resist whatsoever. Bugthesda strikes again! Either the tooltip is bugged, or the item itself is bugged. Probably the item.
---
You will ride eternal, shiny and chrome!
---
I speculate that they will continue to deliver a minimum viable product, meaning that they will keep supporting the game but with as little effort as needed to keep people playing. I feel that they half-assed the development so why would they suddenly start full-assing it after release.
---
My lever action (still) doesn’t reload right either, but they said it’s on their to-do list in their dev update.
---
&gt;yeah I got that bit, but if the spot is occupied do I build in the same spot
---
🤔
---
The Imperial Fists don't take kindly to that accusation...
---
Agreed while they dont bother me too much now cos my character is op, they are fucking annoying to kill when they dont land. 
---
Consider yourself lucky you got a prime plan ive killed at least 50-100 of the thing as ive gotten a couple level 50 western revolvers.... like fuck that they should drop a one star legendary by default
---
Imagine logging off without rad protection in whitespring.
---
Look after yourselves out there, I’ll get us home safe.
---
Yeah, it was Sony's fault. 
---
Beth had been rearing to go on it then Sony changed their minds. And when Sony finally came around, which took awhile, they placed severe limitations on what the mods could be.
---
No non-native sound, textures, models or scripts (FOSE scripts, just custom that could be written in the CK). Mods were reduced to numbers and other subtle tweaks. Which is far better than nothing but it was a far cry from what Xbox got.
---
I see 26minutes of event, phew. Come back with 29mins left kill.
---
Anyway Good JoB we need to kill those bastards until bethesda delete them and make some new lore.
---
Omfg... So that's the reason why I lost my mods. I am so pissed right now at losing my damn X-01 Stealth Boy and Jet Pack mods, why the hell did they make it like this. -.-
---
You mean DPS Moira is not the only way to play her?
---
rly? it is kinda useles for SBQ, maybe anti-armor would be better.
---
Yet to go get me that one. In fact now that you say it in the almost 200 hrs I've been playing ive never went into the nuka plant. Must fix that later 
---
Don't believe we currently have fast travel mats as an option. We have normal mats but they do not have the spawn location ability like in FO4.
---
Yea they are a small indie company. Not like we had to buy the game
---
They also got my account banned for a week. I was the only one though. Man, I just can’t win, lol. 
---
I saw a brick house yesterday sitting farther back on the right side beyond the doors without any turrets.   It looked so nice, I thought it was actually supposed to be there.  Until I got to the entrance of the place and noticed a single platform with stairs going up.   Back and sides had brick extending down into hillside.  No turrets.
---
You must not have s SSD because while farming the JetPack in Whitesprings i had plenty of time to pop some RadAways before dying while spawning in a Nuke Zone.
---
Not meant for the queen could go the bloody route for her. Could wrack that damage right up just would be careful of playing too risky but the damage goes right up.
---
I prefer my TSE shotgun or rifle for her and my melee / Telsa for Whitesprings.
---
It’s a mercyless  life as a tiny Guardsman.
---
My two buddies and myself are playing this game since day 1 as Astartes. Brings a little bit more impact in this thin plot. Not as Smurf’s, more as two Deathguards in black Power Armor with Bolters and Chainsworfs, and a Scout Marine with suppressed (handmade) rifle and Stealth-Ability (Chameleon). 
---
Thinks for this great story. Horus‘ Heresy is everywhere!
---
Purge, Cleanse, Burn!
---
Great spot. Lead extractor *and* a junk extractor? Sign me up!
---
If you have the drop-grenade thing, you can just run up and die to the turrets in middle of base.. It will drop the orbital strike.  Your 10 cap bounty goes away. (I think).   This is what someone posted about on here.
---
Suicide Bombers.
---
Hi, I’m Alpharius
---
Yeah I'm in Australia so I won't be on for a few more hours. I'll add you when I'm on. If you see me on, just message me and I'll help out however I can
---
Not sure what a SSD is. On PS4. I wasn’t even farming either, I bought a gun from someone then left server to rejoin &amp; bam. Good thing I wasn’t buying flux this time. 
---
Sentences are not suppose to start with "And". 
---
\-Funny how you criticize others grammar so intensely, yet in many posts it's so poor.
---
This is often a tactic people use when they don't have legitimate means of criticism.
---
They left it out because it would be too powerful I bet
---
Says the guy that posted a twice as long rant about griefers.
---
I mean, it does...but most of the time it isn't scaled properly. I do love level 15 legendaries at level 180 though. 
---
I'm online now, psn smeg_n_ell. I have 2k .308 &amp; 870x 556
---
Just have to get close to them. I kill myself with mine all the time.
---
It's only a failure if they don't fix it. They have the talent. They have the potential. If they fail it's because they chose to.
---
Yes,but when you first log in it is advisable to just open your stash at least once because it doesn't always link up straight away.
---
Ah sorry, forgot people play MMO's on consoles.
---
Yeah, so basically my floor is missing for me, but not for anyone else.
---
Same with other peoples floors. There's are always missing, and I can't seem to walk into someones camp  at all.
---
This is happening on all servers, not just one.
---
I was testing with a friend, ATOM purchased floors are missing for me. 
---
If someone has regular woof floors in their camp, I am able to talk on the floor and use their items. 
---
But if they have an Atom skinned floor, I cannot.
---
That, and/or decrease prices of items in the shop!!! For fucks sake I love this game but I ain’t gonna spend 800 Atoms on something that was in fallout fucking four 
---
Okay cool, thanks! I'm trying to get my stupid excavator armor done but don't have the power armor station plan in my camp so it's been a pain
---
I would spend real money and atoms on cool looking clothes, custom paints for my weapons/armor, cool/useful camp items, and a respec on my perk card choices. 
---
I only use the wheel when I desperately need a stimpack but apparently choose to die instead (pc)...
---
[How about a little picnic instead?](https://imgur.com/a/M8rOuxe)
---
Somebody else posted that a few can be completed but have to be in 1 session.
---
Not excavator though :(
---
Thats nice
---
Absolutely this. 
---
More polygons. Morrowind can be run at high resolutions.
---
Sure message me on Xbox gt themisterphenix
---
Yep, the atomic shop ones are designated as HEADWEAR but the rest aren't. Hopefully they fix it in the next patch. It's not exactly a huge issue, but it's an easy fix. 
---
Whys that
---
In Australia we call those "Bin Chickens" more commonly known outside of Australia as the Ibis.
---
Not really it is 50-100 daily + 100-200 weekly. You can do daily challenges in 30minutes. And they are realative funny. Taking naked photo at vault with group was absolutly great! What is wrong is some prices of items on atomic shop. And that some of them are not even fully working, like that leather vaul-tec paint, that is not working on heavy arms.
---
Agreed.
---
I just claim em and defend for the plans then be on my way.
---
No point in waisting materials on defenses. 
---
You may have has a fast travel mat that carried over from BETA. If you lose that one you can't place another in your CAMP because that object is not available at CAMP, but only at workshops.
---
Have they fixed this game yet?
---
Damage vs or less received from scorched will be best if you are looking for Sb SQB situations. Since they always spawn scorched with them and in the nuke zone pretty much everything is scorched.
---
They dish out atoms though so I don't feel too bad about it. 1000 for a gun skin is crap but 400 is more reasonable with the free atoms a player accrues I think
---
I have not had turrets at my CAMP for about 3 weeks.  The most that has happened was lost a defense fence around my garden.  That's it.  
---
There is really no need at all for turrets, wild animals/creatures wont demolish your base.   They break 1 or 2 things and go away.  1 wood is much cheaper than building the cheapest turret and allows you to build a much better camp.
---
if a deathclaw or SB attacks you, your turrets wont stop those anyway.
---
Melee also works, none can deny the power of the mighty Death Tambo.
---
Your junk collection is all in one MOST OF THE TIME. Certain interior benches fail to work correctly
---
This sub is comedy gold. 
---
PSA: don’t turn the Marker off in the first Place since it’s activated by default... c‘mon
---
This has been happening to me too. And it's not because I choose a perk category to allocate my special in the wrong place. The first slot I go to is Strength. Then I browse all the cards in the category, move to the next with R1 and browse some more categories. Then I go to strength and choose pack rat, or strong back or something. And it sends my special point to Endurance instead of Strength. It's not me going to the wrong special tab as described in your comment, because I go to strength first. I already have a general idea of what I want before I go in, so I make sure to click that tab first. 
---
Why excavator armour in particular?
---
Longest we held a server as almost 6 days, we had a rotation of 7-8 people, with one dude not sleeping for five of those days to catch up to the guys that were in the beta. We all at some point froze, no-damage glitched, or got disconnected but had at least two anchors on at all times.   Back then the game plan was hold the munitions factory, and power plants, transfer the excess supplies/legendaries to mules and farm hard.
---
I'm sure I still have a photo of our band\* all of use playing instruments hanging out at camp. It's a shame what the game is turning into.
---
200 per day huh? I too love getting $56 to $60 dollars worth of atom per month!
---
when you run mainly a close up build, and have zero explosive weapons, they’re not only annoying, but impossible to kill. The second one sees me I switch servers. Fuck Scorchbeasts 
---
I’ll have to ask the girl I know in the AU
---
Cocaine and loooooong sessions with Mr. Fisto.
---
What else?
---
There is a way to farm mutations, I think it was ESO who put up a bid on it
---
You can only get one per server, best location is the was disposal with a hazmat shower
---
- fissure sure prime: violet flux
---
- Whitespring: all other flux
---
Took my one hour and two Nuke sites to get all ingredients for some mods + Decon shower. What exactly is so difficult?
---
They can fix things but idk if they will be financially inclined to do so
---
Anything you build in a workshop that comes up with a material list in green does not use your personal resources. Each workshop has it's own pool. I can usually build a stash, 2 or 3 work benches and about 5 turrets before I run out of provided resources.
---
Either that or Steve Urkell
---
From all those negative stats and amount of drugs needed to take only for 10+ damage bonus seems kinda bad when explosive, two shot, bloodied, berserker seem to do way more damage. Thought junkie would be around their damage levels with the amount of negative effects. Thanks for the research though.
---
Platform? I'm PC IGN: jchamlin
---
I disagree. The game is already too easy and the Sierra Bravos are at least a little bit of a challenge. Not much though, if you are properly equipped, you can shoot them from the skies easily enough. Their AOE sonic grenades or whatever you wish to call them are primarily a bother if you stay stationary. If you are mobile enough, you can outrun them if you are a non-VATS build and if you are a VATS build you can see through all the glare effects anyway.  
---
If you aren't a melee or a hybrid build with vanilla range weapons, then you should be able to tackle them. If you're not, then perhaps you should rethink your build and not demand that the game is changed to your personal preference.
---
I'm aware.
---
What level are u?
---
If you are experiencing low dmg with non TSE shotgun try using it with. Even without focused fire it seems to connect better for some reason. I play 1st person and am aiming perfectly on. Close, mid range always random dmg like it whiffs until I use vats. It's honestly day and night and bothers me.
---
Thats just luck, maybe the server you were on didn't have anyone duping causing instability, or nukes.
---
I sat on a pond and got parasites...
---
Robots don’t forget and robot don’t forgive. You have to switch servers.
---
im so glad i searched up the xo1 jetpack when i saw it in the vendor. i stg my first time even being in that wing, i went over to the vendor and the jetpack was there, 546 caps. im so sorry to you all that have had to grind for this, i feel so bad that i got this shit first time without even trying or knowing how awesome it is. gg rng
---
Why do they need to do that when people are going to hype and buy their games anyway? A year or 2 from now when ES6 is released, people would undoubtedly have forgotten the disaster that is fallout 76.
---
I had a similar glitch with Chameleon armor where if I died while it wasn't equipped then after I respawned it'd start giving me the effect as if it was equipped.  
---
Sorry just trying to help
---
Ok nb 
---
I have just explosive, wondering how it works in general
---
It is not failure, it is just crazy start, now everybody knows there is this game. "marketing"
---
Yo  make sure to hop servers 2 after u get a mutation and just bring lots of dirty water and spam that 2
---
It's kinda amazing...I've gotten motion assist for every set of armor... 2-3 times. Bloody knuckles for excavator. And that's about it. Overdrive for something.

Its true but because of them Bethesda nerfed legendary spawn rates and drops, like 3 star dropping 1 star items, when in AWOL event it use to be guarantee or high chance of 3 star weapon/armor. So, Bethesda instead of fixing the problem nerfed legit ways for players to get legendaries and chance at god roll.
---
Rubber is needed for making Combat Armor.  Just make a crap ton of legs/arms and destroy those for mods.  Guarantee you should run out quite fast.
---
Dude, this wasn’t entertaining the first 345675 times I read it.
---
I’ve a camp which literally serves just to get rid of those camps, 8 artillery pieces surrounded by concrete sedative walls with a couple turrets and crafting stations
---
Huh?
---
Make/Scrap some leather armors for mods.   Unless you have all the mods, then that is good way to get rid of the cloth/leather.
---
Forgot to mention, the Machete was Lvl 50 and I removed all my dmg perk cards for this experiment. 
---
I wonder if this'll work with those legendary armors with weight reducing effects.
---
I really do not think that is needed actually.
---
I store all, then just go make bulked junk and make bulk out of anything beyond my set limits.   It removes those excess from the stash and puts all the bulked  in your inventory.  No issues.
---
Interestingly, it appears there may have been, or are planning on having, multiple currencies, they have a CNCY (Currency) asset in the data files which is only Caps so far (so this does not include the premium currency Atoms)
---
Same, I'm lvl 185 and never got TSE weapon to drop had to buy mine, probably duped too. For long time I had shit legendary weapons and around lvl 130 I was using a lvl 35 junkie explosive double barrel shotgun just because it did 235 damage and mostly one shotted or few reloads killed enemies. Makes me think one person got the god roll and duped it to the point all the TSE originated from one drop lol.
---
My stealth is so high (all the sneak perks, plus shrouded wooden and shadowed leather armor, plus Chameleon) that they can never find me when they’re in the air. They just flap around looking curious and I get CAUTION but they never aggro unless I engage them. 
---
Wasen't the game about rebuilding America? 
---
It is a failure. 80% less sales then fallout 4 on launch and it also destroyed a good part of their image.
---
Because it could be a gold mine. There are so many examples of systems done well in MMOs that they could use. Things need to move fast in online games or people get bored and quit, especially when end game content is limited. Whitespring and SBQ and server hopping for mods and plans doesn't cut it as end game content. The Atom Shop isn't that interesting. They should be releasing new things all the time. They should be making radical changes to get people excited and having fun. New events. New boss mobs that drop new legendaries. They could add a new legendary effect as simply as typing a line of code and put it in a loot table for a new Super Mutant Behemoth that spawns randomly in the world as an Event. 
---
So many events are not interesting. They should make more and make them more rewarding and epic. Workshops should be a lot more rewarding. On my map most of the time most of them sit empty. And I tried to take the Tyler County Dirt Track and server hopped twice today and couldn't. It kept saying can't take when enemies are in the area but there were none. There also wasn't the quest pop up clear the enemies so no markers to even show if they were under ground or anything. These bugs are game breaking along with others that are just annoying. These are the things that will drive people away from the game and give up on it. 
---
We shouldn't be worried about them giving up on the game, they should be worried about the players giving up on the game and giving up on them. I've personally already given up on a number of AAA publishers. I don't want to give up on the one company that seems to be doing everything right, has made some of my favorite games, but seem totally incompetent in their effort to make it truly great. There's some problem somewhere and it's probably in some suit/management position.
---
Hey OP the quickest way to get all 18.
---
In the Savage Divide region of Appalachia you will find a nuclear waste storage facility -- Emmett Mountain Disposal Site. Inside the building you will find thousands of barrels of nuclear waste that spew rads with such intensity that you will be able to get any mutation you will ever need.
---
Inside the building on the left hand side is a rad shower as well. Go there, rad up get a mutation then starch genes on and take a shower. Then leave the server and rejoin a server to start again repeat 18 times.
---
Would you log in and et them all though?  That's what Bethesda should be looking at. Building the game,  providing content. They could easily just saturate the store. At least we would be getting something ....
---
Most dupers aren't doing it for caps, they're trading duped items for real money, so this doesn't fix that.
---
I believe the sensor mod for the PA highlights enemies.   I got one for my X01 but have not used it yet.
---
Finally a use for that camp destroyer card hehe
---
What are you looking for 
---
AD VICTORIAM!!
---
Yeah but sometimes its hard to know if its duped, I mean I assume all TSE are duped, or the player is legit bought it from a duper and wants to get rid of it because of the ethical situation.
---
I still believe old man that it’s fuck fuck fuckit.
---
On Xbox One too, it’s visually out of place.
---
So why not pay with 50k Nula-Cola bottles? 50k caps...
---
This whole situation sucks. 
---
His name is Roachie. It’s a reference to the Fallout 4 Monster Factory episodes produced by Polygon/The McElroy Brothers. There are several other references in that same house too, including the dead Mr. Handy, the stuff in the crib, and the blocks that spell out “PAM”. 
---
It’ll stay in your camp till you move your entire camp. At that point it’ll be in your stored tab &amp; can’t be places till you get the plans. 
---
There's a point there for sure. 
---
It kinda makes being in passive mode necessary especially when you queen raid or greenbriar nuke farm.
---
...
---
So... that is why i force them to land with like 10 shotgunshells and then melt their health with my Meathook legendary doing 300 per swing and has 40% faster swingspeed healing me each time?
---
(Use Enforcer. 30% chance to cripple a limb. When you cripple their wings, they are forced to land. And they are slow as hell then. Making them just more of a flying steak for me as a carnivore)
---
I mean I honestly don't even care if it's a blueprint. I just want the actual devices stored, the turrets stored, etc. 
---
I don't know if I'm financially inclined to buy any more of their games then. Seems like shooting themselves in the foot.
---
Nope, but there's no reason coke didn't exist in the fallout universe.
---
If I'm not wrong the lore mentions that a rival company sued nuka-cola for using their bottle design which made nuka-cola switch to the missile bottle that ended up being more popular...
---
I don't think it mentions it but I've always thought the rival company was coca cola
---
Oooh thanks, did you find out for yourself? Plus, that means it doesn't completely disappear right?
---
That whole mothman weirdo holotape trail is all about how mothman is chump level shit and the Lovecraft plant shit was where its at.
---
All hail the timeless one
---
oh my god, you are here from r/fallout arent you? This was only psychical copy and it was less percentages. But good job down voting me lol. Only thing which destroyed their image is this fucking hatetrain and stupid youtubers. Lots of people spend over 300hours in this game already. Thats way more, than in other games. But yeah lets go praise RDR2.
---
Stack bobbleheads infinitely. 
---
I’m RPing as a raider is code for I’m RPing as a w@nker. 
---
They could fix this easy, if they can't fix the stability, one let people be able to rejoin a server they claimed a workshop when they disconnect, two let their claim workshop still be claimed kinda like how you go on a server and your camp is in the same location, three if someone else claimed that workshop during your disconnect and lets say you claimed the workshop and less then 5 minutes you disconnect you get refunded your caps when you rejoin since someone else claimed it.
---
Missed it but I'll be interested in future nuke launches
---
Was this not patched last week?
---
I wish we could fast travel to them with caps like regular icon since going to nearby icon and walking can be tedious.
---
You do realise that they could just not offer dailly challenges (or any challenges) as they dont provide any advantages and are just cosmetic.
---
Found it out myself &amp; from seeing other threads over time.       
---
It’ll always stay placed in your camp even after server hopping. You can even move it around.      
---
After you move your camp it won’t be completely gone, just stays in the stored tab. you can still scrap it or save it till you get the plan. 
---
Thats why I store my outfits, its more like you auto pilot sell or scrap it xD.
---
Other people or just you?
---
After sneaking into a camp of Super Mutants to steal something as part of Rose's quests, the Prize Bot showed up just as I was creeping up on the target loot chest. That thing has the worst timing.
---
Scorchbeast will ignore your camp when you aren't there unless you have turrets. I rarely use turrets for that reason.
---
Your asking a question we cannot answer bud. But guessing i would say they will likely have more time with QA team to remove as many as possible. But Betheada games are very well known for bugs.
---
Also while 76 had a rough launch. The game is pretty amazing and far from failure. They do how ever need to iron out alot of issues.
---
I would remind you of ESO from when it started compared to now. Its start was very very rough on us. It did not look like it even had a long future. But compare it to today its thriving and over the years has gotten alot of work done to it.
---
PC, I think I have you added from yesterday screenshots?
---
The number of times I've been running away/chasing something and suddenly  face to face with a ditch wall....
---
And people complain about glitches...
---
lol
---
Chaotic Neutral?
---
Yeah had a random scorchbeast appear yesterday it was pretty fun to kill it with a pistol
---
I'm literally doing this right now.
---
Fast travel to monaghan power station right next to Blackwater mine. Upon spawning in go up the path slightly then go left and climb a bit.
---
Drop into the roof of the main Blackwater mine entrance building.
---
In that building is a stack of barrels that you rad up on.  
---
Inside the mine to the immediate right (second door) is a decontamination shower.
---
Get mutation &gt; equip genes or not &gt; shower &gt; server hop &gt; repeat.
---
If you server hop in the mine it'll spawn you at the power station again
---
Checking the terminals, some raiders came in and mopped things up/camped out. Think they'd either heard it was a ghoul hideaway or knew about the phantom organ or something? Anyway, got the impression that the ghouls are using it to scare others away.
---
Small part of me is hoping that there's a sentient ghoul coven down below that just said fuck that scorch beast noise and hunkered down. Plenty of hints that people may start coming back with the scorch plague under control, whose to say a group doesn't pop their heads up? (Yes, I know the fate of that one group of ghouls. I'm hoping any ghouls at the church stuck around. Ghosts playing non-existent organs just doesn't make sense).
---
Its been a while since their last patch isnt it? And i mean,  it wasnt even that big of a patch. Idk how is bethesda managing their team vacations. 
---
If you’re able to make them (and the material cost is really cheap), they sell for about 28 caps to vendors with hard bargain 3 equipped. 
---
The diner door (yellow one with oval hole) never makes a sound for me
---
So all alcohol stacks? Seems like an overshadow when you can only take one chem. Party boy/girl giving 3 (or 6 for whiskey) strength each for a ton of alcohol types is insane
---
Please click the first blue “image” to see this Camp!
---
Then the game would just be worse. What's the point in that. 
---
I think they said the next one is big one and should add content so I excepted it to take a bit hopefully it comes out soon though cause 5% is alot of build limit
---
For the people struggling with repairs, pick up White Knight and Lucky Break and you don't have to repair your armor ever again.
---
Wow that's amazing.
---
I wonder who made the design choice for three of them to spawn on top of me at Pleasant Valley Train Station. 
---
Hold up luck of the draw uses your materials?!
---
We even have a song about it. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO-OpFjHRbE&amp;t=7s
---
Awesome I'll give this a go 
---
*Suddenly, shanty village is erected at Whitesprings fenceline.
---
Claim but don't spend your own resources after.   
---
The area indicator around the building only indicates where to get the clown costume.
---
&gt;Most duper’s aren’t doing it for caps.
---
Never said they were.
---
&gt;they’re trading duped items for real money, so this doesn’t fix that.
---
Never said trading game items for real life currency would be solved. That’s in any game with a market or trading and pretty much unsolvable.
---
The post is talking about the in game currencies  economy and market. Not 3rd party selling for real life currency.
---
Vanilla items would become obsolete with the new content coming out. Depending on what they intend to do e.g. increasing item level, adding in new legendary prefixes etc. Especially if they are only trade-able for caps which would be worthless.
---
Yes. I see you in game now.
---
Good luck finding them without quest markers.
---
You just need to have the world event to pop up, keeping an eye on the map. My 120 rad-shields agree :P
---
Courage, cunning, and compassion are the hallmark virtues of the Order of Mysteries!  The Sisters are always watching over you!
---
I think they need to remove the explosive legendary and rebalance the rest of the legendary drops.  Stop making almost every single legendary, except for two shot explosive absolute crap.  I really don’t want to kill      A scorch beast queen and get a mutant Slayers lead pipe.  Make the legendaries more interesting so there isn’t just one viable legendary weapon.
---
Ill add you. Gonna launch in a min. Next time sounds good.
---
I can't afford a TSE weapon at the moment on my shotgun build, so I've improvised by creating a specialised anti-Scorched Combat Shotgun: I make use of the Furious legendary ability to absolutely melt Scorchbeasts. I equipped it with a Scorch Killer's receiver and a Perforating Magazine for extra armour penetration, so as soon as a Scorchbeast lands I can kill it in about 15-16 shots. I can comfortably chip away at an SBQ once it lands. Like you say, many non-TSE weapons are still viable against Scorchbeasts, but TSE *does* rule over the roost at the moment.
---
Excavator paint, it’s all i want. I never leave my Excavator PA so a paint for that i would love, or just make the PA paint be damn universal and can be applied to any PA.
---
First this is not a ban thing he is using in game items to their full and yes pvp is broken bud. Remove his name as your post will be deleted for witch hunting.
---
He is using a TSE weapon paired with player damaged reduce armor set and in a group with the perk to increase his mutant powers.
---
Not sure, I haven't really tried. Just saw a thread on reddit not too long ago. 
---
Doesn't it use plastic too? I always use all mine bulking lol
---
Range especially isn't a problem with explosive and skeet shot
---
I was confused about this too. As an Xbox player I knew, this would only come to PC (even that these games are obtainable for some CENTS nowadays. 
---
But I was at least expecting some sort of email which invites me to install the launcher gifting us the games. The lack of any info was strange but it’s unlocked there, true. 
---
his mutant powers shouldnt be able to let him jump to the top of a building in watgoa buddy. its not witch hunting when its the truth and i watched him with my own two eyes. when you can be wanted and we light him up with tse weapons and he literally takes 0 damage and kills us with 1 shot thats not using game aspects, thats cheating. 
---
Witchhunting, this may get you banned here on reddit lol. And send us video so we know not one of your teammates didnt have bounty, taken workshop, didnt shoot him,...     i can fly in air as i want if im in group with my mutations, that is not hack
---
I already did that in my low levels. It's not even worth doing for the exp anymore, quicker to just chuck it.
---
Sounds like someone's used to being on the government teat...  
---
Yes I know people are selling them for 500 csps
---
Why do you hate on how people choose to play the game?:P  
---
Also, with the right gear, like sentinel, you can actually get really hard to kill with extreme damage reduction..   
---
But anyway, if you are concerned with people killing stuff before you can, just get a tesla rifle and tag everything asap... Or molotov cocktails..
---
That works if you intentionally quit in Whitesprings. On multiple occasions I've lagged out when playing solo and spawn into a new server and die before I can move due to radiation
---
Loads of plastic, yes.  I'm always running out of plastic, but trying to get all the combat armor mods as well.   But they use a ton of rubber.
---
The scorchbeasts pretty much are reskinned/remade dragons from Skyrim. They have nearly the same flying animations too. 
---
Honestly... maybe that was the point. Just help take resources OUT of the game. 
---
That's what inquisition would say.
---
should add that it's a failure compared to Bethesda games but compared to none Bethesda games it's not that big of a failure.
---
The school in watoga has lots of plastic cutlery too.
---
lll delete his name but not the post
---
I had three “discover my CAMP after I fast travelled there to dump some loot and re arm and repair. That was really really fun. Oh wait, no it wasn’t 
---
Explore the forest more.
---
Do events, capture workshops.
---
The story doesn't really have a level range i place. Enemies scale to the level of whoever was near there.
---
What you're seeing is a high traffic area so the enemies spawn that level.
---
Most of the forest is capped
---
I need to go there more often!
---
yea its called stagger, someone would have at it it can glich her heal out to
---
which is exactly why they are a thing. LOL
---
Again yes it can lol.
---
Yes it is witch hunting i am only warning you so you don't get in trouble with the mods here your choice though.
---
Your weapons won't do much to 90% reduced player damage with the right perk setup. Unless your wearing the set as well you will be popped in one hit.
---
Trust me i hunt griefers alot and these lads are just block and move server. Both pvp and balance in general needs a good abit of love.
---
How dare you question the overlords over at r/Fallout??!!?
---
I think there is one, it was stored somewhere weird but I'm pretty sure I've seen it 
---
I actually get emails from coworker telling me they are about to send me an email...
---
hard to take video when you are being continuosly killed without initiating pvp by a wanted player who took ZERO damage from 2 people using tse heavy weapons
---
Ah it killed me. It's okay I will go get my junk and finally when it lands my melee build can fight it... oh no game crashed. Junk is gone. 
---
Guess I will go play Spider-Man. 
---
Yet another post of the exact same shitty topic.
---
I think they do, that may save those on something bigger, like dlc or expansion..
---
No, lol.
---
E3 pretty much, Todd confirmed the game will always be in development and eill progress overtime. The onle ones struggling to comprehend this are the ones who saw “Fallout” as a word and immediately associated it with a Single Player Fallout 5 game, which i’m sorry but it’s THEIR mistake to make.
---
Ahhh, thank you so much!
---
I'm in serious need of the thing everyone calls "friends" so if yall ever want another person to wander around with lemme know! My ign is the same as my Reddit.
---
I said from full health to death in less than a minute, not a 1 minute fight. The event doesnt even start at a full 30 mins. Come back when you can read fellow vaultboy
---
Lol Tod Howard doesn't give a fuck. He robbed all of you
---
Ive seen better resource sinks. Scorchbeast is not one of them.
---
&gt; it could be hilarious but thats also getting too close to the just cause franchise. 
---
When bethesda decided that players should be able to throw abombs at each other, they pretty much already killed anything falout built up during the last 20years.
---
Might aswell fully embrace the "fun multiplayer loot and shoot sandbox". In the end that's what a sandbox is all about, amazing tools to have fun with.
---
Depends on your playstyle.  I’d aim to have your build’s weapon damage perks at a minimum.
---
l2p...
---
1. get x01
---
2. get gaus gun
---
3. learn to aim
---
4. stay in a sonic spamm
---
5. get no damage (i use may x01 to farm whitesping and to kill scorched queen about a month ago and onyl 2-3mm missing from the hp of the armor. never reapired )
---
6. waste 20-30amo to kill it
---
7. do not get any loot
---
8. profit?????
---
&gt; should add content 
---
I am so ready for this, but also worried at the same time. Will it break more stuff and is the patch really fixing older bugs?
---
He probably hasn’t fought a queen before, don’t sweat about it hah
---
Very nice!
---
I've only been around for two victories over the stupid things. One was using a surface-to-air missile turret that I had to repair several times. The other was mostly the work of every robot at Whitespring.
---
I really like it. Props for creativity
---
Dude I feel you. I'm ready for more to do cause I've run out of stuff to do besides repeateadly killing the queen but I'm so worried that this will bring a whole new batch of issues
---
Oh cool... I'm still missing a few recipes I think, mainly granny's tea. I'll keep my eyes out for that thread. 
---
Works perfectly thank you !
---
I have a camp like this, fyi the foundation that you build from needs to be slightly off the cliff to be able to build stairs going down. To me it seems like the front two foundation pieces need to be about halfway out of the cliff before it will let you build stairs
---
&gt;our hard earned loot
---
Might wanna check who is the commie in this situation comrade.
---
about 20 shoot need to kill a lvl50 with two shot (non exp, becuase i never seen any explosive drop and i will not pay for the dupers) gaus. 27pcs 2mm amo is about 5 lead to craft... so cheap nd easy to kill.. but still just waste of time.
---
Killing mobs is usually a better source of xp than Quests. I would reccomend fighting over questing. At least until you get to a decent level
---
Hah. I was fighting a scorchbeast in the nuke zone, easy, waiting for it to land. The two col. Gutsy run along and kill me.
---
And welcome to the central conceit of how Bethesda sucker you into spending money in the Atom Store. Heavily front load free atoms to get you in the habit of spending. Screw you on the recurring atoms (daily/weekly) to coerce you into spending money when it's annoying to grind so long for those atoms.
---
It's why I only spend my atoms of cheap stuff I'm going to use. There will ALWAYS be more items to purchase in the Atom store.
---
Adrenalin perk will also push it by quite alot and dont forget about the adrenalin reaction mutation, which also pushes things quite far.
---
I am not from r/fallout.
---
Is there a way to cripple with a ranged weapon without perk investment? Melee here and I really don't want to sacrifice something for that inconsistent perk card. :/
---
Hehe..now just work on your t-posing
---
Yes but after that, how will they justify supporting the game? No monthly fee, dlc is free. HQ will shut 76 down if it's costing them money more money than it brings.
---
I got that one. I think he was in the power sub station by Watoga. 
---
No prob mate
---
Yea it's normal lol
---
Honestly it shouldnt have a circle until after it drops. They hyped up being able to nuke other players but give a 2 minute warning? 
---
It works in PA, his data even states so, not sure why he would comment saying otherwise.
---
yep. but most prime conversion is worst than the regular hardend. and the amo is way more expensive.
---
Lmao. 2000 atom priced emote.
---
Ah, forgot about adrenaline. And I do have adrenal, forgot that added damage.
---
Well I can play and enjoy the game without playing dress up or buying camp items to make my house looks like a mansion. But if you like that kind of playstyles, you will need either to grind or pay for the cosmetics. With the current reward system, you can get over 1000 atoms per month if you play daily. And the shop has been improved regarding to prices with the last few additions.
---
Use bash and release trigger during animation
---
Hard to say. My alt is level 40 and i just use a melee weapon i found but my build is zero melee.
---
I run whatever let's me hold my own till 50 and that is PA + melee on a non-pa/melee build lol
---
My tse pump action seems to Bug out on scorched beasts And deals no dmg
---
Not here. Try a sticky note on your wall
---
I haven’t bought a single plan/recipe because of this issue.
---
I’m guessing most will come as dlc or add ons. For the T51b Optimized bracers, I agree, do not believe they’re in the game. Server hopped for over 30 hours, never found one.
---
Thats an overly complicated way of saying "wipe everyones gear and caps because im butthurt"
---
he doesnt have any of those unfortunately.
---
Can confirm it doesn't work, at least spamming the few I had left with curator on. No increase beyond the initial. Relogging and taking my last one did nothing either. Guessing either fake, or there's more to the glitch.
---
Astro a10 for consoles are like 40 bucks
---
Hold your reload button (r by default) until you lower the weapon.
---
Oh I don’t care what my neighbor Joe Schmoe has on his Fallout 76 account. Just an idea for the marketplace to not be a joke.
---
Would love to get the plans for Utracite Explosive Shielding but unfortunately it's not available.
---
I think that the gilded minigun also has the name "strikebreaker" on it.
---
Tinker's and raw yellow cake flux, fiber optics and steel i believe.
---
Sorry new ish to fallout 76, what’s the problem here? I ask only because I don’t want my stuff destroyed! Thanks in advance
---
I’d buy a working fridge so my fruit and veggies last longer. 
---
I've been playing too much warframe again. I was immediately thinking I should check the plat price on those
---
Yeah (Considering the token cost and how many you get for the daily quest, only dupers or people buying tokens can get enough tokens to buy it)
---
Just got my full T51b PA and i m looking for mods. What s your routine looking for those ?
---
I actually think they're a very challenging and engaging enemy to fight. A great end game boss.
---
But their loot is worse than shit, making the challenging fight a grind that isn't ever worth it. Avoid them at all cost.
---
I don't care how many time people post literally this exact same thing. I will always upvote it. 
---
Vendor not Phoenix in the Watoga shopping plaza carries most plans. Though some are very very rare
---
I once tried to take down a scorchbeast and it spammed me for like 15 seconda which i thought was pretty unfair but ok. Then it just flew around a little and returned and i shit you not it spammed at me for a solid minute and a half while i was running and drinking quantum after quantum and injecting stimpak after stimpak
---
Also use Contractor perk to reduce the cost of stuff. That helps a lot.
---
I got a clean ranger outfit from the wandering Charleston vendor. Marine tactical under armor and helmet are also pretty hard to get. (I know of only 4 locations that plans can spawn, but give a random marine related plan)
---
Hadedas in Seffrica bru
---
its more than likely glitched, i know that both of the overseer's quests were glitched and that the glitch was patched out, but your version may still have the glitch as a byproduct of the update not taking full effect or something
---
Yes! Exactly! I was just about to say the same thing. Big, screaming, nuke-shooting cliff racers.
---
Brilliant! Nice composition too!
---
&gt; (I can go on and on about my ideas on how to create a healthier end game. I imagine dungeons just like ESO, where the difficulty depends on the level of your team, and at those high levels, team play isn’t just recommended, it is impossible to go solo.)
---
This only works to a point, because you stop getting stronger past a point. I'm no stronger now than I was 400+ levels ago. I don't want to be in a situation where I can't find people to do group content with because the vast majority of people are so much lower level.
---
I think there still needs to be a cap on the scaling or we'll end up with the same problem the scaling in FO4 had at high levels. It's also worth considering that say for example I spawn a level 500, even if I have the level 500 Weapons/Armor to deal with, the lower levels around me might not be in that same position.
---
&gt; Priority #3:Nerf the power of a “mule.” Ok bear with me while I explain: for the purpose of explanation, say your carry weight is 100, at 200 (double your carry weight) you are no longer able to walk, at 400 (quadruple your carry weight) you are no longer able to trade, pick up, or functionally do anything besides drop items.
---
If I couldn't continue to store an unlimited amount of stuff on my mules I wouldn't even want to play anymore. Nothing that drops is going to be better than what I already have and with a cap to my mules I wouldn't be able to store anymore stuff. I've got at least a max rank of every perk, without the storage there wouldn't be anything to gain from even playing.
---
I'm all for Bethesda doing something about illegitimately sourced mules inventories, but I'm well over 100k weight on my primary mule completely legitimately and I would object to no longer being able to store anything (to the point that I would get my EU guaranteed full refund for all of my accounts and move on). Even if I still had the occasional 2/3 Star to loot, I'm well over 100k without any of the Weapons/Armor and would therefore be unable to loot anything but those handful of enemies.
---
-----
---
I agree on the rest though. 
---
I'm guessing they want to add more in the future , idk.
---
&gt; It's the definition of a bad AAA game.
---
It's a pretty ok early access indie sandbox though and well worth the 10€ on the grey market.
---
That's unfortunate. Oh well. No harm no foul. 
---
great idea, lot of freedom like the ES games and different races, diff traits and more replayability.
---
wouldn't be too hard for a storyline considering vaults experimented on the dwellers, maybe they were testing FEV, maybe you could choose to use the FEV on yourself at some point. imagine working with super mutants to help them conquer the wasteland.
---
just as easy to have people irreversibly turn into ghouls with enough long term rads exposure etc thatd really make a lot of different paths one could travel in the wasteland.
---
Yeah I sometimes build a Fusion Generator at the best ones, which costs me some of my own materials, but sometimes I just put a bunch of large generators 10 energy ones down and some resource extractors and I don't need to spend anything, or very little with Contractor perk.
---
I have a better one, just wipe everyone's inventory.
---
Just going to copy my last comment. 
---
So scorched effects DO more damage on SB and SBQ? Thats my main question. Because I keep seeing some people saying yeah, and others saying no
---
You collect more resources from mineral nodes if you use it. 
---
This would be hard to implement in a way that makes sense lore-wise. One possibility is to have you start the game in a cart after getting caught crossing the border.
---
Probably duped though. Oof.
---
Finally.
---
Kudos to you, good sir for at least coming up with an interim solution to killing these SBs easier instead of +1 to more rants.
---
Thumb up.
---
Thanks for the help.
---
&gt; I wouldn't think they would keep the stash storage always loaded either.
---
I think they do, based on the observation that your stash's junk resources don't exist until you open the stash for the first time each session. If you open build mode or use a workbench, it will only show you the amount of junk you have in your direct inventory. But the first time you open your stash in a session, you have to wait a second as it checks in with the server, and from that point onwards you can use your stash junk for building/crafting.
---
But yeah, I think we agree here. I'd much prefer the regular stash storage over having to deal with mules. But I am guessing that that's lots harder to do.
---
Not the worst i've seen, but bad 
---
Can we get the built in stairs to stack on themselves?
---
Seriously, this gave me goosebumps. Really awesome.
---
For the Emperor!
---
Only reliable with ballistic shotguns. Shotguns multiply the repair effect by number of pellets that hit the target.
---
Otherwise, it's pretty much worthless. Even with high ROF weapons the supposed "Repair effect" is impossible to notice. Bet it's bugged or not working correctly due to network issues.
---
My primary storage mule is level 2 with well over 100k weight, all completely legitimate, I transfer from my main to it multiple times per day and have just about since launch.
---
Where is this located?
---
I can craft Calibrated Shocks, Jetpack and some other mods for you if you play at Xbox.
---
Bro, Adhesive.
---
I literally drop 3 bulk adhesive for level 2-10's, because I'm swimming in that shit.
---
Gotta give it away, cos vendors are tightarses haha
---
It hasn't been out that long...
---
Lulz
---
Thanks for the offers but i m on ps4 
---
I ll check it out next time thx bud
---
That would be a solution to duped items in the marketplace. I’m not sure how much of the player base would survive a full wipe though.
---
In a sense this is a wipe by making everything you have next to worthless but you get to keep it all!
---
They could just nerf explosive shotguns so all pallets count as just 1 explosion. And make it so Two Shots and Explosive bullets are on the same prefix. Because of that change everyone who has both effects to only keep one effect and thange the second one with something else.
---
I should have named my two cats Thoughts and Prayers, because they’re equally fucking useless and do nothing at all to help a problem.
---
How high is this cliff? It's possible the engine forced your build area down because you'd be hitting the actual height cap
---
I love the Scorchbeasts .. always give me the creeps when i suddenly see their shadow on the ground. 
---
As a 100% solo only player i absolutely enjoy every corner of the world + it\`s enemies. Yesterday i did the BOS mission "Belly of the beast" and the fight in the cave at the end was amazing.   
---
Personally i hate farming for legendaries - it\`s way more fun when you get a cool weapon while exploring the world. 
---
If the only thing you\`re doing is farming legendaries - what are you using these legendaries for in the end?  
---
Amass huge bounties blowing up bases and workshops with a two shot explosive. Insta-killing every player that hasn’t duped, bought, or rarely earned their own TSE.
---
I would love this, even if just expanded to include all the crop-like plants like cranberries, blast berries, etc
---
My buddy has had a base there for a while now it's an awesome place
---
Radaway was the hardest for me early on. 
---
Thanks! Glad i got all 3 lockpick perks. I need to join BoS, I hit level 50 like 2 days ago and i'm taking it (relatively) slow
---
I literally have my camp there :D
---
I haven’t gotten to that kind of level yet to fight back. So for me they at least give some immersions as the scary things in the sky that I should hide from.

My male character sometimes sounds like a female. My guess is that the server is sending effect commands to the wrong character so I'm getting that "play female-being-hit-21.wav" instead of them.

Rusty sledge hammer &gt; shiny new minigun

(And hammer ammo is weightless.)
---
Its the pylon next to the monotail elevator, to get thereI took the monorail elevator to the top, jumped onto the monorail (with Marsupial), jumped onto the actual rail, opened the camp menu and just went along the rail until it turned green.
---
You can actually place your C.A.M.P on the rail, just wont be able to place anything. Wish they would give us floors without foundation. 
---
Then I had the idea of building on the pylon, went there, was able to drop my C.A.M.P again, even military barriers and crafting stations but you cant drop foundations. 
---
That specific pylon is only accessible via the rail from the monorail elevator.
---
It has been talked about a lot on this sub. 
---
The general consensus is: it's left open for future content. New Holo tapes when the dlc is launched. 
---
I'd settle for lvl 50 moleminers
---
Honestly I can’t quite work out how the Junkie dmg bonus works...would appear to do just over 9% per addiction, I’ve read that str is 5% per point so gaining an addiction bonus while losing a pt of Str is still a net of 4%, but the Psycho giving an extra point of dmg is confusing...I’d thought Junkie might be a fun alternative to the other more popular prefixes and maybe with unyielding it would work, but it won’t compete...too bad, I was hoping for something like the give and take of mutations but addiction is more give (obviously addiction is bad but this is a video game)
---
thats kinda a weird decision that camps cant have the fast travel mat, i saw another post that said he kept breaking his legs due to his camping being on a cliff and him falling off it due to the bad spawn location

Just got ambushed by one and logged out, picked up my phone and this was the first thread.

this reminds me of the random whispers youll hear in the toxic valley, it could be there to fuck with you, or maybe its some sort of strong memory the player has. it logically answers both the organ and whispers in the toxic valley as people can bring up memories and hear voices of people from the memories. or it could be supernatural like lots of things in fallout are
---
They start trying to trade their duped items for more items to dupe.
---
Seriously on the trading forums you'll see tons of people who will only accept trades for things, they won't take caps, probably because they've hit the max already.

what happened to "balance gear progression so there is no BiS random loot"

makes sense, but you'd think bethesda would start a new quest for the new holo tapes in the newly opened vaults or whatever
---
Entitled players who think they own Whitespring because they rabidly do nothing but farm ghouls there during the 10-15 minutes they play before getting bored, don't want camp turrets *"stealing" "their"* kills.  
---
-----  
---
Literal jerks build camps filled with dozens of turrets just to literally steal kills from legitimate players who want to engage in rewarding gameplay at the Whitesprings
---
Too tanks? And most of major problems can be solved using he power patcher perk which makes it break slower and cost less materials, you do have to spec a lot of points into int also however 
---
I hadn't considered the weekly ones too. All fair points here 
---
I hope the people in here feel shame for doing this now that everyone is on board with the turret hate wagon
---
Farming legendaries and plans to sell to others? Oh wait dupers ruined that
---
Doing events and vendor runs to stock up caps? What do you mean it's boring and not worthwhile
---
PvP for fun? No one should have to pvp in this game
---
This is needed in the next patch as it probably is the most requested fixes.  Bethesda need to show that they are somewhat listening and implement it.
---
You tell me, mine is stuck with 40% iventory greyed out because of a ghost purifier.
---
Could just be it doesn't work with the unarmed bobblehead. Could be possible if this is an unintentional effect that's only applying to certain weapon types. 
---
I have an Excel sheet, but I still make mistakes.
---
nice!!
---
does it get attacked a lot?
---
I got the luck of the gods and got a .50 TSE but it stays in my stash unless I see someone else using it or I want to be an ac-130 because it ruins the game and makes it too easy 
---
True. I'm mostly interested in legit methods anyway haha
---
Dude, you can get perks and armor that let's you do this 100% legitimate. If you don't like it, complain to Bethesda that they rebalance  things, but don't accuse other players of cheating when they are not. 
---
um, wtf is that mask photo bombing you bottom left corner ???
---
"​If the only thing you`re doing is farming legendaries - what are you using these legendaries for in the end?"
---
Finally someone else gets it.
---
Lol yeah I feel that. I've been struggling with finding a shotgun build that's really good without using explosive, just because it's so damn broken I don't want it. 
---
Anything that affect gameplay is a no go.
---
And If you find the meat pile, it's a rotating sign.
---
Bloodied is the real MVP. TSE is the fresh noob weapon lol. Since getting this I've had so much more fun with combat.
---
Noone would dupe a two shot gatling gun:P  Probably just some player dumping some legendaries weighing them down..
---
Last time i started up the game i was in cranberry bog and 4 spawned on me at once. I barely made it to watoga.
---
I managed the same thing and was totally shocked because I wanted to build a flying base before realising I could build it down the ground, it is possible to 1 up that and build it into a crevasse which I’ve seen someone do, seems to only work in specific spots tho
---
I just use a hazmat suit, I have radsponge and just share it when I’m doing a nuke with random people and just never worry about the rads, with the mutations you shouldn’t really have to worry about dying just be ready to use stims when you need too 
---
There's a 15 special cap which governs perks being equip able but you can boost it MUCH higher via legendary armour and consumables. For example, a full set of Unyielding armour gives you up to +15 to all stats except endurance at low health (as well as +stat minor powers on the individual pieces). Whisky with party boy/girl gives +6 str.
---
Pro tip. You can get a lot more water and much faster at workshops. I farm it up so easy if I want some to sell.

I find it impressive you did this in game, But I also hate you because I know if someone did this to me I would be pissed. Lol
---
I bought mine from the Grafton station vendor, after which I was disconnected from the server and it didn’t save. 
---
Back to server hopping for me! Oh the joys!
---
I had this thought but this isn't a good way to do it. They should've let us complete this quest and let us start another one when dlc is out. Otherwise, it's hard to figure out whether it's a bug or it's intentional.
---
This is what worries me about the vault dlc.
---
The rewards are going ri be trash for the ppl that play hard.
---
My buddies did 1 nuke and quit...i run around with explosive bullshit and other op setups 
---
Their dev's are gnomes locked in a closet in the basement of Bethesda headquarters. They don't get out much. 
---
Mines on the road next to it. Big mistake. I'm level 19 and there's level 62 ghouls that spawn there every 15 minutes :|
---
I'm still (moderately) grinding for a TSE weapon and until then, I just collect ammo and health items, then drop them off in Flatwoods. I do events, such as Powering up poseidon to help the surrounding workshops with power, or horde events and then drop those low level legendary items in Flatwoods as well.
---
Nah mate, xbox
---
I haven’t ever seen those mods but what if Bethesda decreased the drop chance of explosive bent and increased the others, that would give people a reason to farm the SBQ  despite the fact ultrwcite isn’t actually the best armour
---
Yeah I'll probably have to try bloodied next, I've already got serendipity, nerd rage, etc because I've built my character to be as immortal as possible.
---
I just haven't been able to beat my two shot combat shotgun. It's annoying that neither of the other shotguns can get piercing mods either, really limits the options.

Read this thread. Shit my pants. Just realized my X-01 Stealth Boy is gone! I have NO FUCKING WORDS for how demoralized I am given how many hours I put into to getting them. I have NO. FUCKING. WORDS. I don't understand. We're encouraged to scrap our junk, repair our weapons, build our bases...and this like if the game scrapped a weapon from your inventory without your knowledge each time you did so. How was this missed? This fuckin hurts.

Lol, you don't mow your lawns in America? :p

Honestly i had the same ideas for points 1 and 2 and was considering posting about it, although I would move it to 75 first then maybe 100 later on, give all the 45 items a chance to be the best for a while maybe keep moving it up every 6 months or so but you'd have to stop somewhere eventually

BGS mistake was to market it as a finished product. If FO76 had been marketed as early access GAS, i'm sure BGS wouldn't have been in such a shitstorm.

We‘re launching every day around 10-15 nukes on the queen and I finally got 5 ultracite mods in the last 2 days which I didn’t had before. I hope that the luck will still be with me in the next days.

Without the market adjusting there'd be no hope for the game to recover. You do want to keep on playing the game, do you?

Sure thing bro.

wow im lvl 209 did not know this my camp is near there
---
Scorchbeasts either need to be nerfed or made peaceful towards &lt;lvl50 or so players. The flare fun takes up too much weight just for this stupid creature, and for lower level players that can't actually fight it it doesn't distract long enough for them to run away.
---
have your karma
---
People seem to be gravitating towards Grognak's Axe but i think the legendary effects matter much more than the weapon form.
---
any gym would do, gives about 250\~ lead. there's a gym near flatwoods by the motel up north, and also another gym by the theme park in the toxic valley. takes longer waiting on loading screen than it does looting. so, if you know several gyms, you could easily rack up over 1000 in less than a half an hour (if no one has cleaned house earlier, that is).

 Btw, if you want to, the fastest way to gain an addiction is to back and forth 2 conflicting chems, a med-x then a psycho then a Med-x...etc.  I would exit the pip boy in between each dose, about 5 is usually enough and always was the first chem I took.

nothing wrong with re-using assets, especially if they are reskinned/remade. but people expect a level of 'new' stuff on top of re-used assets, and i dunno if fallout 76 have made enough new stuff to really be cool. fallout 4 felt pretty nifty with the ghoul remake, awesome stuff.

The engine probably has no way of blocking the sonic booms and farts when you're inside, and it wouldn't distinguish between a pile of crap under a bridge and a solid house. I mean this engine is so dumb in regards to structures that it bloody rains indoors!

Seriously, I'd rather the game crash out 100x in a day than to lose precious gear we worked hard to obtain and that is important for our experience.

Now I have to go through the 5 stages of grief for something so ridiculous. "Oh look, we fixed it!" Really? It's like eating a burger with a roach in it...come out the kitchen with a gas mask saying the problem is now fixed still leaves a pretty bad taste in my mouth. My god...why?!?

Not a secret either

Power fist and Deathclaw Gauntlet will give you the highest numbers because it scales higher than 1h and 2h weapons. As a melee build, nothing is stronger than a 20% build with a full set of unyielding armor and a bloodied Unarmed weapon. PA actually handicaps a melee build.
---
Rebuild cache, my bad I got it mixed up. Says it may take hours, took like 5 minutes for me. 
---
Ive seen it multiple times, always legendary, always fissure prime nuke.
---
Of course i did not fight queen ever. Those 100 super stimpacks i got from vault and 40 plans: ultracite explosive vents i have from flatwoods killing those farmhands.  So Scorched earth is 28 min long event? still not less than minute. You gotta pump some boobleheads to do it faster.

You can avoid and mitigate from multiple sources - my cavalier set drops 75% damage when sprinting and 40% from all players. That's before any of my perks come into play which are mostly avoidance % based.
---
But you're right to an extent that pvp is totally broken in this game as its almost entirely who fires first.
---
No problem. Just be sure if you want to add a mutation later, either by farming or using a serum, you take the card off first. Add the mutation and then replace it to lock it in. 
---
I tried this for a few days and ended up having to move because I didn't have the budget for the amount of turrets required to live there.
---
I was dealing with swarms of 20+ ferals or a few radstags every fifteen minutes or so. Spent more time killing than actually doing anything at camp. I don't know how you people can live there.
---
Place one terminal outside. Doesn’t need to be connected to the door and can be lock. Then put a switch inside that’ll power the door when on. Ideally you’ll want the switch next to the door in a spot you can activate it outside while the door is open, so you can close it without using the terminal again. Also, make sure the switch and terminal are connected somewhere in the line.
---
Use terminal to go in, switch to go out. That’s the closest solution I’ve found.
---
Keep the day job
---
Man I'd loved to have fallen in with a RP squad like you. While my squad weren't min/maxing were definitely pushing end goal over RP. Now we're pretty much sitting around twiddling our thumbs. 
---
Is it really that complex? The code to prevent depositing would literally just be a check if the item is already at or above the limit. The auto drop might be another 2 short lines. I'm sure Bethesda could handle it.
---
SHOW THE SKIN 
---
Missing the xp exploit huh?
---
Juat kidding, this is a good question!
---
1 and 2 make sense, but number 3 punishes hoarders too much lol. I try to keep a lot of extra stuff and a mule definitely helps since my stash is mostly devoted to junk :/
---
Doctors HATE him!
---
Heh yeah, but I dunno, was playing with the pals and thought about it!
---
where did you get the plans ?
---
someone really went through and downvoted every comment on here
---
Fyi, did some testing
---
Gives living enemies a red glow
---
Dead is dead, no glow
---
you gotta live near the robots :) they are my turrets
---
Fucking Evan 
---
Well i kept  getting attacked by low level ghouls.. still do and it holds them back. Im not near the main building tho, im on the green on the last hole XD
---
We experienced more bugs than new players today but we also experienced things some people never will. Like Whitesprings without hordes of top-level mobs. Wondering what the hell 90% of things did and having to figure it out ourselves a lot of the time because there just wasn't a lot of good info yet. Just looking at the map and seeing like 20 other people running around the newbie areas was special in its own way. I'd be more bitter about the price drop if I wasn't sure that I've more than received my money's worth... rage inducing bugs and all.  
---
but but but I thought this game was flying off the shelves, this sub keeps saying that anyone who says this game sold poorly is just a hater. 
---
Empath is horrible. Also, I really hate twisted muscles and talons as a gun user, so those should be avoided..
---
Would definitely be interested when this posts.
---
Pics or it didn't happen
---
Rad shield does. It has weird diminishing returns at 10k+ resistance though
---
I found a Large Deathclaw Gauntlet in a vendor, is it any different,
---
You only get one of them.
---
I read that as "I have a rare skin disease" and I thought this was another one of those real talk posts about using this game as ain inspiration to overcoming real life difficulties.
---
I was talking about mules in the literal sense, though. seeing as how we don't have an universal, cross-character stash. not as extra space.
---
I didn't, agreed with someone to craft it for me, but he's not in game, and I'm looking to gather mats for it. Not sure if [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:\_T-51b\_Right\_Leg](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:_T-51b_Right_Leg) applies to lvl50 one.
---
Definition of a secret: not known or seen or not meant to be known or seen by others
---
Large Deathclaw Gauntlet is the modded version with the extra claw.
---
Alright then Gaijin
---
My base sometimes gets attacked by three of them. It's a tad annoying, but with a 50% armor piercing Hand Made it only takes a minute or two to kill them. Just strafe or hide behind trees while grinding them down.  
---
When they fix the Sonic spamming but they will be extremely easy to kill.
---
I’m in a concrete bunker.
---
The scorchbeast is melee stacking me through the wall 
---
Also I think it might be common knowledge but one rank of each iron fist (Basic, Expert, Master) is more effective than 3 ranks of any of them.
---
This is the most clickbaity title ever.
---
show the skin boi
---
What gets me is the terrible xp you get, 370ish for 15 minutes work vs 400ish for glowing ghoul that takes seconds
---
Hordes only respawn a lot if you’re on a team and someone resets their game every time you kill all of the ghouls, OR, random people show up after every horde.
---
But we knew it...me and my friends are always using it while the blast zone is on WS.It's known and it's not meant to be unknown...
---
They respawn when new people enter, just like other areas do. It's not strictly a timing thing.
---
That looks pretty damn cool, I really need to find a decent location and build around whats already there like you did. Currently I just have a tower...
---
You can fight them sure, but how many stimpacks do you waste? Level 15 raider PA is not that tanky.
---
I've been trying the rejoin trick, but it doesn't seem to work on the Golf Club for some reason.  (The rest of the whitesprings seems to work fine).  Any tips on what might be screwing up the spawn at the Golf Club?
---
Hey I'm a raider in demand and I operate know if someone atk me ok but otherwise I'm good with junk, acid,black titanium boom I'm gold otherwise free junk PvP is good if your the patience group
---
I managed to kill that little bitch after hopping like thrice or frice
---
He was just trying to pet them, George. 
---
Has there been any news on a fix for this? It's ruining my immersion when I can't see my teammate's trash power armor xD
---
Not even mentioning the slenderman in underwear bug, djeeeeeezus
---
What platform 
---
Yo she just did it again twice ! Thats like 7 times tonight. 
---
I prefer the super sledge or the all rise
---
Hello! I was wondering if you still have the "tracking lights" plan available? 
---
I think it was the OP, looks like he's 12.
---
maybe they did another ghost nerf at whitespring, idk. they used to spawn everytime i rejoined (i was the only one who crashed every other min so i kept respawning them) but a while ago we figured out that the club has to be completely empty of all ghouls and players because they stopped respawning but even then the respawning wasnt 100% guaranteed
---
Welcome Matt is in misc. At the very end of the build tabs. It doesn't work for your camp though, only workshops
---
I think there is only one iron fist card.
---
mini mega sloths ?
---
I like the idea of Scorchbeasts, but the mechanics for the fights seem a bit damaged, especially for an enemy that is far too easy to find and hard to avoid. The glitches just seem a bit out of control at the moment. I couldn't even fight the beast in the Glass Cavern because the game was glitching a second one in and out constantly.
---
Definitely a secret. I’m over 100 levels and I had no idea
---
Super useful ty op
---
The emperor protects indeed =) love it, maybe I can get some dark angel kit going
---
Yeah, I've seen several dead ones but haven't seen a live baby yet.
---
Yeah like Disease Cure is a secret untill you find out about it...
---
Hey would you be willing to sell a jetpack or trade it for some legendaries?
---
Mom says it's my turn on the xbox.
---
3 locations at camp venture, one at tree tops just north of camp venture, Sunday brothers cabin and a train car east of the watoga train station. Farmed those locations over a few days and had everything
---
Wow, never saw one 
---
It’s so out of the way that most people wouldn’t stumble upon it. It’s a great location. Actually today, three people set off nukes at once. THREE. I got to see them all go off from my little fortress :)
---
I used it when 2 schorched beasts attacked me. 2 people saw it and came for the rescue. Love the mechanic. 
---
Nah all are dead because they didn't know how to handle the firearms. I see body's with hunting rifles and 5.56 ammo nearby and no .308 then in another spot 44 rounds near a body holding a 10mm. 
---
 "Scorched are coming boys! Put down dem banjos and arm up! WUUUT? These bullets don't fit!" God damn it Carl!!!! "
---
No no. You're right.
---
Being an ass would probably be more rage-inducing if you didn't speak worse English than a stroke victim with a fucking keyboard. 
---
Yeah, free caps
---
Jason Voorhees bobble head in front of my tv haha
---
I have the same skin, it is shocking, nobody will believe me either, as it's both shocking and undelieveable.
---
A shame no mechanism exists anywhere on the internet to share images...
---
BTW does anyone have unclaimed PPI.... :-)
---
I watched that youtube video too, Oxhorn is pretty amazing...
---
Nope, it’s kinetic 
---
Hairdressers are sick expensive tho ;)
---
Wow you guys are unlucky. My stuck one seems to use 0%
---
I thought that too
---
Ballistic damage, ammo will benefit from Batteries Included though.
---
There also seems to be a beneficial bug for reloading.
---
I have The Dragon, a blackpowder rifle and a blackpowder pistol. At a particularly meaty target (especially when I was lower level), I would shoot all 3 in consecutive order.
---
The bug is when reloading The Dragon or the pistol, sometimes the blackpowder rifle will be automatically reloaded. I don't know the technique or how the bug works exactly as I never tested it thoroughly.
---
Many occassions I have shot Dragon, Rifle, Pistol, reload Dragon, able to shoot Dragon and Rifle (without ever reloading the Rifle). Or the other way around since Pistol is fastest to reload, Dragon, Rifle, Pistol, reload pistol, Pistol, Rifle.
---
Somehow the reload for other blackpowder weapons can reload the rifle at the same time as well.
---
level 1 legendaries are quite valuable to people leveling new characters
---
So like i said because of that Sony might feel resentment towards Bethesda
---
I have the first one it’s just me in the back ground looking at them as they fight to the beach it’s the best 
---
I don't get it. In Fallout 4 there were always other guys stealing my kills or destroying my camps. The only difference now is that they are real players.
---
Maybe people like to be raiders or just dicks, just as in the Commenwealth. But is a bit sad to try and solve it outside of the game.
---
Thanks. I did it, but it literally took less than 5 mins (expecting hours). 
---
I don’t get too many crashes, but the few I get are annoying. 
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Could not agree more.
---
Change my mind
---
PS4
---
1. Server disconnect¡!!!!!!!!  Everyday, multiple
---
I have great internet and wired connection
---
2. 99% of the time if your in a underground mine tunnel or cave any power armor can't be placed.
---
3. Graphic issues, abstract visual enemies or just they are just a skinny line of some color
---
Also the game is becoming a joke to other game developers
---
If you have pocket mod gear that doesn't count when wearing power armour as only the stats of the power armour will be in use.
---
More Create-a-wanderer options! I'd happily pay for more face and body sliders. Also hair, under armour, and accessories. 
---
Yeah, if I am in PA, and have a building, I can take on 2 with all the little scorchlings they send at me, but with a 3rd, no thanks. 
---
Why not be honest and have the title be "please watch my video, Reddit people."
---
No problem! Some people say it works, some say it doesn't. I hope it does for you! 
---
I got 7 empty queens tonight. I was beyond upset
---
Yes, it happens. I bought Battlefield 4 two weeks after launch for 20 dollars on Cyber Monday sales (stacked coupons) and that was 60 dollars on launch.
---
You would think using flamers would work.
---
Miniature giant space hamsters.
---
I literally went through all the posts on your profile and STILL cannot find the one with the damn fountain 
---
i did this on my last playthrough. good shit. dragons are boring as hell.
---
The other day I dropped of 32 corn soups, half dozen fusion cores, and nearly a dozen plans. I hope some folks made use of it.
---
It was quite annoying to be disconnected in Glass Cavern only to find myself loaded back into a nuke zone. The only reason I probably survived was because I was wearing PA when I disconnected. On the positive side this did somehow fully charge my fusion core. 
---
Yes, they are broken and poorly designed. What makes them even worse is F76 itself. Did quest, where I had to fight off waves of monsters and game decided spawn spontaneously two SB that were not part of the quest. Now I was doing quest while two f#cktards spamming sonic sh#t at me from the air. 
---
Then there is how badly F76 is balance. Either you take SB down like nothing or you don't. This means you can't give them anything good as guaranteed. SB aint rare enemies &amp; when I can take them down with 5 seconds, I would overflow with riches.
---
Alcohol doesn’t stack.
---
I saw an excevator bright lamp while hopping to get handmade today. But only had enough caps for the rifle soon let it pass by. Will never see again.
---
Great idea. I manually had a list of all components that i tried sticking too. Bit bothersome though and would've loved to have that automated.
---
Impressive, very impressive.
---
Or having a nuclear warhead dropped on it... Lol
---
One horde per person?
---
So basically, they're buff cliff racers.
---
The cryolator's damage is relatively low, but it's ability to freeze enemies comes in handy quite a bit.
---
or you just need Bard to hit the same plate his ancestor hit with the grappling hook.
---
Ninety.... five..... k.....? How?!?!?? Blimey I can’t even imagine how you’d get that. Furious+bloodied on an already 1k dmg weapon? I can’t fathom it 
---
I play as a heavy gunner character but I mean come on, who uses the minigun when the gataling gun uses the same ammo and does way more damage?
---
*Goes to the Atom Store and sees that paint job.
---
Dam, now I guess I have to pick up a minigun and change my gataling gun to Ultracite ammo....
---
This is probably the issue
---
Abit close to the heart here..
---
I gave up the trader life and since i own almost all things. I find it best to spend the time just helping others while we wait for patches and content.
---
If your ever hit that point like i and others did. Move to Overseer Camp and help us to help others. :)
---
I mean unless you wanna go for your 100th Queen kill and stock up on more items that your stash probably can't hold lol.
---
Go for the eyes boo!
---
so i think we might have opposite definitions of "luck"
---
I'm on pc, Tarnowski1 
---
Stash the cores, deplete your current one via power attacks. Leave server and join again. The most useful thing I learned on Reddit.
---
And how many of you supported Beth by buying 400 atoms to buy that skin? 
---
Got mine in the Grafton train station.
---
It is absolutely absurd. I charge in, melt some face with some close up blasts, once I have a critical (which ends up being 1 out of every 3-4 shots basically), it's a free 1 hit kill, from any distance usually.
---

You're under armor is removed when you get in PA too.
---
pets. now. I'll pay for them, too.
---
Most people don’t know this though, as shown by some of the comments on here and on the video. I’m just trying to spread the word for this little helpful tip.
---
I dunno.  Im still disappointed that new vegas didnt have "Vault 51"
---
I see.
---
Well there is always the Recon scope that tags them, even after death.  But that sometimes does not work.
---
thatd be cool, and it could give us the identity of the flatwoods monster as it doesnt seem to be a regular zetan (correct me if im wrong on that) and it would give the toxic valley another purpose that sint getting perfect storm
---
I see Gramps is giving you a hard time because he knew...woohoo.
---
Public knowledge or not, I did not know this so thanks for sharing!
---
See, I was thinking of a holocaust cloak. All I would need is a wheel barrow and I'd be all set.
---
What’s vault 51 about 
---
Oh right, could have thought of that myself. Thank you.
---
Glad I helped you and thanks for your support mate. Hard to please everyone
---
Then its a valid weapon and better appreciated!
---
Best encounter I’ve ever had was in glass cavern. I ran like crazy to get into the tunnels to avoid the fissure site prime beside it. Then after you fight the one in the caves for the BoS mission the game glitches out and the scorchbeast which spawned above ground outside was now attacking me and flying through the walls of the glasses cavern. To kill it I had mere seconds every time it flew by, attacking and blinding me before flying through the walls of the caves and reappearing from another wall! It was crazy bugged out. 
---
Your welcome pal
---
I still haven’t seen a Flatwoods monster (I’m level 79) so I don’t know if it’s like a zetas but zetans are like green cliché aliens and the Flatwoods monster is this purple helmet floating thing 
---
I've run across this... It was interesting.  I felt bad for the babies.
---
nope, they just sometimes drop nuke material (hardened mass,...)
---
No problem mate, thanks for your positivity 😊
---
If you start at Watoga Station and follow the rail tracks west, there's a rail car you can enter that normally contains a .45 Submachine Gun and a random plan. These plans seem to have a high chance of being some sort of underarmour, I've gotten the wetsuit plans and a bunch of BoS underarmours there through server hopping. Be extremely careful though, the area is guarded by multiple Assaultrons.
---
If you travel even further west along the tracks from that point, you'll come across an area called NAR Repair Yard. You can often find a random plan spawn here, inside the cylindrical hut. This area happened to spawn the wetsuit plans for me just a few days ago. Hope this helps.
---
There is no point raising items levels if there is no matching content. Last SBQ I did died in less than 3 minutes, now if items level are raised, the damage is raised, means SBQ dies even faster. Between #1 and #2, they need to actually release meaningful endgame before they decide to increase weapon damage output. 
---
2,000 people, lots of weapons and equipment but less food
---
I use unarmed and just start beating the absolute shit out of them when they land.
---
Do events and workshops. Also follow the overseer's trail. It can lead you in different areas. Another is simply pick through everything. Up by Grafton has tons of stuff and even out to Charleston. 
---
Also at your level always be crafting. Making spare weapons and armor just to break down to try to learn mods will be huge at later levels.
---
As an explosive shotgun user with sheet shooter and enforcer, I love the fact that Schorchbeasts are now a breeze! Just pop them out of the sky and they are done in seconds!
---
Ahhh so lots of death but awesome explosions sounds promising
---
Cool and helpful, but it is still not a secret, less sensationalising would go a long way...
---
it has purple fog in its helmet to purposefully hide its identity
---
I noticed this too. Its not good and I assume a bug. Wish to have my laser beam back, but doubt its high priority, unfortunately. 
---
Step 1 - Get all mutations 
---
Step 2 - Max Strength
---
Step 3 - Get both Party Girl and Cola thing maxed
---
Carry some Nuka Colas instead of stimpacks and some whisky. 
---
I call it the Popeye build. With Psycho I hit 500 or so in a team. Pretty quickly too. 
---
I got 2 
---
well they literally didnt do anything for at least quite a month now.
---
It's Boo, please !
---
Pffft. The Salamanders would've not only gotten you home, but also started up a warm cozy fire in the fireplace, made hot cocoa, and read you a bedtime story while gently patting your head to lull you to sleep.
---
game continues to be poop.
---
like, only 500 people were killed, then the vault opened. a group of vault dwellers were sent out and killed by tribes men
---
Gotta wait a day, sadly.
---
Get Speed Demon and Marsupial to dodge the Reeeeee's too. 
---
Well, i need to switch from Rifles to Lockpick when i find a safe...guess what...that safe is not in my C.A.M.P.
---
If you blueprinted your base, the components are actually stored in the blueprints and keep your budget.  Decompose/delete your blueprints into components.
---
The cap was 60 in the vanilla. But quests ended around 58...
---
PM me your gt and I'll add you. I'm a 5 right now just starting out 
---
Congrats, you just became the Survivalist from Zion.
---
Its only real practical benefit is that it’s light for thee amount of damage it does. Its actually got a lot of downsides when you dig into it, it’s slow attack speed the same as the super sledge, does less damage than the supersledge, can’t be repaired over 100% and can’t be modded. It’s still my pick for best though, mostly because it’s fucking wicked looking. 
---
They're giant ass rabid bats m8
---
Yup that's a no no.
---
&gt;No consequences
---
What if you were locked into your stat blocks, and can only move one point at a time, making it impossible to switch it up on the fly
---
It being easier to roll a new character than bother changing a build
---
You're still locked out of options mate. If you don't wanna switch your cards on the fly, you do you boo
---
My point is, why is there ballistic damage scale with demolition perk for the non-explosive prefix cryolator? And why is there no ballistic damage for the explosive prefix cryolator? 
---
Lok tar Ogar
---
Yeah they will drop the right leg instead of the left.
---
Exactly. Live with your choice.
---
AFAIK there are 7 vendors who don't share the same cap pool.
---
They were so much better before the patch. I'd always get a weapon, armour, food, drink and a little extra like a mod or something
---
And now try to picture the devs who went and said "Yeah.... yeah, I think it's done, let's ship it like this".
---
Bethesda can go stick knives in their eye sockets.
---
Stabilised flux and mutation recipes would be nice.
---
They should at least hear this guy out over a meeting.
---
mutation ?
---
Yeah there are 7 total.
---
[http://dulfy.net/2018/11/22/fallout-76-vendors-locations-and-factions-guide/](http://dulfy.net/2018/11/22/fallout-76-vendors-locations-and-factions-guide/)
---
There’s like 7 different vendors you can get 200 off each one for 1400 a day 
---
Give us whole building sets. A basically plays on the current sets. Maybe a log cabin for the shack complete with  a wood shingle roof. Different colors for the barn sets as well as some slate roofs. Maybe a nice Frankincense Lloyd Wright inspired set.
---
I'm not sure this is what's happening.. but there are two stages to levelling up.
---
First you get to add a point. Then you get to choose a card. It doesn't matter which point you add, you can choose a card from any of the stats. 
---
So for example, you level up. Add a point to strength, but choose a new agility card.
---
Checks out...I'm built on a cliff, &amp; pulled almost all my hair out getting it done.
---
Nah, it seems your choice and i will not live with it.
---
One mutation per server, please make sure you don’t have starched genes equipped while trying to farm mutations. Rad barrels can be quick sources for mutations, but I had my camp next to water and would spam collect dirty water, die, and respawn until I got mutated.
---
Yup.  I just avoid them now.  I've burned too much resources for shit rewards.  ooooo!  I just traded 15 minutes of my time, 500 rounds of ammo and 12 stimpaks for a level 30 leather arm?  Wow.  No thanks.
---
Nope at the time I did not have the mutation. It was also repeatable. I could put pieces away and pull them back and it would work.
---
Wait, did you make a new suggestion and imposed it on the topic to make it seem worse by criticizing it? Wow.
---
At least some parts I think the bones can be scrapped into Ultracite. I also have experienced their corpses  despawning before I can loot them. It would be nice if they dropped a random legendary item.
---
Plan spawns at drop site c2. On the shelves to the left. Happy hunting. Also the train car west of watoga station, but that place is pretty farmed over.
---
You do it man, you can choose to only switch your cards at your C.A.M.P.
---
How dare i forget the capital. Minsc would never forgive me :(
---
2nd floor balcony ;)
---
Even if you had to pay a periodic pass to use the train station/vendor route.
---
Just shield your eyes....
---
I’m level 74 I think I can help you guys get started. Can message me for my gamer tag 
---
The point of this flew right over your head, didn't it?
---
and it could be a rouge zetan that was crippled and had its legs removed and replaced with the thrusters after it crashed on earth or something
---
That's still 4 fucking dollars.  
---
The game itself costs 60.
---
Well the one I did was level 68 mobs and they ripped me apart.  (I am transitioning from PA build to a armor build).  308/498/20 resists.  I need more legendary Vanguard to get more increases.  I guess I could go the bloodied way and do the unyielding armors.. but want to try vanguard first.
---
Anyway, I finally made it through and got a single legendary.  That level 20 walking cane was worth the entire effort!
---
there should be 3 decks, one for combat, one for QoL and one for crafting/housing. All active at the same time but only modifiable at level up.
---
I think the devs don't play the game, because in what way they thought that this PVP is going to work? or SB? or endgame? F76 looks like game that was put together and then checked if like there are any major errors/exceptions and no one really didn't give a sh#t about is the game actually "Working". I mean whole point of nukes were that it was hard to launch them and people had to find other people with codes and work together obtain rare resources from nuke zones. Instead I can launch nuke every 20 minutes alone &amp; if I decide to nuke something other than SBQ or Whitespring, its a pretty much wasted nuke. 
---
whenever i play with friends and notice one of those 'turret platforms' i allways call out to them, nuke blow that platform sky high and instantly my friend kills me so nobody else get the caps for my bounty, usually the person then leaves the world in rage over their camp being destroyed by high levels xD
---
seriusly not fun when you decide to 'just one lap around the ghouls then off to do other things' and find 20-30 turrets shooting all the ghouls constantly even without the person that owns the camp there, making all those drops be in the void :(
---
I don't care what they said. Weekly patches should be be a thing 
---
Not even sure \*why\* you have one as a pet, those things are creepy.
---
So are we forgetting bethesda is worth 2.5 billion dollars and that they already made millions day 1 from this fucking game?
---
Again, not the point of this. I already know many people want everything to be extremely convenient. I am wondering why people are like that.
---
That was the first game to get me hooked on RPG's. Addict ever since :)
---
Sure, build a window on the wall and feed powerline from outside into the garage area.  Done.
---
Believe it or not, the system works pretty good. If you want to switch back and forth, switch back and forth. If you don't, don't.
---
I agree switching cards back and forth should be limited. My thought was to allow switching only at level ups. It doesn't hurt anything to be able to though. Preventing switching WILL have a negative impact on quite a few people's game though.
---
I don't agree with Beth's choice here, but I certainly see why they did it.
---
That's why you should get a TSE minigun. Also a heavy weapons build i do 172 damage per shot.
---
Games like that are few and far between these days....
---
I got the plan for t51b torso from treasure maps. 
---
If I have a fun hour, and it cost me a dollar, I’m good with that. Hell, I paid around $60 back in the 90s for SNES cartridges- that’s probably like $90 in today’s money :)
---
I don't need much ammo to kill scorchbeasts but I now the issues with the loot. Some meet some junk and ever f*cking time a single piece of crap Armour. Exp for lvl 50 beast ~ 350. Exp for lvl 58 glowing ghoul ~ 700. Wtf
---
If you put garage door on a switch or trip pad, it takes a while for it to close, so you can easily trigger it, wait for it to go up just high enough to enter and it will auto close behind you.   Dont need a power on/off switch.
---
Divinity original sin 2 was the closest game too it I've played in years. Well worth checking out if you haven't.
---
Not sure how that would work, but it's an interesting idea!  
---
Great to see that someone is capable of forming valid responses to topics.
---
Yes, but whose fault is it?
---
Or make meat into jerky...
---
This is also to prevent people from doing silly things with perks. While it's rather lazy, it treats every pip-boy opening with the idea that you are moving perks cards, so it fundamentally stalls your AP as a result. So you can't do something shifty with AP realted cards.
---
How about the fact they can also shoot the sonic shit when they turn away from you? Literally they shoot it from any direction. It's more like a mesmetron than an actual vocal attack. Also, they fly like birds not bats. Bats don't glide and have to flap their wings much faster to keep in the air.
---
Oooo I’m just an idiot. I thought the screen was to show you the new cards and the moment that you chose the card was the moment you leveled up in that stat. 
---
Thank you for that 
---
Nah, it seems you didn't thought this one out...
---
It's a bit like an arms race. I just wonder if you get all the best defensive pvp gear, fully modded, will  you still get one shotted? It's something I'm working on. If you do still get one shotted with the best pvp gear and max resists, then I think it doesn't really matter even if you're naked hehe. So you can stop worrying about that and just focus on damage mitigation, like avoiding damage perks, and damage so you can one shot them faster than they can one shot you. Also the game provides some ways to outsmart your opponent. Like you can disappear from  the map while in stealth crouching. You can build a base with traps. You can go invisible with chameleon mutation and armor. You can get a bunch of other mutations that are helpful that increase your speed and jump height. Depending on their weapon you can use different tactics. If they have a shotgun use a rifle etc. I might sound like I have it all figured out but I'm still learning also.
---
You are wondering why people want convenience ? Are you from Earth ?
---
You didn't ask why people are like that though. You said they shouldn't be allowed to be like that. Those are two pretty different things.
---
You are asking to force others to play in a style you see fit, because you think the game should have stronger consequences. Other people don't feel that way. In the current system, both groups can play how they want.
---
I was just getting coffee creamer out of the office fridge, and had the exact same thoughts.
---
Yeah played the series
---
Lvl 65 or higher are better to kill you get ultracite receivers for diff guns , not for sure drop but they can drop em 
---
Ho Lee Chit.  
---
This is a game changer. Currently 4 pieces of my armor are 3\* with reduce weapon  weight 20% (yeah it stacks) but have been passing up some of these effects..
---
Cool thanks, time to get started on my treasure map backlog...
---
It will be theirs from then one.  Until they destroy that piece.
---
First I fought SBs, then I alt-f4ed em, now I fight them back but only because I can finish em off in single magazine and they are silent then.
---
By far, the least appreciated enemy I fought, besides mole-fucking-rats.
---
If this wouldnt be a video game, Id barehandedly make sure that each rat, each mole and each bat have been exterminated.
---
Yea so did I but they didn’t constantly fly around shooting fire every second they can and not take damage from weapons because of bugs
---
My main question is; WHY do people want it so easy?  
---
The system is not designed to create RP-elements at all. Everyone can do everything at any time.
---
I agree with you though. It's easy to see why they did it. Every game makes everything very forgiving these days.
---
Fair enough. Although I disagree that the amount of players is enough for it to qualify as an MMO. 
---
If he attack you first, wait few second, then crouch behind him, and oneshot him with whatever melee weapon with over 100damage.
---
The sonic epilepsy spam is pretty dire as it makes you actively blind and the encounter is not a lot of fun anymore.
---
As far as them not being worth fighting: let them count as a legendary enemy with the associated loot and and be done. 
---
Weapon is ballistic, ammo is energy. The grounded mutation WILL reduce the gauss rifle damage
---
Hey, is bullets in this game actually travel like irl ballistics or it's hitreg?
---
You're not alone. My tse combat shotgun does nothing to the queen. Any other SB it melts but not her. Carry a 1\* two shot to get up close and personal with her. Love playing the shotgun toting maniac.
---
I love my Snowball. They are a great quality at a good price. I would suggest investing in a small swing arm. It's the bee's knees.
---
Yes I did. Read it again. It's about WHY, nothing else. I already know that you want everything to holf your hand. I'll happily help you comprehend the basics of answering "why"-questions.
---
Not every one is a dickhead. Some just don’t realise what the effect of turrets on a CAMP is. 
---
Easy, remove two shot explosive as a combination from the game :)
---
AP meter agreed, but its not why I evolved to the point I am rn in to accept the idea that such an inferior creature has more AP than its reptilian overlord
---
When I find one of these camps, I hang out nearby sniping each ghoul that comes out, letting the turrets finish them off, then grabbing that sweet loot.
---
It is just the worst when you stumble upon a fissure and they just keep spawning.
---
A friend and i were on this mission and stumbled into one. After a lengthy battle and expendeture of munitions, we finally killed it. With only a few seconds to breathe, another popped up...and another.. Killed those two and the next two until we had almost no ammo left. We ended up just running to some cover after the next spawned. It was fun at first but lord one is enough.
---
Also hate that Brotherhood event, protecting the Anti Air turrets. It wasnt too bad at first. But ontop of the scorchbeast blinding me with its sonic attack and blasting away at the turrets. Hordes of scorched were slapping away at myself and the turrets. I couldnt keep up it and failed quickly with the scorchbeast at 30%.
---
I was so mad after dropping the mats on repairs and stims wasted to keep alive. 
---
There is a fine line between fun/challenging boss and annoying bullet sponge. 
---
Bethesda please just reduce the amount of sonic blasts or give me more ways to make it land. Like make the harpoon gun actually anchor it down or something.
---
No problem. Oh and after LVL 50 there'll be a new option when you level up.
---
You either choose a new card, or can move 1 stat point, say from Str to Agi for example. 
---
I’ve seen optimized bracers plans for each. The ultracite jetpack doesn’t exist. I have not seen the shieldings and coatings. I’m unsure, but I don’t believe they are available in the game yet 
---
Mutations have a timer after you get one.   The timer seems quite long, at least longer than 2 hours.
---
It used to be you could server hop after getting one and get another right away.
---
Keep in mind, you have to keep getting radiation until you get the wierded out effect on your character icon.  It pops up when you get to that limit.  From then on, it has chances for mutation.  
---
Also, make certain you do not have Starched Genes equipped when trying to acquire mutation.   Put it back on right after.
---
Now, when I change servers, it seems the timer works as intended and I cannot get mutation as quickly.   I don't server hope, only when I get DC'd or someone took my camping spot.  So if you cannot get one after one attempt, just wait some time (3+ hours) and you might get one after.
---
I mentioned it down below and I guess I'll expand here, you post sounds very much like you are saying they shouldn't be able to do that. Re-reading it, I can see what you were getting at though.
---
That is likely the reason for the specific response from others, and definitely the reason for mine. So sorry, I jumped the gun a little.
---
As to your question. Most people don't want to work hard for something they can get easier somehow else. That's why things like microwaves exist. It's just sort of how it is most times. 
---
How about that endless Ultracite explosive vent Plan! Again and again!
---
I gave an idea of how I want it, yes. Nothing else.
---
Then I asked why it has to be like this. It's a question through the implication that everyone wants everything easy.
---
Nahh never heard back 
---
You're onto something. Having the 15% reduced dmg while standing still and -8% from player attacks would definitely make you a tanky tank. 
---
Drop any and everything relating to power cores. They last a long time as is. I’ve got 11 or so stacked in my camp, and I use PA frequently. Just take 3 50% charge cores with you and you’re good for hours.
---
Rewardless?  The feeling of victory when you finally kill the screetching cancer bat is all the reward I need, as I check up on my destroyed armor, empty ammo supply and broken weapons.
---
&gt; I literally refuse to fight them anymore.
---
Hide in the toilet.  It worked for me once.
---
You can only re-spec after level 50. The game gives you an option to either pick a perk card as normal, or move a SPECIAL point from one attribute to another.
---
I payed full price for tricential edition. Got to play beta and be there for the start. I got no issues with prices dropping but if they make it free to play with pay to win stuff in the Atom shop, i will quit. Cosmetics in the store is fine and i do not care how they price it. If not worth 1800 atoms for a skin, dont buy it.
---
Not saying you are wrong here, this is just how i feel about my purchase.
---
Only once you reach level 50. Each time you level up you can choose either. A new perk. Or move a special point
---
I’m level 52 and can see the option anywhere. 
---
The one you're talking about is in a scorched farmhouse in the NW part of the map. I took a photo of it &amp; now it's one of my load screens :)
---
If it worked, the one that tags all the enemies. Because it will persist after death, making it easier to find bodies.. Apparently people say it's bugged, so I guess the +10% vats accuracy? Or highlighting living target?    
---
And of course the bright headlamp mod is a must as well. 
---
Or you know. Just place Explosive and two shot on the same legendary line of a weapon. Dupped or otherwise, they no longer matter. Then just disable all non-pvp related legendary effects during pvp. Done. No need to do anything other than sit back as duppers now have a bunch of basic bitch weapons that mean fuck all in pvp. 
---
Slightly off topic, but yesterday I saw a plan for "Signs and Lettering" for sale at a vendor... for 11000 caps. I didn't even know plans could go for that kind of price. 
---
Needless to say, I couldn't afford it. 
---
I have like 9 STR because I always start from the left. I am totally not a melee build either haha. I’ll probably end up doin that. 
---
Can agree with that. Even if it was just cosmetic it would diversify characters so much.
---
Reading comprehension on Reddit is atrocious... Thank you for actually taking your time and formulate an intellectual response.
---
Working hard for something and actually taking the consequences from choices gives the game depth. I wish that people would see this.
---
Ive burned a lot of caps buying plans i didnt know i already had :/
---
You can get jerky recipes. But they still have condition the same as others
---
Where is the new suggestion? Lol
---
All current game facts... Nice try boo
---
Honestly, as someone with limited short range options (been replacing guns with explosive variants I loot), Cranberry Bog is a proven nerf in the toolbox against overpowered explosives. 
---
Forget TSE.  If you're running around with an explosive weapon while being chased or strafing and you fall down into a ditch....
---
... There are a lot of paper baggies down there... 
---
wow, the highest level mobs i encountered were the robo brains and the most dangerous thing was the rads when fixing the generator. then i did a silo in a group of three and got my ass handed to me by assaultron dominators
---
Won't work if you switch from a recon weapon. And let's be honest, recon marking isn't incredibly practical in a lot of fights. 
---
I nuked Harpers Ferry because I was tired of whitesprings and Prime.  I was level 80 when I launched it.
---
Antibiotics can reduce disease chance.
---
IIRC most of the devastation from a nuke isn’t a fire ball. It’s the shockwave. So grass would probably survive it fairly well, bending away from the blast. The trees would be gone though, with the blast wave tearing those up. 
---
But don’t quote me on all that, I’m no expert on nuke detonation effects. 
---
It only gives the option to respect when you level up, you should get an option to either pick a perk card, or move a single SPECIAL point per level up.
---
Nvm fixed this problem by going into pipeboy first and opening the holo there first then it showed up in the computer 
---
You can get more caps just by selling them to vendors..
---
A reddit thread once said each chameleon piece gives “20%” and the chameleon mutation gives “99%”.  I don’t know if this is the same as Sneak 3 giving +75%.
---
ONE WORD - GREEN THUMB PERK CARD; YOU'RE WELCOME ; )
---
&gt;  just has them sort of casually start flapping in circles in your direction even if you are completely hidden/chameleon etc,
---
Even if you're [Hidden] you have to keep moving or they'll find you.  If you move away, while staying in cover, then they don't seem to spot you.
---
Assaultron Dominators are no joke at all.  They don't even compare to the normal Assaultrons.
---
I think I got gunned down in about 1.5 seconds at level 90.  They rapid spam the crap out of that white burst light thingy.   (The charging death ray does not even compare to that thing.)
---
Do not pvp attack players because theyre doing what we all have thought about doing. Use your mic or msg a player to get on board with farming without camp turrets. A camp with a decontamination shower arc would be welcomed, Three cheers for that player.
---
Fucking savage.
---
What they said. When you level up the graphic shows a perk card on the left, move a point on the right. 
---
Only 1 line of what you wrote is "why". The other 5 are "This isn't how I like it". I feel it is a fairly easy misinterpretation, even though the point was easy to see once I looked for it.
---
I agree though. I prefer my games to have a little more "meaning". I want to pissed when I come across that hard terminal, but I only invested in lock picking. I want to feel satisfied when my vats build lets me survive a horde, and challenged when it can't do the job against a single big boi boss.
---
A lottttt of people would rather their game just be fun and not have to worry about. My biggest concern is one day the games that let me do it my way, or both ways, will run out. Mass marketing just has to much value lol.
---
i wish i could experience this, my game!starts crashing every time i sprint or open the map.
---
I am at the stage where I get over fight with 3 scorchbeasts in two minutes, I gather meat exclusively in glassed cavern, and yet I still think that for the sake of human sanity F76 season1 should and those damned bats should end with it.
---
I mean its not like the Queen is alive by this point.
---
Please SB. Cease to fucking exist.
---
yeah, and the fucking stealth blades slice through you like a hot knife through butter. i for one wouldnt mind a nerf to them
---
What i'm not really sure about is how SPECIAL budget applies. Cards from all three decks count against decks SPECIAL maximum.
---
Or Maybe S+P+A is combat budget, I+C is crafting and E+L is QoL...
---
Cards values would have tobe rebalanced anyway. Some need to be merged, other rethought.
---
You CAN actually find 15 cores, even if it's a bit difficult, if you somehow can't manage to repair them.  
---
If you are on PC, I'll join you and get you through quickly, takes just a few min (unless i get lost, which happens often:D)
---
Server hoping will not refresh caps.   Only time will refresh the caps.
---
Go to the different faction vendors to change the pool.
---
Just like balistic damage they get affected by weapot type perks (non automatic rifles, automatic rifles, guns, heavy weapons etc)
---
haha nice
---
You guys do realize turret killed enemies are lootable to everyone because it is an environment kill and not a player kill, that’s literally the whole reason why i set my base there, everyone gets to loot the corpses.
---
Get yoself a better spot
---
Dude, the only worthy energy weapon in this game is the gauss rifle. 
---
As for the cards that affect this types of weapons, they're in the intelligence tree.
---
Sentinel and lone wanderer stacks to make for some extreme damage resistance. You can become allmost unkillable if you work hard enough on your gear, also from TSE weapons. 
---
So you consider FO76 as a Massively Multiplayer Online game ?
---
No, it’s me with chameleon armor glitch
---
Generally whichever applies.
---
Heavy perks for the gatlings/cryolator. Commando for auto laser/plasma, Gunslinger for pistol variants. Rifleman for semi-autos.
---
Not sure on the Tesla rifle though. And I know some of them are bugged (Tank Killer for rifles for instance doesn't work with energy)
---
Hell, if we just had a list of learned plans somewhere I could just screenshot it and have it on the side. I'd love the ui to gray out learned stuff but it might not be feasible to implement for whatever reason.
---
Everything is duped now. "This dude is stronger than me, he must be a dupper".
---
Has there been anything besides people spreading rumors that would warrant a disclaimer? 
---
i approve of this idea, all of my armour is broken because of scorchbeasts and i can go anywhere without being blinded by their sonic screech attack
---
Pipe weapons are fucking beastly though! Lol
---
I’ll have to have a look again, I’ve got 5 level up points to spend. Would I give me the option with them or only when I first earn the level up? 
---
It was outside in the mire, I did not even see what killed me much less get close enough for melee.
---
Worth noting that the refresh is also 20-22 hours so you don't need to wait a full day, but can schedule your daily shop loop with relative ease and flexibility.
---
TSE are not overpowered. I’m tired of this narrative being painted. Melee weapon builds can hit 2k-3k damage.
---
TSE just made Guns a viable option build. Only thing TSE has over Melee is range.
---
Now there is an expoilt with magazines and bobbles that can make weapons hit millions of damage but it can be done with Guns and Melee. That is why some people get one shot in PvP without being in PVP. Because it breaks the PvP Formula. I wrote a post about it. I will edit and add it later.
---
People complain about TSE because they are the symbol of duping.. Bethesda’s working on fixing duping but it a lot harder to fix then the public knows. Secondly Bethesda isn’t going to wipe Inventories. They can’t afford to because they would lose to much player base.
---
Also better and higher level Legendaries and level guns are coming in the next 6 months so the TSE will not be important in the future.
---
Im now reworking my whitesprings camp to incorporate that. Not to be a dick, I already placed in in enough distance that it doesnt trigger the building. I see its blown up nevertheless, but seeing how cool it bugged I keep ot there. It had fusion power generator that someone must have bombed, now its gone and completely removed from map, but it stilk provides 100 power (i.e. my turrets say they need power, but they shoot anyway)
---
[You can push it quite a bit further.](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/bobotheburner/screenshot/11074291) 
---
I've always felt switching perk cards is very similar to swapping gear in previous games. FO3 I always carried Reilly's armour (small guns boost) and Lag Bolts armour (,big guns). In NV I always had mobius scrubs (added points to science, charisma and intelligence, Generals uniform (15 to speech) and the courier's duster which boosted carry wieght. There are many examples in both games that players would swap on the fly. 
---
Action boy/girl and lone wanderer don't stack.
---
Yeah because most explosive two shot shit is, it’s not about being better. It’s about the fact these weapons have oversaturated and ruined the game’s balance. 
---
People buy it.. You'd be surprised..
---
Your idea is not popular. I understand where you're coming from and don't agree with you.
---
There are much more interesting places to build camps anyway! Get creative ppl
---
If you are using an old version of the perk loadout mod, you may need to update it.
---
Noone is stopping a random PA user to just pain his armor whatever he feels like though.. Lore or not..
---
This true but level 50 Scorch beast have a chance to also.
---
Unless the game decides otherwise, which it usually does.
---
I have on a number of occasions found pieces on the set in the power armor station in the outside area within the fort where you turn in the technical data for the Enclave. 
---
Guy with high caliber, high rate of fire, crew supported, vehicle mounted, military grade armament, or dude with a board that has some nails in it.
---
Dude with a board wins. Welcome to Fallout 76.
---
Ty for input. I'm only level 17 but I like to set goals early in games like this.
---
I think they'll start with the vaults. 
---
Also the Overseers mission doesnt exactly concludes, so im hoping for developments in the main story as well.
---
Also, and i can see the downvotes coming, this game should already have dlc available after you reach level 50. But Bethesda is to busy screwing up and fixing stuff that should be already working when the game came out. 
---
There are already a lot of players with more or less nothing to do besides farming, launching nukes and griefing. 
---
When I started I built my camp there cause it felt safe.
---
Try in the asylum
---
Level 4 once you do the brotherhood quests
---
I got small letters and the barn set from workshops today :D
---
if they get close enough, 1- 2 hits and you are dead, buddy.
---
Its bad honestly, it gives 6 str, but perk does not increase duration...still 2 min, they need to buff duration with perk
---
Hey, if you want to go back, I’m game. I need to go in there for both this quest and the Rose one. 
---
Adding you right now. PSN is iLScopezLi
---
I have never dropped a nuke myself so I use that long 2 min warning to get a good viewing spot haha 
---
Central plaza in watoga, near the fallen vertibid. All military camps around cranberry bog and the mire.
---
Chuck it in the fuck it bucket 
---
I don't think that is something they can implement in a patch without having a massive backlash.
---
If it was like that from release I would've liked, it would add a bit of planning to characters, really dislike swapping cards as needed so I just don't do it, I know that hinders the strength of my character but whatever.
---
i added you too
---
Heal people, WITH NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS:D
---
Nice, Inman Comics? My stepfather's last name was Inman, same with my youngest brother. It's always wierd to see that name. 
---
Technically it's Commy to share. So they're being patriotic capitalist greedy bastards!
---
killing "higher" tier monsters nets the most.
---
so for level18 i'd say (if you can handle),  Eastern Regional Penitentiary (just SE from Grafton) is probably the best. Although this place is literally a maze, it's just crawling with supermutants around level 15-25. Outside and inside, there's probably 30-40 of them.
---
And grounded is still bugged and unaffected by class freak, for the record. Sigh.
---
Gunshots are echoing in the distance, a Nuke is going off at the Whitesprings, the Fusion Generator is whirring upstairs, three Water Purifiers are churning, Vertibots are chopping overhead, a Ghoul Officer is beeping nearby, mutated chickens are clucking on the porch, a Scorch Beast is flapping through the air dangerously close, two Rad Stags are stomping around on the roof, the metal walls are creaking and I'm banging away at the Armor Workbench -- but at least my door opens silently! Ah, the tranquility..... (=
---
The loot loot could be better, though they'd probably have to alter the spawning or people would just sit on the fissure sites because those SOB's basically pop a new one the second you kill the old one.
---
The actual Scorchbeast parts are pretty solid bits of healing and other stuff food wise. Also the wings make ballistic fiber IIRC along with Ultracite from the bones.
---
Fighting them is of course a pain in the ass. They often seem to have some extra resistance and bizarre anti-VATS power in the air (even if you're 10 feet under a flying one, its often sub-50% with 15 perception). 
---
Almost antithetically to logic and what the game itself tells you, fighting them out in the open is the best bet. You're able to track it better, less stuff for the sonic booms to hit and explode next to you for splash damage, and better maneuverability to avoid the acid crop dusting. along with more space for the thing to land so its AI will maybe decide to actually do so.
---
Ty 
---
Ty 😁
---
Its like the bleeding shotgun of fallout 4. Couple of shots and anything dies. Just makes it too easy. I havent played the game now for 2 weeks as got bored. 
---
No problem! We can play whenever. 
---
There is a yaoi guai recipe that increase melee by 15% although I usually just use glowing meat at 10% boost.
---
And Frank horrigan 
---
Should also mention I don't have a mic.
---
do you have a mic?
---
I made a video covering just this topic that you might find useful if you are more of a visual person.  Here you go and hope this helps!
---
[https://youtu.be/1Y4CDx56FRs](https://youtu.be/1Y4CDx56FRs)
---
Exactly
---
I was really enjoying myself until now. Probably not going to pick up the game again for a long time, until they do something about explosive two shot weapons and duping. 
---
Only if the harpoon gun had a way to anchor you to the ground ;-) 
---
Otherwise it would be the scorchbeast who yanked you *off* the ground... which I'm sure would impress the newbies, but for different reasons. 
---
Vendors in different factions have a different pool.
---
There's 6 factions IIRC (annotated cause spoilers, R, R2, W, F, B, E) plus at least one independent (G).
---
Buying stuff also does refill 30% or so of the paid amount. Although thats if you're trying to clean out stuff, obviously spending 3x the amount you're refreshing doesn't net you more caps.
---
I'll help too! I'm level 177 and VERY bored lol
---
CoD and BlOps 4 can’t be DDoSed by simply playing the game as far as I’m aware. And the scotch comparison is just laughable, Fallout 76 would be a glass full of barley.
---
IT IS THE BANEBLAADE
---
I had two attack me for the defence mission at the ammo factory.  A defence mission,  at s place I've gone to, because I'm low on fucking ammo
---
Start a new character........
---
And VATS hits on their head and wings cannot hit.
---
Tell me about it.... 😭
---
I'm at a point where I sometimes even miss that effing tin-can soldier, waddling around in his clinking effing power armor...
---
And that totally annoying woman of a reporter who's shit in combat and only gives me junk food every once in a while.
---
I'd be happy to just tag along with someone, carry their stuff around and all that shit companions used to do 🙄 I can even be useless in combat and make annoying comments....... 
---
I see it here all the time [http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Emmett\_Mountain\_disposal\_site](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/f/fb/Emmett_Mountain_Disposal_Site_map.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20181109235646)
---
Also at the house across from the Ammo Depot, Sons of something ..  downstairs in the basement. You need a level 3 lock pick or hack the terminal upstairs in the bedroom
---
Unfortunately no I don't but I am getting one, I'm actually already playing with someone but still could use another vault dweller 😁 
---
yup, end game grind time. But it's not as bad as people make it out to be. Between, PA stuff, CAMP stuff, weapons and armor, mutations and general shit you want. There is plenty to go after. You can also make your own fun as well.
---
Watoga central place and Watoga comubnity Roof 
---
youre playing with me 😂
---
plus, they have way too much health

With the duping it just makes it pointless. You dont want to trade with anyone incase its a duped weapon. Its not clear what they are going to do with dupes, they could all be removed, so you end up loosing everything.  I will probably come back after some more patching. Just playing switch with the wife for the time being, on the plus side our relationship is better. Hahahhaa
---
Interim suggestion: Make a list of plans/recipes as you buy them. Lucky I encountered this issue at earlier levels, so I made a new fresh character and keep track from first purchase.
---
In my own experience, I seem to crash way more when I have 1-3 workshops, especially when fast traveling to them.
---
The same thing happened to me... I just switched servers a few times and that solved the problem. 
---
I never realized it was all so complex!
---
This is so amazing 
---
I think sometimes when people log off wearing power armor there's a bug that leaves behind an empty frame. And sometimes when people find the PA spawns  they take the pieces and fusion core and leave the frame behind. Those are 2 reasons for empty frames being left around the place. Also one more reason. Some higher levels leave them for lower levels as they give you strength and defenses.
---
It's because they have a superiority complex and must speak d^o^^w^^^n to everyone
---
Where is this location? 
---
We are patriots. Kill those commie bastages. 
---
You need to spend exactly  50 points first before the option may appear
---
Now if only I could get his sick ass 50 cal service rifle!
---
Lol all these downvotes for stating the truth. So many blind followers in this shitty sub.
---
I did this once, but luckily I loaded quick enough to drop Power Armor and get in before I died, had like 5 HP left, then I was scrambling to find my Radaway.
---
They can actually drop prime receiver and various grenades plans, but the % is tiny.
---
They probably share the same loot table with the queen, but with a super reduced drop chance.
---
Plastic is more valueable than acid IMO.  But my camp sits on acid deposit.
---
Pretty sure the Skyrim dragons also landed a couple of times too so you could get some reasonable shots in. Scorch beasts are so frustratingly erratic. I end up noping out of there when I see one. Total waste of resources trying to bring one down. 
---
Solution: Give us Dragonrend!!
---
&gt;For those looking.  If you are standing between the Golf Club and Tennis Courts looking back towards Resort direction....Go left of the Tennis court and it will be just past the tennis court on the left.  It looks like this https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/amber-71-stars/screenshot/11233460  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;There is a short concrete wall surrounding outside the gazebo....the water fountain is on that wall....on the tennis court side of the gazebo.  It looks like this https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/amber-71-stars/screenshot/11233461  
---
&gt;A level 92 Glowing Deathclaw came by when we visited.  Low levels dont worry though because you can stand inside the gazebo where it cant access you and you can shoot it.
---
/u/gabbysky this post
---
Bwuahahahah
---
Really i have 420 hours in fo76 and you didnt realize it was that complex? Its kinda like 7 days to die.
---
You're in an internet troll.
---
Its all you will ever be.
---
What I mean is imagine comparing everything to your most favourite game and saying it's gobshite, not everything is that game.   
---
And actually people have reported of DDoSing in Bo4 "just for playing the game" given most gameplay is online (the 'story' is that short)
---
Until you are trying to get all the Combat Armor mods.... then plastic is no where to be found!
---
The whole perk cards system is designed around swapping them. if not the plethora of cards given to players doesn't make any sense.
---
I don't know what console on your on but if your on pc i can help. We have a mod called Perk Manager that lets you swap up your loadouts on the fly. Go to Camp boom camp loadout. Need to shoot boom range build. Need to swing that melee boom melee loadout.
---
All interface mods are allowed and i find this one and text chat mod to be massive QOL mods.
---
Hope that helps OP its on the nexus just search by most popular and its number 1 downloaded.
---
Indeed! I met 3, FUCKING THREE of the fuckers, during the **main** mission. All of them lvl 50, no other players nearby. I was lvl 32, the fuck am I supposed to do??? I managed only 'cause I had 3 stealthboys with me. The game even crashed after a bit, so I'm not sure it's even done, since I've had quest rollbacks on this particular quest everytime I logged. All my weapons, including a .50 machine gun and a rocket launcher, was like mosquito bites, and this is after they supposedly fixed the health/dmg bug on auto weapons.
---
 nice, this exploiter even streams on twitch... 
---
There was a quest I did in Watoga, don't remember the name, that had me clear the roof of a building. Nothing but Colonel Gutsys.. Luckily though a scorchbeast spawned and started attacking them while I hid in the lift. I only had to kill one Col. Gutsy that was down to 20% life. 
---
I think that was the only time so far I was delighted to see a scorchbeast. 
---
I've read that you can't save them up that way.
---
I quit doing workshops because of the DCs. I waste my 25 caps then the junk to build everything. I get halfway through the first defend event and get DCd. 
---
I’m built on the side of a mountain and every time a friend fast travels it drops them off the side of the mountain before the base loads in. Makes for great fun. I have a fast travel mat
---
The attack is definitely the killer for me. Luckily there's a mod for that! Makes the rings alot smaller and less distortion around them too. 
---
Yup.  I did the other day and it's 150 caps.  It was weak too, didn't even destroy the roof.
---
Yeah probably the best answer for it 
---
The Emperor Protects 
---
Great idea
---
They are bats, they have sonar, they hear you not see you.
---
Just run through the Whitespring spawn points, drop off server, log back on, you'll go from 47 to 50 within 15 minutes doing that solo
---
I should add i agree with you always thought perks should only be changed per level if you want. We should not be jack of all trades. But until they change it up that mod is king.
---
Oh no. Some chud is in my history.
---
Didnt even realize that was a lawnmower man quote.
---
Probably not even born yet.
---
Youmadbro?
---
You have to kill the spawns btw, not literally just run through them lol :-)
---
Would you mind sharing location of said cave?
---
Really? I have 6868 hours. How many have you?
---
Lol thisboi madbro
---
Chainsaw, properly modded, properly conditioned and preparred, is a not even a weapon, its a transportation device. It gets you alts from level 20 to 50 in 3h of riding it over ghouls faces.
---
I guess but some people hit lvl 50 in the beta already and some games released before F76 is just now getting their first dlc’s. I understand your point was that the endgsme is dull, but it still doesn’t mean that the dlc’s should be there already, it means that there should be more endgame content. 
---
Rofl, ‘Be thankful they give you any free currency at all’. Could that corporate boot be testing any harder on your neck?
---
Probably due exploitation since I guess you could use them to reach prohibited areas. They removed them during beta. 
---
Or keeping a mod for when you get enough springs to build that remaining leg for the X01...
---
I mean, who's idea was it to make a boss that you can't really use melee on?
---
But, wait!
---
Due to it's bullshit blinding^^? screams, gun users can't fight it either
---
Thanos would be proud.

Until they give us true backpacks you can wear an outfit that has one:

I actually keep finding T60 calibrated shocks, never for any other PA.

eu servers? I can join you

Watonga. Go to the Municipal building take the elevator up to the first floor, run past scorched, to the door to the mayors office. Take the elevator to the roof. Immediately turn left around the corner, Jump off to the roof and onto the Medical center roof next door. There is a chance for power armor to spawn on that roof. t-60, or t51. Jump off the medical building roof to a platform then again down to the street, look straight ahead and take the fire escape to the left up to the roof of the buildings across from the medical build. There you'll see a verti-bird parked on the adjacent roof from the fire escape, next to it another power armor can spawn. Check it. then continue on jump off that roof down to street level, near the crashed Virti-bird in the center of town, where another power armor frame can spawn. Then server hop, and you'll spawn directly in front of the Municipal center as it was the last place you visited. repeat and you should have t51 in about 5 minutes or so. All three spawn t60 and t51, 45 and lvl 50. Yes, I farmed lvl 50 t51 pa. this is the best run to do it. no enemies really, no fuss no muss.
---
see if you can add me
---
Happened to us to in same place. 4 of us on team can confirm. I was like how the heck is it...oh never mind. Lol. 
---
Yes, it's logoff leftovers from people in PA
---
In fact all over cranberry bog.
---
K little bit later
---
My personal CAMP bugbear is having to use foundations for the entire floor. FO4 let you put a foundation in each corner, say, and then link with “floor” pieces. 
---
Would be ideal to build over the CAMP thing and route power beneath the flooring, or straddle water to hide purifiers etc. 
---
Little bit later, in 2-3 hrs
---
You take out a wing and it lands. In skyrim there was no “vats” or limb damage so something like Dragonrend was needed in order to ground one. Fallout has given people a way to make them land and a means in which to do it. 
---
make the run between fort venture and the nearby Red Rocket, two relatively close spawns.
---
Ill craft you one for free on xbox pass your tag
---
*should have figured
---
And yes, you should have. The misguided TSE hate is getting old. 
---
Yes and No at the same time.  Benefits from both rifleman and Batteries included perks.
---
There it is.   
---
That cuck sold us Skyrim AGAIN
---
This lad is correct let me Back it up.
---
TSE is top duped weapons but its not them themselves that are the issue your talking about. Its the dupers stacking duped bobbles to hit crazy numbers. On my post third picture you will see why its such an isssue.
---
What level or SPECIAL level does Super Duper start to appear as a perk option? I’m 22 and not seen it yet. 
---
Haven’t seen this thread before.
---
Oh so you’re one of those people? Think you’re all high and mighty correcting grammar. Jesus you people are some the worst fans I’ve ever seen. You’re like dogs. You rip apart anyone who disagrees with any opinion you have about this game. Enjoy the game fella. I’m done wasting hours of my life I’ll never get back.
---
nah just wipe everyone
---
I’m sure you haven’t 
---
its a punishment for continuously dying in pvp, if you die enough times to the point you have zero caps, the game trys you persuade away from pvp for awhile so you can get some caps back, and using all your caps at a vendor doesnt accrue this effect 
---
Really? I have 789999 hours in Skyrim. How many have you?
---
They only respawn when new people show up.  
---
I don't understand how we're still at the point where people don't know how to cripple limbs.
---
You get, or do? Is this anti griefer mechanic?
---
It's so you won't abuse being wanted with 0 caps.
---
Ghouls? I think you mean *POXWALKERS.*  
---
Super mutants? I think you mean *KHORNATE CULTISTS*
---
Actually you dont even need the flux for a plan either.   I learned the excavator mob that required flux.  I keep delaying making it because required 5 flux.  But it was highlighted as if I could make. I checked my existing mods and I am certain I did not have that mod.
---
So I crafted it just fine.  Checked all my other fluxes and they were intact.   I checked my mods and none were used.  (Thought 1 was misnamed or something).   I am not sure it actually enforces the check for the flux when crafting.  (PA Mod)
---
The reason you use dragon-rend is because a majority of weapons are close range and bows are too slow. In Fallout you have fully automatic long range weapons so it's completely justified, honestly they're really not that difficult to fight when you know what to do.

The -50% damage is for everything I guess too and it’s 4 hours of ingame time as well
---
Hmmm that sounds hard. 
---
I like your setting a limit idea... but I'd want it to simply add or remove tracking of that component based on if I'm under the limit. 
---
1. Equip perk card
---
2. Drop your shit into the stash
---
3. remove perk card
---
4. ???
---
5. Profit!
---
They can't even fucking sort by condition. What makes you think they could incorporate this?
---
I came back from a walk today to see someone checking out my house and a little kid in the background went, gee that's a nice house daddy.  I was so chuffed,  as I had spent all day getting the last few plans I needed.  I wanted to give him plans so he could have a nice house too, but I had just returned from wandering the highway giving plans away to people I met.  I over repaired a level 20 legendary shotgun and gave it to him instead, then took him to see my dog.  These moments for me are the best.
---
ice had the effect before, its only for players

"Why" should only be needed one time.

The build is a basic way of presenting.

1 Idea  
---
2 Observation  
---
3 Question  
---
4 Challenge state of mind  
---
Anyway, we seem to agree somewhat on that games are catered to the grey masses.
---
you get it when you lose all your caps in pvp
---
Well that’s the thing I wasn’t griefing I was just pvping with my friends now I got this fucking nightmare
---
or too collect some caps before you go back to pvp
---
Well still gay because I was just pvping with my friends
---
I was just pvping with my friends though now I have this bullshit for 4 hours of ingame play
---
In my experience, crippling a wing in VATS brings them straight down. 
---
Ahh still gay since I was just pvping with friends tho
---
I know two Forrest Raider PA spots:
---
- Gorge Junkyard (in a locked container)
---
- Point Lookout (between dry lake and Whitesprings)
---
As long as you got the caps you’re clear, but if you go broke you’re you’re just hurting yourself lol
---
&lt;a href='http://i.imgur.com/HmteZln' title=''&gt;&lt;img src='http://i.imgur.com/HmteZln.jpg' alt='' title='Hosted by imgur.com' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
---
it doesnt discriminate, lose all your caps in pvp and you do half damage to players. just stay away from pvp until its gone
---
Just FYI the accuracy on it will be terrible. I got one also and I thought getting the long barrel would improve the accuracy but it doesnt, it just doubles the range, lame.
---
I don't have an explosive, but they're still easy for me. Maxed skeet shooter, better criticals and enforcer. 
---
There is an easy fix.. Bethesda just needs to make it where you can have only 1 bobblehead and 1 Magazine active at a time.
---
The server issues are because of people with million of LBS of Inventory and duping.
---
Did it in five minutes - I think you may be my hero. 
---
There is no Fast Travel Mat for CAMPs, only workshops.
---
The mat for CAMPS is cosmetic only.
---
its only against player, so you should be fine
---
Still gay lol
---
Theres a point where you get gud and they become mere pebbles in your path. Keep an AP weapon.
---
dude, it only deducts damage against players
---
and the Scorchbeasts music is no where near as Epic as the Dragon attack music from Skyrim 
---
Indeed they also need to fix the issue with the logging out and in resetting the timers. Because to fully clear up those who currently have 1000s on they need to make it so the timer wears off and does not reset each time you log in and out.
---
They only need to nerf the TSE shotgun so all pallets count as just one explosion with the damage split between them.
---
Here are three locations: https://imgur.com/a/z2fckkR
---
Still gay tho
---
I agree..
---
They need to make it where crippling the wings is more effective, like with explosive weapons. Say for example 2-3 hits from a homing missile launcher should force the beast to land.
---
Damn dude. Do you even pay attention to the sub?
---
Its when people teleport in PA
---
Use Dragonrend. They’ll be forced to land until it wears off /s
---
Thank you thank you thank you - took five minutes and it’s so much smoother. 
---
Eh... Some of the bugs have been ironed out.
---
However due to the Duping, the servers have been laggy and DC you a lot now.
---
There are less people on the servers I have noticed, probably because running out of content at the higher levels (quests all finished).
---
I would not call it a prime time to return just yet.  Wait until the next patch comes out first with the player vending machines.
---
k
---
So you are angry because you can't abuse the system of avoiding to pay bounties for your wanted level.
---
Are you joking? Is this guy joking?
---
TSE has far higher damage, range, speed and unlike melee, doesn't require shit in terms of effort or build.
---
Most people can't do shit with your "melee" build because it requires a fuck tonne of drugs, 10% HP and 900 rads and is a glass cannon. 
---
This is not true of TSE weapons, which have higher damage regardless of anything else. 
---
For example - my highest total damage build which works in most situations has a tiny range, practically no armour and can be killed with one blast from a Scorchbeast. 
---
I think you're just straight up being dishonest; the TSE, even E alone, is so absurdly overpowered it should just be stripped from the game and replaced with "Unbreakable"
---
[cave](http://imgur.com/5xk536W) 
---
It has a top to it on the left side of the bottom cave. It’s big inside and a hole that leads to the lower cave . 
---
I was pvping with friends
---
I so totally agree with you and the OP. I almost couldn't be bothered to fight them now because that's all it is, a bother. There isn't any tactic to it. Stand and trade continuous heavy weapons fire into then, if they land then light then up. Once it's over I have no feeling of accomplishment and no feeling of superiority like I now have with every other enemy.
---
I'd happily trade all my guns for a 120mm APFSDS cannon that one shots SBs. 
---
It's the most expensive one, lvl 3 bargin perk and some grape mentats brings it close to 9k
---
They need to be nerfed or made peaceful to players below level 50. This is a good idea but only if you want to kill them, I have no way of killing one atm so I have to server hop everytime I get harassed and it's starting to get old
---
I'll ask my ~~Canadian~~ Australian girlfriend that totally exists.
---
I'm xbox and I'll take you up on the shocks!
---
Doesnt matter. They dupe nukas for caps anyway.
---
The 90's called... it wants it's slurr back
---
Buffout, a death tambo and zero junk to lose, I got that quest done by level 50.
---
exactly, dont pvp if you cant afford too
---
&gt;What if you were locked into your stat blocks, and can only move one point at a time, making it impossible to switch it up on the fly? :o
---
There it is. I might have misunderstood your point.  
---
I guess now that you mean the respec as it is with the S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats? Are you trying to make a point in that we are already locked into some sort of system that requires work to change?   
---
I'd love to discuss the point of you first comment, but since you seem like a person that prefers condescending rhetorics, I'll pass.
---
Huh, i didn't realize there was actually a Vault 51 in the lore, i was just thinking it could be a good reference to Area 51.  like exposing vault dwellers to alien technology.
---
It's a mutant bat the size of a small car, not a dragon
---
thats creepy you know where else she lives...
---
Then those friends are assholes if they took your money without leting you get a free kill to earn them back.
---
I gave this game a break for the past month. Just came back to this subreddit and I'm both glad discussions like these are going on, and both sad that BGS isn't addressing this. 
---
Take my upvote, for whatever that may be worth.
---
I once fought.. 3 or 4 Scorchbeasts at the same time.. inside a cave. They were flying through the roofs and walls.. the server was having issues coping with it, it stabilised once I finally killed all of them.
---
It's that last cave in the bottom right of the map. I gained 50+ levels in less than an hour probably, because scorched 60+ would also spawn infinitely. I had to leave the bugged cave eventually because my big pile of equipment I brought broke.
---
It was kinda fun but it did show me how broken the game is. Not that I hadn't noticed that prior to this, but I was just laughing to myself thinking 'Haha this game, man'
---
They should all be switched from Explosive to Unbreakable.
---
That's the only way I see to keep them worthwhile - no repairs needed.
---
Nope, it sort of sucks. You can't get any of the nuke stuff from non-organic enemies (hardened mass and glowing mass) and when I was there it spawned a few ghouls and that was it. Disappointing, prime fissure have more flux and whitesprings more enemies. 
---
We gave our caps back after we wrote down how many we had before starting
---
What slurr?
---
Sssh don't advertise the spot ;)
---
I was in the same situation, have you made sure to learn the plan you get before doing the event? I got it on the third run when I did that
---
I love this you may not like it but i hunt griefers alot and these lads wrack up bounties into the 1000s. They are scum of the earth that get their kicks wrecking peoples bases.
---
For every 100 caps they don't have they get to enjoy i believe an hour of minus 50% damage. I don't get mad when they can't pay me the caps. Because i know justice is served regardless.
---
They aren't difficult though. Stand and spam 5mm at them. Currently 5mm TSE but previously 5mm +30% against animals and +30% against scorched. No idea if either of those help but basically *throw lead*.  That isn't difficult just time consuming. With Ammo aster and Super Duper making ammo is easy. 
---
I think it’s a great thing for griefers but the thing is I was just pvping my friends :/
---
Its in your quest mods.  Not the normal area.
---
Can't you lads use that hunt / hunter pvp mode?.
---
Super Mutants are **really** annoying but perhaps if there's a real person behind the Mutant it might stop repeating the **dumbest** anti human stupid propaganda that will never happen ever. So your idea is good as long as you stop with the stupid voice lines that bethesda have made them say!
---
Nice. I don't recall ever finding anything useful.
---
I have a couple of Ultracite recipes and receivers but I don't recall finding them and going HA SWEET LOOT! 
---
Video or it didnt happen.
---
I asked her and she immediately started singing it 
---
No they are not. Most TSE besides shotguns only hit for like 400 Damage a bullet. The Dragon,Lever and Gauss hit higher around 800-1200 Damage. Shotguns do way more Damage cause each pellet becomes explosive.
---
I think you are not fully educated or know your facts. With just Melee perk cards equipped with no mutations or buffs. I can get 800 Damage. So 800 Damage vs 400 Damage TSE? Guns are ranged and should be melee at range. That is just straight facts. Just like Melee will destroy up close. That’s the way it should be.
---
They're community managers, their job isn't to decide which ideas and fixes get priority, it's to understand community sentiment and pass that feedback along to the devs. 
---
They'll say stuff like "passed this along to the devs" or "Devs know about this and a fix is in the works" because that's all they can say - features get cut, some things get delayed, some things just aren't a high priority, and some things are under NDA. People don't really react well to being told any of those things, and they don't really need to be told those things for actual game updates to happen. Then there's the lovely game of telephone the internet loves to play any time an official comment is slightly ambiguous. Overall it's better to consolidate actual news into an official post, like their weekly Inside the Vault stuff, instead of trying to reply to every thread on a subreddit 90% of the playerbase doesn't even use. 
---
Some of those caves are pretty extensive. I often get lost in them.
---
Tip: Do not go into caves overweight, you risk getting trapped forever (unless you drop stuff you want to keep)
---
We tried some weird mode but well as you can see it didn’t work lol
---
Er.. why go through that trouble?  Diluted Rax-X stacks with Diluted Rad-x and you keep your mutation effects...
---
I don't think it shows up until the later 40's and it's in Luck. 
---
What you meant to say is diluted rad-x stacks with itself and allows for your mutations to still function as well.  So you can pop 10 diluted rad-x.
---
Rad Shield is too hard to make with those flowers.  Just pop 10 Diluted Rad-x and your fine.
---
The irony is that the OP is actually pushing a commie angle.
---
Yep it's from Fallout 4, a lot of the Fallout 76 enemies are ported from Fallout 4, the Alien is in the files and it's that type of alien the alien challenge refers to.
---
Hmmm well Torq we get a inside the vault tomorrow. They said they have a new pvp mode comming that sounds very close to a pvp server type deal. So i am guessing bounties won't be a thing on that side. It will be a stand off style pvp server.
---
TSE with any boosting perks for the TSE.
---
Yup learned any plans that have been given and it still won’t give it to me last one it gave me was the stupid baseball bat plan
---
Nope, the Alien is a different challenge, it hasn't been encountered yet so it may be DLC.
---
It used to appear from a sewer pipe near my camp in the Forest all the fricking time, albeit in a less than legendary form.
---
All I saw was this great tentacle-like thing whipping about in the undergrowth and it gave me a heart attack *every gorramn time*.
---
It should at least drop lots and lots of meat or... OH! maybe foot longs!
---
Where did I even mention dupers? 
---
Well that’ll be nice
---
Yeah that too.. They all stack! With themselves, other stuff, etc.. But it doesnt matter as much with the "hidden" benefit PA gives in nuke zones..
---
I agree. I can easily kill multiple scorcheasts in single ecnounter (as many other people here)  
---
But its just waste of time as I regulary get like 1\* armors or straight up nothing :D :D
---
The only endgame now is nuking whitesprings and hoping u managed to tag as many as possible  
---
Auto weapons are actually better with the Furious ability.
---
It is.
---
The junk pile is great. I'd not realised how valuable they are. I pull a lot of useful stuff out of there. And it's been scorchbeast free so far (fingers crossed).
---
Odd. For me a higher level player built me the generator but when I moved my camp I couldn’t place it. So put a post up to buy one and someone pointed Powering Up Poseidon, did it once, got large generator, learned the plan, server hopped, repeated for windmill, same again and hot it
---
All my best legos was from watoga bots, you can farm then without nuke, run around the city - kill 2-4 legendary, then relog. Whitespring best for exp, by gives SHIT loot everytime
---
I am aware of that, yes.
---
I was actually really pleased to discover they were. Great tunes. My daughter now listens to the FO4 playlist all the time.
---
Why on earth would you ever pay for black titanium.  just go to \*any\* of those mining sites and shoot the moleminers and scrap their suits.  Get tons of that really quick.
---
Pete Hines is happy, healthy, and alive
---
As a former asshole, as long as you are in render distance mobs still drop loot. I use to put turrets outside the widows of the clubhouse then run in when everything was dead. I was low level then, now that i have my build i dont need help anymore.
---
nope, just lotsa people with lotsa guns and no food
---
Perhaps I should eat some soap, froth my mouth up, and try suing Bethesda for giving me an epileptic fit or something.
---
Just follow the quests and do all you can. 
---
Dont farm nuke sites.  You will hurt yourself as you will outlevel the quests and miss out on them.
---
Just enjoy the quests.
---
I toss a bunch of grenades, usually hits them all.
---
Nice man, thanks
---
This is why I have my camp right beside one of the Surface to Air sites.
---
Doesn’t count cyber Monday
---
I think I’ve yelled this exact paragraph to my party after getting kicked from the server... but you know... with more expletives 
---
Imagine comparing everything to your most favourite game. Some of those things will be shit regardless. Would the same awful logic apply for why Big Rigs Racing is actually a hidden gem? Or would people seem less insane for using that logic to defend a game like Aliens: Colonial Marines?
---
Regarding the fast travel part, I have only fast travelled when I played with someone, and usually it would only be at the start of our run.
---
For weapons, I dunno, with the perks available for it and how abundant crafting benches are, I haven't had an issue in a "regular" session of my weapons/armor breaking, sure if I ended up in a nuke zone then that possibility could exist, but I usually get full repairs before entering those. 
---
I had one today on PS4 but it was like the second this week? Early on it was multiple times a day so that’s better but not perfect 
---
They left that up to break it early test application!
---
I did it and still not working
---
No i do not have any spare caps for your wall!! 
---
Sorry... I know your probably specced for Shotguns.  Just though bloodied would be better for Shotguns really.
---
But thats my goal is to get a furious Handmade and swap my non-auto perks toward auto with high crit.
---
I know I can be more efficient going with auto-pistol perks because I am in armor and not power armor, thus have high agility for the defense.
---
I just like the handmade. &lt;shrug&gt; so will try for 3 strength, 9 agility and 15 luck build.   I will probably augment the agility with +agility gear as I find it.
---
Again was just pvping with friends so I shouldn’t of had to worry about getting this
---
It’s all bugged, I’ve quit playing and went back to FO4
---
Mob farming gets boring, end-game is lacking esp. with SBQ being so glitchy. I enjoy destroying the base of someone hogging all the kills. Plus if they kill me in return, free caps and junk! Ah, infinite lives
---
\*Which
---
There’s more than one?
---
Just Ressource ScrochBeast
---
If you're on PC and haven't played in a while, update your mods 
---
People just sit st the golf course and exploit the exp... I wish they would just remove the ghouls.
---
why didnt you use hunter/hunted then?
---
Been a while since I last did any coding but I don't think it would be that hard to implement; just a simple value check against each item when using the store all junk option.
---
Adding/removing tracking would also be a useful feature. The two could go hand in hand.
---
I don't know man alot of their prices seem very out of place. But guessing since its a new emote its worth more for that new emote feel i guess.
---
Unless he owns the camp and is wanting to collect the bounty.
---
AFAIK you have to 100% on the powering up.  Did the plants completely 3 times and got all 3.  First time I did it I only partially repaired the plant (what was required) and did not get any plans.
---
Of course you can also find the legendary weapons with the Medic ability.  This is far more efficient.
---
A Medic Flamer would be a perfect healer though.   I will keep any Medic Handmade or rifle I find though if I can set it to auto.  For when I group up.
---
I did find a Medic auto Pipe pistol, but it was level 15 (dropped from level 68 legendary)
---
Holy crap,  I thought I was the only one suffering from this. 
---
I used to live here. Moved to the mire for tge atmosphere but I do miss my junk collector. 
---
Electrically grounded does affect the gauss rifle
---
We just had it turned to straight pvp cause we never heard of this hunter/hunted thing but even then if it’s just friends killing each-other we shouldn’t stop punished for it but oh well I’ll just afk for 4 hours and try that hunter thing next time thanks for letting me know about that though :D
---
Dragons were actually intimidating and varied in their looks and attacks.  Scorch beasts literally just hover and spam the same lame attack. Maybe if you are lucky it will land for half a second to taunt you. 
---
Naw how lovely. I love to check out others workshops too!
---
When you literally just a super mutant behemoth with wings that likes to scream
---
XBOX - When the action doesn't stop, pulling up PipBoy or Favorites wheel to eat/drink is not to  handy.   Id rather use that down D pad for a Food/Water combo food of any type than emotes. 
---
Stimpacks has a D-Pad favorite..it stimpacks me with whatever level (diluted, regular, super) I have in my inventory... So something like that.  Maybe food/water could be dispensed from a worst condition first order.
---
 If Im in the middle of a battle  I dont have time to pull up the Pip Boy/favorites wheel  and go through a list of items and pick what Im eating/drinking.  I really dont care!   In fact 90% of the time I dont care what Im eating drinking.  I make a wide variety of food and the only one I use cautiously is Radstag for extra carry weight.
---
Sorting/Grouping AID -  Id rather see all chems together, all food/water together than digging through impossibly long list of 1 off items of chems, food, flux, crafting stuff.  
---
It wouldn't be so bad if they dropped decent loot, but literally they barely drop anything even slightly useful. I killed two once because of never killed one and came across two. I didn't keep any of the items they dropped either using or scrapping as they were either consumables or shit weapons or armour, it took me a whole day to replace all my 5.56 ammo and still haven't replenished all the fusion cells it took. Again I wouldn't mind but most legendaries I can take down much quicker, plus I can use melee and they give more exp and better loot, so why would I bother fighting them anymore? Hopefully they make improvements to scorchbeast and the queen, I mean all the nukes I see are on whitesprings I can't remember the last time someone nuked fissure site prime because you can get so much more out of whitesprings. 
---
I got a few prime receiver reward for killing them but never from fissues usually the ones the game forces me to kill like... hey btch we know you just spawned on inside your camp but we want you two to fight. There goes my a mags of ammo in to shooting him down.
---
There's nothing really to the quests in terms of content.
---
You get ultracite from a BoS or enclave quest or something. One of the quests gives you an ultra lightweight supersledge. One of the early quests gives you a legendary 10mm SMG.
---
That's about it. You mostly unlock areas of the map and doors. If you can access every door in the game (except ones which have no known key, like Whitesprings houses) then you've finished the game.
---
It ain’t that.  It’s not like they are super difficult.  They are a waste of ammo, junk and meds for the payoff.  
---
They’re just a flying annoyance.  I get better drops off level 1 scorched.
---
West Virginia state flower = the satellite dish.
---
Might be a bit of a dated joke.  
---
The loot is indeed crappier than a Lvl 15 Feral Ghoul. This needs to be fixed asap. I mostly have the Luck that they primarily engage me on the  ground. Getting them down with my .50 Hunting Rifle is a very long task...
---
When someone thinks you're hiding you can leave and flank without them hearing you 
---
Thanks! True hero here.
---
no problem, you need 4 players for it though  
---
ps, it gives you rewards too, i got stims and purified water
---
Ah decent can you have more than 4??
---
I want a poster that's in the classic ww2 "I want YOU" format except it's MODUS saying "I want YOU to destroy houses on the golf course!"
---
I hate the Scorchbeasts too, but isn't that the point?
---
I've killed two Scorchbeasts in 'the wild' (i.e. outside of quests) and it took forever, and all I got was some crappy offal and other bits and pieces, but so what? Killing them isn't a 'job' that demands fair recompense. The flying fuckers don't owe you anything. They're the apex predator, and you're just fresh meat. 
---
These days when I go out and hear anything that sounds like flapping wings, I cringe. When I see a shadow on the ground or a flicker of movement in the sky, I go cold. If I see one before it sees me, I thank my lucky stars and try to creep away. If one chases me, I run as far and as fast as I can.
---
I hate them, but I'm supposed to. Who said the wasteland was meant to be safe and fair? 
---
You’ll get the power armor stands after you finish the excavator armor. 
---
Also you need to build it there in the room as you have to click a button after you build it. 
---
Working on my Dominion/ Adapta Sororitas ... but I dislike the plasma green. Blackbird paint though. Now only if I could buy some purity seals to stick on the armor....
---
I gave plans to one guy, and he showed me how he was going to trick me into his deathtrap without actually killing me, because I had been so random nice, he was very high level.  It was a very tricky trap.
---
Nope, the game just sucks like that sadly.
---
No trick, heh?
---
Fortunately, for players using stealth, one tactic does work 100% of the time.
---
You stay hidden, you just fire one bullet at a scorchbeast when she's not facing you, turning your hidden status to "warning", then you just wait and observe it looking for you. It will just fly around looking for you and sending some scorched on the ground as well - you want to take care of them since the beast is blind if they dont spot you.
---
After a minute or so, since it can't find you, it will land to look for you. And that's the moment you take it down, aiming for the wing in VATS if possible, or manually, where the wings are attached to his back.
---
That's how I was hurting scorch beast without using chems, stimpacks, and with a non legendary weapon.
---
The small town on the bottom right near cranberry bog and the savage divide, it has one of the only places I've found that a behemoth will spawn at and also if you go through the roof of the ta building there's an office that has clipboards, carlyl typewriters, and a bunch of stuff to get steel. Each desk has a clipboard and typewriter and there's atleast 8-10 desks on each floor. 
---
I did it 100 percent all 3 times plus many times after that and still can’t get it just want the plan if anyone has it
---
It's weird. I had real trouble placing a wall once, but managed to fill the gap with a half wall on the bottom and two 'quarter diagonal' wall pieces on the top. It was the only combo that would work.
---
I think its gotta be a face tank weapon
---
You know 90% of those mats are provided from the workshop, right? If it’s green it means the mats are coming from the workshop, not your personal stash. And you can use camp blueprints in a workshop. I have a turret/crafting tower blueprint I drop when I claim then it’s just a matter of running power to extractors and waiting for that first defense event to pop. 
---
The absolute worst part is when they glitch out and have infinite scream AP , you literally have to kill it or enter a building with a loading screen to get away because they just sit there and skree skree skree constantly without stopping.
---
"Greetings traveler, would you like to ask me about an (**adventure**)?"
---
Soooo... Can any noobs confirm that they actually have found stuff like this in Flatwoods? Bc I'm constantly dropping ammo and supplies in the cash register but I'm not convinced anyone is actually able to pick it up.
---
LOL k bye
---
Scorchbeasts should have a chance to drop broken power armor peices
---
They’re literally enclosing the commons! Guillotine!
---
You have dragonrend. It's called Enforcer in Agility. Just randomly fire at the thing until you hear a couple of weird noises and it lands.
---
If I pass an unclaimed workshop I always take it over and do the defend quest. The workshops aren't good for resources, but very good for rewards (chems and plans). 
---
Having said that, the first plan I got from a take-over was for a dirty ashtray.
---
no, you buy and sell instantly. And vendor's caps refill fraction of what've paid for something, i.e. you bought plan for 200 caps and vendor will have only 50 caps back for you to sell him more goods. You also must remember, that when vendor have full stack (200) you should first sell him your goods to slim his wallet and then buy something from him - otherwise you won't get caption, since 200 caps is max vendor can have.
---
south of NAR, there is set of small houses.
---
They ALSO have a plan in them.
---
He means save your custom look and then say you change it or gender and want to go back to that old preset you are going have to remake it and its easy for the remake to not look exactly like the original, hence saving the look as a preset.
---
I'm actually surprised this wasn't down voted just because of scorchbeast angst.
---
After the last patch the things spend plenty of time on the ground anyway.
---
When you think broken game features were made for you to rp.
---
What level are you? 
---
The merchant bots can have a maximum of 200 caps.
---
If you sell someting to them, they lose that exact amount.
---
If you buy from them, they gain 25% of your expended caps, up to a maximum storage of 200 caps.
---
It is called either "resource sink" or "bs", maybe both.
---
36
---
Sometimes it is a PA chassis, sometimes it's technical data....
---
It can happen when people fast travel.
---
Yeah, that’s how I got my letters and neons! Saved literal thousands of caps in plans just goofing around.
---
When you look at what modders have been doing with skyrim and fallout 4, you begin to realize this isn't such a bad idea. Maybe Bethesda should just make engines and let the public make the games. On a new engine, not this thing we have now.
---
Run the Surface to Air event.
---
Before I got tse weapon, I was using a junkie explosive double barrel for almost a month and it was only lvl 35 and using that almost lvl 200 is just sad. Was always curious if using the junkie bonus would make it even more one-shotting, but never really wanted those negative effects since -str is less carry weight, - char is less bonuses from event prizes and vendor prices would be higher, -luck would maybe let those perk cards proc, etc. This just shows Bethesda never really balanced the legendaries.
---
Seen tonnes of amazing write ups here on end game stuff but some of my favs.
---
1. Vault diving - comming
---
2. Each area of the map having unique nuke zone bosses/ mobs that spawn in. 
---
3. Player vendors - comming / fix player market and ban / end dupers - ????
---
4. Clans with off the map instance base that you all build up together like a mini town of sorts for your clan.
---
5. New locations size of Far Harbor dlc size with new quests etc. But for the size would need to drop that instance area to 8 while the main remains 24. If you get what i am saying.
---
6. Major player hub, people are always mentioning this to turn Rosies tower into a instanced hub for trade and chatting etc.
---
7. Faction wars and faction ranks / rewards.
---
8. More build space for camps to allow us to expand out into the first settlements to RECLAIM the land.
---
9. Overhaul pvp and yada yada it needs so much work. But pvp has always been a good part to end game.
---
10. Caravan card game as another staple to end game stuff to collect cards and play others.
---
You don't craft the b.o.s combat armor you mod the plane combat armor in to b.o.s.
---
They do seem to be landing a bit more. If you can deal with the noise for a but most of them lately for me have just landed long enough for me to shoot them in the face and kill them. 
---
Nah, your post is worthless
---
Im beginning to wonder, myself.  Im level 80, have a tse (so unbalanced) and the only other thing I want is jetpack mod.  After that...? I really want to keep playing but the current gameplay loop is stale.
---
And pvp is just fucked up so there is no endgame there. Other than getting in a back and forth battle with someone using your explosive weapons and one-shotting each other, it just doesnt work.
---
I still like it, with whiskey I can fast travel back to my camp or a vendor with that perk card, still wish it buff duration, like theirs perk cards in strength that do 2 things, reduce shotgun weight and faster reload, another reduce melee weapon weight and faster swing speed.
---
The problem is that they *are* difficult to kill. I had to use a plasma gatling on my heavy guns character, literally specced to maximize the big guns.
---
I have to use a plasma gatling to kill them. And then the gatling when the shitty plasma one breaks, but the plasma does the most damage to flying enemies for some reason.
---
Also, dont forget when the scorch beast dies and LANDS ON AN UNREACHABLE PLACE. I'm looking at YOU Fort Defiance.
---
Furious is still decent for a Combat Shotgun because it's semi-auto, and the one I have has the faster fire rate bonus too. I'm not exactly sure how Furious works, in the sense that I'm unaware how many times you can stack the consecutive damage increase.
---
Get the dense mod for your armor.
---
There were a few posts in this sub, as well as r/fallout. 
---
They all copy-and-pasted the same shit, so I concede that there *might* be some truth to it, but not a one of them provided a screencap of the email, and I asked all of them.
---
Just had this happen to me.... lost my best power armor piece...
---
I've been wondering this also. I seem to remember that some containers are instanced to the individual ... would just be nice to know if someone is actually picking stuff up ... or should I just drop it in the river and move on!
---
It's not 4 dollars. It's 5 days of playing the game for 15 minutes or playing 70 cents for each day you didn't play.
---
i just found out you get all the schematics from one of the computers in enclave military wing for the power armor x-01.
---
i also heard that theres a special vender somewhere in the responders faction that sells scorched killer weapons.
---
these are the kind of things im talking about. important hidden content.
---
Thank you. My new character is still under 20, so this 'theory crafting' is very helpful. I'll have to dig deeper into your post after work tonight.
---
I don't play the game but holy shit are you serious with that pricing??
---
Yes I know that, I am trying to mod combat Armor. But the BOS option isn’t showing up, even though I have read the plan. 
---
I use the blade of bastet
---
Yep, this is correct. I tested this on my third character. You MUST spend 50 level up points before you unlock the re-spec function.
---
I think items, aside from junk, should cap at 99 or whatever. And dupes of specific weapons/armor should be disabled. You should only be able to have ONLY 1 of that specific piece of gear
---
Can only place 2 mines at a time.  When you place the third the first detonates.  
---
I don't recall the responder vendor, but to be honest you'll find better scorched killer weapons if you farm Whitesprings for legendaries.
---
I got a lever action with scorched damage there and I've had at least another dozen scorched legendaries there.
---
If you scrap enough guns you actually get a magazine that does additional damage to scorched as well.
---
thats bog town
---
You're probably seeing the bug where the vendor total displays incorrectly.
---
Ex: Go to Watoga train station. Sell until 0. Go to Phoenix. Phoenix will show 0 caps but is unrelated to the Watoga vendor. Sell something to Phoenix - now the cap total will be 200 - what you sold.
---
Always try to sell to vendors even it they show 0 or anything &lt; 200.
---
You can only have two mines deployed at once. If you throw out a third, the oldest one explodes.
---
Overencumber it with the hundred thousand bobbleheads
---
Hello, well first off what build are you going for? 
---
'Broken' for you perhaps. Why not put on your big boy pants and stop whining. Or take your mum with you so she can give the flying monsters a good talking to.
---
I have a fucking boner right now from reading this, holy shit.
---
Even the scorch beast queen has trash loot for as long as it takes to take her down she should have much better loot.
---
you can get power armor mods and plans
---
I sure hope not
---
Now if only that cool down would actually effect assaultrons too. The bastards sometimes just endlessly spam their laser without charging it.
---
Sorry I miss understood I haven't come across this bug maybe I could try and craft it for you 
---
I don't really know, i have already upgrade the perk who make two handed melee weapon more powerful, after that i don't really know
---
You got downvoted for being correct. I shall join you. 
---
Good point. My late game Sniper is sitting on 100+ Ballistic Fiber right now. Other than Screws to make/scrap/repeat the Lever Action Rifle to get the mods, I am selling almost every other resource daily now.
---
THE LITERAL COMMIE AGENDA YOU DIRTY COMMIE
---
That would be perfect thank you! :)
---
It’s worked fine for the torso and arms. Just not the legs. 
---
I did get 20 caps bounty. Accidentally blew up his turret, which was awkwardly positioned. 
---
Awrite Falconhoof
---
You only get it once.  One of 3 random plans.  Check you haven’t read it and already got it.  Once you have the 3 it ransoms totally for other plans.  
---
I keep joking that their next ranged weapon should be an atlatl. Should one shot a scorchbeast. No one gets the joke.
---
I'm heading to work now, but can I buy them later? Most importantly the 556
---
Epic NPC Man, is that you?
---
A lot more then he should be
---
Holy Brahmin... I don't get why that kind of plan is that expensive. 
---
Well, strictly speaking I don't get why any CAMP plan costs 11000 caps, but these are just some signs, mostly scavenged at that. I get why some of the really fancy furniture is costly, or powerful generators and stuff, but some signs?? 
---
Anyway, I don't want to derail the thread, I was just flabbergasted. 
---
Dear Shectai:
---
We will be sending another correspondence tomorrow.  Please be sure you are sitting when you read it.  None of our telephone staff will be able to answer inquiry on this matter so please don't call.
---
-Your Bank
---
You disagree with me?
---
Here , take this insult about being a child.
---
Take it.
---
I use mine on the scorchbeast queen when she lands, I’m not even specced into heavy weapons but it shreds that big boned bitch.
---
OK my psn is Krackhead_
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks Here's a skill builder to play around on. Might be easier to have a look and see what you think will work for you
---
They should just always be legendary.
---
High risk, high reward.
---
They're rare enough for that to not be abused.
---
Greetings, i was a dweller like you but i got a bullet to the knee.
---
It’s at the top of Tanagra Town, which is itself a reference to Ancient Greece https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanagra_figurine
---
Okay you can always change your build after lvl 50, I'd say just keep getting 2handed perks or go on the wiki to help you guide yourself 
---
its in lights with the welcome home sign
---
Even having a flare gun if there's was a stun period with each shot it would help you get away, even at lvl 100 something I get griefed by them if I venture to close to their spawn. Least favorite thing for me is going to watoga and having two to three spawn in and just wreck me. If I don't have ammo for my guns or my PA is broken I'm dead meat. 
---
Genuine interest here but, why are you on the sub?
---
It makes up for the times you buy the plans you already have.
---
That's  no problem. I'm  in Australia so our times are going to be a bit mixed until the weekend I'd say.
---
What are these and what do we know about this 
---
I agree. The first two or so you fight are cool but then the novelty wears off. 
---
I have never gotten it at all trust me 
---
Cool story
---
Good on ya he most likely got his bounty by griefing others... sorry pretending to be a raider to make the griefing ok.
---
Except for the titanium mine when you're building excavator.
---
The Gatlin plasma isn't bad if yiu have the bloodied or furious legendary modifier, even with that it breaks waaaay to fast. I agree though, would love to see a buff applied to them. 
---
I did that and ***I*** spawn at a nice location when fast traveling to my CAMP.
---
However, ***teammates*** spawn under my floor in the middle of my CAMP.
---
They need way more hordes. Its like you kill a few and its just over super fast. Forget about other spots, its even worse. I love every other aspect of the game except this. 
---
Can confirm accidentally threw one at a base, 150 caps and no way to apologise. I'd have been happy to just fix it for them
---
Are you sure you did the powering up event and didn't just claim the workshop. 
---
The one where you repair the three sections of the power plant.
---
Hopefully with player vendors we can sell food and it keeps it's freshness while in the machine. Not a great solution but set the price for meat at 5 k and you've got yourself a fridge 
---
You have to reach level 50 for the Super Duper Perk card.
---
I'd love for alot of the FO4 settlement stuff to come back.
---
I think it's in The Mire close to one of the Scorchbeast detectors you have to fix as part of the Main quest. If I'm right, it's just west of a Red Rocket
---
I was trying to get to the top of the tree.
---
Or maybe we can all pick up some damn power-brooms and actually clean up around the damn map. It's too damn dirty 'round here to be "rebuilding america".
---
Post here the moment it pops for the community. :D
---
Mine is taking up 130% of my budget. I’m not able to place ANYTHING at my camp. I haven’t logged in to play because of it. Not having a camp is a very hard hit.
---
I think legendary effects need to be completely disabled for pvp
---
Oh. Nice! That place is awesome. I couldn't remember the name of it. 
---
I see an intact wall...
---
9/10, soldier... 
---
All scorchbeast should drop legendaries. No be harder, just worth fighting in the first place. Oh and craftable legendaries from other legendaries. 
---
My main way to deal with weight in nuke zones is to make sure I am not over encumbered by 1000 lbs, but I'm not against the idea

"The Emperor Protects" "Yes he does".
---
I forgot about the surface-to-air missiles. I killed a couple in a mission at Fort Defiance, but wasn't counting that. 
---
There is an Ice box stash but that's the best you'll get
---
Yeah. Pretty much. 
---
*glares at his Vault Bed plans sourly*
---
It wouldn't be that bad if they weren't duped and everyone earned them. Also if people would just be courteous and shoot the ceiling at whitesprings or just use their other weapons, I have two of them and I never just mow down everything unless I'm doing a sbq or a silo run. 
---
Just buy them. The markets are so saturated that they're often sold for 200-500 caps.
---
I PK anyone who brings that shit to the golf club. 
---
We Didnt have any issues killing them in skyrim with bow and arrow. 
---
Ya early game is different, but by the time you've settled into a late-game build you kinda get a rhythm where the few resources you need you can burn through no problem, and ditch/sell the rest, without really having to worry about breakdown or wasting stuff. Maybe once in a while an hour or so of farming, but very rarely and only if you run super low on a particular material or aid item. But by then you know where to find em pretty quick 🤷
---
I have seen 3 long dogs. The nukes cause some horrible mutations
---
Oh and are you on PS4? I have a big pile of Screws I'd sell cheap if you are 👍
---
It was Christmas/ New year tbf, most teams were probably on a skeleton crew
---
It's the only station I've been followed into and ravaged by Wendingos on steroids, plus the mutants and ghouls spawn in around town pretty sharpish after you clear them out.
---
There is one building that looks like it's a big reception hall type thing with a back door facing into the golf course itself.  People build their CAMP right outside the door with a bunch of turrets facing the door.  When they fast travel back to their CAMP there will be a horde of ghouls that spawn inside the building.  The ghouls will funnel through the doorway allowing the CAMP owner to tag them as they run out and the turrets take care of them before they reach the bottom of the staircase.  
---
Lots of XP and almost definitely a legendary or two for standing there blind firing at a doorway.  Not sure on exactly how this works but a new person entering an area respawns all the enemies so I've heard of groups sitting at whitesprings taking turns logging out and back in but this may have been patched out.  
---
Setting up your CAMP like this prevents anyone else from getting XP from the large horde of enemies; when the CAMP owner isn't there the turrets kill the enemies as they funnel through the doorway usually before the random person walking around realizes what is happening.  As long as you're not directly outside the banquet hall door you wont get constantly hassled.
---
I know that spot!  For a while I had my C.A.M.P. near there, but rather than building on the water, which is obviously a prime spot, I was built far enough away that my camp wasn't packed up when logging in.  It was amusing, because I was about as close as the game would allow another camp to be.
---
Not to mention once you get all the prime receivers you just get one less plan instead of something else. Lame
---
Maybe crafting perks. 
---
What should I invest it into don’t need crits and others are only sometimes useful should I just respec them into intelligence so I can get gun smith
---
Is it me or does it sound like you have the hots for them
---
That’s still 4 times the amount it should be
---
Because social media is a never-ending spiral of misery, hatred and mind decay, I would assume he's  avoiding it and not entertaining it all.
---
I had a radio in my beta camp that I blueprinted and now that blueprint is unplaceable because radios magically vanished...
---
How much money a Company is worth doesn't matter. 
---
The initial release was good for 9 month's server upkeep? 
---
After that, they need to make a profit. Other games do large paid expansions pacts, or monthly upkeep.
---
76 has no monthly costs, every DLC is free, so they have to make money somehow, and game sales is not enough.
---
Take a look at McDonalds. Net worth of 129.9 billion. Whenever they open a new store they have to make a profit, if the store isn't profitable in 6-8 months they close it down, and start elsewhere. 
---
Haha I saw it after taking the photo and then demolished. Also some more plants and parts of the concrete wall that were still holding.
---
It doesn't stop anyone griefing xD. I can have -50% player damage and still blow up your stuff. -50% is nothing vs 2 shot explosive shotguns or a 3000 damage powerfist, 'Oh no, I can only do 1,500 damage instead of 3k'.. 
---
The 13 rads are mitigated with Rad Sponge.
---
I stopped running nukes in regular armor because rad sponge messes up my bloodied...... and because everyone else is just taking 0 because glitch.
---
Last night I was attacked by a scorchbeast in the Mire. After 5 minutes of plinking it with my sniper rifle (it never landed so I couldn't use my combat shotgun or grenades) and using half a dozen stimpacks, I finally had its health bar down to about 60%. Then it just up and flew away. Most frustrating fight I've ever had in a video game.
---
Well in game it is just a challenge to get atoms. But irl these markers are placed for geographic mapping of vertical &amp; horizontal landscapes &amp; triangulation points (this is a very dumbed down explanation - if you want to know more detail I suggest googling) the one on spruce knob definitely exists in real life with the sameinfo as the disk.
---
A Behemoth can also spawn in Bog Town with other Super Mutants and they fight the Scorched.
---
No mention of Zealot's?
---
What market? Nothing is rare or hard enough to acquire to have any value.
---
Then yr the only one
---
The only place I've successfully hidden from a Scorchbeast is under trees in thick cover, and even then I was pretty much stuck there while it circled around. In most situations I just run and run until I've outstripped them far enough to fast travel the hell out of there.
---
I've never found any cover that will actually protect you from Scorchbeast attacks unless the structure has its own loading screen. In all other cases I've been continually screeched at and farted on by the bat bastards even in substantial buildings. I used to have a base by Solomon's Pond, but every other day one or two of the a-holes would come and blast it to pieces, so I left.
---
I'm not complaining. Keeps it interesting.
---
Yes I did all 3 sections fixing all the stuff etc etc and nothing 
---
The flatwoods monster has legs inside the suit. I used an explosive weapon and blew some middle panel off it between its head and the bottom of it/thrusters?. It reminds me how they did the shredder once time on tmnt with the midget alien inside him lol.
---
Depends which vendor, the enclave will sell specifically X0-1 mods if you want calibrated for that. Apart from this, like you said,  I haven't seen any for other power armour apart from T-60 (actually found the mod lying around someone once). I'm sure they must be around somewhere.
---
That’s one of the finest ape drapes I’ve ever seen! I had a pretty lush head of hockey hair myself as a young lad in the 80s. Sometimes I’d even mousse it up all spikey on top for serous business. 
---
Better QA than Bethesda's entire QA department.
---
Yup. Thick cover will do it.
---
"rewardless"
---
They're supposed to be hazards, not flying pinatas.
---
I'll say one thing... the Brotherhood questline 
---
Kill jester
---
Got it. Thanks!
---
I use a melee weapon there as courtesy. If i see players with TSE stealing all kills i jump in front of their bullets to make them suicide.
---
That and the few non-atom decor (like my god damn house plants) keep flying off to the top floor for maximum sunlight whenever I place them.
---
What are you people on about
---
npp
---
For me, the flies really help me find meat piles. Stop and stare at your screen, and you can see them buzzing around quite clearly. Besides, they also make directional sound! :)
---
I know right, you’d think there’d be at LEAST the items from FO4
---
Or maybe the Virgin Mary airbrushed on with some spinners too? 
---
What a load of crap, lags the server ? Lags everybody’s game ? Crashes the server ?1 Do you play on a potato ? Is this sub just going to say everything you don’t like ‘causes lag’ ?
---
Ps, the person who put up the camp DOES get loot, that’s the whole point.
---
Fucking clueless.
---
And they disappear in like 30 seconds
---
We need some "magical carpet" like in F04. Put the carpet on the floor and you spawn there everytime you will use fast travelling.
---
I will. Thank you.
---
If there was no way to earn atoms except for paying i would agree. However you can earn plenty of atoms in game. I played since beta, have 143 hours total, and bought the blackbird power armor paint for 1800 atoms and now have bought the minigun one for 400. I don't even go for challenges or do the dailys and weekly and i still have 2200 atoms left.
---
Never used legendary guns in FO4, haven't bothered with them in 76, they shouldn't even be a thing.
---
Hey sorry went to bed, I’ll be on in about an hour. Send me an invite anytime!
---
Agreed, I wouldn't mind that either.
---
There's an entire mutation built around it. No one uses it.
---
As others have mentioned you can bump the durability of crafted armor. There was a glitch that let you hit INT 40, but I don't know/care if it still works - you can hit that fairly easily without glitches.
---
It's only useful for crafted weapon (CND) and armor. I don't honestly believe it actually changes the return on most scrapped items or helps the chance to unlock a mod, etc, but YMMV.
---
I just avoid people and go solo with my tse at whitespring
---
The only thing that can kill me is myself. Mostly.
---
There has only been like two times I've died from things not related to my own failure. Once I crashed in whitesprings, logged into a nuclear detonation, couldn't respawn at all, had to leave the server and lose all my stuff, that one was irritating. Another was a bugged mirelurk king in glassed cavern that one shot me from full health, It took me 5 attempts to kill him, but he dropped multiple awesome legendries, so it was actually really worthwhile, he felt like something of an end game boss that was actually worth fighting, and I would love to encounter another one like that. 
---
Getting one shot by players universally feels bad no matter who you are, that has happened, I despise people who grab all your stuff than hop servers before you can retaliate, if they at least had to try to escape me with my haul that would be one thing, they couldn't, so they drop and find a world without me in it to sort my stuff, and probably drop 3/4 of it on the ground to disappear. HATE... HATE... HATE that. I don't even have a problem with people taking some of my stuff, they can have my 100+ ballistic fiber I carry, at least let me have my damn steel back.
---
They just need to "lift" the "Do it yourself" mod. 
---
Thank you. But I'm on the Xbone. I long for the day that I am back to sitting on a pile of them!
---
They are announcing the upcoming patch notes this morning 
---
Turning into? It's exactly the same, or is that what you meant?
---
It does work. Fixed my horrible spawn location on my camp this way. Basically just drop camp, build everything the way you want and then try different camp drop locations within the area. May take a few tries but I was able to finally not load inbetween rocks and a wall on my camp. 
---
Currently nothing both in stored and nothing in blueprints tab.
---
I appreciate it! Username is slprice (to clarify, it's sLprice). Just add me and I'll hit you up if I see you on before the weekend or on the weekend 
---
Remove the roof, or upper floor, then place the object down, and then put your roof back on. Ran into this myself countless times too lol.
---
Ty
---
It is very op i admit
---
Don't know if it's illegal, but I would never spend a cent of real money either for in-game items/services or cosmetics from Atomic Shop...
---
And Marcus
---
That's right. Business in the front, party in the back. 
---
You don’t say? Gonna offer help or?
---
I think completely disabled is a bit much, I reckon a balancing pass:
---
&gt; having a look at weapon base and legendary damage and apparel resists, alongside tuning of NPC health/resists 
---
is in order so that:
---
- pvp isn't a one-shot deal
---
- pve isn't a rollover point-and-click adventure
---
- Melee, TSE weapons and sentinel/unyielding/assassin combo'd apparels aren't the only viable end-game builds
---
Cryolator plus endangerol syringer and my [antiarmor prime .50](https://imgur.com/gallery/LGqjtL7) are all I need. 
---
You need to look at the DR formula from FO4. 
---
Its very difficult to calculate the most EHP like an MMO would because of how the more damage you would take makes lower DR less effective.
---
It matters more on what your fighting to determine what is better.
---
I feel directly attacked by this post...  it’s too accurate. 
---
Wesmongar
---
This is why in al ost all of my posts here i add a "ps reduce camp restrictions" theres just too many restrictions to really fully enjoy camp building.  
---
I know they are there to help stop the stupid immersion breaking buildings but people can still build these ugly ass floating blocks on a single staircase.  
---
If they can build that then why cant i place a flooring peice on the ground, why must everything snap to a foundation, why can i now make a marsupial access only building ect...
---
True reward comes from within 
---
I always run to flares, usually something interesting is happening 
---
"Paenitet te et cras Morietur"
---
Don’t Alt+F4.  Do Ctrl + Tab to bring up the social menu, right click on your name and choose “Leave Server”.  Then you can just pop into a new server.
---
I think they need to divide the servers unless your on a team to below 50 and above 50
---
They are most certainly a terms of use violation, but it's not cost effective in any means for Bethesda to go after them. So there they will stay.
---
Id like to hear specifics on the disappearing,  when I toss out a nuke mine and it disappears it makes me want to kill everyone. 
---
Think a mod over at the main Fallout 76 forum said yesterday that it is against they policies and they would have a look at that specific case the user was talking about..
---
I'm used to previous fallout games where I always had 2 companions who could both carry about the same amount as my character. Definitely a hoarder, I want to give my plans &amp; etc to other players vs tossing them
---
Why didn't you just take a screenshot?
---
But even that doesnt make sense since like I noted the nuclear glare pose has been out for a while is nearly identical and is the same price.... it just seems like they are just offhandedly throwing a number in there for the price....
---
There's just an overall lack of different design options, making people showing off all these near identical looking camps rather uninspiring.
---
Not a skyrim dragon.  
---
I've had technical data in my inventory for weeks, no clue what it's for :x
---
"Im doing my part" lol
---
Seriously, the game has decided to trap my buddy underneath one of my foundations everytime he fast travels to my camp.  A fast travel mat would be fantastic.
---
So something with a high damage out put I would want to take the DR? Also what’s EHP stand for
---
Finally we find out what happened to the ones in Fortnite.
---
Does arti or orbital strike make you wanted?
---
I make runs through the southern end of the map. Occasionally watoga vendors but I have more reliable experience getting t51 mods in the south west region. 
---
Also the radio, I want to know why they were silently removed in the first place.
---
Legit- that or sonic bombs with the whole echolocation thing. 
---
The ammount of times ive tried to flash them via the radial menu in this game is unreal and embarassing 
---
I want to say it’s hard to pick my favourite because I switch all the time, but that’s kind of a lie because Charleston Landfill is my constant go-to.  Three junk nodes is incredibly useful but also Aluminum and Copper for my Gatling Plasma ammo wasting ass?  On top of that there’s purified water and easy access 
---
I think my least favourite is Dolly Sods because for basically three wood nodes, you get attacked by some obnoxiously high level mobs in the defend quests.  
---
Racist. 
---
&gt; Sounds like bullshit, they were probably hitting next to you and that's why you weren't damaged.
---
You know when a scorched is hitting you. Also you never hear anyone saying, the scorch beast was spamming it's sonic attack, but thankfully, it was hitting near me, but not on me. Happens all the time.
---
&gt; the engine probably has no way of blocking the sonic booms and farts when you're inside
---
Meaning, you don't know what your talking about. And you also don't know how to read, because I said you still get hit by the farts. 
---
&gt; I've never been able to protect myself from their booms or farts, I just server hop since I have no way or desire to counter attack.
---
Which is basically saying, you've never tried, and you probably didn't listen to any holotape or read any notes in the game. 
---
*If you see a camp with nothing but turrets it is your duty as a good Communist to light that shit up, we won't stand for no capitalist fuckers being complete and utter assholes to try and hog all our hard earned loot.*
---
Fixed that for you.
---
Poor level 50s.  
---
I saw that too I thought my game was bugged 
---
Well I would like player vending machines too, that’s a storefront for selling via caps. My idea is separate in that fact it’s not a transactions. You either give shit away for free with it (which I m sure could be done with vending machines unless they have a 1 cap per item limit) or you hide and defend it to add a little extra nuance to the PvP, which hopefully will be balanced soon.
---
They’re trolls, or they mostly do it to successfully dupe their items
---
wait, really? thats crazy. i gotta find it now and slaughter it with bunker buster or something
---
I dread the day beth will release the fallout 4 painted handmade. Money ,money ,money.
---
They're probably keeping it locked for moments of low shares values.
---
I drop stuff immediately outside v76, inside the dead corpses and stash boxes
---
It’s the 1st thing the noobs go after creating their toon.
---
Imagine their surprise when they see recipes ammo and gear.
---
Christmas all year round.
---
Rudolph happened
---
Proceeds to lead you to a carefully constructed fire box or a place of worship that involves murder.
---
Then your friend fast travel and he is trapped under a stair screaming for help since they are stuck lmao
---
I really don't get why they put up those invisible walls and walkable invisible floor around and above the asylum roof. It's got great views up there, but the fact that you're walking around on nothing kinda ruins it.
---
Yeah I made a post with a video of it but I think I deleted the post. I still have the video on my xbox though.
---
I think it would make it easier to get to level 50 faster
---
There's a lot more things that ruin this game as well. Of course they'll downvote you.
---
I picked up an two shot Tesla gun without explosive for just this reason.
---
yes imagine the blood, sweat and other bodily fluids freely flowing down from inside that PA
---
I thought about that, you’d just start placing it right out front and easy to see with nothing in it. Of course then some jackass will probably blow your shit up because you had an empty box.
---
So we are sure it’s in the user agreement then?
---
Fastest I can kill them is with explosive combat shotty bout 3 shots for an 80 once it lands with shotty and explosives setup maxed.. few more if they won't land.. before explosive weaponry my best friends were marsupial and a 1 star executioners gatling gun.. 
---
They are a for daily quest "Foridden knowlegde"
---
This! I was just thinking about the vendor cap system. What benefit do they have of making a 3* worth 50 caps? You can't get anything premium for caps anyway. Vendors aren't even selling the best plans for the most part. Definitely a broken part of the game. 
---
Interesting, was that guy being sued?
---
Yep. I had a stack of them before I started the quest for the first time, and it erased all but one. Ever since I can only get one at a a time. If treasure maps can stack, these should too.
---
yea, that was my bad.. I listed that in a rush, since telephones were in my personal loot collection habits. I edited my original post to correct it
---
No this set doesn't give you the neon letters. These are more like reflective squares. The neon letters are like 25,000 if you find them on a vendor. 
---
You can kill this with one shot using the Long Pew
---
This game had balance? Powerfist with 3,000+ damage is balanced? 
---
Truth is, my explosive shotgun is only OP when I use 15 perk points dedicated to shotgun/explosive damage buffs.. 
---
Stop complaining, I got x2 explosive shotguns dropped to me from events and I'm level 130. My friends don't want the spare one because they already have OP melee builds.
---
You sound mad 'cause someone has 'better' loot than you. Use your perk cards properly and stop moaning. 
---
I wish their xp was more than killing 3 radstags. 
---
"Scrapper corpse highlighting" (bodies glow until you loot them once you have rank 1 of the Scrapper perk) was one of my favorite mods from Fallout 4.  And hey, since Scrapper is a useless perk in 76, it would be totally justified.
---
Like a true functioning economy, cost is based on the demand for an item. People want to be able to spell out "I'M NOT GAY BUT 20 CAPS IS 20 CAPS"
---
What a pro. Makes camp in one the most usefull event spawn for farming tamable animals,preventing it from happening. 
---
Literally several in the post :-p
---
very nice :) would love to have that kind of "budget" , lol
---
Have 1 and 1/2 floor, metal walls, 2 turrets, fusion generator and small purifier, totally maxed out :/
---
But i think i have several "ghost turrets" in my budget that i had to replace because they just disappear .. 
---
Wish i knew bro
---
I don’t play either.
---
For me: Loved 3/NV (probably my favourite games ever) 
---
4 was okay, felt alot more repetitive and more of a grind.
---
Heard about 76 release and concept around the time of the beta, subbed to see what it would be like.
---
one of my favourite things about the franchise was the random, often brilliant encounters, so I was in the fence about buying.
---
The beta came out, it didn’t sound like my sort of game, on top of being pretty broken. Basically release same thing.
---
Somehow I went from convinced it was going to be brilliant, to convinced I was going to smash up my tv if I played it.
---
I’m a huge Fallout fan, but I won’t buy it- I literally think Bethesda should be punished for this shit, by not getting my money.
---
Just stayed for some reason, to see what’s up. And because I didn’t think I’d like it, it’s still nice to hear mixed reviews and what people that enjoy it 
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature. Other words - work as intended. The only way to "farm it" is to have a friend who doesn't have BoS questline finished (that mission available), so he can stack Technical data in the inventory, stand near closet and dropping you one by one...
---
That's nice and rough at the same time, I personally hate it when I spawn in and everyone hasn't loaded in yet, shoot, then die from the game rendering them in late. A good plan if they are all standing at the door reloading is to go to the other houses on the side, I've noticed on occasion that if the golf course doesn't spawn any legendary 2 * - 3 * enemies the other houses have them. If you just run away from the group quickly those are gaurunteed kills, yeah you miss the 5k xp but the ones in the houses respawn as well and that nets you well over 5k. Also if you have a tesla rifle and just fire into the hallway you still get the xp and can come back by and loot them after making the circle. 
---
yep, they deleted 16 of my technical data once I received the quest. When logging in, you may randomly see technical data at your feet that can't be picked up. My guess is that they did this to get some extra life out of that quest, so people don't turn in 50 at a time. 
---
My main is a melee build and they never land. 
---
:(
---
With this new build, I marked the harder to comeby resources at level 2 with the goal of building up surpluses so as not to be caught without when they become are needed.  
---
The Ballistic Fiber surplus on my main is a direct result of farming Screws. I stumbled on a location, that while not great for one run, has enough Ammo Bags to add up over time.
---
I have not read one good thing about Fallout 76
---
Unless it's for Power Armor can't do it
---
I doubt you've played Morrowind then.
---
Two words: cliff racers
---
Mutanist!
---
I would also like to know
---
1. Cosmetic: Milk vending machine works a cosmetic fridge in my camp
---
2. Other options: Nuka vending maching - Ice machine. 
---
3. Salted perk extends the spoil durations on food. I only use it when i log out. Not sure if it helps but it's ritual now. 
---
4. Id like to see a fridge with it's own storage capacity that extends food life. Even a 10 lb capacity. BUT other player should be able to access it, like purified water. lockable though. Id like to see more unique storage boxes seperate from stash.
---
No we have been trying to get them to speak regarding exploits since the first one were found in beta. They are very tight lipped about exploits and most likely won't say anything until they can figure out how to end it.
---
BSOD is a windows thing 
---
If it helps check the following 
---
1) AV firewall edit the rules to make sure Fallout 76 can update
---
2) update windows and your gpu 
---
Happy hunting
---
Stuff crops up basically everywhere. I don't think there's any case where it isn't in violetion of the EULA/TOS for prettymuch anygame as the "You can't use this for commercial gain" has been standard for eons.
---
Though its by and large impossible to shutdown. It'll get moderated off larger public spaces and accounts get banned (either from Bethesda or platform holders), but it just goes on underground regardless.
---
Love the idea with the rugs, I think it would be neat to see the different ways we could implement it. Different tactics to hide or defend you box. And I understand completely with you on the safe and but can’t justify spending the caps atm either.
---
And while you're at it coding the skin,remember that you have an armor called ultracite,that may benefit from a skin too!
---
I do this, just shoot the ground or floor, far enough away to just ding them a bit.. 
---
How would a game change since last patch? If it wasn't patched, it didn't change.
---
combat rifle
---
Corporation doesn’t work like this. Any change goes through the chain of decisions and approvals before devs *try* to implement it.
---
I dont agree with it but I feel that Bethesda is largely to blame. Would you rather spend TWENTY dollars on some new pictures over your emote that dont even change the animation or do somewhere else and get a bunch TSE weapons and legendary armor? Bethesda kind of drove people into that market.
---
Pretty sure the guy from Mothership Zeta was a vault tec employee, conducting an inspection of vault 76.  So presumably he was abducted pre war.
---
I thought they said they were putting out updates? Did that never happen? Perhaps patch was the wrong word to use.
---
They cant sue anyone for it. Only ban them
---
This and it has actually had major issues with server stability. Since no recourse has still happened to exploits. So more and more are doing the practice.
---
We are expecting a inside the vault later on today. They said they will outline the next patches in it.
---
I want a "fusion core receiver" for the m79. Would be baller.
---
I mean I do have a few turrets but only for defence purposes (and for when I get chased by 5 high level wendigo’s!) is that an issue?
---
Speed demon might help
---
Yeah, avoid people is always the best strategy, agreed.
---
Bethesda took legal action over a guy selling a sealed copy of Evil Within 2 on Amazon.. I'm sure they will do something about some of these people. 
---
Someone me must be RPing a Responder. Haha. For real though think of all the white knight players who like to help new players coming out of the vault. Camps with handout boxes lining the road all the way to the overseers camp.
---
As long as it's not to farm kills than sure, just watch out because its probably still gonna,be blown up
---
I had luckily killed the SBQ with a large group before launching my own. So I pandered. 
---
&gt; is it still a flaming trash pile
---
If that's the way you felt about it, it's likely never going to change enough for your taste.
---
My problem is that they just roam around even far from their spawn. 
---
I logged out yesterday enraged and haven't played since because I got attacked by one after fast traveling to Sugar Grove to farm clipboards. 
---
And these things have a heck of a perception skill, the stun would have to be pretty long to allow you to leave the area or to go far enough to be allowed to fast travel. The ones around Watoga and the whole Bog are annoying af when trying to just explore though.
---
One thing is I'm happy they're giving trouble to high level players too, I was becoming worried I still couldn't tackle them on at level 41 lol
---
Alright this is one of the most interesting builds I have seen yet for a base.  Love it mate!
---
Yes... I get stuck in my PA now when I didnt use to and when I PvP with my TSE shotgun about 30% of the time it takes the other players health down to nothing and then they dont die and I completely stop being able to damage them even after dying. 
---
Marsupial, to avoid blowing up yourself.
---
I've easily killed 100+ scorchbeasts thinking they have to drop something worthwhile and have had zero plans drop. I'm not sure they have given me anything I actually kept other than ultracite. 
---
Grafton city bot, dont bother with the station 
---
Formulate your own opinion, many many people love this game. 
---
Someone also posted a 2million damage shotgun pic. Abusing stacking on explosive bobbleheads supposedly.
---
EHP = Effective HP, it's a calculation that includes damage avoided/negated as another form of HP.
---
Upvote 
---
The joke is on these people.. new 5\* weapons/armor are being released at some point. I myself would never spend a cent on any of these, especially since it does not benefit the studio in any way. In fact, these idiots buying/selling these duped weapons are hurting the games patching/content progress. 
---
What if?  
---
The harpoon gun had a mod that let you have a cable on the harpoon, i'd imagine it would HELL to keep track of both the scorchbeast AND the cabling as far as how flimsy the servers are. Having a functional harpoon wouldn't only allow us to tie down the monster to one location to avoid it running away, but probably give us a better opportunity to make it a little more predictable about it's movements and attacks
---
Could do with a paint option too. Ideally not one that costs as much as the entire game as that goes.
---
Along with some variety in the walls. We got half a dozen versions of a half wall, many of which I can't even decipher how or where you're meant to build them. But only one style of window and door per material set. And nothing like arches, or half wall gates, or vertical half walls to break up space with.
---
Now I’m going to go buy that paint scheme 
---
Let me just throw my super sledge at it and hope for the best it hits the wing and cripples it 
---
This should be posted over in one of the marketplace subreddits, this will get downvoted for being posted here. 
---
Not personally annoyed but just giving you a friendly heads up. 
---
Id still like to see how many total pounds are in each pipboy section. How much in aid, misc, armor ect. QOL  priority # 1 for my pip boy. 
---
Im not a damn calculator!
---
They are not rare, they live at fissure sites and you are welcome to visit them anytime. 
---
Don’t worry, they will add everything in the Atom shop when the game goes F2P...
---
I am a melee build as well, it is why I force them to land. I pop a whiskey and run over and kill them in a few hits.
---
The enforcer card is pretty consistent. I also have concentrated fire so I can check what is crippled on them but you dont need it to cripple them just fire in the specific places.
---
The enforcer card also works wonders for the cargo bots. You pop their engines and it causes them to just float there and do nothing. You will still need another source of ranged dmg to kill them tho
---
In short, enforcer is worth it for a melee build
---
This is what will be on it.... "We are excited to announce a new patch emplenting new and improved bugs that will once again make your game borderline unplayable! We wont be providing anymore details than that and also we are going to change a lot of the core machanics of the again without telling anyone."
---
Bird bones is a nice partner for this one. Also adds 4 AGI for a little AP. 
---
They won't change the Scorchbeasts. If the bugs that make it more difficult to fight get fixed, it will too easy to beat, and I bet they know that too. They fix any bugs that make things easier, and fix dupe methods (which is great, I'm not complaining.) But the majority of bugs that make the game harder won't be touched as it'll expose how bad the game is.
---
Just my opinion. I love fo76, and had great experiences in game. But the whole ordeal was a cluster fuck from the start and the game is so broken I don't think they can salvage it.
---
#PRAISE THE BOMB AND PASS THE AMMUNITION AND WE'LL ALL. STAY. FREEEEEEEE!
---
The point of pre-built decks is to be able to switch between them on the go depending on the situation,why limit it to a place that is usually safe and has enough time for you to switch perk cards manually? We want perk card decks so that we would be able to switch between a deck that is focused on combat and another focused on loot (green thumb,hacker,etc) on site,limiting this ability to C.A.M.P only defeats the purpose of changing an entire deck on command whenever we want making it useless except for a builder perk deck which you would only use in your C.A.M.P.
---
Time to test having 20 unyielding pieces unequipped in inventory this afternoon lol.
---
Speed demon, healing factor and marsupial maybe you could also run herd mentality if you play in a group and/or grounded and scaly skin if you dont use vats a lot, cameleon is also a good one if youre into stealth, eagle eyes and bird bones if you use vats, carnivore or hervivore for the extra benefits of food, honestly you can use almost any mutation depending on your playstyle check their effects and choose the ones that fit you the most
---
Holidays. They squeezed out last real patch I think Dec 18th, then X-Mas, then New Years, then getting over the hangover and flushing the system of chems and alcohol and junk food consumed over that period, and that brings us to this Monday. Since then, they did make a few hotfix patches (2-3) but that was for very specific things they broke. Like silos stopped working from Dec 31st to January 1st switchover. Because they apparently hard-coded a year? So that needed a hotfix. Stuff like that.
---
Supposedly (someone just said it as a reply to me) we'll get some news today. And next patch is supposedly on 15th or 22nd.
---
They never should have released the game as they did. So broken, and so close to the holidays. The half of December and half of January allowed a lot of problems to stagnate. A month without a decent update is too long when the game is this broken.
---
IS gold actually useful for something? I swear it just piles up in my stash without ever being used for anything.
---
Alright sweet, thanks for the heads up
---
Well, he's kind of a non-*playing* character if he has to stand there all day.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯   
---
Actually this makes a lot of sense now. I had a -20 ammo weight piece I could swear didn't work but now I get it. It is working all the time, equipped or not lol. I bet now if I put it in stash, effect will be gone.
---
This... This changes everything!
---
They should drop something matching the effort required to down them, though.
---
Adrenalin reaction, because it gives a crapton of weapon dmg.
---
Alien is technically flatwood monster
---
Well I don’t actually want it for the extra stash space specifically. What’s 100 lbs anyway? I just think it would be fun to be able to have an actual reason to raid camps and defend camps without it being too Rust like where you lose everything.
---
At 175 I don't have much trouble with them.. My camp is a 4 story tower with roof access 4 rocket launchers up top everything you need for a rigorous combat deployment, access is all internal and first three floors are wired flooring for easy defense from the sealed wood top floor stairway .. the roof is semiwalled with openings for downward engagement the roof itself is 3x3 roof panels so fair amount of room to breath and I'm engaging the SB's on their flight level ;) when they land I jump down near them nailing them as I drop each shot takes big chunks with the ground to throw the explosion back ... I'm at war with the SB's... I'll take them down for you bro!
---
Seriously, how long until we get a "Clean/Chrome" paint job for Power Armors?
---
My 14 lick charachter managed to get one it’s only speeced into luck and charisma tho so it’s shit at combat
---
Nuke everyone.
---
Have them wake up in a simulator in vault 96 back at level 1 with zero caps. 
---
Have enemy areas completely changed throughout the map.
---
Make whitesprings an as heap.
---
Yeah but 1 spawns, and then you'd have to move to another. That's rare compared to other enemies
---
But we will become"wanted" if we attack the camps, no?
---
Just stand still, wait till it gets to ya and start swinging your melee wapon. Worked flawlessly for me evey time and once it's dead it's body appears under your feet.
---
Got 2 a str INT and a CHArisma luck
---
I miss that gun...
---
_stares wistfully into the distance_
---
id apply for three refunds, one for my copy and the two I bought for my freinds who uninstalled and refuse to play even though it cost them nothing
---
So which would you take?
---
Yes I do! Feel free to add me in-game (TriforceOfBacon), and we can meet up so I can get you that plan! I should be online around 8pm Eastern.
---
I'll be on later if you can make me one. gt whitejerzy.. I'd appreciate  that.
---
All that's required to land scorchbeasts efficiently is a shotgun and a point or two into Enforcer. Tbh R1 is enough if that's all you really use it for.
---
Mines are pretty much shitty grenades.
---
It's only worth $50 if people are paying real $$$ for it. If majority of atom store purchases are made with credits already earnt in game (not paid for atoms), reality is it aint worth $50.
---
Yeah I lucked out and got a TSE .50 cal and one of my friends who doesn’t play anymore gave me his Tse shotgun he bought from a duper 
---
Its a nuisance but will be worth it 
---
Sure no problem 
---
L In ash heap the 3 stations have 51 mods aswell.
---
Except I looked it up and he was claiming it was new when it was pre-owned, which absolutely constitutes legal action. This was an isolated case.
---
As opposed to the dozens or eventually hundreds of sites dedicated to selling FO76 items based more than likely in China. Bethesda will probably do nothing, because like I said: too expensive and pointless if they will just open again under a new name.
---
Would be cool but the AI of fallout is not on the same level of MHW, in 76 its easy to bug enemy AI, not sure that if they added an animation for confusion would broke the SchorchBeast AI making it easier to kill
---
Information from Holotapes and notes (which I btw always read as a lore junkie) is meaningless if the game engine can't actually do the thing. 
---
The creation engine can't protect a player from area damage. Try standing in a Pullowsky shelter and blowing a car or a grenade next to it and tell me how that went, also try doing the same while in a house, or try not getting rads from Rad Rain while in a structure. 
---
I had a CAMP under the highway from Watoga to Bog Town and guess if the toxic farts cared about the meter of concrete between me and the world above - hint, they didn't. If standing in a tunnel (not talking about an overpass, an actual tunnel) beneath a highway is not trying hard enough then what is?
---
My original reply was mostly a rant at the engine though, I talked a bit harsh just because the way the engine handles area damage infuriates me.
---
Yeah precisely I just use xo1 because my charachter is enclave focused so ultra cute plans are worthless to me since you can’t trade them to vendors either
---
If you think the game was a flaming trash pile, no number of patches will fix that.
---
I have a camp at whitesprings with turrets. Didn't realize that's what I was doing. I out it there for a quick, cheap fast travel back to the bunker when I was doing those missions just haven't found a better spot. 
---
Yea I’d specifically start fights with people at there camps so I felt more raider like and had to earn it. I do think it could be a fun mechanic.
---
It more than likely is, since they're technically selling Bethesda's property without permission.
---
Yeah its only useful when you're scrapping for mods but those aren't usually the scrap you want back :-P
---
The Mayor for a Day quest. Nothing like being sonic boom spammed while taking (what feels like TSE) .308 damage from Col Gutsy's. That quest has a great payoff though with All Rise and Watoga essentially becoming a 'safe' zone.
---
If they’re not challenging or difficult to kill then kill them and move on with your day
---
can you give directions?
---
I pretty much agree with this, although I don't have an opinion on the first point (because the microtransactions \*do\* relate to cosmetic stuff, I think they can easily be ignored). In my mind, the biggest problem is still the second point. I've been told to "just reinstall the game", with the implication that many of these bugs will be magically fixed - of course, to suggest this is wishful thinking is to put the point rather too mildly. :-)
---
What I find interesting out of all this is that there \*are\* people who are having fun with the game on some level. There's definitely some stuff here to enjoy, as thin as it might ultimately be. But the bugs and other issues really get in the way of that enjoyment.
---
Having said all of that, even if - in the perfect world - all the major bugs were fixed \*now\*, I think we'd be discussing the next topic: fundamental gameplay design flaws. Those things will be tougher to fix, I imagine - although hopefully Bethesda's use of its ageing game engine will make it a lot quicker to turn around major changes/additions.
---
It doesn't work anymore? I had it in a custom.ini and I haven't noticed much back
---
When I first started playing, I thought that's what the paint cans were for. I mean, they bothered to make different colors... 
---
I blew myself up quite a few times doing this, and lost a lot of junk lol. 
---
speaking of mines, I came across a few bottlecap mines on the ground, but haven't found a way to disarm them, pick them up, or craft them.. They just blow up when you get close. Will they be implemented at some point?
---
This is brilliant. I've got a pretty cool base camp that I don't really want to disassemble, but this is making me really reconsider everything. 
---
On my first planned toon after beta I found like 15 plans/recipes, a bunch of low-level quest reward legendaries and a boatload of various ammo in the Flatwoods church cash register so now I always drop off my extra loot in that register to pay it forward. 
---
Yeah the only prime recieceivers I have are pope bolt action pistol and the pipe revolver 
---
I use it at whitesprings mostly to let everybody know where I find glowing respawns. 
---
This totally never occurred to me at all. I had my camp there for a while, but moved it as the game naturally moved me to other areas of the map. I just remember liking the clean grass and foliage. Haha
---
Ok am in 
---
You really need a TSE or at least an eexplosive shotgun if you want to be able to kill them without wanting to pull your hair out.
---
found the pay to win loser
---
Even with a Tse gauss rifle and explosive shotgun they still give me hell if I'm not prepared, I still eat through stimpacks when I fight them. 
---
Ok am in
---
I encountered my first one last night running with my level 40 friend, I’m like level 9. I just heard him telling me “daddyjeff Imma need you to run now” and I looked up and surely enough I was in Skyrim because there was a giant dragon oozing green flying my way and I just threw myself down the cliffs as fast as possible 
---
Yeah a couple mutations and a jetpack with a TSE weapon makes me fly and scream enemy ac-139 above 
---
where did you get TSE? ive got a few hundred hours now and still haven't got one, just wondering 
---
Surely once someone has a 5* legendary all these 3 and 4* TSE will be obsolete....
---
Buy them from players..going rate is a lot cheaper. Mutations are permanent with starched genes 2, although the suppression of negative effects only lasts for an hour. Negative effects can be lessened by 75% with class freak 3...and yes mutations are worth it.
---
I got killed by one by that lake in the south savage divide, spawned back in at Vault 94 and immediately got attacked by another fucking scorchbeast 
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
It sucks this game is so polarising but it's good to hear maturity when something doesn't deliver as an individual wanted.
---
Your reaction summarized:
---
**"BY THE EMPEROR..."**
---
25k ? Who the fuck set this prices up..? You got around 20 fucking caps a mission but when you want to buy something it costs this much... 
---
I think of myself as a hoarder as well but I've never ran into such big issues, whenever I ran out of space, I would just fast travel to a settlement and dump it in the workshop rather than giving it to companions since I'll either forget about it or if it's weapons they'll use them and often kill me (gave Nick a Fat Man once). 
---
I'd rather not have the proposed system, it really would just make it feel too easy. In 76, if I do actually run out of space I either soak it up for a while or make my way to a train station or in extreme cases of laziness I shell out the 30 caps and move my CAMP next to me to dump it in.

I finally found a two shot weapon...at a vendor of all things but I still use my blade of bastet at the golf resort.
---
Oh wow, I didnt know that stashing them didnt work either, I intended to do that before getting that quest, but forgot. Thats super lame, especially the given the puny rewards (minus the bos paint)
---
And the rewards aren't really worth it from what I hear
---
I built a nice camp on the river near Harpers Ferry.  90% of the time I login or travel to my camp I get placed in the water and accumulate radiation and usually get parasites.  Wasted time building this camp.
---
Unfortunately dupers have driven alot of the legit trade for them off. But you can get duped serums for 100-300 caps (its below the cost to make them really). 
---
Oh which ones? If melee, twisted muscles. For any build, speed demon and marsupial. Heaps of other good ones though. Depends on your build. Have a look here: http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_mutations
---
It’s not ‘US’ the harder players you seem to refer to that re the problem it’s the diapers that ruin pvp and the endgame by flooding the game with TSE and other broken weapons gained illegitimately 
---
They give you that mutation, so it's permanent in the same way as normal in that RadAway has a chance to remove it if you don't have the Starched Genes perk equipped.
---
The most beneficial ones will depend on your playstyle/build. You can have multiple mutations at once.

Hated is that one on the giant excavator
---
They can most definitely be killed by other players. Had a buddy leave my team and fight my Deathclaw, and he definitely killed it. It did respawn upon server hop though
---
I’m not willing to pay for a half finished game from Bethesda again.  I was hoping to see some improvements over time but I keep seeing postings of game breaking bugs and half assed content.  That is me forming my own opinion.  Once you buy the game, it’s too late.
---
I have a challenge to kill with a miners helmet. Can you please tell me where to get one?
---
You mean the Salamanders would've abandoned him just like they did my boy Grimaldus during the battle of Helsreach. 
---
This is not a PvP game, Fallout is not about teabagging.People duping/buying duped weapons will not last long before returning to fortnite.
---
yeah I use pipe weapons still as my general use weapons that 90% repair reduction is unholy I repaired one to 200% and its down to like 181% after several thousand rounds
---
now I need a pipe shotgun and the standard pipe rifle should have more ammo type receivers 
---
Been there, done that, someone got my treasures.. my precious
---
There are leaves still on perfectly-unscathed trees as well as dried leaves still laying gently on the ground every time Whitesprings get nuked.
---
I think the nukes are more huge gassy dirty bombs than actual thermonuclear weapons.
---
Melee is a back up but love my Blade of Bastet. Eats glowing ones.
---
They need a good balance pass for any endgame to work, as starters go. Adding another world boss for people to beat to death with sticks in a circle or whatnot won't add a ton. And PvP's obviously just bonkers pointless right now.
---
Alternate world bosses are the most obvious. Nuke different spots for their particular megaboss (Huntersville for Behemoth, Deathclaw island, the mirelurk queen lake up north (they do spawn elsewhere but that one has the event and stuff).
---
Raids, which the upcoming vaults are supposed to be. Of course the question there is can they present some kind of challenging mechanic. For one I'd say they need to be team instanced to keep things unbloated. But yeah, they need something other then a DPS race.
---
Settlement/Horde mode/clan base(vault?). Would take a fairly substantial shift in how they currently do servers probably. But if you could form actual groupings with permanence, and have camps overlap to form a settlement to defend. Or a separate instance like Warframe's dojo. Both a material sink to upgrade and decorate, and a potential venue for defensive gameplay modes.
---
The Reclamation begins in earnest. I guess you'd have to keep "legacy" servers running to keep the old story beat for fresh players. But having raiders/brotherhood/etc resettle in. Then you could have territory divvied up across the map between them (and a few punching bag groups for everyone like super mutants). A planetside esque affair where you join a faction and try and claim map points for them against the others. Obviously this could/should end up factoring in PvP, so its definitely post-balance pass.
---
Melee vats are a 50/50 gamble - youll most likely kill it but it'll drag you to hell too
---
There is a drop off at a certain level that gives diminishing returns and eventually the amount of atoms you gain will be reduced to a crawl.
---
Although Youtube isn't the most credible source, there have been leaks there of a loot box system. This loot box system may provide bonuses to players such as damage and xp boosts, and increased carry weight, giving some players an advantage over others. 
---
I tend to call them “cancer bats” or, more often, “fart dragons”.
---
My wife spends most of my FO76 playtime cackling at the stream of curses. 
---
Nice day for... yeah ok no (walks away)
---
Ikr and the junk to I spent around 600 caps for around 16 items
---
I've loaded into areas that took a long time to load to have enemies whacking at me. Honestly the real solution is to have your character be invulnerable during load to damage and rads, and after any input (mouse/Keyboard or controller) or after a maximum time of say.. 2 minutes, you lose said loading protection.
---
You need to use 2 point in Luck special for Starched Genes to keep them permanently. Depending on what mutation and how many you may also wan to invest 1-3 points in Class Freak Luck perk to lessen the negative effects.   
---
Currently I am running with 8 Mutations:  **Marsupial,**  **Talons,**  **Scaly skin,**  **Grounded,**  **Adrenal Reaction,**  **Electrically Charged,**  **Speed Demon, and**  **Twisted Muscles.**   
---
I also want to buy: Carnivore to buff my Cannibal perk, and Plague Walker for when I'm Diseased.   
---
The perks are completely worth the effort. If you don't buy from players you can usually get the price down to 3500 with buffs. If you play like me with many perks tho I would be prepared to use Class Freak level 3 (75% reduced negative effects of mutations).
---
   
---
The community has been asking since day one to have a (owned) bracket next to plan names. That way they can still buy them for others while knowing what they have.
---
For your second bit grab the bargain perk man never buy or sell without that bad boy. It massively cuts costs on items you buy and you can sell items for tonnes more than you could without. 
---
Very power perk to have early on in the game and just wack in on each day you do your vendor runs.
---
Your Mom Makes Venison
---
Not unless it's secretly hidden. Gunsmith doesn't affect the rate at which you get mods for guns either. No perks modify how likely you are to learn mods from scrapping items. There is supposedly a cap where you will no longer learn mods for an item, or will learn them much more slowly once you've learned a certain amount of mods for a specific equipment piece but I've seen no definite information on this 
---
The green stuff is a gas ... the whole point of it is to be the weapon it uses on someone who's just hiding inside and refuses to fight.
---
I mean players pretty much sum up the npc's of other fallouts 
---
90% of them don't talk and I can't interact with them unless I shoot them
---
5% are willing to sell me things 
---
4% say 2-3 lines then I never hear them speak again
---
1% are interesting and I actually listen to them
---
That the game launched without the pre-filled shelves/tables/etc of various Fallout 4 mods is astonishing, but maybe not that much considering it didn’t even launch with all the base pieces of vanilla FO4. I do have a bad feeling, that the empty furniture is just a way to increase our demand for an atom store release of more elaborate efforts. 
---
Plenty of budget left at my base, I'm level 122, 9 points in Charisma, still can't tame a lvl 61 Albino Deathclaw.
---
That's fine if you have the foresight to log out properly, but if you crash or get disconnected while running around not in either of those and load into a nuke zone, RIP :-(
---
Maybe they should worry about fixing their game first instead of releasing microtransactions.
---
The game sells for 60 dollars retail, it's not F2P lol
---
Plans/recipes and fast travel mostly.
---
They might not be at 25 years post war though.
---
Did you ever try taking the card off?
---
they said the next one is mid january so i'd bet that its tuesday january 15th
---
I _never_ log at Whitespring unless it’s a crash. I learned that lesson because I crashed at whitespring while shopping and when I loaded back it was a nuke zone. So many rads that I died _after_ I already made it back inside. 
---
Look. My experience says otherwise. Getting under good protection helps. A pile of junk isn’t good protection. 
---
Me and my friends all share the same experience. 
---
We’ve hid in tunnels. If your near the entrance you’ll take some damage. If they are deep enough you won’t take damage or it’s a little. 
---
It’s hard to tell because sometimes they do both attacks. And the acid attack isn’t stopped, like several people said.
---
If you stand to close to the opening or doorway or windows, it’s going to hit you. 
---
Once we took shelter in a guard post. No doors just doorways and a window with no glass. Wasn’t helping. So we ran for it and came across Alpha site building do we ran in. We shut the door and crouched. The scorched spammed the sonic attack for about 30 seconds. Eventually it went away. We didn’t take any damage.
---
We’ve done this countless times while being too low a level to kill them. 
---
Your anger isn’t going to replace the facts I’ve seen for myself.  
---
Yeah I got killed three or four times while trying to retrieve my lunch bag. They remained hostile each time I respawned.
---
Pvp is not about tea bagging people if that is your experience with the game then I’m very sorry that you feel that way but one of the main selling points of the game was ‘fallout with PVP’ it is almost entirely ruined by duper’s running round murdering everything in sight including you if they take the slightest dislike to you
---
I have two questions:
---
- What / where is that mask?
---
- Where can one find plans for that Vault Boy stone statue?
---
I have all of these things, and it doesn't matter. I couldnt farm a blast zone for 10 minutes. 
---
**possibly tamed  robot*** someone else try this as I have not had prompt happen again or found robot in the area again :: Both animal and creature cards maxed out so charisma -6 my intelligence is already maxed out so maxed robot card plus add  science wizard -1 -2 and- 3  maxed out also with home defense added in..found robot on road near the abandoned town down from watoga..lvl 42 protectron ...had option to pacify and as I did it scorchbeast showed up outta no where , send to base prompt came up and "boom" crashed right to home screen...could have been a glitch or luck but dialogue box flashed for a sec before dc..
---
.
---
I've found other ways of doing things for taming and what not so I'm trying tons of different combos all the time but I think some things we havnt found out are related to different perk combo sets just like the way if u want to use a flame trap in ur camp u have to have flame proof card with science with home defense in there in different categories....so there might be other options to figure out in the perk card set to have different options pop up ..
---
I'm a shotgun build but I put it away at Whitesprings ever since I got a bloodied fire axe with swing speed. That thing is almost just as broken, if I was melee spec'd that would be even better I bet
---
"Nearly" the same = still cost pretty much the same as making something entirely unrelated from scratch. Fitting animations to a new disproportionate skeleton isn't really any easier than just making new ones.
---
Other games have used a "ReImagined" world and wiped ... and are still profitable and doing well. 
---
To do so they have to FIX the problems and ensure they will not reoccur because you can't do this more than once ...
---
You will have serious blow back but if you coat the 'pile' with enough sugar most will swallow it. Because let's face it, many want the game to survive and progress but without the issues from the duping/exploits.
---
Some will leave, others will join ... that is normal. 
---
That's the one. I still use All Rise, too. It's a brilliant weapon. 
---
So if anyone is trying to figure out how to farm white springs nuked zone.
---
Here are my bits of advice 
---
1. Tesla gun WITH PACIFIST MODE
---
2. If your using power armor get the pain train perk.
---
I just found T51b Optimized brazers at the Welch station vendor.   
---
I will trade/sell it as I dont really have much use for it at level 25
---
Radaway is 6 on my hotkeys because of situations like this. 
---
150 cap bounty oughta pay for it :-)
---
there is actually a ton of decor items in whitespring shop but the main problem is less choices then the fact we need a more balanced camp system 
---
we need a 3 stat camp system that has 3 bars instead of 1 - Camp Infrastructure (walls floors stairs resource producers) - Camp Defense (turrets traps ect) - Camp Decor 
---
by Splitting the 3 categories it makes camp defense the major massive budget buster of camp design separate and allows for better designed camps and with a decor budget players would not feel like decor is 1 less good item they could use 
---
The prices are fine, but not being able to see what you own sucks
---
Are u on xbox?
---
I think Bethesda probably cares, but it takes time for them to make changes and add stuff. A watch pot never boils, you know? Although they may have overestimated everyone's patience.   
---
To answer your question, my endgame consisted of maxing out mods, perfecting my build, building an x-01, and trying to make the Welcome to Flatwoods sign say "Welcome to Flatboobs."  
---
Apparently it does still work. I’d changed it in the same place as last time, just went and changed it everywhere, the one in the fallout 76 game directory is the one that worked. The other location(s) were the fallout76.ini and fallout76prefs.ini in the documents folder.
---
“bAllowCreateGrass=0”
---
Under the [Grass] subsection.
---
Gives a nice FPS boost also
---
Please! 51% of my budget eaten up by this bug...
---
Or maybe you just have a terrible character for sneak? I can leave them behind just fine. I'm more than fast enough for them to get distracted by another beastie and leave the area before they can catch up.
---
You bought the mod, NOT the plans. That's only showing you what it would cost if you could craft it. You can just attach the mod without using any resources.
---
As for why it's missing, you're probably a victim of the scrapping issue. Mods have resources in them and the game will automatically scrap them if you run out of other sources for them while crafting/building.
---
This is purely subjective to your style of play. 
---
It is a very open ended question without more data to help you navigate.
---
\#3 is a brilliant LPT. Even if it doesn't help.
---
I've seen rats, cats, and mongrels following eyebots.  
---
... not at the same time, obviously.
---
Ok, now that is surprising... I suppose I could collect junk for a couple weeks, keep creating and scrapping legs and hope to learn the calibrated shocks!
---
I think it does decrease the damage but all of them would have the explosive effect so it could be like a long range shotgun 
---
Yea it's rediculous
---
Explosive doesn’t work on energy weapons 
---
And they can still do that.  It would only apply to junk and 5k is plenty to run a shop with.
---
Thats caps.
---
Gold scrap is a resource. Which you can mine at workshops (or get from junk). I got no idea what its used to build though.
---
Yes indubitably, I too have seen this extraordinary creature, tubulus doggus, and can concur it's extreme voracious intent with instilling fear and dismay into young travelers. 
---
I advise the original posters strategy and thank you for raising awareness of this deadly specimen. Kudos. 
---
Selling decent legendaries to them reminds me of pawn stars, where the appraiser comes in and says this piece is worth 5000, then that doofus says the best I can do is buy it for 200. 
---
Come back later and you see that piece prominently displayed in the window on sale for 75000.
---
Yea, right, it's not. The "experience" in Fallout is exploring, story, crafting, building, PvP was added as a small mini-game, probably to fill a checkbox from a management suit who never even played a computer game.
---
I cripple their wings and they don’t land. Please advise.
---
I completely agree, actually the same could be said about the queen too. Anymore as soon as one comes up, I just server hop out of there and continue on with what I was doing.
---
\*Mario sounds intensifies\*
---
Not really a problem.  I'm running 105-110/235 with 6k 5.56 rounds with only a few points in Str.
---
My x-01 is fully pumped out, (I spend hours looking for the carryweight mod whatever it’s called) but I’ve heard of people talking about making a “murder church” in flatwoods or Morgantown
---
I have an explosive (non-TS) laser rifle and put a splitter on it, it just still sucks.
---
Do you mean that effect doesn't do anything?
---
 That's why I carrying tesla. 
---
or maybe you enjoy the game but can't beat end game content without op legendaries or you already have and it's the only thong that gives rewards in a reasonable amount of time?
---
Well like I said I like the game and hope it would succeed but it’s been getting a lot of bad press and duper’s are ruining the game at the moment I just hope the game gets better after this dlc and they add more endgame content
---
I ran into a Level 14 in the church in Flatwoods yesterday and tried to give away a bunch of stuff.  They ran away.  Not being easily daunted, I chased them down and found them crafting.  I dropped a bag and backed up to watch.  They got done crafting and ran over the bag without pausing.
---
Up north I found a Level 40-something guy's camp with unlocked water purifiers.  I took a couple of waters, turned around, and the guy was looking at me.  I dropped a bag of goodies in the grass, but it fell through the world.  I then went up to his foundation and dropped another bag, left, came back 20 minutes later, and the guy was gone.. bag was still there.  I repo'd the bag and then continued onward.
---
I fear our efforts of gift-giving may mostly be in vain sometimes.  :(
---
Surprised no one has said it but I prefer the Munitions Factory. It just happens to kick me once I get it up and running. Don't take many of them, but I've tried Spruce Knob and didn't like it much
---
I still see the visual explosion when i shoot the laser rifle
---
I was thinking they could give a glowing edge highlight/glow to corpses, meat piles, junk bags to make them easier to locate. Then when the item has been looted the glow goes away.
---
Not being able to find your loot in a target rich environment is infuriating at times.
---
All you do is the Powering Up Poseidon event. As a reward you can the plans, you have to do it 3 times.
---
Exactly! And if you can get a two shot version, even better!! (Not explosive though... it's strong, but fuck explosives!!)
---
The ammo doesn't drop often but it's cheap as fuck; no perks still gets 100 rounds per craft at pretty much the same material cost of any other, which float around 10-20 per craft.
---
It will for sure get better
---
&gt;I BET YOU HAVE NO PLAY TIME UNDER YOUR BELT
---
VS
---
&gt;WHY HAVE YOU PLAYED SO MUCH IF YOU DISLIKE THE GAME
---
There is no fucking winning against you morons and your mental gymnastics.
---
I use  gold and cloth to make the civil war outfit,which i can resell for either 15 or 22 caps depending on which perks i have
---
Yeah it’s an random even there near an overpass. Like the responder corpse that spawns with witch costume dress in her inventory. 
---
There’s quests that give more than 20 caps. No I’m not giving a list. While caps aren’t flowing from the tap in this game, they also aren’t hard to get.
---
Heck you could just collect junk and such and sell that and clean out each vendor everyday to earn 1400 caps every 20 hours. Taking about 18 days to get enough. 
---
Not hard. 
---
Explosive works on a tesla. I swapped the semi auto for a charging shotgun. It is pretty sweet. 
---
Yeah and it’s not like when private servers come out I’ll be able to use mods for quite some time because I’m on console :(
---
Squeakers driving you nuts, eh?
---
I had a Red Tactical for the T-60 and used it on my level 40 set. 
---
Found the BRIGHT for T-60 and put that into my level 50 set.
---
It is definitely what you are looking for. I think the whole region can tell where I am.
---
Oh hell yeah!!! I'm pretty low level and have been having real trouble finding stims right now.  Been doing higher level zones and burning through them.  I have 300 caps, I'll take 150 of them if you'll sell it to me lol.
---
My GT is midnight3896, send me a message and we can link up.
---
Yeah probably auto-scrapped when crafting/repairing something.
---
If that was ur opinion on this game I highly doubt a couple updates will change ur opinion.  In my book Once u r piece of shit always a piece of shit u will b.

I'm a 32 y/o gamer. I'm not on right now, but feel free to add me. GT: JetNukaGirl76

It’s got a rocket on it, just attach some wings too 😜
---
I leave my extra stuff in the blue suitcase.
---
It’ll  finally give me a reason to lock my door. Haha. Hopefully they get the bounty before they make it to the safe. But if you have an empty safe just throw it out front with no lock.
---
The is a really cool idea. At my job, we have Amish vendors who come in regularly. They do use a card swipe tool with an iPad out of necessity, so using the C.A.M.P. device can still work.
---
I have a character I make in a lot of games that I use just fur hunting/fishing. I ignore the storyline and fighting any humanoid creatures when I can.
---
My camp is very basic. A small tent, bed, a fire wth cooking pot, and a chair. Any work benches stay stored until I need them.
---
Lucky ducky it's the only wall plans that elude me. Picked one up a month ago but of course it was the advanced power connectors. Haven't seen the plans since then. 
---
The need flat space to land in. They won’t land on inclines or in areas with trees. 
---
Fair enough.. Since I allways run around in that, its not really an issue:)
---
I just avoid them anyway they aren’t worth the resources required to take down.
---
300 ish is probably what they are actually worth, if you have the recipe the most expensive component is a stable flux.
---
Yeh, it sounds like you've reached the end of the road, content-wise. Now, you have to make your own fun with the power of imagination \*rainbow\*. 
---
There is no Jet Pack Plan only the mod exists. And mods are bugged to behave like bulked items. The get scrapped if you need resources they contain. Even if held in the stash. Sorry but you just lost the Jet Pack and have to farm it again. Also to put salt on the wound mods don't cost any materials to be applied. The list of materials on the right is just informative not a requirement. Bethesda went the extra mild to confuse people.
---
The plans are but it's something like a 1 in 4 chance. 
---
The #1 reason I've stopped playing entirely and just lurk this sub until the game is fixed.
---
Move your shit 
---
me too!  and the moles/ghouls would get trapped inside a bubble and floated away.  :)
---
Only if you get the balsamic reduction on top. And I've got a friend that will add effing bacon to the thing. 
---
Has anyone else noticed an uptick of ScorchBeast attacks for defending the Converted Munitions Factory?  It used to be mole rats, wolfs, and sometimes Scorched.  But lately it’s been 2-3 ScorchBeasts and of course the munitions factory conveniently stops producing ammo during the event.  If it weren’t for that, I’d gladly crouch in acidic bat guano all day long so long as it meant I’d get my desired ammo type at the moment.
---
Are you new to the internet?
---
Is 'Begs the question' not a common phrase where you're from? 
---
What is there to win ? Idiots bashed the game just to hate and people called them out.
---
Exactly, I don’t lock my door because there’s nothing to protect so I don’t care atm if Goldilocks comes in and sleeps in my bed, makes some corn soup, and uses the weapons bench. 
---
Sooo we have proof that the community is not a hive mind. But individuals with different thoughts and opinions lol.
---
You can also read that the earth is flat. Rent the game. Lol. Make your own opinion. 
---
Omg now I really want to cosplay as an Ultramarine in FO76. Did you get a screenshot of what they were wearing?
---
Except you just pulled that idea out of your ass based on no data or evidence whatsoever. It does a strafing run with the gas regularly, out in the open in the Bog, with no one "hiding inside" anywhere. So no.
---
Fun fact,at around level 15-16, me and my friend who was level 4 at the time,got jumped by, not one,but TWO Scorchbeasts. I wasn't very observant to see their level,but my friend said level 80. It may be a bug/glitch, or because my luck was,and still is, at 1. :)
---
"Do you see the contradiction you intentionally wrote!?"   
---
People, man... 
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Eye twitching..I know this and I have done each of them over 10 times and it still won’t give it
---
1) We just got done with a long holiday break, so anything they noted in that period hasn't even hit the "how do we implement this" phase yet.
---
2) Most of the changes aren't as simple as flipping a number in the code, so it's going to take time for them to plan out, code and test before pushing out.
---
Yes 60 dollars. But how many 60 dollar games have free DLC?
---
My husband builds his camp there. No turrets. It's mostly a place for people to have quick access to fix weapons and drop loot.
---
Damm sorry man
---
explosive legendary affix is just changing energy weapon damage type but not increase damage. also cannot gain benefits from Demolition Expert. it is why all 2se energy weapons are sucks. i think none-legendary version is much better than explosive version.
---
Good to know for the future!  Thanks!

---
Oh boy here we go again.
---
I've found most of my disconnects seem to happen right after I've built some stuff in recently claimed workshops.  Not sure if it's coincidental timing or doing a lotta building makes it more likely I'll get booted, or what's happening.
---
I ended up making a blueprint of a 4x4 building with crafting stations and another of a 2x1 cabin with generators, so I can just slap them down immediately after claiming.  So even if I get disconnected shortly after, at least I didn't spend all that time setting them up, and it leaves a convenient crafting area for whoever comes in after me.
---
Am I the only lucky one, who got this plan 3 times already (one I've learned, other two sold for 500 caps each)? ;P
---
You're probably looking for the sturdy/heavy version of the raider armor.  
---
They are pretty rare and the only way to check if it's a sturdy or heavy version of a raider armor , you need to check their weight or wear them.
---
There's also the trapper armor which has spikes.
---
As far as I know they've only got one piece of full armour in the game (the Garb of Mysteries). I don't think cage and spike armour exist as costumes. Maybe they'll turn up in the Atom Store for a mere 900 Atom Caps each. There's a lot of clothing from Fallout 4 that I have yet to see.
---
No ?
---
You reach a point when you either A) stop buying plans because you don't know what you have or B) gamble and buy plans, wasting caps.   
---
I've stopped buying plans till they add the fix. 
---
lol, I see PA shells all over whitesprings, and it looks like the rapture just happened
---
People farm ghouls for legendarys to kill ghouls faster for more legendarys? What’s the point ? ;)
---
Lol... Why did you edit out your own username for the screen shot? Didn't want people to realize you're just whining about getting downvoted?
---
Yup, I ran into this in beta. The "wolf pack" event in The Forest popped, I went through the whole thing, and then the end-boss glitched just like this. Only I couldn't even hit it with VATS or AOE spam. I wound up running like hell until someone else in power armor came along and apparently managed to kill it. I got the Event rewards, but couldn't even find the body to try an loot it.
---
I came across one just out of blast radius aiming missile turrets into the back door of the clubhouse. I just shut the door and killed all the ghouls before they could get to it. Lol. Cheeky af move. So obvious a farming plan. 
---
Glad to know I'm not the only one blowing that shit up!
---
Lol. I usually put mine in the lunch pale. Excess bulk items, plans, and the occasional weapon or armor. 
---
If people like Aliens: Colonial Marines and they think it's a good game who is anyone to stop them. What people forget is games are purely subjective for the most part. I played A:CM with a mate and hit a game breaking issue on the first level so I know it's issues but I don't think issues should directly impact quality; Don't get that confused with saying issues are good or that it can't effect quality. It does but most issues these days are fixed with a patch. 
---
I got a Two-Shot Fatman yesterday. lol
---
the explosive prefix does work on energy weapons, but it's... odd. first, the laser disappears, and I don't know if it's just a visual bug or it doesn't deal energy damage at all. second, compared to literally every other non-energy weapon, the damage sucks.
---
I did put a splitter on mine and it works as a shotgun, kinda. it has less "pellets" than an actual one (4/5 compared to 7/8) but the range is nice. the problem, other than the damage, is that it breaks before you can even empty the 30 rounds.
---
Go to west tek (fast travel, go around building to back entrance) go collect as much toxic goo as you can carry. Then start drinking it. Theres a decon arch in the building, just drink and jump in to reset rads. The tricky part is going for 2+ mutations, having to constantly swap on and off starched genes.
---
This defense has been used mainly in this subreddit to defend the extremely broken state of the game. Every one bitching about the bugs and poor state of the game has been labeled as doing it "just to hate" (as even shown by /u/ArmaTM in this thread). At the start people compiled bugs and now it seems people have just given up hope that the majority of bugs will be fixed soon as shown but the slow rate we get the updates.
---
Definitely understand that. I didn't play ESO but I was working at GameStop at the time of it's release and heard so much backlash.. it seems to have gotten better now so I'm hoping 76 has the same fate
---
What if, like i do, have a basic camp at the course? No torrents, or walls just a stash box and benches for everyone to use. Would you destroy that?
---
What do you want people to tell you? "Oh man, we are soooo sowwy that you don't like the game! Oh, sweetie, it's just a shame! Poor poor guy!"
---
We get it. You don't like the game. I don't understand the need you feel to post it on the Internet. I don't like many games, but I don't go to their forums to tell them that - because they don't give a shit, and I don't give a shit.
---
Bat rend!
---
it's a popular spot. but it does feel like Bethesda keeps nerfing popular spots with each new update, yeah.
---
Most of locations in Cranberry Bog got a spot or even several where Marine armor, marine helmet or marine/bos underarmor plans can spawn. Lost Home, Abandoned Train Station, NAR Repair Yard, Ranger District Office, Camp Venture, Pylon V-13, Drop Sites. I keep finding armor plans in all of these locations regulary. You can also try Harper's Ferry but it's a longshot given how popular that spot is.
---
You probably just saw the normal one, the bright excavator lamp isn't in the game files right now.
---
Arnt they worried about getting nuked 
---
So me thinking this game equals the bugs and quality of a Early Access survival game on Steam means im just doing it "to hate" and how would my play time "call me out" on that?
---
Even if you completed all objectives. You still can earn 500-600 atoms a week by completing the dailys and tgr weekly.  
---
I don't have them all, but it must be close.  There's at least one that I've read about that I don't have, but I do have many that 3rd party Fallout 76 web sites with long lists of recipes don't have.  Right now I've got 142 drink and food recipes.
---
Nah, wrong. There were and still are constructive criticisms from legit players and the before-mentioned idiots who just hate.
---
I’m only level 17 but as a melee character I’m probably gonna have a bad time
---
BROKEN LEG! WASTING MUNITORIUM RESOURCES TO SUSTAIN YOUR LIFE!??! LEAVING!!!!???  GUARDSMAN BACK TO THE FRONT YOU ARE GOING TO EARN EVERY PRECIOUS DROP OF THOSE STIMPACKS! -commissar
---
i ended up spawning like this yesterday! 
---
And we could get a mod for the Gamma Gun that turns it into a sonic emitter which disorients the Scorchbeast when shot forcing it to land. Only affecting the Scorchbeast in that way otherwise it has a knock back effect for other enemies.
---
&gt; you're just whining about getting downvoted?
---
The fact that you think that's why i posted this really shows what kind of people are left on this sub LMAO.
---
They still respawn for me but it takes a few server hops. There is definitely a timer for individuals on them as well between respawns.
---
Its easier
---
Yeah I'm still trying for ultracite leg plans and mods. I swear all I get are ultracite rusty nails and explosive vents cause I got 10 of each lol 
---
You can farm nuke silos for weights in the exercise room. 
---
You thread was moronic from the start, not even going to continue bothering with you.
---
At end game it currently turns into Minecraft
---
&gt;Melee weapon
---
Cheessburgercake shows in his youtube videos  Melee weapon's doing 15-20k DMG, and you are complaining about a max out, like the gauss at 1700DMG ? like i have said 100 times before, everyone looks at things going "BOOM" and just dont car less about the real problems with weapons, like  Melee.
---
He takes down a SBQ in less than 30 seconds... the SBQ just laughs at my gauss... (witch is accaly not duped)...
---
&gt; the before-mentioned idiots who just hate.
---
Damn those people making like a 30 row thread showcasing what the dislike the game for were really going deep on the "just hate" thing i guess.
---
Sounds evil. New players won't know what those are for and will pick them up because, well, they might need it maybe whatever it is for. 
---
Will probably be weeks until they figure out all their weight is stuck in the ammo tab
---
K precious.
---
I've sent request
---
“One-shot race with zero strategy” - thanks duper’s 
---
Like bringing a baby home from the hospital, then leaving it to go to Disneyland for a week. 
---
Have been. All those and Charleston have been empty since I cleared them Monday. 
---
Maybe I’m bugged. 
---
Yes. Fallout 4 decor needs to be imported over. I miss those Lounge couches with metal frames and the  counters ;-;
---
How? I couldn't pick up any of the ingredients to load into the purification machine.
---
Oh dear, nope not ran into him yet.
---
I've had a few quest where I've had to wait around for the story line leading to the quests but nothing too long or boring that I can't cope with.
---
The only problem I have with the tapes is sometimes I collect the with out noticing them and forget to press play 
---
So what if i tell you that you need to try really hard to survive the fact that people dislike the game and actually see WHY the dislike the game. A huge number of people are bitching about simple things like, shit rewards at high levels, broken mechanics and so on. I can assure you its not that hard to change the drops on a mob and yet after all this time its not fixed... Why shouldn't people be mad at that?
---
I can at least confirm that people can take stuff you put in the overseer's cache in flatwoods. I put a bunch of ammo, meds, plans, recipes, and grenades in it. A lvl 100 something watched me do it. So while I went sell to the vendor, he picked through it, taking nearly everything. I said in prox chat I left that for new low lvls. He ignored me and left. No way he needed any of that stuff. Degenerate vulture.
---
Sadly this seems to be a fairly common effect of the internet, magnified the more niche the website/ subreddit. Everything must be one extreme or the other. You can't enjoy it but have complaints. You either love it and it is totally perfect and all complaints are lies or you hate it and it is the greatest betrayal of all time and you will never trust again and your future grandchildren will die of cancer because it existed.
---
I bought it on sale, and have already got hours of fun out of it. I think it definitely needed more time and thought before release.
---
What does grounded do? I'm doing a similar build
---
 *could list a bunch of good ones, but honestly, you'll find that changing your perk load will be something that you do frequently.  You'll realize were your weaknesses are, and perks can help.  I was completely Melee for a long time. I put most of my perks into weight reduction too. Now that im better at managing inventory, I've been choosing perks for other things like max rifle damage (stacked). Im also looking into radiation reduction perks so i dont need all those Rad chems etc.  You can have perks that you'll place just to build a tier 5 weapon, and then put your original perk back.*
---
The real beauty in this game is that there is always learning and modifying and adapting.  quite gratifying and always changing.
---
SO, to answer your question, ask yourself what is most annoying to you? is it weapon power, need for food/water all the time, rad damage, weight etc...then just go for it.  It will change as you play. no need for templates. :)
---
I can give you a second try. TIP: The text the thread might help.
---
I would and I have.
---
Honestly I try to find actual players to give stuff to instead but I don't blame them for running away from a lvl 140 in Mothman ritual bindings who just shows up out of nowhere offering them stuff.
---
Ha, I knew it was something.....I'm old now, it's hard to remember 12 years ago. Thanks for the clarification 
---
hmm...it reminds me of hair metal :)  they need the matching hair style with feathered bangs thats almost a huge hair spray mullet but not quite :)
---
more likely people are just beating you to places doing the same thing. Can't help but think they should put a time limiter on the third server jump and onward. 
---
"Only 400"
---
It beats them at both.   
---
Yes, guns should be more powerful. We know this.   
---
These are automatic weapons, too. So you get a full bar of crits, rather than single crits.   
---
Seriously, melee's disadvantage is that it's melee. There's no cover, no avoiding damage, nothing. You're suggesting that ranged weaponry should be both MORE powerful, MORE effective at both close range and long range and suggesting there's nothing unbalanced about instantly killing most things. 
---
Jumpy Bois only :P
---
How much is the recipe for the mutations 
---
Jesus Christ, thank you. Not just Cranberry Bog, but other places make me lose loot really quickly lol. 
---
You're aware that he's stacking bobbleheads, which can be done with Ranged weapons too, right? 
---
I mean he could probably do so faster if he duped the Heavy Weapons one... 
---
+100 energy resistance -50% energy weapon dmg and since energy weapons are trash is basically free dmg resistance
---
Not realy, closer to 40ish level you'll have enough resources and perks to simply tank the damage and wait till they land, then you'll fuck em up. 
---
The only major pain in the ass is their ability to destroy your armor, sonic attack does is quite fast, but with White Knight perk maxed out you'll be fine.
---
You're right about people reaching level 50 in the beta. I forgot about that. Maybe 100 then?  i dunno. 
---
The thing is, postponing new content might make people lose interest in the game.
---
Im level 73 and at this point the things left to do are events, treasure maps and discovering some random spots here and there.
---
I have the same problem with some water purifiers that I still can't scrap taking up 3% of my budget lol
---
Holy fuck its like you and the guy in my screenshot are the same dude.
---
&gt;You playd too little
---
Nah i played a lot
---
&gt;Wow you played a game you dont like moron
---
nah man i wanted to see it all
---
&gt;im not gonna reply anymore u clearly moron
---
LMAO
---
I see why they dislike the game. I dislike some things about it too.
---
What I'm saying is that there's a clear difference between constructive criticism (what you are talking about now), which is good, and "omg dis gaem so trash mang!!1!1"
---
Just the logic of it alone would be dozens of lines per junk item. How many junk items in game times a dozen... Not saying it would be difficult, just not literally as easy as 5 lines to add.
---
I know which one I'm getting next
---
You get those too?
---
Why man? I feel that's a real team player move to do. 
---
Community managers are supposed to interact with all facets of the community in a positive way. They aren’t just an automated complaint box. 
---
There is no challenge or trick to killing them, they are just big damage sponges that eat 500-800 .50cal from a Browning, and don't recompensate you for your losses, the XP is arguable in terms of value but when you're level 70+ its not really worth it, killing Wendigos is more worthwhile.
---
Dont do this; https://youtu.be/D9BnIbqThCE
---
Hair metal to me.
---
Im not going to lie...if they had something that was pink or purple and shot rainbows out of my jetpack...OMG I would be on that so fast!  I would lose my mind with excitement.
---
I dont run in metal armor though so even though the pink in this appeals to me I didnt buy it.  Im hoarding ATOMS just in case of above mentioned item ever being made :)   And please make it for all armor!  
---
You don't.
---
They do read these subreddits so if you post here and it’s popular or the timing is right they may see it.
---
Don't remember where I got the statue but most of my decorations came from the shop in whitesprings. And the mask is the Mr. Fuzzy head, you get it as a trade in reward from doing the daily quests at Camden Park
---
Bad luck then cause PS4 :/ 
---

---
There should be a warning of some kind, a sporting chance. Instead of making them a flat 2 mins, maybe proximity from the silo should be a factor. Some are longer to get there while others are much shorter.
---
Id gladly take a bicentennial paint job Im really kicking myself for not waiting and getting to pay the same amount.
---
Baa bee sloths do do do do do do
---
You should probably focus your time on other games. This game is obviously not for you.
---
I'm from the US, so yeah, people use it wrong all the time. "Begs the question" does not mean "raises the question."
---
Hmm maybe that one, but even then, the ones i discovered so far didnt deal much damage tbh.
---
Plasma and laser guns need a serious boost in this game. And melee a slight nerf.
---
Okay thanks.
---
Depends upon your character build and the legendary effects of a particular melee weapon your holding on to.
---
Yeah, I've been reading about the splitter mod's disadvantage being the rate, at which gun breaks... What about the fire rate, actually, is it wise to have an automatic receiver, or leave it at semi-auto - which is best for "Exploding bullets" effect?
---
Don't you mean a the legendary looooooong dooooooog?
---
Honestly most comments are going to be negative but I feel as if the best way to get something across to Bethesda would be an email to all of their offices ahahah. If they see it enough they will take it for their own. 
---
I'd like a way to go cyborg somewhere down the line in a DLC, maybe when CDPR's Cyberpunk launch.
---
After the last update/patch I have noticed that about 90% of all containers I come across are always empty.
---
I can wait a day or tow in real time and they just never refill.
---
I do think the respawning of items and loot has been significantly reduced.
---
I've been in on killing the queen six times in the last two days...Four times I literally got zero rewards ( stood at her body until it disappeared) The two rewards I got was a Mutant's lead pipe and a Mutant Slayer's Golf Club... both 1\*.  Totally worth it.

I found two explosive bobbleheads last night and they both stacked. Unless you mean two different ones, then I don’t think so.

Hehe that's about par for me and legendaries 😂 back to farming my 93rd vanguard marine right leg.

That is part of the Mr Fuzzy outfit you get from doing the Camden Park dailies. It costs a bunch of points to buy so you have to grind it. You only get 3 tokens every time you do it.

Actually they continuously spawn at fissure sites. if you approach a site and no SB is up, it'll shit one out for you to fight, if you kill that and AFK for a minute, another will shit out, makes the SBQ so much more frustrating after she's dead.
---
Okat thanks. Where do i get that info for there email. In their website?
---
Nah man my constructive criticism is basically "The game fucked up my character and now he weights a lot with no items on." and thats still not fixed. Constructive or not it seems like it will not get fixed.
---
Why  can't a nuke just singe the grass down? I  believe that is what would be the least would happen in the event of a real one. 
---
Your supposed to become overpowered in games like this. You become OP farm. Newer Harder Difficulty comes and rinse repeat Formula.

TSE in close range is dangerous I kill my Sell 10 to 20 times a day because of it. And Melee in close range is op and can beat TSE.

The only reason it has "free DLC" because if it had paid DLC the map expansions would fucking split the player pool and no one would be playing them. 
---
Don’t waste your time, you’re just talking to brick walls. Your post is absolutely correct imo, flexibility is good, but the current system is just stupid. They might as well have just given us infinite slots at this point, switching out anytime is practically the same thing.

Perhaps when the compound bow comes out we could use it’s bones for arrow tips?

LOL.  I stumbled through Lewisburg with a team and we killed the super mutants.  I saw that pretty pond by the train station and immediately made a camp.  I have never lived somewhere so shortly!  It was under siege constantly.  Funny between the mire lurks and supernatants and SB that I even had time to throw up a quick camp!

Get stealth perk tier 3 plus the perk that allows you to be stealthy while running and losing aggro as soon as you crouch.

You won't have any more problems with that mofos.

You can easily just walk directly under several scorch beasts and they will ignore you.

I will. Im at work right now so don't have time to type all what I have to say out.

I switched to auto but the damage got even worse. leave it as a semi.

I agree with the comments.  I have bought nearly all the plans and have double bought around 30 times, which sucks.  I do a circuit of the 7 easy vendirs most every day, selling to get the 200 caps then buying and selling a bit more to offset.  Repeating as I go.  So minus travel and not buying I could be +1400 caps a day.  Every new speaking lower level I meet, I help showing them any missing vendors they could access, depending on progress.  If there's a Whitespring Nuke, I pick all flowers I can and give these to sell as they are so light and so valuable.  Took someone from 500 caps to 1500 last night doing this in 15 mins.

Hmmm interesting. I never had an issue after my above description. But who knows with this game. It’s a roulette on what user experience you’re going to get most of the time.

Probably won't get past the first death robot. Unless its an eyebot.

---
There's nothing remotely threatening or scary about them after you hit level 40 if your build is decent. They become annoying, I still genuinely fear some deathclaws or wendigos more than those things.  
---
In the end we're forced to kill them because if you run from they stay aggro'd for stupidly long periods of time (which is explained in lore) but you CANT take cover from them in tight spaces like the lore says because their sonic attack is broken as fuck.
---
This is correct. This sub reddit is actually the main communication platform between gamers and Bethesda. They have responded to some posts. If the idea is good, plausible and gets upvotes, i bet they'll read it. My advise is, instead of writing that idea to Bethesda, write it for gamers and they will upvote it for visibility. :)
---
I follow the Fallout twitter. They will post the new issue there. 
---
&gt; Sadly this seems to be a fairly common effect of the internet, magnified the more niche the website/ subreddit.
---
Its not really true. When PUBG came out people defended everything about how broken it is (and imagine how dying to a bug after 20-30 minutes of looting feels like). "The devs are not enough, the engine is shit, well its EARLY ACCESS" and so on. 
---
&gt;I bought it on sale, and have already got hours of fun out of it. I think it definitely needed more time and thought before release.
---
And we can all agree that if they left if in the oven for more time and ironed all the balance/bugs this game could have been "normal" and not the thing wee got now. Why does saying that mean its "just hate".
---
Yeah, it's never locked either. Nuke destroys it plenty though lol he started to hop off before it hits then back in after so it stands a chance.
---
lololololo ahahahaha! I died when I saw that 75000.... So true. Glad I'm not alone in thinking the vending prices are outrageous. 
---
Same. I love the gun but it's dicey. God forbid I aim incorrectly and hit anything near me. Happens a lot.

Last night my brothers and I kept him alive and were rejoining the server to refresh his loot. It seems like the Winter jacket/jeans, Longshoreman Outfit, and Hunters Longcoat are the most rare on the vendor. There are some here that are hard to find through out the map or maybe only dirty/different color variations in the map but those three appear to be the most unique on the vendor. I'm unsure of the ski outfit variation colors but I'm pretty sure the grey fishermans outfit may be unique to him as well? I know Fisherman's outfit can be found through out the map and is sold by a Whitespring vendor just not sure if it was the grey one or not. Just trying to collect some stuff before they add the player vendor updates and it gets to crazy to farm. I feel like people have been purposely putting a camp down at the shack to keep people from spawning him unfortunately.

Go into the church in Helvetia and you should find a miner's helmet on one of the corpses sitting in the pews.

His early videos of this was long before the bobblehead thing was publicly known or talked about, so not so sure about that.
---
I am never going to use a bobblehead for this, at about 1700 DMG it's perfect for me..
---
Btw, stacking bobbleheads for explosive on a TSE is no use on the SBQ, she has about 80% to explosives..
---
Only Poseidon gives the plans. And you have to do the actual "powering up" quest, not just capture  the workshop. 
---
We need Teddy Bear or some such cuddly armor skins with still very high resists across the board, so we can not be too squishy but not scare the low level players out of their skins when we approach them :)
---
Fortnight has some cute skins, Bethesda give us cute *furry* armor for the Samaritans. Furry armor to drive anti-furies to distraction would be big lols.

as an aside, I need to figure out how to make pepperoni rolls for my wife.  We get them from a place in Nutter Fort whenever we're in (my wife is from WV), but there is absolutely no where to get them where we live (east of Baltimore).  I was going to make a batch of them for her for Christmas, but never got around to it.   You have inspired me to find the motivation to make them.

---
Okay, if you believe that, it's clear that you don't complain here to give visibility to the bugs and get them fixed.
---
So why do you do it? For attention? In an outburst of teenage angst? I don't understand.
---
My favorite part about it is when the game spawns 3 scorched beast at once in the middle of nowhere. Not a fissure for miles and all of a sudden you're getting wrecked by spamming beasts. I just quit the server and log back in when I see them now. Hopefully this post gets read by someone important at bethesda so they understand just how shitty a job they did on the end game enemy. And don't even get me started on the vendor cap limit haha. I love this game but it could be soo much better. 
---
&gt;ng 'Haha this game, 
---
They won't address it. Look at Fallout 4, Look at Skyrim, the fan base screamed and screamed for years about the issues in those games and BGS ignored them then coyly says "we love our fans" at E3.
---
This entire title is a money grab and run so they can fund TES6 and that other title.
---
Idk if I'd say fine, but imo they're not nearly as bad as some people say. I think generally weapons should sell for more, and having a legendary effect should have a bigger impact on selling value (giving "useless" legendaries a use).
---
"Some people call them demons I call them bitches"- Uncle Bourbon
---
The thing is, it will fuck over those who farmed explosive legendaries legitimately. I have an AP Explosive Gatling  (I call her Susie), and I would probably nerd rage if they suddenly removed the explosive on it. I have no desire to try to farm for a TSE

Lol I've bought the same pocket plans I think 6 times on three different characters. It's like Oh 98 caps for this I can afford that... Buys it... find out I've already learned it... Proceed to look at plans with disgust and attempt to pawn it back at full price... Knowing full well this asshole Tin Can of a man will give me 10 caps -\_\_\_-
---
Its  ma'am
---
There are better weapons coming, like 4 stars, so once they stop the duping those, weapons will become irrelevant and people will want 4 stars, economy fixed

Well I've paid attention to the radius of the blast zone and I set up JUST outside of it.

Nah, he's looking for the Cage/Spike armor from Fallout 4. A lot of the raider corpses are wearing the set with the helmet, But it seems to be unobtainable at the moment.

What's more OP than a 3 Star TSE? A 4 Star TSE!!!!

People talk about crippling their wings yet no matter how much I shoot a wing with a cripple perk, nothing seems to cripple.

Oh no, your OP weapon that you either duped or bought duped doesn't work the greatest. I cry tears of blood for you.

Post a link to imjur, my account is also new, I do that.

No because each perk is level locked. I tried it and it only let me pick perks that I could get at that level as I unlocked stuff

You can have multiple accounts, buy upvotes or downvotes, have a bot that does that, etc. Reddit votes aren't a credible way to gauge anything. It's BS. People downvote clear truth, and upvote total lies, just because it confirms their bias. Some asshole PR company could be downvoting your comments because you're saying something they don't like, or upvote something because it makes some company look good. It's all a bunch of BS.

Duped weapons are hardly traded for caps, considering dupers are probably capped for them.
---
If anything, they’re traded for items instead, so I doubt making caps worthless would work at this point.
---
Despite everyone’s hatred for the idea, the best thing to do right now is to wipe everyone’s inventory but that might cause a bigger backlash than duping itself.

I quit playing all together when I loaded up my game and got ganked by three of them at my camp, no where near any fissures or anything, right as the game loaded.

The annoying spamming you mentioned is the absolute worst. They ought to go extinct.

Rather than having 2.356.644.677 scorchbeasts, they could have scorched squads lead by a strong (legendary?) commander. The squad could try to flank you, do area sweeps...if the engine can do that. The cyborg commander from C&amp;C Tiberian Sun comes to mind for a general feel.

NO PRESTON

Amen brother

You should try making a trap house.

Stop spreading rumours. Duping is way easier achieved. Noone does it like that (if it even works).

Yup.  And when I switched banks a few montha ago, they told me I would get my check card via mail.  Then sent me 2 letters (not email or mobile alerts, letters) saying to watch for it.

Doesn't the radius change as the exact ground zero of the blast change ?

Yes!!!!

This is what I do almost exactly. I skip the municipal center and start at the civic center then jump across to med center, but I may use your route (and grab stims from the mayors office on my way).
---
Also with marsupial / jetpack you can jump up through the hole in the Municipal building and not have to run past scorched. Fly above them. 😆

didn't even know that existed (the perk) , interesting :)

I will eventually if I can't figure out how to post an image

Only watched a couple. Think they were playing a different game.
---
the only reason i lock the door is so someone will go wanted IF they pick the lock while im in there.  i leave the door open when i leave.
---
i know thats weird but we have had issues with players in passive mode coming in camp and hitting/firing on us trying to instigate PvP without going wanted.  if we dont PvP they turn passive off and can 1-2 shot kill us.  or on occasion  they will stay there and continue to annoy us in every way possible.  so now they go wanted the second they pick the lock and no more dealing with that non-sense.
---
i dont mind if someone needs some crops or water or use my workbenches.  thats totally fine.  now i have a stash box outside on a porch with a light on it for people passing by.

I once filled a bathtub in my settlement with prewar money, jet, and med-x in a raider play through of F4. 
---
\#4 is all I ask for.
---
Yeah it is interesting. I'm often thinking to myself, because I'm very curious, what kind of resistances different enemies have. I have so many perk cards I need to get and that one is pretty low on the list, but I do want it.
---
From what I read crits only come from VATS damage, which I dont use. So probably still not much use.

I did the power of up quest and already stated this 
---
I'm not exactly sure what your talking about exactly, could you clarify a bit?
---
We don't have that many natural lakes to begin with.
---
I tend to take max life because I am running so many other %based damage reduction skills that more life directly = better survivability, but I also run a low hp/high rad bloodied/adrenal build.  More HP for me = a bigger HP sweet spot to trigger all my effects and still leave me with enough HP to survive until stimpacks kick in.
---
I'm not calling you a liar, but everyone in my group got it on the 3rd clear.
---
Did you miss the murder church post yesterday? That's some tough competition.

OMG I can only imagine lol 😂
---
It is a great game but like most games these days it does have issues. Server performance needs a lot of work.
---
I am not a fallout fan, I just never got into the old games, but I got 76 because 2 xbox buddies have over 100 hours each and are enjoying the game. I don't regret getting it, having a lot of fun solo and in a team. Most fun with a team IMO.
---
Kinda 
---
Yes, that seems to be their opinion. 
---
I'm going with this one. Noticed it too but just sever hop and hey presto 
---
Probably, but most ps4 players hit the resort directly, so it rarely changes. But if it does change its barely, I've taken that into account as well so I'll still be at a safe distance.
---
isnt refractor for energy damage?
---
I used to help low level players. I would find a nice legendary weapon or armor, mod it, and then give it to them after I helped them finish a quest.
---
Now I’m going to follow them around, trigger high level spawns, and watch as they die. Then eat them and steal their shit
---
Woopie I was looking for this thanks a bunch, time  to move camp, but does anyone know where you get the plans for the junk extractor?
---
Word of mouth is always worse and it’s typically by people who have never played the game.  It’s not as good as Fallout 4, but it’s still a fun game.   A little rough around the edges sure, but what’s there is still enjoyable . 
---
Same robin happened with Mass Effect Andromeda when it came out.  People got all crazy over some bad animations which were from a beta build and weren’t in the actual game.  I enjoyed it more than the reviews said 
---
Even with all of the BS it's possibly one of my favorite games. I just want it to be so much better. I can be a little hard on the game sometimes but it really frustrates me sometimes and I only get so critical because I like the game so much.
---
Well no...we know about bugs and there really isn't any point in repeatedly complaining about something everyone including Bethesda knows about...
---
After the inside the vault article comes out detailing the next 2 updates you better believe there will be people back to complaining (myself included exp if some of the major issues with easy fixes that I've been bitching about are not addressed or mentioned)
---
It's not that people "have given up hope" it's people have voiced their issues and are now patiently waiting for updates because people with even a small amount of common sense understand that fixes for large games can take a long time... And after so many of the earlier fixes where something else broke I personally would much rather them take the extra time to ensure the fix is really a fix...
---
I play this game everyday and have been extremely critical about things... And it's completely possible to enjoy the game and point out the flaws at the same time...I know this cuz I do it everyday
---
I understand that mine must be bugged want to try and get a extra one and trade it to me?
---
Nah, I swapped toons and they all started showing up. It’s tied to my other character somehow. 
---
time to self game end for my mistake
---
In my opinion if you have played the previous games, your going to like it. However that said you may not love it. The story isnt quite there and hollow to previous games. They do some neat things with this game, not exactley better but neat and different.
---
I was at frys last night and a employee asked the same question. As someone who was skeptical and waited to buy it.  I will say it is not near as bad as people are saying. The graphics are awesome ofcourse depending on gpu. I have maybe been disconnected from server once an hour ish. 
---
" You may find yourselves doing stupid mission with great lores and stories hidden in the holotapes / notes. "  
---
Um dunno if you're playing the same game as I am but as a long time Fallout fan, I can tell you the lore in F76 is not great... it has retconned a lot of age-old shit that was accepted as fact for Fallout lore.  
---
It adds in a ton of stupid nonsensical crap that makes no sense at all in the existing lore...  
---
While I am keen for all these new guns, there's no explanation as to why West Virginia is one of the only places using them, or the old petrol fueled military jeeps that litter the map.  Why is the handmade rifle in the game? Why not the Chinese Assault Rifle? The handmade rifle only exists post-war near the Commonwealth because Raiders found captured manafacturing plans for them.  
---
Why are their AI mainframes every ten meters? Realise that in Fallout any AI that is more than a simple routine of ifs thens elses requires a massive building size setup to not only function but store data right? You have to remember that holotapes store like 4kb of data, hold that perspective for a bit.
---
I'm in the same boat, fast travel in is a no go and walking gets me about 3-10 minutes before the crash and I've been working with Bethesda's help desk, but it's a help desk so all they can do is troubleshoot not actually fix anything.
---
You still earn perks past level 60, you just don’t get any more special points.  I have lots of perks cards unlocked I switch out all the tine.  Like all the crafting ones I don’t keep equipped until I am ready to craft something.  I have certain perks I only use while in a team etc.
---
Explosive shotgun is op literally without perks. Wtf r you talking about lol. 
---
Refractor is a pretty useless perk since you get two and a half more energy resistances with the grounded mutation which costs no perk points
---
I've put in about 200 hours, enjoying the heck out of it. It's not perfect, I have bugs daily but nothing game breaking. 
---
I wish we had bobble head displays. I remember getting the whole set 
---
I think about how pretty that spot is every time I sprint by it!  LOL
---
The whole MAE thing is the reason why I asked this question, I felt that people were exaggerating how bad FO76 is 
---
Ah good, 7/10 times I log in my camp won't spawn now.
---
I have no knowledge of pubg, so I don't understand what you mean.
---
Every post I make complaining about a problem there is always someone saying 'I've played 7,000 hours and this has never happened to me!'
---
I always reply 'good for you'.
---
My favourite one was when I complained about 3 dicks attacking me and someone was like 'I'm level 112 and I've never met any people like this!'
---
Well, obviously they aren't going to gang up on you if you're level 112, genius.
---
Have you tried a repair all from the camp box? Sometimes broken turrets won’t load correctly in my experiences. 
---
i think theyre actually talking about rad resistant 
---
I never go by reviews.  I tend to like games more when I try them for myself.
---
Sounds like a bug. All the assaultrons I've fought had to charge up their death beam like normal.
---
Ah, maybe I’ll become a raider but right now I’m a good hearted BOS soldier lol
---
Gotcha, I thought rad resist was rad sponge
---
Agreed...  Rewards for taking them are quickly followed by that first defense.  Then screw it...  Don't waste resources.  So many times I built up the workshop and let it sit for 20-30 minutes so I could go back and grab resources only to DC as is happening to the OP.  Super Fail.  Just capture and defend for event rewards...
---
Move on you god damn twat 
---
mini sloths.
---
Personally I really enjoy playing this game and honestly it isn't as bad as all the youtubers make it out to be, I've played everyday since launch and even prefured putting in this game over others I got at Christmas, these include God of war and red dead 2
---
Dont get me wrong it is a flawed game, it has its bugs, glitches etc.. but what Bethesda game hasn't got these lol 
---
they pretty much fo the same thing
---
As someone who can't convince my brother to get marsupial, I might copy your idea 😂

no normies

Me too, and I often find useful things in it too
---
Had that experience :/ lol was not amused

I always see a low level, I give 15 stimpacks and a nuka cola  .

first I look at them fixed to scare them for a long time with my sect of the sect 
---
Fast travel mats can bug out if your party members fast travel to your camp. It could spawn them under the mats occasionally. 
---
I use the suitcases in train stations too. So if you are on an Xbone, check them.
---
Basically this, The game concept is good and I have fun. Solo can be as fun as with friends too, depends on how you play. The game also has annoying flaws and bugs, and Bethesda handled the release poorly. Although, in the long run I think Bethesda being forced to deal wiht the launch, bugs and other problems will show them how to not do this in the future. Also shows them what basic things people expect out of a PC game ( PTT, FOV Sliders and no MB), although you may play on console. This makes me glad it was a Fallout spin off game and not a major installment for the series or TES.
---
I always use my all rise in nuke zones to share exp.  however, I will pull out my two shot if I see people hogging the kills.  Have to be fair to everyone 
---
Well...  They said they'd have the announcements to us tomorrow, but to avoid disappointment, I figure they'll get them out by Friday...  
---
I specifically claim them for a secondary base when my camp is really far away, because I'm not about to drag my camp around because those mechanics suck.. It's so so annoying... These past few weeks I've only played twice because each time I claimed, it happened and I just didn't feel like redoing everything. Just... Jaded.

Here I was thinking it was a loose Star Trek TNG reference, haha. The figurehead looks a lot like Patrick Stewart to me.

It was one of the first plans I got. My first C.A.M.P was a little red house lol

I can go on.
---
I love my state and have lived here my entire life 
---
Been all over my states 55 counties one way or the other for either work, play, or travel.
---
Reason I stay is I want to be here to help my state when she needs me. 
---
We as a state are unique in the way we live and how we function. We've historically been taken advantage by outsiders that don't know a lick about us nor care. 
---
We will give the shirt off our backs for the common man. Hell I have actually seen that happen.
---
Its probably the hardest relationship I have ever had.
---
Take over the Charleston Landfill. It'll drop.
---
I'd prefer an option to just stay connected to the last server...  :)
---
Yah but you get free security with sentry bot lol
---
You can always change it later.  Get perks to upgrade your carrying weight and the weight of items first 
---
Most criticism on YouTube is very blown out of proportion and a lot of things are just straight up lies, for example no one can steal stuff from you, some people just didn’t understand the trade menu. 
---
If you enjoy exploring interesting places and environmental storytelling you will love 76 because that’s what they’ve doubled down on in this game. 
---
I don't know, you tell me.
---
Same! Secondary base for me. I just can't deal with disconnects anymore. My CAMP is too far away, to fast travel with caps back and forth, so the workshops are so so helpful.

there is supposed to be a tech the Freestates had that grounded SB's...but.....i guess they forgot to finish that questline and give it to us...
---
I like to do diluted stims because I usually have close to 300 with me, but yeah! Just something to help out. I remember starting out was tough. Sometimes I'll give some more useful junk items.  Screws, adhesives,  springs and what not
---
This isn't true at all...
---
I've seen countless threads and comments detailing things wrong with the game by people who still like the game

Go to the spot, press the button on the mound to reap the rewards. If you have multiples of the SAME map, you can actually dig up the same treasure multiple times - once for each map you have.
---
Congratulations. You don't find them scary, but I do, and that's who I was talking about. Experiences and tastes differ. Notice the repeated use of 'I' in my reply.
---
I don't know about confined spaces being meant to be able to protect you. I've never found any building I could hide in successfully (aside from those with interiors that have their own loading screen). The only reliable way of getting away from them that I've experienced is hiding in deep cover under the trees, then creeping far enough away to go hidden and fast travelling somewhere safe.
---
It’s worth the money. I got it and am still having fun playing it since it came out.
---
We usually hit the power plants on the weekend since that's the only time we stay on a long enough to take advantage of holding workshops.  If I get an extra one, you can have it.  If you are happy with your camp location presently, I can build you one to get you by for now.  PSN ID: Calamity1985 m-f I'm not on until evenings, but usually available all day on Saturday.
---
Basically, the release version was a beta version. So reviews were justified. Now, the game is looking more like a release game. A working product.
---
I'd farm atoms, buy atoms, sell Buffout in the streets for atoms... all if they'd release themed C.A.M.P. stuff like Raider, BoS, Military, 'Stealth' (I picture camo tents and crossbow turrets?) instead of Multicolour Shitshow paintjobs.
---
+10 to all specials and you breath fire for 24 hours.
---
It feels like they didn't put in any wow-factor items.  Those buggers are all for the shop.  Why give us anything real for our $60?  There should have been a few really cool earn-able items.  There are some cool ones, but there aren't any amaze-balls ones.
---
I'm not sick but I'm not well~
---
true, they sure dont know jack about the inner workings of the game, and are not required to. Nevertheless bethesdas attempt at communicating with the players (afaik these community managers spawned around the time they said they would communicate more) is not working for us since we are not recieving any solid fix news, a small priority fix list even, would be more than the usual "several bug fixes" mentioned.
---
i think we are frustrated for the most part, and frustration leads to anger, and anger leads to the salt side
---
I play on xbox 1 and if you do as well I can spend a couple hours there with you letting you hide and shoot while I kill things for you. Just PM me if you are on xbox and we can fix your lvl 15 problem.
---
Plans for the vault boy statue are in the Overseers cache at Vault Tec University. 
---
And if you treasure hunt with others in a party, you all get a few caps/Stimpaks/water etc when someone digs a mount
---
Kind of like No mans sky?
---
OMG YES!!!  THIS!!!  Super annoying...  Log out at White Springs at your own peril!!!
---
As it should be. Because it's not. Comparing a game to a baby is fucking stupid.
---
Then you obviously don't know what you're talking about. 
---
Really? I've had a couple bury themselves (though I could retrieve them). Not had any vanish, yet, just blow me to hades.
---
in the forest only find waste, in the others you find garbage a little more useful, with the possibility of plans and modules 
---
You must have done so many dailies! 
---
I've put in about 450 hours since day one of beta. Yeah some things are broken and yeah the crashing gets annoying but I can honestly say this game can sometimes be the most fun I've had in a long time. At level 140+ with a Platinum trophy, I'm pretty much "done" with the game yet always have something new to do, even if that's just helping out new players. 
---
I work in online media (not video games) and I'm fairly certain the majority of the hate train is driven by clickbait and not genuine analysis of the faults in the game. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of things to criticize. But right now "Fallout 76 sucks and Bethesda is bad" seems to be the catch phrase du jour.
---
Find a handful of good people to play with and you'll have a blast, even with the bugs. "Ah fuck I blue screened" is pretty much a meme among my friends I play with at this point, no biggie and just load back in. 
---
Thanks for not reading the post. The question that you most likely read was meant to provoke discussion.
---
Dwemer return confirmed 
---
I used to pass out free shit to lower levels with a chinese propaganda flyer in the bag, gotta spread the word of nuclear communism. Turns out people didn't like that and would either shoot at me or scream at me over voice chat. Funny times. 
---
Yeah i agree with you, it might be a good time to, if not release, maybe announce some new content. People are a bit concerned about the state of the game. 
---
That's odd. I've made honey crisps myself already and the royal jelly is an aid item for me. \[PS4\]
---
Not at all. If you have good internet and patience.
---
I know right?!?! 
---
Don't get me wrong T&amp;L is good, but I'm a firm believer that's Stewart's sauce is superior.
---
I try to embiggen it regularly.
---
All I know, the DCs and crashes are reduced by around 75%.
---
Post it to imgr and post a link of your imugr post here
---
You are bitching that is is such a shit game. Yet you put your time and effort into the game. It is a contradiction. If you don't like a game you don't play it to completion.  Particularly when you said yourself playing the game is the equivalent of being a masochist. 
---
Can you be consistent?
---
I know it's deffo a bug as not all assaultrons I've encountered do this only some of them.
---
They do the initial powering up noise then the beam fires but doesn't go away, it even moves and follows you firing the beam. That beam is pretty powerful and drains your health pretty damn quick if caught in it even in power armour.
---
The only counter I've had when this happens is to keep stimming yourself and go close quarters, circling the bot whilst hacking it to bits 
---
I'd completely forgotten about bottlecap mines. I'll keep an eye out for them. And not being able to pick up caps is cruel beyond belief.
---
The Interloper
---
I noticed a level 8 doing Grafton day alone so I fast traveled to bail him out then helped take out some super mutants and gave him a level five three star bat think it was zealot faster swing speed and stronger power attack... I really need to get a new headset so I can just say oi you want some free stuff? 
---
Game has a lot of technical issues but it is a way better and cooler game then any previous Fallout i have ever played. All the issues that came with the game is because they tried to do too much with it so it's very complex in nature. I rather have a glitchy game that pushed the limits of physical ballistic interractions with body dismemberments and thousents of movable interactable objects that go everywhere during explosions in an multiplayer enviroment then a play safe engine with boring static enviroments that don't cause any possible glitches. Game is amazing and it's mostly getting hate from the singleplayer fanboys hatjng the game for being a multiplayer instead of a singleplayer story driven game that you unninstal the milisecond you finish that story. So most people use the technical issues the game is facing to trash the multiplayer part as well which is undeserved hatred.
---
I don't have a TSE just a regular shotgun with enforcer but I just run around crippling legs and letting other people clear up the ghouls too. 
---
Honestly I only have it with 1 perk card as kind of place holder i am thinking of moving. 
---
I too experienced that near Watoga station, I was crippled and nearly died in 3 secondes.
---
&gt; Thanks for not reading the post. 
---
It says the same nonsense that's been repeated ad nasuem, so it's not worth reading.
---
I want want more half walls so to better utilize the half floors. Like half vertically, not horizontal. Yessss to arches and stuff like that. We need circles and triangles too.
---
Erm, i believe you do get loot from your turrets kills. 
---
The first few encounters were terrifying, seeing your first scorchbeast at around level 12, and approaching Fort Defiance, the event *Defiance has Fallen* and using the Missile Turret to take down your first scorchbeast was absolutely amazing; then, treking towards Fissure Site Alpha or finding Paladin Targeddy was one hell of a quest, but after getting to around level 45 and you're able to farm scorchbeasts they are annoying as fuck.
---
I'm glad so many others share my same frustrations. I remember the first time I saw a Scorchbeast flying around, I was in awe and excited to become strong enough to fight one of these things!
---
Then I actually got into a fight with one, and it's the most frustrating enemy I've ever fought in any video game. It's attacks are way too spammy, practically giving you an epileptic seizure while you fight it. You can't actually aim at it because you're always blinded by its attacks. It takes way too much ammo to actually kill for such a shit reward. I literally received a lvl 5 pump action shotgun as loot from one the other day. Yes, level 5. And to top it all off, there's certain Scorchbeasts which will spawn in intentionally aggro'd on you, as if it's a thrilling experience to have to fight one. 
---
No Bethesda. They fucking suck. For people who designed several flying enemies in Skyrim, you fuckers couldn't make just one for fallout 76. /rant
---
I bet he was at some random players camp, and not his own. 
---
I treat my TSE as a AOE farming tool. I takes multiple body shots for me to down nukes zone ghouls. I do encounter individuals who one shot mobs which is pretty aggravating. When I run WSP I force respawn the main building 90% of the time. If someone comes and is one shooting mobs I immediately leave. I'm all about sharing loot but if someone is taking advantage of my generosity I'm out the spot or getting the mob to murder him XD
---
Oh, I'm confused then. I made a build using nukesdragons and most of the perks I want don't unlock until 25. Do I just use the points (10) I have on whatever?
---
Even with exploiting, the game is fun. My few complaints are minor (like the FPS killing flies over decaying bodies and the fact that sometimes the scorchbeast Queen becomes invincible) and sometimes major (ammo carry weight and half the luck’s perks being broken, since I’m always a luck build. Very lucky guy :D) so yeah, I’d say the game is worth it.
---
Don't forget that you can 'smelt' spoiled food at the Chem station and turn it into fertilizer.
---
Also for those reading these replies we also got a love affair with good hotdogs.
---
That's why the hotdog eating contest at Camden Park makes me laugh.....and I do it. every.single.time.
---
Huh. Guess I've never run into that one before. Thanks for the info!
---
Actually, they couldn't verify that it was or wasn't opened at some point, so they gave him a cease and desist just in case.  They made him take down any Bethesda merchandise. They game was shrink wrapped, but they weren't able to verify whether he opened it at some point, then re-sealed it. Since he wasn't an authorized reseller, they had no way to protect themselves if the guy was trying to scam people, so they made him label it as "used/pre-owned" (even if it was really new), to protect themselves from a lawsuit.

Cliff-racers on mega steroids.

But yeah they waste ammo and resources like crazy. Not fun.

Mole rats.

Finding plastic.
---
Its hard to say some playstyles are better than the others but its easy to say non-marsurpial playstyle is the worst
---
I did, around 10 times. Switched chars and they showed right up in all locations so somehow it’s tied to my main char. 
---
I've had the glitched water purifier taking up 3% of my budget however it may be much higher. I can remove things from my camp but I cannot add any, and the percentage never changes. So for weeks now I've been afraid of removing camp items or moving my camp for fear that I'd make the whole thing unusable. 
---
Which is kind of a bummer because I've learned a lot of recipes and would really like to put new things in. Or move my camp to a more useful location. Instead my camp is just sort of frozen in time and location until a fix comes in.
---
I get why it would be harder to implement but man did I like having things organized in Fallout 4.  Now it's all in one pile, and they'd have to redo the whole thing to make a Fridge work as part of your stash.  I'd love it though, was thinking that the other day when I had 15 steaks in my pocket.  
---
lets not get all Lorgar about this
---
Ah! Reskinned Skyrim Dragons!
---
Or instead, fill all the fucking trenches in the Cranberry Bog, I keep falling in them and getting trapped while fighting enemies..
---
Oh Harvey...
---
No, cause I didn't get a bounty on myself. Shot first at 1 water purifiet to see if it was a CAMP of the wanted player and then erased everything on sight.
---
Watoga is mainly where this happens for me but also in other places like sugar grove. At first I thought it was mainly a watoga thing until it happened in other places too 
---
Please not that in addition to what others have said, it's also leveled to your character, so wait for level 50
---
Yep, i really like the bearskin rug, the busts are pretty cool too, but most of it is really lack luster. Especially looking back on objects in fo4, shoot just port those items over I myself wouldn't mind a single bit.
---
Yeah buddy witch hunting we always warn people to move fast to remove it.
---
I did read it. It's you saying: "why did they release Fallout 76, instead of Fallout 5: Red God of Redemption 2?"
---
Which is basically asking: "why didn't they release the game that **I** wanted?"
---
And hence my comment: "I don't know, you tell me".
---
Yes, they do seem to be tied to the region for quality of loot. Like quest weapons, wait until you're level 50 or above to do them as anything useful they might give you will be max level.
---
Not having marsurpial is a choice. Its not racist, its imbecilist
---
It sells for under 40$ technically. Maybe for the first few weeks it sold for 60$. If you think 4$ for one gun skin is a lot hop onto the Blackops 4 sub where they're paying 20$ with no way to earn the currency to buy said gun skin. 
---
Both BO4 and FO76 are AAA games with free dlcs with money for dlcs coming from microtransactions. You can play all future content without paying anything extra. This community is split, while half of us know and understand from a business standpoint why microtransactions are in the game others just don't and believe if it isn't free it's to much. 
---
I need make it clear I don't like microtransactions in any game, but I know it's necessary if all future dlcs are free. I'd rather pay for cosmetics(or not) and get a free dlc every quarter than pay 15$ for a dlc just to play with my friends. So pick your poison buy or don't buy cosmetics or be forced to spend 15 on a dlc 4 times a year. 
---
Only after 24 real hours, can I get lead  
---
Scorch Beast have resistance to explosive damage.
---
But if you have a TSE and use Armor Penetration mod and some perks. Also Explosive Bobblehead you can melt the SBQ really fast.
---
Yeah but on the internet a few weeks feels like forever.
---
Thx i ll check it out as well !
---
Why don't you write down your shit on a piece of paper.
---
I thought it would just be deleted and a warning issued first offence and all, but boom 7 day ban straight away lol is what it is. 
---
Shop open!!! I am looking to get rid of bulk junk, ammo, plans, recipes. I have a selection of weapons and can build on request.
---
Gamertag: KMooreLod 
---
Apparently. Someone said you can. I personally don't know for sure. I have heard conflicting things.
---
Presumably they want their product to survive after bringing it into the world. That's the metaphor, Ted. It's not a real baby. Calm down.
---
I'll be here 😊
---
Good idea. Though I think only a division between Defence and everything else is needed. I'd like the option of having lots of décor or very little and being able to build large or small accordingly.
---
Lol at first I was thinking "He who smelt it, dealt it."
---
Eye of Sauron bug - lol.
---
Idk my fusion generator keeps dying before the walls around it. I keep checking but I never see anything in that room. 
---
No, no, we don't all know that, because it was not a disaster.Didn't ready anything after that, since you started on a false premise.
---
Yeah they are harder than the dragons in Skyrim and yet they appear so frequent. When one of those fellas flies out of a trench near you while you’re overencumbered, might as well server hop or getting past it with all your stuff will take an eternity...
---
Sorry. I'm not that clever. Laughing now.
---
Not sure what your point is?, i have seen posts like this almost word for word.
---
Nothing i can really say that we have not said to theae posts over and over. Not trying to be rude or anything.

I'm sorry you had to read that

Moved my CAMP. Could not build anything due to supposed "over budget" issue, when budget showed 51% stored.
---
Deleted every item in the stored section and stored budget showed 0% - still could not place anything due to "being over CAMP budget"??
---
Litterally had to move CAMP again and then I could build. V. Annoying as I had to collect a ton of gears etc all over again. 
---
I don't think you understand how games are worked on. You have different teams that work on different things. The bug team isn't taking a break from working on bugs to make a new skin trust me. 
---
They take witch hunting very very serious here. Its why if you see someone good or bad making the mistake let them know asap.
---
I have an explosive and it doesn't one shot everything. Some things take a few shots and the closer they get the closer I get to killing myself.
---
Same way I convinced all my friends to get with the program lol
---
It’s actually pretty sad that most people who hate the game haven’t even given it a chance. This is why people never trust anyone.
---
Find a map, find the x, dig, get treasure!  
---
Win!
---
Incorrect. Materials from Nuke drop are required, plans are available from the Enclave vendors. Circa 4k caps a piece IIRC
---
Swap Pack Rat for Incisor and Traveling Pharmacy for Martial Artist. Incisor is such a must-have, it’s insane how good it is.
---
It’s funny how you’re snacking on the denizens of Appalachia but still want to find canned goods. If you want Luck to do more for you, try swapping Can Do with Bloody Mess and Scrounger with Starched Genes. There are some very nice mutations to get that compliment melee very well, and Bloody Mess is just more damage.
---
I took your link and just added my recommended perks in the swap areas. Take a look.

I think the scorchbeasts are the devs spirit animal. This game is exactly how you describe scorchbeasts: annoying, frustrating, poorly designed, and rewardless. 
---
I want my money back
---
Boooo. Support the Gatling. Dont swap for a paint job! Make them give is our own!
---
You missed the point. They are just not worth the annoyance.
---
It took me fighting 1 of those things to figure this shit out. Never again
---
It would be cool, kinda like how in ARK we had fridges or we could make stuff into jerky.
---
# Visual bug with shadows
---
This can be seen in any part of the game is sertain hours of day, usualy 15:00 - 16:00 PM

I have expirience in modding for bethesda games, and this line is clearly the gap between cells. This bug is realy noticeble when foliage is presented and weather is clear. 
---
Well, in that one church the logs mention they heard weird noises from the walls and decided not to check it out. Until one day the wall tore apart and they all died. 
---
I read his post as well, its clear he's asking why Bethesda released the game too early or didn't at least manage expectations and let people know its buggy but we will fix it soon(tm).
---
The simple answer is greed.
---
What kind of junk?
---
I literally snipe people with my shotgun with no perks from a mile out. Only exception is SBQ
---
Md
---
What you need. Pretty much everything except screws and springs
---
Why is it not worth reading?
---
I agree. I shoot, on average, 600 to 1,000 bullets during the battle. Multiple stims and radaway. Then the cost of repairs. Only to get a shitty legendary and a explosive ultracite vent
---
i have a bloodied explosive 50 cal i dont know what to do with
---
Yeah will do 😉
---
I’ll be honest, I started a new FO4 character and have been playing that again, after finishing the main FO76 quest line 
---
wanted to comment that wearing the bos protective suit still removes damage resistance from PA as of Jan 9th.  Just saw this and realized that i went from 290 damage resistance in excavator to 351 as soon as I unequipped the suit and reequipped the PA. 
---
Because I don't really care. Besides, who writes with their shit? Gross.
---
So cool
---
Oh, makes sense then. 
---
Yeah, that’s the norm, but it’s been around 40 now. Ah well. 
---
I can't even begin with a proper reason to NOT have it. In party with monster band you start flying, it's awesome
---
I’m doing this too but I don’t get as many caps :/ I’ll start collecting more things from nuke zones 
---
I have a death claw at my base so it works. Max animal whispers one other perk card. I’ll find it. 
---
I really enjoy it when I can get something going.  The constant crashes and freezes that have only started since Christmas for me really turn me off of this game.  
---
Not to mention the glitching quests and having to return to my base every 30 minutes to unload junk and unusable weapons. Then having to constantly clear out my storage and make sure I’m not hungry or thirsty makes this game feel like a chore rather than fun.  
---
Oh don’t get me started on higher level dickheads who destroy ur base and bring super overpowered enemies enemies around u to kill u. 
---
Overall the game is ok to play in 3-4 hour intervals anything more than that has me getting irritated rather quickly and makes me hate it even more. 
---
Nope. Some mods have such a small % to unlock that they will likely be the last you learn and can take hundreds of tries, some are not learnable at all and have to be bought as mods.
---
wanna trade? I'm looking for one.
---
Haha. I love it. You're kind of a dick, but that's bloody funny and creative.
---
Oil for 1 I need a ton of. Where can you meet? My junk girl is stationary at the overseas camp. Its a separate profile so I can bust the stuff to her....just hope its close so I can get more.
---
If I remember correctly, every single Fallout and TES have been in the same state; New Vegas being the absolute worst out of them all, and somehow it is considered the best Fallout today by some.
---
It's curious, because back in those days, if you said you liked New Vegas outside of certain reduced circles, people treated you the same way as they treat those who say that like F76.
---
War; war never changes.
---
reduces damage to the gauss rifle, just in case 
---
The one I'm talking about isn't a two shot. They should rename them to the KYSTSE.
---
I'm lvl 17 and I was wandering west of Whitespring and came across one for the first time. I didn't know what the sounds were when i first heard it but i had immediately crouched and went stealth with my chameleon armor piece. Then i recognized the ominous sound of flapping wings and saw it in the sky. Luckily i was just under caution and never fully detected. But i slowly made my way to Whitespring and then sprint as soon as i could see the gate in site. Not real sure how it didn't discover me. 
---
Yeah I don't have TSE shotgun. Just explosive shotgun.
---
I’d rather take my pencil to write 
---
I get attacked quite a lot at the Sunnytop Station by scorchbeasts. Last round I had to fight 3x 60+ scorchbeasts and 6-7 scorched. It wouldn't have been bad except for all that sonic attack spam. All I had to do to piss them off was fast travel and then spawn. 
---
Its fallout 4 with 20 random people in the world with you.  As you might expect almost non of them interact.  A limited amount will trade or help, every once in a while there is a a\*hole.
---
Having used Explosive - without TS - no, it isn't, not even a little bit close. Holy shit Explosive even on a Pipe Rifle is insane. 18 shot clip with a suppressor autocrit is 36x Crits with 100% hitrate, all of which stack up for the NEXT crit. 
---
I always fast travel to events when I see people doing them/defend quests. My one complaint is if I accidentally let one bullet stray away and hit a wall I have a damn bounty on my head!!! At least make it where you have to actually destroy an object to get a bounty. You don't get bounty for accidentally shooting someone unless you kill them. Should be the same.
---
I fast traveled and went into a monongah power plant quest right as someone fell to some high level super mutants. It was awesome swooping in and stimpacking them and helping take the mutants out
---
I am not annoyed for getting DC, I am annoyed having to rebuild them. Like many posts ago one user told, Workshops should save template and when you claim it, it should ask us if we want load previous build.
---
They do, just very very poorly to the point where the benefit is negligible.
---
Should be possible just gotta go into controls and then I think there's like weapon switches and stimpaks available to bind
---
Someone said you need both Animal Friend and Wasteland Whisperer. But someone else said you only need one. But maybe Wasteland Whisperer is needed for different things like Snallygaster.
---
I was going to suggest the same thing, it's where I made my T-51b set and completed my T-60 looking for the ever-elusive, left leg. 
---
I've taken damage from assaultron beams when I wasn't even in line of sight.  I'll hear the attack, the screen turns a reddish color, but no enemy in sight. After walking around for a bit, I eventually come across an assaultron firing his beam out into the distance in a completely different direction, but I will still take damage. I've even hidden behind buildings, and still get hit by the beam
---
What do you get out of regurgitating the same shit over and over? What is the benefit on trying to convince people to stop enjoying something? 
---
The downside to the bug is, once you are over budget you can't build the wires needed to power anything. Basic turrets not effected.
---
I'd love chrome guns!
---
I do that I collect about 600-800 a day I need to get more things for sell every 24 hours

Oh, nice so the bright really is worth it then on the T60?  Ok I'll do some more server hopping tonight and see if I can snag it.  Seems like all I see is the strength chest mod which I looted a long time ago.

Ah I understand now. To answer your question that came from interpreting what you think I asked (which wasn't my intention). That's a really hard question, which I talk about in the post. So, there are my thoughts that may answer to your question. I'd appreciate if you had anything to comment on this topic, would be more lucrative discussions.
---
Wasteland whisper! Yes that’s it. I have both maxed. 
---
This is the best answer especially since we did not get a proper beta. Had beta been 8-10 months out from release with time for us to find the issues and provide feedback. The game would of released in an amazing state.
---
But it released just in time for christmas for sales. Problem was they went on holidays and left us to play a pretty unstable game full of bugs. The game is insanely fun and just currently bogged down by alot of issues.
---
You want more content.
---
Bethesda will only make more content if the game is financially successful.
---
Financial success depends on the ability to attract and keep new players.
---
Good for you. I still like the game. Criticism is a force for good.

I don't know a lot about guns and modding as I play melee mostly, but maybe there are significant differences between different shotguns and mods.
---
Exactly that’s what I was thinking.. that’s a bit strange.. what if you accidentally sell anything you use and you want to buy it back but you’ll have to spend like 10x more then you got 
---
Love it! And fully agree with accidentally shooting an object and not getting a bounty
---
I think i just understood why this sub hates youtubers so much. They dislike the game yet played it till the end just to hate. Its not like you can play a game you dislike just to have a complete view of the game so people can't go "Something tells me you have 20 minutes of game play under your belt if that." or something stupid like that.
---
I can? Cheers!
---
Fair enough. Maybe other platforms were better than PC then.
---
Yep- they don't even have to go to 5\* yet- they can make the existing pool of duped legendary stuff worthless to the community that covets the stuff just by slowly raising the level cap for weapons and armor. People will be leaving level 50 two-shot explosive whatevers at the vault for noobs if level 55's are a thing. Then 60's, then 65's . . . 
---
" A cheating POS"
---
How do you know?
---
It something we all want. There is a bug with the X-01 armor that it will sometimes change out the name I've found.
---
And I know this. It really sucks for those who farmed it legit, but they can't just poof the duplicates out of existence it seems. I fear the only way to fix it is to do something drastic. Honestly do we really need a weapon that powerful? Something that can face roll everything out in the wastelands. 
---
Come find me. I have oil 😊
---
I'm loving it. I have just over 40 gameplay videos under my belt and just cracked Level 45. I play on PS4 and have been lucky enough to have very few technical problems. It is annoying when YouTubers just concentrate on the problems. It would be quite easy for me to edit together five minutes of weirdness and present it as a definitive gameplay experience, but the truth is that the vast majority of the time I've spent on the game has been very enjoyable.
---
I think one problem is that the game now has a reputation for being so buggy that any incidence of gameplay that doesn't conform exactly with the reviewer's expectations is now declared to be another example of bugginess, even when the game is working exactly as designed.
---
I almost fell into this trap myself. The quest marker once told me to go into the roof of a building to find something, but there was nothing there. I looked and looked, but there was no way anything could be hiding from me and I thought 'Oh no. Game breaking bug.'
---
Then I saw the doorway leading to the attic.
---
That I'd walked past half a dozen times.
---
The "it never happened to me" is a really stupid response. Sounds like "Well i never used condoms and i still don't have an STD no idea why you people worry about it"...
---
The prices are to High way to high 
---
Yes. I'll be on later tag: thenewfluff
---
I understand your point, and you're completely right.
---
My problem is that I just put mine there in order to go there by foot to scrap my junks in case there is a nuke at WhiteSprings. And i have no turrets. 
---
I usually invite everyone to come to my garage, which is always open, because there is every workbenches and a rad shower.
---
But for 2 days in a row, someone destroyed my camp while it wasn't needed...
---
Please pay attention, some players aren't assholes and would like anyone to benefit from it... 
---
/r/nocontext
---
That is not correct, My CAMP is in a location that spawns 2 Scorched, and a pack of Dogs every 5 minutes, and if I kill them they are Lootable, but if I let the 3 turrets handle it alone they are not.
---
I have also watched to see if I got any XP from the Turret kills, and I do not, unless I tag them.
---
I love you lol. Sent u a message: HazY PsycKo
---
pfft Ultramarines.  Raven Guard is where it's at.  Would have either saved you from a distance and you never would have seen them, or would have jumped in with their packs, destroyed close range, and been gone before you even recognized them.  
---
I had them attack the ammo plant when I had it a few times. I literally just left and did other shit. So not worth my time.
---
Most of the "rare spawns" drop terrible loot also.
---
The flatwoods monster is ridiculously easy if it doesn't run and the best thing it drops is a toy rocket ship.
---
The bugs are mostly manageable at this point. Just a normal annoyance like all Bethesda games.
---
Scorchbeasts and the fact that 95% of legendaries are utter trash is why I left the game. If I never get anything decent and there are no new quests then I've become completely stagnant in progression and there's no point in playing anymore.
---
So something like the law degree Lone Vault Wanderer has?
---
Sorry, that only became a standard for multiplayer games 15 years ago, so beth can’t support it.  :(
---
Exactly but the prices are crap you should get more caps for legendary weapons and not around 5 caps.. 
---
I farmed the Workshops for a week over Xmas vacation, and I got a LOT of material for the C.A.M.P. and find I don't use it.  I bought the SHIT out of the Bearskin Rug when I found it.  
---
But some of the problem is the menu is difficult to use.  I found I had electric-lighted signs!  I found I had a set of letters I could write things with; several different sets of wall colour, and a plethora of doors.  
---
Is there a lot of ultra-cool, wow that;s awesome stuff?  Not in game, that seems to come from the Atomic Shop.  
---
So, for the most part, I agree.  But I wasn't really a settlement guy in FO4, other than the practical sense of setting up defense and trade.
---
It's a fun game, but judged as an online game it sort of sucks.
---
After you launch nukes and explore, you are pretty much just competing with people one-shotting ghouls at whitespring in hopes of getting your own weapon to one-shot things at whitespring.
---
The journey until that point is pretty good and the map is the best one in a fallout game.
---
doesn't work however when you own 9 sets of PA.  
---
Exactly,between Happer’s Ferry and a Red rocket 
---
My point was how today's expectations of AAA games don't match with the game. Could you link to a post that's really similar to this? I'm most interested.
---
I have tse weapons but I only use them if I’m the only person their. Otherwise I use a radium rifle that works great because I’ve heard it heals them. 
---
That's literally the job of Public Relations. " **Public relations officers use a wide range of media to build and sustain a good image for a company, organisation or brand through planned publicity campaigns and PR activity.** " They use every tool at their disposal to set a good image on their company. I think you are confused.
---
I hate watching them shoot their blinding annoying screeches at me from their ass, while facing someone else....
---
Did the same. My garage with workbenches is open, and i have no turrets, but it seems like a lot of players don't give a fuck, and automatically destroy a camp on WhiteSprings .. 
---
Wait seriously? 
---
Good idea. What is the flare gun for? I have the plan and I must've found a dozen of them. I presume it doesn't summon the Minutemen.
---
Nah, wrong again, i'm on PC.
---
Idk
---
Couldn't agree more. Or at the very least have them drop a stack of ballistic fiber since they tear through your armor so much.
---
Nah, your shit just sounds janky man. Hate to break it to ya. Sorry.
---
Now I just want mess with YouTube's lore people: 
---
*BOS and Enclave soldiers ride together into battle against a mutant horde in West Virginia, after they failed to sell them pre-war jet for bottle caps*
---
Avoid areas with high level players, they’ll cause enemies to spawn high level.
---
Try jumping around to events if you don’t have anything else to do, or taking and defending workshops in the areas you can already handle 
---
Agreed, a L10 grafton monster is more rewarding, I now have my camp in grafton and kill him every time I spawn In, plus Graam passes by here
---
Yes! Let us help low level players get to the end game as quickly as possible, so they can realise that there isn't one. 
---
Sarcasm aside, I don't mind a bit of generosity here and there but some of you guys go way overboard. Sure, make plans and ammo available to lower levels, but at least have them trade you for it. I appreciate that with the broken PVP system, the only other option is to be altruistic, but there are little enough stakes in FO76 already and erasing any remaining struggle won't help the game long-term.
---
It’s actually near a scorchbeast spawn location. But I’m been here for several days and the scorchbeast never came. It just roaming around Happer’s Ferry.
---

No problem that, at least it caps in game for genuine finds, not scalpers after dollars crashing servers...

---
STOP HAVING FUN !
---
You are not helping. What you are doing is cutting someones gametime. If am level 50 and one gives me max level weapon, with best effects, he is not helping, he just killing the time I would spend in game trying to get caps or valuables to obtain that weapon. Vendors give 1400 caps a day. Max level weapon used to costs like 25+ caps, now they cost less. If one gave me 25k caps weapon, it would mean I have now 20 days less content .
---
The chamber in the Enclave can clear the mutation even with the perk card installed, so you just need to be careful with that one.  Marsupial is worth it for most builds.  Twisted Muscles for Melee.  Beyond that you really need to run Class Freak 3 and go all in or the negatives start having larger impacts.
---
I don’t know that before...
---
You might only need 3 points and one of those cards but I don't know for sure. It's just stuff people have said and I haven't been able to check for myself. Yeah I have 6 in Charisma anyway. I use Lone Wanderer and Field Surgeon. I have so many perk cards I want to get so it's pretty low priority right now. but it's really cool that you can do that.
---
Wow you really didn't read it did you? The post was about playability and bug issues not the story gameplay itself. 
---
Let me guess you one of those that as soon as someone says anything negative about the game your all "Leave Britney (oops I mean Bethesda) alone!!" People are allowed to have opinions of their own. People should be able to express  those opinions, in a mature manner. If you dont agree with them, try expressing that in a mature manner, and if your not capable of that maybe choose not to respond to their post. AND if all that's beyond you just understand you are being childish and ridiculous. 
---
19k caps wast the last time i saw one
---
I would agree with you but if they even look at this sub they can use the "bitching" posts really well. I work with people developing apps and the biggest one lets tourists book, rooms hotels and so on. The amount of bugs the android version has is close to Fallout 76 because of fragmentation. We have a person who looks at bug reports and comments under the app.
---
If 100 people complain and 80 showcase the same bug that means its critical so we force our programmers by locking the vending machine to work on it ASAP. Bethesda should have done the same and fix big bugs now and tiny bugs later. Its called priorities.
---
&gt;I play this game everyday
---
I know what it is to love a buggy ass game that gets fixed extremely slowly... i have PUBG since lauch... but the bitching really helped imo.
---
The Excavator Bright - when added should make use of all of the lamps on the Excavator and light up everything!
---
Thank atom I havnt encountered that yet but I did have an assaultron fire it's beam at me from a great distance after i ran from it, I was able to hide from the beam though
---
What happens if you tame the Deathclaw you are told to "make friends with" during the story?
---
I'm giving out a level 5 pipe revolver with 100 rounds and a handful of stimpacks.  Not really end game gear
---
Yes. It feels like defending the company against a legitimate complaint.
---
It's a massive corporation that released a flawed product. Don't act like we're mocking a small weeping child for her attempt to draw her mum in crayon.
---
Interesting. I'm not sure exactly how I got the mat. I thought I'd lost it but a couple weeks into the release I noticed I had it in my stored stuff so I put it down. 
---
I agree,  but OP was talking about buying known duped items which is what I refered my comment to. But like I said, as far as regular players go, it's impossible for us to tell what's duped and what isn't. 
---
Doesn't really make sense to stick around the sub though.  To each their own I guess...
---
Sorry to hear that.  On PS4 I've also lost my entire set of equipped armor while fast traveling away from Whitesprings.  It only happened one time and I still have no explanation for it.  Definitely didn't drop it or sell it, just showed up at my camp in my skivvies.  I suspect it might be a load error from when all your gear gets dumped on you again when you teleport in, but who knows.  The most charitable thing I'll say about it is it "encouraged" me to try other types of armor -- and to always walk over to the train station before trying to fast travel/server hop near Whitesprings.
---
You can definitely get the serum recipes as a drop from the SBQ, I got the herbivore serum recipe as a drop just the other day.
---
You can buy a 1 use serum from the enclave vendor but I have never seen them sell any recipes to make them.
---
Limit is 2 at a time.  When you toss #3, #1 explodes.
---
No more killing deathclaws by sneaky laying 20 mines and then aggroing it with a pipe pistol LOL.
---
However, I have used the mechanic to detonate them on purpose.  At Summerville, more than once I've put two on a car at the outskirts of town, then fell back, end sneak and aggro the mutants with rifle shots.  As they approach the car, throw the third mine.  Fun times.  I miss the C4 from New Vegas.  That was so fun to play with.
---
I never got anything good off of them..
---
Get out of white springs is my philosophy. It causes servers crashes, even w/o turrets in my exp
---
Could not have gone better then.
---
1% sounds about right. With the current limit that makes it one interesting player per four servers...
---
I bought nearly all of mine from vendor hopping. Vendor hop the Whitesprings bunker or Watoga vendors and you'll run into sold legendaries. 
---
I got a level 50 two shot pipe rifle from Flatwoods bot and my alt is level 11. It's waiting for me to level. 
---
Il be sure to steer clear of that one too then lol, thanks for the heads up, all that ammo and resources wasted just to find either the vendor doesn’t have the plan or mod you want or if your selling he’s out of caps 🤔
---
Marketing &amp; communication. Mostly analytics is required as well as event management. Sales stuff. 
---
He's also in Aus while the team is in US... Kinda hard to work like that as a community manager as well.
---
Not saying he's incapable, don't believe he has acces to any relevant information though.
---
I absolutely love how my dude, with maxed stealth, chameleon, and armor that boosts stealth effects, crouched and unmoving in the basement of a house is still somehow a draw for their aggro, and can be harmed by their magical dust which can penetrate walls and floors. I love having two of them troll me for a mile, sometimes landing directly in front of me, while not necessarily knowing where I am. I love how sometimes they just cannot be harmed. Really just the perfect, situationally game breaking enemies.
---
How long does it take you to kill them with slap damage? I ran out of things to do last year, maybe I should start killing people do. I never bothered testing how much you to damage with slap damage.
---
"will"?  Did they announce they were going to or are you just making a guess?
---
There are tons of crevasses and caves under the bog, which makes the gas a effective weapon there.
---
Could you be more specific what you mean by repeating?
---
I don't try to convince people to stop enjoying the game in the first place, and I don't think that is possible, unless they want to stop enjoying it.
---
I think it's important that people bring up the same topics over and over again, so Bethesda knows what was wrong with the release.
---
I’ve seen a lot of people mentioning getting starched genes to make mutations permanent, but I haven’t seen anyone mention to *make sure you don’t have it on when you drink the serum, since starched genes also stops you from getting new mutations.* (Unless this has changed in regards to serums?)
---
700 atoms each
---
It was announced 
---
The game launched without a lot of things. It's genuinely surprising because the devs had to know how limited it was. The pressures of quarterly releases and the holiday shopping season are harsh, apparently. 
---
Hi welcome to online games as a service.  Change any code in the game and it can potentially influence or wreck a million other things with really, no way to know this ahead of time.    
---
They need to have a public test area before pushing patches, but that is probably a little ways out yet.  
---
a-hole
---
Agreed, and especially like the suggestion by /u/OldVulture on Sonic Bombs.  
---
Especially since you can't hide in a bunker or shed unless it's fully instanced.  And even then I am normally losing health at the same rate.
---
That grass is lovely &gt;.&lt;
---
That makes two of us
---
Well, that's dumb. Stop it. I mean I haven't played in a while cuz my opinion of the game has changed over the last couple weeks, but hey when I do play, that's where I usually set up.
---
This is hilarious. People are selling TSE guns and such on other sites for like $5 each. Not that they're even worth that. How braindead do you have to be to buy a duplicated gun for $25 when they're raining from the sky.
---
IMO, lifegiver is better at endgame levels because it's usable in power armor and costs one less perk point. 
---
That's the Man-Emperor of Mankind to you heathen!
---
Lol I know right 
---
I still to this day never understand why people defend developers and corporations shipping out a broken product.
---
I mean would you defend any car manufacturer if they sell you a car where half the things don't work but they promise you to fix your car in the next 6 months?
---
The scrap of Gold and Sliver doesn't weigh a lot, so if you farming the 1400 caps per day from vendors its is decent to have to sell.  Otherwise your right it is pretty much useless.  If I only have 20 minutes or so to play in a day I will just fast travel tour of the vendors and sell gold or silver.
---
Whitesprings has a issue with the robots duplicating.  If I’m not mistaken that’s one of the issues that is supposedly causing server instability. Its supposed to get patched. 
---
I’m not sure honestly. I’m sure you could make friends with it then run back a few feet and tame it. It has to be a random encounter spawn to be tamable. So you can’t tame the deathclaw on deathclaw island or the deathclaw west of Top of the world. 
---
I've had to clean public bathrooms as part of my job.  A surprising number of people are shiterate.
---
48 hours later, people duping again. I mean they already fixed dupe until less than 48 hours, new was found. If thats their coding quality then we will see duped 4 stars.
---
Lmao that might have been me
---
The problem is that the two perks have the same effect... so it seems useless
---
Noted. But ehh... I usually get so much weight in random legends i keep it close so I don't have to travel far.
---
If you’ve got a 2 shot fat man I can add a mirv for you X3 
---
I’m sure I will eventually find my way to lv100, but losing that super sledge will sting for a good long while.
---
Exactly. They built a bunch of factions in the game that ultimately mean nothing. Imagine you could align yourself with one, get perks and bonuses, and build a faction-specific camp. When you saw another player from that faction's rival, you would immediately go for PVP (because you could tell by their faction-specific power armour). 
---
Like, why put the first 10% of that system in the game and then just leave it 
---
Unfortunately there's a lot of lazy fucktards out there who will still buy this crap.
---
Just started experiencing this yesterday, support is no help. I suspect the shag flooring I tried laying down. It screwed up build capabilities - it was "there" but it was invisible, and I'd fall through if I walked on it, but I couldn't remove pieces it was supported by. I tore everything down except for the shag piece and what was connected to it, and tried moving CAMP hoping it would help. Instead I can simply no longer open up my CAMP build menu (workshops are fine) and I suspect it's the blueprint with the shag flooring causing it.
---
Oh, I'm okay with being wrong. I'm glad the release was a good experience to you!
---
You can't help the Legion of AngryStupid
---
Honestly they should've prolonged the BETA for 6 months, no one would've cared and it would've been received way better
---
Time will tell I suppose....
---
Yes, more wild and wacky quirks of this young, ambitious game. It don’t mind it but I sure wish we could have radios back. 
---
this is nothing new and this been going on since ultima online almost nonstop in all games
---
Some games are a bit harder to cheat and dupe items into.
---
There was whole defcom episode about 1 hacker who started in ultima and been "cheating items in mmo's and selling them for real money" , in his prime he was making like 25k US dollars a month
---
[https://youtu.be/AUjuefLqphY](https://youtu.be/AUjuefLqphY)
---
That’s your opinion not everyone else feels the same way.
---
I’ll take any help if I’m overwhelmed by scorchebeasts muties or assaultrons.
---
If it’s really annoying and you’d rather die and respawn then accept anyone’s help say so with your mic.
---
When you get the armor-ignoring perks that gun starts to feel a lot more fun.
---
I would pay like 5 perception perk points for the ability to highlight enemies I've just killed, and haven't yet looted.
---
I too have a camp there, with both rocket and heavy laser turrets. 
---
After reading this string, I was going to move it. 
---
After reading your comment, I certainly will not. 
---
Thanks, was really struggeling with finding a third spot!
---
He may have been a dick, but then again you were lvl 7 on your alt ( meaning this isn’t your first wasteland rodeo) and went to white springs where the higher levels and the assholes hang out ( the two are not mutually exclusive) and the lvl 60+ ghouls that would have killed you soon regardless. 
---
1. You should have known better.
---
2. Sounds like you made an alt just to level up since you obviously went strait to W/S so you were not worried about playing the game and story just grinding levels.
---
3. You bought a MULTIPLAYER game, if you didn’t expect that kinda shit to happen I just don’t know what the fuck to tell you.
---
4. And finally the only reason I even fucking replied to your stupid ass comment to begin with. Your on at least your 2nd toon and you tell about 1, emphasis on the number ONE, jackass who griefed you. And you make your “Nice Community” like he is the stereotype when his type are actually only like 5% of the player base. ( And before some smart ass asks how I came up with my magical statistic, it’s just based on personal experiences.) while the rest of the player base is split into motherfuckers who want to either play a hero or ignore everyone on the server at all costs.

Maybe, but you'd have to be pretty lazy to not stumble on better prices.
---
I would like a Golden Grognak Axe.
---
Jeez idk I usually just choose a random person on the map to fuck with, do it about 10 times each time I'm online. Xbox?
---
Could you elaborate on that?
---
Just love it when you kill a level 65 SB and the body drops out of the sky and vanishes. Still, love the fight. As flawed as the SBs are, I still love slugging it out with them with reactive armor. Makes me grin when they take damage when they hit me.
---
You’re exactly why folks are angry at Fallout 76.
---
Tesla rifles are handy just for this.
---
 If you ignore the clubhouse to take a long walk, and know where to look, you can pick up about 40 cobalt flux from whitesprings if the nuke zone radius is just right while everyone is chasing ghouls at the same 3 places.
---
Who is talking about story/gameplay?
---
He swings and... miss! I don't care about people saying negative things *about the game*. Damn, I keep saying that if it is presented in a constructive manner, it's a good thing. People need to voice their opinions and give suggestions, so that the game can improve.
---
But a post like this, that is just complaining about the decision to make a certain game instead of another, serves no purpose. The game is done, it is what it is. Now, we can help to improve it, but bitching about *what it is* is useless.
---
On a sidenote, I find it pretty ironic that you talk about being mature, and yet you are so quick to call me names. Good job. You certainly won't see me doing that.
---
I mean i take them, but that's where my interactions with them usually end. Like you say, not worth spending any time building on them because you'll probably just disconnect withtin the next 15 minutes.

It's reasons like this that I'm really in no hurry to complete quests that reward unique gear.  I think there's definitely some kind of bug related to spontaneously losing inventory that will probably be ironed out in time.

I love the Trenches, for my Stealthy Sniper Build, it's heaven in the Wasteland, for some reason, when I hide in the Trenches the SBs quickly land for me, and that's when I show them my Explosive Shotgun, but they only get to see it for a couple of seconds if you know what I mean.
---
I found an explosive cryolator with that mod, and that thing wrecks a scorchbeast.  I say a scorchbeast because it breaks almost immediately.
---
You didn’t actually read is post did you? He trains monsters (ghouls) onto the lowbies and lets them die that way.
---
I would, but given your responses I have the suspicion that what you are looking for isn't a discussion, but 'yes men'.
---
Sorry, I'm not that guy.
---
I'm trying.  Last night I crashed when a nuke dropped on Whitesprings.  I just went to bed since it was well past my bedtime.  I woke up today and everything was ok. No urge to blog about it, no feeling of being a victim, no cries for justice. The few fun hours before the crash are not lost on me.  I have crashed 6 or 7 times since launch and it blows the haters minds that I'm able to just get over it and enjoy the game.
---
Scorchbeasts as flying tunnelers?

They just really really needed to fingerpaint at that moment.

It doesn't cost a few million for them to run servers for 9 months.
---
They probably already made a profit off this game alone if they are willing to sell it for 40 dollars.
---
&gt; Super mutants? I think you mean KHORNATE CULTISTS
---
Their fortifications always look like cogboy creations to me.
---
I got booted while walking outside of Whitespring the other day. I knew what would happen when I loaded back in, and sure enough, it did.
---
Then some b-hole named Lone Ulysses stole all my junk and killed me.
---
Must have something bugging out on you, because I've still got a little budget after a 2 story barn house w/ 4 doors, 3 beds, PA station, cooking x2/armor/weapon/tinker/chem x2 benches, Artillery, 2 staircases, full acoustic instruments set, 5 Industrial Water Purifiers, 2 normal Water Purifiers, Powered Garage Door, Terminal, and a fusion generator.... (Takes a breath) You might want to look into that budget, lol.
---
Just open your pip boy and it cancels the charge
---
Only ever dead ones.....
---
i dont mind where you camp.  however it is really easy to walk to the resort and it has all the crafting tables and places to sell and stash boxes also :)
---
i wish they would let us have our main camp and then a 'petite' tent camp...like allowed 1 small no foundation tent, no defenses, 1 stash box and 1 workbench.  small build area of like 15'.
---
Agreed 
---
I don’t know why SB hangout there so much
---
You don't speak for all players or fans. Don't start with "as we all know". 
---
I play on console. I get disconnected. I get crashes. I get some ridiculous lag when I go to Whitesprings even when it *isn't* a nuke zone. If I'm lucky, I'll arrive again properly a minute or two after appearing to arrive.
---
Getting hit by melee enemies who are 20 feet away is always fun, too.
---
&gt;I think it's important that people bring up the same topics over and over again, so Bethesda knows what was wrong with the release.
---
That, specifically.
---
Yeah it’s dumb,  I’ve literally been underground and the sonic beams come through the dirt ceiling and hit you.
---
I’m nearly lv 70 and lv 24 assultrons still fuck me up due to this bug the main beam is deadly all I can normally do is get in melee range ASAP so they want to melee me instead of beam 
---
How about they load us in when we're actually able to move and not just sit there and bake in 1000s of rads while assets load.
---
HOLY SHIT IF I SPAWN IN MID AIR AT MY CAMP AND TAKE ENOUGH DAMAGE I ALMOST DIE JUST IN TIME FOR A GROUP OF SUPER MUTANTS TO SPANK MY ASS WITH BOARDS AGAIN I'LL BE A TEDDY BEAR COLLECTOR SHUT-IN FOR THE REST OF THE GAME.
---
you can ignore the forest treasure maps unless you need some junk, other maps give at least a chance to obtain power armor plans.
---
I built a really cool camp with one far off in the distance way out of aggro range and thought "hmm I'll load up on missile turrets/ heavy turrets in case he comes by".  Of course he starts to slowly swoop over for no reason at all....I'm a power fist/ shotgun character and I figured the turrets/random poking shots  would get him to land. He just started the glitchy infinite sonic spam and wrecked everything in my camp in like 3 seconds. Best part is only one of the turrets even worked to shoot at him and the missile glitched and was just stuck in mid air like it was frozen in time. 
---
Burnt through a ton of stims before he finally landed and was able to kill him with my power fist....but holy shit that was an INFURIATING game experience. Nothing worked like it should lmao. I don't mind a very difficult boss enemy but PLEASSSSSE just make them actually work correctly. 
---
This must be what god sees when he looks down upon us with anger and wrath. 
---
Agreed it needs to be balanced well though so it can't just become meta. Say it has a minute cooldown or something would be good. Great idea have an up vote
---
Details...?
---
That is not opinion, that is fact. If dev came to you and gave you account with everything unlocked, would you play game longer than you would when you had account that had 0 things unlocked? 
---
I think somebody's already made a better inventory mod for 76, I've just not looked for one yet.  
---
The only mod I do have is the text chat mod which is TBH something that needed to be part of the game to begin with.  It's so handy to find stuff or to group up with people.
---
Bear arms max lvl makes them weight practically nothing, so I just carry around about 5 at any given time.
---
I use my mouse keys for crouching {stealth} and vats. So it's possible, dunno about the favorite wheel.
---
Dude tryna compare ur price to NPC vendors. I told you'd id pay 50. Greedy ass just wanna gouge.
---
wither? no idea on what should happen
---
There should be be a mutation that sends you into an alternate reality where this game works, and servers aren’t frequently crashing because of a game breaking glitch that has yet to be fixed.
---
If your Hard Drive space is at such a premium that you uninstalled it, then you should leave it uninstalled and go play browser games instead.
---
Indeed. I'm in southern WV, so the Hinton Dairy Queen is a big one for me. Love going down in the summer and eating those chili dogs and watching folks on the river.
---
it only shows that ATOM symbol once you place it down and pick it back up. If you store it in the stash or log out, the symbol goes away and it looks like any other power armor set.
---
With video games we should be fans of the individuals if anything. The company names are all meaningless anyway. How many times has Atari gone broke and been sold? It'd be weird if movie fans were big MGM fanboys etc.
---
This is a good point.  I just hate throwing stuff away when it could be used and appreciated by other players.  
---
Also, I remember starting and never having enough ammo at the beginning.
---
That's true, I usually don't go into the resort with a nuke zone active, it gets all glitchy and reposnds weird. 
---
That would be a cool little I idea. 
---
Announcing later announcements is good communication --any corporate person
---
Also I think the nuke silos have gyms as well. 
---
They close their eyes?
---
why would that be a mutation and not simply be fatigued 
---
Last time somebody said to me they don't want to mutate because that is their playstyle and we agreed he has right to remain stupid
---
That would actually be awesome if they did that. Although I think it would take a lot of scaling in other parts of the game, like enemies. The game would get pretty easy if we started getting higher level weapons. Is that the current plan?
---
You got it for 1 cap bro. Why so aggro? 
---
cArL ... CaAaArRRrRlLlLlL
---
Ok, let me put it this way: even if you're 100% right that their intent was a weapon that ignored cover, what kind of stupid fight mechanic depends on punishing a player for being smart and getting to cover? Like, we're supposed to just stand out in the open like morons getting Acid-Trip Fruit Looped in the face...?
---
I didn't play previous Fallout games, but from the reviews and general reception, they were received well, I think. But is it like a common thing that every Fallout is unstable from release or something? And all these stability issues are normal?
---
I asked the same question before and someone said it still works with it on. I never tired it myself because by the time I have enough to buy it from the enclave i was too I cared to waste it so I took it off just in case 
---
Wiat, what? You mean this game will be dynamic and ever changing? Mind blown!
---
Yeah I saw the place to rebind for control, but haven't been able to for items :( I'm thinking I might have to bind the buttons on mouse &amp; foot-pedal to keyboard keys and make kind of a jank binding relay lol
---
Not everybody with an explosive weapon is cheating. And you can’t tell by watching if a shotgun is two shot so he may have not even had a TSE. 
---
One guy I saw had a really cool set up an built a full compound. He had the camp dupe happen an just went with it an had about 8 or 9 different buildings. Really looked like it belonged an was nice. If I can find where I saw it again I will add the link.
---
Yes in fallout NV the flaregun scared away any animal including Deathclaws we need that to make the Flare gun usable maybe like have it as an upgrade you can get 
---
It’s a feature.
---
Holy fuck I shoulda checked the terminals! I went on my way South... West I think to a dude's bunker.
---
Yes but in this case the game specifically distinguishes between the two.
---
Yeah I saw two killing stuff just south of Mt Blair...with their range of “automatic player detection” it meant I couldn’t do anything in the Ash Heap without them eventually ruining my day. This was as a melee character. Sometimes they just stay airborne for so long, and their blasts that they spam constantly are unavoidable, it’s almost as if Bethesda purposely made them so they’d waste your Stimpaks. They’re not fun or satisfying to kill because you’re made to feel like the fight was just a waste of resources.
---
Lmao that dude mad 
---
I have 6 charisma.. the problem is the "rabdom encounter" what do you mean for that?
---
GG
---
For now its dog food all day long.
---
yup, tried repair, didn't help, they just disappear, this was a bug they fixed, but it came back :/
---
I have 2 pump actions, one lvl 35 and one lvl 45. With all the strength perks for shotgun (30% shotgun damage x3 = 9 perk points) and the explosive damage buff in intelligence (100% damage bonus = 5 perk points), then bloody mess in luck (15% damage = 3 perk points). That's 17 perk points dedicated to damage buffs...
---
This gives the lvl 45 pump action 656 damage, and the lvl 35 something like 550. That's nothing compared to some melee builds and it certainly doesn't 1 shot everything.
---
The stupid thing is the range not the damage, shotguns shouldn't be effective from across the map. But shotguns with explosive bullets should be lethal within sensible ranges.
---
I think it's to prevent player traps. Build a two story home. Place Punji boards on the floor below, and a platform for the player to stand on. Shoot out the floor the target is on. Target falls in, dies, and can never get their junk back.
---
Now, does it matter to me? Nah, I wouldn't care, it's just junk. But they seem to heavily err on the side of preventing unwanted PvP, so I would guess it is because of this, or a relic of before they opened up fast travel for escape. I'd be happy if they removed it, but I can see why it is like that. With any luck, they'll tune up the build system in the future.
---
I only heard ONE story where a guy shot the flare and two other players came to save him 
---
I don't mean to sound like a dick but losing the All Rise is hardly worth fretting over. I'm sure someone here would be willing to donate theirs. hell, I'd go through the quest for you if I wasn't on PC.
---
I once lost a piece of legendary gear that took me a week of farming, so yeah. same bug apparently.
---
I saw the plans for "welcome mats" at one of the Enclave vendors last night. Only reason I didn't buy them is I thought people said they don't work. So is it that people just don't think they exist? That they don't exist? Or both? Cuz if they do work, and people just don't think they exist I'm grabbing those suckers if I see them again!
---
I wear headphones playing, I just listen for the buzzing and usually have no problem finding piles.
---
Do a circle and determine direction ... loot, loot, loot.
---
Wow, incredible, but no turrets ?
---
no idea what going on :(
---
I guess I don't see where your coming from when you say the OP is asking for a different game. To me a different game would be mean a different story or game play. The OP spoke about issues, bugs and a lack of polish. 
---
As for you side note. Re-read what I wrote, i said if you can't reply in a mature manner, or not reply at all you ACTIONS are childish and ridiculous. That is not the same as name calling.
---
They could just as easily turn down the help. But you are right. If I was just given a TSE gun and sent on my way I would likely be bored of the game.
---
if they ever feel like revamping the syringer into an actual useful support weapon we could have a paralyze dart that makes them land
---
I really thought they were gonna put in a Gino's Pizza
---
I am dumbfounded they didn't put in a Tudor's Biscuit World
---
been killing scorchbeasts for the past hour and that's definitely a no.
---
Yes it was, maybe now you could realise stuff like "as we all know" makes you an idiot.
---
Maybe an unarmed damage buff, because you're so hungry and thirsty you're ravenous.
---
Let's try not to be a basic bitch his early....please assume my trigger some more short bus.
---
good to know, I always keep that set on me, so I would have never known. 
---
One bad tato spoils the whole damn bunch.
---
A purpose for the flare gun AND a way to deal with Scorchbeasts?
---
#HELLO, BETHESDA? THIS IS IT CHIEF.
---
Ohh I read between the lines. 
---
thankfully the little speakers are super cheap to repair, it's like 1 steel each.
---
This needs to be higher up.
---
You left it you can't be surprised he took it. 
---
....and then disconnected....
---
Honestly, when I decide to remove a building, I tend to just "Move camp" to the same place I already am, then delete the automaticly created plans and start fresh. But that's me, not everyone would like it.
---
So you are saying you want to let everyone have equal shares? That sounds like something a COMMUNIST RED MENACE would say, that is not the American Capitalist way.
---
i was looting  world containers in building near camp , got flagged "wanted" for stealing. yep.
---
Enforcer perk bb
---
I love it when (yes I'm going to compare the two) David Lynch and the Fallout crew make details like that that defy logical explanation.
---
It does cost a few million to make a game though. 
---
Me and my team had the queen spawned in and 3 more decided to just pop out of know where, the sound that one makes is bad enough but 3 at a time is hell in your ears 
---
Right on. We need at least one bad guy for every person dropping loot for L1's. Thank you for your service!!
---
Any particular location within the Toxic Valley? I want to hear these whispers!
---
Again, I know the Axe will be a worthy replacement. It just sucks to use a weapon from like, lv60 to almost lv100, and have it just vanish.
---
yeah its a pain cause I like collecting PA and using them for different things so I have to pull out like 6 and deploy all of em to find the one I want even though only 2 are painted.
---
The profit from releasing early (before the holiday season) with an unfinished product was estimated to be greater than the profit of releasing a higher quality product. The original product can be updated over time and the atom store can rake in tons of extra cash. Profit is the motivation.
---
The animal must be a random spawn, not tied to an event where it will continually respawn. Look up random encounter map on google and it should be the first link. I’m at work or I would link it. 
---
what do you mean theres no cosmetic camp items for fridge? the milk machine and nuka cola machine are literally fridges
---
tood 
---
Had three spawn at whitesprings... the one I had wittled down the most had landed but a fucking protectron ran in front of me as I started firing -.-
---
I will be the better man and say that we agree to disagree.
---
Good talk.
---
I did it and completed it right at the last second, while overencumbered and slowly walking towards the last broken thing to repair, did it just in like the very last second. It was intense.
---
Yes, yes I am 😄 I have a junk-extractor in my camp btw 😋
---
(feel free to add me: TeddyTurner 😁) 
---
So, to make sense, that damage multiplier shouldn't increase *self damage*.  Unless you are TRYING to shoot yourself, but the game doesn't have an option "shoot self" - only "splash damage".
---
Common? It's guaranteed.
---
No they do not, a gold and red clad power fist shall bring down the fury of the Emperor!
---
what if they didnt welcome mats to the game but instead of it being a welcome mate its the C.A.M.P builder
---
Have you tried the rug trick? I have not, but I hear it solves a lot of issues. If you are not aware, you place a rug down, and then the thing(s) you want to move on the rug. When you move the rug afterwards, it apparently removed the collision on the non-rug part(s).
---
...you can look it up. Do research before accusing.
---
Head to uncanny caverns and there’s a gift shop with a lot of those. Make sure to get the helmet as there are both hats and helmets. 
---
I can get one for you if you can basically wait a whole day haha. 
---
Connect the foundations and then REMOVE the foundations you don’t want so you can like have 4 corners closed with ground and stuff only works for foundations 
---
Not really? I don't mind defending myself if scorched or super mutants are trying to kill me. Heck, I love it. My sniper rifle is great! 
---
But in RDR2 you just straight up murder people, kidnap them, rob them, beat them up, and I just... meh? I don't mind defending myself against outlaws trying to kill me, but actually BEING an outlaw, I don't really like I guess? I do like helping random people pinned under dead horses or bit by snakes tho. 
---
Someone did this for me when i was level 5-ish, basically mic'd over and said there was power armor and plans over in an area in a building i was in. I was skeptical of taking but it all worked out. Since then any duplicate items plans/recipes i would leave in visible areas for others to take. Glad people are paying it forward. 
---
Same. Lead deposit near cliff side with precious water below...so close to being able to place purifiers, but not close enough. :(
---
Yes, if you mostly happen to take perks that unlock only at higher levels, you may be forced to take a few you dont want at earlier levels. That happened to me on my character. I believe the nukes and dragons site takes that into consideration when they tell you the level you need to get to pick all the cards you want.
---
My solution was to pick up 3 ranks of pharma farma (under luck) and 3 of lead belly (under endurance) since I had enough luck and endurance for it. It made the lower levels a bit less tedious. If your new, I'll warn you that pharma farma isn't automatic ... having the perk equipped doesnt generate extra meds unless you press the search button that the perk card adds to med containers (med kits, mirrors, doctors bags, some chem boxes).
---
Anyway, when you cant actually select any perks you want, consider a quality of life perk. Also, in case you didnt know, when you level up and increase a stat, you are then shown perk cards to select from which match the stat you increased. But you are not limited to only cards from that stat; they just filtered them to show you related perks. But you could totally bump luck by 1 when you level while selecting an agility perk or vice versa; there is a button to switch which stat-related perks to pick from when you level up.
---
Have fun!!
---
A plus and PSA for Solo players:  Only one speaker needs to be working when the timer runs out.  Same thing at any other event that requires keeping multiple machines running ie:  Uranium Fever, Feed the People.  Hunker down and defend/repair one thing.
---
Except, rather than how Ark forces you to manually place the spoil items in the fridge, give this one a passive ability that applies to the whole stash just to be sure.
---
Do you have a lever action plan by chance? I'm a lvl 66.
---
Welp I have school in 5 min.
---
Grognak Axe can not be repaired to 200% despite perk equipped.
---
PC / monokoi
---
I have like 4 extras can’t even sell these things 
---
Yeah I quickly realised that getting close and meleeing them was the best counter I found.
---
They still fire their glitch beam whilst clawing though so to counter this I strafe and hack  whilst circling them
---
I wish I had some inkling as to how much of each material I actually should have on hand!  I guess I need to pay more attention to what I am using.  Do I need more than 30 glass or crystal?  Do I ever not need to pick up adhesive?  I have no idea!
---
So pretty much what I just had said?
---
They have grounds for legal action there, however I do feel it was in the way to get them good reputation under the "we're protecting you from a scam," area.
---
This FO76 is different and isolated as stated. They're not going to waste resources on taking these people down. It's up to us to not buy from them and encourage others not to as well.
---
Also if you lockpick a container in a camp or workshop you'll get wanted. Even if it was one that was already in the world before they took it. 
---
Looks good, m8!
---
Those are the concrete walls I’m talking about they take like 2 steel and 5 concrete and consume a huge budget but they can make perfect squares and are good defensively 
---
You're right. The only verified accounts that can trigger the BethesdaReplied bot are all CMs. 
---
I am level 82, and at lower levels, I use to run in fear of them. When I finally got to the point where I felt like "OK, let's do this", it was exciting to take one down, but the loot was really disappointing. Now, with an explosive shotgun, I can solo 3 at a time with ease.  But what's the point?  Sure the xp is nice enough, but there is never any decent loot.  For something that's kind of at the top of the mob food chain, it's all a bit disappointing.
---
On a side note, last week I launched my first nuke. I was running it solo, but ran in to 2 others doing it too, so we loosely teamed up and then I entered the code and launched.  Made it to the nuke site, killed the queen and looted gear fast.  I noticed some good 2 or 3 star gear and figured I'd look at it when I got back to my CAMP, but when I checked my inventory, there was nothing there!  This happened to me again another time in a queen fight, where I looted gear that disappeared from my inventory.
---
Frustrating.
---
I have found several ladders that I am able to walk up when not in PA
---
Yeah, use those points for QoL perks that you can take off later for your final build.
---
I would love it. Im one of those that spends hours building CAMP and love it.  man it would be nice to have a tiny tent/stash/workbench to move around with me....like dont even make it a leaveable item that is a fast travel point...like it goes in your inventory and travels with you if you choose to use it.  could weight 30lbs as far as im concerned.  
---
i like to get nuked flora when white springs is hit...but i dont go farm because its not as exciting as a SBQ to me.  there is a spot north of white springs...usually full of super mutants when not nuked.  the field between their camp and whitesprings has loads of flora!  
---
I guess you have never met the CLIFFRACERs.
---
Nope but I can craft you 2-3 for free
---
Aw now my epic struggle against all odds seems trivialized. But that is good to know thanks.
---
you have to damage them yourself for them to drop loot 
---
I think its just "lever gun"
---
The game is not going F2P
---
We need portable AA missiles.
---
Just a warning, no matter were you ask, you will normally get a bias of some kind, but in my eyes it's a matter of "did you enjoy the mechanics of Fallout 4" if not, then you probably wont be thrilled too much by this game 
---
Lvl116 on X-Box.  Never had any inventory disappear.  Guess I'm just lucky.
---
Have you checked your stored blue prints items probably duplicated when you moved just break down one of the blue prints and scrap everything 
---
I had them originally, but I've found them mostly to be useless and a waste of budget. Frankly I only put up the artillery because it looks cool, and I wanted to try it. Next aha building moment I have though and it's probably buh-bye artillery lol. Back around early December I had a huge duplication problem on my camp budget. I had built a small little adhesive farm and the game decided to store x20 or so of all of my crops. So say I had 8 corn, well it would store 160 friggin corn. After I decided to make the best of a bad situation and voraciously craft vegetable starch &gt; adhesive out of it, I had to pack mule the rest to vendors to sell for a week or so to finally be rid of all of it. It was crazy. Long story short, take a peek at your stored tab. God knows what little surprises this game stored away for you, that is eating at your budget, lol.
---
77 but I've been using that knife since lvl 50
---
Lol, when skins costs like 400 caps, that is like same good as free. Its like the "Predator" skin in Battlefield that Angry Joe talked about- "Ooo boy such as cool skin...wait what everyone have it?"
---
Summerville lake? 
---
I'm at work right now, but I would appreciate it. That way I can get some plans from scrapping them. I will be on later this afternoon if you will be on. I can message you if you want.
---
Besides making melee and unarmed builds almost entirely useless when they never land forcing you into a play style you don’t want. 
---
justrpgthings.jpg
---
It's a throwaway base. They don't give a shit. 
---
No problem!(Raider Scum)
---
Have you checked your stored tab you may have a duplicated blueprint if you break it down then break down the stuff in it should fix if that’s the problem
---
&gt;stitches stay behind
---
I see what you did there...
---
Trust me— until now the glitches and issues I’ve read about on this subreddit have always happened to “someone else.” I think the harsh reality I learned today is I’m “someone else” to someone else.
---
I can't even get the damn vendor to spawn. I keep getting mongrels to spawn there :\
---
Knowing Bethesda, it wouldn't surprise me if this was true.
---
Ask a WoW player that one.
---
I haven't found marsupial yet, and I seem condemned to only get Rad Worms ;(
---
Sure, feel free to add me
---
Yes, but the types don't stack, and it takes a stack of 10 to make 1 fertilizer. 
---
10 spoiled vegetables
---
10 spoiled meat
---
If they would stack, it might be a little more user friendly. 
---
To shoot the ceiling or hog kills? 
---
Allahu akbar
---
sure but luckily Fallout 76 reused literally all the assets from Fallout 4 and there is even some Skyrim assets in there too. So they saved some money there.
---
Also their netcode is unencrypted plain text so they saved money hiring an amateur instead of a professional. 
---
but you get 1000+ caps from each vendor everyday + you can sell legendary items to other player. Or buy plans from other player. I sell almost every plan/recipe I have for 20 caps ea. 
---
That is one POV. Personally, I look at Plague Walker as the silver lining / minor mitigation for any disease. I wouldn't want it to be permanent, because most diseases just suck. Forcing me to use disease cures to cleanse myself if I have that mutation would only make me want to stop using it.
---
I want one of those so bad now! Granted my cryolator is of the furious variety, so it can get a little wacky but who doesn't love explosives?!
---
Dof is tied with motion blur as some of the worst things to ever happen to gaming in terms of graphics.
---
Its the first thing I turn off in every game first.
---
I don't see a problem with that.  This game has an opportunity for an entirely player driven end game.  I love the fact that I'll either get to hunt or become a raider type character in the end.
---
Been looking for it too. Love the look of it and wanted it for a raider look as well. But RIP the dream I don't think it is in the game currently.
---
They have the same effect, but they apply to a different pool of creatures. Animal friend is more for “animal” type creatures - Yao Guai, deathclaws, radstag, etc.   whereas wasteland whisperer applies to creatures that are less like animals - the various mirelurk varieties, hermit crabs, radscorpions, several cryptids, etc. and also ghouls scorched and super mutants, for whatever reason. Although those later three I’m fairly certain can’t be tamed, just pacified.
---
or you could just scroll your mouse down 3 times and look at numbers... we dont need these kind of changes when their plate is overflowing with real high priority stuff to fix
---
I tried a build with all of the mutations, and a good way to keep at least one disease is by only eating spoiled food.
---
Workbenches etc. that get destroyed should be visible in build mode to then repair them individually, too.
---
“Whatcha thinking about?”
---
Not worth the carry weight then. lol
---
Try "Cliff Watch" to the SW of Top of the World. It is a raider camp and it always has a raider set there. 
---
It does have a downside, it's ALWAYS active whether you have a disease or not and if you try sneaking past anything and get too close it deals zero damage and alerts them. 
---
And here I use that mission to farm weapons to scrap for steel. They usually only attack one speaker for me so just have to defend that.
---
I'll do it when I get home PSN is UnbracingTwo4.
---
Here’s a quick tip to fight them a little easier
---
1 open the man
---
2 open the social tab or ( for me lb  as I play on xbox)
---
Navigate to your name at the top and select this
---
Click leave world
---
Now the scorchbeast is gone
---
I'd be fine if I could not get rid of illnesses once caught with plauge walker. So long as that the aura scales with the amount and types of diseases.
---
Dysentery is not easy to negate on top of speed demon. 
---
Parasites are the same though with food.
---
All the worms are pretty detrimental.
---
They do get worse as they keep stacking and if they stay the aura should basically one shot things, lol.
---
I would also be down for a way to cure specific mutations, much like you can pick and choose with serums. Cost being the same, though to cure.
---
Okay I need to know. Can it be tamed?

I'd say if you can rebind the mouse keys to numbers on the keyboard you could do it that way.  IDK how many buttons the game understands natively though besides the wheel click and a single thumb button.  I'll give it a test with my three thumb buttons and the left and right wheel clicks on my mouse to see what it recognizes.
---
You can’t get 1000caps from each vendor if they only have 200caps for 20 hours... I’ve never found a player that would buy anything from me and you can’t sell plans to vendors sadly
---
But butt fuckit
---
Paint me like one of your French ghouls.
---
Yeah if game mechanics allow people to be assholes you should expect people to be assholes.
---
Or have the ammo like new vegas where we can multiple ammo types.
---
I can see how that phrase can make someone sound like an idiot to some. However, I find that to be quite close-minded, as merely using a provocative phrase, which reflects my idea of general reception of the release, in the start of a post to attract readers, shouldn't make anyone an idiot. Clearly you liked the release build. Anywho, I realised, thanks to you, that I wrote the beginning maybe too hastily. Thanks for the comments, though!
---
Last laugh, that destroyer card and the perk that makes grenade blast 50 percent bigger
---
Exactly why id like some basic stuff available to everyone. Sure, plenty of people will look similar, but we do already. Maybe everyone on your team wears black, but one arm piece is painted a specific color to that person. 
---
Just simple paint options that will add countless color combo possibilities.
---
I built on top of the waterfall by crashed plane. Out of the way and 0 turrets needed. The grass at Whitesprings may be nice but my view can’t be beat.
---
How about taking damage with no one around only to have a ghoul mob materialize 10 seconds later. I probably look like a fool, but when I take random damage, I start swinging anticipating the ghoul mob. Sometimes it’s just random damage (which is odd in itself)
---
If only we had the ability to inspect the frame and it actually shows what pieces are mounted, that would save me so much sbq set up time.
---
Pff. I assure you, the Guard is far more useful than that.
---
***REMINDER THAT CADIA CRACKED BEFORE THE GUARD DID***
---
This is a fantastic idea.
---
Disclaimer : This guy does not actually know what he is talking about
---
Do you fall through the flooring, or is it just invisible. Sounds like you (or someone) deleted flooring textures. But that's interesting, idk. 
---
Oh yeah. Well last time I drove by there it still had water....lol. 
---
But it's a nice little made lake. I like some of the more southern and eastern attractions specifically Seneca Rocks, Black water falls, and New river Valley gorge.
---
Wtf is the point of this post? It's like some AI bot tried to write a FO76 call-out post and failed. 
---
Have you taken rad x?
---
At level 28, you're hitting a timeframe where those weapon perks are going to become more important than thequality of life stuff. If you're undecided on build, spend a few on a balanced split between gun and melee- like adding rifleman to you two-handed stuff you have already. 
---
No, because even garbage cans can have useful resources occasionally. 
---
It doesn't have to be flashy. 
---
I saw a bucket of blue paint last night. Maybe I dipped my gun into it ... and then dismantled it to get the paint out of the barrel and internals ...but it is my blue gun!
---
Pain train perk is soooooo much fun. A ghoul runs towards you, you run straight at him. Groups of zombies comes towards you, just run straight through them and headbutt every single one on the way past.
---
When I took the picture, all I saw was Fort Defiance, Watoga, and nuked Fissure Prime, but now I realize that you can see Tangra Town (the big tree) way in the distance on the left
---
Ah, I'll try it when I get home. Thanks. 
---
WITNESS ME 
---
Uh, yes. It's like everyone complaining about crashes in 76 never played New Vegas. Oh wait...
---
Nah mate, you can't dig your way out of this, lesson for the future, think before you write.
---
I see. It's good to know the release wasn't so bad to many people.
---
Zug zug
---
I'd say, if you're not into wearing power armor, and have something like trapper armour equipped, the additional always on rad resist might be worth it.  However, if you primarily wear power armor, no, it's not worth it.
---
I have noticed whenever I am in melee range when she dies, I see loot instantly but if I am at medium-long range, nothing will ever appear (even with a wait of 5 mins). 
---
Are you in a team when it happened? I lose all the beneficial aspects of mutations when I join a team but the member is not on the server. Click the stats then effects tab next time it happens and see what's listed. Right now, if I'm in a team and the person leaves but doesn't drop team before I have to manually drop team. Also had it happen when I send the invite but they haven't accepted yet.
---
Those colors are only there because there is a Fallout 4 quest associated with them. 
---
I appreciate you trying to help, but this is a known bug where duplicated stored items generate an error when trying to scrap them, preventing you from getting rid of it. There's nothing players can do to fix it.
---
its much more rewarding to farm them yourself unless you're just trying to get them all +class freak then it borders on tedious. i'm melee and i'm cherry picking my mutations to only get ones that wont mess with my strength since i dont want class freak. so far i've picked up 6 or 7 mutations i want to keep while getting 4-5 that i had to cross my fingers and eat a diluted rad x and pray it didnt take one i wanted to keep. more fun to me than just buying them from dupers on the marketplace
---
I work with devops everyday,  IRL for enterprise wide custom PAAS solutions. Disagree.
---
Wasteland whisperer perk. 
---
Ps4? Try this
---
i beat the game before lvl 45 with a combat shotgun, combat rifle and all rise 
---
What if it was her though... 
---
Fuck yeah!
---
I sympathize with your position. I've been there myself. One reason why I always try to team up when I do SBQ fights. If I lose connection, I can rejoin my team. Granted, that doesn't help one iota if the server crashes, but you know, we can only do so much.
---
I would love to participate in something like this. Lately I feel like I've run out of things to do so player held events would help bring some excitement back into the game.
---
End game content is not beating the story
---
1600 caps?
---
Check it with a stopwatch
---
lol- it's fan fiction, sadly. There is no proof. Eagerly awaiting patch notes about the nerf to "Legendary Long Dog" glitch, tho'.  :)
---
Better than most what? There are a few corners of the game that are pretty good. I agree that the complaints you mentioned above are unreasonable. 
---
Did you clear it before the event started?
---
What would be the point of making a massive building if your budget wears out before you can fill it with stuff?
---
This. I was given Marsupial from a team member and have had it for months. I don't have luck point room for Class Freak so I avoid the other mutations. I never remove Starched Genes (2 points) and have never lost the mutation after taking 100s of Rad-aways. 
---
Did he say this recently?
---
I see you also only use the mr fuzzy head as well
---
i have the opiscite of this glitch i guess my water purifies got deleted
---
Yea that let me get out of my power armor during the glitch but I was unable to ever use it again (until they fixed it) as every time I entered power armor the glitch would recreate itself. It really sucked.
---
Oh I realize that I have a unscrappable water purifier. Some people don’t know to check for duplicated blue prints and 80% of the time that’s the problem
---
Sorry but I captured the ammo factory, Grafton steel and Charleston scrap yard and managed to make 4000 5.56 ammo in 2 hours of play. That's highly worth having and keeping.
---
I think I'm gonna server hop to find these builds and then sit on the roof with a tesla and zap the crowds, I play in passive mode so can't damage other players, not even the slap, not sure about bases but will be fun to find out. Only twice have I acquired a wanted level and both times I had a hard time getting someone to kill me, stood naked in the Whitespring courtyard asking over area chat for someone to kill me.This took 10 minutes the first time and the 2nd over 2 hours of stalking players on the map before a player took pity and shot me, didn't even stop running just shot me in passing and kept going to wherever they were headed.
---
If you killed them so easy you wouldn’t be bitching about it on the internet
---
Game over xD
---
Nobody knows what the plan is, really. Except we'll have new vaults and pvp with the existing busted stuff- lol.
---
I'd also recommend not doing line in the sand event solo, it's do able but you won't be in for a good time that's for sure 
---
What's wrong w the camps at the golf club?(I got mine at the beginning of the golf course on flat land)
---
Their business model is cash for cosmetics, think.
---
I too love Fallout/Skyrim....I have played a ton and have literally never been griefed. I don't have any friends that play either. Most everybody is trying to co-op help each other out. I love the game but currently I'd hold off based on what you are saying. I'm content playing a fallout game alone with occasional social interaction and I really enjoy the base building so it works for me.
---
I would wait 1-2 months to see what Bethesda does to fix things. This game is still not complete and riddled with issues. Item duping, glitches, things just disappearing, crashes, infinite loading times, lack of end game/mission content, pvp is a joke may as well not exist.
---
Today there is a bethesda article going out. If they truly can fix these issues, add player trading, and fix pvp then I'd say it's a very good sign. If in a month or two this game is as it stands I do not think you will enjoy it based off this post
---
Again I said I dont agree with it. I'm simply saying logically the outrages prices Bethesda has set are a problem.
---
Shoot fire your all the way in Hinton, I haven't been that way in a hot minute. Been around that area a few times where I did some monitoring well sampling at the Gas station there in Ghent.
---
That’s the only gun melee builds will run.
---
Get ready for the "raiders".
---
This is posted almost every bloody day... Bethesda pls maybe??
---
I wish I had the option to adjust visuals on my console. Everything looks kinda blurry in the distance. Kinda like looking through glasses that are smudged with fingerprints. 
---
Same. I try to leave my door open whenever I can remember, too.
---
Hmm I've used the station there and haven't lost my mutation but since Radaway is everywhere I'll avoid it. Thanks.
---
Yeah, I've got the body too, but I think it looks funnier in contrast with a really proper and clean outfit
---
That place is  lag central for me.
---
"Where the lack of magic happens" lol
---
I barely even notice the difference between lv. 50 and 80 SBs other than the lower lv. one goes down a bit faster.
---
Nope. I don't even keep that stuff in my inventory any more.
---
Is that what your doing? It seems to me that when I highlight that your definition of what makes a game differs from my view, instead of clarifying your view you run away. I dont even know what we are agreeing to disagree about since you dont care to elaborate on what it is that makes you think the OP wants a different game. Do you really think that's what it means to "be the better man"? The sarcastic "good talk" doesn't help your claim of moral high ground either.
---
It also helps with Scorchbeasts.  The flying echo spam is an energy attack.
---
Hm. I'll have to check on this. Thanks.
---
I need this my friend made his camp and now we spawn under it so I need to use power armor to get out
---
If you're on xbox, I sell mutation serums for 300 each (when I'm online)
---
I got it off the SB queen you witch hunting little troll. Go crawl back in your hole with that unnecessary hostility.
---
Mmh what about the frogs?
---
I haven't played FO76 since before Thanksgiving at least. Probably a couple weeks before then, too. 
---
Stuff like this made it really not fun. I do like playing Fallout games and was excited to be able to play online, but things like Scorchbeasts, bugs, managing my inventory made the game not even remotely enjoyable. 
---
I had mine up there for awhile but ended up getting my camp wiped before the patch :(
---
And people wonder why I wear my Power Armor all the time in Harper's Ferry
---
My prediction: I'm sure some people here on Reddit will express interest and even go so far as to commit. Then your event will come along and will receive basically zero participation.
---
I've seen *many* outstanding community or unique ideas, etc. pass through, and people simply don't seem to get involved with them in this game. Look at the *actual* Bethesda-organised New Year's Eve event as an example...
---
System? 
---
When I checked 11 (I believe) days after launch Fallout 76 was $40 while Call of Duty 4, Battlefield V, Red Dead 2, and others were still $60. From what I heard Call of Duty 4 and Battlefield V didn't do very good, so you'd expect those two to also be on sale if an 11 day old game is already 2/3 the price of what it was.
---
Need someone to tuck you in? Ana/support main here as well.
---
Sounds good to me!
---
I would be there of course :) 
---
I honestly don't recall ever having a limb break.  I don't have adamantium Perk. 
---
I’m using it with garb of mystery and eye of ra 
---
Do they phone you up afterwards to see if you got it?
---
I did the responder quests thinking I would get access to tech exactly like that.  It even said my Pipboy was supposed to alert me when Scorched /Beast were around and made a huge deal of the "lures."
---
&gt; going rate is a lot cheaper
---
... **because they're duped**.
---
There is no legitimate player source for this item.  If someone has one they either bought it or duped it.
---
You'll get to the point where you can 3 shot a lvl 50 scorchbeast. We wrecked the queen last night in less than 5 minutes. I don't use any of those duplicated guns either. However, regular scorchbeast rewards are pitiful, they need a better loot system for sure; there really is no point in fighting them. After we wrecked the legendary scorchbeast Queen, a regular lvl 80 scorchbeast spawned and was doing significantly more damage.. it doesn't even make sense.
---
He spawns from the Blackwater Mine area and walks over with a group of his buddies. Also Bog town usually has a behemoth. 
---
Are you using mods, or have you used a fallout76custom.ini to customize options manually? If so there’s a line that needs to be added to fix that. 
---
Thinking about it, there are some materials that I really don't need to keep any of on hand.  Like Bone.  What do I use bone for?  No idea, but if I needed some, I'm sure one run of blackwater mine would get me whatever I needed.  What else is like that? Acid? Concrete?
---
Yep, not everyone needs to act nice and friendly. Saw some guys  trading at a c.a.m.p. and I thought that they were dupers but they didn't drop bags.
---
So I discovered that there was a scorchbeast flying close to them. I decided to attack the scorchbeast and lure it to the c.a.m.p. It ended up destroying their c.a.m.p. and killing two out of four. Looted their scrap and left them with the scorchbeast.
---
Mine, too.  But it presses my OCD button that I can't delete it.
---
So your thought process is that you're going to be inconsiderate to 20 other people each time you play the game because one person on reddit was a little curt with someone who wasn't even you?
---
Other online games like ark or rust
---
Personally if they implement that I think it should be an option. I like to camp different areas, part of the fun in a new alt is finding somewhere new to put a camp to me.
---
Added a note. It would be on ps4
---
What kind of stupid fight designer would make an enemy that has absolutely no counter to someone who just *finds a building*, sits inside, and takes cheap shots for 15 minutes to win? The gas is to force you to be mobile and smart, one OP piece of cover isn't good enough, you need to keep moving. The gas gets laid down in a line and you can quite easily *step aside* to leave its area of effect.
---
Yes not to mention those are the points of the game mechanics
---
Better safe than sorry. The description actually reads that it prevents new mutations, so no sense taking the chance unless you are trying it with the perk on deliberately for science and don’t mind if it fails and you waste a serum.
---
saw them for sale in the enclave bunker for 22k. no perks, 6 charisma.
---
Yeah endgame is like killing the queen and doing nuke silos, I solo'd silos at lvl 50 w/o legendaries
---
I think there was a spell or weapon perk in Skyrim that grounded dragons so you could charge them.  Is there something like that for scorch beasts?
---
Yea game definitely feels like whole endgame was cut out to meet release date. I mean one f#cking boring monster and even that fails to work properly, but even if it did work solid, it would still be boring af. Last one we did, died in less thatn 3 minutes, whan an joke. Normal dungeon in ESO last even longer. Hopefully Vaults actually bring challenge and real endgame to game.
---
I remember arguing about nukes in PCG, where one told "Why would you nuke someones camp, when nukes are hard to come and nuke zones produce valuable resources?"...and here we are, basically can solo launch nuke every 20 minutes and flux aint really that rare.
---
I’m just thinking that they hear enough complaining so they don’t respond to it. 
---
The Lamenters would have physically shielded him with their own bodies before dying to a man. 
---
You can easily avoid people who would "nuke" , even though such a scenario has never happened to me and i play almost daily since the beta.Other than that , it's a Fallout game with a twist, you can explore, build, craft, do stories, while also finding friends with whom you can do activities. Fantastic game, has some bugs and lots of haters.
---
no it doesnt effect the muataion serums ive taken 3 serums and they havent been effected by starched genes
---
Simple, just play.
---
I say it like that because I too dont really have any friends to play with on the game. Just my brother, and we have to plan a head for the weekend to get some game time.
---
You dont have to go terminal to terminal, but that does happen a lot. I just find myself wandering around and sometimes you happen upon a daily event  you can partake in.  I think this is about half my game time right there.  There have been a couple of times I've found myself part of a temporary team involved in clearing a nuke blast site, that was fun.  But the moment we were done, two of the people left, and the remaining tried to kill me for my loot.
---
It's difficult for me to stay with MMOs, even ones like FO76, because I can't dedicate the time to constantly play it ALL the time.  I might get an hour or two a week and maybe three hours on the weekend.
---
Enjoy the game for what it is.  A new Fallout, with a different play style and the chance to interact with other players (if you so choose).
---
One con that I would point out, weight!  Granted I run around in T-51 armour (frame only), I have been over-encumbered for the majority of my game time.  Even ditching that, holding on to five weapons, ONE set of armour and your usual stash of meds and junk, I have to walk everywhere.  I've only fast travelled a couple of times.
---
Wed-nes-day.  You expect me to believe that's a thing?
---
The day you get a Nintendo Entertainment System or something?
---
That is what I’m afraid would happen. I would get everything prepped. Have my guys hide stuff through whitesprings and then nobody would show up. Then I’m having to run back around and pick everything up. 
---
The people criticizing the direction or the choice to make it a multi game rather than a single player experience with or without MP support, are basically attacking the orange for not being an apple. It was well and clear to me that this game was not a standard fallout experience. Its also pretty naive to expect perfect, or even good releases, across the board, in modern gaming 2019
---
i always leave the stuff i don't want in the cash registers near the vendor bot, except  at whitespring station i leave stuff in the icebox out front since he doesn't have a cash register.
---
Yep, not everyone needs to act nice and friendly. Saw some guys trading at a c.a.m.p. and I thought that they were dupers but they didn't drop bags.
---
There also was a scorchbeast flying close to them so I decided to lure it to their c.a.m.p. It ended up destroying their half of their c.a.m.p. and killing two out of four. Looted their junk and left them with the scorchbeast.
---
I’m not sure which perk they fall under. I’ve seen proof of them tamed but I’m not sure what they used.
---
Someone else already did

Cool, I know people I've met would find this really fun. I'd be interested
---
Pretty sure recipes for the serums exist 
---
Its a joke
---
I too noticed this.  hilarious :)
---
The queen drops the recipies and the recipies also spawn rarely on the Enclave vendor. I got Healing Factor recipie from the queen the other day.
---
He is talking abou the plans you learn to create thing inside your camp. For example I should not have to find the “Barn building set” plan for every alt character I create. Once I find it once it should be shared across my account 
---
Don't know how complete it is but they pictures are helpful: 
---

---
Great job!  i like how you used the roll up doors.  i have yet to implement them into a build because i cant get it to look right.  that looks great 
---
And I can solo kill the queen and run nuke silos in around 10 minutes solo because I do have legendaries
---
That one is just a mat. It don’t allow you to fast travel to it. I tried lol 
---
That is why I loved the infinite carry weight glitch. I could collect stuff without worrying about being overencumbered. I know it lowers the server stability, but it made the game much more fun, and if Bethesda didn't want me to do it they can make private servers.
---
That's fair. The disconnect issue is super crappy. However. I love the workshops for the reason of free extra missions, like the claim/clear out missions and the defense missions (XP) and cheaper travel around the map. My work around any issues have been doing power plant missions first when I load in and then you don't have to build as much at a number of workshops. For example, the Steel Mill has two steel resource pumps already built, and if you power up Poseidon, you only have to build connectors to get them operational. 
---
Annoying nonetheless. I wish you the best out there!
---
Dunno why you got downvoted. Same here. So bad infact that I've refrained from looking at the Stored tab too much
---
Typo in there, ofc I mean 1000+ cap a day total from vendors.
---
Office Space, right?
---
another settlement is in trouble and needs your help.... god no lol
---
Only stupid people are breeding....
---
I have to say you guys have some fantastic ideas. This popped up on my feed and just wanted to give an upvote. I couldnt keep playing fo76, the nuke grind was pointless imo and not fun. This game has amazing potential and I hope Bethes realizes this sub has so many great ideas.
---
Next issue of “Inside the Vault” in a few hours. We will see.  
---
If it's just a freeze without a crash try alt tabbing in and out. The rate freezes I get were fixed with this.
---
I have started equipping a Hazmat suit while crafting at WS, as that seems to be when I get DC'd a lot, I have also had the game load me back in there without my PA, even though I was in it when the game crashed, 
---
Jumping into PA doesn't always save you since most of the time the Torso &amp; Right Leg becomes Un-equipped every time you get in.
---
Same I'm at work but should be off soon😓
---
Don’t you know? Everyone with a TSE is a ‘cheater’.  At least, that’s what a lot of people think. 
---
I bought mine and get told all the time I’ve ‘paid to win’. 
---
I’m level 109 and I think I’ve played to win. I was a trader before dupe-gate (out of business now because of them sadly) and I earned my caps fairly. How I chose to spend them doesn’t make me less of a player. 
---
Anyway, rant over. 
---
TLDR: some people think those who use TSE Weapons are cheaters and dupers. 
---
It has not been over a month, there were two weeks when every human being was on holidays with their families. Just be patient and good things will come to you.
---
I can certainly try to scavenge and repair some for ya in a few hours if nobody else jumps on this. Any sort of level requirements you need?
---
Talons for unarmed. 
---
or crafted it?
---
i that would suck i still don't have the spear plan.
---
Hunting rifles/snipers feel like garbage.
---
I don't have a mouse.
---
I'm struggling to find the part of my post that said it should be prioritized over bug fixes or other problems, can you help me out?
---
Converted munitions factory ftw! BEST. WORKSHOP. EVER.
---
As opposed to having party members spawning in a foundation.
---
The Imperial Fists wouldn’t. Not because they have a large concern for civilian life but because meat is an inferior fortification material. 
---
Yup! This is what I was going for. Thanks for clarifying. 
---
I know, getting all the springs, screws, and gears are killing me
---
Grouse grind, Vancouver b.c 
---
Really clean build, loving the double garage doors, hadn't thought to use two of them like that before.
---
It could just be an electronic device that messes with them and forces them to land.
---
Clearly you've never played D2 enemies. Every single one of them save one or two just piss me off lol.
---
Oh, come on, I'm sure that guy was _completely_ legit.
---
/s
---
I Close their eyes for them
---
Hi welcome to reddit where people weigh in without understanding what a regression suite is.
---
Now I want to go check every percolator in the game.
---
nah man, I meant something that'll follow me around.
---
preferably small and cute.
---
Urgh sorry forgot same type armor can be different levels. I am lvl 47.
---
That would be great thank you so much, repairs I can do I just need the pieces to get started
---
This.  
---
But on the upside, due to server lag it's often possible to put on a hazmat suit and spam rad away, before you're dead.
---
...and maybe fill up all the ditches too?
---
But this is Fallout.
---
should say: "NO NORMIES, NO RADX"
---
People who are capable of taking out wings aren't necessarily the ones complaining they can't land.  Yes I can target wings with 10% accuracy on my low health bloodied melee build, however, that's now exactly fun lol.   I'd prefer not to have to use a gun at all on my melee character honestly xD.  I'm not personally too upset about scorch beasts, I lived through Cliff racers in Morrowind :P but I'm just saying.   
---
They stack too so talons and twisted muscles for unnarmed is good
---
My favorite is when they die while flying, and then ragdoll off somewhere in the distance where **you never find their body**. So much spending all this time and ammo killing something as annoying as that only to be deprived of loot because you can't find the body.
---
Well, if the gun wasn't explosive it would make sense to not damage yourself. But it is explosive, and explosions have splash damage. Now, there should be a perk to reduce self explosive damage, like CoD, but there is not.
---
i mean its probably less about reddit and more about they saw that no one was buying it so they dropped the price
---
Ummm drysuits ?
---
so much "assholery" around in this forum.
---
Yea, almost what you had said, but I get your point. Stupid technicalities, wording, fine print, and nothing worth going back and forth about.. We are on the same side
---
You are right, they have more important things going on. 
---
I really don’t get everyones problem with the stashlimit. Sure from time to time you have to go through your stuff and sell unnecessary stuff but that’s part of survival. Wouldn’t it be boring if you were able to hoard all of the junk you pick up whether you need it or not? This way you think twice about picking stuff up you don’t really need
---
Are you on PC? I can take you through a Nuke bunker if you want!
---
I remember having about 45 missiles at launch due to beta playing and I gave them to a new player as they left 76 and they probably thought it was a blessing, but it was in actuality, a curse
---
Mainly to be read and make the readers comment what they think about the topic(s). Your comparison was quite funny. I like it.
---
Welp, glad I saved the caps then. I thought long and hard about spend the 192c though, lol.
---
OK, sure. But there aren't any loot boxes to purchase right now; and I haven't seen any evidence from coding that there is an inactive system in place to allow for loot boxes in FO76. 
---
Generally, running to an open area is the best way to get them to land. 
---
You are right, still amazes me how New Vegas is up there as the best...i guess the modder's have something to do with it. It was probably the most broken game id ever played at the time, as your save file got bigger and bigger the game stability got worse and worse....exactly the same as Skyrim at launch.Picked New Vegas up on a humble on steam a while back but never got round to playing it again. 
---
I've found sometimes Nostalgia gets the best of me and ruins perfectly good child hood memories.
---
War: war never changes....same could be said for Bethesda then i guess. Hopefully in a few years then FO76 wont be as buggy as it is and Bethesda might actually stop hiding there head in the sand.
---
I'd have more respect for Bethesda and Todd if they just came out acknowledged the issues and said its going to take sometime to fix. Ignoring customers is never the answer imo.

This almost sounds like some body Stealth Boy aggro'd you. The Wendigo is usually just out of range over to the right looking out of the door toward Lewisburg. The Super Mutants do patrol but also are generally not close enough to detect you.

I have rolled in there quite a few times and never experienced a mob inside ... unless someone drew them in.

Wonderful story.  Wish we had pics!!
---
Isn't that the point? I don't do a lot with my camp, but I see plenty of decorative items in the atom store. It makes sense to me. Decorative items are not required for gameplay nor do they offer an advantage so they're perfect candidates for microtransactions.
---
Good fellow dweller with decent stuff to offer!
---
Thanks, again!!
---
Or Prime Railroad receivers! Don't forget those tasty treats!
---
Me and my friend had 3 of them attack us at the same time...we were level 9 at the time -_-
---
The scorchbeast also has a bug where it will just sonic attack over and over with no break, which makes it impossible to retaliate due to not being able to see or aim becausenof the screenshake.
---
Really tried to have patients but this coupled with the terrible servers; im going back to fallout 4.
---
Been saying this since first few days of BETA.
---
I miss shit like Metal Gear Solid, where the bosses were puzzles to be figured out, you inevitably died multiple times before figuring it out. The sense of accomplishment from beating them was worth way more than a single scorchbeast heart and some bones after you dump 400+ bullets and 30 musket balls into it.

firemen are unspooling hose and connecting to a hydrant to put out a massive blaze across the street.

you come up and say "you guys really should change the color of your trucks to yellow since its more visible."

maybe wait till the fires out before suggesting trivial stuff since no one is going to notice or care about it till the smoke clears
---
Good a reason as OP being shitty because other people are interfering with the game they want to play. 
---
I think I’ll go build a camp there myself now.  With rocket turrets and hookers and blackjack. 
---
Oh okay I understand it I get around 800 caps daily because I don’t have a lot to sell

Clearly OP is the commie and the camp turreters are late stage capitalists ruining the legendary economy for the rest of us...
---
Sooooo... In that case...

Also make another collab and add them to Monster Hunter World. Not enough collabs /s and they would fit nicely.
---
Their armor would be a T-51 and it would be AWESOME.
---
The palico armor would be Vault Boy. The Pip-boy would be... a kinsect maybe?

The could gather data while beeing on holidays, its a fucking computer game.

It literally should take them 2 hours to see if servers were bad or not after the stash increase.

And no, my patience is limited, good games are on the horizon

The Emperor protects. 
---
Ha
---
&gt;there were two weeks when every human being was on holidays with their families.
---
considering the mess, they shouldn't be allowed out until it's fixed.
---
I think the bos underarmor is slightly better. But that's just me.
---
Indeed, but 40 shotguns is not 4000 of them.
---
Am I right?  :) 
---
I can gladly do repairs myself for you, it’s not like it’s that expensive. 
---
On the other hand I can get a set of Level 40 arms for you then later give you Level 50 ones free of charge when you hit 50, or I can just get you Level 50 arms instead. Which would you prefer?
---
Demolition expert + that card + explosive rounds = constantly rolling natural 1s
---
pair that with carnivore and you have a working system.
---
Out of what? Yeah, the beginning phrase was too much. 
---
I do need a bathroom sink and why the hell would I build a busted up toilet? 
---
I use the chemistry station (L shaped one) as a kitchen sink and counter, looks pretty good next to cooking stove and milk machine (makeshift fridge)
---
Once again guys with PCs can do things that guys with consoles can't, obviously this player has way more processing power than you do.
---
You can craft them
---
You're a mean one Mr. Grinch
---
This would help out an incredible amount!  
---
You're not using the right shout to make them land.  
---
After helping out low level players since the beginning karma came around. As I’m dropping some corn soup and purified water for a level 9, a level 94 in Power Armor appears. (Probably his buddy) he gives me the thumbs up and drops a 2 shot explosive handmade rifle. I don’t have demolition expert maxed yet, but it still does 325 damage plus the explosive effect. Thanks random dude......
---
&gt;that’s part of surviva
---
and that where youre wrong kiddo.  
---
Every human in existence with a brain would stash EVERYTHING at least a bit valuable or decraftable until whole caves would be stuffed, because you "might" need it. Imagine dying because you are sick 2 years after the apocalypse and you die because you dont have enough gazoline hoarded since you thought "aaah, i can get more later maybe"  
---
Its a fucking hoarder game that promotes hoarding, but wont let you.
---
Yeah no, maybe like 1-12 ige killed at least 12 this week and have seen 1 plan.  Others say similar things when I've looked around on here.
---
It might we'll be they are supposed to only be 1-4 but that's not the drop rate from anecdote.
---
Cats is still wildly inaccurate on scorchbeasts due to how much they fly back and forth and bob up and down. Concentrated fire helps, but by the time you're acctually landing shots you're out of AP. Obviously though specific legendary combos would make this much easier
---
&gt; good games are on the horizon
---
Do us a favor and go play them
---
I got mine last night from Monongah. (Think that's the spelling) First time. I will likely repeat it again tonight for easy xp. And it close to home. If i happen to get a repeat, ill send it your way.
---
You cant bind anything above mw3 in the options. I've got the Logitech mouse with about 50 buttons on it.I assigned them differently with the Logitech software.
---
Its for the excavator armor
---
Yeah well melee characters in a world that has buttloads of guns are stupid, and you’re part of the problem.^(40% serious post)
---
You son of a... I had just gotten that out of my head!
---
Wow, finally logged in to a session where they weren't all looted. And oh my god the sight of plastic boxes filled with clipboards warmed my hearth so much!
---
That’s one of the reasons I want the t60 it’s cheap to repair I have raider now and I need like 20 springs I think to repair it- crazy
---
I don’t know what to do as I am 3 away from 50 if it’s not a hassle to get 40’s then 50’s that would probably work best. 
---
Your too kind thank you 
---
actually, that happens at real companies. If they have some real bad issues with a product there is no holidays until it's fixed.  
---
maybe christmas itself and new years or so. Better payment though on the usual days.  
---
Is the shag flooring from the atom shop?
---
You say you aren’t using mods but are you using Fallout76Custom.ini for anything? 
---
I was in the same boat, no mods, custom ini for some settings, my floors wouldn’t show up and I’d crash in the build menu. Adding this line helped me, it may help you:  https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3v4xz/_/eb9ejpe/?context=1
---
There needs to be a feature to assign quests to people!!!!
---
Considering what you wrote, you shouldn't be allowed to post.
---
I only just got the wetsuit plans. Can you scrap them repeatedly to learn upgrades for them, or do you have to get pre-made mods or what?
---
That wouldn't kill me, bird bones + 50% reduced fall damage from legendaries. I fling myself off cliffs all the time. 
---
Going into anyone's stupid floating camp is never a good idea. 
---
lol ouch
---
I was with you until the last sentence.
---
I feel the main focus of the game was designed very little by the developers, mainly because they were **developing** it. 
---
I'd focus your emotions on the story writers, managers, etc
---
If the only way to "Fix" the issue for some is to delete the purifiers for everyone then ... please do so. I'll gladly rebuild my purifier if it allows everyone to use theirs.
---
I know, I'm probably in the numerical minority ... 
---
Gotta stop trying to make a distinction between cosmetic and gameplay MTX. It's all shit.
---
The only content FO76 has is exploration since of all the problems they got one thing right but thats really it. FO76 end game is literally all grind. Once you hit level 50 the only thing left to do is grind legendaries. Very specific legendaries "2 shot" "explosive shot" etc. And pretty much the only way to do that is to nuke and grind whitesprings. All the other end game "bosses" have such a bad drop rate its not worth doing at all. PvP is completely broken so thats out of the picture, its almost not even worth them putting it in the game.
---
While GTAO theres alot of ways to make money and have fun doing so and ALOT more to do missions, races, mini games, pvp etc. Being able to have buisnesses and upgrading them gives you a sense of achievement and moving up in the world whereas FO76 really has none of that.  
---
I agree, finding plans and recipes is part of the fun for me. 
---
Same for me. Especially the nuclear plants, the rate at which fusion cores generate has got to be bugged. 
---
Which is a real shame because I **like** the idea of owning a workshop. I **Want** to build a bunch of stuff there and make it look cool. But I can't because I crash and disconnect entirely too often. It's not even worth building on all the resource nodes much less building a cool looking workshop. 
---
Bethesda, let me enjoy this content.
---
I have only had a handful of CTDs, no BSODs, but LOTS of complete lockups while playing. Anytime I move too fast before the game has a chance to register something, it completely locks up the entire computer. My main monitor goes down while my other 2 (on a diff card) will remain but motionless. No taskman access at all. Sound will keep playing. I can't figure it out. I kill all non-essential programs. 
---
Well then it ain’t real jerky!
---
Not sure if you gave it a fair shake at level 5. Rather than holding your hand and guiding you thru a narrated/animated story fallout76 literally throws you out to the wolves with in the first ten minutes of gameplay. With very little guidence you should take a similar path as most noobs to the first few quest markers. I suggest wandering/exploring while questing. In fallout its not about walking a straight line from destination to destination. Its more about the curves and squiggles we take toward the objective. Just play however you feel like playing. Im level 115+ and I havent finished most of the story lines. Never launched a nuke. Only killed one scorched beast queen. I only have one set of PA. Theres a lot more content left and Ive had soo much fun so far.
---
One of the best locations yet when I first found that place.  I think me and my sons we're all around lvl 20 and it was chaos.  We had no idea what we were in for.  
---
Aka'Magosh
---
Honestly? I have an awful feeling it's because then they can release it at a later date and claim it's brand spanking new content rather than something that probably could have been in there to begin with.
---
I get a feeling like that from the whole game - like things have almost been deliberately left out so they can be included as DLC. I could be completely wrong, of course!
---
I removed all mods and the ini file to test, relogged in, confirmed mods were off.
---
I also already had that line in place as I had done a reinstall in December, after the patch. Thanks though, good looking out.
---
 You cant fight something when your blind. I honestly hate them more than disconnects. 
---
make this material a requirement for repairing any legendary and we have a deal.
---
If you put the item on your favorites wheel, it gives it a hotkey.  You can then set up your mouse or whatever to send that key.  
---
turrets take 10% of budjet \_each\_  
---
but i cannot leave my camp with no turrets. I've scrapped 3/6 that I had, and I'm afraid I have to scrap 1 or 2 more to get everything to fit the budjet : P
---
My reactive excavator armor also seems to be silent.  
---
Um, yea. It's almost like they are 30 units stronger for some unknown reason.................
---
No matter the level they are not difficult. The point is they are annoying and an overall waste of resources and time.
---
Pistols are by definition a low power (non ballistic) weapon, so power and perk tree would always be somewhat limited as to more of  a sidearm...
---
yeah I started a pistol build and eventually moved to rifles because I was tickling enemies late game. 
---
Unless you find a TSE pistol they are just too underwhelming. 
---
You should be able to turn down depth of field under display settings, they added it a while back. 
---
"No normies" lol
---
Cash register dropper here. Everyone has them aside from Whitespring station and I don't really bother with him since I go to the Enclave first.
---
This! Our group of mutated 200+ levels just hang and find people to help. We farm good weapons/armor/mutation serums and help others. Every so often we do a bloodthirsty pvp, but only within those of our group that choose to participate. Hoping for factions, though! 
---
I have mine around halfway, I don't actually mind the blur.

Change "We need" to "I want."

It only make things worse for everyone else and you don’t get much in return. It’s only a game, why do this?

https://discord.gg/6htBzdh - its a good crowd, trading, LFG etc. 
---
Not true, maybe not as much loot but I still got legendries. Don't believe me? Try it yourself.
---
A sawed off double barrel shotgun in a leg holster is completely Fallout!
---
I agree.
---
I'm only level 19, and I was doing a quest at the mine, and one came out of nowhere and killed me.
---
What’s the point of wearing under armor?
---
I never played a Fallout game but i wanted a real open world shooter with progression. I have found it with this game. The world is huge and there is something to always do. I entered a Nuke Zone yesterday for the first time at level 37 and it was a blast. I was running for my life, helping kill level 68 glows and got some sweet level 50 items for use later.
---
I killed a level 30 scorched but hit somones camp by accident and was hunted for about 2 miles before the guy at level 108 got me. I was just having fun watching this guy trying to get me with everything he had. I just found the last 2 pcs. of T51 armor i needed for my power armor and i am wrecking shit now. Finding mats for crafting ammo is my ndgame right now and getting my power armor station will be my next endgame followed buy getting mats to repair my power armor. I hate survival games but they have took the best parts and toned down the worst that is eating and drinking.
---
I was trying to refund the 2 copys i purchased but i'm happy i didn't
---
I'm pretty sure they are tweaking things like spawn rates server side without even patching the client. Don't know if the code allows for that, but I often farmed the Grafton monster at Hemlock holes for acid, and recently it spawns not even half as often. And there was no patch the last days. Same I think is true for other enemies.  (I have no empirical data, though. Just a feeling)
---
5/7 would nut.
---
Yeah, I had a radio during beta.  Then it was just... missing.  
---
I’m server hopping at the Welch Station for the t-51b calibrated shocks (a real pain), and occasionally I’ve seen the medic pump there, also at Watoga vendors as others said
---
I tried to be social yesterday and talked to everyone I met.  The one person who was kind of fun to talk to was the one who replied with emotes so it was like, 1/14 people for me.  Then again... maybe I'm the boring one?
---
Not a noob, but I created an alt to be able to purchase handmade rifle plans. When rolling into Flatwoods I found 7 level 45 TSE handmade rifles in a random toolbox, go figure. Probably dupe’d items, no other explanation. 
---
I want to say I dropped them so they would disappear forever. While that would be the right thing to do I can’t lie and say that was the choice I made. Took them all, sold them all to Whitesprings vendors later on across several different servers. It sucks that these items were the result of an exploit, but maybe it made some people’s day to buy them for cheap there.
---
Otherwise, I have not found anything particularly wild around that area left by higher level players.
---
Is that inside of part of a the bridge?
---
10/10 would come over if on Xbox 
---
scorched or SM shooting it - saw this all the time when I lived in the forest except for me it was the idiots shooting the tops of corn.
---
Well the trailer where you find the tin foil hat does have a lot of drawings about aliens lol.
---
What? I have a normal camp there with about 2 turrets, just because I liked how the grass looked. Im not trying to take anyone's loot... please dont destroy it
---
Ooooook, buddy. 
---
happens to me all the time...especially, ESPECIALLY after i dropped a fusion generator on it....GAH!
---
craft and scrap spam worked on the vault suit, i assume it would work on the others
---
The firebreathers one? Oh man, that one enraged me. I took a break from the game for a few hours after trying fruitlessly to outrun it
---
Hi, they added about 20-30 since launch. You can find them in the atomic shop :)
---
Clever!
---
horizon, not there yet. But no im not playing this shitfest.  
---
i wasnt just surprised they STILL didnt manage to at least improve it.
---
Why have a turret?
---
I would like this too. It doesnt have to be hugely complicated either. 
---
Like If I wear combat armour, it would be nice to choose the basic colour.
---
You can keep the fancier designs (flames etc) for the atom shop
---
Bump 👍
---
Generally, The muties give more XP then scorched or bots.
---
Grafton, the anglers are fugly but great xp if you can survive.
---
This is really helpful thank you. This is actually my second character since there was no saving my first character. I also didn't know you could put a point in one tree and get a perk from another. Probably why my first character was so bad.
---

Basically it.

Crits + automatic weapons. Those are also just the perks that matter to my build everything else can be W/E you want as it still works.

8 int for crafting basically so I can load out all my crafting at once and I switch between gunsmith and the pip gun variant depending on the weapon I am using for reduced weapon degradation."

I posted this in another thread when someone asked me about my auto pistol build that can stealth kill scorch beast without being seen and no legendary guns. 
---
I do have AP refresh armor and chameleon modded properly. Night time is also your friend.

Extraordinarily frustrating to spend a day grinding to have the mod not work. Should have learned from the previous two. 
---
It's built into an existing monorail structure near Watoga. Feel free to join whenever you see me online, probably won't be on for long if at all tonight though 
---
I've encountered some explosive players who waited for melees like me get mobbed by ghouls and just 1-shot the group around me (at least they do pacifist). Since (super sledge) swings doesn't seem to be affecting more than one enemy, it is quite a letdown when a legendary nametag pops up in the crowd and not be able to tag them with a swing before they get TSE-d. (Btw, getting mobbed is not a problem for me at WS because the bloated ones usually prevent each other to get close at once so I happily keep swinging.)
---
All the more reason to save time on getting the items you need by Server hopping. 
---
Cool thanks!
---
yeah it pissed me off too.
---
I usually used herbivore, and filled my camp with plants so that I could store them until they spoiled.
---
Scorchbeast reinforced Compound Bow
---
They give extra damage, radiation and energy protection and also a perk like intellegence or perception buff...
---
Oh hey it's Lesser Dog from Undertale.

There is no “best” under armor. Every type has a different bonus so it really depends on your needs. 
---
Marine wetsuit:
---
Bonus: 2 STR / 1 PER / 2 END
---
BOS :
---
Bonus: 2 STR / 3 END
---
Enclave urban/forest operative:

Vault Tec Jumpsuit:

Bonus: 1 STR / 2 END / 2 INT / 2 LCK

Why do you want to make Liberty Prime cry?
---
I don't remember crafting/scrapping the vault suit. I just remember realizing it was upgradable at one point.
---
Alright then, that settles it. Give me some time to gather the arms after scavenging around for them and repair them then I’ll message you as soon as I can when they’re done.
---
Always glad to help. :)
---
That sounds related, but why doesn't it work with all mods removed?
---
She about to get the glowing meat!
---
That makes sense. I didn't play previous Fallouts, but if most hardcore fans knew the release build quality may not be great, the release wasn't as bad as I imagined.
---
There are several different types of underarmor:  Marine, Brotherhood, Enclave, Raider, Casual, Vault
---
There's 4 different types of protective buffs for underarmor.  Treated, Resistant, Protected, and Shielded.  Each one gives more stats.  Some have more endurance, more strength, more perception, etc.
---
I believe I have one but not sure need to check later
---
Its a set of mats, they say Welcome, whats not to love.
---
I de ided to just farm all of the mutations. I'm a super mutant and it plays pretty good. Insane int and lots of special powers. I think the downside is about -2 str,  it in a group it's like +30 points across the board with lvl3 class freak.
---
I don't feel like playing counter strike.   Welcome to the grim dark of Warhammer 40k.  There is only war.   My thunderhammer shall Purge the unclean and your tech-heresy.  (70% serious post)
---
Bigger stash is definitely my #1 request.  Loving the game right now except for that.
---
If they're having problems with database recall times / lag, they can always do this:
---
All Junk, Ammo, and Aid (without condition bars) is unlimited. It doesn't take any more time for a database to recall 10 steel as it does 1,000 steel. It's a line item name and a numerical value.
---
Since there are so many variants and conditions of armor and weapons and food items (literally millions if you take all the variables in), make that a FIXED number of slots in your stash (as many as they can get in there without lag).  So you could store 100 armor or weapons or food items.
---
If it's a database retrieval problem, that would fix it :)
---
I love your idea. PC player but I would like to help you plan this a bit. 
---
Paper bags have a life time of about 15 minutes. Items inserted into containers can last well over an hour. So your hunt might be better suited to store them in containers (maybe trashcan's inside Whitespring so someone doesn't rain on the event with a Nuke).
---
Alternate location could be Flatwoods for lower level players and the accessibility of numerous containers.
---
Doing this event inside Whitespring would also allow for you and your friends to set it up across multiple servers (server limit is 24 people) to accommodate a larger showing if necessary.
---
Just a few thoughts off the top of my head.
---
I can also confirm.
---
That's what drives me nuts. For years they've had modders fixing their shit and they can't incorporate those fixes?
---
The code is right there, free, at worst you could simply give the modder a thank you in the credits.
---
But no, let's just use the same buggy coding for years on end. 
---
I finally got 3 ranks of this in 76 (loved it in Fallout 4) and so far it looks nerfed. In 4 it sent enemies *flying*. In 76 it just... staggers and does damage. Still useful but less fun... I can’t knock people off edges anymore. This is non-PVP btw, haven’t tried it in PVP yet.
---
What system? Ps4? I have a 2 shot .44 if you want it.
---
I’ve found that while you can’t hide in buildings, you can effectively hide behind trees. It also stops the infinite sonic blast loop as the SB repositions itself. Give it a shot. 
---
You sort of picked the literally worst day to share your ignorance on their lack of improving the game with this subreddit, but hey, you do you.
---
Exactly!!! Simple basic colors. I wouldnt be opposed to paying 500 atoms for a pallet of 10 BASIC colors if it had to come down to it. Nothing fancy that needs to be excessively overpriced or priced like an exclusive though.
---
They're in the ESM, but they're also marked POST so it's likely they'll be introduced as part of some raider events in the future. 
---
Ffs for some enough will never be enough - _- 400 was OK, 600 is fine as well, you don't need fucking 156 steel stacks, learn ti manage your shit! 
---
And your obviously worthless for help so we both know something now blow
---
i found a plan after reading that "all underarmors guide" post and spammed it cause i wanted the bonus stats
---
Welp time to move
---
Ok, so give me a pallet of 10 basic colors, ill pay 500 atoms gladly
---
Some of those folks are leaving and coming to reset spawns I'm sure. I was in a team with a guy that would leave after we made a round of killing everything and when he came back we started over at the clubhouse, rinse and repeat.
---
I'd say on average I freeze about 1 time for every 3 or 4 hours worth of playtime. Framerate drops on the other hand...

Glorious, thank you for this
---
There’s a favorite wheel KEY on PC, F
---
just go into your inventory select q as favorite 
---
Then f to bring up the wheel and assign a numeric key
---
Normally, yes I prefer as much shared between characters as possible.  In this particular game, there's only one thing about your character that isn't easy to change which is SPECIAL allocation.  Everything else is so easy I don't see the need to have an alt at all aside from a storage alt.
---
I just don't see the need for it.  Not that it'd be a bad thing at all.
---
I'm saying your regression suite could be as robust as any out there it still won't stop all the bugs in a game like this.    
---
So far not a single online game of this (or any nature) has had a regression suite robust enough to prevent unforeseen bugs that I've heard about.  Let me know if you find an example.
---
Huh, didn't even know you could do that. Thanks!
---
That is what I'm hoping, that this game improves with time. Nothing more.
---
Last I checked servers don't support cross-platform play so this had to be some one on a ps4.

You can add me names Walking_Contra and happy with the camp atm but want to move around and that damn plan is the only thing holding me back lol
---
You talk like a gaping asshole.
---
They didn’t say it was right, they just gave a logical fucking explanation.
---
I have no idea! It seems like there are a few similar things that can cause this problem but the fix isn’t the same for any of them. 
---
Thank you very much my Psn is Walking _Contra appreciate it!
---
On Xbox, I leave stuff in Newspaper Machines all over the Wasteland
---
I like building my camps on mountains.  Turns out, the mountain range to the west of Whitesprings had super mutants...
---
There’s an unpickable Nuka truck on Whitespring station as well
---
Mining away I don’t know what to say I’ll say it any way... 
---
I'm sorry that you think this has anything to do with "moral highground". I simply see that we don't agree, we never will, and I'm saving us both the time and effort of being consumed in an endless circlejerk. 
---
did you use railway spikes or bird bones glitch to get there?
---
Moist suits?
---
The problem is almost all the assets were flipped from Fallout 4 and Skyrim, and it’s so painfully obvious. On top of using the same outdated engine which is why there are so many glitches, bugs, and god-awful lag. As much as I wanted to like this game I don’t like how lazy this is. Like I get reusing and remaking a few things but when almost the entire game is a big asset flip, that’s just... yeah, not cool Bethesda. 
---
No capes!!!
---
you know all DLC is going to be free, right?
---
Has this been updated? Also, when I save it on my Google Drive the check boxes go away and become "true" or "false". 
---
Same.  I've killed at least 30 and gotten one plan:  for explosive vents.  Which don't work right.
---
5mm... High caliber? Isn't that something like .20 caliber? Like, smaller than a .22?
---
And drivable cars and bikes get rid of fast travle unless it's for going to a event
---
I see this all the time, never noticed it being a specific time of day though as it's just a Bethesda game thing, usually fixed by the loving community, but now in the hands of some very likely exasperated devs trying like hell to find the root of problems they never had to look for before.
---
On PC, they can detect people using Cheat Engine to modify their carry weight and do other things. There are reports where people get their account closed/banned.
---
Almost 4k upvotes and no bethesda reply... hmmmm
---
Just scrapping and building a new one doesn’t work. Moving it away from a wall or any other object is the logical solution allowing the game mechanics to place you behind the power armor when building/repairing. This is true for any crafting station. I couldn’t use my Chemistry station at first because my power armor station was too close to the front of it. 
---
Love the gas station sign over the wall decor and the angled ceiling in your pool room. Also like how the deck uses the triangle wall pieces to close it in a little while leaving it open. The camp as a whole is just well very well shaped. The mixed level roof you see in the first picture for example, just gives the outside of the house of lot of extra texture. I can never get my camps shaped to look like real houses, you did you a really good job here.
---
That is rather annoying both the mobs spawning late after doing damage and random damage. 
---
45 seconds straight of sonic attacks is a bit ridiculous. I like this idea.
---
Your best bet is starting your mutations palette yourself up to a few mutations(avoiding any you don't want) and filling in the gaps with serums so it can be closest to perfect
---
Stupid sexy ghouls.
---
Nope
---
It's also possible if you have a gaming mouse with a macro's than you can just change the settings on your mouse to match the hotkeys.
---
yeah, but i only have 2, a heavy shotgun turret (to keep the mole rats away) and a laser turret, i also have 2 sweeping lights for the laser turret...
---
To bad if i need to store everything to try and make it reste, i am sure it's the missing ghost turrets that is doing this.
---
Have nothing in my "stored" tab, i always check after the earlier dup bugs..

These are a few of my thoughts. Personally I think Lone Wanderer is a must have card in Charisma. I also think White Knight isn't necessary except for repairing, because it lowers the cost so much it doesn't matter how slow or fast it breaks and is a waste to run it, except for when repairing. Evasive would be better, but then you would want to get max agility to take full advantage of it. Class Freak isn't necessary unless you want specific mutations that have bad downsides. So that's something I would try to cut out. And in theory Starched Genes isn't necessary to run all the time, except when taking Rad-Away. But you can forget to equip it and lose mutations that way, or get unwanted mutations if you're not careful. Probably a good idea to run it sometimes in high radiation zones but not necessary a lot of the time. Makeshift Warrior is also not necessary most of the time, as it's just resources to repair and those are fairly easy to come by. You can spend those points better elsewhere. 
---
Love this idea! Unfortunately I work every other Friday and no time zone was mentioned so am gonny have to pass. 
---
Good luck with this and perhaps some updates?
---
I imagine they can never satisfy you.  You are a nightmare customer.
---
I used 5 mini nukes 3 missiles and 2 fusion cores for a wing fragment
---
I love giving my extra plans to other players. I gave an artillery plan to a level 14, and he was screaming with glee. Or the level 31 who followed me around for 5 minutes throwing thumbs ups and heart emojis after giving him a handmade plan.  Most time I get a thumbs up, or heart emoji and that's pretty nice. Some people want the experience of not being handed things like weapons/armor/ammo/healing/food/water, but they'll still usually take your extra copies of plans. 
---
Careful guys, these sound like complaints... people round these parts don’t like complaining 
---
You should try to find it yourself, removes the fun of the game...
---
the only SB fights that are remotely interesting are when you can lure them into the SAM batteries on the north side of the Bog.  
---
My cowboy would disagree whole heartily with you. 
---
True, I did put points into riffle for my level action riffle, because what feasible cowboy doesn't carry a Winchester into battle?  But most of the time my single action revolver or western revolver are more then enough to deal with any scorched beast dumb enough to mess with my brahmin. 
---
I mean, I may have TSE versions of both big irons, and I have my demolition perk maxed out.........and speed demon to make reloads faster......
---
But still!
---
Update coming next week...
---
What do you mean "what *would* happen with the power armor bug"? isn't that still in the game? i've been playing for a week and i found 4 power armors and 3 of those got bugged as soon as i took them
---
I will be installing that soon. I will report back on the results.
---
Um, no. The people putting out the fires aren't the same people who decide what colour the trucks are.
---
Yup, I got Bird Bones from the queen awhile back but nothing since.
---
But you get to go faster
---
That would just make everything more restricted.
---
The camp budget limit isn't arbitrary; It's there to manage camp-related load on the server and engine.  That's why things that are animated or otherwise active (e.g., turrets) take up much more camp budget than simple static objects like walls.
---
Splitting up the budget into multiple pools wouldn't get you more budget for anything.  It would just mean that Bethesda is the one determining how much of your budget you can devote to defense vs. structure vs. decorations.  You want to prioritize defense?  Oh, that's too bad, you're only given enough budget for a rocket turret and two light machine gun turrets.
---
&gt; I'm saying your regression suite could be as robust as any out there it still won't stop all the bugs in a game like this.
---
But it can stop regressions. Since that is what it is for.
---
I saw this video it was actually not bad
---
Stupid invisible spewers of red laser death.
---
Beersoaked suit, you look down and there's Homer sucking on your trouser leg....
---
Are you talking about a sloped surface with a ladder skin?
---
If I get any more trios of level 80 scorchbeasts attacking my workshops, I'm not claiming any more of them.
---
I hope whoever decided that was a defense mission falls down three stairs and gets 80 bruises from it so they can think about what they've done.
---
Are you serious? If you don't want the weapon then just sell or scrap it. Or politely refuse. What a shitty attitude you have.
---
Oh, I see! Thanks for clearing that up. I've heard it's 5-10% depending on the animal, but I'm not sure. Maybe the train option only comes up if you already have the space available?
---
Man, I wish that warhammer was a thing I knew anything at all about. It just wasn’t something any of my friends were ever into, and I have no idea where to start!
---
Carry your c.a.m.p to a new spot within your build area. It's position seems to affect where you appear.
---
Just got my hands on both+marsupial and bird bones. Not taking my starched genes off ever again
---
Big way to make my game crash put weapons in stash and then all of them out before a nice battle boom crash ughhh
---
So lets increase stash size when duping is at a all time high? Sounds like a brilliant idea.
---
Totally agree 👍
---
I agree. Scorchbeasts are utter crap. You have to have really jacked up weapons to kill them and even then they absorb most of your ammo. I have all sorts of weapon perks and even an explosive weapon and it's  a sheer waste. Are you listening Bethesda? I doubt it. For all the mobbing and sonic blasting crap you have to deal with, the rewards are non existent. This is worse than needing a 3 level lockpick skill for the exact same garbage you find in a lockpick zero.
---
I don't think price is op issue. It's priortizing fixing game issues before adding new content. 
---
Yes but what's the point of dlc if the game dies in a year or two because of problems made by dupers. I might be over reacting from a couple of bad days in fallout 76 but it needs to be done for the benefit of the game. 
---
yup i love making what you just explained out in front of munitions factor for passerbys
---
In Watoga, if you're getting overwhelmed by bots, people will know about it. A flare probably wouldn't be seen, and in general won't make a difference - either people will take pains to help you when they hear or see the bots, or they'll ignore you and simply already happen to be killing bots for scrap, or they'll ignore you because they got other stuff to do.
---
I second this need in game. I have an armor frame for each type of PA and have been slowly adding mods to each as I find them. This requires me to set out up to 7 frames just to find the one I want to work on. My though was simply to put a list of PA parts in the examine description.
---
Right? So OP got attacked at a vendor, didn't like it (and killed the attacking wanker, good for him) but then turns around and kills lowbies the same way? 
---
Sounds like he became the wanker. Lol
---
If that's his version of "fun".... Then yeah. I guess. 
---
Not to put too fine a point on this, but when you have a virtual world like this, open rules/anything goes and the best thing an individual can do is this kind of shit... it says a lot about who that person is IRL. The player may not walk around IRL blowing people's heads off, but that urge to just f*ck people up because they can? 
---
Yeah. Need to go clean your room, bro. Good luck with that. Lels
---
Appalachia ain’t Straya mate:
---
First off, how do you know they were a duper and not just a random player? How do you know it was an all Rise that they killed you with? Also if you just wanted to farm then why did you fight back? There is nothing they can do if you dont fight back to consent to pvp. So if you tried to fight back then that is your own fault and nobody is to blame but you. As for the person trying to follow you for an hour, you should have blocked them and then swapped servers. There is a high chance it would not put you back in the server with that person. The tools are there for you to deal with these kinds of people and it is up to you to utilize them
---
Any competent servers should have no problem tracking MILLIONS of objects at once, it’s literally just a string of numbers to the server in a table. Item X is at XYZ coordinate, [looted/not looted], respawn timer if looted. It doesn’t need to do anything else. Containers are even easier, it’s just a table and a formula to randomize the loot based on percentages and a reset timer. If Bethesda’s engine is set up in some backwards ass inefficient way then sure I could see your point. Someone else said the engine tracks each item individually and not properly when stacked as it should, so 300 items is [steel][steel][steel][steel], etc... instead of [steel][300]

Where are you located, I still need to get the kill an alien trophy.
---
Lol I actually only recently fell in love with it.  I'm 33 years old but only started getting into it about 2 years ago.  I started with the tabletop rpgs (not miniatures, but more like D&amp;D) but it was the Horus heresy books that drew me in the most.
---
Ive gotten a legit bloodied the dragon of an enemy and a minute later the server crashes I don't see Bethesda giving that back to me any time soon
---
Other then aesthetics, you can modify the under armor to add bonuses to SPECIAL.
---
My experience is it’s about 24 hours from the time you pick it up.  As far as refresh when someone else does I don’t know.  Example; while farming the BoS knight uniform plan that spawns in a train near Watoga I could server hop and get a plan to spawn about 60% of the time.  However when I picked up another plan that spawned in the same location I could not get any plans to spawn for 24 hours.  Hope this helps :)
---
Lol I've seen him before. Thanks! 
---
Yeah eso got better from what I remember. Havn't played in a bit. I am holding on for fo76 to get better but am taking a break for a bit. 
---
I am pretty sure that is exactly what he did. 
---
I've had those too. Brown bag full of goodies like stims, radaway, purified water and rad free food but they just ignore the bag. Then, after I've done some squatting near the bag, I resort to shooting the damn bag. Bag is still untouched. I wish they would implement an icon for brown bag, would help a ton.
---
Those are actually good ideas. Flatwoods would probably be more beneficial for the lower level crowd since mobs spawn at lvl 50+ in whitesprings. I would agree if a larger amount of people show up I could do it across multiple servers. This would ideally be for the items I have multiple of or I could buy some on the market specifically for this event if I don’t have enough. Regardless of where I do it. There is probably going to be that one douchebag that nukes the event location. 
---
Thank you lol
---
There was a "minor" holiday in that month.
---
Missle turrets already use a ridiculous amount of budget
---
Let me put it this way it's my favourite broken as fuck game. There are a lot of problems and if you get a bad day it can really frustrate you. Few nights ago I couldn't play more than 30 mins without a disconnect or crash last night I played for a solid 5 hours. 
---
Yep, you nailed it.  I pretty much server hop, unless I am holding more than one workshop.  And even then, its a case by case decision.  They are just too fucking annoying, soak up way too much ammo and dont drop shit.  Its the ultimate zero payout enemy.  Fuck.
---
Yeah but with a literal turret base you can fit like 2 or 3 
---
it's called a job. go tell your boss that, despite your royal fuckup, it's the holidays and you deserve to spend it with your family. go on, see what happens.
---
what Bethesda's doing scare off investors. they're implying there's no commitment on their part.
---
SBQ drops serum recipes... and they are apparently really easy to make.  So, not always duped.  Had a friend get bird bones and craft me one last night.
---
Outline of the Bulge in his pants I am guessing. ;)
---
So, someone else's mutations are ruining your ability to roleplay?
---
I get a weird bug where their head lasers are always charging. Guess it's better than constant death ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I sell them (bears) and trinkets  to vendors when I can for caps and when I don’t need junk mats.
---
Plan: Spear is actually named Plan: Brick Building Set or Plan: Gatling Plasma and you just have to keep buying it until it lets you read it. /s 
---
All this help and they can’t even give me dry towels. 1/10
---
Heh
---
&gt;If people like Aliens: Colonial Marines and they think it's a good game who is anyone to stop them.
---
If people bought A:CM, then poured money into a cash shop for it. Then took to the internet to denounce anyone who didn't like it as a shill or as someone who just didn't *get* it, then guess what the next Aliens game will be like. Guess what the lootbox economy in AAA games would look like if people didn't make such a fuss about EAs system in SWBF2. It was objectively shit or at the very least objectively niche for the industry and companies need to be told when they have missed the mark. And players need to be told when their niche is actively harming the wider industry perception on how to make money. If everyone stayed quiet we would have online-only, MTX-filled mobile games and nothing else by 2020.
---
&gt;What people forget is games are purely subjective for the most part.
---
Meaningless statement that let's you say games are subjective while still leaving arbitrary wiggle room for an objectively bad game.
---
&gt;  I don't think issues should directly impact quality;
---
But
---
&gt;Don't get that confused with saying issues are good or that it can't effect quality. It does but most issues these days are fixed with a patch.
---
Is a direct contradiction, or at the very least a meaningless statement that basically says 'Well issues can impact quality but don't always do so. And by some arbitrary measure I have decided that these issues do not impact quality.'
---
Outstanding defects is a metric that development teams and releases are measured on. So it absolutely does impact their quality.
---
\+1 on benefits for pure strain humans.  I've been running marsupial for so long, not sure I could play the game without it now.  INT hit for gear repair was bad, but a plus to one to remain mutation free would be good. 
---
no shit eh?   So don't pick up the plan you don't want?   Only grab the one you're looking for?
---
It'd be cool if when you had speed demon, carnivore and talons all active at once while you have cannibal active and you get hungry it turns you into a wendigo for a short amount of time. You wouldn't get to pick up items, but it was strictly for getting levels, and every time you ate somebody your timer for being a wendigo reset. While you were a wendigo there could be an event where other players on the map had to kill you  and whomever did got a weapon that deals bonus damage against wendigos and players. It could suck, but having mutation combos with perk cards temporarily changing gameplay would be really helpful in making players work together more often, as well as spicing up gameplay.
---
I’ve got some spare x-01 I got from the super duper perk if you wanted it? It’s just taking up stash space Rn 
---
32 kilobytes fills up fast. No room for a calculator app!
---
Ghoulified is an Endurance perk that lets you heal when radiated. And there's another Endurance perk that lets you heal rads, but only during the day.  
---
... but yeah, your point is cool. Maybe one of the inevitable expansions will let us start down the road of becoming non-feral ghouls.
---
As much as I love fall out I honestly don't think they are going to support it even close to two years 
---
well thank you!   id  love to be able to have a portable tent item.  maybe even something some people get at or shortly after leaving the vault.  
---
i know i could 'blue print' a small Camp for quick use - but i dont want to lose my home build i spend hours and hours on getting everything to snap together right and not float :)  Im hoping others like this idea too and maybe it can be a future in game item. 
---
the raider armor can have the big roll cage attached to the chest that covers your head kinda like the power armor does. the cage is tied to one of the armor mods you can attach. i remember losing the roll cage around my head when i upgraded the armor mod
---
I think you are witnessing boredom not duping. There is no endgame and you can only farm legendary items for so long. That really only leaves griefing as an end game. 
---
Yep, grabbing a plan seems to cause the spawn location to go into a cool down.  Unless I have had really bad luck anyways.
---
Go have a seat, the waiter will be right over with a menu.
---
The game seems to give people a ton of reasons to server hop.
---
You can also find Grafton monsters near the Poseidon power plant (in the dry river bed usually) and at Hemlock Holes (in what used to be the golf course, near a downed vertibird) FYI
---
That’s not an opinion that’s an assumption. If you haven’t played the game it’s literally impossible to have an opinion of it. 
---
Each version of shielded Underarmor gives different bonuses to SPECIAL so it depends on your build
---
Let's not over-think the problem. Just put a cooldown on the blinding screech attack. Anyone at lvl 50 can kill a Scorchbeast easily if they can see it and therefore actually shoot it.
---
The Cannibal Perk has often been a favourite for Melee builds, as it permits you to recoup those HP you're going to lose by always having to close on enemies.  Also, I have seen a number of Iron Stomach and Lead Belly perks that permit recouping health in the field without having to resort to a return home for cooking, and without having to carry food.
---
Thank you. I appreciate, that you appreciate, the finer details. Hopefully you can take some inspiration from my build and incorporate it in yours. Good luck!
---
Might start building my camp there with no turrets, just something nice with open access. Free crafting stations for those wanting to scrap stuff and access STASH during nuke time.
---
lol not me but, might as well have been me! 
---
Yes, I tamed a Giant Sloth with only 3\* Animal Friend equipped.
---
Just find a high rad area and walk in and out of it, once you have one mutation you server jump to someone else. For example I was just jumping between friends on my list getting them. Took me about an hour to get every one. There's a little pool of water outside a broken bunker I believe by Site Bravo that's one of the easiest places to do it but I just can't remember the name exactly.
---
I'm running with everything right now, it's kinda fun, but also a bit annoying at times since I seem to die more. Oh well, it's a new style of play I haven't done yet, so I'm gonna let it ride, lmao
---
Cap vendors on all characters and a week later caps aint a problem.
---
Well its been about three weeks and I have gotten no response from them at all. They banned my entire account so I can't use anything that requires logging in anywhere. I responded within 5 minutes of getting the email, nothing.
---
&gt;  it was not a disaster
---
Provably false.
---
Make yourself a porta-camp. You'd never have that problem again. Also don't pay for something you can farm easily. I believe Georges dump near vault 76 has a BT extractor and you can also farm deathclaw island and the abandoned waste site for it
---
Do you have the perk that allows you to make it? I noticed that even though you can have the mod it can't be attached unless you have the perk that would allow you to craft it, I grabbed a mod for my powerfist and couldn't attach it, my makeshift warrior is only lvl 2 and the mod was lvl 5.
---
They are PISTOLS, they arent meant to be on par with the other weapons. I understand what you mean when you want an armor penetration card, that is a good idea. But pistols have always and will always be secondary means of engagement in games. You cant run around with a 10mm pistol and expect to keep up with any other rifle or melee weapon, it's just not a feasible idea
---
Or in the floors...during a scorchbeast attack. **That** was fun.
---
No they took photo of the screen... don't think that counts? Not sure what they are playing on but both consoles have very easy screenshot buttons and it's just as easy on PC to take screenshots. It just baffles me when people whip out their phone and take a photo of a videogame.
---
I’d send the email to bethesda and ingame help.
---
You’ve got something stuck or buggered in your game queue somewhere.
---
Is this pc or console?
---
Yea I wish it was different.  Not to be that guy, but I’d rather a plan always be on a vendor for a super high price rather than it be a random spawn that causes you to leave and rejoin 100+ times to get it to spawn.  Hard to enjoy the game when you server hop to get what you want, I’d rather be running around exploring and farming caps.  Oh well, back to hopping for the T60 headlamp plans.
---
The far northeast corner of the map there is a small pond with a crashed vertibird in it...  This is a random spawn point.
---
Sometimes?
---
Sometimes it takes you right to the boss. Sometimes it's the first area. Sometimes it's the last and the boss is stuck in geometry......
---
But every event will spawn a legendary, award event rewards for that area, and you get a legendary spawn that might drop something you'd like. Plus it's really convenient if you need adhesive and you get an Angler horde (or similar mob specific thing).
---
Sounds fun, but Friday is when I run my traditional D&amp;D group &gt;.&lt;
---
I'm PS4, that sucks man
---
It's very similar to how EA/DICE and their apologists tried to blame the hate on BFV being because there were women in the game. 
---
That's weird, because I don't remember any hatred about Horizon Zero Dawn having a female lead. 
---
It's easy for people to brush aside criticism if they blame it on the buzzword of the week, whether it's trolls or misogynists. 
---
Thank you! Also side note.  Is it possible to craft heavy combat armor?
---
Sounds good, I’ve added you in the meantime.  GT:  DeltaRecon1120
---
I am a level 41 and every time i see a new playing flatwoods I always offer them a lot of .38 but no one takes it. :(
---
NO  
---
Game is fine
---
This is what you get for 60$
---
Enjoy
---
Take us home kid!
---
Yeah there usually a full raider PA in that trailer 
---
I really want plans you already know to show up as GRAYED OUT in vendors, trades, and dropped bag UI.  That way you can skip anything you already own (or you can still pick it up if a friend needs it).
---
The other day I was trying to put Brotherhood and Deep Pocket upgrades on a chest I found.  Come to find out I didn't have EITHER.  As a level 150+ I thought WTF, I have been buying duplicate BOS and Deep Pocket combat armor forever, how could I NOT have it?  Well I didn't.  Had to go do a bunch more server hopping and eventually got BOS, but ended up paying 1,500 caps to a player for the Deep Pocketed one.
---
She only heals up once.
---
Yeah, I got my first mega sloth there. Good looking out. 
---
There’s no cross plat, so how is this possible?
---
I don't know about the RP point...
---
But mutations are definately way too strong, and the fact you can just stack all of em is kind of ridiculous to be honest. 
---
1 or maybe 2 max..
---
Are radios still gone? I haven’t seen them since  launch
---
I'm about 85% sure that the assaultron beam spam and the scorchbeast blast spam are essentially the same bug.
---
You don't happen to be in the mire, do you?
---
Yah!! Be starting it soon 👌
---
Most people don't equate grinding and quality content.  Exploring, building, and playing with friends is the content most want. Plus you could always grind for plans or atoms.
---
There is no Vault 51 in the Fallout universe, canon or non-canon. You're referring to a vault someone made up in a fan fiction.
---
Oh no that's "Ghoulish". I use it haha along with the day time rad scrub one. Still though it'd be cool for "Toxic Goo" to basically be soup. Could add chem bonuses as ghouls can't enjoy food probably. Inject rp back into the game a bit
---
If you're not playing any more, can I have your in-game stuff?
---
Your chance of actually finding a TSE is like 0.0000000000000001% lol.  
---
Though I do agree TSE are way over used now.
---
Most I’ve seen just buy every plan for their camp since there is no other thing to do
---
Really? Name a console that has a reddit tie in for the platform that easily allows upload of said locally captured image to reddit? Oh yea. There isn't one.
---
Happens to me for every assaultron in nuke silos. I end up having to use like 10 stims per silo run and 99% of the damage is from never ending assaultron lasers.
---
I want everything chrome!
---
My bf wasn't allowed to build his base on solid ground, after the missing data bullshit he couldn't even remove the floors he placed.
---
1) well a guess really insane damage must of been done in order to kill someone in level 50 power amour from the BOS story mission blocker maxed and nearly everything that will keep you alive from the strongest monster in the game.
---
2)I know it was all rise because I have one myself
---
3)I was in passive mode when I died. I never got to fire a shot. Instead got one shot.
---
4) well the block a player did not work for us of course I am a bit mad not stupid of course we used the block features and tools put in the game .
---
Perfect!
---

Its a strange decision.  So you can level an alt to get points for SPECIALS where you want them, or you can level your main to get points for SPECIALS where you want them.  I just stick with my main.  
---
The only difference is you get one special point + one perk card from 2-50. There's bound to be 49 perk cards I double up on if i were to make an alt so really I wouldn't gain anything.  
---
That's my point of view.
---
The thing is, what would be the point of sell prices at vendors being higher? I mean what good would it be if the sell price on an item was over 200? It might as well be 0, because that would make it literally unsellable anywhere. Even if sell prices were just like 50-100, that means the vendor is our of money after selling like 2 things. I can already hit up all 7 vendors and still not be able to sell off everything, resulting in full stash and inventory and eventually just dropping things. Unless vendor cap limit increases, or additional vendors with separate cap pools are added, there's really no point in using chems or perks to increase sell values. At the end of the day you are walking out with 1400 caps, and then dropping the excess. The only difference is if you hit that 1400 quicker, that's just more stuff you are throwing away.
---
I'm definitely interested! Can you post your timezone? I can confirm availability from that. 
---
&gt; right to remain stupid
---
To be fair, Marsupial does give -4 int. So he has the right to remain smart.
---
I need something to drown out the crickets by my shack.
---
Same is found at Dunwich Borers in Fallout 4. There was a whole cult around this place...
---
I found my sloth there as well...  RIP Sebastian
---
Am I the only one that kites the legendaries and uses the "follow me" emote so that others can tag?
---
You should be able to guess where they're coming from if you've explored those places before. but you get extra xp  if you go to an area with nothing there
---
Wait, do people not go back to their camps to log out?
---
Of course, if your camp is at the whitesprings, or near Fissure Prime... Yeah that could be a problem. Nobody ever nukes Monongah though,  so I'm safe as hell. :)
---
Well I was in passive I am sure of the and this one wanted me dead 
---
Pretty sure they won't give you 10 caps back, since they won't buy plans at all.
---
I've been wondering.   
---
I'm trying harpers ferry for the marine armour.   
---
I grabbed a second Torso plan and havent seen anything since, should left it.
---
Do you still play? Can you trade? 
---
Step 1 - Make sure you have both Starched Genes and Class Freak perk cards.  Not worth it without  those 2 cards equipped.
---
Step 2 - Figure out what mutations you want.  Not all of them are beneficial for every build.  If you get melee damage mutations and you're a ranged character, that's a waste, and you'll just be eating negative effects for no reason.
---
Step 3 - Farm your mutations.  There are guides on how to do it.  Do NOT try to farm ALL of your mutations this way, the RNG factor will give you mutations you don't want.  Farm 3-5 mutations MAX, then buy serums for the rest.
---
Step 4 - Do NOT buy serums from the enclave vendor.  4,000 caps is a crap price.  Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar and you'll find players selling every single mutation there.  Usually for about 1,000 caps.  Sometimes a bit higher or lower than that.
---
Agreed boss 
---
Funny how that works, what with Beth selling decor items for hard-currency in the in-game store.
---
ninti - It never occurred to me to try to use the “combine bags” function to retrieve dropped loot.  Will have to test to see if that works!
---
I do, I'll run up, use a regular hit to just hurt it them run back do others get a hit marker as well.
---
I'm leaving the band, you guys forgot about the music!
---
Can't PS4 to PC don't we all wish.  Us PC players tend to be little more paranoid than console players, it is why I can't/won't trade.  Can't risk my computer/won't support duping.
---
I've crashed three times in 15mins at whitesprings this morning idk wtf is going on with servers
---
But there's still a chance. :)
---
Best swimsuit model ever.
---
Damn people still play this game? 
---
I'd guess that goes also with farming, there are more interesting places than the golf club day in, day out :D
---
Imagine a 2 shot flare, people would come over just to check it out
---
Wow, so now this has become a pity party. You might just want to move on if you’re keen on playing the victim so easily 
---
No haha just search "nuke codes this week" and head on down to a silo with your nuke card
---
https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
Ghoulish? Ah, my apologies.  
---
But yeah, a lot of the ghouls in FO3/FO4 were around from the time of the war. I assume they fled the area due to the scorched, but it would be nice to see _some_ sign of them, or even give us the option late-game of turning.
---
It'll depend on publicity and the level of materials given.
---
Low levels would love to get what you're offering.  
---
Then, of course, someone may Nuke the place while you're doing this...
---
I’m level 140 and if you tasked me with finding a scorchbeast it would take less than two minutes to find one. Then another one. And another. And so on. In fact it’s literally the easiest specific enemy to find. It’s so easy to find and kill a scorchbeast at this point that I have like 300 plus scraps of ultracite. Not a rare enemy by any means. Robots in Watoga, mole miners in mines, and scorched in Morgantown are the only enemies I can think of that are easier to find. 
---
You have a better chance like everyone else to just buy it.
---
Unless you bought the recipe straight up for 19k. Then you gotta factor in the cost to make up the difference too. 
---
There are the codes for this week and yea at the end out in the code for the silo you are in
---
Thank you for the in depth reply!
---
That is still not a on reason if I am bord if farming I ether do something else or help someone.
---
marsupial can usually get you within teleport range for melee vats. its not perfect but its better than wasting ammo shooting it for 5 minutes when you're 100% melee build
---
Really? Man, I've only fought her 4 times and only get prime receiver mods. Are they rare drops or something?
---
Unfortunately, those codes at pointless as it stands, unless you like hard work and code breaking....
---
Speed demon is a single yellowcake, cap value of the mats is probably 100 or so. I give those serums away like candy, and they are certainly not duped.
---
Hmmm, you can use nukacrypt.com to get the codes. It's a pretty difficult process to solve it yourself, you'd need more of the cypher word that's displayed in the bunker.
---
If you want to do endgame nuke zones, you'll also need to invest in ghoulish and have a friend go with you while you both have radsponge on.
---
Otherwise, you'll need radsheild and leaded heavy robot or marine armor along with the ghoulish perk. A vampire weapon wouldn't hurt either to help reduce the number of stimpaks you have to use/carry.
---
Actually my screen froze , twitch today in a nuked WS , first time the *entering power armour* animation froze and the second time i tried to switch a perk card
---
I'm running a maxed agility and luck pistols/shotguns VATS build. My black powder pistol and pipe revolver are crazy good. 
---
With critical savvy, better criticals and gunslinger I have no problems taking down anything. 
---
why not just server hop, if the place is "taken"?
---
Mabey not but I was not sure if saying a 6 month was too sort
---
NO
---
Ty for your feedback
---
Bethesda support :)
---
I agree this should be an option. In the meantime I take a picture of the players on that server with be at the time so I can join one of their gamertags. Also if I remember being near to someone I’ll try reconnecting to recent players 
---
My first nuke zone that was the first gun I picked up and boy did it net me 4 or 5 levels just zap everything watch it chain and the big boys did all the heavy lifting. 
---
My friend saw a mirelurk queen wrecking a scorchbeast so he shot the scorchbeast once and let the mirelurk queen kill it. The only time I have heard of an easy scorchbeast kill. Also mirelurk queen real boss of fallout 76.
---
Eastern Standard Time. Edited it into the post.
---
Ffs 😂 thank you mate 
---
You're ignoring that the change on your main is extremely slow. There is no way to readily change playstyles without an alt. If I want to play a sniper build, and I don't have a sniper alt, I'm stuck sinking 20 more levels into my main to move my SPECIALs to where they need to be to use the perk cards that build requires. Moreover, once I do this, I no longer have access to whatever playstyle that main was. 
---
warframe eidolons are more annoying but they'er certainly not my favorite part of this game.  on my melee character i just hide behind things until they land and then they can be melee'd in about 10-15 seconds but until that point it's annoying.  that's the reason i don't make any characters without maxed sneak and stay out of power armor while running around.
---
Do you like Minecraft?
---
Ahhh made life easier 
---
 ***Yeah if game mechanics allow people to be assholes you should expect people to be assholes.*** 
---
\- ReturnOfTheLastJedi
---
 Same goes for downvotes, eh?  Consider your Karma Raided.
---
Eastern Standard time, edited into the post.
---
jukebox!
---
Thank you for proving my point. TSE are not overpowered. You just proved my point. The builds taking advantage of the perk cards is what your referring too. They have already said they where looking at rebalancing some of the perk cards back in December.
---
See TSE are not over powered. Your complaining about people using the perk card system in a way for build that enhance the guns abilities. That is not the same thing.
---
Then what was the whole point of the free states or whoever trying to build those towers to force the scorchbeasts to land when they could have just shot at it with a flare gun?
---
What platform are you on?  I’m PC.  I have like 3 of the leg plans.
---
Yeah I mean fingers crossed that they do support it that long. But with the way shits been going so far on bethesdas end I just don't see it happening. 
---
I don't think it makes much sense for them to intentionally leave major things out only so they could add them back in later. Do all that work and then delay the reward? Why? 
---
I think it's a lot more straightforward: the game was rushed out in a half-finished state, and many of their ambitious plans got thrown away as the glaring issues with underlying systems became the problem.
---
I mean, this game has food that spoils and fridges you can build. But you can't make food last longer by putting it in the fridge. That sort of thing is obvious, basic design for a survival MMO. The people who made Skyrim know how these things work. But they didn't have time to do it. 
---
Except you can't because the game scans for Cheat Engine.
---
Exactly!
---
Pc?? On xbox you can join recent players i think ps4 has that option too not to sure
---
Eastern Standard Time for the time zone, and I'll definitely post updates if we get it off the ground.
---
there's also the little cooler
---
That is what is keeping me playing pretty much. The quest to have one drop. If I buy it I feel I will just stop playing right after cuz there wont be anything to play for anymore.
---
To each his own. I know I have had a number of people try and rattle my cage to get me to engage. I just ignore them. 
---
It’s my first nuke run didn’t realise a website exists 😂
---
I am pretty sure one of my characters has it.... just not the other... so it caught me by surprise when i wanted to set it down.. i was like "hey.. my other character has it... why not this one?"
---
Trust me, goods sold at a reasonable rate are appreciated by other players. Trading is a bit of a ‘fall on your sword’ moment as the interface is so bloody confusing, but the game needs a lot more people doing it. Hopefully there are some QOL adjustments coming. 
---
I never had enough ammo either at a lower level, and I was sick of those damn pipe weapons, but it made finding a 10mm and semi-decent armor to be more of an event. Sure, I would’ve been grateful if someone left those things in a crate for me to discover, but it also removes a sense of pride and achievement (sorry, couldn’t resist.) 
---
That was very annoying as my last code piece had to fight two scorch beasts and their fucking blasts 
---
That's like the go-to reference from that show isn't it? I even saw a Garfield cartoon screenshot recently where John found a fish in a percolator!
---
Finally finished my brick homestead with natural wood flooring last night, and noticed this while trying to fill it.  Very few choices compared to FO4.
---
So you can just defend and repair one station?  Great tip.
---
Known bug that the fusion core in your PA is reset to 100 on log in. Had a friend of a friend recharge 20 FC's to full by switching in a new one, closing the game and restarting it. Dunno why he bothered, but he did it.
---
You can also get addicted to the tea from the giant teapot, I cured it before i checked the - tho.
---
I thought we had welcome mats? I see them all the time in the rug sections.
---
lol you’re good. That was me too at first. 
---
Every 20 real hours they refresh
---
I’m thinking of maybe planning it for Saturday to give it a few days to build some traction. I am open to any recommendations for high level players as well. Maybe farm some hazmat suits and hand them out to participants so in the chance someone does nuke it, they will be able to still enjoy the event. 
---
Hard too when you are one shot in passive mode 
---
I've done that and monster mash over 100 times, nearly always fucking leg armour, there are some very well armoured millipedes knocking around Appalacia right now....
---
20 hours since you last visited them, Real time
---
&gt; The description actually reads that it prevents new mutations,
---
It says "You will never mutate from Rads". So the description makes it seems like a serum would work....but like you said, would you want to risk it after spending nearly 4k? 
---
I kind of forgot I even got them 😂 don’t think I have seen one used either. Do you get a notification if someone uses one?
---
Agreed, I hope Bethesda patches the game so they are removed due to us defeating the Queen when they advance the storyline sometime in the future.
---
Yeah I’ve read that you could use that for help but I assume it’s a new week as it said in progress ?
---
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU....
---
She's really glowing.
---
Yeah, I second this for all events.  Let people get a hit in on at least the legendary ones.  Nothing annoys me more than some asshat one shotting everything that moves.
---
HINT, want to have some fun?  Make sure you have pacifist on and constantly run in front of them.  If it's a TSE weapon, there's a chance they'll hit you and kill themselves.  If they try to initiate PVP, with pacifist on it won't do much damage and they can't do the same thing to you.
---
My one exception to that rule is events like Uranium Fever.  90% of the enemies aren't legendary, and if you let them live, they'll hit the extractors and break them.  I'm fine with killing the normal enemies there as fast as possible, ONLY if you switch to a weaker weapon when the legendary ones show up (so everyone can hit it).
---
You mean 7/6.
---
Tag and go. Leg them if I have a shotgun.
---
This is a problem for all explosive energy weapons seems to be unaffected by demo expert. Not sure about the gauss though. Unless somehow the standard crystallized barrel is considered explosive, I have no clue about the furious one. 
---
He went in to trade with me and I accepted to see what he had since he was really high leveled. The thing was my frames dropped even being around him and worsened during the trade. I tried to end the trade with him but ultimately ended up crashing. 
---
He had the basic duped items; serums, weapons, bobbles heads, the normal stuff that people dupe. 
---
What an absolute unit.
---
imagine accidentally exiting your power armor
---
We've downed her about 20 times, that's the only serum recipe that's dropped so far.  I always get explosive vents and either right or left ultracite legs
---
And the invisible squad mate
---
They solve them prettty quick as it drives more traffic their way. I think it was solved within a few hours of the codes resetting. Idk how they do it, but it's right! 
---
For your level Morgan town and Tyler co fair grounds are probably the best bet
---
i dont know, i dont really need that explosive shotgun anymore I guess
---
Don’t forget the random seller at Charleston
---
Take note the flatwood walk is mostly because it costs little ammo is gain a decent amount of ammo. This is because I am level 49 and just punch them all to death
---
A baby mega sloth is just a normal sloth with extra steps. 
---
Although true it is part of the gameplay. As I said in the post I just responded to I would probably farm hazmat suits and hand them out to participates. In the off chance someone does nuke it. 
---
How about a syringer that makes them land? My endurance is only 1 and I don’t use vats that much 
---
not that i know of, sorry. just heard faint whispers while i was doing cold case
---
Since when was it a hoarder game? The simple fact that there is a stash limit, means you're not supposed to hoard. "Untill whole caves would be stuffed" wait you mean a limit? It makes sense not to have unlimited space.
---
Good call. I’m at work so I couldn’t check, I distinctly remember people claiming issues regarding serums and the perk though, so it’s possible in the back end it prevented them entirely at one point or that they changed the text on the perk along with a patch. I’ve never bothered taking the chance though.
---
I thought he uses the same wallet as the other Responders ..?
---
That would be improper
---
If exploration is your favorite aspect of Fallout games, then yes, you'll probably like it.
---
The fast travel welcome mat appears under the Misc tab
---
Ps4, it's rough.
---
23 kills no plans.  Including 12 level 80.  Also 6 sbq.  5 disappeared and good luck finding that meat pile in a nuke zone with tall grass AND about 60 other piles.  
---
That I don’t know. He may. 
---
I bought X01 servos or something, I need to try to install them, thanks for the tips.  I've yet to see it/install a found mod.  It should just be something you can scrap and learn.  Then forever build.  
---
oh, damn. aight
---
Instead of going after the camps, I prefer to instakill all the ghouls, so there's no loot for people like OP, who think loot gained from farming Whitesprings is hard earned.
---
IF your starving you get a free cannibal perk but you get a debuff while in the sun (win-dingo) 
---
If your thirsty you get a melee attack that Drinks water from non robots but get a debuff during the day (vampire) 
---
Only a few items are worth bulking anyways. I think aluminum, lead, and steel. Things like screws and gears actually weigh more bulked...if I remember correctly. 
---
lol. They dont "test" server stability you naive tomato. They're checking server stability over the last month, say "ooopsi, we fucked up the rest of the game so hard that we cant say anything about the data we got" and say well poop.  
---
that what beth does.
---
I do also agree that it was rushed out to meet whatever schedules Big Business demands, but 76 is different from previous Fallout games in that this one is supposed to be their first attempt at a quasi-MMO "Games as a Service" type thing. They want players to stay with this game for a long time and keep playing, keep buying atoms, keep grinding away over years rather than getting it all done and dusted within a couple of months.
---
To that end, you need to keep releasing new content and patches to keep players interested. But what if, instead of releasing a complete, fully featured game as you envisioned it in the beginning, you released a game that was only halfway there so you could finance making the rest of  it as you went along, and just call the patches and updates 'new content'?
---
It does make sense in that regard - yes they do have a plan for what the game will eventually be, but you just drip feed it in small updates relieving pressure on your development teams and keeping players playing.
---
I saw them last night at harpers on my level 12 guy(dont ask what i was doing in harpers at level 12)
---
The serum I have learned takes 5 antiseptic, 5 bone, 1 fluorescent flux and 1 ultracite. That is CHEAP as hell to make, and super duper can proc. Out of my 20 saved fluorescent flux I got 28 serums. That's 2800 caps at minimum price of 100/each. Definitely not below the cost to make them
---
Ok I will that might be the case or someone found a way round it
---
At level 18, hit Eastern Regional Penitentiary, north of Morgantown. When you hit max level, clear out Fort Defiance for aluminum, steel, ballistic fiber, and plastic. If you just need plastic (and you will if you bulk out all your scrap ((and you should bulk out all your scrap))) go through Morgantown high school and Watoga high school. When I need circuitry, I grab all the phones inside Whitesprings; no enemies makes it an easy 5 minute circuit.
---
Very cool. It blends into the landscape and looks a lot like a pre-existing building. 
---
My GT is ClickedAgenda91 - If you want to add me, I'm online basially every night every other week. If you wanna join, just send an invite whenever im online (this is the other week, on friday till next thursday i'll be active
---
pretty much why I stopped playing, will come back to it in a few months once the issues are ironed out though
---
I mean.. even if it was legin, i wouldn't say it's a good start.  All it would do is confirm only a hint of attention to the matter.
---
I'd love a clean pre-war house set, like Nate and Nora's home in Fallout 4. That, and more decorations to help me make a 50s diner!
---
Weaker, sure. I headshot everything anyway. 
---
My bigger problem is the lack of decent pistol models. I’m using a freaking pipe revolver mostly, because it’s the best damage thing I can put a suppressor on. Sure I’d love a god-roll 10mm, but the damage is so low I’d need it to have two primaries (anti-armor and any other - instigating, furious, exterminator) to be worth while instead of my western or pipe revolver.
---
So I use a suppressed pipe revolver mostly, and an anti-armor western. 
---
Oh and a TSE sub machine gun but without any rifle perks.
---
And when someone kills it, does it respawn?
---
Sure. 
---
I have Laser/rocket turrets at mt WS backdoor base, but they are powered off when i'm not home, and turn them on only when I want to pull the place for my own exp/loot run. Is it your duty to break that base too, or do you are least take the time to look at whether the turrets are active or not?
---
This never bothers me. I love seeing the different ways to farm, and the method you mentioned isn’t super innovative, but it is certainly efficient. The ghouls are always a high enough level that [simple] turrets seem to only slow them down so everyone can tag a creature before the melee cats clean up. I’ve seen level 150+ using nearly worthless 10mm pistols so they don’t slay them too quickly. Sure turret farming makes the job easier but people are there to level up, and as long as people are letting others tag and not being dicks about accidental aggro, it is usually a great time all around. Paper bags everywhere for lower levels or anyone who is interested.
---
If it actually crashes the server, then that is a bummer. And I can also see how it would attract all enemies to one place, away from those posted up at different farming locations. I won’t build those camps, but I also won’t mini-nuke them unless people are hogging XP with swift kills.
---
Sit close to them and jump in front of their bullets so they can suicide themself with their own TSE weapon.
---
Yeah i usually only have an hour a day, but a lot of the time is spent just doing character maintenance then maybe 20 minutes of getting along with a quest! If yall like this game i so dont recommend having s full time job and family lol
---
I am about 200 hours also, no TSEs or explosives...about 5-6 Two shots.
---
Really oh awesome which set do you have?
---
Onyxia dropped raid loot and was a 40-player raid boss in a video game from 14 years ago.
---
Good to know I thought it was a Easter egg from fallout 4
---
Super mutants in huntersville, ghouls at the whitespring, gulpers in Gulper (valley?), Mirelurks at a ditch south of.... A train station in the east Ashheap. There are lots of consistent places.
---
If they found a way around it, I am out. Then the game becomes griefer central. 
---
PHO1561
---
The problem with this is that if the spot you were in on that sever becomes populated how do you propose they slot you in? This is why get the "queue" message for because there is no room.
---
It's not difficult to download a quality screenshot from your console and share it on social media.
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/427okJe
---
Yea I spent two days looking for a spot, planning out the base layout, building and meticulously placing everything in such a way that I can fit an obnoxious amount of things in the small space they give us, only to think I’ve finally completed a perfect base for myself, aaaaaaand then my friend spawns in the foundation. Now I have the perfect base with one foundation missing 
---
There is no escape.  Resistance is futile.
---
It already is 
---
It’s a great place
---
I've tried this and it seems to work for a bit, but eventually it reverts.  My camp spans across a steam and I originally did not spawn in the stream.  Now I spawn there 90% of the time, the other 10% I spawn inside of my water purifier.  I moved the camp and started spawning on the edge of the creek, but now I'm back in the creek again.
---
pf, 600 stash means about 30-50 explosive shotguns/handmades. no need to stash anything else.  
---
also mules. My mule has about 5000pounds on him
---
Yes please or at least make them stop spamming their sonic attacks for a few seconds, with like a 25% chance to land or something. Imo flare guns are useless unless you are roleplaying with them for something
---
I have a full time job as well as having a dog and a lady in my life and I have plenty of time to play lol.
---
It's more like this: I love Fallout and play 76 because of the RP elements and I don't want to RP a kangaroo with scales and talons wearing power armor, but at the same time I want to be able to compete with people with 10 mutations.
---
The only other two spots I know that spawn it are the shed at Superior Sunset Farm, and a traincar that is on the tracks in between Watoga Station and the NAR repair yard.  Both are on the farm is on a barrel next to the armorbench and the train is on top of two crates usually glitched on its side.  Good luck!
---
Why would people get kicked out of their discords though? Bethesda doesn't have anything to do with discord.
---
My current camp on my one character spawns me inside of a cliff face.  I spawn inside a rock every time I fast travel back.
---
Why, in Horus's name, is this comment not upvoted more on the factor or sheer truth and hilariousness?
---
"recent players " does not update sometimes , i just joined the last recent player , who should have been a level 205 , but guess what , it was not that guy , it was someone who i have seen 3 hours ago
---
&gt; more rewarding to farm them yourself unless
---
Standing in a rad pool next to a shower and server hopping every 2 minutes to game the system is the opposite of "rewarding". Almost borders on "abusing a flaw" in my books.
---
If server hopping didn't reset the mutation timer, I would certainly agree on the "rewarding" experience. You earned it in this case. 
---
I keep thinking it should be a buff/debuff gun
---
I'm pretty sure they also have a cap of 200, as I bought a serum from the bunker and it didn't put back more than 200 into the wallet. TL;DR: Sell first, then buy.
---
It's not that bad. If memory serves, the first tier prefix (where Two-Shot is) has 24 potential variants. So Two-Shot chance is 1 in 24. The second prefix tier (where Explosive is) has only 8 variants. So Explosive is only 1 in 8 chance. So the odds of *something* that is Two-Shot Explosive is what, 1 in 192? So, 0.005, or 0.5%. I mean...yeah, the odds are literally a fraction of 1%. Plus, that legendary may turn out to be a pipe pistol. So there's that. The odds of it being a handmade rifle, assuming all weapons are equal, would indeed be microscopically small. Though it does help that certain weapons, like Hunting Rifles, don't generate legendaries at all.
---
Edit: I'm running on 5 hrs sleep, so don't kill me if I fudged the math. Actually...do kill me...since math is kinda the whole point of the post. Fuck... :(
---
They have a 6th sense for players under 50. My level 61 player can three shot scortched beasts but are all no where to be found when he is out int he wild... my level 12... literally tons of spots i found as my high level have sbs everywhere...

Groovy, dig the atmosphere around there. Of course my heart yerns to come back to Southern Half of WV

9 points in slugger, expert slugger and master slugger for 60% is a waste. Just take 1 point in each for 30%, then pick up martial artist and blocker.

Except, Skyrim dragons are actually varied, give you actually useful resources aka dragon souls or simply crafting resources which you can sell for a decent amount, and they actually somewhat work, unlike scorchbeasts which are basically all the same and can't even function properly. I'm pretty sure modders wouldve done a better job with them than beth did. HEH
---
I do have to agree and the lag! 
---
When the server has a place for you or just to put you in the queue*
---
It depends what I'm after at the time.
---
Camp McClintock is a good source of springs from the amount of clipboards there, it has a moderate amount of ballistic fiber and adhesive there too.
---
Looks awesome, sir!
---
Haha well played.
---
But this is Fallout, and in Fallout things often seem what they are not.
---
Please God no....that annoyed the shit out of me.  Carrying around like 7000 rounds just in case.  Cluttered my inventory.  That is one thing from Vegas I hated.  
---
**RAD-SPONGE!!**
---
All this time Krieg was trying to use his meat bicycle to strip away their radiation... Give that man a Nobel Peace Prize!
---
how high is your luck? i have 15 luck and i notice a lot more stuff spawns for me than my kid with zero luck.
---
Thinking combinatoricly, regression testing games seems like a impossible to win battle. The real answer is that these companies should be following a SaaS model where updates/patches are often and user feedback driven. 
---
lol.
---
Noone is saying UNLIMITED space. But when I cant store literally 2 times the amount i can CARRY, either stash limit is fucked, or carry weight.
---
And since the only thing consistent of those 2 in the last 15 years of bethesda games is the carry weight limit, I would suggest we should up the stash limit.
---
5000 pounds splitted to food, ammo, weapons, armor and misc racks and we're good
---
Cancer Farts
---
You’re a moron 
---
I agree with the cooldown affect, but maybe the minute cooldown should be player based. Otherwise you could cycle through like 10 flare guns to avoid the cooldown
---
Im on pc. Also, as long as it's possible to dupe I won't buy shit.
---
In Fallout 1, When you put leather armor on then the unwanted dog will follow you. Also that leather armor from Fallout 1 look similar to Mad Max.
---
Cliff-racers are from a 16-year old game.
---
Still doing HOA inspections?
---
I've read other people say that their tamed pets would respawn a few times before disappearing completely.  My guy was killed by scorched once and never came back.  RIP Sebastian.
---
I am thinking of building my camp in the spot these guys use just to hold the spot and deny them the space. I hardly use my camp anymore so I think I will take the spot and drop a bunch of pipboy statues pointing at one another.
---
Pretty sure no, plus caps replenish on it when other players buy from it. 
---
Don’t forget grahm
---
Wait, did you say you have a 4* machete?! I thought the highest in the game was 3*? 
---
Oh, just realized - it's 20 hours from the first time you visit, not the last. If you sell $150 at 10 AM and go back and sell for the other $50 at 4 PM, the vendor -should- restock at 6 AM the next day.
---
Will you be on in 12 hours? I’d like to buy a few. 
---
We have flairs?
---
Isn't that why you use pistols as I secondary weapon, stealth or lucky cow boy or girl gun Fu style.
---
I think there is a method to the madness.i believe the last set of armor you got out of is the last one listed in your inventory once you put it in your pocket. I don't think it matters in what order you pick them up. I'll have to do more testing. I wad having this experience the other day when I was doing repairs and adding mods to T60 and excavator. The last set I was in ended up listed last. Every time. Kept confusing me at first. 
---
Honestly, one of the best mechanics in New Vegas
---
I'd say it's probably related to the same reason you drop generic paper bags rather than individual items, but as long as these were tied into your CAMP's budget, I don't see the problem.
---
I know there are some people want that in 76.
---
Only aluminium and lead weigh less when bulked, everything else weighs the same. There was some misinformation spread about the weights due to the way certain perks round numbers when reducing the weight.
---
As a level 140 powerbuild pistolero I was considering myself pretty strong, being able to kill 28 mutants (my record) without leaving the VATS once. As level 141 TSE shotgunner without any shotgun perks I was immensely stronger.
---
I've been using it a lot lately when i go to check the vendor. Glad i saw this because clearing up a few rads just be cause I'm passing through anyways isn't worth losing mutations.
---
My end game is kinda like Thanos after the snap.  I just sit on my porch watching the sunset and occasionally murder people who mess with my crops.
---
Low level supermutant towns/locations that tote pipe rifles. 
---
Can't you scrap from the stored menu? You don't have to place the object in order to delete it.
---
&gt;If yall like this game i so dont recommend having a full time job and family lol
---
I have a relationship and a 9-year-old son, I work two jobs (1 FT and 1PT), I run tabletop RPG sessions 2 nights a week, and I still play Fallout 76 for several hours most days. These things are certainly not mutually exclusive. It's all about managing your time and making sure you have time to do the things you enjoy too.
---
I don’t know if this qualifies as a feature request, or a quality-of-life request. You should be able to either see the total amount of weight multiple items are taking, or be able to sort by BULK
---
For real Bethesda just delete the classical radio. I want to hear 16 tons in my base dangit 
---
K fine so I left some out, sorry my list wasn’t as extensive as yours. Downvote all you want, a scorchbeast is still as easier to find as any enemy you can add to the list. 
---
Yah sounds nice try around the tower overlooking white spring
---
i mean, its pretty easy to tell where you are, if the ground is red, cranberry bog, wet and dark, the mire. so one, so one
---
Software-as-a-service models also incorporate robust regression suites of unit, integration, system, black-box and user acceptance testing. You don't find out your HR system breaks every quarter with the new pushed version and then gets patched 3 days later.
---
Games, just like business systems, have a core set of features and functionality that should *never* break. As new features are added the testing framework for those features are added to the regression suite so that future releases do not rebreak something that used to work. That is robust, if you fix something then break it again you clearly aren't testing the correct success/failure cases of that content and it makes it look like the developers are just a bunch of renegades throwing code over the fence.
---
YOU GET BACK HERE AND LET ME HELP YOU DAMMIT! haha
---
 Yup... I even bought the stupid fucking Welcome Mat in the stupid fucking shop for Atoms and it doesn't even FUCKING WORK.
---
Looks really good.  Too bad you can't do it without turrets as this would free up a lot of budget.
---
Accuracy is fine, but the problem is the bullets come out in a V pattern. So if you want to hit shit far away, you have to aim right or left so one of the projectiles will land. 
---
Here's a diagram:

                  You
---
Get the Scrapper perk but don’t expect it to be like FO4, sadly. You get more scrap but it’s still sort of nerfed. 
---
Reasonable, but I don't dupe. I just have 400+ hours in the game and collect a lot of things including recipes
---
Ayeeeeee
---
Your perk idea won't work.. as perks can be equip and unequip... What do you mean if you unequip your card while being at budget cap? Destroy stuff randomly?  
---
Also, since over-time you can get ALL the perks upgraded to max level, it becomes pointless. Make it passive (like they did with the stash size, it applies to everyone).
---
I completely agree. I normally just use shadowed armor whenever I can, partly for the stealth bonus, but also because I just like the way it looks. But I'd love to be able to get just a basic black paint for my armor and/or guns, especially if it's applied as a *paint*, since that'd let me still use whichever other mods I want for stats.
---
I had a (now deleted) thread about a turret-based character build.
---
Basically it would expand on the Home Defense Perk and allow characters to deploy up to 4 turrets in the wild (powered by Fusion Cores).
---
One of my suggestions for a new turret was a turret that brought Scorchbeasts down. I was thinking something like a spiked net cannon, or even a simple harpoon cannon.
---
Ask for a refund:)
---
Can I like this twice?  
---
That is amazing awesome as Fuck and I hope they don’t fix it to soon. With that being said if I stumbled across it I’d have to mini nuke the fuck out of just to see how it would look breaking apart, sorry nothing personal. Haha
---
How did you lose your main?
---
Unfortunately not, I try to be in bed by 10pm est on weeknights
---
Upvote only because of Bender, personally would ask you to avoid the rocket turrets... god the lag they cause.
---
It would be cool if there was super a lot more and Lunch Boxes turned out to be items we get in the game sometimes as loot from chests and enemies, rewarding things for building in camp, atoms, and sometimes higher cost bigger ticket atom store items.
---
I think instead of this there is a need for better pistols.
---
.44 AutoMag
---
Colt .45
---
If you are expecting 150-200 pt damage pistols then I'm sorry but that is a bit much outside the TSE's.
---
Scorch Beasts are basically Drop Bats, fuckers appear out of the sky like nothing you just hear the flapping in the back ground 
---
This is Fallout, pistols and a nonsense enough build should be unstoppable.
---
In my dreams I still recall the beautiful times of 16 needler AP shots per turn in F2.
---
There's no big-tiddy eldar gfs in game, why would he show up?
---
I'm not ignoring it, it's just not really slow.  For me anyway.  A few hours in whitesprings will get you 3-4 levels pretty easily.  That's a conservative estimate.  Further down the road.. not too much further, i also expect to have level ups banked as well.  Which would give me the ability to change on a whim.  Not that I'd need to move many points to begin with.
---
You keep contradicting yourself also.  For example "change on your main is extremely slow" and "there is no way to readily change playstyles".
---
And before that, "difficulty of changing my SPECIAL allocation" and "If I could just change SPECIALs".
---
Yes the disconnects are super annoying.  Having said that, giving us the ability to "Join Last Server" would help a tad.  
---
I’ll send you message when I’m online 
---
Or...badger Bethesda to pull their head out of their ass and stop relying purely on RNG. Especially when it was proven, over and over, that pure RNG in a game of this type is not a good idea. 
---
Case in point, Elder Scrolls Online relied on pure RNG for traits on weapons and armor. Took them a few years, but they pulled their head out of their ass, and added transmutation stations, which, for a price, let you choose a different trait on an item. This was over a year ago.
---
Before that, The Division devs also relied purely on RNG for talents on weapons and gear. Only took them a few months to pull their head out of their ass, and add recalibrating stations, which let you reroll a talent, for a price. This wasn't *that* good, because you still needed a "mostly good" gun, and then you rerolled (RNG again!) the "not good" talent on a "mostly good" gun, until you got the gun you want. Bloody expensive, and annoying, which is one of the reasons the game never reached the popularity it could have had, but better than FO76's pure RNG approach. This was a couple of years ago ('16?).
---
Before that, it was Diablo 3 and reforging. And so on, and so forth. Going back years. Proving, over and over, that pure RNG is bad. I think that whole debate was ended when Borderlands released (in '09?). The game's big schtick was that it had 17.5 million gun permutations. Which is nice on paper, but in practice it means the game has 17,499,001 shit guns, and 999 good guns. And your odds of getting a good gun, of the type you enjoy playing (pistol, smg, shotgun, rifle, etc.) were stupidly low. Which made the game fairly unpleasant,  because if RNG fucked you, and kept fucking you, you stayed fucked. 
---
It just amazes me, in this day and age, that developers still don't know/don't care that running the game on RNG is a really, really, *really* fucking bad design choice.
---
new skins = more money for atoms  
---
they are already rubbing their hands thinking about the next skins 
---
Vanilla skyrim dragons are pretty eh. They were cool and varied in the first few playthroughs but felt relatively the same later on. When you mod them up though it becomes really awesome!
---
Ehh I don't like the idea of TSE weapons.   Anyone can be super powerful with one of those. 
---
Rather than tracking the state of it, I think the game just asserts that if you login wearing power armor, your fusion core is full.
---
This is my spot for Ballistic Fiber (Stupid Scorchbeasts and their spammed out sonar breaking my armor). Good source for 6-10 usually. And yeah, forgot there are probably around 15-20 clipboards up in that place. 
---
I agree.   Ive lost hundreds of caps from disconnects.   But for the sheer fast travel usages, they're necessary.   I like to keep my camp near whitesprings, own the ammo factory, and have vault 76.  Thats three fast travels (west, central, north/east) that saves fast travel costs.  That's not including the junk and ammo you make.  Sometimes I wish people would just share the ammo factory so we'd all have a free fast travel and not constantly take it from each other 😂
---
I must have been thinking about  fallout 4s system but not this however the stash does need to be increased and the budget definitely, and maybe stop haveing stored items count towards budget
---
Every Assaultron at Watoga kept rapid-firing their beams at me too. I had no Power Armor with me so I died easily.
---
That’s what it was. Thanks for the clarification!
---
Thats... pretty impressive actually.
---
Went to look inside a golf bag close to top of the world and it was probably a duper getting more junk, i like building people camp so i got kinda greddy and took it, next thing i now im naked and my pipboy wont load
---
Mine does the same thing except it drops me to where I break my legs nearly everytime.
---
Craft ammo with the ammosmith 2* perk card. 
---
I get it for a bloodied build 
---
Where can you get marine under armor at?
---
You must have awful luck. 99.99 percent of encounters I have had have been positive. 
---
What the devs really had in mind: we already have code for skyrim dragons, throw it in and call it content
---
That doesn't work as intended, at least not for me. In my experience moving the CAMP device has had no discernable effect on the spawn point for me or teammates. The spawn point that teammates get it the exact spot and direction I was standing when I originally placed the CAMP device at this location, Unfortunately, this was at the point of a cliff and I had to add a door for teammates to enter the CAMP from the cliff edge. I typically spawn under a wall of the CAMP, that results in either getting stuck, being pushed off the cliff by the CAMP or appearing next to the CAMP barely on the cliff - the result differs each time. Often I need to travel to my CAMP twice, the first lands just off the cliff, then the second time brings me on to the cliff next to the CAMP.
---
5k
---
Seriously, Chrome Minigun bit no Chrome Power Armor? What about skins for all the other armor/weapons. Give me more choices than I can take!
---
For sure.  Unfortunately, I need a few turrets to take care of the annoying super mutants that keep trampling my crops and the commie robots from the nearby substation. XD
---
No worries. Are serum plans ever sold by vendors, or just SBQ drops?
---
You don’t want pity but piss and moan on Reddit, ok buddy. As for getting a response from Bethesda, if they haven’t addressed or responded to actual problems in the game what makes you think they’ll response to you’re low tier and quite honestly negotiable problems.
---
Ooo yeah, the game would be so much better without having to stock up ammo, stimps. If we are already removing the grind, lets then also remove legendary items and their sources, because they are grind too.
---
To protect freedom 
---
You can try scanning the files to repair them. It's a little button in the top right corner of the launcher next to the play button. I used to have missing textures in the atom shop and for bushes and this fixed it.
---
A moron who never bought 76 :D enjoy your "game"!
---
What about outside of power Armor because then I have less DR out of power armor 
---
That is a good point.  Especially when you had been enjoying a nuke zone!
---
The one in the Sons of Dane clubhouse plays rockabilly.
---
this really fucked my shit up while playing the mission at sugar grove. the last assaultron dominator killed me like eight times! plus, sometimes when I die to an ass-beam when I respawn my game looks deep fried. super ugly and hard to see stuff, it's weird. it only goes away when I relog.
---
Stash needs to be increased to 1000 for sure (I expect this within the next 2 patch, as when they increases it from 400 to 600 they said it was a very conservative change).
---
CAMP budget needs to be increased as well for general uses. Without defense I capped it quickly and I only wanted to do a nice layout :(
---
I like to think of them in terms of the monkeys writing Shakespeare. Given enough time it will happen eventually. Whether humanity will still be around to enjoy it is debatable.
---
I havent spent any atoms because I dont really like any of the stuff they have sold but if they add weapon skins or camos I would most likely buy them if they looked decent
---
I like that but 
---
Typically when I’m at that stage of needing help
---
I get 2 options
---
Ask for help spacebar only or
---
Respawn
---
Can you use flare gun at that point ?
---
Please advise
---
Yes and this is why I refuse to use them.  
---
Same I have the recipe but not the mats. Sbq won't die;-(
---
I’m about to go to a build like this simply because I’d like to go no turrets, they are basically useless anyways. 
---
This is good to know, thanks.
---
Jokes on them if they're farming for stuff to use Uranium Fever only gives max lvl 40 items so take comfort in the fact they're wasting their time if they're looking for useable gear.
---
Just message them to remind them that and they'll probably leave and not come back lol. Or message them asking them not to be dicks but real top players know Uranium Fever isn't that good if you're looking for tradeable legendaries
---
Still good for shotty shells tho, and black titanium scraps
---
In the enclave bunker occasionally, but from what I've seen they're 18k each. I traded for all of mine on reddit since I've killed the queen easily 40 times and not gotten a single one. Paid at least 4k for each of them, so lots of trading lol
---
Yeah definitely or I have seen suggestion about containers separate to you stash which can have locks put on them and be looted much like extractors
---
True, true, but It makes it easier in my mind to do what I do if I convince myself they are a cheater lol
---
I guess it doesn’t really matter. I’ve found multiple explosive weapons myself so he could legit... he stil got eated up tho
---
Didn’t you post this a day or so ago?
---
The super rolls for melee would probably be:
---
Instigating + Swing Speed + Strength (for 2 handed, one hits most enemies)
---
Bloody + Swing Speed + Strength (for low health builds and queens)
---
Furious + Swing Speed + Strength (for queens)
---
I think I've seen Swing Speed and Power Attack Damage, but you'll run out of AP after about 6 power attacks.  Strength adds damage to all hits, normal and power attack.
---
Most of my melee 2 handers I have reduced weight instead of increased strength for the last stat.  FML they're heavy....lol
---
The biggest takeaway from this was the insight into the SB landing programming.
---
Yep, I’m a spare dropper. I generally try to fast travel NEAR someone though, I don’t want them to vanish.
---
Everyone else got the reward before you did. 
---
I dont care what people say: My observations are loot inside of nuke zones is NOT instances to players that hit the mob its shared between all of them. 
---
The one time i was next to the queen when she died i made off with a plan and also multiple loot drops from her corpse. 
---
I'm trying to get my money back for this game, on XB1. can anyone share some advise?
---
Agreed, def not worth the budget space they take up
---
Almost as good as a Skyrim mod.
---
Fuck the camp.  I don't understand putting time, effort and resources into a camp.  It's just a place to go dump your junk and repair stuff.  It needs work benches, a stash box, and some turrets. 
---
The signs and letters don't do shit as far as crafting and have zero defense value.  Why the hell would anyone pay 5 caps for that, let alone 11,000?
---
Cool, I'll see if I can get on about then. (like 8pm EST?) I'll try to get some play time in-between now and then and we'll see if we can get anything done. I do have a mic, and I'm also on PC.
---
Enforcer(agility) + Skeet Shooter(perception) + vats a wing when it passes= Dragonrend.  
---
Even without skeet shooter, low perception builds with a level 5 pump can down a Scorchbeast.
---
Then?  When then you throw on your parachute pants and 'Hammertime' that bitch in the teeth.
---
Ya rad sponge ruins my bloody/unyielding/adrenal. On top of that, having to mass invite with this trashy UI and stay close to my team all the time is flat out a non starter (IMO).
---
You can see an easily accessible rock that people can use to cross that creek lol props for creativity tho
---
Are they multitime use? How can you afford to sell them for 300
---
Good advice brother!
---
I do XD
---
You're optimistic
---
7 faction vendors, 200 caps per day, per vendor 1400 caps a day from selling crap
---
Unlike these fan boys I agree this game is fever trash and I hope they do better next time because a lot of people didn’t buy this game and refuse to 
---
My melee game changed when I got All Rise.  I over-repaired it and have 3* adrenalin.  I feel so OP right now.  I lapped Whitesprings a few times slaughtering ferals with 1-2 hits, ended up with a swag of legendaries, then I got bored and went back to surviving the wasteland.
---
I was thinking scorchbeast based. Cuz otherwise players could just spam it and the beast would never take off. 
---
Devs, please respond to this for the lulz :P you know what to do xD
---
I'm willing to give it a chance, but unfortunately I can't sell it since it was a digital download on PC. Also, I've already played RDR2 for a while, just never played RD: Online
---
Me, too! I placed my most recent CAMP on the cliffs overlooking the Wilcox Farm; 100% of the time I have to FT to my CAMP twice, because the first time I spawn on a tiny ledge halfway down the cliff side--no way to climb up, and jumping down = instant death. 
---
That may be the issue but I had no problem installing power armour mods on even though I don't have the perk for power armour mods 
---
Its a fucking video game. Randoms can and will do what ever the fuck they want. 
---
Damage is irrelevant to enforcer...  level 5 pump and you are good to go.  If you need a bump calm ex can give a serious jumpt accuracy.  Does anyone even read the descriptions of items anymore?
---
Yup.  Very annoying.  I hate when I plunk down caps for a workshop build all the crap there and as soon as I finish and am ready to play more I will fast travel to some event like Uranium Fever and game crashes.
---
Considering me buying the game and playing it pays there bills at home and 
---
Yeah and the brick walls look great on the outside and terrible inside. That would help a ton!
---
Damn, that's legit. Nice work!
---
What else would you call a game that supports more players than just what's on your team, and has a shared world that isn't instanced?
---
I think people should start using the flare gun more often, i dont know wher ei got the plans but i can make it and the flares 
---
Jesus. 5000? What kind of shit do you need?
---
Just move it away from the golf club there's nothing wrong with a base at ehitepsrings , im talking about people who build right next to the golf club to farm loot 
---
fwiw, pretty sure explosive is implemented as a projectile replacement.
---
There's a lot more important things happening in the world right now and you're whining about a game that no one is making you play or buy 🤷‍♂️🗑️
---
I feel like if they have that beam, thru shouldn't be able to use it from stealth. And once they use it, they should have a momentary energy drain where they cannot go invisible, use the attack again, nor use a power attack. They are easily worse to fight than a sentrybot. 
---
I would be willing to spend ATOMS for a basic color palette. 
---
Anything is more acceptable than that splotchy metal they posted yesterday.
---
I didn't even know there was a new years event until I read about it the day after.
---
Yes, left 30 fusion cores there today
---
Don’t forget Super Duper for that added benefit 
---
I think there's an end to the enemy mobs.
---
You can also just run out of the mine.  The mission doesn't require that you kill the mobs.
---
You got 25k? I only got 100. Also don’t play the game so that might also be why.
---
Yep, I can relate to that. Whenever one of my alts reaches the Enclave quest where you need to kill 10 legendaries, I start server hopping for Uranium Fever or the Leader of the Pack. And 7 out of 10 times there's some asshat 1-shotting.
---
Having said that, when you eventually get to be the guy with the explosive shotgun or the 1-shot punch melee build, it's *really* hard to NOT become an asshat and start 1-shotting them too. 
---
It's one of the reasons I really like the Tesla rifle, and many of my chars carry one, even at the cost of its obscene weight. As long as you're quick enough to manually squeeze off a shot in the mob's general direction, even if you miss, the electricity arc jump will often tag it anyway. Usually works to beat the 1-shot VATS users before they get a bead and 1-shot it.
---
They're like any other recipe or plan. Once you learn them, you can craft them at the chemistry bench. I sell them cheap because I don't like ripping people off, plus it gets me way mo caps mo fastah. I can max out at 25k in a couple hours after a few well timed reddit post. The real grind is sourcing all the materials, but you can buy most of those on reddit too lol
---
very cosy
---
There was a lvl165 in there with us last night. Was annoying everyone. 
---
Kwanza is not a minor holiday, thank you very much.
---
I don’t mind the inside of brick walls too much, the dirty gray makes me feel like I’m in the apocalypse. But in general I’m not a fan of a giant brick building, doesn’t allow contrasting very well with the surrounding light.
---
if you used a controller you might disagree :)  LOL
---
The favorites wheel is a nightmare.  D pad up, then use stick to navigate, click a to select...but half the time it unselects the item you highlighted and chooses something else.  if you try to use the d pad to navigate the favorites it pulls up emotes or stimpacks you instead.  LOL.  
---
I keep a level 30 sloth....better than any turret.  Although players are morons and think sloth.  Must murder! Not realizing that sloth spawns on golf course is not a thing
---
Yea, I always forget if it was 6 faction or 7.
---
Seriously I need this. I destroyed mine last night cause I was sick of the classical. It doesn't fit FO76 at all.
---
You also get more scrap if you have higher Intelligence apparently. I haven't tested or seen much info on it but someone said the difference between having 1 Int and 15 Int when scrapping a level 1 pistol was from 8 caps worth to around 85 caps. Maybe Intelligence level affects how good the card works. I don't know though. I have relatively high Intelligence I think around 11, but could get it higher if I needed to with a few items and chems. It would be good to know some hard data.
---
To me it doesn’t qualify as “massive” so i d just call it a multiplayer game.
---
Yeah as long as there's no turrets your good, just watch out because some people will still destroy it and your gonna have to rebuild every time it gets nuked , so stay safe. 👍
---
Long story short the strange in numbers perk cards is bugged. It usually happens to me when a team member or two leaves, or if I drop team myself. There are 3 ways to "fix" the issue.
---
1) server hop
---
2) team up again
---
3) unequip the card when not in a team.
---
I also find that my mutations buy out while waiting for some to accept my team invite 
---
Right? I always worry that I won't have enough wood to cook food, until I go to cook food and see that I've got like 1000 wood scraps despite never ever interacting with a wood pile.
---
Scrapping weapons the junk really starts to add up.
---
I solo'd and sniped the entirety of the mine. Take it slow and steady and you'll be fine.
---
I believe they respawn if someone joins the mine after you. Otherwise, no. When you kill 'em, they stay dead.
---
And yeah, when all the enemies are dead, there's nothing preventing you from fast-traveling out unless you're over-encumbered.
---
Canadian shop lingo.
---
Correct. It doesn’t arc. I haven’t affixed a shotgun barrel yet. That is on my things to do list. 
---
There was a random whitespring event where the lvl 18x was hosting, 
---
It was cool all the lowbies stood to 1 side and he brought them out into the parking lot for us to mug. Repeatedly as they respawn.
---
The folks pretty much did as he asked self policed themselves and everyone got legendary gear in a timely military manner lolz
---
lvld 4x in 10m. If it wasn’t for the rad dmg I’d have stayed longer.
---
I think he was amazed at how everyone was willing to help. He even mentioned he had the whole server at whitspring and this was the largest group he’s ever done 
---
It was cool.
---
in the event something stupid like a duplication exploit came out a cap limit limits the amount of caps that could theoretically come out.
---
??? what the fuck, how did you get that idea from that?  
---
One gives a max out of 350-400 static if you're in a team with the right mutations. 500 with chems. 
---
The rest is stacking ALL abilities for below 20% HP.
---
These abilities largely also work on TSE weapons.
---
Which boost the damage even further. 
---
Without exploiting this, TSE weapons are bugged to fuck, smashing out thousands per hit with a standard perk setup. 
---
This is from any range. This is not including any additional chems or strategies (strategies which are not possible in melee) 
---
So your argument is that because, exploiting clearly broken mechanics, melee weapons can come close to the effectiveness of TSE weapons which are not exploiting it.
---
Making no mention of when TSE weapons DO exploit these mechanics and reach 200k dmg per hit. In short, you're lying becuase you spent money on a TSE weapon.   
---
Bitch bitch bitch... trying being a stealth sniper when most events/missions lock you out of stealth.  Don't see us bitching about not being able to use 15 of our special points.  We pop a medx, drink some water, and drive the fuck on.
---
So I should ditch tank killer for something else. Well that sucks :(
---
I must be the only person who has barely seen any since that update a few weeks back?? Damn this place is Whine Fest 2019 lol
---
It's almost as if end-game enemies of an online RPG should drop meaningful loot so there's a reason to kill them in the first place...
---
Ah.. you might be right with that.... yeat too bad then. I would love to have it in the camp as well.
---

What power armor paint were they using?
---
Batarang!
---
Rocks are for the peasants. My place has *class.*
---
You dont need turrents when you build at whitesprings, building turrents just fucks up the spawn for literally everyone else there. The robots are pretty much the only protection you need. 
---
Until fresh content comes out (shouldn't be too long now) once you finish the main questlines there's not much to do except farm nuke zones, go around doing events, or finish exploring the different locations you missed. Besides that you work on your house like in Minecraft. Of course I never played Minecraft but this feels accurate right now
---
Blowing stuff up is fun for sure but half the time people didn't get a bounty from doing something malicious. More than likely they accidentally attacked a player owned workshop item or something. That seems to be a large majority of the bounties people have.
---
Keep starched genes on when you use a serum! It definitely works. I had the same thought as you before and I took off starched genes in the enclave bunker to use a serum. But in that short time I gained two mutations instead of 1 and the other one was sub-optimal. I had to roll the dice using a radaway and got super lucky when it removed the right mutation. 
---
Not turning on Pacifist Mode at Whitespring and dragging me into PvP. 
---
none-legendary tesla is better than explosive tesla.
---
are those onions? WTF man WHY
---
Iron Within, Iron Without!
---
Damn, thats a shame. An exploding arc would make you feel like a proper thunder god
---
Don’t see why they don’t just put something in the atom shop yet.
---
Recent servers disconnects happen far too often, it would be too easy to just say its dupers but we don't know, five guys got disconnected/froze in an hour, myself included twice in 15minutes during the third SBQ fight on a server. 
---
We have no incentive to hold the power plant/resource extractors, some of still do out of habit but doesn't reward you like it used to, everything feels "disposable". 
---
The game is turning into a "pay to win" we've seen players lvl120 struggling with the queen but the lvl60 that bought the serums/tse/bobbleheads will steam roll it every time(dmg stack exploit). The only reason we found out was because they bragged about it, Its no longer a looter/survival game that it once was. You don't have to be smart/good/lucky when you can just buy all the gear and exploit your way to the top.
---
Where did you all think those fusion cells were going?
---
The Assaultron's have been saving them up to wreck you a--!!!
---
Seriously, it is bugged and probably similar to the SB Sonic attack.
---
 I got the plans for the arms, I read them and they dont show up in my crafting menu
---
I really like the idea of benefits only unmutated players can use. Makes it a clear choice.
---
I did Heavy Gunner with my first character but I was focusing on Miniguns since I heard so many horror stories about the shit durability of Gatling Plasma's.
---
I deleted that character and re-rolled after realizing it takes about 5000 rounds to kill a Scorchbeast with a Minigun.
---
No.  I would be cool with that too.  I actually don't see them a lot at the camps I find.  
---
I feel like you miss the point of it being annoying.   So Everytime a scorchbeast flies over my camp or whatever you want me to pop a calmex, swap my perk cards out to perks that are generally useless to melee builds and blow through shotgun ammo.    Sounds fun.  And I bet you switch out all your ranged perks and read a melee buff magazine every time a deathclaw comes to melee you?  Lol
---
This is good praxis comrades.
---
I swear that one has to be a typo in their DB. Whoever added the plans/prices to their system, had to have hit an extra 0 by accident and like many things, hasn't been corrected yet.
---
Water and plants I care about have locks.  There are also some outside that are free for visitors.
---
Bring grenades/mines for the last little rush/big group maybe? I remember doing this at a fairly low level and it was a lot but I got through it. I was able to melee part of it without any melee perks when I ran out of ammo and did ok. I did it with almost 0 prep
---
I would think a good idea wood to have basic ones to start with, you can buy colored ones and different textures at vendors but have unique, pristine walls in the atom shop. Even those metal walls with holes in it wouldn’t be so bad to use if we could have interior walls.
---
I got disconnected after spending all my resources to take a workshop, build extractors and generators, build defense turrets. I then quickly learned that you get none of these resources back. 
---
Been four days and I havnt been able to bring myself to log back in. 
---
I know the resources themselves are not a big deal, I'm only level 10 and I had gathered them already. But I had been scrimping and saving them, and losing them in that way is a bad taste. 
---
I am mostly at the limit of the nuke zone, my camp has never been destroyed by a nuke, only by players.. 
---
I actually know one guy that has one in his CAMP. He built it during beta, and it never got erased.
---
Lol - that is an understatement! It's actually kindof sad watching expert base builders on YouTube who are like artists deprived of paints and brushes. Plus now that the glitches don't work and the mods like place-anywhere aren't available, it's hard to be creative. My level 77 character is still missing half the good stuff and I buy whatever plans I can find. Forget about the 11000 cap light set...
---
I hit the button and ran the F to the top of the ramp to that room as quickly as my AP would refill, crouched, and as soon as I was [hidden] I fast traveled out of there.
---
Eventually he'll realize all of those sweet legendaries are lvl 35/40 and nobody will want them so it's just vendor inventory haha. It's good when you're just gearing up at 50 but not so good after. Good way to kill ten minutes
---
players who build the camp get the loot off the meat pile regardless of if they helped kill it. 
---
i’ve literally picked up hundreds of legendaries over the last week from my turrets getting kills while i was standing on my base doing nothing so again, your wrong.
---
Not at all friend! Just be mindful of when the minions are spawned and out. If they are out open fire! If you don't see around then she is about to drop.
---
When I see a Scorchbeast without minions, I shoot it a few times and if nothing spawns then I move on.
---
I mean if we could get rid of RNG legendary's and replace them with legendary's as quest rewards, I'd like that. 
---
&gt;Lewis Gun
---
it's not a combination of any of those. It's an FG42 crossed with what is most likely a Maxim Machine Gun

Please explain your wizardry..... 
---
The bigger concern is that the stupid robot likes to wander or disappear. My bro has to do it twice cause the robo took off and he couldn't turn it in.
---
Step 1: Sell your stuff to vendors, 7 factions each has a vendor that has 200 caps per day for you.
---
Step 2: Set a reminder to go off in 20 hours and 1 minute. 
---
Step 3: Go to Step 1
---
Isn’t raider leathers the same thing?
---
Sounds good! Price?
---
Thanks CaptLeops!
---
3 scorchedbeast queens. 3 times in a row to get explosive vents. 
---
Ok. Ty for that post. Been wandering this factory for 30 mins now.
---
I don't think the constantly respawn so once you kill the last of them you should be fine. You are given a weapon at some point during this mission which helps against scorched so make use of it. 
---
It would be possible in theory to fast travel out the mine since fast travel is allowed from inside areas. However your friend may have gotten lucky as you can't fast travel when enemies are near. 
---
I didn't find this mission that bad in all honesty. I did strike lucky in so far as going in was easy as someone else was doing mission so there was barely any enemies until I pressed the button. But after that I basically just hot footed it out of there (ok, ok, that was bound to happen anyway given the state of the mine lol). 
---
I like the 25,000 limit.  It limits in-game inflation in the trading reddits.
---
Most deals are either for caps, or item for item.
---
If you're trying to get a deal done for more than 25,000 caps, it's currently a pain in the ass to do so.  BOTH players have to have alts (yours for GIVING more than 25,000 caps, and his for being able to TAKE more than 25,000 caps).
---
With that pain induced, most players don't do trades that are over 20,000 caps.
---
HINT:  **If you're approaching the 25,000 cap limit..............go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar and spend some of those caps!**  There are cool unique outfits, upgraded underarmor, mutation serums, power armor, rare plans, etc there.  Players are trading things for caps pretty much 24/7 there.  I like to get my caps up to about 20,000 then go find some cool things to buy :)
---
I like putting together a sort of 'low level care package'. All the stuff i was struggling to keep in stock when i was starting out.
---
Few stim packs. Some purified water. A random food item. A disease cure. Maybe some ammo for the gun theyre carrying.
---
That would still be super cool I think. 
---
Broke ass ninja
---
Yeah, it's very easy to know which region you are in already, this is not needed.
---
Did that a few nights ago and by the end of the third fight, the lag and stutter was horrific.
---
BROKE ass ninja
---
Nuke 1 - Draws all the people into area, irradiates everything.  
---
Nuke 2 - Nukes all those legendary stealing hazmat suit mooches, also HILARIOUS  (I'm in this category,the mooches, no shade here)
---
Nuke 3 - Reset the legendary spawns, go clean up with your team.
---
i think @OP meant "functional" not "cosmetic" 
---
I'm seriously considering deleting mine too lol. I like the look of it, but the music selection is less than ideal... xD
---
I did not spend any money on anything in the game. That great leap and bound type of logic.
---
A TSE Weapon without the Demolitionist perk like the Handmade is only 200 and something dps. Secondly guns have massive drop of damage at range. 
---
The fact perks and exploits of bobblehead and magazines prove the guns there selves are not Overpowered.
---
Your speaking of perks and exploits of the bobbleheads and magazines. That has nothing to do with TSE base damage and the fact they are not over powered. I’m not built at all for Melee weapons. And my base melee Weapons I do have hit for over 200 with no melee perks. Your argument is invalid and only fixated on TSE.
---
If giving people a taste of their own medicine makes me one then I guess so bud.
---
gibberish fantasy 
---
:D I am totally broke hahah
---
no? My house is sweet. I do want to put things on my shelves and stuff though.
---
It may be part of another plan. Once I am done all the module on http://centralfallout.com and I have it up and running I will be going through this list working of a complete list of plans with images of exactly when you get etc
---
I don't get why we can't have revolvers in anything but .44
---
Surely not every revolver in Appalachia was converted to .44 before the bombs dropped, if New Vegas can have several types then why not 4 or 76? If revolvers could use .45 (I know we have pipe but still) and .38 then it would be much better, since revolvers could normally use different rounds.
---
First world problems.
---
I apologize if I were unclear, but I thank you for the analogy. If I were to say as such, I don't quite have a house yet. I've progressed through the game to the point where you're at a small group of buildings with a robot and several missions that involve running around and then turning them in. I've only gotten to play for about 2 hours and I've not really explored much so I "missed" about 90% of the map. I can't go off and get supplies for my base or build it up really since (if I remember correctly) I only have 2 guns and a machete. I'm looking for a reason to play what people say is Fallout 4 with NO NPC's, No mods, and several problems. I'm sure that, as it is with many games, after a few hours and getting into a pattern, I would find it interesting and would be willing to farm area's for single items. Hell, I spent around 7 Hours farming 30 Proof of Concord Kept in DS3, on more than one Character. I'm just thinking that it'd be better with friends, and while I have friends, not a one owns this game.
---
Xbox?
---
Relax. Take a Chillex.
---
They said they would post their Inside the Vault today.
---
Dang, you beat me too it
---
They're my new favorite things to build with.  In my current base I have them as the majority of my walls.  So if it's a nice day I can open them and enjoy it all.  A little bummed I never used them in Fallout 4.
---
This and stop the queuing. 
---
nonsense. they are fun. 
---
I don't mind the inside of the brick walls in all honesty. A few pictures up and I'm good with it. However it would be easier if they also had plain interior walls so you don't have a room with one brick wall (although with a little clever building I just make them into a feature wall!).
---
Excellent, I'm glad you found what you were looking for. I'm always happy to help a fellow player. :)
---
Also just an FYI, BoS paint on Combat Armor is currently well sought after because it gives a huge boost to DR/ER.
---
Nah. PC.
---
2 shot (non explosive) is significantly better for the Tesla. Chain twice as much lightning!
---
Wow man y’all mother fuckers are toxic. This man stated he was in passive and like 8 of you cucks brought it up as a reason with your mightier than thou attitude. Why don’t you read the post instead of interjecting your own shit opinion that has nothing to do with anything
---
Maybe some mad max trucks would be pretty cool
---
And drop them so the edge of the blast is just a tiny hair below drop site v9, so you dont have to deal with radiation. The queen will still come to you outside the blast zone. 
---
like anybody gives a shit about your worthless advice 
---
i dunno, the servers might go down later so the updates can be applied 
---
Dang I’ve got loads of nuka grape I want to get rid of
---
We need to have the welcome mat back I have my camp on a cliff side and I have to go around the cliff to get to my camp. 
---
On the other hand, for a player like myself that craves their delicious heart, brain and liver, they can be quite rewarding.
---
You haven't lived until your ammo workshop gets jumped by 3 at once. It's completely ridiculous.
---
Look at it this way. Melee weapons are part of the game. They're not an afterthought, their inclusion was a concious decision.
---
Imagine if there were a powerful semi-common enemy who was immune to projectile weapons? Immune to everything but melee? How fun would that be for gun users?
---
Imagine if robobrains had a shield making them immune to projectile weapons, only energy weapons and melee could harm them. Would that annoy you?
---
Damn synths have made their way to Appalachia 
---
In the beta I built a base on the edge of a cliff, with a welcome mat at my front door. Without a welcome mat it just spawns me at the bottom of the cliff :c
---
BSOD usually means your OS has become unstable.  One of the most common things could be a recent driver installation.  
---
You can do it more than 3 times in a server me and my also were able to get the server to handle 7nukes after one nuke goes we launch another then another then when allowed another again
---
Yeah well it’s almost tomorrow in Australia!!!!!!!!!11111one
---
I recently turned 30, and I'm a quiet and reserved but usually pleasant and approachable (in my opinion) gent, and I'm on for large spans of time most days, as I'm single and have no life. I'm in Australia, so I'll ping you a message when I get home and you can feel free to reply. Sometimes you'll see me in a party with my two bogan mates, but not often (both wifed up with kids), and you're free to join but our language is pretty colourful and can get less than pc. 
---
I have an explosive tesla rifle, if you use shotgun barrel, it works as an explosive shotgun.
---
Also, damages are good, i would say somehow balanced, but i don't know why it differs so much from an explosive shotgun (tesla is good, shotgun is godlike when speaking about explosives, that's what i mean).
---
If you're being hit by something invisible just spin in a circle swinging and you will land some hits and see the XP chaching.
---
That's weird then. My brother had one during the beta and doesn't now. He was getting kind of annoyed with me that I couldn't find one, then when he went back to check he didn't have one to place either. 
---
I hope for your friend's sake he gets to keep it!
---
1997 game?
---
ps: I love FO76
---
Pretty much. I started out all guns and got a really good deathclaw gauntlet after level 50. After doing a lot of respec, I'm 99% unarmed melee now. If it wasn't for scorchbeasts, I wouldn't have to carry around a 17lb rifle anymore.
---
sorry, but thats not something (i think) most people want; furthermore, BGS certainly wont do this. it'll destroy there game base.
---
Nicely done.
---
I may or may not be guilty of this lol
---
I just got crit.
---
What do you have for it? I didn't realize it was such a rare thing. I also found the helmet piece as well. I don't remember if I purchased it. 
---
Thank you nice to see someone understands.
---
or elitist!
---
Don't hate the player, hate the game!
---
Eating or slurping food down the MIC, massive no no, same as screaming at kids / pets / other halves etc.
---
Common courtesy suggests mute that shit no one else wants to hear it. 
---
Stealing from group members n all, ok a laugh and a joke to wind them up a bit can be fun but don't give that shit back and you not getting re invited to our groups again and well prob farm the crap out of you or nuke your base a few times.
---
Well Bethesda main studio is on the East coast of US. So be patient.
---
Damn. Been scratching my head for an hour trying to figure this out. Thanks for the post.
---
For which plans Handmade 1000 Caps and Lever 1200 Caps.
---
There will be an article today that will give a timeline for the next updates. 
---
You ok dude? 
---
I save people’s lives for a living. A real life responder. Have you ever used direct laryngoscope and magill forceps to remove a grape from a child’s trachea then restarted the child’s heart and handed her back to her mother who thought all was lost? Have you ever pulled someone out of a burning garbage truck missing his legs, place combat tourniquets, endotracheal intubate him so he can breath in the middle of the street, place large bore IVs to keep him alive, and then meet him months later for a hug and to see him walk with prosthetics? I could do this all day. You have absolutely no idea what you are saying you lol
---
This a a videogame my dude 😀 just having some fun
---
I could play your game and say that maybe “IRL” you are a skinny fat yellow toothed pretentious limey who is so fucked up mentally you think you could actually characterize a person’s whole life off a post in a videogame forum.
---
Better not let me find yo ass in Harpers Ferry 🤪

Something about radio synchronization. If you place two radios next to each other they would eventually play songs out of sync. I don’t think  that’s severe enough to get them cut, but that’s just me.
---
True

Haha! Thanks anyway! Much appreciated :P I am sure some XBox players would be super happy!

yeah that was fun, I built an opera house while waiting for the mining to occur, it came out nice, other than I only had a banjo, drums, steel and reg guitars and some nice potted plants. on stage,
---
It's already 11:43! Where's the next complaint about the lack of updates!
---
Holidays. Then regrouping after the holidays. Then confirming the patches do what they're supposed to. There's an entire process here. It's not like it's a single dude fixing a 14MB program or anything.
---
All the Scorched were cleared out before the event, but man, those Super Mutants just swarmed in!

She was just unlucky. If she's on X box I'll make her a welcome package.

---
I doubt the updates are earth shattering anyway. just slow fixes.
---
So Egghead is not a true Scotsman?
---
Since you're low level, don't worry about the main quest too much, the scaling isn't very good between zones and you'll end up fighting things a good bit above your status. I would suggest exploring all of the Forest first, lots of content and lore there, and you won't be overwhelmed
---
I find what alot of ppl haven't thought about is how these vault dlc is most likely not going to change the power curve.
---
Basucally this new content will provide no challenge and no upgrades for anyone with tse's.
---
TLDR: Wiping all the hard work unnecessary, people would quit. There are other ways.  
---
You follow the destiny/WOW model of making all items in the game effective to a point and then useless for new content.  
---
You do this by inflating values of new items/enemies or by nerfing all current values.    
---
Then your 2 shot explosive turns into a pea shooter against relevant enemies etc.
---
Or just give everything explosive resistance buffs.  
---
He was so cute before his face melted....
---
Life is hard buttercup...Seriously though if dying once to a much higher level player does anything but encourage you to level up so you can fight back then you didn't really want to play in the first place.

Shouldn’t you be more.... silenced?
---
Probably going to repost the 27th one again
---
You should watch ManyATrueNerd's lets play. He breaks harper's ferry with just the scenery and without any real effort. bethesda put junk to close to the fence XD.
---
I agree.  My camp is tucked away on a narrow cliff ledge.  Half the time I spawn on a ledge one lower than my camp and have to fast travel again, spawning behind my camp (but at least not in the cliff face).  Would love if I could just place a fast travel mat and not have this issue.
---
Yeah I know at the last Raid, same at the third fight and my game breaks multiple times down :(
---
Hoped for an act of god,  got an act of God-Emperor instead lol.
---
Exactly. 
---
this is fallout 76
---
Console by chance?
---
My personal (and completely batshit crazy) theory is that the limit is there because we're in alpha testing right now. What they called release was actually early access, and we're just starting alpha now. Actual release is 2-4 years down the line.
---
This means, we're capped on storage, on caps, and they don't much care about duping items, because all of them will be made obsolete once gear and weapons begin scaling past lvl 45-50. 
---
Also, there's no barter system in the game. You can trade items for caps, but you can't (afaik?) trade items for items. Which is what barder is. If they wanted us to barter, they would have given us a barter system. Clearly, they don't want barter, they want us to use caps, within a limit.
---
And you're also right that the situation is completely unsustainable, on many fronts. For one thing, items are not character-bound, which means every player needs one of each item, pretty much. One explosive shotgun, one TSE handmade, etc., etc. Between drops and duping, *eventually* we will all have these. And once we do, there's nothing else *to do*, we're done. Gear and weapons need periodic repair, but they are never destroyed, which means the demand is going to be finite. Eventually, demand will stop, and supply will continue, and prices will drop to nothing, as storage is limited.
---
Same problem will eventually happen with the current "respec" system. Currently, we can respec 1 point, every level, past lvl 50. What's the level cap? 999? 9999? 99999? Based on UI, it should have been lvl 99, since levels beyond that don't even get displayed properly. Either way, *eventually* we will hit the level cap. Which will disable the ability to respec points. And so on, and so forth. It really feels sometimes the devs didn't think very far ahead. Which is expecially evident with the Y2K bug we had last week, where they forgot to account for the year change, so they literally didn't even think 2 months ahead.
---
They have given us several updates already this month. There is another due to be announced today. Not sure if you are following their twitter feed or website....
---
Thanks, if it happened to one of my boys theyd be like, ima hunt that sucker down, lol...I did hear her say to my wife last night shes making a “hit list” with names for later lol
---
I’ve tried that a few times but the Queen always seemed to get a no damage bug. 
---
You are correct sir, my favorite ( and only MMO) is ESO, I won’t even play without the $15 a month Plus because..... well..... the fucking craft bag is too fucking awesome. But when I’m pvping and get unending load screens and dc to were I’m only playing 10 minutes out of an hour I’ll cancel and go play something else for a month or two.

Yep Green Thumb equipped I can craft any flora I get and the rest is gifted/sold.  At Whitesprings I can easily pick 500+.  17 go for 192 Caps for my character.  So its easy to see I have lots more than I need.  Definetely try it.
---
I knew you could lock water. I did not know you could lock plants
---
It does?! Oh man. Time for a field trip!
---
This entire sub is people begging for changes in the game. Spoiler alert- non of them will happen
---
Baby Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back reference maybe?
---
WAAAAAARGH
---
Really? Thats strange. Ive dropped at least 6 that way. Attended at least a dozen more that were dropped that way. The only problem ive had was she flew off once like 15 mins before the timer was up. That was just once though. 
---
You can still be killed in pacifist mode, but like i said she was only level 5 for two minutes and I was teaching her about the game, didn’t think i had to worry about this at such a low level
---
while you're waiting, just **dream** of the great bug fixes and Dup fixes and DLC that they are going to drop on us... ;)
---
It's quite far from the main building but i still found it completely destroyed a few days ago :(
---
Thank you. Here is a video I made this morning on how to set it up.https://youtu.be/KH4nlTLVek4
---
Ok cool I found some t51 but it's fucked
---
Yeah, you can...so 
---
Lol yeah I know must of posted at the wrong time of the day. Anyway like someone said must of been a bad 76 day for me.
---
In the future?
---
Or how bout the blue “coolers” actually did there job.
---
That would never happen. The devs planned for that and scrubbed their code throughly 
---
I guess vault 76 paint fits at least a little bit. 
---
It makes that cool noise when you equip it too. 
---
but aren't all the values associated with legionaries randomly generated along with the attributes   
---
&gt;Also, there's no barter system in the game. You can trade items for caps, but you can't (afaik?) trade items for items. Which is what barder is. If they wanted us to barter, they would have given us a barter system. Clearly, they don't want barter, they want us to use caps, within a limit.
---
I know a lot of people that barter for items. They just drop them on the ground instead of using the trade system. It requires a lot of trust, but then again there are "Raiders".
---
Yeah of all the dupers, our accounts will never get purged, they would lose there player base over night, it's never going to happen. 
---
Just remove every TSE weapon in the game and ban any account over the 600 limit permanently .. done ..
---
Besides why should legit players be punished because of cheaters.
---
Yeah it’s weird, I just drop them the old fashion way now
---
I know that NOW. :D  
---
I had NO idea it was going to be that crazy with SMs. Next playthrough with friends I may just stand back and watch them shit their pants.
---
I wonder...you said it can interrupt the landing animation.
---
If they're already on the ground can it prevent them from taking off again?
---
That only makes sense if you're talking about ancillary additional content - something like the faction system I described, which isn't core to the gameplay. The problem is that many obvious core systems are broken or missing, and the content isn't there either. Never chalk up to malice what could be caused by incompetence. 
---
I think it's also a bit too optimistic to say that they've got great finished content in the wings that they're holding back on when what we got is shallow and buggy as hell. Releasing a half-finished game, enduring an absolutely toxic backlash that poisons the well for future releases, then dropping improvements is not a sound business plan. 
---
full paint cans are one of my biggest pet peeves.
---

Itll come back in the atom shop
---
Just build a greenhouse &amp; lock the door.
---
Cool! Sent you a request. I will join your game around that time then!
---
I want a goldfish.
---
Thank you
---
Removing the duped weapons is definitely a priority for all of the legit-as-possible players. But not at the price of their time and effort. As others have said here and in previous iterations of this post, a plurality of players would quit if they suddenly lost everything, even with never knowingly cheating.
---
Finally off
---
I was also playing The Division day 1 (beta too). It was not at all worse than 76 has been. And the level of communication was about the same. I think you're misremembering. 
---
whatever I want. Jesus even in Rust other fucking lowkey games you can stash unlimited if you build boxes.2
---
any copper?
---
It also sucks when you build a nice walled settlement and then everyone fast travels right in the middle.  I spent a long tome trying to get a garage door to open only with terminal access and it didn’t even matter 
---
Bob: I will just change these lines here and make them download 34 gigs  again that should keep them entertained for a few hours...
---
Steve: Shouldn't we test it first?
---
Bob: They are going to complain about it anyway why bother.
---
I'd be too embarrassed when my savior arrived and said, "What the heck, you can't kill one of THOSE on your own!"
---
yeah I don't want it either but I have put 300 hours in my character I just don't see another alternative please elaborate on one.   
---
I ended up successfully defending two stations. I don't even know where the other two were located!
---
Got a few bulk there 
---
Seem's unlucky as for the most part people are pretty cool in game. 
---
Could have been a pre teen themselves though i guess or as you say a complete tool :/
---
Bethesda is to blame though as the game encourages PVP, its one of the main mechanics and a good way to get resources if your bored of farming for nodes etc.
---
PVE / PVP servers would help but Bethesda have a vision for the game and that vision includes raiders and pvp'ers and unfortunately asshats.
---
There has been constant communication on a regular basis. Not sure why you are so damn Whiney. 
---
Bye Felecia 
---
There you go, we've head several updates this month so shut your mouth. 
---
Pacifist does not prevent players from killing you it prevents you from damaging or targeting other players.  Slap damage is still there, so assholes that are persistent can still kill you.
---
You get a guaranteed legendary enemy, so yea kinda, if the level is right and they dont stuck somewhere.
---
While I do miss that aspect of New Vegas, it would probably take a long time to code that in here.  Making the barrel of the flare gun interchangeable like the syringer would be simpler.  The scorchbeast flare could either be a Scorched Killer mod or a prime receiver requiring flux, depending on how you want to balance it.  I would also like to see different colored flares (so each teammate could have a different one to call for help or mark an area), a "starburst" one that actually puts out a decent amount of light, and perhaps a lure, to draw nearby ghouls or animals to a specific point.
---
It was easy for me, but then again, I was in my 30's by then. Though my method could work for you. I tend to move through cautiously. I play a sniper build so most of the time, I pick them off from a distance, and sometimes I will wait if the game goes into caution mode - especially if there are multiple mobs, like 4 or more.
---
Can you snipe? Yes. I do exactly that. You will get mobbed  *IF* you keep shooting one after another, they will eventually figure out where you are shooting from. I personally like sniping. You'll do more damage with the Rifleman perks and also if you have covert operative among others. Regardless of perk cards, headshots do more damage. Leg shots can cripple and slow them down. I do however have melee ready if and when I get rushed which will happen. For example a Fire Axe if you want to role play Firebreather is nice for damage, but it's slow. Ski Sword is another option.
---
The scorched are Finite. They will not respawn when you're still in there but it is possible that they eventually will. I'm not sure on the respawn timer here.
---
If you're alone (not on server but in the area), I believe tit's mid teens to possibly 30.
---
Hitting the button finishes the quest, so yes fast travel out works.
---
Tips based on my own experience:
---
1 The scorched will search for you and if alerted can gang up fast. Playing hide and seek and sort of strafing from side to side or in circles can help you avoid incoming fire, I tend to use VATS in situations like this, after sniping if they catch on to me.
---
2. There are two ways down to the bottom, if you take the left branch from the start, you will be working your way down through some stairs towards the quest target, it's a tightly confined space and can turn into a fire fight if things go wrong. Use caution  going through this area as you move downstairs towards the end.
---
3. If you take the right branch from the start there's going to be some spots on fire that will cause damage but not much, following this eventually leads to the lower level but comes in from the other side of the quest area. You'll reach a spot that looks like a dead end, but it's not, you can go around and down and through an opening. Going this way can allow you to better sneak up on the scorched near the quest target.
---
4. If you're going the snipe route, do get a suppressor. It's a huge plus.
---
There are Black Titanium nodes and an Ultracite node here. Keep these in mind for later on, you'll need the Black Titanium when it's time to craft your Excavator Power Armor.
---
Careful saying you have a TSE weapon... you are likely to get witchhunted on here.
---
There's an "alien" where you get the blaster rounds too. And other bunkers I'd like to see opened there. 
---
I want an attack Possum 
---
I feel like they wouldn't fix it soon enough because of a glitch affecting minority of players. Plus, tons of annoying bugs are to be fixed already. Well, untill then, I've got something else to play.
---
Like that makes any difference.
---
Yikes. A player strolls up to nuked Whitesprings, players everywhere fighting ghouls. He casually charges up his tesla rifle, points it in the general direction of the ghouls, and fires.
---
The earth shakes. Every player within the blast zone staggers as if struck by five super mutant super sledges all at once, their cameras swinging wildly. Their vision is filled with bright blue to incandescent light, burning retinas and causing a few to vomit spontaneously. A few die as explosive weapons they tried to fire accidentally strike the ground next to them, or as dying ghoul corpses hurled by the unholy blast strike them.
---
**Meanwhile, at Amazon Web Services...**
---
Employees scramble back and forth. Red lights are on every screen and a klaxon in the background wails, while a manager stands in the middle of the chaos, hair wild from being pulled out, staring helplessly onwards. “We’re fucked...” he says, quietly in shock.
---
2 minutes later...
---
Where Whitesprings once stood, a vast field of half-rendered buildings and flickering plants now lies. Ghoul parts litter the landscape. Jerkily animated players, calling for help with stuttering voice chat channels stand about in varying degrees of being partially loaded. A naked man stuck in an unarmored power armor frame reaches a too-long arm out and gasps “fuck it...I’m logging out.”
---
The Tesla wielding stranger finishes looting the last bugged ghoul and curses. “Bolstering Wood Right Leg...again.” He logs out, blithely ignoring the devastation around him.
---
I think there is a lamp you can make.
---
Good to know! I'll go back and do the giant teapot defense thing again.
---
That’s hiking, how do you not get any benefits from hiking. You get both mental and physical benefits from exercise 
---
Playing a brand new game and being killed by another player is frustrating at any age. Jackass at level 26 needs to go find someone his own level and take the risk of losing. 
---
Yeah probably saying duper or something.
---
Oh nice! Is the TSE shotgun the only level 25 req item? 
---
I could definitely use that. Maybe some caps/stims or shells 
---
Up to you 
---
Thanks man! 
---
I wonder if you were seeing a bug. 
---
There have been a few times when a HORRENDOUSLY large number of mobs have spawned during events or at a location ... 
---
I have finished this event a few times and never had more Super Mutants show up then one player could handle.
---
Or just get class freak
---
And any other semi-auto. 1911-ish?
---
This. So much this. Updates to updates don’t count. They set a schedule and only announced an announcement date because they didn’t keep to it. Tuesday’s have been primary patch and news day every week since FO76 launched. 
---
Today is make or break for me. If the details aren’t detailed enough I’m gonna walk away and try to stop caring that they improve the game I play more than any other and just check back in a few months. 
---
Yeah, she has mastered Skyrim, so I know she’ll do fine once she gets her feet in the game, she already is making plans for taming creatures lol 
---
Whiney...becuase my opinion about Bethesda's customer service is different from yours....alright trump cya round
---
Ah. That does sound fun. I’m thinking one like grand prize find. Maybe a TSE with ammo or nice bloodied melee roll weapon. Then have other little nice things. We have full ultracite plans I believe, nuka cola t51 skin plans, handmade plans, lever action, metal walls, signs and letters. Key ones that people look for. So I figured it could be fun. Maybe every event switch up what we give out to encourage players from the last event to come as well as new players. 
---
If that song was Bohemian Rhapsody it wouldn't be sooooo bad as that things a rollercoaster of styles, but one classical tune on loop is....why...just...why
---
Last patch was three weeks ago. Prior to that a patch was coming out nearly ever week. Even factoring in for the holidays we are overdue. Dupers have had free run of things for three weeks now.
---
And in that time we've only gotten vague promises. "We're introducing a new game mode." "We're fixing some known issues." and it's all coming "in January."
---
We need some detailed information today about what specifically is happening and when. I love this game very much but my enthusiasm hangs on Bethesda's continued support and development.
---
You have no life 🤣🤣 you come on subreddits for games you don’t even have trying to start arguments LOL
---
The Problem with that is you would lose just as many players for deleting there favorite weapon that they spent hundreds of hours farming for.
---
I actually finally found it on one of the train station vendors. The name of the plan is "Plan: Safe" as opposed to the other which is "Plan: Floor Safe".
---
Damn the shotgun is the only thing what I don’t have anymore x.x I could give u the lvl 35 explosive pump shotgun? Or lvl 25 Twoshot explosive .50 cal?
---
YES.
---
Give me clutter ;\_; Let me make myself look lived in. Let me put down teddy bears and books and keycards and and and 
---
So you want a sensual massage from Todd while he whispers a real update to your ear? Will that count?
---
I also have enough Stims and Shells 
---
Do these ever expire?
---
I know I have gotten tons of these but have never used any.
---
No. Because I’m already pushed to do this on anything bigger than a supermutant.
---
Every time I do that quest I just hit the button and then fast travel to the surface.
---
I do actually...two girls 11 and 13, so I know exactly the mentality you're dealing with. First off, I wouldn't let my daughters play this game if for no other reason then the shit I hear randoms with mics spouting off about constantly. Secondly, if I did decide to let them for some random reason, I would make sure I was playing with them  in a private chat party and also to protect them from this very thing. PvP is part of the game like it or not, and there are a lot of shit heads in the world that get their kicks messing with low levels in video games. Honestly how do you not know and expect this very thing to happen?
---
I'd love to see one...were there is a deathclaw in the next room lol
---
Right? Free rad cleanse. I've made a virtual fortune selling chems to vendors.
---
You don’t drop mats unless you attack back and accept the challenge. So either she attacked him first, or she retaliated to his attack. You need to explain the core mechanics. All you lose is a few caps if it’s a one sided fight which don’t matter. And if you don’t attack back most trolls just get bored and walk away because they will lose more caps than they took from you when someone hunts their wanted status. And there is nothing stopping you from world hopping while being a solo player in order to avoid it if it’s that much of an issue for you. I mean it’s an online game, and you should know how the internet works by now. There will always be cretinous morons who want attention so bad they intentionally try to annoy people. If anything it is probably a good life lesson for her. “Some people are ignorant/arrogant dumbasses the world is full of them. But don’t give them the satisfaction of dragging you down, just carry on and enjoy the good things”
---
Yea that one you can. Try blueprinting extractors and then place them, pure hell.
---
This is not only an acceptable means of using base defenses, but doesn't harm the player base in the slightest. Be a man and herd your train of ghouls in a different direction and let the low level player's who want to Molotov farm that horde using the rocket turrets do their thing. 
---
Stop being an entitled child.
---
If its green SOME of the mats are coming from the workshop. it could say 100/22 and really only have 2 of something and the other 20 coming out of your stash. 
---
My first two shot was a fuckin fat man it was great
---
&gt; BoS paint on Combat Armor is currently well sought after because it gives a huge boost to DR/ER
---
Yeah, I have that paint on all of my parts already but there's probably an equivalent to that for robot armor? Like "polished" on metal gear?
---
Hate the mech warrior style power armors and am really just looking for the highest amount of DR/ER/RR. :)
---
Oh my yes. If you are gonna talk to someone else in the room, whisper or mute your mic. 
---
Lol this sounds like one of my teammates  when we Scorchqueens and get non teammates stealing our loot. He'll be like "You gonna steal from my team, bitch?!"and then run them down, starting a big PVP fight. He's hilarious!
---
But honestly, how many gnomes and lamps do you need? They don't sell *clutter* there, which is what we're really missing. I've got lamps for days.
---
Something about a naked dude running around in general will make me want to run away, i got no issue fighting/dying but I don't mess with crazy.
---
Just hang out at v76, just lay there in the draw me like your french girls pose, someone will solve the problem, just have some pants on.
---
That's actually an excellent strategy to alt f4 when you see one.  That should be sop for everyone.
---
We don't NEED anything. Get over yourself. It's a game. These people are being paid to do a job, not save lives.
---
You can whine as loud as you want and the only people you'll annoy are the other subscribers in this sub. BGS won't give a single shit.
---
I have her mic set to team only, but thanks for the advice 
---
Yeah would make up for me not finding metal walls i wanted yet!  LOL. 
---
I just moved and rebuilt this week though so it will be a while before I try again.  I had to figure out how to extend a second floor and then drop walls down from that and then attach a half wall to the bottom of that wall to surround an extractor in this photo...  foundations wouldn't place on such an unlevel area but FYI u can drop walls into the dirt.  LOL

True, but it wont follow me to my adventures. But I guess it will have to do.
---
Yeah, I've noticed there seems to be more douchebaggery on console than PC. Shame. I wish you and your family fun in playing, not this kind of introduction.
---
In a game universe where we’re the only “people” still out there. Some brave people are trying to give us raiders and you’re hating on them. Smh
---
Most people just dupe the tokens to get the mask.
---
Watch for the 'Its a Trap' event, it forces the SB to only be on the ground and as an event reward gives prime part plans, got one for the minigun, which could be...interesting....Just wish prime ammo wasn't prohibitively expensive to make, seriously have it use raw flux, not stabalized, it's a bloody consumable ffs
---
kinda? the only people that dont roll with passive on in nuke zones are complete dicks...Its karma to be honest. they have that shit coming to them. 
---
Teammates can't remove or move your items. You can however pick up or trash whatever they place down. So you still have full control over your camp. And I guess it uses their materials, so you're not losing anything, except for maybe getting something nice they decide to place down that you can choose to keep or scrap. So what is the issue?
---
Here is the link. [https://youtu.be/KH4nlTLVek4](https://youtu.be/KH4nlTLVek4)
---
I kid you not, I couldn't keep count how many SMs were in there. They just kept spawning! Even after the event was over I still had four of them to deal with
---
Did she hit them back? 
---
And miss out on a beautiful double cross scenario? How selfish can you get?!
---
People complain that SBs aren't landing...because they aren't fucking landing. Even when their entourage is dead, and nobody is shooting it, we're not interrupting its landing by staggering it. It still continues to fly if the AI decides it can't find a good landing spot (happens a lot in heavily industrialized areas), or narrow streets).  Even if you do shoot it, and cripple both its wings, it will just continue flying sometimes, when it should fall to the ground wherever it is. 
---
Bottom line, SBs, like the rest of the game, are a buggy mess. They get stuck. They sometimes don't land, they sometimes go into machinegun screech mode. And one thing everyone agrees on, their loot is *garbage* most of the time. Meaning, if one aggroes you, just hop on another server. It's not wort the time, the ammo or the inevitable damage to your armor. 
---
Yep
---
I just want a way to trash stuff without dropping down a paperbag. We need a trashcan recipe.
---
Yea, I did that.  Took about 3.5 hours...
---
This is a very quick way especially if there are lot of people working the clubhouse. It comes from a shared loot pool, so you can find it on bodies you didn't kill. But it does mean that each body will only have 1 of that item (such as glowing mass, high radiation fluids, etc..)
---
Broken quest lines. Shaky servers. People getting stuck in power armour. Enemies taking no damage. Infinite XP glitches. Being able to fly by stacking perks and mutations.
---
The trouble with travel mats, is when you first spawn in, you get there before the base does so you will need to place it at ground level or risk a fall if you log out not in power armour. 
---
Stupid game design to get tags on nearby enemys to get loot/xp - i bet it was the same guy that said „we don’t need a textchat“ in one of the dev-meetings 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/
---
To be fair, he did a good job getting the image and cropping it so it isnt painful to look at like most phone pic screenshots.  It wouldnt even be obvious if it wasnt for the bobblehead.
---
They love blaming problems on everything except their game. I got the same tone in my response: reboot your console, erase your save data, re-install. blah blah blah... They don't want to admit it's the game and apologize or reassure the consumers they're working on a fix. Nope. None of that would suffice 
---
Definitely! As VATS heavy characters can do some serious damage to limbs. What I have noticed is even if all limbs have been weakened to 0%, somehow they still have an escape path unless staggered on the ground. It does extend the "grounded" effect. Minions will spawn when they are on the ground and that's when the Scorchbeast will try to take back to the sky!
---
yeah but the whole point of the workshops is to incentive pvp. if you dont want ANY pvp dont capture the workshops
---
Looks great! I really hope one day they will figure out a way to prevent grass, tree branches, etc. from poking through foundations and walls.
---
Suitcase team member checking in. I've dropped a fortune in suitcases and the Overseer's chests. 
---
Okay, where can i find this roadmap? I thought they just announced "new vault game mode in the first quarter of 2019" which is jan-march. Ill keep an eye out for the post.
---
Havent played in 2-3 weeks so its scary to come back to no update and nothing new
---
Do they send an alert or are they literally only visual?
---
I survived, but barely! and only because I was luckily wearing a chest piece that nerfed SM damage by 15%.
---
Hell, how about survival mode on fallout. It's the base setting in this one,  but was an option in previous versions. Literally no benefit from turning it on in older versions. Just makes the game harder . Could break it down to just difficulty modes on games in general. What gain do you get from making the game harder , if you can get the same rewards for beating it on an easier setting.
---
And the real reason people Nuke the Whitespring - to kill people logging in for their mad loot!
---
well other than my tower anything I try to build from history or a blueprint seems to fail (well there is the base base I made that seems to lock into new locations ok, it was just 3 concrete floor things and all of the workbenches and a stash box, but I have not used that in a while.
---
wait they drop plans?!? i thought only the queen dropped plans. what kind do they drop?
---
Duping
---
Because fo76 literally just checks running processes. So if you renamed cheatengine.exe to something else it would be fooled.
---
It's a camp, not a home. Move on.
---
It gives -4 intelligence which doesnt seem to affect anything since I can still assign 15 point cards into intelligence 
---
Must've been stacking bobbleheads to one shot you in pacifist. Sorry this happened to ya, hope they fix these issues soon. Meds don't stack, should be easy to make bobbleheads the same.
---
&gt; if they were really raiding that's maybe fine but they not, they just there to destruct, annoy and grief, they not there for any other reason.
---
im gunna be honest.. that sounds like a raider 
---
You can also just play with a team to make sure you get back to your server and that the ownership falls to another person on the team.
---
It's is a godly talent. It's especially great for those of us without TSE's to shred mini boss mobs. 
---
Not shutting the fuck up and talking about random shit all the time. Especially when others are trying to explain something or helping a low level.
---
Buddy and I were taking a new player through a solo run for the first time. Explaining how to do it etc etc. He would ask for help or something but we couldn’t hear him because someone was telling us about his Grandmas prolapse.
---
That's just the netcode which is probably to root of most problems in this game
---
again I was just spit-balling a solution to the problem while your is allot simpler I think both would result in a significant reduction to the player base. I would be interested too see what solutions the moders would propose to fix the problem they have the best knowledge of the game and its engine perhaps they could come up with a better solution than us.  
---
Update on the update coming out today
---
Just like any other Fallout game or game in general, you eventually take a hiatus and come back when they have a new update
---
I've had that idea for a while now but I never find a tame-able one!
---
Would it be possible to replace the sound file for the jukebox?
---
Two shot explosive lever action puts em down pretty quickly. Problem is, you have to hope you have a two shot explosive lever action XD
---
Touched a nerve, I see. 
---
I'm a prison warden. I save people from killing other people over dumb things like socks and food. So I can understand why you'd want to blow off some stress, high risk job and all. 
---
I just think you're chosen method is pretty garbage. 
---
And as for Harper's Ferry? Come get some.   :) 
---
IRL murderers and rapists don't scare me. Neither do you. 
---
I'd prefer tons of variations with different tactics and powers. 
---
To hog kills but only when im the only one around not at the whitespring club
---
This goes out to all the people that think the "this goes out to" posts aren't getting annoying for the second to third month in a row.
---
&gt; Wants better communication
---
&gt; Doesn't actually read communications
---
I think I found the problem here.
---
I get up to some douchebaggery on pc but that is basically only mercilessly gunning down wanted players and sneaking up on unsuspecting people with a clown suit and creep fasnacht mask on.
---
yawn
---
Red dead 2 could be split into two games and each would be able to justify a 60 price before fallout 76 could.
---
He is on PS4 though, what does PC have to do with this?
---
Mostly ultracite weapon or PA mods, I say that but I've only gotten explosive vents from them and weapon mods. My most recent was ultracite rusty knuckles
---
I just hid in the upper left server room and came out to spam it with frags when I finally managed to kill it
---
Aha. I do use that card. Will try that. Thanks. 
---
F in the chat for you
---
this guy caps
---
Always stash junk before your log out, then it's not really a problem just a inconvenience!
---
Maybe because some of us aren't here to be jerks and actually help people. I went out of my way to make my lower level of my house a hub for new players even.
---
a good idea, a pity that the chainsaw is a joke Even the damage to other players is a badly told joke. 
---
Yesterday they posted on FB that an update is coming today.
---
I paid (nearly) full price and I don't honestly care that the game goes cheap, for as long as it doesn't go free.
---
Honestly, of the game price lowers it means that more people can buy it and play it, and that also means that my cheap ass friends will stop staying that they do t like to spend more then 15-30€ in a game and fucking come play with me.
---
No, i was watching/helping and shes like whos hitting me, it was from behind, so i told her not to hit back he’ll go away, but he kept hitting her, her health was really low, and I didn’t know you can still be killed in pacifist mode, he had some huge sword i never saw before, and after about 20 hits she died.  I wasnt watching her health because I didn’t think she would be hurt.
---
Who knows, maybe a stray bullet of hers hit him while she was killing radrats? 
---
I think so too the real  76 Reddit people must be coming on now thank you for the comment.
---
I pick up all the junk I see but I pick up armor and legendaries only If I'm going to scrap/sell them
---
You sound like the type to shelter your children too much.  I should know since that is what happened to me and it has been quite a struggle in my adult life breaking out of that upbringing on my own.  Bottom line is that its a game and most well raised teens are actually pretty competent compared to many adults.  This did not need a post in  any way other than to farm karma off sympathizers. 
---
Just ... so they can get the full experience! haha
---
I put stuff in train stations all the time too, also on xbox
---
I am currently adding in the basher perk. It's easier than switching and will help with the small fast insects that my build currently struggles with. I also like having a good bit of free inventory space. Due to all that, I am trying to maintain only three weapons as my mains. A .308 sniper rifle, a .45 combat rifle and a 40mm grenade launcher rifle (which I wonder what perk that scales off of)
---
Yea, apparently I wasn't clear enough in my initial post.  When I say updates and communication, I'm talking about details, not just vagaries about stuff they might do at some point, or updates about previous updates.  
---
This low expectation of quality from Bethesda in even their "announcements" is how we ended up with the game we have at this point.
---
I'm not trying to come off as whiny, I'm just expecting better of them.  Even some details like "We expect this to be ready in X months" is better than "We're looking at doing this some time this year".
---
You don’t have to restart, just leave the server and join another one whilst in PA.  Exit, take out the fully charged core, and repeat.
---
Yeah they are a broken un-fun annoying weak ass monster.
---
ive still never found handmade plans nor has any of the 6 people i play with regularly :(  And we're all lvl 60+ and some with alts.  such a hard drop to get.
---
however i was rebuilding CAMP the other day and a player walked by and message asked if I would mind placing a stash box.  Sure no problem.  He dropped me my first serum and flamingos plan!  I was super excited!   
---
as a team we all put our plans together and see who needs what.  then we pick someone on the server under lvl 20 and take them the rest.  we love gifting it.  heck vendors pay so little id rather leave them out of the loop even if they bought them!  
---
I go to the Top o' the World, the ski resort cabins next to it and that area.  There are a bunch of benches to scrap your junk, there is a suit of raider armor to harvest Fusion Cores from, lots of enemies to scrap steel from, and a bunch of plans laying around too.
---
There are 9 different can-chime traps that you can harvest lead and steel from too.  It's a great place to get junk to make bullets from and there are 2 vendors ( Railroad station and the robot in the hotel).
---
Spiffy!
---
Besides the fact that it creates an unsustainable economy? Ok, I failed to mention the issues for people that don't realize there's a cap limit. 
---
For example if you enter a trade with 24k caps and want to sell something for 5k caps (it's rare but does happen) then the player buying the item will get a 4k cap discount and the player selling will only receive 1k. Can be quite annoying and turn people off to trading outright.
---
very likely possible
---
Whoa, that's a good one!
---
Really cool idea that I'm totally going to steal
---
I picked it all up originally. Weight management is a part of the game, they will decide whether they will use it or throw it away. Like with missiles, I just pick them up and use them up as I get them then break the missile launcher down. 
---
Takes two players to catch them off guard, nuke#1 is should have already landed and is full of sweaty chumps usually whitesprings clubhouse, get your homie to launch a nuke#2 in the middle of nowhere, pick a spot everyone knows has nothing (space station), at the same time launch #3 on top of #1, the outline should not be visible, and the countdown will largely be ignored, because what idiot nukes the same spot twice. 
---
There are other methods but this one is easiest.
---
Have a quest that at the end allows you create a gun called “Scorchedrend”,  that forces them to land. The queen could have a high resistance to it. Just to make it not completely op.
---
Haha didn't end the way i thought it would...
---
I guess they just thought them 5 screws you just got were more important to them :/
---
That’s the right idea. Armor doesn’t refer to actual armor, it’s talking about damage resistance, which everything has, even apparently unarmored ghouls. So it applies to everything.
---
For me, around an hour. 
---
If you want to ignore what info is put out there sure there is a lack of communication. There will be a post today from the "In the vault thing" putting out the road map for the next 2 patches. They even twitted about it coming today since there wasnt the normal post yesterday. (you know the WEEKLY "update" thing they do?) It is normally out around 1pm - 2pm est.
---
Fix your own stash size. it is a multiplayer game dump the gear you dont need and quit trying to be a melee/sniper/pistol/heavy gunner/laser/dps/tank/healer.
---
Sure stash could be a bit bigger but it is never going to be infinite.
---
Can you get me glowing mass and high radiated fluids?
---
Charleston fire station has 60 lead in weights without firing a shot.  The hotel just outside flatwoods has weights in it too.  When I'm short on steel I just take the steel mill for a bit it has a big steel extractor built in.
---
Had to buy my tokens on reddit since my dailies for Camden Park were bugged
---
I am aware of the current state of the game. What this post is intended for is proper execution of a Scorchbeast when it is acting properly. I agree with you  that when the mechanics are acting properly that you should move on. However, I've had 3 machine gun scorchbeasts shooting nonstop at me and they are not fun to deal with. You can always run. You can always log out. Who is to say any loot is worth anything in a video game. I would rather have survived the 3 SB encounter and tell the tale to the next guy than to become irritated and negative to the point that I hate the game I am playing. Remember that "Time" is the most valuable thing in life. Invest it where you feel it's most important to you. Happy Hunting.
---
No just dumb solutions like wiping everybody's data. You think the game is *beginning* to die? Wiping everything would kill it outright. That's no solution at all.
---
that there is awesome....great job
---
Yeah that’s why you get pleasure from it. You know that sense of pride and excitement you get when you finally reach the top? That’s a flood of serotonin you’re getting to your brain from overcoming a particularly difficult challenge. You’re getting a chemical reward for that. That’s why very strenuous cardio is known to help depression. Doing an easier workout wouldn’t give you as much of a mental reward.
---
I just play normally while looting everything that is lootable, and I tag the components I run low on so they're highlighted. Whenever I find a crafting table I scrap it all to reduce the weight, including weapons/armor if I'm in a safe place.
---
Then I start each day by bulking the excess (keeping about 100 each) and visiting a vendor in each faction (mostly train stations plus Whitespring) to get rid of it.
---
The thing I'm frequently out of is ballistic fiber, and I only have like two pieces of armor that require it. I often visit Fort Defiance to look for more but haven't found any after my first trip. Maybe there's a lot of others farming there too.
---
Yeah I don't think I built one in the beta, but I did have a radio that I miss. Damn jukebox only plays classical station.
---
i switched from 5 turrets to just 1 behind the door (that has never attacked anything), and built a nicer place for myself and visitors
---
scrap those mofos, just dont camp too close to places so you dont get too many unwelcome guests
---
To the best of my knowledge the B.E.T.A. was the stress test and the actual Beta testing was handled internally and likely via feedback from the various press events leading up to B.E.T.A.
---
Given that Fallout 76 is built on a heavily converted single player engine and not a purpose built multiplayer engine I would imagine that the Devs focused the majority of their efforts on connectivity and stability issues reported by QA well ahead of gameplay and graphic issues.
---
Going back to my previous statement - Management would have basically told the Devs they have until such and such a date to provide a "shippable build". While we could argue the finer points of the Dev team leads responsibility to push back on unmeetable deadlines and resource allocation - that boat has sailed. No Dev wants to ship a product people won't enjoy (I mean, I guess excluding like virus "devs") and the team on Fallout 76 picked the battles they thought they could win before deadline.
---
And, personally, they didn't do a bad job. I played from Day 1 of the B.E.T.A. and have run in to very few issues and certainly no game breaking issues. I have always been able to connect and get in to the game when I want to. There is an immense amount of story to be found and places to explore. I got what I felt I was promised (Fallout 4 but in West Virginia and with PoopKnife2005 nearby [multiplayer]).
---
You got 2 weeks of playing before the people that couldn't afford a $60 game got to play. Do the those people get an xp boost because you are higher level?
---
You know what I did? Went and asked for the difference back! :)
---
And I’m sure those people appreciate that. I’m not playing as a jerk, Hell I’m one of those lower level players that might even go to your Hub. But still, this game was made with the intent purpose that our interactions with other “characters” would be through solely other humans. And humans are crazy af. So some will obviously gravitate towards a more conflict heavy play through, while others,like yourself, will try and stay within the bounds of right and wrong you’ve gotten form being raised in a non nuclear apocalypse. Both are valid options that our might overlord The Todd intended.  
---
I'm not falling for this! You're trying to steal my junk run secrets!
---
Shoo fly! 
---
only laugh you would need [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvNhhH54k6w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvNhhH54k6w)
---
You're welcome?
---
Nice to know someone is getting use out of all the crap I can't carry.
---
Yeah but no one replied. I was not subbed when I posted it. So I deleted that one and re-posted it. So I thought I messed up
---
I must have gotten lucky the last few times I've taken it no one bothered me lol.
---
Just the TSE's, they are too OP, let's be honest most people did not earn the TSE legit, that's a fact.
---
Yeah, that's not "barter system". That's dropping stuff on the ground. In the same vein as eating cold dog food off the sidewalk is not the same thing as fine dining. 
---
For a loot-based game, released in 2018, to NOT have a barter system is beyond insane. I can't remember my first game with barter system in it, but I know Diablo 2 had it for sure, back in 2000. That's almost 19 years ago. Pretty sure Ultima Online, released in 1997, had a barter system also, didn't it? That's 21 years ago! These aren't new concepts. Fallout 76 is not even medieval in its design, it's basically bronze age at this point.
---
I'd need to double check but 5-7 range.  maybe 8.  I have a few cards like lucky break and crack shot or what ever but I don't have my build memorized.  I can see luck having an effect but I can't see how it would be that large.
---
I’m on Xbox bummer man!!!
---
This is why I carry a phantom device.
---
Stealth build is fun, but only until end-game. Course, that's because the only thing this game has for an "end-game" is a "mob rush the big bad SBQ" or "fight 70 bajillion glowing bloated ones all at the same time".
---
I played a stealth build and I had a lot of fun with it. But as my group started farming Whitespring/Prime, my usefulness came to an end and I have been evolving into more of a bard character with strong charisma stats and empath, that kind of thing.
---
For exp and junk do whitesprings golf club cause all they drop is junk, ammo and legendaries
---
21 days so 3 but to go from talking to us every week to not at all is weird
---
Hit the button and run like hell back the way you came. I used bladed melee too because it's faster and causes more damage. Love my serrated blade machete....
---
I don't know what point you're trying to make. When mine was that sometimes a sense of accomplishment is enough of a reward in itself . That I don't understand why people feel like they deserve an obligatory special reward for beating content. 
---
Demolition expert increases all explosive damage, it is a 5 level intelligence card
---
dunno what this dude's on
---
I'm running a ton of mods including one he mentions and I've got a glow map plis the hot rod PA station
---
Thanks, we all know changes need to be made
---
Ppl trade in items more than caps though.
---
Literally what toy say it doesn't do....it does.
---
Btw ppl wouldn't sell for caps if they are at 24k. That's why most ppl are trading in items.
---
I use the BoB almost exclusively. I've tried other melee weapons, and nothing else seems to take the nasties down like the BoB.
---
Thanks, i dont use FB
---
That's great.  I love the C.A.M.P.s that are built organically into local areas, and once the bug to destroy mine comes along, I intend to find a cool place to do this.
---
What would be looking to get for ea? And would you be interested in a weekly contract?
---
I rock The Summerset Special (Magnum 44) which ignores 50% of enemy armor. I also maxed out my pistol perks. I have all three of them so I’m able to do 60% more damage and I have Bloody Mess maxed out as well. My Luck is pretty high too, so my VATS Critical’s recharge super fast. When its all said and done my pistol does 125 damage which I’m pretty happy with. And thats not accounting for the 50% armor ignore or the additional critical damage from VATS. 
---
I thought I was trippin when my radio went missing
---
Have you never played a game like this before?  it is common for there to be a number of patches early on then they get spaced out more and at some point you start getting additional content.  The weekly patches were never meant to be an ongoing thing.  I suspect dupe activity has likely decreased since the novelty wears off and there are only so many people willing to buy such things.  I hope they ban the dupers myself.
---
I replied to one of your older comments;
---
&gt;Sorry for the delay guys. /u/Exkath mentioned me saying it's in the mire, the spot near the waterfall. I wasn't able to get on with him to physically see it, but I did some research. There's a waterfall near dyer chemical, and according to https://fo76map.com/ there are two lead nodes on across the river from dyer (In the mire, it's the building southwest of the 65 road sign). I'm guessing it's the one due west of the plant. I haven't explored that part of the map yet myself.
---
Exactly. Kind of annoying right now that modifiers are color co-ordinated.
---
I don't know how you can get better loot when everyone has a tse weapon there are no better guns
---
1.  Turn the volume of the basketball game up on the TV so the sneakers squeeking is painful to others.  
---
2.  Play your crap music louder than the basketball game.  
---
3.  Make sure your mic does not have a mute button for when you wife starts screaming at you for being a pathetic twit playing that game all the time.  
---
4.  Make certain that the Mute button is not used on the mic while eating chips, or while doing massive bong hits or hitting your vape device.
---
Not if you have herbivore 
---
Banning the people who are spreading this makes it less likely to spread, since anybody wanting to make videos on it in the future will be afraid of a potential ban. Like I said, there's a long way to go, but this would be the best place to start. Other than, of course, just fixing the damn exploit
---
Here is a tip, if you join up with a group of people you have never talked to before, maybe keep your racist opinions to yourself. Had a very uncomfortable session a few days ago. 
---
It will take a very long time to kill you, I had people show up at my base, start destroying it, so I left with one my characters so my base disappeared, they waited around and tried various weapons to shoot me, sure I was taking damage, but I just kept drinking water until they left .. so unless they using a OP glitch or you not paying attention, there is no reason for you to die or they swarm you ..
---
I am really hoping this next update will bring a real passive mode where they can do no damage, here is hoping.
---
I give mine away free when that happens also. 
---
I'm out of the loop, mind filling me in?
---
Since when? I stopped building turrets at my camp ages ago because I have never, not even once, been able to get any loot from what they killed
---
No the flare gun is essentially a gun that shoots a flare in the air and is highly visible.
---
Hopefully raids will drop wall trophies.
---
Try tents, I have a lot of decoration with tents
---
There's an update today. I said this in the last post about lacking communication that was made 5 minutes ago;
---
If you're not going to read the updates Bethesda gives out, the issue is on your end.
---
Freindly advice, there's a quest there called mayor for a day, if you complete it, it makes the robits non hostile toward you
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/3wohkyIGcEOE8gayy6yCMg/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-9-2019
---
Here ya go.  An update.
---
Dont look at twitter, i thought they would post on every social media. Also, server maintenance and updates are two different things and after logging in and seeing no update at all i can confirm. 600 lbs is low and you know it, its fine atm just like it was fine at 400...
---
Honestly, it doesn't get all that better at level 50. I still dig them up.
---
Half of the fun for me is figuring them out. I don't want to look up the answers online. We had one for the forest, that showed two bridges, one broken. We literally broke up and searched different areas. Some followed the river, since it was a bridge, some checked out train bridges.
---
I finally realized where it was, and sure enough, I was right. 
---
For us, that's part of the fun. Figuring things out. 
---
i feel like it should be an optional thing you can turn on bc there have been times where i wander into the mire and immediately get wrecked while looking for logs. 
---
just a small notification in the corner of the screen (ex. *Now Entering The Mire* )
---
plus i’m just a dunce who doesn’t pay attention at all so that’s another reason why i want it. 
---
No they don't. 
---
It doesn't affect anything really. You get more materials from scrapping the higher your int is, but I think that is all. 
---
And it's not even that high of a return. At 15 int, you get +66% materials when scrapping things. I guess the good thing is these extra materials are the better ones (ballistic fiber, etc). 
---
Right here
---
Which is not in his build.
---
Thank You.
---
Holidays been done man
---
im planning on building a brick CAMP, but havent gotten to it yet.  I dont think itll add much protection though.
---
I had concrete protection walls around my generator and asshat moles broke it...
---
More like a molerat to the knee.....
---
Like a robobrain but with a fish😂😂
---
As a gamer who is severely red-green colour deficient, this doesn't work. Red and some greens show up as grey or brown, depending on undertones. It all looks the same to me, honestly. 
---
But she mist of tried to shoot back ? Only way they could of really killed her ? Or did she not realize she was taking damage ?
---
But yeah get your point, anyone who attacks a low level is a douche. Really no reason for it. 
---
Thats insane! Maybe the only thing to do is to take a break, play another game and wait for some dlc. Kudos to you though
---
Thanks for being helpful. Everyone else wanted to be mean
---
But you can’t reject pip-boy
---
Just level a character to 15 and go to the Harper's ferry vendor, I've done it 3 times now. With a couple of server hops you get it every time. 
---
I'm not sure if this is maybe your first MMO, but we can agree to disagree on what a reasonable amount of time is
---
Thank you. ^_^
---
There are trash can and dumpster recipes, though unfortunately they just function as stash boxes. Maybe they could be updated in the future?
---
What a great read, thanks!
---
I wouldn't call it a dumb solution a non preferable one but at this point id take any solution too this buggy unplayable mess  I have had 12 server disconnects today alone 
---
Nirvana
---
Thanks, thought they crossposted to all social media as they should?
---
"Dunno, ghoul stuffs." 
---
I found a "gilded" paint job on a mini gun that was not an Atom Shop skin. Idk where i can get another one since it dropped from a scorched and I dont want to scrap it even though it is level 35 because it is so pretty 
---
I don't know, I think I am just unlucky with that sort of stuff. Like, I know there is always a scripted attack when you take a place. 
---
Like, the first time I took the converted munitions factory with some friends, we got attacked by two scorch beasts and all the scorched creatures they bring along. One guy was level 50. Everyone else was like, level ≈30 and I was level 19. I don't know how we won, haha.
---
You've been downvoted to hell and back, but I say you are on the right track.  The fact that legendaries can be farmed means that the crafting system is basically worthless in endgame, aside from crafting ammo and a couple of mods.  Doesn't seem right.
---
Maybe we can have a chance to reverse engineer mods by scrapping legendaries or be able to remove them to apply to another weapon.  \*shrugs\*
---
Is there a way to downgrade cards?  Like if you made a card level 3, can it be rendered into a 2 and 1?
---
At this point I want them to do anything about scorchbeasts, literally anything. Reduce their spam, make them land more, make them drop half-decent loot. They are just so bad that anything goes.
---
In skyrim dragons actually land as well. Scorch beasts do not. 
---
Sadly, I was born with a gambling addiction, so it's easy for me to keep playing...
---
"But what if the next servers shop has a rare item, let me just check..."
---
"Couldn't hurt to nuke the springs again, might get a decent weapon!"
---
"Something good will probably drop if I wander around for a bit..."
---
Ah...rng loot...my bane...

---
apparently you can change that
---
Thank you. &lt;3
---
Yes, those frequent early game patches usually fix game breaking bugs and exploits, and once they've made the game playable, patches become more spaced out as the developers focus on generating content and balance changes.
---
I don't think we're quite past that first stage yet.
---
Don’t get your hopes up.
---
Great to know thank you! I was always a bit hesitant joining teams because of this
---
That guys post history is hilarious.  Has literally never had a nice thing to say about thing lol
---
Wings dont have hit boxes last time i checked
---
White Knight is a great perk to reduce the material need for repairing armor, and Power Patcher for PA repairs. With White Knight it reduces the Ballistic Fiber requirement from like 7 down to 1 when repairing apiece of armor if I remember correctly. Something like that anyway.
---
Great build
---
Then I'll eventually have to add that one it. Because that's too useful to not have.
---
I saw him around this exact area last night... immediately left the server )) 
---
So, Dragonrend?

That would explain why the supermutant looked so confused when I shot him with a flare gun...

What do you want? Asiimov Gauss gun? Or hyperbeast handmade?

Same, it just breaks immersion when you are travelling the world in what looks like just a t shirt and jeans, I wish those backpacks from the creation club would make a comeback soon
---
It happens. Happened to me early on. Kinda one of those things.
---
Best thing I can say is advise her to not fight back and store her junk often. If a situation like that happens let her be killed by the higher level without fighting back. Hopefully her junk was stored and she won't lose much. The attacker will then become a murderer and end up with wanted status, and then, sniper/bounty hunter type players like me will come a hunting.
---
Also if you're on PS4, I'm happy to help out with gear and supplies. Just shoot me a message.
---
oh , thanks man 
---
Yeah it gets frustrating. Save the small talk for when we’re just walking around exploring. Which is 90% of the time. Haha
---
She sounds like she needs to get some girlfriends together and do a Group FaceTime or something.
---
Which is why I my suggestion is to make it so it's based on input or a timeout. Or optimize the game so I can cook a hot-pocket before the game loads with my gaming rig with an SSD amiright?
---
And it probably isn’t, but that’s the thing about a raider! There set of values are different from you or mine, and so to them, it’s just a con. Oh and also back to my earlier “double cross” comment.
---
Melee is just so much more efficient than guns. Higher damage and no need for ammo. And nothing feels better than dashing between scorched and supermutants with speed demon and marsupilan mutations, squatting them with instigating deathclaw gauntlet like a One-Punch Man.
---
Scorchbeasts are the only reason I still carry a gun.
---
All I can tell you is, good luck with them implementing any shared progress between ALTS because reallocating SPECIALS isn't instantaneous.  Even though it could be if you bank level ups.  They would have to weigh simply letting you reallocate on a whim with implementing whatever mechanics they would need to enable cross-character progression.
---
What level are you may I ask?
---
WELL SHIT OMW
---
When they attack my camp I just log out, in the time it takes to grab their attention and kill them, they've already caused a ton of damage. :(
---
I second this, even better if you have a friend with the gunsmith perk with all the mods researched so they can build you a silenced scoped hunting rifle and spare you from having to invest in it. You'll be wrecking everything until you get to endgame where it's not built for guerrilla tactics.
---
Oooo shotgun.  Does it take into account every spot hit like explosion damage?
---
I’d be ok with a weekly contract. Idk on price right now. Have to do some research 
---
Not to reddit, didnt know they werent posting to EVERY social media
---
yeah, if they are playing the game on the console, they can snap the screen and drop the reddit post on the phone without juggling uploads or the like.    On a PC its pretty easy to SS and go to reddit, less so on a console.
---
&gt; We’ll have the patch notes available to go along with the patch
---
Like previous patches, they'll release them the day of the patch
---
See, the thing is if someone slaps me for that, they go down.
---
"Only 200 and something DPS"

For a ranged automatic weapon which can double its damage indefinitely while scoring 100% crits on the head.

Not yet.

good point,  but the flora change as much as the colour and its pretty easy to tell where you are by that alone
---
I didn't have my mic on or I would have just told them I had some stuff to give. But on the other hand the other night when someone was waving at me I went over and spoke through the mic to give them a tip about the weather pump.  As soon as they heard my voice the turned around and ran to the forest. :(
---
I've had the same experience since Beta. I see many people complain about multiple bugs that I haven't seen once. Except the occasional Server disconnect, which is annoying at best for me. 
---
Hi new to this game!
---
Tip 1.  Trust no one, not even yourself...
---
Tip 4.  Some people on the internet aren't good with numbers, make sure you pay attention while trading.
---
Tip c.  Levels don't really mean much when it comes to enemies.  See a level 50 doge, treat it like a level 1.
---
I was able to lay walls on foundations inside out, if that helps. Put extra foundations or floor pieces in front of each piece you'd like to mount inside out, put the wall in the direction you'd like it (with beams outside), then remove the extra floor/foundation pieces. To save materials, build extra floor or foundation, lay it in front of where you want the wall, place the backwards wall, then move the floor/foundation piece to the next section you want a wall.
---
You may have to start from scratch without walls at all, and put them on one at a time. Who knows if it was patched out since I last tried with my brick walls. 
---
Availability of plans at vendors?!!? Hello!!! 
---
Harpoon gun with taser mod. 
---
I thought I saw the reddish screen tint of one in Watoga so I eagerly searched around to save the day... (buildings too tall to see if where the flare was)
---
...but nope, it was an assaultron firing her head laser at scorched. 
---
There is a set at the WV Lumber Co
---
"*We’ll have the patch notes available to go along with the patch"*
---
My guess is that we will see those Monday - Patch day
---
I don’t know why I was so excited for this. They’re always so vague. 
---
sixth - have fun with it and read things.  I have found some interesting stories on terminals and notes.     
---
Seventh - From 20-25 be patient it gets a bit grim leveling but picks up again after 25.
---
Suitcases or in the absence of, the cash register. 
---
I've seen that bug happen a lot the past couple days and I think it's based on the armor type. I've noticed my Trapper leg always does this but not my combat armor chest piece. Wonder if that's a coincidence or related. When i remove them before jumping in it doesn't happen
---
from the post:
---
" We’ll have the patch notes available to go along with the patch "
---
so the patch notes will be up when the patch comes.
---
Atomic shop
---
Just saying
---
thats why i wasnt excited...no real new stuff...just fixing what should have worked.
---
Still, im playing on in the lone wasteland...
---
I haven't played RD2 online myself, but from what I've heard it would never be worth $60 by itself. 
---
stop playing before the gamebreaking bugs crush your soul
---
I had a damn scorched with a gamma gun that fired as fast as a minigun. \*Shivers\* my friend died basically instantly and I survived only because I was partially behind a tree.
---
yeah :) saw one last week. Super cute... Already dead tho :( I was sad
---
I could certainly see a system like that working.  I'd be happy with either type of solution, I just want to see something that makes eating and drinking not involve going into the pipboy and clunking through menus so often.
---
Or, idk, fix the dupe bug and go no tolerance on abusers?  Your post history suggests you are negative about literally everything, so maybe this threatens your account?
---
It sucks, but it's a multiplayer game with pvp.  There are literally no multiplayer games without griefing and dickheads anymore than there you're free of them irl.  Better to live and learn.
---
Ok 601 but you know what I mean, all these dupers are have a lot more than 601, they glithed unlimited stash, so anyone abusing the stash glitch should get an automatic ban.
---
TSE weapons are ruining it for everyone else, it's that simple, there is absolutely no need for a OP weapon like this. If we had private servers, I couldn't care less, but to show up in a nuke zone and have douche bags, downing every enemy is not cool especially when they see me killing them. I was killing a bunch of enemies and some douche from the distance was shooting enemies I was fighting stead of fighting their own ..
---
Again very few players have legit TSE weapons, so yeah they need to get rid of them because 99% of tse's are duped
---
:'(
---
All good, I don't hold anything personally against you or anything and to point out I only said "you sound like the type to" not that you were.  Just saying :P.  
---
i too heart bearskin rug
---
&gt; if you don't crash
---
Or if it doesn't decide to drop nothing even if you clearly damaged her many, many times.
---
oh nice, will have to give it a try.
---
I have a maxed out focused fire perk card and cannot get vats to shift to the damn wings.   How the hell do you do it?  (PS4)
---
now im even more pissed off about it. why on earth would it indicate that you need them to use the mod, if you don't. It beggars belief.
---
I use a shotgun, a .44 and a machete. With 175 hours in the game, I have *never* seen any legendary weapon of those types drop (not even Junkie crap), except a Machete I bought from a vendor.
---
I did get a whole bunch of legendary cutlery however.
---
I think there are just too many possible legendary weapon types and armor, and some types are much rarer than others, because, why would players be happy to loot something, right? That would defeat the purpose of being hopeful.
---
FTFA: "Beyond Monday’s patch, we’re working on another patch that we hope will hit near the end of the month. This patch will continue to add fixes for issues being voiced by the community, including the number of plans Vendors have available, fixing a few Legendary mods, and continuing to address issues with some Perks."
---
No problem bro.
---
I gotchu.  &lt;3
---
i tried to make one but my gas canister disappeared in classic glitch manner and i havent found one since
---
I don't think that is true. Dying intentionally is actually a way lower levels use to get rid of rads without losing their mutation if I remember correctly. Or using a perk such as Sun Kissed.
---
Remember the Cappy glasses from Nuka-World.  Just take the Cappy glasses in 76 and give them the effect of giving corpses, meat piles and (whatever robot meatpliles are called) a pulsing glow.  I suppose you could add a power armor mod but you'd probably want to add a way to toggle it to avoid migraines.  Actually, just skip all the hardware and let us toggle the ability.  I'd prefer a base ability to a Perk.  And for a bonus points to help Bethesda PR make it so it only works on corpses (etc...)  that may spawn loot for the player.  But what I really want is a pony.
---
Build wherever you want. Brannigan thinks he's the head of the  fucking Appalachian Homeowner Association or some shit. 
---
I'd actually love some half horizontal walls. Sometimes my wall to floor ratio ends up off by a half horizontal wall. 
---
u/psilocyborg75
---
Like your gamertag.
---
Does your C.A.M.P. come with a....
---
*creepy voice*
---
GUARDIAN ANGEL? 
---
Fair enough, I am thoroughly enjoying this game. I just would like to have had more CAMP options. At the very least a release on what future updates/content we can expect.
---
Yep. I'm excited for the content update that is forthcoming.
---
My question is what is bethesda going to do about websites selling in game weapons. Theres some fuck ass youtuber that is advertising one.
---
That definitely helps, but I'd still argue that adding a map view that you can toggle to show borders would be very helpful for a lot of people. Doesn't need to change anything outside of the map, just give defined borders, and when I hover my mouse over an empty area on the map, show the name of the region, and level of enemies in that area. Shouldn't be hard to do, and won't adversely affect anyone since it's a toggle.
---
This is beautiful
---
5%? im lucky mine is only 1%
---
I have a very large intricate camp at the whitesprings golf course, but not a single turret, it is all for looks, everyones welcome to use all my stations during nukes etc as its usually right on the outside of the blast zone, it sees quite a bit of use, and its always fun when people hobble in over-encumbered and you just here them go "thank god" makes me feel good.... so please... dont destroy mine :P  lol
---
I built mine on the precipice of a cliff and it sometimes spawns me in mid air so I fall to my death.
---
Yeah.. they'd need to get the word out though of course.  Rather than just an unconfirmed maybe.. that could be an entirely different game.  But if it's true.. yeah they need to publicly state they're banning people.
---
Ladders leaning against building walls that you can walk up to access roofs, but if you are in PA you have to hop up them, without PA I can walk up them like stairs. Some require a little jump at the top to get on the roof (Marsupial not required)
---
It's a very dumb solution. Doing literally nothing would be better than what you propose. Wiping everyone's progress wouldn't save the game in the long run, it would be the nails in the coffin. This game will die out immediately and even more shit would be smeared on their name.
---
Anything? Maybe if they added another head to spam screech, another asshole to fart from and up their hp a thousandfold! 
---
Dude... you stole my gig =P.  I've been doing this since... level 30ish... level 129 now.  I love it and I'm glad someone else has gotten into it!
---
I constantly creep my friends out by joining their game without saying anything, and they'll hear the chainsaw revving up outside and they'll come running.  We've made some AWESOME screenshots of me creeping through windows and such.  My favorite was when I got skindagoed last night but still had the outfit on.  So there I am about 9 feet tall stretched out in a creepy torn up clown outfit looking like something out of Killer Clowns from Outer Space.
---
All in all, it's a lot of fun, and I'm glad to see someone else doing it =)
---
NOT ON REDDIT, for the last time I DIDNT KNOW THEY POSTED TO 1 OR A FEW SOCIAL MEDIAS AT A TIME. IF THEY POSTED TO ALL THIS WOULDNT BE A MISCOMMUNICATION
---
The problem with things like Warhammer is you can’t just get started (as far as I know, I also haven’t played) without putting down an unreasonable amount of money and effort
---
Sounds like it's you
---
Kinda like a destiny type thing? A soul bound inventory? 
---
yeah, while stopping at the vendor I've had low level people run trains without notifying me,  then sticking around to "help" me mop up.  .. Is the pathing.. that's a really good leveling spot for lower levels though.. or at least I enjoyed it Ash heap has the best visuals and density of creatures.
---
Problem is...
---
It's only at 100% AP if you are in Garb and have the Eye.  Only something like 40 DR.  Glass cannon in spades.
---
End of Jan, legendary affixes get looked at.
---
I bet Monday they fix duping, later they nerf explosives.
---
This makes me want to rebuild my person. Thanks for the info.
---
I haven't seen that but that would be essentially game breaking.
---
It seems cool, but it’s definitely one of those things in the “way too good” category. 
---
Learn via scrapping isn’t good. Difficulty of acquisition is not a good method of balancing, because eventually people will get the thing. Or! You make the chance to get it so low, that realistically only a tiny portion of the player base could have it. Either way, it does nothing to balance it or pisses off players cause they’ll never realistically get it, and getting it is mostly luck based.
---
Resource cost is another form of that same kind of balancing. Eventually players will acquire the mats and make it. 
---
Such things only work if there is a way to lose the item, via max durability degradation leading to permanent breakage, and/or dropping all equipped items on death, etc. Which IMO is a really cool mechanic and fun in its own way, I dunno if it is a fit for Fallout though.
---
"But I'm nothing without the (Excavator) suit!"
---
"If you're nothing without the suit then you shouldn't have it"
---
When I had just turned level 25, someone rolled up on me and kindly attempted to give an excavator power armor set. I had just created my own, and said thanks, but not necessary. 
---
While that's a valid point, I kind of like the idea of creating traps for players. The way I've viewed this game is that we are among the first people to leave the vault and go off into the world. In past games, there has been a mix of survivors and raiders. A good number of survivors that did not come from vaults split up into the groups of survivor vs raider or otherwise. I'm no expert on the lore, but this is how I've pictured it. I've also always pictured that some people from the vaults will inevitably turn raider and the same can be seen in the community.
---
Some players like to wreck havoc and fight other players, while others want to remain passive and fight the wasteland monsters. To an extent we are given tools to be a raider with the PvP system but perhaps it needs to be expanded and improved upon or given a more PvP dedicated area. We are also given tools to build what we want such as traps for other players. I recently unlocked the keypad doors but didn't have the switches to trigger components. I placed the door down, input the code and went inside only for the door to close and give me no way to open it from the inside except for building my way out. 
---
I think it makes for interesting experiences to come up with ways to trap players. Again though, I see your point about wanting to protect players, but I think having some outlets for players to be the enemy makes for an interesting game as long as Bethesda balances out the PvP system.
---
As a wrap up, I would say it's also a risk entering a strangers CAMP because you have no idea what they have done. As shown in a recent post, a player created an oven to kill other players who entered by baiting them in. There are survivors and raiders out there in the wasteland and while it would suck to lose junk, there is always more junk out there and these encounters are part of the game. Technically, entering someone else's CAMP would be trespassing I suppose and it's up to the player to take that risk. I think for the most part people want to help each other, but there are also raiders amongst the player base. 
---
As you said, hopefully they tune up these different systems to make a more dynamic and interesting experience that is also well balanced. 
---
That wasn’t the case before everything was duplicated. Your roll chance of a two shot explosive is enormously low 
---
Did you have passive mode on?  Might have shot them while hunting the Wendigo together and they took that as a sign of aggression.  At this point, no one gets a "oops, my bad" pass on shooting players.  Use passive mode if you aren't actively engaging in PvP.
---
To use it, open your map, then the main menu.  In there choose settings, and then in the Game section, you can turn passive mode on.  Makes it pretty much impossible to get killed by other players, accidentally or on purpose.
---
This is the third time in about a day you've posted this. if you're trying to be a wasteland vigilante just do it, dont pretend like you've just stumbled upon him. It's obviously you lol
---
This whole write up was based off 50+ solo encounters outside the Blast Zones. Inside Blast Zones they act like I have described, but with the strain on certain population densities of characters, they will "bug" out and not follow a lot of guidelines. 
---
This was written based off my experience of a melee build. I don't use anything but a TSE Pump Shotgun, Endangerol Syringer, and a GR Furious SuperSledge I found. 
---
Back in the day when I was against power armor. But then I met these creatures. I killed the guys on the ground and it drops. But, before I used to wait for 10 to 20 minutes and it wouldn't come down. Try it out. I'm positive this was the intended mechanic. Read through the other comments about staggering and hopefully if I  could have helped you in at least one thing you may have not known.
---
The loot for SB is random. They eat a lot of random things. You know how the alpha predators are.. anything is fair game. That's how I look at it. Most of the lvl 65 to 80 or 91s drop Ultracite Plans. 
---
I like them as they present one of the few real challenges in the later game. I understand your frustrations but you picked a lousy place to camp. That's on you. 
---
I've actually found them to be totally manageable since the last AI change. Their DR seems to drop once they land and any weapon with high dps feels effective. That being said, I agree with your last point. I often avoid/evade them because their loot is always underwhelming. 
---
Maybe try not camping on a spawn point if you'd like to minimize encounters? 
---
Nooo I personally hate snipers in fallout they seem off to me
---
Watgo rooftops, near virtibirds.
---
I like your style :)
---
Make it cost a special material that can only be obtained by scraping legendary items.
---
I don't want to engage someone 100 levels higher than me 0.o
---
ikr, how boring and uninformative ..
---
The sniper part sounds like m, but I am on PS4. I do also give out aid supplies, etc., but I'm usually in Firebreathers gear.
---
true, bethesda migh add clear borders but i reckon some player has already done it
---
you can keep them at your camp and they will become a part of your budget and stick around
---
This is my biggest issue. Everyone's CAMPs are basic. Creativity is difficult. I've got some neat little tricks with the triangle walls to give more modern angles and such. That and focusing ATOMs on purposeful decor. Proper flooring variety, only decorations that fit a motif or room, etc.
---
I feel like I have a lot of options at this point and can really get a lot out of a long term location investment creativity wise. DEFINITELY need more though.
---
I'm fully expecting a sort of re-release of Fallout 4 assets WITHOUT using the ATOM store. They would be *perfect* for a lower effort "major" update. Have a month off from harder work to focus on a bigger content piece down the road. For example, have a major release patch include fleshed out robot CAMP building. Have players hunt for hackable models and spare parts, collect personality holotapes for their new bots, etc. Can keep the playerbase occupied for a long span of time where "new" content beyond old Automatron stuff would be some voice lines, robot paints, maybe a part or two, and that's it. Frame work for robot companions is already breadcrumbed in with Miguel at the Airport. Have the player update and debug his holotape that he only got working on Fluffy. Maybe figure that out, have us go to RobCo Research Center, authenticate the permissions, then maybe get General Atomics verified too. Would be very, very simple compared to something new of equal size.
---
Other stuff is definitely coming with Factions. Fully expecting the raider decor to come from that, BoS paints/decor, maybe some more Far Harbor stuff from Mire Free States?
---
Not everything is going to be nickled and dimed. Yes, they're going to take advantage of recycling it. Not thinking it'll be directly for monetary reasons though.
---
And honestly? What if it HAD released with a GIGANTIC catalogue including all of 4's stuff on day 1? Would feel incredibly overwhelming and designs would be a circus early on.
---
While they DEFINITELY need better walls/floor dimensions and stuff like that, basic cosmetics? Eh, I'm cool with a slower leak.
---
I have a furious Gatling gun 1 star I’ll sell for 1k or trade for similar item 
---
Dumb to say you dont like other people being too strong so you want their things taken away. I'm not worried though because it'll never happen.
---
LMAO, that was laughable 
---
Inside the vault started out like actual communication about what they were working on at the time, but now it has devolved into "We're gonna release a patch this week, then another one later and they'll fix some stuff". 
---
lolk
---
Agreed, they can disappear from the game completely or stay in the nuke zones where they belong. Camps should be a no fly zone regardless where you built. They completely broken, they should not be able to detect you if you hidden. I either change worlds or just run until they stop (this is the easiest solution for me to get rid of them). If I am at my camp, they do rarely show up, I will make sure to get away from my camp asap, else they will wreck it.
---
Oh is that what I said? I thought I said you could justify red dead online 60 price before you could justify fallout 76's. And you could. Easily. 
---
Wow, your camp is powered by bricks?!
---
eek! one mans trash.  luckily i play with a full team and we all run different builds.  im the only one that uses the handmade so extras were given to me also.  but i still think it was only about 6 total found between 4-5 people.  i was level 30 or so before i found one.
---
Yeah even that was extremely over powered and that’s where I was getting the thought from I remember once you got 1 explosive weapon (which wasn’t hard with all the legendary mobs in the glowing sea) you where set for the rest of the game until you finally got bored and stoped playing (about lv 97 for me)
---
Sounds like January patch #2 is the beef stew I’ll be waiting for.
---
Yes, you are lucky.  I have 11% tied up in this bug.  
---
Please tell me you're on ps4
---
... and no steadfast ward...
---
That has nothing to do with legendary affixes unfortunately. 
---
They couldn't even share some patch notes?
---
I wish I could go 7/10 of an hour without my game crashing
---
Thank you for the link. 
---
They ruined Fallout once they started catering to all the WoW losers. 
---
Just like they ruined Elder Scrolls with ESO.
---
It's great to be able to play a game with friends, but now it's to the point where you can't even enjoy the games unless you're part of some sort of 'clan' and they all obsess over player 'builds' and perks.
---
I'm over lvl50, no mutations, and I haven't even attempted a SBQ because there's no way I'm doing it by myself.
---
Not anytime soon. But in a year or 2, who knows. At that point they may switch over to attract more players as they've currently alienated a good portion of their original fanbase. 
---
I have a purifier that has a "no go"-sign over it. can't be placed, can't be scrapped. takes 3% of budget : P
---
I think they meant TSE explosives
---
And Base Melee Weapons at level 50 with no perks is over 200 Damage..Guns are for range. You can also get crits with Melee. You don’t have an argument. At this point your hard headed. Your blinded and basis. 
---
30% for 3 points, or 60% for 9 points. Those extra 6 points are much less efficient than the first 3. If you're doing no power armor and running low health for need rage, you definitely need blocker. And the increased attack speed from martial artist is a net gain in dps, if you are already going to be killing things in one hit anyway.
---
I even sneak when fighting level 2 scorched sometimes just because it's fun and I like sneaking around and stabbing them in the back. It's viable for most situations, and when it's not, perks can be switched around to be just as effective. You can sneak solo run the silos in a short time. Any weapon is viable since you get like up to 3x more sneak damage. Suppressed guns obviously are pretty good. I like knives and fist weapons also.
---
People don’t even join my team when we’re all killing ghouls together in Whitesprings, how am I going to add random people just in case I get disconnected lol
---
You asked why does everything that’s tough have to be rewarding. 
---
I answered that you’d have no reason to do anything hard without a reward, then I asked you to name one thing that you do that’s difficult which has no reward.
---
You responded with hiking
---
I pointed out that you DO get a reward for hiking, a mental serotonin boost. You yourself even mentioned that you get a sense of accomplishment. 
---
So my point is this: There is nothing that’s difficult that’s enjoyable with no reward.
---
Killing scorchbeasts neither gives you a reward in terms of loot or a reward in terms of pride/accomplishment. 
---
Do legendary enemies drop modified flare guns?
---
Why stop at fog crawler?
---
Just go full on Mirelurk queen. She's creepy enough lol 
---
looking for at least 3. how much and what are your hours? and time zone
---
Very disappointing update.
---
So it sounds like you are talking about an angled surface that is textured as a ladder.  Those work effectively like stairs and are not the same.  Something that looks like a ladder and what traditionally works like a ladder in games are two different things.
---
bethesda should just full out meme parody the game, would love to see long dog enemies, walking water purifiers, swarms of explosive bullets, long-limbed humanoids, enemies that are just floating armor penetration melee weapons, ghouls with long ass necks, robots that just talk about their soothing voice and repeatedly calling you 'MAAAAM' while fighting you, etc.
---
I am whelmed
---
Once upon a time I liked making my base (zero turrets) on the greens so new folks to the Whitespring would have a nice place to pitstop on their way in. Zero turrets, no where near the Clubhouse. After getting my base decimated on two separate occasions by higher level people "teaching me a lesson" I gave up and moved off property.
---
If you can find my base on your way into the Whitespring, you are more than welcome. Otherwise I'll keep my good will to myself because otherwise "Fallout Justice Warriors" swoop in to ruin the day.
---
Yeah right now I pretty much only get out of PA if I’m crafting. Heavy Weapons need to be Stabilized. 
---
The day you *marry* a Nintendo Entertainment System.
---
Not true
---
No that's false, you can cure and get mutations as many times as you like.
---
Just take the card again in a level up.
---
Is it from a mission? I got a grognak before. It didn't have any interesting visuals though. 
---
Sorry to hear about the group pounding, you must be sore
---
I just think they look neat lol. Plus a mirelurk queen would probably take up at least 60% budget
---
At this point I’m guessing they put a caps limit because they knew duplication was going to be an issue before release and wanted a bottleneck how many caps you could collect during exploitation. 
---
Yay end game “content”
---
It is an explosive the size of a bullet.
---
Also, what I'm saying is that SKILLs (Perks) that make you better with weapons, should not *increase the amount of damage you inflict upon* **yourself**.  That just wouldn't/doesn't make sense.
---
They learnt a lesson from their first patch. Don't drop notes before the patch is deployed as they jam in more from now till then.
---
I found barn plans in a safe inside a mine, and I found Gatling plasma in a safe in Watoga post office. Use that lock pick and revisit safes. It's cheap but with high luck it's worth it.
---
I used stealth, sniping, and land mines.  Killed everything.  I was level 30-ish at the time, but it scaled with me so I don't think I overpowered anything.
---
I don't agree with the criticism here, though I understand it. 
---
Personally, I've long seen Scorchbeasts as 'dick move' enemies. They exist mainly to mess with you, in particular, to mess with your access to certain locations. And I think this works, they still have value, and people just need to understand what their role is within the game.
---
Which leads me to another point: Not all baddies need to give great loot. I know this might blow some minds, but not everything boils down to kill shit -&gt; get loot in a game like this. In the case of Scorchbeasts I think it would be bad if they dropped great loot because then they'd just be farmed out by folks intent on little more than endgame power-balling, which would reduce their presence to mess with people who aren't capable of soloing them. And that would be be bad for the world environment and IMO negate their purpose.
---
So I think the real problem isn't scorchbeasts themselves, but rather the lack of actual endgame challenges. Bethesda has to either add in new enemies created specifically for endgame enthusiasts that are level 50+, or provide alternate skins of current enemies that, again, are fit marks for high level players.
---
I'm personally hoping that vaults will come out before long and provide what a lot of endgamers are looking for. I think it would be better if the level 50+ gear farm was kept to instanced content, so that the world can continue to be dangerous and, at times, unrewarding... because the point of some encounters \*should\* be to punish us a bit and make us run for the hills. ;) That way the game world remains populated with dangerous enemies but endgamers still get the thrill of hunting upgrades and more interesting fight tactics.
---
/2cents
---
You can get into harper's ferry without the tape. As the other person mentioned, MATN did it in his play through of the game, but I'm pretty sure there is also a different area near the back where it's really easy to get on top of the fence. Many areas have alternate entrances if you get creative enough. 
---
Yeah she is weak as fuck if no one else is really around. 
---
I bought mine so I could actually get some kills in whitesprings after I nuke it.  
---
Was tired of trying to melee everything.....\*bam\*.....whole squad of ghouls dead.  
---
Now I gets me my XP, heh heh heh
---
Be careful how many posts you make with video links, mods will ban you in a second. See rules .. just a fyi, I got unfairly banned from the fo4 sub just for displaying my settlements ..
---
This.
---
I've heard people say over 30 hours but I think the above pretty much is my experience.
---
If you're lucky someone else can spawn the area and not collect the plan - leaving it for you. But nearly everyone hits the common spots so if someone snatched it up while you were quick traveling..... It's gone.
---
There are maps of all the spawns. It's a lot more efficient to hit several spawns (there are actually quite a lot of them) than camp/hop one place.
---
Looks like you're wearing Buffalo Bills Zubaz!
---
Oh, my mistake then. I thought you were just a honest prankster. Turns out you're an ass after all. Happy travels douche.
---
True. Or if someone hasn't, they will eventually. 
---
Not true... and you can equip multiple mutations.  Using serums reduces the bad effects 
---
exactly which is why im not sure why your mad about it. you lose nothing lol. if they were destroying your base and stealing all your loot thats one thing.. but they arent. there is no griefing in this game. also i know for a fact this doesnt happen to you all the time. dude i have 300 hrs in and i havent experienced any griefing. so either youre actually an asshole and people dont like you, or youre blowing something that happened once way out of proportion and want bgs to create a safe space for you  
---
The problem is this will only benefit dupers, they just dupe and scrap as many as it takes to learn the mods then we will be in the same exact place
---
It's roughly 1 in 4. Supposed to be anyway, I've had better drops when I fight more than one at the same time as well as during scorched earth. 
---
It's not interloping anymore, it's here, home with its family &lt;3
---
I made myself a little Google spreadsheet of all the plans I've collected. All I need to do is update it regularly.
---
Is there a way for Bethesda (theoritically, not like I ever expect them to) wipe out duped weapons based on apparent origin or something?
---
I have seen some wild items/amounts of components dropped in suitcases and bags that I end up leaving.
---
As to WHY, in 3d modelling you can just slap any texture onto a model but it is likely to mis-apply and look wierd.  So they need to make  a specific texture that is appropriate (especially in shading) to the 3d object.  Plus  they have to make variants for any mods for that weapon or mix the original textures for the mods with the added weapon skin.
---
 I was really hoping for some ground breaking news. Instead we got the same ole same ole. I do consider myself a "fanboy" of the game. Lvl 204, over 350 hours played, but I'm starting to lose interest. I'm down to an hour or so a day and was really hoping this update would have something to look forward to. 
---
You're actually shooting yourself in the foot server hopping. Make a plan circuit from a map.
---
Hey, at least Mr.Messenger, despite getting 'stuck' every now and then, moves as fast as the player does so it's not an annoying/painful escort mission
---
Well, I kinda do need to clean the game room lol
---
Prison warden... that explains some I guess. You keep referring to “IRL”.... nothing about this forum is real life brother. Ease down lol
---
I saw that I hope they get DMCA taken down 
---
Monday needs to fix/clear or at least stop the duping, the amount of servers I join that are unstable because of greedy players is starting to get out of hand.
---
It indicates what the cost would be if you could craft it. Some people want as much information as possible, others want only the most pertinent.  Sorry for your loss.
---
If someone slaps me, why shouldn't I pop 'em?
---
Other players? If you don't want to accidentally hit another player you can put pacifist mode on in game settings, so you won't accidentally flag yourself on other players.
---
Was anyone really expecting they'd share useful information today?
---
Make flare guns and flares near zero weight.
---
Some guy upped the asshole ante by attacking me when I started killing "his" ghouls before the turrets. He kept standing in ghoul mobs so I would accidentally hit him and he could kill me for no penalty. This happened at least five times before I finally just quit the game for the day. Fucking jackass.
---
Yeah lol I found one on top of the Watoga Municipal Centre yesterday. 
---
Killing things in succession will net you more adrenaline the faster you swing the more stuff that dies in front of you
---
Unfortunately that had no effect, was one of the first things I tried. Perhaps it did fix the texture of the flooring in the build menu, I haven't looked yet, but in the Stored tab, the current state of that blueprint is still crashing the game client.
---
Please do.
---
This is quite lacking it’s an announcement before an announcement.
---
* chillax and explore
---
* scourer the map for the perfect C.A.M.P location (build away from your normal spots, i.e. instead of whitesprings build in ash heap or toxic valley. It's amazing what a difference this makes to overall enjoyment)
---
* help newbies and show them your favourite aspects of 76 (this could rekindle your love for the game)
---
You people are scum 
---
Literally acknowledged that in the post: " There's no way to play without using the PipBoy for inventory management, but I reject the use of the Pipboy light and the radio. I will however use the holotape function when necessary.  "
---
I see. Understandable point. 
---
Meh, I was expecting a little more insight (And at least some of the patch notes), but at least the patch is coming Monday. I'm sure we'll get some more details soon.
---
Just PLEASE fix the goddamn duping Monday...
---
You don't need mats to apply a mod that you already have, you only need mats to craft a mod.
---
Well, we'll likely never find common ground on this argument. Agree to disagree. 
---
I'm somewhere in the 80's, and running out of things to do. Hence why I was going to make an alt to try playing the game from a different perspective. But if that means having to start my CAMP from scratch, it is pretty unappealing. 
---
The servers are seeming to have a Lawnmower Man experience and causing very weird game issues.  
---
People have reported mannequins randomly appearing in camps, enemies are falling over dead when coming upon them and now this.
---
It’s a game.. sometimes you lose, welcome to real life kid?
---
I was having spawn issues at my camp as well. I moved my camp thing a few times and I now have a much better spawn location. Maybe play with that for now. I hope they in corporate the mats as well.
---
does it reduce the negative effects forever or for a limited time?  i want marsupial so bad but run an intelligence build.  ive been using a jetpack x01 but man power armor feels so clunky
---
I actually love rping as an arms dealer its the only thing that has saved this game for me since no real endgame exists.  I farm/buy/sell/and trade almost everything and it makes it more fun and i get to meet lots of cool players
---
Good points. Thanks!
---
On sunday I was playing for about 8 hours. These are the results (I am not kidding unfortunately): 7 bluescreen crashes, 3 server disconnects, 3 freeze frames followed by a complete restart and 3 „controls disabled messages followed by a server disconnect.... that makes it a crash every 30 minutes. As much as I enjoy this game, this is simply unacceptable and anshame for the developer.
---
Idk why people are freaking out. Aren't most patch notes vauge until release? Nms was vauge as shit and still is when it comes to patches. Same with mhw sometimes. I guess cod can get away with 30 gig patches at random with no explanation as well??? 
---
I'm too capricious to be able to tell you today  what I will do tomorrow.
---
Bethesda: "What was that 500 per color? With a bundle set at 3500 saying it's a "great value" we hear you loud and clear"
---
For the fallout classic thing in the bethesda launcher do i need to download each thing individually or is there a bundle?
---
White knight perk.  3pts of Agi.  If you can afford to wear it all the time, 90% less condition damage.
---
Can't afford to wear it all the time?  Still get it.  Drops repair mats to just 1 BF.
---
I treated Ballistic Fiber like gold before now I skip or sell it off.
---
Not sure where to get that tbh
---
So um... yeah, we'll try and do something next week then.. um... well, we'll nerf the damage on some legendaries coz we can't fix it now so we'll fix it with code so we'll take a super sledge to it instead. That's 'fun', right?
---
Oh and... um... well. Enjoy the DC's and duping for another week!
---
Just ghouly stuff 😌
---
I'd advise against using too many missile turrets because the rocket spam makes it more difficult to keep track of where bodies fall, and murders the framerate. From what I've seen, just a few heavy minigun turrets work best if you're going for exp.
---
There's an entire part of the lore about how the Free States created a device that forced scorchbeasts to land, and even an actual event you can do that summons a grounded scorchbeast with that device... yet we can't actually use something like that anywhere else
---
Starched Genes does allow you to use Rad-Away as it says on the card, but you need the 2 points in it for it to always work. The first point only gives you a chance, the second is never.
---
Wow. That's completely worthless. 
---
New year same awful communication.
---
This would cause a lot of LAG
---
No XB1. Sometimes enemies will just attack you at you at the Vendor
---
This was like same disappointing as F76.
---
If you use rifles, look for one of the Scorch Killer receivers. You get the 10mm SMG and 10mm Pistol from the Firebreather quest, I believe. I had a gap in my loadout, and decided to fill it with a 10mm SMG with Scorch Killer, mainly for scorched hordes. I noticed the happy little side effect, that it chews through SBs like nothing else. Once they land or I can get a good line on it, I take it out in two magazines (56 10mm bullets). If you can get any other buffs on top of the perk cards, you'll make mincemeat of the SBs. 
---
I used to think the SK receivers were too situational for real use, but they really carve out a niche here. They function as really good anti-SB weapons and can one or two shot most scorched, which helps out conserving ammo and resources. In my experience, they're well worth the extra weight for that benefit.
---
As other have said, you can get the mutation back no problem. You should look into mutation farming! There are plenty of guides. After a few tries I got 5 mutations I liked and then equiped starched genes rank 2. Saved me almost 20k caps
---
you are awesome :)   we give away our extra plans too.   handmade are hard to come by.  that player may have never found them if you hadn't helped. 
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who is getting this!
---
I wonder if we ever get beta testing servers for patches, because I am little worried about the new content patches that are getting nearer. 
---
Probably not, but it could be a good idea.
---
I have to admit - I gave them credit yesterday for at least being more communicative by stating the blog would be delayed until today...but you really needed an extra day for this?  Again, I appreciate the increased communication, but there’s no value there to the community if it’s just “various fixes are coming” every blog post. If they’re testing the PVP mode internally, there has to be at least some high level information they can provide at this point(ex. if there will be separate servers)
---
Sorry I should of said I am on ps4.
---
Maybe I'm the exception, but my priority is setting up a CAMP that has all my crafting tables, a small farm to make veg starch, a water purifier (I camp near a water source) and an extractor (I also try to build on a lead or steel deposit to replenish my ammo).  That, plus some turrets leaves me almost no room at all for purely decorative items- the only one I have is the glow in the dark map of Appalachia near my bed.  
---
So I have no budget to make the place really look cool- just functional.  I'm not sure I'd really care anyway, since they won't let me decorate with items I find in the game.  I can't (to my knowledge) make display plaques to hang my "retired' weapons on the wall, so I end up being forced to scrap them because I can't spare room in my stash either.  And if I find cool stuff like garden gnomes in the game, I can't decorate with them either since there's no way to "place' them.  And the little paper sacks they drop in aren't very decorative. 
---
I *assume* this is to make the game work because it's online and maybe 2 dozen other players are in the same world, so the server doesn't crash from having to render too many objects in a cell.  Unfortunately it still ends up crashing multiple times a day anyway.  I really wish Bethesda would have just made this a single player game so they wouldn't have to make all these sacrifices for MMO functionality I didn't want.  After I beat FO4, I made a new guy and focused entirely on settlement building.  That became the game for me, making little cities and decorating them with authentic touches.  In FO76, the CAMP is just a quick operating base (***unless*** you don't want turrets), and there's no room to have fun with design.  
---
I wish I could talk to my friends about something like this but they would never understand 
---
The real dicks are people like you making posts like this.
---
All you can do is ignore them server hop 
---
Ah, ok.  Was wondering if there was some type of status check I had never seen before.
---
they wont have any really cool stuff until all the bugs are killed, but i can wait....it takes me away, and theres a lot of things i want to find/do.
---
thx couldn't figure this out
---
I’m not sure how marsupial or TSE will affect the event itself? It’s not a pvp event and items wouldn’t be hidden anywhere where any type of advantage would be needed. Completely passive, no weapons, items hidden in containers in a designated area. 
---
You can do this, in a way. You can move your CAMP (as in the item itself) without actually moving your "camp" location (ie the circle stays in the same spot). Just walk up and move it like any other item.
---
While you don't spawn exactly on the CAMP device, your spawn location is tied to it (somehow). Try moving it around your camp to a couple different spots and see if it gives you a better spawn spot. It's not ideal but it's better than having to scale a cliff every time 
---
Clueless Level over 9000
---
Serums reduce the negative effects of the mutation for one hour, then it’s back to normal. 
---
I'll dupe you one! /s
---
Sounds like you haven't been reading the blog posts!
---
It's brief, but I imagine we'll get more details closer to the estimated time frame they gave us.
---
[https://bethesda.net/en/article/6Gmr5HkkEgOY2k8qyey4M8/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-december-19-2018](https://bethesda.net/en/article/6Gmr5HkkEgOY2k8qyey4M8/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-december-19-2018)
---
They respecd and moved all of their points out of conscience and buisiness ethics
---
Another telling sign if you drop frames like crazy, and I mean crazy. 
---
thank you for clarification :)
---
The main pvp danger (if you don't hit back and haven't claimed a workshop)  is dying because you have other damage. If she was damaged from fighting radrats then yeah, even slap damage will eventually kill her.  My daughter plays too and health, eating, drinking etc are the hardest for her to manage. 
---
As others on the thread have said, while you do run into a jerk now and then, most players are pretty nice and helpful. 
---
No problem : )
---
Jokes on you, Toddy wants EVERYONE'S money. 
---
+1 to other posters here.  Great for soloing, pvp, non-nuked content.
---
It’s really whether you want a methodical, calm, controlled experience of mostly one-shotting things and rarely being shot at, or a more hectic but fast-paced engagement where you run in or run around, take hits and put things down.  They are both fun in different ways.
---
One thing I can say about the sniping build though is weight was a constant challenge, while my melee alt has carry to spare
---
We know one vault is near completion but I doubt it'll be this month. February is my guess
---
"And that was how a new faction was born" annnnd I have a new aspiration, lol. Or should I say ME-Ooooogghhhcchh
---
And a the text "we know" below the blue hand.
---
turns out some of my notes turned into lead scrap or fiberglass spool then spawned another not in my inventory, i now have 93 lead scrap and 100 fibreglass spools
---
This company ,i swear !!!! Just WOW ...
---
Just another example of armor they cut and then will reintroduce for probably a stupid amount of money (I'm betting $8).
---
The greed of Todd Howard and this company is quickly ruining any goodwill I have left for it.
---
Wow i though those were just bugs like an exploded turret or a land mine. 
---
You think Division 2's release will be like Division 1? Division had VERY similar problems to FO76
---
With those server connects I've noticed after a patch that Bethesda tries to fix dupe exploits in it get much more stable till some jaggof goes out and posts how to dupe now, then the stability goes down again, the correlation is enough to point toward causation, but without enough data I can't say for 100% certain that's the issue
---
Another thing that causes the stability issues is when people decided to 'log cycle' at places like the Whitespring to force respawn ghouls/bots during nukes
---
Pc
---
*sighs* hi.  We decided not to fix the bugged enemies.  We decided that you guys really are not worth the time.
---
Here is one. Anyone who prepurchased the game on all platforms will get all dlcs free.  That would be worth something. Specially since some of us spent nearly $90usd on this turd in the punchbowl.
---
I bought the advanced connectors the other night and immediately did a very similar thing with the garage doors! Took my buddy and I an hour to figure out and even then I had to string wires through a window 😂
---
I think they made some changes after BETA, but what I'm more asking is how many hours can a server be up and Bethesda matchmaking still put new players into it.  At some point, I believe that stops and Bethesda just waits for it to be nearly empty then destroys that instance.
---
I wasn't on a spawn point, at least not **that** close to one.  I've decided to just ignore cool looking camps and do the cheesy drop a turret tower everywhere crap that most everyone else does until it gets addressed.
---
The problem seems to be, after watching these particular spawns before I moved my CAMP, is that whether you are anywhere near them or not, they seem to always patrol towards the closest player, hidden or not, to see if they succeed in detecting you.
---
I might be wrong, but that has been my anecdotal experience.
---
Confirmed got plans for it at the drop site c2 last nite!
---
Ouch
---
Scorchbeasts are meant to be tough, and you are supposed to find a way to beat them, such as finding a weapon that can do this: [https://i.imgur.com/Z0saKWW.gifv](https://i.imgur.com/Z0saKWW.gifv) .  Look for legendary weapons (by beating legendary enemies).  I got this Two Shot Dragon rifle that deals 1600 damage from a level 71 legnedary deathclaw.
---
No it doesn’t take long for a taller puke to kill a noob/lowbie.
---
Not doing anything and engaging them is stupid.
---
Ignore and server hop. Or face revenge kills.
---
It’s a waste of time engaging in PvP for lowbie.
---
So what stopped them posting this yesterday? Another sh*t post.
---
I really want custom radio stations and custom signs like in rust. Also I see why they wouldn't add this it could lead to some noclip exploits 
---
There would be a notice days in advance so the people who do want to do it could do it. 
---
Speak for yourself, I have no great interest in either of those games. Lots of people manage to happily switch between multiple games anyway.
---
I’ll happily keep playing Fallout 76, even if I was to get one of those two. 
---
??? No it isn't, nowhere NEAR. 
---
With full mutations, 15 strength and 45% damage perks, you break 200 on a heavy melee weapon only. Slow, cumbersome and with full perks dedicated to it, able to deal some damage. 
---
Unarmed comes out higher with its full perks and mutations, but cannot be used with Power Armour. 
---
TSE is equal to this as base damage. Full perks pushing an automatic ranged weapon to equal damage people shot as a sledgehammer? Really? This is balanced to you?
---
Maybe use those guns correctly and see how insanely overpowered they are. 
---
How is babby made?
---
yup
---
Make an alt, that’s what I did.  Haven’t touched my level 102 in a week.  I’d say all the best content and fun is for leveling and exploring at the moment 
---
These games are literally nothing like Fallout. Anthem looks generic af and will probably be another typical lootbox riddled shitfest from EA and Division is more likely a competitor for Destiny 2 than Fallout 76. 
---
Irrelevant Post, tbh.
---
Very well done! 
---
Hey - more info than we had before. Thanks!
---
I really don't get the part about Perk cards, what's the problem about them? I know some of them are broken, like Class Freak not affecting Energy weapon damage reduction correctly, but it's really not a top priority.
---
But if they fix duping for good that would be worth the waiting.
---
I third this. In FO4 stealth was king. In FO76 I'm more useful with a shotgun/enforcer and melee build. I still need folks to help me knock SB's out of the air, but once they're down a shotgun to the face keeps enemies stunned and staying in place until you can kill them. 
---
yeah I don't mean crashing, but the worlds are destroyed by Bethesda servers when they become empty (and sometimes they will kick out the last couple of characters).  So I'm just curious how long they let new players enter servers before diverting them to newer instances.
---
&gt;Only thing I’m worried about is the player population on PC being low
---
not a problem
---
Omg that is why. Thanks a lot for this. 
---
Get 5 Luck. Get the 2 perk cards designed for mutations and get all the good with little/none of the bad on mutations.
---
The Serums are worth it if you plan on running a lot of mutations. Random the first 4 hoping you get the specific ones you want, then buy the serums to safely build the rest of your mutation kit.
---
another tip:
---
if you see a wendigo..RUN
---
... like that’s gonna happen
---
To be fair, the Road Leathers from the earlier games were straight-up modelled on Mad Max, belted up and with the torn arm.
---
Don't really know why they stitched that arm back on.
---
I’m sorry for your loss
---
Let me know if you still need help tonight. I can’t find you some level 50 T60 pretty quick. I’ll be on around 7pm Mountain time. 9 eastern
---
Its pc only...
---
And from what I've heard RD online would never be able to justify that price. 
---
Mine seems fine at 21:9
---
"We've noticed a bug where some vendors did not carry the plans to build the Single Action Revolver Ivory Grip. This will be corrected, so that all vendors will carry multiple copies."
---
crap, and here i was stashing tons of that in my stash. i'll go clean it out after work today.
---
I didn't mention it in the post but I have to other people , building a base with no turrets is great , it gives players a place to rest while fighting in say a nuke zone , the problem is people with turrets being a nuisance just watch out and try and make the camp look friendly so people will think twice before destroying it 👍
---
/r/fo76filthycasuals
---
Yeah it sucks, because I know they're going to put one of the coolest looking outfits in as a cash shop and I'm going to have to dump all my pooled atoms on it because it's my favorite look from fallout 4
---
They literally give us this information about future information because people complained that they weren’t communicating enough.... What else can they do?
---
Thanks friend, I appreciate it, but I got it taken care of! Just had to make the rounds for a couple days.  Did move the camp so I don't have to fight a scorchbeast or two within 10 minutes of logging/fast traveling, though.
---
I haven't tried downloading the Bethesda client on my PC yet to see if I qualify, but I play the PS4 version, and in order to play I had to create and log into a Bethesda account on my PS4...
---
I stopped playing because of this. 
---
vault suit reduces prices??
---
Did anyone else read this in a Colonel Gutsy voice?
---
There are people playing Fallout that are even *more zealous* about keeping the Whitespring totally C.A.M.P. free than you are about keeping the "turret jerks" away from the clubhouse.
---
They also have better weapons and can one shot me instantly with their "Two Shot Explosive Shotguns".
---
There is literally no winning to this situation thanks to the game design, and I'm done trying to compete with it as it just results in me having to go farm a ton of scrap just to repair my base.
---
For one, I'll admit this does heavily depend on your build, but I'm gonna put generic advice that people 'cross-spec' into a little bit of a 'farming' build to go along with their 'main' build.  
---
One of the most under-rated perks in this game is licensed plumber, and for your day to day farming, I strongly suggest using a pipe weapon with some sort of easy to make ammo, like .38... Alternatively you can spec into melee, and if you do again I recommend using a pipe weapon so you can use licensed plumber to prevent your weapon from breaking, and make repairs EXTREMELY cheap.  
---
For armor you're going to want White Knight, it's a staple for sustainable gaming, and anyone 'farming' for equipment in this game using power armor either duped a ton of fusion cores, or isn't all that bright. It's not hard to farm fusion cores mind you, but the fact that you're making it so you have to is just more of a waste of time then you should be dedicating to that when normal armor is more than adequate for anything other then the Scorchbeast Queen or Nuclear Zones in general.
---
When you reach level 50 you will definitely want Super Duper, even if you don't have a luck build, just because it's such an amazing perk, and if you are using ammo and not melle, you absolutely need Ammosmith. At high levels it's worth it to buy a legendary pipe weapon with exploding/doubleshot/instigating/bloodied/armor piercing/ or something that will make a good all purpose farming weapon. Alternatively if ammo is your issue and your running a rifle build it might be worth it to run a .50 variant so you can benefit from 180 (Or 360 occasionally with super duper) rounds per craft.   
---
With a properly specced alternative farming build everything costs nothing to repair, you practically never have to repair, you either never run out of ammo, or almost never run out of ammo, and you pretty much can play constantly. Farming is a thing of the past at this point as you get supplies passively to help your main build, and you only use that when you're dealing with major events.   
---
As for farming of important items:  
---
\- Pleasant Valley Ski Resort (1/24 hours) - \~60 Aluminum
---
\- Wendigo Cave - 5-8 screws per run, takes about 5 min. once you get the hang of it.
---
\- Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast - 10-14 springs &amp; acid/ run 5 min. (Killing Yua Guais)
---
\- Abandoned Waste Dump - 10-14 gears/ run 5 min. (Killing Deathclaws)
---
\- Big Bend Tunnel - 100-300 steel/run 10 min. (Killing Scorched/Scrapping Weapons)
---
For Adhesive go to Cobbleton Farm, get Tatos/Corn/Mutfruit, plant 6 of each in your camp, along with some water purifiers, make sure you get the green thumb perk, and use Super Duper. Every hour or so that will give you 12-16 Adhesive by making Vegetable Starch and breaking it down.  
---
For Lead I recommend building your camp on a lead deposit, google their locations, and drop your camp on top of one, it's about 14 lead every 20 minutes or so, but it's better than any other means I've found other then farming weighs once a day (That will get you about 120/day, you can farm weights from gyms at all three Missile Silos, Vaul-Tec University has 2 Gyms, Green Country Lodge has a Gym, and there are a 'few' weights inside the  Palace of the Winding Path and the Charleston Fire Department).  
---
If you need help with any other items I didn't list feel free to message me. Being well versed on the location of resources is kind of what I do.  
---
Can we even replace the Mistress stuff?
---
Quantum X01 - post launch
---
HotRod - ATOM store
---
Vim,sugar bombs etc - post launch.
---
Pretty sure yea 
---
They announced last year that everyone will get the DLC for free. That is because there will be NO dlc or very shitty ones. Just look at how much they fixed since the BETA and you'll realize they can't handle shit DLC
---
By that logic melee weapons should be dramatically weaker, automatics should be dramatically better than semi-automatic, and heavy/explosive weapons should be better than everything.
---
Pistols have always been viable in Fallout games, but the balance matters more now that this is an online game
---
 You're welcome. Not sure if it was me or another player, but my buddy and I already have those plans and I found them in a container when turning in technical data. 
---
Also I always drop unwanted items ammo plans etc in the Watoga right register.
---
As much as I'd hate to admit it, the TSE thing needs a nerf. The fact that I am still using a level 15 single explosive shotgun at level 140 is silly. 
---
Eh, C.A.M.P. is an acronym for "Construction and Assembly Mobile Platform."
---
We're supposed to be rebuilding the wasteland, not making smores, but if that's how YOU want to play, go for it, man.  You do you.
---
\+1. For DAKA-DAKA kind of game experience TSE 50Cal works ok, but 95% of the time it's all the sneak perks and cold-blooded oneshots with silenced weaponry. Wanna add melee in future, it's more pun.
---
I have 2 toons under 1 account and noticed that the atomic cafe stuff carries over to both.
---
They’re 1/2 way to being able to share gear among toons
---
Goal is: garb and blade 
---
15 str. 15 agility 
---
Maxed : blocker, barbarian, lone wanderer, evasive, iron clad, martial artist, and sneak
---
Should give over 200 DR with 20% damage reduced by everything and melee damage reduced by 45%
---
With this I’ll never have to repair armor again
---
Because of the time wasted loading? Or some other reason?
---
No
---
We have half horizontal. You mean vertically half?
---
Awesome thank you, I'll add it with asterisks for now, and go explore it.
---
If I loot the legendary junk before the item spawns in the table, will it just stay empty? 
---
My household is pretty darn quiet but I still use push to talk. Wish more folk did the same. 
---
 Ive heard it's still possible to one shot people on pacifist.  I haven't tried, but i can get my bloodied super sledge to 2k+ damage with unyeielding gear on.  I feel like it's possible.
---
LOL! 
---
I can't see how people survive on hot pockets! But yes to the input/output part.
---
I'm interested. I haven't done any roleplaying really, but I'm willing to give it a shot. Sounds like it could be a lot of fun.
---
counts as scrap, if scrap everything is destroyed 
---
I concur.
---
Especially with the way he's responding to people that disagree. 
---
Hey thats my move! 
---
But jokes aside i dont use fb so i would never have even known it was there lol. I dont use twitter either. Tbh i thought the biggest vocal community for fo76 was Reddit so i assumed they would have posted, you know?
---
Really excited for the update! New Year New Bethesda! 
---
It gets scrapped if you press "Scrap all junk", after nuke zones, always drop your hardened mass first, then scrap all junk.
---
At first i thought this might have been me.  i was running around and decided to stop into a train station to store junk.  saw a level 30 crafting on a bench and checked what the vendor had.  hear a scuffle and see the level 30 being chased by a 22 Reaver and 42 Wendigo.  i pulled out my Sledge and helped out and after they were both dead the level 30 was super cautious so i waved hello and he waved back.
---
didnt realize this wasnt me till you got dunked on.  sorry, bro.  Raider Scum is the worst
---
That would ruin the entire game.
---
Be sure when you use a serum to un-equip the starched genes perk, as that prevents you from gaining and losing mutations. Once you use the serum, equip that card again.
---
I have done a few tests right after Release.  I kill a bunch of mole rats in workshop.  Cook half the meat and logout for the night.  I log back in next day and sometimes the cooked food has less condition than meat itself and both are below 50%.
---
Hardened Mass is considered "Junk" and it will get scrapped.Just DON'T scrap junk after roaming nuke sites.
---
Well my friend is talking me into it. He doesn’t have it yet, but it’s one of those things that’s like “If you get it, I’ll get it.” We’ll probably pick it up, and if we do, is the Deluxe edition even worth it? 
---
All good here. You posted this publicly, I'm sure you knew that some would react to what you're doing as less than stellar behavior. I'm surprised you even commented. 
---
Btw the cleaning your room comment was NOT  calling you a kid. It's something from Jordan Peterson. Too obscure, I guess. 
---
Hardened masses are labelled as junk. So, if you "Scrapped All," you could have lost it that way. Or, I believe, it can be auto-scrapped for parts out of your stash. It's similar to the problems you see with people complaining about their mods getting scrapped. =( Sorry for your loss dude, I lost some mods this way before I realized what was happening. 
---
With the perk that lets you find extra chems in containers, then the one gets you better prices at vendors. You can make a steady stream of caps just by selling your extras. 
---
I wrote up a quick rundown/cost analysis for mutations when I was trying to decide what to get. Here's my build, I've grabbed all mutations excluding Empath, Herd Mentality and Herb/Carn. Class Freak is a must have for sure, but you're right, depending on how you go, it's a -2 Str result. I use Party Girl to triple my alcohol effects and I'm pretty much permanently drunk, so the Str drop is not a factor for me:
---
Str -2
---
Per 0
---
End 0
---
Cha 0
---
Int +5
---
Agi +3
---
Luc 0
---
Adrenal -- Max HP -12.5 -- optional: lifegiver perk, 1st level gives +15
---
Bird Bones -- Str -1 -- optional perks: Radcool, Party boy/girl + professional drinker -- carry weight loss also countered by Marsupial(+10 after factoring strength decrease).
---
Chameleon -- Weightless armor(check your vendors, everyone sells this stuff and you can find some pretty good pieces)
---
Eagle Eyes -- Str -1 -- optional: Radcool, Party boy/girl + professional drinker -- carry weight loss also countered by Marsupial(+10 after factoring strength decrease).
---
Egg Head -- Str -.75 End -.75 -- no effect, rounded down.
---
Electrically charged -- Grounded's Energy Resistance
---
Grounded -- Energy Damage -12.5% -- optional: various damage perks -- This mutation is totally optional, the energy resistance is nice, but there are other ways to build your resistance without the reduction to damage.
---
Healing Factor -- Chem Effects -13.75% -- nothing really counters effect, but healing is totally worth it.
---
Marsupial -- Int -1 -- with Egg Head(Int ends up at +5!)
---
Plague Walker -- frankly a lot of diseases suck, still avoid them, but if you happen to have one, it gives area damage increasing with amount of diseases you have.
---
Scaly Skin -- AP -12.5 -- +30 AP from Bird Bones -- +17.5 AP overall
---
Speed Demon -- Hunger/Thirst +12.5% -- optional: All night long -20% hunger/thirst on first level
---
Talons -- Agi -1 -- Bird Bones(Agi ends up at +3)
---
Twisted Muscles -- Gun accuracy -12.5% -- Increased Vats accuracy with Agi boost from bird bones(however much 3 agi gives?)
---
Unstable Isotope -- Damage to player -- unknown, very small amount, unavoidable damage(scaly skin counters this to an extent)
---
Herd Mentality -- may be worth taking as well as the end result would be -.5 to all special, which if it works like the other mutations would round down to nothing. I haven't tested yet, but someone else may be able to confirm?
---
Empath -- There was a bug with this one that wasn't reducing the negative effect with Class Freak, not sure if it's fixed, but I play in a group often enough to justify getting this one.
---
Herb/Carnivore -- There is benefit to this, I haven't decided if I want to bother yet, but right now leaning toward herb, since you can have constant food with a garden and cooked meat sells for tons(which I usually have aplenty).
---
I made a post yesterday about exactly that
---
I haven't done it... so i think i will not play the trilogy then..
---
The trilogy is pc only but console players can claim it too for their pc's.
---
I already own 76, and I have almost no gaming budget.. why would i spend another $60 instead of just enjoying what I have? Nah I'll wait until those games are on sale :)
---
White knights to the rescueeeeeer
---
The division is a prime example of how pvp can be more broken than fallout's is. Anthem is completely new so I don't want to say anything bad about it.
---
It's nice to hear and I feel bad for being so hard on them and the game sometimes. I know they are probably working their butts off trying to fix stuff that is probably difficult to fix. While also coming up with new content etc. It must be difficult for them working hard and getting so much scrap, but I hope they don't lose their motivation and don't take peoples ranting personally as people are just frustrated and forget about the real people who are working hard to make the games we enjoy.
---
I think what spawns is related to your location. I was formerly in a place where the predominant spawn was Super Mutants. 
---
Now it is radrats ... lots and lots of radrats ... and they love to eat my Porta Potty ... go figure.
---
If you're server hopping one or two spots you'll spend hours wasted in loading screens. Run the circuit and skip the plans you already have. And, everyone hates this idea for some reason, remember that plans can come from events along with caps, legendaries, stimpaks, etc.
---
I think the point here is removing duplicate weapons that are TSE. you get to keep one of each flavor, and then play fairly to earn more.  if people sell them online so be it. The quantity would be limited.
---
Thanks! Guess I’ll have to start collecting the two handed damage perk cards if I wanna reach max melee dps 
---
Like they arent losing already.
---
The Tricentennial edition? Honestly that only gives you a few skins, really isn't worth it IMO unless you really dig those skins. I used them for my first week and haven't really thought about them since. 
---
&gt; Deluxe edition even worth it
---
Nope. A few skins. Not worth it.
---
Abandon ship I’m betting. They will leave a light on for the Atom Shop team though.
---
Only after 4 hours.
---
darn it!  Apparently "death bags" do not function the same as player dropped bags.  To test this, I killed myself at my camp to generate a death/junk bag, which was easily visible on a rock.  Standing nearby I dropped a bobby pin, and it generated a 2nd bag, instead of combining it with the death bag.  
---
Actually, the first time I dropped a bobby pin, it was removed from my MISC inventory, and no bag appeared.  It wasn't there and it wasn't invisible either, it was just...gone.   The second time I dropped a pin it generated a bag with one pin in it.  Obviously there are multiple bugs happening - some dropped items just disappear, other bags go invisible.  SMH.
---
Should be able to. You need +charisma to share out each point.
---
12 charisma total?
---
Start using armor?  Are you about to start using power armor?  
---
If so, Power Patcher is the perk for that, but it's a lvl 44 perk.  I would say use Scrapper, but I believe it's still broken.  
---
So, what you want to do is pick what items you are hunting for.  Get the items you want to search for, like springs and screws (just one is needed), go into your inventory, junk items, component view and mark those.  Anything that contains marked items will show a magnifying glass next to its name.  This way you can target what you want and ignore what you don't.
---
Haha, yea, I think their Atomic Cafe would go down in flames if you had to pick and choose which character got the skin / whatever you were buying. 
---
Tragic
---
Noooo! Pick up herd mentality! Those -2s across the board dont hit you if you have 3 class freak, and if your in a group it's all plus 2.  Anything less than one rounds down.
---
If we can i don't know how very sad moment...
---
Great post. To help you out on the receivers, you can find one on a corpse on the West entrance to Big Bend tunnel, and the other support plan on the East entrance to the Big Bend tunnel. The Assault rifle plan is on the computer at the Fire Breathers Fire House Station main terminal. Read through a few of the terminals messages and it should be the 3rd option, then the first option iirc. Thank you for posting!
---
I guess my sarcasm was unfortunately accurate.
---
You can just kill your team mates to clear the bounty.
---
You can hid in your teammates base with a bounty and when the bounty hunter/revenge comes to collect they get flagged when they pick the lock on the door/break the door down/orbital strike the base... the base own then tosses a grenade into the mix and poof no more bounty hunter thanks to broken pvp. 
---
I was at lake side cabins and some level 130 dude comes along and trys to take it from my team mate, kills him in one shot cause we were both standing in the claim zone, i forget im in passive mode. 
---
i flip out of it and then two shot him with my croquet mallet (which is actually a sledge hammer with the heat/bleed mod and the skin from the atom shop).
---
dude comes back and then kills me in one shot from full health... 
---
yeah pvp is broken, so i trade to get some TSE legendary weapons and am making a broken pvp character so i can use him to regrief people that do the same to me... i want to have fun(read FAIR) pvp but honestly thats not the case anymore. time to use the in game mechanics to your advantage. 
---
As far as caps and flags, if you can solo people you need a buddy with a base you can port to when you need to clear you bounty, just port back to their base and have them kill you to collect the bounty. the caps never leave your group. 
---
You port back to their base and not your base, they need to make sure their camp station is hidden so others cant find out who owns the base. 
---
I would suggest it was worse
---
No, at least not yet.
---
They would be marginally better if they didn’t spam that god damn sonic attack. I can’t see or aim straight when they use it.
---
They don't even have programmers. All they have are some modders
---
I'd wait for a few more patches, unless you can get it on a big sale right now.
---
idgaf
---
You can always make an alt to do the quests at 50
---
Can I just say....You look utterly ***radiant*** today
---
May I also add, golf is really working out for ya....looking THICCCCCCCCCC
---
I can get that on my hefty pc rig on a fresh server.  I think there are still some poorly written AI code causing it too.
---
\&gt; mobile
---
&gt; Anyone else have disappearing Hardened Mass?'
---
That's what she said
---
Could be panda represents China?
---
You're probably better off for it, honestly.
---
Mutant suppressing syringer ammo
---
On Monday we will be doing a patch that will fix perks, bugs, weapons, and exploits!
---
Then the patch after that will deal with exploits, weapons, bugs, and perks!
---
Their creative writing team is also their patch notes team.
---
You're right, but I think a rocket powered chunk of metal will still do more damage than a 10mm pistol. Automatic vs semi auto should do the same because its literally the same gun, it's just for balancing purposes. And explosives already do the most damage so idk what you're argument is there. Pistols are still viable in this game, the .44 cal pistols do more damage than most rifles, people just suck at aiming and dont like the small ammo capacity that pistols have. There is literally nothing to complain about except for pistols are the only class that doesnt get additional armor penetration aside from shotguns but that makes sense
---
It should be tied to your Bethesda account either way.  So any time you decide to download and log into the game on your PC it'll be there.
---
I define the walls differently than you, but yes. 
---
I guess gear will fix it is one way to look at it.  I have a Dragon, not a two-shot (8-shot?!), and I CAN take them down, it just isn't worth the effort, and they are annoying af around CAMP.
---
I've given up on the places I was trying to be until they maybe someday get addressed, but these guys still show up and harrass low-level areas so gear isn't an issue for their trolling behavior.
---
I get better loot from Scorchbeast Guano Piles
---
To be honest, I’d pay for DLC content of Bethesda needed to add resources in order to deliver content fixes sooner. 
---
This is awesome, but where is it tho?
---
It is available for 11€ now, not really much you can do wrong at this price level. 
---
:( no go then unless mycrosoft and Sony become best of friends in the next minute
---
I don't career referrer *continues quests* see ya
---
Yeah, i guess i didnt look hard enough. 
---
Hoarding is a Fallout thing man, in Fo3 and Fo NV i hoarded armor and weapons, maybe a few unique items (rad rockets and dinos) and tons of nuka cola. I always liked collecting in all Bethesda games like Skyrim. The thing is, they put items in to be collected, they put armor stands, book cases, tables, and an open world full of objects. Sure its a survival game but its an rpg too 
---
bwhahahahahaha yesssss
---
Pretty sure it is, someone was mentioning with the unlimited bobbleheads you can get some insane amount of damage, people are 1 shoting the queen, so yeah I think it is possible as well, just rare. This needs to be fixed or give s real passive mode so it can't happen to people who are not interested in pvp mode. To be honest this what pacifist should be, people turning on a option to basically say no to PVP.
---
Download the Bethesda Launcher and log in. See if you have them
---
Your estimate is missing a "0" at the end.
---
Are you paying money for photos of said sniper? Maybe for your newpaper?
---
dead emperor's lapdogs
---
Basically "Patch is coming 14th" What an joke. I expected them to actually share what is coming in January, like they told in December patches.
---
...i realize it's a lot more efficient, that's why I had originally put a caveat on the post, so people would know it was mostly a joke. 
---
For me, the most satisfying feeling is blasting a scorchbeast into oblivion with my Zealot's .50 cal. I feel like Animal Mother yelling "GET SOME!"
---
I think that quote is more about the circlejerk over this game, I think that makes sense bc if he went on r/fallout or something it would just be like “76 Bad game do not buy xD” but r/fo76 is majority people who own the game and have better insight. 
---
Hmm.  Here I just thought if I logged into a server and the usual plan wasn't there (like say... the Flatwoods Armor bench) that just meant that someone else picked it up.
---
I was under the impression that items inside containers were unique to each player, but items laying ontop things, out in the open, were visible for everyone and distributed on a "First Come, First Serve" basis.
---
Am I wrong in my original though, or misinterpreting your write up?
---
West of Watoga train station near the parking area. its one very specific assault tron that has that issue so i just avoid it. 
---
I have played everything Bethesda has released in the last 5 years and loved most of it.  I try to be an informed buyer. The information I have says the game is crap and The few hours of gameplay I watched tell me the same thing.  76 is not a quality game.  It has multiple game breaking bugs and limited content.  If I could rent it, I would.  I can’t so maybe I will wait for it to be on sale for $10.   That said, y’all still haven’t said anything good about the game.  
---
things is there is tons of skins already from fallout 4. so they could of they wanted to.
---
take that handmade rifle for instance, in fallout4 nuka world it came with a default of 3 selectable skins (no mods or that Bethesda workshop thing)
---
in f76 the handmade has no selectable skins
---
same goes for all the power armors.
---
in the base f4 game power armor had tons of skins/colors to choose from but in f76 there are almost none.
---
Built my base under an overpass that’s going over a creek. I spawn INSIDE the overpass. I haven’t gotten stuck yet and am able to easily walk through. While inside the scenery is visible but very very simple. No textures really. Very odd. 
---
praise southpark.
---
Sounds good, will give it a go shortly!
---
Bloody games done the dame thing to me over and over again im giving this game miss for awhile until they sort it i was so close to my controller going through the screen 
---
Like everything else it depends on sellers.  For years I got 10-20 $ rolling discount from amazon.  Big box stores it wasn't uncommon to discount either.
---
Why does it matter to you, it has absolutely no affect on you or your game If I turn on pacifist mode. They only reason you disagree is you still want to kill people who have zero interest in pvp. Pvp and non pvp players can co-exist without affecting each others game play.
---
Die.
---
Worth a try I guess.
---
I would love to use the power houses that are spread around the map. But there's the same problem with having a DC....
---
Most of the time it happens to me when I'm back at my camp, so I have to fast travel again to that workshop &gt;_&lt;
---
The generator in my camp keeps getting destroyed by anything, and I can't figure out who is attacking it. Feel ya, expensive to repair and even more expensive to craft. 
---
I mean, if you’re just giving them up 😏
---
I raised this issue a few times, some people from Bethesda showed up and made a few posts, it's all gone again now...Pete Hines is completely useless, i would start with firing him.
---
&gt;advanced connectors
---
So that's the name of the plan now? Not the barn one?
---
Yeah, it is getting a bit old, to be honest. The new thing is the Ultracite Explosive Vents plans.
---
Better fuckin not be expensive. I swear 100 atoms to 300 tops. I'm not paying for those. 
---
Seems fair.
---
Care to share your build!? Please?
---
Been there since day 1.
---
I used to spawn off of a cliff all of the time before I learned of this - it was so infuriating!  It  took a little trial and error moving the C.A.M.P. around, but I eventually found the sweet spot where I spawn right in front of the stairs. Haven't spawned off the cliff in a couple of weeks!
---
Definitely PC version right now - and I use a controller instead of keyboard and mouse. I have all three versions. 
---
PC is working pretty well with good graphics - My go to now
---
Xbox One X was fine until the last update - lots of crashed that I hope are fixed with the update on the 14th
---
PS4 Pro graphics are muddy. Still fighting with 4K TV settings, and settings on the console. Not happy.
---
Random, scorched just had a railway sound but no railway rifle in hand 
---
Ok...what am I looking at?
---
Well I mean, what do you want them to say? We'll get the details with the upcoming patch notes so they're just giving a brief outline. And the topics they've covered blanket any department within the game that a complaint would fall under.
---
It's a blog post on what they're doing and what they plan on doing, not a short story for you to read yourself to sleep. Jesus, what an asinine thing to complain about.
---
You can take your passive aggressiveness to r/fallout. 
---
Correction: December
---
I may end up stealing this one lol. I just need some great loot to give them.
---
im a fool for thinking the player vending was coming next week.  \*sigh\*  im also probably over imagining a neat little set up with my own robot vendor stand id spend way too long building
---
I don't get it?
---
Did you disguise a stash box as the small crate?  Trolling by... making them see their stash?
---
Yeah that happens to me to but it would eventually mellow out. But it was constantly when I was around him till I crashed. 
---
It's worth the price for the single player for sure. The players kind of ruin RDO imo, can't go into a town without constantly getting shot.
---
I just want shutter windows for all the wall types. Those broken, warehouse looking windows on warehouse and barn walls looks terrible. 
---
You can get serum recipes. 
---
Drill is legendary loot too, but not legendary item!
---
Lvl 50 X-01 has a higher energy and rad resistance than ultracite whereas ultracite has a higher physical damage resistance ultracite total is 1479 resistance and Lvl 50 X-01 is 1509 the difference in damage is pretty much negligible but the red resistance is very useful for nuke zones, it would be good if ultrascite had additional protection against scorched 
---
Yeah but those aren’t ultracite plans.....
---
I have an explosive Tesla rifle.   Yes it arcs with a charging barrel.   I use the charging shotgun barrel myself, way more damage and the arc doesn't bounce back to the ghoul  / scorched / squirrel right in front of you.  Blowing yourself up in the process. 
---
Top three hidden bonuses, #2 will shock you.:
---
 It's energy damage (unfortunately goo piles but bullet sponge mobs are weak against it).
---
Unlike other energy weapons, it doesn't break after two shots.  Loses condition more like a regular gun.
---
Rifleman perks up it's damage, so you can stack it with other rifles (like a sniper for long range) and not have to cross build for shotgun perks.
---
I have too much bazar (not sure for the word im from France) don't want to loose them...
---
Gotcha. Idk then. 
---
Not amazing help but if you're ever stuck in your house or such, build a chair and sit in it, or if in power armor, get out of it. This became relevant to me because it turns out friends fast traveling to your camp land at different places than you do sometimes. 
---
They had said they would give it to console players too :(
---
Alright, that's pretty cool.
---
Yeah it does.  Changes the whole feel of the game and adrenaline rush of danger, and the type of people the game attescts.   Now that I've answered why it matters to me, any other questions?
---
I'm between warframe and f76 and tbh I can't see Anthem being as good as they say it is going to be
---
Yup. Nuke zone.
---
I carry a Hazmat suit just for that purpose. I put it on anytime I log out at Whitespring or server hop while there. Saved me a few deaths.
---
Oh and logging out inside won't help...as you spawn outside.
---
I spawned in the foundation at my boyfriend's camp and started laughing/crying. He thought I was being attacked.
---
I would prefer spawning under the welcome mat so I at least know WHY it happened
---
There are still some 'open items' that all players share in common, but far fewer. They appear to be 'mostly' limited now to workshop locations, however, I haven't found a hard and fast rule.  
---
The game definitely tracks if you picked up a plan in the area, and won't let you see additional plans in the same location for 24 hours, and me and friends have both interdependently picked up different plans separately from the same area so there is definitely not a shared common world experience for 'many' items, and it appears these are included.  
---
I am unsure exactly what Bethesda did to cause this particular way of things working, but it appears to be some hybrid solution to prevent location farming integrated in an earlier patch.   
---
Short answer: You get your own world instance of items that re-spawns every 24 hours now, where a few things are exceptions to the rule.
---
&gt;&gt; anyone who logged into the full release of Fallout 76 on any platform in 2018 will receive the Fallout Classic Collection on PC. 
---
Yeah I looked for a drill or syringer and didn’t find either 
---
Plague Walker + Dirty Water = A great way to power level.  You have the lowbie do the spring of shame through the club house in Whitesprings and jump up into the flower planting bed safe zone, they all come out and get tagged as soon as they get close enough to the raised bed AOE cloud.  Then you have your high level melee friends swing for the fences on anything in range of the jump spot.
---
Same here. In an end game group with lots of level 200+ players that is getting quieter by the day. Everyone was really looking forward to seeing what’s coming up and all we get is “various fixes” and “more content soon” AGAIN. How long are we supposed to hold out hope?
---
"That's part of the fun!" - This sub.
---
Yeah, it's fucking awful. FYI, it can happen, randomly, when logging out as well if anyone was wondering. Never start a quest you won't finish if you can help it.
---
Very true... So much more true in WoW than even 76
---
If I remember wasn't the Fallout classic pack included for players who purchased the tricentennial version? 
---
Run Forest Run 
---
Read the other comments about this in the thread. If you're using BetterInventory mod there is a solution below for the fix. If not, Bethesda has to help I suppose. 
---
This is a cool idea, I'd like to see more variations and abilities, too.  Preferably none of which make me feel like I'm going to have a seizure.
---
Are you waiting a few moments between servers?
---
If it's less than 15 bucks sure, otherwise there's probably plenty stuff out there you haven't played yet. 
---
I found bottlecap/lunchbox mines in the game, but haven't found a way to disarm/pick them up without them exploding in my face.. hopefully it's just a reference to them.. long shot
---
Make sure you place it in your stash before any scrapping, it's like rare gold .. sucks but that's what happens, hopefully will be fixed eventually. 
---
On that note I assume it doesn't spoil. I tried to put some raw flux on an alt character to safe keep it, but it spoiled.
---
I saw someone make a YouTube video saying that if you move the C.A.M.P device around the build area it changes your spawn location. 
---
likely the later, if it's not started soon enough your not gonna finish it as he kinda gets stuck on certain terrain features, which makes sense since the world is all tore up, but he does have a large number of different messages to deliver.
---
One is a gag message, where he asks if the 'recipient's refridgerator is running and that he was supposed to wish them luck in catching it if it were, but he also comments that if it isn't they should likely call a repair person, prefferably from General Atomics to fix it.
---
Another, he's panicing as he needs verbal confirmation from the target recipient to be able to deliver it and since he's not gotten such he can't deliver the message.
---
A friend told me one of the messages he's helped deliver was an aproval of acceptance into a vault.
---
So it is quite varried what message he's going to deliver
---
Yep it varies, mass effect 1 dlc was still selling for full price last I looked as well.  As for RDR2 I used a PSN code to shave a bit off.
---
I made a hospital in the ash heap stocked with gas masks and stimpacks and disease cures in case anyone needed them, cranberry bog I’ll just get raped by scorchbeast and toxic valley is a bit bland
---
When I had the "Early Warnings" quest, a broken uplink and a floating holotape would spawn in-world at my position whenever I logged into a new server.
---
Couldn't come sooner. It will pull the exploit culture no lifers to a new obsession.
---
If youre on Xbox I can help you with the blade of baset. 
---
Agree
---
when in doubt, run it out :)
---
I was saying that you can get those as well. Not just the plans. It's just rng. 
---
There aren't even console versions of the classic Fallout games.
---
It would be a game change if I could simply put a silencer on the Western Revolver. We can make plasma flame throwers from scratch but can't mod a silencer onto a revolver??
---
However, if they add a colt .45 into the game or 1911 or whatever it is called, I'll be in love
---
Ah yeah I agree with that for sure. 
---
I haven't seen one charge up. They all just insta-fire for me. Gets rather bothersome TBH.
---
It is good to know it's not universal I guess.
---
LOL this is exactly where I'm Camped atm,   although the only things i've placed up there are turrets and a bed.  
---
This is awesome.
---
Yup, that's honestly the reason for the stash limits currently, is due to weapons/armor as they have alot of meta data associated with them, as they must track: base weapon, mods, condition current, condition max, and/or any legendary effects.  same goes for armor.
---
Scorchbeasts are one of the most poorly-designed enemies I have ever faced in any game.
---
&gt; is more likely a competitor for Destiny 2 
---
..i don't know if you were thinking of warframe.. but I'm glad you didn't name it because wf is way more enjoyable than d2

If you're on Xbox I can help with the blade of baset.
---
u can buy it form encalve vendor or form players.
---
You are right, i just changed the currency to US $ in that store and the price goes up to 44$
---
Nothing more to add.... Agree just with less anger
---
&gt;&gt;anyone who logged into the full release of Fallout 76 on any platform in 2018 will receive the Fallout Classic Collection on PC.    
---
It says logged into any platform. The wording says log into the client to download, not to be entitled to receive one. You should be able to get it if you logged in on console in 2018 and use the client in 2019. 
---
Not really 
---
I want that blackbird armor back
---
that server hopping though forcibly respawns all 'non essential' npc/entities in that area.
---
Perfectly whelmed, as all things should be...
---
As I understood from the original post from Bethesda, it's PC only, but you can get them if you play 76 on console. But you still need PC to play your free gifts. Rigged IMO.
---
If he went anywere other than this forum they would say that, because the game came out in a very poor state.
---
Totally agree! I love the idea of workshops and they are a big part of the game.
---
Locking them up and defending them from other players or some waves of enemies for rewards is fun! 
---
Looking forward to the next 2 updates
---
&gt; I feel bad for being so hard on them and the game sometimes. 
---
Don't. They knew these issues were here and released the game anyways. They always do this. It's about time they got burned. Maybe like a stupid child they'll learn.
---
Truth.  I always travel to CAMP so Im not out of sorts.
---
If you use power armor, leaving it on when you log off will result in fusion core at 100% when you log back on.  Would also protect you if you were to log into nuke zone.
---
&gt;\[...\] some of the things we’re planning to address include issues with several Challenges and quests, various fixes to a number of Perks and weapons, and tackling various exploits we’ve seen. 
---
I'm not sure what challenges or quests are currently in a "cannot complete" state, so I'm not sure what'll be fixed there. More than likely, it'll be a pathing fix for some quest-givers or something to prevent spawned-in enemies from appearing in weird places. As for fixes to perks and weapons, I'm wondering if this means we'll see a nerf to explosive damage next week or soon after (at least, preventing it from being affected by Demolitions Expert). Exploit-wise, I'm hoping they finally fix duplication, though that would mean preventing player-induced rollbacks.
---
&gt; Beyond Monday’s patch, we’re working on another patch that we hope will hit near the end of the month. This patch will continue to add fixes for issues being voiced by the community, including the number of plans Vendors have available, fixing a few Legendary mods, and continuing to address issues with some Perks. 
---
This is almost certainly where the explosive mod will get an adjustment if not in net week's patch. I'm excited to see what they do with the number of Plans available from vendors - hopefully it's more than *just* a fix to the Harper's Ferry vendor bot which limits things by level range. 
---
As for "addressing issues voiced by the community" that weren't specifically called out, the biggest quality of life improvement I'm hoping for is some indicator for plans I already know. Well, that and being able to finally scrap that extra water purified that's stuck in my CAMP storage.
---
Yeah, this is piss poor.
---
Without both of those legendary drops it’s just not worth it to farm the queen. And taking everything else that’s happened to this game into account it’s really just pathetic 
---
Shoot.me.a.DM
---
They probably aren't going to release them until the patch so A; people can't complain about them yet and B; so people who use exploits can't start coming up with ideas to do them again once the patch is live.
---
*sigh* please not p2w *sigh*
---
Pretend I’m immune to it ? It doesn’t affect me. I play regularly with 4 other people who it doesn’t seem to affect. I personally have my camp right there on 4 toons with a different mix of turrets on each one from rockets to hvy machine guns to shotguns on my main and I regularly have other players camp out on my turretbase.
---
What’s disconnecting in nuke silos got to do with your baseless claim that building by the clubhouse causes server instability ? The servers are unstable, everything causes instability if you want to talk about instability we know nukes can crash servers, stop trying to drop them if it bugs you so much ?
---
Turret killing mobs has always dropped loot, you don’t even have to be nearby. It’s hilarious you ranted about clubhouse turrets then said you used to do it until you decided it didn’t benefit you. Not only are you selfish, you’re bad at it apparently.
---
Keypad doesn’t work as a viable lock as you can just flip the switch next to it to get it to work I wish they would fix it tho
---
&gt; The game definitely tracks if you picked up a plan in the area, and won't let you see additional plans in the same location for 24 hours,
---
Yesterday I picked up the Marine Wetsuit and Marine Torso, and Light Robot Torso from the Harpers Ferry spawn within the course of an hour.  
---
I then picked up the Marine Tactical Helmet, and BoS Officer Underarmor from the Watoga train car within another hour or so. 
---
For those who are confused.   I have the footlocker plans,  they allow players to make stash boxes that look like a footlocker.
---
I place a stash box downstairs (food plant) and then tuck a footlocker stash upstairs.
---
Anyone not paying attention will thing they’ve hit the mother load.
---
The event is called "it's a trap", and the scorch beast lure is a bloody radio tower.
---
Actually I replied with the Grouse grind specifically and you get the same reward serotonin boost for playing and beating shit in video games. Your point it moot..
---
My buddy does that.  and one of our own team mates was like "oh man this thing is full of good stuff!" ... it was his stuff LOL
---
i have 4 stashes at my CAMP.  none are the stash box anymore.  Outside my locked door I leave a bear trashcan stash so it blends in better but is there for astute players
---
And anyone whom pre ordered the game.
---
I've experience the shared detection, too.  
---
I moved 3 points last night, but when I was at the spot that was getting harassed constantly, I was at 11 agility, with escape artists, all shadowed, one chameleon piece so you cloak when you sneak and stay still.  I was still getting detected pretty consistently, even inside a camp with all closed doors and shudders.  That just seems... off to me.
---
*shrugs*
---
Yeah its going to vary depending on seller and type of game.
---
For real. They're still telling us they're working on some specific stuff like exploits, vendor plans, legendary fixes, etc. 
---
Is there a truly indoors/underground location nearby on the map like a cave or bunker that you can sprint to?
---
they are forgetting that a huge part of the live service games is the connections between devs and players and it has to be reciprocate!
---
Fail to capitalise on that and the game is bond to die sooner than expected.
---
I mean.. only one person with the solo purpose of talking to the community should be enough.. but what do I know?
---
Ok I’ll try to do that. I didn’t think we could do much besides the basic monitor tweaks. 
---
That's not the point. I want to play them on the computer and they had said it would be available to everyone who logged in to F76
---
&gt;Short answer: You get your own world instance of items that re-spawns every 24 hours now, where a few things are exceptions to the rule.
---
Does this include the locations for Power Armors?  I had been bouncing a few spots each time I log in (Mama Dolce, Gorge Scrapyard, Morgantown Trainyard) looking to complete my level 25 T-45 Armor set (Only Left Arm left to get).  I had been telling my friends at the time so they could pick up what I found if I didn't need the pieces I discovered...  None of them needed them when I mentioned it, but now I'm curious if they even see the Power Armor I do, let alone the items inside of it.
---
Yea the purifier being stuck has certainly helped me better budget my camp space.  I guess that’s a win?
---
I am hoping that the inevitable explosive nerf isn’t too bad.  Maybe make it apply only if it hits the target rather than regardless of hitting a target?  I would hate to see it lost or ruined, especially since all my weapons at this point have it.  Really don’t want to have to toss em all out for the next best thing.
---
Start? Start?
---
Continue to lose players.
---
Bethesda? When is the next patch coming?
---
no one gives a fuck what you're paying for
---
Completely exit the game. 
---
Log back in. You need to make the game find a new world for you to join, it is just reconnecting to the same one.
---
Gotta farm that karma. 
---
Ive seen the marker outside of the quest. Ill be on in a hour and will go check for myself. A friend told me it was possible after I hassled him a few times about heart of the swamp. 
---
Glad to be of service!
---
Same, finding an ammo bag used to be a major event, now I have 150 in my stash collecting dust. 
---
Or just always log out in PA lol
---
Don't you know the robots kick everybody out for cleaning and remodeling?
---
I'd be happy with the existing content if it would actually work properly.
---
I do the same only in the tattered mole suit with a ripper.
---
It's been suggested before but it would be a great way to balance pvp I think. 
---
EA no way. Division is a non factor. Will not touch them.
---
I like how you got outplayed five times and you didn't once think "Hey, maybe I should turn on pacifist mode".
---
Looool I swear I love that game, but woow, many many employees need assistance/training/firing
---
Many managers mainly. The communication is LOL
---
I wish they'd let us play our own local music through it, even if it's only audible to the player. (I realize this will never happen, don't waste your time telling me this)
---
Would love to have some Tool or Porcupine Tree guiding me through the apocalypse. 
---
The post today says they are releasing a patch next Monday and aim to have another one before the end of the month. The game just came out in what, November? Granted they released an incomplete game, they have released updates on average twice a month since the game released. 
---
Bethesda deserves most of the criticism it receives, but expecting a major update every week, even through holidays is just ridiculous.
---
When they do release patch notes ahead of time, folks like you then crucify them when the patch includes additional things they decided to change later that you don't agree with.
---
A seemingly endless swarm of legendary ghouls flow out of the golf club for some reason.
---
I tried to download fallout 2 and it's asking me to buy it. 
---
Awesome! I'll check it out, even though I did stay up til 4am figuring it out for myself. Thanks!
---
I suppose I don't disagree, they are relatively difficult compared to every other mob in the game though.
---
More than a few people run on autopilot during building looting and workshop claiming.
---
Quite a few have even posted on this very forum about finding a crate full of stuff only to realize it was their stash box at a red rocket or similar.
---
If you’re not paying attention it can seem like one hell of a score.   No harm comes from it,  just a reminder to pay attention to container names.
---
That's not the blade you learn to craft?  I thought it was.
---
&gt; Saved me almost 20k caps
---
More like 2500 caps, since its pretty easy to find players with the recipes selling serums for 500 a pop.
---
You could in FO4, pretty mod-able there, but with the current mod status in FO76 I don't think it's possible. "legally" at least
---
There are definitely some challenges that are a little buggy, showing things completed when they haven’t been or vice versa. I’ve had issues with a number of events, personally, like not being able to interact with certain objects (sonic emitter in Line in the Sand, biofluid container in Path to Enlightenment) which makes them unable to be completed. I can’t recall quests that I had serious problems with but plenty of events can use fixing for sure.
---
Anyways, you're taking my point waaay out of context and aren't adding anything to the conversation. I get it you and the vast majority of ppl feel you deserve tangible rewards 100% of the time for beating video game content. That's a fine opinion to have , and you're welcome to it. I just disagree. 
---
Yes in video games, I get it but my point is NOT WITH SCORCHBEASTS SPECIFICALLY. How hard is it to understand what my point (and OPs point) is? The point is that unlike all the other enemies in Fallout 76 which do give you both a mental and literal reward, scorchbeasts give you neither 
---
Any time I log into a server where my camp spot is occupied I get this.
---
At least two (up to four) of each blueprint. Takes forever to scrap them all. Although I haven't yet had the undeletable bug yet. /Knock wood
---
So they can loot everyone who dies logging in there ... (joke ... maybe)
---
The Ghouls are easy to kill and give great xp supposedly.
---
That's a good idea. I will be sure to do the same when I am in need or if i see someone else in need!
---
&gt; fixing a few Legendary mods
---
As I’ve had to tell a few people here, it’s inevitable explosive legendaries are gonna get adjusted. Well, I wonder if this is what they’re referring to here?
---
I was a moron and chugged 4 serums with starched genes on.  Fortunately after a brief panic I found it still worked fine.
---
True.
---
It was a joke. Slow down bacon. 
---
They are lacking in the roadmap part. My biggest issue was, they gave more information yesterday when they said they would have details about the patches today. They could have simply included that, it didn't need to wait the day seeing as it was ambiguous. With the delay, I was expecting more explicit details. 
---
the only thing that i trully like is the red rocket tower... but i had to pay for it and its only one thing. im gathering all plans for camp and... its not very much to pick from ... you cant make any place fully complete there is always something missing.... no plants... or just simple little things like a proper table .. always something and atomic shop is not making good money beacuse they sell ONE thing not bundles of floors for example and no one is willing to pay for just one thing so much they need to lower the prices of shops items... or make more of them and combine them so we can browse more.. that ofc in my opinion
---
Scorchbeasts?
---
Also still waiting on the "soon" to be revealed content from Nov27th... Which they copied into last weeks one again with "more info soon" 
---
Dude you are thick as fuck honestly. 
---
Vagaries are not vague explanations of things. 
---
There is a mod you can add to the under armor that raises your charisma 1 point which lowers prices. 
---
I think its like 5 caps a point when i found a recipe i was looking for on a vendor i ate a sweet roll and +3 charisma lowered the price from 225 to like 210 off the top of my head.  this is with out any of the bargain perks and about 5 true charisma (8 after eating the sweet roll)
---
Or the invisible enemy. My husband and I were playing last night, and all of the sudden I started taking massive damage and radiation in the middle of a road. As soon as I died, I looked over at his computer, and there was a  very high level Glowing One pummeling me. It never rendered on my side, but was showing just fine on his side. 
---
I just wanna get those sweet sweet handmade plans
---
This lol. I remember the days when this was commonplace and fast travel wasn't even a thing. 
---
Fluids and Glowing/Hardened Masses do not spoil.
---
Fluxes not stabilized spoil - but they are also good vendor fodder if you have too many.
---
I have no clue what your point is , you haven't really made one as far as I can see. Just debating my point in a weird and round about fashion. 
---
I've previously said that I feel the should change the mechanism of the fight to make it more enjoyable,  but I disagree with the people who feel that there should be an automatic legendary reward for killing scorch beasts . Especially considering many people have stated the fight is easy, it's just unfun.
---
I figured it had to do with all the robot allies there but maybe they die?
---
People are upset because yesterday Bethesda said they were excited to share info about new content IN THE POST announcing today’s Inside the Vault. We expected the details to be released today as well. 
---
They did give it to us.
---
More like, they dont want to commit to something that might not make it through QA and be deployed.
---
Pretty much. It's getting harder and harder to defend 76.
---
Stop duping these posts.
---
FML
---
I like your thinking here but SB are not immune to melee, just don't land as much as us melee builds would like
---
It just works 
---
I have plans, yes. But the math isn't adding up.
---
Maybe it is a cumulative thing? I logged in on a mission to clear all the crap out of my stash. The first thing I started with was all the holotapes. As I was clearing them out, I noticed that my stash wieght would jump like 15 pounds every so often as I took them out.
---
The weight wasnt transferring to my character, that remained unchanged.
---
Please! I have a great base on a cliff, but most of the time when I fast travel there I end up in small space in the cliff behind it.
---
I seriously doubt they will. That is the role of a shotgunner. They dont get any armor penetration perks, so crippling things is the whole point..
---
Mostly an email chain. It sucks with companies, but it happens. At least they are staying attentive. They are back from vacation, they are getting back into work. I'm just happy they are looking at so much. I'm pretty hopeful for this months patches. 
---
I’ve stayed my point clearly and even went so far as to capitalize it lol and you still don’t get what I’m trying to say. I’m not going to keep repeating myself because you lack the ability to comprehend what you’re reading
---
the faster you swing the more stuff that dies in front of you
---
That's why I'm saying martial artist (faster attack speed) is a better spend of 3 points than an extra 15% damage from making out the damage perks. Most things will die in one hit anyway. If you have 10 enemies with 300 hp each, attacking every second for 400 damage will kill them all faster then attacking every second and a half for 500 damage. Overkill damage is just wasted.
---
I would love the details as well but everyone is losing their mind. Again. And I feel like it's just because it's popular to be on the hate train. 
---
All DLCs are free for everyone on all platforms.  They specifically said they won't charge for any DLCs as they come out.
---
PlayStation but thank you! 
---
It was from New Vegas and it was the perk you got from having Rex, the King's cyber dog. It was called "Search and Mark".
---
That would be nice, but can they really fix this problem?
---
They need to take a page out of Wube Software (Factorio).
---
This is what a good update, which they do weekly, looks like:
---
https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-276
---
This game isn't even 1.0 yet but has a HUGE amount of content.  
---
As bad as Bethesda is... they've got a LONG way to go before reaching EA level of douchery.  I highly doubt either of those games will have smooth launches either.  Potentially better launches than fallout 76, but not smooth.
---
https://bethesda.net/en/status
---
Speaking of the shop, the music that plays in the background will demonetize your youtube video, if you're into that, so don't open the shop while recording, or edit that part out.
---
Can you recraft after you do it once? 
---
[video of camp](https://youtu.be/xsYTjV4kIsA) 
---
At the time, I didn't know how. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Live and learn.
---
I defend this game left and right. But today is definitely a fuckup. Don’t tell us one thing and do another. 
---
Deal!
---
Let’s start a pool on how long it takes a new duplication method after the patch. I have 1 hour. YouTube video posted in under 3 hours. 
---
So this year, a PVP update and vendors. What will 2020 bring us?
---
That's how I feel about talking to you as well. We can agree to disagree.  You want easy content with exceptional reward.  I feel they should make the fight more fun,  but that I don't think it's meant as something designed to be farmed for ' easy legendary' rewards and is instead just a ass hole high level mob meant to be a foil.
---
It was probably just that one server. 
---
Exactly what I was thinking. Even worse is they dangle vague statements to give the community something to grow anxious about, and the opportunity for misinformation to get stoked up and spread around. 
---
It really feels like a fluffed up article that could have been said as,
---
"Patch cominng on the 14th. Stay tuned for more details."
---
It's just another example of how the company as a whole, just doesn't get it.
---
Unfortunately, I have to agree.
---
They said they wont be adding lootboxes and pay to win elements, and its only cosmetics. But knowning EA, if the game doesnt make a billion $$ then they will start adding Lootboxes and PTW after people already bought the game.
---
Jukebox is the way I went when building the communal space in my camp
---
drops from the super mutant behemoth that spawns at the steak house north of watoga 
---
My train of thought was to put those "keep" items out of inventory so I didn't mindlessly scrap them when going through items I didn't want. 
---
No im not gonna Play eny of thoes games ?!
---
This. The update yesterday was great, but then you have to deliver on the expectations you set(fair or unfair) when you imply that the delay is based on wanting to provide as much information as possible
---
I do this with friends and we just collect one another’s bounty.  Have made many a turret farmer leave the server.
---
Great point. Very useful feature for the workshops, should definitely be a camp option
---
Who knows, hope they do. Cause i noticed that if there are no dupers in my map game runs decently, and i don't disconnect.  
---
Also this is anecdotal, but when being close to dupers i usually dc instantly instead of lag for a while before dcing.
---
I hit up Camp MacClintLock, tons of battered clipboards.  What's at sugar grove for springs?
---
He does he has the powered doors
---
That’s sounds great, yeah if you have any spare it would be awesome. I game name is kolakuze
---
Hardened Masses are considered junk (in the junk tab) and get scrapped if you Scrap All Junk or run out of whatever they scrap into.
---
High Radiation Fluids, Glowing Masses (Aid Tab) and Hardened Masses do not spoil so you can acquire them and store them (ensuring not to use the hardened mass in crafting).
---
Equip Green Thumbs when picking up Flux for double and you can recover from this fairly easily in another Blast Zone.
---
After Level 50 equip Super Dupper when crafting Stabile Flux for bonus Stabiles. 
---
Unused Fluxes are great Vendor Fodder. Also great hydration in a pinch ... just watch out for the spoiled version Inert Flux coming in at 1 lb each.
---
It's out before the patch is.
---
I want easy content with exceptional reward? Lol the complete opposite of what I’ve been saying the whole time Jesus Christ. Ok let’s end this convo
---
It's a moot point as far as I'm concerned. Anyways good chat. The conversation is at a dead end so I bid you good day ;) 
---
Thank you. Any reason why it would spoil on alt character which I didn't login with (Was very careful). You think they time it as soon as I login, they calculate the time. Not a biggie, just thought I could hoard some flux until I had enough hardened mass to process it with.
---
More low energy news from Bethesda about about shitty updates with absolutely nothing worth turning your head for.  
---
Obviously they do not give a damn because they are still lacking transparency and communication with the community.  On top of that are the incredibly vague three-paragraph “Inside the Vault” updates that tell you next to nothing.
---
I am getting fed up with this bullshit.  I am certainly not holding my breath for them to add anything worth while in the near future.
---
"hahahaha...fuckin' noob!!!" *bang bang bangs off into the sunset*
---
Welch vendor lacks one. His desk was full of excess black titanium and cloth a week ago. 
---
Thanks, but I never said plan. I had the mod and tried to install and there were components necessary to install. Not sure if you were able to work around that somehow, if so I'd be interested in how you did it.
---
Camp mcinlock, if not cleared, has 30+ clipboards scattered around on the main floor.
---
Look in the blue bins and open file cabinets too.
---
Thank you for this valuable information! 
---
I am sure there are other methods that people are keeping in their back pocket. 
---
&gt; Live and learn
---
More like die and learn.
---
That same music plays when walking around in the white spring resorts trade hall
---
My character dines exclusively on dog food and corn soup, corpses, and the organs of scorchbeasts. Nothing but the best for me.
---
I did, and they can't. Filed a support ticket, which only led to them asking me to file a bug report. They can't help, I can just hope for a patch.
---
It definitely is. Now I wanna go watch The Return again...
---
Ok are you lvl 40 or 50?
---
Nuked flora, hardened mass, glowing mass, and high rad fluid. 
---
Provably pretty low requirements. They are very old games
---
That would be sick.  Kinda like a Skyrim werewolf?
---
Usually if you drop things close by to the other, it just puts them in the same bag and combines them. Now if you had run away to another spot further away and dropped more things, it usually makes a second bag, if it vanished, than most likely you experienced the invisible bag/deleting itself bag glitch. I've dropped multiple bags in the past when they've been apart, but there is always a risk when you drop things.
---
In the future when you want to keep whatever you're dropping, drop a piece of ammo, if the bag is there, transfer the items from your inventory to there.
---
Also you can redraft the excavator, it's a pain, same with the blade of basted. The other 2 I'm not sure of sorry.
---
You can re-craft the bastet blade into a higher level version, but you NEED a bastet blade as a crafting component. 
---
I believe power armor is one of those items thats still shared across all players. It re spawns more frequently then 24 hours though, and might be based on 'area entrance' spawning somewhat like mobs.   
---
Of course, I need to double check the 24 hour item re spawn as well, I might be wrong about that based on another post above, but I don't seem to get re spawns after I pick up an item, might be an error in methodology.
---
Play your own music in the background? That's exactly what I do.
---
My fucking barn plans glitched out and wouldnt work....I got electrical connectors and switches instead.
---
Scorchbeast are sulfurie in French?
---
That's great. I want that.
---
huh, well I know where I am going to "steak" out 
---
Eh, I'd more like it if you could find holo tapes of music that you load into it, like a container that can only take holo tapes and it 'cycles' between the holotapes loaded into it.
---
😂
---
the only reason for proposing a limit on weight a character can hold is destroy some of the inventory from the dupers unless I misunderstood which is why I mentioned it. If the servers are shitty enough where players cant horde at all then the servers need to be fixed and not limit weight/capacity of this game more than what it already is. I don't mind all the glitches and instability as much as the terrible weight and capacity problems we have, but I might be the minority here. 
---
Lvl 47 so kinda in a weird stage between major levels. I logged out at white springs to farm my at up to 50 hopefully 
---
I'm on PC actually.  I don't play as often as I used to but if you want send me your account name!
---
Don’t YouTube “baby shark” if you value your sanity.
---
We've made some changes, it's everything you wanted, but we won't tell you what it is until Monday.
---
And BTW, if what you wanted is not in Monday's patch, it is probably in the end of month patch. So please stop complaining.
---
You can actually get into that area near Harpers Ferry without marsupial or a jetpack. I was able to climb in through the back.
---
I'll double check those locations by spawning into them, outside of them and then fast traveling in, and a few other things. I know that just reloading into harpers ferry I stopped getting spawns (Did it 10 times after picking up the plan just to be sure, and got nothing).   
---
It is possible my game is glitched, or possible you're game is glitched in a favorable way to you. I would need more players to verify in order to be sure. 
---
Eh, semantics.
---
they generate more power
---
Not at all. Killing the queen with vanilla weapons is you doing little damage. Killing the queen with good wepains is the difference between soloing her in literally two minutes or spending 20+ minutes with a full squad. Compared to everything else in the game the whitesprings is a reasonable amount of time for good legendaries
---
Yes under your weapons workbench under the crafting section, I think it's under edged weapons.
---
Did your radio work? My radio didnt work, i figured that was why they took them out insted of fixing them.
---
I just got a hammer with (I think) 40% fast swing speed. So with Martial Artist it should be going super fast. Hopefully.  
---
I have the lvl 40 legs and lvl 50 arms sorry they are a bit mismatched
---
Since we are on this topic, can anyone tell me a good place to farm mutations? I seem to very rarely get one (my level 66 character has only contracted 2 mutations) i have starched genes on the backpedal (not equipped)
---
nah, it's t-45 motion assisted servos and ultracite knuckles
---
I want it with brick so i dont have brick showing in my bathroom
---
Yes. I'm definitely fucking confused. 
---
I thought Pete Hines was the Vice President for the whole of Bethesda. A company with a few hundred employees. 
---
Turns out he's some PR Managager who directly runs the company's social media accounts. 
---
Give your fucking head a shake. Just because his title says he's in charge of global marketing and PR doesn't mean he needs to personally be the one putting out communications. 
---
In that case the people destroying your base are cunts for taking part in duping which ruins the game even more than turret farms, really what we need is a new place for end game content and legendaries, because other than the prime fissure site there in no where else to nuke but white springs 
---
No complaints here at all

Google is a good tool. 
---
Like ultracite?
---
You're assuming my lvl and the context you rebel. 
---
To make the workshop have easy power
---
I thought about that, but ahhh yeah, right after I ahh ... so ahh yeah the thing about that is ahhh.. yeah  what the OP said.... :)
---
Not sure why everyone is assuming that I thought I bought a plan rather than a mod. I had the MOD in my stash, not in my inventory, so it shouldn't have been affected by scrapping. The fact that it changed to a different mod is what I'm trying to resolve. If the mod is just going to change before I can apply, is it even worth trying to get it again?
---
The prices aren't the problem. It's the 200 cap limit each vendor faction has and when you buy from them their caps don't go up 1:1 like previous fallout games. 
---
Im in around 260+ hours and always busy doing/trying something. 
---
When will you be on do you think ? 
---
No and no.
---
Its a close place to scrap and store.
---
Happened to me in the cranberry bog. I ended up slow crawling to safety in the trenches. Took like 7 tries to get out. That’s what I get for being level 17 there.  
---
About 35-40 mins, after we’re done I’m running a nuke silo with a friend if you want in on that?
---
Im lvl 240 and im constantly finding stuffs to do whether it is looking for junks, launching nukes, doing events, and collecting plans. Set yourself a goals.
---
Wait so scorchbeast are sulfurie ? 
---
You are welcome! Thank you for reading :)
---
That is awesome
---
You are 100% correct on them not caring at all. If it's not obvious to everybody just how low priority 76 is now then they are just blind.
---
It's 2 devs in their spare time as a labour of love priority. Which is to say, in their *lunch break personal time* when they can be bothered.
---
The worst I’ve ever had happen was one time when my camp couldn’t be placed, and for some reason I spawned in another persons lvl 3 locked base, I had to spend caps to leave... in hindsight I should have stayed and waited for the player to return.
---
Those are literally the most common things I get from them. For whatever reason after I got my first long coat i couldnt get a second.
---
Agree, although this is really one of those "updates about forthcoming updates" not actually an update.
---
Please don't teach bad habits. You skipped out on 3 other plan and mod nodes in Harper's Ferry alone.
---
Teaching people to server hop the very popular display case plan is just misleading.
---
If it's belly of the beast, This happened to me at the Very end.  Next time i just ran right back to that last step and it worked.  Bypassed everything else.
---
I finally killed my first one the other night. Only reason i could was im finally level 60 and had a bridge in the mire to hide under. I've lost so much junk because of them, super annoying.
---
Don't play this until it's fixed. 
---
Thanx for the heads up. I am aware of the 1 in 10 rule though. This is the only video I have posted here. I was just posting this one here because of a post I read last night. I don't like post my videos on reddit. Redditors can be a tough crowd. In this case I was answering a reddit post I read from last night wanting to know how to do this. It was impossible to explain in words. So I made the video. Again thanx for looking out though.
---
Random question regarding shotguns:
---
Since they are crap for Armor Pen, is it even worth it putting Armor-Piercing Magazines on Shotguns? I know that Armor Pen becomes a huge necessity in higher levels, which is why my build also incorporates Rifles / Tank Killer; but, I'm curious as to whether or not I should swap the Armor Pen mags on my Shotguns for something with more capacity / quicker reload speed.
---
Nor do sniper rifles 
---
They are  just bandwagon assholes or bitches that feel like youtubers are gods. 
---
Wait, does the SK buff apply to the SB itself? Or is it just for taking out the scorched it spawns?
---
And does that also apply to "X against Scorched" legendaries?
---
So youre saying they cant just create a new material with the color pallet and assign that?
---
fuck me unity has me spoiled then....
---
I was watching the Whitespring sentries fight one, and when it died, it shot beneath the earth, never to be seen again.
---
Hmmm. I haven’t seen it. It fixed for me a while back when they patched it. I would put a ticket in with Bethesda if it’s still bugged for you. 
---
The window works too lol. I have use the window trick a bunch in the past.
---
he disintegrated them how it that even remotely close to petting
---
The 14th
---
&gt; annoying, frustrating, poorly designed, and rewardless
---
yep, it's Fallout 76 alright.
---
I'll help someone who needs stimming in Watoga, but I'm not going to open up on the Bots. I worked very hard for that immunity and I'm not going to give it up.
---
That's the pint sized slasher paint job. Hope to fuck this time raider PA and excavator gets some love. 
---
that's it?  seriously?
---
As I understand it you can get a pet for your camp if you pacify one with the Animal Friend perk and bring it there, though I can't confirm since I haven't successfully pacified anything yet
---
If I paid $60 for this game I would be pissed, but fortunately I only paid like $30 for it.
---
It has a lot of good things going for it. The problem is that the bad things are very in-your-face and severely hinder enjoyment of the game. Lots of balancing issues, bugs, and a severe lack of legitimate end-game content.
---
The game is basically the exact same experience at level 1 as it is at level 100.
---
This is what we get when the customers can't accept that companies move slower than their customers. 
---
We want more communication! Ok, the best we can do is tell you every week something we are doing, and when we hope to have it out. When we actually have something to deliver, then we can tell you exactly what it is. Otherwise, if say something, and we can't meet the deadline, you'll be upset.
---
Well now I'm upset because I wanted to know now, not when you know for sure. 
---
Issssa me!! Jk I don’t have the game :(
---
Ive run into this issue multiple times. I had to completely redesign one base because my party and i kept spawning into a piece of foundation. 
---
Fort Defiance workroom when you've done the BoS questline.  I've gotten the BoS Officer under armor and the Marine Wetsuit plans there.
---
Totally agree. And the crazy thing is that Bethesda had dragons in Skyrim that could have been the behavior template for scorch beasts in this game....
---
He sometimes has signs and letters, and other 10k plans
---
...and they didn't consider the consequences of these issues on a multiplayer title. You can have duplication glitches and exploits in a single player title, it only effects the one player. They destroy online titles and are incredibly difficult to recover from.
---
"we are fixing broken stuff for the next month. enjoy the new content!"
---
Dense mod for your chest armor.
---
Perk in Agility named Escape Artist.
---
Just walk away. ;)
---
Mainly so you can drop stuff in loot boxes 
---
It only works if a team member is also mutated. It changes the descriptions of you current mutations in your effects tab
---
A few things here.
---
A rocket powered chunk of metal probably wouldn't do more damage than a super advanced plasma lobbing pistol that in reality would likely melt any metal material on earth. It also probably wouldn't have the same armor penetration capabilities as a .44 revolver. But it does, and much more so. 
---
Then you said the discrepencies between semi autos and automatics is for balance, but are okay with pistols having arguably the lowest DPS and lowest armor penetration of any weapon tree? Yeah, a western revolver does more damage per shot than a handmade, but a handmade shoots faster, has better armor penetration, and can have a massive clip wich leads to it massively leading in DPS comparatively, which is hardly "balanced" since these are the most versatile (best) of their respective weapon types. Even with armor penetration that was equivalent, a fully modded handmade would still have a higher DPS than a western revolver.
---
Explosives don't really do the most damage. The amount of synergy that a melee build allows between perks, mutations, drugs, food, etc. allow them to do the most single target DPS in the game by far. Explosives also, unless effected by heavy guns perks, have no armor penetration, unless someone has tested and proved otherwise. The explosive prefix doesn't really fall into explosive weapons category considering it is clearly broken/unbalanced and will hopefully be patched soon. 
---
There are a few things to complain about pistols.
---
Lowest DPS
---
No armor penetration
---
Wonky handling with revolvers
---
Low ammo capacity
---
Basically no viability for a sneak build
---
VATs would be the saving grace of pistols IF rifles didn't do it better
---
Welcome mats aren't the same.  They're called fast travel mats in the game.
---
Hit it with the syringer rifle, reduce its damage by 25%, or better yet have the vox quest and have it talk to you!
---
I have noticed this also. I'm not sure why it continues to lose condition when you are not on unless it is some weird real time to game time conversion. 
---
I have noticed this with food also.
---
I think as time goes on, people will want more room to hold on unique weapons and stuff, but for now, I'll stay neutral on the stash size.
---
That being said, the dupers are out of control.  There should be zero tolerance for this crap; it's diminishing the game for everyone who is playing fairly.  Not just because it lags the hell out of the server, but because it feelsbadman.jpg when you're playing fairly, struggling through epic fights, and a couple cheaters with unlimited TSE weapons, bobblehead, and magazine guys show up and kill literally everything in a couple seconds.
---
That’s kind of my backhanded not readily apparent comment. Duping isn’t going away anytime soon
---
&gt; the TSE thing needs a nerf
---
no, it doesn't.
---
I was a bit put off by the lack of paints or dyes after hours of playing.  Selling themed items is one thing, though there aren't even many of those.  But there should be some basic color options, or just alternate skins if they can't let us tint stuff.  Doesn't really help that clothes are full outfits, no tops and bottoms to mix and match.  Armor is kinda, but there just aren't many paints to mix and match with.
---
Please no. Enough of the damn ivory grip. It spawns in a ruined mobile home that overlooks summersville. I got 4 ivory grip plans in 1 day doing public events. It is so easy to get already. Put useful plans in the vendors not the easiest plan to get.
---
Budget of your camp is maxed out. It doesn't say it but if you recycle something you'll see that you can attach cables again.
---
Yes it was just one room apart when dropped. They didn't combine just simply disappeared.  Luckily I had all the components to craft armor right away.  The other I'll have to live without.
---
Duped
---
nothing  
---
I have  just the bare minimum to 80%  and 90% and 100% the loot is all the same and the power you get at the boxes are the same that includes the substations and workshops.   
---
It may have a weighted system for the first 3 plans you get as I did 100% on two characters and I got fusion gene first try my 3rd I did most 1 was 100% got large and my 4th didn't get any to 100% and I got windmill.  People I have ran with however did not get the fusion on the first try with 100% thus I say weighted maybe upping the chance by a small %  
---
But after that all the stuff you get does not seem weighted at all. 
---
Oh yeah. I have only been down there a few times ... a bit out of the way to walk!
---
[i expected nothing. and im still let down]
---
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ftdu8yrKOw)
---
So you downloaded the client and logged in with the Bethesda.net account you use when logging into the console version but it still wants you to buy it?
---
They're not difficult for me to kill, nor do they really do much damage to me. They're just really annoying / frustrating to fight, and the juice isn't worth it squeeze. It bothers me that they're considered the "end-game" enemies.
---
I cant believe you are actually arguing that a pistol should do as much damage as a mid caliber rifle 
---
Because yesterday, people were all, where's the Inside the Vault? We haven't heard anything since the first! Come on Bethesda, where's this weekly communication you promised us.
---
They are never going to win. 
---
If they gave full patch notes today, and something changed between now and then, people will be crying, YOU LIED TO ME AGAIN BETHSCANT!
---
We all forced them to play their perk cards close to their chest armor, because people are just very unreasonable. 
---
I agree with you, that if there are more locations, it's an extremely bad habit to teach, unfortunately, the whole point of this thread is that I am trying to collect 'all' the locations, so rather then just telling me a 'general' statement that locations exist that I missed, it would be nice if you specified so I could add them, until then, I'll have to continue encouraging bad habits.
---
I made it to level 80 aswell  and did all  the  quests, Launched a nuke on my own. I just miss the multiplayer aspect in the game tbh. I have a shitload of ammo and junk stached. I'm always willing to help other players by aiding them on quests or getting them stuff and  I don't need caps for it. I'm just a lonely old man in Appalachia. My C.A.M.P is the road next to the trainstation at Top of the World. Feel free to message me or visit me.
---
Lmfao yeah he's pretty common if you walk. I've noticed him on the road a great many times. He probably just spawns close to the person on football not fast traveling.
---
Sick. Imma go buy one from a duper brb
---
Thank you, I will add it with asterisks until I've verified it.
---
My bad. 
---
I just assumed you were another
---
"How hard could it be to fix duping? Just hire a modder they fix everything. I could fix it, I used a Mac one time. They're not even trying or they hate their players"
---
Types 
---
Yeah, that’s all that would be. Announcing to the area that there’s a baggy full of loot nearby. 
---
Comm team: "We need to get a really good detailed Inside The Vault out to kick of the new year. What can we talk about in it?" 
---
Patch Team: "Just bug fixes"
---
Comm Team: "Is that all?"
---
Patch Team: "Maybe give us a day and we may be able to squeeze in some content"
---
1 day later
---
Comm Team: "So what else can we talk about?"
---
Patch Team: "Oh just more bug fixes" 
---
Comm Team: ( '\_\_' )
---
In all seriousness, I'm glad a lot of the issues are being worked on and it's important to strengthen the foundation. I just find the intentional day delay on the fluffy ITV funny.
---
When did you start playing Fallout 76?
---
Glad we settled that you are confused. If you look at his twitter bio, he states  "svp of global marketing/comms at bethesda." Also a quick google search will state  "**Pete Hines** is the vice president of Bethesda Softworks and is in charge of public relations and marketing of games published by Bethesda" Does that clear up any confusion?
---
You mean like an actual jukebox?
---
then you find out only one in ten boars even has a single testicle and you left wondering *where the hell all the boars are coming from.*
---
Love it!  Thanks for sharing!
---
That's so cool!  I have Aquagirl, so I'm immune to water rads, but I would use your bridge on principles of awesomeness.
---
Nope. No legendary hunting rifles either. 
---
What is your non PA build? I’d like to avoid PA as well.
---
Alls good. You can’t convey sarcasm in a message. I agree. There are always exploiters 
---
Yep, honestly Two Shot, Explosive, and Incindiary (and other 'bullet' modifiers) should all be in the same 'slot' meaning you can only have one of them.  If they made that change it'd actually fix the duped item issue right away also by removing at least one of the effect, if not just deleting the item, it'd suck for players that got these items legitimately but at the same time, to remove a tumor you do have to get rid of some healthy flesh too
---
??? Watoga is not like Whitesprings, you can shoot those bots all day long, the immunity is permanent.
---
I would care a lot less if it didn't kill the servers. As for now it would be a number one fix to improve quality for everyone. 
---
Yup. This. The customers are so all over the place, and often unreasonable, that they have to be like this. 
---
Sure, some will say, Bethesda made this atmosphere of untrust. Not entirely true. 
---
It boggles the mind how they released a 'live services' game with apparently 0 plans for adding or evolving the content. These games need fresh content to keep people around, even if it's just a small event with a unique reward.
---
*Por que no los dos?* said the guys in goulags. 
---
5 pts to save the durability is so harsh. You could get a lot more out of your build with those 5 pts
---
This is the second time I’ve found him at the Giant Teapot. I wonder if this is a reliable location to find him at and farm for better equipment?
---
Haha yeah it's nice but I wish the wall pass through connector was less buggy. I Couldn't connect a wire to it for the life of me when it was through a wall. 
---
You know not everyone is on Reddit, right?
---
_If_ there are...?
---
Condescending?
---
You have fun in your own little world. Stop by the church in Harper's when you remove head from rear. There have been maps of general spawn locations for quite a while now.
---
It frankly pisses me off with how big their development team apparently was, they should be able to do more.
---
"When the duping is fixed..." - \*Todd Howard big lol\*
---
How many hits to kill a scorchbeast with that? 
---
This is the style of 'roadmap' they are doing, and I'm not disapointed in it, just wish that it was more 'x day at x time' and never got the 'oh we'll have it out tomorrow, or the next day' kinda treatment
---
Itsfuckingnothing.jpg
---
Sure, but if you get weapons they are still level 45/50, that's what I mean by leveled, doesn't mean you'll get legendaries
---
The earlier fallouts are more point and click, not sure it work with a controller.  Most modern gamers would not get any entertainment out of these.  Fallout 3 and NV are can often be found in xbox store for $2-3 and are much better console experience.
---
Get the Phial of Galadriel and you're all set.
---
Good luck. Pistols arent top tier so they are actually rare and not duped much
---
After reading so many of these threads I was actually surprised my sniper/rifleman build to be quite adequate at taking down a SB solo.
---
Build is basically full rifleman stack + full tank killer and bloody mess, and my combat rifle is listed at ~83 dmg. Takes a visible chunk of health with each shot, and it can pump shots as fast as you can spam the fire button.
---
Enemy is still a bullet sponge, but not unmanageable. And you're right that any decent power armor renders its chartreuse wave attack negligible.
---
Interesting, so all food spoils on alts even if you don't play, hopefully a bug if that is the case.
---
While I wasn't expecting a complete changelog, I feel today's "update" would have been better served if it was just included with yesterday's status report. I was just expecting more from today's, but it all could have been said yesterday. 
---
excuse me my good sir, is this clinic open for business at the moment?
---
I do a lot of crafting plus many chems from Pharma Farms, so I like to keep an eye on the Overseers camp and will go supply a new player there.
---
I had my karma moment last night. Eventually.
---
Joined the "Prison Break" event at the prison as I was passing by on my way to finish Cold Case in Grafton. There was a level 70 in combat armour and a level 40 in PA. I'm level 23 and wearing a chefs hat and swimsuit. Nearly got ganked in Mad Dogs mutants initially but after figuring around good cover spots I was fine. The level 40 guy goes down quick though. He's using the call for help emote so I go over, quickly shotgun the muto standing over him, jab him in the spine with a stim and give him the thumbs up.
---
After the event, I carry on my way and after a few hundred yards I realise Mr Level 40 is following me, albeit out of PA now. I had made a comment over voice comms along the lines of "Nice power armour, but I prefer the freedom a swimsuit gives you. Plus I can show off my sexy legs.". So I said something about him being unable to resist the allure of a man in a swimsuit and we carried on our way. He helped me take down my first Wendigo, although I did most of the work up close with my trusty shotgun whilst he cowered in the distance taking pot shots. Anyway, long story short, we complete Cold Case together (not teamed up or anything). After a bit of emoting, I drop my usual care package of food and drink, including the always handy Grilled Radstag. He drops me... 600 38 rounds. I'm like "Thanks dude, but I don't use this" and drop it again. He does a quick thumbs up, then drops me his quest reward, a level 40 Perfect Storm! Apparently he didn't want it, but I was loving the DPS with DOT it was capable of, so was very grateful and let him know. Really made up for my disappointment at seeing he dropped 38 rounds in exchange for my food and drink care package. 
---
Thank you! At level 69, I'll take on Scorched Beasts, but show me an Assultron and I run like my butts on fire. Do not want.
---
There are currently two other dupe methods aside from the one everyone learned from youtube.  I reported one of them it very close to the BETA dupe method that was closed quickly but not fixed.   
---
So I am willing to bet that they overlook the uncommon ones until some asshole puts it on youtube fucking everything up again. 
---
Patch isn't finished yet, so no they can't.
---
My test-character was Pistols and Auto-Rifles (15 PER, 15 AGI). I would "Snipe" with a .44 to pick off as many enemies as possible, then do mop-ups with an Automatic Rifle.
---
Now granted, this was before automatic weapons got the 20% damage boost, but I still felt they simply weren't worth it. It would take me an entire clip of automatic fire to drop the same enemy I could three-shot with a .44 pistol.
---
So no, I don't use automatic weapons in FO76. I was jaded enough that they split them up between Rifles and Pistols, since the whole reason Commando was good in FO4 was utilizing both (Auto-Rifles for range and recoil control, Auto-Pistols for up-close and hip-fire accuracy). Separating auto rifles and auto pistols effectively made both of them useless.
---
Well, then what are they taking a break from working on the bugs to do? Because they sure aren't fixing the bugs. 
---
People decided they hated the game before it was even released and just pounced on a blew out of proportion most of the issues with the game at launch.
---
You get the classic collection too if youre a console gamer, just use your beth account you had to create on login of fo76
---
Haha. Damn she’s thirsty eh.
---
I’m sure she could find a group of like minded gamers. They could play the game and talk about smashing pissers at the same time.
---
Yeah idk....I've seen him literally all over in really odd spots. Middle of the mire, all the way at ammo factory, and even heading towards that odd fissure far south of the ash heap.
---
Screw this POS. Refund.
---
Because of the glowing tumors we would have accepted the spelling  "udderly" as well.
---
Yeah but people asked for regularly scheduled updates so they know when to look for them. 
---
So it’s been set for Wednesday’s. If they had done it yesterday today would have been complaints about doing it early.
---
Like I said. They can’t win. 
---
Happened to me last night (XBox).  I loaded my level 7 into Morgantown Airport and someone had just nuked Morgantown.  Was taking 60 rads a sec and died before I could get into a safe zone.
---
I think they are avoiding talking about new content to keep the hype/speculation trains in check so folks don't throw a fit when it's not exactly what they speculated/thought it would be, plus, with all the people glitching into vaults and inacessable areas already its not like there is no info to go on with some things
---
I would love to see something implemented like picking up holotapes of the in-game songs that you can load into the jukebox. It’s not a radio after all. You should be able to change the music.
---
if this year they just focus on pvp and add no character or NPCs or anything to give me a purpose im uninstalling this game.
---
2 by 2 hands of blue
---
That's on going. Those that don't leave end up "disposed of" and are piled up out back by the service entrance. :P
---
And 5 gears. 
---
This looks wonderghoul.
---
just throw it away and move on - we all have way too much ammo and are dropping hundreds if not thousands all the time
---
On PS4 I don’t experience any of the issues described here. 
---
Could it be a connection speed issue? Or just random luck?
---
About power armor, I'm not sure if there's a mod that reduces explosive damage, but regular armor has them. Apparently the SB screech is explosive. So with normal armor, if you mod it for explosive damage resistance, SBs get quite a bit easier. There's also the added bonus of me not 1-shotting myself with my own explosive shotgun, which is nice. Also normal armor with White Knight degrades at 90% slower, while Power Armor degrades at only 60% slower. So I went the other way - I started in PA because of accessibility, but between movement speed penalty, having to worry about fusion cores, etc., I started using regular armor a lot more. Stacking 3-star normal armors, things can get pretty beastly. The only char I have that still lives in power armor is the heavy gunner, because Stabilized requires it, and without Stabilized I might as well be shooting spitballs at things for all the good they do.
---
"Die and not learn" probably makes more sense in your situation since you died five times.
---
I'm just imagining this funny scenario in my head where someone is just minding his own business tanking a bunch of ghouls, and unbeknownst to him some newbie is waging war because he thinks he's not getting the kills he deserves. 
---
ive never seen a 10k plan..what are they for?
---
You will, almost as fast as a power fist
---
the 50% stacks i take no fall damage
---
reading this subreddit for a month, it's clear that people exaggerate or flat out lie. Everyone? no of course not. But when I read a post claiming 4 disconnects in a minute? You can't get on the game that fast. So yeah that guys lying. 
---
No one is sitting around plotting together to ruin this game. But some people have clearly made it their mission to. They pick up on genuine issues, and inflate them or in some cases, fabricate them. 
---
What sad lives. 
---
I think getting rid of the dupers and their hundreds of thousands of items will fix a lot of this.  Not all, I suspect, but a LOT.
---
They are. I am a PS4 player. I just downloaded them. When you login to the launcher there is a "not installed" notice next to 1, 2, Tactics. install, play. done.
---
With the snail pace of patches that still leave glaring problems I have no confidence in Bethesda's ability to fix this game.
---
There's a reason the jokes exist of modders always having to fix every title the company releases.
---
I bought this game but haven't had time to get into it.  Am I wrong or could some person just come up and blow that all to pieces?
---
That was my rationale as well, but I'm not sure how it actually maths out in application. As it stands, I have very little issue downing high-level armored enemies with my shotguns. I'm just nervous I haven't encountered anything with legitimately high armor; I think the most "armored" target I've faced is a 60-something Legendary Sentry Bot (whom I dismantled with extreme prejudice).
---
Covered bridges...... ooooOooOooOooo
---
Yes I have a 10mm TSE with the reload. Decked out in tricentennial paint. On of my IGfriends has a 10 mm sub TSE he won't sell it though.
---
Really? The holo tape of the saboteur said 'they won't shoot you unless you shoot them'. I wasn't about to test this out, but it's good to know.
---
And yeah, I've accidently hit a Whitespring bot. I died. A lot.
---
Do you get automatically disconnected from the sub 51 server when you go from 50 to 51?
---
Yep but folks have been farming camp m
---
As well. With sugar grove that 43 assaultron legendary usually weeds out the non hackers lolz 
---
Fast travel, it's quicker than doing the door thing.  I've tried the race for the door and died too...lol
---
How can you tell me it's two shot? How can you tell it's duped?
---
Can we start banning people that make stupid claims like that? If you want to say explosive shot guns make pvp broken, sure, do that. Otherwise, stop crying and making shit up
---
Can't confirm, but approve and endorse the varmints part 100%
---
Hmm you're certain?  I know the new craft overwrites the old blade but it's not listed as an ingredient to craft either.  You've tested it without the blade?
---
Burned out exactly at level 76 also, did everything but no nuke yet. Got all the PAs, activated all the workshops etc etc.
---
Put in probably 80 hours, but I don't think I'll touch the game ever again. A forgetable installment in the Fallout Series. A shame really.
---
So question I am wondering now I know a few more things. I know that CAMP disappear when you log off but what happens if a player builds a CAMP in the same area as you when you log back in? Cool concept, I eventually would like to do something similar since there are a few spots that are good CAMP spots for water purifier's.
---
**FIESTA**
---
didn't they even bothter fixing the grass glitching trough the floor in the reused fo4 stuff?
---
Ghoul thirst trap
---
Not much to say until we see patch notes, but glad it’s coming quickly.
---
Christmas I suppose. I mean literally the next patch is less than a week away. But I guess that's not soon enough for some. 
---
Maybe the game should let us build camps in **interior locations**, like Vault 88 in Fallout 4.  We can already fast travel in to and out of interior locations.  And some caves are very large, maybe not as photogenic as outdoor, but a good way to avoid certain outdoor creatures.  An "underground settlement" should appeal to some people since vaults are the same way.  And the game can add new interior locations the same way they will add vaults later.
---
I couldn't agree more.  But lead, in large quantities is hard to come by, so you've gotta take a workshop that produces it.  I make a lot of ammo, so I'm stuck claiming Lakeside Cabins and Poseidon for a couple days, build up lead and steel, craft a bunch of ammo, then hit up a nuke zone.  Rinse and repeat...
---
Yes, but there’s also a level of information between both extremes. I don’t expect them to post the patch notes this early especially since things can change in the meantime. But, I also expect them to provide something further than bug fixes when they’ve already confirmed new content is in development. Any high level details to the new PVP mode? Any lessons the team has learned during testing it? etc.  You don’t always have to provide concrete information - just be transparent about what you’re working on
---
I do have one option you can try, weapon artesian, grants 200% durability to weapons, a different perk fir armor as well, i haven't had to repair my weapons in a while, armor too.
---
Camps like this that use the environment to augment their structure are my absolute favourite. Grata job! 
---
What a fantastic point you make.
---
I'd keep the extra damage in case I bump into a few mirelurk queens or something
---
I want this too!
---
Yesterday I was chasing a lvl 5 trying to give him some stuff, but by the time I dropped it on the floor he was already gone. And I had to chase him again.
---
Again, I am happy to be criticized, but you keep just 'making' claims. Please provide a cite to the map showing all general plan spawn locations?   
---
As for the church, thank you, I will check it out, I was under the impression that the major spawns there were mods and black powder rifles, not plans, and since this is a guide for plans I didn't include it, but if it does indeed contain plans I will amend appropriately.   
---
I use the word 'If' because I don't tend to just take anyone at face value, you seem to get butt hurt easily. You will note that I thanked everyone else who provided information in this forum as well, but I also said I would verify their locations first, and added the locations with asterisks. You're not special in either a positive or negative way.
---
I'm a PC player. I understand the launcher issue is only a PC thing.
---
Glad to help. 
---
&gt; issues with several Challenges and quests   
---
Hey maybe they're fixing those challenges that reset every time you log out.  That would be great.    
---
&gt;  tackling various exploits we’ve seen   
---
Another duping fix?  Please be a duping fix.    
---
&gt; the number of plans Vendors have available   
---
And if they do something to prevent us from having to server hop to find recipes that would be fantastic too.
---
I should try that. I always spawn in the stream and get diseases. Thank you!

Happen to be using a charged barrel of any sort on a Tesla rifle?  That was causing my game to crash just removing the charged rifle barrel stopped all crashing.
---
I actually have never heard about this! Hoping they will as well! I'm honestly surprised they haven't bothered with raider paints yet. 
---
Maybe true, but it was a poor choice by Bethesda to make vendor inventory that level of random. And to make the regular prices for certain things so high, and cap availability so low, that farming cap stashes is one of the few semi reliable ways to accumulate money. 
---
yeah and their track record with patches is stellar for eliminating bugs. 
---
wow well that is just complete bullshit. 
---
You are 100% correct.
---
There are tons of things they could add into the game here and their but choose not too.  Even if they add a few new weapons every so often it is something new for players to use and grind for.
---
Try the WV Lumber mill. I tend to go there to stock up if I need too.
---
Wtf it’s Thursday and not one letter is on the wall in enclave bunker. [Fo76]
---
You picked the perfect time of day to grab that shot! The lighting / shadows look great and for some reason the render looks more detailed and sharp than it normally does when I'm running around in game on ultimate settings. Nice work OP!
---
My explosive Tesla rifle disagrees.
---
Good we are all agree. 
---
Sounds good. Assuming they mean what I think they mean, like fixing Handmade plans being plentiful up to lvl 19, and then almost disappearing. Also, dare I hope explosive and especially TSE weapons will be toned down at the end of the month? Because currently they're grotesquely out of line with everything else in the game.
---
Hope this thread gets traction. Alot of people could use this info.
---
Trading for ammo is more worth it than caps I have a pool table plan
---
This is what it is, the frame gets left behind when they TP 
---
I'm planning something like that also. I saw a video of someone and there was a molerat or something attacking the door outside which prevented the trapped person from fast travelling. They had the person locked in a 1x1 room with some glitch that had multiple doors in the same doorway, so they had to open a door, and then another, then another, etc.  I've also heard of tamed pets being hostile. Maybe that would be a way to prevent fast travel without the acid thing. If you have a hostile pet somewhere in the camp, if possible in a room if you can get them in a room or something. These are unknowns to me just some ideas. You could also have some flamethrower and tesla traps in the room instead of throwing a grenade.

Check the website. It's quicker than asking.

it's not greedy players, but criminals. There is this guy on Ebay that sells 10 TSE weapons, for 45 dollars. You might be saying who the hell buys that, but as ebay shows he already has 33 completed trades. He made 1485 dollars. I really hope Bethesda takes legal action.
---
They could have announced they weren’t updating anything, or they could have announced loot boxes. Plenty of things that could be more disappointing.
---
Thanks..I'm happy they are fixing stuff, but they are spending alot of time JUST fixing stuff imo. And im saying that as a hardcore fanboy at this point.
---
I usually spawn in the same place but it sure is inconvenient! I’ve got a camp spanning a stream by a bridge and I spawn at the bottom of a bank and all the things attacking are at the top. 
---
I thought it said 4000, which would be 4$. I guess 400 (.40$) is 'reasonable' but still, some people paid 60$ for this game; leaves a bad taste in our mouth when BGS tries to monetize on top of that, especially given the state of the game. But that's just the trend with AAA games and companies these days.
---
Its a bad game but a fun game with friends.
---
Theres lore but only for those wanting to read walls and walls of text. Or listen to long audio recordings that cant be paused, fast forward, or rewound

I know right?!

How the fuck these people so clueless?

We solved this weeks ago.

I've played fallout 1 before and had a blast, the change to console controller was the reason I didn't think it was going to happen. On a side note I still have my hard copy of 3 goty and play it from time to time. Played NV to death, would probably still play it if I wasn't enjoying 76 so much. 
---
Xbox and ps4 both support keyboard and mouse input the devs just have to turn support on for it. 
---
Good game, great fallout experience, awesome lore, and cool details everywhere you look. Not in shambles at all 
---
Side question:
---
I have [this](https://i.imgur.com/CkDdwRS.png) if you're interested. I'm willing to trade it for some caps, or plastic (I make a lot of shotgun shells).

I wonder how they'll nerf Tse weapons. Hopefully just making grenaider and explosive expert not work on them. I feel like that would be okay. That way there's not as many ways to boost there damage so you can still have an Uber weapons but only if you're specced right
---
One of the more popular base locations so it could be people joining nuked servers.  XP is almost irrelevant past lvl50 so it probably more to tag enemies for loot.
---
Removing Bullet sponges means completely replacing the armor, health and damage values of nearly every npc and perk in the game. It is a fuckton of busy work. Please wait until modded servers. You will get your wish on day one.
---
Radiate Ghoul Sexy Pose - 800 ATOMS.  
---
This is the correct answer, they power the region it is in and allow other players to have access to power without building too many generators (although a nuclear one is really just enough for 99 percent of the cases)
---
I found a set in the ash heap next to some lvl 40 mile monsters and lvl 42 ghould with occasionally robobrains, basement of the rusty pick makes no sense why lvl 15 stuff is there 
---
It's believe it was actually set for Tuesdays. Jan 1st: Tuesday, Dec 25:Tues, Dec 4: Tues, Dec 11: Tues, etc... There was one day *Inside the Vault* was on a Wednesday aside from yesterday.
---
Concur, fully specced commando build and my tse is just better at everything except slow play.
---
I've been having great success with unarmed weapons, actually. They have a much higher base damage, so even though there are less cards available they end up having similar damage values. My Grognak Axe has a few points higher damage than my power fist, but the power fist is a whole attack speed tier higher (and has innate armor piercing because of its mod). 
---
Since unarmed weapons can't be used in power armor though, its still a good idea to work on a two-hander spec as a backup for when you need to armor up and max out your damage output. That's really all I use my two-hander for nowadays since getting the powerfist
---

"Look at my junk" would be useful for several purposes, including "point to the paper pag"
---
No it's not that, the power leveling in this game is just way to damn fast to hit end-game, it's like what 8 hours to complete a build may be even longer now don't know really but doubt it, used to be 3 hours with a glitch that's been patched. I can see if the game had more end-game content then leave power leveling in, but you basically only have the Queen and Whitesprings if you think about it, because why explore other regions really when they do not compare. Speaking of high level loot runs there is only one place that is really good for loot and that is Whitesprings. It's becoming over crowded due to it being the only spot in the game of it's kind, every other spot you get way less Legendary mobs. The way it is now you have like 3-7 other players at Whitesprings without it being nuked, which is sad for how HUGE the game is.
---
Lots of lore but it's not spoon fed.
---
All i know is when i want my fallout fix I'll be firing up this game over the long term
---
That is correct. There are no console versions, nor will there ever be console versions of these games. You just have to DL the Beth Launcher thing, and login with your Beth account.
---
Strange in Numbers is currently bugged, if it's on it strips all positive mutation effects from you.  Super Duper has a 'que' it follows when crafting, which if you do alot of at once can result in the sound/animation playing on loop for a few minutes.  Some of the 'search' perk cards are bugged and not allowing folks to actually search for things.  Alot of feedback has gone in about how 'weak' damage perks are across teh board (bloody mess grants almost the same bonus for all weapons as a single perk card for a specialized weapon) and there are a number of 'whats what' issues with the specific weapon type perk cards (is a pipe rifle a pistol/rifle/auto weapon, as it can be all three of those depending on mods), and a number of other things (like for instance the quack surgeon perk gets up your team mate using booze, but they only have 1hp when resed for some reason)
---
Awesome, thank you very much, I'll add it with asterisks until verified. 
---
I assume you're one of the cucks that does this then?
---
Even in the atomic shop where they should be extra motivation to create content, there's barely anything. Would it kill them to have at least one or two skins available for each weapon? I'd think their art team could pop out at least a few recolors in a day.
---
Could u explain a bit more. So u like the colours . Does that help  lore. And where and what is the lore like in this game 
---
Creation engine takes items in your inventory into account for missions, so yes having a large inventory does slow things down.

anyone that googles "crash to desktop" and "fallout" or "skyrim" will see tons of threads were people with tons of crap are crashing to desktop because of the amount of crap they hold on to.

Holy shit... after last night's announcement, I saw some joker post "today we're happy to announce we're going to announce things later."
---
Turns out he nailed it
---
What is this crap that actually required a build-up? "We're gonna fix stuff."
---
Enter the fanboys and lowbars to defend this useless "update," as they fail to notice how Beth quietly backslides on their specific statements about notes and communication. 
---
Something is fishy.  You could have posted this last night,  Beth, and it would've been well-received. No stupid build-up to nothing.  No hype.  Just clear, honest communication. 
---
Could be sentinel armor. A full set with 75% damage resist on top of normal armor DR essentially makes you unkillable and ruins pvp.

If you're in pa you'll be fine.

I went into my first sqb completely over prepared. In the end, while solo, i used 5 rad away and maybe 10 stimpaks.

The only challenge is will the group do enough damage.

God dang that GUT
---
*sharpens shovel*
---
I simply cannot justify the point. You are spending 4 perk points to gain 10hp.
---
That's horrible! 1 Endurance gives you 49 hp to work with. 4 gives you 54. Then equip life giver for 64 hp.
---
You are getting like 3hp per perk/point into END. Its gets worse after that. 
---
Assuming. No mutations. 
---
I think the first thing they need to do is remove or increase the budget of CAMP's. It bothers me if you are able to collect the materials to build a nice settlement then you should be able to make it whatever size. I get that FO76 is mirroring survival mode but they have really handcuffed players. Also would like to have a store setup so that other players can buy water/food from my settlement. You could also add other things and prices could be predetermined by Beth. to keep people from price gouging. 
---
There is more to it.
---
Bethesda is still doing a piss-poor job with communication.  Their recent “Inside the Vault” was a complete joke.  Three paragraphs of absolutely nothing interesting.
---
And they have yet to add new content.
---
Additional stars are going to be appealing to treasure hunters, but they're not going to make the variety of weapons capable of doing thousands of points of aoe/melee damage useless.
---
Must have been the psycho... Addictol wiped it out.
---
get rid of the turrets and spot lights and you could probably make the house 3x the size
---
Lmfao... Hyuhyu
---
They specified what is being fixed in the patch on monday but didn't give patch notes as things may change between today and the day of the patch (they may fix some additional things, or remove a fix as they find it breaks something else in a much more damaging way), and that we'll get two major patches/updates this month.
---
You are the one not respecting your fellow players dude. If people wanna make grinding whitesprings cost less ammo and overall easier for themselves then that's their prerogative. You destroying their camp is what's messed up. I dont even go to whitesprings anymore due to the fact that it's always got 3 other players there but either way you got the bounty for a reason.
---
This isn't a base dillweed it's purely turrets, it's waste land justice.

With two ranks of Hard Bargain and a Charisma of 2 I can usually clear two vendors each hour.  If you get a workshop that regularly gets attacked by animals you have a good chance at getting enough meat to clear a vendor pretty much every hour.  Glowing steaks become extremely common at higher levels as well and with my

 trading load-out I get 7 caps a piece for them.  With three ranks of through hiker you can pretty much carry all of the meat so I don't need to worry about weight much either - carting it all around.
---
There hav ebeen many talks and solutions posted on this Reddit, if you've been following. One of the most popular / common ones is introducing new items with a Lvl 60 or 70 cap (as an example) that would make current items not the best, along with nerfing the Two Shot / Explosive effects. While good, this won't work until they fix the dupe glitch.

These are becoming incredibly underwhelming. No roadmap, small vague fixes, and it's been a fucking month since the last small AF update and now we get another small one. This game has been out for two months and the only thing that has happened are fixes to problems persisting since Fallout 4 and back. Most companies would see something like the exploits/duping and crack down on it right away, but Bethesda says little to nothing and allows this shit go on for over a month. I understand that this is a new group making this game but Bethesda was my 100% favorite Dev and it's so hard to see this constant incompetence. I still even play Oblivion on the Xbox but have only logged on to 76 once recently, and it was only to see if the person who stole my buddy's account was fucking around with it. Get 2FA for fucking christ so that shit doesn't happen. From canvas to glass it's honestly akin to meeting your childhood hero, only to be let the fuck down. I want to love you guys at Beth again, please just give me a reason to.
---
Aw maaaaan. That’s all I need to complete my pistol build
---
Easy enough, crisis averted!  Maybe not for OC, but some people just can't be saved lol
---
They appear all over the place. If you see the map marker for an event hover over it and it will say the name. If its a normal one it will have some kind of witty name related to what it is but horde will literally be goul horde or super mutant horde.
---
I think ‘packs’ of decorations would be nice from the atom store. Like 3-5 items that are similar or themed put together. It’s hard dropping so many atoms on more decorations when they are so small and not coordinated.
---
Hopefully.

Pshawa you high level whiners. I found the best hiding spot in a Cranberry Patch trench with a roof and everything. She lost me there but Luckily I had my Black Powder Pistol when the level 22 Mutie showed up.

 On my way north to Harper's Ferry at level 12. ;) 
---
Yeah, I think this game is introducing a huge culture shift for the studio in regards to post-launch support. The modding community has always been a big selling point for their games, but now that they don't have that crutch they're hobbling along to try to figure it out. 
---
Hmmm good to know thanks!
---
I'm not complaing about the bounty, idk about that. And I respect and help anyone. Did you not look through the other pictures, he's using exploits to place more turrets than the camp allows and lagging the area. 
---
I've not logged into it in a month and a half. These updates about updates are fucking stupid. 
---
Just use your other characters?
---
No difference on plans. I always do 100% because it's easy if you know the route to run. All 3 chars have gotten the plans in different orders. 
---
Im going to need you to move your desk as far back against that wall as possible, mkay, that would be ger-rayte
---
So I am on week 2 and I have only experienced 2 server drops. The big thing I come across is ghouls not dying right away when i shot them dead or not taking damage while I am unloading a mag on them.
---
I'm genuinely curious here, because I play this game very often and I want to PVP people but nobody ever wants to play back.
---
If she doesn't attack them back, the slap damage is basically nothing.
---
So again, you aren't getting whacked if you don't damage them back or otherwise engage in PVP.
---
I broadly concur, no tests but I have noticed logging back in stuff has spoiled that wasn’t before logging out. 
---
Super mutant behemoth? 
---
Its not that. Its that the updates that the patch notes pertain to are actually taking fucking ages. 
---
What you described is icing on the shitcake.
---
Anytime I see one I kill it for the leather. I’m always running out of it
---
I love these CAMP posts. Bravo. 
---
I stopped playing just before xmas but will return for vault openings. I never came across anyone's CAMPs while I played but certainly would love it to come across some of the ones I've seen posted on this sub. 
---
Can you? How do u transfer between them? I didn't know they had there own storage tbh
---
I was playing FO76 the other night for the first time since around launch. I was mostly questing through the main story, I got to the point of the BOS quest at the Asylum.
---
It activated an event for me, but I didn't know a level 144 was also there (I was around 20 or 21). Which made all the enemies somewhere in the 50-60's. Anyhow, I stuck around with him (no mic) and decided to "help" as much as I could. Killed a Scortchbeast or two and collected a ton of XP which brought me up to level 22 or 23. We were wrapping up the last wave and the event was about to end, but then the server kicked me. :(
---
I re-connected and played a little longer. But just felt so beaten and sad. Also, what's up with the way XP is calculated? Shouldn't quests be giving out way more?
---
I think beth would like nothing more than for everyone to forget 76 ever existed
---
&gt; I finished that bloody questline!
---
If you mean the clown one, I have bad news for you.
---
....which they hyped up the night before lol. 
---
"Follow us on Twitter!" Dear God they've become just like those useless say- nothing copycat YouTubers. "Here's my version of PSA I saw on reddit where I drone on for ten minutes before telling you about a two-key command, like and subscribe! "
---
They may have done a legitimate trade for one. 
---
I think these prefixes are also too strong compared to others. Two Shot and Explosive are essentially two traits each. 
---
Two shot doubles DPS and ammo efficiency, compare that with double/quad. 
---
Explosive increases dps and gives you area damage, therefore also kinda increasing ammo efficiency and dps further. 
---
And yes, the very least is that those shouldn't stack.
---
I saw the protectron vendor once and paid it no mind. Didn't realize my mistake until later. 
---
Hmm, I wonder if Bethesda changed this since last time I tried then. I'm not home to try it right now, but I wonder if they patched that with the last patch? Before, the blade came up as a mandatory component, and would not let people craft it without the blade... same with the other Mistress of Mysteries weapons. If it wasn;t in inventory, the crafting menu for the item was greyed out, basically because a component was missing.. hmmm. I know there have been a lot of complaints about people losing their stuff permanently. 
---
Same last night.  Sad and your right their CAMPS are shitty.  
---
I would kill to do dope stuff like this. So far the community on Xbox (that I've come across so far) are just assholes that wanna kill you for no reason. I expected more from this community and it's super disappointing so far. If anyone decides to do something like this on Xbox count me in!
---
&gt;We'll have patch notes available to go along with the patch, but some of the things we're planning to address include issues with several challenges and quests, various fixes to a number of perks and weapons, and tackling various exploits we've seen.
---
oof. im obviously excited for them to stop exploits, but the way it was worded, that bit implied two things. the main point is that this *screams* nerfs. There have been few adjustments to mechanics, perks, quests, and weapons that have been in our favor. seriously concerned about that one, especially since the other thing being implied is that these nerfs will not be mentioned in the patch notes. I honestly think they ended that paragraph with mentioning of fixing exploits to detract from the nerfs..
---
&gt;fixing legendary mods
---
99% this is going to bar 2 shot and explosive being compatible. at the very least, it's going to remove its OP status.
---
im hoping the patch notes will be thicc. while the new things coming are exciting, this blog was a lot of vague assurance and lubing up. very concerning that they didn't address constant crashes (both client and server).
---
That’s what I’ve been wanting for ages now! Also the ability to transfer ownership as well.
---
There's the 'force respawn' exploit people use to farm whitesprings for legendaries, and the whole 'agressive deathclaw pets' thing that gives people bounties for defending themselves
---
Yikes. Yeah that should also see some work then.
---
Lol gesh dude. Have you even played 76 in the last month I'd say it's got way fewer bugs now than we did last year. The patch hasn't even released yet and your already assuming it's not going to fix anything. If your that unhappy just don't play period, no one is making you play a game you obviously don't like.
---
crossing fingers toes and other crossable parts of my anatomy for a bigger stash &gt;&lt;
---
&gt;aim up to the air with a flare gun, and let fly, hoping
---
This needs to be a thing!  I never thought about using a flare gun this way, but it's genius!  Start handing them out to newbies exiting the Vault, and if you see a flare pop see if they need assistance.  At the very least, you can help them regain their junk and clear out the baddies.
---
I have a second account i gotta say it makes playing 100% more enjoyable. no more inventory management minigame.
---
indeed, there should be game breaking priorities in the fix list
---
Nah. It was rose's stuff.. I haven't touched that one yet... I have been put off wendigos and all wendigo related things for the time being
---
Okay, "dillweed" a bunch of turrets is still a base. Just because it doesn't fall under your cookie cutter preference of a base doesn't make it not a base. You're still destroying another players CAMP. That's still not respectful to other players. 
---
Fine, destroy their base, don't do it under the guise of respecting other gamers though. Say it ruins your grind and they can go fuck themselves or something if you're going to destroy it. You're just being a hypocrite with your reasoning. 
---
Not that I've ever seen. I've had a painted set for aeons that always shows the mark.
---
Your base , neon signs and letters was 12 k without hard bargain but I had full hard bargain got it for 9800
---
Why was this removed for spam?
---
The mistake they made was announcing this post in advance. Speaking as someone who actually likes the game and enjoys playing it, the past few nights I said I might stop playing until the next patch--the bugs, glitches and annoyances are unavoidable, and I don't want to start not liking this game I clearly enjoy.
---
They way announced this article had me legitimately excited to read something akin to patch notes today to see what all would be fixed/added. But an update to say there will be an update isn't an update--especially since you already said that in the last article. This ItV was clickbait and a disappointing waste of time.
---
I'd like to point you to the vast collection of WoW mods that some may have even become part of the actual game

You can hinder yourself if you want, but I'll say I've been running mods on it for over 200 hours and it's just fine. If you aren't dumb and open something up you shouldn't - why is FO76 getting heat for banning Cheat Engine users? Literally any other online game would too - and you stick to Bethesda's file format, the worst that happens is your game crashes
---
First time I did that I was like lvl 30 or 40 and I got my shit rocked. I finished it but damn I went through all my stimpacks and ammo. 
---
very clever!  really like this idea.  bravo!
---
Actually quite to the contrary, Thank you very much, exactly what I've been looking for (And no doubt everyone who has upvoted this).   
---
I suppose I could have been more tactful and just 'asked nicely' for the link to the map, but the less tactful route worked too. I gladly bow to your superior wisdom if that makes you happy, I'll go ahead and post this link right at the top of my post as a shortcut to this.   
---
You've helped a lot of people with that one post far more then you did with any of your earlier posts. 
---
That's a great idea actually. I like it a lot. It amazes me how many good ideas are suggested here on Reddit. If you took the best ideas, this game would be so much better 👍
---
release day
---
yes
---
Theres tons of lore in the game dude, like entioned earlier, its NOT handed to you on a silver platter. All the terminals and holotapes paint a picture of a very dire situation and the realistic struggle of the few humans who survived the initial blasts . ALso WV was depicted as a prime example of automation, thats why there are so many robots instead of humans. So many locations too with plenty of interseting findings! Good luck and safe travels through the wastes!

can i get some sweet sticky nectar to roll myself in so the scorchbeasts cant help but fly right up to me &amp; i can punch them in the jaw?
---
It's so fun having a kind of berserker mode where you maybe get 50% increased XP but you have to chain the kills or something, so you have to do it fast, there's a sense of urgency to keep the buff up, like combo points, increasing XP. That's what I thought of when reading your post.
---
Random events, spawn alongside whatever predator would have killed them like a deathclaw. If you're just seeing the brahmin someone else may have passed through and killed the predator or they wandered off to attack something else. 
---
Unpolished, but good game with a bad rap. I have spent 250+ hours and had a great time alone and with friends. I was certainly apprehensive going into the game. Previous Fallout games reinforced the lone wolf mentality and while I really wanted "Fallout with Friends," I wasn't sure if it would pan out. Glitches are definitely annoying, but they are simply area of potential improvement. They will get better over time. As is, I have more than gotten my money's worth from the game. It has changed my perspective and I have grown from the lone wolf to wanting to be part of a pack. I even get slightly nervous going into a more potentially dangerous area when I don't have my friends by my side. I have come to benefit having companions to share in the journey. I look forward to more content for Fallout 76, and do think the future is bright.
---
You literally just mentioned balance in the comment before this one. I don't understand your reasoning? Do you wan't balance or realism?
---
This is a neat idea.  Being able to build our own kind of [free states style bunker camp](/spoiler) would be sweet.
---
Oh, so releasing patch notes the same day prevents negative posts? Are you that fucking stupid? Or maybe you're just talking out your ass with no logic or facts behind it. 
---
"Will start losing players..." a bit late on that one. 
---
You have a link to your build a anywhere. I'm interested in making a pistol build.
---
Late to answer, the Deliverer, along with mods for it are in the game's files, however it seems that the server hasn't been coded to drop it yet.
---
Likely it's something they decided to hold for a content drop later, along with weapons like the compound bow.
---
All things serve the beam
---
looks amazing great imagination 
---
Heck I'll take one man lol

Thats because its easy for people on reddit to go yeah sure il go, then to actually go

Yesterday I tracked down a bounty with over 800 caps on their head, sneak attack head shot while cloaked from right next to them with all the armor ignore you can get from perks and my anti armor lever action did at most 10% of their health. 
---
I can build you one on either t-60 or t-51b. You’d have to wait till I get off work in 5 hours though.
---
yeah, but devs would be able to check who has an unobtainable amount of nuka colas and theoretically delete them. just wait, i am predicting much wailing and gnashing of teeth by the end of the month.
---
Sure. The environments in game are varied. Starter area is a big lush forest.   There's a desolate salt flat like toxic area, blackened ash heap area.
---
As you move east it shifts to a more elevated rockey forest and endgame ish area is a mix between a thicket of forest and an open bog all stained a reddish hue due to lore.
---
In regards to lore it explains why no one is alive and individuals write notes or record tapes about there experiences.
---
You can find notes indicating a family member went to town for supplies then find a corpse and a holo tape explaining what happened. That type of lore explanations is everywhere.
---
Personally i never cared about the lore in previous fallout games but in this game i actually care alot as a world with no living ppl is vague and i want to know why. And you find out why but at first its grim story after grim story.
---
well you can have the teammate fast travel there and then youf ast travel after for free, but its a big pain if your friend is busy or afk etc
---
i would even pay to fast travel there, its just very difficult for things like the nuclear disposal site where there arent named locations very close by and you have to fast travel and then run for awhile to get there
---
YES
---
I have used my flare gun before, nothing happened. Though when I was on a team, no mic at the time, and we split up, I used it and they fast traveled to me.
---
Well I think I’ll
---
Come back after anthem comes out and is dead, then maybe Beth will have some content in their game ahahahaha
---
After a second look like man I can't even figure out how those foundations are laid out... like what the hell. How are the two foundations lined up so perfectly? I didn't know you could get two levels of foundations?
---
Dude, didn't you see the new wood armor skin in the atomic shop!?
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
And it's only 14.99 per limb!
---
On the 14th.
---
If you are the only person there it isn't hogging kills.
---
Big ups to Avon Lee. or at least the road to it.
---
I’m a melee build and it only takes me about 60 seconds to kill one. If there are 3 plus it’s a bit of a fight, but still doesn’t last long. Just have to developer a strategy with your build is all. Once you maximize damage/ get to a higher level you will be alright
---
I paid $80 for the Tricent Edition (and appreciate all the goodies that came with it. Though it's weird how I didn't get the bobblehead. Or maybe I was just misremembering stuff)
---
I have absolutely no problem with the Atom Store since I have a boatload of atoms from doing stuff in the game. It's all cosmetics. Nobody's forced to buy it. It's just neat optional stuff to buy with your hard-earned atoms. And it's a trade-off for all future DLC being free for the game, since how else are they supposed to get funding for said DLC? (
---
You can fast travel to the friend at the workshop for free.
---
I can craft T-60 &amp; T-51 Jetpack for free if you provide the mats, can also craft T-60 Calibrated shocks! lemme know if you want the material list(s)
---
We need more similar places
---
Quad/Double aren't exactly 'ammo' modifiers though, they are 'capacity' modifiers and I view them as being in the same boat as say 'light weight/weightless' or stat bonus effect.  I also think the 'flat damage increase' would fall in the 'ammo' slot.
---
Here, let me explain in a different way.
---
Ammo/Primary slot legendary effects: Things that increase the damage across the board, like Bunker Buster's 20% dmg increase, or two shots double damage, etc.
---
Boost/Modifier slot legendary effects: This is your quad/double capacity effects, your special bonuses and your 'weight reduction' mods
---
Specifice/Situational slot legendary effects: This is things like +damage to enemy type x, Nocturnal/Dayurnal effects (not sure on the later), hell, I'd even put Furious in this group as it's 'effect' only applies from subsequent hits to a single target, and resets if you hit something else
---
I have two accounts on PC and it was that best investment ever. I am able to open to separate gaming sessions and have both accounts in the same server at the same time. 
---
 **My 2 caps**: (**PS4**)...yes, its got annoying bugs, but i realized the hundreds of hours ive put into it have been fun.  Its exciting/addictive/annoying/frustrating, but still here i am enjoying.  actually, it's analogous to real life, and maybe thats what people love playing. survival/good/bad, but your alive and have things you want to do.
---
finding a rare item is like a success in life. building an awesome CAMP feels great. grinding for mats is also fun when you find a real stash of it.
---
I'd say BGS has made a real keeper (not popular sentiment, i know). This game has so much potential.
---
finally, and this should say something. Its the most hours ive put into any game, and ive played a ton of great games, but never went back for seconds except (Last of Us).
---
Luckily you can sorta air strafe
---
On Xbox I have my camp with a toolbox inside the parameter of my camp. My secondary has his camp there and I throw all the shit I want to transfer in there. I join off some random person in the lobby and then pick everything up off him. Poor guy has 9,000 pounds on him because I can’t let go of all the legendaries I find, useful or not.

They will do nothing retroactively regarding duping. Mark my words.
---
Clean black suit? I have the new years bundle and I like the black tuxedo. Could that be of interest for you and you're John wick character?
---
As others are pointing out, pistols don't need to be improved, really.  The endgame effectiveness of a VATS build is quite high against anything with a head.
---
BUT:
---
* You only get there in the end game.  At level 42 you get Critical Savvy and level 47 provides Critical Banker.  The effect of just these two perks at max level is to almost triple your DPS against most enemies when used with headshots.  At level 40 with a .44 revolver, you will struggle to bring down high health enemies like Supermutants.  At level 49, you'll take down Warlords with that same six shooter without reloading.
---
* It only works if you have a head to target.  Your DPS still lags other builds against scorchbeasts and other boss-styled enemies.
---
* The top-level DPS of single-shot weapons remains lower, no TSE shotgun-like weapons are available. That means you'll always be somewhat gimped in PVP contexts.
---
Honestly I liked my pistolier.  It's a fun play style with a lot of ammo flexibility.  And it works well into the endgame.  But it's definitely challenging.
---
Enclave set as well as patrolman shades. Looks pretty intimidating if I do say so. I'm trying to get that damn hunters long coat but cant get it to show up in the vendors inventory 
---
No cause thats' too abundant already. Would have to be only from legendary scrapping. And then after scrapping 30~ you can use it to apply a legendary effect to your weapon. And another 30 for 2nd effect. Or whatever.
---
Don’t think I agree with that implementation, but I agree we need something better to do with midrange legendaries than sell them to vendors for 12 caps
---
It just works.
---
I see people complaining about certain issues and am just like "fix your machine or upgrade your internet." I think quite a few issues are more personal problems that people just blame on bethesda.
---
You might like Trapper Armor
---
&gt;With the snail pace of patches that still leave glaring problems I have no confidence in Bethesda's ability to fix this game.
---
Snail pace? It's not even 2 months old. I can't think of of a single game that has ever had a bug patch released as fast and substantial as what people are expecting from Bethesda.
---
Wow. 
---
They haven’t stated a word AFAIK about being unable to stop duping.
---
Make sure you have Starched Genes and Class Freak.  Those are two must have perks for mutations.
---
Then go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar.  People are selling and trading serums there.
---
That would also be a good fix.
---
It is the worst, It rarely happens to me but it sucks when I am in the middle of something.
---
Hit start button on game. Go to community/hub?(forget which is is) and the look at the options. Using lb/rb you’ll be able to scroll through the pages. I believe one should have your stats. It may be there.
---
Holy crap that camp looks AMAZING!
---
Make sure you have Starched Genes and Class Freak. Those are two must have perks for mutations.

Then go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar. People are selling and trading serums there.
---
Right on, thanks. 
---
Yes. I don't remember the whole gt, but did it have ninja in it? 
---
They're cool, but not that great. Better off investing into a different heavy weapon.
---
Receiver wise I think prime only works for the queen yes. Unless both receiversa are the same but one has more armor pen making it more suitable for the SQB. Wich seems unlikely tbh. Scorchkiller receiver only talks about the scorched/infected so I would assume its not SQB relevant.
---
well if they were going to lift the cap limit they would have to do something about the nuka colas.
---
That really sucks, it has happened to me too.
---
I have mine not far from vault 76 right on a lake next to the saw mill, plenty of wood, snaptails ,blood leaf, firecaps and glowing mushrooms since they all spawn right there 
---
In the photo mode, push the 'Distance' Slider back a ways, in brings objects in the distance back into focus. :)
---
Lol took me 2 days of server hopping for me to get it 
---
you would need a friend I guess.  How would you transfer them between two copys of the game?
---
Maybe, the problem is that there are just WAY to many cap sinks in the game as it stands
---
So what... You only play one game at a time and when a new one comes along you never come back again?
---
If you're playing nothing but 76 all day every day then you have more problems than someone that goes back and forth depending on what they feel like playing.
---
People are allowed to stop playing this game for a while until the next big patch or update hits. 
---
Yes. Its all cheating. Im not trying to convince you im right - just saying it's the way i roll &amp; what i believe. 
---
You said it yourself: "you can hinder yourself if you want". That implies you have an advantage that i dont have in an online game by using mods. 
---
Im not trying to debate. I dont care if you choose to use mods. I dont. I wont.... But ya did open the door to me winning a little debate by the language you chose to use in your comment 😄
---
 The reason my X0-1 Torso will stay level 40 till I find another Jet Pack. For me its just RNG surfing a bit so I expect it won't be too hard.
---
It’s in challenges, I’m on pc though. There’s a challenge to play 7600 hours and it logs your time against that. Hopefully it’s the same on Xbox 
---
If dont want it I'll buy it lmao

---
This will absolutely expand. The atom shop helps though.
---
Before people say "*meh they charge money blah blah*": they literally give you atom for playing the game. I've spent several thousand atoms and still have about 3k. Have spent no real money; there's no point.
---
I mean, it was pretty annoying to have to two kill Evan...
---
To trade for from another player? You can go to the Penitentiary to find 5 or so lying around, so worthless, imo.
---
Clean straight jacket is harder to get and might run for some caps, though.
---
That's IF the vendors have money. No matter how many times I server hop, every vendor in the world seems to have 0 caps (even after trying to sell anyway to see if the number is just glitched like it often is)
---
Guess whats getting nuked on server im on now...lol
---
According to the tooltip it's 100 caps.
---
Ableist?
---
And the one I just left.
---
They do exist but they're just not plentiful.
---
At the same time the demand isn't high so the price isn't crazy.
---
Hail. You grace is with your presence.
---
I agree to the front page with this
---
My god, feeling sorry for them ghouls almost
---
You can find a lot of them at Fort Defiance. The clean straight jacket can only be found on the random Charleston responder trader protectron.
---
forcing people login repeatedly to get plans was a dumb mechanic and likely contributed to server instability
---
glad it is getting changed, hopefully they just make all plans available
---
They spawn at the asylum it's "worth" as an item in the game is set to 200 caps vendors will give you 11-40 for them if you sell them, but to other players, it's easy to obtain so not sure it's value outside of not looking for one yourself.
---
Wait fit the patch notes.
---
Last time they tried to fix it they didn't directly state it either.
---
It's trully magnificent
---
If that doesn't work, you can call up the main menu and go to 'challenges'. I think under the 'player' tab there's a challenge that tracks how many hours you've played. 
---
What is there to recover from exactly? Duping will get fixed. Player vendors are coming. People can buy and sell. New items will be released. New 4 and 5 star legendaries. Just because a few more people have end game items doesn't change anything. Now instead of 1% of people having a TSE and dominating any server they enter, everyone can have one and play on an even playing field. Who even knows what the drop chances are. A lot of people could be getting them from drops, but duping just dominates the discussion as if that is the only way to acquire them..
---
There's nothing special about energy weapons. You just had bad rolls, I think. Could be the server, too. Try again later.
---
It's frustrating, I know. I've probably gone through more materials scrapping Marine armor than you've collected...
---
The division? OH HELL NO! The first one was in a much worse state than fo76!
---
The queen is just a legendary enemy like any other, sometimes she drops nothing. That's why they give you a guaranteed legendary drop along with the event rewards. 
---
I get it bro. I imagine it’s a tough job. I bet it’s hard to see the good or lighthearted sometimes if you are surrounded by bad and seriousness. 
---
I haven’t expanded to getting lowbies yet. I probably won’t unless the queen drops me another damn explosive vent and shitty legendary. Mainly just 50+ players at Ferry.
---
Fair and I’m not saying they aren’t annoying but if you have to drop 800 bullets to down one should find another method for killing them
---
Careful of Golf course base, it's a favorite drop site for Nukes
---
“Discovered that the Handmade Rifle plans were mistakenly only available for purchase for characters leveled 15-20 from two vendors. This plan has been removed permanently from all vendors.”
---
It might need to take a couple of dozen shots to balance it, (or to apply a strong enough dose) but that would make for such a cool encounter.
---
I've found that just wandering through the forest harvesting every downed tree I see with the perk that gives you more wood give me so much wood I don't have to think about it for almost a week.
---
Do we know for sure Explosive is even working the way it's supposed to? It seems absurdly powerful, to the point where maybe a decimal place has slipped or something in the code.
---
It really is lame, and other people one shotting legendary enemies us getting real friggin' old...
---
I saw the tux in the new years bundle too but I passed on it. He doesn't wear a tux like James Bond does. It's usually a Kevlar or similar lined dark suit, black or grey etc.

Pretty sure if FO76 that the radio channels on the pipboy are streaming.  My bro and I play and we hear exactly the same radio from the stations avail.

Sadly, you're getting downvoted for speaking the trutb. No company will ever want to pour millions into something that won't generate a profit unless they already have a cash flow from *something* (in this case, microtransactions) or are a non-profit organization. 
---
Sweet! I will enjoy that. :D
---
Last night someone nuked the Whitesprings and I went in, mostly to pick those pretty flowers and I ran past two guys who had all the Whitespring bots turning them into paste. I laughed, cause I've been there, and kept picking my flowers.
---
Sent you a PM. Much appreciated.
---
&gt;The problem is almost all the assets were flipped from Fallout 4 and Skyrim, and it’s so painfully obvious.
---
this isn't a problem if there is ample of other new stuff. re-using assets is really smart, and if it's also a reskin/remake it's not just lazy, but smart (don't re-invent the wheel; just re-align it).
---
the problem is they haven't put enough time into other new stuff so it's essentially just a "big asset flip" like you said. very bland stuff.
---
Exploits haven't affected your gameplay? Have you been to a whitesprings nuke in the last couple weeks? Everyone there has a two shot explosive weapon laying waste to entire mobs with ease. Personally, the exploits are ruining the game. There is no more struggle bc you can buy every rare item in the game here on reddit for 3-5k caps. You can buy serum recipes for 2,000 caps now. I still enjoy the game, but I'd rather see them fix major issues before pushing new content. New content doesn't mean shit if all the good bits get duplicated and sold or I constantly crash out of servers. 
---
Love this! Might give something similar a go. I like the space under the bridge - v nice
---
exactly. the solution is not to nerf whitesprings. its to create more whitesprings. people love to farm legendaries. why not have more changes to get that chameleons wood chest piece. 
---
Haven’t logged on in a month. Oh well, maybe next month. 
---
Thank you! By the way I found a clean space helmet. I don't know if it's rare but it spawned in the locker room at Whitespring.
---
Country roads...
---
Thanks for that, post edited for correctness.
---
Drifter outfit, black cowboy hat, wraparound goggles, and a red bandana.
---
Generally, people on this sub do not want to hold Bethesda or Zenimax responsible for this product.
---
So expect lots of downvoting and excuses in the comments and anything avoiding an actual answer about duping and game balance.
---
I don't want to be the "you shouldn't be there at that level guy," but, you shouldn't be there at that level. Instead of rushing the story as far as possible, spend a little time exploring the areas and doing events. It's worth getting to 50, at least before getting into the late-story/endgame. First, your going to be in areas where there are high level players (because where else should they be?), so getting to the point where you can handle the max level enemies will help you out. And secondly, when you get unique gear rewards from quests, they are scaled to your level. Finish the quest at level 20, get a level 20 weapon that you'll never use after 10 levels. Get the same weapon at level 50, you get the same weapon with capped stats that you can use forever.
---
Wait what?
---
That's assuming the team that does the 'face' type work for the company even knew what was being worked on.  They may have waited till today to get a response email from the dev team about what kinds of things they are working on to have out on monday (namely fixes for exploits and broken perk cards)
---
Deathclaw island should have that many deathclaws that actually scale to your lvl instead of just 1 lvl21 wussyclaw.
---
Good deal
---
Flatwoods is my slaughterground
---
I like particularly that Brahmin indoors... He's the tastiest 
---
You absolutely drop mats, even if you randomly die to an enemy someone can come snipe your bag
---
Honestly dude? Grow up. You seem like a child, unable to correctly punctuate and spell. “I was expecting a response” sorry, what? Who made you so important the entire game’s faults, and other peoples problems come after your question?
---
And you was not on passive mode, it’s a mechanic. If you had it enabled, you wouldn’t be damaged. At all.
---
I’m not sure what makes me disbelieve you the most, the lack of intellect or the whole “i think the sun shines out of my ass i’ve been hard done by” mentality.
---
On XBox it's located in Challenges
---
I would additionally be absolutely down for an "automatically bulk junk beyond X quantity" toggle or at least a good way to highlight the ones we are over limit on in the tinkers bench. 
---
Also a stash sorting option that puts bulked and unbulked junk of the same material (e.g. aluminum scrap and Bulk Aluminum) together so I can see how much I have total of the things I bulked for weight saving purposes.
---
I've gotten 47 caps per straight jacket when selling to vendors with full Hard Bargain.
---
I swear there were these things in the lore called scorchbeast lures that would like bring them in and immobilize them but I never seen or heard of them being used by players are they even in the game? 
---
They are totally worth it I have 200 aluminum and 200 uranium just from grabbing the red rocket stop everyday and play for a couple of hours. It's crazy
---
Not sure 9f you are being sarcastic but you can nuke anywhere but the vault.
---
Aliens...
---
I used a bit of trickery and the upper foundations on the one side are actually not attached, just placed very, very close with the rest of the build.
---

&gt;Last week we mentioned that we would be starting the new year with new patches. The first of those will be coming January 14. Like the December 11 update, this patch will address many issues raised by the community as well as continue focus on improving performance and stability.  
---
&gt;We’ll have the patch notes available to go along with the patch, but some of the things we’re planning to address include issues with several Challenges and quests, various fixes to a number of Perks and weapons, and tackling various exploits we’ve seen.  
---
&gt;Beyond Monday’s patch, we’re working on another patch that we hope will hit near the end of the month. This patch will continue to add fixes for issues being voiced by the community, including the number of plans Vendors have available, fixing a few Legendary mods, and continuing to address issues with some Perks.  
---
&gt;We will continue to keep you updated as we move forward with more patches, new content, and new additions to Fallout 76.
---
Oof, yea. Well I hope a suit like that comes soon.
---
Not everyone likes to min/max like a loser like you, ❤️
---
It is a bit but the clean spacesuit plus helmet can net near 3k caps
---
It sure is
---
I am just banking perk points at this point after I got most of the things I want for my current build. 
---
The code is global and resets every week. This site keeps it updated (I’d recommend bookmarking it) https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
I’ve only done one nuke and it was with a friend. I just had to follow the little quest diamond icons, then eventually enter the code from that website.
---
IMO it’s doable at your level, you’ll just need to be prepared for it to take a while and bring a good amount of stimpacks and make sure your weapons/armor are repaired. 
---
damn, wish i had the caps alone
---
I mean, if I were to fix a problem like duping, but for some reason have to wait a few days to do so, I wouldnt go "oh yeah, no exploits after update x! Dupe now because you won't be able to very soon!" And make a week of very unstable servers.
---
I'm not excusing the state of the game, but something like that you dont announce.
---
Yeah, honestly just saying "We're planning to fix stuff" isn't really much, the only important thing about that was when the patch is coming out, but other than that i feel like they keep it too vague
---
Personally I would rather have them finish fixing the game first and THEN add stuff, because i wouldn't be surprised to find out that adding new stuff will break even more stuff in the game as it is, and that's the last thing this game needs IMO
---
Would pay a lot of atoms for a non-combat Husky that followed me around!  Or even that just chilled at camp.  Place a doghouse and the dog stays within a certain range of it, wandering around doing dog things. 
---
Id want it to be a minor effect.
---
A CAMP in that spot is fine, but if it's lined with turrets then you are going to get an orbital strike...
---
did you have starched genes on?
---
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean this as a comment on the slot idea but rather just a balance perspective disconnected from that. Even as a single modifier I feel that two shot and explosive are in their current state too strong as they are effectively already as good as two other effects combined. 50% Armor-Piercing would still be inferior to Two Shot. 
---
So the effects themselves should be tweaked in their magnitudes, too, not just the horrible combination of TSE. ;)
---
True toxic right here
---
Especially to recharge all those cores. My stack of 100/100 grows as my numerous odd numberings reduce. 
---
You don’t post about an announcement and then announce this little when clearly expectations are already very high. If the face type workers don’t know that they shouldn’t be the face type workers as you call them. 
---
Eh
---
They could, but I have yet to have it happen to me since in the last hundred levels or so.
---
My lvl 15 friend started the event when a lvl 50 showed up a d said "You have no idea of the shit storm you are about to be in" lmaooo
---
Great post!  I am not a min/maxxer and just putting what I have noticed. 
---
I use a hardened receiver, piercing magazine combat shotgun on the ground instead of melee. I have no shotgun perks but grounded it does noticeable/chunk-able damage. 
---
On the landing - because people are saying it is broken — there has to be a place to land. No place to land you get the sonic spam. 
---
It tracks you - if you try to jig while it is in the ‘landing cycle’ it may not land ... seems distance you move determines this. 
---
A typical encounter uses less than a handful of stims. I am in a level 50 set of T-60 using NO Legendaries perked for rifles (Rifle Rank 3, Expert Rank 3, Master Rank 2 and Tank Killer Rank 3). My Airborne rifle damage is a lot less noticeable than shotgun on the ground. But a typical encounter is only a few minutes.
---
And 10lbs (power armor weight) to be ready for this encounter is in my opinion acceptable.
---
They are not insurmountable if you just stay cool and wait ... even through the sonic spam.  
---
That's a bummer. I just gave it a try and it worked for me. I play 76 on the PS4. I just downloaded the launcher and logged in with my same Bethesda.net account and it showed Fallout 2 as "Not Installed" then when I clicked the page for the game it showed an "Install" button and I was able to download it. It sounds like for whatever reason you may not have gotten the entitlements on your account. You should contact support.
---
So I figure many will think this is a dumb thing to be upset about but: I am fairly certain they patched out the ability to lock portable toilets in the past 24 hours. This was a fantastic way to resist workshop captures (put lvl 3 lock on toilet inside capture zone and lock self in if getting beat/lower level) and was also a cheeky little fun way to have a laugh if playing with friends. Stupid crap like that is what they wanna put their time into?
---
That’s way above Bethesda’s head. Unfortunately.
---
God bless the USA
---
Because that's easy to do while swarmed by 30+ max lvl gouls. "Hey guys all my armor is breaking and I'm using up most of my stimpacks, I just wanna make sure you all got a shot on the 2 legendaries lost in this sea of glowing ones. Anywhere else maybe.
---
It is a semi rare as in I have never seen in the wild. The clean spacesuit can be found on the Charleston vendor.
---
Whoever liked this video, I'm currently working on the Mothman's folklore. Just FYI keep your eyes peeled :D 
---
I always see people running as the answer...no, how about log out? Then relog into a different server and problem solved.
---
Hotkeying the hazmat suit would probably be a good idea if you don't play in PA.
---
you also conveniently ignored the line about realistic gun sounds and cloud retextures
---
if you want to explain how an HD texture or different sound (which is actually louder and lasts longer?) is cheating, I'm all ears my guy  
---
Not gonna force you to install anything, but I certainly don't get your viewpoint on this - not everything is an unfair advantage - and besides, is it unfair if you can install the mod, too?
---
I don't expect a patch every month.  I didn't say anything like that in my original post.  All I'd like to see is more details in the announcements they do provide.  
---
Yeah but  i have used other serums and got the mutation whilst using starched genes
---
add me Toxic_BOOBOO
---
Also mooch...unless I can sneak up on something with my instigating mole miner gauntlet, which is my only real shot at killing something in that zone.
---
&gt;, b
---
But they already tried to fix duping?
---
But duping was present in the BETA?
---
But every day this shit continues the game gets more and more ruined?
---
But almost no dupers are actually getting banned/they don't even have the tools to enforce rules/they don't care?
---
I will add you in a few. I’m at work as well
---
Sigh.  I know.  Just didn't know anything would be locked out.  Spent a long time looking for shielded underarmor mods before realizing many of them were locked until you got the preceeding version.  Trying not to shoot myself in the foot again.
---
You wanna stop hearing atom bomb baby? That’ll be *one mini nuke please*
---
lmfao when did I ever say that? I said I stopped putting turrets in my camp. I never had a camp in whitesprings. I had a lovely little house in the flatwoods dried lake area, but it would constantly get attacked by ghouls and mole rats. I'd go in for 3 minutes to do some crafting and it was almost guaranteed that I would get attacked. Never, not even once, did I get any xp for the turrets' kills or get to loot the enemies unless I joined in the fighting. Mole rats are guaranteed to drop meat, so if I could actually loot them I would have gotten it. I do appreciate you admitting it's a selfish thing to put them by the clubhouse though, while it doesn't fix much it's at least a step in the right direction
---
I highly doubt your game runs flawlessly around a mess of turrets there. But in the off chance it's actually true, congratulations, you're in that minority of players not experiencing issues. I'm genuinely happy you can have a proper experience and wish more people could have it too
---
They give like 450xp to me at 94. So yea, it is a great xp farming source, but it's mostly about getting legendaries. 
---
Check out the down voting! Jesus christ, I've never seen so much cognitive dissonance in my life.
---
I'd love to know where to get a level 40 T-60 helmet
---
That number was somewhat deceiving. They had one team (not fhe main BGS devs) who had good tech people modify the engine for online, then it went back to BGS for main development but at some point they brought in a third team to hell as well as take over post launch. Whether both or all three teams are still working on it due to issues I can’t say.
---
Lots of people worked on this thing, but never really all at once and a large number were just used for a specific specialty.
---
Doesn’t excuse the issues though, just that the number of people they touted was somewhat deceptive.
---
Oh you’re the same guy who got mad at people for playing with their mics on too. 
---
Not sure if you’re a troll or just miserable. 
---
Snooped your posts. Hope your laptop breaks. *Nobody gives a fuck what you’re paying for.* 
---
Well, its either that or a spooky ghost :P
---
If I had an Xbox I would build a relationship with some of the people in that community to do this with but sadly I don’t. Sounds like a terrible community lol
---
You just admitted you get a drop ALMOST 100% of the time, meaning there's times you haven't gotten a drop. You just happened to get the incredibly rare chance of all of you losing the lottery twice in a row.
---
 There haven't been any recent patches to change anything, it's not like they just secretly patched in a nerf to her drops just to fuck with people when no one was paying attention. 
---
Wish granted; Jukebox only accepts Prickett tokens, and will skip every second coin.
---
If the Alien game you're taking about was that multiplayer one, I think I saw a video where someone was glitching out of the map or something and watched the AI quickly locate them. Proving the AI knows where you are until it gets really close to you then it has to actively search. So yeah it's that, but like you said it's more aggressive and it's like they are screen watching and just pop up and shoot you.
---
Depends what you consider a "good price"
---
That's still not the point. Point is, dont announce you'll fix something that'll break your game in x time, so that everyone REALLY breaks your game.
---
Sylvie &amp; Sons Logging Camp. With Woodchucker and about 12 luck, I get about 400 wood per trip. 
---
From what I understand is 2 shot shotguns only add 1 more pellet to the spread. So it's not actually doubling the number of pellets. It's the explosive modifier that makes it so damn OP, I've got a quad explosive double barrel that I love to death because I found it legit but yeah it's pretty broken when I can kill a level 91 glowing deathclaw in 1 shot
---
I have the Mr. Fuzzy outfit and I plan to just sneak up on people and pop up out of nowhere and give them a bit of jumpscare. 
---
Like yesterday, I was in Flatwoods and I noticed a new player slowly making his way to Flatwoods making occasional stops so I hid up on the 2nd floor of the church and waited. When they finally walked in and grabbed the supplies from the Overseer's cache they opened their pip-boy so i jumped down and stood in front of them, almost immediately they put down their pip-boy and I might have startled him since they drew a melee weapon for a quick second. I then just gave him a salute and then ran off. I was laughing to myself about it shortly afterwards. All i can say is I hope I made their first moments with the game a bit "interesting".
---
Are you Michael Scott?   
---
All jokes aside, I feel you bro, I play solo. But I'm on xbox
---
Yeah I understand.  I'm 197 i think.  I had no STR to begin with and eventually migrated to 15 in STR.  It was a step up from not having any respec to begin with.  It's just different perspectives.  I'm also not an altaholic to begin with.  Only when forced.
---
Only recommendation I can throw out there is if you haven't, try 15 in STR.  I like rifles so i also have 15 in PER.  STR extremely versatile.  I can swap perks and do semi-auto rifles, 2h melee, unarmed melee, heavy weapons, shotguns.  I still don't have auto rifles, 1h melee.
---
Starched Genes at max level completely prevents new mutations. Starched Genes at the first level has a chance to prevent new mutations. If you got mutations with Starched Genes on before:
---
1) It was not maxed when you did it.
---
2) You got lucky.
---
I dont know of any stat differences because I dont use energy weapons but from what I can tell it's a different in the color of the laser
---
What I see when I look at it is a bit of lag from the hits to register, which might very well mean he's not hostile until he actually did kill me. The damage came after the hits themselves.
---
find one, there are static spawns of power armor chassis on the map that will have pieces of armor on it. if the armor isnt there you can quit and rejoin for a server that the armor hasnt been looted.
---
mehh it's all good. Was curious to try them out but it's NBD.
---
I could tell you where mine is but I don’t want neighbors lol. The top corners of the map are pretty barren do players since there isn’t much up that way in regards to events or locations. 
---
You can almost get up in there with jetpack 
---
Do you have any mutations that triggered damage on him allowing PvP to activate?
---
There is this site that updates the codes on a weekly basis on e they are solved  https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
I'm imagining a full gang in power armor jumping on to scorchbeasts like in dragons dogma and holding them down
---
I'm sorry I accidentally hit the wrong group name
---
yes, they do have a server sync  
---
however, ambient music in-game does not, so i don't know if the jukebox is synchronized or not
---
They are missing many items in the build menu (wind instruments for example). Many legendary effects don't work on specific armour pieces. Without an unofficial patch I don't think we will see much fixed. We've seen very minor patches so far even if they did fix some of the biggest issues. At this point, they are going to lose the player base if they don't shoehorn in an endgame. Everyone has several of these small glitches affecting them constantly but unless it is a glitch affecting every single player, with several Reddit threads made about it it won't be fixed. I think at this point we need to accept Bethesda is incompetent and move on.
---
ya thats why i dont want to be there. 
---
&gt;fix 
---
The time where that mattered passed by several weeks ago. Bethesda kicked this game out when it was unfinished and has now relished it to being on life support with sporadic updates and community managers that largely ignore any actual improvements or fixes.
---
Yeah they do sometimes get stuck up there.  No the ceiling is too low to get in there.  You can jump up and shoot though.  They even get stuck in the walls sometimes.
---
&gt; Check out the down voting!
---
this sub sucks major balls.  the fanbois are psychotically defending the shit they are eating.
---
If they're not gonna let us use it to paint armor then AT LEAST let me drink that sweet, sweet thickness to quench the thirst. 
---
Awareness is under perception, requires 2 points to equip
---
Notice how everything anyone does has a high risk of crashing the server? It's because the game trash.
---
Imagine something that tracks all of these!  We'll call it a "collection tab".  Beth can feel free to steal my idea.  On that tab you could list plans and recipes.  Then filter and sort on categories.. search by name, etc... Totally brand new idea never thought of before now.  Then put a little icon symbolizing that we don't yet know a plan/recipe and it can be collected!  Brilliant!
---
So it should work with scratched genes. Have you tried relogging? Sometimes the status page doesn't update within the same session. Especially if you took multiple in a row/got other mutations earlier in the same session. 
---
Yes, I know, but I didn't know the english translation :D
---
That's what I'm thinking... 
---
I know a lot of place to get wood by picking it up - toxic valley is great for it - but I'm really looking for a resource map so I can build a wood extractor.  I'm also hoping that there is one close by another resource node so I can double up.
---
"Shit im gomna have to make two trips"
---
Now you're trying to offend falloutmaps.com? I did your homework for you and you dubbed someone else's work was lackluster and poor quality? A work that's lightyears beyond what you initially provided as some sort of actual guide that contained regurgitated information that you probably inadvertently sourced from... me?
---
Keep trying, little one. You'll get there.
---
For a meager 350xp
---
The Brahmins in Brahmin pens drop meat?
---
Like "only breaks a little bit"?
---
While you're at Harper's Ferry you might want a handmade rifle plan (which is an AK-47) from the vendor, if you're into those, because they disappear at higher levels.
---
Next week's patch might fix that though. They mentioned changing some of the vendor plans, but didn't say exactly how.
---
all 4 of my teammates also had the same problem. 0 legendary loot. Yeah I’m calling bullshit on that any day of the week. 
---
Also the times I’m referring to not getting a drop I talking about getting syringers and drills. Which are not legendary. In fact I believe they are labaled as “exotic weapons”. The last two kills had neither a drill or a syringer or any legendary loot. If it was just me I wouldn’t have posted anything. BUT since it happened to FOUR OTHER PEOPLE I made a post. 
---
Have you ever killed the queen?
---
From other players who can make them based off recipes that drop from queen, or in science lab in whitesprings bunker. 
---
Not being constructive I guess you did not read my solution other people have. And I take it you are a loyal fan boy or girl who buys any thing with fallout or elder Scrolls on it even if it's a turd.
---
I can confirm that is true with doubling the damage, I found a 2 shot  combat shotgun but it made the guns accuracy 5, so the spread was almost the size of my screen. It was ridiculous, I had to be touching something with the gun to do damage because the spread was so bad. And no, mods didnt really help it
---
No we don't but its kind of obvious.
---
If there is a pool of legendary affixes and one systematically over shadows all the rest, and hilariously so, then that affix is going to get changed.
---
Buffing everything to 1 shots is just as ridiculous imo.
---
Don’t defend what you actually like, just say “it has tons of faults but I like it anyway”.
---
The only thing that needs something akin to defending are flatout lies, like I talked to a guy who thought there was a season pass for this thing.
---
it might just be my build but i killed my first scorchbeast at 35 and without power armor i took almost zero damage and was able to wait for it to land and killed it in 1 ground phase with my death tambo. it was lvl 50 and seemed way too easy. 
---
Thank the gods, I’ve been searching everywhere for the barbed cane mod.
---
If it hasnt been fixed now, it wont be fixed. This is Bethesda after all.
---
To each their own but Watoga seems to be better for those in my experience. *shrug*
---
Nope! Well I'm glad to know I'm not the only person doing this lol
---
Ohhhhhh gotcha thanks mate
---
why not put scope on it if you are sniping with it.
---
That's half the fun
---
Why don't you just admit to duping and that you are afraid you will be banned?  It's pretty obvious that's your motive here.
---
If duping and glitching wasn't an issue for MP games, why would there even be tiers of items in the first place?
---
You're going on a sideways rant that has nothing to do with what we were originally talking about.
---
I have defended this game and Bethesda up to this point.  With this lackluster “Inside the Vault,” I can no longer do so.
---
This isn’t transparency.  This is corporate vaguery, and frankly, I’m fucking done with it.  We haven’t gotten a real roadmap in quite some time, likely because they don’t know where they can take the game whether due to funding issues or the limitations of their decades-old engine.  Even a “hey guys, so this is what we’re working on,” with explanations and descriptions, and a caveat that things may change depending on what they can conceivably do.  Instead, this was an announcement about an announcement about next week, and I just can’t take it anymore.
---
This is my tactic too. I have a 3* lvl 50 limb crippling combat shotgun, add 3* enforcer. Go for the face first, then legs, then arms. Move away and wait for self destruct. Great for level 50 Watoga Protectrons too. Remove arms and wait for the bang. 
---
Honestly I think making the fast travel cost caps, and then making caps uncommon, was the worst thing they could have done. 
---
Yes, thank you for adding to it! I keep the 10mm SMG, since I haven't had the time to hunt down the others and the 10mm SMG is the only one of my guns I can't slap a suppressor on for my build. So I figured I'd let it carve it's own niche by making it my anti-scorched weapon.
---
 Everybody has a testing environment. Some people are lucky enough enough to have a totally separate environment to run production in. 
---
I got one a long time ago from SCQ. I’ve heard of people getting the plan from Line in The Sand as well. The rewards are random for events so honestly just grind every high-tier event and hopefully get lucky.
---
i did it around that level, and was overwhelmed, but i completed it.
---
like they said above, bring stims and good weapons (I use hunters super sledge and auto Tesla for the silos).
---
you dont have to kill all the robots...just the ones causing damage...which most do..lol.
---
Also, check the map for some high level players (100+) so you'll get help with the SBC...you'll need it.
---
bring a mini/Gatling for the Nuke zone to even dent that bird.
---
have plenty of rad drugs too....if you dont have auto stimpaks perk, then keep an eye on your health.
---
finally drop all your junk into storage before going in...nothing worse that not being able to get that lunch bag cuz it fell into a fissure. uggh
---
not sure if it is sarcasim or not, but I do not think I have ever seen anything but whitesprings nuked. maybe once in the bottom right of the map. 
---
People actually do this???
---
If you need help, you don't have time to pull out this useless gun.
---
I say a Perk that shoots a flare out of our head straight up when we hit 20% health
---
Have you farmed mutations and died to rads?
---
You can obtain dud mutations doing that. They don't show on your effects screen and do nothing but you can't obtain that mutation till you clear it.
---
Theoretically if you had bird bones but it was a dud then the serum won't work
---
Lol! Well done. This is awesome/accurate
---
&gt;**Players:** Bethesda needs to be more communicative!    
---
&gt;**Bethesda:**  Okay, we're gonna do that.  We're starting a blog.    
---
&gt;**Players:** Bethesda needs to fix bugs before they think about new content!  
---
&gt;**Bethesda:**  Okay, we're gonna do that.  *\*posts blog update about upcoming bugfixes\**  
---
&gt;**Players:** OMG no new content this month?  What a letdown.  I can't play because of all the bugs anyways.
---
And so on.
---
Assuming you dont know how PA works you probably only have a frame. You need to get higher level to wear certain PA. Once youre level 25 look for excavator posters or you can go south to the dark part of the map youll see three large towers. One of them leads to excavator power armor plans. Id suggest starting with a set of this armor
---
Oh noes. I didn't know that. I just spent all my caps on eagle eye. 
---
The budget definitely feels too low. My CAMP only has a few more frills beyond just the functional stuff and I'm already at the limit.  I thought about trying to find the Neon letter plans, but I watched a video of someone adding those to his CAMP and he had to destroy a TON of stuff because they letters take up so much budget! F that.
---
Duping with artillery was fixed some time ago afaik. If they were killing people at the golf club then set up artillery that seems more likely to be because they were taking out the idiots with turrets at the back door. 
---
The guy that hits you is flagged for pvp presumably because he hits you and you have Electrically Charged or Unstable Isotope Mutations, so after his first hit he can do full damage to you.
---
It's irritating for all legit players that so much cheating is going unchecked in the game, but that doesn't mean you should immediately assume everyone is cheating.
---
There are tons of things like this that have been a problem since FO3 but now that you can’t pause it is even more annoying (for me). I want more sub categories. For example the Aid tab really needs to separate hydration items, food items, and stim/drugs imo
---
Im a sniper. O would like some skins for handmade, combat rifle- and hunting rifle
---
You can nuke anywhere on the map except a protected zone around the vault.
---
sure, ill throw an orbital strike down, but i have pacifist mode on so it wont do much but confuse them
---
which i i find fun
---
Hopefully she quit.
---
I got mine off the watoga vendor, but only had enough for the helmet :(
---
The brick wall building set?
---
I am a CAMP builder. I learn camp plans and build them for free on peoples camps (literally give me the materials it costs me to make and I will build you everything you want from the build menu.) I miss some of the for things, and feel that there are some decorations or clean walls that we are definitely lacking
---
Nope, this is a terrible solution. I'd be calling it quits. 
---
They said they can't do anything about duped items that are there already. Wow reading comprehension is missing today. 
---
Yes, UO had a trade window way back when. Very simple and also my favorite game of all time. Nostalgia...
---
lvl109 and this only happened to me a handful of times. Are there conditions that enable this to occur more frequently? 
---
Then you need to read the holotapes and lore better because PR copy+paste drivel is very easily analyzed in terms of promise/expectation/delivery.
---
I've heard there are mods on Nexus that can help you better store and sort the lore holotapes but Bethesda might ban you for using them (or will they? because they can't even communicate that properly)
---
Not the red bricks, but the off white featureless cement look.
---
Well it's only level 40 and unmodded
---
This is correct - all Mistress items need the original item to craft. You are basically just upgrading their lvl, not making a new one entirely.
---
If you used FT to get out you can FT to Vault 76 for free. These days you could just leave the server and try another until your camp can be placed. 
---
Looks like that unstable isotope mutation.
---
The problem is some issues have been known for years (lever action reload) and Bethesda never fixed them in previous games or engine updates.
---
2 months on a full priced online game is a unacceptable to fix even basics like weapon degradation or welcome mats. With the amount of feedback this forum alone has given, even from the beta, there is no excuse for the state this game is in.
---
To expand on the hacking terminals for people who don’t know: even in hard ones I see very few possible passwords, and get a lot of the fakes(closed brackets) which remove duds. I usually run out of possible passwords before fakes, leaving only the real one. The more Int you have, the fewer bad passwords and the more closed brackets you see.
---
I do check every day, usually more than once, but I've never seen anything better than the typical 1\* garbage at the vendor.  After an SBQ run, there is usually a paper bag or two on the floor of the Watoga train station, containing better gear than is on the vendor.  I have a partial, mixed set of 1-star level 40/45 weightless armors from this kindness.  TBH, I do better in my prototype Hazmat Suit most of the time.
---
I've found some fun weapons for sale (or in a bag) at the WS crafting area, but never anything useful for a rifle build.
---
Here comes the typical fallback “oh fanboy hurhur” comments. *sigh*
---
In actual fact, all you done is say “fix the game” that’s NOT constructive, at all. It’s a generalised statement, where are the specific ideas and solutions?
---
I mean, you even attempted to say yoi blocked them. Lol i know for 100% you didn’t, i’ve blocked my friend once and he generally disappeared. “We server hopped an found the same one over three times” how awfully convenient, you must be the only person capable of randomly joining the same server when there’s hundreds available? And MAYBE just MAYBE that’s why you “blocking” didn’t work, since y’know changing world removes the block?
---
Like i said, stupidity crying out.
---
I drop plans and recipes in the Overseers stash both at her camp and at Flatwoods, and sometimes at Morgantown Airport as well. Extra stimpaks and healing salves sometimes get tossed into the first aid box in front of the  church. I also leave batches of ammo and other stuff in the mailboxes around Flatwoods so there is a little more of an Easter egg hunt for folks.  
---
cool info, but they are really misleading :)
---
I can take down a lv80 in under a minutt, but a few days back me and 1 more player tried to take down the queen (no others showed up) we didn't stand a chance, di make a few dents in here, but she just laught at us, lol
---
So the difference in 100/100 in not true at all... just another bug i guess, lol
---
5 charisma and no hard bargin gets you 30 caps for one. (just throwing the maths out there for anyone else that wants it)
---
No, if you were played 76 at all you get it.
---
If you’re a console player you must play the classics on PC, just install the Bethesda Launcher and login with the same info used for 76. Read the link again if you need help.
---
Ahh, well done then, it looks good!
---
Came here to say the same. They very vaguely mentioned expanding beyond 600 with the first bump, but since then have said nothing. End game is starting to feel pointless with no reason to even save the few pieces of rare gear I find. 
---
Rate of fire, less then ideal legendary effects
---
Yeah I haven't tried yet.  I don't do pvp other than killing wanted players once in a while lol.  I'm interested to have you hit me with that build though lol.  You on PC? 
---
Daaaaaamn even better. I like the way you think. 
---
Just means it activated or triggered the perk
---
The rarest one is the Hunter's Long Coat
---
Heart of the swamp method definitely worked for me. That's why I wondered if there was a non server jumping method. If you figure it out please update.
---
Feel bad for the devs, not for the company. Devs got no say in when to release their product, yet get full burden on fixing it while we tear 'em a new one.
---
Whoa. Thank you for this
---
Actually u can jump up there. U just can't move alot... mursipual mutation needed
---
COUNTEROFFER/ 1200 caps and 1 color.
---
I did. I said "Yes". It was the first sentence of my comment. 
---
Oh shit my camp is 5 feet away from the monorail one...
---
K can craft t45 so yeah it exists.
---
Then send a help ticket. It should be free.
---
True, but monochromatic shouldn't be that hard.  They can make one singular set of "painted" skins, and then just copy/pasta it 10 times changing the hue of the paint layer.  Toss it in the atom store for $2 a color.
---
&gt; absolutely no counter
---
You're right! There's literally no other way this could have been done! That's why every game that has combat in is has bats that shit endless fruitloops out their ass while flying away from you and giant green farts that go through solid objects and you know what, you're not worth any more of my time.
---
For me, I think BGS has permanently tarnished their reputation with this title.  The chance I would ever pre-order from BGS in future is zero, and the chance I'd buy any game from them in future is very low.  
---
Major, major error. 
---
My original plan was to use pistols. Either ballistic or laser. They sucked badly. I struggled to do anything solo.
---
I switched to Shotguns, and it feels like god mode in comparison. 
---
No, exploits have not affected my gameplay. 
---
First, I have not been to Whitesprings nukes because running around grinding flux does not appeal to me, nor do I think it's a significant part of the game's appeal. But if I did, I wouldn't care what kind of badass weapons others have, their gear is not my business. And if you're going to argue that they kill things faster and outpace your own grind as a result, I would suggest this alternative situation: Bethesda produces a form of endgame that ISN'T a fairly boring flux grind. xD
---
As far as people buying duped recipes on reddit, I don't get your complaint. It's easy to avoid: Don't buy duped shit on reddit. I mean in every single MP game I've played there are people grinding stuff out or duping it and selling the results at inappropriate prices... WoW has had gold sellers since FOREVER. It's quite easy to just not interact with those shady sites and not buy things that are clearly duped.
---
Now having stated my opinions on those points, and clarified that no, exploits have in no way (not one way) affected me, let me also reiterate that I do want to see exploits fixed. I stated that. What I don't want is for polish and exploits fixes to take precedence over making this a more enjoyable game that will last. If they spend the next 2-3 months fixing things that should have been fixed at launch, I think this game will rapidly become boring for current players and its population will fall off. 
---
And what will be the likely result of that? IMO, if Bethesda sees falling player numbers, they will put minimal effort into making this a great game. They won't produce new content, they won't expand on features, and they might just stop caring about private servers and mods. So I'm advocating making the basic framework of this game more of an actual game and less of a framework while they continue to iron out bugs and cheaters, as opposed to putting the whole focus on bugs and cheaters (which most current players are tolerating) and having a skeleton of a game come spring, when most players will have exhausted the exploration aspect of 76-- which to me is the main thing currently keeping the game afloat.
---
Well even by charging Atoms, which are earned in-game, it would make sense. As it sits now, the Atom Store is a barren wasteland. Candy canes and black pip boys, and a smattering of dumb costumes and emotes.
---
I'd be all for color/paint options. Dyes for clothing etc. Cmon, the engine can do it, we've seen it all before.
---
Then the flash flood comes and your home is wiped out and you're now being carried down the river which was once a small calm stream yelling and fighting to hold onto your bed that is miraculously floating down the white water rapids of poor future proof planning!
---
Just need to mention, why wait for patch notes if they aren't going to be listed?
---
a lot of the time, im trolling for stuff to make myself "nuke capable" for when one randomly drops.
---
The rest of the time, im cool with roaming.

Whether or not they post the patch notes now or on Monday, the feedback is going to be the same. I think the reaction to this "Inside The Vault" stems from the community being desperate for details on what is changing. The loyal player base that is logging in and playing each week has been vocal on several issues that greatly affect their QOL in game. We haven't had any communication beyond, changes are coming for over a month now. So I think it is totally understandable that people are frustrated by this post.
---
Right. I guess I'll keep trying. I've pretty much just been doing any event (minus Monster Mash) that appears in Cranberry Bog for a week now....
---
Starched Genes lvl 2 
---
So at a lower level  what I used to do was tag the ghouls in the golf club and then high tailed it to my base where my turrets killed them. That way I got the XP, loot and avoided using my ammo. 
---
I mean, I'm happy to wait for that if they're currently working on fixing the economy first. Players vendors are a little useless with the current state of duping.
---
Cliffs by site Alpha
---
On pc? I have an extra brick building plan
---
My boyfriend likes to complain that he only sees nuke zones when he plays with me so that's all we do sometimes 
---
Wow you sure jumped on the subtle "you're just some noob that doesn't even kill the queen so what do you know" at the end there. Not even worth continuing this then. 
---
I've never seen an actual watoga nuke yet. If it's right there, it's always a Fissure prime. I have seen Harper's Ferry, Grafton, Pleasant Valley but never a Watoga nuke. Does the nuke ratchet up the bots level's and increase legendaries?
---
Only time this has happened to me I accidently scraped it, the game catagorizes it as junk
---
what about going no garb but incisor perk ?
---
2......40? Props.
---
yea, I usually hotkey it for blastzones, but then switch it out for water outside of a blastzone
---
hmm... not sure if that exists as a "drop" you would need the plans, if not you can't make the ammo for it..
---
so, you will need the gatling laser, and then wait for a "drop" of the primary receiver for it, the prime receiver is that same plan that learns you how to make the amo... 
---
Got one yesterday from the frame by the crashed copter in watoga
---
So by blocking a player, it keeps you off the same server together...
---
This makes sense in theory, but in reality where servers are spread out across multiple locations with varying ping...
---
If you're ps4, I will build conduits for you for free. No one deserves wires in the way of their design
---
Respectable 
---
It's very useful when crafting power armor, and it increases the base DR over a standard dropped set in my experience. I know what I've crafted at int 21+ had more ballistic resistance than wiki was reporting
---
I’ve seen someone have the owl one 
---
At this point energy weapons are not worth using, at least heavily. Ultracite weapons are basically collectors stuff atm.
---
Oh, that's great to know!
---
Please link me where a Bethesda spokesperson said that or where they mentioned it in a press release?
---
Oh wait, are you relying on rumors because Bethesda and Zenimax don't know how to deal with communication?
---
I spent a few hours in Morgantown just exploring the area and rooftops. Found a bunch of little spots with chairs and beer bottles. Made up little stories in my head about who put them there...all while doing a junk run.
---
add: Bell-Angel
---
She is my girlfriend, and is also looking for some cool Fallout76 friends.  
---
I run on PS4 too: Yolvi  
---
In case you want to add me too.  
---
The true reclamation day!
---
No. You turned that into a new argument I was never talking about, never addressed, and never cared to address. Your post and title complain about there not being information about exploit patches. I gave a reason why not. 
---
You went on a communication tirade. I know there's no communication, I play the game too.
---
I figured that the servers refresh vendor caps once a day, for me it's sometime around 11am. The vendors at train stations of the same factions share caps (this sucks), then there are other vendors. There's Phoenix, the enclave vendors, the vendor in Harper's ferry, Graham...and a few others. 
---
With proper timing, you should be able to pull over 1k caps a day from vendors without too much trouble. Assuming you have the stuff to sell. 
---
You're not looking forward to having more perks work as intended? If it's low hanging fruit they should absolutely be fixing that stuff.
---
And this!
---
Just NE of you, where that junk pile is.  It's a farm so tons of veggies all over.  It's like level 1 ghouls and stuff that spawns there.  Decent spot.  You can build a machine on the junk pile to harvest junk from it.
---
My Anti-Virus reported a false-positive of FO76.exe because it was 'collecting system data' and 'heavy CPU usage'.
---
I had to white-list it of course.
---
im going on assumtions here, but if they specifically mention duping, or if they mentioned how they planned to patch it.l the people cheating and the youtubers promoting it will probably start on workaround/other methods. asap.  if they dont specifically mention why/how they may be able to catch them off gaurd.
---
theres also the fun part where if they promise a fix, then it gets worked around by the dupers or it doesnt fully fix it. people will cry/riot about it like last time they tries (and failed) to fully patch it
---
Quick stupid question but have you since discovering this glitch, moved you camp and rebuilt from scratch?
---
I normally feel that way about sp games, but the whole mp experience was such a great thing in the beginning. The game has changed dramatically in feel since the beta. There was definitely a benefit to being one of the first out of the vault. 
---
I was getting 25 caps @ 5 charisma with no perks.
---
With a 3-rank Hard Bargain perk and 5 charisma, I'm getting 43 caps per straight jacket.
---
The worst part is that anything in here will not be part of the patch on the 15th and we're still stuck with this shit for another month at least.
---
They tried to fix it and failed - all it did was make the dupers take an extra step to do it. Currently it is still not fixed.
---
Oooo nice! I'll mess around with that! Thanks for the tip!
---
Any of these would be cool. 
---
I'd rather a way to fix, discard or trade in duplicate cards.  Like I need three copies of Green Thumb.... thanks Bethesda.
---
Last time I played was logging in to check for the x-01 jetpack.  Signed on, didn't see it and thought... "Fine ...  I guess I'll go do something.  30 minutes later and I crashed to desktop."
---
That was last week.  Why should I bother logging on when there is barely a chance I get the item I am trying to get, and there isn't anything else I can really do to speed it up?  It'd be one thing if I could keep killing SBQ for that 1% drop rate, but I can't do that.
---
Why the fuck would anyone design an online only game that requires end game gear to be acquired by logging out of a server as a process?
---
THAT IS DUMB.  LIKE, RECENT GRADUATE OF HIGH SCHOOL DUMB.
---
Who ever decided that system was good for an online only game needs to be fired.  I'm not being hyperbolic.  They literally do not understand the fundamentals of an online experience for rpg elements.
---
I can't believe I have to keep logging into servers, not to farm anything, but just to open a shop UI element and log off again.  Thanks for giving me a chance to play a game that at least attempts to think I may want to play a fucking game when I actually log into a game.
---
I will captain my camp down the river with the poise and grace of a southern gentleman should the need, and waters, arise.
---
those are just damage resistances, we cant see the health, so my x hundred damage are always going to deal y damage after resistances...health can be anything after that, its static for normal scorched beasts but scales for the ones in events. at least thats what another post explained to me when it said that low level players showing up to events make it harder on everyone in it. 
---
This is super disappointing 
---
Nevertheless it is because you had sg equipped.
---
On PC, but thanks for the offer. :)
---
yes but that was on PC only and assumed some trickery is involved
---
[Someone posted about it a few days ago!](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/acwaup/almost_level_200_and_i_though_id_seen_all_there/) Good spot OP! I'm excited for these
---
Oops. Should have mentioned that at the top. I'm on PS4. At least I know the correct name now. 
---
Thanks, it would also added some needed variety for nuke sites, something I think we all want!
---
How often an ability "Proc"esses
---
the queen drops most of this prime receivers and capacitores, have gotten a few from normal SB's as well..
---
I'm a little concerned that they are giving away freebies in this post, not that I'm not happy to get free stuff, but I feel like they could be trying to grease us up before we are disappointed with the new patch notes.
---
Nah I'm not looking for explosive I can't use my shredder to do extra dmg when they're in my face if it's explosive
---
well that location completed the challenge for me, so it should work for anyone else. It being correct doesn't really matter as long as it works ;-)
---
Their RibEye Steaks are a good source of HP/+Carry Weight, so they usually get ganked pretty quickly.

/thathappened
---
Sir you are a scholar and a gentleman.  please take this upvote
---
Guess I'll stick to the GOG editions...
---
Just to clarify: do you have electrically charged, unstable isotope or any effect that reflects damage?
---
I mean 200 hours into alot of games you won't find anything else to do. 
---
You don't have to tell people you're going to cook dinner while also telling them the recipe.
---
The point is duping, one of the largest issues facing FO76 right now, is mentioned at the end of a 3rd/4th paragraph and appears as nothing more than an afterthought from Bethesda.
---
Why can't they say "we realize duping is a big issue and we're combatting this starting today by issuing 7 day bans to accounts found to be using server exploits"?
---
There's no good reason to ignore the issue unless they have no idea how to fix it.
---
I'd really like to see your dumb asses stop shilling a shit game. Kys faggotass
---
Thanks for posting. I will throw out another secret to all the Two Shot Explosive users to this encounter especially with the shotgun. People who use TSE weapons need to be in the know that the SBQ is highly resistant to explosive damage. People who run TSE usually expect it to kill everything in one or two shots. She is a bit different. Armor piercing or armor penetration is amazing on her. If you add explosive the sizable chunk you are talking about goes away. The same with .50 cal heavy guns, combat rifles, snipers, ect. Explosive just isnt good on her. Scorch killer weapons are amazing with her. 
---
A lot of people don't even invest in the Ultracite recievers because they don't want to farm the blast zones for the flux and extra materials to Craft their ammo. Try out the Ultracite shotgun with similar mods. I guarantee you I have used it and you will see an even greater amount of damage! The Scorch killer shotgun is also on par with that damage at a cheaper cost, but again, the down side is another weapon with more weight. 
---
It in the end is how we all play with our playstyles and how we can put our builds to good use in a combination of series of events. 
---
Thanks for posting!
---
i know that spot. i tend to go there for the free power armor. but id rather not have to fight ghouls when i spawn in. thats kinda why im moving. yesterday a group of 15 super mutants came and started shooting at me. they were all like level 15. kinda sucked. also the farms got no ponds which is a major thing for me. but thanks for the suggestion. 
---
YEEYEE!
---
Confirmed. I got mine there as well, just yesterday. 
---
I concur. What’s the death claws name?
---
Yeah the storage is separate, but your alt character wouldn't even need it aside from junk that would drop in the event they died.  I put my stable flux's in my alt's STASH.  If you have someone you trust to hold stuff for you, give it to them, swap characters, and have them give it back.  You can just dump it all in their inventory... just don't expect to do much traveling once they're overweight.
---
Yeah, I was thinking of the same game. Just forgot it wasnt a multiplayer. Here is the video I saw 
---
https://youtu.be/Nt1XmiDwxhY
---
I get what you mean. If there were several players all stealthing the AI couldnt focus on one player specifically and use a system like Alien: Iso did, so it has to be less sophisticated but still make it where stealth isnt an over power concept for the player like in Skyrim where you can be so stealthy that you can stay hidden in direct light and line of sight. It just feels too obvious in 76, they know where I am and they are closing in. 
---
This sounds fun! I’m sadly on PS4, but wanted to suggest posting this on r/FO76roleplay too! :)
---
Still not as detailed as I would like it to be, but it's a start. Thanks
---
I got the ‘faschnacht man mask’  at a train yard in a room full of safes. It was in a safe that was crack slightly open so you could barely see it.
---
ah yes you might be right about that, i just remembered the name wasn't matching up but couldnt remember exactly what it was :P
---
I run the game on PC without the launcher. I just shortcut straight to the game executable. 
---
I only open the launcher on patch day.
---
I constantly do this on my PS4. I will go to the Overseer's camp or Flatwoods and unload goodies in mailboxes, crates, overseer's cache, ect. I will also drop stuff in front of players, some run away others take it. I have dropped Power Armor chassis, fusion cores, weapons, ammo, aid.  I have even come back (an hour later) to drop more (in the same server) and notice nothing was taken so sometimes I grab certain items and put them somewhere else or find players. I also like to drop things into the government supply crate/cache
---
It'll take a little more than 22, sadly  
---
Took me about a week or two of constant queens to learn all the ultracite plans. I'm just missing armor mods now.  
---
Let’s assume the chances of NOT getting a legendary from the queen is 5% (being generous here because it’s probably more like 1%). 
---
So for just me that would be .05x.05=.0025. 
---
And that also happened to 4 other people. 
---
The legendary enemy not dropping legendary loot glitch is because the game wrongly labeled them as legendary instead of it being normal. You can check this if you hit them and they don’t regen HP.
---
yep would be cool if there was a card trading system that you could either trade with other players or trade in for a chance at a unique cosmetic
---
Ah the old "I'll just delete my previous comment so people don't see how much of a dick I am" trick. You may have saved yourself a few downvotes, but still look like a whiny brat.
---
It also puts pressure on the developers to rush a promised fix for something which ends up breaking the game more out of fear of being chastised by the community for not following through on the "inside the vault" postings. Eg: The fix for the excavator armour weight bug that ended up breaking normal armour weight bonuses.
---
Personally, I'd rather they kept the patch notes secret until the update hits, it's less pressure to rush things and less of a chance to break something else as a result.
---
So, if you recognize having higher resolution textures as cheating, my next question is: does that mean running the game on ultra, versus minimum, is cheating?
---
What exactly did you want them to say? They explained which areas the patch is focusing on and gave a solid date for the drop. We'll receive full patch notes when the patch drops, similar to a lot of other games. 
---
Quest: Find parts and power to fix crashed space station to discover what happened :)
---
I have Unstable Isotope, which registered on the third hit, as you can see. If that flagged me on his first hit, that's incredibly buggy. Also never experienced that happening before, and I've had my fair share of PvP.
---
Well I havent been able to stop playing since release. Its the best fallout game ive ever played
---
Anything to help out the my fellow wastelanders!
---
Check the other comments. A lot of useful information is in here as well as some of my personal tips and tricks more so to their playing style. I've ran about 6 different builds to 80 while trying to find my favorite playing style.
---
Hey listen, I was able to find T60 arms, both Level 40 and 50, but some problems came up. I won’t be able to get back on until 3:30-4:00 EST. Because of this I just decided to give the arms to you for free when I get on, since I don’t spend much caps on anything except fast travel nowadays.
---
 I'm fine with the content coming and pace at which they are addressing bugs, but these 'weekly updates' and Bethesda pr in general needs to be way more detailed and regular. If they were updating us every day being a little less specific is fine, we get it, you update us everyday! But, when its once a week, with all the issues raised by the loyal community, an 'update' like this feels as if we dumped out our innermost feelings to a lover and they pause for 5 seconds then say "ok."
---
Seriously, they could hire any one of us reddit fanboys to sit around and field comments all day, instead they respond with silence and vague promises that they are working on it.
---
(Huge fan of the game. Just want Bethesda to realize they can turn this ship around if they work with us and not just for us!)
---
If you don't want caps then why did you post this thread? 
---
The Ultracite Gatling Laser and Gatling Laser are separate items.
---
I have the Prime Receiver for the Ultracite Gatling Laser and Gatling Laser, but no Ultracite Gatling Laser plan.
---
They need to fix stability with teams and invisible team mates. My friend and I are hardly ever able to join each other without having to force close the game and join from main menu. Even then often times after fast traveling or loading into an instance one of us completely goes invisible to the other to the point where we can't trade or even see the name plate to tell where the other is.
---
Many times one of us will be in game and the other will join. But when we send an invite to team the other either doesn't receive it or it won't allow them to accept it so back to the menu we go. This is frustrating when one of us has just captured a factory or needs help with a certain enemy. These issues have been ongoing since launch for everyone I know that plays with friends 
---
Yeah water is nice..  i've never seen a level 15 anything by that junk pile though.  It could be like 5 level 1's but thats about it.  Me and my buddy are both in our 100's so we would've caused higher level spawns there if it were possible.
---
When my buddy was set up there, he'd just fast travel for water.  I do prefer having water next to my base though.
---
You can often buy the receivers from vendors. I see UGL ones commonly at Watoga and the BOS vendor bots.
---
the game is to easy and boring, they tell me as they brag about having 125k weight in duped ammo
---
You talking about the pip-boy or the craftable radio for bases?
---
Wait what are those tokens for i have like 20 of them i was gonna just toss
---
its happened to me many times...create a party in PS4 with those people. oyu can then hear each other even  if you get booted.  in game, find one of them and fast travel. for looting, make sure youre all on a team to tag and share loot.
---
I know one thing, when we do get mods I'm changing the scorchbeast sound to Rick James after reading your post.
---
&gt;en
---
Yeah, keep in mind FO1/2/tactics can be had for very few dollars.
---
Bethesda is taking no financial hit at all by offering these games, they're not even on console. This is simply an effort to try and distract people with something pretty (I already have those games, maybe they're still well recieved by other people though)
---
I do appreciate when a company takes efforts to apologize to their customers (like when Valve accidentally banned a large number of players years ago and gave a free copy of L4D2) but the difference is not about the cost of the gift but more about how the company talks to the customer.
---
I as well as any other person who purchased FO76 is a human. There's no effort from Bethesda to communicate to me in honest terms. All I've seen and continue to see is boilerplate PR copy.
---
ya water next to your base is efficient and looks nice and really into building nice bases. 
---
Eh I just make fake posts on LA for the easy new account karma to get around posting rules on other subs. Faggle baggle
---
It looks like calibrated shocks are only sold at the vendors at Watoga Shopping Center and Watoga Station
---
https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Calibrated+Shocks
---
I don't know why you would spend so much time server hopping at a specific vendor before checking online to even see if that vendor sold it.
---
Patch update is out https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/3wohkyIGcEOE8gayy6yCMg/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-9-2019
---
I just miss that there is no Biscuit World. There really should be one in one of the red rockets.
---
I did that one by myself recently.. went over there cause I saw someone else was in the area. But no, they just stayed out of the way while I did it all myself. x____x Never again.
---
No, I never hit him. I killed his friend about 10-15 minutes prior to this when he was off elsewhere (or maybe had logged out if they were indeed duping as I showed up). In any case, he wasn't anywhere nearby until he showed up a few minutes after me killing his wanted pal. When he did show up, they both ran up and killed some lowbies - a level 37 and 23. Never saw them attack them either.
---
I don't think the game is hollow at all, but I do think that the fun of exploration (and the world is quite large and fun to explore) is going to drop off before too long. By the end of January it will be three months of exploring, and even playing pretty casually (averaging about 10-15 hours a week) I will have explored most of the game's map by then. Particularly because the game isn't super hard and some POIs don't even have defenders. 
---
The few places that will remain unexplored I'll be saving for another character when private servers come out, so I still have the sense that I haven't seen everything. 
---
A far as 'epic' camp building... yeaaaa... about that camp budget... I've seen some cool places to be sure, but it's not possible to go 'epic' when you're dealing with such a restrictive limit and a paltry selection of decor that doesn't even match what FO4 had at launch. :P 
---
Yep. My discord is CHEEKIBANDIT#6720.
---
Might I suggest a Razer Naga or similar equivalent. Been using them since 2009 and can't game without one. 
---
X: Doubt 
---
Oh man, this would look dope with Barn walls.
---
Have they ever even publicly acknowledged the dupe?
---
If you haven't played since December then how do you know that they haven't added anything?
---
Dude, that wall sets in 50-100 for most games.
---
Strange in numbers buffs positive effects of mutations by 25% when in a team, and class freak maxed out reduces negative effects by 75%. Intelligence goes from -4 to -1. Carry weight is increased by 20% and I'm not in a group. Marsupial is worth it  
---
Do you come from a land gone under?
---
Generally, people on this sub are not whiney bitches with victim mentality. Finding a way to stop dupers without damaging the integrity of the game might be a complicated task. Do I think they are trying to fix the issue, yes.  Am I going to cry about it every day and try to villainize and push a social justice agenda, no. Duping is a choice made by individuals.  Hopefully they are dealt with accordingly, but in the meantime I'm going to enjoy the game (no matter how much your train wants to prevent that).
---
Yeah the accuracy is terrible with 2 shot  
---
Right?  How long were we waiting for this update since the last one?  Very underwhelming. 
---
Yep, I tried one's and it's useless
---
If you are on Facebook you might want to check out some of the FO 76 groups there. I'm a member of a Ladies of the Vault group that's girls only and they are all pretty awesome!

There is a holotape that only shows up during nukes it's her last one I think
---
All Rise with incisor and all the slugger perks, one hits everything except bosses.
---
What flavor of pizza do you want
---
Yeah it's a nice place plus no worries of high level spawns
---
OMG YES. Had a CAMP by the nuka cola plant and would always get spawned in the river (guess how fun that is in power armor)
---
Feels like the last week and a half its been getting worse. Also seen a lot of new glitches I didn't before. Can a game code erode over time?
---
Bad luck for me then that's my usual spot I look
---
Like this one :)
---
Its alright I found the right dome after watching a video for t51 skin but the dome 2 didn’t open is it because I’ve opened it before
---
Are you accusing me of relying on rumors to refute the rumors you heard?
---
No Nuke, but usually when the server is higher level the Protectron's very often spawn a 3* Legendary and the loot from them tends to be at a higher value on the table then ghouls from Whitespring. 
---
In my few dozen times at both and talking to a few others experience.
---
Why would anyone above 50 even do that event? 3 star monster that spawn don't drop max level items.
---
And this one :)
---
ya so far thats my best option. thx. 
---
I get you're making a joke, but that is mid 2000s graphics at worst. 
---
If you've read enough holotapes you can probably infer the passage in my original lore holotape mentioning ***"a game has this many issues"*** automatically infers that the communication has been poor.
---
And there is a ton of environmental storytelling all over the place. I love it. 
---
So if a level 45 pump shotgun with no legendary effects does 100 damage, a two shot level 45 pump shotgun with the same configuration (aside from two shot, of course) would do 200 damage? If so, two shot is a lot better than I originally thought. Aside from the spread issue you mentioned. 
---
Because my XBox would tell me the game needed to update.
---
Eventually you'd have a court case about people pirating holotape music :P A big smugglers ring of people sharing music.
---
I don’t even listen to this hr radio on my pipboy, but I wish my cardboard shack that I call a camp had one

Not assuming everyone is cheating. But in case Bethesda decides to strike down on the people doing the cheating, I'd very much love for them to get the chance to make the assessment themselves. All I saw were two people oneshotting people who did nothing, then proceeded to build an artillery cannon. With it being used for duping, and bobblehead stacking effectively ruining the game in terms of numbers, if's a fair enough assumption to make, at the very least.
---
Also, is the mutation bug very recent? Took a small break, but never ever had any issues with people smacking me and enabling PvP that way, even while having the mutation. It clearly doesn't trigger until the third hit here, so there's either a massive delay, or I assume just having it (whether it procs or not?) can bug out and enable PvP?
---
They have a large patch coming soon, and they had a few pretty big ones in December
---
Ive done some testing with bloodied explosive and tse, both being pretty much the same screen damage. Idk why the tse has the same dmg being only one extra pellet, who knows. Nice thing about the bloody weapon is your accuracy doesnt suffer. 
---
YOU HAVNT EVEN ORDERED IT?!
---
Jesus fucking Todd Christ....this.....fucking this....fuck...give flares a purpose
---
just curious..how many hrs have you put in?
---
&gt; designed by devs who clearly don't actually play the game. 
---
This! Said this multiple times and upvote this now: if devs were playing their own crap, so many things would be different.
---
Thanks, Robin
---
That would require effort and creativity by the devs, though.
---
I hear ya, but I think that what people are doing with their creative camps is amazing because of those restrictions. Honestly it just motivates me to collect all the plans so I can build something I will be proud of when I finally find a forever home spot.
---
It does. As a secondary point, not the main point. A secondary point I wasn't talking about but you were. Not sure why we're still arguing about this.
---
The last update according to my XBox was December 11th. 
---
Well I would like to give you some caps in exchange for calibrated shocks, and have tried to contact you repeatedly on PSN to make that happen. But for whatever reason,  my message isn't getting to you. 
---
Claim it and dump it. If youre on the server long enough to defend it, don't. Wait for the "retake" quest and then do that. As for resources, skip those until servers get more reliable. 
---
Imo in the current meta workshops are more of a vehicle for pvp than anything else. 
---
Hey when are you online?
---
None of the Brahmins from my fertilizer depots drop meat.  I'm wondering if OP is getting something from the perks.
---
&gt; Shut up fat, sweaty neckbeard. The game is FUCKING ATROCIOUS GARBAGE. If you like it, you simply have trash taste in games. I don't see how this is debatable. They fucking swindled you.
---
What the fuck is wrong with you that you have to get so pissed at people for liking different types of games than you? You're throwing petty insults at people for liking a thing. You sound like a fucking baby. Grow up, kid.
---
The social menu is kind of crazy. Sometimes it will show me "Join" and a different picture for a teammate I'm trying to fast travel to. Sometimes it shows everyone offline. Most of the time it works for me.
---
You can join each other's server through the PS4 menu (Friends -&gt; Playing -&gt; Join) if the social menu doesn't give you the option, doesn't appear, or shows them offline. From there the invites _usually_ work, but sometimes I have to find the other person in-world and invite them.
---
Make sure you aren't already on a broken team. From the social menu press dpad up until you highlight your name at the top, X, "Leave Team" (if it's there). Try sending invites again.
---
It was terrible this morning, several 100+ players with chinese names and the server hung for ten seconds repeatedly for several minutes, until finally it hung for over a minute, and I just left. Fuck that.
---
Lol like two shot explosive but with unbreaking.
---
I haven’t received anything from you 
---
Feel free to add me! PSN is futile-devices. I really like to play solo and play at a snails pace, sneaking everywhere, but there's a magic to randomly teaming up with strangers. Feels like a whole different game, way less serious!
---
The serums themselves cost 4K from vendors?
---
I’ve come across several people on PC selling serums for 750-1000 caps or free with mats, and cheaper on consoles. I feel bad for those who bought from vendors : (
---
Lol yea, one time I thought it was moo moo and was about to go in full mourning mode cause the brahmim had a caravan pack.
---
Do you have Herbivore or Carnivore?  Serums do not work after you have either of those 2 mutations.  I guess the Serums do not count as either meat or vegetable.  Hopefully they fix this soon, otherwise you have to make sure you get one of those last.
---
I get that.  But being vague and then promoting stuff that can easily be taken care of/issues that haven't been what most people are having problems with as a big news for an update makes it seem like the more important stuff like server crashes and freezes are on the backburner...
---
You should see all of those golf outfits I "duped". And bulking cork and bone at Whitespring to sell for caps to fast travel to collect ingredients for my Cranberry Relish. Call me Super Duper.
---
I don't care who's right here, just please drop the condescending shtick, for everyone's benefit.
---
Thank you for the very helpful response. 
---
It feels important to let people know they don't have to rock the TSEs or best to succeed. There are those of us doing it with readily available stuff.
---
How much stuff do you pack around? And not just weight.
---
That is exactly how rumors start.  No you don't...
---
Are you able to run two sessions on the same PC or are you using a second?
---
I'm home around 5 I have to hit the store. 
---
10k caps is a ton of caps I have to be honest
---
I absolutely love this!
---
I just launched my first nuke with one teammate.  Had 8 others join us to kill the queen.  Friendo dc'ed once but managed to rejoin  before we killed the queen.  Promptly disconnected after we decided to go flower picking, but DAMN am I ready to do it all again!  
---
Yep, lvl 33 here. It took everything I had.
---
And all reported. 🤷‍♀️ Again, you’re a dumbass. 
---
i know they've said that they cant do anything retroactive about dupers but i think a simple algorithm that checks anyone who has an unnaturally high count of something should be wiped or banned. 
---
absolutely zero people have farmed 1500 nuka colas or bobbleheads
---
Okay I'll add you when I get home.  I run a power armour build similar but of course damage could be much higher with unyeielding gear on lol.  I'm at work now.  But yeah I want to see how much it actually does to a pacifist player.
---
K
---
But what about the phantom purifiers in my camp budget... 51% man I hope they fix it soon.
---
'They' have never said any such thing that I can recall; can you show a source for this claim?  I most often see it regurgitated by those who duped or know they're in possession of duped item(s).
---
Across total strangers is understandable.  I find it more annoying that you don't even share loot/xp with a teammate standing next to you.
---
Back in my day (yes I said that.. I'm so old).. 40 or more hours of gameplay was a huge game and if you wanted anymore out of it you just played again.
---
That being said, this is my first venture into online gaming, so I'm looking forward to more storylines/quests/etc
---
It's partly mistruth for me to claim "people on this sub" because it can't be cited like its some unilaterally thinking world force. But its also partly true.
---
I realize a lot of old school Fallout players (like myself) are disappointed in FO76 for reasons such as lore and authenticity but there are numerous issues which are not representative of what a customer should expect from a $60 game sold by a company like Bethesda/Zenimax.
---
While I make some concession about my claims concerning the opinions of this subreddit's users as a whole, I'm not quite ready to agree that there is some "social justice agenda" (**your words**) behind asking a company to release proper products.
---
I agree that duping, cheating, hacking and griefing are individual choices. The problem I have is any company entering the space of multiplayer games should know this and should be prepared for it to happen. I'm generally open to what players can do, and rather than banning people, I prefer well-designed game systems that allow a player's imagination to run rampant.
---
Bethesda hasn't worked on either of those. There's no banning and there are no proper game systems. That is my issue.
---
I kind of like the vampire outfit from the store. Now have the black tux but an all black one would be awesome. I also wear the black military cap and wraparound goggles.
---
Combat Shotgun can be silenced too
---
They might be less annoying if they weren’t everywhere and had less health. It would make sense since their bones are most likely weak if they can fly 
---
If your suggestions involve sweeping buffs in every way I'd suggest rethinking all of them
---
Agreed. I've managed to get 2 characters to 80+, have helped out quite a few friends in their grind, completed all the quests twice, have casually explored pretty much every location I can find.... it's a great game, but to expect the current content to hold over the more hardcore players isn't very reasonable. I love this game just as much as any other die hard 76 fan but posts like these feel like they are aimed at discounting legitimate criticism. I know I'm not alone in thinking the end game needs more substance to it. The game definitely isn't hollow, but it certainly lacks a real sense of purpose once you've done it all. I'd even be happy with variety in events at max level. 
---
Definitely!
---
 I was running around in a 156 Def Raider Torso and my friend freaked out and said, "That's a glitched armor! Sell it for massive caps". My reply was.. I actually used a perk card to craft this and then damaged it.. then repaired it to 200% with the perk cards. It's all been here from the start and the raider look intrigues me with the different styles that they add from the different mods you put on it. It works with all armor that can be crafted and repaired to 200% with 1-3* legendary gears for those extra bonuses.
---
ts gatling with a long barrel or a ts .50 cal are taking down SBs in few seconds.
---
&gt; \- Third, related to the second, just because the plan doesn't spawn,  doesn't mean it's been exhausted for the 24 hour window. Plans have  'various' probabilities of appearing, for some locations they're  practically 100% guaranteed, for others they have a very low probability  of appearing. So long as you haven't picked up anything in the area,  you should be able to reload the game, and 'eventually' the plan will  spawn in the given location, so long as you haven't farmed this area in  the past 24 hours. 
---
This cant be right, I farm Top of the World a lot, to the point where i got up to 2000 carry weight with all the crap i just started picking up, repeatedly for multiple days in a row.  
---
The two plan spawns at the top of the hill before you go into top of the world and then the ones in the bazaar behind the sky resort have several locations that are easy to remember and check on multiple re logs. 
---
i never have issues with them no spawning after a certain point. 
---
&gt;Why can't they say "we realize duping is a big issue and we're combatting this starting today by issuing 7 day bans to accounts found to be using server exploits"?
---
The fact of the matter is that for every player that's aware of the dupe glitch, there's a fair number who don't follow the game on YouTube or read Reddit and aren't aware of it. 
---
If they come out and explicitly say "We're going to fix the duplication glitch in our next patch", everyone who didn't know about it now has 5 days to figure out how to do it and exploit it if they want. It'll just make the situation worse.
---
Either he didn't know that or didn't care.
---
Sounds good, my friend. I will be online tonight 
---
I used one of the carry weight exploits before, never had any problems. Since the one I used got patched, I'm under normal weight for character and stash. I don't keep a lot of extraneous items either (holos, costume pieces, etc).
---
Essentially a standard stash and character load.
---
I also had that thought. It would be nice to have a bunker under your CAMP.
---
Did you compared screen damage when you were full health, essentially negating the bloodied effect? Id love to get a bloodied explosive pump, i hardly ever see any for trade. Supposed to be getting an anti armor one later, picked up a TSE last night. From what I’ve seen, it’s generally regarded that best in slot order goes Bloodied explosive -&gt; AA explosive -&gt; TSE, would you agree?
---
And it's basically just dragons in Fallout 4. Goddammit, Todd did it again. He sold us Skyrim as Fallout 4.
---
I found the plan for Marine Torso in the bottom floor display case at Harpers Ferry last night. 
---
Anti Armor does wonders right!? :)
---
This will be the handmade at Harpers Ferry I reckon. Bought one for 1000 caps from another player last night because I'm overlevelled. Was almost definitely duped but not sure what else I was supposed to do, did Patrol Duty like 15 times already.
---
Cool base
---
FYI if the resources were green when you were building they came from the workshop and not your inventory/stash. Most workshops aren't worth using your own resources for, thankfully you mostly don't have to.
---
They definitely need to be reworked. I think I would prefer some smaller ones(maybe one-third the size and one-eighth the health) that you see around from time to time and then one big legendary one(with greatly reduced/reworked ranged attacks) that is part of an event.
---
"dayurnal" should be "diurnal"
---
WHAT.
---
Are you serious?
---
Since I've gotten a similar comment twice I'll amend point three to reflect the more common consensus, and try to verify it myself. Thank you.
---
Getting caps is easy if you spend the time collecting the right stuff to sell and make a daily run through all of the vendors getting all of their caps. 
---
Ah yeah I understand.  Was joking.  Don't know where it would balance best.. but i'd sure love to see that as a mod.
---
Its based on a player entering the cell, its why you can go "outside" and then back in and have a new set of mobs to deal with along with the meat piles. 
---
Ok, I'll let them know.
---
Op is worried about polluting his house with fumes from the chemistry workbench and power armour station and I’m over here having had four medium generators next to my bed going 24/7.
---
(Until I finally motivated myself to do a “powering up” event on this character).
---
I put the game on the shelf after playing for two weeks. I am probably not coming back until they fix their game and add mod support and/or private servers. 
---
That’s good! I’m still trying to figure out the basics, obviously. 
---
Agree, I barely play on my main character anymore as he's full of items and resources. 
---
Nice house and you look like an Amish Hit Man.
---
&gt; ha
---
Sorry that you're understanding of modern video game lore prevents you from looking at stories with multiple layers.
---
There's hope for you yet, friend, you can still learn the concept of multifaceted stories and discussion if you dedicate your time to reading more text and playing more games!
---
It's interesting to see all of these topics about rampant duping, and if that is the reason for the server issues, then I am all for fixing it, but, I have to say that I have not once encountered someone trying to trade with me that has an insanely large inventory or even anything noteworthy to trade for. Where are these dupers? I don't see them. If they are duping just to hold onto things in their own inventory, what's the point? shouldn't they be actively trying to trade with people to profit?
---
Nah honestly its the 1 shot deaths i get when im at public workshops from level 150 players. 
---
Kinda annoyed how pc users get free stuff though 
---
Aliens would be cool like some people been saying, but i should probably add that they spawn as fast travel or walk around n they have no loot on them either
---
What platform?
---
Lmao. You don't go to a whitesprings nuke for flux. Sounds like you really know your end game. You go there for the mass spawns and legendary ghouls that drop max level gear. It's a solid hour of really good legendary farming. They need to fix the game before adding content. I would be pissed if I had shiny new content that was barely playable. 
---

I’ve been on the hunt for a while, I expected them to appear for Faschnacht , wasn’t aware the owl had surfaced!

XBone
---
You can try two things. Validate your installation by scanning and repairing the launcher from the Bethesda desktop application. The second might be to check your upload/download speeds. 
---
The number of disconnects you’re experiencing sounds to be more of a unique case - even with other players being a plausible explanation, even they couldn’t cause so many disconnects in such a short period of time. 
---
They're notorious for accidentally applying damage bonuses per-pellet instead of per-shot or per-second without appropriate scaling.
---
In Fallout 3, most of the shotguns and automatics had no critical damage, but the few that did, like [The Terrible Shotgun](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/The_Terrible_Shotgun) had their criticals multiplied per-bullet/beam, so you could one-shot any enemy in the game except maybe those albino radscorpions. There were also Superior Defender and Ghoul Ecology perks that did the same straight-up bonus per projectile.
---
Fallout 76 just has that Explosive effect I think, but that's enough. Fallout 4 also had a Wounding effect (bleed stacked per bullet) that was really powerful.
---
If they added a cooldown, like 1/4 second between explosions, or they reduced it according to the fire rate and pellets per shot, I think that'd balance it out a lot.
---
From MY experience maybe 3-4
---
All the black powders seem to break fast, even with 5* gunsmith. 
---
Actually... Commies would want to distribute the loot evenly... These bastards want it for themselves, or no one at all.
---
Do you have your heavy weapons perk cards equipped?
---
Thank you for the update and thank you all for the posts
---
In my experience it's always "too much stuff is happening" that disconnects me. I did the Night event at Sons of Dane compound, and I had a pile of maybe 40 ghoul corpses, if not more, some of which turned to meat piles. Then when the event finished, I started looting all the kills, which wasn't a great idea, because it crashed me. Same with other things. If I very slowly and carefully pick up all the grown stuff in my camp (I run a big adhesive farm), then it's usually OK. But if I just run through it, spamming E, especially with the Green Thumb perk, it tends to disconnect.
---
You using gunsmith?
---
If not, you should.
---
Mostly anecdotally my experience is exactly the same. It's weird that they have an entire mutation built around boosting INT but nothing to actually do with INT in-game. You're probably a few pieces of unyielding and a couple of Toxic Goo from max even without an INT heavy (non-heavy gunner?) build.
---
It seems like a pretty nominal gain. Maybe something you would do if you wanted to sit down and craft all of your armor, power armor, and weapons from scratch in one sitting?
---
The Science perks are very good for energy weapons (right, no one uses those...) and obvious Power Armor Patcher but do nothing for already existing weapons/armor outside of Fix It Good/Weapon Artisan that you can hot-swap.
---
They fixed this issue, I am able to use serums with herbivore. 
---
All of those hints about me NOT wanting a multifaceted discussion was not obvious enough, eh?
---
Speaking of heads. Have you seen the house with all the mounted cat heads in it? Its so creepy. 
---
Buggy af. I have 300+ hours in and love the hell out of the game.
---
Its an absolute bugfest.
---
they're buffs to underpowered and unused perk cards this is to get them in-line with other perks in the game so every build doesn't have so many of the same perk cards
---
vendors always are out of caps for me...maybe get 200/day
---
I love it
---
I could easily see Bethesda adding that for "immersion" or "realism". Or they suck at coding. Ill let you decide.
---
Server crashes last night just as someone nuke hit fissure prime (I was finally going to do the scorch beast queen!)
---
I mean I know it was from people running around whitesprings killing robots (there had been a nuke zone there and glowing bloated ones were still spawning...I have a lot of legendaries to go through) so that the number of robots was constantly increasing exponentially but...that is still in Bethesda.
---
It likely disappeared immediately.  There's a bug where sometimes a bag doesn't generate when you drop something.  The best method if you have to drop something is to drop something cheap first, then open the trade window with the bag.
---
I'd never drop my good stuff on the ground though just because if the server crashes or even you disconnect, you might not be able to make it back to that server.
---
Thye need to check the hashes of the other exes running in userland. That way renaming it won't work.
---
I never wear buttons,
---
but I gotta cool hat.
---
All the homies agree
---
I really look good in black.
---
Do those perks hide you from players also? i cant imagine being sneaky when people have access to a map with your position on it. 
---
Oh. And the duping, I don't buy duped shit. It affects me bc there's players on the map with millions of pounds of shit intentionally crashing themselves out of the server. So yea. It does affect me and you and our gameplay. 
---
I just told you that I sent you multiple messages under the name deadpelican. If you haven't gotten them, then what does that tell you? That maybe there's some kind of problem on the PSN that is interfering with me sending you messages maybe?  So maybe if you could try messaging me instead?  
---
2, I’m on Xbox. I have over 200 hours and have one game impacting glitch/crash and maybe 4 visual bugs 
---
I would rather they do what killing floors devs do and release skins for enemies that coincide with whatever holiday it is at the time.
---
please note the platform you're on. thx!
---
Yeah without bloody kicking in it's almost half the damage of tse. At 20% health the bloody is almost the same screen dmg. I personally would prefer anti armor or bloody over tse just cause the fact tse spread is so large only half the pellets hit most of the time
---
Yikes, was hoping PC and a quick driver check, but that's pretty rough for a console. 
---
I'm sure you'll be fine... just fine. 
---
Over a week period? I haven't kept track before but frankly, it felt like the normal amount of disconnects me and my circle of friends normally experience
---
pics?
---
Luckily I kill them for stealth and don’t really experience it (and VATS still takes them down fast if they detect me and start spamming).
---
But I’m dreading a silo run 
---
You can get alot of plastic from the cat bowls there. I forget where that place was at. 
---
It always spawns dead for some reason.
---
Maybe 2-3? It's playable for sure, and even enjoyable at times. But it is incredibly buggy. 
---
Ooohhhh!!!  That explains how I can buy something for 50 caps, and their cap supply only goes up by 30!  The damn bots are skimming.
---
I hope it’s Gary. Gary is a great deathclaw name
---
Not everyone, but the hardcore fans are.  
---
I have not.... Good luck - they're tiny, maybe 5" diameter. Look on exposed Rock for a silver disc.
---
We could mount weapons and animals even back in skyrim....come on beth!
---
I didn't get that impression at all. Especially since they said they're fixing some exploits, which hopefully means the ones related to the server problems. Either way, Monday should be a good day.
---
Well I think Bethesda have been on Christmas break, so I wasnt expecting thqt big of an update.
---
What did they get free? 
---
I wanted to use energy weapons, that's what is killing the game for me. Not being able to use it more than once in annoying.
---
Crazy. Not sure what to suggest. On ps4 i dc once in a blue moon now but my network setup is unique
---
Also kept ctashing on the PC, literally have to force shut down.
---
8
---
That's actually a brilliant idea. I might take this and warp it a bit
---
Seems pretty standard as I compare notes with my circle of friends who play... don't get me wrong, loving the game, big fallout fan... just funny some of the circumstances that get me DC'd
---
To which game
---
Couldn't do a pic with menu open, forgot about printscreen
---
He's always dead on mine as well. I may be wrong but I don't think It's possibly for him to be alive and actually trade.
---
I found man mask in ft defiance. Didnt even know what it was at the time.
---
You sure love telling people how many hours you've played this game
---
All users get the Fallout Collection (if they had played the game in 2018).
---
PS4 and Xbone users get the free stuff too.  But they have to play it on PC.
---
This worked very well for me.
---
3 or 4. Sometimes you can go a while without any bug, but if you start doing a lot of stuff you're gonna start seeing some bugs. And some of them are annoying and some of them just stop you from being able to do what you're trying to do. Some bugs are good like beneficial stuff I don't want to say because I'm not in a hurry for them to ghet fixed, and they make up for the bad bugs, but every time I get into my power armor wearing normal armor PA items get unequipped. Stupid stuff like that that doesn't effect gameplay much. I'm more concerned about gameplay bugs that I don't even know are happening under the hood. Like perks not working. That concerns me because I expect every perk to work exactly how it's meant to at all times. That's just something that should really work, and if it's not working then that's a big problem for me.
---
they could be doing server side updates that have issues.  or some blame the duplication glitch because certain players have far more inventory items than they should and that the server hardware cant handle it.
---
hard to say and on this side we will never know.  i worked at compaq/hp once upon a world ago.  i did QA and testing including test plan writing.  i have sat across the table from developers that will lie directly to everyones face for weeks and blame issues on improper testing.  then when they finally do 'fix' a problem it was never what was suggested the issue was.  so.  good times.  LOL
---
&gt;they can't win
---
They brought that upon themselves and I don't pity them
---
I'm dreading a silo run too now I know they'll be in there, confined spaces and spamming assaultrons with no real way to dodge the beam..... just great lol
---
Someone offered 10k caps. That is about 2 hours :) 
---
What about having a fusion generator next to my bed...could there possibly be any harm from that?
---
I’ve heard mobile phones can give you cancer but nuclear energy is the safest energy so I’m pretty confident I’ll be okay, it’s probably even good for me!
---
Thats a random event, some times its a bomb some times its a dead witch or a vertibird or a deathclaw
---
If you say so.
---
At a glance your changes would free up 10ish perks for one of my builds.
---
My character, that is already unstoppable, would get a massive boost.
---
I wouldn't even have to make decisions o perks to take and what not too.
---
Well it works fine on Xbox. 
---
That’s exactly how you’ll feel about the water fountain too!  Hahahhaha 
---
These inside the vault articles are getting worse as time goes on. Stop being so fucking vague in them or just don't them at all. These next two patches better have some significant fixes and explanations like they promised.
---
take me home...
---
200 hours insides online game is low. In such game I would probably spend 200 hours just to get to the part, where I have done questing and now I start collecting that sweet endgame gear from raid/dungeons and PVP. Exploring some pointless POI isn't endgame. If I wanted to go sightseeing I would travel to Japan or Germany, not buy video game. 
---
Where the heck is this? I've been all over Appalachia and haven't found a covered bridge! Very cool!
---
Its possible. In fallout 2 there was a deathclaw colony that were smart and could talk, but they were wiped out
---
The cryolator forces a scorchbeast to stay grounded.
---
I used this on the qween and me and the group decimated the qween very quickly.
---
So if you have a player with a snowball Cryolator you can keep the scorchbeast grounded indefinitely. 
---
You looked into my soul for #3
---
Hey. Just a heads up. I’m reading your exchange and you’re coming off as a kind of a jerk. I don’t think you even realize it. People are downvoting you because “if” is a general term to reply with if you, yourself, can’t verify something. It is both reasonable and nonagressive. Your immediate dive off the deep end into being overly offended with aggressive posturing to something as inoffensive as the word “if” is pretty unreasonable. I’m sure you’re going to either dismiss me outright, or insist I am wrong. Instead, I’m hoping you take this and reevaluate how you act towards people.    
---
P.S. Phrases like “have fun in your own little world” and “when you remove your head from your rear” are incredibly condescending. It may behoove you to consider not accusing someone of something and then immediately doing the same thing yourself. 
---
I'll check tonight - i do have a strange weight issue.. its nothing like 200lbs though.  Did you move items from any other tab?  The MISC tab can easily bulk up fast if you don't keep an eye on it.
---
Thanks! It usually had a tad more detail, but I'd been animal taming so the budget was around 80%? Not the most cinematic pictures either. Wanted to do it better justice after living there for a month, but I got ancy in wanting to just pick up and move to a new idea, so I spent like 5 minutes doing a quick screenshot run through at any angle I could. Threw that post together in a few minutes, then immediately scrapped, haha.

Weird and brutal treatment for my month+ build, lol. Getting detail and cool with it is easy and almost guaranteed if you just approach it right.
---
Once you get a neat sounding idea and location, just start building. Use your imagination as anyone would, think up certain areas for certain things, rooms, whatever. Decorate it. Be intentful.  Hit max budget!
---
This is where a lot of people don't go much further. They'll remove a thing or two, add a thing or two. Eventually they get bored and move.
---
Key to getting something a bit more interesting is to just, keep, going. Getting the itch to stand around in your CAMP for 4 hours, never level, and totally forget to drink and eat to the point of literal near death in game and likely life? Guess what. You gotta stay RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE. You chose that spot for a REASON. You had BIG DREAMS. Yes you did well. It's better than 90% of the stuff you come across. But you know you're better than *you* of all people right? That little bitch? Thinks he's better than you? You going to take that from you? 
---
How do we begin to insult that which our younger selves called art? Consolidate. 
---
Look at your base. What is *honestly* cool about it? You had some great ideas. You've probably got a favorite area of the CAMP. Maybe a cool light scheme in the bedroom, maybe the view is killer out of a certain side. Others are, well, there. These are the spaces to focus on. Your favorite spots will get cooler and cooler as time goes on and you get more decorating budget. 
---
People seem to like a LOT of open space in their CAMP building. Good concept, but many of us are more mentally oriented toward *filling* a home in a way that creates use and space. We really aren't good at it without having the borders of walls or floors. Things stretch. Gaps get bigger for no apparent reason, extra floors are built having you walk an extra 3 seconds because reasons. 
---
Chop these areas up and repurpose. If you don't need an extra floor panel to get from point A to point B, rip it out. Would your Vault Dweller honestly sit and spend all day building a wooden floor foundation just so he has some extra walking space? No. That'd be an illogical waste of time and physical effort when walls should probably be built after building enough "space" yeah? 
---
A lot of stuff spaced along a wall? Squish and tear out a square. 
---
But your building had such a neat silhouette!
---
 It's less about the contents, more about the concept! 
---
Nah. it can be better. 
---
Bring it in. Maintain your original theme and just get it tighter and tighter. Eventually you'll find you chopped off an entire upper floor or big ass concept room you got bored of after 2 days of your own joke. Start fleshing out your base with minute details. Go to each area of each room. What is it's purpose? what tools are available to do more than just fill it, but accent and detail it? 
---
Eventually? You'll literally have a mental bullet list where you justify the use of *each* and *every* floor panel.
---
I could literally talk for an hour about that base I made. Yeahhhh I probably spent too much time with it and rethinking it. But honestly really felt good to share it, and *actually* felt like home for my character. I'm semi-mobile right now and I fuckin miss my little bunker. Honestly the highlight of my experience with the game so far as a F4 settlement addict.
---
They should have just said check the patch notes
---
You can have what u want from me, look at my post. Or I can pay more.
---
I also said that it's not a one sided problem. Unreasonable players are part of the problem.
---
And of course someone replies in such a manner, proving what I'm saying. Some players make it harder for companies to be more open or communicate.
---
Many because those players end up being assholes about everything. 
---
Awesome thank you, I'll post mentioning that as well.
---
All I’m missing is bird bones but I won’t be on till later tonight.  I’ll message when I can
---
Hmm, considering quest rewards in Bethesda games typically suck and don’t cover the costs involved in completing them.
---
I offer 50 caps if you can bring me 50 stable flux of each type.
---
3 maybe. I'm on PC. 
---
I thought each fissure should be a different local boss style encounter to the main type of enemy for said location. This goes a bit deeper but I feel you one of the greatest aspects of the game is dwindled to a couple of spots that are worthwhile to nuke.   
---
Weapon Artisan, used during crafting/repair.
---
They suuuuure do lol
---
To make a, you know, fallout shelter
---
So would I be in the wrong if I happened to destroy said base because I couldn't get any kills due to the turrets?
---
I have the exact same view! It’s a nice spot except when I log in and some jerk makes me server hop because he is there.... ;-)
---
But if that were the case, shouldn’t I be seeing more people with better stuff to trade? Whether it’s high level or low level, everyone I have run into since inception has basically had the same type of inventory as myself.
---
I would be stoked to run into someone that had a spare handmade plan or even just a stupid BoS CA arms plan which I have never once been lucky enough to find. Duped or not, I would totally score those 2 items.
---
So I'm level 37, usually solo, and am on the I Am Become Death mission. When I grab only one code, it says I can then go into the Silo site (which doesn't make sense - I thought it had to have 8?), but based on what I've heard and seen, it's pretty much impossible solo. So, should I just mill about the land doing random things to grind up? Or what?
---
I've hunted for the Legendary bot in Watoga several times, found it a few but it was always a 1*. Never paid attention to the aggregate PC levels though when I did. 
---
Right? I also want to build my base behind a water fall inside a mountain.
---
I know sneak in general hides you off the map from other players unless you are wanted. It also hides you from their compass, whether wanted or not. I don't believe sneak perks help either way for players. I could be wrong, though. 
---
Just get a buddy to clear your bounties for you and have him buy a water off of you for the difference in caps.
---
You dont lose any caps, the other guy gets his cheesy turret camp demolished.
---
That's a fair argument and something I hadn't fully considered.
---
I do think in the case of Fallout 76 that a majority of dedicated fans (meaning those who would actually take to forums and customer support to express displeasure at things) would be aware of these issues, but you are right in saying a significant number of players likely have no idea.
---
I still find it very weak for a company to not stand by its product in the face of these issues. I fully understand a company not investing time in making EVERY customer happy, but when there is a game-influencing issue as large as duping and severe server and client instability my bare minimum expectation is that a company would confront the issue as soon as possible rather than pretend its a minor problem.
---
If this game were 6 months old or more and this issue suddenly appeared I'd be even more understanding to what you're saying, but duping (and the server stability issues it apparently contributes to) have been present and reported since day 1 of the BETA.
---
Because of the nature of this game, its price, how significant and problematic the issue is and how relatively new the game is I think those are very valid reasons that a company should confront an issue.
---
I don't expect Bethesda or Zenimax to equip 1,000 damage amplification Bobbleheads and a Two-shot explosive damage and fire a single shot and destroy and issue instantly and for all of eternity. What I DO expect is them to acknowledge the issue many players have been frequently complaining about, which acts to devalue their non-monetary investment in the game's economy, and act like they give a damn.
---
I don't expect them to say something like "*we opened fallout76.exe in a hex editor and adjusted this specific property on line 2819324 of the code*" like many are suggesting in the comments, but I DO expect them to firstly acknowledge the issue and further to that express understanding at how significant the issue is and further to that say they're issuing bans or doing something.
---
There's no reason or expectation for an online game company to spell out the specifics of enforcing rules and EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES, but everything I've seen so far from Bethesda and Zenimax just reads as uncaring PR copy+paste.
---
Most likely a bug, I think there's also a dead person nearby? Probably the merchant tag was meant to be applied to him. I've seen this before, the deathclaw is always dead. I assume it's supposed to be an encounter where a deathclaw killed some travelling vendor.
---
holy dad joke my guy
---
&gt;Players: Bethesda needs to fix bugs before they think about new content! 
---
See when players say that they expect Bethesda to throw money at the problem and work through the holiday cause the launch was for lack of a better word unacceptable. On the player time table the bugs should have largely been fixed by weekly patches by now instead they are just getting started addressing the new issues they introduced or failed to resolve last month.
---
So yes it's a no won situation for bethesda if this bothers them then all I can say is don't rush a multiplayer game out before a major holiday. Go for a summer release instead.
---
I exclusively play in first person because I think 3rd ( even with added sight benefits) just breaks the immersion for me because I like to feel like I’m there. They have a bank to store items in. You can add space with in game currency and if you pay for ESO Plus it doubles it and gives the craft bag ( unlimited crafting material storage that is essential if you want to be a crafter). I enjoy the shit out of it ,it’s been my main game for 3 years I just take a hiatus every few months. It’s improved across the board over the years. Except DCing and unending/long ass load screens, mostly only a problem in Cyrodill (PvP area) and that give or take some days not even a hitch and some days I can barely even Pvp, but then again that’s only a small portion of the overall game. 
---
I read that entry, didn't realize that was him!
---
Id say so. My shotgun seems to cripple pretty often.
---
no negativity...I'd appreciate your answer or go somewhere else.
---
Thanks (: Surprised people are still on this post
---
thanks im sure this will help a lot
---
Keep pretending /r/thebossbabyisn't an echo chamber, kiddo. 
---
It is the mad dog malloy quest. 
---
PC, Currently, 3-5, depending on if there is more than one nuke zone and any troglodytic douche-cicles (or dupers, if you will) doing their selfish, repugnant, inexcusable thing. I keep losing cooking mats (meat, veggies, etc) from my Stash when I log out, especially if it’s something I can’t grow in my CAMP. This is driving me nuts, as I never seem to have the right ingredients for the recipes that I want to make unless I can gather them all in the same session. 
---
Nice set up. Where can I find your outfit though?! 
---
The pvp is really stupid.
---
Dude it makes no difference. Literally none. You're grinding for drops, that's all you're doing, and my points stand (none of which you replied to). You can still do that while others are farming with beefy weapons, and Bethesda making a real endgame that involves some challenge and fun beyond just gear drop grind would be a good thing. I guarantee no great number of people are going to enjoy grind farming nuke spots for months to come.
---
Yes, they need to fix the game. AND they need to improve and add to the game. And of course, any new content they produce should be playable... that's a no brainer and has nothing to do with my points.  
---
Ooh. I also hope it is Gary.
---
I’m hoping I get an explosive handmade or lever rifle before then...in fact that’s why I haven’t done yet.
---
Yes it’s cheap as hell but if I get the legendary through farming then I’ll be happy.  I ain’t buying one from a player.
---
I would buy one from an in game NPC trader though...weird double standard I know but I feel that way it’s luck and work involved as opposed to find a duper and pay them for cheating 
---
It would be nice if the first load into a server was a selection to where you would like to spawn. Have a   
---
chance to see the current server map, and then select a spawn just as one would use for FT. 
---
Obviously there would be potential for abuse, so something would need to be in place to restrict use so it's not abused. Maybe have a cap cost, but at a reduction for one time in a certain time frame.
---
That..is an excellent idea, why did I never think of it
---
I'm pretty sure it's a bug.  I don't know if bethesda as acknowledged it yet.  The keypad clearly should be on the outside and the switch on the inside.
---
I was trying not to use the word “shelter” but yes exactly
---
Read my other comment, I know
---
that would be cool
---
Looks sweet. I used to have a camp right next to that one. You will get 3 super mutants spawning near the bridge but you might be just far enough way to not deal with them. 
---
Great spot for forest healing salve. 
---
Was really hoping for info on end game content or atleast a release date on these "vaults" 
---
To come out with an "Inside the Vault" just to say, "we're making fixes!" Is vastly underwhelming... like thanks, I could've just assumed what this update was about and I would've been correct. 
---
The only hold this game has on me is the atom shop and wanted player hunting. That's it. 
---
And that discourages me, it's like creation club, I'll totally buy the new Zeta Arsenal stuff! But I have nothing to use it on other than the countless mobs of enemies I've been farming for two years... really depressing. 
---
Good point 
---
I can see endless clipping issues with this. Great in theory, would be a monster to code, as essentially every square meter of the map would essentially need a sub layer.
---
If the wasteland has taught me anything, it is that being irradiated only makes you stronger and glow-in-the-dark. 
---
 I had fairly high level wolves attack me there, but just once. A place for a purifier and its just perfect for someone with business in Watoga.
---
I have one spare handmade plan if you are on pc hit me up. 
---
You just left one! Lolz
---
But yeah I get it
---
It works exactly the way it did in FO4, with no thought given nor effort made to consider the consequences in a multiplayer setting.
---
PC - 1 to 2 on older machine at High Settings. 
---
Yes, not that it matters though. You can't really fit anything extra after the essentials like crafting stations and turrets anyways.
---
Phones.
---
I tend to stock up inside the whitespring. 
---
Not true, Census Violence has given me T60 servos twice in a row before
---
1st of jan is actually partially copied from Nov 27
---
Nice, I made mine on the broken bridge near the mountainside B&amp;B. 
---
I see. That helps solve a little bit of the mystery. Ive had scorchbeasts just give up once i cripple their wings, then blast all their legs. I run a stealth character and they just stand there as i shoot their face.
---
But then other times.. It seemed to not really matter. Crippled wings. Still flies up into the air.
---
Perhaps this is due to a scorch presence?
---
Yep, Mutants love to come stomp my crops! Sometimes one of them spawns inside my power closet too. XD
---
Hes using the +100 carry weight glitch, you dont need the optimized servos in your legs if you just log out with the suit on. 
---
It seems like it keeps turning itself back on, too.   I listen to Appalachia Radio and was happy to be awarded a jukebox plan, but not as much when I found it only played the Classical Radio.  I switch it off since it clashes with the Pip Boy radio but it seems to like to turn itself back on.  I may just have to stash it.
---
get the perk starched genes, and then the only way to lose mutations is to use a decontamination arch like the ones in the enclave bunker.
---
Well I was in T60, so it looked imperial.
---
I’m a PS4 dude. Maybe that also contributes to this controversy. Not to say that duping isn’t happening on all platforms, the servers are awful for everyone, but maybe more people are running into duper’s on XB and PC?
---
Since you've already resigned to being dismissed there wasn't a point in making this post. It may behoove you to save time in the future by just not.
---
Nope, can't find one. You're probably right, but like others (again) have said, the creation engine doesn't really have systems to take care of that kind of problem. I'd honestly be surprised if they could even tell what was in player inventory. 
---
Well, after 25 years my thought was that a robot maintained the machines and converted them. 
---
*shrug*
---
Stop duping these posts
---
Thank you!   This is enough for me to jump in and give it a go.  Just curious, are there locations in Cyrodiil and Skyrim that are totally recognizable from  the original games?
---
Using the same PC. If you’re worried about stressing your PC out, you can run two sessions in bordered window at a lower resolution. I run two session full screen and everything is smooth.
---
Never seen it. That sounds terrifying.
---
whats your platform/score?
---
thx!
---
I think each city or map area should have several, just listed a few as ideas.
---
True, but since you can’t build everywhere on the map or outside your build ring only green light camp areas would need sub layers 
---
Enclave Officer Hat makes me feel like a sea captain
---
Harpers ferry has them. $400 caps was what I paid lvl2 bargain perk
---
It's not illegal but is against tos he could be banned.
---
There is a super mutant vendor as well, but I have only seen him alive.
---
If possible, it would be nice but there are massive coding issues. They would have to remake the entire world over (well under) to accommodate this I believe.
---
MHW is the fucking jam. Definitely a contender for best game of 2018
---
I'll try it
---
I actually have only used it on scorchbeast queen since.my gatling gun shreds them. I will try to check tonight if i have time
---
&gt;It's not like they're gonna have a huge info dump every week, either.
---
IKR it's not like they stated they "heard us" about communication and promised, like I don't know, a roadmap or something! I mean it's not like they specifically used the phrase "patch notes" when saying they'd have an update "soon!" I mean it's just be insane if they did all those things, and then put out an announcement the night before making an announcement that they're gonna announce stuff later!
---
That'd just be nuts!
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2018/12/81cf730f.png
---
Quick glance and all the clustered locations are workshops, didn't see many others that could potentially be dual farmed.
---
If they feel resentment they’re letting their own feelings and past poor decisions affect current business.
---
That’s on them not on Bethesda.
---
PC. At launch/ beta, 8. Now between 3 and 4.
---
With the way you're trying to belittle and dismiss the OP you don't sound like you're too sure of your arguments, like you know you're wrong but are trying to get some satisfaction out of the exchange anyway. Please keep going, though: it's always fun to see tantrums being thrown in front of the community 
---
Bethesda hasn't changed, they're still releasing fun sandbox games with mediocre "anything else".
---
If you want a different formula, there is plenty to choose from. :)
---
Bar length, but don't expect double or anything like that. Science Expert makes the initial crafting cheaper which is really nice for trying to unlock expensive (gauss rifle) weapon mods from scrap loop.
---
No it wasn't. I just tested it again relogged and everything and lost the serum again no mutation but used a adrenal reaction and got the mutation afterwards. Bird bones just isn't working for me, it hasn't anything to do with sg.
---
If get server disconnected, the server has actually crashed and the world is no longer there.
---
If you get a game crash on your client, the server is still there.
---
one of the what? And no,  nor do I shoot up someone's camp simply because it displeased me.  While building it there may be a dick move,  so is wiping it out.  You don't own the golf course 
---
if you've got power armor, a melee weapon and couple of perks you can do it. I killed my first at level 26 with excavator armor and a lvl 15 zealot's ski sword. it took about 10 minutes and 20 stimpaks but i did it and i was proud as hell!
---
I'd say 6-7. Many of these things are more straight up annoying than game breaking but all together it can get rough if you're unlucky. When it launched it was worse. I play on PC... I have a pc more than capable of running this game on max and good internet. Some things I've run into:
---
Multiple "infinite" loading screens(probably happens once every gaming session)
---
I've gotten stuck in terrain/ objects probably 5 times and had to relog
---
Lost objects/ random objects appearing in inventory/ legendaries changing their abilities a few times
---
Game just crashing - probably 5+ times
---
Bullets/damage not registering or delayed - happens pretty often
---
Inventory/loot not loading or taking a while on corpses/boxes/resource extractors. This one is super common and pretty damn annoying. 
---
Certain guns or weapons I feel like don't work correctly. The armor enchantment that gives you a stealth field when you stand still is a shitshow the last time I used it. Makes things lag/makes using pipboy a mess
---
Mobs being frozen/ not moving or loading correctly. Happens with scorched a lot for some reason
---
I can probably think of more those are ones off the top of my head lol. Still love fallout and this game but it needs work
---
I used to use an acid/lead location....but was frequently hit by scorch beast...it's in the east.  acid is next to a cave but the lead is down a cliff and its not to eacy to grab both with your camp but it is possible.  
---
I mean I use gunsmith 5* just hurts I can't take 5 pts in critical bonuses, flat damage, utilities etc
---
Weapons with a low rate of fire are set to do more damage per shot/hit in this game, in general, than those with a high rate of fire, which is why you see the damage stat go down when you add and auto receiver to a single shot weapon.  You might have a weapon that does 100 damage per hit with rate of fire of 1 vs a weapon that does 10 damage with a rate of fire of 20.  The second weapon can potentially do twice the damage of the first assuming the target has 200 hp for example and all shots hit.  
---
Actually loved it.  wouldn't mind doing it for video games if i knew where to begin.  Frustrating is dealing with people that have ego over truth and just getting a job done.  The instant "it couldn't possibly be me or my code...its your fault" mentality instead of a co-operative one is non productive.  Some developers (and people in general) feel threatened but literally QA/Testers jobs are to make sure that the 'issues' never get out in the open and the devs look genius!  
---
some companies under hire.  some devs are over worked.  and then sometimes what they are working on is super huge and bugs happen.  just fix them.  QA/Test/Fix/Repeat.  takes a village!
---
Non-playable character human players?
---
Maybe it was an Easter egg relating to the intelligent deathclaws but someone mistook it for a feral one and killed it
---
With as many bugs as FO76 has, atm, two patches devoted entirely to fixing some (most?) of those bugs would be great. That's exactly what they need to focus on. Stabilize the software that runs the game. Make it "just work." A reliable software foundation is needed to clear the way for cool content additions in the future.
---
So, i just used radaway until i lost the bird bones, used another serum and it said I mutated but doesn't show on effects tab neither does it apply to my caracther.
---
But you can build almost anywhere on the map, so to anticipate that JoeShmoe69 could plop down his camp anywhere, would mean that BGS would have to double code 90% of the world to support subterranean structures.
---
I feel this is somehow tied to the Whitespring robot farms with Gardner's sprouting from everywhere!
---
As a sniper, I usually pop one round of Dragon musket blasts into the head with a critical shot from sneak, which takes it down to 50-60%, then take out my handmade with 85 round clip and manually scope fire repeatedly to the head.   If it glitches out and I can get another dragon shot off before it actually attacks me, I’ll do that, or possibly pop off a few head shots with my sniper rifle, but once it’s attacking, the hardened handmade with extended clip usually takes it down quick enough I can weather sonic blasts.   I also found that hiding under a bridge will force them to land and they won’t be able to sonic blast you in certain places (I.e. the overpass near thunder mountain power plant), and will just stand in front of bridge while you pump rounds.  I’m only level 37 and I’ve killed 10 Scorchbeasts so far with this method and only died a couple of times when another joined in.  
---
I haven’t put the time in to test the damage of them and how many I’d need.  It’s also cool proof.  No ability to escape damage or destroy and disarm traps.  It’ll work great even if I’m not there to kill.  The annoyance of having relobby is trolly enough for me. Lol
---
Yes, I have it and was able to download the classics 
---
People decided that what they'd seen of the game, looked bad. Then the game came out, and it turned out they were right
---
Damn that's a really good idea for a spot with the water purifier; might have to copy this on my alt...
---
I would but I disconnect from the server too often :/
---
I'm still loving 76 it wasn't meant to be a negative post although it kinda was I guess
---
Basically everyone stands outskde the golfcourse and one person leaves the server and then rejoins. Ever wonder why there are so many mister handys and protectrons in the server? Its cause people spawn in a white springs but the thing here is the robots become permanent in the server till crash and will endlessly respawn. Its not a cheat or glitch, its just how the servers work.
---
Let's do it!
---
There was more specific information in last night's update. Unfortunately, what it clearly implied never materialized.
---
Would it have been better to say nothing? No, and that's not the only other choice they had.
---
Today's non-announcement could have been what they released last night, plain and simple, "we're working on stuff, it's coming soon, no really actually less than a week soon," and that would have been that.
---
&gt; 20 Shoot at it.
---
Doesn't work, it seems to be bugged as all the shots just miss every time unless using Vats or targeting missile launcher.
---
Tested on console with a very, very bad aim.
---
Pizza rolls?
---
actually with laser guns and pipe guns, they seem to count as both pistols and rifles at the same time, regardless of the stock, it's part of the 'meta' for 'pipe death guns' as you can have the pistol and rifleman/comando perks on them at the same time
---
If it helps reduce the chances of getting parasites, I'm game! Haha
---
Unsure that there are plan and mod nodes in the Harper's Ferry church?
---
Off you go. It was cute to try to reddit how mad and unsure I must be, but off you go.
---
Take workshop, spam turrets around workshop until you use the resources from the workshop.
---
Put down stash box and a workbench of some kind if there isn’t already one to scrap junk and excess armour and weapons.
---
Defend workshop.
---
Leave workshop.
---
You have a fast travel point and didn’t waste time or effort building it up like you should be able to.
---
It’s just not worth it if you only have an hour or two as Murphy’s law seems to apply and you get a DC.
---
Occasionally I’ll build a fusion generator and power every resource node there is but I don’t bother locking them and usually never go back.  The powering is just for OCD’s sake (half half as go actual OCD, I have my triggers but that’s not really one...looking at you real life tables and having to walk around them “the right way” and keep trying until it feels right)
---
Ok then yeah that’s very useful. Tbh I wish this is what the Int bonus did.
---
I would say a 1-2 Xbox. Just average Bethesda stuff. 
---
It's useful, because it tells me how many Scorchbeast Queens I've killed
---
Fairly common on console unfortunately, but it's also hard to know if it was something you did vs. something somebody else did on the server.  In my experience bluescreen/app crashes and inventory disconnects tend to be my fault so to speak, but just random crashes or disconnects while wandering around or even just standing there are presumably because of other people stressing the server.
---
On Xbox? I can kill you and won’t steal your loot
---
The server kicks and crashes aren’t near as bad as it was when it came out though. 
---
thank you for a post that contributed nothing to the converstaion /s
---
If you’re shot and don’t fight back it’s not an accepted pvp fight. The ones that result in wanted levels being given. Workshop claims cause a pvp area being active. If you’re wanted then pvp is always on. 
---
Id say.. Hmm.. 3 to a 4 to a 5. Alot of the bugs id say are really not that bad. Not really annoying. Just noticeable.
---
The harsher of the other bugs Ive gotten used to avoiding and it doesnt really dampen my gameplay.
---
The disconnects i find are the most annoying. 
---
Ive found that I collect 2.5 rads when in hazmat and power armor, but in my hazmat alone, I collect &lt;1
---
That'd be kinda funny
---
Too bad I play on console and my computer is a Mac. Oh well...thanks anyways Bethesda. 
---
fair enough...lol
---
Sure but like, I will have collected the majority of plans by the end of January just by casually playing. It's not hard at all. And again, all you're doing is grinding out the same things that FO4 gave us for free. It's not substantial and it won't float the building side of the game for long. :(
---
Compared to the majority of building games, and FO4 itself, camp building in 76 is nowhere near epic. :P   It's fun but actually quite lackluster and the atom shop isn't making it any better.
---
Do you mean Gauss Rifle?
---
Honestly fast travel should cost either prewar money (pay a vertibot for a lift) or just drain your hunger/thirst (cause ya walked there)
---
You can use a TSE weapon for any weapon type, even ones you have no perks in, and still be stronger the best build with a non-TSE weapon.
---
They are god tier weapons but have been duplicated and are so common 
---
Verified thank you again.
---
It was $35 on Amazon while it was $40 everywhere else. But none of the other games I mentioned were discounted at places like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, Target, Gamestop, etc.
---
shhhh the fanoi kiddies will hear you and downvote you for actually remembering what they told us!
---
I'm really hoping marking plans as read is something in this patch. Guess I'll find out Monday!
---
Exactly. Or just that we honestly don’t have a meaningful update for you this week, but expect to have something valuable to share in next week’s blog
---
Equipped items give no benefit in power armor. You’re essentially naked when in power armor 
---
In the thread I make about details I will be adding a way to prevent losing the server we are on for players who have blue screen and disconnect issues. 
---
There is hope that fixing the dupe exploit will also fix frequent server crashes. Dupers do this deliberately so they can do their thing and it makes servers extremely unstable.
---
Yeah, if you equip the Butchers Bounty perk you can get meat from searching the body.
---
Totally. My girlfriend and I were having a discussion about the government's current state of dysfunction, and your comment helps me realize that almost everything is affected by those types of conflicts. I.e. people getting defensive too fast, or playing the blame game. ... people need to realize that in general we are all on the same team and that Simply Having a difference of opinion or passing on a constructive criticism isn't flying in the face of that.
---
I think the name was [Traveling Merchant](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3aqid/is_there_a_deathclaw_traveling_merchant/). I hope it's clever foreshadowing rather than a mistake.
---
There needs to be more endgame. Scorchbeasts are not fun, especially solo, and legendary farming can be broken. I want to love the game  and play more but i feel there's nothing to do *but* explore  and that won't keep me around.
---
I haven't used it much, but I've got it at level 3. My impression is that it's kind of meh. You can't tame robots and send them to your camp the way that you can animals. If you succeed at your check it just turns that robot green and they'll fight on your side if there are other mobs around. Which isn't nothing, but since you have to be right next to the robot to use the ability, it doesn't help a lot if you normally use ranged weapons. Also the switch in allegiance doesn't seem to be permanent. After awhile they'll go back to being hostile, assuming they're still alive.
---
The other major downside is that for many of the robot vendors you'll end up Hacking them when you really want to Trade. To trade you either have to be standing close enough to enable the third option to come up, which is impossible for the robot vendors in train stations, or you have to take the Perk card off. That's an annoying little bug. It might be only on PC; I don't know if the consoles double up on the buttons for those actions in the same way.
---
It'd be nice if you could hack the robot vendors to give you the equivalent of the Hard Bargain perk, but there's nothing like that implemented.
---
That's a good question.  Possibly in workshop mode at the Whitespring.  It has also happened repeatedly near the tennis court (not during a nuke event).  Twice in nuke zones  but I am not often in a nuke zone.  It has happened several times at the spawning place in front of the whitespring. 
---
Mods= cheating in an online game
---
You know that’s a level 37 build with level 47 cards right?
---
I'm not a coder, nor do I claim to understand much about server interactions/management... the post is mainly just to see if anyone else is having similar issues, and to raise awareness that server stability is a continuing issue.
---
Thanks for taking time to add your thoughts!
---
Good to know, since I have the carnivore mutation I can make use of this.
---
You’re not
---
don't worry i already got killed 
---
gaaaha no i don't want them "jamming in more," i want a clear fucking plan on what's going to be included; a feature freeze on code several days before golive; several rounds of thorough testing; and then deployment of solid, stable, tested code into production. 
---
THAT is the lesson that should have been learned from their first patch.
---
I'm not really sure, probably around lv 90?
---
As a rifle main, sadly yes :(. 
---
There’s legendary rolling pins but not a single legendary hunting rifle. Makes my head spin.
---
True but if the object you are using to build into the ground was a hollow box with walls (5 sided cube or an open box) only accessible from the top it wouldn’t allow anyone to clip out of the world.
---
thanks though
---
We should at least get fallout 3 and Nv with dlc or something for free 
---
There is some way to buff your damage to holy hell so that you can oneshot people who haven't consented to PvP.
---
Honestly i prefer the bethesda version
---
Saved for further reading 
---
I doubt you need a powerful PC to play them, I'm gonna try playing on my cheap laptop.
---
thx, whats your platform?
---
Don't even need to be hardcore, I usually am ravenous with Fallout games but I've had to \*force\* myself to play casually so I don't burn through what's there in a month. xD
---
I think their top content priorities should be endgame PVE and expanding building (mainly with more budget and more decor). To me, those two things will be the player retention pillars once exploration has lost its initial appeal. They should abandon PVP entirely, it's just shit and requires way too much effort and I bet most PVPers have zero interest in this game anyway. Quests and events are great, but those should be supplemental to endgame/building, certainly not ahead in the content pipeline.
---
Hmm, interesting. Thanks for the input. I think I’ll probably prefer the AA just because I usually stay at least half health. 
---
All they're asking for would be sliders to do the color mods. Then save the ones that look good and make those the alternatives. Pretty easy to do in 3d. 
---
Very old games.  Can easily run on modern day PCs without a graphic card.
---
Id like to see a video of that, since a shotgun is wildly inaccurate at even med range, and with a beast flying and swerving so often hitting it is difficult with most weapons. 
---
Tell that to my characters that have been stuck in Power Armor after they "fixed" the bug.
---
You cannot "tame" with it. It doesnt work well in the few situations you enounter many bots because, without spoiling anything, one of those situations resolves itself and the spawn in the other makes it impractical. Also, for some reason, it procs whenever I try to trade with a vendor bot. Sadly, not worth taking.
---
that was more of an Outside the Vault type of message. 
---
Plans: Bob Ross tutorial. 
---
now you can paint your happy little power armor. 
---
My Zealot's Combat Rifle on full auto will VATS-crit kill a level 50 in 3 or 4 magazines. I also have TSE and I don't bother with it as it takes longer. (TSE is much less accurate in VATS.)
---
That's one thing I was not sure about and I played my Sniper in BETA and a week afterwards. I noticed a lot of buggy things with Stealth and I had a lot of photos of my character standing beside a scorchbeast like it was that Disney cartoon about the dragon and the Vikings :)
---
Try deleting your fallout76prefs.ini file, then loading the game in.  I had issues with such things and this was a fix recommended to me that fixed it in short order.  If that doesn't work you might try doing a scan and repair through the Bethesda launcher.
---
Yeah, for sure.
---
But they could make pre build empty basements walls and floors included that could just be placed at ground level snapping into place and deleting the dirt .
---
Because you said you were attempting to craft it when that isn't needed with store bought mods. The scrapping problem happens if the mod is stored in your stash since it also pulls resources from your stash. 
---
I'm quite sure your mod didn't change and you attached the Motion-Assist servos earlier and forgot about or didn't realize it. Otherwise this is the first time I've ever heard of such a bug.
---
try this https://www.enclavedb.net/nuke-codes
---
Where do I find cat painting plans! Also, this is amazing. 
---
Yeah that's what I'm thinking.  I don't know what they mean by "sub layer".  They clearly are using assets from fo4 which had vault building so there's hope for the future IMHO.
---
Absolutely, if not more than that. Limited time offer. 
---
It doesn't fucking mean he has to handle social media personally. 
---
Hey Pete drop everything you're doing in the entire company to run our Twitter account. 
---
Oh that's right, the stacking... and combine that with duping... yeah. I forgot that one :(
---
truth. and there is no 100% right way for everyone.  i dont want my neighbor to decide what i eat for dinner. but as a community i understand we should all keep our yards reasonably nice.  but if someone puts a lot of work into something and you think its a steaming pile their emotions (understandably) take over.  need more 'let me help you with that' and less blame.  but then again sometimes u cant help when someone doesn't agree/admit there is an issue.     whole world is functionally dysfunctional...your end game is to figure out how to be happy in it :)  and if you doing you can make it better for even one other then you're doing well!
---
Thanks dude 
---
PC, maybe a 2.  I've only crashed twice over a couple hundred hours played.  The only annoying recurring bug for me is the disappearing quest markers.  There have a been a few funny visual bugs like the longdogs and stretchy ghouls.
---
I wouldn't consider performance issues as bugs, but they are far more rampant (lagging, rubber-banding, stuttering, delayed loading, etc), and if included would push the score up to a 4 or 5.
---
I imagine so! Still farming the **80 springs** needed for the two legs on level 35 Excavator since up until know I've been running around with an ugly mix of T-45 and T-51 pieces and I got annoyed.
---
Have you ever worked on an automation framework for a video game? Do you have specified knowledge as to this particular field of coding? There are clearly factors that severely limit the ability to automate tests.
---
Some combination of unit tests being often impossible and game automation being front end automation.
---
You would never want to cover an entire piece of software with selenium tests and I have to imagine these guys don't want to deal with the equivalent in their game engines for all the same reasons. Maintainability, the need to build custom frameworks, **the value for the cost**.
---
Could we get this pinned please?  Great, new, uncommon information!
---
you’re welcome. very good website i recommend it over crypt tbh 
---
This is obviously an urgent issue that needs to be fixed before I have a hissy fit and pout for a whole FIVE minutes!
---
The Mountain deposit site (where most farm mutations) has a PA spawn in the structure  that has lvl 50 T-60 in the loot table.
---
This is a really ironic comment. Lol
---
People are underestimating the effectiveness of armor mods. The Dense torso mod negates close to 100% of Sonic blast damage. It may also help in other areas of the game where everyone has an explosive shotgun. I've only gotten to face off against an explosive automatic rifle PVPer and it was an even fight.
---
Speaking of automatic weapons, a VATS critical will land all of your successive shots on a flying scorchbeast until your AP runs out. It will also refill your critical meter to maximum. So I just wait for my AP to regenerate to full and continue with my VATS 100% accuracy shenanigans.
---
That may be true; it's hard to say what modifications were made to the engine for multiplayer.
---
I am certain that logs exist though, even if tools to easily parse those logs do not yet exist. It should be childsplay to catch some of the worst offenders - if they bother trying. I hope they do, as some individuals have enough items to permanently destabilize the games economy. 
---
Yeah, one SB to defend against would be irritating, but doable. THREE of them and at level 80? Nah, fuck that. I'm leaving.
---
By my own experience, 3ish at best. Maybe I've jusr been lucky. I've seen nothing gamebreaking or lasting. But there are other, confirmed, bad bugs, so overall, I'd say 5, if I am to believe bugs that I haven't seen myself.
---
Bad... bad never changes.
---
I think it’s possible especially if the object is prebuilt with walls
---
What else is there to do in the game besides grind for drops and rare plans bro? That is the end game. Getting the gear to perfect your build. 
---
And when you go grind a whitesprings nuke and can't get any loot or xp bc everyone around you kills everything before you can do anything. You'll understand. To be honest, I think you have this game confused with a different game. Because what you want out of it isn't what fallout is offering. This is a rng based grind game dude. It's go kill 1,000 legendary enemies to get that one perfect drop. Maybe. I'm not sure what you're expecting for the end game, but it's not what you're gonna get. 
---
If an outfit has a guaranteed spawn location I just give outfits away. I can always go get another slave collar or tinfoil hat, especially ritual bindings those are real popular
---
One week which included a major holiday.
---
not what i meant
---
I think that too. But I won’t say that because the abusive reply you get isn’t worth it. They all swear up and down they have the very best of everything, and every other game runs amazing for them flawlessly.
---
Can’t believe you checked there. Please don’t leave stuff in registers lol
---
You have a point. Never used PA myself, so I completely forgot that. I only craft ammo and serums basically
---
They should make a weapon called hoarders delight that does more damage when encumbered
---
Hype train? Given the current state of the game we are all expecting a mega patch 5o address some very serious issues.
---
* Duping
---
* Explosive bobble heads stacking, people one shotting the queen so she drops no loot.
---
* Water purifier bug.  I still can't perfect my camp as I have budget I can't free up.  This is game breaking.
---
* Server disconnects on claiming workshops 
---
* Game crashing when viewing stash inventory.  Game crashing in general.
---
* Game crashing when accepting a game invite.
---
* Inventory disappearing when doing feed the people.
---
* Bugged quests.  Enemies spawning under ground on defense.  Messenger getting stuck on pathfinding.  Horde mode not activating or the end boss isn't tracked properly.
---
* Nuke zone crashing.  Bodies disappearing when trying to loot, loot not appearing when server gets too many requests.  Said loot meat piles appear 20 minutes later with nothing in them.  Legendaries not dropping star loot to their level.
---
* Overseer's quest bugged and won't complete.
---
* Scrapping high end mods to fix stuff.
---
* Broken modifiers in stats.  
---
These aren't features that could be hyped up.  These are game breaking bugs that will kill off the community if not addressed in a timely and detailed manner.
---
* What fixes are we getting on Mondays patch and what ones are for future updates?
---
* Where is the roadmap for development and features that are upcoming?
---
* Where are the dev blogs detailing the challenges of these fixes? It would silence those who don't understand the reasoning of what could be a simple fix.  Explaining the challenge buys patience with the consumer.
---
At the moment I've seen copy pasted crypto coins with better communication than Bethesda.  It's a live service.  Communication is Paramount.  When I read the inside the vault first paragraph I knew the rest was filler and more promises of future fixes dangling like a proverbial carrot on a stick.  We need better ways of getting messages accross.  
---
If they said no update for 3 weeks but had a detailed dev blog about new features/ challenges of bug fixes.  I'd happily take it and wait for it.  Being so vague about everything is only going to lead to guesswork, speculation and impatient fans.
---
I have 400 hours in this game.  I love it.  However in finding it more challenging every day to log in with the amount of issues.  
---
Yup, that's exactly what's happening, when a 'new player' enters the area, by any means, it respawns the enemies for that area, this is to keep it so players don't go to location x and just, have no enemies or anything there
---
The last one was a tease too.  This was supposed to have some meat on it.  Instead they're just kicking the can down the road again.
---
I agree it's lame, that's why I have an anti-armor explosive shotgun instead
---
True. I just found those last night, too.
---
Ah damn it, I messed up EA’s infamous ‘pride and accomplishment’ line. Using that was what I was apologising for. :) 
---
Also check the white springs ice box for some legendaries. It’s outside the clubhouse where everyone farms ghouls at the bottom. 
---
I found some that others considered trash but that I was looking for. 
---
Hey, there are gineric 'Token' items in game that don't have any use/value, would be nice to give them an actual use
---
That's not how juke boxes work bud.
---
Great another update updating us about an upcoming update.
---
I would be entirely happy if they made the explosive effect NOT scale with demolition expert. That alone is such an overpowered combo
---
Lol whatever. What about people that saw the same stuff and liked it and it turned out they were right?
---
It’s always defend the opinions of people who hate the game. But when people have the opinion they like the game, they are wrong.
---
P A C I F I S T  M O D E. 
---
I’m selling one for 600 caps if you’re interested 
---
Soon I'll have as many copies of that plan as I have copies of Fallout 1, 2, and Tactics...
---
A lot of the problems are based on the age of the engine and the fact it was never designed to be used in a multiplayer game. While some issues will be resolvable it's highly unlikely Bethesda have the capability to fix a lot of the problems.
---
Yup, and the update we get is that next time we won't really get any info about the new content... coolcoolcool
---
sadly this is a very West Virginian response.  100 year flood my eye!
---
Any of the jukes around me have had a feature where you could pay to skip. Admittedly they’re newer and they’re based on a phone app. 
---
Bethesda set stash limits for server stability. So a person with 1,000 guns, 1,000 pieces of armor, hundreds of thousands of junk items etc etc has to be kept up with by the server along with all the world loot and all the other players on the server. If you don't think that affects stability in the server in general. You're crazy. 
---
Yes! Dense mods + Ironclad 5* is amazing for a non PA build. Nice post. If you feel like elaborating on your build definitely post another comment reply to the OP. A lot of people are saying that they don't run PA and I'm sure it would help them out!
---
Thank you for posting.
---
Explains why my finds are shit if that is so. 
---
Diablo  and ebay paid for about 25% of my college.  To each his own, at least he's not out breaking into cars or homes.    
---
I saved it Already :)
---
They anounced that there would be 2 notable updates this month.  They anounced what's going on with the 'entitlements' with the classic pack of games.  They noted that the next update posted about new content will be very, very close to that new content going live.  They anounced that we can expect the first notable patch of the month on monday, and what sorts of things to expect with the patch.
---
Would you rather they not say anything at all?
---
I don’t wreck other peoples CAMPs, period. Nothing good comes out of it anyways.
---
Telling other people to destroy CAMPs just aggravates me and makes me hate the community side of this game.
---
So a few different pre-built models? This would be easier but there might be restrictions on placement.
---
Okay, I'm getting the picture... The robots are spawned in the same fashion as the ghouls. So it's not so much that someone is spawning the ghouls, it's that it also force-spawns a new batch of robot guards. Bodies of the ghouls go away since they are dead, but the robots...
---
Huh. Thank you kind person!
---
Take over workshops
---
Nice write up, thanks!
---
Literally unplayable. 
---
Restarted last night, I love my other character but she's too focussed on crafting and a lot of my perk choices are shitty, and for the combat styles available she doesnxt have good SPECIAL stats.  Started fresh last night with some friends and going for a tank build I made that seems fun, just gotta find a heavy gun and transfer some of my 40+ fusion cores over to my new character for her power armor.  Definitely not getting rid of my first character though.
---
That is very kind. Thank you for the recommendation.
---
even another 200 would seriously go a long way rn.
---
Wish they made it so you can't build in a nuke zone.
---
Well almost everything is mutated so anything that increases damage does the same thing.
---
I thought mutant just increased weapon damage if YOU are mutated.
---
I wish it was able to turn them inside out. I was trying for a concrete white house feel but didnt work out.
---
Ahhhh. I thought they were like Nuka cola and only one time use. 
---
&gt; Meet new people, and \*don't\* grief them 
---
Posting in another "all pvp is grief" post. 
---
Instead of blaming the Reddit community I would blame the ones that use turrets. Reddit isn't the only social platform that is calling for blood.  Also, anyone who actually experienced an empty club house due to turrets may take action on their own.  I agree that turret less camps should be spared, but you're misplacing the blame.
---
Good to know they fixed this one.
---
At most 16
---
a while ago i saw someone on another thread saying that if you move your camp and then relog or something the sloth will disappear, or if it dies on its way to your camp. i dont remember what it was but it had something to do with moving your camp, i might’ve just found the thread on google so maybe try that?
---
When you have to have the best ... yesterday! 
---
Sadly, pixels sell. 
---
How did you build something so big within the budget? I have a little 3x2 one-story house, some generators, water purifiers, and handful of turrets and I'm maxed out.
---
ah the ol' dodgeroo
---
I seem have a nice day
---
I’d rather they not lie like they did yesterday. 
---
Yup, the robots have an auto spawned that spawns a new one when ome goes missing. Watoga doesnt have this issue since those robots only spawn when there are players nearby and they spawn from those robo spawners. If you ever get a daily mission to kill 10 robots, you can actually kill the white springs robots for this challenege to be completed as well!
---
Thank you for taking the time to read it. A lot of other helpful tips and tricks are in other comment replies. A lot of good questions that we are discussing today.
---
Well frogs are non combat
---
Fallout and fallout 2 were only made for pc. You think they’re gonna port both to console so you can get free stuff conveniently?! Cmon man
---
I love how there are so many thinga you can learn from games that apply to real life and vice versa. Keep up the good fight.
---
uhh i'm on pc, can i call dibs? haha
---
I'd like this but I'd also like some extra options for buildings in general. Where are the cornered pieces?! I don't care TOO much about painting walls but something, anything to differentiate mine from other's CAMPs would be nice.
---
Simple fix, just add a rocket powered mod for throwing knives.
---
It’s not a tease. Rather than waiting until they can promise specifics they are regularly communicating. 
---
They are doing this Because it was angrily, if not unreasonably demanded by the community. I can not fault them for being vague because if they promise and legitimately can’t deliver someone’s childhood could be ruined forever. 
---
Think of the childpeople!
---
This is what I remember.
---
Also, https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/172320/where-did-the-word-proc-originate/172323#172323
---
I am still early build and I like having the challenge. I received the TSE dragon from someone as a gift and it does 1100 damage for me but I can only use it like 4 times before breaking. That’s perfect to me since I can help out with monsters but I have to be smart about it. 
---
A lot of people work full time jobs and don’t have time to sink 100s of hours into a game I guess this is their way of getting end game stuff to keep up with those that have a lot of time on their hands I guess I’m one of those people that if I want it bad enough I’ll just buy it with real money 
---
Fair enough. I forgot about and don't see how people will die to slap damage considering how low it is, but I guess it is possible.
---
2 to a 3.  Literally the only thing that frustrates me is when a server gets bogged down and i can't get into my stations or inventory.  That's the only thing that makes me rage quit.  Everything else is just as buggy as Fo4 and I can live with that.
---
I have not tried this. It could be rubbish.
---
There was a post stating use one of the perks to get it to your house and the other when it behaves the first time.
---
I don't have them so I have not been able to test it.
---
i had been hoarding springs, screws, gears and adhesive since level 1! i didnt know why i needed it, i just knew that i needed it, lol. All i ended up being short of for my excavator armor was titanium, lol. I should probably build up a level appropriate set since i'm almost 50 now though. I have a full set of Lvl 45 Raider though so i think i'll main that until i come across something better
---
They have actually commented on duper’s?
---
Do you have a link?
---
All I’ve seen is patch notes claiming to have fixed duping exploits...nothing about not being able to ban said dupers
---
There's two types mutants and mutant Slayer, 
---
I had fine connectivity, I mostly quit playing because there’s no more content. 4x map of FO4 with .25x the content
---
Yeah once inside all the walls would have clipping like current missile silos.  I just hope you don't have to zone in to it.. that would spoil it for me.
---
I assume toy didn't look at the photos of them exploiting, eh? Causing lag in the area isn't cool no matter what. Sure destroying bases is a dick move, but causing other players to lag with 30-40 turrets is worse. 
---
As a heavy gunner myself I use a two-shot with no other effects. I can get it to a comfortable 115 damage and mow through basically anything I need to. But if I could CHOOSE any kind of effect, I’d have to say furious. The 10-15% bonus damage per shot racks up so insanely fast on tanky enemies that you only need to plant like 4-5 shots on an enemy before you’ve surpassed the damage of two-shot, and it goes higher than that
---
I've fallen in love with "Nailed It" and I really hope they keep making more
---
Oh i hope they do too, it's really a detriment to me coming back to the game long term. I've seen the pics of people trading with others that have tens of thousands of rare mats and caps and such. *Those* should be easy to find, if they've made adjustments to their engine. It's the more conservative dupers that seem hard to find. 
---
How do you differentiate between people who legitimately farmed mats for days and those who duped? If they have logs ( seems unlikely to me, having played around with fo4 and Skyrim creation kits) they could find them. Let's hope they planned that far in advanced or even do so quickly now.
---
I have worked on automation framework and devops. If they don’t want to maintain a robust regression suite then they get to bear the brunt of bug ridden software. But I wouldn’t expect customers to come to their defence for the bugs because those customers are the ones that the company has decided are the cost that is not valuable.
---
Wait until you start farming whitesprings then find out that nobody gets exp or loot because someone set up a turret that shoots through the window of the clubhouse.
---
Nah, i solo'd it at level 50 with a super sledge and a regular handmade. Just take your time and you can do it. I will say it took about 900 rounds of 5.56 and a full repair on my hammer. The turrets are the worst. Assaultrons suck too. Actually the whole experience kinda sucks. Lol but it is still doable. You got it. Oh bring stim packs. At least 15. Power armour helps too. 
---
Someone had a fight club type group going at one time.  Not sure of the status of that group now.
---
just encountered this as well.
---
Literally just fast travel, that’s all it takes
---
I tag them enough that they regenerate health then lead them to other players or use an emote so they come to me while I just dodge
---
Or let me scrap them. Honestly I don't even bother looting them half the time if I'm not going to use it
---
The game has major problems and I still play it almost daily.  There is a great game under all the nonsense and I hope we get there soon.
---
They should err on the side of more communication, not less at this point.  That's just my $0.02.
---
I made my character modular.   I can swap out perk cards and change play styles.   I originally ran rifles plus sneak.   Tried a crit-friendly build.   Then tried melee plus shotgun.   Then PA plus heavy.  And am now saving up perk points to try bloodied-nerd rage-emergency protocols.   This lets me change how I play based on mood—although I am less effective than a dedicated build because my SPECIAL points are spread out.    All things considered, after trying out each style sniping is the most fun when exploring and melee/shotgun+enforcer is the most effective for dedicated fighting (such as nuke zones).  
---
I'm guessing the ammo one would be the best
---
Honestly with the Armor Piercing it depends on the enemy and weapon in question, AP The Dragon does work, as you use it on stronger enemies that would either halve, or more, damage due to armor, so that 50% armor pen means your doing more net damage than a 2shot would against that same enemy (namely the queen), but yeah I get what your saying.
---
Sounds like a future money grab for the Atom Shop.
---
Bold of you to assume I’ll farm Whitesprings.
---
Oh that's sounds neat I might have to try and find it 
---
how could you connect a foundation floor with a ceiling floor?
---
Yeah I agree.  I think overall we need an increase to baseline projectile damage and then a nerf of these two legendary effects.  They are exponentially better than all other legendary damage output.  Two shot is basically your weapon does 100% more damage.  Why even bother with 30% more damage to a specific enemy or something like executioner.  
---
Got some folks that also setup shops at the back of the golf course.
---
To each their own, but I found it very repetitive once the quests dropped off. Sure, there is more I have not done as far as exploring and trying different builds, but it did strike me once I completed the main and side quests how little there is to do. Now, I just log in to check the vendors, check for specific events and maybe farm some legendaries. Nukes get old after you see the same 2 spots get hit over and over. The events get repetitive after you've done them all 4-5 times. You can solo everything except the Queen. I want more content. 
---
I know it's still early and there is more content coming, but it really feels like they didn't do enough planning for what you can do once you get past level 50. I expected to be nuking different areas for different bosses and having more, tougher baddies to go after. 
---
If they didn't even have that info and were awaiting a response by the dev team/build manager for what kinds of things to expect they didn't lie, now did they?
---
Crafting builds...
---
If your on the PS4 how do you get it?
---
Also helpful to dump junk as soon as someone tries to PVP. Or for after you kill them once in defense and grab their stuff. Many times someone’s killed me and kept staring at my body to find their stuff which I had quickly deposited in my nearby stash.
---
While you're right that my post was unfair towards [falloutmaps.com](https://falloutmaps.com), the point was mostly intended against you. Their resource is okay, but clearly lacking verification, and also not complete, in addition for whatever reason it seemed to have omitted places that very quickly referenced in this post that hasn't been up for very long at all.   
---
I claim no responsibility for the content here, it is a collection of information that I'm merely collating from other redditors who are both interested in the content, and contributing to the content (Kinda the point of reddit). My reason for being so cavalier in my response to you is because you heavily implied that all this work had already been done more than adequately by another party, and yet, upon cursory review it became extremely obvious that while others had tried (And did a pretty good job with regards to many things other than plans), the work they did was clearly not exhaustive, has many errors, and there's still plenty of room for a thread like this contrary to your original post, and the suggestion that this was unnecessary because of the existence of the reference that I am essentially claiming is 'decent' but not good enough to render this post meaningless.  
---
Ultimately, again, I would benefit from more tact, but still I don't really feel I'm too far out of line all things considered. 
---
A game mechanic with good intent, just poor execution...  but a game mechanic none the less. hm.  
---
Thank you :)  
---
Whenever that dlc is released.  Free dlc is not worth it when the game has many breaking bugs.
---
Nice reference!
---
I still say "mobs" a lot after the older game term for "mobiles" ~ NPCs. I don't think a lot of the MMO type terms like CC (crowd control), etc, really apply in Fallout 76.
---
Better idea:
---
Server hop and save your time and resources.
---
You're in a Whitsprings themed thread. Its in the title. 
---
I already moved the camp, but the pet moved too. 
---
Very nice CAMP!
---
Ahh right
---
Mutant slayer is like exterminators, troubleshooting , ghoul killer.
---
It’s for one specific enemy type.  In this case super mutants.
---
There would have to be a separate effect that does increase damages to ALL mutants, including mutated players...so pretty much only robots wouldn’t be affected...and cats 
---
[Enclave Remnant](https://i.ibb.co/4Tq53KT/Enc-remnant.png)

I wish i could just try the game for free for a few hours, the concept and all these stories sound great. but if it runs and looks like shit I just can't do it. Cool camp though!
---
Yeah, old school juke boxes didn't want to 'cheat' a customer out of something they paid for to make more money like the modern day ones do.  Modern Day juke boxes are about as 'pay to win' as they come and the only one that truly wins is the person who makes money off the damn thing
---
Yeah but would add an additional option instead of “building up towards the sky”
---
Btw.. don't buy stuff!   
---
Go enjoy the world and craft everything and make your own items :)
---
How do you use the supports?  I have tried to use them several times and they never seem to work for me.
---
Someone gave me a furious TSE silenced 10mm 
---
I’m excited to use it as a sneak build but we’ll see what happens. 
---
I have a below minimum requirements graphics card and everything else up to recommended spec and run the game on the second highest graphics setting and rarely have issues.
---
My internet is also only the second tier my provider offers.
---
Do you play on PC? Also “true” mods lower shotgun spread and increase range significantly. 
---
It's meant to be out in 2 days, they must have *something* specific to list. Other than their plans to be less-communicative about upcoming content...
---
I've suggested once before:  Make Explosive have a significantly reduced effect (either fixed damage, or a smallish percentage of the weapon's total damage), make the explosive damage not affected by Explosives Expert (if it currently is), and change Two Shot so the second shot doesn't get the benefits of any other legendary affixes.
---
I'm thinking that would make TSE much less overpowered, but still damn good.
---
Lol 
---
But you used the word shelter in your post.
---
Oh, I am for the idea. I just can see why it would be difficult to implement if ever.
---
This is a game changer.... I can redo so much art for this.
---
PC.  '76 has the most hacked BS combat mechanic I've ever seen in any game online or not.  Half your hits (bullets or melee) pass right through mobs standing 1 foot in front of you.  @ lvl 30, it still often takes 4 hits to kill a lvl 5 ghoul. 
---
VATS is good for the first hit but then is worthless.
---
I don't know if it's the ridiculous server communication or what, but just jump back into Fallout 4 to see what the combat is *supposed* to be like.
---
You should have put up a poll. 
---
I would say 3 at the highest. And none of the bugs are game breaking. 
---
Well seeing as there will be a few of my group members on to help maintain order and prevent grief issues. That would probably be close to a preferable number. The max people that we would probably be able to have would be 18-20ish. Anymore and I would have to break it over multiple servers. 
---
Absolutely agree on this.  And once they add storage options other than personal stashes (ONE CAN HOPE) this will help tremendously with players showing off CAMPs.  Or is it CAMPS? CAMPs.
---
You've changed my mind with your well thought out and intelligence rebuttal, I've seen the error of my ways. My apologies.
---
They do work... for Workshops. I use them at any Workshops I claim so that my fast travel point isn't way outside where any action is happening, in case of defense events or whatever else.
---
I did also blueprint it since the recipe likes to randomly not show up.
---
Duplication glitches I believe.
---
The bulk of the stuff they sell on those sites is duped through exploits in the game. If you just play, it all comes to you in it,e and makes the game much more fun.
---
What a great idea to use some of that prewar money we find laying around. They should change vending machines to use that as a currency. 
---
Wait, they were available during Beta? And I could have been able to keep it post launch? Well fuck. I couldn't even build a camp during beta thanks to the game thinking everything was floating.
---
i've just read a bunch of times on here that they dont have the ability to track duped items because of the limitations of the engine and how it handles items. they can read stash and inventory values but items dont have UIDs so they cant tell whats been copied and whats unique.
---
that sounds soooo SPICY...🌶
---
So furious would still win even if I have anti-armor and ***stabilized?
---
Nice picture. There are very few places with the number/quality of mobs that make it worth popping atoms.
---
Or an atom shop but you use in game caps and trade with players/auction items
---
This is false, showers do not remove mutations with Starched Genes. I have confirmed this hundreds of times while fishing for mutations.
---
It could be another cell like silos or caves which require a loading screen.  Might even be less stressful for the server.
---
However many gameplay issues like enemies not being able to attack.  Other players not being able get it, etc.
---
That'd be sweet 👍  but yeah you can play them just fine on any shitty computer/laptop so long ad it isn't a commadore 64
---
There's a spot due East of Black Bear Lodge that has a lead deposit and junk pile just in reach of each other.

If you move there, say hi to the Anglers for me.  They will be partying in your camp day and night.

Yeah, once you learn the recipe, you can craft the serums over and over

Get a decent bounty. Pvp will find you.

Bethesda should make an invincible Cthulhu type monster that only exists out of bounds and it hunts players that clip through walls.

I always imagined that the space you enter when you wall clip is “the upside down”

I'm finding TSE western revolver just as capable at killing ghouls as my TSE shotgun, with an additional perk of being sustainable ammo-wise and not blowing up half of the map, yourself included, each shot
---
Where is the dmg calculations for that please?
---
2 on PS4.  I've played over 100 hours and have had a couple disconnects and some visual glitches.  Nothing too big.

Telephones and hot plates.
---
Get a 10 cap bounty. People will hunt you down to hunt you.
---
I’ve used anti-armor with stabilized and it lets you annihilate high-armor enemies but if you want a ton of damage, Furious stacks are the way to go. Also I’m pretty sure the furious effect works between enemies too so you can get the damage up and keep firing. I used to have a Furious minigun at level 30 and it was pretty fun 
---
TSE on all/any weapon is really, really lame.  There's been so much complaining about this but I've never seen or heard Bethesda acknowledge if they agree or are planning a fix.
---
They need to communicate more.  Most players realize it's stupid and needs a really hard hit w/the nerf bat, but if they do this unannounced in some future patch (as I expect), we will all be drowning in tears from the 1000s of kids sporting those duped TSE weapons...
---
 ...oh so much QQ will be heard on that glorious day...
---
couple of my friends who play this game every day still do not use reddit at all.  Those updates are actually pretty cool for them.
---
Saved as well...thank you!
---
Interesting.  Considering the importance of whitespring here's hoping 'the enclave' or what not installs those robo-spawners and limits the robots through an already established in game mechanic.
---
I love the idea, but It may open the gates for getting out of the map easier.   
---
I don't pvp, so it would be worth it for me.   
---
Around the flower beds at front entrance (all the way out towards the train station) there are enough red asters to make two things of crimson flux. It's tough because there are also the normal red flowers that don't do anything, but look at the very tip of the plantings towards the road.
---
Same general area, you can get enough cobalt flux from the blue sap on the trees, plus the silt beans if you curve along the north side, both out towards the super mutant shack at the waste disposal site, and just inside where the first cabin starts. Both are easy to spot as they glow neon blue/neon green.
---
Try searching amusement parks for toy cars/trucks. There's also a wheelbarrow full of handcuffs behind the Abandoned Bog Town police office.
---
[it’s from fallout 4 but I’m pretty sure it works the same in 76](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_weapon_effects) 
---
Changes have come, and they are saying more are coming and gave us dates -- I don't think they can do much else.   They can't be specific about what exploits they're fixing because they don't want to announce that certain exploits exist.
---
Well what I mean by free is. if you have a big metal base and or wood base and it gets destroyed it would be cheaper to move it a couple feet for caps then it would for the mats. so free =mats. the cost varies from person to person as well. it costed me 100 caps because I moved it a bunch on one server. should be cheaper though for everyone else.
---
I don't even bother with VATS now that it doesn't stop time which basically reduces it to a gimmick that would be useless if not for the occasional time hit detection/latency goes to shit and the fact they took out non-VATS crits just to keep it relevant. 
---
So it doesn't really affect the way I play with a non-crit/VATS build. When (if) they actually land it'll barely take a good 3 seconds to down a standard one in less than half a mag from a TSE Handmade though.
---
I used to do this on existing bridges. Everything was open for everyone to use. I set up at the bridge by the dry lake and Lakeside Cabins a lot as it has a fair amount of traffic from newer players. 
---
I hear you - I've been playing a lot lately (rank 24) and put a lot of time in. Then I go online and see things can be bought instantly basically . 
---
I really think the classical had to be a placeholder.  I mean, why classical!  Why!
---
Don't forget the other cult based faction.  The one full of people who hate the game but feel forced to play it and point out every flaw.  They have a duplicating note glitch here on Reddit and holotapes all over the tubes.
---
Why not another location like the water park up north? That way it’s still fun without the random legendary ghouls wiping the floor with low level participants. 
---
Keep in mind that you can travel for free to both your camp and to Vault 76, so later in the game, you might want to put your camp down in the lower area of the map so you can fast-travel to more areas for fewer caps.
---
I plopped mine down directly south of Watoga.  It's nice because the Prime Fissure is nearby and it gets nuked pretty regularly for the Scorchbeast Queen.  It's close enough to do quick nuke runs then resupply or recover, but it's not close enough to be within the blast zone.
---
My C.A.M.P. has been getting bumped a lot lately on login, so I think people are catching on to the location :(
---
Fricken loved Nailed It.  Even did a few of the challenges with them over new years. (Yeah, my daughter and I decided baking wasn't in our future lol).
---
Zumbo's Just Desserts was good too. Inspired us to plana trip to an old timey candy shop this coming weekend.
---
Looks like those beams are just for show.  You see the stairs heading up from the foundation in the river. That appears to be what is actually holding up those upper floors.
---
Sugar Grove has a bunch of clipboards and desk fans
---
I noticed something that said duplication stuff was resolved in Nov 18 I think? Does this mean that early on when the game was released people just spent hours duplicating all these items? Or are there still glitches that ppl are using? 
---
I completely agree with your sentiments. The fact that Bethesda will sell outfits from vanilla Fallout 4 for such a price is insulting to the consumer. The post man outfit is $7 or higher I believe. I wouldnt be surprised if the cage or spike armor would be a higher price if it is going to be released in the Atomic Shop. 
---
go off 😩💅
---
But for gameplay they need to be on par with rifles and shotguns.  If you dedicate an entire build to min maxing pistol perks, they should be on par with other weapons.
---
I get what you're saying though.  Pistols are sidearms and inherently worse than rifles etc.  But with that logic, missile launchers and energy weapons should be better than rifles and shotguns, but they are not.  Infact the missile launcher is pretty much unless in 76.
---
Crap I did, didn’t even realize it and was still trying to avoid it.
---
If someone is good enough to nuke Whitesprings a touch to the right, you can get even more cobalt from the area around the mine.
---
Remove the butchers nails...  Oh and have a snickers.  :)
---
You sir are one of the few team players. Thank you.
---
Oh and how about being able to build as much as we want within our circle?
---
Wait.. you can have a deathclaw pet?
---
That’s awesome, thanks for your input. How many caps would something like that sell for realistically? 
---
Yeah and the switch doesn’t even work
---
Also, having the perk that doubles your plant harvest helps.
---
ok cool, I tried to take a few photos around there, but ended up going much close to the workshop. But you right as long as it works. 
---
To help with crops being ruined. Place them inside on top of a campfire
---
Great suggestion, more armor pen would make them a lot more viable and not too OP.
---
I tried to get back into FO76 the other day. I was working on a mission right when I logged in. About 10 minutes in, I got dropped. I went back in and had to re-do my progress and get back to where I was. Then, the game crashed. I had to re-do my progress again, and then I DC'd again. I just gave up at that point.
---
I got a "You have been invited to a Halloween Party!"... Delivered to the flatwoods funeral home.  
---
That's where I found colonel's notes... screw you for making me cry mr. messenger.
---
Have you looked into the immovable object meta build? Sentinel armor (with assassins on if you choose) and dodgy and some other persk and you become a walking fortification. 
---
That's exactly what I was thinking. There are games like Star Wars:KoTR so why not fallout 1 &amp; 2. Devs need to get on this. 
---
How do they prove they provided the digital items? 
---
I think it’s all after the last patch. I searched YT just after commenting, there’s loads of dupe vids that are only 1/2 weeks old. 
---
I've tried to be positive about the game in general. I've played daily since beta. But things are starting to feel weird. It's like the Devs &amp; Communication team are all high school interns who've never worked on or developed a game before. Kind of stumbling around following an outline, ok we have A, B &amp; C, the game is done! And now they are bewildered why players are unhappy. I haven't seen any articles about talent turnover at Bethesda but something feels off.
---
I guess I’ll have to buy more Bethesda point$
---
I remember that there is a spreadsheet out there somewhere that list all outfits you can get from events, I dont have the link though sadly
---
Still here waiting for a paintjob for a gun that is actually relevant 
---
I have about 200hrs in the game as of this point myself, so I understand the frustration.  But they did note that they are looking to fix exploits with the patch on monday that likely includes the one shotting the queen and the duping, the later of which causes stability issues that could be what's causing alot of the other issues you mentioned (server d/c, the stash inventory stuff as that's a server query, and a few other things along those lines) Overseer's Quest likely isn't completable as I think it'll be used to tie in the dlc locations/vaults that will open up, which would make sense and give a kind of 'cohesion' to things imo.
---
They listed what types of fixes to expect, but I don't think that they have a conclusive list, a weekish in advance, of a patch, and I've the feeling they are still plugging away to include as many fixes as they can in that patch on monday.  Personally I'm just glad they are saying 'hey, this is what to expect, but we won't get into exacts as this moment' as it means if that changes there won't be back lash.  For Example, if they said they were gonna fix the Strange in Numbers perk card bug, where it just removes all positive mutation effects when equiped, and when doing so broke something else that's much more critical (like Class Freak or Startched Genes) and as a result undid that change before the patch went live, then people would be upset that it wasn't fixed without thinking about the why it wasn't fixed.
---
tl;dr hold yer damn horses for patch notes till closer to the patch that way it can detail all the changes of that patch instead of trying to predict the state of said patch a week in advance, coding is god damned complicated
---
I just want more content. I've done pretty much everything worth doing have my mule characters loaded down with mats and caps. I build my baller base. I need something to do!!!
---
I want level 95 glowing legendary wendigos in clown costumes somewhere in the list, Camden maybe?
---
It only works on percentages. I was one shot killed at level 10 by a lvl 60 player a few weeks ago. I had just claimed a workshop and was at about 70% health because of doing the defend mission and turrets suck at targeting mole rats. And it doesn’t matter how “low” damage is, if you get attacked enough then you eventually die. So it’s pretty easy to see “how people die” when getting attacked. 
---
Honestly the only exploits I think they are fixing are the ones allowing people to dupe and also the have all the plans in the game one.  The others I think most agree aren’t exploits but simply annoyances.  Hopefully if they do fix some of these then the bit about vendors having more plans means they will be making the items static but expensive to reduce hops.
---
If you wanted to buy a 1* Furious 50. Cal I’m guessing around 2-3k. I’ve bought and sold a lot of legendary heavies but Furious can be very hard to find sometimes
---
But I like the classical radio :( 
---
Very good stuff! Nice to know what to do with each crash! I started to notice some of this stuff like the noises but never knew if I needed to do a game restart or not!
---
True.  But ideally the message should be universal and spread across all social platforms.  It amazes me that some people don't use Reddit but you're completely right.
---
I wondered at the various crash sites in game; if there was going to be a Denver reference, tribute, or Easter egg.  
---
Dual weilding pistols and 10mm submachine guns should be a thing.
---
Really. 
---
looks nice!
---
Praying this gets fixed in the next patch.
---
Are people seriously complaining about a lack of clear language in an "expect more info on the 14th" post? Who the heck expects more out of an "expect more info soon" post?
---
Lord, people are incredibly eager to complain nowadays.
---
Charleston herald, Charleston Capital building, sugar grove, abandoned bog town. Look for typewriters, desk fans, hot plates, clipboards, anything that would logically have screws or springs in it.
---
&gt;You think they’re gonna port both to console so you can get free stuff conveniently?! Cmon man
---
I never said that.  I merely told the user who asked that PS4/Xbox players also got the game, but had to play it on PC.  
---
I played both on a 6” thick ibm laptop that ran windows 95 I believe. It worked fine and I know damn well my phone is more powerful than that thing was
---
Yes he's a level 21 and likes to be hugged.  There are perk cards you can get that allow you to tame "some" animals under certain circumstances.  Hit me up in game if you'd like to see him.
---
That's an officially stated policy I pray they don't back out of. 
---
I have a legit double explosive shotty. I'll be sad if that's nerfed. 
---
But I also leveled with melee and have a 2 shot .308 pipe pistol.
---
But if changes require even MORE farming...I'm out. People have lives, there's not time for farming during limited gameplay hours
---
Hey Beth give this man his money!
---
🍻 ty
---
I'd also love it if there was a mini event if it was shot and didn't hit anything (like shot into the sky) to tell players "yo I need help" which could add some more player to player interaction.
---
Thats awesome dude, nice use of the environment.  
---
Well that's even worse then isn't it.  Why in the @#$#@ would the world crash?
---
I don't think you really need to buy any Bethesda points you get plenty just for playing the game but it's good you supported Bethesda like that after everything!
---
You can't. The upper floor is attached to the stairs. Looks like he just put a foundation next to his bridge to give the illusion that it's all connected. 
---
20 hour after you sold to a vendor.
---
Once a vendor is out of caps, they are out forever.
---
It’s random. If you sever hop then Vendors in other worlds can have caps, other times they don’t. It’s pretty much an unknown. 
---
It's either the server crashes or the game crashes. A simple "Join the last server" option would solve a lot of my frustration. 
---
I’ll help with the launch, just make sure you have a nuke key card and rank of General with the Enclave.  I don’t usually get on until around 9pm est. Total Chaos xxx
---
I don't think this counts, but I saw someone asking the other day how to get the flamingo lawn ornaments. I received the plan from a defend event at Sunshine Tiding Co. today so that is a place to try for those plans.
---
I think it’s partially due to the FO crowd never playing an online game before and expecting their standalone fo experience.
---
It seems to happen between 11pm and 1am Central, for me.
---
Basically if you did your runs at 4, it will reset at 12. 
---
I want to organize workshop PVP and role play but you're right - gamers don't show. Sometimes i rant about how they seem to have no imagination or will to do anything but grind unless their overlords @ Bethesda give them permission first, and hold their hands throughout. But then again lots of you abhor PVP.
---
For what it's worth i've managed to organize a Bloodborne event for a few years now and it's only growing: you got to live stream it weekly! A schedule is super important, and you got to put on a show as well.
---
Instead of just dumping a bag of trash in the wilds of Whitespring should be more like live streaming a game show complete with a larger than life personality.
---
I think they’re just being lazy 
---
It's explained somewhere in a terminal that Nuka Cola was doing a promotion (not sure if for the game area or all across the US) that would use the caps as a currency, which is why the vendors and machines use them instead of the pre-war money.
---
Technically you can't name them, but I call him Claws.
---
I have a Pet Yao Guai and occaisionally a level 90 Deathclaw
---
Combat pets are better. 
---
To the place... 
---
Xbox 5-8 depending on the night and server. Multiple disconnects per night. A crash to dashboard at least once per night. Graphical issues, pop-ins, etc. Minor glitches here and there. It's playable but annoying and frustrating at times. 
---
You need to provide more detail, it never auto repaired itself .. at least not in my experience.
---
There is a note in game about a promotion Nuka Cola was running and they had vending machines for the promotion that took caps. 
---
I fucked up my reply. My bad. It was meant in response to the guy annoyed that pc users get the games for free on pc. 
---
Yeah go hit all 7 diff vendors and get ur 1400 caps/day 
---
I actually early game made a build based around the idea that missing pieces would be the greenhouse set when I found it, because i didn't realize just how stripped down the system was. 
---
It's always nice to help folk like you! 
---
&gt; My reason for being so cavalier in my response to you is because you heavily implied that all this work had already been done more than adequately by another party
---
So you were... indeed the special person who was butt hurt and started calling other people special butt hurt people?
---
This is painful. You're trying to rationalize shutting out multiple sources of information because of a success that you have no way to qualify while attempting to rationalize how well you're doing in comparison to sources you just recently learned existed. That's brilliant. The last sentence was sarcasm.
---
Falloutmaps.com is generated from user submitted entries and says so on the proverbial tin. You're asking to recreate their work but "see it for yourself" - which is work that has probably not been done because the usefulness of it has a shorter lifespan than the effort with results being less than scientific.
---
My own struggle of trying to acquire the Ultracite Gatling Laser plan does not invalidate that other players have stated they have been awarded it from a specific event. You would be quick to point that out in regards to someone else, I'm sure, but are taking the time to slowly and meticulously prove that you are incapable of that reflection. There may just be a reason your undertaking is naive, especially when it involves invalidation and dismissal of superior work to what you have, but the one-dimensional peacocking is pretty transparent.
---
No sense in arguing this one because people have their different views on how things should be. 
---
I simply just try and look at all the factors and determine WHY things are the way they are. And for pistols the reasons I keep hearing aren't good ones. 
---
If pistols were meant to be some of the worst damage-wise then why would anyone invest in all the perks they have to offer? there's not a good enough incentive to use them over other weapons. 
---
Side arms?... why? why would they have all these perks to make a pistol focused build if they are but a mere sidearm? 
---
It's much easier to use a low damage melee weapon or something as a secondary to kill low level hordes since you don't have to hold ammo for it, it doesn't have to reload, it is cheap to repair and it probably weighs less than a pistol most of the time. And idk what this guys is talking about reload speed being faster on pistols.. maybe a 10mm vs a lever action, but I barely see a difference in reloading between pistols and rifles. especially with a quick mag or speed demon. 
---
So where does that leave pistols? In a spot where you really just have to love them enough to want to use them? 
---
I love pistols and I found no desire to allocate perk points into them after having tried it. you have to invest SO much to make them truly work and then you're left with little room for your primary gun perks. 
---
I see people saying they have success with a high AGL high LCK VATS critical damage builds. 
---
Ok but what if I want to run a pistol build without VATS? fuck me then? 
---
They need some help just like energy weapons. 
---
It’s ok I got $tack$ from dis new recørd dæl
---
Just give it a month or two, they'll open vault dungeons that drop item level 60 or higher weapons (think destiny strikes) and the old stuff will be mostly obsoleted, especially if they adjust tse weapons.

The was more text in the fallout classic pack than actual content for 76 patches.  This really says a lot for the game. :(
---
Most of the quality mods from nexus (baring cosmetics, which they can't use the textures from) would definitely qualify as performance enhancements in some way. 
---
I tried extracting the sounds ba2 and replacing the jukebox sound files with custom converted ones but it still seems to play the original somehow.
---
So I tried using the purification machine and it won't let me since I guess the items required are quest only. I read all the notes/holotapes tied to dyer and organic solution no real answers. Hacked the extra terminals as well no luck. The Deathclaw bonemeal locator will not activate outside of the quest itself. So this makes me wonder of the bonemeal is just a quest specific item as well.
---
So yes it shows you can interact with the purifier but the items might just not be obtainable outside of the quest. 1 or 2 runs when the swamp quest is on should suffice when you have super duper and chemist but really sucks. Having to rely on a random quest for a fixed limited amount of blooms.
---
Just a side thought maybe when a season is active in mire it will bloom? Just a thought. I'm going to ask that friend if he did it himself after organic solution or just heard about it.
---
They never said they would not give it to people who were not still playing or refunded...
---
Robots and super mutants have weaker energy defence, so in theory you're probably dealing more to these particular enemies by taking along an energy weapon.  But I think ghouls, and most other animals are resistant to energy weapons.
---
The bigger issue is that a lot of energy weapons aren't really that strong, so you might be better off sticking to ballistic weapons, which have a larger variety, and usually better damage outputs.
---
Likely visual glitch. Sell something to make sure. A lot of times vendors show 0 caps, but in fact have 200. Also there are multiple factions. All vendors under one faction share caps. Whitesprings station vendor shares caps with the vendors within Whitesprings. Phoenix in Watoga for BoS, the vendor in Harper's Ferry, all of the raider vendors, responders, etc.

My uncle owned a computer shop and helped be fix up a broken table top computer. Also windows 95 with 128 mb (if I remember correctly) of ram and 1 gig hd. Ran smooth as butter, lol.

Wicked chance for you to role play a raider! The whole server will be more exciting if you handle it with maturity.
---
Scorch beasts can’t see me even when they land directly in front of me and are eyeball to eyeball with me.
---
played for over a month...then demands refund....nice
---
RadX, but yes. Radaway wouldn't do anything if they have lvl 2 starched genes equipped. RadX will suppress the mutation regardless.
---
Well, it's not so much that the execution it's self is inherintly bad, it just points out some of the other flaws, that being legendary farming/flux stabalization mat farming, and that there are no safeguards against people selling shit on ebay, or 'cap vending' to other players for real world cash
---
I know on console if you go to the persons profile and block them that it's permanent but I can't speak for PC
---
Sadly, this size is unachievable without the game generously giving you an extra copy of your base due to whatever glitch currently causes that to happen.
---
If you're on PS4 our group does a plan/recipe share pretty much daily, we all just drop our plans and cycle through the group.  We do it for every new person who joins in (we invite everyone on the server if we have a spot open). IGN: Calamity1985.
---
Remember when we had C.A.M.P. radios? Fallout 76 B.E.T.A. remembers.
---
They still might not, all we have to go on right now are rumors.
---
I'm sure that pipe pistol would be nasty if I put the points into it
---
So I was thinking about this... and bunkers...  and I think I know how they could do it eventually.
---
How do normal MMO's handle something like this? Instancing!  Create a "portal" in the normal world that only exists when your online, and only if no one has a portal there.  it could be against any rock, or directly on the group.    
---
Then when you 'enter' the instance (loading screen, etc) it connects you with your own little slice of appalachia.  Start with just a basic house.  Then make expansion (limited of course) to pre-determined room sizes and themes. (Cave, Vault, Bunker, Mine, etc).  Heck make it a quest - if you want to build further (increase your cave size) you need to... repar the machine at Greg's Mine Supply! Or go to the AMS headquarters and get plans! Things like that.  
---
Limit it to a similar budget.  But since it's not "in the world" naturally, you wouldn't have to budget it as much, seeing as people would have to zone in specifically to see it. Conversly, when they zone out, it doesn't need to store the data ont he world map.  
---
It breaks immersion (loading screens) but would add some functionality that makes sense.
---
The block feature is terrible. They can wait until you restart a session and rejoin you. If you're on xbox, appear offline and block them from there. I can't help other platforms.
---
I need marsupial and adrenal. I'll add you when I get online
---
You mean the post titled "Remember its your duty to destroy camps at the golf club" with 476 points? Yeah, I suppose it does mention turrets *in the description.* Maybe I'm being slightly presumptuous, but the incident with my camp happened just a few hours after that was posted.
---
I don't know how much you frequent this subreddit or read through the comments, but there have been quite a few people encouraging others to destroy every camp they see behind the golf club.  I'm just asking that people use some common sense, that's all.
---
I had mentioned in another comment that I will be doing it in a low lvl friendly area. The way I plan to do it everyone should have no issues with enemies as me and the guys I’m going to host this with will kill anything that spawns leaving everyone else free to search around. 
---
They regurgitated what they said last time.
---
I think have this misconstrued.  Most players are waiting for content on fixing current issues.  E.g water purifier bug address, duping, disconnects, stash box crashes.
---
They have teased a new pvp mode and vault raids but provided absolutely no content on how they work, look etc.  A simple blog post on what they are working on would buy the dev team patience with the 76 community.
---
You do. Well, loot, anyway. If a teammate kills an enemy, and your are within whatever the range is, you get a loot roll. I get loot of wheelies so the time that I punched. Likewise, my teammates get loot off enemies that I one-punch-manned.
---
I’d be happy with just a player auction house.  Somewhere we could set up buy and sell orders and wait for others to fulfill them.  Limit the number of orders you can put up so you can’t fill it up with items from a 4 hour grind fest.  
---
The downside would be 1 of 2 things.  We couldn’t have alt characters that we could swap inventories between.  This would allow folks just to sell everything and not make tough decisions on what to sell / scrap.    If they do an auction house and one day allow alt swapping, a market tax would have to be super high to avoid taking advantage of alt swapping inventory.
---
O R HE ILL EY....

time to go to the bat cave and do some testing, I might have to use that stealth gear more often

I did my own testing, almost everything you said is wrong.

Absolutely Agree
---
Frostfall mod for skyrim  had something like this, I loved how immersive it was.
---
I had 30 hardened mass in a nuke zone last and when I died a guy took my junk.
---
I was pissy but then shrugged and dropped all my flux for him too and we continued farming legendaries together.
---
It’s a stupid mechanic but it is what it is
---
Ugh, this just explains the issue I had this morning.  I couldn’t figure out where it went, I thought it spoiled and turned into something else.
---
So it's a hoe house?
---
This seems all sorts of incorrect. I farm plans at two locations, one being Harpers and you didn't mention the most obvious plan location and question the church one? If you've done any farming for a good length of time and just looked at a clock you'd quickly realize how the spawns work...
---
Xp and legendaries would be my guess.
---
I have two builds possible atm, working on #3
---
 Took me a long time to learn this. Now when teamed with my buddy I'm like Luke in The last Jedi and it pisses him off cause he's burning stims and in just chilling killing the damn thing. 
---
Looks great! That terrain is fantastic for a wood build.
---
I get level 45+ drops from uranium fever all the time.
---
Not that i am not happy about the communication. I was expecting more details Bethesda. Still thanks for update.
---
PS4.
---
We’ll work something out psn b_nano69
---
Thanks, I actually debated using brick but the rough wood fits in so well
---
Hardened mass, glowing mass, and high radiation fluids don't spoil, so I had a bunch stockpiled and just needed more hardened. I also needed to scrap the loot I found along the way and didn't feel like doing it individually. Such a silly oversight
---
It's a NAT problem. I have a great connection but there are some people i can't group with in Monster Hunter as well - on the hub.
---
In 76 there are a couple i can't team with almost ever.
---
On PC there is a solution - download Legends game, connect on that, then swap titles. Likewise if you connect to a friend in MHW it might work in 76.
---
It is still useful for farming gear, and leveling perk cards. Its also a little easier to find hardened masses when you need to make more flux. 
---
In a real MMO, duping is horrifying and game changing. In my EQ2 days there was a big in veeshans peak where you could dupe stones for artifact armor, early on giving your guild a leg up on other guilds. WOW had some of the same issues. 
---
Fo76? No purpose to it. Joe's inventory literally has no effect on my game. So beyond its effects on server stability I dont care about duping. Sadly ... and i mean sadly, the servers are pretty shitty without duping. So ... eh. If people can figure out how to make money from this, then they're using a system that's broken. I dont blame people for doing it outside the game  I blame the 500 turrents at white springs. I blame BGS for not patching or at least addressing it. Now it's possible they're waiting for a patch to do a banwave but I have my doubts.
---
Tl;dr - its douchey, but the system let's them get away with it. Wish I could pay my bills from a video game, haha.
---
Get another pet.
---
Like a squirrel.
---
Pets can be killed but tend to respawn and be immortal in that regard...not always but it’s common.
---
I just want it to be worth the effort to killing them.   They need some decent loot.
---
Every time I logged in my armor would miraculously be at full health, lasted from level 25-44. It certainly was beneficial, and wondered if anyone else’s game was affected similarly...
---
Yeah I had an elevated camp and they never came in from the road side. I moved that turret to the top so I wasn't repairing turrets all the time. It helped. 
---
I think that was my favorite spot in the game so far. I'm over on the border of the mire and bog right now and although I have plenty of space for water filters it's not at pretty. 
---
Move your camp close to the clubhouse at White Springs, that should do it.
---
Nuke vault 76 instead. You’ll have loads of starting materials when you go there, because you’ll kill off the noobs
---
The event objectives need to be labeled, and have different icons. Just finding them is the challenge for these events.
---
850 seems to get me 1 shotted by a tse pump maybe I should try 400 
---
Ahh okay ok. Thanks everyone for responding. I thought I'd get banned for bringing this up.   
---
Gonna need a lot more then 20 for the good stuff.  Honestly I gave up on getting them.
---
Indeed, that is remarkably off-topic.
---
I did this earlier today trying to kill that mob with a new found explosive Gatling gun.  I didn’t even realize I had someone behind me until the death scene.   I just left the server after that.  Lost to much junk to even go try to find.
---
How is one an exploit, but not the other? Force spawning mobs for example, in no less an exploit that duping. 
---
How did you get  refund, what platform are you on ?
---
Eh. I pay over 10 bucks for a pack of cancer sticks. I am not one to comment on spending habits.
---
It is the most efficient location in the game for farming legendaries. Even if it's boring, its easy. That tells you a lot about how bad this game is right now
---
When he is shooting another player who is wanted pacifist mode is sort of pointless 
---
&gt;Scorch Beat queen
---
She a Soundcloud rapper?
---
Anyway, not everyone gets to Level 100 the same way.  Meandering will get you there just as surely as grinding.  I'm 106 and have never nuked anything yet.  I'm saving it for a rainy day.
---
I've only recently started hitting nuke zones regularly to try to get the best weapons.  The ones I have work great for everything else, but they don't do a lot against SBQ.
---
There's a cosmetic bug where it sometimes displays 0 caps instead of what the vendor actually has.
---
I just pick up every phone I see.
---
I sold 200 circuitry to a vendor last night.
---
Mmmm. I can almost taste the lead
---
Engineer could be interesting, but why would you sit in a workshop/camp for a few extra mats when you could instead be elsewhere claiming other workshops or farming mats? The benefit of collectors is that they work while you’re away. For Huntsman, personally I wouldn’t waste a perk for it when a recon scope works. Cash shoes would be interesting, but perhaps it could indicate vendor caps too? Red = no caps, yellow = less than 100 caps, green = 100+ caps. To save wasted travels to station to try and sell something. Band geek, ehh, more of a novelty thing. And Pick pocket would be terrible for the game in terms of stealing from players inventories, and pointless in terms of planting explosives in my opinion 
---
They are cheesing the game to farm easy gear and caps.
---
The turrets tag the ghouls and kill them while they are free to do more imporant things like give handjobs to youtube wannabes.
---
Is this a fact? It hasn't worked for me. I'm on PS4. Blocking them only blocks them as long as you're ON that session. If you go you the main menu, or power outage, or the game just crashes, when you log back in, they'll be there unblocked (not high probability, but they get unblocked regardless). 
---
This is probably the best relatively easy addition that would make late game progression feel less grindy I’ve seen in this sub. 
---
Well played. 
---
Yeah. I wish there was honestly. Cause he died in a kit plane with a fault he knew of, but flew anyway. Apparently he accidentally pushed the right rudder while turning to the left in his seat trying to do something with the fuel selector valve, which was known to be faulty. Also, he wasn’t technically legally allowed to fly due to multiple drunk driving incidents the year prior, but he had flown it 30 minutes a few days before the crash, and no one was stopping him from flying. Still very very sad. R.I.P. John Denver
---
Can you play the old fallout games on a mac with wine?
---
I'll go double check the church location based on this comment. Do you have a refined explanation of how the respawns work that you'd be willing to share so I can amend the post? 
---
I belong...
---
1.  More bang for your buck then Queen amount of loot, overall quality of loot (till they fix her drops), 10x more exp, every flux possible is also at white springs.  
---
2.   I put it all in #1.  
---
Woah, how much did you get like 15 caps
---
Because this game is rushed and unfinished 
---
You’re the hero we all need! May the nukes fall in your favor!
---
You get far more legendary opportunities nuking Whitesprings than you do the queen. The SBQ can also be a pain if people show up who can't dish out enough damage, but I admit that is getting less frequent. Lots of people over 100 still don't have the gear they're after so it's the better opportunity for more drop chances. I agree that it's boring, but there aren't a ton of great options for consistent max level legendary rolls.
---
Seriously, 16 basic colours would go a long way to establish some good will with the plate base.
---
It doesnt stack.. But if you have to repair mid fight, being in hazmat underneath helps:) or of you misclick and accidently exit PA:p
---
Pandora's box thing- it's open and there's no going back.
---
The line between what started as legit and what's been duped is so far gone at this point it doesn't even matter.  If you want to partake in that market you just have to accept that anything you're buying has very likely been duplicated in an abuse of some game mechanic- a cheat, in other words. 
---
When you get to the point where you're far enough in the game that you can make your 1400 caps a day from all of the vendors, you can go online and buy weapons or armor that are life changing to play with for 3 or 4 days worth of grinding for caps. Or don't- people always say they love Fallout for the choices you can make- this is one of them now.

---
yup, blue vault 76 paints. 
---
&gt;- Top of the World, you can get here either by fast traveling to the top of the world, or alternatively fast traveling to the Pleasant Valley Ski Resort, the location is directly between both fast travel points. You're looking for a little raider crafting area outside, with a number of display cases. Inside the display case you will see an armor mod appear, unfortunately for now I haven't been farming the location enough to specify what mods precisely appear here.
---
There's a little alley towards the back of Pleasant Valley Ski Resort, it's like a trade alley.  There's little stalls set up in there, and several plans can spawn there.  It's on a road with stalls on either side.  You can get chem recipes, food recipes, weapon mod plans, weapon plans, armor mod plans, and armor plans.  There's about 8 spawn points and its pretty random as to which ones will show up.  I check it daily.  Additionally, there's a fighting pit in the middle of the stalls that has some raider power armor spawn in it.
---
In addition to the spot you mentioned between pleasant valley and top of the world, there's a little nook down the steps near the big gate into pleasant valley that has a weapons work bench.  Armor/Weapon plans can spawn here too.
---
bye bye TSE , and marsupial. White spring farming is gonna get nerfed to be like regular zones
---
Your right something is fishy man. The post is very small and very vague. Heck could of thrown it up last week with how vague it is. Still i guess we are getting some communication. How the exploit fixes comes with some repercussion for those that abused it as well. Very hard to tell much from that almost tweet like post.
---
Black powder weapons lose condition really fast.
---
You need weapon artisan and gunsmith to make them useful for any sort of fight not next to a weapon workbench.  (Scorch beast queen for example), otherwise it breaks and you’re left lugging around 15lbs if broken gun.
---
Helpful.   How do you do it?  What button makes the target shift?
---
Been gone 42 days
---
Which is well-documented. I'm just bringing another stupid feature under the umbrella 
---
This is an acceptable name. *Thumbs up*
---
I think you misspelled Mary Sue
---
was gonna say, there's no way this fits in a regular/unexploited budget (that said I wish bethesday would allow constructions this big and bigger, clearly the game can handle it)
---
Besides looking for neat legendaries, I get dragged there, unwillingly, by friends and wife to help them level.
---
I use a baton and mostly stand around and be hit while people tag them.
---
I'm a lvl 192 pinata.
---
Or just an “eBay” holotape we can load into any computer that loads up an auction website ran by players.
---
Mr. prize bot can come deliver the caps 
---
Diablo 3 took time to learn. In my playthrough of that game on launch, I only found 2 legendaries starting from normal to the end of inferno difficulty. (a level 27 claw and a lvl 15 crossbow) neither were slightly useful.
---
Oh did you get plasma pistol 14 times?  Hey I'm on 17 guess how many plasma pistol plans I have?
---
Gotta be honest, I've tried farming White Springs, but personally the legenedaries there mostly drop shit.  My best legendary weapons have not come from White Springs, personally. 
---
Sugar Grove, Emergency Center, and Watoga Civic center and One Violent Night Event have been my best drops.
---
Boom I'll take it! I need a legendary energy weapon Soo bad lol Nova Drone add me, I can help w the nuke too but not for a little while
---
I have no clue, sorry!
---
As much as I'd love for you to be wrong, I think you're right. The amount of xp you can farm in a session at whitesprings vs *anywhere* else on the map is insane. I wouldn't doubt they cut back on the spawns or refresh too.
---
I’m all for fixing the game, but this game needs content ASAP. They have added more to the Atomic Shop than they have added to anything else.
---
Under the covers of the graphics tenderer and front end there is still specific code running that you can poke with preprogrammed inputs. You wouldn’t need to automate a proxy player, just nudge the a script and see what gets dumped out. FO76 is much more of a buggy mess than other triple A titles so either they have some completely arcane codebase that defies all logic and industry standards or they are just not as competent at testing as other premium studios.
---
What specific stuff? You tag "etc" on the end although almost nothing was specific at all aside from vendor plans. Fixing "various exploits" is specific to you? Does "fixing a few Legendary mods" give you any detail?
---
People are frustrated. How hard can it be to include some examples about what is actually being worked on? "Some of the things we’re planning to address include issues with several Challenges and quests such as ______ quest having _____ problem."
---
We're not asking them to release the full patch notes a week in advance, but dang. Details would be great. Especially for the first update post after a holiday break.
---
If ur really in trouble. You’d be willing to roll those dice
---
i dunno. thats just what i've heard around the reddit water cooler. any time a thread comes up where someone says they need to delete all duped items theres always a bunch of replies saying they cant. tried googling but didnt find anything official. fingers crossed they wipe all inventories with duped items but i'd bet 10k atoms they wont

bethesda launcher

Too meaty for the mechanicum
---
I finally ended up with a TSE Handmade in game.  LOL...I have killed myself with it so many times!  Im not even sure if it works right or not.  LOL.   
---
Wouldn't surprise me yeah. With all the people server hopping I imagine it hit the servers pretty hard.
---
I'm not a fan of people in my house. I'm funny like that. I do leave my purifier unlocked though.
---
Yep this is why I don't think the idea of upping gear caps to render the duped TSEs obsolete will work, because the TSE shotguns are so OP that you'd need to make the cap like 500 to have them be even slightly obsolete.  
---
Usually happens at my camp
---
refunded long time ago, crappy game.
---
Plot Twist:  CertainPassenger and OP are the same person.
---
Yup, that's what I found as well :). Interesting thought on the verdent season, I rather doubt it but might be worth checking.
---
I don't want to troll I just want to see what is possible, and maybe trap some bounty hunters or maybe defending a workshop. Not some random person who just wanders in. Unless I can give them an option to give me some mats to let them go just for fun RP as a Raider. A few purified water or some spoiled food or some nuclear waste maybe to let them go hehe.
---
My campis at that location &amp; I really don't have a problem with Anglers. Most I've had has been a low level supermutant or mirelurk or two...
---
nope, refunded in november.
---
This is a great idea! Mind if I add you and join in on the swapping one day soon? I’ve already unlocked most plans, that’s what I spend the majority of my time chasing down. I’ve got TONS of extra plans I don’t mind giving away to anyone that needs them
---
Then why tf you here? I Beth isn't going to read this, and talking shit here is like walking into a political rally and talking shit on the party. Not gonna get a lotnof support here. 
---
You can't tell me that the host servers are not multi platform.
---
Rofl. You're killing me with these responses.
---
It's very clear that you've confused endgame with 'the game'. Because you think endgame is the only thing to do, which is hilarious to me. Here's a fun fact for you: I have played for about 100 hours, and I have never done anything grindy like repetitively grinding gear upgrades to optimize a build. I explore, I build, I do quests/events, I craft, I scavenge. Some of those things entail a bit of grind, none of those things are endgame or inherently grindy.
---
As to Whitesprings, I don't know how much clearer I can explain to you that I will never be grinding mobs like you do. I don't do Korean MMOs. :P  The entire point of my post is that Bethesda needs to provide more endgame things to do because this kind of grindy shit will not support the game for any considerable length of time, and you turn around and tell me that this is what endgame currently is... I can't reply in any other way but to say "No shit Sherlock, what do you think my criticism was about in the first place??" xD 
---
I think you have what you consider to be 'this game' confused with what the game actually offers though. Because it offers more than what you're taking from it. And it's fine if you want to grind shit for gear, but then to assert that that is the game? That's disingenuous and sad.
---
Yeah I just had a nuke drop my last session and recorded it. It's one of the coolest visuals on the game without a doubt
---
Lol I did that part once and my newfound friend got on and shot it dead in the eye once to finish the challenge
---
No. U just see them, then answer the call
---
Pipe weapons get their own "harder to break" perk so I think it would be impossible to break with that and 50% harder to break on all weapons
---
I think this is the best solution I have seen so far.  
---
Take over the Workshop that gives you Titanium as it's the Black Titanium you need as well as Junk Piles that give you Screws Springs, etc.
---
See ya
---
Ik I would
---
Not true. General consensus is they refresh approx every 20hrs. 
---
I'm actually in the "fix it before you pile on" camp, but you're right, an honest to God road-map would be absolutely spectacular.  At this point though, for me at least, knowing that they're stabilizing the most glaring issues is more important than knowing how future content will play out.
---
Alts in mmo’s is totally normal.
---
What’s not is having to pester a friend to act as an intermediary while you swap between characters.
---
Set up a “post office” with branches in each region that has a few stash boxes and a “shared mailbox” that you can put 50lbs into and have it there for any character on your account.
---
I did it maybe 2 weeks ago, forgot my level but i guess it was around your actual level. Playing semi auto and stealthy as you. Getting to the button was much easier than expected, i could shoot most enemies from a nice distance. Just bring a shotgun to the party, but i almost didn't need it.
---
After hitting the button i killed exactly one (1) enemy and fast travelled to the bot outside. Just go to stealth mode before pushing the button and even the enemies manifesting nearby won't see you, so you can fast travel. If they haven't changed the possibility to use fast travel for that quest in one of the last patches you will be fine.
---
Nope. Vendors will implode and the server crashes.
---
You have to run the alt account on the “home Xbox”, and you signed in to an alternate Xbox. 
---
Assuming you’re the main account with 76 on it. 
---
I think it's a living game that Bethesda will be investing in for years. Some may be upset with what was launched but it won't be the same a year or two years later. Thankfully there's no subscription, one price gets you all the updates for its life. So I see no issue in playing it for the amount of time it's fun, dropping it for a while, and coming back to it later.
---
Refined? They are simply on a timer from the moment they were picked up on the server.
---
Bethesda: “oh good idea, 24 hours starting on a Thursday morning specifically at 4:58 AM. Just so the whales make us money and those chumps who grind for atoms miss out”
---
I think blocking them doesn't prevent them from loading into the same session as yourself I'm pretty sure it just stops them from being able to message you, send friend requests and they can't search your name.
---
Could you have accidently hit the other player chasing the bounty?
---
It’s literally just moving the analog stick. It focuses on the main body when I ended vats and depending on whether I move it left or right it will target different limbs. A couple of days ago I partied with two people who offered to help be get a couple of fast travel locations. 8 was lvl 9, the girl was lvl 21 and her brother was 79 I think. We ran across scorched beasts in the cranberry bog and I basically just focused on the wings in vats to try and help get it down a touch quicker so the guy could sledgehammer it in the face. 
---
I said this a month ago, specific perks such as weight reductions should be a passive perk, was unlocked it’s always active.
---
Even that alone would give enough Special freedom to choose between cards
---
There was a glitch that made it so you go clip into a mountain. First place your camp on a very steep mountain. Second build the cooking station that has the pot on a metal grate thing. Third position it towards the mountain so you clip into the mountain when you enter the cooking station. Fourth enter the cooking station and exit while backing up so that you clip into the mountain without being pushed out. Fifth if there is a second wall then repeat. Note: There is no floor so you will have to repeat these steps until you find a ledge you can land on so you can start building. Note #2: I don't know if this glitch still works
---
They have limits and those limits are being exceeded. Cool.
---
Has that affected MY experience as you claim? No. How do I know this? Because my FPS is unchanged and I still rarely crash. Very rarely. I played like a 5-6 hour session the other day with a couple of server hops and still didn't crash once. 
---
Oh good I'm not the only one who feels a put in their stomach when jumping from high up
---
So does this mean stacking AP damage actually makes it worse? Is this the same for anti armor legendary effect and then adding armor piercing mags or does it only consider perk cards? Excellent write up and data analysis 
---
Lol try playing diablo2 you could spend a year grinding just to get enigma 
---
yeah but it's all RNG. Your chances of getting a good legendary are the same in whitesprings or any of those events since they don't distribute legendary loot in any way other than complete RNG. I think that's the problem, which focuses people to go after quantity, which Whitesprings provides. One Violent Night is great, too, because if you don't use any instruments or anything you can get a ton of legendary ghouls, but at that point what's the difference from Whitesprings at that point? I personally have found more worthwhile legendary gear at Whitesprings than anywhere else, because I've been able to kill significantly more legendary mobs there. Until they give us more focused methods of farming specific stuff or more spots where similar numbers of legendary creatures can spawn at 50+, I just don't really see this changing.
---
Where as the Blood Ravens would have dropped in, said "don't mind us", take all your stuff, and leave. XD
---
They can but the wanted mechanic is a very big disincentive to do so since you don't get anything out of it except spiting them; but even then the repair costs for them probably won't be too bad while you'll probably get a large cap bounty for destroying an entire fully built CAMP.
---
Yep. I thought this was proven, without a shadow of a doubt, back when Borderlands came out. Everyone very quickly realized that 17.5 million randomly generated guns just means the game has 17.4 million garbage guns that nobody wants to use. That was almost 10 years ago. 
---
It started like that for me, but after a day or two, nothing but Anglers.  Wrecked my camp a few times and killed me once when I was AFK for a couple minutes.  Finally moved.  The neighbors just sucked.
---
On the flip side of that, I found a legendary grahm yesterday. Three star level 50 legendary...except he's invincible. I would have killed him without hesitation, and believe me, I tried
---
Ah yeah I totally agree with you there. 
---
They chap you collected the bounty on was likely in a team, so when you popped him this let his teammates hit you full-damage on the first shot. You aggro'd the team as well as the wanted player, so no slap damage applied.
---
In before Monty Python references 
---
Could have been the wanted players friend getting revenge.
---
Probably related to your level.
---
Coolio
---
&gt;so I doubt making caps worthless would work at this point.
---
That’s only one point bud, there’s 6 more to take into consideration. If you could farm caps easily and 99% of the items in the game are traded by vendors then it would effectively kill duped items.
---
Weapons and gear would be made inferior by increasing the level cap on items. You can see it now, nobody wants a level 35-40 TSE weapon when they could have a level 45-50 TSE weapon.
---
17.4999999999 Guns nobody wants.   Then there’s the 6 versions of the conference call.
---
Just msg me on xbox.
---
Take off Starched Genes before you drink the Serum because if you do not, it won't work.
---
And if the legendary opportunities are so great, why do they have to keep going back and doing it again?  If they dropped a nuke on White Springs and got some cray powerful weapons that could kill anything, there would be no need to go back and farm it again. 
---
People I know if nuked the place like 3-5 times.
---
The fact that they are still nuking the place trying to find the perfect weapon is proof that the perfect weapon doesn't drop there more often than not.
---
Yeah, my Xbox is the one I'm always signed into and buy games on.  My son's xbox is my old one that is still considered my "home xbox".  So anything I buy digitally on my new xbox, my son can play even while I'm signed in and playing on my xbox.  No idea how long that will last till they fix/change it, but it's been that way for years.
---
Msg me on xbox
---
I always catch myself typing orcs when I'm meaning to type super mutants.
---
Don't feel too bad: I purposely replaced all my foundations (except the corner pieces which I can't seem to get rid of) with walls to make more room and budget for my indoor garden.
---
And here I thought I was to over encumbered with 60 over you’re over 200 pounds over Jesus how do you deal with that
---
Bit disappointed that this wasn't posted by an official community manager (you'd think they'd know when these posts launch) but more power to the user who did.
---
Alright I will. I'm about to take a shower then I'll be on. Sorry. 
---
I did this the other day and there was 5 other players doing the event, all with explosive weapons. I left, wasn't worth it.
---
Same. I was super into the Enclave RP and Sgt Dornan sounds boards and even half-assing a ‘current’ Enclave Radio with Modus, but it’s just annoying how many non-duping crashes the server has now. Or even Hard CTD that’s happened recently. As of last week, it’s the first time I put the game down to mess around in others again.
---
They should make it that player vendors take cash and we can sell the cash for 1 cap
---
They're much worse for me. 
---
Gotta add that to the list with eyebots to farm for my lvl 1 twink
---
There's already a bleeping Ice Machine!  Let us power it, separate inventory &amp; store food / cooking pieces.  I never make the complicated recipes because something breaks down by the time you find it all
---
I would do 10-15 mephisto runs before and after each play session for the 3 years I played that game.   Never really had that end game drop.
---
Time well spent! 
---
Yeah, my CAMP would be on the opposite side of the Savage Divide from this one, overlooking Watoga.  I set up a deck and chair for watching the bombs drop there.
---
Haha no way, is that really how it works? Collecting a bounty on a teammate gives his teammates the ability to one shot you? 
---
How does that make sense?
---
I nuked it once and am never doing it again lol. So damn boring. Explosions everywhere and there's always a squad sitting directly outside the golf club waiting for a respawn. To each their own but I can't fathom how that can possibly be fun
---
Obvious troll is obvious. 
---
Bro. I have played since beta. Hundreds of hours to your hundred. There are no quests. There is no exploring. I don't mind grind to get what I want. You do. 
---
As far as xbox, you block thier gt, not only the social tab. 
---
And yet here you are. Seriously, if you don't play the game, don't rag on it.
---
Haven't had that glitch, though my fusion core always seems to magically recharge itself.  Oops I'm almost out, relog real quick,  yep back at 100%
---
They are talking about muleing. 
---
I used to do it during the Diablo 2 days.
---
Pretty much what you do is have a character or characters set aside for the sole purpose of storing things. You don't really need extra copies of the game per se, but it will help if you have them. 
---
What you do is create your additional characters and transfer the items between them using someone you trust to hold said item or items then give them to your other character via trading. If you already have someone you trust, like family or someone you know IRL versus some random you have as a friend on PS4 or Xbox or in game for that matter, it's safer.
---
So if it's you and the kids you can each make characters on your own individual accounts, then trade the item or items back and forth safely.
---
Just don't drop anything on  the floor ever as it could vanish. 
---
I don't know about having two characters from the same account online at the same time, I'm guessing no. So you might need a second licensed install for this.
---
Because that's a thing that can be done..
---
I prefer the Logan Lucky version, but any version is good really. 
---
Recent graduates of high school can be pretty smart. The recency of their graduation doesn't have any relation to their intellectual capabilities, does it?
---
It's in a protected zone, can't be nuked.
---
well then he lied, because there is a giant safe zone around it that does not allow you to launch a nuke within
---
Yeah I got a level 1 two shot pistol from an eyebot. Dropped it on the corpse outside 76, so hopefully it made someome happy.
---
If you're on xbox I could take you on tour.  
---
I think instead they should make it more random, with a number of places it can execute if there is a base near one of them.
---
I mean, making random encounters completely predictable just doesn't seem like it should be called a random encounter...
---
I feel you, I dropped my first nuke at I'm pretty sure 120 something. Wandering around going through the game slowly can get you far past the soft cap. I was probably so overleveled though because I play constantly overencumbered and have to walk through everything, then I tend to revisit locations
---
Might need a certain IQ to enjoy this game...lmao 
---
Are you implying that the server doesn't immediately crash if you go near your Nuke Zone? Because if you are, you are lying.
---
I’m aware there are 6 more points, though a couple of them are related to caps, anyway. You closed your post with “if caps have no value, duped items have no value”, which is wrong, anyway.
---
In any case, the only real solution for now is having an item wipe. Sure, Bethesda can add higher leveled weapons to make current ones useless, but seeing as the speed at they’re doing the best isnt exactly the best, I fully expect the game's economy to be dead by then.
---
Ditto. I have 5 100% cores in my stash as a reserve thanks to that one. But seriously though, I haven’t repaired my pa for 20 levels. It’s very expensive.  Certainly they couldn’t have lasted that long. I meelee’d myself through prob 5 Whitespring nukes and other daily wear and tear. I’m bummed. 
---
I think it’s because it’d be op well I bet that’s what Beth thinks
---
Being that over-encumbered is like living without access to a car - you learn to like walking around everywhere.
---
Anyhow, this is a temp thing. Once I'm done with a run (ironic, I know), walk to nearest vendors, sell/scrap enough I can fast travel and then consider next questing options.
---
As an adult with a full time job, a wife, and a kid I FULLY understand this. Especially since my game time might, (and I stress *might*) be around 2-3 hours a week. The chance of me ever getting *ANY* of the weapons I want are pretty much slim-to-none.
---
Trust me, I've dumped money into Warframe as well. This game though? I couldn't do it. To each thier own though, I won't tell people what to do with their money as I'm sure some of you would question some of my previous purchases as well.
---
I was simply surprised at how much some were getting, especially the dude thats made over $1000 so far capitalizing on nothing more than pressing a button until the game crashed. Hell, he may have even just happened to get a duped weapon from a duper and is selling the copy of his copy.
---
As others have said, I get the sense that they based their plans on other online games rather than what they were actually producing, and so they anticipated people would be wrapped up with what was released at launch for a few months while they addressed technical issues. Unfortunately, the content and systems provided are fairly limited, so people are doing repetitive things, which makes the bugs involved in those tasks obvious and especially annoying.
---
I'd be willing to bet the actual software developers haven't written a thing and are going to be up the night before, hopped up on mountain dew and ramen noodles, cranking out their patch notes like a final due in three hours.
---
Where did you get the bear proof can? 
---
I lived on dog food for around 30 levels, really cant spare the space for the good doggy perk now though :(
---
Try to interact with him when you have the poison aura mutation that makes him and his eyebot buddies go aggro on you before you can even trade- \[feelsbadman\]
---
You do understand how the legendary system works, right? What I meant by complete RNG? With the inflated pool of legendary items and prefixes, it's an incredibly small chance to actually get something you're looking for. That goes for every event or mob that drops gear. So by that logic, the best way to increase your chances are to kill as many legendary mobs as you can. yeah, white springs isn't any more likely to drop that TSE than one violent night or anywhere else, but with more legendary mobs you kill the more chances you have for it to drop. It's pretty simple stuff to understand. 
---
I have a tank pistol build, and i love it.  It does not do max damage but I run around with 200+ def nude solo and can run around in nuke zones in a rad suit and still be able to tank hits.  Not counting SB Queen, I don't have much trouble taking out mobs with my non leg 10 mm.  I gave it unarmed but it was no fun one shotting everything, so now I stick with pistols.

---
Yea I'm somewhat with you there. I mean the only reason I really would like Duping fixed is to see if it really is related to the system stability issues.  Other than that I truly don't care about the "economy" of the game as I don't plan on selling anything (for real or caps). The only real time I even offer it at all is simply because I feel bad for just vendor trashing it and want to see if anyone else could actually *use* it since it's legendary.
---
I don't think I was around for the WoW Duping though. Just the hacked items where it would have absurd stats on random gear (which I never figured out if it was an actual item, or simply a glitch with the "preview" icon) and how people would buy &amp; sell gold (I did do that in Guild Wars long, long ago)
---
I think the only true reason some of these duped weapons piss me off is simply the person using it is one shotting everything before I can even get a hit on it in Whitespring :\  However that is an issue with the person, not the whether or not his weapon is his or a duped one.
---
And the inventory is random too. I don't want to know how much time people spend with server hopping instead of playing the game.
---
Yes. Everytime anything happens one time in FO76 it was a stealth patch by Bethesda.
---
Honestly couldn't answer that as I haven't done it. 
---
I am a coder myself so I know what could be deemed as a simple fix could mean rewriting an entire module.  Also yes things can break but I am going off other companies in the same field of Bethesda.  Also to note is the fact that this is why companies have proper teams dedicated to testing new branches.  
---
Here are a few examples of how other developers manage this.
---
* Fortnite (They have a trello board for tracking bugs by the community) https://trello.com/b/Bs7hgkma/fortnite-community-issues
---
* Factorio - https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-276
---
* Rust (Look at how they deal with said reason of something taking a while...honesty!) https://rust.facepunch.com/blog/hny  and look at the comments!  People are more accepting and more patient when something is explained.  https://www.reddit.com/r/playrust/comments/a6zj48/hqm_upkeep_postmortem/

---
The current communication is not acceptable and the inside the vault should be a Blog about the game.  Every other article should be an upcoming, patch notes or general news.  Just dedicating inside the vault to what we are working on is inane.
---
I was assuming it was a 24 hour timer based exactly how you said, from the time it was picked up. That's what I originally posted, and it matched my experience. I'm assuming it's significantly less though, either that, or the rule isn't consistent for all objects, because a number of people report being able to farm multiple plans from the same spot by jumping servers within an hour. So for the time being I'm trying to figure out if it's location dependent, if there's a glitch that varies between players, or if it's consistent, and some players are just mis-reporting. 
---
Not when they engage back, but if you hit them there's usually a little banner at the bottom telling your reward. It's really easy to miss if you're engaged in something else. Also, I think if you hit them with any type of explosive the message won't show, but they can still engage (this one I'm not 100% on)
---
From what i've seen, the switch works fine, it's just that anyone can use it.  So if it's on the outside.. that'd make the purpose of the door void.  Which makes it seem like having that on the outside and the keypad on the inside a bug.
---
I get some good drops every so often, and I'm not even farming nuke zones mostly, just regular legendaries.
---
There needs to be a second super mutant vendor.
---
Binsc and Moo.
---
There are junk items that don't auto scrap like deathclaw hands. This needs to be this same. 
---
Got 'em.
---
maybe the wanted player was in another players camp.  that is a tactic they use.
---
they also have unwanted players around that will jump in front of your melee/shots so you become wanted.
---
I really think that by this time next year it’s going to be a completely different game.   If everything the developers wanted to do was dropped at once, even the hardcore players would be overwhelmed.   Imagine if WOW or Everquest in the day was realized all at launch.
---
Simple, Bethesda puts out a warning that in 24 hours all inventories will be adjusted and your items will auto delete until the carry limit is back to normal.
---
Thanks so much. I'd upvote this comment 20 times if  I could lol. I fucking hate White Springs.  One problem is the damn robots.  There's enemies everywhere, and the damn robots run straight into your line of fire. If you hit one, they all aggro on you and they seem to respawn as fast as you can kill them. 
---
Source for [Screws](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Loose_screws)
---
So sick of those posts. Just sick of White Springs in general. Everyone acts like they own the place. 
---
Kilosloth.
---
That sounds awesome. I roll with most of the mutations on all the time and focus on building as well. I’ve recently just been joining ransoms and building them cool sheds and stuff at their bases, so I think we’ll get along just fine. I’m on at nights too, I’ll add you guys when I get on later. My psn is X--Henny--X
---
That's about as dumb a reply as I could have expected haha. I mean it's not like you've really engaged with anything I've said, you just dance around it.
---
As far as Fallout being 'what I want it to be', go ahead and start a thread and ask who in this game wants to grind the same legendary packs for months at a time, for no greater purpose than to continue doing that for months at a time... but with an optimal build! xD
---
Hmm, I bet it's gonna take a few tries to get the power armor on watoga high school's roof eh?
---
Cashgrab gonna cashgrab.  
---
Don't start playing with friends. Once you do, you'll realize the game is almost unplayably boring and tiresomely glitchy and that your sole purpose in the game is farming springs so you can farm more materials so you can farm more springs so you can farm more materials so you can farm more springs so you can farm more materials - oh, a dragonthing - more springs more materials  
---
Springs Materials Springs Materials Zero Weapon Variety  
---
Was coming here solely to shout "THAT RABBIT'S DYNAMITE'"
---
Having a specialized build that takes up most of your SPECIAL and Perks isn’t equivalent to having an ability that all builds have access to.
---
PA hardly ever needs repairing though. It's incredibly resilient.
---
The too fat to fly one should be the fifth rank of the more carry weight perk
---
I like it
---
 You on PS4?
---
Unfortunately you can't get a squirrel as a pet, only pets that spawn in a random location (like a Yaoguai or a Deathclaw).  
---
I got fed up and killed it on the spot, got me wanted but funk it, it's gone. She then moved her camp and now we see if it will come back, if yes: Funk my life.
---
yes I agree and also it seems like they are not even showing all the items that can spoil in the bottom. It seems to be just a mess now. I see items with no spoil near the bottom then 5 up I see a item that is going bad.
---
Fair enough. Was thinking the engineer perk would compliment that home body perk or what's it called when hunger and thirst reduced slower as well, perhaps it would be a better increase as an overall thing like weapon artisan where you could have it "upgraded" or like the turrents just have a 2nd option of "heavy resource collector". Liking that idea more now we got the ball rolling. About the vendors being red, yellow, or green. Would be interesting to see that integrated to the maps at each station since those maps already have lights of stations as is. And you're right on the pick pocket one... Wouldn't be so great since it is a pvp type game, and i feel getting the band geek would be kind of a funny one, could help out if people were still doing the sons of dane event to make noise while still doing decent damage. Huntsman i feel like is a bit of a waste the way i described it but having some sort of tracking feature would be cool, especially if you're looking for a specific animal or creature. Thank you for your input :)
---
Hey what happened to all the ridiculous shills in this sub?  
---
I know what happened :)
---
Shouldn't it be called anti-mutant weapons then? Better yet, make enclave weapons do more damage to muties.
---
Well now, this is just not a problem I have as a high level melee tank build!
---
I just wonder how it'll be executed.  Will all existing weapons be changed or will there be ultravaluable legacy weapons?
---
Is there anywhere you can look to see if you've got a bounty on your head?
---
Yeah I absolutely can... check the social list, people you see in-game are only users on that platforms network. Ex. If you're on xbox you always send a friend request to that person's xbox profile. You do not see ps4/pc users in the list because there are none. You are not playing cross platform.
---
sometimes the server you are on needs to be turned down. Just relog onto another server.
---
Peace out 250+ useless drops from endgame enemys
---
There's a massive zone where you can't launch nukes that covers up most of the forest, including vault 76 and anywhere close to it. Also it's pretty rare at this point to see some newbie coming out of the vault, and even then it's usually a smurf account that's going to immediately rush to whitesprings or something
---
The conspiracies
---
It was a plan my buddy found twice adventuring around so he gave me his extra. He doesn’t remember where.  
---
Oh yeah totally.  In vaults, meleeing ceiling turrets sometimes you end up outside.  It's totally black.
---
And that proves my point unless they want pistol caliber rifles to also count as pistols. They need to update the UI and tell us what is intended.
---
Like the plasma flamer in FO4 counted as an automatic weapon, which is fine but here someone said it counts as a non-automatic rifle?
---
We need transparency, so if there’s a weird exception we can talk to Beth about it.
---
I appreciate the offer, feel free to add me 'Jonquill' is my GT. I am running around right now doing other verifications, but if you're free later I would appreciate it. 
---
No you can't.
---
Yeah either by pressing start, or looking at the bottom of the screen. 
---
How long before server crashes?
---
'There are no quests' hahahaha
---
' There is no exploring' hahahahaha
---
Fuck dude, were you born this dumb? Serious question. 
---
Yea, clearly you don't mind grind to get what you want, even when what you want serves no purpose beyond having it. But the thing is, you're an ultra minority and I'm not. I represent a large player base that can make this game last, you represent a player base that is tiny and will basically just move on once you've grinded your way to shiny loot.. because after all, as you claim, that's all there is to do, right? xD
---
What a turd. You get the block, sir.
---
Going by Fallout logic a Glowing Diseased Charred Rabid Bloated Albino would be the most powerful being in existence.
---
Actually the robot thing I saw last night too, on multiple servers.
---
Thanks! Maybe Bethesda might like some of it! (fingers crossed)
---
I'm 36 now and while i do use PA i have taken down 2 SB, both while doing the Brotherhood quests. My build isnt even that great, I'm transitioning from rifles to Shotguns, and i didn't  have too many problems. I noticed killing the adds brings the SB down and from there injust stood and shot it in the face with a com at shotgun until dead. 
---
It's not a conspiracy, it's a question.
---
I had this happen as well, it *appears* to be how it works; but only for wanted players. If two people engage in pvp, even if on a team it won't flag the entire team. 
---
Also another note, the time to flag for pvp is rediculously long. If you accidentally hit someone, they can hit you one or two minutes later, for full damage. 
---
Define normal
---
&gt; Imagine if you got a level 1 two shot handmade out of that rabbit though 
---
Could you imagine how the sale would go down?
---
Person gets all excited, we do the trade, they walk off and later it's like WTF...?
---
Not that that'd happen. Screw those dupers. Even the loose association for LULs isn't worth it.
---
I agree to both those perks as well but probably only the 90% would make it in game so there was still some incentive to walk the wasteland, at least a bit
---
That would be scary AND amazing!
---
Yes they removed legendaries from the game.
---
Oh I haven’t spent real world money on the game lol no reason to 
---
I agree I still have faith in Bethesda but I do fear that FO76 is just a public test realm for main series fallout and ES. Eventually we only get new stuff when they want to figure out how to do it in the next entry of their games.
---
Very nice !
---
Where did you get all those blueprints? ;)
---
There's the door ---&gt; 
---
I wanna make a robot like the mechanist dlc stuff in fo4. Be my slave and carry all my junk
---
The random part is the different encounters you can get. Trust me it isn't easy as it is . Why make it harder? 
---
Interesting. I don't normally kill rabbits, foxes, chickens or frogs but from now on, I will be keeping a closer eye out for that.
---
That’s actually a really cool idea, spread out video tapes that you can find. Or even let it play a slide show of the pictures you’ve taken. 
---
I don’t know about having them give perks while not equipped, I mean the whole point is to limit what a player can do and force more specialaly builds. However, there are a few perks I think you should be able to combine. Normal/Expert/Master hacker/picklock for example. You should be able to combine the three into a single card that costs one perk point. Meaning those who are fine unequipping/re-equipping cards can still do that. But those who don’t want to have to keep switching out can get access to all three for a single perk point. Similar to the (crafting) aspect of perk cards. There should be a single card with the effect (perminantly grants access to all levels of crafting/repair in you possession). So for a single perk you can have access to all tiers of crafting/repair from the cards in your perk page. So it’s not a free thing, but a way to balance it as a more quality of life should you feel like you want to have them always on. 
---
Next patch is on Monday.

What are you talking about? Stash has always had tabs for different categories.

That deserves a big oof

OOF

Could you imagine the fire BSG would get if players then had to load into their own camps?

I've seen a setup where guys will bait bounty hunters- have one asshat player with a bounty on him as bait- somebody comes to collect, then his buddies in PA with stealthboy mods stand up and ambush the bounty hunter who just collected a meager handfull of caps to see if his junk bag is worth anything.  
---
Right between the ap bar the three compass
---
The mod should appear 'relatively' frequently behind the power armor (I got it 2/3 times when I jumped servers).  
---
I will add though that I went there a 'few' times and notice both the power armor and the mod missing, it is possible that it is a 'shared' spawn for all players, but I don't know and won't have a way to verify until I have a friend to find one of the mods with me and see if him picking it up causes it to disappear form me.
---
Yeah OK, we just arguing semantics over semantics. The definition of difficult. 
---
RIP Princess Bride and their ROUS.
---
Maybe I shouldn’t mention that installing mods requires no components....
---
This thing is basically the mutated version of Morrowind's Cliff Racer. 
---
Sorry I play on console so I no brained the response, whatever button brings up the world map. You can see yourself on the map with the wanted icon, and you won't see anyone else. 
---
The way i've found around it is use the "Follow me" emote, then pull out a gun and aim down the sights at the bag. Your character model will bend down toward the item and be pointing the gun right at it.  
---
Hope this helps.
---
What version of Windows are you running?  My two daughter and I play together on PC.  The machines they use are still running Windows 7, but with the latest NVidia drivers.  I have only noticed crashes on their systems.  My Windows 10 machine has way less crashes if at all.
---
Interesting... Do you know if the 'time' is variable for each item, or if it's consistent? In part I won't lie I assumed 24 hours based on the fact that they also do merchants in 24 hour cap regeneration cycles. 
---
Attention must be a hell of a drug, huh?
---
I have over 200 hours and haven't launched one. I don't have any decent guns. Feels a bit like I need a decent gun to kill the mobs that drop decent guns so I'm sort of stuck.
---
*Agrees in Destiny 2*
---
Wow, that sucks. And I've never seen it discussed on this sub.
---
"modded servers" is reliant on what you think will actually be possible on private servers.
---
More than likely mods won't be possible or you will not be able to carry over profiles from "official servers"
---
Again, not claiming to be special about it. Im simply saying don’t be a dick because you don’t know what’s waiting for you in people’s inventories. Wasn’t trying to brag about having a Tse dragon. Lol
---
Sorry you didn’t make it 
---
Nope, sometimes this just happens.  I've cleared whitesprings without a single legendary spawning.  However, make sure you check the corpses, I've seen legendary items on mobs not flagged as legendary.  I've heard that the "diseased" flag overwrites the "legendary" flag, so the mob will still be legendary even if it just says diseased.  
---
Even though some runs I've had zero legendary, I've had other runs where every other mob was dropping legendary items.  No idea why or how.  Just killed, collected, and moved on.
---
How cheap was your college / how much did you sell? JFC. 
---
 You can have my blade of bastet. I don't want it, but kept it for anyone that lost theirs. Add me Deykhal it's yours
---
Stays the until another player kills you. You don't get wanted for shooting someone else, only if you kill someone not in pvp or damage someone's base. 
---
Most wouldn't! &lt;3
---
I saw it once on a vendor, but I can't remember which one. 
---
I didn’t know 
---
Doubt there'd ever be an incentive for nuking the Forest/Grafton as they are beginnerish areas and would just penalize low levels who have no business being in the nuke zones. 
---
Oh in that case it definitely wasn't what happened. I was looking at the world map to decide where to go next when player two killed me.
---
I did queen without hazmat or powerarmor, full robot + leadlined, radshield and the radresist + goulish cards,  had to use some radaway, but its enaugh for nukezones. #provenwrong
---
He was stupid to stay there though. With all his loot and mine, I tripled my springs and aluminum thanks to him! 
---
Y'all motherfuckers need ~~jesus~~ the adrenaline perk.
---
Kill the scorched guys and you do +60% bonus damage for the next 30 seconds. And yes, killing a minion after 25 seconds resets the timer.
---
Well, enjoy your next 25ish hours. Bc the quests run out and so do discoverable locations. Then what you gonna do? 
---
So sorry. Lemme take a minute to give you a super long winded response that really has no point and throw some big words in there so I sound smart while being a passive aggressive shithead. 
---
You want a story driven, immersive gameplay experience. You want quests and missions to occupy your time in game. Fallout isn't that. 150ish hours and you're done with all quests. 170-200ish and you've been there done that with almost the entire map. But if you're like me, and don't mind grinding legendary enemies to get that perfect weapon or piece of gear, none of that bothers you. I enjoy the gameplay, the grind, the excitement of that perfect drop finally happening. 
---
And there's a whole lot of the playerbase grinding legendary enemies right now because that is the END GAME. Grinding activities to get the things and items you want. Not stories. Not quests. Not missions. 
---
Sweet thanks! 
---
That was it? 
---
No I understand what you meant, I'm sorry if I came off as abrasive in that comment it wasnt my intent. All I'm saying is tse a weapons arent as big of a threat in pvp as people think. Normal guns can do just as well in the right players hands
---
Warframe made a pretty penny selling color pallets in their shop... I bought a few. 
---
It's just a joke. These kinds of posts are very common. A massive part of this game is RNG. You can absolutely go through the entirety of watoga and whitesprings without seeing a single legendary. You can do it twice over. It starts going into the realms of statistical improbability if you hop between them 4 times in a row or something without a single legendary. Of course I don't have any numbers to back that up, but I've been through these places so many times that I've gotten a feeling of how spawn rates are. 
---
&gt;level 2
---
too high IQ, can't lower it. Expect by over dosing on fallout 76.
---
Yeah, but only Fisto spawns there... so...
---
The wanted status is to discourage you from unprovoked attacks on other players. If you could just clear it, it would defeat the entire purpose. 
---
Glad he could put a spring in your step!
---
As someone who jumped into this game hoping to unlock lots of plans/upgrades and craft weapons/armour, i definitely agree to the second one. I'm current just hoarding all the guns i can find, but don't know when to stop.
---
Thanks so much!
---
I picked up a quad exploding dbl shotgun and the damage on my TSE dbl barrel shotgun was \~1400-1500.  The damage on the quad exploding dbl shotgun is only \~950, so Two shot does account for a lot more something.  
---
Yeah, it's not the clearest design when it comes to installing mods. It shows you what the mat cost of actually making it would be if you had the plans learned, but if you just have the mod in your inventory, you can slap it on whatever it's for with 0 cost.
---
Whitespring Station Vendor. Its the only Plan sold from that vendor.
---
You just got a QoL upgrade fo' free.
---
It's a joke. At least I laughed.
---
Thanks for this. Had no idea you had to take out the Scorched to get the beasts to land. 
---
They did do a nerf a patch or 2 back that reduced the spawn and quality of legendaries
---
The Whitesprings furniture vendor has tons of stuff.  Maybe look there?   I know he found it but heck...I can’t even remember what plans I have and buy them a second time. I’m actually making a checklist of plans and checking off what I think I have right now. Sick of doing that!
---
Just to troll, you mean. They obviously wouldn't need a player's junk or caps at that point.
---
Yeah all good, neither did I until I actually launched a nuke. Not sure why your comment got downvoted
---
I believe it specifically mentions the Whitesprings, yes, but does not say that it was the only location.
---
Shhh...  I love campfires being ground.  Don’t change it.  
---
I should be home in about an hour. 
---
You sure? Will have to reconsider the Scorched-killer mods
---
An upgraded collector would be better. Have it cost more resources and have a higher power requirement or possibly a kind of maintenance fee. Perhaps costing a couple of gears and circuitry after a certain amount of collected resources as power wouldn’t be much of a cost once you have fusion generators,  but would allow a slightly faster rate of collection in exchange. 
---
You're complaining about getting disconnected twice a day? I get disconnected twice a day just playing WoW. 
---
Oh I know, I have a Ts Black Powder rifle that will one shot players in power armor. It was just the fact he took advantage of my low health after we got done fighting before my healing factor could kick in, and thought he’d make away with all my loot. So I made it quick to demise him. 
---
Well, people can buff thier damage up so much that slap damage is useless. It could have been a super op payer 🤷‍♂️
---
Boy I’m going to miss getting one shot on the extremely rare occasion I bother with PvP 
---
Believe it or not but I've come across legendary eyebots that were level 1 lol
---
My weapon repairs thank him kindly
---
Yes! I don't want to unlock all the paintjobs through the atom shop, it would be nice to have some in game
---
I'd say make the rifle armor pen perk card also working for pistols and the pistol weight reduction perk card also working for rifles!
---
Well, look at The Outer Worlds. It's by the same company who made NV. It's looking good; but time will tell. 
---
Don't expect RPG from Bethesda. 
---
It isnt a rust-esq game thats why there isnt any point
---
What's your GT?
---
Haven't run into this one yet. I avoided Assaultrons out of fear of their beams, but they usually charge up like normal and the crap effectiveness of energy weapons seems to affect them as well so  never take too much damage when fighting them unless I'm stupid and get up close.
---
 Whitesprings has "pretty" items. Always the same items for sale when I go there. It may have been Grahm. 
---
Tabs are on top. Press LB/RB to switch between tabs.
---
Well. I guess it doesn't make my situation any less frustrating, and that is helpful for the future. Well, I'm off to my alt to go on a griefing spree to blow off some steam. Cheers
---
so what do you do when you play then? Because thats all the content there is
---
But what comes from it can ;) 
---
Maybe they will add characters later on. More stories etc ...who knows 
---
I love the base building, collecting plans is my main motivation right now.  I plan on building full budget camps on each of my characters.  As for raiding, I have never been raided, other then players helping themselves to my water and junk extractor (which I encourage).
---
Yeah I definitely wasn't wanted at that point. Also I lost my level's caps, not a multiple of 10 bounty.
---
No pics of your garden?  Where are crops?
---
I'm definitely playing a lot less than I use to because of this issue. Just can't play during US peak times.
---
I'll even stop playing if the servers look a little shaky. Try server hopping to a more stable server (the only time I server hop btw) and if I can't find one after a few attempt, just move on to another game.
---
While I don't expect this to be 100% fixed within the next couple of patches, I hope there are at least vast improvements in this area.
---
Possibly. Or the responder traveling bot I’ve never seen once ever. Lol. Although I think he mainly has cool outfits. 
---
I'll be on a little after 6pm EST I'll send you a message on xbox 
---
lol. Apparently they blocked me. I dgaf tho
---
I've been gone almost 2 months and it doesn't look like they've really fixed much. Most of this sub is still complaining about basic shit that should have been fixed on release. I don't see what 2-3 months more will do.
---
I brought up that I had been having a lot of disconnects in this sub the other day and a user mentioned that he was on  WiFI and never had any issues. 
---
I unplugged my Ethernet cable and I don’t think I’ve had a disconnect in 12 hours of play time where I was guaranteed to get one every couple of hours before on Ethernet. 
---
It seems pretty unlikely that using WiFi actually fixes anything but I’ll know with more playtime if it’s truly making a difference.
---
Hah thanks ))
---
Douche. 
---
Captainoob on YouTube has some pretty good video's on OP Stealth Builds (mainly Stealth + Commando). Able to take out Scorch Beats with a non-legendary lvl 1 auto pipe pistol.
---
I think people just troll for fun. I had a guy way bigger than me destroy my base just to try to get me to shoot back at him. I was maybe lvl 30... So I made that mistake. And learned quickly from it. 
---
Looks like according to the other post itt I had aggro'd his entire team, opening pvp :shrug:
---
I have to disagree. It's a survival type game with base building and exploration. It's pretty much like rust but a bit more simplify. They obviously took some major ideas from rust. 
---
wow guys, no words
---
Ahh, but that's the point. You feel there is justification for the sake of gameplay to do what some would consider a shit move. If I agree or not is pointless, because they don't agree, and it's their game. The "raiders" among the playerbase are not the target audience, the buggers who walk into a creepy church because they feel safe in doing so are.
---
Thankfully, with any luck, the new PVP options will work and the raiders can have their fun as well.
---
Just google “fallout 76 custom ini depth of field fix”
---
You can on Xbox there are no game key / licenses. the thing is the game requires gold (costs $ to Microsoft)
---
I'll forgive you this once for tarnishing the ANGRY marines.  They are not world eaters.  Their mighty ship IDONTCAREYOUNAMETHEDAMNTHING crushing the heretics and pwning the pretty marines. The only thing the codex astartes is good for is wiping arses.   They who are are the keepers of Matt Ward's head.  
---
Thanks a lot!
---
He's on a different forum right now also writing a passive-aggressive "Dear Fuhk\_Ohff or wahtever" post.
---
War never changes.
---
That's why I haven't been playing. The lag and drops are unbearable. Meanwhile, people are sitting making money on eBay selling duped rifles.
---
You’ve clearly never played Final Fantasy X and fought Seymour. 3 fucking times
---
&gt; This feels like a lot more aggressive form, where the AI will go out of it's way to walk up to you to break you out of stealth.
---
Agreed. I'll be stealthed, with high agility and sneak, with a surpressed rifle taking out enemies. They'll magically know right where I am. 
---
There's a pretty big focus on anti-grief mechanics, which are essentially anti-pvp. Dont think we'll ever see much amof a hostile reaction in that regard.
---
Yeah I always pick up everything from corpses, even if I don't want it, just to clear them.  Nada.
---
I have two PS4's at home in the garage/man cave. I purchased FO76 once and just use the 2nd ps4 to login with my main and the primary ps4 to login with my sons account where I made a mule. Great for also getting fast travels points discovered on new characters but I havent started a new char yet.
---
Hmmm. If I can collect 5,000 pounds of stuff in one day, and I first started playing (on PC) on November 1st, then that is roughly 69 days (giggity) and at 5,000 pounds per day that is 345,000 pounds. Ok, nope, no way. Unless that is the only thing you did in the game all day every day.
---
Yay I know but the point is I had 6 orbital strike beacons I could have destroyed his base but I didn't
---
No, actually. I feel there is an immense lack of \*clutter\* decor. A dozen table variants are nice, but pointless without food or flatware or a tea set. Nice, but meaningless, shelves and display cases. There is plenty of cool stuff to unlock, but it feels unlived in most of the time because it's missing the very things that make it a home instead of a shelter.
---
Bloodied super sledge with +40% power attack damage repaired to 200%. If you are wearing unyielding armor as well and have twisted muscles you can do around 2000 damage 
---
I have seen him alive 
---
That is 200% worth it. I'd rather start fresh for a wholesome experience.
---
If it is that way and has 0 limitations like fallout4, any current character build would be broken because the first thing I would do would be to gut (as in add more gut) the current perk cards. %damage boost belongs in the garbage.
---
Now a rad shower that you could exit your power armor in to so you could put on a hazmat suit to actually be able to repair gear or craft ammo would be useful.  Or placed such that you can repair your guns or craft ammo while taking rads but inside the rad shower.  Can you do that?  Otherwise everything is still available in whitesprings.. even a building you can zone in to so you can do all that without getting rads.
---
I have gotten the daily Heart of the enemy to trigger for the last 2 days. But not from the terminal like the wiki said but from a note in the last bedroom on the left, a cross from the power armor station in the BoS area at Fort Definace. Its called Misson 099-01 Orders. Sorry to bump old post but just thought I'd let you know.
---
WEST WIRGINIAAAA!
---
Trapper's camp that's a part of Rose's questline in the Savage Divide has one on top of a wooden crate in the middle of the camp. I picked up a T-45 assisted servo there but only been there once so don't know what else spawns there.
---
Thank you for reading the post and hopefully this will help you in your future endeavors in the wasteland!
---
It's quite aggravating. My game itself crashes almost as much as the servers.People love to blame dupers for server instability, but that doesn't cause other people's entire game to crash. Bethesda's shitastic programming does.
---
I didn't know about this...
---
Its the standard wall piece, you'll want to scroll to the right where it stores the doorway and the windowed/shuttered walls
---
Maybe for the queen?
---
Scorchbeasts do not share animations with the dragons, nor is their skeleton the same.
---
Go to walls, this you should be able to go right on the first one and find a windowed wall and a wall with a doorway 
---
They just need to make it so we can break down legendaries and when we do we are given a token or chip or something of that sort. Then we can apply legendary effects to any weapon or armor we choose and different effects would cost more or less tokens depending on how powerful they are.
---

---
West Virginia...
---
So it's rabbit vs eyebot as easiest legendaries, huh? :)
---
I've heard that it may be tied to armour weight. I.e. Chameleon is "more effective" if you don't wear any armor...but that defeats the purpose. 
---
I'm really considering not using the armor with it. 
---
Go to whatever wall your using, then press left on the dpad to scroll through different types of that wall like one with windows and a doorway
---
Where is this spot?
---
Stealth is OP as fuck, just like all BGS games. I heartily recommend the sneak peek and the stealth attack damage boosting perk of your choice.
---
Also, fit suppressors to your weapons. Enemies don't even react to richocheted shots.
---
Anything far away with a explosive weapon is easy..lol do it with a combat knife
---
try looking in r/fo76bazaar/
---
Before the last patch (which fixed it for me, oddly), I came on one day to find 256 pink flamingos. Every time I logged on, they'd multiply. I ended up having to scrap every single one before they stopped.
---
How? I tried and failed.
---
I feel your pain. I lost a x-01 jetpack the same way!
---
I wouldn't mind it if launching a nuke didnt cost a billion resources and a ton of time.
---
I imagine it's not any weirder than normal, but it is disheartening to see a lot of what goes on.  I'd give FB up entirely, but it's about 50% compulsion and 50% keeping in touch with far-flung family and friends.  I can't defend the former, but the latter is actually a nice feature.  I mostly just post idiotic humor and pictures of my dog, though.
---
Holy shit thank you 
---
At a minimum, it looks like you will be able to use your camp as a vendor station eventually. 
---
Nuke Vault 76: Get players that are complete and total griefing fuck tards... oh wait we get that with out nukes
---
hmmm...your blaming a lvl 31 for your death?   Yea......that makes a lot of sense.  
---
If someone destroys your camp, DO NOT repair it. Just run out of the build zone, drop the camp thingy again, then place it back on its original spot. Your entire base will be in the stored tab in build mode, repaired and all.
---
Costs you 2 x 40 caps but what do ya need those for anyway
---
Wendigo Cave?  They could spawn at the cave entrance.
---
Im so glad these ideas are gaining traction now.  I've seen a handful of good ones get swept under or get "yeah that's cool but they should fix the game first" comments and disappear.  😭
---
If it's by the golf club, it's absolutely getting blown up, if it's in a nice forest by a lake as I walk by exploring, it's absolutely getting blown up.  Happy base hunting yall! 
---
I have a 3* auto grenade launcher that has the 2 shot, damage resist while reloading and I forget the third. It's level 50 and I would sell for a reasonable price if you're interested. 
---
Maybe store your junk before you go to a dangerous area.
---
So something like Fluffy or Mr. Snuggles would have been bad? :)
---
Man so glad as an Xbox user whose only means of playing PC games is on an old laptop used for work is getting PC games for free instead of multiple things I'd rather get in the game I actually purchased!
---
Thanks
---
If it works like Fallout 4, each armor piece with Chameleon is 20% of a Stealthboy. I'm not sure how the mutation works though.
---
I feel like they posted the same text 6 or 7 times already.
---
They worked all the times before just this specific one isnt working
---
Thats what i was on my way to do bud.
---
Just because you have base building and exploration in a game that doesnt make it a rust clone if you think that then fo4 was a rust singleplayer clone because it also had base building and exploration
---
I play the commissar in our squad.  We have a lot of "heretics" and "cowards" and "xenos living filth" my 10mm is running out of execution rounds
---
No.... for taking my loot.
---
I first  killed him with a lvl 5 hunting rifle then pool cue at lvl 10 with a friend. That was fucking hard 
---
b-hole?
---
Max out enforcer so you don't have to hope for cripples, each pellet has a 30% chance of crippling, one is bound to destroy it.
---
I think they should lighten up on the anti-grief mechanic. I like the pvp but it's not fun that I have to shoot back to initiate it takes the immersion from the game. I would like it if they had a more tougher bounty system. Like make the wanted bounty bigger and longer the more you kill or destroy bases. To where you will have a week long bounty that will be a super high price. Then maybe they can add a bounty hunter system. 
---
Maybe have 2 new types... If the original cost 10 energy, do a 18 and 25 or a 15 and 25 have 3 different levels of collection or have the last one quicker and hold more?
---
There's also fallout 76 marketplace now. Might be market not marketplace, not quite sure. 
---
Hmm.. I could have sworn I went through them all, but guessing not!  
---
Thanks - Will have a closer look next time I'm on and hopefully see it this time!  
---
(Unless at Level 8 I'm not allowed it yet ::rollseyes::
---
Some people get into the creation side of things and they only play the game to farm materials to build.
---
My base is 2 buildings... A living quarters and a shop. 3x3 and 2x2 respectively. However my friends have built giant 2-3 story mansions with a bedroom for each of the normal teammates. Do what makes you enjoy the game, I say.
---
As far as raiding a base? Its pretty worthless overall unless you're trying to prove a point. For example two buddies and I witnessed a level 12 catching some flack from a slightly higher level guy. They stole his stuff and ran off to camp with a 50 cap wanted level. One friend followed him, called in myself and another friend, he built walls so we couldn't get to him, so we tore down most of his camp, killed him, took the bounty and the stuff he stole and gave it back to the lower level guy.
---
Does the exclamation mark over your head mean Snake is nearby?
---
How about they use Reddit and be disappointed like the rest of us?
---
When I was farming for combat armor mods there the event kept popping up. I ignored it over and over, then I saw it when I started going into town to check the other vendor so I killed it and got the caps from completing the event, and he also drops caps, so my farming became a little more rewarding and ***eventful***.
---
Actually there is one, it's called "getting killed" Try it 😂
---
I've had that happen before. I find the regular guys drop legendaries anyways.
---
I've also had none of either.
---
I've also had both occur, which wss awesome.
---
I painted it red....it's faster now....I also believe my gun doesn't run out of ammo...so it doesn't 
---
It's not just that it doesn't stack... it also doesn't give you anything you're wearing underneath the PA. It's so counter-intuitive that we should technically be naked under our PA to save weight, I still can't bring myself to believe it.
---
Understand, at reduced weight still 4.8.  Radshield is really good though.
---
I think the standard sledgehammer with the rocket penetrating head and those legendary prefixes does more dmg
---
Sounds like he's got a better survival instinct then you.
---
You do realize saying rust-esq is different then calling it a rust clone....rught?
---
Got a good laugh, thx
---
Oh you're right. I didn't even think about this at all.. Goddamn it. 
---
Some of those dupers with 10k screws have amazing junk bags.
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
There are about 8 spawn points, plus the two vendors. 
---
Coming out of TotW, there’s the craft station on right and left. Grab the 27 (3 dangly can “traps”) while there. 
---
Proceed to the fire arena, and just before it the nook on the left with the armor crafting table has  a plan spawn point. 
---
Grab the 27 (3 dangly can “traps”) while there. 
---
From there turn around to face back towards TotW and head right *before* the shack with the last spawn point. The road splits into 3 - high ground road going right, road to a house going left, road to stall alley and arena center. Go center (or go high, grab the 27 (3 dangly can “traps”) while there, and then go back to the center fork). 
---
Down this alley.
---
First stall on the left has a weapon crafting table, a weapon plan/mod spawn next to the table and a wide-range house plan spawn *under the table*. The weapon plan has kept giving me good stuff long after I scrapped a million of everything. 
---
Further down, after the chem table, on the right, will be a weapon mod spawn point.
---
Note on the left the raider armor spawns often (and differently to other places like Camden) at L15 and quite consistently so, making it a great place to farm PA parts for low level alts. 
---
Further down the alley, last two stalls on the left and right both have armor modding tables. And 3 armor plan spawn points. Trapper torso and torso ultra-light often spawns here. (Other trapper ultra-lights spawn on grafton/Morgantown train responder station vendors, just fyi, I needed them and couldn’t find them for a long time). 
---
We’re not done! 
---
Proceed further past the stalls - the road will go right to a diner or left to 4 bungalows with a monster mob spawn. Head left. The bungalow are arranged 1 to your left at 9 o’clock, a locked one at 10 o’clock, one with a weapon crafting table at 11 o’clock, and a fourth behind the third. The weapon table has a plan spawn point next to it. 
---
PRO tip: place CAMP on the cliff behind the fourth building where the mole rats are or a bit further out of sniping range of the baddies that spawn down below. Make every trip home a full TooW end to end run, starting with the rail merchant and ending at home, or vice versa. 
---
Throughout this run, other than lead from the 81 lead for 9 mouse clicks, you’ll also find a metric shit ton of pipe weapons (great to scrap for cork), around 80 or so aluminum in the form of ski poles, around 30 fiberglass (cork and fiberglass are very useful if you’re stashing a lot of legendaries by modding them to be ultra-light) and maybe 20 or so recipe spawn points. 
---
Both vendors spawn raider, T45, T51 and Excavator mods. I’ve outfitted my entire team with L15 cal-shocked raider, L25 early days cal-shocked Excavator with reactive plates, and L45 maxed cal-shocked excavator with emergency Protocols, all with targeting HUDS, from here. 
---
The rail merchant is also a good place to pick up offloaded legendary items. 
---
One last tip: the train spawn point is a **griefer** spawn point (I won’t be generous enough to call these scumfucks “raiders”) who try to kill you using tiny damage increments while you’re loading. Arrive with more than 1 health point (and a full magazine in your hotkeyed bloodied handmade). 
---
You’re welcome. I got a good amount of loot! 😂
---
It looks so cool! Bravo, great idea!
---
You go through the blast zone to get to a stash?
---
I liked the Division's bounty system when it came out. It's a lot like Fallout, but had a bit more flesh into it. Had 30 minute firefights trying to defend a roof top with your buddies while everyone in the server  was trying to kill you.
---
Well i mean that is easy to. I dont use explosive weapons. Believe me I couldnt make it hard if I wanted too
---
Exactly.
---
Err diablo was not like that for over a year
---
Happens A LOT on PS4.  The lower levels will watch and wait then go in for scraps.  Issue is, those scraps, are usually dead people’s junk.  They should give you a 2-3m time frame in which your dropped loot is only available for you to see before going public.  
---
The shown level has absolutely no bearing other than to act as the multiplier for health per level. This value is unique to most Npcs, the same as their base health stat. Assaultrons likely have a huge base HP stat with supplementing resistances, but a modest hp/level because of their low level. This gives them the illusion of being weak.
---
Total HP = Base health + (per level HP * level)
---
There's more to the equation if they are assigned perks or have hp regen.
---
I meant more that pipes benefit from pistol and rifle damage perks
---
I've seen it multiple times. I've seen the bug where a bunch of protectrons spawn instead of ghouls. I've seen 3 or 4 legendaries at once. From what I've noticed going through some places over and over again, it seems like some locations have a given chance for certain individual(s) to be legendary and it's a roll for each one. In other places it seems like each enemy can potentially be a legendary. I don't think I've ever seen any place that GUARANTEES one outside of events like scorched earth or hordes. Although with how many ghouls there are at the golf club and how many can potentially be legendary, it's probably far above 95% to find at least one
---
Hrm, that seems kind of rough. I don't think stealth is worth the DR loss. 
---
Yeah they fixed it last patch but Bethesda being Bethesda they made this new bug happen when they fixed the last.
---
They're asking if it's happened more than once.  If it's always happening, etc.. obviously
---
i work in a cubicle...
---
I get it dude im just saying that just because 2 games have different features doesnt make them anything-esq because im sure rust wasnt the first one to implement those features into a multiplayer game
---
You know theres a stash at the train station next to whitespring right? Just fast travel there and put your junk in
---
The amount of times I see someone flailing for help after being taken down and thinking “if I don’t stimpack them, I can have all of their delicious junk for free. Just imagine all those screws, oil, and aluminium...” and I must admit every time I get tempted. But then I stimpack them anyway. I tell myself it’s because I won’t have the carry weight to haul it all back to a station or my camp, but I think it’s because I’m just nice.  :(  GOD DAMN YOU NICENESS! FIRST YOU TAKE AWAY ROMANTIC POSSIBILITIES AND NOW YOU TAKE MY JUNK! Wish I was a badass instead D:
---
In his defense the game glitches enough for you to die without even seeing a enemy, just a FYI.  Not sure if your playing the game or trolling, but deaths happen and not always the players fault.  Like when dickheads shoot the cars your standing next to 😉
---
Cheers pal.
---
But they got Helvetica almost completely perfect.
---
But no Tudors.
---
I've heard this exact sentiment from so many people in other different games and I still think that it's bs. Preface patches/previews with "subject to change" and when people bitch it won't matter because whether you do talk in depth or not people will bitch at least give some information.
---
Very Clean 
---
You can't fast travel to an area in a nuke zone, but you can easily place your camp behind the golf club and easily waddle over there within 20 seconds any time you need to.  Just put on a hazmat suit before entering your power armor, so you can exit without dying.
---
Damn schorched are worse for me those damn guns hit hard for me it seems
---
Snuggles would of been the best choice at hand.
---
Ryu hyabusa812
---
Also, fun tip: if you disable both laser arms on a Protectron, run; it will start winding up and eventually go kaboom!  But this does mean it only takes two shots from a [Enforcer perked] shotgun to kill a Protectron.
---
I also feel like the budget is a little small. Maybe it's just me. But I know for sure turrets eat up way too much of the budget. 
---
Yeh I dunno why some get disconnected so often. Im not saying theyre lying, just my experiences are like yours. I was on last night for about 4 hrs- 1 disconnect at the very end.
---
triggered fankid
---
Good for you
---
Maybe there is, maybe there isn't justification. I'm not saying I want a raider or not, but it could make for some interesting interactions. As it stands, there are protections, but if Bethesda goes down the route of allowing players to be more of a raider, there probably needs to be safe areas and PvP areas, or some other sort of mechanic. It's a tough topic to discuss because where one player is having fun, they are making another player's life shitty. 
---
I don't mind if they never go the route of allowing people to go full on raider, but whatever happens, needs to be addressed carefully. 
---
I think they should be treated as they are at the moment up until you’re level 50, maybe even later to five you something to work for, but after that, yeah, it’s really flipping irritating.
---
Maybe if every 10 levels are level 50 you could choose one perk card to be always active. 
---
Walking cap stash.
---
LOL! I'm actually Texan!
---
I lost my set of excavator the same way. Put in a ticket and they said they couldn’t do anything 
---
This has been suggested before and it's a great idea.
---
No one in their right mind is going to pay 4 caps per bullet.
---
What is your user ill add you im on usualy 6pm to 10 on weekdays im unable to get on from 5pm to 5pm friday to saturday and normaly online saturday to sunday (mst)
---
I got Jetpack mod and x01 Calibrated Shocks I can sell you for the low cost 4000 caps.
---
Catch is I will not be back on to after 8pm est.
---
Yeah I am, but its still usefull to have a hazmat suit under as backup in nuke zones:)
---
Everybody knows deathclaws are just misunderstood and want to cuddle, look at them reaching for a hug and tell me it doesn’t look inviting. Not they’re fault they got all fucked up from radiation and who are we to judge.
---
Probably rad-x if your took any. It suppresses mutation affects.
---
Right the worst fallout game of them all new vagas 
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
So what's up with the metal columns then?
---
I think waiting it out should work. The time needed to wait it out should be proportional to the bounty and reset if you repeat an offense while having a bounty. Given that there's no debuff, it seems fair. All you do is live on edge for a while since anyone can kill you now.
---
Well I do get loot then. Granted that it's your generic loot that animals/bots/scorched drop, but loot nonetheless
---
I got totally wrecked the other day trying to register my new Excavator set. Got kicked from the server I was on. Logged into a new one. Trekked back, LV26 assaultron camping the registration room. Couldn't dodge the spam. 
---
Could they have been affected by radaway? I think that takes them for a short time
---
My best drop ever was off a legendary stingwing at Whitespring. Explosive combat rifle (not two shot). 
---
Lol, sorry.  When I saw ANGRY MARINES my mind went right to Angron. XD
---
Ah. Yeah I definitely took rad-x. It was a nuke zone afterall. Suppression even with starched jeans? Huh guess I'll have to watch out for that. 
---
Each for 4K or both of them?
---
Seems pointless.  Having a rad suit on is a good practice.  I guess if you never leave the club house and go near the fire station or maintenance building or inside the hotel you might not ever see a workstation though.
---
Stop crying nerd and deal with it.
---
Do you think this person  will ever see this message?
---
I don't need them to reimburse me PA, I need them to fix their AAA beta.
---
My opinion is that they should remain in the game; we need something to make the game even remotely difficulty. As a game 76 is by far the easiest of every single Fallout game ever made; difficulty for the most part is a joke to any player who has  experience with any difficulties over easy. Scorchbeasts are a necessary evil of which we need more of wandering the wastes, yes their attack animations for spam needs to be fixed, their visuals shouldn't be as bright and their drops should be improved.
---
   People struggling with them wiping out their CAMP shouldn't be living in the territories of the alpha predators if they aren't prepared for them. If you are afraid of the angry flappy bois then you should go live in the Forest, Toxic Valley and Ash Heap regions and hide from them. For those who want to live in the territory of these giant bats do know they will target any foreign presence in their area and they are extremely territorial. Anything below brick will not survive a bat encounter; people using wood are signing up for their CAMP to be destroyed and are stupid to even live in the region. I can't really feel bad for the players not playing it smart when it comes to locations they live and they structures they build; you have to take that portion of building seriously if you want to survive. (None of this pertains to players with god like TSE weapons because the game is joke to you already).
---
I’m not tryna blame the guy its just that the fact that he just waited for me to die out n yanked my shit was a real dick move
---
4k for 2 x01 Calibrated Shocks and Jetpack
---
Message me Gt themisterphenix 
---
I like to use them to offload spare ammo. Quad targeting missile launcher does wonders against these flying bastards. Also pretty sure somebody mentioned it in the 700 comments already, but they do rarely drop prime receiver plans. 
---
If you get a hazmat suit you can jump around all you want but dont get hit by anything.
---
Got me a bloodied lever that will down the thing in 5 poorly placed stealth shots. Less for headshots.
---
That said, I gotta be at 10% health and the thing could one shot me at any given point.
---
But I got a dragon that gets the job done in 2 hits. If it was a 2 shot dragon I'm assuming it would kill it instantly, but I'd need someone to do the math for me on that.
---
Are you fucking serious? Broooo... Noooo...
---
I was there, it was bad. Completely unplayable like NV was. Disconnects were present for me and the lag was horrible. I could at least play FO76. 
---
Also this entire thread. No way they aren't already aware those two games are releasing soon. Pretty sure the uppers have already had that discussion with it without the dev team directly/indirectly.
---
That sounds like a good idea. But maybe have a caveat that they can only be repaired by that perk as well. So if you take someone’s workshop or the owner logs out so it becomes unclaimed, the resource collectors remain there fully functional until the point they are destroyed. At which point they cannot be repaired unless you have the skill. It would incentivise people trying to claim workshops, but also force people to also defend them properly. 
---
Idk, that’s why I said I hope he does and put his psn in the title.
---
What about them? 
---
I'm pretty sure the standard sledge with it's best mod doesn't do as much damage as a normal super sledge  
---
That auto-scrap feature is dangerous AF. I've more or less stopped using it, or don't hit it until I've gone through the Junk and Mods tabs to be sure nothing I want to keep is going to vanish. Then some items it clearly ignores, Deathclaw Hand for instance doesn't seem to always auto-scrap, and I'll find them in my Junk tab, but when it was the only thing in my inventory it scraped. 
---
Seems like it scraped some flux ingredients I had just spent a bit of time farming. That was the last time I hit that button all nimbly-bimbly. 
---
They could easily just make vendors carry the same stock across all servers.
---
Awesome thank you, I'll add it with asterisks until verified. 
---
Big talk
---
Yep this is my run, from the train station, up the hill take out everything in that first part of the ski resort, head to the back, take out everything in that little bazaar area, clean out the main lodge, the 3 cabins in the back, the single cabin behind those. double back to the 3 cabins and use the weapon workbench to break some stuff down, head back to the top of the world and clear out the mezzanine, once that is done use the tinker bench there(since its NOT connected to my stash) to bulk up everything. 
---
all in all its about 30 min to an hour to complete and i walk away with about 800lbs of bulk junk, plans and ammo at the end of it. 
---
for the first half of it im running though everything and the 2nd half im using a really jacked up AP regen to keep mobile with encumbrance.  
---
No problem my dude. 
---
We gotta rebuild together!! 
---
I thought if you use someone else camp u get a wanted bounty
---
Bro. I had a dude show up at monster mash (I just farm xp and candy) he hit me so I killed him. He had bulk junk for days. I could sense the panic in his avatar as he was running back to see if I took his stuff. I've never received a heart emoji that felt so genuine when he saw I didn't take his shit. Lol. 
---
John Denver deserves better than 76. I’m sure hes rolling in his grave
---
Wait... are we taking some sort of new G.O.A.T.?
---
More people need to see this :D
---
Use Radshield or diluted Rad x to avoid this
---
It takes a lot longer than 20 seconds to go into the resort when you're over-encumbered.
---
First day this is implemented everyone would be placing a underground hallway to clip into the restricted areas of the space station.
---
He was cremated and his ashes scattered in the Rocky Mountains
---
&gt; it is annoying that my food spoils so easily  
---
Cooked food should last longer before spoiling baseline. It's insane that thoroughly burnt meats and literal boiled vegetable soups spoil in less than one in-game day.
---
Now excuse me while I drink 13 bowls of soup to sustain myself for the next hours.
---
If Rust has the system down, I recommend playing Rust.  I personally hate the game.  It's a toxic hole.  That said, I do hope the PVP'ers/Raiders get their own servers where they can go Lord of the Flies on each other.  I would just prefer to not be a part of it.
---
Me too. I don't understand how OP got to level 109 and is just now complaining about this. It doesn't seem nearly as bad as it used to be. I think many of the dupers got bored and left.
---
Psst, he’s not gonna read this. And even if he does, there’s a hundred nukes everyday with a hundred people losing their loot like this.
---
Stash your junk next time so you don’t make a fool of yourself for these kind of posts.
---
My experience on PC is that there's two options, one to block for session, one to permanently block.
---
DON’T YOU DARE SAY THAT! IF I EVER FIND A DISTANT RELATIVE OF GARVEY I AM GOING TO NUKE THEM TO HELL AND BACK! I WILL SAVE THE WASTELAND FROM THAT MENACE!  People always say “if you could go back in time to kill Hitler, would you?” And THIS, THIS is that moment!
---
 It'd be optional. 
---
Playing on Xbox One. 
---
Gamertag is Roostermule.
---
Since mid-December, every time I log into the game, my audio plays for a moment, then disappears. I have to go into the Settings tab, go to Audio, change the voice chat settings to “auto” and then back to “none” for my in-game audio to go live again.
---
Permanently blocking them avoids joining their server.
---
This is too farmable and not enough RNG.
---
pft to be honest im ready for them to give them what investors really want and just add budget boosters to the ATOM shop.
---
the kid in me screams oh noes, but the adult in mean that works 12 hours a day and has to deal with squeakers killing me with TSE gauss rifles doesnt care anymore. 
---
Vaults are already all dead. Don't get your hopes too high. :/
---
I have a 2 star minigun. "Furious" dmg increase with consecutive hits and +25% fire rate. It seemed too good to sell at a vendor but I have no use for it so it's just been sitting in my stash box
---
No thanks. I carry junk.
---
Yes. You even kill your teammates. I don’t think we even had to turn pacifist off.
---
Again, if you never leave the clubhouse.. if you already go up there for the rest of the spawns (there are actually more than just in the clubhouse) you walk buy multiple workbenches.
---
May be if we ask them Nicely 
---
You gotta preempt the ghouls and start blindly punching in the air! They have chameleon mutation for a while before they appear
---
You sure im not much into melee builds just saying bc in fo4 it was the highest dps weapon
---
There was the cellar in Sanctuary Hills for fallout 4 that worked like this.
---
They're a bit twitchy and weird(like everything else in this game.) I think the trick is that they line up on the outside of floors, but I'm not sure. 
---
It makes sense to keep the weight reduction perks as they are though. You have to choose between utility and combat effectiveness. Crafting isn't performed in combat so it doesn't make sense to force the player to choose between the two.
---
Bethesda is a joke 
---
IT joke about having test and production environments, because IT typically just deploys it to production because "it should be okay". 
---
Yep, most good decor is atom store locked, and even that is really boring.
---
I'm not particularly interested in being forced to spend real money just to add some flair to my C.A.M.P
---
They are not multi platform. Find an article where it is.
---
I can't wait to come up some woman in game and tell them they need to "take my junk" and then flash the heart emote.
---
No? I'm a sneak rifleman build but I kill them with a combat knife because they're too weak to waste bullets on. 
---
Look into armor piercing. I think you'll see an improvement.
---
OMG that would really make me upset!  I put 1000 .45 ammo down for someone last night and 5 missiles.  All they could see was missiles.  I looked and sure enough they disappeared.  not the normal fall through the map disappear because the bag was there and showed the missiles but not the .45.  and it was gone from my inventory as well.  not over encumbered or running anything unique.  just odd 
---
True, i like that idea. Does that work with the current turrent system they have in place. If it is that might just be easy to program and place in the game as is
---
How much .556 do you have?
---
Oh man, this is nice! Where did you find the plan for brick?!
---
All of this to a T.
---
If a higher level player is nearby or was near by the enemy’s scale to the higher level. That’s why you are seeing 40+ enemies.
---
Yup, and I think that's also part of WHY they want to work on perk cards for this patch on monday as alot of folks are rather unhappy with the implimentation of the perk card system, it's a good idea on paper, but the implimentation of it leaves alot to be desired
---
I have a melee build and I'm pretty positive I compared the 2 when I 1st got a super sledge. 
---
Fair i guess for balance reasons, i can agree on the duration and crafting perks though, even the Fast Travel perk could be nice being lumped in, just quality of life improvements since swapping cards is so tedious
---
Gary is such a clone name
---
Well I didn’t know that. Cool cool
---
ps4
---
Hmm..
---
Is there any way to check what you can make, just short of entering the armor/weapon/whateversmith and trying to upgrade each weapon?
---
Just announce what you’re working on! 🤦‍♂️
---
I love the game but keeping us in the dark over and over is a big disappointment 
---
I agree with you about rust but imo Bethesda is a bigger development company then facepunch studios so Bethesda has more resources then the other they could if they wanted to get a better system 
---
Try logging out and then logging back in to switch servers. 
---
I find that level ranges vary a lot by server
---
I thought they added a depth of field slider to the game itself under the settings in the menu. I'd look there first. :)
---
Ya...just SOMETHING different at this point.
---
Good point, but this is informative.  What's your platform?
---
Leave mutants alone you monster, we are people too. We might be crazy running, flying, disease spewing, electrically charging, thick skinned maniacs but we have feelings too...
---
:P
---
You gotta spend real money for that.
---
Sadly no, it took me a while to get all my stuff down. But after I did keeping it up is easy
---
If they die outright then I’ll wait 5 minutes to see if they come back to reclaim it, and nab it if they don’t. If I can see them running back on the map and I have to go elsewhere (defending a workshop or something) then I’ll dump a few things in their bag. Weapons/armour if it’s level appropriate or if I have extra stims then those too. They probably don’t realise that I added them, but it’s kind of a “sorry I wasn’t here a few seconds sooner to help” 
---
Question, is there a mobile version?
---
I have a level 10 two shot bolt action pipe rifle. Still using this as main weapon... (Level 70)
---
On the plus side.. most meat piles can have hardened mass in them regardless if you were around to tag the mob.  
---
Yaaaaaaas 
---
I was out of town when the black PA skins were on sale and now I am sad.
---
Do the Heart of the Swamp event, Strangled Grafton Monster that takes 3 explosive shotty shots and that's with all perks and and anti-armor
---
FUCK
---
I think this is spot on.  Haven't all the official fixes and some hotfixes addressed server stability?  
---
I usually go several hours without one, then have one or two.  They do seem more common, now, even though I'm not sure.  
---
They really hurt when you've grabbed a couple Workshops.
---
That was a fun system the tension you had when you were waiting on the helicopter knowing that any moment shit can hit the fan
---
Awesome, thank you, and much appreciated, going through doing an update right now to the Top of the World, although I might just split it into Top of the World and Pleasant Valley Cabins to make it fit better with the rest of the post. 
---
Outside of Far Harbor maybe. Once Far Harbor dropped you could get a supersledge called Atom's Judgment that did (i believe) 500 base damage between physical and radioactive/energy damage. With all the added perks for melee, there was nothing that I couldn't one shot.
---
I am in the passive til fight back mode, and here I will stay.  I'm not some brainless child with a walkthrough in one hand and no idea in the other.  I'm just not stupid enough to think my level 56 could put a scratch on their 150+ and I'm not in the habit of doing stupid things.
---
You don't put points into card ranks, you put them into your SPECIAL attributes. Increasing the rank of a perk card doesn't use any of your SPECIAL points, it just merges the two cards into one higher ranked card.
---
Yes, on PS3 we push down on L3.  The problem is that some of the great stuff is down menu and over to one side or another.  I forget to go through it all.
---
The irony is that I spent all that time with workshops to GET this stuff only to completely blank that I had it.
---
Your reminder will be great for others who didn't know.  Because it sucked to see great stuff in the menu and NOT be able to build it.
---
Yeah i didnt remember that weapon
---
Right. In the Division there was a PVP zone, so that's a key difference. 
---
Anything beats the whole everyone is dead thing. It’s so lame. You can’t give a shit about any of the “characters” in the game because they aren’t alive so why bother. 
---
Rads aren't bad in the excavator power armor. You can also take glowing blood packs for extra rad resist. 
---
While I agree that turret-only platforms can be an annoying hinderance at the Whitespring Club House, if they include workstations, they then have their occasional benefit, providing a support platform.
---
To you point of the "commie f\*ckers"..."hog\[ing\] our hard earned loot" -- this would actually be more "American." Finding a way to obtain the same output with next to no effort. :) It is far more akin to communism to assume that everyone be delegated / allotted their equal share.
---
*slowly hides his "congrats on getting laid" balloon
---
Oh! Hey!  Yeah man....take a break and come back after awhile...
---
Probably base damage. Tehe, interestingly, the binoculars have a damage rating of 1. I manged to kill a creature with the binoculars...it was pretty amusing. I also killed something with the flare gun.
---
Just make sure you keep an eye on patch notes for future content updates. 
---
Yes, but most of those games didn't start with the level of comunication that they currently have, and BSG haven't ever done an online or multiplayer game before (Softworks has published some, but BSG is a single player focused studio so they are having to relearn alot of things, that's also why they've started puting up listings for positions that seem like they are primarily to round out their current shortcomings on the 76 team when it comes to what they are experienced with).  Fortnite also is a bit of an outlier, at least with the primary use of the game now (the battle royal bit) bringing in millions of dollars a month.  They can afford to have a much larger team with much more experience with that type of model then BSG currently has to work with, without crippling teams for other games.
---
To date the Inside the Vaults have stated what they are working on, what to expect in the future, and being their way of, more openly saying, 'yes we know about issue x and are working on it'
---
Nothing to do but wait. Its indefensible but not irredeemable. 
---
Everyone would be scoping everyone. You didnt want to be the first to go because you might be the first to die.
---
Some fun stuff.
---
LIES, YOU ARE DANGEROUS TO HUMAN KIND.
---
Power armor can last 20 levels without any bug.  It's just durable.  If you're bugged, it just auto-repaired it's self, then broke right about when it would have broken anyway.
---
Thanks!! You are a true Responder. I just log to reddit to ask for this locations. 
---
Thank you for your TLDR.
---
It is illegal to profit from the sale of someone else’s intellectual property (IP). They could easily face criminal changes if Bethesda could be bothered, although with a few thousand in sales I doubt it would be worth it.
---
232 and you couldnt server hop watoga a few times for these plans? I hope you're not late to that party.
---
Follow the overseer’s journey and go from there. Capture one or more workshops when you log in and do the defense events. Keep an eye out for valuables and junk, especially clipboards. Pretty much play it like any other Fallout game. Turn on passive mode if you want to avoid accidentally shooting other players. 
---
If you sell to them, they get back i think 20% of the value so you can sell more.
---
No, no it won’t. 
---
You know how many times I got dropped from pubg? 
---
2 minutes and I’m back in the game, with my friends. 
---
There are games with loading screens longer then the time it takes me to get back. 
---
Diluted Rad-X does not suppress mutations. 😉
---
Well, they've claimed they are revamping the PVP system, which I think means they are going to screw it up for part of the folks here.  Having different servers based on whether you want coop/pve or pvp would be a straightforward way to do it.  Then, on a pvp server, your base would be a smoking hole regularly...even better if folks could steal your stash.  
---
PVE folks could have their shops and fancy camps while just worrying random encounters popping up.
---
Don't try to balance SPECIAL stats. Pick the one that supports your chosen weapon type and maximize. Else, you'll struggle.
---
I don’t believe so. I think anything can be repaired by anyone regardless of if you’re the right level or have the plans for it. I know I’ll randomly patch up people’s bases if they’ve had water pumps or collectors broken, and fix up turrets if I happen to be wandering by and stumble on their camp. 
---
They need to make explosive and two shot under the same class. Shouldn't be able to have both. Definitely  not on shotguns at least.
---
Great post.
---
Works inversely as well, I was finally able to kill all 10 Golfer Ghouls because a low level had reached The Whitesprings. I didn't think I'd ever complete that stupid quest on my main. 
---
Good luck. Most of us oldy moldies are over on PC.
---
Yep. Happens literally everyday with my wife and I.  
---
Also, when the teammate visual glitches are going on, you can't trade either. When they are invisible, there's no way to accept the trade request. When they are partially in power armor / partially stretched out, the menu glitches when you try to accept the trade.  
---
Also fun: having to use the arrow keys to navigate the social menu when sending/accepting team requests because if you right-click the submenu disappears unless you move the cursor through a very specific path to the desired option.
---
@OP I found light robot chest in harpers ferry plan spawn
---
Even worse, I am fairly sure that hardened mass, glowing mass and high-radiation fluids (possibly some other nuke zone loot as well) are not instanced loot. So you're only seeing them on meat piles because someone else didn't loot it.
---
Here's hoping that crash fixes are on the list of fixes coming next week. I can't even log in on any of my characters anymore.
---
I agree that it's not good and it is most definitely a violation of the ToS but I don't think it's *illegal* which means it would probably be subject to arbitration.
---
[From the ToS:](https://bethesda.net/en/document/terms-of-service) "YOU AND ZENIMAX EACH AGREE THAT ... ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ... WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT."
---
Technically ZoS could sue them in small claims court, I guess, but I doubt it would be worth their time and I'm not even sure if they're legally entitled to the money that the Ebay sellers made.
---
 Who even came up with the idea of wiping everyone's characters?
---
You're asking people to not be a dick to you, but judging by the majority of your responses, you're the real asshole here LOL 
---
I did this once and felt bad, so I let the lower levels tag first before one-shotting the enemies with my legit TSE. But man, reading this makes my blood boil. Makes me not want to be nice anymore when people think they're entitled to it. I worked hard to max out all my cards to become a one-shot god. And if that's how I want to play, I goddamn will. 
---
Depending on the build, a level 40-50 could definitely beat a level 100+. The only advantage of being over level 50 is having access to more cards and maybe playing longer so having some better items, but All-Rise is still one of the best weapons and it's a free quest reward. And I thought you were talking about invisible mobs. I also get attacked by them, but I just spin around and swing my weapon and they die.
---
I think the game has already lost a lot of players  - at least that's my impression of what I see on the map lately.  :(  
---
I honestly wouldnt care if the loot was meh, so long as the fight was fun.
---
"START" to loose players lol.
---
Wow dude...
---
:)
---
Yes. Ask someone to do it. Most people will if they know it’s for a good cause. Someone at Whitespring was begging people to kill him. Made a quick 100 caps. 
---
Deal 
---
Connection speed doesn't cause bluescreening. And I've got the fastest connection ping and bandwidth I can get in my urban area and have the issues mentioned above. Everyone wants to blame the individual and not the game.
---
Don't worry, there's TONS of camp decor in the Atom Store!
---
Can't remember off the top of my head. Probably a ton. I'll let you know when I log in later.
---
Oh you're the type who claims everyone dupes. Got it.
---
Good to know.
---
we did it reddit! we ruined the best part of the game!
---
Add me txcowboy69 always down for a new friend and my girlfriend plays on mine rarely but still sometimes, if you're looking to play with more women.
---
Sure, I can elaborate.
---
So, caps having no values = dupes having no value.
---
On the one hand, you have people selling dupes that want no caps in exchange (yeah, probably they are capped on them, probably they want another item for the build, who knows). There’s one case of dupes having value while caps don’t.
---
On the other hand, people selling dupes for irl money. No caps involved there. That’s another case of what I said above.
---
You can make caps worthless, sure. You’ll take dupes out of the cap market. That’ll work for some time and after that, dupes will probably be even more valuable due to no one taking caps for them but specific items instead.
---
All in all, dupers probably stopped caring about caps long ago. Why bother going for them when they are already losing value (seeing as not so many people want then nowadays) or when you could sell your dupes for actual money?
---
If anything, a wipe would be perfect for the economy of the game. Sure, many people would lose everything. Hell, I own a couple TSEs and even a paint job that can’t be acquired yet; would I mind losing them? If it means fixing all this mess, not at all.
---
Then again, this is pointless if BGS doesn’t fix the dupe issue completely; can’t really expect them to fix it without creating new dupe glitches at the same time.
---
Sorry for the long wall of text, just wanted to get the point across.
---
What? No? You choose a special stat, then you can cycle through the categories of cards. You choose one from any catagory, the point is invested, and you get the card. If you already have that card, you can get it again, and you can choose to rank it up if you want. You get a card pack at level 4,6,8,10, and then every 5 levels after that. Forever. 
---
If there is a “x2” under a card, you can combine them, even outside of your level up. You can only equip perks that total to your stat for the special category. 
---
This is another issue...I'm never going to buy any of the "one day only" promotional items. It just seems exploitative to me. 
---
The same way. When you logged in to Fallout 76 on PS4, they would have asked you for an email and password for a Bethesda account. Follow the steps and use that username and password on the launcher.
---
Missing: Wall/Cieling Turrets, white picket fences, laser gate doors, metal handrails, greenhouses walls, air turrets, stairs that don't suck..
---
If we could get all of the Fo4 stuff that's lore friendly in here too that'd be great. Please Bethesda, don't put Fallout 4 stuff in the atomic store... Just port and patch them in.
---
Does the jerky at least stay fresh longer than other foods?
---
Yeah i have a power armor rack on the roof...
---
I don't know if you have access to Sneak and Escape Artist but that will help in those situations. I used it to escape when I couldn't handle them when my bullets did practically no damage and they wouldn't land to let me hit them.
---
Good tips. I usually just shoot it out of the sky, but good to know how to force a landing.
---
Hey u/LoneVaultWanderer or u/LadyDevann 
---
First love the communication from Beth even if its really vague lol...
---
Just wondering if we will get more information and a detailed post regarding the use of exploits. From the vault it seems the intention is to patch them. But nothing on how they intend to fix the multiple issues that spawned from it. Also would be really great to know what kind of punishment will be handed out for them as well. The vault is so vague it seems like they get off with no blow back at all.
---
If we could get just a little more information i would seriously be over the moon. Thanks heaps and i just want to say i reall y appreciate all the work you two do here.
---
1.  With the release of player vendors, how will Bethesda deal with the abundance of duped items that have ruined the player trade?.
---
2. What punishment can we expect for those that abused exploits both for real world gains and to gain unfair advantages in game?. Considering how Beth went about reshade and cheat engine users while leaving these lot untouched.
---
3. What is been done to address future exploits?. By this i mean in the way of hot fix addresses and system changes.
---
Thanks guys
---
Jokers
---
If you put turrets on the roof, they’ll hardly ever break due to zombies or molerats. 
---
Exactly my thought when 3 scorchbeast was trying to kill me earlier today. 
---
But HOW do you permanently block someone?
---
I have several thousand of shotgun and 10mm. Happy to trade for caps, .556, &amp;.45
---
The same butthurt guy who refuses to buy and TSE off Reddit and bitches about poor RnG
---
Man, I would have LOVED to see that. Don't suppose you captured a clip of it did you?
---
The ammo factory is probably the only real acceptation to my general viewpoint, for sure...and that one with the three lead deposits for the same reason. 
---
Most of them produce more easily acquired materials that you don't need in such volumes. 
---
New vegas was developed by Obsidian.. might be related
---
I’m also looking for a cheep one do to me not having to many caps.
---
Are you just looking for a standard melee with bleed? Or something legendary? I might be able to assist. I too am on PS4, and plan to be online at some point tonight. Same username as here... 
---
Then I gotta stop selling the stuff! Hah. Can I stack them? I've never tried, I always stack one of each different chems.
---
It's possible that there are two types with two ID's.  I found an old post where someone else said their royal jelly was in their junk tab.  If you've noticed a lot a things you find inside Whitespring Resort are pre-war versions without rads.  For example if you find Sugar Bombs there they won't have any rads if you eat them, but if you find Sugar Bombs anywhere else they have rads when you eat them.  There are recipes that call for Sugar Bombs and ONLY the ones with rads will work in the recipe.
---
I'll look for that box and see if if it has one.
---
I said above - there should be two options, one to block for session and one to permanently block.  I'm on PC but i don't think it should be different.
---
Says that account doesn't exist. Mine is totally_ratical if you want to give that a try :)
---
With a full set of unyielding bos heavy armor, serendipity and dodgy I can take glancing shots from tse guns but still die point blank
---
Nuka-Cola had a promotion just before the war that allowed caps to be used as cash with participating outlets.  All the WhiteSprings robots were programmed to accept Nuka-Cola caps, the manager was having a pink fit over it in a holotape.
---
Make a new character and rush through the responder quests. It’ll take 4 hours tops
---
So without a PC, it's impossible to play the Classic Edition? Shame.
---
Pfft, now you'll tell us Morrowind would be better without Cliff Racers.
---
Is the drop chance higher there?
---
Did this and when clicked on the games it tells me to buy them 
---
I’m looking for a bloodied version of a two handed melee weapon which is legendary.
---
Nah the duping fiasco has pretty much taken any idea of an auction house right off the table... I'm not generally bothered by the effect duping had on the economy but even I'll admit that you can't build economy features on top of a mess like that. 
---
You get a guaranteed outfit during the last responder quest.
---
I'm sure it will go up but I think 600 is great. I have guns ammo meds and plenty of junk. It feels really good
---
Did you make sure to use the exact same username and password that you did on PS4?
---
Awesome, in light of this and earlier posts I'll update the original post to state that both torso and leg mods seem to spawn at this location.
---
Stop duping these posts 
---
is it pump, combat, or double barrel?
---
The value of TSE is real world cash. Devalue that, Mr.Rothchild.
---
gravity
---
Yeah, I only have 1 account
---
I could definately kill one, once.  Then I'm going have to put up with thier humilated ass stalking me and ruining my game til they get thier balls back.
---
I made $1,000s selling 100 piece packs of stone of jordan...most of my college was on scholarship and paid for by the Army....but my selling on ebay paid the rent, food and plenty left over for fun.   
---
It seems its not a game that can be played forever. Like many other games you finish it at some point, and then play another game. 
---
Were you using the Bethesda account or the psn account?
---
Haven’t tried stacking 
---
Oh, this is NOT where I thought this post was going to go. But this is great work!
---
Need to see what I have. I might have something I can part with. I do pure melee, havent fired a gun except for the forced syringer.. And i am looking to reduce my inventory.  
---
How about just a bunker door you can build at your camp and build inside of it that you get by exploring each free state bunker. Maybe even different kinds of stuff for it too
---
I like pump shotguns myself.  Only ever found a two shot one, but armor pen would be a good legendary effect.
---
Oh! So different outfits can drop there? Good to know! Thank you.
---
To the contrary, I have supermutants "retreat" upon spawn.
---
no....Diabol tried it, it failed miserably.  
---
Has there been any communication on this subject from Bethesda? I’d really like to see something(anything) soon. 
---
Got a T45 and T51B complete, not at full strength though. 
---
Ok that would be great I would appreciate it greatly.
---
Fuck. I'm 34. Fuck.
---
You didn’t really answer my questions. I don’t see your point.
---
Why would I trade a duper when I could just go buy from an in game vendor for less hassle?
---
The caps mean nothing, they are so easy to get that it doesn’t matter anymore.
---
Duped items lose their value. If there’s a level 75-80 TSE weapon, why would I want a level 45-50 TSE that’s only worth useless caps?
---
Why does wiping everyone, punishing non duping players, and killing a good portion of the playerbase make more sense than just killing the duped items?
---
They don’t have the balls to do a massive ban wave because so many people cheat since they haven’t done anything
---
I would....as soon as they do something about the duping exploit and something to 'fix' the duped weapons away (like for instance making explosive and twoshot take the same primary modifier slot and removing all weapons/armors with double ups in that slot, it would punish folks that got the weapons legitimately, yes, but it would fix the ETS issue)
---
As a mutant... this would infuriate me.... Lets DO IT!  This would be a freaking great addition.
---
Not to be confused with the "Touch my junk" emote.
---
Fix duping. Raise level caps on weapons and armor. I think caps can remain as the in game currency. In my experience, having various types of currency in game can get a little confusing and slightly frustrating. 
---
Caps are still extremely useful to me. Since server stability is such an issue, I rarely claim workshops anymore so most of my junk is bought in bulk from vendors or picked up while running around killing things. 
---
Duping has destroyed so many aspects of the game. Not just the economy but certain things like a whitesprings nuke. Now, the 10-12 people in the nuke zone all have explosive two shot weapons that one shot entire mobs (specifically the shotguns). So unless you have a weapon or grenade that can get some hits in before the shotties cut loose you get no xp and no rewards from the bodies. It has also made anything rare or special so abundant that it removes that sense of accomplishment from having it. 
---
What I would like to see (with the dupers) is some sort of ban or wipe on mule characters. We've all met up with that guy that's a level 3 with 1,300 pounds worth of guns he can't equip. 
---
But all your ideas sound pretty damned good to me. 
---
I forgot to add this to the FAQ.
---
I had two-shot.. didn't like it.  TERRIBLE accuracy.  I then found a quad pump action with faster firing rate.  It's funny reloading 32 rounds but it's an awesome gun overall.
---
OH. After looking into your other posts, you don’t want the fire breathers outfit. I thought that was what you meant. Sorry, I don’t have any leads.
---
I’m considering starting a new character. No fast travel and exploring everything in the areas.
---
My main character is so rich now and there’s not much more to do. Haha I’m still having fun but a lot of the challenge is gone. 
---
Thinking of a Pistol or energy weapon build. Something different and a bit more challenging.
---
Energy weapons break so fast so I’m thinking of carrying a few copies and having a small camp that I’ll place as I go to repair.
---
 [u/Cpt-Lassy](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cpt-Lassy) hooked me up.
---
I think when they add mod support we’ll get options like this, though I’ve only ever used the steam workshop for that so I don’t know for sure.
---
Hey brother, you're not alone. PC player here and I'm at the point where I can't even log on to any of my characters without immediately crashing to desktop. It's ridiculous.
---
Merchants aren't 24 hours either, 20 hours.
---
After some additional testing I can safely confirm, that damage of the Laser rifle **without** the "Beam splitter" is pretty insignificant, even with "Explosive bullets".. however with the splitter mod attached it's actually kind of decent: burns through lvl 50 robots like there's no tomorrow and same with hordes of scorched.
---
If they will fix the energy weapon durability issue, then I guess this can be used as a supplementary weapon for dealing with large groups of enemies.
---
Thank you all for your comments!
---
I spend most time just helping lower levels. 
---
only the legendaries seem to do this with super mutants, which makes sense, they've lived long enough to become legendary, so they have the rarest of all super mutant traits....a survival instinct
---
Overall advice is to just headshot from point blank range.  Try an automatic combat shotgun if it's a main weapon.  And keep killing stuff and looking for good legendary ones.
---
Best in slot legendary farm
---
Yeah, I had to put on the medium barrel and any mod that upped accuracy to make it decent.  Had to be up close, but boy was it fun!
---
I use it. It FEELS like it helps. People say it doesn't. All I know is I tick it real hard.
---
My bad, missed that part
---
So the idea here is to scuttle the cap economy and replace it with a fresh clone, at the cost of frqgmenting and convoluting the entire games economy, just in a blind hope that it won't become just as ruined almost immediately as has historically been the case with video game economies.... 
---
Sounds more like something from a game like path of exile where they just do full resets constantly and run mini leagues.... Sometimes it's not the presentation that makes an idea unpopular. Sometimes it's just the idea. 
---
Just kill the robots, crisis averted.  Bonus points: fusion cores and XP.
---
If you were on Xbox I've got a crew you could join.  All of us over 35, all met in this game.  Been having a great time exploring/destroying the wasteland.
---
I’m disappointed it wasn’t horribly overpowered and murdered every player in sight.
---
Ok. I'll buy logic that for a +1 karma. Hehe
---
Pistol crit build seems fun.  Energy seems like it'd be annoying.
---
I'm assuming the only way to do this is to log out and log back in?
---
Oh damn. No I didnt mean the Fire Breather. Thanks anyway.
---
I believe it's fallouts 1, 2 and tactics
---
I built a dam in very similar place
---
The irony is, they just keep spawning. Army of level 50 protectrons can get crazy. But those fusion cores are nice!
---
If you play in a group, look into the Rad Sponge perk. Sharing it, even at rank 1, will still make rads a non-issue in nuke zones.
---
I scavenged a lot of that in addition to the flora and the corpses of my own kills. I also had a couple other players shoot me so it killed them and took theirs. Would have been a nice afternoon in Appalachia if I'd only known not to scrap all
---
Buff the heavy weapons and I'll get back into Fo76 in a heartbeat!
---
Making mule characters in online games has been a pretty normal thing since well, online games were a thing 
---
Thank you! Haven’t played the originals so this should be fun!
---
The problem is the prior spawns aren’t cleared our.  If the spawns are cleared prior to a new player joining or current player reconnecting, there are less total robots.  
---
Harpers Ferry Vendor, 500 caps
---
I have like 2k 10mm you can have for free. I’ll
---
Be on tonight and give it to you if you’d like.
---
Even though I'm able to kill them in seconds now, they still annoy me. The blasts blind me and being my gun of choice is the gatling gun, it already cannot ADS(aiming with it is still just a more accuracte hipfire). It's common for me to have to deal with one, two, or three at the same time and have no choice but to fight them which means I have to go back and repair my armor right after since they damage armor so much.
---
One of the reasons why Alduin should've stayed dead, already killed him with dragonrend and a sword...why must I do it again in Fallout repeatedly?
---
I keep a level 20 instigating missile launcher around because it does more damage on the first shot than my level 50 bunker buster. I did just find a level 50 anti armor missile launcher though, so I feel like the days of the instigating one are sadly numbered...
---
So like, every game?
---
Thats the issue. More robots spawn to each person joining. I wish the enemies were on timers instead of spawning. Sort of how Fallout 4's enemies work.
---
Duuuude take me with you haha
---
Yes, but if it is all bug-fix and no content for a month they are going to lose some player-base to boredom.
---
Hell, scattering a dozen new CAMP plans around the wasteland would be a good start.
---
No mention of anything about game economy stuff... Which generally just means steady as she goes. 
---
That’s communists for you.  
---
They are not bad games.  But they are old.  And I would suggest not going in expecting FO3/4 games. 
---
Look, maybe your brain and attention span can only handle thinking about and talking about one problem at a time, but some of us don't have that issue and possess the capability to complain about both the shutdown and Bethesda's game simultaneously.
---
Two registered copies of the game with one Bethesda account?
---
Honestly, the difference between a level 20 TSE and level 50 TSE is negligible at best.  I'd use a level 20 TSE over any level 50 non legendary gun.  It's that good of a legendary effect.  Even if the level cap went to 100, a level 20 TSE would probably out perform a level 100 non TSE (maybe not a two-shot).
---
That's the biggest flaw I see in these "raise the level cap" suggestions.
---
However, I do like the idea of a new currency, as the cap is so devalued already due to duping.
---
Next year, mate. Next year you don't have to sit at the Kiddy Table.
---
I turn 31 on Jan 16th, maybe I can trade you my birthday so that I’ll stay 30 forever and you can be 35 next week! It does mean you’ll age twice as fast now...and that you’ll have two birthdays like the queen. 
---
With PoE it’s not really a full reset. You retain everything in Standard but if you want to play the new league then you must start fresh. 
---
Similar but this is more getting rid of old currency completely while keeping the gameplay the same. Devaluing everything that has been duped.
---
How else do you achieve a lead belly?
---
Yeah.. sad thing is, I know what happens and I still forget and scrap it all.... regularly.
---
#PURGE THE XENOS
---
Both you &amp; original commenter just need to give it a go.
---
Build is worth *a lot* more than the actual gun you're using.
---
For instance, this is my build: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f61695e&amp;d=sq2s22s32sr2sb2p02pe2ei0c71cu2ic4ip2s10a04l22ls2lt2le2la1&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
With a standard 50 cal or gatling gun I can rip through anything. Depending on what gun type you prefer some points need to be shuffled around and different perk cards obviously, but things like bloody mess/tenderizer/adrenaline should be staple in every build
---
Not a two shot, that effect is awful for shotguns. I’ve found a hardened combat shotgun to be best for rate of fire and damage balance so far. I’ve also seen quad double barrels to be pretty popular. You should also pick up the enforcer perk card and knee cap every enemy.
---
I don't see people trying to go kill a bounty of 10 very often, accidental bounties aren't enormous. If someone has fifty or a hundred bounty on them or something you know that they most likely did something on purpose. 
---
I read the title and my first thought was "when were we able to ride animals on Fallout 4. How did I miss that??".
---
Now all I can think about is riding majestically through the wasteland on the back of an albino deathclaw with a character that has long free flowing blonde hair and I dont want to play anymore until they put this in.....
---
Or chaos ogryns 
---
For me I think part of the Cloth stuff was all the duct tape I scrap, which is adhesive and cloth.  Adhesive went by fast, cloth not so much.
---
To have NPCs they will have to start anew and find a lot of voice actors. So yeah there isn't much hope for that.
---
Some of us don’t farm anything, we just try to play a Fallout game, despite all the insane bunny hopping explosion factories that making sneaking around the Whitespring to do our quests impossible. 
---
someone tested and it does have a (small) affect based off their test.  it does not show up in awareness though similar to how weapon changes don't show a difference in awareness
---
There's no such option on Console. It's only "block for session" option.
---
Yea,  whenever I come across a radio the first thing I try to do is find it and turn it off, but once that song was on and I let it play and thought it didn’t sound right and realized it was a crappy cover
---
"Got to pay the troll toll to get into this boys hole"
---
I actually answered? You don’t liking the answers doesn’t make them less valid.
---
Sadly, higher level weapons won’t make the lower ones obsolete. As long as there are players in those levels, a market will always exist.
---
Wiping makes sure all the dupes are gone, without error. If there was a magical script that BGS could run to delete all existing dupes, telling them apart from legit items, I’m 200% sure they would’ve deployed it long ago.
---
Introducing new caps or currency is just as pointless if duping is still a thing, else, you’re just making the actual currency useless to replace it with a currency that is bound to become equally as useless.
---
If you have any other ideas, I’ll be glad to debate, but objectively (regardless of the impact on the player base), nothing is as effective as (theoretically) getting rid of the duping glitches once and for all and wiping to get rid of the remaining dupes.
---
Those adorable delicious animals. 
---
I know I’m not Bighuntraps but do they work now? 
---
I was level 45 before I figured this out man... don't feel bad =P
---
When are they available? 
---
Explosive?
---
Well after loging in one day I found myself smack bang in the middle of a nuclear blast zone. I was level 7 and melted like a snowman in a heatwave. Goodbye junk, I still think of the times we shared together on that wonderful weekend. Sorry it had to end that way
---
For armor it's easy as fuck. Copy the existing texture, greyscale it, lighten, add a layer of colour. The last three steps can just be copied by layer.
---
It's not rocket science, I could make 16 colors in an afternoon.
---
That is a worry i was expecting a detailed post regarding exploits and their plans on fixing it, stabilizing the servers, punishment and the long term goals of ensuring the games future from it.
---
Isn’t Reddit already an auction house or am I missing something? 
---
I have a legendary beserker's combat shotgun and it's my new favourite weapon in the game. I usually love shotguns or the hunting rifle but this variant I'm having a blast with. It has crazy explosive damage and satisfying to shoot but I have to be careful to not kill myself because of the explosive damage. I'd keep farming legendaries and maybe you'll come across it :)
---
Yeah. A real b*tt hole.
---
No way you're getting my birthday! I was born Jan 1, 2 seconds after midnight (first baby born in 1985). I was super proud about it for 34 years until OP shamed me.
---
&gt;  Toss it in the atom store for $2 a color.
---
You mean add them to the base game for free. 
---
I'm a muttie too! 
---
I’ve had tons of fights with tse heavies and nothing was close to this.
---
HOW DARE THEY NOT GIVE ME A TSE LEGENDARY EVERYTIME I GO TO THE GOLF CLUB!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Mountain mamaAAaaaa
---
I can still walk through walls, bypass locked doors, etc - wonder if they'll patch that eventually.  It really seems like the laser grids, particularly their spacing, was the devs attempt to limit what the wall glitch could accomplish though so maybe not.
---
You can vote at a new website [www.saveplayerone.com](https://www.saveplayerone.com).  It is a site promoting a real solo player experience for Fallout 76.  Who knows, maybe it will take off and get their attention. My guess is that it will not make fart in the wind's difference.
---
&gt;I actually answered? You don’t liking the answers doesn’t make them less valid.
---
You didn’t and still haven’t. I showed no bias, just asking questions and you’re downvoting me lol.
---
There’s no logic or fact in what you are saying. Thanks for the input.
---
Do you think it would show the number difference with the perk that shows enemy resistances in vats?
---
Might want to post hours and days of week you want to play. Doing a playthrough requires a lot of sit down time together.
---
You could at least summarize the video 
---
I had another idea - split perk cards into "combat" and "passive" categories, and make each category separately track their point costs up to the SPECIAL limit. So if you have 1 INT, and we considered "First Aid" to be a combat perk and "Hacker" to be a passive perk, then you could equip rank 1 of First Aid and 1 Hacker card at the same time.
---
This would maintain the random nature of acquiring new Perk cards without making players juggle equipped cards when inside and out of combat.
---
I have an accidental bounty right now of 10 caps. I’ve killed three people who thought they were going to come collect, I’m slightly annoyed at it, but eventually someone will kill me and clear it.
---
I pretty much stay perpetually over encumbered. So I fast travel almost never. Using hand weapons and exploring everywhere I go by walking.
---
I am level 86, I’ve not discovered even half the content. It’s a huge expensive worlds in the middle of all of the locations. I suspect a lot of these people are just going to the locations, for completing the objective and fast traveling to the next one
---
Yeah i went to log in last night and I got the server error within about a minute so i just turned it off
---
Reroll. Start roleplaying on the mic. Get more friends. Become an NPC
---
That's great! 
---
yawn....old news
---
I’m confused about what you’re confused about. So let’s go from the beginning.
---
 Most perk cards use one point per rank. So having a rank one card equipped under strength means you’ve used one point from your strength SPECIAL stat.  Let’s say you have 5 points invested in your strength SPECIAL stat: that means you can use 5 of those rank one cards that use one point a piece.
---
Now let’s say you have two of those same rank one cards. You can combine those two, and they become a rank two card, and use two points for that one card instead of one point. Now, you can use that card that uses two points, and three other rank-one cards that use one point each.
---
You’re adding the points that the cards use, to equal the number of points you have invested in the SPECIAL stat that the cards use.
---
While I'm not riding the "hate train", I do think it's important to not lose track of what was promised at E3, especially since 76 failed to deliver most of Todd's talking points to begin with. I understand that Bethesda has a history of making misleading statements before a release - Skyrim's infinite quests, anyone? - but these were so egregious that not holding Bethesda accountable is laughable at this point. 
---
But my BIGGEST issue are the 76 sympathizers. 
---
**Yes**, I pre-ordered and purchased this game knowing there would be bugs - it's *Bethesda* \- and after 30 hours, I literally gave up and sold it to Amazon. I think it was right around the time I was caught between two enemies, one being level 25 and the other being level 60 - both spawning next to one another in the same dungeon. 
---
Blaming the consumer in a situation like this not only unfair, but it's completely misdirected. I've seen several people defend this as a "work in progress" or a "beta", but in my experience, I've never paid AAA prices for a game in this shape. And blaming the consumer for purchasing a known buggy product is exactly what Bethesda has capitalized on here. The open letter to consumers before the actual release in no way alluded to the fundamental problems plaguing Fallout 76. And I - like many gamers - disregarded this as typical Bethesda fanfare since they were trying something "new". 
---
Honestly, if I hadn't experienced this firsthand, I'd ***still*** probably buy the game after seeing videos because I thoroughly enjoy Bethesda's titles. And herein lies the problem -  **Bethesda has reached a point in which the expectations of the consumer are so low, that they're able to confidently release titles in a broken or buggy state and fix them at a later date**. As an engineer, if I were to show up to work and do 60% of a design and submit it to a client under the guise that it's fairly complete, I'd probably lose my job pretty quickly - and rightfully so. Selling an incredibly buggy product to a fanbase that *expects* bugs is exploitative and a disservice to the gaming community as a whole. 
---
So, blaming the consumer for purchasing a product when their intent probably wasn't far off from yours seems a little obtuse, doesn't it? And can we talk about the engine? 
---
Bethesda has long-since supported the use of its painfully dated Gamebryo (now Creation) Engine because developers are familiar with it and it allows them to develop content quickly. Considering the fact that it's now 2019 and their 20 year-old engine actually can't function beyond 60FPS is absolutely mind-blowing for me. And the fact that it'll be used for TESVI is now enough to stop that pre-order in its tracks. 
---
This game has a considerable way to go, honestly. And this is coming from someone who's sunk HUNDREDS of hours into the Fallout titles leading up to this, and a couple hundred to Skyrim alone. Some consumers just hit their threshold a little faster than others, but it in no way invalidates their concerns or for expecting a working title, especially at this price. And before I'm attacked for voicing my opinion, just know that I'll probably go home and play Fallout 4. 
---
Right now
---
It’s a combat. I tried both pump and db and combat was more my style. Open to change tho. 
---
We can call it the screw store.
---
Add me as a friend.  I’ll even talk to you in a character of your choice and give you settlements to defend.  
---
Didn't have many disconnects in the last week untill I started doing the DMV quest. Took 2 hours to do today due to being booted all the time. Was about to throw my ps4 out the window lol. That quest is so fucking infuriating as it is lol
---
Are they just for looks? 
---
thats the awareness perk i ment in the other comment.  imma edit that to make it clear now that ive re-read it
---
Ahaha gah
---
Im pretty sure I got the initiate plans for T60, and I learned bos combat armor for chest and legs, missing the arms
---
Ohh okay ty
---
Will you tell me your storie
---
Some poor suckers spent real money to buy in-game items and make an exploiter rich. And this affects my ability to enjoy the game how?
---
You can’t use them once you move from the place they were built they are useless have to scrap them
---
Will do. Is there a trick to which legendary to farm in terms of creature or level? Or location?
---
Surprised anyone would disagree with this. These posts are so vague and little. It can be hard to even call it communication. 
---
I was expecting some very serious details regarding exploits, server stability issues, player market, punishment and the long term goals of ensuring the games future. The tweet seemed to suggest we were getting a meaty bone not a few scraps. :(
---
I usually shot at the ground next to the bag, works great as long as you don’t use your explosive shotgun... don’t ask
---
Perhaps a buff like bobbleheads or magazines, could also be a hidden benefit to weapons or perks that penetrate armor, might make it do more damage to the armor itself as well as penetrate it
---
I actually didn’t know about this one until now. I’ll be frequenting this and Fort Defiance to spread the... cheer.
---
I'm 31 and my boyfriend is about to be 34... But I'd love some PS4 friends who are adults. 😊
---
I haven’t downvoted you, to be honest. I’m not exactly concerned about internet points, so don’t be paranoid.
---
There’s logic, you are just ignoring it as I’m getting the feeling you’re doing so because I’m disagreeing with you. Sadly, whether we like it or not, that’s the only way to fix the economy.
---
Thanks for the debate, have a good day, my man.
---
Did you skip the part about the bobble heads and revamping pvp?
---
Prob have to server hop to find it
---
I don’t want your birthday, I was going to trade it for a few caps. Being a broke low level player in a world full of exciting plans...it’s like being a kid in a sweet shop but not being able to have any. Plus not having a birthday would mean that I wouldn’t age any further. And I wouldn’t have to worry about any more of these damn pure white eyebrow hairs.. THATS RIGHT! I SEE YOU IN THERE! IVE ALREADY PLUCKED YOUR BUDDY OUT AND YOURE NEXT ON THE LIST! 
---
As someone else has stated Duping has pretty much killed any thought of doing this.   On the other hand being able to mail items to an Alt once they fix duping might not be so unwelcomed.
---
High five to older gamers. Pc though unfortunately.
---
Do you go there or just check the map? Sometimes events are triggered by someone going to the area.
---
Uh huh
---
Yeah as far as I’ve seen after reading through, the variations have all been PC Dev Room stuff. It’s weird that the pictures and everything are in the guide.
---
You are a joke.
---
‘NinjaGodExtreme’? Compensating for something? 
---
Ahhh yes. Reminds me of the olden days of Everquest with all of the Mob Trains that wiped entire groups. 
---
The dumb AI would just jump on board and follow characters to the end of the zones...if you saw some shout Choo Choo!!! You knew it was time to zone
---
Ok I've been there a couple times but usually I just check the map. 
---
I'm sorry to anyone who doesn't own a PC, but I'd much rather Bethesda focus on fixing FO76's issues than figuring out how to port a 21-year-old PC game to consoles.
---
Just delete explosive shots
---
Well, I suppose maybe I mean "support" rather than "defend". 
---
It's almost like they expect that the bad will just blow over since we went from detailed notes to "we'll fix it, eventually." The game is fun, I'll give it that, but it seems rather empty at the moment. 
---
Prostitution. The wasteland is a lonely place...
---
I’m using the hardened combat sg and with all the shotgun perks I just headshot mobs on 3-4 shots and even legendaries die pretty fast. I just go thru a lot of shells. 
---
Your name fits your comment. 
---
That’s not true. 45.  PlayStation. 
---
This post isn't about explosive... 
---
I believe it's PC only, sorry. On the bright side, being a 21-year-old game, it should run perfectly fine on even the most meager modern PC. If you don't have your own, you could probably stick the games on a thumb drive and play it at a friend's house or your local library.
---
Exactly. Its basically a 1 Razorgrain / 1 Steel = 1 Brahmin Meat swap - the perk card says 80%, but I often get 2 meat off one corpse and with the super duper perk used while cooking I end up with more steaks than brahmins slaughtered!
---
Unless you have the plans you can’t place them. You’ll need to have your friend join your party again and place them for you. 
---
It really pours wax on the spirit, this problem. You find holotapes, you find notes, you find clues, they all seem that they may lead you to rescue someone! You get snips of stories, you start to like this person you’re chasing, or hate them, you follow with the hope of saving or murdering them: they all lead to corpses, or scorched. Over and over. And over. 
---
And over. 
---
No problem. I'm not sure if it has to be nighttime to trigger the event as well. I've done it twice once on PC and once on PS4 and both times it was dark or near dusk.
---
Don't you dare dangle that canned beef stew in front of me.
---
Energy weapons feel like they’re trash TBH. Ive never used them with all the applicable perks though. So I may see if they’re a bit better. I find they break too fast. So maybe if I crafted one with extra durability it would be better.
---
Who knows I honestly expect it to still be horrible and just go with pistols haha
---
Even if it requires a loading screen. Just use it like a normal door to teleport into a box somewhere under the map.
---
...which only goes to show that different people like different things. 
---
What type of level creature should I be farming? Any location better than another?
---
The otherr post talked about it
---
Yeah that works.  Just drop your birthday into a tiny brown bag at your feet.  I could give you caps, but I have this nice ivory pistol grip with your name in it.
---
Game over
---
I finally just unlocked the t-60 paint. Happy to paint your suit or anyone else’s for that matter!
---
It's active, just extremely rare.  I'm over level 100 on PS4 and have seen it active maybe 5 times.  Have actually had better luck finding random mothmen out in the woods.
---
Go to nuke zones, farm flux, high radiation fluids, stuff like that. Sell the raw flux quickly to vendors for easy caps. Use this method if you cant sell stuff fast enough. 
---
This will cause so may people to fall into the void.
---
I’d love to know what platform op and, all ops who post here are working with, and bragging over.
---
Now that's comedy
---
Don't tell Bethesda, but 200 Atoms is basically 2 days of dailies, so you wouldn't even have to pay cash for it. ;)
---
But actually.  I think low price items in the cash store are a nice compromise.  Dedicated players can unlock them just by doing challenges, and impatient players can throw a little more change at the devs.
---
(SO LONG AS ITS ONLY VANITY STUFF.  Pay 2 Win can f\*\*\* right off.)
---
Reply to them then? 
---
😡
---
Yeah, they are VERY different games to anything made by BGS.
---
\- Turn-based combat
---
\- Isometric point-and-click gameplay
---
\- Lots of RNG
---
I wouldn't say that you'll like Fallouts 1 &amp; 2 if you like any of the modern Fallout games, but they certainly do hold up if you have the patience to play through them and take them for what they are.
---
Yea I need to hit a nuke zone to level up some more to get those perks but I want to have the serums ready for when I do. 
---
Scorched killer is (probably) useless if you have access to Hardened receivers (gun-dependent, obviously). I did the math on a couple guns; it did less than Hardened against scorchbeasts (by 1 point or so) and way less against everything else. Your results may vary based on your gun and what mods are available for it, however. 
---
At this point i want them to fix the game instead buying the right to songs
---
Awesome!  Gamertag?
---
I was thinking this exact thing would be the only was to make a basement viable
---
I just hit reply to this thread not to you in particular
---
Legendary mobs, 60+ for max level legendaries.  Most people just farm the clubhouse at whitesprings when it's nuked.  But you can get them off any legendary mob.
---
BamaBreeze505
---
Yeah, you need to be running something like my AMD FX-6300.  Your crappy i7 just ain't gonna cut it, bro.
---
Mentioned the hated tse
---
It is becoming more apparent that I am just a dunce. 
---
How do you make the list show ‘junk’ and ‘meat’ - is that a mod?
---
Not really, the terminal in white springs fixes this
---
Well my name is based on a comment from Nerd3 about the “token sexy female character” in games and giving her the name Jiggle Physics. But it does seem rather appropriate. But just like in advertising, sex sells. So get jiggling for those caps!
---
A good way to up damage on combats is to put a longer barrel on them, and give them the highest armor peirce mag, as armor is your biggest foe with shotties as it applies 'per pellet' not just to the overall damage.  To get mods for it, hunt the molemen in the ash heap as they tend to cary them.
---
No I watched enough of these videos where youtubers nitpicking the game so much that I can't go 1 minute without getting cringe. 
---
Yes exactly
---
I usually see them in lockers all over the asheap
---
Found the synth.
---
So you willfully admit that you completely skipped it. Someone of you will defend this game to an unreal extent lol.
---
They are pretty rare, but make some some good eating!
---
Awesome thank you. I avoid the ash heap like the plague.
---
There are a lot of places in Eastmarch that are early versions of the locations in Skyrim, but most don't actually look the same. Windhelm for example, is a major city in Eastmarch, but it's not like they just took the Skyrim version and cleaned it up/fixed buildings. Still interesting to find some things that you remember from Skyrim though.
---
If you’re selling let me know and we can work something out. 
---
I’m all out of brown paper bags... god damn it. I’ll see if I can get one from a vendor. 
---
You make Strong Sad proud, OP.
---
I think the problem is the people I try to buy from because everyday I use a trade route that gives 1400 caps but everyone I buy from wants like 9,000-15,000 for there tse weapon and I ask “can you put the weapon on hold for a day or two” and then they say yes but end up selling it anyways
---
There's yet another Harper's Ferry plan that spawns right by the vendor bot. It's on a balcony on the south end of the building next to the vendor.
---
I think the drops are completely random so I can't recall where I got it or off what enemy but I'd try running some nuke zones in whitesprings. Probably got it there because I don't do a whole lot of legendary farming unless my friends are on. Sorry I can't give you an exact location :(
---
Why would you think that? 
---
I logged in one day and had 756 Mutifruits, 756 corn, and 512 tatos.  Took me like 10 mins to scrap it all. 
---
My game just crashed, but loading back in now
---
I was there once too :)
---
It does have to be night time and some one has to be in the 'event area' for it to have a chance to turn on.
---
I think many share your opinion man. Mind you i am really surprised we have not heard from them for a 2019 road map. I love that in other games then again i am more used to constant communication from the other side like Warframe has.
---
But you can scrap all that pre-war money into more cloth you don't need!!
---
&gt;they fix duping
---
Lol, they can't, I bet they again use some crutches, like an max item cap on bobbleheads and a weapon
---
Bethesda has used the shocking price of the current Atom Shop skins to normalize your line of thinking. Basic colours should be included in the game at no additional cost.
---
Saying "you wouldn't even have to pay cash for it" isn't right, Atoms are Atoms and if they're spent on something you'd be incentivized to buy them for the next premium item.
---
Which room is this? I need that damn wetsuit!
---
Kill it ?
---
Wait, there’s a separate Firefighter outfit? 
---
Do you have heavy weapons perks? And most importantly, do you have the Grounded mutation? Halves energy weapon damage
---
Quite frankly, the manner in which Bethesda has handled every aspect of FO76 gives off the impression that they :
---
\- Have a small dev team of 5 or 6 people
---
\- Have little to no experience in marketing or customer service
---
\- Are embarking on their first project ever
---
\- Are inexperienced with coding
---
\- Just recently built a new engine and are ironing out the kinks
---
The sad part? NONE of these things are true. I love Bethesda. I love their games. I'm wearing fucking Fallout socks as I'm sitting at work typing this.  
---
But holy fuck have they just been awful. Vague and dodgy in their posts and answers. Updates few and far between. Zero transparency on what \*\*\*exactly\*\*\* is being worked on. No evidence of any plan to address the completely fucked economy or how in the name of holy hell they plan on balancing PvP.  
---
I don't mean to sound like an ass, but what the hell are they actually doing over there? They show up for 8 hours a day and do what? Twiddle their thumbs?
---
Awesome, thank you, I'll verify and add it.
---
I hated it when I started, now I'm level 183 so I totally avoid it cause it's all low level.
---
Just found mining helmet on shelf outside of Blackwater mine
---
\+1 for Charleston comment
---
I remember when I first found a piece of raw chicken in the Airport and noticed it was an actual food item can could be cooked. I just shouted “CHICKENS EXIST!” at the screen. I think my neighbor things I’m slow and only just discovered the existence of chickens.  
---
Try to do some of the other Powering up missions. It should drop after the third time.
---
Don't skip the video if you want to actually discuss.
---
True the difference currently is negligible but it wouldn’t have to be if they made the new content, mob levels and item levels have a significant increase to weapon damage/mob health.
---
Bosses shouldn't drop legendary all the time. World of Warcraft has a similar model
---
I’ve been running workshop events to get more plans so I can create my weird modern art gallery outside watoga ( it’s going to be tricky ).
---
Have heaps of plans I’d love to give to someone that likes building things - Xbox one - username letsmakeart
---
Oh ok thank you both this helps alot so I guess I'll wait till nighttime and keep checking there physically :)
---
Try to do the powering up missions to 100% completion.
---
There’s at least 2, I think 3 spawn points in Watoga itself. There’s like 3-4 more non-raider ones scattered around the Bog (best place to hunt L50 ones). Look up a power armor spawn map
---
It would be better if Bethesda just started with seasons like diablo so people could start over if they wanted to with clean people. Each season you start a new character **IF YOU WANT** and after season ends your level and items gets sent to a stash for you to collect.
---
I was in the middle of a quest where I was deep in the basement. Had to kill a particularly high powered enemy among a bunch of easier stuff, and it took a LOT of ammo. But I did it!
---
And then right before I finished (literally was pressing like the last button to complete the quest), I got kicked.
---
Had to run all the way back down to the basement; all the enemies were back. Ugh.
---
You know what, I do have grounded. I keep forgetting about that.  I deleted a ultracite laser forgetting that too 
---
I keep forgetting it affects the tooltip as well.
---
No perks though as this isn't my heavy weapons build and I was just curious why the damage was so incredibly low.  
---
Lol DMV 10/10
---
Seriously though great ideas
---
i want them to buff other nuke sites too, i dont even need another boss like scorch beast queen
---
just make a place in the ash heap spawn as many mole men as there are ghouls at whitesprings
---
make a place in the mire spawn a ton of mirelurks and anglers
---
make grafton steel spawn nonstop super mutants
---
etc.
---
No worries. Thanks for the advice!
---
I think it’s a comment on your musical prowess. You’re the douche that gets his guitar out at a party to try and impress girls and get attention....I’d have killed you too if I had the chance. They were justified. 
---
Yep! If you look into the post I linked, you can see the helmet and also the Uniform. I am still searching for the uniform.
---
Also there seem to be a number of cosmetics that at least havent been posted on the internet yet. The event drop cosmetics are quite rare it seems.
---
I've seen them a few times up by that cooking station between the Vault and the Moonshiner's shack.
---
I wish it spawn level 50 enemies. Stopped doing that event since the loot is lower levels
---
The point of the perk system is to limit what a player can do "at one point in time". That clarification is important because you basically have to choose between combat effectiveness and utility when exploring the wasteland. This choice makes sense for the majority of perks, but not crafting because crafting is not performed during combat.
---
For example:
---
- It makes sense for a player to choose between being able to carry more junk and doing more shotgun damage because both actions are normally performed during combat.
---
- It does not make sense for a player to choose the ability to craft armor mods over additonal weapon damage, because one action is exclusively performed during combat, while the other is not.
---
I just throw on the Fallout Radio Station on YouTube. It 24/7. Songs from all the games, except 76. 
---
Does the UI still stretch for ultrawide? I will not purchase until these basic features are fixed.
---
Just move the base it repairs it for caps instead of materials , like even in same place move it slightly and relay
---
Question - when farming what’s best to use as a weapon? I’ve taken to using a good legendary hammer that’s easy to repair and doesn’t burn ammo. 
---
feelsbadman. you playing on PC? if yes I can help you out with some screws 
---
Go to the top floor, it's part of the area you get access to when you become part of the Brotherhood of Steel, it's in the room with the two Power Armor Stations located between both of them.
---
&gt; So where does that leave pistols? In a spot where you really just have to love them enough to want to use them?
---
I think so, because roleplaying. It's like running as a crossbow player -- you have to really want to, because you value the experience of playing as who you want to be over being an OP god in game.
---
In theory pistols should also have benefits in weight and maneuverability over rifles, but I don't think the simulation accurately captures that.
---
You want more songs!? “Makes a radio station that plays Barbie Girl on repeat”. ARE YOU HAPPY NOW!? 
---
Bobblehead buff stack
---
It's almost as if the game is fundamentally flawed 🤔
---
You guys can feel free to add me, I’m looking for the same. None of my friends play this game. MikeGarr16 
---
A vault it is then.
---
I have a deathclaw gauntlet without power armor of course, that's fun. I call it the sneaky claw! Stealth unarmed built :) 
---
We need an Obsidian Fo4 spinoff...
---
just wow...
---
I'm not watching the video.  What reality check do I need?  Surely it can be explained quicker through text without giving someone ad revenue.
---
Ah man, I would totally have people willing to play as raiders against your party. Sadly we are on PS4.
---
one way is to farm stuff you can sell to vendors (legendary gear, flux, aids, junk) but you would need to travel to each factions treader each day, limit is 200caps a day per faction and game has 7 (responder, raider, enclave, freestates, whitespring, b.o.s, watoga) so only 1400caps a day     
---
another way is farm stuff to sell on the trading subs/forums
---
(rare outfits, paints, plans, legendarys, jetpack, calibrated shocks etc.)
---
you can do a lot more than 1400/day but its boring af to farm some of this stuff and a lot of server hopping
---
Thanka. Im going to check it out after work. 
---
You guys really kind of are proving my point about this sub.
---
Thats a pretty cool idea.
---
However when you’re outside of combat there is absolutely nothing stopping you from changing perks, and while in combat you cannot craft or you will be killed. You do not need both to be active at the same time. However, if you want to have them all of the time out of convenience then I think using a single perk point for it is justified. It gives you the option, but at a cost. 
---
Current glitches in consideration, wouldn’t this be the trade function?
---
If it's not white springs it'll be somewhere else, there's always going to be a place called the best grind. To be the best grind it just has to have the best cost to benefit ratio. Grinds also are always going to be boring, part if why it's called a grind. 
---
Ok, pardon me from being off topic, but what's this about trade routes?
---
Can confirm. I moved my camp instead of doing repairs after someone destroyed everything. Paying the caps was much easier.
---
Blackwater Mine is scattered with them, east of Whitespring. You don't have to go in the mine though, just to the houses around it. Watch out for a set of power armor to the right of the mine also.
---
yah that's pretty lazy
---
I believe it was and not 100% on this early 2019. So i guess that is room for the first few months. I don't mind waiting longer as long as Jan has some super heavy bug fixing patches and server stability fixes.
---
Don’t play wonder wall then 
---
It's a little silly to think some Nuka-Cola promotion they happened to have going on resulted in the complete conversion of every single vending machine in a state to only accept this promotional currency. 
---
Not even sure if it would even be legal for them to do so since that could be construed as an attempt to supplant the dollar as an accepted U.S. currency which in technical terms is illegal as fuck.
---
Just found one there, thanks though!
---
When I searched yesterday there was only hard hats and miners hats
---
Maybe we are.  Maybe we aren't.  Who knows, since you won't explain your point.
---
If your point is that people don't want to stop what they're doing in order to watch another YouTube video kvetching about something, then yeah, you're right.  Congrats?
---
So many people are going to pissed when they nerf these weapons after spend tons of caps or real $$ for them.  
---
Appalachian Rad Fried Chicken... available at a Wasteland location near you, available in normal, diseased, spicy, glowing, barbecue, moldy, ranch, and well preserved with rad salt.
---
Super Mutants
---
&gt; Take armour penetration perks and aim for the torso, not the head.
---
I was just starting to notice this... why are robots more vulnerable in the torso?
---
Given how cheap the game is, if you like it and have a decent computer, it’s definitely worth running both clients at once. I’ve got a water farmer on my second account that runs a bunch of water purifiers and food, and shares perk cards (working on raising his charisma more). It makes Team Challenges easy, I can run Squad Manuevers, Inspirational, etc. 
---
I run the second client full screen borderless, it is rough on first loadin but once you’re loaded, as long as that character’s POV isn’t changing, it’s very minor performance impact for me. I have him sleep in bed most of the time so the camera doesn’t move. The other 4 character slots are various storage mules- one for guns/equipment, one for ammo and explosives, one for junk, mods, plans, and one for everything Aid.
---
Or better... Let us make them.
---
They should have made currency in fallout 76 pre-war money with Cloth as its backing and used CAPS for the premium currency in the atomic shop.
---
Can you tldr a ten minute video? This is reddit. Not Facebook. I'm not giving these people my views. There's no point. If you give me a quick summary of what you want me to watch I will give you my opinion fair and square. 
---
[Commence the jigglin!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT3HvLO3eXo)
---
I am, but I'm okay thank you! Just went on a little scavenge and should have enough. I'm well used to having no screws!
---
Aww that's so nice :) I see myself being this kind of player when I'm high enough level. 
---
As it is I leave all my stuff at my CAMP unlocked so anyone passing by is free to take water/food or use my stuff. 
---
Actually if you go in the mine to the right there will be two sets of locker rooms (shouldn't be any enemies yet) with some of those in it normally from when I've been there.
---
You keep being you, bud. I'm just going to say I bought the game at launch for $60 and I already put at least 200 hours of enjoyment and mindless fun into it. I think it is worth my money, don't you think? 
---
That's great to know, thank you!
---
Hello fellow ESO player!  Thanks for the information, it should come in handy
---
I would love a use for prewar money other than cloth. 
---
Thank you Turbid_Dahlia. I am glad you enjoyed the information and research behind this.
---
Hmm.  You make a good point.  Its scary to think that the ubiquity of cash shops has jaded me to their toxic effect.
---
Although I can't help but think though that any ongoing game has a right to generate an ongoing income stream.  And given the profitability and similar ubiquity of pay-to-win and gambling (loot boxes), seeing honest sales of vanity items (with non-random, non-insignificant discounts to loyal players) is a breath of fresh air.
---
Additionally, "limited time" and "OMGBBQFIRESALE" strategies are too manipulative for my taste, so I will judge Bethesda harshly if they continue to employ them.
---
...and will judge them harsher still if they produce more cash stop items faster than they produce fixes for critical bugs.
---
I have that yes. I didn't realise it was 30% **Per Pellet**! 
---
No wonder it seemed to happen way more often than 30% of the time.
---
Is it located in Philippi?
---
I pre ordered and have around the same amount of hours.
---
all right my man. stay safe. 
---
I do have a terrible musical ear, you may be on to something...
---
I feel silly for not realizing the Harper's Ferry house had more than 1 level to look at....
---
Similar thing happened to my friend. Some people just want to watch the world burn..... unfortunately :(
---
lol good for you my girlfriend plays video game's too and I don't laugh at her or treat her like shit. Surprise, Surprise. I don't like attention seeking posts like this. Nobody on here said you were bad so stop looking for attention. I mean you got insane amount's of it from all the thirsty's on here hoping to get a internet squeeze.
---
This is late but I had to see if this happened to anyone else. Literally at the same part. 
---
I mean... its only been out 2 months. That's not a lot of time for a development team to create things. I bet the new content will not come until March if I was to guess. I suggest just moving on to another game until new updates happen to FO76 and then come back. Currently I am playing state of decay 2 on pc and then switching to resident evil 2 remake in 2 weeks. I will be deep into getting 100% in resident evil so I'm assuming that will take me a good month and directly into the FO76 content drop. Maybe form a plan like this for yourself and give yourself a break? I was high level as well when I decided to take a break and have been tearing through games I bought on black Friday since, with the expectation that I will come back when more content drops. If you keep playing right now when your bored with it you will completely burn yourself out on FO76 and then never come back again.
---
Don’t know tbh but I picked it up when I visited watoga the first time straight away (or was it robco...either way).
---
I’m guessing if could be argued that’s where the brains of the operation are.
---
Thank you Devoid!
---
I expected nothing, and I’m still let down.
---
What platform are you on? If you're Xbox I can refer you to someone.
---
I would have to agree there. 
---
I’m choosing not to believe that players have somehow *found* ‘qasmoke’ and have been earning some pretty rare skins and outfits through events. I have seen players wearing Enclave X-01 skins, that I thought were otherwise unavailable. However, it has yet to be confirmed whether or not many items are actually available in-game or not, due to how rare so many items are. 
---
Undoubtedly though, someone has accessed the ‘qasmoke’ developer room. There’s no telling what can actually be found in the world and what cannot unless someone does some investigative learning like you helped with! 
---
Not really. Done making money for people who don’t play the game and 15 minute click bait videos.  Guessing this your video and that is why you are promoting it??
---
Need proof of that lie lol
---
Aqua teen hunger force! Man I used to watch that a lot when I was younger, I forgot he even said that. I hope I can get that as a text alert for my phone xD
---
I am glad this helped you out! 
---
- "We're always watching..."
---
My C.A.M.P. Is pretty remote. Very few mobs (3-4 max) spawn nearby. Little risk to anyone but me for the most part. 
---
See when that happens to  me , I send an Xbox message to one of them saying thanks.
---
Then I ignore them wait one day, go to the message click "more" then "view profile" the "join game" and watch that person who has totally forgot about me until I find there camp and BOOM do it to them. Log out server pop into random one go to Vault 76 message people from social menu saying come kill me for free caps and it feels great.
---
Hey that's my thread in the post. Don't worry most already know of this stuff. We just constantly remind Beth that this is not ok and are waiting for fixes.
---
I always felt like the whole “pipe weapons” theme was something they could have run with a bit more. Lemme have that pipe Gatling gun with .38 rounds...or a pipe shotgun that has a bunch of duct taped barrels 
---
You guys acting like you're giving out a view like its money are a joke lol.
---
As taking workshops today which attracted some people that wanted to pvp or troll ( they’d attack the workshop or take it over but then abandon it).
---
Every single one had two shot explosive shotguns without fail. 1 shot deaths in full power armour. At least I got one with an orbital which was fun.
---
It shows me just how prevalent the DuPont is though - especially when they were squads with the same gear and weapons.
---
And you focus and commit to the hate train instead of the game?
---
And surround workshops and substations. Nearby workshops to that powerplant, as well as Substations, will have a &lt;power plant&gt; power box you can run a wire from. It’ll have 100 power available. 
---
The power box is always there, but the power only runs if that plant is fully repaired
---
You can build anything at any level provided you have the plans.
---
At the game start you can build wooden walls and door frames and windows 
---
Every 21 hours sell out all 7 venders you’ll have enough caps in a few days
---
I've seen the two dead vendors. It struck me as odd because they had the look of being dead only a week or so. There was a dead deathclaw too but I didn't notice if he was a vendor or not. 
---
Its pretty much pulling my thread still good to remind them.
---
I made a level 45 Eye of Set thinking that would help in Watoga... nope! Worse than my rifles.
---
Ughhh I thought the same thing. The part I dislike about the bugs the most is that, they’re fixing those instead of adding cool stuff.
---
yea, but thats not how MMO's should be... theyre meant to be played for as long as possible with more content being added
---
This is great, and exactly what I came to find out today. Thanks for the insight. 
---
I see that you're on PC, if you want i can get you almost any TSE gun for free.
---
But that would take them away from people who have gotten them lagitimently
---
And it’s arguably the most important perk for a crafting character. 
---
[Don't look now.](https://imgur.com/a/teDEFgW)
---
Id totally destroy that if i saw it lol
---
It was all happy and fun before you broke out the musical instruments. And then they felt the need to destroy you and everything you own. There is a lesson to be learned here. 
---
Ok.. go ahead and message me on Xbox Gt themisterphenix I will be on around 8pm est.
---
I'm fine with the camps I see that spawn north of the club house, over the stream, and often have their guns facing AWAY from the clubhouse.  Those I feel are acceptable, to use the camp defenses you have to pull the mob group over the stream and past the house. 
---
The ones set up aiming directly at the backdoors? yeah...I can see why those get nuked. 
---
Yeah, it's a good way to make a Colonel Gutsy baby mode.
---
I rather lose a legitimate TSE then experience a full wipe and start at zero. 
---
Is this a cross-platform issue? I play on PS4 and think it's maybe happened once but could have been an Internet timeout. From what I can see it seems like xbox people suffer the most with this.
---
I use the dumpster in front of my base. So people can shift through their trash lol
---
I didn't make the game, just saying what is in it.  
---
If we're going with "illegal as fuck", look no further than the Grafton mayor, the Enclave, or the US Senator that we've been following around. The pre-war US was corrupt as hell. Even more so post-war.
---
Happened to me last night.
---
Then I went and had dinner and came back to a different with a nuke zone and everything had legendaries for the next 3 hours
---
No TSE goes for that high math 3* TSE but 
---
Regular ones go for 3-5k whoever is tryna sell you that  is a madman
---
Thanks for the offer, but part of the fun for me is only using weapons/armour I've found! Very generous of you though!
---
Try doing all of the powering up missions.
---
Is FO76 an mmo though? I think its closer related to Borderlands. 
---
Attention Deficit Disorder pets might get all distracted tho....
---
Royalties.
---
No problem, good luck.
---
Can't count how many times I've JUST taken a workshop and set its defenses up, gotten all the resources extracting aannnd...  \*DISCONNECTED FROM SERVER\*
---
That's my concern. I have ammo and stuff that I don't need, but I know someone out there could use it. I don't want to just dump it and it vanishes.
---
How does that work? How long does this stuff last? Until you log out? For an hour? Until you get a certain distance away from the drop point?
---
You make some excellent points there my friend.
---
That’s what I tell them but everyone I find wants that much
---
Erm. i7 is higher than i5. What the heck are they talking about.
---
Go to market76 you’ll find a cheap one there 
---
&gt; 2 days

"The first of those will be coming January 14"

THE FUTURE IS MUTANT
---
You've got to bait them from outside the windows on the south side. They all rush the windows but can't get through, and you can mow them down.
---
If it helps i think the video is well done and i love legacy videos. Also very happy he used my thread in his video to showcase this issue i have been trying to push for abit now.
---
Once again, turns out some people only had to wait patiently for a bit, like adults, instead of throwing tantrums about lack of communication.
---
I did it today didn't have any problems they just spawned 2 of them at the time at only one speaker. Until suddenly 8 spawned another speaker but that was in the last 30 seconds. At the end of the event there seemed to be a lot spawning in so maybe I got lucky
---
Pretty much. It looked weird without some support.
---
Sweet,  someone else with the camo paint. I thought I was the only one.
---
I did a bridge across the river up north myself for awhile (and my buddy copied it somewhat after I moved. Between the penitentiary and the Mirelurk suitor event more or less.
---
Granted the house interior wasn't the bridge, but I did attach the bridge to the top of it.
---
They can just fast travel.
---
Your post was downvoted and “misunderstood” because you pretty much refused to acknowledge anyone who disagreed with your idea.
---
This even is your third post on the same subject.
---
Cant they just fast travel away?
---
Yeah, they're 100% useless and are just meant to give the impression that there is structure so things don't look like they're floating.
---
The goal was to help people out with all the misinformation that was going on. I've been testing different builds and theories until every build I made I noticed the pattern I was going through to make sure that it landed. I had spoken with a lot of players and it was the same thing about them just being bugged. I did not have that problem too often and then it hit me like a set of Brick Building plans. Kill minions. Kill mini boss. Tested like 50 times in different regions and it was all the same. Thank you for the words of encouragement!
---
If they could be, then they would be able to replace items that magically disappear 
---
Awesome thank you
---
&gt; The pre-war US was corrupt as hell. Even more so post-war.
---
Exactly, and they wouldn't under any circumstances allow any company, big business or not, to potentially undermine their power by replacing their own currency.
---
OMG... you have to crouch?!  I spent a few different days going to that spot trying to catapult myself off... never once did I try to crouch and do it!
---
Also, that's one of the more interesting random location I found.  They even have a missile launcher spawn there for you to target practice with.
---
Thanks for the reply and the info
---
People would just sell duped weapons and gear for the new caps.
---
The problem of the economy is not related to the currency type.  The problem is the market flooded with duped weapons.
---
Nerfing vanilla/early weapons only hurts new and honest players.
---
Player vendors are coming. I hope they are really persistent auction house vendors and not something that is only available when online or we will have severs full of AFK players. So yes I would. 
---
It's not like the dirt is just there underground and they would remove it. Have you ever fallen through the world? There's really basically nothing under that level of "ground" that we see. 
---
I'm just wondering what players will blame the lag on when they finally fix the dupe exploit. 
---
It certainly can't be on Bethesdas end.
---
I’m just trying to get past the small pool of new post searchers for a meaningful debate. Your opinion was acknowledged and is valued.
---
nice !
---
you die ? )
---
and mods.. its been mostly mods for me
---
Nah. There are powder weapons that hold two shots, supposedly. Some guy tried to trade one to me once but trading didn't work. I used to have The Dragon but accidentally sold it like a spaz. 
---
Oh that's good to know, I assumed you would have to wait until the zone cleared. Thanks
---
I'd like a vending machine I could put at my camp, linked to a small stash, and a beacon to make it visible on the map.
---
I don't even want the caps (and there's no competing with dupers anyways), but it hurts to scrap good things just because they don't fit the build I'm going for.
---
Lol OP forgot he can fast travel
---
They patched the last patch notes!
---
neither of those options will happen.  More than likely, they'll just nerf the explosive component.  Which I'd be all for, it's ridiculous the amount of damage I can do with my TSE
---
Haha like that would stop the outrage. 
---
Appreciate the info thanks
---
Second floor of the main admin building in Camp McClintock usually has one.
---
You didn’t read the post. You wouldn’t be able to sell duped gear for new caps.
---
&gt;The problem is the market flooded with duped weapons.
---
The solution solves that problem.
---
Lmao... I did... 
---
How is that possible without running out of budget??
---
I think they last 30-45 mins (my best estimation)
---
Why are even making a new one for this? What happened to the old one?
---
I mean like Bethesda's mobile game fallout shelter
---
This is amazing! Well done.
---
Yes.. yes they can LoL. Why tf didn’t I think to do that...
---
I've recently got my first one - Unstable Isotope (10% chance to cause radiation burst upon being hit on melee). It's not gonna be my style, I'm a rifleman. Should I keep it so it'll give me more radiation to get more mutations? Or is it not worth bothering with, because radiation is common enough?
---
Reposting looking for better traction.
---
speak for yourself. lots of people would just drop the game.
---
It was the best Sticking-You-in-a-Fake-Snowman-and-Beating-You-Senseless-With-Nunchucks... Covered Bridge I could manage.
---
I hope I didn’t come off as an hostile person, by the way; I want the economy to be fixed as much as you do.
---
Yeah there was this weird post about Vim! PA paint. Seemed unusable but it is somehow there. 
---
Then again, we cant know if this item was found in a secret dev room or if there is a legit way and the paint is just bugged.
---
I hope over time we can confirm more and more legit rare drops.
---
You'd be surprised if they like.. i don't know.. have a database with character information including what items the character has in their inventory?  Like.. surprised that it wasn't stored client-side in an easily editable format?
---
There's no equivalency there.
---
Bye? If you're going to leave because you lose an OP weapon maybe you shouldn't play the game to begin with. 
---
Little update - I finally caved last night and just started server hopping the vendor. I don’t know how many times I did it last night but I went for 3 straight hours. Watched a lot of YouTube videos to pass the time. Got nothing. Today I’m keeping tallies and so far I’m at 16 times and counting.
---
This is mind numbing. I don’t even know why im still doing it. At this point I’m convinced there’s something wrong or I have the worst luck in the wasteland. I thought it was a fairly common drop. For God’s sake, it’s just a wall.
---
I got kicked three times in an hour and a half yesterday, it does really suck. 
---
Yes I’m on Xbox and that would be nice
---
Yes. So far I've only found the Whitesprings has a reason their vendors accept caps.
---
Welcome every online game that comes out. No company can keep up with the demands for content.  
---
Thank you for the information.  I will gladly give it a try when I am randomly found by a SB, lol.
---
I just haven't felt like I've missed the NPCs. For me this game has done a good job of creating the feeling like you slept through the apocalypse. 
---
Finding a holotape, terminal, or note with bits of the story make me feel like I'm unraveling the mystery of what happened. 
---
In a away these long dead NPCs feel more alive then dialog repeating NPCs from previous iterations of the game. 
---
Or maybe I'm a weirdo 🤷🏾‍♂️
---
Yes, I am absolutely aware. 
---
Please re read what I wrote. There is a reason there are final included stats as well as informing that those are the perks needed for the build and to basically pick the rest you want.
---
Anything else? lol
---
I thib2k that kinda stuff is expensive. Royalties or whatever. Im not a lawyer though. 
---
I met him like 2 days ago, he invited me to see his camp
---
Lol @ "to all the people I've sold explosive weapons to".
---
Well if they can ban the dupers that would be ideal. It wont take all the duped items out of the game, but it will severely deplete the inventory and availability of all items on the market. That in itself will begin to correct the market. Beyond that, between people moving onto other games over time and new content and new builds becoming meta, as well as the slow trickle of new players and people making alts, the market will continue to correct itself over time and probably within a few months reach a reasonable level of stability and sanity where caps can become worth something again and rare drops and plans can have greater value again. Just my 2c
---
Part of the game duder
---
If all goes well for you, I'd love for you to come back and post a testimonial! Hope your adventures go well in the wasteland!
---
Probably scrapped it by accident.    Usually the cause of the “vanishing “ items. 
---
what a legend
---
I'm not convinced that duping has anything to do with server stability.
---
Difference between "part of the game" and hopping servers about 6 times to be a c**t.
---
One of the top 5 QoL changes/fixes needed ASAP, so stupid.
---
I tried this and it didn't work for me. Still "stuck" in PA, can't use crafting benches and can't get into other power armour. 
---
Killed my character. 
---
I've tested Strange in Numbers a lot, it only blocks your mutation effects if you are in a 'group' by yourself, for example if you have invited someone to a team (making you the leader) but they haven't accepted. If all teammates leave your group, again leaving you alone but still in the 'group', it does the same thing. Using your social menu to leave the group will restore your mutations without needing to take the card off. 
---
you can just block for session which is what everyone does whenever pvp breaks out
---
Scrapping a power armor chassis simply puts the PA pieces in your inventory.
---
If they were real, they would be the contributing cause of epilepsy
---
There is a traveling responder bot?
---
Got mine from Graham 
---
Nice reference lol
---
yes , its rare event , he sell rare items sometimes 
---
Whatchu got for sale? I always have room for more :)
---
And scrapping your ignition cores to make your other ignition cores.
---
There’s nothing for anyone to see the true value of items for the economy.   Sure there’s 15 different reddit groups, I’m sure there’s websites and such.....but in the end how much is that handmade really worth?   Gotta set up an auction house with an ability to post buy/sell orders once duping gets patched.   Once there is one place for all the players to actually gauge the price of an item and buy / sell, the duper’s will realize it’s not worth their time to even try to sell things in game and will move to eBay.  If they were patient in the first place, they wouldn’t dupe.   
---
It seems that all the duping glitches have the one thing in common that weapons must be in stacks.  Stop allowing weapons to be stacked.
---
While we all may feel different, duper’s don’t make up a large percentage of the game.   Bethesda could have a team of a couple of folks or even a algorithm to look server side quantities of items and start handing out bans.    Guys duping that exploding shotgun for their friend isn’t the issue.   It’s the guys that have hundreds of thousands of items in their inventory.   Those guys would stick out and be quite easy to find.  Console / IP / User ban them for a very long time.  Make 1 round of examples, and the opportunity duper won’t do it.   
---
You should take the name out because you could get banned for starting a witch hunt. 
---
I got you. Lvl 150’s
---
dv’d
---
Funny how the original story doesn’t mention server hopping.  Regardless it is a part of the game. 
---
Im sorry I hope somehow its fixed in the next update. Support is beyond clueless. They gave me the same bs when my quests dissapered but it was fixed in the next update. Good luck!
---
After they refused to push forward to finish the fight, leaving the warlord vulnerable.
---
Wow. I did not know that.
---
I too have a 2nd account to hold weapons I like but don't have the build for, but there's no way you could convince me you own on the scale of millions of junk without duping. A few dozen thousand is feasible, depending on what item it is. There's no single correct answer for the problem, so I don't expect anything will be done about it, unfortunately.
---
Well not knowing if they could, I feel like they would have to have a way to track the code for a specific item to verify you had it in your inventory to begin with. otherwise what's stopping me from saying I may have lost a level 50 two shot, instigating, double pipe rifle? Sure it's not highly desired but as a lone shooter and sniper that will instantly kill everything except for SB, SBQ, and the behemoth.
---
Got a video link of that perchance? 
---
Dunno where the thread went but before you there was a player that did a PSA warning against spamming maps like that for a variety of reasons.
---
You've got to do a few, hop, do a few more, hop. It's tedious. But seemingly the only way to not risk inventory overload by collecting hundreds of items in a matter of seconds.
---
And it’s deleted again.
---
Put the turret on a low object and put barriers around it. It's harder for melee to break it.
---
Can't realistically be done the way you want. To facilitate deleting a portion of the ground would be a big engine change. The problem is that you have to take the ground geometry, the polygons it's made up of, split them up, make new ones go down and around the basement you've made, retexture all that. It's not just a matter of "delete the ground."  
---
The only way I can think of that this would be feasible is if you make a trap door object, or vault door, or elevator door or something, which lets you port to an interior cell that you can build off of with its own set of interior hallway and room objects. It wouldn't really be a basement, but it'd be close enough I think. Could be pretty cool, I think. A trap door could go to a cinderblock basement style interior, which could only be expanded to be so big. You could also have a cave door that would let you dig out a cave network. And of course the grandest would be the vault.
---
Dv'd?
---
a game in which the only end-game content is to farm for op equipment.
---
brilliant.
---
Revenge because the friend was going to remove the bounty and hand the caps back.
---
Could also have been a bounty bait situation where one player gets a bounty then one or more slaughter anyone who tries to collect on it for fun.
---
I think I see what you're saying. One location is acceptable, but not nationwide. Fair point. Hopefully they can expand on the lore more.
---
PC  
---
hopped on a few days ago for the first time in a month, had to download the update but other than that no problems. I go to get on today and my game had deleted itself like it did during beta. Has anyone else experienced this problem since launch?
---
Nah.. i've probably only actually repaired power armor though 4 times.  I'm level 197.
---
[Same](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/617/851/56d.gif).
---
I've gotten knuckles every single queen kill I've done. 6 now.
---
*That's* where they lost you?
---
Thats ok my friend did too when i trapped him in my base once
---
No good deed goes unpunished, I suppose. That sucks and sorry to hear it. Didn’t see the platform, but if you choose to reroll and are on ps4 hit me up, I’d be happy to lend a hand in some way. 
---
You've clearly been smeared. Lmao your times up 
---
I wish there were human NPCs as well. I'm just not invested in the quests and only doing it for that XP. 
---
I don't even read terminals or notes anymore, but still click on every entry in case it opens up a map marker. 
---
Most of the time, other players aren't really interested in interacting much other than saying hello and using the wave emote. Definitely not the same as NPCs. 
---
Nearly all seemed legit??? Most involved 10-50 maps??? How about the outliers?  Honestly if you know you are accepting duped items you have to expect something to go wrong. 
---
I wish I had read it before
---
oh well 🤗
---
Go hang out with grahm, hes got lots of dialogue
---
Ugh.  That bites.  I have some saved up.  I guess I should use them or toss them.
---
There is OP and then TSE OP. You can still have strong combos without one shotting everything. 
---
Guys duping for their buddy isn’t the issue.  It’s the ones duping for eBay and such that are.  These guys got hundreds of the same TSE weapons.   They could create an algorithm to look at server side inventories and quantities of items and call out illegitimately high quantity numbers and start there.   You may ban 1 or 2 hard core legitimate grinders, but you can always research those cases.
---
This is very reminiscent of my first character, the stealth sniper. It was definitely as you say with the dragon. That was such a fun playthrough. Stay frosty out there!
---
Thank you, I hope so too
---
yeah :(
---
If I had my way the effects themselves would be changed to do far less damage, like, waaaay less damage. 
---
They don't allow picture threads. But you can attach the Imgur link to your main post and we can see it inside the thread.
---
I would 100% do this myself if I could figure out how. That’s amazing.
---
It's kind of situational?  Like the above as an example, you want to tag stuff for XP so something that damages multiple targets.  Like a shotgun with terrible accuracy or a tesla rifle or a molotov.  But when i'm there alone i go with melee and take them down one at a time.  My build is unarmed melee.  Maybe a rifle to tag stuff that's far away to draw its attention.
---
If you get too many at once to handle, having a shotgun with the enforcer perk in agility is great to cripple the melee mobs.  Whitesprings is all melee mobs.
---
I condescend to those who see fit to look down on others with snarky and sarcastic remarks. I went through your posts to people and you looked like you needed a whack with a reality bat to be honest.
---
You're not better than anyone else, despite whatever you may think...
---
And, yes, I was making a point that the current system *does* lock you into choices. Go a melee build, 15 in STR, you're 'gunna have a bad time bringing a scorchbeast to the ground in late game content, but you will wreck anything on the ground
---
Choices / consequences
---
It is in essence. a massive online multiplayer game that should hold you over nigh indefinitely. in a perfect world they would release enough content to keep you playing and have enough crafting/sidequests/whatever to keep you playing until the new content.
---
Hahaha
---
But hang on, isn't that the robots job?
---
Upvote for more attention. That really sucks. You spent a lot of time to build an in game business and community. You are the poster child for what can be done in this open world game. I really hope someone from Bethesda sees this and is able to help you. Condolences my friend.

Found this article, that, for the Xbox, you DO have the option to "Block" AND "Block for Session". So, is it just a PS4 problem? or was this changed in one of the patches to only have "Block" (Because the article is old)
---
We are supposedly aren't we? 
---
You should be fine if you don't loot too much in one run.
---
I saw some today but I’m not sure if I picked them up or if I saw em on a vendor. If it was a vendor then it’s either the one at the top of the world, the train station that’s right there, or the one up at the end of the railroad tracks by the sons of Dane compound. 
---
Good tip, thanks
---
Now just gotta get passed the spinning loot load circle...
---
&gt; Although I can't help but think though that any ongoing game has a right to generate an ongoing income stream.
---
Absolutely, and it's fine to sell cosmetic micro-transactions that bring actual value. I don't think anyone would protest if the Vault-Tec, Blackbird, All-American or camo pints cost $2, but Bethesda wants $18. This is premium cosmetic transaction cost in a game that sold at full retail price.
---
This is why I think they should throw us a bone and give us at least basic customization options in the base game.
---
You can't get it on PS4 because they are pc games. You wil need to login on the Bethesda launcher on a pc to download them.
---
I could see this working. Essentially early players would have options for getting decent gear but without being able to get OP too early. Then in the late game players would be able to trade for high-value gear.

I completely agree. It feels very lonely in the wasteland. This game is about being lonely, about finding corpses of people whose stories you've been finding.
---
My favourite is when ghouls drop below terrain (stairs) ar Whitesprings...
---
I agree, but there needs to be some serious balancing. If you nerf TSE into the ground you’ll end up with all melee. Maybe something as simple as not making demolition expert apply to the explosive effect and instead a flat, say 15-25, damage from explosive. 
---
This still makes TSE strong, but it won’t 1 shot the whole resort. 
---
Hmm I faintly remember seeing a tweet saying consoles will get it as well. Guess I was wrong 
---
There's a Bounty Hunter group on Facebook that would love to fulfill your wants.
---
Just saw a black cat for the first time last night in 80 levels.
---
Fill the trenches with the unlooted meatpiles we leave in the grass
---
I am with Polish here i would willingly give up my TSE shotgun even my melee if needed to see this issue corrected.
---
I feel like Harpers Ferry gets farmed by quite a few people.
---
You act like tse weapons are hacked items. They allowed two shot and explosive to be on the same weapon because they wanted to. It's a legitimate item, op or not. If someone grinded hundreds of hours and got a tse drop, they every right in the damn world to use that weapon and be pissed as hell to lose it. If I spent 300 hours playing a game grinding for end game loot, looted one of the top weapons in the game, and then someone took my weapon away cuz some kids on reddit thought it was too powerful, you bet your ass I'd quit too. Everyone who used them would. 
---
Games have metas and they always will. Nerfing is one thing but to completely take away a legitimate item is wrong. 
---
Beats me. 
---
Wow someone liking a niche thing is killing the industry, it's not like a game development company would look at sales and reviews and could see that. Yep, fuck people who like nice things, what a prick. You honestly sound like that one guy who thinks you can please everyone, then you go ahead and bash people who appeal to a particular or niche audience.  
---
There is wiggle room to compare and see how games perform. For example take Monster Hunter World, objectively it isn't a great FPS because it isn't, but objectively it is a third person game and the controls are pretty tight from my experience.  
---
Ok I'll expand on what I meant. Take Vermintide, the gameplay wasn't the best imo so the game is eh, but because I think the world is pretty well crafted and the story is decent (the atmostphere feels good) it raises it above what it was through other means.
---
I have it set as a searchable component and it doesn't scrap. 
---
I guess that plan failed. They have to fix so many bugs that new content will take a while.
---
&gt; Remove the roof, or upper floor, then place the object down, and then put your roof back on.
---
You can fix that too
---
Name?
---
It is exceptionally frustrating in this game that you must chose between a decent camp structure, decent defense, and decent production.
---
Defense wouldn't be so awful if the turrets did top at 15. And if you don't have at least a couple, you'll have rats or mongrels busting all your crops and purifiers and stuff.
---
The Bethesda account will get and you can download them on pc If you have one
---
Damn straight.
---
I agree but from what I'm seeing most folks are not even trying other sites. I nuked toxic Valley and it wasn't great for XP yes, but it looked cool and we got some deathclaws and a few ghoul mobs and a mirelurk queen. 
---
Also nuked the ash Heap and got three Scorch beasts at once, plus a good amount of high-level mole-men and super mutants. If folks can get the XP needle out of their arm, nuking unique sites as is can be a nice change of pace.
---
Ah I see so if I have it on PS4 I can download it on PC and play on PC.
---
Take me hoooomme
---
Are gatling guns OP? This is a legit question because I see a lot of things listed as hard to kill that I kill in 3 shots with my plain not legendary lvl 50 gatling gun. I mean three shots literally. Scorchbeasts drop in under 100 shots too, less if they land (because of missing my shots).
---
This is legit confusion on my part because my experience is seemingly so far from the norm I see presented here. 
---
Well said.
---
I have to say that this hasn’t worked reliably in my experience. Since Beta I’ve been trying to figure out how those beasties operate, and ‘kill the little guys’ was  pretty high on my list for testing ‘forces landings’, shortly after VATS spamming the wings. 
---
As far as I can tell, they operate on a cycle with checks after every action. They spawn groups of scorched periodically, but these don’t seem to have any effect on the SB itself, other than blocking landing areas and placeholding so no more can spawn. 
---
When They aren’t bugged, they spam their energy cone 3-4 times, with relocate opportunities between each shot, before rolling on what seems to be a 50/50. After the final cone, they either drop their gas clouds, or they check to land. 
---
To land, their ‘target’ has to be directly in front of them, and the space between the SB and their target has to be empty/unobstructed, and no HUGE damage has been dealt to the SB during their last cycle. If that lines up, the SB will land. They don’t just drop, they drop and move forwards. Important to now when checking for ‘empty space’. 
---
The only way I’ve seen to ‘force’ a land check is to cripple the wings. 
---
I’m guessing what you’re seeing is a result of a melee build. You’re running towards the scorched to hit them, and by doing so you’re either filling the ‘land space’ with Scorched, or leaving the area you have to be in to trigger a land (seems to be a cone directly in front of the SB). After you kill the minions, chances are you’re standing pretty still and essentially waiting for the landing. 
---
That’s the trick. Standing still. In empty space. The SB AI will -try- to line up and put itself in a position to land, but that’s hard to do when there are other things going on, or the aggro target is hopping between minions. 
---
As I said, this is all just personal experience, but I feel it needs a little more testing before you say ‘killing minions will make the SB land’ as a fact. I haven’t played as much recently, and I’ve read the behaviour has been updated, so I may be entirely wrong. 
---
If you want to be taken seriously, remove your second bullet point. 
---
I'm laughing because OP is apparently an exploding weapons dealer, the weapons that are currently notorious for "ruining the game". They should be extremely rare but apparently cheaters have proliferated them throughout the game economy. So part of me finds the whole "those OP sold exploding weapons to" seeking revenge for ruining his gaming experience kinda ironic.
---
Yes you can download the trilogy on pc
---
Redpill r/fallout really coming on in droves..
---
Wait, what? How Can you do that?
---
What's your gamertag 
---
Nope, only if you damage it
---
F76 is not a MMO... That is all. (Crafting bag is worth 15 a month by itself for sure)
---
Not too far from the lucky hole mine.  Close enough to Fort Defiance that scorched wander up sometimes.
---
Might be tricentennial.
---
I often get random damage. I've given up stopping to look for the cause. Enemies spawning in right in front (or behind) you is really jarring. Yesterday I spent ages clearing the high level super mutants from an area. Had a one-on-one with the boss and was half-way to looting his corpse when the whole lot respawned right in front of me. My stealth-focused character was forced to retreat and killed, then I dealt with them all again after I respawned.
---
How doea Bethesda tell the difference between duped and earned gear?  If they could do that they could simply delete all the duped gear and move on.
---
just a bit annoying when I’m trying to have fun killing glowing ones lol 
---
They broke it in one of the patches in December. They were trying to fix it so you couldn't place an item down, store it then pick a variant from the same row that you have locked before placing it down again (which is fixed) but then they broke or took away the ability to place stored items your friends built you that you don't have unlocked yet which makes building with friends pointless now. Only way to keep it is to not store it (which means you can't move locations) or find the plan. 
---
Thanks, I'm on PS4 indeed but I don't know if I find the time and patience to do everything again. I learned all camp plans but 2, all serum recipes and some rare PA plans (various jetpacks &amp; calibrated shocks) and I don't think I could replace my armor set. 3 of 5 parts were godroll. But may I give it another try somewhen... I love Fallout and FO76 turned to be my favorite despite all it's issues. But for now this loss of pipboy &amp; inventory cracks me up.
---
I am afraid we will get alot of the FO4 items back in the atom shop. I sure hope not that way!
---
Any update on how it went? The other day a redditor posted that he was willing to make weapons, armor etc for anyone who wanted, regardless of lvl. I responded, and signed on. We joined teams and he made me 2 guns and gave me a power armor frame. Then we went and he let me Finnish off 8-10 mole miners after he nearly killed, for the XP. 
---
After all this 8 asked him. So how many people have you helped so far? He told me I was the first... As we were leaving his camp for a vendor he said he got a team request from someone else. Just after that, we both got kicked from the server. 
---
76 feels more like a single player game with an online component over an MMO style like Warframe. Been bored for awhile now so our group just spends the time helping others until new content. But even that can get a tad boring.
---
For real. I don't know much about the lore but it seems odd that Nuka-Cola would have a promotion that lets you trade bottle caps for bullets. For that matter, what was going on that they had a need for ammo vending machines at all? And let's say they did have a need for it, whatever, what is stopping me from tearing the thing open and just taking the inventory?! 
---
They said that everyone that owns Fallout 76 on pc or console can claim the Fallout trilogy on a pc. The trilogy collection games are a bit older and can probably be played on almost any modern pc. It is a lot different compared to FO3, FO4 and FO76.
---
I feel your pain.  
---
I exit'ed my excavator armor in my camp, went to craft, game crashed, and armor was PFFFT gone.  Now I &gt;ALWAYS&lt; collect it as soon as I exit.   As long as it is in your inventory, it seems relatively safe.
---
Same thing happened to me today.  My fault though.  I logged out at Whitesprings without PA on, trying out some new found armor loot.   Logged in to go sell other loot I got last night......start running towards the hotel door and the screen turns red and realize I’m in a blast zone.   Respawn at my camp with Eagle Eyes......on a melee build.
---
Don’t blame you one bit. 
---
The door is to your left, please have a nice day
---
There was a different one before, but I believe it has changed to "Fallout 76 Appalachia Minutemen (Xbox One)" now.
---
I seen that in action, and such guys are really hard to kill. Explosive is pretty much useless. What we found in testing is that gamma gun does enough damage that if you gathered 6 people with gamma guns its possible to take such fortress down xD
---
I prefer not being a turret tho
---
Alright sjw relax
---
But... *I* like it
---
You ok, bro?
---
They can certainly say that they are patching item duplication. That being said, they have said that they have done that in the past and they didn't. 
---
The edge is strong with this one. But hey, I can understand, I'd be frustrated to if I was a fan of the Magic.
---
Blackwater mine east from whitesprings. You get rads pretty quickly and theres decontamination showers in the mine there as well
---
Do you need a hug? 
---
do people use "redpill" to actually mean "enlighten" because if so, omfg lol. if anything redpill was lingo for the most brainwashed morons i've had the misfortune to mistakenly lay eyes upon
---
fallout 76 is an embarrassment. 
---
Someone was probably just bad 😂
---
We haven’t done it yet. I’m going to work on details tonight and post it tomorrow with a date👍🏻
---
Yeah their really fuckin it up man 
---
Thank you for your opinion, I disagree on several points but at least you got to vent. Hope you feel better.

Location: keypad locked room in Tanagra town (a trailer backs up to the warehouse containing it).  This room is contained within the same 2 room building as several bunk beds.
---
* You will have to discover how to enter the room on your own.  I am merely disclosing the location this plan spawns. 
---
Please OP, tell us how you really feel.
---
The protectron vendor I saw had a pack brahmin, so I’m sure this was the elusive one other people have seen.
---
It's at the silo in the savage divide I can't remember which one but is the one by some small lakes
---
I’m not blaming anyone, just suggesting solutions since the game doesn’t present the issue to me implying he should investigate whether it’s an individual issue.
---
The video game dictator
---
Too many salsbury steaks me thinks. 
---
That was fast. I like the *real fake door*.
---
Very clever!
---
Ey chief, you got any sauce for those spicy accusations?
---
But then you couldn’t scrap it for that scarce, highly-valuable cloth! 🤔
---
You can only harvest flux from blast zones, regardless of level.
---
Oh, the daily attention seeking post has arrived!
---
yeah I do believe world spawn items like that are single spawns.  First come first served.
---
Pre-war money was still money in FO4, you could easily sell it for more than one cap each without even trying.
---
They've kinda gone to the opposite extreme in 76. They need more sources and avenues of income in general; using prewar money on prewar machines would be a cool atmospheric start, just reduce the amount of paper bills that spawn in the world a little. 
---
As it is now I feel like I've screwed up if I don't visit every. single. vendor. every 24 hours. and drain them of every cap they have. 
---
Where did you find it in your build menu? Cant find the damn thing for the life of me
---
Gamma, now that is smart!
---
You earn it legitimately alright, but have you heard the saying one bad apple spoils the bunch? Because of the dupping the type of weapon, IT has flooded the game. A lot of people, the vast majority, acquired this through dupping. Because of that unfortunately to mass alter anything with the code for any TSE out there doesn't seem like a full loss to me to determine to just quit the game. Seems like a child crying over spilt milk. I work a full time job and have a life outside of gaming, however I don't go into nuke zones when I get on because I can't compete with 5 guys armed with TSE weapons. Maybe the game will become harder because you can't cheese the system, but at least it will be more fair to others. 
---
To lock people immobile in place. Rad-x syringer. The single most hated gun ever made. Nice
---
You see the junk node South of whitesprings, my base is there and my artillery cannon (Yes I've been posting this alot) is in range of the golf course or the area people like to build turret bases to farm.
---
I love my artillery cannon, if only I have enough budget to build more.
---
What level?
---
If you notice wherever SB spawn, there’s usually scorched handlers or leaders or whatever.
---
They attack in pairs 
---
It would be easy for them to create an algorithm to look at server side quantities in player inventories and just start banning folks.   Someone duping a weapon or jet pack for their buddy isn’t the issue.  It’s the guys that have hundreds and thousands of these selling them on eBay and such.  Ban those accounts, then set up the auction house.
---
They added field of view, not sure about dof 
---
I like this a lot and really hoped the game would have this from launch. It makes sense to have multiple bosses in different areas. This would make the game sooooooo much more fun. 
---
Great. It’s EpicZephos. I’ll be on in an hour or so.
---
Lol more server space for us..he probably got mad cause he got killed in Fortnite so he comes here and whines
---
Waaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!
---
Surrender to your reptilian overlords, ascend beyond limitations of the flesh, take the role you have been destined to, or perish at your own will
---
Because in the long run that’s what happens. Game releasesin some sort of imperfect state, gets patched later. People who are upset about the issue(s) eventually get over it.
---
At launch everything takes forever to the players, yet in the grand scheme of things fixes tend to happen right away.
---
I mean, let’s say they fix duping in its entirety, address perk cards, increase stash to 1,000 and buff durability of many weapons on Monday.
---
Within ~2 months they would have addressed the most pressing issues, which includes at least ~2.5 weeks off for two major holidays, for a game that’s meant to be updated and supported for years.
---
Basically companies look at these things as a snapshot in time and just plan long term.
---
Historically they’re in the right, but the problem is they keep pushing what counts as an acceptable launch state. I’m one of those people who just aren’t bothered by games having a rough launch so long as I have a sense the company will keep fixing it. 
---
But now I’m actually getting pissed off, gaming companies are just pushing things too far.
---
And people like me, I find, don’t really give any indicators before we’ve been pushed too far and just stop using/buying a product.
---
Do the pets you tame survive logging out/in?
---
I do what I want, buttnuts.   
---
That's right. You've got a butt full of nuts. I said it.
---
I've made a huge mistake
---
I’m lvl 80 i would like a lvl 45 or higher 
---
The melee guys never bothered me. As long range in events I just sit high and hit from a distance while they run around and clean up. Pvp sucks against them if you can't get away but I rather fight a melee in pvp than a trigger happy TSE user. 
---
[answers to your question are here. clicky click. ](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Bottle_cap) 
---
New one. Not out yet. They've done this a lot with the Atom Shop items.
---
This is the best thing I have ever read😂😂
---
my point is that you said I should reevaluate the reasons why I play the game if they removed tse or wiped them.
---
well, getting one is the single point of the game as it is so I'd say my reasons are pretty sound.
---
Let me check my mule character.  I think I have a spare Bloodied Super Sledge.
---
I love the look, much prettier than my bridge in the same spot! Would be funny if you were the reason I couldn't place my bridge once. Mine is more practical with the roof for crossing and walls on the underside to protect the water filter and items. I put a half circle of triangle floorings instead of fences to protect the crops. I'm considering removing the turrets because the mutants have never attacked them.
---
Yes at a few stations I think
---
Thanks dude
---
There are like 30+ different kinds of maps. I have not counted them. But when people offered 30 maps for 3 serums they mostly had a lot of different ones in their inventory. This seems indeed legit to me.     
---
     
---
Of course there were some with hundreds of maps of 1 kind but I aborted all trades when I saw this in their inventory. Serums get duped too so I won't supply players who trade with dupers or dupe themselves.     
---
      
---
Sometimes it's not easy to draw the line between hardcore gamer and 'low budget duper' but after hundreds of trades you're fairly skilled at quickly checking other inventories for hints of duping.
---
actually the hardest fucking games when i was getting into new vegas. 
---
i was 12, fell in love with the game. got the others and the classic bundle on steam for 5$. wow! tried it out, fucking died 5 mins in to a radscorpion. what the fuck.  
---
i love em now though but i was like holy hell
---
Nearly unplayable, so 9.
---
I have NEVER seen a game crash right out to the Xbox dashboard before.  F76 does it repeatedly.
---
It’s not just the xp. It’s the amount of enemies and legendary enemies at whitesprings that allures a lot of people. Even with no nuke there are still tons of legendaries to be killed and they respawn quickly. You basically run a loop and by the end of the loop the start has respawned. 
---
Here's what I think:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ae0cul/feature_requests_craftingplans_edition/
---
So I'm totally in agreement with you.
---
None of us were are ok with the state it was released in. But online games like this will grow and change with time. Look at ESO compare its launch to its current state. Its almost like two different games.
---
"Almost heaven, West Virginia"
---
you have no idea how many op items are in the game right now. explosives are hardly the end all. I can think of at least 2 other combos that are just as bad.
---
in the end you're just shitting on everyone's parade for no reason. congrats.
---
Mrmeowsir
---
Be aware that vendors can sell you items other players sold them. JSYK, it's hardly foolproof either. 
---
Explosives are fun, but be aware that silos are cramped and Assaultrons love to close the distance fast. Make sure you always have something good for CQC! 
---
I doubt it, from the one picture I could find of X0-1 tricentennial, it’s like 97% dark blue
---
IMO, unfortunately modern gamers failed D3. with the exception of the real money AH.. it was better on release than it is now.
---
Any way you could make this a positive? You have no choice but to start off fresh. You still have all the memories and friends, and you gained a reason to play through the game again. That said, you probably had a perfect character and now you don't. But, you could again...
---
"Ground" isn't a solid object, is the thing. What you describe would be hard to pull off in even a modern 3D engine; in this, it is likely impossible.
---
That's why, for example, the "Root Cellar" in FO4 is not really a door into a cellar; it's a button you push that teleports you to another worldspace.
---
Thanks but I already knew that
---
Definitely
---
Yeah it's great, I fucking love it.
---
Thank you so much. But I'm just a average serum salesman who always gets harassed by scorched vandals attacking his little shop.
---
Message me I’m on gt themisterphenix

Xbox one
---
Gatling laser will show remaining round count as the number of fusion cores you have if you switch to a different weapon then back to the Gatling laser. 
---
The one time I did it he started singing happy birthday to a boarded up door. Pretty depressing. 
---
Maybe you wouldn't care if legitimate weapons were take away because you haven't found one. I'm not saying I have. I've bought my gear from other players and I'm sure they are probably duped copies. But there are people out there who don't even know reddit exists. Don't know duping exists, and have never even traded with another real player. Imagine they logged in one day to find their items gone because someone like you is a bit salty they don't have one. Those people would so pissed its ridiculous. Reddit probably doesn't even consist of a quarter of all players, how many people would wake up to find their stuff missing with no explanation? You can not just delete an item out of a game because some people don't like their power. 
---
The mannequins is a different encounter. So OP is seeing two at the same time.
---
Yeah the continuity here is really odd. You see skeletons in day to day positions like in f3/4/nv that suggest the bombs hit WV, but other parts of the world say the bombs didn't directly hit and people died out due to other causes. You have plenty of bodies in hospital beds and what not, some of which suggest they may as well have died a few hours before you got there. Then there are encounters like dead settlers surrounded by a deathclaw or scorched, which again implies they died a mere hour ago. 
---
Actually, they’re not all legendary.
---
And only some legendary effects cause a chance to heal if I’m not mistaken.
---
Your last 3 are actually all come down to one problem, which they actually communicated very clearly to everybody before this game was even available for pre order and that was that making gamebryo a multiplayer online gaming engine was both entirely new to them but also pushing the limits of their abilities.
---
They also told us that this was a project they had wanted to do since the first 3D fallout iteration, that if they ever did it, that it would be a very 'prototype' game, one that would be a rocky road for both them and the players.
---
Theyve been far more transparent than most developers.
---
Let me guess, you had trouble building your camp on the golf course?
---
They're uncommon but I've seen several in areas around the mire and cranberry bog.
---
Dude, come on. You've deleted and remade the same thread FOUR times. 
---
Excellent post, thank you.
---
Thanks, you're right at some point. I will consider it for sure but I may won't have enought time. Took 2 weeks off for FO76 release &amp; 2 more weeks for xmas - now it's time to work again :/
---
You need it if you like bullets :P
---
I don't think I've seen those before, either! What do they look like?
---
i couldn’t build next to my friend near new gad. we had to be on opposite sides of the lake :( 
---
Also i'd recommend what type of player you are &amp; what you're looking for from the PT.  I recently joined up with someone &amp; because of their tight schedule/low gametime available they have to race thru everything pretty quickly.  As i'm a slower paced player it wasn't so much fun trying to keep up with a similar level char.  I didn't mind just backing them up with one of my higher levels &amp; building equipment for them though.
---
Hey /u/LoneVaultWanderer help this guy out.
---
I shelled out a ton of caps for X-01 armor mods.  Then realized I didn't have all the materials to attach them so I went to claim some workshops.  Building up the workshops + defenses actually SCRAPPED the mods.  (Did not know about that mechanism, but it's mentioned here in a lot of posts).  
---
So, hell yes I would pay someone $5-$10 to drop off a new set of Power Armor with the missing mods already attached.   
---
Fix the damn game, BETHESDA
---
For me the issue is always steel or sometimes lead, not the thousands of bits of gunpowder sitting around
---
Hm. Hang on, I'm logging in real quick.
---
Huh. I don't recognize it either. 
---
I got them as event rewards a few times 
---
You can have neighbors, just not next door neighbors. 
---
Or mainframe cores to make other mainframe cores...
---
I found a pair on my second session in the beta, though honestly can’t say I’ve noticed any since. I do think however they have static spawn locations in world, which means anyone can walk to that spot and find them, unless someone has already picked up that instance of them.
---
You guys are shit out of luck if you think theyre going to punish 1/3 of the games playerbase.
---
They are however beating the life out of two shot explosives, so considering theyre the primary trade commodity, the value most of the duped items hold is going to fall significantly.
---
Now that I think of it,  I think that's where my power fist mod went :/
---
No they have to be a certain distance away from another camp, but it would dope as hell if they could. 
---
They need to use John Denver's country roads version, the original
---
Great write up for finding some of those elusive plans and recipes. I can offer one/two more for Harper's Ferry that I do on my daily 200 cap selling run. Right by the Vendor bot is a damaged house with a level 3 safe that I've gotten random plans from. From there, you can jump onto the balcony already mentioned for a random recipe.
---
After that go behind the Vendor Bot where there is a Chemistry Workbench with free chems. The first door on the left, there is a table with a recipe on it along with a trap with a free laser weapon to decon for some plastic. :)
---
Yup, but it makes your realize 'oh shit, the world only ended 25 years ago'
---
Are you considering open water to be a resource?  If so, there are a ton.  If not, just a few.
---
The Whitesprings robots were programmed to accept caps as part of a Nuka-Cola promotion, this part is true. HOWEVER, the other vendors and vending machines accept caps because they were reprogrammed to accept them by their affiliated faction (raiders, brotherhood, free states, etc.) once caps became the standard currency post-war. Caps have been used by Humans and A.I. alike in every other Fallout game. People seem to forget that there was a fully functioning post-war society BEFORE we left Vault 76 - which is why the remaining A.I. accept caps. I don’t want to sound like a douchey snob but try to avoid listening to people who’s first Fallout game is most likely 76. 
---
I'm sorry this happened to you. I hope Bethesda fixes their game fast , because people like you are leaving en mass, and the dupers/exploiters are sticking around. Like wtf? Cmon Bethesda, shame on you all. 
---
Still today.
---
Wat, on shotguns two shot only adds one pellet, get yourself an armor piercing explosive shotgun, infinitely more powerful.
---
Lol yeah it was a couple of plasma pistol plans, a laser pistol, and I think a .44 plan. Like, no thanks.
---
When you come across a post like this just check OPs history. He has a habit of trashing games that receive critical and public acclaim. He also trashes games that have little critical or public acclaim.
---
 Basically I am saying that this guy is trash and wants other things to he more like him.
---
Oh snap, I’ve had that exact event at whitesprings. I snapped a pic of the babies, only seen it that once though.
---
In the end, the mother kicks their ass 
---
I understand that angle for sure. 
---
I just really wish pistols packed more of a punch without relying on VATS is all. 
---
They're my favorite weapon type to use and they just feel better in the other games I think. 
---
how come I can use a stealth boy to avoid them then
---
Even on a new session, not in a group at all, just having it on was stripping my bird bones benefits away
---
Probably a way to get you hyped about it and buy it when its released 
---
it's high noon
---
I just looked at all the paints released unless my googling was faulty. I don't see it. It may indeed be unreleased up and coming.
---
Being color blind makes reading that map really fun
---
Thing is, it's often the server actually crashing. As a result it would have to restart and the world would be reset anyway.
---
Honestly, the only robots/machines that should go off caps are those at the Whitesprings, as they are explained in game due to a promo even that Nuka Cola was doing for Quantum (which was to be released on the day the bombs fell)
---
Will do I’ll message you here in 20 
---
I don't see why this sub is text only just because r/fallout is. I mean what's the big deal?
---
Currently sitting on water and lead
---
It has kinda gone under the radar but the whole "have no tools to delete or add items to inventory" thing is absolutely unaceptable for an online game, especially one as buggy as this. After playing WoW I was under the impression that this kind of restoration service was considered standard when online is involved. I know if I were to lose a significant amount of my progress without having it restored I would just bounce, fuck that. It even makes me wary to play it at all knowing that it *might* happen.
---
Shit man it was a bloody goodwill handout, not something you paid for.
---
No shit, I did a very similar thing in about the same spot. Yours looks significantly better than mine did, though. 
---
Or I enjoy the game with my friends 
---
Not sure having no repercussions for exploiting the game will do well for its life span. Because it means the next lot found will then be abused by everyone. The punishment could just be a small punishment but something to deter future exploiters.
---
Yup, it's a pretty good event for the reward, as it's like having a certain perk for an hour and NOT needing to be in a group.  You can stack it with Cranberry Cobbler for 5% more exp, and Cranberry juice, for a total of 12% xp boost without any perks needed
---
Between 1 and 23.
---
would you rather pay a steeper price for cosmetics, and receive content/dlc updates for free, or pay fairer prices for cosmetics, but have to pay for DLC?
---
It would be cool if we had a system like FNV where each faction or group had their own currency. That would help us with the issues of having too many caps and nothing to spend them on, offloading spare gear we don't need, and even the limited lore. Imagine if the free states only traded for guns, bullets, and food. The vendor bot literally tells you that government regulation is evil, and yet he uses the government's money. Enclave could use pre war money, responders could take general supplies or maybe even just everything. There is so much potential with having these drastically different landscapes and separate factions
---
OK, so I checked. Its not the forest camp jumpsuit its the forest operative underarmor
---
What system? I have a medics legendary with 10% while aiming 
---
What’s in the space station?
---
Ahh. I mean that's true, but that would eat up the budget.
---
I wonder if the angle changes depending on where you are on the launchpad?
---
All i’ve found with the skeet shooter perk is that the damage drop-off is helped noticeably at a distance while running the perk. I could be wrong and just taking farther shots when i have it equipped though. Very curious as well, I love running the pump when I’m bored of being a rifleman for my squad.
---
Only thing I can think of is a dunce hat, looking at you GTAV.
---
xbox
---
For the record ive found 2 different explosive based weapons. One being a TSE shotty. I don't use shotguns on my build so I vendor any firearm I don't use if I can't scrap it. Even if I had found a TSE pipe rifle I would happily give it up knowing how OP it would be in my sniper build to bring balance.  Sometimes an unpopular action has to happen for the better of the rest of the community. If you end up taking it too personally, maybe you need a reminder it's just a game and the community wants balance. Now calling me salty is pretty childish because I ask a question for a possible solution to a very game damaging issue. 
---
That's also good to know I assume those come from cranberry bog?
---
I have a feeling they won't even consider bringing human NPCs because of some sort of twisted ego/pride issue.  Even though it did not work out at all due to server limits, lack of game mechanics letting players take on traditional human NPC roles, and lack of persistent private servers Bethesda will not go back on their 'vision'.   I hope they realize unless they drastically change their code base their vision just isn't possible and do the humble and right thing and just say 'It didn't work out, let's give it up and make a much better game'.  They just don't seem to be able to admit any wrong and it is hurting things.
---
I have a 1* Bloodied Super Sledge and a 1* Bloodied Multi-Purpose Axe.
---
Seems like it
---
The game would essentially become Ark survival evolved 
---
Thanks for posting up what you have seen. I have leveled over 6 different builds to level 80 and it seems to be the case with every build that I have ran. The only place that it does not work 100% is at Line in the Sand at Fort Defiance. The SB is normally targeting the Surface to Air Missile Launcher. 
---
There is something to point out in what you say. From my experience when it is getting ready to land or to release a gas strafing run, the creature scans like the Orbital Scanner grenade. If you aren't targeted then it flies over where you were at without landing. I have had the SB land on buildings, on trains and clip into them, on top of other creatures and begin fighting them (then forget about me and fly away..) as well as in the Tree Top fast travel location. 
---
The concept is recognizing the basic mechanics and if you aren't hiding inside or under cover then it will land. The SB will even land if you are under cover or hiding and you take out the minion scorched. I do understand that it lands and runs forward with a dash attack. The pattern I've seen isn't just from 50 that I tested, but from over 250+ hours of gameplay, blue screens, server crashes, laggy nuke server time outs and ect. 
---
All in all the concept is simple. Kill minions and it will land. On my current character, I only shoot them with the Long Scope Recon Endangerol Syringer without using VATS at all to tag the creature, go kill minions, it drops down, I kill it with melee and move on.
---
I appreciate you bringing up your issues and hopefully the future updates will bring us brighter days ahead.
---
They are a guaranteed spawn downstairs at whitesprings club.

---
Ohh?, care to explain.
---
Holy fuck, my fucking jugular vein was just cut by how edgy you are. Please call for goddamn help, I am losing blood fast!
---
You don't like the game but you want to bitch and whine on the Internet about it on a sub for the game. That is definitely not an embarrassing choice of how you spend your time. You are the embodiment of redpill. You are so woke, dude. I am jelly.
---
If we are actually tackling it, I rather enjoyed the Fire Breathers; little test, some PT test, and then some casual killing in a cool looking mine. Only regret is there isn't a massive swarm to feel overwhelmed.
---
Thanks.  Honestly I think this is where alot of the problem is, most people want the Inside the Vault's to be more of a 'change log' type deal, when it's not, it's a 'this is where we are going with things, what's taking our time, and what you should expect going forward, but more precise details will become available when they are finalized'
---
Like others have said, I would love it, especially when duping is fixed. 
---
I also really hope they don't have limitations on what and how much you can sell. 
---
I mean, due to my totally chill play style where I don't really buy anything, I don't really need the caps myself - but I want to be able to farm, sell, buy stuff for newbies, and help them out. 
---
And it would make the (imo, not immersive and frustrating) server hopping for plans, etc. unnecessary.
---
I don't know, man. There's something about that Cram too....
---
r/fo76bazaar

Edgy and original

Currently the thing i care about more than anythings is horrible, horrible, oh my god how it is horrible graphic bug with new render technique. And I am speaking not about occasional neck stretch for scorched, I am speaking about whiteness at 14:00 - 17:00 PM in game. At day, game turns into visual nightmare, there is no shadows, everething looks like not rendered at all, with brightness levels clearly broken. This needs to be addressed ASAP, because it makes the game look simply damn horrible... it feels like damn hell how crazy bad game looks, and it is clearly a bug that can be solved, because sometimes on some cells it looks fine.
---
Is the heat out in mom’s basement or something?
---
For the juice, yes.  There is a farm in The Forest area that has some cranberry plants at it, which is what you use for the cobbler.
---
I'd rather get 3 dlc packs than 3 sets of power armor skins for the same money
---
hmmm...think I had the same thing happen to me, thanks for posting. Had no issues with upwards of 60 maps on a few spits, but got disconnected in the mire. Loged back into a naked, pipboy-less character.
---
Sucks since treasure maps were easy to snag off folks. Seemed they didn't want to bother with it.
---
Yeah, it is dumb, and unlike the scrapping of mods everybody has done it. At least you have the flux to vendor, providing you still can get caps today. 
---
&gt; Make caps worthless to everyone by making them even easier to get.
---
But they're already simple to get. The markets quickly moved from caps to item-for-item with many players legitimately starting to hit the cap limit. A Bethesda Fallout title has never had an "economy" and will never have one. It's the current "legitimate" (note the quotes) players that believe things like 1400 (or 1200 if they're behind) caps are the limit per day padded out by cap stashes. The earnable in-game (no shenanigans) caps is double that with some effort. That's max caps in 10 days with no exploits running a plain old MMO circuit.
---
&gt; Nobody wants a level 35-40 TSE weapon when they can have a level 45-50 TSE weapon.
---
Obsoleting old gear is definitely the way to go, but even without duping you're going to run into squads with excess and solos (filthy casuals /s) with none.
---
Personally, I think Bethesda dropped the ball with general play-style balance and in-game crafting. Right now, and for the foreseeable future, combat is heavily rewarded while other activities are simply not. Everything funnels into the Two-Shot Explosive Shotgun (or Three-Shot Explosive if we're going with point #5) and there are easily abused combat exploits beyond a duped TSE.
---
The upcoming patch is supposed to introduce some tweaking to legendary affixes and also said something about plans (I think). Those two things should give players some more reward as long as they're able to balance out play-styles.
---
To be clear, balancing out play-styles would allow people to get the same (or at least close) reward for their decisions. Crafters should have some sort of goal. Energy weapon toons should be able to pewpewpew until their little fusion powered hearts are content. No one is going to care about TSE or duped TSE if they aren't forced into the funnel that is present right now.
---
Swarms.... there should be SWARMS of enemies everywhere i nuke is dropped. FUCKING SWARMS.
---
If you come to visit you'll be bored to tears.
---
We haven't paid the phone bill in three hundred years.
---
Single point of the game is to survive nuclear holocaust, not to find a weapon that is TSE. Are you even playing the same game? 
---
Dude needs to get laid.
---
Players in GTAV that abused exploits or were generally toxic got a paper hat on their head that couldnt be removed that read 'Dunce' for a period of time. Just a punishment in the means of public shaming.
---
Yeah I didn’t check before I told you! Sorry dude! That usually has all my game stats🤔
---
What games would you like me to enjoy, stranger on the Internet?
---
There are on a table in the diner by the Watoga shopping plaza vendor every single time I've ever checked, so no. 
---
thanks
---
The only time you can't juggle cards easily is in combat, and most people prep for serious outings (blast zones, clearing buildings, etc) it by setting up a specific set.  For any other situation the only impact caused by swapping cards, is increasing wasted play time and annoying players.
---
The limit of per card ranks = number of SPECIAL points was a cute idea, but an awful one in practice.  Just dump it, or at the very least roll back to F4 version where it's the number of cards, NOT the rank of the card that counts towards the total.
---
I would agree to nurf TSE except the fact Scorched Beasts would be hard to kill otherwise.
---
Thats not my point. My intended point was if they're wanting to do something thats clearly a "we're sorry" deal they maybe shouldn't have done something that 2/3 of the systems cant even play. Maybe PC gets this and Xbox and PS users get a deal, or all three systems get a deal they all can actually do something with.
---
Ok but like, there will always be OP weapons. It is called a meta. No matter what you do, no matter how much you think its op, there will be a best weapon or at least a best legendary effect. If they removed tse, then you'd cry about bloodied instead. 
---
Dont' have a grognaks, but got a lvl 50 super sledge w/ Instigating + swing speed + 1 strength; its my main melee weapon.  IIRC grognak &amp; super sledge are same damage. 
---
Roleplaying a vault-dweller gone raider is outside the scope of this game? I must have missed the part where he took responsibility for the lack of human NPCs, clunky combat, empty storyline, dependence on an outdated game engine, server drops, nerfed stash limit, numerous useless perk cards, imbalanced weapon stats, relentless duping, inexplicable/incompatible lore retcons... But maybe "other players roleplaying lore-friendly roles in an MMO" is one to add to the list. \&amp;#x1F914; 
---
Set up a C.A.M.P near the Dyer Chemical plant with an industrial purifier and farm Rad Shield.  It goes for 20 caps at vendors (with the vendor perk). You can also make money selling mothman eggs.
---
Do you have the bug where there's a water purifier stored in your stash, but you can't scrap it? That's what is happening with me
---
I never said otherwise, and not sure what that has to with my topic?
---
As long as its optional sure, otherwise it's gonna kill server hopping which in turn will make even more people quit.
---
watoga , harpers ferry , they sell the plans 
---
not really a good close up, but here is the pic I took in them.

---
Yeah thats fair, a freebie from the atom store would have been a better gift to those on console.
---
Yeah dude... sucks
---
big? Thanks you so much!
---
I don’t quite get the second part of what you’re saying 
---
They are rather rare but exist. I remember finding one early on, and then a few later. Also pretty sure some vendors have a decent chance of selling them, like the camden park one
---
You could point yourself at a water source and smash the collect button. I think you can get several dirty water per second this way.
---
I sent you friend requests and messages numerous times on PSN. Please check your friend requests.
---
Define "support". I still play the game but haven't spent a nickel in the Atom store, so how are we any different? We both bought the game, you just quit already. To Bethesda, we both supported the game equally. 
---
I agree that this is frustrating. A buddy and I were walking down the road in the middle of the Mire working on a quest last night, and literally every time we passed another point of interest, BAM, another scorch beast. After the fourth or fifth one in about 15 minutes, we were pretty frustrated, and we're both level 50+. 
---
I remember trying to run as a lower level and being so frustrated with it all. I play melee and I have to try to shoot the dumb thing down with whatever gun I happened to loot last (because I always forget to bring one), and it doesn't always work.
---
One tip I do have, if you're near a place where you can go completely inside something (an instance, with no connection to the outside), that's a good way to get away. Most mines have this, as well as the hospital near Charleston, the Riverside Manor, Morgantown Airport, etc. 
---
Aite I'll stop playing this game I really like because I'm ashamed because you told me to be ashamed :(
---
It takes red and blue paint to repair the commie whacker
---
What console are you on? Just check the different venders regularly. The acoustic instruments plans provide the most options I believe. 
---
I started delving into workshops today to acquire Plans.  I like them conceptually, but server disconnects make me wary of really going whole-hog on them.  Any resources spent to build turrets, generators, extractors, etc. are lost in a disconnect, which is a shame.
---
IMO, rather than being lost, such things should get tossed into a "Stored" inventory for that Workshop, or maybe shared across Workshops, which belong to the player.  A separate, but similar inventory to the CAMP's Stored budget.
---
They are craftable
---
No, they haven't.  
---
So they said "hey guys this our first multiplayer game"; so what? It isn't a new engine (confirmed by testers within the first few MINUTES of BETA), they aren't using many new assets (which is why you can use the BAKA loading tool and use meshes/textures from FO4 in FO76), and they aren't some tiny ass company with little to no resources.  
---
Atlas released as an absolutely buggy piece of garbage, and in 3 weeks has had more patches than 76 will have in 3 months. A lot more. And not all of the patches were good, but at least they acknowledged the issues instead of dancing around them, and took their servers down 2-3 times a day over the holidays to try and improve their game. And they have.  
---
We (the people who are pissed) aren't asking for miracles or for Bethesda to turn water into wine. We just want to see some effort. Some acknowledgement that they're aware of mass dupes ruining their economy, or that legendary weapons are completely fucking broken, or that the servers are about as stable as a house of cards.  
---
So far, they've done nothing. 
---
"We're hoping to apply a patch that will fix some exploits" isn't being transparent. 
---
"We are aware that players have used world-space containers to rapidly dupe legendaries and acquire an inordinate number of items. This is being worked on by doing A, B, and C". THAT is being transparent.  
---
They talked about a new PvP mode. Cool beans. Have they addressed how they plan to implement it? How it's going to be balanced? Is this going to just be a shitshow of people using VATS and 1-shotting each other with Super-sledges, then coming back repeatedly because you can simply respawn in the same location over and over? Or have they actually thought of some decent mechanics to make it fun to play?
---
They COULD put that information out there early, so that if there is heavy backlash they can make tweaks and adjustments and not release something the community hates.
---
But that would require them to be transparent. Which they haven't been thus far.
---
Still need help?
---
Shit even thats not really anything (I say because I have most everything already just from completing challenges cause the game still gives rewardsfor stuff I've already done cause, well, Bathesda), but it is at least something.
---
At least you know your going to get lit up and cam look for cover.  The col gutsy's with the automatic anti tank cannons are what makes cringe.
---
In monster hunter, there's a quick access menu to craft items on the fly or do certain actions- it can kinda look a bit like the shortcut menu on fallout. So like when im fighting a scorchbeast my brain just goes, oh rathalos! Better make some flashpods and knock it out of the sky
---
Ok now that is pretty darn funny and a good deterrent. Would it be possible do you believe for 76 to do.
---
Lolz
---
I’m sure hitler said the same thing.
---
I’m not hurting no one, I’m just picking up trash.
---
I’m not buying your crap.
---
I’m hoping the explosive nerf is that all duped weapons now shoot bubbles. 
---
The game would be so much more interesting if you could kill on sight. With that said the way it's setup now, people in parties shouldn't be able to collect their own bounties, kinda broken.
---
Have you tried dropping the settings to see if it makes any difference?  I mean technically they're not wrong since it appears the 4770k is an older proc than the 6600k which is their "bare minimum".
---
But since performance between the 2 chips is reasonably identical according to "the internet", i don't know if that actually has anything to do with the game crashes.
---
It's weird calling F76 MMO, but I'm with you, it feels like a bad version of borderlands. Diablo works with it's seasons and paragon system but in F76 I'm not sure what to do when you have earned all achievements and found all plans etc? Diablo have their greater rift system which is really good and can sustain the game for a long time with it's competitve direction but F76 doesn't have anyrting rewarding for leveling up over a certain level. I miss the weapon system in borderlands
---
Fun fact, I live in Lancaster county lol
---
Oh, yeah I have found a grand total of 3 pairs in my 100+ hours of playing. They are pretty rare, for sure. I love them :) 
---
Ah Grahm the ever elusive friend that I can never find and has all the plans I want the most! 
---
Better Inventory mod on Nexus.
---
7 on Xbox.
---
Haven’t been server disconnecting since I took a nice redditors advice to switch to WiFi from wired but I still crash to desktop every couple of hours. The only other game I’ve ever that crashed to desktop regularly was PUBG.
---
I’ve also enjoyed a nice bug where all of my camp items are 10 feet in the air and it won’t let me place them until I spammed RT LT while looking up and down until they let me put them on the ground.
---
I came here cause I was looking for this answer, best solution I can figure out is a chameleon squad with radsponge and ghoulish, keep close to each other to avoid rads.
---
Anything you build which shows green resources being used isn’t costing you anything. Only if they’re yellow will they come out of your stash.  
---
Same, GT is metalbars19 but I won’t be on for like 3-4 hours, but I have that for trade if interested but feel free to add/shoot me a message on Xbox to remind me
---
Build up that Camp. You've been around the map, so you've seen some nice places. Explore, looking for that perfect spot to set up. Once you've found that perfect spot, start working on making that camp awesome by hunting down plans and junk to make your camp perfect.
---
Normally, I can tolerate being disconnected, but there are times when it becomes the last straw! For example, when I get disconnected while I am being mercilessly slaughtered trying to get my hard earned loot back!!!!!!
---
I don't even bother crafting gunpowder with how much I'm already looting through normal gameplay.
---
I think you went to the wrong website;  you are supposed to nag like this at Youtube. This is a website for mature people who actually want to give constructive criticism and ways to fix the issues with the game instead of bickering and doing nothing to improve things. Scores are easily bombed and online activity can be easily incorrect especially when a majority are PC users. (Worlds are constantly full for me; hard to get my two friends in with me on pretty much every single join)
---
Looks great.  You should post it to the fallout76settlements sub.
---
Because it's impossible to tell what's already owned. Unless you have a a time machine to go back to November 1st and start taking notes then.
---
Which rugs are "Rug Set 2?" - I can make some rugs but the CAMP interface doesn't even tell you which plan you need to buy to unlock things.
---
Glad u had a great experience already

Go anywhere with super mutants and pick up their guns. Easy to max your sales per day.
---
I would love that
---
Exactly; ESO is proof that it will improve if nothing else. ESO is a top tier MMORPG that is one of the best in the business now.
---
thank you lets see what others will say
---
Doesn't stack but rad shield is better than rad x or diluted rad x and doesn't do anything to mutations
---
GOOD mics are very expensive...
---
if your perception is high enough stealth players' red dots still show up on the compass even if you can't see them. So if you're on level ground you can shoot even if you can't see them. It's awesome! 
---
some guy was setting up an ambush. He was wanted on top of watoga municipal center. I went up there and he had mines laid as traps and brown bag as lure. I wasn't able to kill him but I hit him a bunch of times until he ran away. I bet i freaked him out because he was stealthed the whole time. My per is around 20 depending on buffs. Agi around 23
---
I guess I grew up and lost interest in gaming in general but there's at least one game I can never be tired of, Rocket League! But if we set the actual game aside I know I'm mostly in it for the social part, talking with friends on discord etc, the game is just there to tie us together
---
Oh ye, willing to sell it tho? gt is irredaxium
---
You don't know me or what I am 'up in arms about'.  I was asking about your statement which was to punish strangers for another strangers behavior.  You didn't say the above, you said 'I was going to do something different until you said this'.  
---
I'm pretty sure he's supposed to spawn hostile to the Brahmin and kill them to create a sort of dynamic death scene.
---
well seems like im just a smaller version of you i just wanted to highlight the point not the way to solve it but we really need plans and weapons progress managing factor so we wont need to hoard weapons that are 100% unlocked
---
I find painos to be sold pretty commonly at the charleston station vendor
---
Just because you can one shot people in pvp with a shotgun, from 100 yards away, doesn't mean it needs a nerf!
---
I am on now.  PM me your PSN.
---
Just checked all of his 1month old posts. He doesn't play, or own the game. It's a troll. Downvote it to hell and then move on. He plays rdr2, uses exploits on that, he complains about fallout, claims he's played "sense" we were all in diapers. I guess everyone is a kid on the internet when you don't know how this works. 
---
Did you got it fixed somehow? I just got rid of my invisible junk but have no idea how I could drop or scrap the invisible weapons &amp; armors I carry. If I could do that somehow it may would load correctly. Thing is they won't show up at the crafting station or world stashes. But if I pick up a bobby pin my bobby pins show up.     
---
Hm.. I might could try to farm even more treasure maps very slowly to get more stacked items which I could drop then. It would be hilarious if it works.
---
9900 caps for letters is fine? Ok.
---
Yeah
---
I mean they have been updating the game......
---
Maybe spawn the Responder Vendor more than once a decade.  That'd be nice.
---
I must be unlucky as I visit that one the most as it’s relatively near my areas of interest

My psn is biggestasset 
---
Camp, side quests, maybe hunt better gear (if you dont already have end game stuff) 
---
Not sure, the condition bar seemed to be exactly the same size as other foods. Maybe I'll do a test
---
That's what I was thinking too if all you are trying to do is see how high you can get your carry weight.
---
yes we can put dupers there
---
We just need more perk points. 
---
Agreed ride the lighting!!
---
I tend to agree. Its hard to know whats true or not anymore. Especially with over hundred hours in the game and maybe 6-7 disconnects since i joined in beta. Most of the bugs i have not personally experienced myself.
---
2 months after release servers should be more stable, or at least be to the point ahere someone shouldnt bluescreen 5 times in 20 min
---
Request sent.

I got it
---
No it has nothing to do with my topic because white Springs is not the only place to harvest yellow and crimson flux. Far from it.  Virtually any nuke zone has crimson and yellow flux. Violet is the hardest to find and there's way more of it in the cranberry bog, in edition to crimson and yellow flux.

I had a very high level Mr. Gutsy do the same thing to me! I heard him talking to me, but never saw him! That was one of the examples where I got mercilessly slaughtered and lost all my loot after being disconnected!
---
From what I understand, a lot of the server instability is from people duping and carrying thousands of unique weapons and tens of thousands of each resource. So they have to fix the supers. And I don't know enough about that to propose a fix. 
---
I have had that happen to me before. Your mutations with the team boost perk can make you walk on air. That's most likely what it was. I was melee smacking the queen like a super saiyan while she was hobering up high.

RIP, dude deleted his comment
---
I think theres a bit if randomness due to a glitchy loot system and lag. I've managed to loot legendarys from mobs Ive never touched and gotten nothing off things Ive soled.
---
Still, USSUALLY you need to tag things to get loot .
---
one is a 6th gen processor the other is a 4th gen processor, that might be whats tripping it up, just a thought.

Some ideas I've made up over time:
---
* Explore and find as many locations on the map as you can.
---
* Build a really nice CAMP and find plans to deck it out and make it your own.
---
* Participate in Events.
---
* Try owning Workshops, or helping others Defend theirs.
---
* Focus on making your Power Armor awesome.
---
* Seek out new players and share things with them.  Help them cross dangerous territory.
---
* Hear gunfire when you're wandering?  Go see if it's another player who might want your help.
---
* Travel with a caravan of other players.
---
I agree with you but it's better then it was at launch.
---
I would refuse to nuke the heap if it was a cricket. I would never in a million years fight that thing 
---
It's a mix of having Marsupial and bird bones mutations. And then all the players using/sharing strange in numbers perk. The perk is suppose to increase mutation benefits when in a team with other mutated players. When in a full team, it can bug a little bit and instead the benefits too much, allowing you to stay in the air. 
---
They really should make make a sort of tool where they can view and manage player's inventory if necessary. It should be a requirement for a online game like this.
---
Mile and cookies at the Flatwoods church!  Make you feel better.
---
I’m levelling a sniper character right now, and that sounds like the perfect test. Take them out at very long range. 
---
I’m a few hundred hours in myself. After a few tests killing the minions and seeing no results I gave up on the idea. I’ll try it again tomorrow and let you know what happens. 
---
There’s no way of proving or disproving either idea right now, it’s all anecdotal, and with the amount of bugs in the game, getting any kind of conclusive result is near impossible. 
---
Definitely agree with you but if one of the kind ps4 users can link that thread for him. Seems PS4 users have found a way to reduce the blue screen issue. Something about clearing out the storage or something.
