Yeah no shit and loading a head with 20 is quad of the original amount
---
---
---
It's a glitch that can occur when switching between weapons if one has a high capacity like the Gatling gun. On reload of the lower capacity gun it can get the higher capacity on occasion. 
---

---
Take it as a gift and go forth and kill many things üëç
---
Are you sure it's the game, and not your outdated computer?
---
I feel really bad because one time I *was* that chump who played this at the SBQ fight. I had just made it to that part of the quest line when Scorched Earth popped up. I figured great, I‚Äôll be in the neighborhood. Sorry, lol. I didn‚Äôt realize that everyone else randomly plays it at the SBQ fights haha.
---
Maybe the armorer perk card
---
I'll see
---
Oof that sucks. You'll still make it, itll just take a little longer
---
All good advice, thank you ReVo ü§ó
---
Yeah this one pisses me off.  The people that come in and turn the jukebox off especially
---
Hall-and-Granola covered it well.
---
I'm gonna start trying to be more observant doing events, makes me wonder if it's happened before and I just didn't notice. Sucks though man, upside is you got five more weeks to get ahead. Best of luck for ya.
---
 also allow secret service armor, gauss shotgun, etc to be traded between those who have learned the plans
---
Must have happened when I fought the SBQ then. The only heavy weapon I use is an ultracite gatling laser against her.
---
and eating her pot pies
---
Use half walls mate. Flamer on floor level only break lower half off wall and hide your trap better, and protect it too. You could put a half wall with a roof and have 2 rows of flamer, bottom half and top half if done right.
---
I'd hold off on healing factor, that with speed demon triggers a nasty fast travel bug.
---
That day is not today, since you have to kill 3 for SCORE.
---
THANK YOU I FINALLY GOT THROUGH üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ
---
Easy enough to test. Drink another grounded serum and the effect is suppressed for an hour.
---
OMG! I know One night I was the only one collecting ores!! THen people at the end were like "why such shity rewards?" Oh i don't know maybe because you didn't do the damn objective????
---
Well they announced we‚Äôd get the brotherhood quest story in winter, probably roughly wastelanders sized?
---
I have no clue what all those random letters mean.
---
The ironie :)
---
Oh yup thanks so much had no idea I had that p r rk equipped
---
It also stacks with the Wise Mothman event to light up the lighthouse, so if you're at the right time, you can add another 5% to the 5% from the stew, and the 5% from the lovers embrace when sleeping and up to 15% if you're on a team and using Inspirational, plus another 25% per lunchbox (up to 4 I believe).
---
I found this out from a guy who griefs people and posts on youtube. He sounds like an insufferable prick but gave some good pointers.
---
I haven't been able to do dross toss in 2 months
---
I really wish they would bring survival back, give you 2x drop rates or something as incentive and maybe not have your stuff drop? The early days hearing gun shots would make me duck in a room and peek around for people...I kinda miss it.
---
one in the basement of the hotel in the mountains in the savage divide, found my first chainsaw there during the beta.  
---
  
---
Some BETA Pics with the ol' chainsaw

---
It only applies to the bow and any other new weapons but I have personally seen a video of a TSE Gauss Shotgun dropping with bullets explode for area damage so it‚Äôs possible it can drop the same way that did perhaps.
---
Considering this is coming from PC it‚Äôs also very possible it‚Äôs spawned also.
---
Yeah, that one can be a PITA.
---
Oh for the bait? Well if someone wants to blow it up that badly. It's a automatic trap so I'm not usually there, handles itself- look up trapachino on this forum.
---
II CARE !
---
I'll need 3 pure cobalt Flux to craft it. Xbox?':)
---
There are 2 kinds of trap camps. Ones that are meant to be beaten or for the memes. And others that are meant to kill people maliciously and steal their junk (if they carry any)
---
I got my own little raider outpost up in the hills. There needs to be more raider-esque decor I've noticed.
---
Np =]
---
The cost reduction isn‚Äôt a debuff - it‚Äôs meant to reduce the cost of further shots in vats.
---
Also, it would stack with that perk, pushing it further beyond.
---
Dont keep more than 200 of anything, and pare down what you use even further.  I personally dont use a lot  of ballistic fiber as I run power armor, so I dont keep more than about 50 of it for helping out a friend. 
---
This paired with vigilance helps keep the stash under control.
---
ya ive been grinding gold and script. farmed aprox 20k gold and 13k script so far lol. Crafting secret service armor.
---
Agreed.
---
Sadly, no.  I wish.   Armor display mannequins would be nice, too
---
I actually tried to get that one but when I went there the basement door said inaccessible and no one there would talk to me.
---
I just farmed steel today for 3 hours. I joined "Line in the Sand" twice with an automatic tesla (someone had his survival tent up there) and then a few West-Tek runs. Got around 10k steel (and 5k plastic). As I don't have Fallout 1st I'm using Pack Rat perk and carry all of it with me. Now I need to be very careful as dying could mean that someone else is getting all my steel ;)
---
A lot of my junk is over 500 lol, used to fallout 4
---
I have two water purifiers at my camp, one locked and one unlocked. I sell anything that is left over and everyone is happy at the end of the day.
---
I always find that it‚Äôs my ‚Äòaid‚Äô tab taking up an inordinate amount of space.   Stuff adds up in the stash, where it‚Äôs not weighed with perks.
---
You‚Äôll have that.
---
I am unsure if it is "known" or a data mined rumor. But the number I have seen everyone throwing around is 250. So a donation of 250 of the required material would give an item akin to a Christmas gift or a mole miner pail with either the same or a slightly modified loot pool
---
People like you make the world a better place, homie
---
Yeah, I know the feeling.  The only way to get unlimited storage is first, and I'm tempted every time I have to clean again.  
---
Just know that you'll be devouring plastic to bulk and sell stuff unless you can find someone to pawn it off on.
---
While douche bags suck like those two a-holes, can I ask why people lock their camps?  I‚Äôve never understood.  Who cares if people use your water, collections, food, and ammo?  I visit my camp maybe three times a session.  Its never out of stuff.  It‚Äôs not like they can steal your guns and armor from your stash (anymore).
---
I wouldn't mind a Blood Eagles/cultists war. Pick your flavor of crazy, know that your friends will still shoot you because the voices told them to.
---
Also, shame on you. Throwing away perfectly good chungus, hmph!
---
Great work. I'll keep this in mind when alpha goes live
---
Anyone whining about autocompleted challenges doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about.
---
This is a TOTALLY different glitch and I know because it's happened to me twice including today.  I just logged completely out of the game and back in, it took a few tries but eventually when I logged back in I had all of the challenges that should have been there were back and then went and finished them all.
---
You ever get any reply from Bethesda? I was just looking at prizes and wondered what it was so googled it and came across both your post and the other post you have referenced
---
If your lucky they will teach you to become a blood thirsty cannibal like everyone at the White Glove Society in Fallout New Vegas
---
Wow, that's some take. Have you not seen all of the frame drops, crashing, and overall tough time the game has with loading things? When you fast travel to camps, you spawn facing away because all the assets haven't been loaded yet. Even if you turn around it'll all still be loading in. This 9 year old engine wasn't made to support multiplayer and is being held together by duct tape. Mounts would make you move faster, increasing the strain on the servers and on the client side. Mounts would be cool, but if they weren't in the game at launch, they won't be in two years later.
---
My Xbox One X is hardwired to an exceptional modem with top end internet. My buddy has a old normal Xbox One running on WiFi and cheap internet. He still loads in to a game 15-20 seconds faster than I do.
---
Have you tried any other games and do you have the same problem?
---
Thats why you gotta wear the ritualist mask. Much more Texas-chainsawy
---
What, and have some greedy level 700 bitch take it all and sell it for 10 caps each? No thanks.
---
I tend to use a lot of stuff when I play so I love to come back to my camp to have a lot of ammo and water waiting for me since I visit quite often. Other people may have different reasons but thats mine. My workbenches are public though, that's something I've always had.
---
They sat down there for the radio tech my dudes.
---
And then we can have people whining even more that they're being "forced" to log in every day?  And if you're going to say that would never happen just look at what the response to this season and score in general was.
---
Oh thats strange, should be able to talk to the lady at the desk
---
I have things for sale just no one shows up, and you can‚Äôt sell junk to npc. I hate seeing junk go to waste
---
And 2+ years to not fix it when it's horribly btoken
---
Affirmative.
---
The higher the total number of items the more likely what they're selling is garbage or over priced. Lower numbers is usually where I find the best deals.
---
Protip, join public teams and see if any of their camps are in them (or near) for free fast travel.
---
Same thing happened to me. It was the last main quest I had left. I tried it before and it was a total pain in the ass. Struggled for over two hours, then the server was going to be shutdown. 
---
After that I was determined to finish it. I stocked up on fusion cores. Tried to get a good Gatling Laser. A Laser Gun. Even got some melee weapon with energy damage on it and out of nowhere one day ‚ÄúI Am Become Death Completed‚Äù. 
---
I was disappointed. This quest was going to be my closure to main line questing.
---
Yeah I thought that too but I moved all my aid on me and it‚Äôs still high 700
---
You can bulk it at tinker benches (typically 10 scrap plus 2 plastic) and sell the bulk.  Also some of the rarer junk like ballistic fiber and ultracite can be sold as is.
---
Over the last week I've noticed a previous bug return (black screen) so it wouldn't surprise me this has returned as well. I'm in the middle of a new camp build right now so good thing my vendors aren't up and running. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Best Option:  Fallout First and the Infinite Scrap Box. 
---
Next best option (and the best free option): Proper Stash Management, using [this guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1sg7L4P7UT4mycr7JF-aXvf5gjFtsyAfUH3qjeiV03y8/htmlview) to help you pat down your junk hoard to a manageable state.
---
Sell the excess junk to vendors or in your own vending machine. If you can‚Äôt sell it to a vendor, it needs to be bulked first.
---
How bout gunpowder or ore?
---
I‚Äôve ran into it twice and both time he just stood there and did nothing.
---
Brain fungus soup also.
---
Wow, I had no idea you could sell bulk, thanks for saying this
---
Where do you guys learn this? Are there terminals that tell this story? Am I just big dumb and missed it?
---
Please read my other comments. I have specifically said I do not expect constant story content. Basic recoloured outfits as achievement rewards and outfit ports from 4 would be fine instead.
---
I have over 500 gunpowder
---
Plant them?! I thought they were for eating...
---
Only... I am level 21... I think I am doing it wrong, haha
---
Yeah, that‚Äôd be a good chunk of the weight.   I pretty much only have gunpowder as long as it takes me to use it up, it‚Äôs too heavy to just keep on-hand
---
Again dont tell people what to do in this game. Some play for themselfs and own fun. Yes there are people joining for the t.notes only and xp. So what? Its there own game! # go cry somewhere else.
---
On the other hand, while I'm busy grabbing ores, I'm getting little exp and usually miss all rhe legendary mobs. This pisses me off. Its lose/lose unless we cooperate.
---
It‚Äôs in the terminals and the lore.
---
I am also currently writing a novel on the Enclave in Appalachia.
---
They should make completing events give 100-200 score
---
This is the best answer.
---
Yes.
---
Exactly!! Just grab ore and finish in 2 mins like real life am I right? Smh. Damn rookies.
---
Me too if ya want some plans hit me up. I have plenty no charge
---
Sounds like you need more confetti in your life.
---
I didn‚Äôt realize how heavy it is, thanks
---
Huh. Yeah, those sound like jerks. The only time I ever unlock a bunch of doors at a camp is because I wanted to see what was behind them. I leave resources alone.
---
So you‚Äôre wanting a Legendary Perk that does more than an existing perk or legendary effect?
---
Yeah really. Just use the US military that was introduced in wastelanders. There‚Äôs no reason to break lore and use the BOS
---
Nope, I need big fixes and quality control.
---
I wish they had a way to sort inventory by TOTAL weight. Not just sorted by the individual weight of items.
---
I didn‚Äôt know they led you to loot, so thanks for this üëç I‚Äôll keep an eye out for it again üòä
---
Id actually have a reason to collect every power armor if they gave us the ability to display them. As of now i only keep my x-01 and t60
---
&gt; Given how much content they add on a regular basis (weekly even) to the  atom store there is almost an entire games worth of content there. Like  easily most of fallout 4 in terms of cosmetic and *gameplay* content (via camps stuff like collectrons). 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Here you are comparing easy cosmetics to an entire game.
---
Good on you mate! People trying to sell those usually get their camps nuked.
---
&gt; The best way to do the event is to collect ores
---
Roger that!
---
&gt; then turn them all in at 10 seconds left
---
"Turn them in"? To whom, where?
---
[removed]
---
I know, it‚Äôs so annoying
---
Had the same thing happen on my Instigating Double Barrel Shotgun. All I could say was ‚ÄúFUCK YEAH!‚Äù But also ‚ÄúBoooo! Bugs!‚Äù
---
Hard reset.
---
If that doesn't work reinstall.
---
Me too, keep getting ‚Äúauthentication failed‚Äù like 12 times. Tried turning it on and off again, no help
---
Yeah I wish, honestly I wish we would have had a new military faction instead of the BOS for the MQ.
---
Yeah, explosive bait would like to have a word with you about that. That can definitely wreck your camp.
---
If you're enjoying what you're doing it's not wrong lol if not then maybe it is.
---
And maybe possibly a squirrel scout if they ever add it in... SQUIRREL SCOUTS!
---
This. I run a solo full health/melee. A Vampire's super sledge means I rarely need to use a stimpak, even if I'm booping the Queen on the snout.
---
For armor, I honestly just wear anything with a +1 strength, and try to find stuff with reduction of weight for items carried, as melee weapons have some heft. I do try to maintain at least one unyielding piece at all times, that coupled with the Nerd Rage perk card can help you out in a pinch. Serendipity, Bloody Mess, heck, even Glow Sight will all help as well.
---
In terms of guns, as I'd rather not switch perk cards every five minutes, I carry a magic shotgun, and an AA explosive Handmade.
---
Hopefully that helps. Some things (yao guais/ghouls) take 2-3 pokes before I can kill them. But hey, it would be boring to one shot everything. I'm down to answer any questions as well.
---
I still keep a set of each, even though I pretty much only use the excavator
---
There's a yellow thing that is marked in the back end of the middle room, hard to miss
---
After restarting my PS4 207 times, it eventually worked. Just had to wait a long time
---
Yea seriously. Hopefully it‚Äôs something more than just a few world challenges also
---
It's just odd to me that it doesn't give a bounty. A cowards' weapon.
---
Then why complain?
---
sure!
---
Your post really helped me out because i really wanted to collect resources but didnt know where to start &lt;3 so thanks
---
Does this apply to JUST 1 stars or any version of that legendary? Because I‚Äôve got a 2* Ripper I assumed was legacy but it really seems like a lot of people argue whether they are or not
---
It is about the amount of effort given and the expectation of Bethesda that the customers should take it.
---
You know what would be an acceptable alternative to the constant recolous and reskins being added to the atom store? Achievement unlockable cosmetics. You currently get nothing in most areas. You should unlock cosmetics for completing major quest chains, major achievement collections, and other challenges.
---
Also the argument you specifically highlighted is talking about cosmetics hence "They've had the art team developing these constant products instead of adding them to the game leaving us without the same level of cosmetic variety as in the previous game".
---
Yeah.
---
This is why people turn into bush wookies.  For a long time I played the mode as it was meant to be played. I played it as an actual PVP mode were I tried to fight other players.   But I am now level 95 and the realization of the inherent unfairness  (due to delayed spawning) makes me not want to bother with the mode anymore.   I still want my hellfire power armor, so lately I have just been hiding at the bottom of Grafton lake with aqua boy turned on.   I don't like to play this way, I really don't, but when I try to play it as an actual PVP  mode, I keep getting wrecked by players who spawned in before me and looted orange crates.
---
It really feels pointless trying to play it as intended.
---
Sweet, send me an invite! Thank you!
---
Was wondering about this, had this happen too, didn't realize it another widespread event. Way to go, Todd. It just works, huh?
---
will join you soon
---
I just started using Carnivore, so I will switch back to Canned Meat Stew. With all of the public team bonuses, it‚Äôs quite easy to gain 100% or more CP3 boost.
---
&gt; You know what would be an acceptable alternative to the constant  recolous and reskins being added to the atom store? Achievement  unlockable cosmetics. You currently get nothing in most areas. You  should unlock cosmetics for completing major quest chains, major  achievement collections, and other challenges. 
---
 So like that Legendary Challenge event were you get all sorts of unlockables for doing the event.
---
Bulk aluminum and lead to save weight for sure.  Don't keep more than 200 of anything unless you know you use a lot of it (like plastic for shot gun ammo).  Wood and steel are always easy to get - don't hoard that.
---
So I have a question about cork, where do you look for the golf balls, are they out on the greens? I just looked through the clubhouse and only found maybe 5 gold balls. Also I set up 4 workshops for concrete and junk that you recommended and it‚Äôs working beautifully, thanks for the excellent tip
---
give me 10 minutes
---
That would be so damn cool if they did
---
If events gave score the same way they gave scrip, you could possibly solve this issue. Too many people are trying to drag it out, and just grind XP killing mobs. The solution seems simple, but I'd expect Bethesda could find a way to bugger it sideways. Assuming they'd even bother with it at all.
---
The entire drawback IS missing out on EXP. People who want to complete the quest for the rewards would get the ores and the ones in it for the EXP will stand guard with the scavengers, simple as that. 
---
I've been both (thankfully I've already gotten the rad barrel) and I'd rather farm EXP than get the event rewards.
---
If he's not already full on Cheetos and 7-Up.....
---
For this year? No.
---
I'm a hoarder and I've have FO1st for nearly a year now. I have more resources than I could possibly use. I mean I use so much lead and steel for ammo and yet I have 100k and 200k respectively. Can you imagine how much I have of the resources I dont use lol. I imagine (or at least hope) that I'm not the only crazy person who does this.
---
They delayed wastelanders, and then started barely updating anything else. While they were still "on track", the updates were coming as usual. If the BoS story is too much for them to handle fixing the game even a few months before its planned launch, it just shows how few resources they have
---
Don't forget what our lord says(Todd Howard): It just works.
---
You're playing a multiplayer game..what do you expect?
---
Yeah I just wish they let you use purified water to make soup
---
And cranberry relish.
---
On Playstation 4 there was a guy I could toss a couple of caps to, and he would locate the griefers and harass and kill them until they left the server lol.
---
Joining an event and not helping complete, only being there for your own exp isn't considered a shitty thing to do? It still sounds selfish to me, it's like showing up at a rally just to start a riot and think you're helping people out. And if you're normally playing on a private server, why even join a public to not finish events that you could just do in private? The system doesn't work out if people are just dragging events down by not helping though.  Your whole reasoning seems backwards to me.
---
Not sure if that would fix anything - in reality, it seems like that would just lead people to sit at 21% instead of 19% and run something like born survivor on top of everything else
---
From what I've seen it's as buggy as the Nuka cola lamps!
---
I'm on PC, but thanks. Besides this mask, there's the Eye of Ra that seems to have disappeared from my inventory too.
---
No it doesn't.
---
Blame Bethesda for the shitty event, then. The event was supposed to encourage team play but there is no incentive to collect ore OVER getting EXP while guarding the scavengers. That's just shitty design and players will play what they want to play.
---
It's not just about the Legendary Run, it's the event itself.
---
There are 40 ore nodes in the caves. The rare plans drop at 75,so as you can see one person cannot collect enough ore for the rare drops, which tends to be the case. The point of the event is to collect ores while defending the scavengers, so basically most players are not playing the event correctly. This shines more negatively on Bethesda than it does the playerbase, as the scavengers should collect ores, like EVERY OTHER EVENT IN THE GODDAMN GAME. But that doesn't matter as Bethesda doesn't care at all, so the event will never change. My reason to complain is that it requires teamwork from everyone at the event to get the most out of it, but I guess noone cares because there are too many comments about ignoring the objective to get xp from kills. It's basically like playing domination as tdm in cod
---
You mean the legendary challenge full of broken cosmetics and things no one wants? The one that is almost impossible to grind for unless you play constantly and dedicate a good portion of your life to it?
---
That is a much worse option in comparison to simply adding earnable achievement based cosmetics *that are literally ports from the old game on the same engine, most of which are in game or are sold on the atom store or for IRL money, such as Pipers outfit*.
---
We never really left, did we?
---
How optimistic of you!
---
No, just for the daily challenge of buy/sell three items from a player.
---
only 1 stars can still drop. 2 star weapons are currently legacy.
---
Or just have the scavengers collect ore from a pump and have collected ores contribute to completing the event quicker, similar to the jukebox in silent night
---
Daily SCORE challenge of buying three items from another player.
---
I don‚Äôt care bro RR is just an exp farm.. of a group of ppl hunting that rare plan then they should collect it as a team
---
And Bethesda just doesn't care, they refuse to offer any assistance to affected players, and support just auto locks any and all tickets that even mention score!
---
He was claiming his 250 points for the Legendary board.
---
Cool, I‚Äôm glad. You‚Äôll probably want to post this on the market sub too
---
Over 1000 ammo will travel.
---
You don't get anything for them at all.
---
I expected it to act as a light... its essentially a roof decoration that you need light to see
---
Wow. You should work on your social skills.
---
I haven't played that much, to be fair. Just played back when it was for free and then played a little bit more when it was added to Xbox Game Pass so, I haven't done much yet...
---
I posted once it was a little overwhelming with how much you have to do so I decided to just complete the quests and see what happens... But haven't had chance to play that much...
---
Yea it‚Äôs such BS
---
I had this issue for the longest time(With and without power armor) and found it was tied to my framerate being too high, so I¬†used Nvidia control panel (Could use Afterburner as well) to lock my frames at 60 and haven't had the problem since.¬†¬†
---
sounds like it‚Äôs time to find a new camp spot
---
I support both of these ideas. 
---
I would also like a mail system to send gifts to other players similar to Borderlands, it shouldn't be that hard. Make gifting easy.
---
It's a pipe dream but I would kill for a Borderlands challenge reward system of partially randomized legendaries mailed to you in a manner that does not waste your inventory space until you decide to accept it.
---
Dang ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Its absurd that I have played the fuck out of this game...havent touched it in 3 months because i was bored doing the same shit thousands of times over. 
---
Come back to the sub to see absolutely nothing has changed.
---
Thats awesome! I figured the dragon just couldnt be a legendary anymore, i will definitely have to look into this smart machine
---
Sounds good
---
Especially with the underarmor being a meager 500 gold, seems silly to cost 1650 for nothing
---
Most would recommend unyielding for bloodied.  Given that the caster is such a slow firing weapon as far as heavies go, and has actual projectile travel speed, being able to vats wouldn't hurt so the perceptions and agility boost from unyielding would definitely help.
---
Not to mention more strength for carry weight as energy ammo even with batteries included I heavier than ballistic ammo.
---
Bethesda don't care, they just lock the tickets or auto lock the ticket.
---
Alright. Unyielding it is. Glad I have so much scrip stockpiled.
---
F
---
Wait we‚Äôre not? If they‚Äôre delaying them again they better get rid of the coin system. It‚Äôs so counterintuitive‚Äîyou‚Äôre shoehorned in your build and can‚Äôt change stuff since you scrapped all your cards.
---
I always wait till I see that theres enough people to protect them, ones that is done I just go from section to section repeatedly
---
Plot armour didn't helped BoS.
---
Oh not they are back again
---
I would add Morgantown and summersville to my list. Morgantown HS has a significant amount of junk and easily dispatched scorched, and Summersville has the house with the few hundred books since we will need the cloth. 
---
Theres also a decent amount of wood in Helvetia.
---
Nothing in this game surprises me anymore. Buggy shit is buggy shit.
---
Good luck.  I hear unyielding is rough to get a full set of for some.  
---
I dont run bloodied myself so of course the only things I get are bloody weapons and unyielding armor.
---
OK. Try this. Make sure you have the junk on you that is needed to craft it. I've had this problem before. It wouldn't take from the stash box. I had to manually have the supplies on me.
---
As you see from your first experience with a higher lvl player, myself inclined. We enjoy going around and helping new players get settled in. It will happen a lot, so hang in there killer.
---
You might want to think about reconstructing your base to make it more secure. You can usually avoid being targeted if you make your base look secure enough. 
---
Having an airlock with two or more locked doors before getting inside would be a good place to start, but won‚Äôt protect you from players who like to glitch inside. You can setup level 2 or higher turrets inside to help protect you and will make it very difficult for them to get out with your loot. I usually end up with both of our loot at the end. 
---
Learn the garage door plan and put what you consider most valuable behind it. It needs power for it to be open so you could disconnect it before they get inside.. or setup a button and wait to trap them.
---
I have two right arms )-: and a left leg. I‚Äôm ahead of the game! (Lol leather leg, some scout armor)
---
See if the following works.  
---
Settings -&gt; Volume &amp; Audio Output -&gt; Chat Mixer - Uncheck 'Mute all other sounds'.
---
Sounds like bethesda needs to fix their crappy camp system.
---
We figured out the problem. Its a series of bug and design flaws involving foundation invisi stairs and that stupid system flaw/bug of "part of structure will be inaccessible.:
---
I will have to move my base but not because of the location
---
I may be mistaken, but I thought pacifist mode only made it so YOU didn't actually trigger a PVP, not that you wouldn't take damage from another player?
---
What are the donations for?
---
Not silly at all. I was delighted to learn about this lol
---
Totally agree! Hope they add more of these! This was so good
---
I just read all of this and I can't believe you two reunited üòÇüòÇ
---
Keep the gold
---
Because if you're there for xp you're killing hoards and protecting the 4 crew members and are in fact helping. It takes one person to get about 50 ore (I've done this with just two people many times) so if just one person does that and 5 people are on "hoard duty" it's not selfish. Protecting the crew is part of the event.
---
Selfish would be sitting somewhere afk playing in the corner and reaping rewards for doing nothing. Anyone from a level 1 to 1000 can grab a hazmat suit and grab ore. It's brainlessly easy. But not everyone can keep the high level glowing hoards back. 
---
The people who are saying it's selfish are the ones who generally want to also grab some XP and don't want to run ore. If ore is so damn important go grab it! As much as one can say "just go to a private server if you're not going to help" one can equally say "form a community create an op build and go grab ore on a private server by yourself." it's a bad argument.
---
If everyone goes to an event and does what's important to them there are no losers.
---
None of the cosmetics I've been using are broken.  The grind is a grind is a grind.  You can complete the dailies in a couple of hours if you rush it.
---
The new BoS content at atlas observatory, comes out Tues with patch 21
---
Because this is an online game in real time, and no matter how much you try to deny it, that makes it competitive by nature. Right now, if you aren't playing bloodied unyielding, you are dealing a bit less than 1/2 of the damage you could be doing. You are gaining 75% of the exp you could be getting. You are dying faster than you could be. Your VATS shots and criticals are less accurate and slower than they could be. 
---
Your entire game progression is slowed down, more difficult, and requires more resources. You are not getting the same out of an hour of play time as somebody else doing the same thing as you with the "better" build. If you want to play public events, you are at a disadvantage. If you play a limited time event (multiple of which are coming up soon!), you are getting less out of it than others. 
---
This isn't something like a balanced class system, this is just one obvious optimal choice and a bunch of inferior choices. You can play it like you want, but wouldn't you like to be able to play the kind of build you want while also not being a 2nd class player?
---
Bundling Junk can be useful if you don't have FO1st. Because the bundled weight makes it weight less then the unbundled versions. Just save enough excess materials for anything you made need immediately. Only disadvantage is you use plastic but that can be found at the Watoga High School or Wally Water Park easily. :)
---
Actually recorded myself hanging out with a npc cultist at luck hole mine and stood in front of the fire pits and spent time together and he never hurt me but when I went inside he tagged along with me while the others tried to kill me. But it was fun just relaxing with one by the fire. Wish they would make them an official faction already though. I built a First Church of Mothman in Point Pleasant and have my companion in his cultist outfit. I always have roleplayed as a cultist and would love to finally be a part of them so I no longer have to fight them. They could at least make it so they dont attack us if were in full cultist gear if the wont make them a faction.Feel free to ever stop on by if your in my server or add me if you wish to see my church. May Mothman bless all of you brothers and sisters!
---
It's really hard to collect ores as a bloodied build.
---
You got healing factor on?
---
It sure does. Unintentionally atleast. 
---
Drop stuff in a suitcase. Leave private world. Switch characters. Join private world again, it'll connect you to the same world. 
---
Pick stuff up. Success. 
---
It's a pretty well known thing with 1st.
---
Q = Quad
---
FFR = Faster Fire Rate
---
FR = Faster Reload
---
So he is using the second most bastardiest weapon for PvP in the game. A quad ammo, 25% faster fire rate, 15% faster reload Tesla rifle. I just hope he doesn‚Äôt combine that with a stealth boy.
---
...or he wanted 250 score lmfao
---
Yes but it doesn't really do much.
---
The fixing of a bug does mean a nerf for a build, just not a nerf in the conventional way. Back in BC2 you could abuse a bug to increase the fire rate of shotguns, it was widespread used to make them actually viable because otherwise they were dogshit. If DICE ever patched the bug out people would have considered that a straight nerf to shotguns.
---
Same here brother :-/
---
There are a LOT of reports of the broken cosmetics and low general quality of them. Noticeably the terrible quality of the ghillie suit textures. A couple of hours is not something that is accesible to a lot of people and even then employing FOMO (fear of missing out) is incredibly bad for the player in comparison to achievement based rewards that both incentivise gameplay whilst offering a non-time-locked reward for the players.
---
That sucks on both accounts.
---
if you really like the spot just replace your camp down, you‚Äôll get blue prints
---
It's the daily, I like the daily as it encourages shopping but it's starting to get tedious traveling to a camp and hoping they sell ammo or the 'plans' they have just happen to include something you don't own
---
Yes but private servers can loose their anchor to you, even if a friend is still in it! When that error occurs you cannot enter your private world at all! Additionally if you have any Internet troubles after dropping the item you are also going to loose it.
---
It's just not safe to do unless you have a friend pick up the items!
---
Just don't question it. Even when servers are falling apart and the game is in an unplayable state, the front page here will still have people asking for new emotes to buy in the atom shop pretty pretty please
---
Freeing up some rads and putting on a radiation suit works perfectly fine as a bloodied build myself
---
Outside hopefully, as inside nobody will see it as It is instanced to you!
---
Press F to Pay Respects. *game breaks*
---
So should you.
---
Anytime some says, "I don't mean to sound like an asshole", they're gonna sound like an asshole.
---
I'll give it a shot, thanks for the tip!
---
Thank you for the information. Regards
---
I'll try that but I'm worried I'll still get shwacked by ghouls
---
i did
---
I‚Äôm basically aiming for something like ammo factory, that stacks with the original and improved upon it.
---
I haven't came across them yet after 330+ hours
---
They usally ignore you and right towards the scanvegrs or turrets of they're repaired
---
Don't forget the cultist blades! Not only can those also drop from the event, but you can get the unique bloodied one (called the Nailer) from one violent night
---
Is this a FO1st event, or something that I just haven't seen yet?
---
Only complaint is, duper‚Äôs can easily share items between accounts
---
I actually disagree. I remember playing Fallout 3 and 4 and it seemed every few steps a new creature spawned that I had to deal with. I like that animals often rarely spawn away from actual locations. I can often run from point A to point B in peace.
---
Oh, ok I'll try that then. 
---
What are the rewards in that event?
---
pc?
---
You can hang it from the raider tree you unlock! I've been thinking of doing a camp build in the mire with a bunch of the raider trees with the firefly jars on them surrounding the main house
---
There are 9. 
---
There have never been 12
---
Seems like you got the auto complete bug
---
I think this should apply to Gold plans, now before somebody says 'too easy', honestly who cares? hardly anyone is making a second character to PvP, and the gold grind is painful enough to do the first time why do it a second?
---
3k plastic sounds like a mighty fine amount of plastic to have. Thank you for sharing this
---
More like a simulation. This could be our Tranquility Lane. Stuck in an endless loop of killing the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
The rad barrel and the unique hazmat suit drop at rewards level 3 and 4
---
Helps you find the tourist and a few other things. There is no reason not to get it
---
I think that *may* have been me haha, I saw a thread about higher levels helping lower levels with free plans or gifts and I went near the overseer area to scout.
---
 Then saw someone crafting and tried to give some free plans, stimpacks and more. Tried to get their attention with the present emote but failed. Looked at me and then turned to keep crafting. üòÖ
---
The golf balls took me a minute to find too. 
---
At whitesprings There are 13 I think spread around the club house. 5 in entrance, 4 on the lower bookcase against the interior wall on the room to your right when entering (wall opposite pool tables in a basket). Downstairs there are 4 on the end table against the wall by the stairs, a couple others in the display in the hallway with the Skelton in the wheel chair. There are more at the driving range, some in a basket in the office down there, some along the tees and some in each of the two closer clearings, none in the further clearings. Then there are a bunch spread about in the small putting green right next to the main resort building. 
---
At Bolton greens there are several in 3 baskets on top of a table outside and another one on the counter of the cashier station nearby.
---
Hemlock Holes they are on the shelves in the gift shop, main shelves, shelves behind the counter and the display shelf to the side of the cashiers counter.
---
There are also 4 by the golf bag in the monorail elevator. There are 3 baseballs at the prison by wall near the weights and there are always globes at the Black Bear Lodge.
---
Sometimes low levels just punch people to get their attention.
---
Other times they're actual kids that find it funny.
---
Kept trying to get a pic with him but he wouldnt stop moving RIP
---
Well still, they obviously know how to use and maintain it so why not dissassemble it and move it to Wavy Willards?
---
I tried that but it says "item is floating"  ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Yea, I was resding some old posts that claimed they had found them, but I am really starting to doubt it.
---
Lol I saw a video of that exploit.  Seems like a lot of work for not much reward.
---
Check misc tab for ores and gunpowder. What I do is use Super Duper Perk  and craft all ores into scrap then deposit in the F1st scrap box which is unlimited. Now I know most people don't have 1st and I usually don't as well, I get it every few months to load up the scrap box. But even when I don't have the scrap box, converting ores to scrap lessens the weight for me. Also, once you convert to scrap you can bulk them.
---
You'll need acid to do the conversion.
---
Gunpowder can be crafted to ammo with Ammosmith and Super Duper.
---
Just out of curiosity- you saw the thing down there, right? In the secret passageway? I don‚Äôt want to spoil the surprise if you missed it, it‚Äôs very cool.
---
It‚Äôs funny. They said they didn‚Äôt have any plans for that at the moment, yet I‚Äôd say plenty of people were looking forward to it with wastelanders. I‚Äôm curious as to why this wasn‚Äôt on the plate before the brotherhood.
---
Lol I knew it didn't have really any purpose and yet.... damn it I had to get it. The completionist in my pip boy told me to.
---
OH 4 more golf balls at white springs in the small office on the walkway up from the driving range, they are on the floor by the golf bags.
---
Edit: Autocorrect changed golf to gold, had to fix it.
---
Yep.
---
Another glitched one? lol I'm kinda scared of trying things sometimes. I'm glad I read about the camp skin on time üòÖ
---
What I have been doing is I buy 1 each of a certain ammo type twice, then on the 3rd purchase, I'll buy all thats left or a couple hundred.
---
How do u add links with a sentence like you did there?? I‚Äôm on mobile btw
---
When I re-logged in after I did the 5 only two showed lol glad I at least did those!
---
Once the bug happened to me again and re-logged, all of them were auto completed. Including the ones that showed up...so usually not best to relog in at all everyone just do what shows up before logging off!!!!
---
Ooooooh ok. I'll have to do some ore collection
---
Thanks for this cuz I lost about 1200 pounds of junk to a server crash
---
This is an automated reply to any report. you can attach media to your ticket in the support section and give a description of what happened exactly...
---
The planetarium is just glitched in the way that it doesn't display the markings or light up, which is the same problem with the three nuka cola lamps!
---
Nothing game breaking like the camp skin, just 70% of the time it just doesn't work.
---
Yes, play the game at all and it auto completes lmao!
---
Does the excavator PA effect works for those ores?
---
I'll just make a list of things I'd recommend doing to reduce weight
---
1. Weight reduction perks are nice, mainly traveling pharmacy, thru-hiker, and pack rat(if you want to carry your junk around).
---
2. Scrap everything. Your junk, and weapons or armor you aren't using. If it's not legendary, you can probably pretty easily get another copy.
---
3. Bulk your aluminum and lead. They're the only materials that reduce weight when bulking.
---
4. Don't keep gunpowder as there's no way to reduce the weight. If needed, keep a minimal amount or keep acid with some cloth(as it should be pretty easy to get).
---
5. If you use a lot of ballistic ammo, bandolier is nice. As for making it, I keep it as lead ore since the lead ore and acid required to smelt weigh the same as bulked lead(without weight reduction).
---
6. You can always have things to increase weight such as unyielding armor, ribeye steaks(flatwoods typically has 4 brahmin roaming around), bufftats, or alcohol. Steaks are an easy +20 carry weight, bufftats are +3 str, and whiskey is +3 str(a level 2 party girl/boy makes it a nice +30 carry weight). Rad ant lager is a bit harder to get but it's a +50 carry weight(does not stack with other alcohol of course, also has a -50 carry weight for a minute after the buff wears off).
---
7. Have you already gotten your backpack and then made a level 50 one? That should be +60 carry weight. Then there's always the option of making all your armor "deep pocketed".
---
8. Another option to compress but is a bit costly material wise would be to change any armor you're not using into "ultra-light". 
---
9. Any legendary weapons you're not using, strip it down to its standard parts.
---
10. Keep certain common material counts low. For example, I can farm steel pretty easily at Blackwater Mine or West Tek so I usually only keep around 100 at most. I about never use ceramics, concrete, or glass so I rarely even both picking them up. I don't use leather, rubber, or copper much so I bulk them and sell it off to a vendor. 
---
11. Only or mainly putting stuff in your stash that you don't have weight reductions for. 
---
12. If you don't have ordinance express, you're probably not using explosives much so get rid of mines, grenades, missiles, and mini-nukes. 
---
Kinda all I can think of off the top of my head but hope this helps.
---
Yeah, just hit level 70 today. It‚Äôs gonna be Season 1 and done for me, I think. I‚Äôm only going to finish out because ... I dunno, for science? To prove to myself I am not a quitter? To witness more of the broken cosmetics? I‚Äôm not even sure anymore. But I am happy to finally be in Chapter 3 and close to the home stretch.
---
This worked. I just checked him (9pm EST) and he had bullion for me. Sucks but I guess I'll try to get him during this window from now on.
---
Ahuh
---
Absolutely BUILT for BBC
---
You can be over lv 3000 and still not have enough perk coins to max out!
---
hm, i cant move through the shrubs here... lets give it a whack with the hammer.... 
---
\*SPLAT\*
---
.... ahm.... GUYS!? 
---
can bushes BLEED? asking for a friend....
---
Oh I understand now. I started playing recently so i didn't know about nuka cola lamps, i google it lol. Those were in the atom shop?
---
Just always carry a nukashine with you and take a trip out of there, no need to be an ass even though they are being one lol. Or of course fast travel if you're not over encumbered.
---
I am literally the only one who ever does this whenever I attend this event. Grinds my gears, man.
---
flamer i guess?
---
It would‚Äôve been 10x better if it was the real country roads
---
Yep
---
Havent came across those. If your looking for kitchen themed things, I know an unscorched oven mit exists.
---
One was in the atom shop, the other two were twitch rewards.
---
Helvetia and Flatwoods are two of my favorite reset towns. Both have more than enough junk to reset your spawn counters.
---
I have that one, thank you though :).
---
Use tasty squirrel stew instead of canned meat, with carnivore and strange in numbers it gives you 25% bonus xp
---
Nope.
---
If it starts getting them atoms, then it‚Äôll be addressed. The priorities have been made clear for some time now, and if anyone still hasn‚Äôt accepted that... well, that‚Äôs unfortunate. It is what it is. Take it entirely without any oversight (or even basic play testing) or get out while you‚Äôre still ahead.
---
I do agree that I should and I want to  but for some reason it seems to be really bad through voice chat and around strangers, I'm fine typing to people.
---
I was excited to get this when I got to tier 100 but after placing it down in my camp I was definitely disappointed :( I should have figured
---
Also, if you don't see a lot of people collecting ore, don't wait for the last ten seconds. Put some in just to let the people not paying attention see that, yes, we are trying here, this isn't just a XP free for all. It'll hopefully put some pressure on people to go collect some too.
---
I as well am tired of being the only ore collector.
---
Yeah that other guys right, why are you on the Reddit then?
---
And I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôd quit because of the score system... it‚Äôs literally a minor part of the game you can ignore if you want
---
I dunno. He was doing it rapid fire and he was getting all kinds of things that can spawn in safes and speed scrapping all the weapons. He didn't seem to care I was right in front of him.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Was wondering where I got that thing. Think I scripted it the other day rip.
---
Someone already posted this exact same thing
---
That would be kind of funny to watch....
---
It doesn't help that most of the vets playing the event completely ignore the objectives. Essentially teaching anyone new to the event the perfect strategy for failing the event.
---
Yeah i run straight for the bass if someone else is there
---
Just wanted his 250 points, he probably dropped the flares in the bush so he wouldn't hurt your feelings.
---
We desperately need some new events.
---
Bethesda really need to do something to refund us the missing score, or give us atoms to buy the missing score!
---
Every day that this daily challenge has been on, I‚Äôve done something similar.  I‚Äôll certainly buy other stuff from the vending if I like it, but I want to get the score settled.  I also sell quite a lot of things through player vending myself.
---
Some are still grinding and barely have a single usable piece, and I got a full unyielding set (1* chest though) in not even 30 total pieces. 
---
Hope your Luck is maxed, you‚Äôll need more than the Courier.
---
It kinda was. It was like a paper flip-book. The trap destroyed itself and the safe and he repaired it instantly.
---
Yeah most people stopped doing it when it was giving dog food, not realizing the reward changed to something drastically better.
---
Dude sounds like a nut job, I doubt they‚Äôd put any of that crap into the game
---
(Not op, the cryptid dude or whoever)
---
Yeah I did. It‚Äôs also in the other location so I‚Äôm curious how it connects
---
Oh yes, I always forget it because I hardly ever use it since it is a food that expires. (I don't like having to maintain cooked foods, other than to inflate the price before selling to a vendor.) But yes, that would be better than the stew. And, as someone mentioned how the Strange in Numbers perk boosts the exp gain by 25% as well when using Carnivore mutation and eating stew and getting 12% exp, so I imagine it also applies with Herbivore and the relish for 25%!
---
If you eat, perk, and event things juuuust right, you can get:
---
100% 4x lunchboxes
---
25% cranberry relish
---
15% inspiration (lvl 3)
---
5% Wise Mothman (PRAISE BE!)
---
5% sleep bonus
---
Total: 100% base+150% bonus=250% total experience
---
2x days would sit you at 500% normal than if you were to use no boosts or bonuses.
---
[deleted]
---
A re-spec would be better, for those who want it.   
---
Sometimes I WANT to start from scratch (personal preference). Yeah, it's a feckin' huge grind, but removing one of the main progress trees takes away a lot of the reason for playing.   
---
Since player vendors were added it's easier to work towards what plans you need for cheap(ish). They took most of the RNG out of faction vendors stock, too.   
---
AFAIK Legendary Perk slots are going to be a kind of NG+ thing. Account wide. Maybe they could add respec for perk coins as an option?   
---
A drop-box to share items between characters (with a cost for withdrawing them, based on weight or in-game item value, or both, make it not so OP right at the start) would be a nice addition.
---
Yes, cheap to craft. Absolutely worst yields per materials though. Even with Ammosmith and Super Duper.
---
There's 4 rewards tiers. At 25,50, 75 and 100 ore. You get a chance for rare rewards at lvl 3 while level 4 doubles that chance as far as I know.  Every tier also increases the difficulty/amount of enemies which is why people usually turn the ore in with like 15 seconds left. There's a plan for a Radioactive Barrel and the HazMat suit they are wearing as a rare reward. But nowadays people are more interested in xp so they just farm mobs and fail the event.
---
I can wait. Considering this is my first time completing the Wastelanders I'm still learning.
---
Ignore him. He's a dick
---
You didn't reply to their comment.
---
Pc
---
Thanks for the quick replies was thinking about taking the mutation and the information helps
---
I built a little 2 foundation structure with a locked door, and an interior keypad door with a pressure plate powered door to exit for my ammo mill. I figure if someone wants to pick the lock to get into it, and then stand there and try to guess the keypad sequence then, pick the lock on the ammo mill, they must really need those 200 10mm bullets that are being produced.
---
That'd be a bit much. I only play 6 hours a week and I'm rank 60 already. But a 50 score would be perfect.
---
If you look at the legendary map, there are two ships, one is yours, you need to be near the second ship. There is also a time at the bottom of the map when he will move again
---
Ohh, i didn't know what twitch was lol. I'm such a noob ü§£ i hope the one on the atom shop comes back, even if it doesn't work, for some reason I'm a fan of nuka cola objects, i hope they make a bundle or something again, thank you for the info! Glad to learn new things
---
I‚Äôd really like to see a server for the HIGH ROLLERS out there with say 150k cap limit. minimum level 50 or higher to access it. Maybe a place with a lil more Anarchy and tougher enemies and more legendarys
---
Most theories I‚Äôve heard is the one in The Deep is a baby version of the one in Lucky Hole Mine. Hopefully it isn‚Äôt just a throwaway prop, and we actually get to see more of them throughout the world.
---
It's fine for just sating hunger/thirst, but if you're after buffs from food then meat tends to win out with higher stat increases (especially with Carnivore).
---
Or replace the xp for score to complete events for score that way the whole issue of people letting events fail would be negated cause you don‚Äôt get shit if you don‚Äôt actually complete the event
---
Thanks!
---
Broken from specific angles maybe not not broken in general use.   
---
A couple of hours is all it takes and it is the trade off you get. More items for more work or less items for less work.  Particularly when you can easily shortcut some of the longer grindy things like  leveling up by creating a new character and getting to get quick level ups and then delete it once you hit level 5.
---
I already have 50k steel and I'm sure people has a LOT more than me.
---
if your looking for help then don‚Äôt hesitate to ask
---
Rogue.Aus (128?) or something
---
Oh, sorry im on ps4. Good luck. If you make more caps you can just buy those from BoS vendors
---
Dupers should be Bethesda's problem, not the average player's problem. Also, the 5 characters are still on the same account.
---
No. People should not consider a bug as part of a build. What kind of people am I dealing with here?
---
It can be tricky sometimes. Some places where the scenery and object blend together. A lot of browns and greys, especially when it rains.
---
Sometimes I have to play with the lights off in the room to see what I'm doing. But a challenge is a challenge I guess.
---
You won't see it if you have the filter set to what you can build and don't have the materials to make it. Make sure you have the filter set to show everything and you'll see it and the costs associated with building it.
---
[I've found him talking to Davenport before, who I believe is telling him where to find stashes of goodies.](https://i.redd.it/mpzv14e4b7351.png)
---
I wave my private parts at your aunties.
---
I have on display the "house" tea kettle and a red one, both look pretty decent to me, there's also a white one that looks nice too but very... "Ordinary" üòÖ
---
Some time the crates load in slow. I have a favorite spot to start from, where maybe 1 in 5 times I have to wait like 5/10 seconds for the crate to spawn contents before I can loot it.
---
I‚Äôve played without sound the last two weeks, I play my own music....I regret nothing.
---
When I stack all the consumables and have the right weekend then the xp is awesome!  Outside of that its shit like I said.
---
&gt;Who cares if people use your water, collections, food, and ammo?
---
People who need these things and produce them at their camps.
---
In bed, in the trailer, or by the instruments.
---
Glitter Bomb
---
Or you could go to glassed cavern, have no event to contend with, and can do this indefinitely.  Every person can spawn 6 scorched every 30 seconds.  And if you do it at the end of the cavern you can get the scorchbeast respawning every 30 seconds.  This requires no special consumables, no special week, no quest, no event, nothing but killing mobs.
---
4% exp for every point in INT up to 25?
---
There's atom challenges where you can legitimately repair/craft stuff repetitiously to get atoms. It's definitely not against the rules.
---
This is a you problem. Don't blame Bethesda because YOU decided the XP was more important. Getting the repeatable XP isn't even required to finish the Legendary Run. You could go do Guided Meditation, Lode Baring, or any other event with large spawns.
---
If more of y'all would take responsibility for your actions instead of blaming Bethesda for everything then these events would go smoother.
---
Yea I am taking about the White one, supposedly there is a clean version that people claim can spawn at Dolly sods, but I have never seen one there. Or anywhere, for that matter.
---
People who play videogames. In Team Fortress 2, the Demoman's sticky jump was originally a bug. Hell, the ability to disguise as enemies back in the original Team Fortress was a bug, meaning the Spy as a concept was born from a bug.
---
The concept that all bugs are inherently a bad thing is a misconception. Some make builds more viable and enjoyable -- like the shotgun VATS magic damage bug right now in 76, that makes shotguns both fun and viable. Others make some builds too strong, to the point of being overpowered -- like the magic damage bug with pretty much any other high fire rate gun that has lots of ammo in the mag to spare (heavy weapons being the main culprit).
---
How do you enjoy this game at all if everything is just a measure of throughput and efficiency? Sounds like *work* to me, tbh.. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I will definitely retract my statement about it not being competitive - after all, if you put two guys in a room it's instantly a measuring contest (physical or otherwise) so yes I suppose that is true here too.
---
And I would go so far as to argue that there are *no builds at all*, at least not in any way that was intentional. Based on how everything else ~doesn't~ works in this game, I'm more inclined to believe that they just haphazardly threw in some legendary effects. Bloodied and Unyielding works by coincidence alone, and Junkies is just a strong effect ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è to assume they knew what they were doing is both giving them too much *and* too little credit at the same time. If they knew what they were doing, they are morons for basically ruining almost all possible builds. If they didn't and they were just haphazardly throwing some effects in, then they are morons all the same.
---
That being said, I play as a Bloodied Unyielding melee. But not because of throughput and efficiency. I'd go so far as to say I was already playing melee, and then I was kinda shoe-horned into Bloodied by The Elusive Crane rewarding something as strong as a BSS Sledgehammer at the end of that questline. None of the other rewards for other weapons are anywhere near that close to a perfect roll. Then I started to get bored of the slow swing speed and swapped to a Power Fist after I was extremely lucky during Fasnacht and basically got whatever I wanted for a few stupid masks üòÖ but anyway.. 
---
My position is that they should buff and refine all the other possible builds to make them **more fun** because they are more viable. I'm assuming I'll ragequit for good before we ever see Legendary Perks, and my SCORE rank is just over 80 without consistently remembering food buffs or Well Rested.. so tbh what else would I care about experience for? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I forgot where I was going with this. i kinda just started typing and this is what came out.
---
The hell? I've placed them in many trees all over the branches lol. Think I can get atleast 6 in that tree and ive never had it tell me that lol
---
The purveyors has an expanded loot pool which includes wastelander items and Fixer once you learned the plans, so it‚Äôs a good source of possibility rare and good items. I used to farm only WS, some westek, Harpers Ferry and watoga. Then Watoga got nerfed to zero, WS legendary spawns was heavily reduced. But I still just frequent those above spots minus Watoga bots. 
---
What I learned from this RNG game is that it will never give you what you want at the moment you want it, but it will give it to you at certain point. And most importantly it will give you good stuff when you don‚Äôt need it. Don‚Äôt sell/trade away good stuff that you don‚Äôt need at the moment, but just might try later. When I played only one heavy gunner character I thought all rifles are kinda useless and bloodied is just too risky to play, back then there wasn‚Äôt even murmrgh so I simply left stuff in train station containers or sold them to bots. Many dumb decisions were made. When I decided to build a second character for rifles I wish I still had everything RNG dropped me. So the farming continued lol.
---
I SO wanted chickens meandering my camp with my Brahmin üò≠
---
No, I mean he was able to place a fully Lootable Safe, then loot it, then have a trap destroy the Safe and when he repairs the trap the Safe and all it's loot respawn.
---
Thats it, but most high-level players already have the rewards. The plan is okay, but the special hazmat suit is only for collectors as it can not be repaired. So most players just join for XP, legendaries (for scrip), pleasant valley claim tickets (to have chance for getting the fancy revolver/shotgun) and other loot like some chems and some ammo. Going for the ore would mean you need to get out of your unyielding armor and have to deal with carry weight loss, which is more struggle than the small rewards from completing the event is worth.
---
Thanks, nice chatting with you.
---
You bet
---
Oh I didn't paid attention, I've see those all over but didn't look if they are clean or not, might be because i like those old things, like the old toy truck instead of the clean one üòÖ. I Will keep an eye on it now!
---
Lol
---
Continuous damage weapons are op due to the constant stagger when properly setup perks/mutations. I think this is why we don't see legendary varients of these weapons; as well as legendary rippers being legacy, and buzzy blades being weak af.
---
Damn, I‚Äôve been looking for plans and got my first encounter yesterday. Never new about it leading you to stashes
---
Really? Will keep trying then! That's some bs right there! Lol i even tired blueprinting the jar hoping will change something but nothing
---
There are two low res pictures in the preview which are difficult to discern its light range/strength and is irrelevant because their previews are often inaccurate anyway (which has been a major complaint since forever), of which the description says "Catch some lightning in a jar with the firefly ceiling **lamp**". A lamp projects light and using a word like lightning implies strength/intensity. This object costs the budget of a similar light, like a street light or actual lamp light and projects less than the frog jar which itself is not a light. Additionally, expecting it to hang from other objects even in the legendary run is not unreasonable. Its fine if they want to make it a misc/wall decor and adjust its cost accordingly, but much like the rest of the glitched camp rewards it does not function as advertised and is not worth using. Its not even that it is bad or doesnt look cool, its that its categorized as a light which takes budget nobody has to spare, and is locked behind 69 levels of this ridiculous legendary run. [Someone even stacked 16 of them and was unimpressed with its light generation at night.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hyqqpk/some_improvement_is_needed_with_the_fireflies/fzeanv1/)

---
I got all jet packs for the raider and entire t series I‚Äôm set
---
Any prefix can drop from the machine?
---
I can understand :). I prefer the brownish teapot as well, but I really would like to have a clean kettle as well, if it does indeed exist.
---
When people claim they are PvPers, more often than they have a similar set of Rules of Engagement as you've put forth. It's unfortunate every PvPer seems to be labeled as a griefer when griefing and PvP are two totally different things. This is supposed to be an unforgiving Wasteland, a survival of the fittest, might is right type of environment, after all.
---
In my former BoS, now raider clan, we have some guidelines, subject to each individual's own judgment and the circumstance at hand (e.g. a player who is acting like a jerk in voice chat is DOA no matter what level). But in essence, we follow the same principles as yours - fight people who can actually fight back, or swap to weaker items to make it a more even fight, don't crap talk in VC unless warranted, kill Wanted people to remove their bounty but protect their junk so they can pick it back up, etc.
---
Hey, not sure if you‚Äôre still interested, but thanks to the excavator PA I was able to farm enough lead and crystal yesterday / today to craft 1000 cryocells and crafted a cryolater. It was pretty useful by the way, for everyone else to easily target the SBQ. Anyway, if you‚Äôre on PC and stilling willing to gift a fixer plan in exchange for the cryolater and 1000x ammo as proof, lemme know! Thanks for the tip anyway!
---
Duper‚Äôs are quite frequent, it‚Äôs not always obvious when someone is duplicating
---
I had a shotgun character for awhile. I blew through plastic making shells because shotguns are pretty terrible. I kept hoping I'd get a good legendary but I never did. Other than bulking it's the only real use for it en masse that I can think of.
---
Do you get more ore if wearing the excavator PA?
---
Idk if you noticed this but Lucky Hole mine is linked to the Dunwich Borers, they both have that creepy statue deep underground. Dunwich Borers has one in the sacrifice chamber and Lucky Hole Mine has a ton of them
---
T-51 is good for energy resistance, raider is basically body armor with extra steps so it's Shit, T-60 has solid ballistic resistance and decent rad resist, X01 is apex PA as it basically has it all bumped up to 10, thsts as far as my knowledge goes.Hope this helps.
---
If i found one i will let you know here üòä
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah lol thats weird soon as I unlocked it that was the first place I placed it and I had no issues
---
I‚Äôm not super worried about getting 3 or 4, but why do people put on power armor before entering and then just camp the scavengers!? Until the perk loadout system is released, my toon honestly can‚Äôt go into high rad zones (PA destroys me) so I really have to completely chance all my perks for like 5 minutes of the event if I want to help, but why are you putting on rad-resistant gear and then just collecting kills? most of us are letting you know when we see a 2/3* and your chances are still slim if some jerk is just shooting everything he sees.
---
Feel free to get some tags while you‚Äôre mining, but high hp, low dmg, and PA plz collect!
---
Don‚Äôt worry it has like a 20% drop rate at One Violent Night. Not rare.
---
Is the hazmat suit actually that rare?  It was like one of the first things I got from the event and I actually have 2 of them now.
---
LMAO...OK man. They shouldn't ever have created a system where the ore runner gets screwed out of XP AND drops from kills. Even if you're on a team and your teammate kills while you run, the event are is large enough that you still cant loot half the bodies.
---
Face it man, Bethesda fucked this one up. If I'm running ore and the entire event fails if I don't do it, I should be getting XP and able to loot. The event is broken. You're punished for doing what needs to be done for the event to succeed.
---
I guess I never looked too closely at the goals on this, I‚Äôve never started the event just always came in after it started and thought the goal was to protect the scavengers ...  I always collect some ore but guess I‚Äôll need to look into it more next time I‚Äôm in it.
---
There are a few golf balls and baseballs in the gym at Morgantown HS
---
I personally know about 5 people that were "banned" but then had their accounts reinstated, and their inventories were untouched.
---
The weapons, though much less valuable than they were before the dupe wave, are still more valuable than caps so that's why you don't see them in vendors.
---
See, the people that were duping weapons and had access to duped weapons, are usually also people who have access to thousands/millions of duped holiday gifts.
---
 Which means there are lotsa people playing that have easy access to basically unlimited caps, which means caps are worthless to them.
---
Wait so it‚Äôs actually possible to have all the in-game mutations active at once?
---
When me and my friends do the event we will cripple the ghouls to slow/stop spawns. We get people all the time who will kill the ghouls on the ground and not put in any ore. Those people are not only not helping, they are making the event harder.
---
But what does it have to do with what OP proposed? None of those things are implemented yet duper's are fine. Doesn't make sense to not add QOL content because of dupers who will always try to find a way to dupe anyway.
---
Excavator can carry the most with calibrated shocks. But has the least resistance to everything. Then it goes T-45, T-51B, T-60, X-01 and finally T-65 with the most resistance. Carry weight is the same with all of these I believe except excavator.
---
Scorchbeast. Giant mutated bat. Stay far away until you level up a bit or you will get your cheeks clapped.
---
I usually go collect ore but the opposite problem happens: people SUCK at defending the scavengers. So now I‚Äôm the guy running between all the scavengers, healing them with friendly fire, and mopping up the waves of ghouls that others can‚Äôt kill. 
---
Tip: max out your glow sights perk and equip it at the start of the event. Those ghouls are tough to kill quickly enough without a shotgun or strong melee weapon, so give yourself a damage buff. 
---
Meanwhile, my problem with ore duty is my crappy rad resistance. I have a full set of SS armor but I still melt way too quickly in the tunnels. My excavator armor keeps me alive long enough to collect ~5 ore before I have to scrub off. Tips/gear recommendations are welcome because I want to get better at collecting ore in situations like the one OP describes
---
I've luckily never had that issue personally.
---
I‚Äôm hoping the stones that were added tie in some how
---
I haven't bought any tiers. I'm currently lvl 87. I can complete most of the dailies within 30mins or so except leveling up (currently lvl 517) but I have a good xp route for that and as long as I'm not collecting junk it takes around and hour to do that. You should of kept saving your atoms because you would of still been ahead without those 25 tiers.
---
Personally I just think the price should be lower. Giving it a legendary effect would mean using any other headpiece would put you at a disadvantage.
---
Ah, I remember when I was a measly level 6. Found my way to Camden Park somehow. Surrounded by level 23 scorched. 
---
And then, as if I had beckoned him, my knight in shining power armor appeared from a rooftop, blocking the sun so all I can see was the shadow of his towering frame. 
---
Without hesitation and with a gatling laser, he cleared the way for me. Before I could even react, he bounced high and away, never to be seen again. 
---
Still, I swoon. I'm still in that server, waiting by the window at my camp hoping once more the sunlight could be overshadowed by his flawless entrance.
---
Getting a bounty is super hard anymore. The only way to get bounties anymore is picking locks in people camps/workshops. Theres other ways, but i don't exactly know how to do it. I use to make it a goal to get a high bounty just so I can find someone to pvp me. Stopped doing it now because everyone just gets the initiation kill and hops servers like wuss.
---
Its still one of the best XP farms for me with up to 40k XP in 10 minutes (without buffs). I wouldn't call this shit. But again it depends on how many people join and if you can kill/tag the ghouls fast enough. If other players kill the ghouls before you can do something (for example when you play as a melee build), then yes I agree this is shit.
---
There's a quest you get from the Overseer to rob Vault 79, which unlocks gold bullion and trading with bullion dealers.
---
Thats great to hear! 99 percent of your interactions will be positive in this game.
---
I belive healing factor plus rads is why it happens. I'm a bloodied build and I  got rid of healing factor (To remove the chem reduction penalty) and I haven't had the fast travel bug happen since.
---
I just chow down on melons, same as soup, except no need to prepare it, you just pick it up off the ground and eat it.
---
And if it goes bad I just eat the spoiled food or drop it.
---
You're right, forgot that, fixed my math
---
Man i didn't even post this on my main acct i fuckin hate it here dude
---
I had that happen, but it changed to Super Mutants after I let "defend" fail and got "retake" instead.   
---
I also got defend against feral mongrels 1/4 again, which made me abandon the workshop. The dogs just run away half the time, it's not worth the hassle hunting them down for ages.
---
It‚Äôs the new skin.
---
That you did all that and only came up with about 1k cork is kinda crazy and shows just how much more rare it is as a junk item than all the other junk items you listed. I think that's telling, honestly. Players should be stockpiling cork hard the most right now.
---
They're pretty damn rare. Your pretty lucky
---
If we're abusing spawning mechanics, there's better ore veins to hit than Glassed Caverns. And Line in the Sand blows everything away.
---
Sounds like a great idea, tired of getting up every day just to redeem a measly 200 Bullion and 150 Scrip
---
You will never see the duped weapons in vendors. The weapons everyone was duping were/are considered rare, since the drop rate is well below 1%, but we will never know the extent to which they were duped (both the dupers and Bethesda want to keep it this way). They are traded on various marketplaces for more caps than one character can carry, and in some cases, real world currency.
---
This is the danger of duping.
---
Honestly an unpopular opinion, but the C.A.M.P Budget is fine as is, it was put into place to prevent players' camps from lagging out and straight up even crashing servers.
---
In Angry Turtles testing there is really no difference between the power amors.  Its really small the difference between damage resistance.  Energy resistance wasnt even worth mentioning.  With emergency protocols equiped on your torso,  I would just rock the Excavator Armor for the extra weight.  But get calibrated shocks for the legs for another +100 carry weight.  
---
I am a full health PA build.  I am always in my excavator but i have my cards tuned for kinetic dynamo torso so my ap absorbs most incoming damage.  I only die if i dont keep track of my rads or the Encrypid Event.
---
Or in the ground you never know where his glitchy ass will end up next
---
Heck yes.
---
Thanks for the input. How do you unmark junk for search?
---
by spending a **LOT** of bullion and getting rep with the settlers
---
I'm not privy to mentioning this location in the off chance I show up to it in a few days from now and don't see the baseballs I grabbed the other day, but there is a sports shop in the strip mall over in the Mire that has a couple of baseballs lined on the shelves. Should be up on the upper east side of the mall.
---
Gold bullion for the settlers
---
Same; I feel so guilty killing cultists. I‚Äôd rather not.
---
Yea, just save up your gold bullion. I can't remember who but one of the vendors has the plans when you get high enough faction. Probably Settlers since that's where you get it originally.
---
Haven't gotten any plans yet from them, but I did get a random Radium Rifle when I was right in the middle of grinding the attachments for it so I was pretty grateful. I mean, it still didn't actually fucking *give me anything* since the chances for unlocking Radium mods are so ridiculously low, but at least it saved me some of the screws and nuclear material I would've spent.
---
your chance to get it for free was by doing some settler quests before making a final decision. now you have to pay a LOT of rep and bullion to get it.
---
I believe that this individual may have a slight bias in favor of the Mothman cult
---
what platform you? i'm on ps4 been on it since beta, if you're also on ps4 you can show me how? lol.
---
There's a lot of skins man, this replay doesn't really help.
---
It's the C.A.M.P. skin you got from the Legendary Run. It's a known bug.
---
What quest was it exactly? Were you max rep?
---
I think I know exactly what youre talking about and its a semi known bug and also a reputation known glitch.
---
The day after Beth unbanned them and let them keep their duped shit, ebay listings skyrocketed. Thank you beth and your dupers for the healthy economy.
---
Get an explosive something ffs, ash piles kill sanity
---
No, they got massive feedback on it and said they'd probably change it. 
---
Same thing for the ammo converter.
---
Yeah cork is a pain. If I lazer focus on just cork and gathering enough to ensure a spawn reset I feel comfortable saying I could increase that output by 2.5√ó perhaps 3x but not much more and that would be without getting all the other resources.
---
the one where you have to fix something. No i just completed the wastelanders main quest with the raiders.
---
Something like this exists, but only in the Enclave Bunker at Whitesprings
---
I know right? It‚Äôs wonderful :)
---
Was the quest 100% gone and not in your dailys anymore? Sounds like a bug
---
Well if you‚Äôre on PC and want someone to farm some quick flux astro13.
---
Imo, you can do any sort of fps RPG build and still be fine.
---
I heard it protects you and your camp as well. Not from nukes though. 
---
Never used pacifist mode though so cannot confirm or deny.
---
How can i get my foundation rep up higher?
---
yup, it did complete and i got the caps and everything but the reputation bar didnt go up at all
---
By contrast if I honed in on steel I could quadruple that output and I would still be getting some plastic, wood, and cloth.
---
Thank you! I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with it. There's no way legendary perks will be out next update.
---
Another god send
---
I care. Get some sleep though!
---
Here's my problem. 
---
If I stay and guard the people, nothing ever gets to back to me to kill so I'm doing nothing.
---
If I then, in the same event, decide "fuck it" and go out to collect ores the scavs suddenly get flooded....
---
Extremely.
---
I always collect ores, because I don't have a legacy gun to melt through all the ghouls and deathclaws (Because someone always hastto turn in early) like everyone else. If there's more than a few people there I can't even get tags in.
---
the daily quest with Ward ia the main way. you can also do Davenport's photo daily, take pics of crater, and then give em to foundation. you can also do Rocksy's crater daily but instead of killing the runnaway raider, convince them to join the settlers (note this will decrease raider rep unless you already have it maxed out).
---
i dont remember what rank the stealth suit unlocks, but when it does you can buy the plan to make it from the guy in the white vault-tec shirt at foundation.
---
It's an event which means you play together. If people took turns then it wouldn't be a fight. You're only punished if jerks one shot everything. It's literally how society works, instead of worrying about everyone else getting something you don't have, if everyone thought let me make sure someone else gets a hit in too then we wouldn't have these problems.
---
And again there's so many events that you act like it's a single player game where it never spawns again. Go to Cranberry Glade and kill the Mirelurk Queen and her spawns, go to Gulper Lagoon. Plenty of places you could get quick easy xp by yourself.
---
You're not going to die if you don't kill one ghoul, I promise.
---
No, as it is a quest item, not real Ore. 
---
Alas though my Excevator is bugged on all 5 characters an doesn't double Ore yield anyway...
---
I sided with the raiders and got the stealth suit.  I dont know how.
---
Possibly the lvl 33?  This was level 50, as is my junkies with 33% V.H.C. It almost always 1 shots. Every once in a while , like when I am switching targets (in VATs) fast, it‚Äôll not work, or even rubber band. Also, I have had mixed results with the blocker armor. And no luck with gauss shotguns
---
Oh trust me I remember when I first tried NW I did the same kinda by starting way up at the Mine in Morgantown or tygart in flat woods and just have those really slow games trying to get as far by lying low. 
---
Over time though if you give the game a fair chance you‚Äôll eventually find yourself running to the gunfire to join in the party.  I couldn‚Äôt wookie now a whole game if I tried, just ain‚Äôt the same after you get the experience living la vida loca.
---
I. It only care but will probably copy this!
---
Is this Hemmingways throwaway?
---
Server hop at Slocum Joe‚Äôs and help the Settlers when you see them, you gain rep way faster this way than doing dailies for Ward.
---
Wait, it says I gotta sleep with the Headache Queen?  How do I sleep in the same bed as her, for that matter how do I trigger her going to sleep?
---
Thank you, I appreciate the relevant info

Strangler heart beats out t 65 on rad resistance by 70, but considering the built in percent reduction for all power armors, the t 65 is best for defense over all.
---
T 65 is definitely the best when it comes to defense.
---
Again limited to only when the event is happening.  Glassed cavern literally can be done on any server, anytime, and continuously indefinitely.  So what ore veins are better than Glassed Cavern?
---
You mean dodgy absorbs damage and kinetic dynamo helps recharge ap, right?
---
I play almost every event and I‚Äôm a pretty high level, but Project Paradise is a tedious mess.
---
I kinda get them selling for real world money. Except...why in the hell would anyone spend more money on this game than they already have!? I have a total of 4 weapons I use on the two toons I have. All from the purveyor, and have 0 problem killing anything.
---
Nice haha
---
We also need people to stop turning in ore so early because then we lose all the xp from getting kills
---
If you go to a sports game and you run out of chips... Eat Prilosec
---
I'm working on getting t 65 pa right now, the best defensively.  When I have it I'll use it for defense and excavator for carry weight after a dungeon or quest.  I'm doing the same thing right now but with x 01.
---
You made your bed now you gotta sleep in it raider SCUM
---
Right and glassed cavern increases the number of mobs the more people their are.  The XP actually gets better the more people you have and it never stops.  It literally is on a never ending timer that every 30 seconds each person can spawn 6 scorched or 5 scorched and a scorchbeast.  I literally force private servers to reboot in 90 mins because I'm killing so many mobs and overwhelm the budget.
---
I‚Äôve seen this once. I thought it was strange and did what I usually do... shot it.
---
Are the brother hood challenge out yet
---
There is ore in radiation rumble? lol
---
Doesn't make them money and it would increase server load if only slightly so it won't happen
---
Out back of Whitesprings, along the wall is a shelf with a plastic bin that contains about a dozen golf balls, plus in the nearby trash can there is a load of plastic and paper items, it‚Äôs one of the best little honey holes that most folks go right by.
---
or people could just stop being proper fannies and take turns getting the ore
---
You are so awesome, I really appreciate this
---
It could be a little brighter when the fireflies light up, but otherwise I like the look of it hanging from my covered porch next to the cardinal wind chimes.
---
I mostly just see people missing out on experience from not turning in any ore at this point, so no harder waves ever show up.
---
Except the people that want to murder low levels.
---
I did this for 2 hours once. And in that time i found a random settler encounter 8 times. The bar barely moved.
---
Foundation are raiders, just the dishonest kind.
---
Meg doesn't pretend to be something she's not - Paige and Ward though...
---
When they're wanted, they can't attack back, so you can kill them pretty easily
---
Also, VATs work with them
---
Aaand so does a nuke lol
---
Tuesday I think
---
No excavator?
---
I used to run this game on a laptop, it might just be a hardware problem, but I dont know.
---
Yea I know what you mean about the regulars now being like 100‚Äôs of levels up, I guess those of us that do it daily just don‚Äôt get bored with it. 
---
Usually each day I have some exhilarating fight that keeps me coming back for more, I can‚Äôt say the same at all about adventure.  I just got the wastelands story line done the other day, that was a super small amount of content for how long wastelanders took to develop, yikes... and that was pre COVID work from home days :-O.
---
We care, thank you for your service to the community
---
I think you should be aware that players can‚Äôt actually do anything to hurt you or your camp unless you willfully engage in PvP. So you can do pretty much anything and ignore everyone else for the most part
---
Overseer rank is easy if you have a character that you have not used for NW, getting from level 1 to 2 is easy.
---
The free atom shop items is the same thing, just not daily
---
Do you have all of your junk scrapped?  As in scrap steel, circuits, loose screws, instead of desk fans and stuff?
---
The bloodied limbdamage legendary buzz blade is quite op with the slugger perks equipped, and then with the food bugs it‚Äôs definitely viable. 
---
Maybe the chainsaw use them perks also? Shame you can‚Äôt get legendary versions of that
---
Its their fault for that,
---
Should've considered someone would buy em
---
There is actually allot less.music in this one. New vegas and fo2 and 4 had quite a few songs this one does not.
---
I used a shotgun for the first 16 levels since it is such a powerful weapon once you can get it (I just hit level 18). I finally completed making a suppressed pipe sniper rifle, and have finally been able to move to that as my primary weapon. I cannot wait until I can finally manufacture a semi auto sniper (or better).
---
Anyways, I hated having to fix the shotgun so much, and you are absolutely right, I went through so much freaking plastic!
---
Doing Project Paradise: a level 20 kept trying to engage me. I was around 330 at the time I think, it's been a couple weeks so the level grinding throws it off. Suffice to say, trying to pick a fight by punching me in my T-65 was just... weird.  
---
So I stood and watched him.   
---
I watched him punch and punch.   
---
I watched the Glowing Yao Guai run up to him.   
---
I watched it club him into paste with a single blow.   
---
Then I opened up on it 'cause fuck Glowing Yao Guai.  
---
It was an odd experience.
---
At like 45 think i can make it? Currently have 1400 atoms to use if i need to.. really want the fireplace
---
Ha!good deal bro!dont feel bad .if you dont want it put it up in the market for trade.might get your unicorn piece for it
---
I go for the ore every time, but its clear at this point that most people will not get any ore at all when there is experience to be had from just killing ghouls.
---
I've been massively disappointed by pretty much ever reward the run has. But the Firefly jar broke my heart. It's pretty much worthless.
---
If we each had our owns ways to earn score without ever having to step in each other‚Äôs worlds (99% adventure:m : 1% Nw) I think that would have been the whole fix for these reoccurrence posts all along.  
---
You can‚Äôt vats players so I assume you mean vats grenades.  But yea I think frog legs should be a serum or mutation just like the other mutations, it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm fond of but like you say literally everyone uses it.  Be much better if it was taken out.  
---
I can‚Äôt be bothered to go play the other cartoony BR‚Äôs, having one in fallout world to me is perfect.  Janky as hell but I‚Äôm already used to that from playing BS games since Morrowind.
---
Oh grow up Karen, for fucks sake. There are far worse video games when it comes to this topic. Ever seen the strip clubs in GTA? Its a damn video game. Its a joke, and I highly doubt anyone would do that IRL. If you are this sensitive, maybe gaming isn't for you ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
you can't have carnivore and herbivore at the same time. Otherwise, yes. Why'd you think not?
---
Yeah I have two of them.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm gonna try using it for a little while, but with how hard it is to make fuel for me, I‚Äôm probably gonna eventually have to trade it.
---
My camp is 100% unlocked for all!  I even have a sign that states Take What You Need
---
Where did they acknowledge lowering the cost to upgrade the perks?
---
Damn, im still grinding for both factions rep, mainly for the ammo maker so I guess it'll be a while.
---
Most likely they meant they are priced so high that most players would not accept that price, and message the owner for negotiating. 
---
Lots of camps I come across sell items at 30k and want you to ask about a normal price or trade.
---
Pfft as well, tasty squirrel stew and scorch beast brains for the win.
---
I've been running fashion finder for the past 2 days, and it seems about 50% of power armor is straight up invisible.
---
100% I care!! I‚Äôm grinding fallout practically all day tomorrow for lodes of resources and this will be super helpful so thank you!
---
Yeah this guy was only asking for trades tho, and pretty high tier stuff for it too. The sign even said will negotiate flux, but no caps.
---
Oof then. They had to expect it at least.
---
Should have called the Appalachian animal control.
---
People wanna do the most damage possible and easily solo SBQ. It‚Äôs fun to see big damage numbers, I reckon.
---
Trust me, I know. Again, i was that guy. I ran the ore, i invited people, i waved people over to legendarys. I got screwed too much. I'm over it. I'll farm where I want now. I can play how I want to. Jump servers if it bothers you.
---
If I get a good public group that willing to play fair I'll do it too. It just never happeneds anymore.
---
Rippers don‚Äôt drop as legendaries anymore? TIL
---
You can get 250 Reputation from Ward by donating the reward. You only get 10-25 per random Settler Encounter. 
---
That‚Äôs a lot of server hopping, especially when it‚Äôs not a guaranteed spawn.
---
It's funny because it spawns and flies in from somewhere far away in the forest. My first encounter with one was as a low level (like 3-4?) during Beta first starting to wander Appalachia, creeping along the side of some hill with rocky outcroppings, and I hear these great flapping wings... you bet your ass I was crouching hiding behind trees hoping it didn't spot me. I didn't realize that the name being white meant it wasn't hostile...
---
Omg, someone once spammed this fucking annoying
---
And the seller probably didn‚Äôt even get all those caps, unless they were at zero. 
---
That‚Äôs on them for putting it up for sale.
---
That's a smart idea.
---
I get it cause I got pissed off because some level 500 was 1 shotting the legendaries and not helping but it says more about them not helping than you.
---
I do good things because it's the right thing to do not because I get something for it and I help others because I would want to be helped.
---
I don't care if everyone else is an asshole because I am not. But if you have that low self esteem then do you üòä
---
Sure. But BoS and alien stuff first.
---
Nah, but they're actually "old content". OG Fallout had them; they're FEV mutated earthworms that like to hang with the FEV mutated supermutants.
---
"You want bread!? 3 DOLLARS!"
---
It‚Äôs only fallout
---
blocker maxed reduces most melee.  rejuvinated perk is great for plus 50 ap regen.  ricochet reduces incoming damage 18 percent.
---
I miss nervous Travis
---
What's this about making donations?
---
Is there "best ammo" to generate when used along with the Ammo Converter? Granted, the tedium of the actual conversion mini-game sucks right now, and may change (menus, bulk rates, etc.) in the future-- does it make economic sense to have it make arrows or bolts or someting then sell as ammo points and convert to what I actually want?
---
Aquaboy/girl is great for this!
---
You know what I'm trying really hard to find the comment chain because I feel like I read it but im finding 0 evidence. 
---
I did find the proof for the ammo converter, but im having trouble digging for the legendary cards being reworked.
---
18 percent, really.
---
I do my part in helping people out. It has nothing to do with self esteem. I like how you talk about "the right thing to do" and then in the same breath try to toss around insults. That's super mature.
---
get over it and grow up
---
It's legacy now, but Ultracite was bugged where you could put jetpacks on any piece. So my Ultracite is my main set. Jetpack on one arm, Optimized bracer on the other, Calibrated shocks on the legs, Emergency Protocols on the Torso (bloodied build), Targetting HUD on the helmet, I'm good to go. Problem is getting mods for Ultracite is HARD, but at this point I think I've learned them all (Yes folks, I can make EP and Shocks for Ultracite! PC only)
---
Yo guys, just a heads up. I never experienced this bug, nor had my gf. We bought healing factor recipe, used them, and had the bug like nothing else. If you‚Äôre using it I‚Äôd recommend trying without again, we literally haven‚Äôt experienced it again since.
---
I found a three star, level 5 10mm with Instigating today and gave it to a level 2 player outside Vault 76. They logged off almost right away.
---
Yes, this ^^ don‚Äôt run healing factor in general really.
---
I use dodgy, planning on using blocker, but I prefer something else for my chest mod, namely emergency protocols for protection or +2 strength for my carry weight pa.
---
Yeah it's the same list the faction vendors have.
---
Did you just say meow?
---
I think I have one on PC if you'd like to have it again. (Think it's currently hogging a slot in my vendor XD)
---
I'm referring to the Armco ammo appliance that costs 750 gold bullion, not the ammo converter. The appliance just makes ammo like the ammo factory afaik.
---
Well if i use hazmat suite I'm gonna die quick. I'd do it if someone got my back
---
Line in the sand with scorchbeasts from above and scorched charging the courtyard while the music plays really hits different
---
im telling you it doesnt matter.  10 shot from super mutant wearing excavator pa gives you 33 damage.  10 shot from supermutant wearing t51B or ultracite PA give you 29 damage. I know Bethesda stats says one thing but actual in game testing says its not that big of a difderence.   Rock the excavator pa with calibrated shocks for the plus 200 carry weight.  use kinetic dynamo and dodgy for full health.  or emergency protocols for bloodied.
---
I have an rx 580 and the game looks/runs fine.  Of course it wouldn't hold a candle to a 1060 or a 5700.
---
I still cant get in :(
---
That wasn't a true bounty. A true bounty shows up on the map and they're free to attack at any time.
---
What you got was the result of not having Pacifist on- when you shoot a player, it's telling you that IF THEY RETALIATE, and you win the fight, you will get 50 caps (based on your/their level). It's just the "win" condition of a PvP "Duel"
---
yes- one of my favorite bits of fo76 lore- super creepy
---
To me the right thing to do is to stand up to jerks which is what you framed your "Bethesda made me only care about XP and now I'm a jerk at events" rant about.
---
And as my people like to say "A hit dog hollers." Enjoy playing your game üòä
---
Many of the people I've traded with and left on my friends list from the other sub havent logged on since the bans were first announced. They haven't come back either, and these were mostly high volume people with hundreds of karma so I'm sure they had a ton of very high end gear. 
---
I'm guessing a lot of the weapons are now just gone. Shame to see so many people who are high volume traders are likely dupers because of what this suggests, but it's also good to see Beth didn't seem to just unban everyone who duped and give them all their items back as many posts suggest.
---
check out the wiki page he listed and make your own decisions. 5mm makes a lot of sense for anyone who uses it.
---
It's a server issue. Probably have to contact Bethesda
---
You can just make a new character. You hit level 3 when you get to the Wayward, level 4 for the first Responders mission, and level 5 for the second. If you kill a bunch of stuff or do the Agricultural Center Event it's an easy level 6. Then just delete them and start another new character. Just make sure to only claim reward with your main.
---
And the one in Hornwright mansion.
---
I have a level 200+ friend who I play with on a regular basis and he said the most mutations he‚Äôs ever seen active at once is 6. So I figured that was most likely the limit
---
I'm not trying to kick while your down but it does say "different". That's what your missing.
---
No idea what it was related to, but I traveled to someone's camp; shortly after I arrived their camp vanished, but I found 2 level 14ish free radicals wandering around the edge of where it was.
---
Same here! I was going to look and see if that was ever explained on this sub but forgot until now.
---
I'm not sure it does
---
You can also get +5 INT (with mutations/perks) from Brain fungus soup. It lasts 30min instead of 60 like the relish, but is much easier to find and make.
---
The Carnivore equivalent to the above is tasty squirrel stew for 25% XP and broiled scorchbeast brain for +7 INT.
---
My camp has some phone booths and I put the lamps in them. It looks really cool.
---
Some people use new characters to get a quick level up for the daily challenge. So you logging off quickly at the overseers camp isn't as out of the ordinary as you'd think!
---
Well I run a junkies build, so for me. A lot. Of. Drugs.
---
So it doesn‚Äôt really matter which one you use? As in there is no best power armour? Just whatever mods you put on them? Sorry if that sounds stupid but I‚Äôve a lot to learn this is the first fallout game I‚Äôve played
---
99% of the time the people doing big fixes and the people doing cosmetic stuff aren‚Äôt the same devs.
---
Maybe he threw on Starched Genes and stopped getting new ones? Or uses it and takes rad-away regularly and simply loses mutations as fast as he gains them?
---
I always remember getting canned meat stew, but the issue was it used to spoil, and that was back when it gave it to the whole server and no refrigerated back packs so most of the time it'd be spoiled meat before you even knew you had it lol
---
X 01, Ultracite, T60 power armor all has high radiation resistance.  I can usually collect an entire cavern before needing the showers. 4 cavern and 4 shower trips.
---
watch Angry Turtles Youtube video on the best power armor part 2.  He literally spent hours doing testing on it. And recorded all the info. You can see on the chart at the end that there's really not that much of a difference.  He will take you to school on anything you want to learn about this game.
---
Oh that sounds nice!! I'm sure more ideas will came up too. It just that I had an idea of what i wanted to do with it and i can't so is kinda sad, it should give the option without the cord to use as floor decoration or something
---
&gt;And yes, I'm opposed to prisons
---
Well that's a grand idea. Let's let murderers run free. 
---
"Oh you brutally killed 14 people? Go sit in the time out chair until you apologize, and then you can go free. Also here's your gun back!!"
---
Its awesome. I killed something near a chair and it look like someone had used a paint gun on it. Id rather that than the gore. It cracks me up everytime I have it
---
Ok will check it out thanks!
---
Cant get legendary dragons anymore? Pretty sure I had a 3 star a year ago. Ghoul slayers and cant remember what else. Wish I didnt scrap it
---
They should be. You know how to code? Go to the bug fix team. Get rid of all the bugs, Fallout 76 becomes the best game ever, then you can fill it with sparkles and shinies. Right now they're asking to put confetti on a turd.
---
Is this ally along with the raider ally really worth having around? It seems they only offer one quest each.
---
Nice, I‚Äôm saving up for a set of T65 so that should sort me out then. Only another month or so of grinding bullion ...
---
They aren't affected by specific perks, just generally damage perks like Nerd Rage and Bloody Mess. I *think* strength affects them, and damage boosts from your primary weapon (bloodied primary, junkies primary) will increase your damage too IIRC.
---
I think you have to land the killing blow, IIRC
---
A perk that lets us stack criticals would be nice
---
That‚Äôs kind of what I‚Äôm thinking. Lvl 210 and you‚Äôre upset some guys stole some water? They‚Äôre literally just playing part of the game
---
I do grab the ore. I'm usually the only one who does and I seriously doubt an actual new lvl 1 player could grab the ore since the mobs would one hit them lol
---
If you need to say all that to convince yourself you're doing everyone a favor on public servers be my guest, but it doesn't mean you're right.
---
Why would they use resurces for that when you can do that yourself anyway using pre existing music apps like spotify etc
---
Thanks mate
---
Yup. And has an actual flashlight on it, instead of your pip-boy light
---
She fast traveled with me today.
---
You mean thoose lightbulbs that was a set of like 4-5 bulbs on a wire? There were never a light you can just hang straight onto an existing wire.
---
The closest thing in Fallout 76 is probbaly the cycling light which you can to connect wires to.
---
What game doesn't have a community with people who don't know how to play a specific event or playstyle?
---
Been gaming for 30 years and it has remained the same.
---
Thats a very nice set up!
---
The actual game stuff isn't too far out of line when you look at the roots of the game, the old FO1 and FO2 games. 
---
The atom-shop stuff is very Fortnite, though.
---
First off, thank you for doing this and writing it up for others, it seems quite noticeable that many people like having hard data to go by. Second, insomnia can do a lot of harm, i had it and it sucked. Look up military trick for sleeping anywhere. After two weeks you will be sleeping every time you are ready. 
---
Awesome post.
---
yes please, its too bulky. Not cute either, looks like a bunch of pipes coming out of your neck.
---
I want a explo flamer but I got my paws on a be gatling that I'm happy with
---
Guys like that are the reason I have a quad ffr gamma gun. Most run a bloodied build and that lil gem makes short work of them.
---
Check out angry turtles video on the ammo converter, can get flamed fuel pretty cheap if you can deal with all the clicking.
---
That's fair it can be overwhelming to start. I usually block off all my daily quests and just set a goal everytime I get on, and if I finish that and still feel like playing ill work on extra stuff. Just like in real life it's easier to whittle that list down slowly instead of trying to get into to much and get overwhelmed. If you do keep playing I wish you the best of luck .
---
my friend and I both still didn't have it so we went on a private server and tested, he got the finishing blow and still nope, just bugged
---
I hear ya. I would just like it to make it more immersive.
---
I had a level 5 guy attacking my level 11 guy repeatedly for about half an hour. I was working on my camp and was ignoring him at first because but his attacks were pushing me around and I couldn't place things accurately so I turned around and punched him to death. He kept coming back, I kept killing him in three hit and he wasn't hurting me at all (vampire knuckles probably helped). Eventually I went into my greenhouse dome to rest and locked the door. This asshole was still trying to attack me through the glass. I fast traveled to a finish a quest I was doing and when I came back twenty minutes later he was still hanging out nearby and came running at me when he noticed I was home. I killed him again and he dropped a bunch of scrap bundles so I just grabbed them and logged out. Stupid idiot.
---
red border = not enough perk points
---
remove everything try add frog legs first, if no go then check you have the right character for NW selected by going back to char select 
---
still fails , go ingame (adventure) and check you have 9 Agility
---
Outside of the legendary run what use is exp? After maybe lvl 80 if you built your set up right you don't need to keep lvling. I'm probably sitting on over 60 lvl ups and who knows how many perk card packs. I will say they event was made for team play, but you putting your gain over others isn't the games fault. It's yours.
---
No you could literally just take a hanging lightbulb or whatever and put it hanging on any connectors wires. It‚Äôs nice for when you use mods that set down the darkness of the world at night and you wanna light up your settlements streets. It‚Äôs completely possible in vanilla fallout 4 though though it‚Äôs not that useful of a thing unless your in settlements like hangman‚Äôs ally were you can have a bunch of wires going through the area
---
I mean... what exactly were you expecting?  The thing came with pictures in game showing you exactly what it would look like.
---
It's a hanging light... none of the images in game show it used as a desk lamp or anything else.  The jar isn't THAT invisible, and if they made it any more opaque it would look like a cloudy mess just like the frog in a jar.  They're fireflies not lightbulbs, and they're actually a bit brighter than the natural fireflies in game.  And you can hang it from anything you can already hang ceiling lights from, hell I just tested to be 100% sure and thanks to it's shape I could even hang it off a few tree branches in my camp that the lightbulb kept coming up as red on.
---
People find the weirdest shit to complain about with this game and "This thing is exactly as they advertised it and not something entirely different" is one of the more fucked up ones.
---
I'd have taken his stuff to teach him a valuable lesson on not bring the rust mentality to this game
---
I enjoy the music in the fallout games a lot, but I get realllllllly tired of the same 6 songs after a while.  
---
I wish I could mod the radio stations to add more like I could with FO4. I'm so sick and tired of question for half an hour and hearing all of the available songs and several more than once.  
---
Bethesda should add AT LEAST a song or two every time they do any kind of update.
---
I bought a two shot dragon right before the took them out of the game.
---
It's fun once in awhile
---
You too?
---
I‚Äôm not alone? Also, now the game crashes when I start signing in
---
Oh damnnnn more mathhhhh....
---
Uhhh, lessee, herbivore is + another 20% (40% for double days), and carnivore is + another 28% (56% for double days, but much harder to get)
---
Uggggggh....so 286% for herbivores, and 294% for carnivores. Double that for double days for 572% and 588% respectively
---
They specifically said on the bethesda forums when the reintroduce the perks to the PTS ( same time they made anti venom apply to PA and changed its name) that they will not be in patch 21. Beleive that was nearly a month back.
---
You would want to have Iron Fist equipped to help increase your damage with an unarmed weapon.
---
There's a video on YouTube detailing this running story of Dunwich since FO3. Those heads and the monster in Lucky Hole are tied to it. I feel like they're holding back on this big story and will reveal why it's all connected. Or they have no clue how to flesh out the story they started and are hoping some fans will fill in the homes then steal the idea.
---
Oh, I was actually thinking they must of been fairly common, maybe I should try trading one off.
---
Offhand probably gladiator?
---
The mezzanine is the floor below where rose is.
---
Same here. I've created a few posts just on the subject of Camps and specifically the modules.
---
We need more stuff to do that isn't a 1 time quest that leaves everyone starving for content a few weeks later.
---
Wait, deathclaw is considered unarmed?
---
One ran at me once and me thinking it was an albino, I shot it to pieces for the meat. Felt so bad afterwards.
---
As long as there is some friendly cultists I can worship with.
---
Ah ok. Haven‚Äôt been doing anything in the PTS this time around at all. Thanks for the info
---
Same goes for the fascist BOS.
---
Maybe they will fix it one day. I had a load of things  I did durring beta like 'visit the ash heap' that one day all unlocked one day when I logged on.
---
Thats the thing with the ultracite deposits, right? As I usually play solo going for something like West-Tek is more rewarding for me. To give some numbers: on the last double xp weekend I started with level 375 and ended at level 543 (stopped there as I reached SCORE rank 100) just by doing West-Tek runs and Radiation Rumble / Line in the Sand when it was up.
---
Is that why Foundation is littered with dismembered bodies on pikes and hanging from rooftops?
---
Not surprised.  üòßüëç
---
It's bolted onto a space craft that likely has a power supply. Also wavy is thick with scorched.
---
shotgun crit vats
---
No, we already played that game. We need new ideas, not FO3 all over again.
---
Who ever originally commented I can't see it for some reason
---
NP, im on console so i check the forums from time to time to stay in the loop.
---
Same. Definitely done it more than that. I sent in a ticket and they said ‚Äúyou have to do enough damage to loot her to get the achievement.‚Äù LMAO I‚Äôm level 325, have solo‚Äôd that fool and do triple nukes every couple of weeks. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs it Bethesda...
---
Can't you kill deathclaw and floaters? They give more xp!
---
It is, along with the other gauntlet type weapons, power fist, and I think death tambo. Also, a legendary weapon can help add to that damage, so a bloodied weapon, for example, would increase your damage if you have lower health.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve done it probably 100x. It‚Äôs bugged for sure
---
I do junkies large deathclaw (extra claw).   5 addictions including alcohol.   All my alts but one is junkies.   Junkie for life!
---
That‚Äôs strange, should be way more often, since there‚Äôs no high level spawn chance at that particular spot. I did it when I was doing Fasnacht, filled half of the whole bar in a few days, way faster than Ward. I don‚Äôt know if they nerfed that spot though.
---
So instead of buff the rippers they Just dissapear them
---
... 
---
So now I have a lega y 3*!?
---
The price should be lower. Remember the Radicals face mask? That shit made using any other headwear a disadvantage.
---
If Bethesda adds anything other that airborne and waterborne disease protection to a certain type of head wear, it would ruin the experience for people that want to wear something else.
---
It doesn't lower raider reputation at all, you still gain raider reputation afterwards as Rocksy honestly doesn't care what happens to the guy!
---
Exactly Level 1 releases snallygasters. Level 2 the floaters. And then 3 the deathclaws.
---
oh seriously? damn, could have sworn that after i told the guy that my settler rep went down...
---
&gt; from the guy in the white vault-tec shirt
---
Or no shirt (whenever he dreams about 'respecting' Jen). ;-)
---
I see, I've been trying to get a legendary deathclaw, but keep getting crap instead. Is my build good enough to run bloodied? I've tried once but kept getting hit before attacking and dying. Lol
---
Deathclaw gauntlet is considered unarmed.
---
It would be best to do the Overseer's quest first. After you complete that quest, a lot of dailies and events start to award gold bullion.
---
It‚Äôs a good spot because unlike other assault locations, there‚Äôs no high level spawns, so it‚Äôs quite frequent. Especially if the task is killing opossums or ants, you can get additional rep per kill. I filled half bar in just a few days on and off playing.
---
Will do, finding affordable plans are difficult.
---
Sure, it‚Äôs part of the game, but there is obviously people who enjoy it and engage with you in pvp and people who ignore and wait for you to move on, the people that I do mind is the ones who don‚Äôt get the hint and take pleasure in annoying and going above and beyond to bother and grief players, there IS a difference, even if the game has pvp in its design
---
Settler reputation goes down if you send a hunter after them, all you get out of this is extra time to reach the fleeing raider, not worth it! Sending the fleeing raider to them gets you settler reputation and raider reputation on quest turn in!
---
Same user: johnthewatchman im on now messing around lol
---
I think it‚Äôs an avatar for one of the devs. They are watching us.
---
You said you server hopped. Can you get into different private servers? If so, how? Lol
---
And there‚Äôs still no reason not to do Ward‚Äôs daily and get 250 rep. That‚Äôs the equivalent of a minimum of 10 of those mini-events.
---
Alien stuff does not mean mothership zeta. FNV had aliens, FO4 had aliens. Not only FO3.
---
We already have alien easter eggs in F76. 
---
Its a part of the franchise. It is fun and silly. That is why I want to see aliens come.
---
Yes
---
Thanks üòä
---
I would probably go with Ironclad instead of fireproof you help increase your damage resistance, but I think your body their perks are pretty good for a bloodied build. Your armor will make a big difference too so you would want to have unyielding armor. Using the armor mod on a backpack can be a big help too (if you don‚Äôt need the extra carry weight).
---
Make it so gathering ore is the only way you're eligible for good rewards. If you don't collect ore, you should only get missiles and mini nukes.
---
Of course, ward‚Äôs contribution still helps. But those mini events add up really quickly. There are other mini event locations too but Slocum is the best spot.
---
Happy cake day!!! üéÇ
---
Tried all that, and yes I bought it with points. Yep, read OP--base of 9 Ag.
---
Marathoner?
---
Tears streaming down my face while sitting on 800 improved repair kits.
---
New update coming Tuesday. Check the latest inside the vault article.
---
It‚Äôs part of the update coming Tuesday. Check out the latest inside the vault article for more details.
---
If I'm the only one repairing excavators in Uranium Fever, I one shot the legendaries as payment.
---
This is also my first online multiplayer game, it‚Äôs been such an awesome experience. Cheers vault dweller
---
Thank you for repairing them.
---
Gonna add to the chorus of voices to say that this also worked for me! Thanks man!
---
These days with all the magic shotguns and the armco you almost never need to craft it though. I can almost sustain my ammo on just scorched drops.
---
When I was new to the game, probably level 20 or so, I was in survival just looting around in a dark building when I heard someone's voice over the mic saying "where are you?" "I know you're in here" in the typical lowered, slowed down voice. It genuinely made me uneasy and hide from him because I didnt want him to kill me. 
---
I know a lot of people didnt like survival mode but times like that made it really fun and added the sense of feeling slightly unsafe to the game.
---
Overall, I would say just try out different things to see what works for your play style. Try out different cards or change up your armor and just compare numbers as well as what is most fun for you.
---
Just remembered... you know every time you make a new character, if you transfer over all of the holotapes for The Overseer's Mission and simply go and talk to her, you get a reward of 100 Scrip? After you complete the mission on one character you can drop the tapes afterwards and just keep transferring them.
---
On Xbox?
---
I hope they release more and perhaps I would pay atoms for exclusive radios or something, F1st should have its own too
---
Thanks, some guy tried to offer me 2 1* Dragons for my legacy. Didn‚Äôt think that guy was super low ballin.
---
If he disnt want people trespassing he should have some security, he doesnt even have a fence
---
You create another character and give the stuff from your main character to a friend then switch characters. Get the stuff from your friend then you are good. Or you can use your private server and just drop it and leave and switch characters
---
I gave a player some free loot food, water, plans, etc and he attacked me with a dragon that instantly killed me (idk why I never attacked him) so I spent the next 20-30 minutes killing him over and over again because he would not give up i ended up running out of ammo and had to leave the server to get him to stop
---
No these gameplay functions shouldn't be gated. It should be just normal things. Destiny 2 does all this and more.
---
Oh great, now you're training them... Hit players, get loot. /s
---
Screen shot?
---
Make a new character then get a friend to take thing then switch to the mule and have them give you those items
---
No point. If the devs haven't decided to implement these obvious things now why would they ever.
---
I'm surprised you and your infinite knowledge of EXP grind dont know already
---
Oooooohhhh now I look dumb lol thought there was a way to access one characters camp or something
---
I'm pretty sure you can just log into your Bethesda account and change it
---
Got you thought there was some way through the camp or something
---
Nah your fine, some things aren‚Äôt really straight forward
---
I think it created a placeholder account bc I‚Äôve tried that
---
It literally could just be some random quest lines. Nothing major just something new.
---
I don't know for me I can just log in and change my name anytime
---
The ash piles don't seem to mess with spawns at events, just at fixed location spawns.
---
And then they put so much effort in the shop but there so many weapons that just don't have any skin. Like wtf
---
That is more or less already happening as so few people are getting ore.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been reading stuff on the Bethesda support page and haven‚Äôt really found much pertaining to the problem
---
I don't know if you figured it out in the end, but you need to give yourself access to the folder by doing the following; go into folder options, click on the Security tab, then click on Advanced at the bottom, and then you need to change the owner to yourself (whether that's administrators or your own username).
---
Ah. Right.
---
I‚Äôve heard about you... you‚Äôre that toxic gamer that I‚Äôve been hearing about. It‚Äôs a shame someone like you ruins the community for everyone else. I love seeing how nice the community is to one another and hearing about the stories of you makes me sad. So Pathetic
---
If you can be stealthy, the Ninja perk under Agility is a great damage multiplier.
---
Tbh I've never did the objective and ONLY go for kills.
---
They seem to have been dropped out of the legendary loot pool. Still have an Instigating on one of my characters.
---
Yeah first thing i do is run and grab ore while my team runs defense and when i finish my run down all 4 tunnels i go to defense and the next guy runs down the tunnel. When we have a large group of randoms my whole team will go down the tunnels
---
I just noticed that doesn‚Äôt work with PA, must have missed that
---
What is the SMART machine?
---
Someone sold theirs to the Watoga robot and I bought mine for like 39 caps.
---
You get all SS items no matter who you choose. As for Gauss weapons, the shotgun you can only get with Settlers max rep.
---
Because they havent thought if a way to monetize it yet
---
I must say I pretty much agree. I hit ally with the raiders first for the gauss minigun. That is awesome. Despite the ammo issue/s. The pistol was a let down. And I hit ally with the settlers about a month ago, and yes, I‚Äôm disappointed with the gauss shotgun as well. With the perks, it actually does crazy damage. But? Lack of mods, enemy health rubber banding... kinda lackluster.
---
Uh damn now I don‚Äôt know because I wanted the shotgun the most. Do you have an idea if there‚Äôs a spreadsheet or anything that shows me all the rewards of both sides?
---
I use a Guass shotgun but i have a bloodied shotgun build. I do about 2600 dam at 10% health. I think its pretty good with the right perks. Are you building for max shotgun dam?
---
People have already figured out that farming the ghouls instead of the ore will always pay out better in terms of loot, XP and legendaries. Especially true with SCORE points being earned if you can farm enough xp. I enjoy the event but if you want people to play it in the spirit it was intended Beth will need to add more unique loot drops to encourage completion instead of farming.
---
I care. This is top tier. This could be a chapter in a community made Wasteland Survival Guide. You‚Äôre a modern day Moira.
---
I'd kill for an ally to do that.  I played Borderlands 3 and I absolutely enjoyed how Maya the Siren was reviving me during the Story Missions when I get in FFYL.
---
I ignore dailies and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm broke. They‚Äôre just so mind numbingly tedious. I only got 8k caps and I don‚Äôt really love spending them on fast travel. I‚Äôm literally the guy who will join all of the teams and find the person closest to my target destination to get a cheaper fast travel.
---
You can do both sides it will just take longer to get the rep for the one you dont side with up. 
---
Here's a link for the rewards; https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.gamerevolution.com/guides/647967-fallout-76-reputation-levels-faction-rewards%3famp
---
I've soloed her twice, absolutely got the killing blow both times and no joy on the challenge unlocking.
---
That‚Äôs just cringe i would if left u for dead and took ur junk
---
If they are removing weapons from the legendary pool, can I stop getting 3 star motherfucking shovels please?
---
It sucks, i spent months but i finally got my gauss shotgun. Keep hanging in there buddy, it'll happen!
---
Are you having the same issue?
---
if your doing it alone in a private world make sure to use a world container (cigarette machine, locker etc) train stations work best. solo move can have issues so be smart and safe don't move rare stuff without some help.
---
That Event, I swear.  I prefer getting the Ore.  Killing Ghouls just feels repetitive and I like being fast.
---
Find yourself a piece of armor with 15% less while blocking effect. &amp; have fun melting things.
---
If you like 76, you should check out the FO4 soundtrack in game on FO4.
---
Do you have any other agility perks equipped? You can only use 9 total agility if you have 9.
---
Could just put on a piece of blocking armor and get a gauss shotgun with the right legendary effects ;)
---
This isn't 7 days to die
---
I stumbled upon my Benet in the ash heap. It was confusing!
---
We chatted for a moment and then he went home. I have to wonder if some test code made it to prod again.
---
Not being logged in is speculation. I‚Äôve heard everything from log in 10 mins later to an hour later and I‚Äôve heard of those not working either. I‚Äôve heard stay at the menu for a couple minutes before joining a world. I personally had the game crash at launch and when I logged in and waited at the menu it auto completed half my dailies. This was 5+ hours after they changed and I I finally got home from work. There‚Äôs no proven method of not getting it but there‚Äôs some correlating issues that might lead to them. The first week it was live I watched the dailies change and I was fine. It‚Äôs something deeper than just log in later or do this to prevent it. It‚Äôs just fucked up and they don‚Äôt know why so it‚Äôs unlikely we know.
---
People are downvoting you because they refuse to accept their inferiority to MODUS
---
Maybe I'm thinking of the beta or a different quest, but yeah it's pretty sad one of the best rewards is in a low level event. Not saying they should get rid of it, but definitely need to make higher level events more worthwhile.
---
If you see any Raiders fighting creatures and help them, you get Rep as well.  But I could be wrong.
---
I'm gonna do that next time we get it two days in a row, but right now I'd rather get more unlocks for NW
---
I saw one the other day when i was trying to get crits for the weekly and i was mad i couldn't vats it, i murdered it horribly
---
I dunno I still prefer good old Andale, the greatest town in Virginia.
---
Where did I make that claim exactly?
---
Double Barrel it‚Äôs where is at üëåüèæ
---
Ive seen it, and what spawns in said safe is completely random but only specific items
---
Agree. Not practical but fun. I've got a TSE I pull out just to have fun
---
And I'm doing that without double xp anything.  I'm getting roughly 20 levels per 90 mins at level 580 and counting.  That's when the private server dies the 20 mins to restart
---
Sounds cool.
---
You dont have to, it's clear you're the expert
---
Private servers reset after about 5minutes iirc
---
This is not a mmo...
---
- I wouldn't take Lock and Load if I'm already getting the Speed Demon mutation
---
- They are both not needed in my opinion since Fusion Cores are not hard to get and you don't NEED to carry more than 4 at the time but if you MUST have one I would swap out Power User for Batteries Included since that would allow you to carry so many Fusion Cores at once. 
---
- Unless you are using explosive grenades or such Demolition Expert it's not worth it for a weapon we're talkin about a 12% damage increase with a level five Demolition Expert that's not worth it.
---
- Marathoner doesn't work with Power Armor
---
- Unless you are fighting a Scorchbeast Queen or Wendigo Colossus One Gun Army is not needed so get rid of it or swap it out for something else.
---
Im such crap at PVP i feel sorry for anyone I actually do kill. I won a match the other night and felt compelled to shoot the heart emote. I think the other player was the last of a 4 man team. I think his other 2 team mates were taken out by the scorchbeast. While I am essentially a  bush wookie (I play solo), I like to play more of a "be sneaky" bush wookie rather than a "hide in the bush and hope" one.  I had been using a natural furrow in the ground to crouch in and the grass as an additional screen so even though I was technically out in the open his line of sight would not have allowed him to see me. So I waited for him to come to me and he ran straight past me and I opened fire figuring id go out guns blazing. I actually downed him then the fire closed in moments after and he died and I "won". Didnt go how I expected but its probably the only time ill ever win lol
---
Thank you for the advice and link, it‚Äôs much appreciated!
---
So if I do both missions for both settlers and raiders I can get to max rep for both and get both of their rewards before I betray one of them? Is there a special technique to it or do I just play the quests for both factions?
---
And one last question, can you buy or get the gauss weapons through other players or do you exclusively have to get them from the factions and the only way to use them is through crafting them yourself?
---
Do you have / know somebody who has the Action Hero? I only started my heavy PA character at the last double XP weekend, haven't seen anyone using or selling the Action Hero (not that I've been really looking), I've just been lucky with purveyor rolls.
---
If you can find an instigating double barrel you'll be on to something.  I'm built for shotguns and mine is a murder stick.
---
Delete the cache for the game.
---
You may have missed my point entirely mate. I am not sure what you mean by expensive? I have a clear path lined up for essentially precomputing a new kind of cover mechanic called blend? I agree as well that it is an abstraction, that is the point of me calling it simulated "appreciation." I am speaking mostly about allowing the computer to react to a procedurally generated instance in a way that makes it feel like it can "see" without the need for placement or bulky processing. So that when it prebakes certain lighting elements, it would also have these blend zones that are an emergent property of the various objects in a scene.
---
Pretttyyyy much. And don't even have to play. 5 mins make the character and load into NW lobby. Walk away from the game get some fresh air. Start a business. Finish a degree. Invest in stocks. Come back and it's done.
---
I do like NW however. Fun mode.
---
Actually they dont.
---
That's a Legacy Weapon so your not going to see anyone put that up on a Vendor your going to have to try trading boards and such to find it.
---
I agree the most aesthetically satisfying town in Virginia
---
Stealth and pistols. My Gauss Pistol kills most mobs with one shot to the head, two for really tough things. I'm not into the damage maxing; 99% of the mobs are easy enough to kill from stealth, even with just a 10mm (I only have one level each in Gunslinger too). There's basically nothing I need or want from any bullion vendor. You can't even wear underarmor with the Stealth Suit (I forgot and bought the SS Underarmor, another disappointment).
---
There‚Äôs a 50% chance for one of two occurrences.
---
1. You become overwhelmed with joy that you are finally beating him.
---
2. You just start bawling and rolling around on the floor thinking about all the time that you lost. The time that you won‚Äôt ever get back. The time that you could have spent with your family, which is an option no longer available. That‚Äôs right. Instead of caring about your wife, and husband, your son, your daughter, you decided to repeatedly murder Super Mutants at West Tek, didn‚Äôt you, you sick freak? You could have had more time with them. You might have been able to prevent Susan from leaving you. But, no. You spent 750 atoms worth of your time getting that sweet, sweet 50 gold bullion event reward. Because that‚Äôs what mattered to you.
---
So basically nothing, really
---
‚Äúyou wouldn‚Äôt believe me if I told you‚Äù
---
I am a higher level and I join basic events just for XP or legendary run dailies. If I see a high level player one shotting legendaries when there are wee little levels there, I message them first to ask why they didn't let the little guys get a shot. Sometimes it was an accident, which I get. Sometimes their response is just rude, so I nuke their camps :)
---
Anytime, my friend. You can do the missions for both sides up until the point where it says "break into vault 79 with (Settlers or Raiders)." 
---
Doing all the possible missions for both sides before choosing will not get you to max rep with either unfortunately. Only to the 4th or 5th tier IIRC. It will take another few weeks or months, depending on how much you play, of grinding the daily missions for each side to gain max rep. 
---
This link will help you reach max rep as fast as possible; https://amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g60hy3/ultimate_way_to_farm_reputation_for_settlers_and/
---
The only way to get Gauss weapons is to buy them from the factions they cannot be traded or sold but can be sold for scrip in legendary machines.
---
If on PS4, feel free to message me. I hunt griefers. Any levels, any "skill"... my build is designed to tick 'em off and tear them down.
---
You've probably got a lot of perks that bump your pistol damage, but none for shotgun, that will make a pretty big difference in the output.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve cleared a lot of junk out. Thanks to you guys! One last question, how do you unmark things for search?
---
Ah, this makes sense. It's all about play style and build and your's unfortunately won't get you that max dam with gauss shotguns but others are right if you get that magic combo of armor and shotgun perks, you'll mely anything.
---
Or magic gauss minigun
---
You okay?
---
Yeah I'm doing alright, but if you got something better...
---
https://i.imgur.com/1CcstKL.jpg
---
Like I said, I've not been looking.  
---
I'm not a min/maxer, so I don't care enough to trade for stuff, was more just wondering if OP has a plan to get the gun since it's "out of stock".   
---
Final Word does well enough for my needs and doesn't involve trading.
---
Relax, it is a game. Your self imposed "role" means nothing
---
Cork is going to suck.
---
I have a theory though that Bethesda will be adding to the pile too to ensure the total is reached. They wont want the new cosmetics and events to go to waste and it wouldn't look good for them if they fail.
---
One of my faves is hunters long coat with black prospectors hat and patrolman glasses. Looks like some kind of apocalyptic preacher.
---
Gave my buddy a be laser and it‚Äôs become a real problem,  he‚Äôs an absolute monster xD
---
Nope, not it.
---
He's killed all the other ones. The SBQ is the only one hasn't gotten credit for, despite killing her 20 times per the OP's count. That's a known bug; it's happened to a lot of us.
---
I have a buddy that has a lvl 28 character with sentinel assassin armor and a level 25 JE handmade.  He routinely smacks down level 100s.  It usually done to troll or in the cases, out of boredom and frustration.
---
Oh, nothing new then. Like I said just guess. Makes more sense now.
---
Yeah. It is a game. I play an equalizer. It's not a matter of not being relaxed. I used to be a "greifer/raider". Then I saw how it negatively affected other people's playing experience. So now, if people need help, I offer it. Doesn't go deeper than that.
---
Tru
---
Ah. Yes. Moira in fo3 was an example of in-your-face silliness that fits with the world
---
That reminds me! 
---
You *SHOULD* be able to craft double with the super duper perk card.
---
The PvP in this game is so broken
---
I have one on my first character since I played way back then. It‚Äôs pretty good without being built for heavies so I imagine it‚Äôll be amazing on someone built for it
---
Random NPCs pan for gold, there are two spawn points in the river beside Poseidon Energy
---
Go explore more. The map is four times as large as FO4. 
---
And the lore is there. It‚Äôs just not spoonfed to you.
---
If you say so chief
---
See. You dont need me to tell you about the other ultracite veins, you're pleased as pie with this one.
---
I noticed the same with One Gun Army. It's most useful if you use it right when it becomes available, before you can just destriy everything. But once I started doing real damage I got better use out of Can Do in that slot.
---
I have returned from the grave 107 days after this comment was made to say:
---
oof
---
Yeah it sucks when nobody else does. I keep at least 40 radaway on me at all times for this event. Sucks when you're the only person doing it. If everyone took turns we could all hand it in just before the timer runs down and get the rewards.
---
A big map doesn't mean shit if it has just a tid bit of content here and there, and what's wrong with expanding the map? Are you getting offended by my post?
---
I pretty much only eat corn soup and drink purified water when the corn soup isn't enough.  I was building a bathroom at my camp to the other day and it crossed my mind that my player must really put a hurting on that particular facility having a diet of only corn.
---
I'm literally the only person collecting ore every time. I've seen level 400+'s just sit there cus they want to farm the spawn points. Its so boring.
---
I would love to but you kinda gotta be level 50 to use a hazmat suit and I‚Äôm sadly only 41. So I can hardly kill the guys let alone collect the ores
---
My Bloodied Character simply cannot collect ore   - removing armour and replacing it with a stealth suit means they are immediately over encumbered, so I protect one end and farm XP.  For this reason I can appreciate why some people don‚Äôt/can‚Äôt.
---
However I have four other characters that are more than capable of collecting ore, as such I do just that.
---
If you‚Äôre a Power Armour character or character capable of collecting just do your bit for a minute and the event is golden for everyone.
---
That‚Äôs where you‚Äôre wrong
---
#i require the coop
---
Again, not a say-so. Just how I have been for a while. Sometimes we just need to look out or help others. Tough concept for some to grasp, but the world would be a better place if people watched out for others. Just sayin'.
---
Damn
---
I feel like I'm the only one to collect ore. It's good XP but some of us want the Rad Barrel plan already...
---
Im dead?
---
Hey, If you can show me how to loot 2+ safes a second I'd be down to farm that. &gt;_&gt;
---
Oddly enough, I‚Äôm having excellent performance out of my Gauss Shotguns.
---
yeah, I'm just killing ghouls because every day I have to kill 3 legendaries and the events are the best way to get them, but also people kill them so fast you may miss them
---
Anyway, my post was simply a suggestion to have some sub stations in charleston as exp farming areas similar to the burrows, which was added 2 years ago.  Try not to stray from the subject
---
Oh I never said the time frame to do it! Haha
---
I just have to restart the game a few times to fix the issue.... thought it was only me at first. If you're on PC try launching the game through Big Picture Mode.
---
Had a level 20 shoot me point blank with a bolt action rifle, I pulled out a fat man and aimed at the ground, game over bitches
---
I had to throw a heart emote just now at the girl I got teamed up with because she totally carried me thru the last circle. I was able to help a bit, but I‚Äôm not nearly as good as she is. Funnily enough,  she‚Äôs the same girl who killed me last night, but I can‚Äôt be mad at pure skills. She runs around in painted scout armor and no under armor and just slays. I was impressed and grateful as hell. Our team even won, thanks to the kickass practically nude but armored girl! 2 thumbs up!
---
Or molerats that never surface. Or surface here for a split second and there for a split second and back.
---
"Demolition  Expert"  increases the damage, it actually has an explosive effect that doesn't seem to be mentioned when you look at the stats.
---
When I used to be heavy into raiding, I actually had 2 girls role playing as Mistresses of Mystery come to try and bring justice. They weren't all that successful, but I actually really loved how they stayed in character the whole time. Ended up rewarding them and actually thanking them for the effort they put in overall.
---
I figured having both would take my reload time to near instant but if it‚Äôs not worth it with the mutation that‚Äôll give me some more wiggle room. Bear Arms might be better so I can bring around more heavy weapons, especially ones that use different ammo
---
Doesn‚Äôt Power User expand to laser miniguns effectively doubling their ammo though? That and the PA was the main reason I took that over Batteries Included. 
---
I grabbed Demolition Expert since on my main it‚Äôs been good with my explosive prefix weapons. What would you recommend instead?
---
Yea, someone else pointed that out earlier I just haven‚Äôt updated it. 
---
It‚Äôs recommended in every build I‚Äôve seen, what would you recommend instead for general gameplay?
---
I put it up today as well and was immediately hit with disappointment. Thankfully we're not too far off from the chicken coop, the next weekly ones could probably get to that point!
---
That‚Äôs on them. They should‚Äôve put it on a weapon wall rack and then used letters for the legendary effects and level
---
Perhaps it's an upcoming thing.
---
Lucky... I‚Äôm always stuck on about 30
---
I dont know what's up with workshops on the map.
---
Yeah, I expect it'd be a bit of a beast.
---
People have already posted about this... twice
---
Honestly, screw the ghouls. I‚Äôd rather just gather ore. Half the time, you can just run right past them to get it without being bothered, too. If I see a legendary, I may stop and get a hit or 2, but then I just keep running for ore and turret repairs. I‚Äôll let everyone else do the shooty work.
---
I remember using it a lot until I started building more towards rifles. The trouble will be moving it with someone trustworthy
---
Make an underground base.
---
OK what would you call it?
---
Lol gauss shotgun go pew boom
---
https://youtu.be/JlOrsjzpDAI
---
Stray from the subject?  You‚Äôre the one that said there was a lack of content and lore. And that‚Äôs exactly what I addressed. 
---
The Burrows was not added two years ago. Fallout 76 isn‚Äôt even two years ago. The Burrows has been around for just over a year. And other content has been added since then as well. 
---
I‚Äôm not disagreeing that more content would be good. I‚Äôm disagreeing with your opinion that there is a lack of content and lore in the game right now, and now I‚Äôm disagreeing with your statement regarding how long ago The Burrows canoe out. 
---
Stick to your main point of ‚Äòlet‚Äôs see some new content, that would be great!‚Äô instead of trying to support your position with faulty or flawed information.
---
If it's just another ultracite vein its probably not going to be any better than this.  https://i.imgur.com/4V8d8jx.jpg
---
It was a glitch on all platforms that has supposedly been fixed in Patch 20.
---
It's only a sudden influx if you're new to the game... pretty sure exploits have been a thing since beta. Although now because they unbanned the dupers...  people have the green light to do whatever they want.
---
Angry turtle put out a video, they are reworking the legendary perk cards.
---
I wear that but with a black cowboy hat. Way cooler.
---
Good point. I'll remake the post
---
Duped weapons are worth more than caps.
---
I respect your ability to accept constructive criticism. That‚Äôs a rare trait these days.
---
Iron fist like mentioned.
---
Looks like you're going for low hp? If so, get a bloodied version of your DCG, or of a power fist.
---
You'll also want Unyielding armor. Each piece gives 3 Strength when you're in Nerd Rage, and Strength is +5% damage per point for unarmed/melee. Unyielding/ Ap Refresh/ Cavalier (Reduce damage taken while sprinting) is your best armor, but that's expensive. Just Unyielding whatever is fine to start, you'll just be leaning on Serendipity a lot.
---
Lol you mad over a hacked outfit?! Fucking foodie.
---
Ride of the Valkries is kind of epic to go killing things to!
---
Same with Wouldn't it be nice.
---
Don't bother with Aqua Boy, power armor reduces rad intake to negligable levels. If you aren't going to be using gatling lasers, Power User isn't worth a whole lot- I always run a Fusion Core surplus just from events/world finds (this does depend somewhat on your jetpack/VATS/melee Power Attack usage, though; all of those rip through Core charge).
---
I never found the value in One Gun Army, although as a bloody build stuff dies really fast. For a non-bloodied build, I guess the staggers might be nice?
---
Full Charge also feels "meh", I sprint fairly often and like I said, I run a core surplus. 
---
If you like explosives (as a bloodied build I love them, I'm fully perked for them as well, they actually do damage with my build! 6k Fat Boy!) you may want to pick up Grenadier and max out Demo Expert with moving points away from the perks I mentioned. 
---
I don't even use Gunsmith, but being Bloodied helps VASTLY with that (also using a 50cal as a primary- they have famously high durability). 
---
Other than that fairly solid. I'd recommend at least 1 of those perk points being moved to Adrenaline though- 1star Adrenaline still stacks up to +36% damage after 6 kills; Worth dropping a point from almost anything else for that value (It's currently bugged and doesn't work, but that's supposed to be fixed by next patch; I'd plan for it!). On that same note Tenderizer is 5% on the first star, only 1% for each next star, so you get far more value out of Adrenaline than 3star Tenderizer.
---
If anything, they'll probably add it to the Atom shop as some type of skin.
---
I think he said he uses the Stealth Suit, so he can't if so.
---
Been happening to me and i play on xbox, and whenever i die my game just completely crashes
---
You're the expert, chief. Whatever you say.
---
I hung it in the porta potty... I really like it there the dim light is just enough to create a nice poop spot
---
Me too! Totally! The moment I hang it, it was like "that's it?" ... My husband unlocked it a couple of days ago, today when i told him that i was disappointed about it he told me that when he got the lamp, knowing how much i wanted it he hanged a bunch in a workshop we took. He didn't told me, and i didn't noticed them lol. That's how "meh" they are üòÖ
---
With 500 shots loaded in the barrel! ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Do they still look like workshop icons for you, or are they just blue icons that blend in with everything else?
---
Anyone in a workshop when it is contested even if they do not own it can be attacked. which is why I really do not like that there are some daily quests that can send you in to them.
---
This is what I did outside my restaurant
---
That you, DaGoudaGrizzly?
---
Nope
---
If crippling the ghouls really prevents them from spawning, it's actually understandable. Undermining mob spawn rate is bad for overall xp gain and every 10k xp is score people need to finish the season faster. Many players nowadays can hold one side totally by themselves without any problems (or at least I got "lucky" having all these high levels in my servers. Sharing frags with all these guys who kill ghouls relatively fast is getting tough sometimes) so the "making event harder" is not that much of a problem most of the time.
---
I'd take Final Word (Beckett quest) over Action Hero, generally speaking, although I forget the stats on Action Hero. But AA25 is a very solid mid-tier roll. Two-shot is... worse than AA
---
Mostly blue icons, sometimes not.
---
Stealth that shit. But also if you legit have a bloodied DCG and run Bloodied and have that build.. you should still 1shot everything.
---
Oh you're a different hacker then.
---
Bethesda shoves the Brotherhood too hard. They're a cool faction but they shouldn't even be in Appalachia to begin with.
---
- Well than keep Power User if plan to use Laser Heavy Weapon (I only use Ballistic and Plasma Heavy Guns)
---
- Fusion Cores are not hard to get and your going to keep Power User so I would get rid of Full Charge
---
- I don't know your gameplay style so I have no idea what to recommend for you so how about I show you what I'm currently using and that will give you and idea instead:

Public events get a lot, join either an event or building group (a full event team can give you +100% XP from events and building can give you +4 int which increases your general XP gain), equip Inspirational for +5% XP per rank, sleep in your bed until you get well rested for more an XP boost (I think +15% but I don‚Äôt remember) and don‚Äôt forget to periodically refresh it and don‚Äôt forget about daily quests
---
There‚Äôs plenty of places to farm XP but the only place I can think of off the top of my head is Whitesprings but that‚Äôs too high level.
---
I mean if you get a piece of blocking armor and they never patch the bug, yeah, combat shotty. Much more common ammo, don't worry about charging or weird Gauss VATS glitches.
---
This has happened to other people so I think that it can be replicated. It must have happened because the ally was in the middle saying something to me or  to talk to me when I fast travelled.
---
Make a false locked door and hide your actual locked door behind a wall that only you can remove.
---
Dumb question - but why the blocking armor? Is it because of the explosive effect?
---
Last radiation rumble I did a couple days ago, there were 10 people there. I'm a bloodied build, and was the only one collecting ores. I turned in 90 ores at the last 6 seconds. I burned through craploads of rad-away diluted, every time I got down to 10 - 11% I would pop 1. I have a massive stockpile of rad-away and rad-away diluted. 
---
Still turned in 90 ores tho.
---
I haven‚Äôt done his quest yet so I don‚Äôt know what  Final Word is. I‚Äôve only done the astronaut‚Äôs on my main
---
Doing the raid with a side really just gets you a rep boost and unique outfit with them. That's basically the only difference.
---
I'm currently rocking a mountain scout + glowing skeleton mask combo.
---
Um, the comment you're replying to clearly states that I only have one level of each Gunslinger perk and that I'm not worried about maxing damage output. I've also made it clear that the lack of a silencer, poor ammo capacity, and  longer reload make it shitty.
---
Surgical mask, Medical Goggles, Science Scribe outfit.
---
There‚Äôs a building glitch to put floor decor items on shelves that aren‚Äôt camp displays if that‚Äôs what you mean. But it‚Äôs not junk. Junk itself can be placed in displays though. 2 different things.
---
Same. I farm so many stimpaks and purified water off events and material runs. I need to get rid of things faster.
---
If you think so.  https://i.imgur.com/j0ULRL7.jpg
---
You know it!
---
I did this at parties for years because I always wanted to throw a Fallout themed party and figured they'd come in handy!
---
It's not odd and this comment adds nothing to the conversation. I should expect as much from Enclave.
---
Can't really help you as my likings probably won't suit you, but take a look in here for yourself and you may find something you like!
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Fallout_76_outfits
---
Meow?
---
Same for the pistol. Which has a silencer, and a much larger magazine.
---
They never can handle them sadly, they just kill them and then cannot handle the waves and we end up needing to come back and fight and heal the 4 guys.
---
AA fast fire 250dr reload 50cal
---
You still eat the rads gathering.  Rad-X + RadAway after is good for about 300 gathered though... I typically just do it in bulk then boil it all.
---
How does blocking help? You can't block with a shotgun.
---
Not a lot of variety and the ring of fire cover is horrible. Other than that it‚Äôs pretty good.
---
It‚Äôs odd compared to your experience. And perhaps you should look for someone else to start a fight a with?
---
I enjoy the brotherhood as a faction I just feel like they‚Äôre over romanticized and that they pay more attention to the brotherhood than any other faction
---
What platform you play in? You should be able to link said platform to your Bethesda account (Not ingame, ina web browser) and then you should be able to change your ingame name. At least, in my case with Steam it worked that way.
---
It‚Äôs a magic effect,  it makes certain weapons do insane damage.
---
It doesn‚Äôt help with blocking - it just makes your damage in vats unreal.
---
No problem
---
That's what I mean, yeah. The faction is cool but BGS tries so hard to pull reasons to include them out of their ass.
---
Everytime I ask Sofia to join me on an 'adventure', she says 'not tonight' and uses the headache excuse.....
---
i‚Äôm not 100% but as amazing as this would be i fear its not possible due to stuff like music licensing :( would be so fun tho
---
This must be how I saw someone else's Sofia at a SBQ fight a few weeks ago.
---
B2515 Fixer, BE90 Railway Rifle.
---
Aqua Boy is a core perk for me but if PA makes it unnecessary I‚Äôll swap it out. I don‚Äôt plan on specifically using Gatling lasers but to have one just in case, guess I‚Äôll scrap that for batteries included. 
---
OGA is in pretty much every heavy/PA build I‚Äôve seen so I stuck with it but thanks to someone else I‚Äôm going with Luck of the Draw instead when I‚Äôm not doing an endgame event. 
---
I just know I run a lot and it can take a toll on fusion cores. What would you recommend instead?
---
I mostly like the prefix, I forget I have grenades half the time. 
---
I have a low rank Gunsmith on my main and maybe it‚Äôs because I mostly use a TSE Lever Action Rifle but I noticed a difference pretty quickly. But I do plan on tossing over my Action Hero so maybe I won‚Äôt need it beyond modding
---
I did put on a Rank 2 Adrenaline and Rank 1 Gun Fu since Marathoner doesn‚Äôt work with PA
---
I‚Äôm on pc. I‚Äôll try that. I have tried in the past and I just get an error message
---
I don't. Still looking for a legendary anything deathclaw, I have the worst luck at the Rusty Pick.
---
Oh that does sound nice. When I got the alien blaster I was expecting a rifle or something from him, not a 50 cal
---
I'm already one-shotting most mobs with the pistol. Why is everyone so obsessed building their whole character around doing way too much damage anyway? It's like using nukes on mosquitos. I'd rather have some flexibility and access to QOL perks without having to switch out cards every time I want to do something other than "melt" mobs.
---
Oh I see, thank you.
---
Of us of servers. There is no cross play
---
what platform?
---
There is a special tea kettle, with a different name. Name of the model or something, I used to display it.
---
I'd say at least follow the main quests until you get to the Mire, so you can do the Wastelanders quests up to the point where you get access to Crater.   
---
You'll then have both Raider and Settler daily quests which grant reputation boosts in addition to the usual rewards. (rep grind is best started ASAP IMO)   
---
If you spend all your time in a public building team you'll get bonus to XP for having higher INT while you're doing low level quests.   
---
Up in the north of the Forest there's a farm called Aaronholt homestead where you can get cranberries to make Carnberry Cobbler, for more XP boosts. One if the only places I can think of where cranberries are available outside the Cranberry Bog.   
---
IMO marginally better quest rewards aren't worth putting off the main quests for so long.
---
Lvl 250 could be able to send caps to another character maybe?
---
I play through my steam game and my sons play with me on game pass on PC. So guessing pc servers if downloaded on PC.
---
I super appreciate what you‚Äôre doing. I‚Äôm still newish, I‚Äôve had the game since it came out. I wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan of when it was first released so it kind of grew dust while I just kept plinking away at fallout 4. The new stuff they‚Äôve been doing brought me back. I‚Äôm only a level 38 right now and I‚Äôve definitely had issues with higher level assholes coming by to just piss me off. Or trash my camp if I turn down team invites? It‚Äôs kind of frustrating. 
---
But luckily on the other hand, met a bunch of really nice higher level players who have spawned wherever I am just to wave and drop me off some seriously wicked loot bags to help me out. I really loved that and I‚Äôd never witnessed that in game play before. So now I try to save the decent lower level weapons I find so if I see anyone who can use it, I just leave them a little loot bag with some rad away, food and some Stimpacks. Bit of ammo.
---
If you‚Äôre one-shorting everything with your Gauss Pistol, and the Gauss Shotgun only has a ‚Äòlittle more damage‚Äô, then why are you complaining?
---
I do NW all the time and never had this happen either. I just never log straight into NW, always adventure first then back to menu before NW.
---
Absolutely. They have potential to be some of the best new personas introduced lore wise, but sadly they're relegated to half assed Cult of Atom types at the moment. I really want something more substantial from them.
---
I feel ya. My water and food is free for anyone to take. Also though my ammo printer isnt free. In low on all sorts of ammo and need it
---
I keep it with a lvl 3 lock. And even then its behind 2 level 3 locked doors in case someone really wants it
---
submit a bug to bethesda, got me stumped
---
I escorted my ally back to CAMP when this happened. She did run all the way back, and had some epic battles along the way.
---
The thing with workshops right now is plenty irritating. I haven't seen much talk about it, either. Sometimes they're visible on the map, sometimes they're not, or if they are visible, they don't display if anyone owns it. Such a pita to travel to one to find it was taken already. I'm not really interested in contesting people's stuff.
---
The Enclave Urban Scout mask looks great and protects against airborne hazards.
---
This is great help my man, thank you so much I really appreciate it!
---
Good to know, thank you!
---
I thought the fireman outfit was from the main quest responders line. Or is that another one?
---
Yeah your a little timid lol
---
Pistols generally suck in this game. Is the issue you're raising that a shotgun must be better than a pistol because reasons? 
---
I think a lot of people like their gauss shot guns and I'm glad pistol builds have something that is somewhat competitive. 
---
Why so upset? Many rifles in fo76 do better at any range even though it makes more sense that a shotgun would do better at short range. Meanwhile, all shotguns have that unparalleled enforcer perk that minces anything with breakable limbs... 
---
So what is the issue? What should be changed and why? Is this about a silencer?
---
My camp is left open to the public as far as doors go. One main building, the store is on a makeshift patio with some nice seating and deco, the craft hall is in a sort of "Longhouse" style building attached to the patio, so everyone can go use the benches. Helps the lower levels out when they don't have much set up at their own camps yet. (I'm in the forest). But if it's locked, and I lock on level 3, I know you're level 40 at least. And you probably don't *need* whatever it is I locked.
---
If you have a use for a million plans for a bathtub go ahead.
---
I think the issue there isn‚Äôt a visible border to indicate that you‚Äôve entered a contested workshop.  
---
Ive wondered this though - as soon as you enter the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù build zone of a contested workshop I guess pvp is on?   Why can‚Äôt someone else even see that aspect 
---
Ive also had a similar issue where I lock picked within a workshop area and got a bounty.  There was no indication I was picklocking a locked crate within a workshop.  Something must glitch out
---
If you dont wanna pay fallout 1st for junk storage, then get any all 5 armor pieces that reduce weight of junk and create a new character then just use a friend to transfer and store all your junk on that character. You can have 5 characters, get armor peices that reduce wepon weight and store like 80 to 100 guns in your mules vendor. Same with ammo. Use your characters.
---
My go-to is BoS Battlecoat, Black Cowboy Hat and Patrolman Sunglasses. Add in the Pathfinder Mask for the Ash Heap as needed.
---
Same here. I love people who love their crafting beches with lvl 3 locks. Like wtf
---
Maybe you're thinking of the Huffwarbler teapot. It's not the white kettle though, but it is still a beautiful cast iron teapot, identical in appearance to the other brownish teapot :).
---
Fallout 4 large co-op
---
Yes, she fast traveled to the overseers house today then ran back to CAMP. I'm trying to figure out what triggers it. Maybe when she's very close to you when you fast travel.
---
OGA is actually bad for the queen fight specifically- she can't currently be crippled, and staggers reset her from landing, so it's worse than not having at all. Not sure about other endgame stuff. I feel like a lot of other big boss types can't be staggered/crippled very easily.
---
Well, if you're feeling like you're burning through cores, by all means use Full Charge. I'm just going by my experience where I run a surplus without using any core-specific perks. But if you aren't using it, maybe Blocker for extra tankiness? 
---
Grenadier will still help a bit with the prefix, it does increase the AoE range. Your call if that's worth 2 points though.
---
TSE is like... quadruple Durability loss, lol. TS doubles durability loss(1 for each shot), and Explosive causes durability loss for each target hit (your round hits your target, but the explosive AoE hits 3 more around it? Your gun just took 4 durability "hits").
---
Good call on Marathoner, although I'm not sure I'd take Gun Fun. VATS and heavy weapons don't play well together (they use a ton of AP and can't be modded down) and VATS rips through core charge too. There's not a ton of good Agi perks for a PA/HW build; I'd either dump more in Adrenaline or pick up, like, Born Survivor (as a full health build. Bad on a bloodied build! ;).
---
Thanks for letting me know üòä
---
I hardly use it anyway, unless I'm in a bad spot. And again, it's not about a little more damage. It about speed and stealth. It's totally useless for a stealth build because it doesn't have a silencer. The Gauss Rifle has one. The Combat Shotgun has one. Why doesn't it have one. The whole bullion market is total crap for me. I don't even care about the ammo machine you get from the raiders because I have more ammo and mats to make it than I'll ever use. I've gotten more cool stuff from the Legendary Run.
---
No we need him to stay awake forever so he can take up our slack for donations!
---
if your a general you‚Äôve completed the quest, it‚Äôs a bug
---
Well, you got unlucky with those guys then I guess. I personally prefer to hold one side by my own, one stealth explosive flamer is more than enough to oneshot the entire spawns. It's getting harder to keep things polite if several people try to land shots beforehand.
---
Do do what the other guy said and do every quest up TO the raid, for both sides, though.
---
No problem, if you need any other advice, tips or whatever hmu. I've been doing nothing but this game since covid lockdown began lol
---
Honestly I... I didn't even know you COULD lock benches. Why... Why would you?? That's just a waste of lock materials. They can't do anything harmful with them.
---
Will do!
---
same whoever said not to do the quests is stupid once you hit 50 it‚Äôs basically perk card building at your own leasure
---
I'm going through the same thing with thorn armor. And you can only craft 1 per day. 30 pieces and haven't gotten 1 useable piece yet. All the same limb.
---
That's kind of how the Scorched and Scorched creatures are now, isn't it?
---
So your complaint is that the Gauss Shotgun doesn‚Äôt have a suppressor?  And therefore it‚Äôs not useful for a Stealth Build?
---
this happened on pc yesterday, today it‚Äôs fine
---
Thanks for the generous offer man!
---
But yeah I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm annoying you with my questions but I have a last one, I‚Äôve read something on the website you sent that said doing raider missions hurt your settlers rep but it doesn‚Äôt happen the other way around. Does this mean I should do the settler quests first then do raiders or it doesn‚Äôt matter?
---
I heard that it might require creating a new character(s) to complete these atom challenges that seem glitched.  I'm going to test it soon, as I have a good 5-6 challenges that glitched like this on my first character - like discovering Abandoned Bog Town - done it, registered blue icon, etc. but challenge doesn't count it.  Kill a firefly hundreds of times already, still says I have to do it.  Completed events, says I haven't done it yet.....
---
Yeah that was a REALLY dumb move on their part.
---
Put it on a weapon display with that sign. Don't put it in your vendor! I've got 120k caps stuffed away on mules, PLUS spending money on all my main characters. A high-end gun in a vendor for 30k? That's sold.
---
I thought the staffer would make her land. Maybe that‚Äôs why it seems rare for her to actually come down. 
---
I had it before the TSE nerf and just stuck with it since I typically have awful luck getting good legendaries. 
---
I honestly just picked Gun Fu because I wasn‚Äôt sure what else to take. I‚Äôm not a Min/maxer by nature
---
Is the way to be. The game has shifted towards more community and less griefing. I used to be a greifer/raider because the mindset was to do to others before they did to you. I actually love helping other players. It is much more rewarding. Just seems that some need to click the safety on so they dont get so triggered LOL. But I love hearing about others helping people out.
---
I told them I'd go kill the cannibals for them. I did. Then I ate the cannibals right in front of them. :)
---
High intelligence helps with XP. Grinding the main mission helps, but if you're not up for that, grab some low level workshops (Tyler County dirt track, sunshine meadows farm, Charleston dump) . If someone launches a nuke, and begins Scorched Earth, go ahead and take part; just tag a few enemies, and keep a low profile. Public teams help. If you have friends, see if they'll be willing to share some supplies (perhaps look on Discord). If you're on PC, my name is Gramps76, I can get you a shielded vault suit, and cranberry relish; just give me a few minutes. The mid twenties gets really grindy and boring, which is why I take advantage of XP events to level up new toons.
---
As far as your build goes, take it to [nukesdragons.com](https://nukesdragons.com). Plug in the perks you want, it'll spit out a road map, and if anyone has suggestions, just know that you've got a roadmap and that's good enough.
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree with you more!
---
When going unarmed, make sure you have both Talons and Twisted Muscles mutations. With both of these you get a massive 50% extra damage with unarmed weapons (70% extra with Strange in Numbers).
---
Im not being argumentative, but have your personally got them or have a source, because I have done it 30 times and I just get junk scrip. I know the wiki says otherwise but that's out dated. Any help would be appreciated.
---
It's a lot about a silencer. As I said in another comment: the Gauss Rifle and Pistol have a silencer, as does the Combat Shotgun, so why not the Gauss Shotgun. Before I got the Gauss Pistol I carried around a silenced Combat Shotgun for when I for mobbed, so I figured the Gauss Shotgun would be some major next-level shit. To find out it was only slightly better than the Gauss Pistol and didn't have a silencer totally ruined it for me. I'm not even complaining about wasted bullion because there's literally nothing in any of the shops I want to buy.
---
Pretty much, yeah. If she starts to land, but gets staggered in the air... it resets her animation and she stops landing.
---
exactly if your pc your on a pc server
---
Sometimes they lock benches. Sometimes they lock all their bucnehs inside a building. So you cant go inside and do anything
---
How do you blueprint a lootable safe? That alone sounds like an exploit
---
Lol, you online?
---
add this mod (PC only obviously) to replace the classic music channel with awesome fallout style songs and product ads :)
---
 [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/423](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/423)
---
it's not exactly an exploit because it's damn near impossible to deliberately reproduce. It's just a bug.
---
Well... I unlock things I need. If I can unlock it by lockpicking it, it means I can use it. Your bed looks soft, man. You can kill me, but... What a bed. 
---
What. A. Bed.
---
it‚Äôs a bug which needs to be fixed
---
Dang that sucks. Fighting flying enemies is such a pain
---
i stealth hide , charge weapons and await any potential visitors
---
Yup. You'll get the reload of the first gun applied to the second gun, up to the max ammo you have for the second gun. I had a missile launcher with 23 rounds once; all the missiles I had at the time.
---
Okay. Thats fair. I do not have a gauss shotgun but perhaps you can answer this: does the gauss shotgun perform a lot better at longer ranges compared to pump and combat shotgun?
---
I heard it does; and i suspect that is one consideration of why they chose not to have a silencer. Maybe I heard incorrectly about its performance at longer range though.
---
My main is a rifle build and that dang gauss rifle is still as unusable as ever (compared to say, a lever), unfortunately, silencer or no :(
---
Sounds about right.
---
Workshop PVP feels like a remnant of the old PVP system and they should either rework it or just remove it entirely
---
Thank you! I‚Äôll make sure to use this for my next material grind season. If I can add something, the monorail station has a ton of concrete bags that you can grab, and lead weights.
---
bloodied HW build baby ;) I delete scorchbeasts in literal seconds
---
A bit late but you'll have to find an item when crafting or modding things. For example, I want to unmark "wood" from my items to search for so I could go into cooking, view a food item(literally any of them since they all require wood) and click to unmark or specifically "tag for search" twice. In my case(ps4), I'd press R3.
---
I just don't even understand that.
---
I've always just assumed it was a beta character bug, huh. Well it's okay, it's not as bad as leveling up two characters to level 100 just to have your trophy NOT pop up. Cant even get all the trophies on this game because of a bug.
---
Eh, Scrip always has a place in my wallet.
---
Lol it‚Äôs unfortunate that nothing comes even close to bloodied builds. It just has so much synergy and even its own mutation
---
Same thing for me and 4 were completed already. First time it happened and I'm done. This season is a complete joke with broken rewards. I'm logging off until winter when hopefully they add real content. At least I got to rank 69, which is nice. Kinda wanted that backpack and space suit PA skin but I'm sure they'll be in the atomic shop in a few months but in a different color. This game is too shallow and broken right now. Time to go play something with substance and quality.
---
Same exact situation happened for me, logged in saw 5 challenges. Switched servers then saw 9, and some challenges were completed without score. I wonder what causes this...
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 too, I did this with wood but, the telescope logo is still there on junk I see that has wood
---
Mostly, yeah. But I would also expect it to be significantly more powerful than it's pistol counterpart. Normal shogun to pistol damages variance is usually much larger. The Gauss Pistol is semi-auto, like the 10mm; if your 10mm does 25 damage and your Combat Shotgun does 80 that's a much bigger difference than your Gauss Pistol doing 200 and your Gauss Shotgun doing 260.
---
I figured, guess I'll submit a ticket if I can
---
I dont recall having my settler rep decrease by doing raider missions, however I didn't actually pay attention to it. My guess is if it does, it's by such a minuscule amount it probably doesnt matter much. 
---
When i was doing the main story questline for the factions i switched back and forth, one settler, one raider, one settler etc. Ultimately choosing raiders. (Like and idiot, I too wanted the gauss shotty lol) Even by choosing the raiders and doing both missions at the same time, i finished max rep for both factions within a week of each other. Hope this helps. In a "just in case" scenario, yes, do the raiders first and then settlers and, in my advice, choose the settlers. The guass shotgun is miles ahead of the ammo machine which only gives you like 150-200 rounds per day as opposed to a really dope shotgun.
---
If you do the quests to the point of no return for both you can get the suit plans for free from the settlers, maybe that's how?
---
Slow down, enjoy the game for what it is now, not later. Leveling up is important but also learning how all the mechanics work and interact with each other.
---
Stay out of Watoga until you are a higher lever, for now stay on the left side of the map, do leader of the pack whenever possible and experiment with weapons. Get your hands on a lever action rifle, mod some armour the game is about to get tougher-concentrate on the now.
---
I can't really speak to the range as I hardly used it.
---
Yeah.  I read another comment essentially saying that.  I dont get why everyone doesn't do this.
---
Guided Meditation can have a suprising amount of legendary ghouls. My record is 5 legendaries from it!
---
Uranium Fever always has 3 legendaries, but they cap at level 35/40, so they aren't "endgame" (still, a good level 35/40 legendary beats a bad level 45/50 legendary)
---
The brahmin-herding event always has at least 1 level 50-80 sheepsquatch, sometimes too.
---
AWOL armaments (NOT a public event; gotta watch for it!) always has 1 level 50+ gutsy, sometimes another one, very rarely several extra.
---
Monster Mash (NOT public) has a ton of ghouls but so far I haven't seen many legendaries out of it.
---
Otherwise the usual location farming like Westek, Whitesprings, The Burrows.
---
Its not about respawns its about ash and goo piles blocking access to 3-5 meat piles because they cant be cleared away when emptied, i have to forfeit half my scrap when people use that at line in the sand.
---
I hate that the first almost always messes ü•¥
---
After looting a glittered corpse, your character gets a mutation where you leave a glitter trail whenever you walk.
---
So I stopped at a random garage sale today and bought a chain mail coif. I asked why they had it and why they were selling it... Apparently the couple had a monty python themed wedding at a castle in Tennessee... And a castle in Tennessee sounds about as Monty Python as it gets. They even had groomsmen with coconut horses.
---
I am a raider, not a British officer. Do you want me to warn you by sending a PM too?
---
Literally never had this happen until today.  I took the gorge junkyard workshop for the challenge, as my camp is very close to it.  I then went back to do the defense event when it popped.  It's important to note that I give zero fucks about keeping the workshop and only took it for the challenge.   Some bastard one shot me shortly after I arrived to the event.  I just changed servers cuz fuck that guy.   
---
I won't be doing the events in them anymore cuz that's just straight up bullshit.
---
Just completed the event with about 7 people, not a single ore was collected. Granted I‚Äôm responsible too for no ore being collected, but I can‚Äôt equip a rad suit because I‚Äôll immediately become over encumbered, so it falls on everyone else to collect ore
---
Lol, my base now actually is full proof. I have 2 level 3 locked doors in the back to get in. And if need be I can close my front garage door and I technically super face from everything.
---
Is it the one from the Raider Waster bundle?  
---
I haven't seen the one you're referring to, but i know that this one is an outfit that looks like Raider armor.
---
For me just depends on how fast the enemy is moving
---
Doesn't seem like this would be popular. I made the same suggestion and got [downvoted for it](/r/fo76/comments/hz6wl9/radiation_rumble_rage/fzh772c/).
---
I agree that's what needs to happen though.
---
Clicking "R3" twice should've removed it. With the first time adding the icon to any other items you don't have and the second to remove all of them. If that's not working then I'm not too sure what might be going on. Has it been happening every session you've played?
---
Gunslinger(s) aren't the only perks, but that's still 30%.  Plus sneak attack damage, and possibly other things going on that the shotgun doesn't benefit from.  
---
If you took those points, and put them into perks that bumped up the shotgun's damage, spread, range, and explosive damage (yes, Gauss shotguns benefit from boosting explosive damage), you'd see a world of difference.  If you don't...you won't.
---
I've seen Gauss shotties used to great effect by people that perk for them.  If you don't do that, you won't see a huge benefit.  Just like if I, who is 100% commando, started using a pistol without changing anything, it would *suck*.  If I need to swap to a different gun, I swap out perk cards (though I have a lot of extra cards available, which you may not have yet).
---
You'd see the same issues if you switched to the Gauss minigun, or any other class of weapons that you're not spec'd for.  They won't perform as well as what you're set up for.
---
Instigating gauss shotgun is definitely not a let down, the only things I cant one shot is the sbq and wc
---
Good for you. Keep on zapping those thieving douche bags.
---
PC
---
In my opinion the game runs shitty because of the engine, but hey, more powerful consoles will let us have at least 10 more frames when fighting the scorchbeast queen
---
I just untagged it and haven‚Äôt switched sessions yet, I‚Äôll have to try and see.
---
Repair kits don't work on it? I've never gotten one to test it.
---
Bloodied is generaly run stealthy because of the low health situation. Much easier to manage if you aren't getting attacked!
---
But if you aren't running stealthy, than I'd definetly do things like pick up Blocker and White Knight. Blocker because the big hits that will actually kill you will all be melee hits, and white knight because you'll be taking a ton more armor damage and will want the longer-lasting armor you get from it.
---
Absolutely try to get your hands on at least one piece of poison resist armor; as a bloodied build, poison will be the thing that kills you 90% of the time if you don't. 1 is generally enough but 2 doesn't hurt; my dream setup is 3 Powered pieces and 2 PR pieces; but that's assuming full Secret Service where I innately have crazy DR/ER/RR just from the armor. Don't ignore RR, especially as a bloodied build! Worst case use a Lead Lined backpack for that 90 rad resist (that's what I do on my full-health Junkies build using Solar Armor since it has zero innate Rad Resist). But you don't need a ton; at least 50 is generally plenty, but more never hurts. You're never going to survive a nuke zone without CSA/PA anyway; you just need enough for random rad barrels and glowing ghouls.
---
I haven‚Äôt tried switching sessions yet. Probably just a little bug
---
I carry only one type of food. Cranberry Relish...
---
can you get online now? IGN Tazier
---
Does the Observant Radstag have any unique lines if you use the Vox syringer on it?
---
Yeah, I took a look at the two wiki's and crunched the numbers. If you are going for an Armco ammo to only generate as a 'currency' for the Legendary Run ammo converter, it depends on how often you go back to the Armco to dump it.
---
At 0.96hrs to generate a full container, 5.56 has the biggest return at 500 AmmoPoints for each full container.
---
The next best would be at 3hrs for a full container, .44 gives you 800 AmmoPoints for each full container (dropping it to \~266.67 AmmoPoints/hr).
---
Granted, it makes far more sense to have it generating ammo that you will actually use to kill things, but I was wondering if there was a way to use the two devices to trade for ammo I wanted (also, there is a lot that the Armco can't make but can be converted w/ AmmoPoints).
---

I accidentally ended up bugging out the encounter.  I figured out what was going to happen and after getting into the bed and seeing the pips show up on the radar I got up expecting a fight and... because I got up so fast all the cannibals bugged out and never went hostile.  I just opened the door to the room and there were some friendly cannibals walking around pretending nothing had happened.  Still shot everyone in the head though.
---
Will try this today for the cause üòÇ
---
And what about people like me who have never once even started NW? I got hit by the bug today after four consecutive attempts to find a server that I could place my camp in. 4 challenges auto completed. I'm logging off until winter, this game is too shallow and broken. I'm done wasting time in a mobile game where most of the new content is cosmetics to play dolly dress up and home decorator.
---
If I remember correctly its opening was a big public event celebrating the tricentennial.  So it was made for publicity purposes as well as its normal function, unlike other vaults built in hidden and/or remote locations.
---
But the trailer showed someone in a vault suit doing it, which implied that we could do it.
---
.... 
---
"We should be able to make our own loading screen slideshows "
---
"I am too lazy to go through and delete these so please don‚Äôt suggest this"
---
Does not compute. 
---
Either you have the ambition to make your own slideshow, or you are too lazy to. Pick one.
---
Sent you a request
---
Argh, that‚Äôs it lol means I can‚Äôt get it. Bet the raider vending machine is in that bundle too...
---
I'd imagine we would see more of them for sale if they are truly lootable today. Would love to see a source or hear first hand experience too!
---
do you mean from the outside, how it kinda looks like the vault-tec logo? i imagine it's cuz they made it to celebrate the american tricentennial, so it was like the "example" vault. unlike other vaults that were either hidden in caves or under buildings, or were just  slapped into a wall, this one had a major event ariund it.
---
Once they fix the ammo machine where you can convert ammo in bulk, I'll go for that. 
---
As is, I don't even use it due the the rate of ammo conversion. I can craft ammo more efficiently than that crap.
---
No it isn't üò≠  
---
It has the Raider Salute emote though.  
---
And I can also tell you that the raider vending machine isn't in the Raider Scabber bundle either. I have both, and no vending machine üòî
---
Or a big metal rod. Or your bare hands. Or a shovel. Or a drill. Jason has always been equal opportunity when it comes to murder weapons.
---
Ok tank yoy
---
Reply with your IGN, social menu usually bugs for me
---
if you're flush with ammo and kinda agile, the ghouls at whitesprings can be cheesed fairly well.  
---
kite them into the bots after taking a few pop shots or take advantage of the landscape and cheese them on your own.
---
if you go the bot route, the ghouls won't always forget you and go for the bots, so make sure you keep moving and be sure to hit them and only them a few times for a solid tag.  an enemy you didn't do damage to is an enemy you will get no xp for.  NO EXPLOSIVES and if you're mutated any damage causing mutations WILL aggro the bots if they proc.
---
boring for sure, but good for the days you wanna just check out and half play the game while watching youtube or something.
---
one of the best spots for that imo is right at the clubhouse, near where the fast travel drops you, there's a flowerbed that is outside the windows into the second story dining room/kitchen.  if you aggro the ghouls, you can hit them through the windows, they can't get you, and if they start doing that stupid fleeing npcs do, you can get closer to the windows to draw them back.  just step back before they actually get to you.

I really find the people who immediately downvote anything PVP to be so annoying. You literally don‚Äôt lose much in the game‚Äôs current state, or ever for that fact. People are way too nice and soft in this game that‚Äôs meant to simulate a nuclear wasteland.
---
I remember one time I did scorched earth, one asshat decided to put their camp just north drop site V9. I didn't mind the missile turrets they had on their roof, them just standing up there like a tent. What got me was the fact that they decided that they needed to lock a bunch of benchs and stash behind 2 level 3 doors. Like, why would you do that? It's not like anything can be stolen or such.(I found out it was 2 level 3 doors but photo-glitching through lol)
---
Can someone explain the reference lol
---
Hopefully it includes the ability to romance a mothman companion.
---
How many times did you talk to him? I've had lucky mucker specifically bug a few times, but after talking to him like 6 times, he finally moved on to the next dialog
---
I'm level 84, but my Strynger hits for about 6 damage.
---
I‚Äôd argue the Quad Tesla is the most fucked up weapon to use. Sure the Junkie‚Äôs Gat Plasma shreds and all, but the Tesla is an aimbot.
---
I would already think that was a feature. Eat dog food, then get an empty can. Drink a beer get a empty glass bottle, etc.
---
What‚Äôs the mountain scout? Is that one of the rare jumpsuits?
---
it has happened to me a few times. I just ignore it.
---
Sorry, what do you mean by IGN?
---
Hey, 10 more frames would triple the frames im getting rn lol
---
I think you are correct good sir.
---
Same thing I meant when I said ‚ÄúIGN Tazier‚Äù :) In Game Name
---
Of course it's possible, it being possible was never the issue.
---
How crowded does an event like the SBQ get when everyone on the server shows up?  Now double that thanks to everyone bringing a companion along.
---
Other reasons?  Bethesda wants us to interact with other human players, that's why this is a multiplayer online game and that's why they push stuff like public events and public teams.  Give people an npc that follows them around helping out and that's one less reason to team up with an actual player.
---
Watoga high school terminal that lets u change halloween candy for things
---
Oh lol, I was thinking something else, it's librious
---
I'm always looking for camp plans!
---
Miscellaneous terminals in the WS bunker. It's not all spelled out explicitly, and you have to put it together a bit.
---
Aren‚Äôt those a rare drop from the savage divide events? I‚Äôve never even seen one and I‚Äôve been playing for a while
---
I believe the outfit you are talking about is the raider under armor. It is called Harness and the plan is sold from the raider train station vendor bots. If you only want the harness itself it is for sale at the Whitespring raider vendor.

Santiago didn't launch a coup, she was unconscious when her people revolted and rescued her.   The enclave collapsed before pretty much every other faction in appalachia, except the remnants of the "real" government in Charleston.

All sorts of this on Xbox today. I got ctd's 3 times in a row on 3 different servers when 2 3rd's the way done with powering Poseidon. I decided not to play anymore for the day. GL!
---
Probably just replaced his camp module so everything was stored. Not sure why they'd do that
---
Dude, the osmosis kit is amazing, it's a medical scanner, intrusion module, scrambler, multiscope, portable power pack, water cooled bone saw, AND an osmosis kit, all in one.  In fact it's so amazing that when Ward sees you have one he just hands you caps and scrip and doesn't even take it.
---
It's a special premier vault, they had a big celebration and event for it. It's plain as day not hidden at all so they would have wanted it to look special
---
Thanks, I really appreciate it!! Always nice to find some helpful players like you.
---
 What would you need cork for? could of just hit me up if you on pc. I have well over 250k of the cork from playing the last year and a half. never really use it and the few times I do I need 3 or 4 pieces. Cork, charcoal, bone, leather, cloth, I have so much of its ridiculou. Now steel, plastic, and lead I can barely keep 3000 of each at once since I go through it so fast.
---
This is what I do. But I also make sure both of my characters are at the same spot on the map before I drop my gear so there‚Äôs no fast travel bugs
---
Simp
---
He has a bunch of assaultrons.  I don't know if it's really explained why he's so passive until you show up, but he didn't need to be.  He could have been pumping out bots at Bot Stops without you.
---
I‚Äôd actually argue a BFFR or JFFR Tesla rifle with the larger mag size glitch is more fucked up. If I got a gat plas (that‚Äôs a 500 round mag, right), and I did a glitch I won‚Äôt outline here, I am able to get a 500 round Tesla mag. That results in 500 rounds of BFFR/JFFR hell for the poor bastard down below. Even at 15 round capacity it‚Äôs still more lethal than the QFFRFR if you‚Äôre ‚Äúgood‚Äù at Tesla PvP. Although it‚Äôs a question of who runs out of aid first.
---
Here‚Äôs the list of items the SMART Machine pulls from, directly from the files. Looks like it does indeed include the Ripper and Dragon still. [Nukacrypt link](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/001CCDA8)
---
Glad to help ;) DCG and PF are pretty comparable; power fist has a tiny bit of armor penetration which makes it just a hair better. Instigating DCG for most enemies; Bloodied PF for bosses that will survive a hit!
---
these are some of my faves, my apologies for the atom shop inclusions.
---
red dress, glasses, devil horns  
---
ratty skirt, glasses, any not janky looking fedora, don't remember what color i used  
---
king grognak, bog wanderer mask (you can call me mrs. humongous)  
---
hunters long coat, pink heart eyepatch, general's hat  
---
witch's dress (or civil war dress), plague doctor mask, witch's hat  
---
enclave officer's uniform, rusty raider skull gas mask  
---
full suit of metal armor with the splattered paint  
---
asylum worker dress with the skull mask, the bone one, not the gas mask or the costume one  
---
straight jacket and fastnacht nose guy mask  
---
ritual bindings (or pastor's vestments) and ritual mask.
---
Gauss shotgun by far the most enjoyable weapon i have used. The gauss pistol is honestly a letdown for me with my pistol build characters. 
---
 Gauss shotgun help me destroy so many of my enemies. Especially with enforcer perk that cripple enemies. Demolition expert and all the shotgunner perk. Skeet shooter and  scattershot is also nessecary perk to make it better. For me the shotgun better than the shitty pistol.
---
If pistols get some improvements I would be so down with this
---
I'd be okay with them just tagging along. And I agree with the SBQ, maybe they can make it so if you join an event the companion has to fast travel back to your camp? However I can see that not working out well, considering how Bethesda is
---
And requires 1000 Halloween candy in exchange for the legendary. So, it will take a few runs of Monster Mash to earn a single legendary and unless you‚Äôre farming the school for plastic, and the ghouls for drugs and claim tickets, this might not be worth your time.
---
This was earlier today
---
Cool!! Just need to level up a few times to get the cards that people recommended and I'm set. :))
---
That was funny! Tell another one!
---
Lol, love it!
---
This happened to me a few days ago. I was claiming a workshop, and my gun went off accidentally and I shot a person instead of a mongrel lol. Totally wasn‚Äôt my intention. Weird thing is I don‚Äôt think they realized what happened either cause they kept helping me. But the wanted thing never went away. I finally got shot and thanked the person who did it lol.
---
Skyrim guards.
---
i feel like there should be the freedom to do this on a private server.  have it as a an extra option.
---
adventure mode, private server allies, private server, and nuclear winter.
---
at the very least on a private server they should allow us to have more than one ally item built in our camps.
---
What really helped me break a plateau were the Ally quests. Multiple, menial jobs but they allowed me to gain some much needed levels for more dangerous areas. 
---
Whitespring ghouls used to own me, now they are just a nuisance. The grinding pays off.
---
Yup. Next upgrades to hunt for for weapons would be a bloodied swing speed version of either, and for maximum first-hit damage an instigating 40% power attack version of either ;)
---
I happened across a tree stump with some caps (I think in the neighbourhood of 60) and a decent pistol and ammo, and I thought ‚Äúthere‚Äôs probably heaps of these over the wasteland that I‚Äôll never even find‚Äù but knowing there‚Äôs an albino radstag that will take me there; makes sense. I‚Äôm keen to find the observant Radstag myself!
---
Either water purifiers or a mass selling or unused chems
---
Sometimes I think a lot of these low level attackers are little kids just trying to do what they think they are suppose to do.
---
Got hit today for the first time.  4 of the 9 weren't even listed.  I thought there was only 5 things today until I logged out and back in and saw 4 were completed.
---
Bethesda needs a fire extinguisher for their dumpster fire of a game.
---
Not sure if it's related to what you linked but I watched a YouTube video (can't remember who it was, rifle gaming maybe?) but there was (is) a way to glitch into it, and out there there's a little shack with a tinker workbench, and another area with some buildings and even a caps stash. It's up in the north east corner
---
To answer your question. Yes the range on this is more better than the other shotgun in game. Even have a scope mod to increase the range to farther. And if using vats you can hit thing pretty far. As for suppressor it shouldn't be nessecary for this gun. As for this weapon kinda destroy when having a proper build and legendary. I have a instigating one and I can shoot far. So it really worth the grind.
---
got a link?
---
I would rather stand with the people to protect them and shoot things, thank you very much.
---
Yeah I jump on an instrument.
---
And it sounds more like you're being rapidly punched than shot.
---
I usually run uranium fever as many times as it pops up and sell everything I get of the mole miners to the whitesprings station vendor. Or I run riding shotgun a few times and sell all the loot from the blood eagles to the bot at the station on the other side if the tunnel
---
I care, good work wastelanders.
---
Purified water, marine tactical helmets, and later on, mutation serums.
---
Brain bombs gives me +8 int (with the herbivore mutation and stranger in numbers)
---
Not in NW, they are a absolutely hilarious weapon in that mode.
---
Important factor in this is unyielding builds as switching to PA/Chinese Stealth(or Hazmat) is annoying as hell; which, being able to transfer items to another character under your username would fix. Alas, stash restrictions are a FO1st advertisement, although, I‚Äôm sure members are overflowing in ammo, plans, and legendaries as well.
---
Yup that's the one!
---
Does everyone know there is a 24/7 yt channel that plays the music that we hear from all the fallout games and more?
---
I got griefed pretty hard yesterday and I'm a lower level player.  A level 373 followed me around blowing up my kills so I couldn't loot them.  Just did it to do it.  I switched servers to not deal with it and he followed me.  I blocked him and switched again.  
---
No idea what his problem was.  I was just a lowlu 30 something leveled player trying to do events.
---
Dammit there goes 50 bucks.
---
White springs golf outfits and asylum outfits/ straight jackets.
---
I have the marine armor helmet.
---
A lot of bloodied builds don't have the rad resistance to do it or it's just too big an inconvenience (Just saying)
---
Oh, that one was a little lower. Starting to slip :(
---
Wish they hadn't nerfed removing rads by dying.
---
I tried this and keeping rads off before starched genes is too much of a pain in the butt.  I was fairly lucky on what I picked up and lost as I used radaway, but overall I think getting a magic shotgun early is much better as is excavator armor at 20 and a gatling laser as early as possible.
---
Add Robot Workshop from Automatron to Atom Shop and sell robot plans in the Atom Shop and add plans as Rare drops for Hard Events.  So the Impostor Sheepsquatch Assaultron would be available as a rare reward from The Encryptid, but it requires the Assaultron plan from the Atom Shop.
---
Fellow noob as well always looking for new friends to play with!
---
100% agree! the last few times I was able to actually catch it with somebody else besides me and my husband playing, everybody would just shoot stuff. They weren't actually protecting the scavengers. I think if you're going to just spend the event shooting things at least do the job right &amp; protect those scavengers! (so those of us running around for the ore aren't losing out when the event ends because they all died)
---
John Brown ruled
---
Please bring me more pistols for my bow/pistol build.
---
Selling unused chems, or cooked meat (such as wolf ribs, radtoad eggs, etc)
---
They can't be given away/stored in a world object to transfer/sold, no.  Any character on your account can craft a cosmetic or CAMP item that you've unlocked in the atom store though.
---
They should update everything to be a real threat. Whenever you get good enough guns the game becomes easy and kind of boring
---
I would very much like the Moth Men cult to take over the Palace of the Winding Path. It seems perfect for them to take over and use as a base.
---
NW for PvP.  Unyielding for PvE.
---
Tbh, there's only some quests that I would hold off on but I would recommend not worrying too much and going ahead with the story. 
---
1. High int. of course means more xp so if there isn't an "building" public group available, go ahead and make one. 
---
2. Go to sleep now and then at a camp or such. You should get the "well rested" buff which is a nice increase in xp as well. 
---
3. Whenever the "feeding the people" event comes up, do that event to get "canned meat stew" which gives you an additional 10%.(I suggest this since it's easier for you to get than other food-xp items).
---
4. If you have plenty of charisma, inspirational is another nice perk to add.
---
5. Do events and carry around something with a high rate of fire and lots of ammo. I've noticed more people doing events so even if you can't kill anything, you can at least tag a ton of them which can easily net you lots of xp.
---
6. Whitesprings can be a nice spot to farm but I've noticed ghoul levels can fluctuate. If no one has been around in a bit, they'll typically be around your level. Otherwise, there's a good chance they'll spawn in at level 62. As a sneaky sniper, it is possible to go through most of the place and pick them off as certain buildings have the ghouls "sleeping".(don't forget that you can shoot through some windows)
---
At the risk of being downvoted... I'm not really a fan of them lifting entire assests/uniques from FO4 and dumping them in this game, particularly when it doesn't make sense lore-wise.
---
They did that with the Cryolator, which had specific lore written about it, how it was developed and created within vault 111, and that only one was ever created.  
---
But somehow inexplicably there a many of these things flying about in Appalachia 185 years earlier, sporting the exact same design and appearance.
---
That said, having a FO76 Deliverer probably wouldn't be quite so egregious as that. But personally I'd prefer something a bit more generic, like [this](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/.45_Auto_pistol).
---
They probably advertised it differently than that, because there's no way they can back that up. Maybe it *allows* all games to reach consistent 120fps, but games like this definitely won't. Even with a high-end PC, you might get it running at ~100 in most areas and then dip down below 40 in others. The engine is too old, the game is too broken, the servers are too messy, the entire thing is too inefficient to reach consistent 120
---
Since you‚Äôre solo, definitely use an instigating weapon most of the time. If you‚Äôre at a queen fight or a group of enemies already damaged, use a junkies weapon.
---
Just have the companion disappear when in a full team or entering certain Event areas.  There are numerous MMOs that have companions and players team up for various reasons.  An actual teammate is usually better than having an AI companion.
---
If Bethesda wanted us to interact with other human players, then why have they not implemented a chat system for those players with voice chat and given us private worlds?  For all I care, players are just npcs with varying levels of AI.
---
Ultracite lasers are already better than regular lasers, albeit not by much. I don't think we'll see any balance changes until One Wasteland, and honestly, I'm a bit terrified. The last couple of updates were chock-full of pretty significant bugs, and I'm scared to think of what Bethesda's army of clown college rejects will break this time.
---
I'd like to see a BoS Recon suit and hood, like Fo3. Give it rad resist so it can compete with the stealth suit (without the invis).   
---
Also, bring back the Tesla Cannon and give it scopes. It'd be nice to have a heavy weapon to fill the "sniper" role. Like a REALLY big AMR. (Missile launchers are explosives, so I don't count them)
---
Oh yo cool
---
Yes its a shame this community is full of crybabies üòÇ i miss when fallout was for adults. But hey each to their own.
---
Remember the Super Mutant Overlords? Those Tanking sum'bitches with Missile Launchers, Gatling Lasers, and Tribeam Lazer Rifles! They were a challenge and a true foe in Fallout 3. You couldn't one shot them, not even with a Double-barrel sneak to the face.
---
WE NEED OVERLORDS BACK!!!
---
Less Ghillie suits.....
---
Bulk oil is a decent venture; it's pretty common to find, and sells for a good rate
---
I was thinking something similar. A direct replacement for the bloody mess perk card. Same damage buffs, but confetti instead of gore.
---
I encountered a Cultist the other day firing a .50 cal weapon. It was so refreshing to encounter an enemy using a different weapon to the norm. Sadly they seem to use the same AI as the Scorched.
---
Agreed. Mr. Messanger needs a bit of tweeking in my opinion. Such a long event for such little payout. The death blossoms event is another one I don't like because most of the time you're waiting around with nothing to do. Dog wood die off is lame, and project beanstalk is just kinda meh. I don't like the ones that feel like you're waiting around for rewards you can literally collect in the time it takes you to do the event.
---
They are using a program called Erectus. This "multi tool" gives them all the hacks. It is stupid how easy it is for people to hack. The need to really have an anti cheat measure in.
---
As far as the username, you are not able to change that using the normal means. I had to submit a support ticket asking them to please change it - which they did. They were actually very nice about it.
---
I saw an NPC panning for gold along the river running towards Flatwoods.
---
I think they may have completely used up their supply of ghilli items but I shall inform them nonetheless
---
Dang.
---
The absolute easiest way (though late game) is to craft three serums and sell them to a robot/NPC.
---
Go ahead kill me. You won't get your ammo back. :)
---
Also good luck. I will just run around in my stealth suit. I enjoy the hunt.
---
There's not much of a wildlife in the wilderness. Sure there are wolves, radstags, yaoguais, molerats, squirrels, beavers and opossums. But mostly I see only radstags if anything.
---
There could be bit more variety and definately much more spawns of them in the empty wilderness.
---
Where are West Virginias bobcats, cougars, hares, coyotes, all birds, snakes, turtles etc
---
I think I can only craft one serum, do they sell for 500 each for robots?
---
Are you sure ultracite laser rifles/pistols are better than normal ones? Cos from what I've seen normal lasers are much more desirable on trading markets. People treat the ultracite versions like the plague lol.
---
Well, when wastelanders released I believe I was around level 37 and now I'm level 98. Took a little break at a time cause it was too much of a grind but I've been playing quite a bit with the score system and grinding out events like scorched earth and the events that give a buff (guided meditation and path to enlightenment) and I don't do many quests. I'd say that probably only 10 or 15 levels were from quests cause I was never too interested in doing them but I'd suggest doing them so more of the game gets unlocked.
---
I've got an instigating dragon. Love this thing.
---
You are a hero, please know that.
---
I disagree, they still could add:
---
* Ghillie Power armor sets
---
* Ghillie CAMP decorations and crafting stations
---
* Ghillie Stim packs and other aid items
---
* Chillie playable race
---
Cultists blades from what, Monster Mash? Are they 1* only too?
---
Less armor skins (or at least consolidate them and dont spread out for filler) and more outfits and skins for lootbags/backpacks. And if they have to give us filler, more lunchboxes and perk packs over ingame currencies.
---
I'd recommend setting up shop at whitesprings. Large water purifiers and a fusion reactor is pretty cheap and easy to get. With high charisma and hard bargain, you can sell purified water off for 5 caps each. Just east of whitesprings I farm the glowing mole miners at Blackwater mine. They drop plenty of shotguns(and ammo), miner gauntlets, assault rifles, and so on. Just server hop and keep killing and looting. Cook all your glowing meat into glowing meat steaks as it'll double their value and sell for 10\~11 caps each. Since the whitesprings station is right next door, you don't need to worry about fast traveling. Just scoot on over and sell everthing off.
---
(for benches, there's 2 cooking stations near the front, a weapons and PA station in the small shed, a chem, tinkerer, and armor in the large building)
---
Yes its a common problem
---
Ghillie bush, its like a bush...but bushier.
---
They're incredibly rare, but they didn't used to I don't think. I have one from way back when, and it goes great with SS armor.
---
IIRC, the original team that started the game was moved to a different project so a new team was having to work on someone else's game. The spaghetti code is pretty rough for sure.
---
Today was my first time getting it. I had been logged out for hours and hours. Wasn't on anywhere near reset time. Still happened.
---
Those showed up for me as auto completed.
---
I wouldn't mind that at all
---
Oof tesla Canon would be dope the closet thing to a heavy sniper that I know of is a good scoped harpoon otherwise
---
westtek. gather every weapon those mutants drop, sell with hard bargain 3.
---
Honestly, the game really needs a .45 pistol. And a .38 of some kind, too. Not just the pipe weapons.   
---
.38 ammo is oddly common considering there's no standard police revolver or anything.  
---
And like you said, stuff like the Deliverer wouldn't be as unreasonable as the Cryolator, since it's just a pre-war gun, not the pet tinkering project of a bored cryo engineer.
---
Yeah, the resources at my camp are infinite anyway, so I don't know why people bother locking anything up.
---
Ya it maxes out at 500 caps a serum
---
I got all of mine just from SBQ fights.
---
Ya I‚Äôve been trying to get one from the savage divide events but I think the drop rate is like 0.1%.
---
Nah, that would take way too long.  Just use the PVP emote.  That's what it's for.
---
Level 123 here am always open to helping new players
---
Am I though?  https://i.imgur.com/KjmAGsj.jpg
---
I was killing those green things and when I headshot them confetti came out
---
Fuck. You.
---
Yea I crash atleast once every other hour. Gets frustrating when I am in the middle of a firefight or if I finally found the beast I have been trying to hunt for the last 5 hours
---
Like to see your math on that .......
---
Everyone knows this dude. Part of the game is handling thieving scoundrels.
---
I don't steal, and I empathize with your situation, I've been there too. But in 300 hours I'd say less than 10 times someone picked my locks. It's part of the wasteland atmosphere and I really don't mind it. It's a rush dealing with those intruders.
---
True.
---
My water and collectron are open
---
I had to move my ammo machine upstairs because some absolute madlad decided to go wanted for 400 5mm xD
---
Once had a level 30 something contest Poseidon energy while I was playing my raider themed bloodied melee, lvl 85+ at the time. Said hell nah, fast traveled there and saw him, gave him a chance to leave, couple awkward minutes of standing around and doing angry face and thumbs down emotes lol.
---
Eventually had to kill him and reclaim cause I needed those fusion cores but this guy would not give up. He just kept dying and rushing me over and over for like 30 minutes. Eventually he killed me once when I got stuck between some pipes on the roof and couldn't move, and he gave up after that. I thinkbhis ego may have been bruised a bit after getting killed repeatedly and just wanted to get one kill in, understandable.
---
Messaged him a while later when I got enough cores that he could take it.
---
Good times.
---
I've got 3 characters over level 50. I think I've only done *Monster Mash* once, by accident. Thanks
---
With hard bargain and grape mentats they sell around 450 each
---
I immediatly store or sell radaway so I can‚Äôt use it .. grape nuka cola or Brahmin milk is all I use to remove rads.. if I die I come back with 30% health which is easy to manage most of the time
---
I built a church in the ash heap outside Charleston fire department. I sell ammo, plans, guns &amp; armor(legendaries), outfits, and serums. Sure it would be a general store but it would also be a hangout. The amount of people that stop by and just chill and sit in for ‚Äúservice‚Äù it‚Äôs ridiculous(I often sit at my pulpit or play piano when I go afk). I also have free water and crops for anyone who stops by that wants it. I just don‚Äôt think putting a broad label on camps would be too useful. I like the idea of changing the camp icons on the map to set it apart but it should be players choice if anything. Maybe add a feature to take a preview picture with photomode of your camp like the event preview screen but that still doesn‚Äôt show all what you‚Äôre offering.
---
It‚Äôs a glitch (so technically bannable but I‚Äôve never seen them bad over it) but if you get the retirement plan quest and are the one to actually kill the raider, go up to rocksy, select Appalachia has a new corpse, after you get rep, immediately leave the conversation. Then talk to her again, select Appalachia has a new corpse, leave the conversation after you get rep. Repeat.
---
What do you mean by using it for donations?
---
Has it been known to be near reset?
---
Today was the first day I was on at about 20 to.
---
I swear some of the disconnects feel like somebody did it on purpose.  
---
Spend 20-30 minutes fixing Thunder Mountain, capture the yard, power the FC spawner, defeat 2 waves of gulpers and -  
---
- disconnected from server
---
My gues is the 4th of july bundle. Or Patriotic bundle is probably the name
---
It‚Äôs probably because you already harvested it already even tho you can still see it unharvested
---
I wonder if this entire event with the brotherhood is a clever scheme in Bethesda‚Äôs part to get people to empty their stashes and scrap boxes to ease the strain on their servers. Not reason but wanted to just put it out there lol
---
I want those lvl 50 shovels. üòâ
---
Lately, I've been visiting the camps with *very few* items. Like 2 weapons and less than 5 plans. In the past month, I've gotten 3 circus trailer plans (for each of my characters and a spare for future trades) 2 safari crocolossus backpack plans, a BE handmade, and a few other really nice legendaries--all from vendors that appeared to have nothing to offer. Some people only sell the rare stuff and dump the other common items in train station luggage.
---
Ultracite plans are harder to come by so unless it‚Äôs fully set up how you want it already good luck doing it yourself. Normal lasers on the other hand go kill some mutants and you‚Äôll get lasers.
---
I start at Camden Park and pick up every single thing, then sell to the vendor there. I run from there to Poseidon Energy Plant and pick up everything there, plus the 2 cap stashes. If I still have caps to earn, I'll run through Pleasant Valley Ski Resort.
---
If you do not want to do the moisture farming method, you can do the more casual method of taking the weapons off your defeated enemies and selling those. With the shopping perk you can get 25 caps a gun in some cases.
---
The people who care will collect, while those that don't care won't collect and just farm xp. Nothing anyone says will change minds on that topic for those are two different goals with the event.
---
For even less traveling after Riding Shotgun, you can just sell things to the merchant you escorted.
---
Lucky Mine with Excavator armor will net you enough lead ore to make around 3500 scrap in about ten minutes once you know where to go.
---
If XBOX, I crash to home or lock up every 2-3 hours of continuous play. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs memory leaking or RAM something, but clearing the cache every couple days seems to reduce the frequency of crashes. FWIW this happens a lot in many Xbox games in my experience. Borderlands 3 was bad about this too.
---
No, they're set prefixes
---
Run Line in the Sand and huff all that loot to Watoga. Or Uranium Fever and huff it across the track to Whitespring station. 
---
Uranium Fever is quickest, but Line in the Sand works if it pops and you are limited on time.
---
had to get a friend to help you for that one, eh?
---
Thanks for the info. I also plan on doing a farming grind and will use your info as a guide to start.
---
If you manage that, hit me up with the crackheads details so I can get one and flip it.
---
I have several friends.  That's how you make it most efficient.  That's why I said the more people the better the xp.  Look at the level compared to earlier.
---
The ambient music next to the water in the forest (try fast travelling to Deathclaw Island) with the secedas and water bugs sounds amazingly realistic. 
---
Considered moving camp there for the sound alone.
---
Mine used to do that with all my perks, would unequip everything and say I didn't have enough but I did.
---
I just want the 45 pistol
---
Yeah no.
---
Wait...if you disconnect while modding it you lose it?
---
The deliverer was just a Walther PP series with a suppressor. I guess it was supposed to be imbued with some James Bondness that made it badass.
---
A 1911 makes sense from a suppressed standpoint, but  we already have several good weapons competing for .45 ammo.
---
Since we already pretend that .45 LC, .45 ACP, and .45-70 are all the cartridge  - can we pretend that .44 mag and .44 spl are the same and have some wunder suppressed pistol that uses .44?
---
I think something modeled after the [.44 Auto Mag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_Mag_Pistol) with an integral suppressor would fit in with Fallout's design aesthetic quite nicely.
---
But I seriously doubt we'll see anything. The gunslingers of fallout seem to be a forgotten class. Even if we were to get a pistol version of The Fixer, it would just be a 10mm pistol with better stats and a paint job. And I shiver to think at what the last quest would be like to get it. "In order to defeat Truckasaurus, at the right moment, 3 of you must place your genitals in these three blenders. Only then will Truckasaurus expose it's stick shift allowing you to defeat it."
---
I did hand off the weapon to my boyfriend to mod it, so I guess it depends on the rollback?
---
Ya the engine is over 20 years old, definitely time for an upgrade, fallout 76 could have actually been a huge success on a new engine
---
This footage was smuggled out of Bethesda  showing the dev‚Äôs hard at work https://youtu.be/QL5_3JIA0Uw

Apparently allies have been showing up at the SBQ and other events.
---
Oh hello there my friend, can you update us on your amazing report to bethesda, is he banned, how did he sabotage the server, imagine if he killed you when you came back to emote that would be hilarious, and it's "punji board" please read things.
---
I know that they will want to have alot of filler. But here are some ideas of other 'filler' options that hopefully would not be too complex to implement:
---
\- A loot box containing random items (similar to what you get after completing an event). This could be a random legendary, it could be a stack of ammo, it could be a stack of chems, etc. This could be a zero weight item until opened (similar to the junk boxes they gave us this run).
---
\- A 24 hour buff that activates the moment you 'claim' the board piece. It does not even have to be a stat buff. It could be something like - you get free fast travel during that time or maybe you get a bonus loot everytime you loot an enemy. Another option is that during the buff, you do not get taxed for any items placed in vendors. 
---
\- Some more utility items such as: A stack of food that does not expire but gives you both food/water but does not weigh anything. 
---
\- More fun random stuff: A temporary item that lets your character glow like an irradiated enemy or an item that changes your idle animation to make it seem like you are drunk. Another option is something that changes the sound of your footsteps into something fun. Maybe an item that lets you temporarily polymorph into a feral ghoul or something.
---
Theres a non canon mod for fallout 4 about the dunwhich company and a quest involved. I cant remember the name it has the dunwhich name in the mod. But i remember it be actually pretty good.
---
In my experience the workshop icon bug happens if you switch servers. If you log in and you can‚Äôt place your camp so you look for a different world. Bugged. If you log in then switch to a friends world. Bugged. Switch servers to grind something or a chance at different loot. Bugged. Private server for a bit then switch to public. You got it, bugged. The fix seems to be logging out and back in. On pc you can exit the game and rejoin back into the same server if you are in a team so long as you don‚Äôt go to main menu and you just exit to desktop. Not sure on consoles.
---
With hard bargain and grape mentats they sell around 450 each.  Unyielding/ high charisma can get more probably
---
This is what i do too. One run thru BW mine, also collect and cook the glowing meat in the shed stove, walk to the station and cash in. If there‚Äôs still some money left, run back to BW shed and make enough marine helmets to cover it and back to the station before the grape ments wear off. When I have enough flux, serums are a quick buck as everyone here has said. 
---
The marine helmet plan took me months to find though. Before that, selling excess purified water and excess stims and drugs helped.
---
I've been paying attention, don't you worry
---
Great!
---
I was not aware of that before. That is fresh, loose dog shit. Fuck, this company is dumb.
---
Today i broke my own fast travel attempts record at 15 tries, by the time I got there the event was over.

Workshops are PvP zones. Have been, will be. If you expect otherwise, it's all on you.
---
The whole map will just become one huge bush.

I read the title "maternal grind" :-D Jesus I'm glad I was wrong
---
Medical Googles and Gas mask are a good combination, when you get to the mire and discover the brotherhood content you can turn in Technical Documents and unlock the Brotherhood outfits, these look pretty decent. Go to the Ranger Station in the Cranberry Bog, you can find some less common headgear there, I think it is the only place to find the flight helmet. Consider looking through what is being sold at the Whitesprings, they have some less common hats there. Do Riding Shotgun to unlock the Blue Mountain Caravan guard outfit, this being a outfit, gasmask and backpack. Experiment with things, find a look that works for you. For a long time I ran around in a Batting helmet, patrolman's sunglasses, veil of secrets, Vault Tech University Jacket and a Nuka Cola Cooler backpack.

This is a rerelease for the bungalow and they knew about the bug after the original release
---
I believe that anything you can buy with gold is not sellable or tradeable, both plans and what you end up crafting.
---
The idea of the Brotherhood is cool, but they're way overplayed at this point.
---
Theres a pretty cool mod for fallout 4.  Its non canon but its pretty well written. Its worth a download if you have fallout 4.

It's sad because I'm not even surprised *sigh*

I got a ton of yellowcake and violent, but only 1 cobalt over however many runs I did during double xp weekend.

Pretty sure I have a few legendary shovels on PS4 if you're serious
---
I've had someone buy a Greatest Plan Ever note from my vending machine for 30k once out of spite. Dontever have something in there you arent willing to sale or lose caps from hitting the cap limit.
---
Why stop there, what about ghillie underarmor?
---
Hoarding simulator
---
That's not a glitch. It's just another aspect of their garbage design.
---
If there's a locked container in a workshop zone and then someone takes it over, it will still look like a regular locked container‚Äînot like one that someone built and then locked.
---
If you‚Äôve got private at the moment with the fact you can still get the group score challenges, taking all the workshops is great. 
---
If you jump in PA with a Gatling laser, take all three fusion generator workshops and then all others, you will (along with slotting in Quick west tek and golf course runs at reset):
---
-Be swimming in scrap
---
- Build score rather quickly by easily farming xp
---
-Get all of the base plans rather quickly 
---
-Get a literal tonne of ammo and aid items from the completion of take and defend quests. 
---
-Have enough ammo generation from the workshops with power user to keep well stocked enough. 
---
What I would say is that as long as you wall off collectors and place scarecrows etc you are generally safe to wait for retake quests.  It it‚Äôs not an exact science and it‚Äôs better to just go straight to defence or risk losing mats to repair collectors. 
---
In honesty my guard tower prefab with 4 missile launchers tends to do the work for me while I afk at the top if I don‚Äôt need the xp
---
If you fast travel to someone (as you can with friends and teammates) then you load in at the nearest Fast Travel point, whether you previously visited/knew i or not.  It's a good way to learn some locations around the map if you have a friend willing to travel for you ... The stations are a good option.
---
yes since yesterday it‚Äôs been reported here, i have experienced it as well, but unless someone files a actual bug bethesda won‚Äôt know it‚Äôs happening
---
I've had high levels constantly bomb me because I was trying to get marine armor plans.
---
Ohio River Adventures has a bucket of golf balls on a rock on the river, with more balls scattered on the rocks. I believe there's 18 in total.
---
I had this happen once, someone picked a locked door at my camp clearly trying to PvP, but there was 3 other people there shopping at my vendors. So he gets wanted and runs outside the perimeter of my camp and I see the other 3 go chasing after him. I follow them about 4 seconds later only to see all 3 of them dead and the wanted guy just standing there. I was on pacifist still so I just waved and went back to my camp.
---
Don't take the bait folks.
---
I wouldn't care, if some greedy lvl700 takes it all and sells it, maybe he needs caps more than I do. Still don't see the problem. There's so much prewar food it's not even worth on holding on to.
---
I'll open a ticket
---
T 65 skins special new weapons maybe?
---
Still looks cool in my camp, I love my backwoods bungalow and the easy side entrance is a plus lol
---
I loveeeee solo-ing RR and keeping all the scavengers alive for the xp kills. * Pew pew noises *
---
 it yet finished uploading
---
Issue here is the daily challenge - level up. Before this thing was in place first thing I did was run and get all the ore I can and then hopefully others do the same while I shoot some ghouls.
---
Now I don't bother about the ore, because I'm level 224 and leveling up daily is not always easy with amount time I have to play. Without Line in the sand I wouldn't manage it half of the days.
---
Sorry, but priorities changed and I don't think a level up daily is a good challenge at all, because you shouldn't level up so fast. It should be only the weekly challenge 3/3 - this would be ok.
---
Yeah, could be, well their problem then, but I'd rather give it away to someone who can use it than scrip it for 3-5 pieces. Someone tell them nobody dupes shitty low lvl 1* stuff xD
---
He‚Äôs level 700. He does not need your handouts. That‚Äôs just pure greed.
---
Do I look like a cat to you?  Am I jumping around all nimbly bimbly?
---
I'm trying to make a military base in a heated area, having gunshots and enemies phase through it was kinda a surprise to me
---
Could be, still not a problem from me. I don't need this stuff either, it's just to share and if somebody takes it, so be it.
---
Even when you *know* that you fired both enough to register AND the killing shot because the SBQ corpse drops on top of you when you FT to Watoga to sell stuff you just scored.
---
If I had that, I'll take less Caps for it.
---
that indeed sucks ass
---
If you're on PS4 I can give you a V/40bash/15 crit minigun to soften the blow
---
I don't mind most of the music, but Camp Granada keeps getting stuck in my head.
---
I have been camped at a pond in the Mire where radtoads spawn. Lvl 40 and mix of glowing, scorched, albino etc ... They give legs, glowing meat, eggs and a variety of junk including nuclear waste. The glowing meat steaks sell for 10 caps, omelette for 8 and the bizarre (although not altogether surprising) one is the legs which sell for 15 caps raw but only 8 caps cooked - at station vendors that is, with Hard Bargain. 
---
So given that they respawn every time someone visits my camps I can if I need to get my 1400 caps daily just from Rastoad bits.
---
Thats what i did. It is super helpful
---
That same mindset should apply to ultracite gatling lasers also however they remain much more desirable than regular gatling lasers?
---
It's a glitch or such. If a tent is placed in a specific spot, it'll cause all of the scorched to spawn there. Simple way to farm tons of xp.
---
(Line in the sand if the video hasn't loaded)
---
this comment is the epitome of this game
---
Run Harper's Ferry and sale the weapons to the vendor on site there. Switch servers and repeat.
---
Hahaha yes, I have one too.
---
Yup, that is where I got it from.
---
Don‚Äôt get me started on the 7 straight 1 Star armor drops from the SBQ before that
---
exactly what am i missing?
---
The way meta works in this game also discounts that idea. If it is better, players would get ultracite regardless of its difficulty to mod?
---
It doesn't help that their support is 99% automated messages and 1% real people who only read half of the ticket. I've never seen Bethesda be so belligerent on any game as much as this
---
This. Was going to say Uranium Fever like others, but make sure you run across the yard when you come out the mine and cook them glowing meat steaks at the stations by the trailer. Running Uranium Fever and selling all the guns and glowing meat steaks with a maxed hard bargain and grape mentats gets me 1400 once a day easy.
---
Its worse than it has ever been before. It took me 9 times today to fast travel. Absolutely insane.
---
Gatling lasers only have a handful of plans vs the 40 or whatever laser pistols/rifles/shotguns/snipers have.
---
If they brought in That Gun, I‚Äôd even willing to give pistol builds a shot.
---
Lol, that's some theory crafting here.
---
Enjoy the game. Use the environment to your advantage. Get up high and away from the enemy and take pot shots. I am sniper build and loving it. Join up teams. Take advantage of the extra XP. Grind some low level events like Mama Dolces, Light house and defend workshops. It is fun when you slow down and enjoy the story.
---
No, it says corn.  He meant corn.
---
Still though in the games meta you could get it modded very easily. All id have to do is put a post out in the trading groups asking for a high karma player to please mod my ultracite laser and it'd be done no problem.
---
I didn‚Äôt even think about enemies just walking through it haha. I like my camps in low traffic areas but I can see how that would be a pain. The thing that bothers me is you can‚Äôt set it on top of a foundation, I wanted to put the Astro turf foundation down so I had a huge lawn with my greenhouse and a few backwoods bungalows on top but it doesn‚Äôt work
---
isn‚Äôt it obvious why they want that much cork?

There is already a "Shared bank" Its called Fallout first, you just need to use the private server it comes with in addition to the unlimited scrap storage. And lets be honest its a lot less glitchy  than any other "Mail box" they could come up with.
---
And now that you realize they already gave you one that you have to pay for monthly, you should realize that your not going to get a free version. 
---
Ever.
---
I'm not trying to be mean to you or Bethesda, I want you to look at how they act and what they do to make money. Realise that anything you ask for they will do it through the filter of "They asked us therefore we can charge them for it.
---
As for the level 50 and whatever reward?
---
seriously?
---
They decided to reward level 50s and so one with "Legendary perks" and given the reward is... a trucking grind fest from hell...its kind of an anti reward at best to be honest. a lot of people have long since blown by level 50, 100, and even 300. and Im not sure I trust any mechanic they put in that retroactively rewards players for putting up with the bugs this long.
---
and lets remember, They already rewarded the long time players with a glitched out helmet that they still have not fixed.
---
And lets be honest their are already a ever growing laundry list of bugs that they have to deal with 
---
They rewarded Score players with that silly (and surprisingly redundant) gilly suit armor and then bugged the crap out of it
---
Never mind the glitches in several other Score rewards. 
---
Never mind it took them over a month to get around to fixing the waterwheel(and giveing us a powered version)
---
they still haven't fixed a number of bugs in Nuclear winter
---
Grab all Line in the sand or Uranium fever drops, then sell all weapons you get, each sell for around 5 - 30 caps.
---
You would think but if you can only get your hands on an ultracite with standard capacitors but can fully upgrade your standard laser to the best it can be what‚Äôs better in damage? It‚Äôs so much work to grind out those plans and for a little bit more damage.
---
If you are on PC Check to see if your drivers are up to date. Check all your specs to make sure they match. Check what sound settings you have on. Sometimes you just need to fiddle with the specs.
---
Too bad most of us don't pay extra rent on a virtual crap box storage rental unit, and aren't going to sub just to get a re-skinned beret.  They need to provide some actual content, fast, or this game is going to tank, big time...
---
'Hey wait a minute! I said 'Pork', not 'Cork'!!!
---
What will we feed the troops now?!'
---
(I bet someone is going to get fired for this mistake...)
---
I think it depends on when you subscribed. I bought my sub through steam and it's charging me one day earlier than it says it will but atoms arrive only the next day. Pretty annoying but I guess it's because of the time difference or something.
---
The brotherhood base is actually just a giant music studio
---
Yikes, that means frantic XP farming will probably get worse.
---
The glowing ones in fallout 4 were a menace, they‚Äôd bring all the ghouls back to life and were actually pretty terrifying
---
Because I really enjoy the basics of the game and hope they fix it.
---
You'd rather enjoy a echo chamber where you and Howard praise the game?
---
The game is beautiful and all the audio (music and ambient sound) is top notch. Easy to forget you aren't in Appalachia. The radio serials are also unparalleled. The voice acting, music and story are all period accurate. BGS outdid themselves in this arena.

Since it is going to be BOS themed, potentially with a fracturing theme, I am hoping for a small vein of Brotherhood Outcast cosmetics. It is probably a longshot, but I have always liked the Outcasts as almost a representation of that part of the player base that will always long for the way things were in the Brotherhood.

Well the Deliverer was a pre-War pistol, Tinker Tom could have found it on one of our bodies after we died (there‚Äôs a vast difference between 2102 and 2287, the 76er will have died of old age by then) and gave it to Tommy Whispers afterwards, unless I missed some of the Deliverer‚Äôs lore.

It‚Äôs possible for one person to turn in enough ore to have the event be completed.  I turned in 30 today and then went back to killing because it only took me about a third of the event time.  But that only counts as 1/4 for the reward scale.  You are probably going to have to work it out with members of your team (public or private) to focus on collecting if you want the 4/4 rewards.
---
The ally was not going to be useful against high level enemies, especially with a basic pistol, but it was fun to cross the map together.
---
The thing is. If they added to a private server. Some 12 year old would datamine and figure out if u stack 3 containers on top of a robot vendors left testicle. Log out. Log in. Place a hammer in the top one. Log out. Log in. Delete the bottom container log out log in. That they can make it soawn in the adventure world. And then blame Bethesda because they left a glitch and it‚Äôs their fault

Plasma caster
---
I declined a couple of low-level legendaries somebody tried to give me on one of my alts only because I felt guilty about taking them from them when I wasn't actually a new player. Maybe sometimes it's that?
---
A skin for the Double Barreled Shotgun.  I love my Double Barreled Shotgun.
---
True true, forgot about that one
---
Bethesda giving the player base a  ‚îå–ü‚îê(‚ñÄÃøƒπÃØ‚ñÄÃø)  one game event at a time.
---
That's what I said :p could be toons
---
Ah, my apologies I didn't understand

Try the free states vendor at Whitesprings. You may need to do some hopping.
---
No problem :)
---
They have! Something with if you fast travel from your camp after talking to them I believe
---
Point invalid. Adding a platform to allow diversification does not necessarily lead to exclusion.         
---
         
---
The game would benefit more from diversification than it would appealing to people who have an ‚Äúeverything build character.‚Äù      
---
       
---
In your provided situation, as a camp owner you would need to choose a label out of what sounds like community farm / hangout / General store.           
---
You would choose based on how you want your guests to treat your camp. Not really a role playing element or anything.
---
On PC I make sure to restart my computer then close everything windows chooses to open before launching the game. Probably my equivalent of what you are doing.
---
So 10mm pistol called "Problem solver"?  
---
I would be down for upgrades to base weapons in the same way the fixer is an upgrade to the combat rifle.
---
Ninja perk huge multiplier. Would probably try to find 3 points for adamantium skelly or iron clad . Get rid of trav pharmacy and replace with the punching perk that I can‚Äôt think what it‚Äôs called lol.......remembered. Iron fist. And bloodied mess on always. Flat damage increase. Aside from that pretty strong. Oh and obviously run 5 pieces of unyielding armour. Preferably with cavalier I believe as a melee as u want the protecting when running in to give them a smack
---
4 different locations, or the same location 4 times?   
---
The actual silo at site Alpha is further south than the entrance elevator. If it kept sending you to the same location it's probably because your friend was closer to that point than the site Alpha entrance. The map tends not to real-time update positions relative to the surface when you're in interiors. It's quite noticable in places like between the hidden cave and Vault 79, because player markers will be shown at one location or the other, as they travel underground, but not in between them.   
---
If it sent you to 4 different locations. That's just odd.
---
While I'm a relatively new player, I've encountered glowing behemoth like 3 times already and I must say that thing moves unexpectedly fast and hits hard. Maybe I'm a shitty build but it was quite a fight, had to run among trees to confuse it, on open space I'd be done. If we could see those monsters a bit more often and together with supermutants then it would be a more challenging fight when you encounter them.
---
If you really want to oneshot the bastards with your gauntlet, you should try to get/buy one with the instigating prefix. I compered the bloodied and instigating gauntlet for stealth atacks and the instigating won. Your enemies are like 99% have a full health and with this effect you had like double dmg and then the perks goes. If you are running a low health build, you can get the adrenal effect mutation, so after the first hit your instigating gauntlet will act like it is bloodied (if you still need to make some extra attacks here). I have like 2500-3500 dmg from sneak to high lvl ghouls, and like 1500-2500 to high lvl supermutants. Deathclaws, all robots, not glowing bears (they need 2-3 hits) dies with one hit. And I am not running with extremely low health, nothing even close to 20% and don't use the nerd rage. However I have a different perks equipped, I guess you might change your build a little to max the dmg. Iron fist, bloody mess, ninja are the must.
---
Yep, who would care about some long-ass event with some junk at the end if it wasn't for the XP?
---
Ooohhhhhh, I *hate* those bastards! I always put a round in their heads from the Deliverer before I take on anything else.
---

---
Is my build. Very similar in concept to what you want. With Public Groups, running grouped is far and away the best bet, so dump Lone Wanderer and get Strange in Numbers (And pick up Herd Mentality and Empath- Empath may or may not be bugged in that the 25/33% damage reduction is applied to the entire group, including yourself, so with zero perks, as long as you're in a group, it's a net neutral effect. With Class Freak reducing it to 12% self damage, and SiN increasing it to 33% reduction, it's a 21% DR gain, and will stack with at least 1 (potentially all 3) other people running Empath. 
---
I run adamantium skeleton because I hate broken limbs. Fireproof is nice vs scorchbeast primarily, but helps against some other things like Anglers. 
---
I also made my build specifically so I'd always be finding Bobbleheads/Magazines, but you can swap those perks for 3star Glow Sight or whatever else you'd want.
---
You take a lot of damage if you're being a brawler, so White Knight feels like a must. Evasive is not so good especially once you get endgame armor- in my full Solar armor, NOT running vanguards (I might have a Mutants or two), I've got 500+ DR/ER which is vastly mroe than you "need" (soft cap is around 350). The big need is Rad Resist, which I get from running a Lead Lined Backpack. If you get Secret Service armor, it will easily meet RR needs; I went for Solar for the HP regen, but Solar SUCKS to craft, and the mod situation is terrible as well.
---
I run a BioComm chest piece; Chems last 7-10 minutes, which is insane with stuff like Psychobuff. I sometimes use Party Boy instead of Suppressor with either Whisky for +6 Str or Vodka for +3str/+75 hp. Carnivore mutation with Strange in Numbers nets you 25% melee damage from glowing meat (and similar) and 5str from Deathclaw/Stingwing meat. Or lots of various stats from the various Scorchbeast meats. 
---
I do feel a bit AP starved sometimes, not having full Actionboy and Marathoner, but if I can finally get some luck and get some Powered Solar pieces, I think that'll be far less of an issue. Lifegiver feels like overkill most of the time as a full health, high Endurance build. 
---
Get yourself a Junkie's Swing Speed Power Fist/DCG for general trash as well as boss mobs, you'll be set.
---
Happened to me a few times. Sounds to me like its related to that bug in Skyrim where if you talk to someone and then immediately fast travel, the person you‚Äôre talking to comes with you.
---
Not really. Seriously they seem to be Little more than free kills.
---
Starting the 1st buillon reward at 100 instead of 25
---
Less perk packs 
---
More functional camp items 
---
No fireworks 
---
Better gun skins
---
That would be nice indeed! Though it's such a good idea they'd rather sell it that include in something where you can get it for free :/
---
Damn I've got an anti armor dragon I had no idea they don't drop as legendaries anymore
---
Can't have bloodied and ghoulslayer together, they're both primary perks.
---
Some skins for heavy weapons would be nice.I like the skins we got in this season, but I don't use most of those weapons they're meant for.
---
We must figure out how to trigger this...
---
I find it funny when is see a bunch of uncooked meat in a vendor that's rotting away. Most meat will double in price if cooked lol
---
First 2 times it took me to Central Mountain Lookout, then I shot up to the top of the map in random wilderness. It's always when I try and fast travel on the player who's Inside of a place it happens.
---
What about Ghillie underwear...
---
Really?  How many?  Do you have figures on how many are rushing to buy the crap atomic clock that was ignored a year ago?  I guess coming out with more varied new items is a bad thing, in schills' opinions...
---
Have you tried putting it on a rug then moving it onto the foundation?
---
Ahhh, that makes sense. Thanks!
---
it's busty, yet natural
---
thank you
---
No broken ass "Old Greg" Ghillie paint.
---
not the perk(s) so much as the repair weapon/armor perk noise
---
This is my only issue with the event. If no one joins, or you only have one or two people show up with you, that's pretty much a wipe from the start. Yeah, you can get some XP out of it, but I'd think the exclusive plan and outfit/hazmat suit are more worthwhile rewards than some extra kills.
---
Sell glowing meat and blood, after some events, for example uranium fever where all the enemies are glowing, I sell the loot and with some perks or food buffs it's pretty profitable, I don't use glowing meat or blood anyway. I also sell chems to normal vendors, because Raiders collectron brings them faster than I can use or sell to other players.
---
Such a shame they are. Oh well. Give me a lvl 50 shovel that's worth swinging. Lol.
---
it just works (emotionless todd face)
---
I'm sitting on about 150 "just in case" but I've never used a single one. Maybe I should just sell them tbh
---
Combine it with Rank 3 White Knight, and you got 2 birds with one stone.
---
Point invalid. I disagree with you invalidating my point. I just don‚Äôt think your idea was fledged out enough. If there was a check box system in place it would work. I do all those things and I don‚Äôt care to specialize in one thing when I can make all those work. It seems your issue is with the game isn‚Äôt specific roles enough for you and you want to file everything into specific lanes. Just let people do as they want and label things as they choose and don‚Äôt limit their choices. Or we could just skip on the labeling camps thing.
---
I'm playing on PC via Steam. It's a more comfortable experience for me. Thanks for the offer though.
---
Wow, I need to do a lot of exploring. Thanks.
---
 CFC
---
Oh nice, I didn't know that! Thanks for the tip
---
I provided a premise for invalidating your point:    
---
Adding a platform to allow diversification does not necessarily lead to exclusion.      
---
           
---
There is no objective reason provided from you other than ‚ÄúI want to give my camp all the labels tho‚Äù
---
Skins for weapons seems pretty popular, I‚Äôll definitely be putting that in.
---
Next pride month we need BOS pride power armor and combat armor skins.
---
If nothing else, I‚Äôd take it as a skin, though a new weapon would be better.
---
But you know what else would be wonderful? More automatic pistol options, and a weapon that can only be an auto pistol.
---
Labels don‚Äôt exist currently and now you‚Äôre trying to put labels on things. It already exists I‚Äôm not saying I want all that I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs organically already everything. It‚Äôs not making it fit in to every label, it‚Äôs the labels don‚Äôt fit what already exists. There‚Äôs no objective reason to inorganically influence how people view your camp.
---
switched a card a little here [buld](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3476ab&amp;d=sf2ss2se2eu0c72ir2la2lu2i42am2a12a00pe2cm2lt2s92sg2ej2aj2l71&amp;w=p10pa0p80p90i12i30ii0ia0i50lb2lm2c62ce0&amp;m=0c2fe8gh&amp;n=OP%20Melee)
---
but still it seems like you can take to points from the luck and drop the scorched gens card (I equip it only when I need to use antirads or when I do the Radioactive rumble, use it instead of bloody mess) and use these points for Agility to have 2* sneak or action boy/girl or to Enfurance to get a fireproof and ironclad or maxes ironclad. Maxed ghoul card can also be handy in nukezone or on rumble event, so you can keep it to equip on purpose.
---
You have never been in a trap camp
---
Get carnivore mutation and eat glowing meat steak Yao guai ribs and mutant hound chops, adds 60% damage right there. I can put out 10k damage with my deathclaw gauntlet( non stealth)
---
I'm on PC or I would haha. Fairly simple though. Check this out:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRYgRHmiMvE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRYgRHmiMvE)
---
At the very least it should have a guarantee three star, this is ridiculous..
---
The rad barrel plan is actually a great reward for bloodied builds (or anyone running Radicool), too. You can just plop a barrel down at your camp, and give yourself an easy 10 rads per use without it coming from a natural uncontrolled source. So, you can more easily calculate exactly when you start gaining more buffs as you gain those rads.
---
I JUST switched over from a PA heavy armor build to a low-health shotgun build, and just knowing I can use that barrel to prep for a fight without removing too much health is really helpful.
---
Yeah, seriously. What on earth do they need that much cork for?
---
In fact, someone needs to go through their base when they arrive and make a point of figuring out exactly where that cork went.
---
How has noone said fixer skins?
---
pick up golf skirts and outfits at the golf club, they sell for 27 caps each.  
---
also, i pick up every meat i find (as carnivore, i never get hungry again) and before logging out, i grill everything with super duper, then sell everything to a near vendor where ever you are.  
---
always try to have grape mentats and/or hard bargain 3 to get at least 27 CHA, or what ever the highest is, you can get if you're not running unyielding.
---
Good fo you. I once saw Beckett out of nowhere wearing only underwear. Tried to talk to him but he ignored me. We still don‚Äôt mention it.
---
The fighting down there disconnected him from his external systems. He couldn‚Äôt do anything if he wanted to.
---
I'm on xbox!
---
That's awesome, thanks for the advice
---
Outside the fact of pursuing a different build or fine-tuning your current build, levels and perk cards are needed for the upcoming legendary perks. 
---
Yes, the purpose of the event is team play, but there is clearly a loss if you take on one role instead of the other. That is the game's fault. Again, there is literally no incentive for me to gather ores (other than completing the event, which I don't really care for) compared to killing ghouls and other spawns (loot, EXP).
---
It seems like everyone in fallout can‚Äôt do actual objective based events. Rad rumble &amp; encryptid are very simple but everyone just stands there
---
I always have insomnia i stay up till like 7am some times
---
if you have something sick for trade you should use the displays on the walls, with the little letters to describe the effects. Saw a guy on the marketplace sub who did it that way, pretty good idea. If you put it in Vendor, so somebody will buy it. Your visitor could not know english :)
---
Yeah, I saw Sofia take on the SBQ with her gun a while back
---
women, right?
---
Sounds oddly familiar to the conversation my wife and I have every night
---
Can you trade me two of those helmets? For me and a friend, we've been playing this game for like a month then we just discovered that It was from a event that we missed.
---
My ign is CezarPX on PC.
---
Seeing her take on the SBQ with her gun was somehow entertaining
---
This is me. Anytime I claim Poseidon, power the plant and build the resource collectors, I leave and immediately get disconnected
---
Lolol
---
But you already have the list with the shit inside the vendor. When you hovering over the camp icon and see dude has 10 armors, 2 weapons and 5000 ammos you know that you won't get a stimpacks and plans there. So why do I need another one label here?
---
Huh, strange, always a full coop for me.
---
Yeah, especially on a high xp-yielding build -))
---
Just make sure that bush doesn't have thorns. Learned that lesson the hard way.
---
I mean there are 50 songs on Appalachia Radio. Even excluding the repeated songs, it‚Äôs still more than another other Fallout game.
---
I kind of wonder how many songs (and licensing) would it take to reach a satiation point.
---
I was particularly fond of ghillie suits 4-7 and Atomic Onslaught paints 1-3 and 6.
---
(Big ol /s)
---
3 serums plus 20 water....
---
CORN!
---
I think Russell wants to make cork sandals for all the troops.
---
COOORN! WE NEEED MORE COOOOOOORN!
---
For BoS DLC i really hope for legendary PA or at least PA rebalance/buff
---
 Reason 2 is the reason I bought FalloutüòÖ and zodor should die to save the world. What is more important?
---
I think the biggest problem is that for most people (especially those who don‚Äôt wear PA) the only way to go into the radiation zone is to put on a Hazmat suit which for most (if not all) builds is basically a death sentence since you can‚Äôt have armor pieces worn under the Hazmat suit.
---
Yes. Monster mash is the only source left in the game that draws legendaries from the pre-purveyor pool, but it can only reward 1* legendaries
---
Ammosmith, especially with super duper, is so great.
---
Haha yeah I had quite a bit of time to kill whilst I waited to die :P  
---
some good tips, definitely some good advice in there  
---
Didn't know the well rested or fed/hydrated disease resist (never sleep), and never noticed rad-away either, very useful advice  
---
Stealing, might not have noticed it on the first few, I know the last one just showed up as a normal lockpick, but will keep an eye out next time, but sounds like just being careful is best advise (I've also noticed most player locks are lv3 might just take of the master level and hope that makes it less likely to accidentally do it)  
---
legendaries, yeah I think I have noticed once or twice a player emotion over here once or twice, pretty certain someone pulled a legendary to the main chamber of the last event I was on as well, so also good to know that its appreciated with legandaries, and general mobs people don't really care about  
---
good tips all round, thanks for the advice
---
Was that on PS4? Took one down around the same time lol
---
I was selling B2525 fixers for 2k caps, E laser for 1k or less E plasmas for 3.5k or less and ass/sent combat armor sets for 6k lmao
---
From a cannon
---
Yeah. Even though they delayed wastelanders by over half a year, it's still clearly rushed and many things were cut out
---
Why are people trying to farm sbq and other things like that when they're are way easier ways to get legendaries?
---
That's what this sub usually is anyway tbh. Especially compared to pretty much any other f76 community
---
Ultracite lasers have a higher rof and lower damage. They are worse than normal lasers
---
Ultracite gattling lasers have a high base damage than gattling lasers. Ultracite gattling lasers are better.
---
Ultracite weapons also do not deal bounse damage to scorched unless primed. Contrary to popular belief.
---
When that BSSSSHHHH sound &amp; animation occurs...  Sweet bliss.
---
yeah, had to much time waiting to die :P  
---
lockpick, strange seems not many people have had this, might just be a me issue (odd computer is pretty high end, maybe I'm just unlucky...I do tend to pick everything, normally happens with safes, could be the reason)  
---
overweight, ah good to know, I might try to keep under my backpack mod weight if I'm in an area where I might die, good to know  
---
Etiquette, yeah seems like legendaries are the only ones people really care about, I'll keep that in mind, mobs I'll just kill straight out unless maybe if theres a low level around that might want exp or something  
---
thanks for advice
---
Hmmmph. I got nothing. Sorry.
---
Glowing Blood/Purified Water
---
Yeah seems to be a me problem from what I've seen, will give fullscreen a try (I normally go windowed so I can watch youtube or something, but might just watch on laptop instead, see if that prevents it)
---
You mean the sound of my minigun ripping flesh from bone?  Yes.  Yes it is.
---
"Not the CHEESE, the *keys*!!"
---
You're very welcome, glad I could help ;)
---
About the testing tho, later on you'll get some allies in your camp. You can flirt with 2 of them (each also has a questline unique to them and with unique rewards). when you finish their questlines and flirting will reach max lvl resting in your camp will grant you +10 (or was it 5) % of extra exp for 3 hours! Also yeah, well fed/hydrated give you extra disease resistance and rad-away and rad-x make you more vulnerable to diseases. Also if you take antibiotics instead of normal cure they'll give you +50 % to resistance as well. This info may not be new, but it's what I discovered myself. usually you can see all that in status report in your pipboy.
---
Or just give power armor carry capacity like the previous games?
---
There's one right outside my camp. I named him Fred.
---
So that‚Äôs what I was supposed to find! I found other the other day, and new it was supposed to lead you to something, but I couldn‚Äôt figure out what I was looking for.
---
Anytime :)
---
I imagine they will do it like they did in elite dangerous. Will be milestones of so many mats equating to certain rewards for everyone and a personal reward table for your own donations. So you should be able to see what‚Äôs been donated on a menu 1593739/9500000 donated. But then this is Bethesda so I‚Äôm not gonna hold my breath
---
More camp stuff and less skins. 
---
I would love the ability to choose your board. Have a few options like a weapon/armor skin one, a camp item one, a script/bullion/loot box one, or one mixed like we have this season. This way everyone has a better chance of getting things they may actually use.
---
Roll a Quad, it's my go to weapon 32 shots of awesomeness...
---
Very good chance that your friend is a moron üëç
---
And 250 levels in perk coins to max each one. So level 1500, and that's if they don't nerf or add new ones after you've started on your 6
---
I take them and leave when it comes to challenges. I can‚Äôt be bothered to fight for them not do I respond to the messages. 
---
I try to do them first and then server hop so I am not bugged or risk getting killed for no reason.
---
Source?  That your friend used.  Guessing it starts with an a and ends in ss.
---
Yes!!!! Even 1 star effects would be appreciated, pa lately has been kind of nerfed compared to regular armor cos of perks, backpacks, and legendary effects stacking.
---
No, it is not true. Most likely they wont be tradeable ever, thanks to the dupers.
---
Greifing is fun
---
With how much they push all sorts of Mothman content, in cash shop as well as over social media, especially now that Wastelanders brought the entire cult in some half-assed enemy only form... Like, I'd say it's clear enough that both the players and the devs have latched on to it, *hard*. Here's hoping it's only a matter of time before they get fleshed out into a proper faction.
---
We don't know it'll be BOS themed, could be the one after it. Which would make more sense given season 3 aligns with Fractured Steel.
---
I use them as it's easier than swapping around my repair cards.
---
It's called calibrated shocks piggy
---
I've never understood why our companions don't work like this in the first place. With how much they advertised them, they ended up being little more than some half-interactive CAMP decorations.
---
He's an amazing modder for Fallout New Vegas. Highly, HIGHLY recommend his mods
---
I miss reavers
---
No, this way they prevent this items from dupers.
---
It goes up by a few pixels only towards the end, so it's barely noticeable sometimes
---
Same here.
---
Wish they'd actually get off their asses and fixed *all* the challenges that are bugged out and won't complete - I'm quite certain they've had at least a few dozen bug reports about each and every one of them by now....
---
Thats kinda sad
---
I want to know too. Death claws don‚Äôt count for me, either
---
Nope. You let the suit break.
---
My partner and I went to RR yesterday.   Our plan was that I'd collect ore until I hit 25 and then helped defend.   Other people showed up, but somehow scavengers kept dying.   There was only one left, so I had to stop and defend them too.   One other guy kept collecting ore.  We hit 2/4.   But honestly, if I hadn't stopped, I'm not sure that one remaining NPC would have stayed alive.  
---
I really need to remember to bring the shish to this event.
---
Bethesda doesn't care
---
It is. But it is not as sad as a cheater mental health.
---
I see... a fellow connoisseur of jim carreys earlier works
---
This
---
How could you possibly know what he was getting by watching though, or that he was scrapping weapons? You dont see that...
---
Yeah
---
No mothman sucks
---
I‚Äôd honestly be down for changing the standard red rgb lights of my stealth suit to a rainbow theme instead.
---
I use my pint sized slasher blade. Love freaking out the noobs. Crazy enough... They follow me around after a while. ü§£
---
I'm not keen on the civil war dress it makes my characters look pregnant.
---
It says ive done it once, but i have no idea what it was.
---
Even a party horn!
---
oh thats handy, I have unlocked four camp allies...maybe 5, but have not swapped from the first I got which was the raider radio guy, been meaning to try some of the others since I assume they have different missions...I did not know about the xp boast that makes it much more worth it  
---
I tend to carry a pharmacy with me at all times, I normally use disease cure I'll have to try antibiotics next time pretty sure I have about 20 or so  
---
Thanks again :)
---
Yep. Last night I logged in and mine were done except 1/3 kill a legendary and 1/3 place camp  in NW.
---
You gotta kill different ones. Example, only one deathclaw will count out of five.
---
In my case Megasloths counted towards it, also killing the Queen helped
---
How much do you have yo donate each time for the event
---
Wish you could mix the classical one with the app one. I‚Äôd also like to remove the ‚ÄúHey Julie here...‚Äù part.
---
I hoe bethesda actually does show us the materials
---
Ah thanks that makes sense.
---
Grafton monster, sheepsquatch, deathclaw, megasloth and cant remember other options. You have to kill em all... 5 grafton monsters (for example) dont count.
---
On ps4 you push on dpad and it shows you what creatures you need and have completed
---
Buddy, I know Recolors.  
---
Assuming you're talking about the Atomic shop, there's a fuckin' generous ratio of 'recolor to new asset' content. You frankly don't know what you're talking about in this regard and I'd invite you to check out a lot of other MMOs on the market. ESO recolors to the heart's content, LOTRO used to do it out the wazoo, SWTOR only recently forced themselves to stop it but also jacked their prices up massively.
---
25% with strange in numbers too
---
Ohmy... I only can hear this in his voice. It is permanently burned in my mind.
---
Meanwhile I‚Äôm struggling at level 30. Can‚Äôt find any good guns and I have to run away a lot lol
---
Just did one. And must admit have met this event with moee ppl doing the collecting
---
Thanks for that as I was trying it in PA.
---
Yes, but not right now
---
Fuck that guy. Robots still kill my world and that event can be quite hard when they all swarm in at once. If he'd been afk while I was there I would have quietly left the event area and watched him die from a distance.
---
If you have a mutations recipe, you can sell 3 serums to a vendor using grape mentats / Hard Bargain and this will get you most of that 1400 quickly. Just sell a few things of purified water to snag the rest.
---
I wouldn't bother, it's normal, you never actually fast travel to your friend, just the nearest load in point, that can change if you friend only moves a few yards if a few are pretty much equidistant away. The game isn't going to prevent you travelling to them and say you can't fast travel to unknown areas, that would be daft :-)
---
I always go and collect the ore then hold on to it until the end that way it stops the stronger enemies from spawning
---
I mean the dupers will get the items anyway, it's just a way to prevent them making the items worthless by duping the living fuck out of them and ruining to game economy.
---
KHORNE!
---
I like the sound of Ricochet actvating, especially when hit with a turret or mini gun. Getting hit with a moleminer shotty makes for a jump scare moment as it amps the noise by x amount of pellets ya got the perk to deflect
---
What do I have to hit to force a respawn?
---
Cult of the Mothman could add some serious horror feels about it that would really be epic :)
---
SHOTGUN!

Awful build
---
Raiders don't have rules poser
---
put in a ticket with that screenshot, i was able to get the 80 atoms when i did. the challenge wont change in the menu though.
---
30? You‚Äôre able to get 40 if you hit up each shaft. Did you miss the one that you have to go through the cave to get to?
---
I have a few rules of thumb; I'll take your crop and collector items if your shop prices are outrageous, as to balance things out. If your prices are reasonable or cheap I won't touch your stuff, except if you have a raider collectron. I might take some shitty weapons from there to make some room for other stuff (not sure it works that way though but I'd imagine it does).
---
All locked doors are useless. lol

---
I thought of something like that but a mailbox instead and it holds 1 legendary at at time, the legendary is one that you were unable to loot or find after killing it
---
I may be wrong, but I believe you can both refund and keep the original item OP. If enough players that bought this bundle did so maybe B would take notice. And then proceeded to do nothing.
---
A 556 pistol would be amazing
---
Very true. Get a Q3325 even and you're set.
---
I'm glad you're angry I loooovee making nerds like you cru
---
I only did three.  I wanted to get it to the 1/4 level.  I figured that was my share and if anyone else wanted it higher, they could do the work.  I‚Äôm more after the experience, but I‚Äôd prefer that the event counts as completed for the treasury notes.
---
Hokey religions and ancient currency is no match for some bulllion
---
-smiley
---
Ok thanks.
---
Probably just gonna be updated every day or so. The numbers are too high for a legit player count, and it probably won't do them any good to see all the dupers they unbanned putting in millions at a time
---
Same as the one for complete daily challenges and the one I can't finish is the "mistaken identity" I think that is the one, as I did it a while back so there goes 80 atoms begging.
---
level 104 on ps4
---
25000 bulletin boards for the BoS offices, a new winery built to establish trade relations with biv, and hundreds of sets of ultra-light combat armor
---
Every time I do this event I immediately go to get the ores. I usually see the people just standing there with their weapons out. 3 people, 1 side. Like the enemys are undefeatable. 2 people on 1 side are enough. So 4 "guards" and the rest collectors. Simple right?
---
That‚Äôs the thing I‚Äôm not realy a hoarder and have first. and I only farm plastic for shotgun shells, and farm lead. I currently get enough acid as it is from my resource pump.
---
I think the most I collected on my own was 60 ores. All 4 caves and the ores that spawned after I collected the first "wave".
---
Crazy thing is I have got to the SBQ event sometimes late as it is on as I spawn in, managed to get a few hits on her and ended up with a 3 star legendary, most of the time I am there at the beginning unload thousands of .50 into her to only get a 1 star, go figure!!!!
---
I'm on vacation and than this huge awesome event pops up, i feel bad that i can't help the comunity in this event
---
Ah, alright. Just wanted to make sure you knew about the other shaft. I completely missed it for most of my RR events.
---
We are supposed to collect ore?
---
FYI, there are some perk cards to help with the over encumbered issue.
---
I don‚Äôt have Armco and the collecttron ammo is too random as it is, and currently I‚Äôm too annoyed with the ammo converter to use it Much beyond mini nukes and missiles, That gets fixed Tuesday I beleve.
---
Into the sun?
---
And to be clear, no one else picked up a single unit of ore during the event.  It wasn‚Äôt like we were at 90/100 and would have received the maximum reward if I had picked up 40 instead of 30.
---
You know this got me thinking. What if they implemented a tier system?? Similar to Division 1 and 2. Same map but if you so chose or maybe locked behind level, you up the difficulty by raising from base tier to tier 1. Stonger enemies, hordes of other enemies, environmental hazards, difficult events. Tier 1 has better drops than base, and you're separated from base players. And as you get higher up you need solid team of 4 to even traverse from point A to B. Just a thought anyway
---
When that bug pops up run about 30 feet in any one direction and it should start working again, sometimes have to do it twice if I didn't cover enough ground. 
---
It appears to be proximity based.
---
good luck, so long, , and thanks for all the fish
---
I see a lot in this forum about resetting spawn counters for junk... that‚Äôs a thing? How does it work?
---
We can try, sure, but I'll be around 6PM CET, I'll add you when ready

I heard a rumour that if you keep the other one's in your inventory. Game sees you have them and gives you one you haven't got yet not sure if true though heard it a few times.
---
Diluted radaway and rad x should leave ur mutations alone.
---
I would like to show off my sweet backpack skins, but cannot because I live in PA.
---
Yes, get in a Int public team and just ignore your teammates. Use the Inspirational Perk.
---
I'm level 350 nearly and I still don't know all the plans currently getting all the power armour plans. But there is no way I could do it on every character. Totally agree account wide for plans.
---
Technically, Moira won't be around for over a century so he is an ancient world Moira.  :)
---
The reason why you're beating a dead horse is because it's a sucker's task to get ores.
---
If you stick to killing mobs, you still get XP and loot, succeed or fail. 
---
The problem isn't the players, it's the incentive structure of the event.
---
Basically, it's Bethesda problem, not a player one. 
---
Maybe we should all focus our efforts on getting Bethesda to actually change how events are rewarded to incentivise successful completion over the current way it's run.
---
Can we have briefcases for one handed weapons as well?
---

76 has the most out of any of the Fallouts though, [there's 48 different songs.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_soundtrack#Radio_songs) [FO4 has 37 \(42 including Magnolia\)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_4_soundtrack#Radio_songs), [FNV has 26](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas_soundtrack#Tracks_listed_in_credits), [FO3 has 14](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_3_soundtrack#Radio_songs) and [FO1](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_soundtrack) &amp; [2](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_2_soundtrack) only have 1 each.
---
The ghouls go where the candy bowl is, so not picking it up means that the Ghouls come to you and you kill a lot more, instead of having to run around the school.
---
LGBT lights
---
Well fuck. I never thought of that. Do that event all the time. I‚Äôll give that a try
---
Do events that attract a lot of players and creatures, ie) scorched earth, radiation rumble, horde events, arktos, encriptid, line in the sand... there's a lot! 
---
And farm the usual: west tek, Huntersville, whitesprings, harpers ferry and burrows
---
My camp is generally open to all who need help. Use my workbenches to repair your arms and armour,my stove to cook your food, my Collectron if you need food to go on with,my beds to refresh yourself before you continue on. I have 5 water purifiers. I keep two unlocked so people can grab what they need, but i keep 3 locked so that myself and my own teammates aren't left short coming back from a mission. I think it's pretty fair.
---
Leader bobbleheads, cranberry nuka cola and mothman event award bonus xp and stacks with the others.
---
The question i have is what items their collectron will give, the other rewards don't seem as relevant
---
Just kill high level super mutants &amp; throw in the occasional scorch beast for some spice.
---
If you highlight the challenge in the menu. It will show you what you have to kill
---
Ah, my bad, got confused
---
Mine is the same, as well as the magazine collection atoms, some have all the ticks but wont complete. Ffs.
---
Such constructive criticism 10/10
---
Yes! Give us the enclave base walls from fo3!
---
Underrated comment of the sub
---
I guess I'm on the opposite end, I've never locked anything. In part because for a good while I had no idea how. But then by the time I was told, it just felt rather pointless. Never ran out of anything I couldn't get in &lt;10 minutes if I needed to; if anything, I usually have an overwhelming surplus of everything. Not sure what I'm doing wrong, I guess? o.O
---
I did the mutant behemoth at bog Town then went to the prime fissure for 2x scorch beast
---
So, what is the bigger disappointment? Being annoyed at scrapping a tattered field jacket in your dream or waking up to realize that you don't have any tattered field jacket?
---
You don‚Äôt have a dog and bark yourself. Hop to it puppy!
---
A gatling plasma skin. Any. Even a ghillie would be good. I want to hide my gatling plasma from traders.
---
Why the hell they just don't give you so many perk point for hitting 50, 75, 100 etc I do not know so simple no scrapping cards etc just give us point for leveling up so far but make it fair.
---
Hey real quick question how do you get that symbol next to your name?
---
Screw the BoS. I will probably collect thousands for them. ..and dump it in long grass behind a tree.
---
Alternatively it will all find its way in to my vendors where the brainwashed fools will buy it. Capitalism at work.
---
Is the BOS already in? People keep talking about it like it‚Äôs in?
---
I‚Äôm OBSESSED with corn
---
AND SKULLS FOR HIS THRONE!!

My best guess, thermal and acoustic insulation.

I just press on my name and click change user flair (on Android app)

Had a mod in FO4 that added them. Didn't look half bad. Which means if Beth gets a hold of it it will be fucking aweful.
---
On Tuesday theres gonna be collection events to get ( I think) 125,000,000 steel in 4 days across the community to make the brotherhood a base. These will continue into early September
---
That‚Äôs a whole lot of steel lol
---
Yea but the Chunky level 60 Feral Ghouls weak slaps go straight through power armour like what?
---
Thank you
---
Just do the glitch to keep the monster mask and wear it and gain Halloween candy constantly when you kill ghouls and stuff
---
It's a bloodied, the bloodied crackheads would pay way more for it.
---
Cork, glass, concrete, plastic, wood is needed too
---
I'll just glitch through the wall and take all your ammo because the game is horrible mess and then when you try to kill me I'll destroy your camp in seconds because its stupid
---
This. I completely agree with this statement. The only thing I would add is that I wish they would give you a little more details on the items in the vendor. For example, separate outfits versus armor, Separate flux versus regular junk, Separate chems versus radx/radaway etc.
---
The only thing you need for one violent night is the jukebox. There's no need for other instruments to be played
---
The tier should be the Capital Wasteland. All of the strong, tanks enemies im referring to come from there. Fast deathclaws that ignore armor, glowing ones, ghoul reavers, actual Giant Radscorpions including the deadly albino version, Super Mutant Overlords, etc. All of these tough enemies should be in the Capital Wasteland and we should all be able to go there. Hell add Cazadors to give us an extra challenge.
---
I leave my Santa collectron unlocked and occasionally a salty player will go to my camp and empty it and message me as if they 'got me good'. Its a simple concept really, it's open then take it.
---
I haven‚Äôt heard anything about this however it‚Äôs been speculated to yield a result.
---
When you sent the message afterwords, you should have said 'The sign promised me nudes....'
---
Does the counter count for containers too? I really want to farm Chems.
---
I run purifiers to generate purified water, about 100-150 per day is enough. Then I do one run through the Big Bend Tunnel (starting in the Cranberry Bog side and ending at Lewisburg side) netting enough weapons from Mole Miners, glowing and other meat from Glowing Dogs to sell at the Lewisburg station. At the west end of the tunnel, cook all the meat. Applying a Grape Mentat and the Hard Bargain perk before selling water, meat and all the collected weapons will normally nett 1400+. The weight is an issue hence the need to end on the Lewisburg side and walk to the station close by.
---
Astronauts, right?
---
Just play music on your own device separately?
---
This would make sense when you look at the other comments saying they found him in the overseers house. My head cannon for this now is somehow the overseer had Davenport bring these stashes to the stumps like they did with the overseers stash, and if they say a vault dweller with a pip boy on their arm, lead them to it.
---
At site Charlie theres some concrete aswell (decent amount for one spawn like bogtown).
---
Blackwater mine is also good for steel and all bloodeagle &amp; cultists spawns.
---
Im most curious if the dupers will provide help with this, lol if it gets done super fast.
---
How does it even work?
---
Will anyone get a reward even non-donors, or those who donate at least once or just those who donate X steel?
---
Your tag says Responders but you sound like a Raider.
---
CORN?! 
---
I DIDNT EAT ANY CORN!
---
They can't see your emoji. Only your team can.
---
Hell no. Steel is bad enough. Stay off my ammo materials!
---
Because the entire game needs massive amounts of fixes and updates but this takes precedent.
---
Corona - Corn. Oa coincidence I think not?
---
a skin for my handmade that makes it look like a giant dildo and every time it fires the end flops around from the kickback. also the ability to wear an orange traffic cone as a hat.
---
Does anyone have any good compatible on screen pads for parsec?
---
Its good XP and you have 100% chance for a legendary for the daily task. The odds are you can get 2-3 legandarys as the other SB around there have like a 60% chance to be legendary as well.
---
What‚Äôs a good way of farming legendaries? I‚Äôve never tried and I want to get some better weapons
---
It's really as simple as not participating if you are not interested.
---
Yeah you're thinking of the firebreathers one. The red and black one. The responders fireman uniform is blue white and red with a white helmet.
---
I will not collect anything for them.
---
How does it work does each donation  have to be a mix of the junk or is it a lot per one such as 250 steel
---
Where you been for the past month....
---
Happy cake day üòÅ
---
Shouldn't you, be, like, working whilst at work?
---
I don't see the point of having an ally when we one-shot almost everything. Although I could use an ally because that would probably enable AFK-farming.
---
Biv running a frat faction that is opposed to the BoS' goals in Appalachia is the plot development I've been waiting for.
---
No absolutely not. No. Definitely not. Negative. My work is sometimes busy. Today is not one of they days üòÇ
---
From what I heard it gave ammo, weapons and junk
---
It's the only reward I truly want haha I love those guys!
---
They're the only atom shop skin I collect, I hope Santatron returns this year AND we succeed on the Brotherhood one. If the Brotherhood one isn't great, I'll keep Ace the Raider going as that is my favorite one
---
 My camp is all open. No locks, doors or even walls. Just tents, canopies on  top of concrete foundations.
---
I maybe mistaking but I talked to ra ra and she does through the vents to open doors for you.
---
Oh damn, did not know about that. Thank you!
---
Gimme one chassis and I'll get in...
---
I don't think they will be autocompleted- we don't have to worry about the devs playing during the daily reset or playing NW before logging out, considering it is completely obvious that they have *never* played the game and experienced their own shortcomings first hand..
---
Shame them publicly over the mic. Its the only way they learn.
---
Brotherhood vs. Mothman
---
BoS: they're power armor
---
MC's: Power armor covered in that eerie mothman root stuff. It has some kind of power in it. It'd be perfect
---
I had one of those. A level 5 fought with my level 176, which is explicitly designed and geared for PvP. I‚Äôm also pretty damn good if I dare say so myself. But a level 5 held his own against me, and even got a few kills on me! In a PA frame! I can‚Äôt remember his GT off the top of my head, but a PA frame, Nuka Quantums, stealth boys and an NW laser rifle are adequate to face off against ass/sent combat armor, a BE laser rifle and a perked out character.
---
Or just make a new enemy that attacks us?
---
Ah... Patois! Though, Ragamuffin is also an old timiey American slang, which is what I think is meant here? My VERY white Grandmother used to use it in Ohio in the 70's... She was NOT Irie at. all! ;)
---
Or eaten ...
---
Lmfao, before I got into PvP properly, a level 38 took my workshop and absolutely kicked my ass... Ass/sent armor and a BE laser rifle, and it was that day I learned how powerful legacy laser rifles are.
---
I've watched a video walkthrough of this mission and this is a section in which there should be card readers to open the doors. The game also bugged out in such a way that the main door is open without me doing anything, the npc's keep freezing up, and there is a corridor that infinitely repeats and crashes.
---
The amped up mothman cult focus that came with wastelanders makes me wonder if we are going to get a big story with them at some point
---
It would be easier to to just build them a Raider Collectron, if that were the case üòÖ
---
I dont think you use card readers at all, Ra Ra opens the stuff up for you after going through vents etc...
---
That's part of the wayward/free radicals questline, and it's the o it time you will ever see them running around.
---
you have no idea how much that out of fallout date range 1967 song shits me.
---
Enough to maybe form... a brotherhood?
---
See you soon mate!
---
You have to find and open a vent hatch, IIRC it wasnt obvious that's what you need to do I just saw the option flash up as O was  running past it...
---
It will be a cold day in hell before I give anyone my lead.
---
You may need to uninstall and reinstall the game. But id put a support ticket in first to Bethesda. They maybe able to reset for you.
---
&gt; If I can unlock it by lockpicking it, it means I can use it. Your bed looks soft, man.
---
I have two locks on my bed. *winkwink*
---
I kill them and leave the server, I'm not gonna mess with any seeking revenge bullshit, but I still need to complete the kill 76 wanted players and I'm only still at 27/76.
---
M8 you may kill me but your water/ammo/collectron loot is still going to be mine after I die once. 
---
Unless the collectron is collecting junk instead of chems ammo and weapons. Then uh... Those won't be mine haha
---
Still I rob anyone I want. This is the wasteland baby, repercussions be damned! Say that ammo machine looks awfully inviting...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXZSrqRKkvg
---
here this video shows quite early on the section I am talking about where you have to use a card reader
---
How do you know someone picked one of your locks? Does it say you have to repair it or something?
---
So there are community rewards and individual rewards.
---
The community rewards are rewarded if a milestone is reached (e.a. 125,000,000 steel) and presumably placed in the atom shop for a limited time as a free item if it's a cosmetic or if it's an event, it'll be available for everyone during the planned time period.
---
The individual rewards are comparable to the presents/pails in that they give you rare plans when opened. These are rewarded whenever you make an donation of x amount of the junk in question.
---
Easy caps lol
---
Toss on inspirational per card, visit the lighthouse mothman when available, and do West Tek over and over again.  That's pretty much my go to.
---
All i could think of is bed frames, but...I doubt that
---
i could be so wrong because i dont know guns super well but the .44 pistol you linked - isn‚Äôt there a gun like that in new vegas? the .22 pistol or something?
---
True
---
On the junk tab there should be an option to see the components I think. Thank will let you select which ones your looking for.
---
brotherhood of cork
---
I like you. Where's your camp again?
---
I have no doubts about this
---
You're getting downvoted for playing the game and using it's features haha. So Petty. Im in the same boat. I steal what I want when I want and if I get robbed I get robbed. This is fallout not happy time sunshine island
---
My camp is so open for people to use I don't even have walls.  
---
Lets face it, anything I want to keep is stored in display cases which aren't lootable (the perfect lock), the collectron constantly collects scrap which when i'm playing I rarely get back often enough to cash in so people are free to take it if they want/need.  
---
I reduced the amount of water purifiers that I had to just 1 as the amount of water you can produce with 1 purifier without having to ration it (60 an hour is more than enough for my needs),  is quickly replaced so feel free to quench your thirst.  
---
The same with Workshops, if i'm claiming a workshop because I need a resource then i'l be at that workshop until I have what I need, then i'l dismantle everything when i'm done and leave the place tidy for the next person who wants it, if i've claimed one for score events then i'l chuck a couple of defences up and FT back for the events.
---
I think I remember hearing the Colossus in the upcoming event gives a guaranteed 3* item. Might be wrong though.
---
Do Radiatiln Rumble and sell all that glowing blood and meds with hard bargain
---
Couple of decent plans I think
---
No legend weapons and shit?
---
Bosses should always give max stars.
---
I guess it was just nice to see my ally out of the CAMP and kicking some ass instead of just wandering around complaining about things.
---
I‚Äôm not sure I haven‚Äôt done one of them in a long time but all I know is plans and junk I think
---
while I do 15k damage per hit, I still can‚Äôt get the challenge done because I didn‚Äôt do enough damage to it?
---
People have been saying this since the first month of this game's life. The game is not going to tank
---
This, honestly it's going to be a frequently run event just based on the rewards (1 guaranteed 3*, 1 1-3* from the colossus, 8 treasury notes) so I wouldn't try to get the random colossus's anymore.
---
I think it always display incorrectly, at least every time I've checked. So like you I stopped looking because I know what I got, at least most of the time. Feels like a simple thing to get working but nope...
---
I like it when you see mysterious stranger turn up at events like scorched earth. He just hangs around, being strange and.... Mysterious.
---
ew no. It‚Äôs a power armor which was commonly used in the great war
---
I've been playing Wastelanders since February and i NEVER met the Colossus. I didn't even try since i know it's not worth the fight. After all this time people are still surprised?
---
I don't think there is, because running costs VATS points and the way movement is designed overall, so auto run would be stupid.
---
Nope there isn't, almost all games on console don't have this option.
---
Not all of us use a broken build that let's us oneshot everything...
---
do not know if it would be lore friendly but the tesla armor skin from fonv would make me use power armor hahaha. also skins / updates that make stuff like the plasma rifle more viable vs. something like the fixer... my gosh that would be cool!
---
Yea that‚Äôs true but most recent games been adding them I just want to run and not walk around most of the times like I‚Äôm overcumber
---
less skins...more Camp items, atoms and legendary scrips
---
What I don't get is why we're being paid in lame rewards instead of gold. We went to such great lengths to restart the economy and all that bollocks with wastelanders and hunting down the lost treasure, and now no one bloody uses it.
---
I feel like I‚Äôm missing something. There‚Äôs been a lot of talk about collecting stuff for the BoS? No idea what‚Äôs going on.
---
This makes sense but the super duper perk could double good legendaries, if duped enough it could break the market. But good idea still
---
Why are you waiting?
---
Keep lunchboxes in as a craftable like pails. Remove the XP boost but keep the fun effects.
---
We care
---
I totally forgot running takes vats I just want to run like a mad man without having a pause and stuttering around
---
You'll know because it won't be locked anymore. Unless they changed it. Like you have to msnjally lock it again
---
Get a quad explosive 44 ammo using gun and use it where you don't want to one shot stuff in events... 
---
Ammo converter is honestly the current answer for unusable ammo lol
---
Well alright
---
I highly recommend not testing that question and instead you should just claim your rewards when you unlock them
---
There is supposed to be a community event in which all players are supposed to collect certain amounts of different junk for rewards, I think. Correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Did you click on the challenge and see the list? You need to kill3 from that list.
---
Thanks for sharing! I'll try it but that could turn out to be a lot of weight I can't store or carry lol
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/19lD84ailufdG6cgVdqls2/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-fortifying-atlas-and-quakecon-details
---
I got really confused when first playing because someone had their ally following them about helping them with super mutants. It was really cool and I got all excited thinking I could get a companion.
---
So as of right now it cost 450 perk coins to fully max out 1 legendary perk card. So if you wanted to fully max 6 perks (the max you can have at any one time) then it would require 2,700 perk coins.
---
So you'd need to scrap 2,700 perk cards in order to achieve that. Every level up roughly translates to 1 perk coin with perk card packs every 5 levels and in the legendary run to ever so slightly spice things up. So you wouldn't need to become lvl 3,000+, but it would still probably be atleast lvl 2,500 in order to max out 6 cards.
---
Though I've heard that Bethesda supposedly going to change the perk coin cost. We'll just have to wait and see what's it like when the PTS goes back up again for update 22.
---
That sounds like a rule to me.
---
No...thank you for the fun. Take a well deserved break and see you on Tuesday when the new patch drops.
---
putting it in a trash can
---
It doesn't work when your crafting stuff with modules.
---
Never had it go off with the new weapons, and its activated a few times when making SS Armour, but i never got an extra piece.
---
Someone must know how to trigger it. If anyone has any ideas, please suggest them.
---
Scattershot doesn't work as far as reloading the shotguns faster :/
---
Happened to me once when making a cattle prod
---
That‚Äôs cause you didn‚Äôt eat your pudding
---
Definitely this. They need a prewar pistol to justify how prolific .38 is... nearly nothing else uses it but pipe guns and those are literally zip guns put together with a trigger and firing pin... 
---
A standard police revolver would be fantastic and lore friendly
---
Shame they dont want plastic, i have 13k üòÇ

There have been at least 2 ways to do this. One was patched with 20, the other is clearly still happening. DemonAsylum's method was quite easy though.
---
I got the game about a month ago. It's worst crime is that it's just boring.
---
Did it actually give you a second prod? 
---
Maybe its just the SS armour it doesn't work on.
---
Either way they could just have it off and let OPs plan work haha
---
I think it doesn't work that way for the bullion plan weapons now, if not they could change it to where legendaries you craft aren't affected by Superduper
---
LOL wut now?
---
You can mod the legs IIRC to get at most +100 to carry weight.
---
Lol I know right, attempted some solo's on my private (where my pb was about 85 seconds) but yet never registered the challenge.
---
The 'Aquire Diseases' also took forever, and seems bugged for some people.
---
Also, on all of my characters, I never discovered the place 'Beckley' supppsedly.
---
Yeah it did, the first prod was assassins and the other was bezerkers
---
Yes... everyone knows this.
---
Worst support ever.
---
I‚Äôm concerned about what happens when they get to Camp Venture. Whoever opens that technical data cache will be buried alive.
---
Yeah, the hypocrisy amazes me.   Thieves are "just playing the game" but when we kill them under a wanted tag and take their stuff:    
---
Me:  "Hey, don't pick my lock and steal stuff."  
---
Thief:  "I'm just playing the game!  We can steal stuff."  
---
Me:  kills thief and takes their junk  
---
Thief:   sends nastygram, "Get a life, you loser.  What a joke of a player you are" ad nauseum. Me:  "I'm just playing the game.   We can kill people and take their junk when they become wanted."  
---
So, basically, they're allowed to take stuff from other players, but when the favor is returned, it's unfair?   GTFO.
---
Assassin and Bezerker....thats a shame haha
---
Well there you go, that's their version of the backpacks.
---
Lunchboxes I don't know who will need for leveling up to get duplicate perks for coins for legendary perk levels. 
---
Repair and scrap kits I don't care about. I guess this one's the easiest haha
---
I'm maxed on caps and scrip and there's really nothing I need.
---
Perk card packs, same as lunch boxes... Coins and legendary perk levels are per character, so I don't know who will need.
---
Resource boxes... Meh... Don't really need on any of the toons right now either.
---
Hence my question. Is it something I need to worry about now or did Bethesda communicate something?
---
I don't think most people's rigs would be able to handle that many NPCs and players running around during an event either. They probably tested it and realized that frame rates would plunge on consoles and on the average computer being used to play the game.
---
Yeah, got like 40 scrip total 4 both
---
We don‚Äôt know. I assume you‚Äôll have the 3 week cooldown to claim
---
There are no menaces remaining in 6 anyway....
---
No, I want the backpack to be useful with all its different mods and skins on the PA.
---
Uranium fever seems easiest to me. Take everything off mole miners. Walk down to WS station and sell.
---
Are you talking about the final assaultron ? Stand behind the pod on which it spawns and use it as a cover, wait until it overheats and shoot. Rinse nd repeat.
---
Serious roleplay is serious
---
Thanks. Do you know if all the rewards are still available for claim if I finish the run early? I guess so, but it's Bugthesda...
---
Giant, mutated, irradiated, scorched cicadas are a deal-breaker for me. I HATE cicadas. Damn near wrecked my car because one flew in an open window while I was driving. I'd probably have to quit the game. Gimme murder hornets any day.
---
For what. Austin Powers?
---
There another fucking assaultron?  I‚Äôm just siting on a bench and hopping Gail will do something.
---
Haha, give them a shot.
---
I don‚Äôt know why they wouldn‚Äôt be. Plenty of people have completed early.
---
There's only that one in that big one, and we'll the npc companions really don't do anything.
---
That's the trade-off when you're using PA.
---
Ok the Securitorn. Yeah I‚Äôm playing melee only and don‚Äôt have a gun on me.
---
It works with ss armour I use it all the time on xbox.
---
It‚Äôs really the only semi interesting event in the game.
---
Sure, it‚Äôs the acid to smelt that ore that‚Äôs a pain in the ass, though. Even when you know the various locations for farming it.
---
I guess we would have seen outage by now if they weren't. Thanks for your time.
---
Or they realize there are too many crazed Vault Dwellers nuking their place of residence, I love the Brotherhood but I can't wait to drop a nuke on them to see what it's like lol
---
Any PC player plays against any PC player
---
Yea that‚Äôs what I was trying to get at
---
Western revolver with bloodied or junkies.
---
What daily task are you talking about?
---
In that case orbit around the cylinder and wait for the robot to overheat, then go and land couple hits and return behind the cylinder.
---
Claim them before they're gone. There will be more seasons, which means more lunch boxes.
---
You have to do it on a new character.   I did it a couple days ago.   Apparently they fixed it but it wasn't retroactive to characters that had already done it.
---
Yes!!!
---
The SBQ fight is always good for legendaries, as is going through west-tek as there is normally a couple of legs in there, some public events rip legs the leader of the pack event in the forest can get you 3 low level single stars which are good for scrip only if you‚Äôre over level 5-10 but that stuff adds up. Scripping the ones you don‚Äôt want and spending the points you earn from doing public events at the rusty pick can be tiresome but now and then mama murmmmgh gives up the good stuff but it‚Äôs pretty rare to get the exact one you‚Äôre looking for.
---
Also check suitcases at train stations, some people dump ones they don‚Äôt want and cant carry or scrip in those along with plans etc so it‚Äôs always worth checking (blue suitcase in watoga is popular) If you‚Äôre looking for a specific weapon with specific perks the traders sub and discord can be good but people will want a good price on there and ammo is worth more than caps to most traders right now due to the cap limit.
---
If we had some new, rare plans added for this event then it wouldn‚Äôt have bothered me so much. Hearing that it‚Äôs exactly the same loot pool as the Christmas gifts and mole miner pails, though? Fuck that. I‚Äôll be holding onto my resources, thanks.
---
But he's right. Standing guard IS helping out. Can't fault players for the poor mechanics of an event (and game).
---
Display glitch, actually quite common.
---
Galen is the model for the cat posters and paintings in fallout 4/76
---
Been playing sice Beta and never got my locks picked :(
---
I played it several times before I realized it was the players who were getting the ore. I thought we were just protecting NPCs. I'm dumb, but I'm probably not the only dumb one.
---
I think they do in project bravo
---
Fallout 4??!!! It's all about the fallout 3 ghouls that literlly made the game into a horror game. The noise they made when running at you in a pack of 4 or 5. The look they had gave me nightmares for days when I was younger playing fallout 3 in the early hours of the morning. Fallout 4 and 76 ghouls ain't shit compared to the monstrosities you used to find in the metro of fallout 3.
---
Play. Another. Game.
---
If you don't care what your camp looks like I do just wall it off.
---
But I understand most want their camp to look a certain way.
---
Blocker, life giver, ricochet, fireproof (serendipity also applies but not if you‚Äôre wearing power armor..) 
---
that covers you needing stim packs every 5 seconds when your bloody you‚Äôll still die but a lot slower 
---
carnivore mutation and stack your meats you‚Äôll be hitting in the low thousands without a legendary add full unyielding armor and a bloody 3 star faster swing speed melee and you‚Äôll be anywhere from 10-30k dmg per hit (with stacked buffs) and hit so fast with martial artist on your arm will be a blur lol 
---
Add a single piece of 15% damage reduction while blocking armor and a ‚Äúmagic‚Äù shotgun and you don‚Äôt even need shotgun perks equipped you‚Äôll one or two shot almost everything besides the sbq .. you know for a backup weapon 
---
Talons, twisted muscles adrenal reaction, carnivore nerd rage bloody mess all pretty much required if you want YouTube levels of damage numbers with stacked foods etc
---
possibly if your just getting this now it might be your video or sound drivers
---
Tomorrow it drops? I didn't know
---
There‚Äôs also unique camp rewards like a rug, a plushie, and a trophy of The colossus.
---
It was the first thing I checked in case, All updated and working as normal
---
I‚Äôve been giving it to new players in front of the Vault if I spot them
---
Definitely worth it. It won't completely feed your ammo usage but it helps a TON. Haven't had to craft ammo every week so it's definitely a very good QoL addition.
---
It amazes me how nobody here has said it.... **Calibrated Shocks** makes any PA that has it excavator basically
---
Hence the point of the post.
---
Hope that happens too and I just dress up a SS armor as SS also belongs to Enclave
---
Do you get anything for donating to this event?
---
I'm a shotgun build and use mine to make 5.56 it churns out faster than the others for some reason 200 rounds at a time I just sell them in my vendor as everyone seems to buy them then buy ammo I need.
---
This is not the point of the post.
---
I wish there were birds in the game. The only ones are the dead vulture and a small owl that only spawns in the deep and no where else.
---
I know that if it's a daily quest then you have to wait until the next day (or longer) to try it again. Not sure about other types of quests though.
---
I've had FO1st for 3 months now since I got back into the game pretty heavy post wastelanders and it definitely saves you a ton of frustration in inventory management.  I can appreciate the survival / management aspect but when it becomes a good chunk of play time, it's out of whack.
---
This is my last month on it for now as I've definitely slowed down on playing the game again to where I can spend a little bit to hit the 3 dailies gold bullion and other legendary run dailies and carry on with my day.  I probably have 4-5 times of stuff in the scrap box over the limit of a Stash so it's totally worth it.  If the Brotherhood later this year brings a bunch more to do I'll likely resub to it but agreed it should be free or at least a better Stash management system.
---
As far as the script, go buy the amount you are going to claim.
---
Do you mean protection?
---
And that's why I explained the trade-off. I would love to slap a fridge mod at least for my PA but there's a reason we don't have that.
---
Big reason for me to farm sbq is the flux.
---
If colossal problem rewards flux too, I‚Äôll probably also farm that.
---
Giant turtles similar to the sloth would be cool.
---
You didn't explain anything we didnt already know.
---
Ah ok then thanks you‚Äôve just saved me from rejecting retirement plan ! Been waiting days for it
---
Event and kill legendary. 
---
But I'm guessing they were referring to just the kill a legendary.
---
You can not change the username, just the name displayed. For that you need to go to https://bethesda.net/en/account/manage-account and click "edit account".
---
I have no clue why this is so hidden.
---
What‚Äôs another game I can play? I love fallout, and games that allow creative ways of playing (creative use of perks or camps), and allow for multiplayer.
---
I don't think so but I won't mind because I have a full vanguard SS armor with Jetpack I don't use anymore
---
I want enclave camp items so bad man, and also a classic F2 X-01 Set with the camo from the Intro is something i neeeeeed
---
Yea the carry weight for power armour is a absolute joke.
---
Because the Legendary Run sucks. You're absolutely forced to play every day since Day 1 in order to make it to max rank. For people who can't play every day, they're basically forced to accept the fact that they won't be able to finish the run without spending real money to get to the end. That's just bad mechanics to force microtransactions.  
---
Red Dead Online at least did their season passes better. You can either no-life it and get it as soon as possible or take your time and make it just before the deadline. It caters to its entire playerbase nicely. There's also the option to buy ranks as well but that's only if you really want to pay your way to the top.
---
When someone busts out a flaming chainsaw, I bust out mine.  Everyone should be required to have one
---
I‚Äôm legit wondering where tf this group of BOS ended up because they have literally made no impact on the East Coast besides Appalachia which is making me think they all died lmao, honestly the only lore friendly explanation.
---
West Tek, National Array, Huntersville, Whitespring, Charleston Capital, The Burrows and max level Bloodeagle camps for locations and Radiation Rumble, Free Range, Encrypted, and AWOL Nation for events if you're looking to farm for gear to use.
---
Uranium Fever, Leader of the Pack events, and most Horde events for scrip stuff only.
---
Damn......That bed sounds damn worth it......Now that you mention it.......You look Well Rested friend....lol
---
stop picking it up if you cant do anything with it?
---
Exactly. This system is scummy, but it's Bethesda so we shouldn't be surprised. I just wish you could build the unlocked content for other people. I wouldn't mind building the plushies to those who can't.
---
Since public teams started, I now run level 3 inspirational and eat a bunch of cranberry relish and scorched beast brains.  You can run solo on a team for the benefits, and level quickly.
---
It would be too much. If you spec for crits, use a 50vc gun, crit food, chems and so on you can already do a ridiculous amount of damage
---
Yep! I subscribed in the first week of June, and last month it showed up on July 4, so pretty close to whenever you signed up.
---
Jesus I still have nightmares about the first Reaver subway encounter in Fallout 3.
---
Wait some time for them to respawn
---
That just makes sleeping on that bed even more worth it
---
Unpopular opinion: Why should you be able to complete the season just playing a couple hours on weekends? What's the point in it then? It should reward players who want to actually beat the grind and it's not even like it's a mandatory thing and the rewards aren't going to change the way you play the game.
---
Apparently that's not the case, as you're begging for backpacks for PA.
---
The daily task for the season pass.
---
Farming the SBQ allows you to get 3 in 1.
---
XP to level
---
Kill a leg
---
An event 
---
If you are lucky you can get 2-3 leg SB with the SBQ and do the 3 leg daily in 1 event. The nice arseload of Xp helps with the daily level up Task and towards the weekly 10k xp.
---
Hitting them in the wallet is pretty much the only way they‚Äôll pay attention. I bet if everyone who bought these bugged items submitted a refund ticket then quality control might actually become a thing.
---
Just as long as I have the option to turn it off whilst visiting.
---
Apparently you don't understand we want to be able to use our skins and mods. And begging is hardly the same as asking once.
---
I just knew about farming west tek but I‚Äôll be sure to check out these videos, thank you
---
Thanks guys. I was already wondering too. Inb4 first goals gonna be met just with 3-5 dupers teaming up for it.
---
No crashes for me past two hours. I haven‚Äôt had serious issues in awhile after assigning static IP‚Äôs for my gaming devices. For me at least, it was almost always due to my local Wi-Fi setup.
---
If you need a sheepsquash, look in the top left pink tress area (forget name) as it has a sheepsquash nest.
---
You cant trade or sell them.
---
You are correct.
---
What level are you?
---
I love the science scribe with my ritual mask. It's my default
---
Its bugged, they dont give a shit because why give out free micro-currency? There are several spots on the map you discover that give atoms that are bugged, for me Beckley and The abandoned Bog town are not discovered yet I've covered every square inch.
---
I hate you
---
But you can. When you get out of your PA. What I can't understand is how you don't realize not being able to use backpacks in PA is by design.
---
Ended up being the internet provider (Telstra), so I just manually setup the 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 DNS myself to get around it
---
I found it odd though as it suddenly happen when I passed the sign, it was like I triggered something. Likely was just coincidental though in that case.
---
That's the whole point of the post, that's what you don't understand.
---
We need lots of new displays for such, and they need to make items on display not weigh in the stash
---
Just turn it into the ammo machine like you said, o my one weapon uses it so you're pretty limited.
---
I'd have liked a .44 receiver for the lever action but oh well.
---
I plan to do a Pistol/Sneak build and that .44 Pistol could help.  But yeah, a Revolver's kinda underrated use.
---
All we need is a way to reroll affixes. It could be tied to an event that you must clear to gain access to a special crafting bench. Make each affix have its own cost, primary costs X, secondary costs x, tertiary cost x legendary modules.
---
It would be an amazingly popular event for a while.
---
Just a rough idea. Gives both us and bethesda something each group wants.  We get rerolls, bethesda gets people online.
---
So the point of the post is to beg to remove a feature that's by design? Might as well beg to bring back explosive energy weapons, too!
---
The idea of the labels is to help make it clear that ‚Äúthere is a diner on this server‚Äù .... ‚Äúoh also a club hangout area over there.‚Äù        
---
          
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt see your point of this limiting you, as valid.
---
One of the loading screen tips surprised me. Said something like ‚Äòif you get on the bad side of Crater or Foundation, there‚Äôs someone at the Wayward who can help you out.‚Äô So faction reputation was originally something more than a bar that just kept climbing. Picking a side with the Vault heist may have had some actual consequences. Imagine that!
---
Public teams -building
---
Level 3 inspirational perk
---
Sleep for well rested
---
Eat some sort of cranberry food (relish is most effective, cobbler is super easy to make)
---
Stack lunch boxes 
---
Run through high level mobs like whitespring. Radiation rumble is incredibly good for leveling (and hopefully someone gets the ore).
---
Gentlemen... BEHOLD!
---
...COOOORN!
---
Probably should have mentioned um... 25
---
Shit I'm totally speced for bloodied and I still one shot most enemies at full health.
---
Stalkers security baron after 600 arrows and an hour of kiting.
---
Fireproof is way better than ironclad imo
---
It'll make all their vertibirds Ultra-Light.
---
iirc that person is actually there, but idk if it's even possible to use their services. I would assume they can set you to neutral if you're still negative after the vault raid, but you only start as negative with the raiders and then you have to earn their trust in the quest anyway, sooo
---
*laughs in Todd*
---
The game lags bad and randomly crashes......filling the map to the brim will crash their servers permanently. They dont maintain what they have but 3 times a year and its evident when a maintenance break is over due when simple basics in the game are beyond broken like fast travel, vats, camps not showing up ( even your own ) if you have the Future-tec C.A.M.P. paint from the legendary run. They are letting the game fall to the waste side because why put effort into what they give away for free now?
---
IIRC tomorrow is Monday. 
---
Use eastern daylight time as a reference point if you are in Australia and it‚Äôs already Monday for you.
---
If someone wants to build a camp like a bar or a team hangout (has vendor purposes, but not the focus), we‚Äôre leaving a lot of these beautiful camps out.       
---
        
---
The idea of labels is to turn player vendors in to more of a sight seeing experience. People are already doing this. But I miss out on seeing lots of beautiful camps because it doesn‚Äôt show any items I want to buy.      
---
             
---
This is in context to adding more recreational aspects to visiting camps. This is not supposed to effect sales in any direct mannor.
---
It‚Äôs called a sentry bot. But there could be many factors to why you can‚Äôt beat it, bad armor, weapons, build, or too low level for the quest line. Those high level sentries would destroy me until I hit around level 50, but they do have a weak spot, they fire a shit ton of rounds and then overheat and then their fusion core is exposed, hit that a couple times and it‚Äôs a done deal. Good luck vault dweller
---
It's just a straight up reality of developing for consoles. The latest builds of the PS4 have 8 GB RAM available to the system. Not just the graphics, the system. I think they reserve 1GB for graphics, but for the most part it functions along the lines of integrated graphics processors, not discrete graphics processors. The XBox One has 12 but is more or less constrained in the same way as the PS4. Comparatively, a decent mid-range gaming PC can have 8GB or more of system RAM *in addition to* at least 4GB (modern systems) of discrete/dedicated graphics RAM. Because of the raw economic and practical desire to maintain a single, unoptimized per platform, codebase, the entire game becomes constrained by the lowest common denominator. That happens to more or less be the specs of a PS4 (8GB RAM, some sort of graphics processor). In order to load the game world, which includes player bases, the game has to be able to account for the additional load surrounding all the graphical objects a player might populate their base with. So, instead of having a wildly disparate player experience dependent on the horsepower of any given player's system (PC, PS4, XBox) where players with very high end systems can have significantly more resources than those without, and likely relative to the available horsepower of the servers themselves (likely somewhat "weak" because money), a hard cap on player introduced resources was established that ensures a uniform player experience regardless of the capabilities of the client system.  
---
And while you're correct in stating "consoles only have to load a small portion at a time", you're missing that what they have set that resource limit to is all a system satisfying their supported minimum requirements can handle while also maintaining the static and dynamic resources of the non-player resources. Each texture alone, at full HD (1080), is at least 5-10MB. So say you have 1000 things in your base that must be rendered and stored in RAM, and say they have some amazingly good texture compression (which they don't have), at the least you're looking at a memory footprint of 5GB. And that's just player resources. Layer on local "world" resources, basic system needs, UI assets, and now you have a tremendously slow game. I can almost guarantee that there are more than a few game engines that can handle high def texture assets much more efficiently than Bethesda's, and the critique of their obstinance in sticking with their (granted much improved and developed) 10+ year old engine, in my opinion, are very valid, but that doesn't change reality. The game uses the engine it uses, and the company guarantees a playable experience at the minimum specification it does, which subsequently dictates what the players can do within that engine to ensure a minimum usability for all players.  
---
All things considered, the biggest fuck up Bethesda's making with FO76 is their insistence on pushing concepts that make sense for mobile games on what could easily be one of the best MMO experiences on the market. Combined with the product owner's/business' emphasis on rushing incomplete or uninteresting content to release over resolving and improving "quality of life" issues like bugs and the grind perception. I know I should have looked into it, and maybe I will, but it seems to me that the product owner/manager comes from a mobile gaming background and has little to no experience with "classic" MMOs. I mean, I freakin love Fallout since I bought a big ole' cardboard box with a nice little Fallout game guide, that wasn't much, but was set up well to actually introduce a new player to the game back in the late 90s. When Fallout 4 came out, I was disappointed in the direction Bethesda had at that point committed to for the franchise (shallow, repetitive, devoid of the wry sense of humor of even FO3), but what FO4 hinted at was the infinite potential of a FO MMO. Like a WoW without the insipid fantasy tropes that had become so boring and played out. But instead we got served a halfassed attempt at merging a franchise that literally screams MMO with the fucking mobile "milk every last dime out of your base via microtransactions" paradigm. It fucking sucks! And literally nothing in the road map comes anywhere close to pulling players like myself back in. Why on Earth would I even **want** to grind the inanely repetitive "quests"? Another currency grind isn't what anyone wants, even the goons who did it instead of doing the smart thing and walking away from the game. I get the desire to demonstrate that this IP is something worth a game company like Bethesda to produce. But not this way. Mobile game-i-fication should never be accepted for something that shouldn't exist as a mobile game. I really wanted FO76 to be that MMO version of FO4, instead we got Candy Crush wrapped up in fancy 3D and disingenuously labelled a Fallout game. There's so much damn potential, just being squandered by unimaginative greed.
---
I have 2 explosive revolvers that use .44
---
checked the integrity of the game installation?
---
If one was labelled as ‚Äúlegendary gear shop‚Äù or ‚Äúchems shop‚Äù or ‚Äúserums shop‚Äù ‚Äúexplosive ammo shop‚Äù ‚Äúenergy ammo shop‚Äù.    
---
This wouldn‚Äôt help?
---
[](/aj11)(Yeehaws with viable confusion.) Gotta get yerself a nice western revolver, it hardly ever misses in vats, and it does a respectable amount of damage for next to no weight.
---
Yes. Two other people and myself dragged it out of the forest near prime and out of the nuke zone.
---
Central mountain lookout is directly over site alpha's exit. You will find a porta potty with a elevator button in it. That is where you exit the silo from.
---
How about all power armors can have jetpack option
---
I works. It happened for myself twice when i was crafting Plasma Caster. Weapons are not the the same, different amount of stars and effects. Like i crafted them two separate times
---
Again asking once isn't begging. But you wouldn't understand that either.
---
For caps: Stop fast traveling so much. Do events like uranium fever and pick up ***everything*** and sell to train vendor after. 
---
For screws, I have found the bunkers tend to have a lot of hot plates, fans, and type writers. Use white knight perk when repairing armor always. 
---
You usually get a piece of armor at the end of events also. Sometimes legendary, sometimes not. Either way it should help. 
---
What kind of weapons are you using?
---
Some blue smurfs come flying over and killing everyone with their chainswords.
---
No no your right I thought today was Monday.
---
It's the same attitude thieves in real life have. It's okay for them to steal, but not for people to steal from them.
---
Is this a reference to something?
---
Same for playing instruments for one violent night.   Love watching all the dead ghouls pukie around me while i play the guitar.
---
I use alts for the NW and Adventure mode level up challenges. I‚Äôm over 100 in NW so increasing overseer rank would be a hair puller without them.
---
There is no possible use for millions of cork anyway. Bethesda is having a laugh at us.
---
Just wait until.someone nukes the fissure site nearby.  Then you're gonna have a different issue.
---
can just rebuild
---
Vats shots to the fusion core kill all sentry bots regardless of their level. The fusion core is the first target to the left/last target to the right in the vats menu, have fun!
---
I hope we get more ENCLAVE stuff soon!
---
Why?
---
Truth. As long as people keep playing along with the greed, the greedy will keep on greeding. The problem is, how do we say "no more of this bullshit" without the bean counters and suits interpreting that as a lack of interest in the franchise? Because all they look at is revenue. If nobody wants to play the shitty, greed driven, iteration of franchise X, for the most part, the suits only see that as an overall lack of interest in the franchise and not the product of their bullshit efforts to maximize profits at the expense of quality.
---
What are donations?
---
I wish we could put two prices on every vendor item (if you wanted) : cap price or gold price. It's supposed to be an economy but only three people buy things with it.
---
Alright thank you. I didn‚Äôt play for a while so I missed the presents. üò¨
---
I keep all resources unlocked, it'll be full again by the time I return so I don't care if you take any!

How can you have any pudding if you didn't eat your corn?
---
See, that why i haven't submitted a ticket yet. I don't particularly want or need the atoms, i just want that challenge checked off to soothe my ocd!
---
But the XP! I'm only level 457! I need it! /s
---
Actually, that little door of cache reminds me of a stove, that'd explain why it's seemingly bottomless,
---
Are you okay?
---
Yeah? When did you have to also load the random assets of 24 other players in FO4? I can answer it for you, never. FO4 and FO76 may share a common lineage but the requirements of the two couldn't be more different.
---
The mods have perk counterparts broo
---
Certainly not every single day! I didn‚Äôt mind the level up 3 times as a weekly. Because that can be something that just happens while playing regularly. 
---
And I could have made an alt and used that to level up quickly. But wasn‚Äôt interested in doing that.
---
VATS Crit Pistol build with a main use of the Western Revolver?
---
Vampires ultracite Gatling laser... melt their faces off
---
I don‚Äôt want to play a couple of hours a weekend I want to play 5 - 6 hours in a week to complete the grind, that seems reasonable to me
---
You can't really do much sneaking with revolvers that use 44. :(
---
Top 10 anime plot twists:
---
Drop until you have like 20. You rarely go in minus anyways
---
PVP in this game isn't fun period.
---
True but it still counts as part of a Pistol build.  Either way, I like to balance stuff out.
---
Try and stop me
---
I feel like it could be though... just not if everyone who wants to start it turns into the Invisible Man!
---
This. Just make a choice. Dragging it will only lead to the chance of losing rewards.
---
Literally all I do, during Radiation Rumble
---
I have screenshots, from like 3 patches ago, where somehow the companion commands showed up in my hud. They didn't do anything, but I had the option to tell someone to movie to where I was pointing, as well as inspect another player.
---
I can upload them if you'd like proof.
---
Oh okay so you have access to a weapon that can make short work of the level 18s and then finish it with a bleed out syringer
---
If your into the game you should read up on what‚Äôs coming to the game.
---
I sure hope you're a part of them
---
Would they be tradeable? Everything else you make with legendary modules are not tradeable.
---
That would completely kill weapons and armor sales on player vendors.  The current bullion weapons and armor already devastated part of the player vending economy.
---
Activate jukebox
---
Go to the corner where the door is
---
Crouch in front of the stairs facing the jukebox
---
Make sure you have your AP
---
Blast the shit out of everything that comes and in heads straight for the jukebox
---
the perk is literally blocked from working, all that happens is the sound and animation
---
It's also been said in this thread already
---
it is rather annoying as a completionist myself lol
---
I call it a rubber band
---
No. You're probably aren't.
---
I started this game with the intention to have fun pvp events.Shooting a group of vault dwellers with my friends,ducking for cover and generally having fun.Oh boy i was wrong.Its either a guy who jumps in one place shooting explosive weapons and receiving zero damage or stealth guy who one shots anyone he sees.I drop any kind of pvp in my play because Bethesda is doing nothing to nerf/balance this toxic gameplay.
---
They would have to get rid of legendary gear for pvp to be anywhere near playable.
---
 I said it before I'll say it again, it's nothing but gear vs gear... No skill involved.
---
Smart I‚Äôll have to invest into that
---
Nah, the downvotes are because they're coming across like an ass. Just like you.
---
Any rumors around if BOS will sell stuff for gold bullions?
---
Enclave scum
---
Ah... thanks.
---
its fine by me.
---
Still not fixed lmao
---
As a new player, I enjoy the perk cards and camp item unlocks. I'd like to see random plans pulled from a list of plans the individual doesn't already know.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt understand why people would even use their bloodied weapons or any weapons that deal heavy damage in events. I always use a TSE 50 cal and spray the area and let the other players finish them off
---
Did you change anything about your PC recently? Like anything at all, any new install or configuration?
---
Trap bases are okay if its' defend your locked items.
---
The whole use of the BoS in 76 was such a stupidly lazy "add" from the get-go. 76 works much better as a "lost cause" in the early years after the war. Not the continuity breaker that it's turned out to be.
---
Many good plans and lots of armor and weapons to scrap for mods.
---
 For some reason I have better luck with buried treasure gear scrapping then I do crafting/scrapping for mods.
---
 Might just be a coincidence though.
---
And that's why there's a bed next to the free water!
---
Honestly I have nothing in my house that I need to keep safe but it's an immersion thing for me for the same reason I add useless decorations and make it seem more lived in. My front door is the only thing I keep locked besides some extractors if I'm low on something.
---
Uhhh... Ok lol.
---
Please, they could alter them to have the gauss energy explosions!
---
Are you scrapping scout armour by any chance?
---
Don‚Äôt forget the quantum‚Äôs.
---
100 capacity is a joke, nowhere near enough!
---
I usually server hop huntersville since it‚Äôs very close to my camp, I forgot about west-tek but I think I‚Äôm going to start visiting it after getting done with huntersville
---
It seems to be part of encouraging folks to use alts.   
---
The notes for Test Server players mentioned Legendary Perk slots being account bound, too, and asking for feedback on starting new characters while using Legendary Perks. And from what I remember slots only unlock up to ~300, so it looks like at *some* point they want you to start over rather than grind to infinity.
---
Just Excevator is missing it, and that's sad as that is the most useful set to have one!
---
Now this is just my opinion, but to me build is more important than guns. Give my shotgun to any of my friends and they cant do squat - give it to me with my VATS shotgun build and I one shot almost every non boss enemy in the game. 2 shots for deathclaw though, and 3-4 shots for sheepsquatch. I kill lvl 60-70 3* enemies in one shot and dont even realize they were a legendary until I'm looting.
---
And back then it boosted your strength and carry capacity, not anymore it now weakens you!
---
When I build the shit out of Sanctuary settlement including a few automatic things to make ammo.  Plus the 30 or so NPC and the hordes of weapons armor, clothing and junk.
---
Are all 5 of your characters high level?
---
Appalachian Antiques has 3 spawns that can give you the BOS Hood, Flight Helmet (I think), and BOS Fatigues, BOS Labcoat. Not sure if the Engineer and Science outfit also spawns here (BOS) or their respective head gear. Overall the BOS outfits are cool, imho, and pretty easy to get. Bomber jacket is from turning in Tech Data. Hunters Longcoat and black amry beret, or black pilgrim hat also works. The free Mountain Scout outfit for pre-wastelander customers is also nice, so is the Insurgent outfit.
---
Yeah I think I am going to have to rework my build as shotguns are my fav.
---
It's almost like the challenge to level up is..... wait for it.. WAAAAAAIT for it.. challenging.
---
they can collect their own fucking cork.
---
id bring them fertilizer though üí©
---
Is this actually the case in lore, or just the best excuse we can manage for Bethesda? I don't seem to recall any references to anyone going to the Whitesprings for trade before the Vault 76 inhabitants got there, but perhaps I'm mistaken.
---
What system do you play on? I could always show you my set up and maybe even get you a decent shotgun! 
---
I'm on PS4
---
So, I'm a little sympathetic on free range.  The sheepsquatch is a bullet sponge, and can easily wipe out the brahmin if you aren't careful.
---
Good news: You can still do The Legendary Run in that time.
---
That would be awesome but I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
All I want is Wrist Mounted crossbow!
---
the perk is specifically blocked from working, all that happens is the sound and animation when it procs.
---
Speaking of, why do legendaries show 5 stars when the max has always been 3? I've never seen a legendary with more than 3 stars filled.
---
Thanks for the offer though. I‚Äôm starting to see why people like the community.
---
Awe I tried &lt;/3
---
Shit Happy time sunshine island sounds like it would be an awesome dlc......Sign me up Bethesda.......I'm broke though so I can only pay in buttcheeks
---
This is a known issue. Nobody knows what's causing it.  So, here are a few things to try, to avoid future autocompletes (and no, Bethesda will NOT reimburse you for any S.C.O.R.E. that you've lost).  
---
1) after you load the main menu: do not go straight to anything other than adventure mode.  No N.W.  No private server. And no atomic shop.
---
2) Don't be in the game during the daily reset (12:00 p.m. EST).
---
3) Don't end your session having just exited from N.W.
---
4) Make sure that when you exit the game, either to your desktop or console dashboard, that the game is fully closed and not running in the background.
---
Nobody knows what's causing it for sure. But, Bethesda is logging the issue to find a fix for it.  And it's not new.  This bug has been around since N.W. was introduced.
---
Yeah it's worse when those chunks are legendary chunks, and roll away into the depths of the Bog.
---
But, I appreciate the extra damage and can afford the perk.
---
Wait until they release secret collection - Lead üòÇ. After 2 weeks 200 lead submitted (by accident)
---
Exactly! I never unequip it it‚Äôs just irritating at times
---
When they did the event for killing scorched last time, there was no in-game indicator of how you were doing.  They scraped the metrics daily and put them on the website.  So there was nothing that could autocomplete.
---
I've never once done that
---
I agree, I just dislike people who have vendors inside their locked house. The guy had like 300 plans and I wanted to browse but couldn't because every door was locked and there was no vending machines outside.
---
No Sir that ammo machine is for my friends and I......Of course I could understand how you'd mistake it as a free use one.....Surely you understand my good man
---
A possible (magical) explaination of all Fallout 4 assets staff:
---
Broadsider. As far as we know U.S.S. Constitution stucked at Boston. But before it U.S.S. Constitution was travelling by jumping through all United Stated from East to West. So it is possible U.S.S. Constitution dropped a few of broadsiders during its jumps.
---
Cryolator. Someone who did a cryoroom at dome 2 might made a similar cryolator as it was made at Vault 111.
---
Harpoon gun. Someone stole it from devroom and dublicated it into West Viriginia (seriously I can't imagine any other possible reasons).
---
First they should fix the backpack clipping issue, then they could add PA backpacks...
---
Nice to hear some positivity for a change.
---
Nothing at all as changed which I find just crazy I've sat for nearly 2 hours now doing events and exploring and no crashes
---
No, it would increase stock and allow the market to thrive!
---
Get rid of scrap/repair kits.  If you need them that bad, then you're probably already doing the events that drop them.
---
And less of the bugged/glitched crap.  They need to test things before they release them!!
---
There are quite a few places where you can find significant amounts of concrete bags. Two which immediately come to mind are the around the Bogtown workshop and the third level of the Monorail Elevator.
---
Cork is the tricky one. Golf balls at the Whitesprings are just about the only thing which comes to mind. The only other items which contain it are Crystal Decanters and Globes, which don't spawn in any one area in large quantities so far as I know.
---
Escape Artist. Sometimes I'm in a firefight in WestTek and the Super Mutants just suddenly forget I'm there; then I sneak shot them again.
---
I have killed the Scorch beaste queen like over 10 times.
---
Still that challenge is bugged.
---
Which kind of underscores the idea that it isn't getting one-shotted accidentally.
---
A fallout 3 ghoul reaver was about the worst thing to run across, maybe the albino radscorpions were worse
---
Don't know bit of be surprised if they abandon their new grind mechanic. My guess is new stud will be obtainable through a combination of golf and scrip to craft. Which sucks cos I hate these new things being untradeable
---
Yeah I had my first PS4 SBQ one-shotter. Total dick. I knew something was up when another high level started frantically thumbs downing this one douche when he turned up. Sure enough queen appears, he one shots and leaves without anyone getting a scrap of loot. Wasn't even his nuke.
---
If you're reading this whoever you are (or the people who do this) you're a jack fuck. Simply put. Atleast let her circle a couple of times and land once, that'll give everyone enough time to meet damage thresholds.
---
Lord knows why you'd need to be told this... As if common courtesy is too hard to grasp.
---
Less level up. Definitely not every day. 
---
More fun unique challenges like blow up XX vehicles.
---
I would settle for not being stripped out of my Underarmor when I get in power armor
---
I already knew about those limitations when I made this post. I just made a summary, Jesus F*ck... lol
---
what platform are you ? if on pc i can help
---
SBQ is not about legendaries or XP. SBQ event is about:
---
1. Ultracite plans for Stranglerheart powerarmor.
---
2. 4 random fluxes.
---
3. A pair of repair kits.
---
Maybe we will know more after quakecon, but it stands to reason that BOS would also be part of the new economy and hopefully we get new gear. Like new items, not super stoked about the grind. BUT, if BOS will also sell shit for gold I assume they will have a daily that at least would feel fresh for a while.
---
My safe word is "meatloaf", as in I'd do anything for love, but I won't do that.
---
5? I just have one
---
Wait, is the event live? If so my blind self didn't notice
---
The actual world itself along with the sound track is easily one of the best parts of the game.
---
If you already have recipes for serums, you can craft and sell those (at max 500 caps each). I have all sorts of Glowing Blood, more glowing meat than I'll ever be able to consume, and all the chems that I do not have an addiction to (psycho and buffout), useless weapons, Halloween skeleton costumes (good way to get rid of bone scrap).
---
I'm trying to figure this out. Someone said this is a bug that occurred in Skyrim where you could get an NPC you were talking to you accidentally fast travel along with you. Another player said that it happened because their ally was close to them in their tiny CAMP building. I have experimented with both several times and haven't figured it out yet.
---
If only we could start posting the names of the one shot criminal gang! Wastelanders with technology too dangerous, technology that should be confiscated by the brotherhood of steel!
---
Yes a beret for stage 1
---
Power armor should have Chemist's and Grocer's hand mods! Why? Because there are not any good non-melee hand mods at all.
---
It's live on the 4th
---
yeah but, there was like 10 people or so (bunch of new players were there (like 25-40 range), there was no way that sheepsquatch was getting to the brahmins
---
I too have seen him pulling the "Slater" on his chair. He thinks he's so fucking cool but you know what you're not cool, ward. You're not Slater and you never will be.
---
Not every player, but several members have reported seeing an ally at the Scorchbeast queen fight and other events. Presumably, if we can figure out what triggers this, many players could bring their allies to the Scorchbeast queen battle.
---
Explosive lasers are just pure cheating imo, they were taken out the game because they're too powerful. If Bethesda can delete legendary effects from a mask they can sort the lasers out, they ruin PvP and pve.
---
I'm also new. I've been doing quests and reached 35 yesterday.
---
I find it annoying they keep giving everything PA had going for it to the non-PA.
---
* Backpack are similar to calibrated shocks - but you can have versions that have armor, or make food spoil slower.
---
* Jetpack - but it doesn't take fusion core charge.
---
It seems the non-PA players whine the loudest in Bethesda's ear.
---
Yeah, basically the same as me except I sit on a table in the middle. I've had ghouls come down the stairs and surprise me before lol
---
Yeah, no one cares if you steal their stuff...if you want to play as a rogue, go rogue. But, don't act all buthurt if people want to protect their stuff
---
I'll admit that I feel seen by this.  :-)
---
Create another character. Leveling up is now a simple task.
---
Oh, dang, here I thought I was up to date. Also, what the heck do they need 200 Million cork for? To put I'm qime bottles to open whenever Elder Maxon the 4th arrives I'm the Commonwealth?
---
Same psn as name here, just no k, on after 7pm easternüëç
---
Probably for new content in the future... like year 2040
---
I mean, Russell is basically a fanboy - does he actually have the slightest idea what they need?  "Steel" is in the name, I guess.
---
You can put a .38 receiver on several weapons. I carry a .38 Fixer with me for lower level areas.
---
Me to i get around 2 per play seems to be during big events (scorched earth etc)
---
cosmetic fanny pack *that costs 2500 atoms*
---
don‚Äôt forget the most important part
---
It‚Äôs not a double barrel, but I have a bloodied combat shotgun if you want that
---
I need an assistant to test my theories. I wouldn't want anyone to get hurt because of a mistake. Nobody's ever happy when that happens.
---
Well everyone in Appalachia is a massive super cunt so yea I guess they all got nukes lol
---
The bigger problem is that you have to worry about sharing legendaries in the first place. If you are actively fighting or participating in the event everyone should get loot. If they have to make it so there is less loot overall to balance, so be it. I don't want to have to guess, they should just make it convenient to work together.
---
They also should make it so you can loot in a area of effect, or everything in that cell at once to make looting less of a pain.
---
Nope. Some plans, non-legendary gear, and junk. Good for scrap or cheap plans for your vendor
---
I wouldn't say it's not *fun*. It's just completely unsuitable for the way the game works.   
---
Looking at the way it's designed, they couldn't have made it less suitable for PvP if they tried.   
---
There are **huge** disparities in effectiveness across all the builds you see in a day. Unless you're someone who plays a "meta" character you copied from somewhere else and happen to bump into another copy of the same build, with the same (or similar) min/max RNG grind legendary gear, you're not exactly going to end up with an even match.   
---
PvP in 76 is a curiosity at best.   
---
It can be entertaining at times, but it's mostly just a really bad fit.    
---
Also the "seek revenge" thing was a really stupid idea.
---
You can lock a bed!? I‚Äôm going to turn my camp into a hostel and lock the shit outta everything.
---
Any 90% reduced weight?
---
I love Ace.......All he wants is to see the world burn......And I love it......Nothing starts the day quite like an angry collection full of rage to threaten you regularly
---
To shreds you say...
---
That was kind of my point. Start off a new character. Run down to the wayward. You can level up in less than 10 minutes.
---
Pertaining to the legendary perks we don't know what kind of changes they're making to them so we can't say how much they are or aren't needed.
---
What loss? The exp? The score? Stuff you can obviously get in your own without hindering others who might want to get full rewards on an event? Once again sounds like an excuse to shitty behavior. Just because thinhs can be twisted to promote selfish ways doesn't mean thats how it should. Reasoning like that is the same reason mmo survival games with pvp elements always take a shitty turn because people reason out that just because they aren't rewarded the way they want for being a team player means that they should do whatever they want to get what they want. You do that in the real world and you end up jail, and of that's the attitude of certain players they'd be better suited playing gta online lol
---
Sorry man, your original wording says it does "20 shots of damage" which makes it sound every shot is supposed to do 20 times the damage or something.
---
Nope. You needed to do them both *BEFORE* the point of no return quest. You'll have to start a new character if you want to do the quests for the settlers.
---
Yes. New character.
---
Noooooo.. Please dont be like those mobile games with these daily log ins. The game is not in a good shape already..
---
This will make the game more of a chore, and not everyone can afford to log in everyday. This will be an issue, especially if the rewards will be of something that the players will feel left behind when they dont login.
---
Not being a dick or anything just not as well versed
---
......Would you care to elaborate fellow traveler?
---
Hey I made a mistake. I meant to say ‚Äúyes as far as I know‚Äù
---
For non legacy best are :
---
Prime receiver (but you MUST be craft ultracite ammo, if not stay with normal)
---
Refled barrel, reflex sight, beam focuser.
---
You can transform it into a "flamer" with Beam splitter but if it's not a legacy it's not recommanded.
---
Hey man you're full of shit......lol
---
Nope, you'd have to make an alt. They made a big deal about lasting consequences in the wastelanders update so just being able to do all the things on one character wouldn't make sense.
---
im coming back after a long break and I wasn't super into it back then (I am now tho...lol) so forgive me but...what's a legacy?
---
LMFAO......Yes
---
I just acquired a quad ffr fr tesla to just tag mobs in uranium. Unfortunately after the first shot it became apparent than instead of tagging I killed multiple in one burst. Back to the standard fixer
---
I've literally only heard squeakers act like that. Stop lumping in thieves with children.
---
Chill out. Its cool for OP to think it's kind of lame.
---
PVP is not fun becoz Bethesda dun know how to balance the game
---
The savage divide by Inon Zur is a genuine masterpiece imo and you would only hear it if you played the game. It only has 43k views on youtube.
---
Well, you can say thank you to the dupers...
---
Wait where does it come from?......Is it like a lunchbox perk?
---
After the vault raid it's too late.  
---
At any point before you confirm which side you want to work with you can do the quests with both factions, but once you start either of the quests that sends you to Vault 79 you lose the option to continue the other faction's questline.
---
&gt; First they should fix the backpack clipping issue, then they could add PA backpacks...
---
That priority of yours... do you really want PA users to suffer without backpacks for years?
---
Yeah, I'll second that
---
And maybe a hug???.......Bring it in buddy
---
And it only increases your carry by +5
---
Yeah haha hes just a poser. His favorite is turning around and dropping his "finally someone has the guts" line like its a fucking stage performance and then staring motherfuckerly cause i answered too quickly.
---
Normall fallout games tend to have a meh soundtrack IMO but this one was something else. The cello and music sounds a LOT like Halo Wars 2, and it blew me away. Between that and the volumetric lighting I just stood there and was like "This is on xbox one?"
---
I think he just meant a button to make your character move forward automatically. Which wouldn't be stupid because that function does indeed exist.
---
But can i get max rep by doing daily quests?
---
What's to imagine? It's already on Steam...
---
And imagine this, buying for shit via Steam is buggy as hell .)
---
Funny, just this week after I reached lvl 50 and started doing SBQ events I had the Colossus spawn 3 times, I guess I was just lucky. (Trash loot though)
---
It‚Äôs happened to me for an entire year. I drop all notes and holotapes and have the bare minimum items in my inventory and it still lags like shit. It‚Äôs Bethesda shitty programming which makes it happen. No other game does this. Absolute sh*te and it will never be fixed.
---
Either that or there is an aggressively enthusiastic Mr Handy on the other side in a room with like 3 thousand filing cabinets.
---
Hey, we‚Äôre not as bad as that!
---
OP, to help with lead to add in your totals. (on a private server) . And you prob know this. But it'll help others.
---
1. Charleston firestation in the gym. (weights)
---
2. Monorail elevator (concrete and weights up at the top.
---
3. Site Charlie (weight room and then gtfo)
---
4. Site Alpha (see above)
---
5. Site Bravo (see above)
---
6. (optional) Palace of the winding bull shit where guided meditation takes place. (weights in locker room)
---
7. The Prison Yard (weights in the middle plus junk everywhere. Also tin cans alarm along right side next to church.)
---
Pick up 160 items (this resets what you picked up this includes the lead weights) rinse and repeat. This gives you about 470-520 (approx) lead per run. Basically if you pick up everything not tied down you can keep going.
---
Hope this helps and enjoy!
---
Which might be ok if it was the *only* trade-off for using PA.
---
or even made sense.
---
&gt;ok let me get into my exosuit powered armour, oh dear, it has made me too weak to carry everything I was just carrying.
---
Legacies are legendaries with effects that can't be dropped anymore.
---
all "Double" (not the double barrel, "double" legendary effect)
---
"Explosive" Cryolator, Flamer, Gatling Laser, Gatling Plasma, Gauss Rifle, Laser Rifle/Pistol, Radium Rifle, Tesla Rifle, Ultracite Laser Rifle/Pistol
---
any legendary :Dragon, ripper \*\*
---
recently : radium rifles and gauss rifles and harpoon gun explosives
---
and for some others
---
Ohhh my God when wouldn't it be nice comes on I lose my collective shit.......Such a good adventuring and killing song......Who would have thunk it?
---
&gt; "It really took the best of Fallout 4 and kicked it up by x*16*."  
---
FTFY
---
Because cork is the hardest to acquire junk item. Although some NPC vendors do in fact sell bulk cork, atleast. But it's still quite hard to come by. And the guy who did the math on the numbers vs the player numbers, the average cork one player is expected to bring in is about 400 cork or something like that. That's alotta cork.
---
where can you find the basement?
---
This would be awesome.  Even better if they let you get perks for building robot companions, plans to collect to improve them would be pretty sick.
---
If you want internal rooms with wallpaper on both sides you can place (certain?) walls with doors down and place them back to back. After they are placed you can use the replace feature to swap the door into a normal wall. Takes up a little more budget wise but it looks a lot better than having outside walls inside the house.
---
Also turrets take up a stupid amount of budget so if you can find a location with no enemy spawns you won't need them and can devote more to your asthetics. The most my base ever gets attacked by is the odd radstag or two and they mostly attack just to mess up my companion, I've had to replace just one wall so far over a few hundred hours in that spot.
---
Which is hilarious since backpack have it's own dedicated slot and can also be modded with food/chems weight reductions (that alone makes it superior). Meanwhile you need to sacrifice your mods on power legs to be on par with backpacks. Such fair trade off...
---
If non-pa users got jetpacks (which doesn't even require core fusions), PA users should get backpacks.
---
Yeah, you can still grind rep for both sides
---
Damn that sounds awesome...... Unfortunately I havnt yet been blessed with flaming chainsaw but I hope I run into it.......That chainsaw and an outfit that I can roleplay as Ash from Evil Dead in would be amazing
---
Thank you for bringing this up. Today has been a shitstorm with one shot wannabes spoiling it for everyone else. I get accidents. People just being asshats is another
---
SBQ twice yesterday and got the standard 2\* rolling pin and a 2\* zealots left leg, not much  better with the Imposter by getting a 3\* Mutants pipe pistol.
---
Yeh, you can still reach max rep from dailies.
---
Not doubting you but it definitely doesn't feel like there's 50 songs on the station.......Even with the classical station
---
If you get a free dinner and I get two free dinners, and we‚Äôre both full after the first one, that second free dinner wasn‚Äôt useful to me.
---
That‚Äôs a good thing to know , do you know how to make a circular house ?
---
Hunters Bounty. I just love the idea of getting extra caps and exp for crafting. Always selling mound of foo, good for making fertilizer too for explosives.
---
I think loot on the ground will respawn after 180 items are picked up.  Loot in a chest respawns after 60 or 80.  Its not a 24 hour timer.  For example, say you want cranberries.  Once you pick them, they will not respawn until you pick up 180 items.  Doesnt matter how much server jumping you do, of how long you wait (although there is speculation there is a weekly reset - unverrified AFAIK).
---
 I love Division 2, and I love DayZ... But I also love that F76 is standing in the middle. Please don't take the survival aspects away... Don't make it a pure looter-shooter... There's already plenty options of those. F76 has a unique niche. Invest in it, improve it... Don't kill it.
---
So often I find my self scrolling through a map with nothing to do.   Load into a couple in a row and you start thinking about other games to play.
---
Yeah, that's based off an integrally suppressed version of the Ruger Standard Mk-II used by the US Navy called the the Amphibian.
---
I go to west tek. To farm my the weapons they have since they carry good weapons instead of pipe pistols. I farm that spot maybe 3-4 times by server hopping. Usually get around 7-9 legendary enemies while I do that. I‚Äôm a obviously over encumbered so I waddle my way to the nearest train station. Put my hard bargain 3. Take a grape mentat (even if my charisma is 18 with unyielding)
---
And I sell the weapons to him. I always get the 1,400 caps. And I have a lot of leftover weapons that I just scrap.
---
Wtfü§Ø
---
The Botherhood are just raiders with better guns and armor. The whole B(o)S story rewards thing is already making my teeth itch.
---
Which one is that?.....How does the hook go?
---
There is basically no end game content worth doing and the SS armour etc is all waste of effort also
---
I have a Bloodied 1\* shovel and a Mutant Slayers 3\* with weight reduction.  All I need is a Zealots and a Troubleshooters and I am ready for battle.
---
Hey, you remember that SB fiasco? Yeah neither do I.
---
Pornhub and Harambe.......My dicks never gonna be put away again
---
It will become better with the new event, he will drop more stuff.
---
Did you not read the warning when you chose to side with raiders that you can't do the quests with the settlers? It tells you nice and clear, not sure how you missed it.
---
I'm not sure, also most of these required mats make no sense. Why do they need cork for?
---
New content is always a welcomed type of content in my view.
---
It would kill the market since so many have to use 100 modules (or more) to get that Unyielding left leg.
---
Nobody turns ore these days, everyone grinds the experience from mobs. I can't blame people.
---
They will probably post a daily update as the previous community clean Appalachia event.
---
I like it!! Even if you can't use it to feed your gun you can use it to craft .556 and just sell it for easy money.
---
It's worth 750 bullion
---
That sounds like an amazing idea, in general though not just for the event :P
---
I enjoy the sound of them exploding but don't like looking for the loot.
---
Same. I do my dailies and season tasks and then it's just a matter of sitting around hoping decent events pop up and sometimes they just don't. I can only do my farming runs so many times. I think I'm going to start doing more silo runs.
---
Not the same thing being on Steam and also having a community market.
---
And what are you talking about?, the service is fine, not perfect, but not "buggy as hell". I mean this is Fallout 76 subreddit cmon
---
The best way would be for Bethesda to sell junk and clutter packs in the atomic shop.
---
They could have all sorts of themes that would sell like hotcakes!!
---
I'm not sure why they need so much plastic either. I think cloth or lead would have made more sense.
---
You are 1,000,000% right. Give us the robots!
---
Uranium Fever should be renamed to Dickheads Fever, just sayin'.
---
I tho the leg 50+ carry weight mods were the equivalent of backpack
---
Thanks man, much appreciated.
---
I haven't been disconnected from the servers, but within 15 seconds of loading up my character and everything beginning (Rose's stupid message, sounds of inventory, overencumbered messages, etc.), everything freezes. The sound continues to play, like birds and weather and music, but nothing moves. I have to restart the entire console. Ove started other games just to compare and none of them do this besides FO76.
---
I wonder if it's connected?
---
Ya, 1 rank up or new card every 50 levels would be fair I think
---
The way the workshop works is the following. 
---
If a player is claiming a workshop that‚Äôs unowned, they have to pay caps and wait a little while for the bar to fill up so it can be claimed. If during that time another player walks in regardless if they have pacifist on or not, you will both be considered hostile towards each other. And the fighting begins. It could be you two fighting. Or if two other people join, regardless if they are on a team or not. They will be considered hostile as well and able to kill or be killed. 
---
Sometimes you‚Äôll see an event pop up ‚Äúdefend ____ workshop‚Äù that means it‚Äôs already been claimed by another person. However you COULD go and help them. Once the event is over. You guys WILL NOT be hostile or able to kill each other. You guys will both just be regular players.  HOWEVER if another person. (Meaning not you or the owner of the workshop) decides to run away immediately after the event and tries to claim the workshop. THEN every single player in the workshop area is considered hostile towards each other and you‚Äôll have no choice but fight. 
---
And the workshop labels were changed a long time ago. Now they appear on your screen as regular names. But if you try to fast travel to it, it will say ‚Äúcan‚Äôt fast travel to an unowned workshop‚Äù
---
Yeah literally. If they can absolutely smash the introduction of more in depth NPC factions and groups, even if they are smaller, I honestly think this tops fallout 4 for me, easily.
---
I didn't know that people love to buy 5.56. Bethesda must have gathered some fascinating statistics by observing this.
---
This, like the opening of Ahn'qiraj, is all about removing collected resources from player inventories. It makes a bit of sense, given how players like me add thousands (sometimes tens of thousands) of pounds of scrap per month to the scrapbox.
---
I think it just makes sense, but the hundreds of millions of cork needed are what got my attention.
---
It isn‚Äôt obvious? Clearly they are going to build giant wine corks the plug up the fissure sites and stop the scorchedbeasts from surfacing.
---
There are ways. There is always a way
---
They haven‚Äôt asked us to and they probably know *nothing about it*. We‚Äôre being tasked by a literal BoS fanboy to gather all of this crap so that he, presumably, can take all the credit.
---
I want a ‚Äò76 faction. I‚Äôd like to work for my own.
---
.556 was a currency in this game before a huge dupe wave this late winter and early spring. 
---
It used to be 1:1 cap ratio.
---
.556 and 45 are great sellers since so many use handmade rifles and Fixers.
---
*Members.*
---
I just use the rads to gauge how much I've collected, and then throw on sun kissed while I boil it up
---
I need someone like you on Xbox......I'm not stingy at all but I really needed acid for my first suit of PA so I took hemlock holes and set up shop......I'm level 35 my buddy I'm playing with is 17 and these two guys in like the 200's teleport to us and basically takes my acid farm over then locks me out of my own shit and it put me likes day behind in finishing my damn set .......The worst part is they both just sat on top of it basically waiting for us to initiate a fight so they could molest us with consent.......One even had that invisibility deal going......Bullies are assholes
---
Should, should, should.
---
I suspect new plans will be purchasable with bullion once reputation with BoS has been grinded, just like Raider and Foundation.
---
Merry Fasnacht, merry Fasnacht. Hip hip, hooray!!!
---
I think maybe op meant for camp building purposes. 
---
I know my kids make Minecraft be day time in creative mode so it's easier to see and such. Idk
---
3* Vampire Western Revolver is pretty hot.
---
Same exact story......Almost same exact level too......Always try to give back to lower levels as I was also gifted when just leaving the vault on my journey
---
The only possible way to fix this and all ‚Äúpublic event‚Äù is to make them instanced and each public group.. 
---
If there are 2 public group doing the event and group 1 does the event as intended and collect the ores.. while group 2 just exp farm. It won‚Äôt be fair to group 1 üòÇ 
---
So by making the whole thing Instanced like (a dungeons in wow/FFXIV) it will fix the problem

Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!
---
SBQ also drops stable flux and improved repair kits. Quick run (5 or so minutes) is easy resources. Long run gives a bunch of XP and possible legendaries on top of that
---
From what I learned from other players, besides it is so rare to spawn, it takes so much time, so much ammo and aid itens, that would actually bu super cool if there was a chance to drop a first ever 4 STAR equipment.
---
At release there was a thing where equipping a Brotherhood scope on a sniper rifle made it 4*. They patched that out a long time ago though
---
Technically it isn‚Äôt an mmorpg , it fall under an online rpg (similar time monster hunter)  but if you curious on mmorpg try our elder scrolls online or final fantasy XIV. 
---
Once you try an mmorpg you will understand why fallout76 isn‚Äôt one
---
What SPECIAL section is this in? I can‚Äôt spot it
---
What they say? I have no interest to watch season 2
---
Are we still surprise by the eng of this game after 2 years?
---
25 caps. Duped to hell.
---
Season 2 of what?
---
Ah, memories...A fortnight of spending a third of your play time walking around the same small square, one shotting the same low level enemies, missing out on the sole rubbish legendary kill, and receiving the same common masks by the dozen.
---
Those were the days...
---
Spoken like a true clerical worker.
---
I'm pretty sure you can tell how mumbles feels by the quality of drops we all get.
---
first of all, Purveyor Murmrgh is female.
---
second, if they didnt want people wandering around her basement, she shoulda locked the door
---
Yeah I would of thought as much. Thanks buddy
---
I have way stranger interactions in my IRL store.
---
pfft, nobody READS those warnings. havent you seen the posts from people who are upset that someone "griefed" them at a workshop?
---
Better/more thorough testing of rewards. Too many this season have been broken, too many CAMP items don‚Äôt work well with terrain. 
---
Replace NW daily with an Adventure challenge, but also add repeatable NW challenges‚Äîi.e.do damage to players, kill players, win matches. That would feel more like an optional challenge while also making sense in the mode. Sending people to NW to put a CAMP unit down 3 times just wastes everyone‚Äôs time.
---
Add a list of 10 difficult &amp; time consuming challenges, with 3 tiers each, that can be completed any time during the season. They should award 5-10k SCORE upon total completion as well as a unique perk that lasts until the next season starts. This would add more flexibility, break up the daily monotony and give players a way to catch up at their own pace. Unique perks is a callback to the New Vegas challenges, these should be similar to those, and gives people less interested in cosmetics a reason to participate. 
---
Ease up on splitting skin sets into multiple rewards‚Äîthe ghillie stuff and Atomic Onslaught paints. It felt cheap and lazy. Put those all in one reward and add more consumable rewards if you just don‚Äôt have the content. Lunchboxes have proven more popular than expected, nobody would be upset about getting more of them. 
---
Important items, like the ammo converter, should continue to be low rank rewards. This was an extremely positive thing to see in season 1. 
---
Most daily/weekly challenges have been a big improvement over the old system. Keep that up.
---
This worlds getting even shittier when people like you in the midst of all this negativity in the world wanna make a place to have fun worse by being a dick.......You deserve the downvotes
---
if you wanted to do both, why'd you go past the obvious point of no return and do 79 with the raiders before doing so?
---
Can you keep a secret?
---
Even better if you could command them to collect junk and legendary gear from dead bodies lol.
---
The shows called "how to sell drugs online fast"
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, no issues this morning. What system are you on?
---
I'm too bitter. Your hugs turn to wet ash within my grasp.
---
Can't remember word for word, but along the lines of "one of the biggest piece of crap ever made"
---
I always get the one with him sitting in his chair, you can call him 'backward'.
---
NOOOOOO!!!!!(Screams in Darth Vader)
---
There is not enough things to buy with gold.
---
securitrons are knly in New Vegas. do you mean the sentry bot?
---
I love it. Especially when you land that headshot and just the head explodes like the famous scene from the movie Scanners. Even more fun when you chain a few one-hit kills together in this way, it‚Äôs like a fireworks show of gore!
---
They can have all my cork and plastic, but no way are they getting my lead and steel.
---
Yeah the heads are satisfying it‚Äôs more when the whole body BUT the head explodes and then it all just floats there for a second
---
taking a shot in the dark here but im guessing the ones not in power armor will switch to hazmat suits and just do their regular thing. like Crater and Foumdation do.
---
This isn‚Äôt going to be like the last time, is it?
---
Shit......That sounds like a pretty gnarly disease that I do not want
---
Like your dicks all coughing and has the sniffles and shit
---
That‚Äôs nothing, just today I had the SBQ corpse somehow followed me to my CAMP when I spawned back in after the event.
---
I loved that gun in FO4. Now that I‚Äôm past level 50, I‚Äôm getting really frustrated at how poor the pistol choices are in this game. Seems like I‚Äôm going to be required to switch to a heavy weapon set up.
---
So do the bodies sometimes. I kinda like that too, now that you mention it - looting a suspended sack of body parts in midair until they Wile E Fox moment when they realize there‚Äôs gravity and fall into a pile of dead stuff.
---
the enclave is literally responsible for almost all of the terrible things in Appalachia.
---
Sofia showed up at fissure site prime once during a nuke, must have triggered this without knowing, was fun, followed her all the way back to camp :)
---
Make sure to do ALL the missions on both sides until each faction gives you a ‚ÄúSiding with foundation‚Äù or ‚Äúsiding with crater‚Äù
---
Once you see both of those quests on your pip boy, that means you‚Äôve done every single mission possible for them. And NOW you have to chose which faction to raid the vault with. As soon as you chose a quest, that will be your final decision. Meaning when you go talk to that person and tell them you‚Äôre ready, it automatically fail the other quest for the other faction. Meaning you can‚Äôt change your mind. But don‚Äôt worry, you can still buy ALL the plans for each faction, you just have to make sure you have the reputation needed in order to unlock the plan in the first place. 
---
I believe the raiders have all the gauss shotgun mods and the plan to build it, along with other stuff they sell, while foundation has the mini gun mods and plan to build it, along with the other stuff they sell. People seem to think that if you side with one faction, you‚Äôll be unable to purchase the plans from the opposite faction. That‚Äôs not true. You can buy every single plan from both factions. You just need to reach ‚Äúally‚Äù reputation to unlock everything for each faction. And obviously have enough good to buy it. 
---
The secret service has the gauss pistol mods and plan to build it, and all the extra stuff like the SS armor. Strangler power armor. And other stuff I can‚Äôt remember. However you don‚Äôt need to have reputation with the secret service. You unlock every purchasable option right away. 
---
Now time for ‚ÄúSpoilers‚Äù 
---
If you side with the raiders or foundation, the game doesn‚Äôt really change.  As in, all rewards can be obtained. Regardless of your choices. 
---
If you side with the raiders, and you manage to convince Ra-Ra to come with you, you can ask her to break into a room and you‚Äôll be able to obtain a 3 star legendary named plasma weapon. You can‚Äôt get this weapon if you side with foundation. You could get the weapon if another player is selling it. But unless you manage to buy one, or you are extremely lucky and manage to get a plasma legendary rifle with the exact same legendary effects from a random enemy. Then you‚Äôll never really have this weapon. I personally didn‚Äôt care since my build consist of unarmed, shotgun, or heavy guns. The gun was useless to me so I didn‚Äôt bother raiding the vault with crater. You also get a raider outfit at the end. That‚Äôs it. Nothing else comes from finishing the vault raid with them. 
---
If you try to raid the vault with foundation. The missions you do before the actual raid will reward you with the Chinese stealth armor. For FREE. You unlock the ability to craft the armor and the helmet for FREE. Just have to use your materials to make it.  However you do not get a legendary weapon. And just like the raiders, you get rewarded a foundation outfit at the end of it. 
---
Regardless of which side you raid the vault with. At the end you have to decide how you guys will be splitting the gold. You can keep the gold all to yourself. And you piss off the people that helped you. (Don‚Äôt worry, besides losing a little reputation that you can easily gain back doing random encounters) the faction will not become hostile towards you. The people at each faction will still talk you and you can still buy stuff from them. You still get daily quest from them to help you rank up your Reputation and give you treasury notes. 
---
You can chose to ‚Äúshare‚Äù the gold. And give 50% it the gold to the faction that helped you. You‚Äôll get a nice boost to the reputation. While a slight negative to the faction you didn‚Äôt raid the vault with. 
---
Or you can share the gold again, but this time giving 25% to each faction. You still keep the other 50%.  I don‚Äôt know if you lose any reputation for sharing with the opposite faction. Or if you get a boost for both of them. I haven‚Äôt tested out this third outcome. 
---
I personally think you should just be selfish and keep the gold to yourself. Because I don‚Äôt care what 2 NPC characters say or think of me. I rather get the gold which is a little harder to obtain, then simply doing a few daily quests, and helping each faction with random encounters to gain my reputation again. 
---
You DON‚ÄôT have to raid the vault with foundation in order to unlock the Chinese stealth armor. Just make sure you do the missions until you unlock the plan, that way IF you decide to raid the vault with the raiders and you decide you want the Chinese stealth armor, you don‚Äôt need to pay 4,000 gold to buy the plan for the outfit. And I believe another 350 gold for the helmet. 
---
Sorry for the long post.
---
All my homies hate the Enclave
---
This makes me sad because it is true.
---
When they explode at the top of a hill and the head comes rolling towards you.  You try and loot it but it keeps rolling so you follow it "hey, stop, come back here"
---
Im lvl 495 and still can pull a lvl a day. If I don't have time I just switch to my mule and run him for about 20 min.
---
You can sell them in your vendor for like 100-250 I‚Äôll say that‚Äôs atleast something
---
Or Chloe, who just throws it all away.
---
Because they know they got thousands of lemmings ready to deepthroat them for free, why not use em
---
Yeah! I once followed a rolling Super Mutant head for what seemed like miles. It was a longer route than Grahm‚Äôs!
---
Yes but i was in rush so i pressed x and completely skipped it lmao
---
I don't know if you're familiar with the USS Constitution's real world history, but the chances of it having been on the west coast in 2077 are virtually non-existent.
---
First of all, it‚Äôs MAM. 
---
A female mole miner. Jokes asides. Whenever I visit her i always see some guy hogging up then legendary script. And 2-3 other people trying to punch him or get in his way to tell him to hurry up. Another person trying to glitch this way with photomode to get in the same room with her. Or 2-3 people taking turns trying to get the legendary preserved pie. 
---
I have never gone to see her; and found the place empty. Besides private server of course.
---
I honestly like them a lot. I think the clearer glass is a lot better than the almost glowing white glass on the frog jar. Only things id change is maybe they gave of a little more light, and i wish the string holding it up was a bit thicker
---
playing on PC i take it?
---
When you try to be the good guy and use the ‚Äòfollow me‚Äô and they repay you by one shotting every other legendary... Only doing the event solo nowadays
---
"Ma'am," a shortened form of "madam."
---
Thank you. I‚Äôll never ever forget it.
---
You wake up with the 'lovers embrace' effect if you sleep in that bed.
---
Legendary chainsaws should be a thing
---
Don‚Äôt apologize for making this long, this helped me out a ton to understand how it all works and I greatly appreciate your effort! Thank you so much for taking the time to write this
---
I have one question though, I‚Äôve read that doing raider missions make you lose reputation with the settlers but it doesn‚Äôt work the other way around. Is this true and should I do the settler missions before I do raiders? Like is there any specific order to do them? Or should I do both of them at the same time until I get to the vault raid?
---
Had a player last night asking me for my resources, weapons, literally everything I could possibly give him for free. Finally started punching me so I would pay attention to him while I was crafting, so I just killed him after that. 3 failed raids on my camp later... thanks for the few hundred caps. Don‚Äôt understand why ppl are so pissed when they put themselves in situations where they‚Äôre the aggressor and lose because of it.
---
does your friend alao have an uncle who works for nintendo and is totally serious that Master Cheif is coming to smash bros?
---
Absolutely agree
---
üòÇ
---
This is on PC. Many apologies for forgetting to specify that from the get-go.
---
I am on Xbox and every time I go into the Whitesprings bunker I crash and so many other random times so who knows.  I have to restart the system so I use it for a break.
---
Legendary Boomstick Baby!!!
---
Really? I never see anyone up on top of the rocks. I know one person who is building a big build up here but I've never had any problems spawning in my camp up here.
---
That's some romantic shizz right there
---
I don't like floating camps either.
---
... saucage party reference? lol
---
It must take a hell of a lot more effort to build up to one shot her, than to just do it normally. So it's not even like they're doing it to save time/level quicker etc.
---
Or just remove NW challenges completely
---
You FO1st or reg? I used to have 800 of every junk item I usually needed. Now the max is 200 a junk item. All it takes is completing an achievement like ‚Äúmod 76 weapons‚Äù and my oil supplies get low fast. Usually never enough to drain my supplies, but the wrong quests in a row and I could be on empty
---
Now that's how you assert dominance
---
https://youtu.be/VpzPUmfv960
---
You can walk in through the walls while the camp loads
---
The way I understood it, the BoS aren‚Äôt the ones asking for it. This guy that‚Äôs currently at their future base is an uber fan of the Brotherhood and wants to impress them when he arrives. But it also wouldn‚Äôt be a Bethesda quest unless the npc‚Äôs were physically incapable of doing anything without us stepping in!
---
I met an unlimited melee range cheater today, who boxed the shit out of me from miles away, then got a laser rifle, shot upside to the sky, and killed 3 others...
---
And Bethesda says, there is no need for an anticheat software...
---
To the moon.
---
Some players build a character specifically for NW. if you‚Äôre into NW, consider that option.
---
posting from your phone I take it?
---
Change it to the lunch box confetti effect =)
---
There is some but not a ton. I wish tey had the pieces they had in Fo4 that were like a mix of wood and metal, they were prefab pieces that snapped together.
---
Hopefully the cursed prefix with the colossal problem event will be worth it. Sounds like it may at least rival A tier weapon prefixes. Could be a counter to bloodied builds.
---
I would much prefer camp based rewardsinstead of the power armour ones we're getting at the moment. Power armour to me is redundant now since wastelander update
---
The game got a lot better when they toned down the ability to PvP just anyone, also the Legendary season gives the game more purpose even though many people bitch about the grind.  If anything it did give us the team play.
---
Im tickled pink, lets go suning, johny guitar, ain't that a kick in the head and big iron are missing and that is what i can remember off the top of my head.

You are welcome
---
The Brotherhood of Beer will stand strong against the BoS infidels!
---
(Well, they'll stand slightly unsteadily, and maybe sway a bit.)
---
Do you have any idea what may have caused it?
---
I mean the reward itself is ok, but they used the same paint theme for a bunch of different prizes. It really should have been 1 reward and you get them all.
---
I really really wish they would take the legendaries dailies out they are so stressful. yes, I could do 3 SBQs and get it, but that is a lot to time and coordination. I could roam around for 3 hours and not find a single legendary. it feels too random imo
---
They were available for gifts/pails. I ended up with 2 extra (after my alts learned it, along with my wife‚Äôs main). But since the gifts were duped quite a bit, most of the plans became devalued. 
---
I‚Äôd say between 10-100 caps, depending on the buyer.
---
I understand why it can‚Äôt be a 3* every time, but the difficulty of the creature we‚Äôre fighting should scale the odds of it being a better items. Why am I just as likely to get a bss +s Powerfist from killing a 3* ghoul as I am the SBQ or Colossus??
---
üëèüòÇüòÇüòÇ

I‚Äôve had that happen but don‚Äôt know how.

Some BoS Scribe just jerking Russell's chain.

"..and then I told him 'yeah, we'll *definitely* need 200 million... corks? CORKS. Yes - corks for the Cork God!' Stupid townie."
---
Mary has been visiting events all around the map today with her pipe pistol.. rewards from 2 legendary scorchbeasts and 1 normal one in the bag 
---
Also took out a couple of level 40 blood eagles when recovering wards osmosis kit  that he seems unable to secure.
---
This is so much fun..
---
Yeah, it would be nice to finally get that 4th star. We'll be getting an event to force the spawn of the colossus soon.
---
100% agree. Its just lazyness on their part especially unlocked 8 ghillie suits haha. If they did to a camp based one they'd have to pull their finger out as they couldn't just reskin them all like that have done with the current rewards. Or could they? Never know with Bethesda.
---
Just a damn shame how far they have fallen since elder scrolls oblivion days.
---
When you almost finished clearing an area and found a glowing one. "Welp, here we go again"
---
Well, that "r" could have been another "c" and then we've got a whole other thing going on... Ad Victoriam!
---
All I want is Dogmeat back.  The immortal version.  In fallout 3 I just ended up keeping him at home since he died a lot.  What a good boy though.
---
To my knowledge and experience since I already beat wastelanders and reached ally for both of them. 
---
Whenever you do raider missions. You will never ever lose reputation for foundation. And also the other way around. 
---
If you happen to see the settlers and raiders fighting each other out in a random spot. They will both be friendly towards you. You can watch them fight it out. Or you can help a side kill the other team. After you kill the other team, or simply watch it happen. Make sure you talk to the team that won  They will thank you for helping them in the fight. And give you a nice reputation boost for helping them.  The only time I saw that you lose reputation, is when you bump into a raider and you talk to him. Sometimes you‚Äôll see the option to tell him/her to go cause trouble at foundation or to go and kill/raid settlers. Only when you select that option, will you see a negative stat to foundation. That she been the only way to damage your reputation against foundation that I‚Äôve found so far. Besides obviously not sharing the gold with them when I raised the vault with crater on one of my characters. 
---
Whenever you do missions for Davenport (the robot at the overseer‚Äôs house) he will ask you to take pictures of the raiders at crater. Or the people at foundation. Once you take the pictures you will have an option to bring the pics back to him to collect your reward. OR give the pictures to the opposite faction. So if you took pics of crater. You can go to foundation and give it to them. If you took pictures of foundation you can give it to the people at crater. You‚Äôll get reputation for the people you turned the pictures to. And no negative outcomes for the people you sold out basically. However when you go back to Davenport to turn in the pics. He will get furious that you sold the pics and the quest will end without giving you a reward. Unless you have unyielding armor; or you take enough chems/food to increase your charisma. You can lie to him and say that the pictures were stolen. He will not get mad. And still reward you. Regardless, that‚Äôs a daily quest you can. I personally sold the pics to crater and foundation until I didn‚Äôt need to anymore. And the I started to actually give the pics back to Davenport.
---
Theres a pretty solid chance the plans will be in the donor gifts you get for donating materials to the BOS when the new update drops. Weapons and Armor plans from previous events will be in the loot table
---
This is why I stopped playing games on PC. I've become a console exclusive gamer because of the rampant cheating. Now I don't play anything that has cross play in it.
---
You‚Äôll hear people claim that Ultracite Laser Rifles have a higher rate of fire, but that is only true if you use it as a Semi-Auto. 
---
Ultracite Laser Rifles with fully automatic barrels have the same fire rate as regular Laser Rifles, do less damage, have a smaller ammo clip size, cost more materials to repair, and are much harder to learn mods for. 
---
They desperately need a buff so they match the placement of the Ultracite Gatling Laser. The Ultracite Gatling Laser does more vase damage than a standard Gatling Laser.
---
I did have all the treasure from a scorchbeast mysteriously fall from the sky when I fast traveled somewhere. It was fascinating to see that there are models for each of the items you usually see only in a meat pile or paper bag, including scorchbeast brain, small ammo cans, and other weird items.
---
It‚Äôs exactly 76 Mr. Gutsys accompanied by Bessie the Sentry Bot from Wayward, and all the Gutsys are shouting at their share of the technical data like a drill sergeant.
---
Never heard of that show, anyway I get my drugs free from dead scorched. There's always a dealer, oddly usually they have s grenade launcher too.
---
I appreciate it lol
---
id say poor corporate management.  its almost as if someone higher up wants this title to fail so they make all these terrible decisions &amp; then demand the understaffed programmers figure it out
---
Exactly.  20 of the prizes currently are about 1/5 of the total prizes. What if you don't wear PA or want to use ghillie paint?? Not much of an incentive to work for score.
---
But to level up the cards is account bound are requires a heavy grind... to infinity with the current cap to level all 6 of your cards in the level 1000+
---
It reminds of the slot that is in some older houses where men used to put there razors. So who ever opens that wall gets an avalanche of old rust razor blades.
---
I will absolutely keep it secret just after I post it here.
---
I second this. There has been plenty of times in the two years I‚Äôve been playing where I was playing and doing everything in the event and somebody kills legendary quick and I get no legendary. It should never be like that. If you work on the event and do everything you are supposed to. It should be obvious that you should get the reward
---
K9 buttcheeks?
---
Ya, I like the idea. Have stuff that gives night vision, water breathing, hydration, targeting.
---
normal day in retail
---
Thought that was the case
---
It would have decayed faster than we could stockpile it.
---
XP = SCORE currently. Youd be surprised how many 400+ level characters are XP farming
---
There is a .75% chance that you will learn a mod when scrapping (see [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=60244728)). How many pieces have you scrapped?
---
No shit.  I had 4 extras from gifts.  The holiday event alone caused the value of them to drop from like 40k down to maybe 1 to 2k overnight.  Held onto them thinking they would be an easy couple thousand caps or good for trading when I needed them eventually.  Was very wrong about that LMAO.
---
Waking up was worse. At least in the dream I still had one lol
---
Yeah that would be awesome. Maybe his thing you place down is a bone fire that he worships at
---
Day 1: goal accomplished.
---
Day 2: goal doubled 
---
Day 3: slowed down. Only 2.5x goal
---
Is that picture quest repeatable/farmable? Can I keep triggering the quest and turn the pictures to the other faction to farm rep or is there a limit?
---
just reload an earlier save and play it again
---
Yeah but then youd have people who join an event and do nothing, and its not like you can pvp or kick them out too.
---
They said they just implemented logging system and looking to possible ways to fix that. Now let's just wait another year or two.
---
Some people lock their vendors off when they are at cap limit, then open up later when they can take on more caps.
---
You lose hardly anything for fighting them. This isn‚Äôt a full loot survival game. Different if you were low level with no chance but I wouldn‚Äôt think twice at 210
---
I hear that, not a bad idea, but I started NW with my main, and now I‚Äôm over 200 lvl with it in NW. I want to keep building on that for the fun of it.
---
I guarantee you that man came out of the vault with a Gatling gun and has used nothing but heavy weapons since the game came out in November of 2018.
---
He was just REALLY desperate that time.
---
Daily quest.
---
Oh I see, thank you
---
Never tried PTS but if what they say about the wendigo boss is true, bloodied builds should now be having a hard time with the fear skill the boss has.  
---
Honestly, bloodied builds should be nerfed by having SBQ never go outside the nuke zone too.
---
didn't know that was an issue, then again I'm only level 47.
---
Time for a sad moment.
---
Given how old that movie is, and that the dog was at least a few years old during filming.
---
That dog is dead by now.
---
It would‚Äôve made more sense to just have a new military faction
---
I use a TS (1*) Tesla. Works wonders and I just let others clean up
---
At that point it‚Äôs not really a ‚Äútrap base‚Äù, though, isn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs just a base with defenses where necessary.
---
INK FOR THE INK GOD!
---
At that point I honestly may have just picked the locks and attempted to speed browse the plans. 300 is a number that‚Äôs hard to pass up.
---
Bethesda wants us to collect billions of resources for a self entitled militaristic cult of thugs that only takes care of themselves. Fuck that
---
It's not my fault that bethesda's "Backpack Vanity update" broke many of the backpacks. 
---
Before that update my Red Shift backpack sat neatly and without any clipping issues on my characters back when wearing the Communist spy outfit. Now the backpack goes inside my characters back and shoulders, like it grows out of my characters flesh.
---
Also if bethesad can fix the normal backpacks while adding PA backpacks, then that is fine too!
---
On pc you can disable the chunkification in your custom ini.
---
Lazy lazy lazy
---
I believe the flamer is bugged. Just keep a shishkebob with you. It‚Äôs lighter anyway :)
---
One thing that really helped me out was when someone told me ladders stairs etc can be used to sort of defy physics. If you are on really uneven ground start with a ladder then build upper level floor  tiles of of it and use that as your starting point. Gets you up above potentially house breaking ground.
---
What's weird is that we have perk cards that explicitly show 1 handed SMGs and machine pistols, *yet we have no native guns like that in the game itself*. Where's my Uzi, Bethesda? Hell its first prototype was even made in 1950.
---
Apparently flames work in other players but you have to bash npcs.
---
The colossus is the best screw farm in the game bar none.  Let it spawn wave after wave of screw carrying wendigo and you're set for whatever it is that people use screws for that I haven't figured out yet.
---
That fissure site is closed off now.  Still has the green glow but you can walk on it.
---
I like the nuclear winter challenges. I never went there until SCORE.   Now I go at least once a day to do challengess. I‚Äôm finding it fun surprisingly
---
interesting. i never knew this
---
Why does that not surprise me
---
Yeah, I love NW, I just hate that I can‚Äôt run a perception build there and a melee build in adventure at the same time.
---
What I don't get is why we care about these weaklings?  They were wiped out by the scorched.  You know, those things we slaughter without thought, and who's big bad leader I killed 3x before breakfast yesterday.
---
I really don't see why we give 2 fucks about them.  They came, they sucked, they died, they became scorched.  We came, we conquered, and we survived.   They can go back to hiding in their bunkers for all I care.
---
*Any available men and women should proceed to the chosen... Bot Stop site.*
---
Could be your ISP/region/traffic.  Too many people, during a busy time, with a, not so good, ISP.
---
I have a bloodied 2 handed malee build, and do about 1,340 damage each hit. I‚Äôm level 105 but if you need any help still lmk
---
Ah that‚Äôs good to know i had to rebuild a entire mini village because of that glitch
---
Yeah at high levels with a good build/weapon you can kill it in 3 seconds
---
Fasnacht was what got me into the game. Love that event
---
problem is there are just 3 set weapons with that prefix that can drop as loot from the event chest. From the forum: "A Executioner's Faster Fire, Weightless Harpoon Gun, a Executioner's Swing  Speed, Weightless Shovel, and a Bloodied Power Attack Weightless Pickaxe." ....so I doubt that there's any 'counter' to bloodied builds.
---
Oh I know. Thing is that with that high of a level doing the level up daily will get you the repeatable multiple times already. 
---
It is just a bit annoying that I always kinda get forced to collect ore because I don‚Äôt use a heavy weapon or commando build so I just can‚Äôt tag things fast enough. Everything just has to die faster and faster and faster. I kinda get it in RR but did that legendary Scorbo just before the queen really need to die in five seconds?
---
True. I haven‚Äôt tried it yet, but I could probably craft a non-legendary pipe rifle and still one-shot most things on my commando. The build is everything in this game
---
So you don‚Äôt see red smoke anywhere?
---
This is a difficult spot to build in especially if you don‚Äôt want to do the subterranean glitches.  In order to get both resource nodes you have to place your camp halfway up the cliff.  In order to make it so people aren‚Äôt spawning inside the cliff you‚Äôll need to move your camp device somewhere else after (I have mine on the upper rock near the lead extractor.).  
---
It took a while to get my camp getting the ‚Äústuck to the side of the cliff‚Äù look.  I‚Äôve got two supported platforms going to the lower part of the camp. My vendors are on the upper level on the smaller rock overlooking the lead extractor. The biggest problem I have is I ran out of budget :(
---
If you are on PC you can stop by and take a look.  Tag is rgordonjr.  Normally on in the evenings PST.
---
Hm. No one's made the 1:5 joke yet?
---
m8, contact bethesda. issue a ticket.
---
maybe your char crash during a save/load state and the crash may have corrupted that save file
---
:/
---
Damn son where were you when i was struggling to find that fixer lol
---
You want me to sleep in the communal bed? The one peasants use? I want the one with the soft, expensive sheets, man...
---
Yes. And to be able to join them. Sick of 90% of things being enemies. Let us join them for christ sake.
---
That's interesting, I tossed my consoles because I didn't like having an appliance with no controls I could reach. Taking away PS3 ability to run alternate OS was the beginning of the end for me.
---
Like with a lot of Bethesda items, they‚Äôre probably testers for a long term solution. Same way that Skyrim‚Äôs homestead became our current camp system.
---
Unlikely they‚Äôll introduce such useless items that probably wasted a lot of internal time to figure out and not abuse the hell out of it long term haha
---
Exactly. None of them rewards faze me, tbh only thing that keeps me going on it is the lunchbox rewards. Xp for everyone and some good bonuses
---
Reported that exact player yesterday even though I'm pretty sure report feature does jack all and goes straight into the recycle bin.  You would think the same person being reported by 50 people every day for cheating would flag something in their system and they would take action but I expect I will see him next week, and the week after, and.....
---
I'll be damned!  When did that happen?
---
Either way, I was C.A.M.P.ed in this location about a month ago and the fissure site got nuked.
---
You can glitch from freddy fear's house of scares into vault 79 where you can repeatedly farm a 3star sentry bot
---
The first one is magic, so you don't even need to spec for it. In fact you really don't need to spec into Shotgun for either of those to be effective. Just some radiation and demo expert and it will one shot most things without a single shotgunner card.
---
If I have one on me it‚Äôs either that or use the 10mm to tag legendaries in group events.
---
that info that tamed creatures used camp budgt apparently was not correct. I tamed a deathclaw while I coundnt even place a light bulb at my camp.
---
but since wastelanders came out I was unable to tame anither creature. while others have claimed the same some people have proof that they were able to tame creatures post wasteland.
---
so we are in the middle of a limbo here brother. You and I both cant. some people can. and I have no clue ehat to do.
---
They are connected, Mothman Cultists say stuff about bringing people the gift of the woods, and one of the names for the Interloper is the First Born of the Wood. There are also tape recordings left by Mothman Cultists that say they feel the Interloper calling them through dreams.
---
If you are unyielding character with healing factor, take a rad-x and the glitch will go away
---
Mine did it once. Had to go to the location and nothing appeared for 10 mins then all of a sudden I heard the engine of the drone I was looking for the crate for 10 min but it wasn't even their till the drone eventually appeared
---
I can shred 20 enemies without breaking a sweat, but would definitely get raped by three gunners use my tactics.
---
And don't get.me started on how terrifying those synth patrols were... You heard them speaking and it was like: OK, let's kill one and run the fuck away from here...
---
They need to do account-wide plan system which will be available let's say at lvl 50 so questing will be ok. They could even make quest to find holotape with this system and bring it back to personal terminal on your base. Ah, another brilliant idea which not be implemented.
---
Clickityclickityclackclickclickclickclickclackityclick
---
Two hours later:
---
+12 .45 rounds
---
So you created a bunch of weapons you had no intention of using and that you knew you couldn't trade. Huh.
---
Really? Too many posts where Steamers didn't get the atoms or F1st wasn't delivered.
---
And because it's the fo76 sub, we see the complains and the lacksydaisy "support" from Beth, and not the filtered reviews on Steam .)
---
How can you say the "service is fine" when both steam and beth point fingers at each other when the bought goods don't show up? The player is left frustrated out in the rain w/o any other option than charging back.
---
Oh and woe to those who had Fo76 prior to the steam release and linked the accounts (or have gotten the wrong accounts linked by beth), they have 2 atom-wallets...
---
As for the community market, there are already so many places for dupers to offload their shit, it's not even funny, so it's also nothing to write home about.
---
If you have an excess of flux, serums sell upward of 500 caps each to venders
---
It was closed out when Foundation went in.  There are four or five others that I‚Äôve seen in the lower part of the map (marked and unmarked) like that.
---
PC also. I haven‚Äôt had dc issues in weeks and run with stable Ethernet. Yesterday I got disconnected like 5 times. Very annoying.
---
Life should be hard at your level. Stay in the forest. Use whatever weapon or armor you find. Scrap all non legendary weapons and armor to learn mods. Farm purified water for caps. Until you reach over 50 everything is disposable anyway.
---
Interesting I've waited at mine for almost and hour looking for it and nothing
---
Damage is too good. Immersion gets too ruined.
---
Yes, I tried without results time ago, a friend has tame one a month ago, today he lost it and we was looking for one and I noticed I can't so it
---
Nowhere and most of ut is open land so it's not in trees
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Jesus dude, I was about to give up after 10 min haha. Never mind a hour
---
The SS helmet needs some kind of buff to justify the ridiculous amount of bullion required for it.
---
Was playing the other day and found deezers lemonade stand and then as I‚Äôm checking it out here comes the observant radstag . Well deezer doesn‚Äôt fight back and I watch that radstag mule kicking that robot for a solid 20 minutes .
---
I have an I3325 .44 pistol that works very well with my bloodied gunslinger
---
Racing to do perks before the match sucks and every time I go back to NW I have to do it.  For some reason every time I go from NW back to adventure it resets me to all default cards because  "special is not high enough for equipped NW perk cards" ....uhhh, yeah it is because I was able to equip them.
---
Not a big deal unless I get dumped into a lobby where it's 20 seconds to deployment but still annoying as hell.
---
Well I was gonna start farming them but the first three where none existing
---
You know it would be just 8 different ghillie tables and chairs right?
---
Yeah they really need to implement a shared stash somehow, especially as, if wastelanders is anything to go by, all future weapons and armor will be non tradeable. Given how hard it is to roll the right weapon for your characters build it's heartbreaking when you roll something great on the wrong character.
---
Sorchbeasts and mothmen count as well.
---
I usually make diluted chems or treasure hunter outfits.
---
Glad I wasn't the only one who cringed during that episode. Lol.
---
An instigating western revolver can destroy most opponents. I have one with a vats build and events like Line in the Sand are a blast: headshot after headshot.
---
It is the perfect sidearm for every situation.
---
I want one that collects electrical junk like fuses, sensors, magnets, etc. and maybe the occasional laser weapon.
---
True, I got mines a while back and I was disappointed that‚Äôs it‚Äôs just a gas mask with flash light that‚Äôs looks kinda cool.
---
Perhaps
---
A friend of mine had this happen since friday, turns out that his camp had some shop-items placed that he didn't buy himself. (The original Dome and a blueprinted scrap-bot.)
---
Luckily he could resolve the issue with the support (so he claimed), they deleted the Dome, the Blueprint, and gave him a warning for exploiting.
---
I'd love to not have to use stealthboys, but as long as people a crutching VATS theyll continue to be used.
---
They're double dipping the ghillie rewards too, the camo for the Secret Service armor is already applied to the ghillie underneath and being sold in the atom shop. We'll likely see the other camo paints be sold aswell in the future.
---
Wait, do we need to collect bone, too?
---
By possible, I mean, all of the code is already in there and they just need to flip a bit.
---
Having this exact same issue on Xbox since around 2pm yesterday.
---
*Brotherhood of Spirits is the better BoS
---
"Oh sure, let's abuse the robots"
---
No ideas or suggestions. But I just wanted to share.
---
After more than a month looking for a tameable creature I finally managed to get one back to my camp. A two star legendary attack dog. Players who are familiar with the pet mechanics, know what a unicorn that is.
---
Now I can never turn my vending machines on because I know somebody will kill him.
---
For reference, I found him at the cranberry glade in the bog.
---
Why are you salty? lol, I just want a feature because I think it can be a positive thing for the game's lifespan, and I wasn't even serious. Create another post for your out of place aggresive complaining.
---
It's a slippery slope when you have to ask the next question though, how is this randstag able to comprehend what the robot is telling him or showing him? I've kicked this around a bit, only to arrive at the conclusion that it's a synthetic randstag.
---
 
---
I guess there's a couple of different places you could go from there. Either somehow it came out of Arktos, or there's someone who will later join or found the synth program at the Institute.
---
He did say he was bored *shrugs*
---
Been playing long enough I get bored and just test my luck. I have 5 characters which all already have weapons that are set for them. I dont know how long you've been playing but eventually it gets boring with the same grind.
---
Because I'm probably overloading Beth's servers with just my stash of bone shards alone.  Time to cull everyone's supplies!  And here's your new player icon!
---
We do now
---
Have you tried just doing it then coming back later? I think it tells you with a yellow marker when its there to be picked up. The yellow circle with no marker means its not there.
---
Yeah, best game for the two super nerds of the show is God of War, the worse is FO76.  I also  liked this serie.
---
Murm gave me a be25 double barrel shotty and a b25+p pipe pistol today so we back on speaking terms
---
I missed it since the day it ended
---
PvP in this game has a lot of potential. But with the top 3 metas maining cheesy ass builds, it'll never grow beyond what it currently is. In order to save the PvP in this game, they'd have to make a completely separate mode with no character transfers, only allow 1* legendaries and prevent aid spamming. Sadly this will probably never happen because the vast majority of the player base is so anti-pvp, its toxic.
---
Pretty sweet man
---
Is the mole miner in the basement her husband? Or is he a prisoner? üòÇ
---
Hopefully with One Wastelnd comes levelled Fasnacht, assuming the game lasts to that point :-)
---
I just did this today. Found a great new camp spot with a great view. I assumed I needed a plan for the excavator first. Didn't realize you just need a deposit in you camp to allow you to build it. Thanks for your advice.
---
Dimwitt27 is one of them. One shots everything under lvl 50 because the legendary is worth nothing anyway
---
Hmm I'll try that
---
You were bored so you crafted untradable weapons you have no intention of using? I don't see how that would help your situation.
---
Yeah I'm still testing this out, I've watch several videos on this and still havent seem to get it to work for me constantly and it seems that no matter what the first shot in vats always misses. Maybe because I need to charge while in vats or is it before vats? I dont know, still requires testing. The bloodied ones do over 600 damage as is already so specing my guy for shotguns would make a massive difference I know.
---
Meatloaf - the singer and not the food.
---
It‚Äôs only limiting because that‚Äôs what you want it to do. You aren‚Äôt taking criticism and ideas to fledge our the idea. I‚Äôve made suggestions on how to change it and you just don‚Äôt want it that way. Everyone would just not bother with it the way you‚Äôre suggesting to set it up. The way you want it I could see everyone just hitting general store and not bothering.
---
I read that as "Fallout asshats staff"
---
If it's locked that just means free xp
---
I'll look for you.

---
This one?
---
What you are saying about the fear skill is definitely true, since it breaks stealth but I don't think having the SBQ not leave the nuke zone would keep bloodied builds from getting to her.
---
We need that gun and the 9mm
---
Containers is a seperate counter, lower number, 80 I think.
---
It's bugged and decreases carry weight by 10
---
Judgmental much?
---
That was my attitude after launch, so disappointed. I came back a month ago and am really happy I did
---
Also the single window on the brick walls can be jumped through.
---
This game is running out of fire.
---
You haven‚Äôt provided any suggestion or basis to your claim, only criticism. It should be understood criticism without a basis, or suggestion; contributes little if anything at all.   
---
      
---
I can not prove a negative.
---
Hey man everything gets used no matter what just depends on how I feel I want to play that day. I just feel the non tradeable part of this is slightly ridiculous especially on the account part. Like I said I'm high enough level I change him to a shotgunner build right now. But be honest you dont get bored of the grind sometimes? I just wanted to test my luck. Sorry if that grinds your gears buddy.
---
Off to the Wendigo Cave every couple hours then!
---
Not touching 1st, full regular here. But yeah, I also don't really bother with directly going for achievs like that...
---
Having issues with Disconnects as well on PC
---
I don't mind the level up challenge...it's the stupid "buy 3 things from another player" challenge that annoys me. Not everyone likes to waste their caps on things they don't need.
---
maybe its not the game for you?
---
I‚Äôm at easy goto death claw island kill that level 21 claw then go to a fissure site kill a scorch beast. Then wait for sheep sqautch event or go where mirelurk queen spawns. Then bam done
---
I would be alright even if they make it like an hour time limit that you need to withdraw the weapon from the stash just so it's not a stash that people use regularly.
---
Yes, this is 100% better.
---
I got myself a Berserkers 50 DR whilst aiming and a 10% damage bonus whilst aiming. 
---
Not sure how good it is though lol
---
[Or...?](https://gfycat.com/ru/thissamecockatiel)
---
I always check ammo machines you‚Äôd be surprised the number of people that lock the bin but not the terminal. A number of people have come back to their camp only to find the machine making gamma rounds instead of something useful.
---
He just wanted to farm xp with the least amount of people there. Not stupidity. Just selfish and smart about it
---
Yeah I feel berserkers are used by a small specialized few players. I mean running around with little to no armor can mean quick deaths if your build isnt just right.
---
Oh no? It's not like people overprice their stuff anyway and caps are pointless end game.
---
I mean, technically it will be autocompleted. But by the dupers that just got unbanned, not by the challenge/score bug
---
I completely agree about it being stuff of mobile games.
---
The timegating should not be here or to this extent.
---
It makes it feel like a chore after a while, the constant need to login everyday.
---
IIRC the East Coast Brotherhood doesn't leave California for another 140 to 150 years, still got a chuckle from the post.
---
That's not the platform problem. Its a game publisher problem. Normal publishers do fight cheaters and you rarely see them at all and they don't really affected your experience. Well, not Bethesda, publishers like Bethesda give zero fucks what going on in their game.
---
I've just been making new characters. At least this is slightly less cancerous than it used to be with the 0/3, you needed to make sure to wear a specific outfit and use a specific weapon while leveling up or else you'd need to level up a second time if you wanted those 10 precious atoms. They got rid of those god awful camera challenges and alcohol crafting ones, now we just need to get rid of the leveling ones and it will be bearable
---
This is golden. This was what I was looking for.
---
The equipment I had planned on using was the following:
---
- Unyielding/Poison Resist/Sentinel left and right arms, hopefully anything but Secret Service because the secondary mods lack access to Ultra-Light Build, Deep Pocketed, or anything appealing. Of course, if all else fails, I can fall back on SS because it has plenty of built-in DR/ER/RR (but I'll have the pain of building it and praying with every roll). (If someone on xbox sees this message and has a left arm, let me know. Been spamming the LFG for a week.)
---
- Unyielding/Powered/Sentinel chest, left and right legs. This would give ~140 RR (or ~191 RR after Buttressed).
---
- Armor Plated (or, possibly, Lead Lined) Backpack.
---
Then swap into some solid Emergency Protocol Power Armor for anything serious (i.e. SBQ). Probably T-51, or maybe a mixed set to get good numbers across the board.
---
I'm fine with abusing my Bloodied Gauss since it has the "magic" effect of 33% VATS hit chance and seems to do just fine without damage perks. One day I'll either have to invest in it or put it away, but Bethesda works slow. I can focus more damage into Commando and hopefully get a decent roll on a Laser Rifle (as close to ZeroAP as is possible, these days). 
---
What do you think?
---
Yeah agreed, I die enough with armor as it is lol
---
That was happening to me too. You can't skip any of his dialog when you turn in the mission. Then it should give it to you. If you skip then you don't get the rep points for some reason
---
And just to add on I never said I had no intention of using these weapons or that I cant use the weapons. All I said was that my character is not build for it currently.  There's a difference between all of them.
---
Having to grind longer as a high level player is not a challenge, it's a chore. Killing a deathclaw with boxing gloves, now that's a challenge. That one was fun, too bad they allowed you to also use a fat man for it
---
I really hope that making pets immune to other players damage is included in the "new pet mechanics"
---
So I guess I do have a suggestion.
---
Yea at one point I thought they fixed it. Now it‚Äôs worse than before.
---
How did he kill u?  Can‚Äôt cause u damage unless u are wanted or fired back.
---
If it was possible, they'd be more valuable as wallpaper.
---
I had no idea it was the singer's name! I thought it was some kind of ethnical joke like they did with most of the characters in that movie. 
---
Thank you for clarifying!
---
The first or 2nd time?
---
I wouldn't say it's zero fucks. They straight up told people with dozens of hacked weapons that they are on a "final warning" without even an inventory wipe. It's not just a passive nothing, they are outright telling cheaters they can get away with whatever they want
---
The first.
---
It's been happening to me so often this week, I got tired of it and switched to using a private server the past couple days. I go to Adventure to shop at people's camps for the challenge, then switch out immediately after. Feels a little empty, but I get all the legendaries I need and events are actually a challenge for once.
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs a creature nearby, but now it‚Äôs just random and in most cases definitely nothing.
---
Step out of the vault, look for an event with someone at it, fast travel to it, AFK a couple minutes.  Challenge done.  Delete character.
---
and doesnt cost ammo!
---
They're gonna corner the market and flip 'em for caps.
---
Interesting, I‚Äôll try that. So rad-x is the fast travel ticket now.
---
I picked up a quad western from a vending machine last week, haven't gotten around to using it yet but it seems really fun. All I can think of is the revolver from bioshock with that hilarious conveyor belt
---
Seeing as all the future updates for the rest of the year will be bringing the BOS back, you can expect to see BOS bundles in the Atomic Shop. Be patient for the Enclave faction updates, the items you seek will come then.
---
Nope, was walking back to watoga when i noticed her active quest marker was near me, and not in  my camp
---
You aren‚Äôt invincible in a survival tent FYI
---
Get better internet?  Not experienced it on Xbox at all and PS4 should be the same. Unless I‚Äôm missing something it can only have been a poor server, which you‚Äôd have changed server and been fine, or your internet.
---
Yeah i was wanted cause i wanted to see if you got wanted for lockpicking a base. I am less so upset about the first one. Im just mad about that survival camp bs
---
I want a miniature BOS cargo airship following me around on a tether.
---
Its either we bring it to them voluntarily for a few trinkets.... or they take it from our dead hands.  Either way, the BoS will get their cork.
---
Well then how did he not take any dammage when i unloaded a bloodied 50 cal machine gun into him....
---
Yes I use them in the middle of battle but repair with artisan can make them to 200% condition.
---
If I see 30+ weapons it usually means they have 30+ shit weapons no one wants, I only sell wanted/quality items the rest just gets scripped/sold/junked, I always want magazines/junk, but I found my TSE [50.cal](https://50.cal) for 1500 caps at a vendor with only 2 weapons and nothing else for sale, so don't discount low amount of items in someones vendors you might get a good surprise.
---
It's supposed to be added on Tuesday, assuming nothing crazy happens with the Patch due then.
---
I‚Äôll be honest I didn‚Äôt realise it gave invincibility. Now I know that‚Äôs getting used when some knob tries to pvp me lol
---
This is actually an amazing idea
---
3 one cap bullets.
---
Goes pew pew
---
Because they ARENT FUCKING HERE AND WE NEED TO PREPARE A PLACE FOR THEM SINCE THEY'RE GOING TO WEST VIRGINIA FROM FUCKING CALIFORNIA
---
I get that a lot. 
---
I‚Äôve moved over to The Mechanist recently. And my camp Ally (Grampa) is wearing the Pint-Sized Slasher outfit and head.
---
\^\^\^ this
---
Correct, those are like atom store items.
---
What part of mowing down feral ghouls en masse is challenging, though?
---
Patch 21, which is set for August 4th.
---
That is a source, thank you.
---
And also makes it hard to find to loo which is why I shut the chunking off in the ini.
---
I just wish the light on the marine and combat helmets worked
---
The settlers of Foundation are just a little too willing to murder anyone in their way.  The raiders are just asshole-y enough, but they're supposed to be.  
---
The only reasonable people are in The Wayward.  Well, and the robots in Helvetia.
---
Nah man, the party ghoul is where it's at
---
Lol but good for you none the less. I wish I saw that when it was available
---
Here's the thing: they didn't suck. They only got fucked once the sorchbeasts came. And the difference between them fighting scorchbeasts and us fighting sorchbeasts is that we can actually be prepared, while they were caught by surprise.
---
I‚Äôm trying to use them as often as I can, but yea may have to dump some at certain point, maybe as a celebration when my Queen kill finally counts.
---
Fanny pack AND a regular backpack... my inner middle-aged white dad wearing high socks and new balance just grilled the perfect steak after cutting the grass in a perfect diagonal pattern. In other words, I‚Äôd be in my happy place. 
---
But seriously though, we have the ability to have a lot of accessories but only have some cosmetics. I‚Äôm not asking for magic stat boost rings or anything, but something would be cool.
---
There is no invincibility caused by tent...
---
How I WISH at times it makes you invincible, especially if your tent is on the ground and scorch enemies are swarming you! :)
---
It doesn't.
---
Hopefully they‚Äôll add more cool content like that again. The added Piper‚Äôs Coat, Cap &amp; Goggles just recently. 
---
Just the Atom value was worth it, to be honest.
---
FO76 is the video game that I've played with far and away the most people not capable of using a mic properly, leaving it open so the group can hear everything from their keyboard clacking to them beating their kids.
---
Totally wouldn't be surprised if most of the FO76 players are on drugs.
---
I would love a storage mod for the chest piece that's just a huge frame for holding gear.
---
But now I realize that looks like Death Stranding in my head.
---
I think it's only going to get better as more content comes. But I'm under no illusion that the bugs will go away :)
---
So the old quantum glug glug Blam trick huh
---
Well then how tf did he survive me unloading my bloodied 50 cal machine gun into him at close range
---
Tell me, how long is the expected wait time for randoms to show up?
---
Don't forget the bue ridge caravan guys. They're pretty good.
---
What is the danger of duping? Making them more available? 
---
You think they would somehow be cheaper if there were fewer of them?
---
What level are u and what level was he/she/pick a word they want to be called by!
---
But who hordes cork?
---
It‚Äôs a decent 80s love ballad. Worth a listen
---
im at the "friendly" reputation so thats not the case
---
I didnt see the lvl but im lvl 53.
---
Pretty much anything is worth more than caps.
---
I dont think it'd be able to be called "The Problem Solver," as that was a unique gun from Fo4's Nuka World DLC
---
I spent an absurd amount of time killing one (f'ing bullet sponge) and got a one star security baton.
---
Honestly, I wouldn't mind the RNG of legendaries like this if their other drops were usable.  Make the vocal sac part of a recipe for something good, for example.
---
Yeah man, just glad I wasn't watching with "those friends" ha ha
---
Gauss pistol?
---
Huh.  
---
BGS games are known for the glitches that never get fixed. Considering you can do a lot of CAMP glitching then maybe.....they should patch the rep glitch. It's not our fault for their laziness.
---
Nice.
---
You forgot the cargo shorts
---
Bethesda and Sony are known for not playing well with each other. Example: the blue screen of death was in FO4 and now 76. Frame rate drops as well on both. Makes me sad... but it is what it is
---
Not an excuse for shitty behavior. Again, the EXP gain is the incentive for the ones guarding the scavengers. The incentive for the ore collectors are the tiered rewards. If the players go in RR because they want to farm EXP, that's their prerogative. Same goes for the reward hunters. It's not the same as people leeching off the event wherein they want the rewards but do nothing and AFK somewhere while other people do the work.
---
The point is, people participate in events to either get #1, #2, or both. You cannot fault EXP farmers if that's what they want to do, the same way you can't fault ore collectors for only collecting ore and not protecting the scavs (which is obviously not the case most of the time but that's how it is).
---
It's so tiring to see people defending shitty mechanics and instead attacking other players for not adhering to what THEY want to achieve. That's selfishness in its own sense as well.
---
\&gt;  You do that in the real world and you end up jail,
---
Let's not be melodramatic over a simple event in a fucking video game lmao.
---
EDIT: Brainfart, I forgot one other MAJOR incentive for guarding the scavs, the loot from tagged enemies. Especially since legendaries have a chance to spawn.
---
I use a heavy build, but I can't get into PA without being incredibly overencumbered
---
I mean... you knew it wouldn‚Äôt drop anything special. If you didn‚Äôt like what it drops, why even try and go find one to kill?
---
I read somewhere it runs through september 10th
---
I love camp building.  Its a big part of my enjoyment of the game and motivations for grinding (i.e fireplace door).  So I love this idea!!!
---
He's a settler right? They're builders. Wile he might not know specifically what the Brotherhood needs, he should know what materials are needed for his protectrons to fortify the Atlas Observatory.
---
The main reason I‚Äôve been told has to do with folks who aren‚Äôt duping cleaning them out of gear, the coming in here to gouge folks on trades (or to get more caps, for whatever reason). They tend to be the folks asking for 30k+ caps, I‚Äôve never met a duper that gave a damn about caps one way or the other. 
---
If you find the folks with the inventory, and legitimately need stuff, they are more likely to give it to you. Putting it in a vendor is just an invitation to get griefed or have folks resell it.
---
50 hours
---
I ruled that out.  At one point it was doing it around 4AM EST. Every other internet app/service worked flawlessly.
---
So first reply
---
 "I like the idea of changing the camp icons on the map to set it apart but it should be players choice if anything. Maybe add a feature to take a preview picture with photomode of your camp like the event preview screen but that still doesn‚Äôt show all what you‚Äôre offering"
---
Adding a preview photo of your camp using photomode. you can take a picture of your farm, your vendors, your diner etc. but ignore that, that's not a suggestion
---
or the second
---
" If there was a check box system in place it would work. I do all those things and I don‚Äôt care to specialize in one thing when I can make all those work"
---
Letting people choose to click on multiple descriptors that show whats there and what your idea for your camp. But because you don't want people to do everything just ignore all that.
---
Deep pocket mod got me covered.
---
I‚Äôd rather they just give us more carry weight instead of a backpack.
---
Wonder what they'll break by fixing it tho...
---
It does.
---
4 of my 5 characters are high level.
---
Really? I've never seen it full since she moved to her new place. Only once so far did I see another person, but he was busy at the stash box while I bought my daily vault steel
---
I used to wait but now I just start it if nobody is already there. If nobody shows up I can keep most miners if not all alive while farming the xp. But if a bunch of randoms show up and I intentionally use weaker weapon to let everyone ‚Äòtag‚Äô, most miners end up dead. Nobody will grab ores either. When I grab ores miners drop like flies. It‚Äôs like a lose lose situation so why waste the time standing there and hope for someone who know what they‚Äôre doing to show up.
---
Oh right, yeah
---
VATS is wonky with it... You'll notice it will go through stretches where it works like a dream... You'll abolish the front of West Tek in less than six seconds without missing a single VATS shot, other times it just won't hit no matter what you do. My shotgun became my main awhile ago, and once you adapt to the weirdness of it it becomes hard to justify using another weapon. I have noticed VATS seems to work better if I'm moving when I let the shot go... Granted that's just anecdotal though.
---
Wait what?
---
Never heard of it. 
---
Any reason that their opinion should hold greater weight than the average person?  Is it a game review show or something related?
---
Exactly! They fix one bug, but also add like 10 more bugs with the same "fix"... so anoying.
---
That's good.  The nastygrams can get pretty bad.
---
You have to grind to infinity as the perk coins are character bound!
---
SC gives you plastic right?
---
Right?  What really makes it bad is that we've had two felony thefts IRL and...I can't even escape from this in a game?
---
I can't find it anymore, but I could swear bethesda said that other miner would be getting some role over the summer. I was so happy to think we would finally get that legendary PA that was datamined over a year ago. Yet still nothing, and the new purveyor taunts us with so much PA on the shelves everywhere
---
MILK FOR THE KHORNE-FLAKES!!!!
---
I'm currently working on the mistress of mystery because my friend told me you can get some noice stuff there
---
Same.  Doesn't matter if you solo it either.
---
While also rocking high tech and advanced equipment while some of us literally run around in our underwear blasting things away?
---
This is a decent idea.
---
Only point I can make is that 5 x 150 would 750 scrip.
---
The DPS of junkies is nothing in comparison to the power of the bloodied side. Search your feelings, you know this to be true.
---
DOh! Bows!  I missed that the first time I read the title.  
---
The weapons I got were not bows.
---
Thx for clarifying my obviously confused self :)
---
Silos runs are ok, have to make sure to get as much damage in at the start of the SBQ fight, once she lands she's dead, so many magic weapons around now.
---
If I was going to guess without knowing some more specifics, I would go with;
---
You were wanted, and therefore available to be killed (auto in pvp).
---
He comes along and kills you.
---
You chose respawn instead of "revenge".
---
At this point you are no longer in PVP, so you and him are just 2 players.
---
You start shooting him with your gun.
---
This does no damage (not in pvp), but opens the option for him to engage in pvp.
---
He waits for a suitable moment (e.g. you reload) to take you up on PVP.
---
He kills you again.
---
UFO, yes please
---
I use one to tag legendaries.
---
I run the same setup, and it sure seems like it does.
---
Good point, I may need to take some weapons away from my vendor and reduce prices. Most of my non scrip weapons i just go by under fed76 pricing (for example if they quote 2000-4000 i sell for 1900). I sell my scrip fodder 3 stars for 750 but if they‚Äôre absolute garbage 650 or less. I may need to reduce these all to 500 or just scrip then myself.
---
I sometimes have items that are recommended trade only (34000+) that I‚Äôve sold for 19000-22000 just because of the 30000 cap limit and my laziness to find a safe trade.
---
It's been a while but I'm pretty sure there's just a staircase going down that's hard to see
---
Ahhhhh ok. Thanks.
---
I have been loving life since implementing that.
---
ah found it finally! thank you! :)
---
A 3 star legendary lvl 95 or whatever it is with an 8% spawn chance should not drop a one star legendary pistol. I‚Äôm not asking for god drops, I‚Äôm asking to at least disappoint me with a 2 or 3 star.
---
I would've thought the T-65 armor would come in legendary variants like everything else from Vault 79
---
Np :)
---
Illuminati confirmed.
---
If you were shooting him in vats it wouldn't have caused him damage.
---
If you're a commando build, make the tesla a single shit weapon to reduce your bonus damage from perks.  If you're a rifleman build, make it automatic.
---
There are frakholes all around. 
---
Last night, I was running Feed the People. Running low on Canned Meat, plus the Treasury Notes are good. I kept watch over the front console, and when the repairs were needed I ran straight to the fuse box or valve to fix them. 
---
I was keeping watch on the front console from the corner, quickshotting the ghouls or mole rats that appeared. 
---
Right at the end, two high level players came over and down thumbed and vomit emoted right next to me, directly facing me. 
---
I was puzzled. What had I done that bothered them so much?  I was doing my part, and not ‚Äòkill-stealing‚Äô anything. 
---
Then I got the Xbox message, which I won‚Äôt repeat here. And then it made sense. 
---
I was on my alt character, which is a *female*. And *that* was what they didn‚Äôt like.
---
Luckily, frakholes like that are few and far between. The community in general is very positive.  Don‚Äôt let them ruin your fun. Just move on to the next event. That‚Äôs my advice.
---
I was not but i figured it out with someone else's help. I respawned and didn't seek revenge
---
I forgot. :P
---
I‚Äôm commando and if I did that single shit would be the correct term!!!! lol
---
Be careful. Witch-hunting isn‚Äôt allowed here. There are other places for that.
---
This. Best \*.ini command ever.
---
My buddy gave me an AA gamma gun, he said ‚Äúsave it for players who harass you.‚Äù It makes perfect sense to use against bloodied builds
---
Kids ignored by parents and bullied at school tend to do this.
---
Well what i do is i play the game and get xp doing things and stuff
---
Area chat is sometimes really funny and sometimes just someone's mouth sounds...
---
I've never understood the people who fear everything is an attempt to "get you to buy stuff." I've played this game for over 1,000 hours and have never been the slightest bit interested in spending money on anything.
---
Its my gamer tag though
---
They had support from the west coast and time, longer then it took me to go from nearly naked to easily handing scorched alone.  They still sucked IMO.  
---
Sure we have the finished vaccine, but they could have too if they stopped acting like high and mighty jerks and worked with the responders.  
---
Frankly I still don't see why we should care and they won't be vaccinated, either.  Like hell I'm making them another batch of my bloods in it.  I can't wait for a fartbat to turn em all so I have some BoS clad scorched to killü§ò
---
Lol bold of you to assume I praise this game. Someone got butt hurt over a simple question, yikes. I am on this reddit because I seek debate, discussion, and to help answer questions about the game because I actively play it. But I do not come here to just have a circle jerk of praise and worship, this game is fun but it has many flaws and still needs a ton of work to be worthy of praise. 
---
But "hoping they fix it" and just commenting about how you dont play because the bad mechanics ruined the game for you won't fix shit. The devs aren't in here day and night sifting through every single comment on every single post. You're not trying to help with any issues, just proclaiming the game is bad and you don't play. And if thats the case then there is logically no reason for you to be on the reddit for the game. 
---
There are plenty of games I dont like and don't play, you won't find any comments from me about how I dislike the game or that it could be better. That's pointless dribble and accomplishes nothing other than blatant whining.
---
Pipe is Life
---
Well it took me 10 seconds, I'd expect a bit more from such a monster, but if you dont let it close even a casual like me can kill it easily. I mean even vendigo colossus is kinda boring, most of the times it's just stuck between big trees and occasionally throws fear at you and some vendigo spawns, that's it. At least both times I participated it was like that, even SBQ fight is much more fun, even though you get used to it fast.
---
...that's it? Those are the best you could come up with? The ammo machine is the only one that even stands out as a blip in the grand scheme of this game
---
The challenges aren‚Äôt what he‚Äôs referring to
---
Omg is that what ppl were doing? I noticed someone bought one shotgun bullet from me 3 times and I was so confused, like why not just buy it all at once? Makes sense now.
---
If he can get the kill on me with me swinging first, he deserves it. It hasn‚Äôt happened yet.
---
Oops.
---
But if you just want to use the tesla to tag enemies, then nerfing the damage is the way to go
---
Yeah, kinda. Seems like the glitch is tied to mutations and rad-x suppresses mutations and if you take rad-x diluted it stops suppressing the mutations
---
Ok. Sounds like you know what character to level up with
---
as said, if you dont want to patriciate,  DONT.  why is reddit full of whining and bitching???   for roleplaying sake, this is the objective.  help them or not...
---
I didn‚Äôt pay close enough attention, apparently. No harm in self-naming, I guess.
---
I prefer 1H, partially for the weight reasons, partially for the speed.
---
Been using that vampire switchblade since I was In the low 60‚Äôs (turned 224 last night) 
---
Have acquired up a few specific enemy prefix 1Hs lately - they have been quite impressive.  (The FSS ghouls slayers Switchblade hits L42s and 2-3 hits anything over that.  The ally retrieve a weapons case gave me a 3\* Zealots machete yesterday.  Last night, unaltered by foods etc, it‚Äôs power attacks were 1 hitting L68s.  Not bad for a 2# weapon. :)
---
did that once, same thing happend the bar showed up but it didnt move at all
---
Yeah it's a real shame. I love power armor and wanna wear it all the time. Grinded my ass off for the T65 but I never wear it cause my regular gear outclasses it. 
---
Sucks cause it really looks badass
---
Also the type of enemies vary by XP no matter the level- so you can basically farm lvl 5 super mutant overlords for the same amount of XP you‚Äôd get for a lvl 10 regular super mutant
---
I know, like the card swap is the most obvious one. You have to click on the cards several times if you use a mouse. I think the programmers don't play at all.
---
I'M ALREADY HALF WAY DRUNK
---
I want to say its a German show. Its definitely dubbed on UK Netflix.
---
It's two "gamers" talking about their favourite games.
---
It doesn't hold any weight, other than it's a wide audience I suppose.
---
It did make me wonder about the rules around those things. 
---
Ultimately I just saw something fallout 76 related on TV, it made me kinda smile cringe, and I thought I'd share here.
---
You make it sound like you can pay money to skip time gates like in a mobile game.
---
Report the messages, chances are they‚Äôve already had comm bans before this and are going to get some consequences
---
Sentry bots overheat my friend, assultrons have knife hands and face lasers, and don't over heat.
---
Tents dont make you invincible. My guess is he was just much higher level than you were.
---
Oh, I wasn‚Äôt being negative towards you at all for sharing the info. I just wasn‚Äôt familiar with the source material.
---
Ko–Øn
---
Well does equipment not max at 50? Cause i am over 50
---
yes
---
Bring in where?
---
Please quote the part where I began praising this game. In fact I invite you to search through all my comments and find you a gem of praise to quote. 
---
I would just love to see all the praising of the game I've done. Cuz its so much and so often.
---
Maybe John Hancock's coat
---
Thank you. Clip and magazine is not the same!!!
---
The current "fix" for auto-completion is to not be logged in during reset and for the first 30 minutes after reset. Ever since I started doing that I haven't had any auto-completes.
---
No, he‚Äôs referring to his perk points being linked between nw and adventure mode
---
The boss drops suck across the board, from Scorched Earth to Project Paradise, those bosses should never be dropping anything lower than a 2* legendary piece. 
---
I almost beat Project Paradise last night by myself, the alpha was LVL 100 Fog Crawler this time, as the Server Shutdown message was ticking that it was imminently going to shutdown, there I was trying to kill that damn thing.  I finally got it down, only to find a 1* Furious Shotgun on it - I retrieved my junk and left the server in utter annoyance.
---
The fallout server databases are too big from all the 1st members hoarding everything. Time for a defrag in the form of a purge.
---
Oh god please I have rolled so many SS armours that would be perfect for my friend but all I can do is scrip it
---
No worries, I wasn't sure so just tried keeping my reply neutral.
---
The show is kind of young adult stuff, a guy starts selling drugs to impress a girl, hilarity ensues as they get out of their depth and into trouble.
---
*Defend patroll units during reprogramming... members.*
---
Right?  It's so dumb
---
Jobs for the working class. Oh wait wrong sub üò≥ üòÑ
---
While those three are primarily the reason, XP is definitely one of them. Me and my buddies intentionally take while to kill her so all those mobs come at us.
---
but there is an advantage to it too, when you explode something on a roof and the chunks rain down you dont really have to run up all those fucking stairs do you? win :-)
---
Personally i do it cuz i dont care
---
Yea.  I do that and have been passing it on to others. Make it easy plus only 3 caps to do.
---
So basically walk around, pick up anything that isn‚Äôt nailed down, kill shite and take their stuff to scrap.
---
You just described Fallout in general. This is basically what I did for the 1200 hours I played before actually doing the main quest. Wander around aimlessly and pick everything up. This‚Äôll be a breeze...
---
Appreciate the info though, awesome work sorting this all out.
---
299 mounted heads, 1 mole miner gauntlet.
---
Poggers in chat
---
Oh god.  Not that again...
---
They're a detachment from the West Coast from what I read. Basically sent to follow up on what happened after Taggerdy's group went silent.
---
Down with the Brotherhood!  Down with Tyranny!  SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS!  haha
---
if you're on pc you can add me and I can craft you some, can give a bit for free and if you don't want for free I can sell you some very cheap. also have a lot of cheap stuff like plans and recipes. In-game name is Dark_Wolfy. I'm currently playing alone most of the times so I'd be more than happy to help out or just hang out together.
---
BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKUKKS FOR THE SKULL THRONE! MILK FOR THE KHORNE FLAKES!!!!!
---
We need to show those Imperial dogs what it's like when we send their souls to the ruinous powers of Chaos!
---
Had a similar thing happen a few weeks back, wasn't an insta kill but it was two melee dudes in power armor probably using bloodied weapons,, when the queen landed they both whacked her like 3 times each killing it in like 2 seconds from almost full health.
---
No one but them got loot and that was our third nuke in a row, luckily it was the only one ruined.
---
The most annoying part is that both dudes were only like lvl 80....
---
Yep. I am over weight, better get out of this machine pick it up and carry it with everything else. Cool now I am not overweight, and can jump over cars with it.
---
A smart person doesn't farm ghouls for xp.
---
Public teams are the culprit usually. If anyone launches on your team it completes for anyone who has the mission. 
---
Not sure it‚Äôs a bug but it‚Äôs not very cool for people into the lore and ruining the end game etc. Can always be done again, but still.
---
Its not a bug. You were in a public group with someone who dropped a nuke. If you reenter a silo you will still get a new quest to drop another nuke so you didn't really miss out on anything.

I'm just waiting for the steel one to be completed within an hour or 2 of it going live because the amount of dupes of shit like that. Hell I've got close to 100k steel and mine is legit lmao.
---
If you join a team and someone in that team launches a nuke it completes it for you as far as i remember. Sure it happened to me on an alt
---
Facepalm...have trued to killed or flat out ignored this thanks for the info.
---
Awesome, thanks for the reply. definitely gonna start using it.
---
V33 is also magic, use it to one shot kill and stay healthy
---
Its power armour, you SHOULD be able to always carry more in it then if you don't wear it.
---
Just looked this up and now I gotta get me one of these!
---
Ghillie covered chairs. Lol!!
---
It‚Äôs a great build. I was going to do a bloodied build but that seems to be what everyone is doing, so I opted for stealth rifleman. this one‚Äôs definitely a ton of fun and very powerful as well with the right perks. I‚Äôll for sure have to add speed demon to my mutations now. Thanks for the heads up! üëçüèª
---
But that‚Äôs not the case ingame
---
Just straight up trash build get gud scrub
---
This is good. I enjoy this post.
---
I hope you're right because as of now atleast the "Executioner's FFR 90WR harpoon gun" sounds like the very first drop they got from the purveyor and simply went with it
---
Then don't donate your junk dopey
---
Man, I had so much scrip dropping out of my pockets, I was over-encumbered for two full weeks before I could run again.
---
My Bloodied Caster deals around 2k-3k damage with the correct perks. Also I upgraded it to Prime. One shot pew pew :3
---
You mean something like youtube or spotify where you can put on some specific song and turn off music in game?
---
To be fair, cork is important in building a versatile defense - layer steel, cork and concrete in several layers... the steel deflects impacts, the concrete absorbs impacts and the cork disperses the energy of impact. It might also be important in deflecting energy blasts.
---
Bulletin boards?

Thanks everyone, I'll edit the first post to "answered"

I like the breach and clear event Especially

when it's just me and I get to haul All that

lead and steel to make .50 cal ammo 
---
Gotta feed my MG lol
---
Maybe the 3rd season run will be Enclave coming back.
---
Yeah and an explosive shotgun isn‚Äôt exactly nice for berz. Think you need ranged weapons for that build tbh.
---
Some people with more debt in the lore assumed that the Appalachia chapter might fuck up their attempt at 'whatever they're attempting to do' and get striken from the BoS codex which could explain why you never read something about them lore-wise in the other games (except obviously the previous games' devs didn't know about 76 ever going to exist back then).
---
PC usually good. Yesterday we had that guy though. Easy enough followed him around and one shot everything he could get. Even got the last legend, he was slow xD
---
We should be able just to select which song we want to listen to by now, love the ring of fire remix.
---
Yes. Just like you. Sheesh.
---
A slight coffee smudge covering 7 zeroes

How do you lock stuff? Asking for a friend.
---
Yeah, happened go me too, I was a bit frustrated but thankfully they helped me do it again later and explained the process xD
---
What was the answer?
---
I am the great Cornholio!
---
Honestly, I‚Äôd be okay with them adding lunchboxes to the atomic shop as a utility item. I have never, not once, spent atoms on scrap or repair kits. Those lunchboxes though? I‚Äôd actually consider getting a few from time to time.
---
90s, he couldn‚Äôt sing fir much of the 80s.
---
I don't know about not being able to flip the switch... But if the SB isn't spawning leave the event area and come back. That usually works for me
---
I literally killed the queen solo in my own private server and didn‚Äôt get the challenge done... That‚Äôs really annoying.
---
Imagine the BoS showing up, looking at the supply papers and see them all marked off with maybe just a handful of junk laying around instead of the promised loads of materials.
---
Remember there's always explosive bait.. And his camp
---
Right? At least give me the chance, the small chance, of getting a bloodied faster fire rate something. Knowing I can be handed 1 Star after 1 Star is really annoying.
---
My private server Queen farming has never given me anything other than 1 Star armor

Just ask the settlement farmers in the Commonwealth.

Angry Turtle video that goes over stealth, answers questions like yours and more

How do the quantums work?
---
By definition, I was not being judgmental. I know I can try to explain this to you. But I know you're unwilling and simply will not get it. So, have a nice day.
---
Where are the blueprints I asked for, scribe?
---
I alwasy thought that myself but Im guessing player level has something to do with it too because Ive seen level 70/80s being annihilated by players in the high 100s
---
It‚Äôd be criminal NOT to have that
---
Not trying to be too snarky, but did you read the replies? 
---
All 3 first replies said it completes if you are in a team and someone in that team launches the nuke.
---
How do you even get skins for survival tents? I don't play that long and subscribed only a month ago and never saw anywhere the mention of tents skin. Are they still obtainable somehow or was it a limited offer in atom shop or was it some kind of month/year exclusive? I like your idea too, though it's doubtful they'll add it, but one can hope.
---
Sometimes you have to run around and look for it. It's usually stuck behind a tree or a building or something. There's one in the northern bog that works fine. All the rest are fooked
---
Yep, it‚Äôs justified. Wasteland self defense. 
---
Though honestly, unless it‚Äôs a resource extractor or ammo machine, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about locking it. It‚Äôll restock once your there.
---
I want something similar for normal mode, though I want old Marty singing Big Iron constantly So I can finally role play as a Lawful good gunslinger properly. 
---
Also I‚Äôd be remiss if I didn‚Äôt mention the well known old story here in relation to ring of fire, where a haemorrhoid cream company wanted to use the song on their adverts. 
---
I feel a nuclear explosion setting would be a fitting testament to it.

Well, since you put it that way yeah

FO76 IS the drug...

Mothman see's all
---
You're welcome! Now that I'm higher level I switch between rifleman and commando depending on who I'm with or what I'm doing. The Chinese Stealth Armor was a big game changer for me. Love my build now!
---
Oh, and if you don't have it get Marsupial! That and Speed Demon are my two favorite mutations, can't live without them lol
---
Our leader might be shit but most of us aren't, and if you are there just because you believe in his courses your fucked, I'm there so I can easily launch nukes for resources, and get and for a low low price of 18k caps get serums,but there are other things there that you can buy and shit like that, but the brotherhood of steel can suck my dick, they can burn in hell.
---
Dude, I had no idea those were supposed to be turned in. I feel so dumb now. I've just been snatching them up and shooting the enemies, then smelting them at my C.A.M.P.
---
I still wait it out anyway because more people at the event = the AI director makes more ghouls spawn/respawn faster = more exp
---
Imagine if we would get XP for every sub-task of the events like "become a conduit" or harvesting ore like you said....(or if people could just damn read...) We could suddenly get complex events done and maybe even get even more complex events in the future.
---
Tried it on my alt and it's a no go, probably bashing needed there too players.
---
Tried a flaming chainsaw and that didn't work either. Rather carry that around than a shishkebab
---
What is your build? This sounds like a fun way to play
---
Man, I really like Angry Turtle! By far one of my favorites for information about gameplay mechanics üëç
---
Definitely gonna use this for my next set of runs.
---
Same I'm slowly leveling up an alt for the level challenges. I could try with my main but I'd have to commit genocide on at least half the map while well rested, inspired 3, and canned souped.
---
Also faster reloads with speed demon. 
---
I run stealth rifleman with marsupial, speed demon, eagle eyes and bird bones. 
---
You don‚Äôt really notice negative effects with class freak maxed out.
---
I really wish the whole system would be reworked from the ground up.  If you kill a creature above LVL 50, you should get a weapon that is suitable for your level, not some level 35 thing. If it's a legendary molerat, so what, it should still drop something suitable for your level. I pulled a 3* Bloodied laser off a radrat in a horde event, immediately I was wowed until I saw that it was a level 5 gun. 
---
It just seems inconsistent, and something that they're aware enough of to tie the level of a weapon to the *size of* or *threat posed* by a mob, I guess, but they can't make that work the opposite way *in the players favor* by buffing the quality of loot dropped by boss creatures.
---
A working ticket system where you could report bugs and the bugs would actually get fixed.
---
Because of that I dont even bother with PA anymore. I just have to much stimpaks üòî
---
I dislike the bashing on some challenges, im only level 120, but I dont go a single day without leveling up at least once. I did the weekly 3 levels in one day because I ran a few events. Someone just seems to complain for fun.
---
new character
---
On release there was no way to turn it off. You could hear everything.
---
It's NEVER their nuke. That would require them putting in legit effort and could put them at risk of actually contributing to an event.
---
Forgive my naivet√©, but it's this "fix" going to give us a sell all option?
---
What‚Äôs there to reminisce about? Events have typically been pretty bad in Fallout 76. I would say Fasnacht and Mischief Night are the two events that have the most going on, and that‚Äôs not really saying a lot. Have we really settled for mediocrity so bad that we‚Äôre looking forward to the return of lackluster events? Give me some BOS/Enclave themed events or some Great War anniversary event to commemorate when the bombs fell. I don‚Äôt know what it is with this community but sometimes I‚Äôm just left shaking my head at some of the ridiculousness that I see on Discord and Reddit.
---
Right, I've only ever tried using it on npcs but read in here about flaming player in the current context. Obviously the people that said it need the other flaming.
---
Don't have the mod, but remember someone posted something about it on here.
---
I'd say putting an achievement for completing wastelanders while siding with each faction separately already encourages an alt playthrough instead of just one global "raided the vault" achievement.
---
Hey, if that's all it takes to get on their airship so I can blow it up from the inside, again, I'm fine with it.
---
Nice! I currently have healing factor, marsupial, eagle eyes, and now I‚Äôll probably add speed demon and one of carnivore/herbivore.
---
It's pretty misleading, the perk card itself shows a vault boy with a flamer, flaming his friends for hp lol
---
Interesting mod.. you fire that tesla and out comes a single brown sausage dropping on the floor
---
'It's a trap' is a meta title. Every time I get suckered in thinking it might work this time.

Given how much value junk has at vendors you‚Äôd think the rewards would be a little more spicy for handing collective millions of junk.

Thanks everyone, appreciate the tips and guides.

Friendly bashing just doesn't have the same ring to it.
---
Legendary griefers: I can easily 1 shot the mole miner  
---
Also the griefers: plz helmp I deal 1 damage to the SBQ
---
&gt;feasible or not
---
 :D
---
Yeah I am loving it even more now that I have the stealth armor. Enemies will be walking into me and I still don‚Äôt get detected lol. I have marsupial, healing factor, and eagle eyes, so I‚Äôll def add speed demon and see what others can give me a boost too.
---
Fair enough üòÇ
---
It wouldn't make sense, the railroad doesn't even exist yet

An asset to the community for sure. üëç
---
Awesome! Thanks so much. I‚Äôll def have to watch more of his fallout videos
---
Ultracite is missing it as well
---
By definition made a suggestion and you cake back with a judgy statement so i responded in kind.
---
Ive only ever had 2 hostile encounters with a mothman at Level 140 and sadly it was the easiest fight ever
---
It is annoying. Based on casual play you can fill limits of bullion etc so quickly. I can only imagine what it's like for the sexually frustrated basement dwellers spending 18 hours a day on a game. Must be extremely annoying filling all their mules and still having spare time to do nothing but ice the sbq in 3.4 nanoseconds. I do think the limit could be double of each of what it is though.
---
Smh.
---
&gt;cork
---
I wonder if Bethesda looked at how much people have rather than how easy it is to get, because I have quite a bit of cork relatively speaking.  Nothing I make or repair uses cork so I've just ended up with quite a bit.
---
Yeah I know. Thought it would be ok with one shot. I was wrong. I call it the panic button. Get over run. Point and ground and pull trigger. Everything dead. I‚Äôll just carry a regular fixer with me.
---
My communist collection is always unlocked because it‚Äôs our stuff.
---
The one at Watoga seems to be royally screwed up, sometimes I've seen the SB spawn over at NAR, other times nowhere in sight.
---
The only one of those events I've ever done where it's worked multiple times correctly is in the Ash Heap, sort of below Garrahan Mining.
---
No worries!
---
Oh no, what will you do now that you are missing some toys?
---
In build mode on PC, you hit F while moused over an item that has inventory and can select what level of lock as well. I image on console highlighting will show what button corresponds to F on PC.
---
or somebody asking their mom for the credit card info as he wants to buy Atoms while area-chatting around Whitesrping station. And before anybody asks: Nope I haven't gotten the full details, just realized what he was doing when he discussed what date the card expires.
---
My plan list says otherwise!
---
Dungeons and Raids would be awesome! Maybe a PVP zone with good loot like in the division where you need to extract the loot and if you die, you loose it. Darkzones I believed the called it. Loved that!
---
By that do you mean robbing vault 79?
---
When they can't get something to work, they remove it.
---
This is the way
---
Give it a different name then, gosh, a suppressed 10mm pistol with a james bond skin and sneak bonuses is what the suggestion really is. Not the exact deliverer from FO4. And maybe take the cryolator out of the game too while we're at it. The second the atom shop was a part of this game all immersion was forgotten.
---
Lmao, this made me lol
---
Wait you can lock work benches!? Lol I‚Äôve never seen one locked. Weird flex
---
I think your find they *half* remove it
---
Completely agree if I've got the time which I do to play hours on end why punish me for it. I have been trying to buy all the power armour plans at 1400 a day limit in vendor and most items been 4000 or over I'm getting nowhere fast. I'm sitting on 1000 gold bullion tickets.
---
Of course not, but the only thing that'll truly see the full power of a bloodied build are bosses. Everything else dies instantly to my junkie build.
---
That backs up what I've seen as well. Being one-shotted by level 300 players who cannot be damaged back. Also a level 200-something WANTED player who was unkillable for some reason.
---
Just use Contractor 2\* and build a free fusion generator, It's easier that way
---
Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne, ya know, same shit different day
---
Don't corks technically count as bottle caps?
---
They should raise the limits but not remove them. Removing them would kill this game
---
I got mine from Back on the Beat.
---
What exactly are you talking about ü§î
---
Xp and level might mean something with the legendary perks. But right now, if you like caps, grind them out on multiple characters and have a vendor up while doing it. Easy to fill a mule account like that \~150k caps.
---
How many people can mess up the robots name? 1,2,3,4....?
---
They don't really know how to implement late game content. It would require a pretty big update for them to have actual end game content and looking at the road map thats not gonna happen. 
---
Also looking at how they put limits/caps on everything even if they do, its going to be a chore.
---
It's amazing.  Also, it's very easy to set up a heavy weapon/pistol hybrid just fyi.  Don't give up on pistols.  They're great.
---
It's "expensive" because you're asking the engine to render the scene, even if the player doesn't see it, for each AI in the world so they can analyze and process it, and then make determinations about what they see.  That's an expensive process.
---
It's much more streamlined to create a nodegraph, such as [what the Source Engine does](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Nodegraph), and have hints on these nodes that suggest what the AI should do on reaching them.
---
People who loot everything in each area they go in.
---
Imperial dogs!
---
How bout "corrector" lol
---
But how do the documents turn into blades
---
I‚Äôve actually enjoyed leveling a new NW character. It‚Äôs allowing me to solely focus on my S.P.E.C.I.A.L.  distribution for NW instead of Adventure Mode and it‚Äôs quite liberating, build-wise. Gone are the days of having to sacrifice a NW perk because I had to move my S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats around to enjoy Adventure Mode.
---
I don't play between 17:30 to 18:30 and it's worked so far. 
---
Reset is 18:00 in my timezone.
---
because you like to do things within the game that feel like chores instead of good rpg elements? i hate the sentiment that if you dont like it you should just leave. i am critical because it is my favorite franchise, hands down. glad your just happy with whatever chore type game you come across.
---
Relog or swap servers after applying it, then you should have zero movement when you are aiming with scopes!
---
So your saying because they messed up with one part of the lore they should just give up, do you know how dumb you sound?
---
The presidential thing was never even in the game. We weren‚Äôt even supposed to know about it so don‚Äôt complain about it never coming out
---
Vault raids were buggy and didn‚Äôt work well so they removed them, survival mode also was a pile of shit. Don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre complaining about this stuff getting removed
---
At least 3 mins.  My group of 7 or 8 will show up and actually run the event like it supposed to
---
Yes, we're not collecting technical data, we're burning  evidence of war crimes in the name of freedom. Ad Victoriam!
---
It‚Äôs not just about having a pistol chambered in 5.56, it‚Äôs about that sexy distinctive reload noise bring up nostalgia. If they introduced That Gun without the reload noise it would be like adding an M1 Garand without the iconic ‚Äòping‚Äô.
---
Can the BOS update possibly be only late game at this point?
---
No. It only makes it slightly less tedious.  Gives you better conversion rate and more points in the system as well.
---
I‚Äôm a girl too, dude. However, I am laughing my ass off at the comment, because it‚Äôs truly a first for me.
---
Thanks. I was a kid so those decades blur together.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with the sight?
---
Yes, but transforming XP into a quasi-currency wasn't necessary to achieve that.  It seems like they were planning to rotate the Weekly Repeatable with a version for Events, for example, where completing the Event successfully was the criteria, instead of simply XP gain, although that would remain a thing as long as the "Level Up!" daily existed.
---
What's going to happen is that Legendary Perks are going to come in, and they are all based on cashing in Perk Cards, which you'll get from XP.  And they'll move to sell the Lunchboxes in the Atomic Shop which boost your XP.  This is how they will sneak what's effectively a pay-to-win currency into the game, by turning XP into this grindy mechanic where "You *could* earn it through playing, or you could buy things that boost it significantly."
---
I‚Äôve only completed that event one time because of its high difficulty and project paradise plus those events are always ghost towns.
---
Survival mode was a good idea in theory, but the current team simply isn't capable of making something like that work. The vault raids were...pretty bad, trust me you're not missing anything. We don't know what the presidential race would have been like but the dataminers say it would have been at least interesting. 
---
None of us know for sure so take this with a grain of salt, but the situation has been pretty bad for the past year or so. Obviously the game's launch was...horrendous, for lack of a better term. They started slowly improving things from there. However, it was still clear that there was some catastrophic failure within one of the departments. Things were clearly not being tested or were tested and not fixed, and it looked like the devs simply are not getting the resources they need to do things properly. We've had countless situations of wrong info, misleading descriptions, embarrassing mistakes, or barely playable content.
---
And all of that has just been getting worse from around the time they delayed wastelanders. It's like their skeleton crew has gotten even thinner. Now updates come every 1-2 months, they still often break important things, and now we don't even get hotfixes for important issues until the next update. They don't even bother patching out exploits or bugs that benefit people anymore, the cheaters got away free in the latest suspension wave and bugs like the "magic" weapons that let you tear a SBQ apart have been in the game for months
---
Cork. Lots and lots of cork.
---
It zooms way too much. I fixed it though as I edited Fallout76Prefs
---
I seen 4 lads all around level 30-40 being wiped out without hesitation by a wanted 210...from a bush of course :D
---
I have managed to not buy a single atom as well, but the atomic store isn't set up like unlockable characters in a regular game. There are many spaces where it feels pay to win. I bought the game, why are you not providing me the whole game? Unlimited storage, only if you pay 12.99 a month. Want to play* with only your friends? You can all pay me 12.99. It's absurd. Kill 1100 robots? 40 atoms for a reward. So for the 500 atoms you want you'd have to kill 13,750 creatures? Or it's only 5 bucks. 7600 hours of gameplay earns you 20 atoms. That's only 316 DAYS. 500 atoms would take nearly 8,000 days, 21 YEARS to get you the same thing you can get for 5 bucks. Sure, you don't need to pay to win, but if Bethesda could stop pissing on our legs and telling us it's raining, I'd really appreciate it.
---
Dude you cna get like 40k if not more xp in that event farming ghouls.
---
I'm one of those people. Very few things in Fallout 76 break down into [cork](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Cork_(Fallout_76)).
---
I currently have over 200,000 steel in my scrapbox.
---
Wanna know how much cork I have? 4,000.
---
I‚Äôve run berserkers for a little over a year and I can tell you I‚Äôve killed myself more than any other creature in the wasteland has killed me
---
It looks fine to me
---
The game developers want us bickering with each other.  If they didn‚Äôt they would fix this.
---
From what I‚Äôve read it gives options on amounts. So we should be able to off load 100 rounds for most instead of 12 making it easier to get rid of all of it. Also the stored points is being increased to either 10k or 100k, I‚Äôm not sure on that point.
---
Who had this brilliant idea with the special points in nw? And I won't destroy my adventure build for the nw mode
---
That doesn't work 100% of the time.

I use the medics goggles and a bandana. Looks pretty cool.

Thank you SO much for this reply! I have D2 as well and it is almost unplayable due to Tower tracel times (up to 7 min at times!)

Maybe a little further down the line, I think I want to try a HW/PA build next, that‚Äôs something I have never done.
---
Only if it were the final days of the season would I ever consider going something like this. I could save the 450 atoms and then get and additional 500 for 950 total, which is much better than being left with 50 atoms at the end of the day.

Well it sounds like a whole lot of we'll give you a little bit not enough. Par for the course with Bethesda. Thanks!
---
I heavily doubt it will be end game content as well. Think about it this way. If youre not satisfied with the current end game content the BOS update will just be an extension of that. So most likely just more dailys for you to do with capped currency.
---
And a leader bobble head if available
---
As I understand it you will only be able to donate one type of junk at time and will have a few days to make donations. Steel is up first I believe.
---
1. A return of raids would be amazing, nothing has felt challenging or felt like I needed to pay attention to it since the removal
---
2. Mechanicly challenging content, since you brought up warframe, think along the old raids where you need to solve puzzles in combat (the platform puzzle comes to mind, where you needed to cross a large cavern by hitting buttons to move platforms, 1-2 ppl would need to go ahead and 1-2 stay behind so people who went ahead can do buttons on side B to get the left behind people across). things like you need to do X mechanic to damage the boss/mechanic to deal a huge damage chunk (light puzzle, like warframe having to move a full core to x location)
---
3.  And the big one I would love, Town defence event (can be used as a cap sink)  I used to play the shit out of this event on an old mmo I used to play (cartoony pc game, forgot name)  basically players need to defend the city/city hall from ever increasing #'s and difficulty of mobs.  The longer the players hold out the better the rewards. (The clear events if your server did it were God tier crafting mats)  The cap sink comes in with npc's, in that game you could donate game money to arm npc's, pay repairmen to fix stuff while the event goes on, pay to have more "town hp" and automated defences.
---
4. A "wilderness/homesteading" update, add fishing, hunting buffs, new farming items (e.x. sprinklers that increase plant grow speed in an area, a resource tab item that let's you acquire meat over time) new plants to grow (decorative and edible)
---
I just do the underground glitch. Outside it signals where to go, but everything is under the map.
---
The deliverer was a pre war gun anyway, someone in a previous comment made a nice argument how there's a big time gap between 76 and 4 so the pistol  could have made it's way from west Virginia to Boston anyway. The fallout franchise is riddled with retcons, misteps, and reworks you marvellous bafoon. Cough Xo1, cough jet, cough death claws, cough BOS in west virginia, get real. All's I'm trying to do is suspend some disbelief and entertain the idea that it would be cool if a stealth pistol with the skin of the deliverer was put into fo76 as a fixer substitute for pistol builds. God dang do you at least get paid well serving as the fun police?
---
Thank you for the reply, nice summary and gives context. I have come across few gamebreaking bugs already such as the 1hp enemy bug, fast travel bug and few camp building bugs. I know that I am barely scratching the surface here, but gee they put out atom content every week.
---
All the ones I've tried of late have actually worked. Only one haven't tried is mire.

It‚Äôs not perfect. But if I don‚Äôt have to spend an hour spamming out 20k of 5mm I‚Äôll be happier. I have a mule sitting on way to much ammo that this small change is happily welcome.
---
Vault raids and presidential election were not game modes and the presidential election was never even released.

And nobody played survival. That‚Äôs why it was removed. Same thing with vault raids. They needed to be reworked.

I caught him once far away from the Foundation in a creek Blair-witched at a big rock. Maybe that‚Äôs where Ward finds his inWard peace from his busy schedule...doing bed and chair stunts.

Upvoted because it's a suitable workaround, but at the same time - creating a character specifically to cheese a challenge isn't a great game design choice so the original point stands.

Sorry wasn't aware, but the wiki is literally full of info on the presidential seal, gauss and etc.

I run w/ Chinese Stealth Armor and have the Speed Demon mutation. I saw a significant difference after getting the mutation. I was also the Rifleman perk build but have since changed to Commando. It really changed my SBQ event damage.
---
Im slowly building sets of lvl 1 legendary armor and weapons to pass on from alt to alt just to level.
---
As addicted said they reset in 5-10 minutes of being empty, you can speed it up by joining and quiting a public server.
---
Sounds good. Which command is it?
---
It says cores. Fusion cores.
---
Thank you. Taking about the coolest events in this game is like reminiscing about the hottest waitress at Dennys. What are you doing? Give us more Fallout in these things. Getting 5 players together to kill a dragon ain't what this game has been about for its first 20 years.
---
There is a new event starting with next weeks update. Community event that requires a bunch of junk be donated.
---
bDisableAllGore=1
---
I‚Äôm missing out, had to go back to work this last week. What‚Äôs this collecting stuff for the brotherhood all about? I was just playing but didn‚Äôt notice anything new
---
In the future I always use workshops to complete these challenges so that I don‚Äôt potentially mess up my camp.
---
The only thing I'd do is use a photomode pic and send them a calling card through messenger
---
New BoS motto. Venimus et nos vidimus suxisti (we came, we saw, we sucked) (if this isnt right my Latin Is terrible)
---
That's been one of my complaints from the start, they have enough artists on the payroll to consistently push out atom shop updates every week or two (even if some of it is recycled fo4 content, and even if sometimes you get things like the screaming eagle skin that are horribly broken), but the dev team is spread so thin they can't even spare time for game-breaking issues like damage bugs or people getting stuck inside PA frames
---
That one i had to run towards the trees and it was slightly outside the zone of the event
---
I did that one yesterday and just one ghoul spawned for each step.
---
I sadly don‚Äôt have a fix,but I‚Äôm sure someone will...
---
Instead I have a suggestion,I did mine at a workshop last night,&amp; barely had to contribute any mats.
---
Completed the challenge using 90% of the workshop provided mats &amp; got my score.
---
Pick up 180 world items to respawn world items, search 80 containers to respawn container contents. I hop servers to force the respawn after hitting said numbers.
---
Oh yeah, I'll take it. I'd be happy to upgrade from a '72 Dodge Dart to a '98 Honda Accord. But we deserve this year's Cadillac.
---
The deathclaws and floaters are worth more at that event. In general ghouls are middle of the road xp. Farming super mutants will yield way more.
---
I doubt many people gonna waste thier perk point to level up that legendary perk so they can easy steal water or scrap from others. Some people will but it's probably gonna be less than 1% of all players.
---
The prevailing rumor is 250.
---
Camp building is weird, you have to scrap them in the order that the game wants you too if you haven't already try scrapping it from the top down. If you have any walls scrap them first, you have to just figure out what order the game wants you to delete them
---
CHEESE for EVERYONE!
---
Limited time availability except for the raiders/settlers tents.
---
Never thought of using a workshop, definitely learned my lesson. Now if I can get rid of it without rebuilding my camp.
---
Thanks for the workshop info.
---
If either flies in and lands when I summon it, I'm in!
---
Yeah, I've learned from following this sub that the testing has been pretty much non-existent for the shipped in-game content.
---
You can also try blueprinting the whole thing and then deleting the blueprint
---
Do you think this game is like ark or rust? Because it‚Äôs nothing like them
---
Would that be exploiting the game? They ban people for using and sharing exploits.
---
Apparently the plan for vault raids is to repurpose them for the upcoming expeditions content?
---
I would settle for a workbench in my tent to be honest. Sucks having to leave stuff behind sometimes as there none anywhere near, then again I am too lazy to look XD
---
grinding is kind of what I signed up for in a looter shooter..
---
Sorry to say it bro but you're in a waste land, the unlock feature is put there for a reason so don't cry if someone steals your stuff. There's literally a feature put in place to combat this, they become wanted and can then be killed. Not everyone out in the waste is a friendly settler, you're gonna come across some raiders so take care of it and kill them instead of crying lol.
---
Shoutout to the level up while doing three things dailies of yesteryear.
---
I liked getting them all at once.
---
Missions through the order of mysteries, we know they were assassins/spies who were taking down raiders so there could be raid missions on raider spots or spy jobs where you‚Äôd have to photograph their bases (I know I know we all hate the photo missions but if the ability is already there?) we could kill raider leaders or save captives (if you do it without alerting anyone you get a bonus).
---
That one at least has a workaround.
---
If you create a new character, you can visit those places and get them to unlock.
---
May take a few tries, but I've gotten them to check off.
---
Brotherhood in Appalachia: has been explained by game 
---
Xo1: Oxhorn gave a very likely theory 
---
DeathClaw: FEV used on chameleons 
---
If you actually knew the lore of this game, you would realise how much of a f*****g idiot you are.
---
Ok thanks, may I ask, do you know a good way to get screws?
---
It just works.
---
Fucking. Genius.
---
Once you're addicted you don't need to take drugs ever again
---
Edit, but you cna if you want to. Taking the ones you're addicted to will remove the downsides and you will still get your damage boost
---
Definitely should have some type of effect on it like seeing enemies like the berry mental effect.
---
Nah once you are addicted you just have the negative penalties and that‚Äôs it. No need to keep taking the meds. I feel like junkies is kinda one of the more chill ways to play. You don‚Äôt hit as hard as bloodied, but you get more health so.
---
That was fun.
---
Hoards. And to a lesser extent raids. But mainly hoards, some thing like doable 3 did. I enjoyed the rift system a ton
---
Yeah, got mixed what the robot name was.
---
Spotify m8, repeat it all day if ya want
---
If you just killed the Grafton Monster at Charleston Trainyard and were heading north on the railroad tracks toward Charleston Station, that's a random spawn activation point. Yes, the Mothman can be one of the random spawns. I've run into him their a few times. It can also spawn Super Mutants, a robot walking dogs, a robot walking rats (non-hostile) a responder's eyebot, bee swarms, a couple other random enemies, and the good one... 
---
the Charleston Responder's vendor bot. He always sells the Nuka Cola Clock and Cuckoo Clock plans, and his vendor list includes rare clothing items including the hunter's longcoat, longshoreman outfit, clean space suit and clean ranger outfit, among others. I also got the tattered field jacket from him once. If you like collecting rarer outfits, it's a good place to farm.
---
If I lock the doors, will that keep the NPCs from wandering in? I don't mind that so much, but they leave all the doors open. I hate that.
---
I've tried a few times scrapping from the top down but it won't let me scrap the top floor piece. Tried the bottom up. Tried blue printing it all together and scrap. Nothing seems to work yet.
---
Thanks for the input though.
---
Sure, but does the progress unlock account wide?  I.e NW rewards and skins?
---
Wait til you‚Äôre attacked by one!
---
How old is your PS4? Are the cooling fans clean?
---
This is fallout 76. If they don't put in a stupidly long, boring, and annoying grind i would think the devs all got fired.
---
That would be awesome!
---
LB on the placed item in edit mode for Xbox.
---
Yes it does
---
If you continue to hoard and use the chems/alcohol you‚Äôre addicted to, it‚Äôs a big bonus because the addiction penalty goes away and you get the positive effects of the chem while it lasts, which is why many junkies also use Chem Fiend. I‚Äôm a melee Junkie so I also rock Party Boy and consume every bit of booze I encounter. Never need water and my strength is always boosted. If you do any of this stuff it‚Äôs also a good idea to put your addicted items on your favorites wheel.
---
Mauser broomhandle from f3
---
That worked! Thank you!!
---
That event is always amusing when no mobs show up for 5 mins and then you have to go track down the final one.
---
I got stuck inside someone's locked camp that way. Fast travel put me halfway through the floor, so I jumped up while it was loading and then found I was locked in. I can only imagine what they must have thought lol
---
Just server hop.  I know it seems like extra step, but to honest, it is the best thing to do to griefers - let them know they can be ignored.  Don't give them the satisfaction that they actually annoy you.  And server hopping just takes a moment.
---
Oh ok. So Should I use the chem fiend perk card?
---
I like to think of it as a public service.   
---
Also, I never thought of that.
---
That‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôve got my build exactly how I want it so now when I level up I‚Äôm just using the perk cards to get all the commando cards maxed out. That way if I want to swap to stealth commando I can.always cool to be able to switch things up a bit. I‚Äôm sure with commando the dps is way better lol
---
Most PvP players are Junkies. Because of the damage cap, a Junkies faster fire handmade, LMG, or Fixer is the weapon of choice. They also wear Assassin Sentinel armor and spam nuka quantum. You may get off one shot with the gamma gun before they melt you.
---
I mean it‚Äôs up to you. If you wanna use chems then maybe you should use chem fiend. You don‚Äôt need to use the chems to get the same bonus though. You just gotta have the addiction.
---
Yeah see so the brotherhood thing would  fall right under that aforementioned 'rework' category. So a unaffiliated YouTuber is writing Canon lore now? Interesting take but xo1 existing pre war was a clear mistake that has since had fallout fans justify it in a plethora of theories similar to every other retcon. Might I just add that it's Ox's literal job to pick apart, and expand on fallout lore using his own creative liberties that are as lore friendly as possible to fill in blanks. And lol you didn't even know what I meant by death claws which shows how much you know. It made sense for them to exist in early games as well as new Vegas given the warmer climate of those titles, but once they started to creep into dc , boston and Appalachia which would be too cold for a reptile things started to get fuzzy. Xoxo nice try man
---
Funny thing is that low level pvp can be a blast, some of my most fun nw bits is finding another player at the beginning and just punching each other to death. The only saving grace with pvp is that they removed vats targetting that stuff really was op in pvp leaning towards stealth rifle characters. Unfortunately they capped explosive damage so you couldn't just blow those pesky bloody builds away with a 2 shot fatman in 1 hit
---
My cat does this. He talks a big game, but every time he picks a fight with the neighbor's cat he loses and then sulks about it the rest of the day.
---
It takes a while I crafted for almost a month straight.
---
I know it's anecdotal but it has for me.
---
Thank.  This is reassuring.  Perception is OP in NW with frog legs
---
Now that you have an upper floor you can‚Äôt get rid of, try putting another staircase down from that second floor piece and another foundation below the new stairs and try to keep the stairs clear of any objects like trees, water or cliff faces (which is likely why you can‚Äôt move the first set of stairs). Then try to remove the stairs you couldn‚Äôt move before.
---
It's not. Just quite and log in to a new world.
---
After patch 20 they buffed it significantly, all the bosses I killed dropped three star loots for several days in a row. I even made a post thanking them for it. Then apparently they changed their mind and dialed everything back down to shit level.
---
It is 100% still a thing. No one knows what causes it
---
I used to run PA/Heavy Gun with speed Daemon and Marsupial.  Since I got a magic shotgun and CSS I only run PA/Heavy at the SBQ fight. I can literally brush past opponents in dim areas and not be discovered.  In a silo the turrets don't fire until I have left the room. Always use Lvl 3 Sneak.
---
Honestly sounds like Beth should nerf certain builds then
---
The pvp flagging system is broken to it's core, don't try to reason with it.
---
That's not so stealthy though is it?
---
Happened to me yesterday.  I logged in about 3 hours after reset time and had been logged out about an hour prior to it.
---
Make your way south to get excavator power armour, a nice entry level power armour should help you survive more hits.
---
It is a bug in their code. This is getting around the bug in a harmless way, it costs a rad-x PLUS the fast travel caps cost. Plus the Devs have tweeted about using rad-x diluted to get rid of suppressed mutation effects so I dont see what is an exploit here
---
I‚Äôm gonna hope the Enclave make an appearance and mop the floor with them. It could make sense lore wise, increasing the animosity between the two groups.
---
I never use the stupid metal stairs. I had a camp in the mire not too long ago and I went to add lights on a tree above my camp so I created a foundation with the stairs and upper floors connected to it. When I was done with the lights it didn‚Äôt let me remove ANY of the upper floors so I said ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and moved my camp to another place on the map. After that point I don‚Äôt use the stairs unless I know that I will want them there to stay.
---
Just change servers. It‚Äôs routine maintenance for that one server you‚Äôre on. Sorry about the workshops!
---
Oh I wasn‚Äôt suggesting stealth, I was saying new addition in general.
---
Skins for all ranged weapons including gat lasers and railways etc. The ones for tire iron can wait.
---
Ok thank you
---
i pulled a lot of decent 3* stuff before i was level 100 thanks to that event. also the easiest treasury notes in the wasteland
---
I get lead...toys have them.
---
Oh right yeah I'd like to see that!
---
Drink everytime OP said Camp or Theif. Im not gonna lie for the next post just kinda get to the point. There aren't many people who waste their time picking locks in camp, so youre hitting a small niche there and as far as dropping items when your wanted or whatever your suggestion was that could easily be exploited if needed.
---
damn. that sucks, it makes me real anxious.
---
This reminds me.
---
People who lock the communist collectron are enemies of the people
---
damn, i'm sorry. that sucks.
---
I've seen other players do that with the water, too. Appreciate it, man. I seem to have picked every mutation that makes my guy thirsty, even with perks, he drinks more water than could possibly be healthy.
---
I did that. It was funny reading disjointed misogynistic comments directed at an old man.
---
Level-up challenges should be replaced by "Gain X experience" rather than level up. I remember suggesting this close to a year ago.  At some point, leveling up for a character will take much longer, so it makes more sense if it was tied to experience gain rather than asking for players to level up.
---
That would probably be the best solution, since then you wouldn't need to make a new character to level up in a respectable amount of time each time.
---
Use the railway, it literally looks like a manhood made of solid metal.
---
I'll try that, thanks for the idea.
---
Yeah it's hit me twice so far. Thankfully never got my weeklies.at level 68 you are on schedule to finish though. Think you're suppose to be at 65 before the new weeklies come out
---
That‚Äôs a reasonable wait time, I‚Äôd say.
---
The fact that we see posts like this several times a week shows me that Bethesda needs to rework their warning text when this happens. 
---
It‚Äôs routine maintenance, happens to every server eventually. They need reboots or other technical maintenance. The game is not going down, it‚Äôs just the one server (or more accurately the server hosting the world you‚Äôre on and likely a few others). Just jump to a different world.
---
This is why we need workshop wide blueprints. 1 per workshop, or even a max of 5 each, that would build the workshop up the way we build it every time we take that one.
---
I for one would take workshops every log on, if I could build it up to how I like it almost instantly, rather than wasting 5-10 minutes building the same layout as I built a hundred times before.
---
Its alright, I've been able to grind up into the 80s, so I should be able to finish.  Really sucks for those that don't play as much.
---
Or the Enclave could make an appearance and wipe them out, creating even more animosity between the two factions.
---
Ok thanks
---
The Queen ignores 70% of damage. And you are not calculating armour in either. Just because your pip boy says 300 dose not mean you hit for 300. On anything.
---
Queen has an outright 70% damage reduction effect on her, and that's before taking into account her resistances.  So, excluding Sneak Bonuses or Critical Hits, expecting a baseline that's less than a third of what the Pip-Boy says is typical.
---
Queen has a passive 70% damage reduction effect on her.
---
I want you take take a look at a chameleon, then look at a DeathClaw, how many differences can you spot, exactly ... do you think a story high killing machine gives a f**k about the weather. Besides, there are less DeathClaws in Appalachia than in fnv so that could be why. And as I have said, a mistake does not justify ruining everything, that's why your parents haven't divorced yet.
---
I wish this was the case. I set up Daguerre in a shack outside of my main house with a locked door. My house is also locked. It didn't matter, she would glitch into the main house constantly and then be in the way of everything I needed to use. Same with wandering traders who randomly appear inside my camp. I always know somebody has glitched inside when I hear a guitar playing.
---
I'm just about to do the same thing and move. Only thing is I've barely got enough play time to do the challenges and the SCORE stuff.
---
ORRRR I'l just leave the POS there. Lol
---
Easy, serum
---
65 isn‚Äôt bad at all, she‚Äôs got really thick skin that negates most of incoming damage.
---
I keep getting "Cop a Squatter" randomly. And at some point, someone else kills whatever it is or it picks a fight with other NPCs and then it completes and I get credit.
---
Oh my, you haven't seen "aggressive complaining" yet.
---
As for "out of place"? Keep on believing this when you get explanations, you'll get far.
---
i hate doing that event. half the time he gets stuck and after 5-6 minutes i leave.
---
i'm usually doing 275-300 on any thing other
---
I put a flamingo on the staircase and I don't find NPC traders sleeping in my bed anymore. Players can jump. NPCs not so much.
---
Dang! Thanks.
---
Yup thats always nice when it happens, depending where it pops up I‚Äôll just leave it and let a scorchbeast clear out the squatters
---
I really do get that that's an option. But it comes with additional costs -- time, hoping my CAMP can be placed, losing the workshops I've taken over, losing the event that just started. 
---
It's definitely a way to escape it, but it seems crazy that the game mechanic would allow someone to initiate PVP and leave you only two options: 1) kill them (obviously their design intent) and give them even *more* griefing power, or 2) run away at real cost to you.
---
Sugar Grove and Watoga are usually my stops, plenty of desk fans and assaultrons to decapitate.
---
Honestly I usually hoover up enough junk that I typically have 30+ everytime I deposit things into my scrap box and I sell them for 3 caps each whenever I hit 5,000, haven't had to focus farm for them in a long time so there may be better places now.
---
Uhm... what about a Ghoul Faction? I mean hello? Goodneighbor? Anybody remember that town? I would love a ghoul faction, a mole miner city, and as well as a Vault Dweller Faction which would be 76ers. 
---
I‚Äôd vote most for 76ers tho, because I‚Äôm tired of doing bullshit for others, why not give us a chance to rebuild Appalachia OUR way?
---
ah oka. I saw someone with a bloodied handmade and pipboy says 280 damage and sure enough he's doing that damage on the queen
---
Atleast big events will have a chance to drop items from Purv's pool once the update goes live
---
All Star Wars jokes aside, I run bloody on main, junkies on alt. I‚Äôm geared for it, some quality guns, and perks as well. Junkies doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to bloody, so maybe I‚Äôm doing it wrong. 
---
I‚Äôm pulling nearly 2k with a bloody explosive shotgun. Barely 600 with a junkies explosive. That‚Äôs without bobbles or drugs. 
---
If you are talking pve vs regular characters? Sure. Boss fights, you‚Äôll do ok. PvP? Ehhh.. doubt it. They can pop stims quicker than you can hurt them. 
---
Bloody does it all. You just need to not get hit.
---
Agreed. This is my first experience with it but the warning makes it seem like it‚Äôs system-wide and not just the world I‚Äôm in.
---
since I only started playing roughly since the release of Wastelanders, my best legendary weapons BY FAR came from the Fasnacht event. I ran it a lot, and yes I got a lot of common masks, but I also got every mask except the Deathclaw Mask. And (apparently) unlike others, I rarely had a problem with getting a tag on the  legendary at the end. I'd say maybe 10% of the time I didn't, that's not bad imo.
---
So yeah, I miss Fasnacht. I'm also primarily a solo player, never had a friend or played on a team until the public teams became available, so Fasnacht was a nice opportunity to interact with other players in a pretty relaxing event.
---
Sorry to hear that, it sounds like you're only option is to move your camp, because then every structure will be blue printed and you can just scrap the blueprint from there
---
It will speed up loading but you may still suffer matchmaking time (which I even have on PC) but loading will generally be great. I previously played on PS4 with a hybrid SSD and even it was faster, you‚Äôll basically always be the first person in the strike etc. (Careful-some strikes don‚Äôt ‚Äústart‚Äù until everyone spawns in so enemies, quest steps etc won‚Äôt appear at first! The lake of shadows is especially bad with this)
---
A trader crawled into bed with my SO once. I wish I would've taught her a lesson but we couldn't stop laughing.
---
\* hoards
---
It all depends on the resistances.
---
Waiting to login doesn't completely prevent it, but it does seem to help your chances.
---
There is a timer reset too but I haven't been able to nail down exactly how long it is, pretty sure its either 40 or 48 hours.
---
Yea that event can be pretty bugged. Sometimes he wiggles himself out of those places.... sometimes not
---
No evidence for it, but certainly seems like it‚Äôs leading into more. My guess is 4* enemies are coming next year and this is probably them testing out new legendaries to see how they fair with lower quality gear. If players can do a lot with a crappy cursed shovel it will probably decide how a cursed Powerfist does etc...
---
So having the deliverer skin in fo76 would ruin everything? Why such power in a simple skin. Hey man you can keep throwing insults but they're cleary the bandaids used by a cowered to hold together a crumbling argument. I've said my piece man, there's nothing left to prove so peace, love and goodnight ‚ù§
---
There‚Äôs nothing you can do to avoid it.  Some tips and suggestions you‚Äôll see come from some very well meaning players, but they are the equivalent of old wives‚Äô tales.  I‚Äôve played nuclear winter before and after reset, and no autocompletes, I‚Äôve played during reset, no autocompletes.  I‚Äôve personally suggested crashing out when you first load in might cause it, but I ultimately have no clue.  We can only hope it‚Äôll get fixed soon.
---
Did it yesterday: selected "join event" on the map and was transferred... Inside one of the bot holding cylinders!
---
Thankfully it opens after 30-40 seconds, and i was able to move out.
---
...i am a robot?
---
Are you using the stabilize perk in the Intelligence tree to get the armor penetration?
---
I never understood the point of locking things. I honestly don‚Äôt care if anybody takes 6 water out of my purifiers or walks into my house. What‚Äôs the point of locking doors if they needed to repair a piece of armor or weapon? 
---
If you‚Äôre so scared they‚Äôre gonna damage your stuff, 99.99% of the time, they really don‚Äôt give a shit and are just there to buy your junk. I‚Äôm the person who leaves everything unlocked because I do occasionally get people that come in and marvel at my camp in awe. 
---
But if you‚Äôre one of those nosy annoying people that gets in my way and shoots me with explosive weapons while I‚Äôm trying to build my camp... expect your camp to get bombed to shit by explosive bait. Sorry, not sorry.
---
TY.
---
The previous brotherhood was only a small fraction and not the true force we know from other regions. No doubt they'll be sending mass forces to deal with the scorched ( which are the enclaves fault they exsist) since they were told its an extinction level event before they lost contact with the appliachan brotherhood.
---
The only reason we knew about the presidential stuff (IIRC) is because people broke in to the dev room on pc. 
---
Vaults raids as mentioned missed their target, survival mode wasn‚Äôt great and while it could have been improved, the number of players that played it did not justify the time/ effort by Beth.
---
If you say so.
---
Half the time that thingy you gotta pick up for him spawns under the map.
---
Did not know about those ones. Thanks
---
lol
---
...do give a shit?
---
Fertilizer?
---
For those, yes. The perk packs are character specific, but that‚Äôs no different than the Pioneer Scout rewards too.
---
We will eventually. There‚Äôs a set of power armor in the files and I believe a beret that hasn‚Äôt been released yet; so they‚Äôre clearly aware people want more Enclave. My guess is they‚Äôre saving it for a future update where they return, like what they‚Äôre doing with the Brotherhood.
---
They will stop us and confiscate energy weapons?
---
You can do that, but it requires a decent time investment to get your special high enough.  Specials accumulate until level 50, so realistically you would have to get your adventure mode for NW only character to that, then you have to regrind/reacquire all your NW perk cards which would conceivably take longer since your rate of overseer ticket acquisition is going to be low since you arent going to be getting much in the way of duplicates.
---
Okay, thank you. I assume you get those by hitting max rep or am I wrong?
---
&gt;deliverer skin
---
I would be ok with a skin, but you said "as alternative to the fixer" as in a vanilla weapon.
---
I usually don‚Äôt until I wanted that Grognak bundle at 35% offüòÇ
---
I'm a tad miffed about it as it's being sold as this obvious good thing when, in the game's history, the BoS shaking down the other factions for supplies is kind of why everything fell apart in the first place. The responders would love to help, but demanding that they turn over everything that they have Or Else?
---
.
---
Screw those guys.
---
Sheer semantics over the name of the weapon, call it the "corrector" and all our woes are resolved ‚ù§
---
Sheilded vault suit, inspirational perk card, herd mentality and herbivore mutations, well rested and use brain fungus soup and cranberry relish foods. Most people recommend west tek or huntersville as spots which are great but heavily used. My advice is go for the sentry bots first before the super mutant places like west tek. The robot hq place first on the east of map is a quick 3000+ exp depending on how many people in the group. Next teleport to whitespring main building 2 sentry bots right there, you could kill ghouls everywhere but again its heavily farmed. After killing sentry bots go left through car park to the other entrance where theres another sentry bot, kill it. Next one is up to you there is one that spawns south of the golf club on the greens but I teleport to the whitesprings station as one sometimes spawns there at the entrance there, if not just go south and towards the service entrance 2 sometimes spawns in the car park there.
---
Depends on how the body falls.
---
I said it was an option, and it is. And getting to level 50 on a second character is not that challenging.
---
adding you.
---
It seems to me that they could‚Äôve used better wording in their broadcast, just seems so arrogant in their message, if they are coming in peace they should reflect that in the message, I don‚Äôt particularly dislike the brotherhood but they are asking for our supplies ( ie junk) but not really being friendly about it
---
I didn't have a problem and I'm nearing level 600.
---
It is most definitely still a thing, and nobody really knows how to increase or decrease your chances of it occurring (although I follow the suggestion of "log out before the reset happens", even if there's nothing to suggest that it actually helps). It (thankfully) hasn't happened to me yet, although I haven't actually logged in today after the reset, so just crossing my fingers here.
---
I believe that one of the purposes of giving us these extra daily challenges was to account for the S.C.O.R.E. lost due to this issue.
---
You have to at least google ‚ÄúKhorne‚Äù first, bud.

I never use it either. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I don't even have doors to my house anymore. The amount of times someone picks the lock and buys off my vending machine when I am max caps is mad annoying. All I do now is enter building mode and replace the wall with a door frame for the second it takes to walk in and then cancel the build menu. Fun fact, doing this never shows a door for anyone else, if anyone sees you it will just look like you ran through the brick wall.
---
The raiders/settlers tent are available in the store for IRL money.  The rest were FO1st offers.
---
Oh good! Cuz I feel really bad ass with my bow sneaking around.
---
Understood. Thank you
---
only for the quest to make the excavator set..
---
Most definitely, though they buffed super mutant drops they drop a lot of 5mm now I sometimes see 500 of one makes my heavy gunner very happy
---
Because they‚Äôre not in Appalachia right now
---
New player from Game Pass and while I was really enjoying the game, now that I've hit endgame there really isn't much to do but stand around and wait for events once you've done all your dailies which are easy knocked out in an hour. Little disappointing. There really seems like there would be stuff all to do if not for the Legendary run.
---
I doubt that, my BE HM ultracite shows 320 in the pip, it only does 280 non crits and 300 crits for damage on the SBQ. Damage on other critters is a different matter altogether.
---
You got a pistol? I killed a 3 star glowing and got a hunters tire iron or baton...some melee I couldn't wait to get rid of. TBH I got a better reward from the no star one that died when someone nuked the area.
---
Weird, I haven't seen those anywhere, I have raiders dlc but it wasn't included (figures). Well guess I'll wait until it appears if I still keep the sub till then xD Thanks anyway!
---
I'm lvl 254 and I never used a PA.
---
Only during the radiation rumble event to collect ore when nobody else is doing it.
---
Legendary armor doesn't work while in PA and this is reason enough for me not to use PA's.
---
Also unarmed weapons doesn't work, you can not sit down you need constantly fusion cores ect. ect....
---
How did you manage to initiate the external connection from inside the bot cylinders?
---
...maybe you ARE a robot.
---
I honestly started an entire new character just to do the level up challenges. Kinda gave me an excuse to run through the game and see how the main story changed with Wastelanders, but its still ridiculously tedious
---
I think each world stays active for only 12 hours.
---
Well the first question to ask would be if he‚Äôs/she‚Äôs using PA.
---
I always told Davenport I had sold his photos and still got the Treasury Notes as a reward.
---
Note that rep is not fully gated since you can farm it from server hopping random encounters.  It is slow as all hell, but it is possible for the dedicated.
---
No one dupped cork... why would they?
---
My main is PA my second isn‚Äôt
---
No Chances. 
---
Playing on the (latest? Still?) PS4 Pro 7216B and getting frame drops here and there, especially in classic  situations (many enemies, player characters, shooting, such stuff). In certain situations framerate is simply poo and no fun at all.
---
Sometimes its worse than other times. Simply turning the console off and on again and jumping into a new FO76 public server could help (sometimes i could swear servers are related to some framerate drops too).
---
Best you could do. Maybe it helps a bit.
---
I mean it was even worse a year ago or so. Right now its playable for me to be fair. Since servers on PS4 doesnt seem to crash that often than before, too.
---
Yes, it happened to me twice.  And logging off before the new daily challenges reset does not work.  SAD
---
If you have a fairly decent gun I highly recommend the Yao guai hunt quest in the mire, kill its minions then let them respawn rinse repeat.
---
I only ever get ultracite jetpack plans. And judging from the player vendor machines, so does everyone else.
---
Never use it but I carry one with me at all times, excavator suit.
---
Both fallout 4 and fallout 76 on ps4 have FPS issues, with fallout 4 ive seen in far harbor it can drop to 15fps. source :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYpYgq-Ln\_c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYpYgq-Ln_c)
---
Maybe they‚Äôre acting like they‚Äôre coming in to take charge because that‚Äôs their intention. Hopefully they‚Äôre not just painted as knights in shining power armor and are instead a flawed faction‚Äîone we can choose to align with or not. 
---
Based on existing lore, the BOS in CA was divided over whether to be helpful in the wasteland or close themselves off and hoard tech. Maxson favoring the former and getting his way until he died, when the isolationists would get their way. 
---
From the messages that have been decrypted, it sounds like the group heading to Appalachia isn‚Äôt exactly in line with BOS principles. The ‚ÄúFractured Steel‚Äù title hints at that as well. I honestly hope they‚Äôre a bunch of entitled wannabe authoritarians who everybody hates.
---
I don't want a backpack for my power armor I want a travel trailer.
---
Like one of those little u-haul trailers that people who live in apartments use when they move.
---
You an me both -.- I don't expect the game guiding me everywhere by holding my hand but some tips as objectives would be nice. And not once anyone said anything during the event, everybody expects you to know everything already.  sigh
---
I always figured once you‚Äôre addicted, food and water need increase substantially. As it already irritates me, I never tried a Junkie build.
---
If you have Carnivore (mutation) and Strange in Numbers (1* CHA perk), the meat stew gives +12% XP, not 5. And make your team a public building team and the +4 INT boost gives another +8% XP or so. And eat a boiled scorchbeast brain with Carnivore and Strange in Numbers for another +8 INT and therefore +16% XP. If you‚Äôre bloodied build with Unyielding armor, that‚Äôs even more INT. You can be running around earning at least double XP full-time with not too much effort.
---
Also if you use one of the Mothman beds from the Atom shop, the +5% bonus is called Kindred Spirit which is the same as the regular bed bonus but lasts 3 hours instead of 2.
---
It is frustrating. I hate how they've locked it in a way. Should be like any other armour that can be traded. If someone doesn't have much time to play then they could trade or buy some from other venders but no you have to grind like fu*k to get it.
---
Do got to love it,
---
Pre-wastelanders 76 "okay the Enclave has a "living" member and a ton of robots, so it's most likely will be the one to return, followed by Freestates who are the only faction where we don't see most of it's main members actually die/dead bodies"
---
Post-wastelanders "okay here's raiders, some Responders NPCs, and the BoS is coming back as well"
---
Hello there!
---
-enthusiastic Mr Handy
---
I sometimes do wonder why certain players lock their entire camp... Am i really thay filthy that im not allowed to use the couch...
---
What are you guys talking about? I have 425 carry weight with my excavator armor. I wear it all the time unless I need a jetpack then I swap to ultracite   the evidence is there from Angry Turtles testing that there really is no difference between the power armors. Watch this video about the best power armor part 2  there is literally a 3 damage difference between excavator and t51b after 10 shots from a super mutant. I know bethesda's numbers will make you think different, but an actual gameplay it's not worth mentioning the difference. I literally carry around 6 heavy weapons and still have 150 carry weight.
---
The challenge to deliver 200 million cork in 5 days will never be completed I know that much.
---
Heck, sometimes it just shows up as regular location markers. It'll even show up as a workshop for me but be a location icon for my friend who's in the same server. Don't ya just love Bugthesda games?
---
I was on one last night pretty late and got this message. Missed being able to loot the last event boss by a second :(
---
took mine out of my camp ... dumb
---
Totally agree with you, if someone is in a dire need of water or stimpack I have no issue just giving them some and I‚Äôm sure most of the community would do the same for my character, messing with someone‚Äôs camp isn‚Äôt cool, it‚Äôs a shame people are still doing that,
---
It's also got the highest concentration of brain fungus in that tunnel if you need a lot.
---
Fasnacht man, nothing else
---
No effect on thirst or hunger other than like I said, if you‚Äôre addicted to booze you never need water again.
---
That assaultron blade looks pretty close to a chainsword... So it can plausibly work. Just need power fists and plasma pistols for effect. Luckily Salamanders are set with the flamer.
---
Nuclear Winter is one big fail.
---
Love this ... collect records :)
---
Worst. Nanny. Ever.
---
same.
---
This sounds more like anti pvp propaganda.
---
Just happened to me this morning... Out 2250 S.C.O.R.E. today. Anyone know if Bethesda is responding to these issues with any compensation? I've put in my ticket using the form, and my screenshot, but the form says the "feedback" will be received and not to expect a response...
---
Heck, I'd be happy to trade with people who already know how to make the same weapons or armor, would be sorta limited that way
---
The problem is that FO76, after an individual hits a certain amount of total play time, lacks the 'innate fun' to keep someone going.
---
Wastelanders has walled off, for me anyway, wanting to play any of the alts I had leveled up to try out different playstyles.  As getting on the rep and bullion grind for any of them makes no sense since it is no fun.
---
When BoS lands I'm going to empty out several of them of all their junk and delete them.
---
though then the BoS would've gotten even more reason to mention that chapter somewhere if the Enclave started a war with the BoS.
---
Nope, just complaining for the sake of complaining.
---
Unlimited stash space really isn‚Äôt pay to win. It just gives you the ability to hoard more stuff and scrap anything anywhere at any time. Pay to win would be buying a 5 star weapon and obliterating everything. P.S - $12.99 a month is fucking nothing lol. I don‚Äôt understand why everybody thinks that‚Äôs so expensive.
---
Not many people realize this but before the game even came out, they told us they were gonna have private servers as subscriptions... some people just want everything to be exactly the way THEY want it. Ignorance.
---
Sometimes I'm the only one collecting them as well, I burn a lot of rad-away and stimpacks and if I see nobody's helping I'll just stop because it's a waste of resources and I'd rather get more exp and loot, as it seems it's the only thing most people care about.
---
Bruh what are they building
---
I see not much has changed lol
---
Always got it with me. Only us it for the SBQ.
---
Would be a pretty amusing mutation
---
Fair point!
---
Shut up and take my money!
---
Mhm perhaps I‚Äôm wrong. I stopped doing Daily quest for him a long time ago. Maybe I didn‚Äôt remember it correctly.
---
The Ripper is all you need.
---
You are awfully condescending there.
---
To be honest in my opinion it's way worse for people who actually have stuff to do in life, I'd much rather be able to play once a week for multiple hours so I can do other things within the week instead of being forced to log in every day in order to do dailies and get anywhere with end-game content.
---
Hence why I just have to miss the progress more often than not.
---
No "One" person can initiate PVP. It takes two people outside of a workshop to trigger PVP. 
---
If both parties have agreed by tagging, both should be given the option to try again after dying. 
---
Sure one person can start the process by attacking first but it isn't pvp until the tagged tags back. So both should get the same options to seek revenge after death.
---
Just don't shoot back in the first place. I understand you reasons for not wanting to give a server with WS and stuff. But if that's the case don't get involved. If me and my buddy set out for PVP we are prepared for the consequences. Camps hidden (keep pet alive) junk dropped, secret agent on.
---
I got a 3 star tse rifle off a random bloodbug once.  Just cutting cross country and ugh, I hate bugs....my guy has trouble hitting (melee) anything on the ground or over his head. But for once, it was worth it.
---
A comically oversized wine bottle obviously
---
That‚Äôs not true. Because one of the guys I killed said the heart emoji made him smile.
---
For a heavy gunner build, it's a must
---
Haven't you ever had a paper cut?
---
Good. Good.
---
But Jack Russell's are prolific randy little fucks, I'm sure his bloodline lives on :)
---
No it‚Äôs the fact that they‚Äôre giving us challenges they know we can‚Äôt complete. And challenges that make absolutely no sense at all
---
I only use it in the mine to collect lead
---
the pistol is literally on an advertisement poster in camp venture, there would be nothing "egregious" about it being in 76.
---
if its on a poster, this implies that its commercially available, and thus likely wide spread or commonplace, its a Walter ppk, its pretty damn generic.
---
id take the 1911 over it if i had to choose but they both need to added in.
---
as far as the cryolator they have yet to answer any questions concerning its retcon but i highly suspect that it may have something to do with vault 96, which is supposed a cryo experimentation type of vault. that, or something to do with the one tnt dome that has cryo equipment in it.
---
bottom line is, much of the core gameplay in this game is set up like a looter/shooter, and the loot is getting stale. more weapons need to be added irrespective to "lore" concerns people have.
---
I'd buy fallout 1st if they'd remove this stuff, it's a waste with caps on how much you can play and enjoy the game.
---
Hell I've started plopping down the seedy shack so people would have to get through several locks to get to my stuff.
---
I couldn't agree more, I would much rather play once or twice a week in longer sessions where I am able to actually get into the game properly than being forced to log in every single day to do dailies if I want to progress my gear at all.
---
I think a sensible solution would be to have the time-frame changed, so for example instead of having a daily cap you could have much larger weekly ones, so players have more freedom about when they can play.
---
Though I am not sure how that would play out with more hardcore players.
---
Oh yeah there's that issue but if you don't kill them it won't make ash piles. I just tag quick and then let the rest of the people finish them off so it turns them into meat piles. I see maybe one or two ash piles from someone getting a shot in at the same time as me but it's minimal.
---
Damage bug, it's been around since the beta. Bethesda has been pretending it's gone since january 2019, I don't think they addressed its existence since then. Right now it happens mostly on tesla rifles and flamers/plasma flamers, but most end-game weapons are *capable* of triggering it
---
Last one I did had the sb spawning just as the timer ended. Event failed but we got the spawn.
---
okay, I suppose this is a way of creating a new type of node then? a blend node? Works (presumably) the same way the "in dark areas" works. Each world object simply has a numerical score that is a set of numbers the first three of which are taken from applying the (OP youtube video) fractal factoring of edge geometry, maybe the nest three describe color and the last number describes shade/highlight. So each object has been precalculated to have a 7 digit (what we will call) "Blend" score, and it can work like a node. Each character model, outfit, weapon, armor etc. should have a blend score. AI simply looks at adjacent nodes. Maybe another stealth metric wouldn't help this iteration of the game. Anyways, thanks for your thoughts!
---
Problem with all this. 
---
Wanted players become Wanted and Killable the INSTANT they break a lock. Not a few minutes later as reading your post seems to suggest. 
---
Now as for loss of resources. It's truly not much but the amount of thieves that pick a lock carrying junk or wander around with junk far outways a few bits for repairing a lock. Plus when people are wanted it's not always your camp. Sure wanted players suck but I love bounty hunting. Even at the loss of fast travel caps. It's a small amount of fun breaking some of the monotony of the daily grind.
---
Not all the BOS are friendly.
---
I wouldn't mind it so much if they actually did something about it. Like, enforce strict preventative measures and deal with anybody who slips through the cracks. But their constant ignoring of dupes and this recent laughable "ban" wave are the equivalent of rolling out the red carpet for cheaters and letting them know they can do as they please. The game is their playground and bethesda not only acknowledges it but willingly contributes towards it
---
I don't think that's my issue, but they makes sense, and is good to know.
---
Meanwhile on PC last night, I snapped a pic of someone wearing Duchess's outfit. That's gotta be straight out of the dev room. I could report them but Bethesda won't do anything.
---
Concrete foundations are the only remaining way of embedding a base into a cliff. I have one that is 9 stories tall thanks to being embedded in a sizeable cliff....
---
It's 12.99 a month on top of buying the entire game already. And we've seen that money isn't really going anywhere given we still get shit like basic UV Map fails like on the Blood Eagle skin.
---
What‚Äôs interesting to me is the raiders and settlers came without asking for anything, they just showed up, however the brotherhood wants us all to just willingly give them supplies. And telling we will be taking atlas, I‚Äôm gonna be really frustrated if we all donate these supplies and get some lame reward, we know from the brotherhood that they aren‚Äôt the sharing type so I‚Äôm curious as to what they have for us,
---
It's a sub currency like dollars/cents. 10 cork to the cap.
---
Atomic ship outfit you could get before wastelanders.
---
Hide. Survive.
---
Bush wookie. Just stay hidden and survive as long as you can. Best way to get xp anyway.
---
Nah. The last time they publicly addressed it was the january 29 2019 patch notes, where they claimed to fix it. I reported it since then and even got a reply from one of their CMs that they will "look into it" but you know how that goes
---
Open perk card packs in the lobby, if you have enough saved.
---
Would this work with golf balls? So I could pick them up them pick up another 180 items and the game will respawn them in?
---
This, all of this sounds viable.
---
Bethesda's response to bug reports and bugs leads me to think your comment might be trolling.
---
My characters flesh is probably melted into the power armor frame from how much I use it
---
I was looking the map for events when i noticed a wanted player near my camp,never a good sign,i found the raider ammomachine unlocked and the ammo stolen, so i followed him and killed him taking all his junk,he followed me back and started cussing me and calling me a griefer, i guess for some people the concept of locked property being off limits is beyond compehension.
---
Yeah gt is FlamesOfShadow (I was a Yu Yu Hakusho fan at 14), I should be on tonight after 8. I can just drop you 250 unless you needed to buy more.
---
Good point. I'll record it happening.
---
No need when my DR and ER are over 600, I can use a backpack and my jetpack doesn't need fusion cores. Yeah, yeah, yeah I've heard all about the damage reduction from PA but this game is incredibly easy. I'm able to tank and kill most enemies with a few bursts of my automatic guns to the head. Chinese suit for anything with rads, no need to bring radaway with me because I can just go to my camp and use the shower.
---
I don't use it for the simple fact that legendary armor exists with weight reduction effects. If they finally release the datamined legendary PA, and any of the effects are weapon weight reduction, I will happily hop on to a PA build. For now, the extra damage/radiation resistance are not worth giving up 15 potential bonuses
---
Ok man I'll send a message so I can join you later, my gt is Activepanda26
---
Just out of curiosity, how are you faring with your bow ? I was using them for most of the game but gave up and switched to rifles recently for endgame content, any luck doing any damage to the SBQ or the Wendigo Collosus?
---
And I'm not using PA either, gotta love my stealth suit \^\^
---
They love a glass of wine with a meal :-)
---
Explosive is no good against queenie. Go with speedy.
---
Dude, the game can be bought for 20 bucks. That‚Äôs also nothing. 
---
Oh so, I guess Bethesda can shut off all of their private servers then. What would happen? The game would shut off, because THOSE PRIVATE SERVER PLAYERS are SUPPLYING BETHESDA $$$ to keep working on this game while all you regulars don‚Äôt buy anything from the atomic shop, so they have to rely solely on those people for income. 
---
Oh so, anytime Bethesda comes out with something new in the shop you don‚Äôt like, does that entitle all the people to free shit they want? I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick or hostile to anybody, but it pisses me off when somebody spouts about the game because they didn‚Äôt get what they want, so they demand free shit.
---
P.S I don‚Äôt really care if I hurt your sensitive ass feelings. It‚Äôs a game, and games have to make money somehow. It‚Äôs like you guys think they don‚Äôt need money. If that was the case, this game would cease to exist and you would be shit out of luck if you wanted everything to be free and included with base game. Also wouldn‚Äôt have Fallout to play anymore. Cuz Bethesda got sick of y‚Äôall‚Äôs whiny bullshit.
---
I like how I can build a huge mansion filled with luxurious furniture, advanced machinery, working power, water purifiers, and more for less than 1000 wood and steel, some cloth, plastic, and copper but the brotherhood needs hundreds of millions of cork to build their base
---
I wasn‚Äôt asking about explosive vs firerate I was asking about prime vs speedy receiver
---
This 1000%. If it can work with a freakin foundation, a wood floor panel should be edgable also.
---
Having to pay caps to travel to your own workshop is also an unwelcome development
---
I rocked that outfit a full year after buying it, always had folks asking to take a pic a they'd never seen one before...
---
It happened to me last night for the first time, 4 challenges auto completed. My camp is in a popular spot so I had to find a new server...four times in a row. I'm convinced the game kept trying to dump me in the same server. That's the most that's ever happened before and I'm sure it's what caused the bug to happen. This game has problem with putting me next to Slocum Joe's when my camp in across the street and river.
---
It will take a lot of time regardless, but you get plenty of XP if you can hide long enough to reach the top 10. I'm not sure when the next time will be, but definitely dedicate some NW gameplay when there is double XP event again.
---
The Grognak bundle is still available. I just got it yesterday.
---
Projecting much? Maybe I don't have baby diapies to change while wifey allows me out of my designated "man cave" area.
---
I'll get right on that...
---
Do you chuckle at 130 decibels?
---
Shit! ... ... I yelled at seven people, nothing, I too am somewhere
---
even a small boost in carry weight would be nice.
---
This is why i use Excavator Power armor with the carry weight mods.
---
...and give full sets away to people.
---
If would probably be useful to make a list of the songs that play during your play session and count how many are used for Appalachia Radio.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Appalachia_Radio
---
Its that happy happy joy joy SHOOT IN THE FACE thing. I WOULD be walking around with a big add machete in an apocalypse killing things listening to ridiculously joyful music
---
They aren‚Äôt doing anything about it, I‚Äôve lost 26,000 score so far.
---
It's the BOS, they don't find things, they find people who have things they want and take them.
---
Where are those letters from?
---
Time to start farming for golf balls lol
---
I want a doggy.
---
Gladly, play in a way that doesn't waste other people's time, because you know when you put those rounds in, the only reason is "Well, here I have a ton of useless ammo that nobody wants, let me put it in my vendor on the off chance that some scrub wanders by and buys it (with the handful of caps a low level tends to have) instead of making his or her own. If nobody buys it, at least it will get high level people to visit my camp and possibly buy my garbage. Either way, I have nothing to lose, except for that high level player's time, f that dude."
---
Quit making excuses for your deceptive behavior.
---
if it unlocked raids or dungeons or anything fun i would think differently. but a score event i wont need by then and a BOS flag just aren‚Äôt doing it for me.
---
Yeah I love the game but 1400 among every NPC in the game I don't play as much any more
---
Same here. I'm level 68 with a 50 cal sniper build with all the sneak perks and sniping perks also the nightime one as well.
---
Or maybe just not bother with PvP since their entire damage/balancing system is super ill suited to it.
---
accessing the dev room isn't required anymore. Some people already figured out how to spawn items themselves.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been very vocal on this...never in my years of gaming have I seen the people who are the least responsible get penalized the most....Bethesda has most of the blame for making such as glitchable game. I used to run a glitching YouTube channel just for fun never for gaining the upper hand and it‚Äôs pathetic how easy this game is to find glitches on. Then the people doing the glitches are the second most responsible but it‚Äôs us that get screwed the most
---
My point is that it's not good for my build, and I'm not gonna change my build to make it work for me. Being disappointed with it doesn't mean it's  not good for other people; why are people getting so butt-hurt about this?
---
A thumbsup from me for actually reading the article üëç
---
Ok after 8gmt? And do you by any chance have any bloodied heavy weapons for trade
---
cork is an insulator and a good conductor......why would they be confused?
---
I dont get why the weapons show that they can go up to five stars but only drop up to three
---
Pure legendary prefix :  +5% perk effectiveness per piece of gear as long as you have no mutations!
---
I found the same thing today, found a spot I could get through into his camp which lead to underground stairs, 20 ammo factories filling the vendors.
---
thank you.
---
looting is reasonable again.
---
I use a set of Excavator to mine lead and until the Chinese Stealth Suit came out I used it for radioactive zones. 
---
That's it. I've never liked power armor and wear it as little as possible.
---
I'm ready to oppose the BOS invasion.  Those guys are dicks.
---
They've probably communicated with the fanboy and demanded tribute upon their return in exchange for not killing everyone/everything. 
---
At least Foundation/Crater were able to do things for themselves. BoS we'll probably have to pay "protection". Maybe their missions will be beating up innocent settlers who haven't paid their protection money for the month.
---
It‚Äôs not just the skin, it‚Äôs with the normal Gatling gun too
---
"time gating" isn't new and I enjoy it. there's too many things to do to get upset that you can't infinitely grind for those rewards.
---
The best thing is they aren't even achieving the things they were trying to, the very first week they introduced these mechanics dupers and exploiters found ways around to trade those regardless and the only thing Bethesda has done is inconvenience the normal player that "can't" get around those restrictions without exploiting themselves. Hell...people found out how to spawn in items on their own. Bethesda's reaction? "Now you normal players get your ability to trade the new fancy stuff removed!"
---
&gt; This sort of slow burn, shitty monetization is stuff mobile games are made of
---
*MMOs laughing nervously*
---
Community event, legendary run, the Destiny Playbook is strong. And that playbook fucking sucks.
---
Atleast the normal skin has it closest to the drum edge, I can aim a little accordingly but agreed
---
That sounds like a New Russian slogan.
---
I think just having any significant amount of rads and having healing factor will cause this. Maybe any rads at all and healing factor. Reason I did that is I have a friend who sees this bug all the time and he doesn't use unyielding or bloodied, but has healing factor and keeps at least some rads to take advantage of the perks that give you bonuses for having them. He actually might see it more than my other friend who runs full bloodied/unyielding.
---
i once had him die travelling over an open fire, once he revived he'd immediately down himself again. never did the event again
---
Theres no details yet, but it'll probably be a wastelanders style mission  that will stay in the game.
---
Details - https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/19lD84ailufdG6cgVdqls2/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-fortifying-atlas-and-quakecon-details
---
The Provisions are rewarded for every 250 materials i beleive and rewards the same things as the Christmas Gifts and the Pails from the Treasure Hunter event minus all the mounted plans.
---
kill the aggressor, get the free caps, and just switch servers. Being haunted by a player you killed makes sense regardless if you retaliated instead of initiated the attack because you can ignore to aggression if you chose to.
---
You‚Äôre absolutely right, I suppose they couldn‚Äôt do that without mentioning it somewhere. Maybe defecting or going rogue or failure would make more more sense.
---
Really should be able to have your gear on while in it. With my gear my carry weight is almost to 400 without a maxed strong back. I put on PA or a Hazmat suit and I can‚Äôt move at all. 
---
Was so close to buying the Responder Skin for PA because I think it looks awesome but it‚Äôs at the point where wearing it isn‚Äôt useful
---
I don‚Äôt have much faith in them right now as playing the older fallout games, u work hard to earn trust and still be treated like an outsider. I side with enclave bc my hard work pays off and they treat me as their own, plus having access to their arsenal is a plus.
---
Yeah no problem dm me your GT
---
Harpoons are used to hunt gators in West Virginia. Seriously, I don't know what's with the common belief that harpoons are *only* used to hunt whales and nothing else.
---
Exactly why I stopped playing a few months back. Too much time gated grind, not enough fun to even it out.
---
And that many if not most PVPers are typically griefer kids in my experience.
---
Me either. I saw videos while ago with people that hacked the code and run local servers (something like that) to implement 5 star weapons and see how that would work.
---
Howd it work?
---
So, if you run Bandolier .44, .45, .38, and 5mm are all weightless. So I‚Äôve got 30k ammo and a weapon for each. Even if it doesn‚Äôt fit your build, an explosive .44 makes a great tagging weapon and it‚Äôs dirt cheap since nobody runs pistols.
---
You are not understanding.  You're a pistol build (and barely, from the sound of it), and you're complaining that a weapon that you're not built for isn't performing as well as you'd like.
---
You have a weapon that isn't good for your build.  No one is going to change *a shotgun* to make it good for a pistol build.  That leaves exactly 2 other options:  Don't use it, or change your build to make it better.  Since you've seemingly thrown out both of those, no one here can help you.
---
I‚Äôll be disappointed if they aren‚Äôt bad guys, or at least very dark grey ‚ÄúLaw and order is more important than freedom, so shut up and give us all your stuff‚Äù guys. 
---
My suspicion is the latter, with them being just friendly enough to send us off on deadly missions while they sit pretty at Atlas, ruling their empire of 200 million scraps of cork. 
---
They‚Äôre primed to be disliked. Crater will obviously despise them, plus they‚Äôll see them as competition if they‚Äôre running around shaking down farmers. Foundation, where people want a return to the old world and former military members now live, (depending on your WL choices) will likely see them as deserters and not want them gobbling up all the useful tech. 
---
There are so many interesting ways they could take this. If it‚Äôs just good-guy heroes with big guns crap I‚Äôll be truly disappointed.
---
I‚Äôm just the opposite, I spend so much time in my PA, the fusion cores have probably rendered me infertile
---
I always enjoy conversations where the person I am speaking with uses straw man arguments, makes my day seeing somebody have to make the conversation about something else, rather than what it is about, just so his pathetic ego can get a boost. 
---
It isn't about me not wanting to buy, it is about people dumping all their trash ammo to make it seem like they have something and wasting people's time. 
---
My issue is not with people not having the things I want to buy, it is with their deceptive behavior that only serves to waste people's time. It is with the people who put level 15 pipe pistols in their shop to make it seem like they have weapons, when they don't. The entire purpose of this practice is to possibly make caps off this trash because they don't have anything to sell, not something so noble as "helping a low level player" and the insinuation is nothing more than a ruse to cover up the true intentions of the behavior.
---
so get sat down again, be sure to come  back with something better. Don't bring anymore weak arguments around here.
---
They put cork in the walls for soundproofing, they're all either streamers, musicians, or soldiers who just need a quiet nights sleep.
---
If you‚Äôre a full health build use a mix of bolstering and vanguards. If you‚Äôre using just vanguards, you‚Äôll be tanky at full HP but as soon as you get down to 60-80 you‚Äôll start dying very quickly
---
There is Cloth. 125 Million Steel, 150 Million Concrete, 200 Million Cork, 150 Million Plastic, 150 Million Wood, 200 Million Cloth, 175 Million Leather, and 250 Million Glass. https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/19lD84ailufdG6cgVdqls2/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-fortifying-atlas-and-quakecon-details
---
This is a great idea. I really like the sniper style, but trying to break out of my habits.
---
Sent a chat, do you have time now? I'm fairly certain I have the code
---
I leave everything open except resources because I'd like them to admire my house.
---
I just need to build a barn for my cow and lock it, because milk thieves.
---
I honestly keep forgetting they're in the game.
---
I‚Äôll holler at you sometime soon. I do have a lot of high levels but they‚Äôre all melee builds, and you can‚Äôt really PvP in melee builds. I‚Äôve come across a few annoying ass griefers. Is your name on Reddit your PSN?
---
High health? Vanguard is good for that. Pay attention to the minor effects too. Weight reduction and AP refresh are what I like, and I have chameleon on chest. 
---
To me SS is about the overall damage reduction. Unyielding is for low or hybrid builds. 100 plus rolls and I only have one unyielding piece I‚Äôm saving.
---
Hit my first scrip cap and did nt remember until I went to purveyor. Got him down to like 20 scrip before realizing I was selling gear for free and somehow the scripts in the shop were still depleting. So whatever npc got not only my starred items, but also the scrip they were worth... youre welcome.
---
Meanwhile the enclave just throws a bunker at ya, for free
---
You don‚Äôt. Fallout 1st cancels you
---
I'm Level 184 and had every model of PA. I've now got the T65 completed as well. Once I got the Chinese Stealth Armor at Level 40+, I've yet to complete any event in PA. With the amor mod on the backpack, I just don't see the need for the bulky armor. Even did my 1st silo run in the stealth suit, as well as all SBQ events.
---
If you go talk to the overseer in her house in Sutton, she'll give you a questline that ends with breaking into Vault 79, which was America's gold vault.
---
Like I said earlier, bloodied does more damage than junkie's. Junkie's doesn't require as much of a perk investment as a bloodied build (especially a bloodied sneak build). With my junkie's heavy weapons I get enough damage to instantly kill scorchbeasts at optimal range, while also allowing me to have a more expanded build. All that and I can face tank anything except for bosses, but those too if I use my vampire weapons.
---
I've got a sneaky bloodied build too, lower leveled than my main so he's not fully optimized, nor is he fully geared out. On that character I've taken to using instigating weapons against trash mobs, like super mutants, over bloodied weapons. I can do 4k damage with my instigating gauss pistol, 3k with my instigating bow, 2.1k with my junkie's western revolver. I could even bump that up more when I optimize my build, but it doesn't really matter how much you do, if they're dead in one shot they're dead.
---
I don't bother with PvP, it's nothing but hackers and no skill tesla rifle users.
---
Starts on the 4th. Apparently the BoS are returning and they have a fanboi who wants us to collect 100's of millions of resources to await them when they start building their base.
---
The event will be for the entire community to collect X amount of a particular resource every 4 days or so (I think) and if we do reach the goal they'll give away some BoS related awards to everyone. The resources to be collected are pretty varied - cork, glass steel etc. etc. and we have to collect up to a couple hundred million of them.
---
Greek letter set. They are avaliable from vendors in whitesprings and some other stations. I have an extra if your on pc
---
I'm willing to bet my hunter's long coat and urban scout mask that this event will complete itself no matter how much we collect. It needs to finish so the next bit of BOS content can happen. Save your scrap, donate the bare minimum and get your rewards.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if this is a trap to catch dupers. But we all know what Bethesda does to cheaters.... nothing.
---
Haha nice but fr tho it just stole 12.99 from my wallet lol
---
Any stairs leading underground with a mat on them ? Sometimes happens if something goes under the map
---
A fun alternative for folks who get grossed out at the Radtoad and Mole Miner gibs but still want the perk!
---
https://youtu.be/iYVO5bUFww0
---
Did you use a set of the 1x2 stairs on metal posts? They are super buggy and this happens often.
---
My theory is they need it for explosive-resistant walls lol
---
At least MMOs have content
---
Yup. Random Lunchbox perk
---
Get rid of the drum mag? In my 1k+ hours as a heavy gunner I have never fired 500 rounds from a gattling gun in 1 go
---
I know its not a fix. But it's a work around
---
I had made it a foundation with stairs coming off of it, I tried deleting it and it wouldn‚Äôt work, I tried adding to it then delete it but then those couldn‚Äôt be removed. I ended off adding more stairs on the other side and put a foundation under, and it worked and deleted it
---
Hide and hide now, patch is supposedly Tuesday and your chance of getting it goes then.  Suit is not that bad of a grind if, as noted, your main or one of your Alts got a bunch of random free perk cards (happened to me on an alt).
---
I can run you through as well if you need
---
Heavy/pistols is ptetty dynamic.  You can run melee, heavy guns, and pistols pretty easily.
---
This is just a copy paste of what I said the previous person; I had made it a foundation with stairs coming off of it, I tried deleting it and it wouldn‚Äôt work, I tried adding to it then delete it but then those couldn‚Äôt be removed. I ended off adding more stairs on the other side and put a foundation under, and it worked and deleted it
---
The health/ap regen from quantum is huge, 200 if I remember correctly and there‚Äôs no delay in the animation before healing like a stimpak has while out of power armor.
---
Something like saving your NW build completely seperately from your Adventure build. I'd love to have the ability to create different perk builds (for NW and Adventure) from the main menu and save them so that I can just load as that build without having to swap things around every time I want to go from a stealthed melee run to a power armor heavy gun run.
---
They are saying that there will be new rare plans supposedly. For new plans, wouldn‚Äôt you have to introduce new equipment, there is so many Gatling plasmas or lasers,  power armors out there what can brotherhood entice me with, for players that are in the higher 100+ levels most of us know most if not all plans, give me a plan to build a vertibird, now we‚Äôre talking. (Tired of walking lol)
---
Thanks for trying to help though mate
---
I don't even know why this needs to be suggested; this should have been a thing from the beginning.
---
I've been told by CS that a fix is scheduled for next Tuesday with the patch and that at the same time "the team" will announce what kind of compensation they intend to send out...
---
Because they are too busy shopping in the Atoms Shop to do it themselves
---
Yeah, I want to know what a good argument coming from you looks like, but judging from our previous exchanges and your latest response, I think I'm gonna be disappointed again. I'm starting to think you don't have it in you?
---
I ran around awhile with the standard mag, but then just opted out for playing in third person. Being in power armor it's not terrible, I'm gonna try it for a bit
---
Mass production of t60!
---
I just checked my schedule and I will prob be on by 7 pm est but I will be on for at least a few hours. 
---
I probably have something on my weapon mule I shall have to check. I am desperately in need of a bloodied handmade and lever action, even 1 stars would be fine but am open to other trades. I'll check what I have and pm you a list.
---
You'll find plenty of people in other threads who don't use it. 
---
I have 4 characters, 2 PA users, 2 not.
---
High level players will tell you how powerful they are without it, how much weight they carry with backpacks and unyielding, but that set doesn't appear overnight.
---
PA is a simple, easy tank suit that anyone can use without heavy time, caps, or luck investments. Some people like it, some don't.
---
Personally, I'm just a fan of it, it looks cool, and the rule of cool sits as important to me here as in Warhammer 40k settings.
---
Simpette
---
Oh I gotcha. The reply didn‚Äôt load when I read the post my bad. Glad to see you could fix it though.
---
And no one needs to dupe cloth I mean I probably have 200,000,000 cloth in my scrap box
---
How does one get DR that high? Does it require an unyielding build? I have buttressed SS all around, high health, sit at around 350ish.
---
Vault dungeons that are a new kind of PVP where you can wager to complete each other's vault puzzle/dungeons. Maybe an offline build mode for these and a more extended build item list. They would load as instances and maybe you can have a few? Being able to place mobs and stuff would be fun. They wouldn't be able to let you get traditional XP or loot because people would abuse it. Having it be in VR lounger would make that make sense. PVP deathmatch like this could also be fun. I also think it should let you keep whatever workshops you had last session (unless already occupied) so that people have a chance to build on each other's stuff with more elaboration. I really thought I would see workshops that looked like a few people had owned them. Instead I usually find them totally untouched.
---
Not entirely true. Paying for the scrap box allows you to constantly save up mats therefore giving the capability to craft whatever you need whenever you need it, or bundle mats to sell. Therefore saving hrs of grinding or having to stop what you were doing to now get the mats to upgrade or repair items. Especially effective on low level toons with limited space. They can get to end game content faster than those without therefore as a bi product being pay to win. Same with eso.
---
I use a suit when I go into a blast zone, but that's pretty much it.
---
This! And it seems to happen with the last enemy you have to kill in the Defend X workshop event...
---
I have a bloodied lever action with 10%damage whilst aiming but it's only level 40 I think, but I do have a bloodied faster fire rate faster reload speed lvl 40 hunting rifle too. I just checked what 7pm EST is in GMT and I wont be able to do that man sorry, that would be 12 PM for me.
---
For this event, you‚Äôll get Brotherhood Provisions, that can have rare plans. My expectation for those is that they‚Äôll be repackaged versions of the Holiday Gifts and Mole Miner Pails. Maybe they‚Äôll include some new things, but probably nothing major. When the actual BOS content drops, then we should see some new weapons and armor.
---
It‚Äôs only pay to win in your eyes buddy. All you people can whine all you want, it‚Äôs not pay to win. You just like saying that.
---
Because there are complete idiots working in the management of Bethesda who have no idea what makes a game a good game. These are the types of people who see a thing working for Fallout Shelter and that other mobile crap they made, and assume it therefor must work for everything.
---
And strictly speaking they're not wrong, because you fuckers keep logging in every day to do this shit like the good little sheep you are.
---
*\*Liberty Prime Didn't Like That\**
---
Account details on steam - manage subscriptions
---
I've actually warmed up the Crater guys, sure they may be Raiders but they are just disorganized and weak enough that they pose no threat.
---
Foundation I like more due to their everyday people rather than their leaders, it's nice to be welcomed as a hero for all the good I've done in the community.
---
This was the tipping point for me, as far as paying for shit. I'm a cosmetics gal, I like my shit pretty. And I understand that in order for the game to continue, they need some revenue. So as far as the Atom Shop goes, yeah I'll buy the stuff that I think looks really cool. I think I've spent maybe *MAYBE* fifty bucks at the Atom Shop the whole time I've played the game, but honestly probably not even that much.
---
But then they dropped Fallout First and I was *pissed* because the game, for as much as I love it, feels VERY incomplete. Wastelanders filled a little of that in, but it still feels empty. So when they brought out this subscription, having you *pay* for the things that we as a player base have been *begging* for since launch? I came unhinged. I dropped the game for a while.
---
And then once I cooled off, it hit me. Even though Wastelanders was content we *should* have had from the get-go, it was essentially an expansion. An expansion that people behind the scenes built from the ground up. Beth *could have* charged us for that like Bungie does for the Destiny expansions. They didn't. And the BoS "expansion" (that I have only heard mentions of, so idk if it's even real) will probably also be free. These are paid for by the Atom Shop and Fo1st. And *that* realization has me considering paying for the sub, because the people working on this game still need to feed their families even if the game isn't everything we hoped it would be.
---
It's bugged.
---
Weightless weapons are like scrip vouchers. Try to avoid cashing them in if you can. Save them for a day you cant play much and use them then.
---
The event will complete itself even if none of us play, it has to in order for the future content to exist. It's just a ploy to get us to log in each day and see the atomic shop.
---
Or, we don't collect everything, BOS gets pissed that we decided to not be their slaves and they wreak havoc on all of us and are permanently hostile towards us. There'll be a chance that when you travel back to your camp, one will be waiting there for you.
---
99% of the time it will be dogtags for the first two weeks, then they'll patch it to include the occasional laser rifle and purified water
---
You guys seriously must play nothing but Fallout 76 if you think dailies and timegating are only found in mobile games.
---
Thank you good sir
---
They sure helped out in the Capital Wasteland. They also helped, depending on choices, destroy the Master in the first. They also allowed you to join and get serious equipment and upgrades in the second.  
---
You talk like a commie needing a beam split burning exploding laser blast to the face.
---
I havent seen the strangler heart stats so I wasn't positive what it rocked.  Thanks for letting me know!
---
This is a good idea. I could trade legendaries for vouchers, later to scrip.
---
I wish they would put the old Creation Club arcade machines in an Arcade shop or fun park like the fair or Camden, and make a daily associated with it that involved playing the Pip-Boy Games, with a community-wide scorebiard and the chance of getting plans for building the Arcades and various hologame themed stuff at our CAMP.
---
And the Automatron workbench, even if only to populate our CAMP with a glorified turret that can speak.
---
Better start grinding now.  Pretty sure they said they were fixing the limited time awards being available again thing in the next patch, which is coming Tuesday
---
And in the Commonwealth they said, ‚ÄúHmm, that‚Äôs a mighty nice farm you‚Äôve got there‚Äù
---
Dumb as fuck!
---
I think there was a post on here recently where a guy figured out that 1 peice of each of the major enemy types armour (troubleshooters, exterminators, ect) was better than vanguard and bolstering.
---
I got so much dang Gold Bullion from Fasnacht its unreal
---
Well, I hope they wont just teleport from the thin air as the raiders and settlers did...
---
I really hope, the game is starting to reach a stalemate for me, my heavy gunner build can take the SQB down without any assistance, not even a challenge anymore
---
More FOMO trash content for broken rewards. Just like the legendary run.
---
U could be right, by the way great username
---
Trust me I not whining I could care less. But paid storage is pay to win bud pretty much everyone In the pay to win argument agrees with that. So yea only In my eyes, or oh you mean our eyes believe that. Sure.
---
I'm sitting on 1002 at moment cant do nothing with it lol
---
Sweetie, this was already in motion before the game even came out. It‚Äôs not my fault you couldn‚Äôt bother yourself to read up on it. They had confirmed they were going to bring private servers as subscriptions and I was perfectly fine with that. Good lord, how can you say it‚Äôs pay to win when you don‚Äôt really win at anything in this game? It‚Äôs an open world game, not a CoD game. Y‚Äôall better quiet down before they make us pay to even play the game, like WoW.
---
Yeah I think that‚Äôs it. Atomic shop only and it most have been around when I was taking a break from the game üôÅ
---
My main is a merc who plays all sides. If the BoS rewards well, it won't matter their morals.
---
I have a BoS wannabe character too, but he believes in the Maxson BoS, if they're the xenophobic asshole BoS he'll be sad :-/ I know people want them to be morally grey but I want them to be heroes for once.
---
Yeahhh okay. Says the dude who can‚Äôt afford $13 a month, or at least whines about it.
---
I did full rep grind on all 3 of my characters. Nice to have 3 different play styles to choose from.
---
I don't know why you have such a problem with people selling what they want, that's it. They sell what they would like to. Just because it doesn't please almight doyouevenfreedombro doesnt mean it doesn't please others. So next time please make an argument that's worth anyone's time. Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
So it's just another reskin. Great.
---
PUSS FOR THE PUSS GOD!
---
SNOT FOR THE SNOT THRONE!
---
Pardon me while I go apply plague rider skins to all my power armors.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv2Axva86j8
---
When I saw the challenges I thought about dupers too.  Then I was like no way anyone duped cork.
---
Edit....dupers
---
If we do not reach the goal, we lose that reward that it gives. Not a big deal. Personaly I only interested in the collectron, since I collect collectrons.
---
Fast Travel
---
Buttressed Vanguard Secret Service armor and mutations like Scaly Skin and Grounded. Full Ironclad perk card too.
---
FOR THE EMPEROR!
---
That would be kind of nice for once, sure would help with their reputation, speaking of reputation I hope they aren‚Äôt gonna do the same daily crap to build reputation like raiders and settlers currently
---
Chunkification is my favorite word for today
---
As far as atoms, your right. But there's a lot more to his post besides the atomic shop. The actual game, for instance.
---
I got it now thanks!
---
The first one i ever got was a quad explosive double barrel with faster reload from gramps. Had nothing that has even came close to being that good since.
---
Thank you. I was thinking it was a mistake on my end.
---
I only use it on my heavy weapons build, as there's a perk for heavy weapons when in PA. Otherwise, no.
---
I don‚Äôt use it either. Use to use it all the time on FO4 but for some reason can‚Äôt be bothered with it in 76.  I normally use Chinese stealth suit when in rads zones.
---
Sure.  I think t 65 is best over all for protection, I haven't played around with sh, so I dont know how good the poison is.
---
How much supplies do we need to donate?
---
Ok, well let me know a time that works for you, shouldn't take long to meet up so I can likely make it work. 
---
Should be able to get you a list in an hour or two.
---
Oh perfect! Thank you so much ^-^
---
You obviously haven't played either destiny game....
---
NW is hacked to shreds, 1/3 players uses some kinds of hacks, cheats, boosts, glitches, exploits.
---
anti-armor, faster swing speed shishkebab from Daguerre like a week ago. not great as an actual weapon, but perfect to use with friendly fire so i keep it on me.
---
Well I'm online now but I'll probably get off in an 1 or 2
---
Out of curiosity, is there a guide for a heavy/pistols hybrid build? Because heavy weapins are my favorite, but i love the gauss pistol
---
Oh I do, just imagine seeing players flying around during scorched  earth lol
---
Number 4 all the way. Fishing! That was such a fun thing in RDR2 and that wasn‚Äôt even that complex of a mechanic.
---
Use excavator for Lucky Hole Mine, otherise I think the only reason to use PA is for the stablised perk for heavy gunners. More likely to use stealth armour if I need to go into a rad zone.
---
Same! Got a junkies gauss shotgun on one of my first drops (useless for my build but still nice). Since then I've been lucky to get a 1 star nocturnal pool cue
---
Yeah, they were a douche in Commonwealth. I'm not happy about that at all.
---
Lol, see. I wish I had the atoms for the blood raider skin for excavator armor. I could then role play as a chaos marine. And same with the x01 raider bundle skin you could rp as an orc
---
Yeah, I quit playing for two reasons - one; the reasons stated in this post and second after the latest big patch my gpu goes to 100% and the game stutters whenever I go to a large player CAMP and even sometimes the whitesprings resort. This gpu/stutter issue never happened before patch and nothing seems to fix it and it's not my gpu, only happens with 76. Kinda got me bummed and I just cancelled my FO1st sub and never came back, been about a month now.
---
As I said before, WASTING PEOPLE'S TIME, DECEPTIVE, DONE ONLY TO TAKE A CHANCE ON MAKING CAPS FROM TRASH AND ATTRACT PEOPLE TO THE CAMP WHO THINK THEY ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING TO BUY. It isn't about catering to me, as I am not calling out the people selling Furious 3* weapons, but those that sell low level, ordinary pipe pistols and leather armor, as if a low level wouldn't craft those instead of buying (you know, due to being low level and not having enough caps?)
---
Idk why you still keep refusing to deal with this point, I've literally explained to you why it is have a problem with people selling trash and you keep coming back with the same response, "WhY yOu HaVe A pRoBlEm WiTh WhAt PeOpLe SeLl?" Perhaps it is because you lack reading comprehension skills? Perhaps it is because avoiding actual conversation prevents you from having to learn something about yourself and grow as a person? You tell me, why do you keep avoiding the point?
---
Get sat down again scrub, in case you didn't hear me, COME BACK WITH A GOOD RESPONSE, not more trash.
---
Okay, so recolours are a nono. How about some fallout 4 content?
---
What?? Is that something new? Haven't played in a while.
---
I enjoy a leisurely stroll...
---
In any of the games, they will make their choices based on their own self interests. They don‚Äôt really do things for the betterment of all people, just themselves. In some cases their interests are shared by the locals. They have the resources to do a lot to help people, but mostly they just defend themselves and take anything they think others shouldn‚Äôt have
---
That's exactly what I was thinking
---
So do other quests auto complete as well if you are on public teams? This happened to me on I am become death, and was disappointing to say the least. It‚Äôs ridiculous that it happens on an end-game quest, but if can happen with any quest, that‚Äôs just absurd.
---
So are you arguing that we should get even more recolors? And ask them to charge us more?
---
Simply saying it could be worse is only statating the blindingly obvious. Hell wot at one point now old did they sell custom paints. Those custom paints requires you to buy additional thanks, meaning you had to buy a slot for it, then level up a separate crew if you wanted to take advantage of the ability to quick flip the tank between pvp matches. Then they decided oh we have to make tiny tweaks to each one because Sherman and we need to get people into the got to catch them all coletable frame of mind.
---
It would be nice, but I think it would hurt player vendors a bit, no longer will I need to scour the wastes in search of elusive god tier fixers or to find the perfect piece of armour.
---
I've always built all my resources left open for people passing by to help themselves to. Usually by the time I swing by things will have restocked anyway so not a big deal. 
---
However I'm starting to lock some things now after I discovered a player last week who was just farming camps. I popped in to my camp a few times and saw the same player nearby after clearing out everything...didn't think much of it until I watched him on the map jumping from camp to camp all over the map in a big circuit. Apparently he spent the game just cleaning out resources from everyone's camps then selling it. 
---
I don't mind people taking some resources...it's there, it'll come back...but I draw the line at players farming my camp instead of just building their own somewhere.
---
My thoughts exactly! There are way too many limits &amp; far too much time gating. You need to keep a damn log book.
---
Lemme see...what time did I hit the robot vendors yesterday...got to wait 20 hours.
---
What time did I unload my script weapons...got to wait 20 hours.
---
Opps hit my 1400 caps for the day...got to wait 20 hours
---
Damn - Hit my measly 150 script limit for the day too...
---
30k max on caps, so got to watch trying to sell any high value items I may have, 1k max on script, so don't bother doing any more events or farming any more legendries unless you just want to drop them on the ground. Rolled a dozen Gauss Miniguns...crap can't script those either...more wasted effort.
---
Can only pull 200 bullion a day 8pm reset, 5k limit on your total so stuff like the SS PA or SS Armor &amp; mods takes WEEKS to get, since they all run over 5k bullion to get, but you can farm as many notes as you want.
---
The ally quests I haven't figured out the time gate on these yet - looks like 20 hours on them too.
---
Oh...the "daily quests for notes...foundation, crater, overseer's house" guess what, got to wait for 8pm EST for the reset each day.
---
Weekly gold bullion limited to 300 per week, guess what - it resets after 8pm every Saturday (for me anyway)
---
800 stash limit (not including the 1st box here)
---
Camp budget too small so I can't use all the cool things I acquired in game or from the atom shop...buying them is pointless.
---
Forgotten Knowledge - you have to collect 1 new tech doc each run, doesn't matter that you have dozens in your inventory.
---
Radsheild - that's a good one being able to craft this depends on you getting on a server where someone has the quest &amp; hasn't completed it so that the strangler blooms show up, otherwise your SOL.
---
Food spoilage is way too fast; consumption is out the window if you run Speed Demon since the December patch, I have to eat &amp; drink it seems every 10 minutes. The fix...they are going to remove the debuffs rather that do the sensible thing &amp; adjust the rates of consumption/spoilage to something more reasonable. 
---
Just WTF are they thinking? Did they forget that the game is supposed to be somewhat fun &amp; not a senseless grind where you are overly limited to everything you do?
---
Who gives a shit if I want to farm &amp; hoard 100k caps? If I want to farm legendries for hours on end with their shitty drop rates, then LET ME SCRIPT THE JUNK &amp; try for something better!
---
I've gotten to where I get on the game, do the challenges (if they haven't auto completed) make my caps, hit my script, grab my gold &amp; log off. There is no further point in playing at that point.
---
The Legendary Run is a farce, they screwed us out of a ton of free atoms to try &amp; force players to buy them to complete the season.  And even the rewards in some of those tiers is broke.
---
People are forced into playing NW or take a huge hit on score. 1 NW challenge a day skipped is a total of 25K score at the end of the run. The offset...get 100 score for every 10k exp...I bet the lower level players are loving that one...
---
They have to give the game away at this point to try &amp; get people to play (&amp; buy atoms). I don't see this game being around in another year. It will get shut down. 
---
If they bothered to fix some of the long-standing bugs that have been here forever, &amp; allowed the players to just play the game without being hamstrung at every turn they would be a lot more successful. &amp; maybe, just maybe, the game would be around for a while...

I'm not sure how to request a refund ticket? Would you mind explaining it for me?

Wanna carry a grenade launcher and 1000 grenades to tag all enemies? Now you can.

I have a set of exc and xo1 but never use em. It's just one more resource to maintain.
---
This is how i run most one peice of each specific type and then i try for weight reduction for what i carry most so i can use my perk cards for better things. Im very tanky.
---
yeah - everytime i get a cool tesla rifle I lose interest in it so quickly because I cannot use it. currently i have a pretty good vampire-tesla-shotgun, but after a few shots i have to change the server because no more weapons cause distance damage
---
Hate to bruise your sensitive ego, toughguy, but you didn't hurt me feelings. I guess you're exactly what capitalists are counting on. Fallout is a single player RPG, they changed what the game is, so they can make money off of folks like you who buy in to the bullshit. A complete game, you know like the last three titles they released in the series, none of those needed a continuous cash infusion in order to keep them from ceasing to exist. They changed the model of the game so that they could continue making money off of the same mediocre product. They don't need a good story, or characters, or any of the elements of what fallout has always been, because fools like you will keep forking over cash. 
---
You need to continue spending money to even play the game in the first place. They don't charge 12.99 a month to keep up maintenance costs. They do it because they think they will make more money selling subscriptions than they do games. This is why they develop medicines to treat diseases instead of curing diseases. It's bullshit and if you don't get that, you're part of the problem. You're the fool they're counting on.
---
We'll see, but my money is on dailies again :-/
---
Dude the real money market is super interesting! This is the first game I've ever played with one. I started an account for a price checking reference. Its usefulness has really dropped off though because I used to compare caps:dollars and then dollars:particularly weapons. After the holiday gift dupe cap prices have been forever in the toilet and it doesnt really represent the game economy anymore. 
---
Before the gift dupe, caps were selling around 5-6 usd for 30k. So a gun that was selling for 10 bucks was worth around 60-75k. Fun fact: a couple months ago, I saw a b2525 fixer sell for the equivalent of 2 million caps!
---
I played to level 230 something on my commando character, never really liked PA; when I got a god rolled 50 cal I decided to make a new character for heavy guns and now I really like power armor.  With lots of points in intelligence the fusion cores are a non issue because they last forever and weigh nothing.  To me the biggest advantage to power armor is having access to great armor with almost zero grinding.  
---
It took me months to complete my set of vanguard sentinel heavy combat armor and nearly 200 legendary modules to make a set of sentinels secret service armor on my main character.  With my heavy gunner I just did the enclave quest line (easy to obtain all mods desired for XO) and then the BOS quest line and payed someone to put cal shocks on my ultracite armor; it took about two hours instead of 6ish months.  Now I can start grinding for t65 üòë.  I do not relish the bullion grind for a second time but hey I love this game.
---
Yeah, but he does get quite a bit of ammo. (For me, in my opinion, as a level 31 noob.
---
Still whining lol. Trying to justify anything in your eyes.
---
Always seems to get me a decent amount of ammo and weapons to scrap for steel. It's the best collectron I've used personally.
---
[https://www.rhnuttall.co.uk/blog/uses-of-cork/](https://www.rhnuttall.co.uk/blog/uses-of-cork/)
---
Sure, dude.
---
Dude, there are atom shop items and items on the Legendary run that are broken as a basic fact. Have you *seen* the Blood Eagle suppressor? And the less said about the shitty Ghille suits blocking your first person view the better.
---
[Man all that money really is getting put to use! They totally at least do basic checks before pushing this!](https://imgur.com/gallery/8yyjBek)
---
You have to have FO1st
---
Apparently no one on this sub has played an mmo before, let alone with community events. Stop comparing it to single player Fallout. Also people compare what ESOnhas to what fallout doesn‚Äôt have. I beta tested ESO and still have a subscription. It was not always as good as it is now. MMOs take years before they are polished, and when they are almost perfect... the next thing comes out.
---
You forgot the cargo socks

---
Well... You know... As it happened with Raiders and Settlers, they took so long to arrive, than when they did, I was already strong and geared enough to kill all of them.
---
So... Everyone claims to be ready and tough, but I feel sorry for Meg, Paige and the rest.
---
Because then they would not be giving out Random plans and other junk.
---
How are his lines tho is he a funny raider bot fallout 1st subscription sneaked into my wallet so I might as well get him lol
---
Who told you it was worth something
---
Same level as you right now and always out of ammo ima get it thanks
---
Not a bad idea though, specialized/utility power armor for hauling weight. They could even be lazy/funny about it and weld the stash box onto some junk PA and I‚Äôd still love it. 
---
I was always hoping the excavator would have some ground leveling or building/gathering utility in a similar way.
---
It only takes about 5 seconds to open the build menu and turn that door into a wall.  That makes it pretty safe.
---
I'll give them one shit.
---
Had a couple of decent one from raider punk, but it's all random really.
---
I put in a lot of hours this week. Between probably 30 legendaries I bet 2 were 3 stars and all were garbage. I'd rather craft a fixer and know it's going to be 3 stars. Or a handmade and know it's going to be two stars. Have some hope that theirs a slight chance the item will be useful to me. I'm enjoying the grind to craft an unyielding SS set, I do wish it were tradable but it's not a huge deal.
---
Some folks mentioned tradability, I dont care either way. I'd prefer tradable.
---
 If the drop rates arent going to be changed we need a better way to get weapons that are useful for our builds. I'm just a little frustrated with the game right now.
---
I did, awaiting their probably not helpful help.
---
This is a fantastic idea. Save loads on stash space. This needs to be implemented.
---
I can't stand PA. Never have liked it.
---
Don't wear it, don't use it.
---
However, I do have an excavator set because I had to do it for a mission, and so I keep it in my stash.
---
Vanguards is ok, but with the high intrensic DR of SS armor it has very diminishing returns.  I prefer a mix of enemy specific Damage Reduction armor instead.
---
He actually cracks me up. Talks about burning my camp down, and tells me to get out of his way, and sounds like a chem addict 24/7.
---
I don't have anything like that, and no exploits either... Ugh. I'm very frustrated right now.
---
I don't believe so. A lot of quests tend to require being in the same location and having the same quest active in regards to teams, and working toward the same goal, just like a private team of friends used to be. 
---
They altered a lot of that dynamic with wastelanders with the absolutely mental "enter solo or help team leader shit" which for me personally ruined a lot of it first time around, as I started fresh again after the release and did it alongside a partially sighted friend. I basically had to do every interior twice. 
---
Death from above is an event not a quest per se, so it's designed to be taken on as a group and as a serverwide thing for the Queen, so it operates on a different parameter. I haven't tested, but I suppose Encryptid would maybe be the same. 
---
I'd like to think it was an oversight, but I dunno, maybe it was intentional.
---
The people who put it in the vendor for thousands. They're delirious.
---
I keep a decent selection of heavy weapons on me, I have a skin for my Minigun and a skin for my Napalmer. I know there was a gold skin for either the LMG or .50 cal in a bundle but missed it. Heavy weapons are missing out on skins hardcore.
---
Did someone drop you on your head as a child? It's not about the money. $13 won't affect if I make my mortgage payment next month. It's that they have manipulated the game and made it worse and incomplete so that they can generate more revenue from us. They put out a shitty product, and then tell us they have the solution, here's the fix, just gonna cost you a few more bucks. Have you never seen a scam before? I know a west African prince with a financial opportunity that would LOVE to meet you.
---
Yeah, it's from the Raider Waster bundle that was floating about a couple of months back. It'll probably make a re-appearance again soon. If you don't play regularly, just make a point of checking the Atomic Shop every week. It updates on a Tuesday (about 5pm UK time). Even if I'm not playing actively, I keep an eye on the store in case there's something awesome that I want (or there's a freebie that's particularly cool).
---
I always got mine there. But last night at fort defiance I tried twice and got one. But I never sell that shit.
---
Got a J50 Fixer just yesterday.
---
Weightless or Chameleon. Chameleon might be better though because it stacks.
---
Todd only knows.
---
üñïüèª
---
Best one for ammo. The communist one was best for blood packs so you can craft a bunch of stims
---
Those are just clueless people or but I‚Äôll understand if you just have one for 30k as a joke but to have an actual price on it is just people who don‚Äôt know much on prices
---
Yep, yesterday I went to Hemlock holes and I was 15 seconds in from claiming the workshop when I realized I was taking it from someone. I jumped out of the claiming boundary and looked at the map and it still said unowned. I let the claiming bar go back down, then looked at the map and it said it was owned. So dumb.
---
U know I chose to keep all the gold for myself, and both factions got all butt hurt, however if they were such tough guys u would think they would contest who gets the gold. Instead they ran back to their crappy bases. Tired of being an errand boy for them, trying to save up and buy all their plans then they can fix their own vacuum tubes and find their own stolen equipment
---
Beth will make it happen more than likely.
---
I make up my own challenges to go along with what I need to do. For the 10 min chal I built some of the atomshop trees and hid until the second to final circle.
---
You don't win anything in any pay to win game. That's the point. And they DO make us pay to play the game. Try doing anything without a PSN subscription.
---
Was at my first one in a public world that didn't fail yesterday. People actually collected the ore while others defended. It was about 10 players, mostly high level. Otherwise I've only completed solo with level 1 rewards.
---
Nahh
---
Good lord you are the dumbest person I've encountered on reddit.
---
Best thing I‚Äôve gotten from any of them was just the other night I got a bloodied 3 star cyro. I hate when they give me the rescue missions. Get nothing from doing them
---
Lol, this scam would only work on dumb ppl though.
---
You've reminded me of when I stumbled on a camp in a swampy bit of the map. There was a vending machine there so I went to use it.
---
It was upstairs, on another floor, behind a locked door.
---
I had a brief go at seeing if I could cheese my way in there (climbing, jumping, etc) but that was interrupted by a Mirelurk Queen invading the camp.
---
If I could have gotten inside and onto the upper floor then I would have defended the camp from a nice vantage point. Instead I had to run around taking cover behind whatever I could as I shot at it, with the cover being quickly destroyed.
---
By the time the camp owner got there most of their base had been ruined by the Queen, with a bunch of walls and whatnot gone.
---
I had no sympathy. I would have helped but my hands were tied, and told them as such over mic. I wished them luck and left them to their repairs.
---
You can‚Äôt get fixers from them. Only from purveyor
---
People who just Hoover up everything then mass convert all that crap in there fallout first tents, and that builds up in there inventories. Seriousy given out penchant for doing exactly that it‚Äôs a surprise that there‚Äôs any trash anywhere. Heck I‚Äôm surprised someone has sent higgured out how to scrap the Rockhound yet
---
I have tried all builds, and the only character that seems to cause real damage is my unarmed ninja, punching the queen for 1500-3000. 
---
My bloodied commando feels like he is not doing well, even when I hit everything else for 500-1000.
---
Cool. You feel better? I‚Äôve heard that several times, and it doesn‚Äôt really mean anything. It just proves you can‚Äôt really come up with anything else instead of calling me dumb. Keep trying bud.
---
My alt was designed for NW, just leveled to 50 for the right special stats.
---
WoW pun detected. ;)

did they offer to trim your armor too?
---
That event has been bugged for a long time

You know why you've heard that several times?

You'd have to be a super mutant to fall for this.

Amen. Not to mention testing their content before releasing it.
---
I love fallout, i love the community, and the wastelanders update was great..
---
But it needa more. A complete overhaul on everything. I am even starting to get tired of my daily challenge grind. Still broken after 2 years and extremely money grabbing is sad to see. I wish i would get hired as a manager so i could kick some asses into gear and change the direction.
---
This has to be the most dumb trick I've ever heard. If you believed this, the loss is on you. Play straight, play with friends. Don't trust everyone, especially with your inventory.
---
Affording it has no bearing on whether it's pay to win or not. I love the game, have the scrap box. All is good in my world. But it does give you an advantage over those who don't have it. It's a simple fact. Not an argument or complaint or "whining". Pay to win isn't just being able to buy the strongest items. It's a quicker and less cumbersome path to that end game that also constitutes as pay win. Paid inventory space is one of the key components of the pay to win argument. A quicker path to those better items thru the reduction of time spent with inventory management. If there were two of you, one with a scrap box and one without, you both played the same content and same hrs. Who would be stronger or higher level, better items, better mods on their guns etc. If you think it doesn't matter then ur just paying for a private world and monthly atoms? Why lol
---
Because people can‚Äôt have a logical debate other than insulting lmao. 
---
 By the way, look at yourself. Trying to get the last word in on a random redditor. What are you so mad about? Why are you still here? Fucking jeesh, whiny ass babies.
---
Think I sold a couple for 250, I don't feel particularly guilty. I save them the trip costs, the fighting, the super Mario jumping mini game, and it looks quite yummy too... üòä
---
Wow, your logic is completely utter bullshit lmao. Nice try, not gonna discuss this with you anymore.
---
Sounds like a huge buggy mess
---
S.P.E.C.I.A.L. kind of stupid.
---
Hahahaha take my upvote
---
You most certainly can.
---
Ally dailies pull out of the purveyors loot pool.
---
Edit: Notice other people in the thread talking about Gauss weapons as rewards?
---
Same here. I never lock anything. If I'm not at my camp then I'm not using anything there, so people can use whatever they need as far as I'm concerned.
---
Having a sanctuary available like that could make all the difference to a starving or injured player.
---
I have a farm, water, and materials available for anyone that needs it.
---

---
I hid my way to a win yesterday, not really sure how to be honest. Just hide and grind out the xp, I‚Äôve been doing it to get the gillie suit myself and I‚Äôm a few more matches away.
---
You need to make an extra character for it.
---
Oh man, imagine how bad the servers would crash lol
---
Lmao honestly if they get somone with this they deserve their junk
---
Runescape scam meets Fallout 76 I see
---
I agree with you here. Love that ping. And the 5.56 brings up a lot of nostalgia.
---
Love how all the toys are made of lead.
---
ouch
---
I really wish it was like eso in that only limits are way waaaaay off and that you can spend and then continue earning more the same day imo. These limits are killing this games enjoyment.
---
I have done this event about 50 times.    About 20 of those times the robot got stuck.  After a while you just learn to expect it and you move on.
---
Then I stand corrected if this is true. Just didn‚Äôt think there was anywhere you could get a legendary fixer other then purveyor which I‚Äôve gotten 3 from which two are crap and my holy grail was my bloodied 3 star fixer 250 damage resistance while reloading and 50% more critical damage. But didn‚Äôt know anywhere else other then players that wanna sell for 100 dollars real money. Lol sorry
---
No kidding lol
---
Hahaha
---
Your ability to continue making my point for me is remarkable
---
So many explosions lol
---
If you contact bethesda they supposedly give u the atoms for it. (From what i have heard) i have so many bugged challenges tho it would just be easier for them to fix them. üòÇ
---
Fingers crossed brotherhood will sell a plan in their new base!
---
similar thing happened to me. some guy was all 'bro your junk is haunted. there's ghosts in your flux!' and i was like 'jinkies' and he was all 'if you give your junk to me i can perform an exorcism' so i gave him my junk and he ran off.
---
Thx!
---
MILK FOR THE KHORNE FLAKES
---
I've gotten a fixer at least twice from astronaut lady.
---
Word I‚Äôll add you! Thanks!
---
Yet you‚Äôre still here, trying to get the last word in. Says a lot about you.
---
Then I stand corrected I apologize.
---
Unless you can come on before an hour and a half I wont be able to
---
While this is a quick fix, I have had to do this a couple of times even, it shouldn't be the responsibility of the player to find work arounds for something that doesn't work how it should in game.
---
Imo the system should be that if the aggressor is killed the game awards the defender for successfully fighting off an attack and leave it at that, and if the defender is killed, *they* should then get the option to get revenge on the attacker.
---
Yeah I get that the first place I tried taking had a guy in stealth hiding after killing all the enemies thus putting it into contention/stopping my claim but the next three were legitimately owned and the workstation said unclaimed.
---
Apparently half of players really just want to plug in permanently to the Matrix.
---
I‚Äôm fine with the pace because I‚Äôm working full time and have other stuff going on.
---
Also on the Red Dead sub people are always complaining about the exact same things, there‚Äôs just even more irate chronically dissatisfied people. 
---
Whether it‚Äôs Fallout, COD, GTA, RDR, etc. the reddit communities just can‚Äôt stop crying. Nothing wrong with criticism, but reddit melodrama is a different level.
---
Last year I played that event a lot of times, and it NEVER bugged back then. Never stuck, never standing still, never burning for 5 minutes causing him to die a few times over and over again. The event itself feels like a chore, but it was somewhat enjoyable. In the last few months it is always bugged. 
---
It just shows that when they add new stuff they dont check the old events for bugs.
---
anyone who would fall for this deserves it in order to teach them an important lesson...
---
Perfect to voice our opinions for people that hog all the kills during events
---
Would having an AI companion really change much though? They aren‚Äôt acting in the same way a player would and taking up much else than that of one of the scorched enemies
---
Nuka world!!  I'd love this.
---
Nah, they just want to make a giant wine bottle
---
 They need glass too, if I remember...
---
I almost got killed for it
---
I agree. Sometimes the angry emote just doesn‚Äôt convey how pissed we are.
---
I have used fragmentation grenades to knock bodies down from heights.
---
Which one though?  Which one??
---
That‚Äôs 2 centuries later. You do realize 76 is only a few decades after the war, right? Also that the Brotherhood in the Commonwealth  is not the entire Brotherhood?
---
I still hold out hope that they will implement an Ore Spotting helmet mod or something for the Excavator armor.
---
Madlad.
---
I think I've done Cop a Squatter legitimately one time the entire time I've played. The rest of the time it has auto completed for me. It's almost a guarantee I'll complete Cop a Squatter at least once a play session without ever having to go there.
---
They don't have the resources to help people endlessly.  A life raft only contains so many provisions and can only hold so many people.  If you expect them to help people to the point they can no longer support themselves, then you can expect them to die out. It's a foolish endeavor to destroy your own group while helping others without regard to your own needs.  
---
Also, they live in a world that is literally irradiated and a wasteland because people didn't use technology properly and destroyed the planet.  I don't blame them for restricting truly powerful and dangerous technology from savages in the wasteland.
---
So why do people want cork so much?
---
Almost everyone uses heavy/power armor and heavy weapons. Just from observation.
---
Someone unban this man!
---
If you have a single thing locked at your camp, you are garbage

And it is best for food and water too. It also gives a heal lot of stims to dilute and sell.

---
I used to consistently get decent stuff from Gramps.
---
Unfortunately, he's been bugged for weeks.
---
No, I meant like Grognak, Silver Shroud etc outfits in Atomic shop! Or about 90 percent of CAMP objects in the shop!
---
Why
---
Scrap bot still nets you more useful things imo.  You‚Äôre breaking down junk for steel, lead, acid , fiber optics, ballistic fiber ect.  Ammo is plentiful unless the collection only collects 5.56 for you
---
In a week we would be left with absolutely nothing to wish for eh... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That‚Äôs a cracking idea!
---
Awesome! Are we in the collecting every 4 days part? If so what day should I hop on?
---
I tried power armour during SBQ event and it offered no radiation protection at all any of the times I used it so I guess it‚Äôs partially bugged
---
you are probably right, if it was Paladin Danse you know it would be the hard stuff!
---
Oh yea so nobody can get the special brotherhood presents
---
Now that I‚Äôve thought about this, it‚Äôs a missed meme/opportunity for Bethesda.
---
Picture the ‚ÄúDeath Standing‚Äù PA set that‚Äôs just the frame with 5-6 stash boxes balanced on top, with drunk-wobbly motion...

Have you ever played WoW? It's only $15 a month and there are GMs within the game to fix problems or issues players come across immediately. You get hacked in WoW and all you have to do is put in a ticket, then usually within that day your account, characters and stuff is restored. If you have Fallout 1st then you are already paying a monthly fee. There are so many exploits in Fallout so it's not unheard-of players having legendaries taken from their stash. When that happens in Fallout there is absolutely nothing Bethesda can do for you. With WoW you get what you pay for, it's a great game that runs smoothly. The only thing that affects that is what you're running it with. It would be laughable for Bethesda to move their player base to a required monthly subscription.
---
But did he get rid of the ghosts or are they haunting him now?
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
This is honestly worse than all of the Steam scams. You fall for something like that, then you deserve it as a lesson.
---
No. RNG is a bitch but its fair. Besides, the game is easy enough the way it is rn.
---
Also, consider using commas and periods in future posts.
---
Heaven for bid they have a challenge where the purpose is actually playing the game.
---
I started to craft 100 gauss minigun, to get atleast a 2* junkies faster fire rate one (my ideal would be a junkies faster fire rate, faster reload). Now I am at 30, and I did not crafted a single junkies, nor a bloodied.
---
I can not decide, what should I do: cry or laugh...
---
I don't think that would make much sense. The BoS doesn't even know the Enclave exists yet and the Enclave don't consider The BoS a threat. If the Enclave come back it would make more sense for them to fight the Chinese Remnant or a revived Free States movement.
---
Thanks kind stranger!
---
Same, plus the grind and limits on stash has killed my enthusiasm for 76. Maybe I‚Äôll get another month of 1st but that still doesn‚Äôt solve the other shitty parts
---
I'd laugh
---
Some dudes have acorn dicks and want to punish the world for it.
---
I know right? It would probably take 4 minutes solid to burn through it. It sucks having to use workarounds, but this one should be barely noticable.
---
Definitely better than my fasnacht collectron lol
---
I imagine you found no way to change it in the key bindings options?
---
I hope you can, I‚Äôm already dreading having to give up my junk stash. I need my 84k steel! It‚Äôs miiiiiiiiiine!
---
Play solo, turn off auto-fill party.  
---
Start near the map edge.  
---
Find cover.  
---
Only move when you have to.  
---
Stay hidden.  
---
Pick all the survival perks that you can (+hp, RAD resist, DR, whatever fits). I've seen a couple hide in water with Aquaboy/girl, so try that. Frog Legs is handy for moving around and help avoid people.

You do realize just how much plastic like Bakelite, ABS(legoes from 1949) and even Vinyl seriously (PVC , 1920s and flexible variants were already replacing rubber as an insulator at GE by the 1930s ) existed even in our 1950s? And how much of it was being produced and used because it is actually a great electrical insulator?
---
Nope. No way there, which doesn't make sense.
---
I can change the jump key, in which case jumping and crit will be the new key. But what I want is not jumping trying to crit, so just have another key for that
---
I agree I hated it. Just walking in a slow circle every hour and the fact everyone was always doing it, there was never any help on other stuff
---
I'll when I am done with 100, without my gun... and I know my luck, I never will have it :)
---
Well, I have to use my legacy then, I want to retire it, as the game is too easy with it, but I do not want to use a onestar noctural shit :)
---
&gt; Every single day the limits on caps, scrip, gold bullion and reputation are a major cockblock in my enjoyment of Fallout 76. 
---
Makes me enjoy it more because it gives me a cut of point were I can get off for the day and play something else.
---
I think I would like if all weapons were done like those, you can choose the weapon, but not the effects.  Still some rng, but not too nuch.
---
I‚Äôd go for Prime because ultracite 5mm is easy to make in large quantity.  If you want a higher rate of fire you can always go into 3rd person and click as fast as you can.
---
Doesn't suprise me, tbh.
---
Have you not played an MMO before?
---
They backed off of the ban wave, and now this. Fuck, I can't beleive you've done this..
---
There‚Äôs no point in getting rewards from legendary enemies or buying stuff off from other people if we get to chose what legendary weapons we want. Crafting a 3 star bloodied explosive 90 reduced weight Gatling laser is something I wanted for so long. So being able to craft that for 2 legendary modules would be way too easy. Every single player would have OP weapons that way. I would never ever bother looking at another player‚Äôs shop for weapons if I could just build the legendary weapon effects I wanted.  Besides. The games doesn‚Äôt know what you consider good or bad when it comes to weapon/armor legendary effects. 
---
I like your idea as in you can chose ONE legendary effect. So you decided okay I want a bloodied legendary. And then the game will decide if you get a one or three star. 
---
But still, to be fair, I‚Äôd expect it to cost 10-15 legendary modules just to be able to pick our first legendary effect.
---
Yeah I did specify the best I've used. Never used that one, will check it out when it comes up.
---
Sh*t like this:["5 star" items üôÑ](https://youtu.be/w2GPPvyH1Vk)
---
I've got 2 in my vendor for 30k. Only so nobody can do the vendor bug glitch and clean me out.
---
It just contradicts a lot of shit, I mean they literally sent Lyons and a few other groups across the country to see what the fuck was out there, yet mentioned nothing of the homies they‚Äôve been Skyping on the east coast for 200 years.
---
The thing that gets me the most is the daily gold bullion limit (200) when you already have the treasury notes, also why is it capped at only 5000 why is there so many limits on the various currencies its dumb, I like to horde stuff in games, so very quickly I was forced to buy fallout first for the scrap storage and I hate that I had to pay for it, they need to sort this out.
---
If you even play the game then the answer to this question is pretty obvious. Plenty of people don't use it.
---
From what I've experienced it says it will charge you but in reality it does not.
---
No need to be a dick. Thanks for your sassy comment tho
---
No you cant
---
Biv
---
Was there any delay in movement when she followed you or did she follow you responsively?
---
The Collossus is a random encounter you can find in nuke zones. It happened a couple of updates ago.
---
I agree it would be nice, I‚Äôve been on the hunt good 3 star fixers for awhile, it would be easier to just build my own and know exactly what I‚Äôll be getting. But man the thrill of finally getting what I‚Äôve been chasing for is pretty sweet. Maybe for me it‚Äôs more the thrill of the hunt, I‚Äôm not in to big of a hurry to have nothing to look forward to.
---
As a reference point, I started playing two months ago and have never had a successful aide drop.  Same issue as you.  I just stopped doing them.
---
It is - the WC can spawn in at least 4 different locations when they‚Äôre nuked....I have a mate with several display cases full of these things.....not pleasant considering what it looks like
---
About that: they won‚Äôt get plans to build Vertibirds for another 138 years, so don‚Äôt count on it.
---
The platform at the observatory? Most likely for vertibots or some other unmanned drone like vehicle.
---
The wendigo has certain spawn points in certain areas if you drop a nuke on it. Very low spawn rate, but I have about 5 vocal sacs
---
I‚Äôm glad I found this post. Since I have a couple of questions from an experience I had yesterday. Some dude fast traveled to my camp and bought a tse rw black powder pistol from my vendor for 6k. Right after he bought it, he started hitting me for no reason. All I was doing was switching some of my perks around while he was looking through my vendor. I don‚Äôt know why I ‚Äòhit back‚Äô, but he killed me in one hit with a power fist. After that , he started destroying my vending machines, which I thought wasn‚Äôt possible after the last update? Long story short, I came back multiple times to see if I could damage this guy, and each time, he destroyed me. The last time he killed me? It was with a boxing glove lol. My point is, during these attacks, I even switched perks around, like full blocker, dodgy, lone wanderer, I even chugged nuka quantum..... and even with a full set of mutants powered sentinel armor (with one autostim powered sentinel piece), he pretty much one shot me.... so my question is.... how is that possible? I even had my b2525 handmade equipped, but no luck. All those perks, my armor, and nuka quantum... yet I got destroyed... I don‚Äôt do much pvp at all... am I missing something?
---
PVP itself became permanently broken with massive duping IMO.  I  really do think that PVP should have its own mode, but not like it was with survival.  It should have its own map, like a whole different region.  Like t[he Dark Zone in Division](https://thedivision.fandom.com/wiki/N.Y.C._Dark_Zone).
---
They're all legendary weapons (as long as you get the weapon quest)
---
I agree, but the BOS would also be considered defectors and traitors.
---
Eh, i just make a new character, run out of the vault, kill the blood eagles by the wayward then do the wayward quest
---
Huh? Explain please.
---
I‚Äôve sold several for 5k. Don‚Äôt tell me how to price.
---
How about the forearm jerk?
---
30K caps for 100 atoms. I can see it now.
---
High chance that wont happen. They made Atoms specifically more sparse during the season so they could up sales
---
Ah gotcha.  Thanks for the reply :)
---
Well there you go. 62,500,000 bottles of wine caped but golf ball corkes! Proof that there Millitary if ever I saw it. The just forgot to requisition more gold clubs and Tees! Oh wait, wood steel leather..... golf clubs and bags..... yep checks out....even the cloth will be useful as golf outfits. I guess yeh concrete is because they confused Bunkers with bunkers.....
---
Maybe put a few points in Intelligence if you fell for that. Also they kind of deserved it if they had no problem with using a dupe.
---
Instead of doing it for the travel cost of west tek, remove it from itüòê
---
That's a little high.   I think 3000 for 10 is more reasonable.
---
.....
---
:-)
---
Same. My initial assumptions about what play style I'd find most enjoyable were only partly accurate. It's surprisingly satisfying to get up in the face of a Behemoth and bury a meat hook in his guts over and over and watch it get coated with blood.   
---
It's fun to be able to choose between different play styles depending on mood or  situation. I'll keep dreaming that one day Bethesda could add a shared stash.
---
I love the Bow,
---
I have 60% increased damage with arrows, 36% ignore armor , ranged sneak attack x2.5  and 75% harder to detect while sneaking. I feel like I'm a master assassin lol and I love it.
---
And my arrows have the explosive tips and  my explosives do +20% damage.
---
no kidding ü§£
---
The BOS usage in 76 at launch was fine, given we basically had nothing on the BOS for a long stretch of time. Their return seems like it might end up being fine as well, considering as early as Fallout 1 they were literally losing history, with scribes not all knowing who Maxson was, dumping historical documents for weapon schematics.
---
Basically, if the server is lagging. And someone has a base thats at full budget, when someone fast travels to there base and it hasn't loaded all the assets correctly. People can jump into your vendor. Buy out everything, and have access to your stash.
---
This is often what determines if I even try it  Is it in Ash Heap? Skip it.
---
The challenge system being tied to their battle pass system killed it for me and I'll probably never play again even being a first member. I don't play games to be told what to do. I play them to do whatever I want. Putting me in a box and do these specific bullshit things for cosmetics isn't my jam. I'd rather just pay for the cosmetics. I don't have the time to play for 2 hours a day every day.
---
Try Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, or Fallout 4 with a companion vs without a companion.  They are used as a meat shield, can deal with one or more enemies, and they can be used as an additional backpack.  Some games have very lousy companion AI while others make it a necessity without a team.
---
Besides Fallout 76 is not a Fallout game without companions and more importantly Dogmeat.
---
Yea, sucks though since I‚Äôve basically completed all the challenges that award Atoms.
---
...like all scams right?
---
Uninstalled decades ago lol but this post is gold.
---
well yes I know about the bonuses and perks, I was running a bow build myself, I just ended up not being able to do any real damage to bosses so that's why I was asking. I'm guessing you haven't fought the SBQ yet ?
---
Personally I‚Äôm not eager to help the BoS, specially with my character being more aligned with the Enclave.
---
Also, the current season pass does have burned me out quite a bit, so I‚Äôm not really looking forward to more grinding.
---
If you use the chemist's backpack, you could have 3 free points in strength. Thats just me though
---
Because sometimes we must suspend our disbelief so that the narrative and game mechanics can mesh. This can be especially true in online games.
---
I dont know what SBQ means.
---
I dont have an issue with the bow in boss fights but il also usually with friends when I do those.
---
I do run a gun back up for when shit hits the fan but I don't use it much
---
That‚Äôs my point because the previous reply said it would affect gameplay but I don‚Äôt see how 
---
They themselves aren‚Äôt rendering anything on the server
---
True however, they are also supposed to be still in their vault lol
---
i mainly use it for the ammo, which gets fed into the converter immediately since i only need shotgun shells. the weapons are just steel scrap for me.
---
&gt;Fallout is a single player RPG, they changed what the game is, so they  can make money off of folks like you who buy in to the bullshit.
---
Correction: Fallout 1,2, 3, NV and 4 are single player games. Fallout 76 is a multiplayer game.
---
I am really confused how people still seem to struggle with this concept.
---
&gt;A complete game, you know like the last three titles they released in  the series, none of those needed a continuous cash infusion in order to  keep them from ceasing to exist.
---
They charged money for the base game. Then charged money for each DLC released and then stopped all support for the game about  a year and a half if not 2 years after release.
---
Trying to compare that to a game that has a single buy and continual free content updates is stupid.  If we went by what other FO games have done you would have paid 60 for the base game, 15 for Wild Appilacha, 15 for the summer event and 20 to Wastelanders.  So around 110 dollars on the game.
---
&gt;You need to continue spending money to even play the game in the first place.
---
Only in the sense that you need to pay electricity and internet. But that applies to every game. At least were electricity is concerned. Anything else is provably false.

---
&gt;Good lord you are the dumbest person I've encountered on reddit.
---
Ironic considering you don't even know the difference between paid DLC and free content updates.
---
I have an ocd thing about using armored.  I know it doesn't give me much extra since I'm wearing a full set of secret service but I still like seeing the high number.  lol
---
You should start your own business if you can get them sell for 5k you‚Äôll be the greatest businessman
---
No. Only addictions count.
---
Sorry I remember growing up a military brat and at times I think I heard more of the talking More about the golf course that the rest of the base.
---
Nothing sassy about it. You asked a question that could easily be answered just by playing the game and taking a look around.  There's players everywhere not wearing power armor. Every. Single. Day.
---
I just wish when I buy from the Mole Miner person 3 star ranged weapon, I can at least pick heavy weapon, Rifle, Pistol, or SMG.
---
I just dropped 1000script last night and I got zero heavy weapons and mostly pistols.  (I'm hvy wpn build).  It really kills your soul.
---
Mr. Bean's favorite
---
I've done that a few times. Usually with Mr fuzzy rides. the owner watched me teleport into his home.
---
SBQ means scorched beast queen, it's the "end-boss" of the story \^\^
---
And I also had trouble doing good damage against things like imposter sheepsquatsch, so may I ask what kind of bosses you are fighting ?
---
I‚Äôve only found and killed one so far, I have one in a display case, looks like a large ball.. heavy though, 5Ibs!
---
Too many noobs duping Christmas presents. The game has an infinite anount of caps pouring in, same with ammo. Hope Bethesda has a good update next week.
---
I normally see the BOS as assholes, even though they‚Äôre badass. But idk the Appalachia BOS was the only line of defense against the nightmare of the scorched, and gave their lives to a man trying to take take them down. 
---
They‚Äôre heroes in my book.
---
I have this too.  I prefer long sessions than short bursts.
---
A lot of my time lately has been waiting for the vendor to refresh. 
---
Waiting for script to reset.  Carrying or storing weapons and armor.
---
Waiting for gold to reset.  
---
Waiting for dailies to reset for rep.  
---
The game as it stands seems to punish players for long sessions.  Surely the whole appeal of fallout 1st is private servers to farm mats and resources.  If they are doing this then at least enable persistent worlds.
---
Even the season pass forces to log in daily.  Other games with passes give the option to grind out in chunks rather than a set routine.  My playtime last night after a 12 hour shift was to grind out dailies in a regimented manner.  I usually game to relax, not complete chores.
---
I mean, it had rocket boosters by the time of the great war, right? It could have gone on a nationwide tour before the bombs fell as a propaganda tool.
---
Not sure if anyone has asked this yet or not, but was there any specific reason you did the defend quests for 2 of your workshops? I've almost always just waited for retake unless I have an exposed generator somewhere.
---
I know they're the same, but that would be an interesting variant on the nocturnal
---
You know that actually would be very smart like if you had the option just to pick what kind of weapon you could get out of it. Also really a thousand script and you didn't get one heavy weapon out of it I feel bad
---
It really is rough with the 1700 a week limit. I told a friend who played for the first year and I was trying to convince to come back. He was like, ‚Äúso let me get this straight: there‚Äôs a new currency called bullion which can only be procured by first collecting  T-Bills, which can only be obtained from certain events. Furthermore, there‚Äôs a weekly  limit on converting T-Bills to bullion, which for example would require six weeks to purchase SS armor chest arms, legs, and buttress for chest arms legs. No jet pack, no other mods‚Äî- and you need legendary scrip (150/day) to obtain the legendary module (limited to 10/day) to craft said armor. 
---
And on top of the that suck sand which YOU HAVE TO GRIND FOR 4-5 WEEKS with settlers/raiders to earn reputation that unlocks gauss shot/minigun plans purchasable with gold bullion!!‚Äù
---
I said ,‚Äùyeah. ‚Äú
---
He said, ‚Äúdo they still have problems with duping? ‚Äú 
---
‚ÄúWhen does FO76 not have problems with duping?‚Äù, I said. 
---
Hard Pass.
---
I feel the same, I‚Äôve built a new character with a NW special distribution that also works great in adventure for a stealth commando, which I am enjoying playing as well, my main is feeling a bit unused these days.
---
Corky
---
About a year ago you could mod certain weapons to get a fourth star. The sacrificial blade for the machete, the prime receiver for guns would put a fourth star on your weapon. But they patched that out.
---
My Quad gamma gun is named Wasteland Justice
---
Swap jump for action, and pip-boy with crouch.
---
I‚Äôm kind of in the opposite situation: I want to use PA, but since I haven‚Äôt farmed flux, I have been unable to add PA mods to increase the carry weight, thus leading me to normally play without it, mainly to have a higher carry weight thanks to the backpack.
---
This comes up so often, but you already can fly. It just takes a lot of grinding to get the SS Jetpack, then gotta have the right setup with perks, armor, and mutations, then just use a springboard trap and time the boosts right. 
---
Once you have the setup though, it‚Äôs as easy as claiming a workshop, putting down a blueprinted springboard, and launching yourself anywhere you want. [Here‚Äôs a video of a player using this technique](https://youtu.be/nbYemhMfq3E)
---
Yeah, saw this just a few days ago, basically one nerd is instructing some other dude on how to talk to a gamer girl on a date, and he tells him ‚Äúgame of the year? God of War. Disappointment of the year? Fallout 76! It‚Äôs a buggy piece of shit that looks like it was made 10 years because they still use an old engine! Death Stranding? Masterpiece‚Äù and he still mentions a couple other games which I can‚Äôt remember. 
---
Basically they repeated the most common arguments we‚Äôve all been hearing from day one. I think ‚Äúcringe-smile‚Äù really is the best description for my reaction.
---
The Brotherhood of Steel demands your tribute citizen.  You will hand over a portion of your junk stash to the brotherhood.
---
It's a community event. So.....
---
I‚Äôve never taken anything unlocked or locked just because I would feel bad
---
Thank you, I'm on Xbox ill check it out.
---
No no, it is a collective effort, about this time last year they put forward the challenge for us to kill Millions of Scorched and Scorched Beasts for rewards like this time.
---
That was hard to read
---
Have you tried a high Intel build? 30+ Intel and you can do a single event to level up.
---
There a different between ‚Äúplaying the game‚Äù and just grinding for levels. That shit is stale.
---
Feels like it sometimes.
---
Never used it. Stealth/sniper.
---
I do have it! That's why I'm asking, I have no clue why I don't see it anywhere while I have my sub active
---
Sometimes they just fall out of the sky, it's been an ongoing bug.
---
Lol yeah right they just made the decision to give us a tiny fraction of the amount of atoms we used to earn to try and promote sales. Theres no way they would do this
---
I'm not spending atoms on a paint job for underarmor me or players will never see
---
What's your basis for the 12hrs?
---
My camp consists solely out of floor and wall decor...
---
Sorry
---
Try this. Manually make sure you have the scrap you need to make it, on you in the inventory you carry.
---
I had a similar problem months ago while trying to craft things.
---
Might work.
---
Why would they even patch that out, what would the purpose be
---
Just add replay value dungeons that legit have hard to obtain rewards
---
Fullytron helped but thank you!
---
Thank you so much!!
---
Bruh WHAT
---
I'm still pretty new at the game,  I dont really remember the names of the monsters. Scortch beasts we fight a lot of. Ive also never been into Nuke zones yet
---
Dont you need vault steel for strangler heart armor? T-65 you need at least need 10 screws per set piece so I believe it's cheaper to make
---
Yes. better get collecting those golfballs
---
I think you go to the atomic shop and it‚Äôs under the FO1st section you have to activate the skin there. There is also skins for the camp hub thing itself but don‚Äôt activate them theyre broken
---
I wanna fly a vertibird and rain hell from the sky! Why not make THIS a legendary perk
---
The Brotherhood in Appalachia already proved they stick to their own self interests. You learn this while following the story. None of the groups could work together and they all died
---
Ok my junkies legendaries say damage is greater while suffering from addiction. But in angry turtle‚Äôs video on YouTube his says damage is greater while suffering from withdrawal and in other pic/videos ive seen. So why is that? And is there a difference?
---
Anything can kinda be stealthy if everyone is too busy being dead to detect you. üòâ
---
I just realized last night that the legendary vendor has a limit and that it resets every 20 hrs. I had to start dropping legendary items cause I filled up my box and inventory with starred gear.  I've just started grinding gold and I'm already discouraged with what other people are writing.
---
 The most you can get from any single kill or event is either 4,000 or 6,500. That‚Äôs not enough at the higher levels.
---
Agreed, recently got into a rut where I effectively logged in to max my script, do the one reputation I have left, check a couple vendors and log out to go play LoL or some other game. They should really look at increasing the caps, I understand why there is a limit but it's at the point it's just tedious.
---
Well that's fine then, the Scorched Beast Queen is a boss scorched best you get when nuking a certain area of the map, so you probably haven't fought it \^\^
---
I know what kind of feeling you mean though it's really cool for sneak-killing normal mobs.
---
nope, there isn't any. if there was I wouldn't be asking. that's what I can't understand, maybe they removed them or something because I own a bundle for raiders and my sub is active yet I cannot find it anywhere nor the info about how to get them. everyone says in the atom shop but I check it almost daily and there's nothing :(
---
What happens in a week?
---
The perfectly preserved pie in vendors is just a meme lol like putting you've been insulted note in there for 25k
---
I have 5 characters 2 I made after the score system came out for leveling challenges it's so easy people need to stop complaining about the things other people use for easy score just because they refuse to have another character (which they should anyway for holding stuff) or play Nuclear Winter which some people dont mind playing for the score. I'd much rather log into NW and place 3 camps in 1 match then run around looking for 5 legendary enemies and hoping some sweaty bloodied build doesn't 1 shot it before you can do damage.
---
Every game of this nature time gates
---
I mean I get it because NW is like a side quest for the character, so it makes sense that the points are the same.  But I‚Äôm not going to move points around just to get OP perks in MW like frog legs.
---
What do you play on?
---
Ever since I got Chinese stealth armor I don‚Äôt use mine any more, even for SBQ. Bows for range and then battle axe up close, always sneaking. I still dust off the PA sometimes because unloading thousands of rounds on SBs can be fun. It‚Äôs a PITA to have to change all the perk cards though.
---
Time gating is what people who lack vision use as content. Devs need to go play Diablo 3 and experience the rift/grift endgame and look at how they use currency and materials, maybe that will open their minds.
---
The Brotherhood is coming to Appalachia to save humankind from its worst enemy, which is itself.  All that junk in the wrong hands can be used to build dangerous technologies that could bring about the world's downfall. We cannot allow that to happen.
---
Yes I have...when they could stack punji boards or whatever they call them that's how I figured out you can teleport out with a nukashine. Apparently you've never drank a nukashine lol!
---
PC, why?
---
I b like the idea of it being instance (and I really hope is challenging enough like a raid) 
---
I hope this content is aim for players that aim to organizes a run and not something that can be done with random ppl.
---
It's weird I've never had anyone pick the lock to my water or the door to my bedroom I keep locked for no reason and I've been playing since beta, I want to zap lockpickers lol
---
I'm pretty sure that the sentry bot killed the beast and it landed on Op's house. No random appearing scorchbeast bug, just a cool encounter
---
Maybe they're happy that they can cork their wine and get classy
---
So fucking true
---
Ive had the messenger turn hostile against me and i couldn‚Äôt hurt him he was invincible. I had to run and sneak for him to go passive again even then he followed me so far off the path it turn forever for him to get back to where he originally left off.
---
Top tier idea right there.  I just do a run through of west tek and harpers ferry for a guaranteed level.  I wonder if just rolling a new character is faster.  You pretty much level up by the time you get out of the vault.  And one good game in NW at lvl 1 is a level up.
---
100 score lol
---
At no point heard the Scorchbeast or Sentrybot? Not trying to rain on your parade, haha.
---
What works sometimes for me is to stand in the exact point he's stuck for a few secs and usually that makes him teleport a few meters away but yeah it's bugged as hell
---
Good question. This happened right before the added the purveyor. So maybe they didn‚Äôt want people trying to add a four star legendary to the script machine? But who knows. But.... they did away with it right before the purveyor. I had a four star machete, and after that patch/update, it went back to 3*.
---
Yeah same. I only have kill robots with certain weapons and bugged ones left. üòÇ
---
Pretty sure the auto nukes are only in the pts.
---
The bomb drop event may be something similar, but nobody really knows
---
Yep. All backpack mods are completely useless to me, because im specced into using power armor. 
---
I wish there was a fridge type thing for us power armor users.
---
ARE THEY EVER GOING TO FIX IT? or just fu\*@#$ forget about it. Seems like a small patch to me.
---
They do it to artificially inflate the player count because people feel forced to log on to the game. In reality I play less when I hit caps
---
Actually, it‚Äôs both. Please look it up.
---
I remember distinctly seeing a responder vendor there and according to the wiki Free States, BOS, raiders, and responders all traded here (Look under the factions section). At any rate, the Whitesprings is by far the safest location in WV, in lore theres no ferals there since the robots would have killed them. Plus its central location for both raiders and responders makes it the perfect trading spot
---
Ash Heap is even worse. If he hits the fire and goes down, he‚Äôs stuck. On a death loop. Forever. 
---
You can‚Äôt even fail the event anymore except by waiting out the timer.
---
Hmm just in case I'd be cautious, but it really sounds that the auto nuke is just for testing yes.
---
I wouldnt consider this an mmo in the slightest though.
---
Ok, friend.
---
I got you beat,  last week I got a one star suppressor spear, just ridiculous.
---
Atoms are their tokens for the "real money" shop, the little parcels of Atoms unlocked through challenges are just supposed to give you a taster (and encourage you to buy more). They're never gonna let you trade in-game caps for Atoms.   
---
There's no in-game economy controlling the value of caps. Items may have a pricetag RRP but loot is random and infinite, and caps are earned for almost every action making them worth basically nothing.
---
It‚Äôs crazy how they haven‚Äôt even responded to it. Like atleast acknowledge it
---
If you happen to empty the scrip machine early morning one day, then got your gold bullion and caps from vendors at another time, it REALLY fucks it up the following day. You do have to start keeping a log of what times you did stuff. Its stupid.
---
same here
---
Worked for me. Thank you very much!
---
Don‚Äôt forget the Broadsider. We don‚Äôt really have hardly any cannons in 76 to begin with, and cannonballs... Yeah, no. It‚Äôs just too weird. And not even good. 
---
As a *concept* the Cryolator could work if it was a ramshackle version... Like say, a Fireman Protectron arm.
---
And I don't consider salad food and yet it is served in restaurants.   From launch the game has been set up like an MMO. The mechanics are done like an MMO. And they do everything an MMO does just in a different way.
---
&gt;Fallout is a single player RPG, they changed what the game is, so they can make money off of folks like you who buy in to the bullshit.
---
&gt;Correction: Fallout 1,2, 3, NV and 4 are single player games. Fallout 76 is a multiplayer game.
---
&gt;I am really confused how people still seem to struggle with this concept.
---
I realize it's a multiplayer game. No struggle. I do not like multiplayer games. I like Fallout because I like single player RPGs. I guess I could have said Fallout had always been and still should be an RPG.
---
&gt;They charged money for the base game. Then charged money for each DLC released and then stopped all support for the game about a year and a half if not 2 years after release.
---
&gt;Trying to compare that to a game that has a single buy and continual free content updates is stupid. If we went by what other FO games have done you would have paid 60 for the base game, 15 for Wild Appilacha, 15 for the summer event and 20 to Wastelanders. So around 110 dollars on the game.
---
Mhmm. They sure did. Except I bought the Fallout 4 GOTY edition for 49.99 which included all the DLCs. Got the bundle for New Vegas as well, with everything included at the same price. I also never needed support, since they finished 99% of the game before they released it, instead of having subscribers pay to beta test it. 
---
Also, in 10 years I'm going to be able to fire up the PS3 and replay the whole new Vegas adventure. Think this will still be here in 10 years? Think maybe if it is I'd have to subscribe to something else if I want to play it again? 
---
&gt;Ironic considering you don't even know the difference between paid DLC and free content updates
---
I know the difference. I never had to pay extra for the DLC, and the free content updates for FO76 have been the gaming equivalent of unlimited breadsticks at Olive Garden. 
---
They changed the best aspects of the game and adopted a pricing model that is quite frankly insulting. 
---
If I wanted to play Fallout: Shelter I'd have gone to the app store. This game is a haphazard money grab.
---
It always cracks me up when I try to give a low-lever person some goodies and they can‚Äôt figure out how to trade or even look in a paper bag. I spend a good bit of time making kick ass leather armor and level 5 BoS sniper rifles just to give away to noobs who visit my camp. Sometimes people just want to do their own thing and don‚Äôt want to be bothered, and that‚Äôs ok too. Don‚Äôt feel bad, I guarantee you didn‚Äôt hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings.
---
If I could continue to turn in stuff for caps, scrip and gb, I would be playing many more hours per day just because I enjoy the environment.   However, once I hit those limits....what's the point?   Get in, get it done, and get out.
---
On console (where I play) none of that happens fortunately. I feel awful for the PC players.
---
LMFAO
---
No clue how to delete them
---
For future reference though always do that shit at a workshop so you don't mess up your camp. Plus you won't use any of your own junk
---
The enemy is already in the game. You have a chance for him to spawn when you nuke certain areas in the map. Now he has a 10% of spawning. 
---
The EVENT hasn‚Äôt been released for the ps4 yet. It was only available for the private test servers but something was apperantly wrong with it. So the event that has him is postponed for now. But the enemy is already in the game.
---
Grinding? Dude its just 1 level, leveling up is easy as fuck in this game lol
---
I would agree with you, but destiny has ruined me. I loved that franchise. But the bounty grinding has killed me. FO76 has a lot of faults, but I can do the dailies, and the then play the game. I can‚Äôt do that with D2, if I don‚Äôt do any bounties then I will get nowhere with their seasonal system.
---
I price my pie at 30,000 caps to show it off. Not because I expect people to buy it from me. Like you said yourself, if you so desperately want a pie. Go to west tek and get it. No need to buy it from other people.
---
Just pve in pvp that's what i like 2 do. Land in places that should have npc spawns. You get xp for em. Or camp if that's your thing but don't kill other campers that's f'd up. As well as not queuing in with a random team.
---
That‚Äôs literally what Crater does, from their very own mouths.
---
I don‚Äôt mind limits for the most part. It‚Äôs when I‚Äôm physically incapable of playing that makes me want to quit. It‚Äôs a big reason mobiles have the largest player counts and yet so few consistent fans that stick with their products. 
---
Caps limit? Fine, junk adds up but ok. Bullion? That I actually agree with, it‚Äôs endgame content so some work is cool by me, SCRIPS. I should not have to drop legendary items because I have to decide between losing 40 scrip or carrying an 18lb minigun that keeps me over my storage limit. That‚Äôs just irritating and there shouldn‚Äôt be a cap to how many legendary modules I can afford in a day when they already cap at 10 a day.
---
There a pain. At most you'll be able to place one melon, or gourd, per tile.
---
&gt; and can also lead to death for a bloodied build like me
---
Daily reminder that you're boring and generic for playing a bloodied build.
---
Soooo exciting -_-
---
Grinding reputation in World of Warcraft is more enjoyable than this...
---
It wasn't done as an anti-duping measure. Character bound items are normal in online games, they want you to work for them instead of buying them off another player.
---
Anyone know what type of ammo he collects? Im interested but i only really use a select few types of ammo
---
Did they fix that finally?  Either way, I‚Äôd go ultracite.  I guess it depends on how often you roam nuke zones and collect flux, though.
---
LMFAO......I think he has the opposite of those laws programmed in......My favorite is when he threatens to burn my CAMP to the ground.......It's like his way of saying I love you......He's not good with feelings......lol
---
Damn.  I‚Äôm still not allied with either faction.  I can‚Äôt do those dailies anymore. Make me sick.
---
I‚Äôve never heard of different wording. But it‚Äôs ADDICTIONS, Not withdrawals.
---
The reason it matters is you always have the addiction unless you take addictol. But you may or may not be suffering withdrawals if you are or are not currently ‚Äúon‚Äù whatever you‚Äôre addicted to. Alcohol addiction, but just drank whiskey? No withdrawals.
---
It being addictions and not withdrawals is good. And it is addictions.
---
Tuesday
---
How do the pies prevent this?
---
I can't help imagining that "gorilla" tactics involve either beating you with fists for staring too long, or intimidating people by playing the drums to Phil Collins like the old Dairy Milk [advert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAOZ14Tjg7A).
---
Vertibirds  just crash in general in fallout 4 so like oh boy...
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
Ah that's what I thought you were referring to but how does the pie play into this?
---
Would be kind of fun lol
---
Ooh. Prime is ultracite, right? I ain‚Äôt gonna go mining for that. Could you show me your perks?
---
Ah damn. That's what I was afraid of. I have to angle them in such a weird way to fit them and sometimes they won't even be placeable anyways. Thanks!
---
"Sweetie"? Get the fuck outta here with that condescending bullshit.
---
I don't really think it would because what if you label yourself as a 'chem shop' but then someone comes and buys out all your chems leaving only radx and rad away. People will see the label 'chem shop' then go to your CAMP only to find rad away available.
---
Another example, let's say you label yourself 'legendary gear shop' because you have some legendary weapons. However, you also have some outfits for sale. People will go to your CAMP expecting your 'armor section' to contain legendary armor. But, all they find are outfits instead.
---
I think the best way to go about this is to separate what is actually available in the vendors themselves. It will make it much easier for people to determine what the person is actually selling.
---
I would sacrifice my entire set of unyielding action point recharge weapon weight reduced armor to have a weapon weight reduction mod for my PA. It can be a max stack of every currency, I'll be happy to grind it if it means I don't have to keep hopping in and out of my PA every time I want to fast travel or sprint.  
---
It amazes me that I can carry every weapon in the game(not a joke, all of them, the whole lot), hundreds of meds, and still have over a hundred pounds of carry weight to play around with outside of my PA, but in it I'm over 300lbs overencombered with every carry weight perk in the game.
---
Remove the pie from West Tek?
---
There are events coming that focus on building up Atlas Observatory, so we'll be preparing for their arrival.
---
Is this some kind of trick or just a joke?
---
You mean put jump on E, action on space, crouch on tab and pip boy on control?
---
Either bought by idiots or someone needed to make room in caps to sell something to someone else.
---
Hmm. Not sure what the issue is for me. A few times I logged in. Sometimes there was the loop. When I logged in, I would often be kicked to the main menu. Sometimes, as soon as it started signing in, the whole application crashed. This was yesterday. Haven‚Äôt tried yet.
---
"Do you gUyS not hAvE phOneS?"
---
Let's be real. Fallout 76 is barely an mmo. Its basically just fallout 4 if it had online play. Very few mmo elements.
---
1) this is hardly an MMO
---
2) i‚Äôve never played an MMO that time gates every single avenue of content
---
I started in the Beta and played up until they put Repair Kits in the Atom Shop. I came back several weeks ago because I was told there was a ton of new content, which is true, but the amount of bugs and broken things in the game that have existed for almost 2 years now is insane.
---
I've lost atleast 18 Weeklies and atleast 17 Dailies to the Autocomplete bug and despite grinding out during 2x xp and Double SCORE and playing every single day since the Legendary Run began I just now hit Rank 50. Bethesda has been zero help.
---
I've had to exploit the Settlers Rep because despite starting when the Legendary Run began I haven't been able to even talk to Ward until 2 days ago. He'd do his dialogue then sit on a blank screen no matter how long I waited and I even reinstalled the game twice. Including on Steam and it just now suddenly worked. So that's week's worth of dailies gone.
---
I really like the game too. There's so much good stuff but there's just a metric TON of easily resolved issues that they refuse to take care of. Like why the hell is the Gatling Plasma Splitter and my Flamer still broken? They can't hit anything outside of melee range and this was an issue in the BETA.
---
Oh, I've also lost 4 Raider dailies because the server disconnected and it just removed it from my quest list. I can't get the Commander ally because the quest wont update and Bethesda just tells me to reinstall the Bethesda Launcher after 8 days of waiting and being told the person can't help me and they need to elevate my ticket MULTIPLE TIMES.
---
It *destroyed* me finding out that In order to get T65 PA with the basic mods and a Gauss Minigun with just 2 mods I'd have to wait 52 days..... and that's probably the fastest of the Gold sets+ weapons to earn.
---
It's so easy to level up though. Do a few runs around whitespring, complete a few events all while using some form of xp boost. It doesn't take long.
---
I... didn't say it was pay to win? I'm literally agreeing with the point you made in the post I replied to, wherein you said something along the lines of the workers still needing a paycheck. Dial down the assholery, okay "sweetie"?
---
I bought it for nuclear winter.
---
Occasionally you are able to drop a foundation that really should be supported but the game will get glitchy and think it is floating.  There are a couple ways to ‚Äúanchor‚Äù it.  You can add adjacent foundations until one is detected as anchored or use a ladder to a 2nd story and a ladder back down to another foundation, then remove from the stuck items to the new anchoring foundation.  It can be finicky.  Anyone who spends a lot of time building has had this issue.  I agree with the other reply, use workshops for blueprinting and experimenting.  Less risk of this type of stuff and free building materials.
---
Does it matter? The point is they sell
---
What are you playing now?  I am curious to what everyone is doing away from 76. I used to play Division 2 but that game is ruined. I used to play Ghost Recon Breakpoint but it is a charlie foxtrot.  I have been playing through Minecraft Dungeons. I keep coming back here though.
---
yep
---
Lol, understandable.
---
What kind of cookies?
---
The next part doesn't require it, whenever the community hits a milestone the base will look more fortified and everyone gets a reward. It's not to catch dupers, it's to get higher active player numbers.
---
Funny, every single person I tell this to has 0 interest in the game. Wonder why.
---
To a certain extent I would also, though I will say I gave up on the bullion grind one one of my 2 characters that went through the content.  The time gating is part of the reason.  On my 'main' I stopped grinding and just make sure I get my weekly and occasionally turn in notes.
---
Shotguns too.
---
Perfectly preserved chocolate chip.
---
*That* hit oddly close to home.
---
None of the ghillie skins work in nw
---
I never used it until the level 80+ when you firght the scorchbeast in a nuked zone you need it
---
I also carry 350+ lbs of stuff so this is requiered for farming
---
And here I was happy to finally have my super sledge silenced
---
*_X-01 intensifies_*
---
Yup. That's why I quit a while ago. Plus I had nothing else to really do in the game.
---
The NW Ghillie suit is different than the armor ones from the legendary run.  I think you can earn it in the NW game at 2500 NW XP or something like that.
---
Edit:  I posted before looking who posted.  You probably already knew this and we‚Äôre making a different point.
---
I loved this game, and played it from 3 weeks before wastelanders until last week, when I logged in, realized how utterly bored I was, and then did literally anything else, because this game is an empty shell that gives the illusion of substance. Being a merchant was my end game, but duping killed the economy. Nobody wants to buy stuff when there are B2525 and BE25 fixers floating around for free.
---
While the limits are annoying, they aren't exclusive to this game. In fact, most games nowadays find a way to limit the player in some way. It's a frustrating trend, but it's pretty widespread.
---
I think the bigger issue is the lack of actual content. Even if they removed all of those limits, I would still have nothing to do.
---
I'm pretty sure it's gonna have casual lining mods like all the other atom shop underarmors.
---
&gt;I realize it's a multiplayer game. No struggle. I do not like multiplayer games. I like Fallout because I like single player RPGs. I guess I could have said Fallout had always been and still should be an RPG.
---
Then why in Atom's radioactive ball sack are you here on this sub reddit if you don't like multiplayer games?  Fallout 76 isn't a game you enjoy. Doesn't make the game bad. Nor does it magically mean all other FO games will be this style of game.   
---
People like you need to get the fuck over yourselves when you pretend like you are the only source for what is and isn't a good game and demand every game conform to your desires.  You are not video game god and you do not get to dictate everything.
---
&gt; Mhmm. They sure did. Except I bought the Fallout 4 GOTY edition for  49.99 which included all the DLCs. Got the bundle for New Vegas as well,  with everything included at the same price. I also never needed  support, since they finished 99% of the game before they released it,  instead of having subscribers pay to beta test it. 
---
Which only comes out a year or two after the game's official support is done which means the company made all the money they could off the base game and DLC sales and now are simply trying to get as much money out of the franchise as possible.  Many game companies will do this with games were they will offer a GOTY edition and/or reduce the price of the base game and often offer massive discounts on the DLC that they wouldn't have offered when it was new.   
---
However FO4 has been the same since Aug 2016. No new content will ever be released by Bethesda for that game.  76 however will continue to recive content updates for years.   GTA Online has been getting content updates for around 6 years or so.  So for the base price of the game you are looking at at least 6 years of free game content.  All for the price of the base game which isn't even full price anymore.
---
You might as well be complaining about why your console is a one time $500 payment but your car insurance needs to be paid every month. That is how little you actually understand what you are comparing.
---
&gt; I know the difference. I never had to pay extra for the DLC, and the  free content updates for FO76 have been the gaming equivalent of  unlimited breadsticks at Olive Garden. 
---
No you just had to wait until the series is so old and sales have dropped that the company takes any way possible to keep making money and offer a GOTY edition because they will not make money off individual sales anymore as market saturation has been hit. 
---
Unlimited breadsticks at Olive Garden is amazing. It is like the only reason to actually go there.  That said it also shows how little you fucking understand what you are talking about when you try to hint that there has barely been any work done.   Then again by the logic you have shown so far you clearly haven't played the game so you are talking out of your ass.  
---
New events, new quests new things to do along take a lot of effort. This isn't something that can be banged out over a weekend. And Wastelander's update in particular was a massive undertaking. 
---
Dunning-Kruger effect is in over drive with you right now.
---
I'm a power armor build but I am stacked with mutations but if I click the jump buttons just as I land it should cancel it out
---
Read the OP‚Äôs post again.
---
I had basically the same thing happen but it was just 2 foundations snapped side by side.   
---
For whatever reason the game occasionally treats a foundation placed very close to the ground as if it was *under* the ground, so once another one is added to it, at the same height, the game thinks they're both holding each other up and both floating.   
---
Snapping more foundations over to some lower terrain makes the game recognise that the foundations are sitting **on** the ground, not under it.   
---
I've had problems with stairs in the past, too, but luckily that was at a workshop because I couldn't fix it at all. I just abandoned the place instead.
---
Two cost 30k , 30k is the most caps you can have. They don't have to be the pies it could be literally anything.
---
You missed a fair amount of ore. Did you go threw every tunnel, as well as the secret one?
---
All good...I still use the suit but am sadface about the armor
---
I say extend the map by at least 25% (NSEW). Get rid of Cap and Scrip limits. Extend the note limit (2x). Finally extend the storage limit by at least 2x the limit already (1600 instead of 800 is pretty decent).
---
what platform are you if pc i can show you the most optimized run
---
edit : because nope, 100 it's really not a good  run, you can expect x4
---
Because weapon and armor sales from vendors are so worthwhile as is? The kinds of items I would be interested in are normally trade only, and giving me the ability to make them isnt going to take money out of anybody else's pocket.  Maybe it will encourage people to not put overpriced trash in their vendors.
---
It was normal. She would stop occasionally to say something, then go back to running towards CAMP unless we encountered an enemy or enemies, in which case she would fight, take cover, and even pursue attackers until they were dispatched.
---
A little reminder that each account can have 4 chars total and you have no clue what other builds he maybe plays. Take dat shit elsewhere mate.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter *why* they bought it. They bought it.
---
Is this a discord group? And are you on xbox?
---
Turns out we were using bootleg copies of actual PA made out of cork all the time. That's why we didn't have better carry weight or legendary parts yet.
---
Sadly doesn't, but good tip for the future
---
I'm not asking for help, I'm offering information. As I've said in other comments: I expected the difference in damage between it and the Gauss Pistol to be more in line with the difference between the 10mm and the Combat Shotgun, which is nowhere near the case.
---
Oh Destiny 2 killed you too huh? I don't want to insult people but the community in r/DestinyTheGame baffles me. Spending months complaining about the garbage that are the new seasons, and rightfully so, then the weapon "sunsetting" came and made things worse. Oh but a new cool trailer for a 60$ expansion coming this november that will give you a new skilltree and not advance any of the hanging story threads? Everything is forgotten! It's bizarre to me, and I wonder if the same will happen here with the upcoming BoS quests and updates.
---
The word is scrip.
---
I understand and see your point.  It would be nice to have the ghillie on the armor.  I‚Äôm not great at PVP so I‚Äôm better off with no armor and blending in vs the few extra hp I get while loosing stealth in armor that stands out.
---
I'm moving my camp there just to spite you.
---
Never bother doing messenger in the ash heap. He always gets stuck on small pieces of fire in the road. Cycles between getting up and falling down repeatedly.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt make them follow us then... there are dozens of NPCs around Appalachia each with their own set of scripts, some are sophisticated, some are standard enemies/friendlies. Having a few more, even if it‚Äôs just limited to private servers would be great. 
---
Would be awkward having multiple Daguerre‚Äôs running around but I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll find a way to work around that lol. 
---
Bethesda. :)
---
1. This is an MMO
---
2. Then you haven' t played an MMO.
---
Runescape going from level 1 to 99 can take months if not years depending on factors and what year you were playing.  
---
Ports would take hours to complete the voyage as the only source of certain items to make level 85 weapons. And you would have to complete dozens of them to build up weapons.  
---
Grinding out anything would take hours to complete basic levels. Bosses would have to be killed thousands of times to get drops.
---
Same thing different way.
---
Foundation also is led by the guy who voiced Jet from Cowboy Bepop so they auto win in my book
---
Out of the loop, why exactly are the Brotherhood needing cork scrap and why is it a big meme?
---
You missed quite a few nodes and/or didn‚Äôt keep collecting from each node until it was depleted. 
---
Also, use super-duper to increase output when smelting.
---
Why? It's free real estate.
---
Lol cry about it. I'm gonna server hop and get like 20 pies to display in my camp. No one should ever pay for an item you can pick up for free.
---
Mmmm, your downvotes are...Good With Salt.
---
NW is such a poorly designed and clearly rushed game mode. If they‚Äôre gonna make their entire pvp mode a BR because fortnite at least give it some QOL. Who the fuck wants their pvp build to be completely reliant on their pve build? Garbage design, zero brain cells went into this
---
I can mod it for you if you still need it done
---
I know 30k caps is the cap limit but how does prevent them from steal from your stash?
---
The duping issue aside for a sec, Thats sort of how most other games work. The highest level gear is locked behind a grind. Its supposed to take you quite a while to obtain it. Its not supposed to be readily available in some vending machine.
---
Daily reminder that you're not special because you have a different build.
---
It's about 15 minutes on a new character. It doesn't count the level up in the vault. You have to get to level 3 I think. I tried it the other day. Ran around and discovered a few locations and punched a bunch of enemies and NPCs.
---
They can't buy out your entire vendor inventory cause you have two items costing 30k each. This they would need 60k to do it plus the cost of everything else you are selling.
---
Edit to expand: to make it clear it does not have to be pie, could be literally anything they just used the pie.
---
Yeah that's cute and all, but it doesn't explain why you think the level up challenge is, in any way, actually challenging.
---
You have to delete them in reserve order. If you are using the 2 square stair, then you need to delete the walls touching it as well. There are a few tactics of building a temp scaffolding on the outside of your camp to edit the inside, it just has to have a foundation and a floor tile touching each floor. I had to do this many times to build a space cruiser.
---
Heavy gunner perk cars. Stabilzed. Nerd rage
---
I can maybe stay on for about half an hour but then I'm gonna come off
---
Other players can come across it and loot it. They get wanted tho. I've done it a couple times thinking it was a regular random one. üòü
---
Thank you. I am on Xbox and have played since Beta and never took the time to learn.
---
Ew. Enclave
---
Yes thank you, that would be awesome
---
1+1+1+11=14
---
Don't surprise if i steal your stuff, you attack me and i break your house down. Not real life buddy, it's game mechanic.
---
I would like that
---
Try placing them from a blueprint.   
---
For whatever reason blueprints of single objects seem to be a bit more forgiving, when it comes to collision/placement, than the proper menu entries for the objects themselves.   
---
EDIT: I haven't tried it with crops, let me know if it works.
---
I like this idea loads sick of having weapons literally dropping out me pockets I'm that over weight
---
From my understanding, anything over roughly 300 or 400 will have diminishing returns. Something to keep in mind.
---
Interesting, I will have to give that a try next time I'm on NW
---
[Weird](https://imgur.com/gallery/1mltwsp), because no, it‚Äôs not an MMO. 
---
You named 1 game, and even with your choice of game to argue with, still wrong. You can grind endlessly to your hearts content each day. That‚Äôs not time-gating. Sure, drop rates are low and statistically it will take a long time to get what you want. But not necessarily. Could get it your first try. The point is they *let* you grind as much as you want, where FO76 (again, not an MMO) puts a very hard and impassable cap on your grinding.
---
And baseballs
---
The 76ers if u will
---
Welcome to a Bugthesda game, all mg weekly challenges were completed haha
---
I assume one wasteland will let you have higher difficulty too, since there will apparently be a difficulty slider... as opposed to the "Every enemy caps out at 62"
---
Make them a gold bullion item only as well as only from the purveyor with an incredibly low chance. So you have to buy the plan from the SS Raiders or Settlers, then have to roll script in the hopes you ever get one. This way it cannot be dropped, sold, traded, or duped. Could always sell your whole Xbox live account though but if your anything like me I've had this account since the 360 came out so someone would have to offer me A LOT for me to think about selling it.
---
**Me**: *Guys, can we please take it easy on the expected Legendary? I think everyone needs it.*

**Everyone**: :::*one shots Legendary:::*

I would like me one of those middle finger emotes, very much.
---
Doesn't explain why my game crashes after playing for about 20 minutes
---
It's like that subreddit is made of people with different opinions about the game WTF ü§Ø
---
He‚Äôs saying that everybody would make their own god-tier weapons. After a week there would be no reason to grind legendary enemies for legendary loot or go to Mama Mumbles.
---
The never-ending ride.
---
Why would it be anachronistic? It‚Äôs just a Walther. Realistically it would be a common find.
---
We already heard from the datamined transmissions that the BoS Elder isn't exactly happy about what this expedition force is doing and we already know the title of the future content updates so...
---
Thanks
---
From a lore perspective, the amount of technological prowess being showed by the current citizenry of West Virginia is already problematic. 
---
I anticipate (kind of hope honestly) that the game builds to some calamity in the future. 
---
We already know that thanks to future events, that the Ohio River is going to wind up horribly polluted further north at The Pitt. Once that pollution starts to affect Appalachia I imagine all that foliage in the forest is going to die off, and things are going to start to go to hell fast
---
We need a way to close public teams too, sometimes I just want to run alone to get the boosts of both Lone Wanderer and Herd Mentality. I want to open my Public Team and then close it off.
---
I just want a radio station where the music isnt on a 15 minutes repeat :)

Cool cool, my GT is Zachy Chan13 if you want to join or invite me

I‚Äôve had it happen five time so far but only with daily‚Äôs. I feel your pain though, that‚Äôs got to be disheartening.
---
I actually just built my first pc, so i‚Äôve just switched from ps4 to that. I‚Äôve been playing mostly League of Legends and modded DayZ Standalone with a bit of RuneScape 3. But i‚Äôd also like to get into some heavily modded Skyrim and maybe The Witcher III.
---
I stopped playing 76 after i got through the Wastelanders main story and realized it was all just a time gate after that lol. I figured no point in wasting this time grinding and not having fun when I could have fun on other games.
---
Yeah, I know that, but I hope we can see them marching, or so...
---
Wait when youre alone in a team you still profit from lone wanderer?
---
You know the unique named weapons survival mode challenges used to give? I'm talking about that kinda thing but this would be interesting to see. Some kind of Mk2 legendary module plan for bullion would be great
---
I‚Äôll join you now, mine is ‚Äúl Se7en l‚Äù
---
Who said that? 
---
It's just a huge problem with how bad Bethesda are at balancing this game so that the only fucking build anyone can use that actually does decent damage is the bloodied build.
---
It's been 2 years and Bethesda still haven't bothered to put some thought into the end game and make more builds viable so that everyone isn't the same boring character.
---
And now we've got a subreddit full of entitled bloodied players who whine whenever they have to do anything that doesn't involve crouching in a corner and one shotting enemies and it makes the game boring as fuck.
---
***
---
"Ooooh I can't do this event mechanic, I'm a *bloodied* build so someone else has to do it for me" ~ **Everyone**
---
Why are bloodied players all like this??
---
FO is wonderful for early game content.  For late game, it is content poor and lacks scalability and equally doesn't have real challenges that require grinding to accomplish.
---
They seem like they simply can't afford to develop the game quick enough which is super sad given the deep fan base they have developed over years.
---
I guess some day they'll have 4-star equipment and perhaps new challenges but that feels years away.  I hope I am wrong
---
The Railroad didn‚Äôt invent it, it‚Äôs a Walther.
---
It is a 1900s weapon. No lore conflict. 
---
Fin.
---
This would be interesting as fuck
---
So wiki is the final say on this dispite how the game is set up, how it is handled and how everything is done?

---
hey I can do this to.
---
Cool cool, my camp is right by foundation. I'll be there in a sec just doing a challenge
---
Yes this!
---
A close runner up emote would be Captain Picard's facepalm.
---
Just glitch it my dude.
---
What if they just buy what they want and ignore the 30k priced items? I get what you're saying but if they saw say my Urban Scout mask, which I'll never put in my vendor, wouldn't they just buy that and leave the pie?
---
The picture one is not for NW.
---
Do you have milk? I‚Äôm not joining if there‚Äôs no milk.
---
You load 3 tons (of cork), whadya get?
---
Hmm maybe try photo mode on adventure? I don‚Äôt remember the exact wording of mine but it worked for me in adventure. Good luck!
---
Sarcastic counter argument. Every regular armor piece can have deep pocketed. That's regular armors version of calibrated shocks. Regular armor should not be able to equip back packs because if they wanted regular armor to have more carry weight, they would have given deep pockets more carry weight when they designed it. Back packs are obviously designed exclusively for Chinese Stealth armor.
---
Have you actually played an MMO before?  What MMO mechanics do you think you're seeing?  Raids?  Dungeons?  Party composition?  Classes?  An actual endgame?  Massive multiplayer?
---
This game has none of that.  "Multiplayer" and "MMO" are not synonyms.
---
Actually going to go do awol real quick so I can get my last legendary today haha
---
Uhh, fallout 76 identifies itself as an ARPG. You linked an opinionated article. Tf, nowhere near the same
---
Sounds good, fast traveling there now.
---
Oh I'm not defending the mechanics. Just pointing out that claiming you're farming exp is still an excuse  for not helping, but obviously you'll never admit it because you'd rather justify your behavior and pretend like it's not a selfish thing to do lol which isn't surprising.
---
Farming exp is fine, but don't ruin events for other people and try to pass it off as your the good guy that's all.
---
Oh and shitty mechanics still doesn't excuse shitty behavior. I can admit the mechanics can be shit, but can you admit so is the attitude of the people who rather fail events for exp than hp others get the full rewards? If not I think we're done here.
---
No this was a huge mistake on their part, so probably 150
---
I travelled to someone‚Äôs camp yesterday. When I arrived I must have landed in their ammo factory that was in a basement of sorts. Only way out was to pick the lock. I picked the lick to leave and ended up wanted. Had a little fun defending myself after I ran back home and dumped all my stuff. Only level 48 but made the level 78 who came after me burn through a bunch of stealth.
---
Wasn't it August 3rd? Tomorrow Monday?
---
I got four gourds on one tile without any issue. Melons I only have one of though.
---
It's bugged I got my atoms back submit a ticket.
---
No see the glitch is I buy all your vendor items then I steal everything I want from your stash. You want people to ignore it, it is not really for sale. It is there to make sure something always for sale so they don't use an exploit and steal your urban scout mask.
---
yep. and when you get to that daily limit on multiple characters... *sadface* I guess I'm taking a break since I can grind to get rewards or even buy atom shop content but ...what do I do with it? my budget is maxed and no free character slots so I can't build without tearing my stuff down. I love this game so much, I want something to do ...
---
I never understand the reasoning behind locking a door to ones camp interior, it‚Äôs not like anyone can steal all the atomic shop crap you got all over the place, some resources I can understand being locked, the only thing locked in my camp is my ammo maker, everything else is there for the taking whether you need it or not, why in all the hell would you lock an ammo converter?
---
Answer: 10 Sofia clones showing up at somebody‚Äôs camp.
---
Thank you everyone, I didn't realise it has been put in the game - I don't launch nukes often on a private world.... okay I haven't got there and I could guarantee I would die a bazillion times of I tried.
---
I shoot down every one I see in 76 too.
---
kevduit has a map on his website
---
Thanks for that info, still does not help the character I have now though
---
i mean, other games do have glitches... but we're waaaaaaaaaay past the point where all of fallout 76's problems can't be directly attributed to bethesda.
---
in terms of numbers, response times, and magnitude, there hasn't been an excuse anyone could make beyond laziness and lethargy for a long time.
---
they chose to use an outdated engine.  they chose to frankenstein multiplayer onto it.  they chose to run the game with a skeleton crew of QA and testing.
---
take a look at any other comparable online game... and there's no excuse.  under the same publisher umbrella they have the studio that has been working on elder scrolls online for years, and they could have collaborated.  but they didn't.  they could have hired in help with more netcode experience, but they didn't.
---
i enjoy fallout 76, but on the bug front it is a positive garbage fire and NOT directly blaming bethesda is part of the problem.
---
exploiters and dupers and etc are garbage people, but at the end of the day, we didn't pay them to give us a stable gaming experience.  we paid bethesda for that, and wanting the bare minimum of effort does not make those of us who want more bugs fixed more often, and less new bugs to show up, the bad guys.
---
yep and still gated. I can work on 4 and 5 ... I started but they are still gated and repeating the same content to get there was old the first time.
---
It bothers me that they explode, period. It makes looting pretty frustrating at times, but the extra damage is definitely worth it.
---
I know there is an other daily with take a picture in Adventure mode.
---
But this one is NW: Use fotomode to take a picture.
---
That's why I'm asking here
---
If we could only get some interesting raids, marketplace, real endgame content. FO76 lacks so many basic features of an MMO. This game does not even offer real grind. What are you grinding for? A fucking lunchbox or new wallpaper for your postapocalyptic SIMS house. After reaching like level 70 there is nothing new to the game. You have done all quests at least once, you can't make your character stronger, because you maxed out SPECIAL, all your weapons are max level. You can only pray for a godroll in purveyor. I love this game, but it's not an actual MMO, compared to SW:TOR, Tera, WOW or any other MMO this game just lacks content or any real reason to keep the grind going.
---
I've not played in a while, I started the season yesterday and got the ammo converter today, I was quite looking forward to it, but the amount of clicking and time to even just convert the ammo made it a total waste of time.. I quit after that, even things to help you are grindy..
---
Level 101 (yes love the sneaky easter egg) and I don't use the power armor. Love it, but it's not helping my stealth character. On the other side, I have a black excavator in the shop for killing the queen.
---
I believe so, its a weird mess, it says when adventuring alone so if you're alone in a team then technically you're alone, but since you are technically in a team you get herd mentality. My assumption
---
This event...What a corker üé©!
---
They can be reasily epaired. It only needs one, maybe 2 people to cover the ghouls, everyone else should collect ore.
---
I have revived many at the scorched beast queen event.
---
Oh I think I get it, they have to first buy everything out of my vendor then they might get access to my stash? I had some asshole try that after I told him his trap camp was trash. Him and his buddy bought all of my stuff for 12k but they didn't get access to my stash.
---
I don't know, man. The Brotherhood doesn't seem too keen on mutants
---
No no, 299 infused soot flower tea and 1 mirv grenade plan
---
Yea that's it lol. Then it's just a bug I guess because it's for adventure mode but shown as NW challenge
---
You should be able to get double that amount from a run out of Lucky Hole Mine. If you‚Äôre on PS4 I can show you the go to spots.
---
&gt;Then why in Atom's radioactive ball sack are you here on this sub reddit if you don't like multiplayer games? Fallout 76 isn't a game you enjoy. Doesn't make the game bad. Nor does it magically mean all other FO games will be this style of game. 
---
&gt;People like you need to get the fuck over yourselves when you pretend like you are the only source for what is and isn't a good game and demand every game conform to your desires. You are not video game god and you do not get to dictate everything.
---
Because this is a Fallout subreddit and I'm allowed to discuss fallout games here? It would be much more absurd if I showed up in a baking subreddit to talk about fallout, no? 
---
There are good games that I don't enjoy. This is not one of them. This is a bad game. If you don't like hearing opinions on the game in the sub for that game, I think you should take your own advice and get the fuck over yourself. 
---
&gt;Which only comes out a year or two after the game's official support is done which means the company made all the money they could off the base game and DLC sales and now are simply trying to get as much money out of the franchise as possible. Many game companies will do this with games were they will offer a GOTY edition and/or reduce the price of the base game and often offer massive discounts on the DLC that they wouldn't have offered when it was new. 
---
&gt;However FO4 has been the same since Aug 2016. No new content will ever be released by Bethesda for that game. 76 however will continue to recive content updates for years. GTA Online has been getting content updates for around 6 years or so. So for the base price of the game you are looking at at least 6 years of free game content. All for the price of the base game which isn't even full price anymore.
---
&gt;‚Äã
---
&gt;You might as well be complaining about why your console is a one time $500 payment but your car insurance needs to be paid every month. That is how little you actually understand what you are comparing.
---
I never asked them to update the game. I liked the game then, still do now. And again you seem to make this grand point about free content. If you need to subscribe to PSN to play the base game, then it is not free. It comes at a financial cost. I already paid for the game, don't make me pay again. 
---
And your analogy is shit. A more accurate analogy would be you pay your car insurance for the year, but then you gotta pay another $9.99/ month key fee if you want to start the engine. 
---
&gt;
---
Unlimited breadsticks at Olive Garden is amazing. It is like the only reason to actually go there. That said it also shows how little you fucking understand what you are talking about when you try to hint that there has barely been any work done. Then again by the logic you have shown so far you clearly haven't played the game so you are talking out of your ass. 
---
This, I should have read first. Anyone excited about unlimited shitty bread makes me wonder. Do you drive to work? Or like, does somebody drop you off? Know what I mean? 
---
Its fluff, it's filler, and it's cheap. Just like these free updates. This shows just how little you fucking understand what you're taking about. I have played the game plenty. I'm playing this game plenty, and its the most frustrating fallout experience of all time. If they don't go back to the style of game they used to give us, don't worry, this will be as far as Fallout and I go. 
---
Best part of Olive Garden is the breadsticks? You're an embarrassment.
---
My answers aren't here for you to correct.
---
Surprised no one in the thread has mentioned how good he is for chems. Steady supply of all the mentats even berry. If you‚Äôre a junkie build or trying to get exp quickly for SCORE the chems/alcohol option is amazing.
---
The story of Fallout on Wikipedia literally says Bethesda bought all the rights for Fallout to make Fallout 1, 2, 3, a spin off NV, Fallout 4 and finally a "Fallout MMO" (Fo76). It is a MMO, for god's sake, the name itself says all, Massive Multiplayer Online, that's literally what it is, it is also more keen to MMORPG since it has aspects of roleplaying, people pretending to be responders or clowns, whatnot, your character's choices make it unique and give it a unique storyline (just different dialogues), but still falls in the mmorpg category, that's what they are aiming for at least, but projects like F76, Gta Online or Red dead online are purposely made to start empty and very slowly add content to keep played hooked for a decade, like GtaO has been doing it and most other mmorpgs for pc, but gamers are the most impatient people ever. It doesn't matters if Bethesda or Rockstar drops a huge, huuuge update, because hardcore grinders will literally find a way to finish it under days and then continue complaining, and they are the loudest. The Runescape community is just an example of such grinders or behavior
---
I'm here, sorry for the wait
---
Personally I miss actual unique weapons with their fun gimmick. 
---
In Fallout 3 a lot of weapons had a special effect like either extended mags or high headshot damage.
---
In Fallout: New Vegas they extended this gimmick with the weapons especially with GRA Arsenal weapons.
---
I've actually done it on both mine. I'm buying stuff for bullion as I get it but I'm not actually grinding for it. I have a commando character and buy an,armor piece as soon as I roll a useable piece from the last one I bought and I have a,heavy weapons PA character that I buy stuff when I get it. I played the game just fine before this stuff I'm in no hurry to grind myself into the ground. Although the gauss mini gun is well worth it lol.
---
You just have to get max rep with the settlers (as far as i know)
---
It's not an energy weapon. I used an energy weapon bobblehead and it had no effect.
---
No problem, ill be chilling at your camp. Sick camp by the way, i‚Äôve never seen someone do what you did making a spiral staircase.
---
no no
---
nobody sells anything good at their vendors
---
I thought I went down all the tunnels and the hidden cultist shrine one with waterfall. I know i clicked on at least 4 nods in each of the small off shoot sections...and then maybe another 10 from the tunnels and the rat tunnels. Ill have to wait and try to run it again.
---
None of this is correct. They were the FO First item of the month when Wastelanders came out. They came together as part of the sub.
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4xDbvsrsB36UztPiNmDbBM/atomic-shop-weekly-update-april-14-21](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4xDbvsrsB36UztPiNmDbBM/atomic-shop-weekly-update-april-14-21)
---
Yes! They were trying to rob you, but it doesn't always work. The 2 30k pies are just insurance. It only works by taking advantage of server load issues so in that case you just got 12k caps and they got extra salt.
---
So there is a chance that the BoS show up and say, "Thanks, but we are building our base at a different location."?
---
Agreed!  Do all that crappy work gathering stuff for them, and for what?   A hat and an outfit?   Screw that.
---
i feel like that might be a personal problem?  
---
it might just be some of your sliders in character creation.  at least on my model, it looks fine.  can't remember what you can adjust where and if you can revisit it at all, but if you can, it might pay to adjust something a little.
---
on my main (which is my dress up character) i only adjusted the face.  didn't mess with body size or anything else.  i'll toss it onto sophia when i get on for the day and see if it looks wonky on her.
---
Milk drinkers these days i tell youü§£
---
And knowing Bethesda, we'll have to turn in the materials one piece of scrap at a time with a lag spike in between each
---
Thanks man, I spent a fair amount of time on it. Had to put the stairs outback to hold the floor up haha
---
I don't.
---
but the number of people crying about it do.
---
Fun PvP to me would be both of us level 7 with pipe pistols. Only skill and luck will win.
---
You can buy fully modded PAs from players if you aren't into farming flux.
---
Did you have it and it disappeared? I have one so they didn‚Äôt eliminate it...
---
How dare you go against the grain?! Bethesda is literally ISIS, Todd Howard is literally Dick Cheney, FO76 is literally the worst game ever created. This game **would**be good if the developers would stop dicking off on Reddit and do a good job for once. 
---
Listen, after putting in 1500 hours this month I just think it‚Äôs fucked that I notice things the average player doesn‚Äôt care about. I‚Äôve just reached lvl 800, and I expect to be a god but no, Todd is what‚Äôs fucking me over. What a shit product. -10/10, would not bang. /s
---
[yeah, I‚Äôve really been wanting to ask everyone here ‚Äúdo y‚Äôall even like this game? Like, at all?‚Äù TBH, IDK.]
---
Did they fix the Retirement Plan glitch? It wasn‚Äôt working for me
---
If nothing else when you are PAYING a sub fee some of these limits should be increased.
---
Honestly same. The only *unique* unique we have is the fixer. The rest of the uniques just have a unique name and maybe a weird set of legendary effects
---
How long did it take you to ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù the game?
---
Lol Definitely worth it, your camp looks great. But thanks a bunch for the extra hooks, you‚Äôre awesome! üôè
---
Cam we get the original Ring of Fire instead of the cover? The cover they did for Take Me Home, Country Roads arguably sounds better than the original, but the Ring of Fire cover sounds like its trying too hard to be a rock song
---
Hmm I just hopped on but it was just to check my mule and then I gotta take care of some stuff but I can meet up with you another day if you are still looking for stuff.
---
I have a bloodied explosive lmg and a bloodied explosive minigun in the good tier.
---
2 Bloodied Ultracite Gatling Guns in the mid tier one is +40% bashing, the other is +33% hit chance
---
And two Bloodied Broadsiders one is +10% aiming +1 perception so its a bit of a curiosity piece, the other +33% vats hit chance
---
You could have the hit chance broadsider for free i just haven't needed to script it yet so its hanging around.
---
With any type of bloodied, id recomend sneak to go along side it. Unless your resistance is really good.
---
I never knew who was behind these pics but I will definitely put a few up on every base I make.thank you Galen.RIP
---
Happy to help, enjoy!
---
I had spent half an hour powering and protecting the Rockhound when some asshole claimed the workshop and kept annihilating me whenever I tried to take it back.
---
I waited until the event was about to end, took the elevator to the top of the Rockhound, jumped off the top and bolted it to the ore hopper, picked the lock, took everything I'd mined, fast travelled to my base and placed it in my stash.
---
I then went to another workshop I had and the asshole appeared, claimed the base, destroyed everything I'd built then left.
---
Dude what would you take for the be lmg, I wont be able to do it today but for future, I am extremely interested, and if there is a day that you can get on before 3pm your time, send me a message
---
You are trying to set yourself aside from what you see as the majority of the player base. You affirmed that you think bloodied builds are the only reliable damage build. You could do it, but the fact that you dont and feel the need to try and slander people who do shows that it's not about the build. You want validation. As I said, you're not special. 
---
"Ohhhhh, he had one sentence in a completely unrelated post about being bloodied. Better go insult him!" ~ You for some reason.
---
Why do you have a chip on your shoulder?
---
have you ever selected it while leveling up?
---
Glad it worked!
---
The Enclave should send some people since the previous team is now a pile of skeletons in resort dumpsters.
---
I've had the wanderer in my camp for a while and every daily was to get the weapons case, then this week it changed to going to rescue her friend.  I hate it because this quest never gives a legendary, I miss getting one per day.
---
Property is theft.
---
I think its so people actually play the game to get the OP weapons and armor rather than having someone 150 levels higher than them give it to them straight from Vault 76. Its annoying, but I think its understandable.
---
Auto nukes were from the PTS. But expect to see that area constantly hit when it does release.
---
it should be available in the list when youre spending a level..
---
if you never picked it before or never got it in a perk pack it wont show unless youre choosing a perk while spending a level
---
I just grind the stupid score and log off as soon as I'm done. This score system is shit and not fun. Honestly the game hasn't been fun since I learned Wastelanders doesn't allow team mates to have any impact/role in deciding things. It's just a useless grind now.
---
I have a 3 star and a 2 star so no, it's still there
---
I want nothing more than to rub a big ol' magnet all over that MODUS server.
---
BOS ultracite cork gattling gun.... I needs one
---
It's considered a ballistic weapon, shotgun perks and demolition expert perk works with it. (It has a built-in explosive effect). Grounded mutation doesn't affect it
---
Your cookies are probably drugged, Ad fucking Victorium
---
oof... and thats brutal in of itself
---
 Raids? 
---
Check
---
 Dungeons? 
---
 Party composition?  Classes?  An actual endgame? 
---
Check check and check
---
Did you use the power armor that increases the amount of ore your getting?
---
The person has to die from combat damage.  I have tried other ways when helping people out and it doesn't work.  Last time I just stood still and let mirelurks kill me so the person could revive me.
---
The best place to get a random is Dcorched Earth or Encrypted
---
I don't mind the timegating. I have fun doing dailies, scrounging the wasteland, looking for unknown plans, etc etc while I wait. I do understand your frustration though
---
He gets me a variety..nothing crazy usually 20 to 50 rounds of 308,45,44 and 5.56 but I only collect every so often.if I had this as a new player it would of helped alot.the guns it gets are good for scrapping and learning new mods
---
Thank you for actually giving a reasonable explanation and not just trashing Betheada about BoS for no good reason
---
You don't need to finish "I am become death". Just the wastelanders main story where you raid the vault for bullion. Then reach max rep with settlers.
---
Follow low level players around. 
---
Go to encrypted. 
---
Either one of those should net you plenty of downed players.
---
.44 is my main weapon. I use it for most stuff.  What it can't handle,  my two shot AGL can.
---
It unlocks at level 50 so if you have more than 86 unused perk points you won't see it.
---
Spending the past month going for unyielding secret service armor killed it for me.  3 rolls a day for, I can‚Äôt remember how many days now.  One piece of a crappy rolled chest piece.  Ridiculous
---
No one forgot
---
If I recall, any items you don‚Äôt have unlocked can‚Äôt be placed unfortunately.
---
This is the only way to get something good and unique. If it‚Äôs something like Crushing Blow, well its value blows because everyone plays the game has it. There‚Äôs zero unique quality about guaranteed rewards and they are essentially only worth a few scrips. Earn the gold/plan, get the modules, and try your luck, many hate hard work but this is the only way to land you something of unique value.
---
Well they do become quite fascist in later games (sees sentient ghouls as abominations) so are you really surprised? The enclave is not any better though but at least they don't pretend to be the good guys.
---
Or when someones on a fence or tent at scorched earth so the queen won't land üñï
---
August 4th patch I believe
---
Oddly I would say the same but I got a troubleshooters fixer from becket only a 2 star but it happend.
---
It'll just be some cover that no one cares to much for
---
I am still pissed off the Welcome Mat was removed from the Beta because people were using it to get out of the map. Guess what, every other time I fast travel to my camp I fall out of the map because I CANT change my spawn point.
---
What were the raids
---
I would play more without the silly time gates
---
My generators always get blown up at Bogtown and Dabney if I wait for retakes so it was just to save a few materials.
---
Out of curiosity, are they mainly complaining about similar things?
---
Why don't they just disconnect the power? Problem solved.
---
Yes please for the love of god.
---
Most, if not all, updates have been on Tuesdays. Just expect Tuesday, if it drops tomorrow...pleasant surprise.
---
I use power armour in radiation zones just for the radiation protection, otherwise unyielding heavy combat armor (which I stay in if I can avoid radiation during queen event).
---
I hear you it uses same loot pool that was in faschnaut parade seems like everything is on the table so long as you know the plans
---
Is only in the PTS. For everyone else, 4th of august. That's when patch 21 releases.
---
The Gutter should have had a plan. It also has a unique effect but we can't get it as a legendary. Shame. Same with Meteoric Sword that had 3 Legendary effects but wasn't an actual Legendary.
---
Today while I was playing someone already nuked and queen fight was already done but ppl where still down there. Well when the nuke zone is active I go down to check. I haven‚Äôt had it spawn there any of those times. I have fought it now 4 times tho. 3 times after nukes and today. I went down and noticed that guys had led it to the bunker. We all worked it and killed about 3 scorch beast in that time and finally beat it. That was the first time I fought it outside of the nuke Zone. Took me and a guy forever to find the body tho. Then I found it and it was plasma goo but if you looked at it through camera or walking by it just said wendigo not the colossus. But we got our loot. I‚Äôve also went down there before and just found dead bodies of it. After all nukes I‚Äôve been in I‚Äôve only seen it and fought it 4 times. And I play everyday
---
It said August 3rd on the roadmap. But you're right.
---
With excavator armor I was able to get around 1000 scrap after smelting
---
Is that the my adding failure for the golf balls in the white springs club house or on bags of concrete? 
---
:-P One day I will learn to slow down and avoid simple errors.
---
Nah it's just a stupid argument to say it's in the ToS when you probably owe at least a leg and your first born considering how many hundreds of thousands of TOS pages people haven't read in their lifetime.
---
What, you think a 7 foot tall steel exoskeleton weighs just 10 pounds? 
---
It's *always* been cork.
---
While I have no direct game development experience, my day job is software development related. 
---
This entire sub and community really confuses AND amazes me. 
---
I spend all day figuring out ways to get people to do stuff in my software, this sub and FO76 are exact opposites because the community takes all new content and burns through it as if on a dare. 
---
So, I‚Äôm a sense, Bethesda‚Äôs job is to figure out how to throttle high level players and I get it. with all of the production work, testing, writing, art, development, marketing that goes into dropping new content, I bet they can barely keep up with player demand. 
---
If they suddenly released a new quest line where  part of it involved copying VHS tape art from the last blockbuster on earth at a local kinkos location I‚Äôm sure a significant amount of people would have made a ton of progress on the line because players are that persistent and good
---
Calm down Satan
---
Does it really silence it though, like gameplay-wise?  I'd be happy with a good "thump" sound, more than the tapping sound we have.
---
Well I‚Äôm glad then. Here‚Äôs hoping I don‚Äôt get stupid mutant knifes and I get the god roll of a life time. Shit I was happy when I got the 3 star bloodied cyro the other night. Actually I think I got my 2 star combat bloodied rifle from one of them. So they where the best two I got
---
Which still has nothing to do with the FO4 Brotherhood vendor‚Äôs explicitly off-the-books missions involving the farms 2 centuries into the future.
---
Cmon people, details matter.
---
Don‚Äôt forget that protectron
---
Lmao. I love my Gatling Gun it's my main gun so i have the machine making 5mm non-stop. If he needed it that bad he can have it its no big deal to me
---
But I just wanted to help :c
---
Excavator is great for dealing with Carry Weight.  It only weighs 10 pounds in your inventory, has a set bonus of increasing carry weight by 100 pounds, and can get an additional carry weight of 100 pounds with the Calibrated Shocks mod.  So anytime you are overcumbered with loot, then just get into the Excavator and fast travel to the nearest vendor or crafting bench.
---
I haven't even touched FO76 since seasons launched. Knowing I'd have yet another extra thing to grind for which is gated behind a set amount of time turned me off.
---
That bloodied  combat rifle is fun to use.modded mine w scorched  reciver and it melts..good luck now
---
Yeah but their MMOs, this game is no way near a MMO not even close. MMO are known for their tedious grinds. Fallout has no place for it.
---
You brought up the fact that the 76 BoS is a different chapter, so I emphasized my original point with this chapter. Correct that my statement didn‚Äôt involve FO4, because the original point wasn‚Äôt dedicated to just 4
---
I think that would be an amazing twist lol but I think the BoS confirmed they were going to Atlas, or at least that is their touchdown point which I assume would mean they would stay there as they wouldn‚Äôt want to leave behind any of their limited supplies once they arrive.
---
I‚Äôm also assuming the fanboy knows more than we do, as he seemed to be working at Atlas before the radio transmissions were released. He probably can‚Äôt communicate with them, but may have access to many of their broadcasts. 
---
I have too much free time...
---
I am extremely interested about the lmg, and would like to know if you would take a bundle of a level 40 bloodied faster fire rate hunting rifle, Lvl 40 or 45 bloodied lever action with 10% damage while aiming and possibly a lvl 45 furious faster fire rate faster reload minigun. I wont be able to trade today but I can any day that you will be online before 3pm your time
---
the only thing i wanted was the ammo convertor. Everything else just a waste of time
---
I‚Äôve just been playing stellaris, have all the DLC and there‚Äôs so much role play I can do
---
I got the Mozaic Tiles as soon as I saw them, they blend in well with my Moonshining room with the Nukashine Wallpaper.
---
But even that is tedious, but apprantly a fix is coming
---
Concrete i was playing around dont take me seriously
---
SCORE has killed a character for me. The dailies in NW would give you perk cards. Now you get score. What happens is that it now takes forever to get new perks where it used to be easier to get those perk points. Low level progression now is awful. Their inclusion in SCORE cuts both ways.
---
This is actually incredibly sad.
---
So I just did it last night and even tho I‚Äôve played since beta I used melee mainly. But now I use guns I got over 1k lead first time as I use excavator gives 4x then use max super duper and get double. Last night I put 890 in but I know I missed some and some wouldn‚Äôt give any
---
Yeah I can get on most days before that time. I have a list of items I want around here somewhere I will track it down and pm it to you to see if you have anything on it. I am sure we can work something out.
---
If you want to move your camp it‚Äôll make blueprints for you and it should appear under stored, if you have big structures it‚Äôll try to fit everything in one if not, it‚Äôll split it up.
---
I've just been slowly working towards the jetpack since that is the only thing to add functionality to my main character, buying bullion when i pass by foundation, i don't really need a full set of ss armor, the combat armor i have has most of the things i need and the stealth suit makes it easy to cheese what ever the combat armor can't tank, and that's not a great many things.  
---
I also gave up on rep farming, i'd be more ok with it if there were 3 or 4 dailies you could do, but the single drop in the bucket every day just does not do it for me, i have no real need for fertilizer grenades since i don't plant crops, and i have 0 issues crafting ammo.
---
We have the fixer for starters
---
My budget is almost full so what do you mean by split it up ?
---
5hat sounds like something they should make sure can not be done
---
I constantly get followed by scorchbeast corpses that I have killed, even a SBQ a few times and let me say, that is a BIG corpse üòÇ
---
I‚Äôm at a point where I can store my bad rolls so I end up dropping them, which deletes them and I just move on. But with trading it would just go to the next person. And the broken weapons will just cycle around. Or people will just spend a short bit of time crafting. I agree, what they are doing is lazy and isn‚Äôt going to stop everyone from getting it, all be it eventually, but only slowing it.
---
Good to know, I'll toss my two pies in there at 30k. I ran into the guy later on and thanked him for making me 12k richer. He was salty and said he dropped all my stuff off on the ground. I told him I don't care, I got what I wanted, caps. Thanks for the tip!
---
Did you also see the blood eagle handmade skin? The suppressor is so badly textured just like the gold skin, a six grader with basic 3D modeling knowledge can fix it. Just unbe-effing-lievable for a big ass company like this.
---
And The Gutter, used to have Meteoric Sword too, but that's it.
---
So blueprints have a certain amount of budget and if it exceeds that amount another blueprint would be made to fit whatever was left out
---
last i tried it worked, but i also have not gotten that particular daily in two weeks, then again i don't check every day.
---
I know right
---
You just need to sever hop. The fact they aren't there means someone has already come by and taken it.
---
RDR sub has the most similar routine complainers.
---
GTA and COD subs have these people too but the most common complaints are about hackers especially on PC.
---
That's not true. There's a bunch of Atomic Shop items that are bugged and can be placed in other people's camps (don't ask me why). Even on camps where the owner doesn't have them.
---
And as I said, the pennant and the diploma (which both were rewards from the same NW event than the stash I'm asking for) are bugged as well. I know because I placed a few in a friend's camp, and he didn't have any of those rewards unlocked (he didn't even have the game by that time lol).
---
Why would him dropping insult you? Like "bro, I was selling it, clearly I don't give a fuck what you do with it."
---
Sorry my bad it's called butchers bounty and it's in perception.
---
Well said.  I've lost complete interest in this crap as well for every single reason you've listed here.
---
https://odealo.com/articles/fallout-76-power-armor-locations-an-in-depth-guide
---
&gt; If we could only get some interesting raids 
---
There was raids and they were removed due to lack of people doing them. Based on most of the complaint's I've seen it is because they were demanding a 30 cap return on every 1 cap spent on the raid. 
---
&gt; real endgame content. 
---
Same end game content as any other MMO. Doing the same content over and over again to get those rare drops. While waiting desperatly for the new content to drop so you finally have something new to do.
---
That‚Äôs generally only for the atom shop and season, and even then sometimes you can. I know for a fact that you can place the log loveseat, ring of fire pit, and antler chandelier from the last NW challenges in other camps.
---
I'm told that the queen won't land because someone is staggering her in the air
---
You do realize you can be an MMO ARPG right?
---
There are several locations around where the ore does not stick out obviously. 
---
In the main tunnel each of the offshoot dead end tunnels has 3-6 ores, most are hidden in corners, a couple in the ceiling, a few in the minecarts, and a few are just brown without the normal black to give their position away (stealth ores).
---
Once you get down to the water pools there is one that is rimmed with lead ore along the inner edge right at the edge of the water, there are about 5 or so, as well as a few more stealthy ones in the wall. 
---
When looking in the secret and side tunnels make sure to check both walls thoroughly from both directions, a lot of the ore is positioned in such a way they are super easy to miss when traveling from one direction instead of the other and have the stealthy all brown color.
---
It should be possible to get at least 250 ore from the place, more with good luck as you can often harvest ores more than once if you spam harvest quickly.
---
I never got the diploma, did they lock that back up? I got the holiday rewards.
---
I thought that too but I went into private and still can't find any.
---
Its... hard to explain lol
---
I can only guess they don't want people to play all the time. Maybe its a server thing.. But the amount of time gates in this title is unreal. Once you hit your daily limit it just drags and I lose interest. 
---
Side note: three currencies is annoying. If they are trying to stop cheaters.. Its not working obviously. Just unlock them and let us play.
---
You're making my teeth itch
---
Otherwise some other locations are Solomons pond, an unmarked (booby trapped) shed in front of the mama dolces plant, its a short walk from the morgantown trainyard, WV lumber plant at the top left of the map, Garrahan mining co (watch out for the scorchbeast)
---
Yep, you can place all those items as well.
---
I did not know that, that's pretty awesome
---
Bro it do be like this everysingle time I'm done with the daily stuff , scrip, quests, etc it just turns into a junk run to get materials I'm running out of for ammo or it turns into a vendor server hoping until I get something decent in the player vendors ..... I hope the Brotherhood quests coming up bring some spark back to the game
---
Bind on Pickup (BoP) isn‚Äôt a new concept.
---
Please you already had me at reject the BOS
---
&gt;You could do it, but the fact that you dont
---
I've been playing this game since beta. I have tried bloodied.
---
&gt;it's not about the build.
---
It 100% is about the build, wtf are you on about?
---
There is **no other game like this where literally one build dominates all**. Bethesda have fucked up big time when it comes to balancing in this game. Patches take months to come out, changes take even longer. Certain legendary effects have been bugged and giving absurd "magic" damage for over a year and nothing has been done about it.
---
I don't get how you could possibly be against the idea of **balancing the damn game** to remove this overwhelming bloodied meta. It would objectively make the game better.
---
If your endgame ends up with every player going for the **exact same build**, you've designed your game badly.
---
All our player characters are using power armor, we have all been since entering the game. Once you reach level 999 the game explains to you that your entire experience playing Fallout 76 has been a lucid hallucination caused by starvation from being trapped inside some power armor. The screen fades to black and then............. "Hey you, your finally awake"
---
I haven't been on any private worlds but from what I've read they aren't servers but are instead instances.
---
Server hopping is more reliable.
---
I'm not in the loop, what's with all this talk of the bos junk thing? Especially the cork I don't get it
---
Disable the 590 before you play the game
---
Edit: I only know now that you can use two different gpu from different companies on a single pc.
---
I would use it every time i get a trade invitation
---
I'm quite sure you can still place them.
---
Some people are weird. He thought that pixels would matter to me if I knew they went to waste. He honestly probably put them in his vendor.
---
Also the fact that each power armor piece has a 7% resistance to all damage. So you may have 600 dr and er but power armor players that have half the dr and er than you take a bit less damage
---
Or perhaps be lucky enough to find someone dropping them. I do that myself when i have extra frames i dont need.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and have 2 on display the other two I ever got I scrapped but I got two big nuts on display
---
They are building a gigantic ark so next time when there‚Äôs a global flood they have a floating vault, with a pair of each glowing species too.
---
Have you ever heard of the Brotherhood of Steel being referred to as uptight? Think about it....
---
The faction vendor presence always struck me as something done solely for player convenience, consolidating all of their inventories into one building. The Vendorbots are entirely static and do not interact with the player like every other vendor does. I suppose what you say could be true, but I find it hard to believe that the Responders, Raiders, Brotherhood, and Free States would tolerate one another's presences.
---
Honestly I really want Bethesda to clear up why caps are being used as currency at this point in the timeline in this region. Technically the Hub was founded in 2093 according to the wiki, and we don't know exactly when the town garnered enough influence to begin to back caps as currency. I somehow doubt that their traders would have reached West Virginia before 2102, so that line of thought which could excuse Fallout 3 and 4 (to a limited extent) can't really be applied to 76.
---
While I agree that the Whitesprings reasoning would make the most sense at this point (regardless of how incredibly stupid it is), aside from a couple of notes/holotapes explaining why the vendors would accept caps there are almost no references to the place by the other factions. If it is the center of the entire Appalachian economy then why does no one talk about it at any point? 
---
...and don't even get me started on how badly they fucked up in Wastelanders  when they had us use the Kanawha Nuka-Cola Plant.
---
Watoga has 5 locations.
---
Then why don‚Äôt they have it listed as such on wiki? because it isn‚Äôt. Idk why it matters, even if it WAS an MMO, it would be the least MMO-like MMO of all MMOs lol
---
look at any other actual MMO‚Äôs wiki. It clearly says MMO in black and white
---
I will take a look and if not would you take anything thats not on the list?
---
The fixer isn‚Äôt unique
---
If you kill her mother, she leaves to bury her with her father in the Capital Wasteland. She leaves a holotape, "Jen's Goodbye," in her room. If you side with Crater she disappears with no explanation or holotape, regardless of your choice.
---
The only way to get her to stay is convincing her mother to live and siding with Foundation, in which case they will both be in Foundation and "Jen's Goodbye" will be "Jen's Journal, pt. 1" instead.
---
Don't really know, but I guess some Skyrim player would. Ask google how they did it?
---
This is from 3 months ago, fuck
---
I usually get around 400 ore with excavator on so I think you did something wring
---
In terms of looks and effects it is but apart from that, yeah, it's basically standard
---
Just run to overseer camp craft 1 weapon 1 armor and 1 throwing knife. Go into wayward(or however it was called) kill the guy and talk with douchess for easy lvl 3 repeat every day
---
I can't even be be bothered to get on an do my score challenges anymore
---
I found one in the munitions factory upstairs.  I also found one in the area where the Belching Betty is - in one of the buildings down there.
---
F for the cat. I will put some of them up in my camp. :(
---
Gambling is the end game
---
with how many people want either unlimited or a system like this , be nice if bethesda at least acknowledged they understand how players feel
---
What system are you on?
---
I'm just going for my steam achievements and then I'm done till they add more. I'm level 160 now and there is no reason to keep going. I got spoiled with a bloodied fixer on loan from a friend and a basic set of unyielding armor and I see no reason to grind out all the SS gear praying I get good pieces because there is no reason for me to do this shit. 
---
Why so I can kill the queen faster so I can farm her to....kill the queen faster? I already one shot nearly everything in the game as is. There is no point for me to get fully geared out. 
---
Don't make an mmo and have no fucking end game content. Jesus.
---
Every time I‚Äôve gone to lucky hole lately, a lot of the nodes seem to bug out. I can collect from them once and then it stops letting me mine that particular node, even though the node doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù.
---
You have to explain to me what you mean with "unique".
---
Unique as only one single item being in existence, or weapons with just one overpowered ability that kills everything?
---
It‚Äôs not always just the lower levels with garbage, I get so infuriated when it shows armour and it‚Äôs all outfits ü§£
---
Pretty solid idea; I'd mess with the Backpack passed on your current DR/ER/RR stats; if you're pushing over 400 DR/ER or 150 RR without a backpack, I'd probably just grab a utility backpack. 
---
Not even sure you'd need power armor unless you're having to fight in a rad zone. But if you get to that point just build up T-65, it has the best stats across the board.
---
I'd not suggest laser rifles unless Bethesda FINALLY gets around to that major combat rebalance they've been talking about. Currently energy rifles are pretty trash, have been since launch (they're a bit better than launch, but still well below Ballistics across the board).
---
I forgot about watoga. Thank you
---
Not really... in that case every weapon is unique because they all look different and have different mods/damages/firerate etc
---
I think though i cannot confirm that one also spawns in the Fujiniya outpost/intelligence center that's connected to the mama dolces plant may have one.
---
Final Word, Sword of Bastet, asf
---
There are loads more of those in the game.
---
Or 50 turbo ferts which show up on map as weapons xd
---
It's a hard thing to balance; some people run vendor mule accounts. My vendor mule started selling at level 50ish, but he's got some very nice items, and it's 60/60 armor/weapons. He's now 85 from shared group quest XP. Some people have vendor mules that're basically level 1.
---
I once had him stuck at the Ash Heap for several minutes in front of the Charleston FD, then decided to walk towards the Charleston station and he suddenly began moving. My guess is that he detected that I moved further along the route and resumed movement... or something of the sort.
---
I will make my Enclave character when they release an Enclave paint job for PA, also, where the hell is the Enclave PA that was datamined? We wants it, precious, we wants it, yes!
---
It took place in vault 94,  there were 3 missions that cycled once a week, and 3 difficulties.  You could do each difficulty once per day for rewards (tons of aid/ammo mats and vault 94 steel/plans for solar, thorn, and strangler sets)
---
Each mission had you doing tasks/puzzles to continue each room (4-5 rooms), with a "boss/horde" room at the end to deal with.  
---
- Novice difficulty had no time limit, and rewarded the least rewards, 3 vault steel, and no plans.  
---
- Standard had a timer, rewarded middle road for items, gave V94 armor plans, 4 vault steel and a V94 jumpsuit.
---
- expert had half the time as standard, gave the most items, rewarded v94 armor plans, 5 vault steel and gave a V94 scout mask
---
Love my 3 * instigating gamma gun
---
Put the game on the display plugged into the 1070
---
I can't remember the name of the unique 10mm SMG but yeah, we've had a few with unique effects but they never see the sunlight. If you could use modules to craft uniques with additional standard effects itwould be great
---
You need to think like a Bethesda developer. Ask them to add a bean bag chair as a camp item.
---
Then you will get your zombie insects!
---
**A group where everyone angry reacts corn**
---
What are their levels (and how many)?
---
I mean it has a unique skin. Like the unique weapons from NV yaknow?
---
Unique in the other games was often special variants of normal guns, with boosted stats in one area or another. Some were actually unique, like the alien blaster. Stuff like the Ratslayer from FO:NV was a fully modded unique version of the varmint rifle, that I believe had some unique stats beyond being fully modded.
---
Final Word technically isn't a unique since you can roll those effects on a drop just a rare drop, VATS Unknown is unique though
---
Well I was just trying it to see. Didn't have a strategy in mind. I'll give that a shot if I happen to feel lazy again with that challenge.
---
I know but it's not needed, this game is easy and I rarely die when I melt through 90% of enemies.
---
Your welcomeüòÅ
---
But like I said, if you consider it unique because it has a ‚Äúunique skin,‚Äù that makes every weapon in the game unique
---
I cant 'disable' the card? 
---
And it works fine in any other workloads except this game which defaults to the 590
---
Awh bruh I never encountered this
---
Both displays are output from the 1070.
---
I'm doubtful you'll get those prices for it. 10mm sub has issues in that it has no muzzle or scope mods- so no silencer is a HUGE loss, and no reflex sight is a significant negative as well.
---
The gun also has a fair amount of recoil for what it is. The large mag size is kind of nice though.
---
This is a fact
---
Add me Vault310 I'll give you the plan for free I have a spare.
---
Standard bloody HW build.
---
A unique variant then
---
I do it when i dont have time for my main
---
Unless they've patched, this should be working, ahha.  After being fooled by this once, now I throw some in my vendors to make my 8 guns look like its 15 sometimes xd
---
If you can't beat em...
---
I wouldn‚Äôt pay that for it, but it is a nice weapon.
---
I use a Vamp SMG for tagging at events  like uranium fever.  Has kill power when you need it, otherwise, get you tag on the legendaries and step back for others to get theirs.  Easily takes out the plain L40s while keeping your health up (although I have glowsight3, which helps)
---
Oh totally agree, it‚Äôs hard to side with any of the factions bc they all kind of have their shortcomings. But brotherhoods demand for scrap is kinda bs
---
This is not something related to mobile games, it is related to mmos. EVERY mmo is time gated. Raids can be done only once a week, hard instances once a day, and so on. Everything to slow down the progression of players who can play all day long. 
---
I dont like it, but it is needed. Yes of course, the best thing would be to have infinite, awesome, handmade content for playing 16 hours each day. But that is not possible. They have to limit the progress so players dont have nothing to do after 2 weeks. Again, it is bad, but needed
---
I'm not against balance. You didnt say balance the game. You called someone out for one line of text in an unrelated post. You are also still talking about YOU. What does you having played since beta have to do with a post about pvp. You're not special. But if it means something to you, send me your build. I'll put it on the fridge by the finger paintings.
---
Ratslayer had a unique skin too, even had a tally of how many rats the previous user killed on the stock of the gun.
---
if you get the timing right, yeah, jumping right at landing cancels it. But then you're back in jumping, which may not be ideal.
---
I've heard timing a weapon reload (or maybe it's ready/hide weapon) will also cancel it, but I havn't tried that.
---
Sorry dude. That's really annoying. Submit a ticket to Bethesda.
---
O, thank you very much!
---
Fast travel to any event and then fast travel back. Works every time for me
---
&gt;Because this is a Fallout subreddit and I'm allowed to discuss fallout games here? It would be much more absurd if I showed up in a baking subreddit to talk about fallout, no?  
---
&gt;There are good games that I don't enjoy. This is not one of them. This is a bad game. If you don't like hearing opinions on the game in the sub for that game, I think you should take your own advice and get the fuck over yourself.
---
If you haven't played the game your opinion about it is invalid. And as you already stated you do not like multiplayer games this already makes your opinion bias. 
---
&gt; I never asked them to update the game.  
---
And yet you are still comparing to unlike things as if they are the same. Again comparing a one time payment for a game console to regular payments for car insurance and wondering why they are different.
---
&gt; This, I should have read first. Anyone excited about unlimited shitty  bread makes me wonder. Do you drive to work? Or like, does somebody drop  you off? Know what I mean? 
---
Ah more of that arrogant head up your own ass mentality of "I don't like this so everyone else must agree with more they are wrong"  Olive Garden is over priced shitty vaugly Italian food that I know of a dozen other better places to go. The only bonus is the unlimited breadsticks because they don't fuck that up or over charge it. 
---
&gt; Its fluff, it's filler, and it's cheap. Just like these free updates.  This shows just how little you fucking understand what you're taking  about. I have played the game plenty. I'm playing this game plenty, and  its the most frustrating fallout experience of all time. If they don't  go back to the style of game they used to give us, don't worry, this  will be as far as Fallout and I go. 
---
Please do go into detail how it is fluff and filler that is cheap. I want specifics.  Including development times, costs, team members, etc.
---
I do like to be high health so that would work well for me! Awesome üòÅ
---
This is perfect
---
Perfect Storm is technically unique until the add the rest of the legendary effects, fire damage is a 4 star effect. All Rise has +10 Health which is a 5 star effect
---
Lots of people are already done and they have said there is nothing new. You get the challenges but no score is earned anymore.
---
Damn ok, I was hoping to grind for rep a little longer cuz I wasn't how much I'd lose from the raiders for siding with settlers and then how much I'd lose from the settlers for keeping all the gold. Thanks!
---
Quite a few have cheated their way there weeks ago and a few have bought the levels, perhaps one will answer, if you're lucky :-)
---
Yes! In fact, I believe those are the skins we are getting with the new season legendary run:
---
Cork Power armor skins
---
Cork Armor skins
---
Cork weapons
---
Cork building set for our camps
---
Cork Allies...
---
The armor skins will (or should...) never be in NW.
---
Why? Because they're a limited time thing with this season. What if someone joins next season and can't get them, but previous players have this super high camo armor that new players can't get? That's not fair or balanced.
---
The outfit is somewhat balanced because you have zero armor with it on.
---
NW is the closest to balanced PVP this game has. Allowing the limited-time skins that are significant camo to be used would not be balanced
---
You keep misunderstanding the post as me thinking "my" build is better or special compared to bloodied. You don't understand the point at all.
---
It's just a random object that I've chosen. Not that's it's worth anything. Just shits and giggles.
---
So you don‚Äôt necessarily have to have a full set of one specific type to be effective? Good to know if so!
---
Yup or lately I‚Äôll get ghouls where you can loot them but I finally found a work around. If it doesn‚Äôt get up go over hit it it will get up but then freeze. Well then just keep bashing it and when the last life ticks mash pick up button and you will get but if you aren‚Äôt quick enough you won‚Äôt get it and it will disappear
---
you get banned
---
That‚Äôs why I hunt down the player icon before traveling to a vendor with 100+ plans to see if they I‚Äôm either getting workbench plans or mounted head plans, there isn‚Äôt a in between
---
 The hunting rifle skin does oddly enough.
---
yes if you play anything by the arctic monkeys or nirvana
---
Do you have a link to said bundle?
---
Ah, right on, thx for the tip. I might hang on to it then.
---
For a first run, it‚Äôs not too bad,  
---
Once you learn your way around, and with Excavator equipped, you should come out with about 600 lead ore, at least 150 crystal (not that you‚Äôll use that much), As well as Acid, black titanium, and other loot
---
Bethesda pls remove the westtek pie for the sake of the PPP Market!
---
(I don't actually care, I put pies at the end of a maze I built in my camp for free along with other rewards).

Yeah, I found most of the plans from those already, in paper bags dropped on the ground after and during the events.  Guess they're not so rare anymore, after recycling them through so many events.  The few that I didn't find in some way, I'm not interested in.  The only people who would benefit from them are new people from game pass.  Everyone else is just going through the motions for the same old crap.  I'll be logging in now and then to check progress, but won't likely be doing much to help with my 20 lbs of available stash...
---
I too would like to know the answer to this since it will affect my decision making - The fate of the world depends on the answer to this question.
---
Whoa there Goldilocks!
---
Pat on the back
---
This, try and favorite dark clothing of you have any and buy the sitting emote as well.
---
I play Zig and Zag the album, Chesney Hawkes or Gina G....
---
ah thanks for clearing this out!
---
No, I dont understand what anything you have brought up has to do with the original post. So from my point of view, it looks like you're just after attention. If you feel like the game needs a rebalanced, make a post about it. Dont start off by insulting someone on an unrelated thread then choose to pull out your soap box as justification for why you did it.
---
Yes, you get one per day after the initial quest. This is as it is supposed to be - the initial quest is basically an introduction to the ash heap dailies.
---
That's true. The cursed pickaxe that's soon to be coming could be classed as a 5 star, too, I think. I feel like they should have 4/5 stars on those weapons, even though they don't have 3 legendary effects already
---
It gets rid of the annoying buzzing sounds the rocket makes
---
Hmmm I wonder why? üßê
---
In that case even the original point is flawed. It wasn‚Äôt the Brotherhood doing anything at all with farms. It was an optional mission for a vendor.
---
Okay, thanks a lot, it just kind of seemed odd because I got two of them at once afterwards, I guess that was the only bug then \^\^
---
Yes...
---
.... yes?
---
I never knew about cork in Fallout 76 until now.
---
&gt; Bethesda wants us to collect billions of resources for a self entitled militaristic cult of thugs that only takes care of themselves. Fuck that
---
This was the original point. BoS is neutral good at best. They are selfish and are fine if their plans hurt other people so long as their intended goal is achieved
---
Example: Taking Rivet City‚Äôs Fusion Generator to power the Prydwen
---
E: let‚Äôs not forget racist (specists if you wanna be technical)
---
Play both till the end to reap the full rewards then take it all. If you side with one or the other it‚Äôll take awhile to grind on rep
---
Saving the shit out of this one. Well said as it encapsulates the exact mobile type of grind sentiments on this game,
---
Unyielding is great because there are so many perks and buffs for being at low health that it is worth it to not have high health.
---
With just serendipity perk the value of the last 30% of your health is as good as the first 60%
---
With nerd rage being at 20% health gives you a 20% damage multiplier, along with ap regen and some damage reduction. This is insanely good.
---
With those two perks being at 20% health is as good or better than being at 100% health without them.
---
With each piece of unyielding armor being at 20% gives you:
---
15 carry weight, 15% melee damage, 9% vats bonus, better prices, 6% more xp, more scrap from weapons/armor, 15 ap, 15% harder to detect, 15% critical hit generation, more durability on crafted/found items. 
---
That is an insane list of buffs, and you can get those bonuses 5! times.
---
Vanguards is awful on SS armor, the armor is more than enough armor you don't get much use out of the effect. going from 300 to 475 armor with a full vanguard set is as impactful as going from 50 to 70. the way armor scales makes it so as armor gets better to make serious gains you need to grow your armor values exponentially. if vanguards gave secret service up to +900 armor for a full (going from 300 to 1200) set then it would be something to consider, not actually good enough to be the best choice, but good enough to be worth thinking about, that is how skewed the numbers get when talking about large amounts of armor. 
---
Going for a set with 1 of each of the slayer type prefixes gives you more benefit than vanguard, as a set of four no effect secret service pieces with 1 slayer effect makes whatever enemy the effect targets deal less than a full vanguard set would. Reducing the damage of enemies by 15% also inversely buffs your armor, meaning you get further reduced damage equal to 1.5 full health vanguard effects, but this bonus does not scale down the way vanguards does, meaning you get the full value out of 100% of your health bar, rather than only the first, and least valuable 10%
---
I visited a camp last night owner by a level 14 mule, full of three star weapons and armors. No I don‚Äôt think putting owner‚Äôs level on the vendor is good idea.
---
I'd rather be able to do unlimited amount of rep missions but earn less from them as im more willing to spend 5 hours every few days than 1 hour every day
---
There's timegating?? Jesus Christ i just started playing because of my Xbox game pass. I knew it wasn't going to be great because no Bethesda games are but it doesn't seem like there are.. any good parts
---
I don‚Äôt know what happens when the season ends, but we do know if you finish early you don‚Äôt get anything for completing daily/weekly challenges while the season is still going.
---
Cork absorbs scorch beast sonic attacks
---
The brotherhood should reduce rewards depending on how mutated you are
---
I've played grind-oriented MMOs as well, and in my experience games like Diablo 3 are much more conducive to a RNG structure than Fallout is. I think 76 is trying to cater to too many different audiences. There are so many elements in this game which were clearly made to draw in casual audiences, this direction conflicts with stuff like time-gated currencies and account-bound items which are found in more serious MMOs. Compared to the likes of New Vegas, Fallout 4 was made with the casual player in mind and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. They chose a direction and stuck with it. My point was, it seems like Bethesda is being lazy with the direction of this game. Do you want to cater towards the casual or serious player? Pick one. To me, the various elements implemented to appease each audience conflict with one another in ways that leave us with an overall poorer experience. I'm actually interested in making a more drawn-out response about this but I'm on mobile now. Fallout 76 is confused as far as what it wants to be. To that extent I don‚Äôt think these elements have a place in Fallout 76 unless the developers want to rework other aspects to make it a more cohesive RNG driven MMO.
---
It‚Äôs part of the effort to have the players build up Atlas for the incoming brotherhood folks. For some god forsaken reason, we need an absolutely ludicrous amount of cork for this, which is both rare and not really used for much. Thus, it‚Äôs a joke, because we‚Äôre all scratching our heads at why this resource was chosen.
---
Some work, some don't. The firepit thing from the last round of rewards can be placed in camps, but the trophies and special stash boxes can't AFAIK.
---
I suppose so. But instead of everyone scrambling for a B2525/X/X Handmade maybe they should have set effects or something? I'm not sure how it would work but something along those lines would probably keep our old 1, 2 and 3 stars in the spotlight
---
I'd say you probably missed a lot of ore. When I run through with excavator, I typically get at least 300 lead ore. After you kill everything, make sure to take your time and check the walls/ceilings. I don't know if it's just me or if it actually does anything but I usually just spam "x"(I'm on ps4) until the node disappears. I believe there are some lead nodes in the first hidden tunnel, but not any in the second hidden tunnel that's hidden in the first lol
---
The next event starts on Tuesday,  we need to collect junk for the bos
---
You can technically join both. However, there is a quest that gives a ton of faction xp for one of the factions you choose.
---
Cork it‚Äôs a great fire starter and I don‚Äôt get much of it these days cause wine usually has a screw top or even a synthetic cork and that makes me sad.... oh wait we‚Äôre talking about the game here right? *sets wine glass down*
---
Perhaps your reading comprehension is not as good as you think it is. Once again, loudly, so even the folks in the back can hear it. I play the fucking game.
---
Getting two the second time was probably a bug, although like any daily if you have triggered it one day and not done it, it will still be available the next day.
---
Yeah, I know, that's the whole point.
---
You can do both until a certain point and get the rewards from both factions. The game will tell you once you‚Äôre about to start a mission that will block you from progressing the other faction
---
Lmao got em
---
No me! You dumb dumb
---
As soon as they (the enclave) give me somewhere to turn something  in at with rewards behind it for now the bos are paying??? But I really want enclave stuff.
---
I got the skeleton and that was enough for me. 
---
I still am slowly making my way to 100 (66), but I am in no rush.
---
This used to happen a lot during the first month or two of the game. Since coming back after the release of Wastelanders, I‚Äôve had this happen once to me. Although it‚Äôs annoying when it happens, it‚Äôs not as harsh.
---
The whole thing is like a duper trap. Steel, that's fine, that's relatively easy even. But cork? Hell no, no one farms cork normally, not for long at least. Maybe for crafting to learn a plan. So when we have a goal of 200 million fricken cork, people who normally dupe aren't going to think twice.
---
Jesus Christ, you're annoying.
---
Yess....welcome, member, to...our...little.........enclave.
---
Yes it definitely was, since I did complete all three on the first day I went there.
---
That‚Äôs fucking awesome :) Low level twins! Do you play on ps4?
---
Update on the situation I logged in today and the quest reappeared with just lucky mucker and he wouldn't talk to me again.
---
Only things that go in my vendor are gear that I would use myself, for prices that I would reasonably pay for it. No scrip bait in my vendor ( except for handmades, everyone deserves a legendary handmade even if it is shit, those go up for super cheap)
---
You reach a certain point in the game you know most vendor visits will be a bust: make your peace with it and enjoy the times you find gold.
---
PRAISE HUN HUNA PU THE MAYAN CORN GOD
---
I‚Äôm only 30 today but if you want the last reward I swear I went up another 5 levels to get it. It prob was way more. And I‚Äôll never use it. But I needed to do it. Because my mind is fucked lol.
---
Vats unknown
---
Fine, fuck 'em. I got no love for dupers.
---
The sarcastic slow golf clap would be a more epic pg version, of the middle finger.
---
They want you to play something better while you wait.
---
I really just going to take a break from this game. Every god damn aspect of what you described here sticks out more and more each day, and even worse so are the tsunami of bugs. Simple bugs like the fast travel bug and rubber-banding health that I‚Äôve been able to just ignore cause I have a shit ton of ammo and a strong gun instantly make me turn off the game. Killing 3 3* legendaries and getting 1* wood legs each time, makes me just turn off the game, having to server hop just to buy vault steel, has made me give up grinding for those armors. Logging on to one character thats stash and carry weight is full and expending my scrip limit for the day within a minute makes me just turn off the game. Ultimately I‚Äôve just accepted that this game lacks any sort of passion and will likely never get any passion. Every single aspect of this game is done with the absolute minimal effort, and now even the atom shop is beginning to reflect that. They don‚Äôt want you to log in to have fun playing their game they never did, they want you to log in to meet their bottom line.
---
I used it a bit early on, but now only when running silos. I don't really use it for anything else
---
Go and try
---
There was a bug when the event originally happened that let people sell the fur coat in their vendors so I actually already have a jacket on one of my characters. I can‚Äôt craft new ones and cannot transfer it but it‚Äôs good enough for me haha
---
Yeah I can carry 600 with the shocks and using ribeye steak. And my character can without it also. But I switched my whole build around to do more of the bloodied commando so I think I can only do 560. I actually started sending guns over to my beta character and then made two others because why? Because I‚Äôm a hoarder lol
---
Yeah I know, different game but umm,
---
Terran Republic &gt; The Enclave
---
The wastelander gear approach is very good, because you only gamble on that specific weapon when you craft it. It greatly narrows down the chance to get what you want. Murmur drops it for you too once you bought and learned the plan. This is about as good as it gets when it comes to RNG. Anything that ‚Äòguarantees‚Äô certain reward/effect makes it worthless because everyone and their moms will immediately have it. Value comes from scarcity and any form of guarantee negates that.
---
What lumberjack said. You can get all the rewards if you completely everything up to the final quest set for both factions(it should let you know your decision is irreversible before you make that choice so you won‚Äôt have to worry about accidentally going too far). 
---
Raiders are generally the better option, but I would suggest just looking up the faction rewards that are for sale and decide for yourself. Raiders have beat top tier items, but settlers offer better gear in the earlier tiers.
---
SMALL SPOILER: without giving any actually details of what happens, just know at the end of the questline, no matter which faction you side with, you will have to choose between 2 options. One gives you a worse reward but you will have a small reputation boost with the faction you choose and the other lets you have the full reward. This does not create any long-term problems for you! So when you get to that point just make sure you know whether a small reputation boost or a larger completion reward are what you want.
---
I um... where do I even start this cork quest? I keep hearing about it.
---
We only serve the freshest Brahmin milk, delivered by the Blue Ridge Caravan Company...
---
I‚Äôve only had the autocomplete happen once, but it was two weekly challenges. Quick way to lose 2000 SCORE.
---
Yes please.
---
Yeah lol it‚Äôs nothing I‚Äôll prob every craft. But hey I‚Äôm crazy just like how I hoard a fuck ton of three star legendaries I‚Äôll never use. But then again if they would up daily scrip limit I would get rid of a bunch more
---
How would that stop her from landing?  I‚Äôve downed her plenty of times with players doing this and she lands anyways.  She has a huge area to land.
---
Comparing this to other mmo/mmo like games like destiny, wow,runescape,warframe,eso they feel to me like play at your own pace kind of things you can sit down and make as much progress as you like without the game putting limits in to slow you down too much and fo76 felt like that pre wastelanders. 
---
Then they released wastelanders their big update and it was a big change but it had very little actual content 2 questlines then an endgame grind for rep/gold to get new items and it seems they saw there wasnt much there so they added timegating to drag out the content to make feel like theres more than there actually is but it really doesn't work as instead of making you feel like theres more content it just feels like you're being held back.
---
I think the game would feel better if they removed the limits if someone wants to sit down and burn through the content as fast as they can they should be able to just like the people that want to take their time should be able to.
---
Do the settlers quest till you get a special kind of armor, then do raiders all the way so that you'll get all of the exclusive items
---
Lazy ass post, don't even qualify your statement :-)
---
I really miss free wandering the Wastelands, trying guns I don't usually use, helping lowlevels... now I just don't have time
---
Sometimes if you wait a few minutes they will reappear. Otherwise, it‚Äôs probably just Bethesda‚Äôs way of making sure you don‚Äôt get that bss+s Powerfist.
---
Do both, do the quests for both of them until you reach the point of no return. This gets you on good terms with both factions. Making it easier to reach ally for both factions. Hope this helps :)
---
Bit of Stefan Dennis if I'm feeling really frisky....
---
I was gonna crank out mr blobbly and barbie girl
---
It‚Äôs challenging in the sense that I have dinner to make, furniture to assemble, and family to spend time with. So the challenge is ‚Äúfind the *time* to level my main‚Äù. Which isn‚Äôt a game challenge, it‚Äôs a life challenge, and life is challenging enough.
---
So I can throw an alt together instead and cheese it in 20 minutes, but that means the challenge is badly designed.
---
That's true actually. It would feel a bit worthless having it guaranteed now that you mention it. Having a certain weapon that you can just roll the dice on definitely makes it feel special in a way
---
I have multiple different 10mm smgs and I use them all with hip fire. Great way to burn some 10mm, but it's not a rifle. It's a good backup to a rifle, however when you don't care about stealth and just want to mow the thing down in front of you.
---
One of my favorite varients of this gun I own is J FFR with the scorch killer mod, it shreds and looks cool as shit. I don't use it as a primary or anything like that, but I do keep it as a side arm when I'm clearing workshops or simply building.
---
Come on Barbie let's go party...a classic for wedding karaoke....:-)
---
oh shi, you can literally build a bush with those. so like an actual moving bush lol
---
I took someone‚Äôs advice and did the alt  I‚Äôm only level 154 but it takes forever. I usually only hit that one every couple of days.
---
Eh
---
I was flirting with the idea for a while, but then I went with the [bone raider.](https://i.imgur.com/udmIP3j.png) I don't care if it offers less protection, the important thing is looking like a badass on the battlefield.
---
Yea RNG, although can be quite brutal often times, creates value at the same time.
---
No I've never been a PA user, only the excavator for mining. Weird.
---
That is a great idea!
---
Cool, good to know. I‚Äôd like to offer something fair for it if I do sell it. Not trying to break someone‚Äôs bank just to be a dick. There‚Äôs certainly far too many vending machines out there in the game economy stuck on the 10,000% mark up mode.
---
I'm thinking of investing in the brambles for even more stealth.
---
I expect them to eventually try but make all other guns but the tesla cause no damage in the process.
---
I was thinking if an update where we could go to the oil rig... not sure if it would be lore friendly tho.
---
Games that devolve in daily checklists eventually become very miserable, hollow experiences.  It might be a comparison to a different genre, but Runescape 3 is the same way, just a ridiculous amount of daily, and weekly activities you kind of feel obligated to capitalize on and probably not do anything else.  It's terrible there, and it's terrible here too. I worry now how much more stuff they're going to do it with Fallout 76.
---
I have a lot of bones to pick with Rockstar and GTA Online, but thank fuck earning money isn't timegated in a way where you can only earn a certain amount of money per hour every day or something stupid.  It only has a few time-locked activities, and thankfully most of them were obsoleted years ago and not that important.
---
Other dude doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about, as long as your camp is all 1 structure it will be fine. If it‚Äôs 2 you‚Äôll have to place them separately.
---
Honestly I hope we get more weapons that require modules to craft. It gives me a reason to actually hang on to scrip which seems to be all I get, so either way it's winwin
---
That's what I've been doing, trying to buy it but it is not there.
---
I find this perk system incredibly difficult and cryptic.
---
I‚Äôve been saying this also. Like I don‚Äôt care if they sell it but I don‚Äôt wanna waste time going there for that. If you scroll over camp it should show level. For a while I would find player and see there level on map to see if going there might be worth it. But I don‚Äôt even go to vendors anymore. It‚Äôs not worth it. No one is selling their duped legacies no one is selling god roll weapons and almost every plan they sell I know and drop anytime I get it. I don‚Äôt even waste time putting in vendor. I was in a server buying a handmade from a guy for 10k caps. Every player in that lobby was 200 to 400 and they all sold crap. Most of them where just sitting in their camps which I don‚Äôt know why they be been doing that.
---
There's going to be a community event that had players donate junk like cork and leather. People are saving up cause million of each piece is needed.
---
The event hasn‚Äôt started yet, it‚Äôs a community event coming soon to rebuild Atlas for the BOS
---
I tried this with 2 new characters.  Still didn't check them off
---
Thanks for letting me know!
---
I've got 12 unused currently, I would have thought by now 135 every perk card should be listed when I go to buy on, on PC I use Q to bring up the list, filter by INT and scroll across.
---
So all I gotta do is move my camp right ? Like just find my next location and hit move camp on the pip boy ?
---
Here Here! Down with the Enclave!
---
Yes i totally agree, I‚Äôve suggested that all weapons should have a legendary plan that we can buy with gold and craft our own just like the gauss mini and shotty. Feel like doing a double barrel shotgun build? Buy the legendary plan, get the module, and start rolling the crafting dice. This gives us more reasons to farm for scrips and make our own legendary collection.
---
Nukashine 30 secs or more to teleport, if you are not getting damage you can fast travel, otherwise you are dead. Well you can survive if you endure the damage until the traps break.
---
Thats what I meant
---
Or you know? Some good old fashion brotherhood interrogations.
---
Except there is sometimes a valuable skill called "not giving a fuck" about high end player demands. Yes, people similar to me will burn through months worth of development in a week and then bitch about no content. Others want to burn through your content in a week, and move on to other games. And those others realize that there is no magical voodoo powers development team on this green earth that will churn out game content at the same rate and speed a player is capable burning through it. It's just common fucking sense. Time gating it though, so you can milk my time daily for all it's worth over a span of months - now that just leaves a very sour taste in my mouth.
---
The milk is sterilised, pasteurised and sweetened. We have a pristine and fully-functional Slocum Joe BakerTron (tm) that bakes fresh batches of cookies every four hours. Each bag comes with a side dip of cookie dough, for those of you in the wasteland who like a little risk with their reward.
---
We are the Enclave. We do it right, because we once *made it right in the first place.*
---
Exactly man, I can't tell you how many times I've hit the purveyor in hopes of specific roles. It burns me put. I feel as though I have more hope trying to get a specific weapon like the gauss mini etc.
---
I recently managed to tame my first animals. First of all, they are buggy as he'll and may dissappear randomly. Secondly it has to be a random spawn with a solo animal, I've farmed the pond north of abbys bunker and managed to tame several.
---
Also I've noticed you can have one animal from both wasteland whisperer and animal companion.
---
Atleast for me, after having both and taming a new one, the animal from either perk gets replaced.
---
Like several others are saying, do quests for both up until the game tells you to pick a side. By doing this, you can get a lot of easy reputation. On top of that, if you choose raiders, the settler missions can give you 2 plans that would be expensive if you tried to buy them with gold.
---
That‚Äôs not the backpack you can mod.
---
At the max level for bagpack. Small only gives HALF the carry weight.
---
Tadpole gives 60 at max level bag.
---
Small gives 30.
---
Nice to see this I was going to say if on Xbox I have one I‚Äôll give free. I bought one from someone a while back for 5k caps and then next event I literally get one. I just refused to pay 15k caps. But i did get lucky and purveyor has given me 3 of them. One was mutant slayer other was zealot that has beat prefixes but beat one was the bloodied I got from her one night after getting 3 bloodied weapons in a row. Mines not god roll but it‚Äôs awesome. So good on you guys and hopefully the op gets lucky.
---
Did you buy the actual plans or the mod plans?
---
I wold like to get the banner for one of my characters... been wanting BoS and enclave flags for a while ...
---
Personally I have 4 CHR (+ unyielding though) and only use Animal friend, wasteland whisperer is not required, as for locations use this map (red dots)  [https://twitter.com/MrsP123/status/1162349085434818560/photo/1](https://twitter.com/MrsP123/status/1162349085434818560/photo/1)
---
Edit: Animal friend must be maxed, and i recommend trying to escort your pet to the camp, as low level tamed pets are likely to die on the way to your camp.
---
Not even close to 9k unfortunately. The first prefix can be most important and vampires usually pairs nicely with explosive, not with ffr. 10mm also isn't a top desirable. 
---
I'd say you might expect to get 1-4k for it
---
I hate having to use that work around personally, because I agree that if you are on the defensive there should be some type of cool down period before you can initiate again. the problem I think arises from the fact that the defender gets a full set of shots off on the enemy before they can really respond. Point blank automatic gamma shots against an attacker almost always instant kills and doesn't give time to respond. Maybe it should be more of a dueling mechanism? Smack, smack, and then a countdown to pace away or prepare?
---
Couldn‚Äôt disagree more
---
Plans from reg
---
Thanks! I appreciate it!
---
I just wanted the gillie suit and finally got it earlier today. In the last couple of matches I got the glow in the dark Skelton suit and that‚Äôs good enough for me. I‚Äôm pretty sure I still need a few thousand xp for the fur lined coat and I just don‚Äôt see myself using it either.
---
There‚Äôs some at bunker near prime like other said watoga has a good bit. It took me a little longer one day when I wanted another one so I couldn‚Äôt craft my t65. But there‚Äôs plenty and if you don‚Äôt feel like wasting caps just server hop until it‚Äôs at the location you‚Äôre at
---
I want a vault boy dab emote
---
You still need 14k xp it starts all over for that stupid coat
---
I can help you out. 250 each in my vendor. 
---
Gt?
---
I'm not crying
---
I can't find any information about that Skyrim bug. Do you have any hints regarding what I may search for?
---
You need 14k after skeleton to get coat. It starts all over for that reward but the Halloween and ghille all counted towards same
---
This picture is incredibly difficult to find, I just searched for half an hour and could only find the 2020 roadmap with no dates. Its like this picture doesnt even exist, thank you for posting it here.
---
Right on, I don‚Äôt / have never really used to 10mm sub so not sure what the demand was, if any.
---
You bought mod plans not actual armor plans homie
---
From your description, it sounds as though you purchased mods for the limbs rather than the actual plans to make the limbs. Check again to see if he still has the plans
---
Why aren‚Äôt they putting the enclave in with the BOS? Imagine having them both in, and it‚Äôs on sight combat in the wasteland with patrols going deeper through WV. It could even be an event, to help the faction you CHOOSE (with only having 1 choice and not being able to progress the other) finish their patrol alive while gathering resources. Ugh üòë
---
Most likely you purchased the mods for the armor, not the armor plans itself, how much gold were they worth? (to confirm)
---
How often do you have furniture to assemble?
---
Murmrgh‚Äôs pool is gigantic, the chance is very slim if you‚Äôre looking for a specific item with specific effects. Good drop does happen, but hardly at the time when we really want it.
---
Of this nature? Such as? It's not an MMO, since it sure as hell doesn't have the scale and content of one. And if we're talking looter shooters or survival games (like Rust), then which ones?
---
Whitesprings and Hemlock Holes, here I come!
---
Update: I'm level 102 now and now going stealth commando because I picked up a Furious Fixer yesterday.  Wow! Serious damage dealer with no detection.  I clear all my legendary farming spots without taking a single hit. Crazy! And I have more points to move from strength since I was playing with lots of carrying capacity for fun.  Instead I just got 1st and that took care of my junk/scrap issue.  I was already paying monthly for other games I wasn't playing so canceled them all. LOL.  Having fun!
---
My camp was all 1 structure and when I moved it I had to scrap 2 piece blueprints for 30 minutes. The blueprint system doesn't work most of the time.
---
It starts over after that reward? Wouldn‚Äôt it be the other xmas rewards?  If your right about that then I definitely won‚Äôt be bothering.
---
That sucks. I don't know if it matters, but I never left the session after leaving the vault. Just went straight to the locations I was missing.
---
I don't know what the current state of animal taming is as I've read conflicting information over the year.
---
BUT when I tamed a sloth last year, I had read that at the time you needed animal friend 3 as well as wasteland whisperer 3. I was able to tame a wild Megasloth after equipping the perks and pointing my gun at the creature it gave me new option "[square] tame" and the usual " [triangle?] pacify". I tamed that puppy and went to my camp and he was there moaning like they do. Poor guy only lasted a few days though during Fastnacht last year after camp griefers hit me. 
---
The game has evolved since then and I've since read you only need max animal friend, or you need 1 of each. I would love if some could post here what the current state is. There is also question if you need camp budget or not.
---
Think of the children!
---
I'll DM it to you.
---
You can put the mod on it from the bullion guy at foundation, the grocers mod
---
In that case, im right and you're wrong. Thanks for playing!
---
I don‚Äôt know how üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
You can fight all fights with it. Damage comes from a good commando build.
---
You may not be able to mod it, but you sure can apply a skin to it.
---
Like you have to get another 14k just for that last outfit. As the Halloween rewards you only needed 14k for everything. I‚Äôm telling you if I didn‚Äôt already put 4 level ups in I would‚Äôve given up but I finally got it
---
I have wasteland whisperer maxed...
---
Can only grind so much
---
I‚Äôve always read you need animal friend at level 3, and whisperer at level 1.  The tame option didn‚Äôt appear for me until I did that.  
---
In regards to buggy, well, I‚Äôve had my Mirelurk Hunter ‚ÄúPinchy‚Äù at my base for weeks now without issues.  You can‚Äôt name them anymore which sucks
---
I‚Äôve tamed 3 pets and all made it back to my base without an escort.  It‚Äôll take several in game hours irl to show up though in my experience
---
I‚Äôd recommend watching some guides.  There‚Äôs a recent one from a month ago that breaks it down.  Cranberry Glade is a hotspot for random encounters too
---
Also, another tip - in my experience you need to be right next to the animal to tame.  Otherwise pacify is the only option.  This is where it‚Äôs glitchy.  Stealth really helps here
---
Nevermind, read your post wrong. Lol
---
In that case I‚Äôm happy with what I have lol.
---
Well that outcome would be mathematically correct with a very high probability based on current known BGS behaviors. Ad Victoriam!
---
I don't and never did in any Fallout game unless Fallout2
---
As stated below, you probably bought the mods for the limbs, not the limbs themselves.
---
It's only half of the big one, true. But if you just want a bit of extra carry capacity without having to look for someone who wants to help you to obtain the big one through the Tadpole quest, it's still a good way to obtain one.
---
Yes. If you read the post, the OP knows that.
---
üñï
---
Word
---
Yeah I know. That was the point. It's funny that a gazillion people say "throw away your cork" and all of a sudden Bethesda puts out an event where you need cork.
---
This is the best answer. It takes two to tango; you can choose to ignore PvP 100% in this game. 
---
When I see people saying ‚ÄòPvP makes no sense in this game‚Äô, I get the feeling they are very new to the game.
---
Ok thank you all for the help...correct me if I am wrong but it is on a 20 hour cool down right...so i should be bale to log in later tonight and go see what I missed?
---
&gt;Comparing this to other mmo/mmo like games like destiny, wow,runescape,warframe,eso they feel to me like play at your own pace kind of things you can sit down and make as much progress as you like without the game putting limits in to slow you down too much and fo76 felt like that pre wastelanders.
---
You mean how games are supposed to work when you buy them? I agree. Or any product for that matter? I know in this crazy ass modern world, even old common sense is foreign anymore. You bought the likes of Fallout and Fallout 2 back in the day, and played it - for days, weeks, maybe months even. All in your own time and on your own pace.
---
I'm pretty sure that's not a bug but rather the Bethesda solution to the SBQ corpse landing out of bounds.
---
Seems to be the case for all Scorchbeasts you didn't loot.
---
Contrary to the incorrect information that scrubs keep regurgitating in comments, It can take *any* mod. Always has been able to, ever since it was first implemented. But up until Wastelanders, the mods were super expensive to trade for and you could only get yourself some Possum Badges by getting to the point of already being able to craft the Large Backpack anyway. Pretty sure the ability to apply the Chemist's/Grocer's mods to the Small Backpack was an oversight rather than a decision, but it is one that they know they will never be able to backtrack on.

[FALLOUT 76: PATCH 13 NOTES ‚Äì SEPTEMBER 10, 2019](https://bethesda.net/en/article/4bGHdIFQ27EzLbZp1EoWoW/fallout-76-patch-13-notes-september-10-2019)  
---
- Small Backpacks: A new type of Backpack, the ‚ÄúSmall Backpack‚Äù has been added in an effort to help more players acquire a Backpack earlier on during their Appalachian adventures.  
---
- A Plan to craft a Small Backpack can be found inside the Overseer‚Äôs Cache inside the Morgantown Airport Terminal. This Plan cannot be traded, sold, or dropped.  
---
- Small Backpacks have 50% of the carry capacity provided by a standard Backpack.  
---
- Small Backpacks can be equipped with all the same Mods as a standard Backpack.  
---
- Players can still learn to craft Standard Backpacks by completing Pioneer Scout Quests.
---
Yeap I gave it to them. I've sold one for 10k once when I was desperate for caps but I have plans extending back to beta and including every event I like to give away
---
YES!  This is a good compromise, we can be happy to offload all that dead weight, and Bethesda can be happy to still have a shitty mobile-style daily engagement driver in effect.  Great idea!
---
Gizas that looks awesome.
---
Much better. Thank u.
---
But our 1k scrip cap and daily 150 is killing our ability to play.
---
Ok but what I didn‚Äôt get yet is: if I chose settlers for the final mission then raiders will attack me when I fast travel to Crater? Or it will still be possible purchase items that I‚Äôve unlocked at their vendors?
---
&gt;  Why are you so deathly afraid people who are good at grinding will blow through your content in a week?  
---
You said it yourself, the devs of PoE, FFXIV or Warframe know that most players take a break.  It's normal.  They also know that most people will come back as long as core experience is fun and there's some new content to look forward to (no Bethesda, rep grinds are not content).
---
Bethesda clearly doesn't have enough confidence in their own game to be comfortable with players playing at their own pace or taking breaks.
---
That's my mistake for not completley spelling it out. Some people struggle with the obvious.
---
Beckett gave me a Nocturnal Cryolator today. 
---
First shit weapon I got from him so he can stay a bit longer.
---
Getting the thumbs down from a group of strangers feels way worse than getting a middle finger from one dude.
---
You sure can mod it lol. I have a small backpack with high capacity mod from learning plan that I traded for. It gives +90 capacity.
---
Simple. Introduce weapon modules that adds a star and bonus effect to a weapon. This allows players to upgrade their 3 star weapons to 5 stars. The modules should be really difficult to earn though.
---
I play nirvana when I'm feeling self distructive
---
As long as it‚Äôs a William Shatner cover I‚Äôm down.
---
Then it literally can't be using the other gpu. Why do you have it if you aren't using it?
---
Wow, serves me right for not always reading patch notes I guess. Just stumbled upon this and hadn't seen it being mentioned before on the sub, so I thought I'd share. Thanks for the additional info!
---
Someone in charge at Bethesda said to figure out a way to get everyone logging in and playing daily, and now here we are.
---
Seems that way. Normally nocturnal or mutants slayers for me.
---
Uhm, your kidding right?
---
 I ran into a guy/gal on xbox today having 79 The Fixer plans for sale. At worst their account was banned for a week this last "Ban wave", and they got to keep the loot.
---
Yeah bethesda really is going after dupers, and this cork mission is a crafty ruse by bethesda to lure them out...
---
You can move your camp module. It's trial and error but it usually works. Only problem is it will put everyone else's spawn pour in a different place too. Not the same as yours.
---
It's why I stopped playing. It's a shame. The elements are there.
---
Rude
---
The kind in your browser that tracks all your activity
---
I'm sitting on 3200 cork rn. I hoard like a mad man. It always comes in use
---
Coming later this year thankfully. Look into "Daily Ops" and "Expeditions". We don't know a lot so far but it sounds like what you're asking for.
---
OP stop discriminating against low level or new players.
---
I checked and you are right. It isn't there. I have this perk maxed but I can't pick it up again for some reason. I tried filter by INT and without filter. It isn't there.
---
If you‚Äôre manually doing blueprints. This guys just asking if when he moves his camp it will get messed up. The answer is no
---
3 star SBQ and other legendaries can drop 1-3 star items.  It isn‚Äôt a guaranteed 3* item (or 2*).  And yes, the 1* Nocturnal Rolling Pin is a gem
---
Yeah.. This game started to remind me of Vaas. ‚ÄúDo you know the definition of insanity?‚Äù Yes, it‚Äôs fallout 76 day in, day out lol. 
---
I‚Äôve quit FO76 one week ago and haven‚Äôt regret for a moment. I‚Äôm done. For the same reason and many others.
---
The SCORE made it even f**king worse
---
Neither side will attack you if you choose the opposing faction.
---
I'll allow Lithium BUT only because the bass line is wizard
---
Raiders act the exact same as they did before the final quest. You don‚Äôt lose any faction reputation with them, just have a longer way to go for their best reputation rewards.
---
I got about 600. I honestly don't even know what it comes from. I just grab everything and scrap it.
---
I'm gonna troll both when the Enclave content inevitably happens.
---
Actually, data miners have uncovered that what's stated on the Pip-Boy is inaccurate.
---
The Queen will drop a random, but the event will always reward you with a 2* piece of armor.
---
Humm, weird, I had an alt it wouldn‚Äôt let me do that with a long time ago.
---
Yeah I am always open to equal value goods that I may not particularly need or flux so long as its a fair trade.
---
That's exactly what I do. Its free to store unlimited amounts on first accts. It's not hurting me. I look dumb 90% of my gaming time for hoarding but look like a genius 10% when these events pop off.
---
Big talk from a follower of traitor Maxson's teachings!
---
Was wondering if that's why it started raining big boys.
---
This is the main way I‚Äôm farming XP on my private server right now and this bug has happened to me several times in the past week. And yeah, it‚Äôs always the last enemy in the last wave
---
&gt;	Then they released wastelanders their big update and it was a big change but it had very little actual content 2 questlines then an endgame grind for rep/gold to get new items
---
There is way more to wastelanders than just two questlines. New locations, new weapons, the entire instancing system, allies, random encounters, new enemies, new events.
---
Why wouldnt they trade with each other? BOS and Responders had always been good friends until Maxsons order to hoard tech. Free States, particularly under Harpers Ferry would have been open to trade. Besides the Cutthroats, raiders would have been open to trade. Especially the Diehards, who practically weren't even raiders. Due to the high security system, people could bring tons of stuff here and not have to worry about it being stolen or anything, the train stations were probably more like mini-trading stations if you didnt want to go all the way to Whitesprings.
---
And why do they need to mention Whitesprings? It wouldnt add anything since we already know they traded there.
---
And considering how most players have more than 30k caps at this point and it would be way easier to just go and scavenge caps than slowly wait for bottles to go by (Not to mention that the fate of Applachia, dare I say the entire world, depends on the appropriate usage of Kanawha) it wouldnt make sense to try and abuse Kanawha for caps. The cap supply is limited in there.
---
Caps as a currency was also predicted to be the major currency in a post nuclear holocaust by the Think Tank, which knows way more about the Fallout Universe than anybody irl does. So I think it's pretty clear why caps are used as a currency, especially when the Blue Ridge Caravan came to Appalachia
---
Don‚Äôt worry. Because you‚Äôre right.... Bethesda won‚Äôt respond to this.
---
I did not manually make a blueprint. I moved my camp, it fragmented into 200 two item blueprints.
---
It *SHOULD* stay intact, but it never has when at full budget. Please be more open to changing information rather than just saying "no". That's unhelpful.
---
When reinforcements come, we will re-build our nation! Join the Enclave to help America mend its fallout wounds!
---
You must be around my age with talk of zig and zag
---
Never mind it's supposed to ploop thrm outa the sky after you fast travel.
---
This is exactly the kinda shit.. that I love about Reddit
---
I thought I was the last one standing after all these yearsüò¢
---
I tend to agree with new content on MMOs the timegating is frustrating if you really want to grind but they also are smart enough to add catch up mechanisms or keep the gates only on the latest and greatest things.
---
However, since this game has like three mechanisms (caps, scrip, bullion) that are all still tied to the latest / greatest, it's all gated still.  If they want to follow the MMO model, old stuff should be open to buy with say caps, things from nuclear winter with scrip, and the new stuff strictly behind the bullion.  After that let you grind the first two almost endlessly so you can get good stuff but not the best stuff.  Eventually you get the bullion needed to start putting together the top tier things.
---
I have the SS regular armor and mods I want, about half the power armor, and the weapon with no mods right now and I've been pretty consistent.  It's definitely crazy how slow it is to get all that stuff considering it's been months.  Honestly I just roll through the bullion dailies and the normal dailies since I like the end of the seasonal event rewards and generally don't do anything else and I'd happily spend a ton more time there as I really enjoy the world.
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. I started playing Fallout 4 recently bc I never finished the DLCs and it‚Äôs 4 billion times better than F76 after a certain point at least. Take settlements for example.  You don‚Äôt need to scavenge for junk. You can just download a mod that‚Äôll give you a fuck ton of each resource and you can build till your heart‚Äôs content. Not to mention most are much bigger than CAMPs can ever be and there are 30 just in the base game.
---
Yeah, I read the post?
---
The "grind" for bullion isn't as bad as everyone makes it out. You can easily overfill the 20 notes in one session.
---
The real problem is that you can not exchange more than 20 notes each day. I am sitting on more than 500 notes, basically I use them as wallpaper because they don't get less...
---
Have you got the list so I can take a look
---
Nah, I'm on controller. Thought maybe would still help.
---
Haha I got one last nightü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ
---
That‚Äôs the high point of the event, so when you get a one star lead pipe from the queen you won‚Äôt feel too shitty. Put the two items together you‚Äôre looking at three stars.
---
Huh first time i heard this one, were did you get it on? Steam, XBOX game pass, Beth launcher?
---
I agree 100%. I even feel like features we all want such as a storage/bank to share things between our characters or for currencies to be account wide won't be added because Bethesda wants us to do all these long ass grinds on each and every character.
---
It can literally use the other gpu? A gpu doesn't need to be connected to the display, it's there for compute workloads
---
Yes that is exactly my point it's not the grind itself that is bad it's the fact that it's timegated by only being able to turn in 20 notes per day.
---
Hence removing that timegate
---
Lol.  I think it‚Äôs considered the worst weapon in the game so it‚Äôs actually valuable just for satire alone üòÖ
---
It was like 700 for both
---
Yeah this is some wives tale. I stand on my tent like everyone else and she lands just fine
---
If you ain't playing fallout with the sinking feeling of knowing your game is gonna crash any second than are you really playing fallout?
---
Look under Special Offers section, or if you recently got F1st  look for the free items under the tab for F1st
---
Stop spreading your filthy propaganda the Enclave is corrupt
---
I didn't play GTA Online but I did play a lot of Red Dead Online and it's the same story there. Yes, the content is finite and there is only so much to grind for before it gets repetitive or boring - but absolutely nobody is stopping you from amassing a large amount of progress extremely quickly.
---
I‚Äôm not gonna change my information when 1 person says something that‚Äôs never happened to me in 800 hours and I‚Äôve never heard from another person, even though I frequently browse the Reddit and use discord
---
Last tab of featured items. Where the daily sale item is.
---
yea the game is a turtle speed like a 4000 pound turtle thats the size of penny
---
I have my camp just right outside the nuke zone of where the game launches it. Though I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if some douche tries to nuke my camp and the mine at once
---
Bah. Bunch of sheeples looking for one fascist dictator or another to tell you what to do. Free states or nothing and the way factions are going it still looks like nothing....come in Bethesda. Just one decent npc to show you care.
---
Agreed.  I've posted pretty much everything stated above on their official forum, and got run off by their schills there.  Good thing they can't come here and delete it all to hide all the problems with this company and game.  It bothers them when people are able to articulate these flaws, so they call it 'bashing'.  I won't be spending another cent on this company, no matter how many times they try to shunt me past the atom store.  All my atoms were free from grinding before seasons grinched them and added an atoms sink on top, and I will only ever use those.
---
"Douchess", nice. Typo or not, that's hilarious.
---
Apparently you were gone long enough to miss people complaining about lack of content........and then complaining about the new content. That's how it works here bruh.
---
As much as I love fallout there is no way I would ever book time off for a video gameüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Nothing lives forever and this cat got to have his face put into not only Fallout, but the camps of loads of players. That's a pretty damned good life and legacy if you ask me. Good for Galen.
---
Add me to the list.  Got her recorder, quest step says return to commander daguerre, and all she‚Äôs doing is complaining about her back.  Has this really been busted for nearly three months with no fix?
---
You'd end up with a lot of plans you can't do anything with, rolling legendary effects takes a lot longer and isn't a process that really ever ends as there is always a better effect your armor can possess for one of the stars. For non legendaries like the t-65 they're just something to buy to waste built up bullion.
---
ü§£ü§£
---
Fine, stay in your boat of "never happened to me so it isn't true". 
---
My 1200 hours says otherwise. Bugs happen. A lot.
---
Oh, I'm sorry then I misunderstood
---
&gt; The Gold Bullion grind is already big enough as it is
---
It all depends on what their collectron collects. So help me god if it just collects steel I will kill someone
---
I don't like the limit - but I could deal with it - if I didn't have to micromanage it.
---
Just give me the following on a 7 day reset / weekly limit, that resets at the same time as the weekly quests (so I never have to guess).
---
* 9,800 vendor cap limit
---
* 1,400 bullion
---
* 1,050 scrip
---
And make the dailies reset at the same time as the legendary daily timer.
---
Or - specifically for bullion &amp; script.  Do a reverse WoW rested system.
---
* half all values you get for scrip.  First 150 each day is doubled.
---
* half all values on treasury notes.  First 200 each day is doubled
---
The the theory is that if you stagger her mid-air she doesn‚Äôt complete her cycle and won‚Äôt land.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true or not.
---
No. It also drops 3* Lead Pipes and Rolling Pins. Mostly Nocturnal.
---
I don't think you actually lose any reputation from taking it all, you just miss out on some reputation you would have gained otherwise.
---
The deliverer is a unique version of a weapon thats base version was cut iirc, they could use the generic version.
---
U want animal friend not wasteland whisperer for most pets ... but 3 charisma is fine - I have tamed tons of pets with 3 Chr and rank 3 animal friend ...
---
Bethesda does not want you to complete the run in time. They want you to come up short so you either draw down your saved atoms or buy atoms to buy the remaining levels.
---
Very well. All in favor, say  "I".  Not in favor, will be hunted!

I did find some free offers inside the C.A.M.P. section that I didn't realize were free (awesome fruit bowl). But I don't see this free icon anywhere
---
Yes -that is what I said lol üòÇ a couple of creatures (I.e. snallygaster) requires wasteland whisperer and not animal friend - but most tamables work using animal friend
---
Fallout is not a regular run of the mill RPG either is it? Its a game as a service much as an MMO is and so yes, fallout not only has a place for jt, but is in need of more of this in the future.
---
They want players to keep playing and to give players a reason to keep playing. And its a valid approach.
---
If you want it approached like a regular RPG then complete it and move on to the next. 
---
If you want the best gear in the game at any given time, best be prepared to work for it.
---
If not, then thats ok too. You dont need the gear. Not having the gear will not prevent you from doing anything else in the game. 
---
Expect if anything to see more of this alas 76 continues.
---
Ummm
---
Welcome back but I have bad news for you. I think adrenaline is still broken.
---
It's in the shop, the free one anyways.
---
 The picture the text is on top of is not the free icon though.  The free icon is an eagle.  The picture is a icon from the legendary run rewards.
---
Yeah u definitely got the mods, look for the ones named "Secret Service Left/Right Legs/Arms" each is worth 750 gold.
---
[This is what that is showing me..](https://i.imgur.com/ZqFxYAB.png) I don't have any more tabs to go through
---
They were mods for the secret service armor. The actual armor is called secret service (limb name). You bought the mod that gives increased radiation. The armor costs 1250 for chest, 750 for left leg, 750 for right leg, 750 for left arm and 750 for right arm. Not sure about the helm.
---
I know but there's absolutely no concrete info on it so yeah lol.
---
Look I don‚Äôt ever play at those times at all and it‚Äôs never happened to me yet, but from what I‚Äôve read that‚Äôs only one of many potential causes. I‚Äôve heard that doing the NW challenge before you finish adventure mode has a chance of doing it, and I‚Äôve heard that just logging in can trigger it.
---
The truth is that this is an embarrassment for Bethesda. No triple A game should ever have something where you have to follow all of these guidelines in order to avoid a game breaking glitch. Sure if it were week 1 and they patched it because they may have missed it the first time, but this has gone on long enough
---
I contested a workshop and was like HUH it said unowned. But it was for a challenge and since there was no resource extractors i figured they didn't care
---
Well shit into the shop it goes what do you think ? 5000 caps? ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Try shift as well. And both at the same time.
---
Yes, Fallout is well known for its PG rating.
---
That explains it!
---
I can't believe they aren't actually showing the free icon that is being offered.... but the text does explain that they're talking about the "American Eagle" icon lol
---
thanks
---
It's especially tough on folks that work long hours all week and only play on the weekends. I don't play much during the week, but I might play for 12 hours on Saturday or Sunday. It's unfortunate that I can max my scrip total and my bullion in just a few of those hours. Why can't I just grind away for 24 hours turning in scrip and bullion the whole time? That would give me a chance to catch up to the ones that have the opportunity to play an hour or two every day. The time gates suck.
---
One does not simply install F76
---
I'm playing WoW, Pillars of Eternity and Grounded. Fo76 just became to boring to stick with.
---
I'm a not Melee build and from what I've gather the do not do the same damage out put. I keep a fire axe as it has the best speed to damage ratio to anything else non legendary and if not set for melee build.
---
Cool!!
---
I have it aswel super annoying
---
Yeah - there is nothing that explains it but I spent many many hours learning what works and that is my experience probably from over 20 successful tamings - that being
---
Said I haven‚Äôt tamed Since the last
---
Patch so there is always a chance they could have changed something ...
---
What?
---
The first thing on that tab. The eagle icon.
---
That‚Äôs not what OP described.
---
From my understanding she lands to attack the player that's doing the most damage to her and if that happens to be someone standing on something she can't land at their level because she can't fit on a fence or tent so she won't land. If someone on the ground has the highest damage output then your fine but when someone has a god role of a weapons for their build and stands on a survival tent floating in the air she doesn't land
---
You already knew about the limit why do this?
---
Loved the time the hopper ate all my 5.56 (about 6k.)  Took me a LONG time to ever do the event again.
---
Last time I did this event was right after Wastelanders dropped, and the Mr Handy took me THROUGH THE DEEP. I had no idea he could even go inside of places. So I thought "hmm, must be a new thing. He needs to deliver a message to some place in the cave." I followed this thing for like 10 minutes. He kept getting stuck and would eventually just skip ahead a little after a minute. Led me through an underwater passage for a bit too. Eventually we reached where he was going: The other side/exit of the cave! His delivery location wasn't even in the cave, he just wanted to go through it. That was the last time I did this event and the last time I'll ever do this event.  
---
Waste of time, even for lower levels.
---
I'm the same way, it's never my fault when I make dumb decisions either.
---
Just in case - blueprints are laggy as hell (at least for me)  
---
single foundation with ladder and single floor on top of it - unable to place anywhere  
---
rotated x/y/z, moved my camp like 100 times, sometimes shows green zone, trying to put - f\*k  u(I mean - me), some weird error, that I can't built there.  
---
After that decided to build the same structure as in blueprint, but from scratch on exactly the same spot - everything went fine.  
---
blueprints driving me nuts
---
You don't have to do anything you don't want to do: it's a game.
---
Personnaly I dont play NW at all, I missed 10 days, and still, I am in the average step for the legendary run.
---
Nailer, slug buster, perfect storm, the special Smg from settlers, tenderizer, sheepsquatch club... I think the many responses have cleared this one up haha
---
Oh, can't forget fancy shotgun and revolver!
---
This happens to me a lot except it‚Äôs the bug where I‚Äôm fast traveling out of watoga and suddenly a giant corpse appears at my camp out of no where
---
Why didn't you just craft them as your bought the modules? Not saying the script limit makes sense. I agree it shouldn't be a think but we all know how it's works and you kinda out yourself in this situation ü§ó
---
Bugs you say. Jus you wait till patch 21 hits. You‚Äôll have all the bugs you want!   Sincerely, (not really) Bugthesda.
---
So then my question is why would people do that in the first place?  Just being dicks and trying to prevent anyone else from getting loot?
---
Different uses.
---
Shit, I've only been playing since fallout 3 but I've played them all since and the elder scrolls games and for me they've always been about killing fuckers and collecting trash. 
---
In fallout 3 I had a room in my megaton house dedicated to just all of the teddy bears and pencils I collected and the bathroom was full of plungers from floor to ceiling. 
---
Works out well because my wife isn't big on gathering and hoarding so she just comes to my camp whenever she needs anything, and I always have it.
---
So glad to see you explain your reasoning. Oh wait...
---
&gt;as said, if you dont want to patriciate,  DONT.  why is reddit full of whining and bitching???   for roleplaying sake, this is the objective.  help them or not...
---
But we hates thems, precious.  We hates them!  &lt;gollum&gt;  
---
I wish, for roleplaying sake, we anti-BoS folks had our own questline with rewards for thwarting the Atlas Project.
---
- Hillbilly Hotdogs (Hillfolk Hotdogs in-game)
---
Really good hotdogs and hamburgers that looks like a junkyard. It's very good for pictures. You eat inside a bus. 
---
- Camden Park
---
An older and smaller amusement park. It's got some gift shops and some fun rides.
---
- Helvetia 
---
Locals describe it as "an hour from anywhere" it's a small census designated area (too small for a town) that has a really good restaurant and a neat museum/general store. They celebrate Fasnaucht near the end of February. Thats the best time to go.
---
- Point Pleasant
---
Home of the Mothman museum and Mothman festival, its especially attractive during the mothman festival. The museum is really unique and interesting and sells Fallout merchandise. 
---
-Greenbrier (Whitesrping)
---
Very nice hotel with activities and shops to visit. Rooms are very nicely furnished and regal. I stayed in a room for 160 a night. 
---
- Cranberry Glade 
---
Nice place to visit and to walk the boarded trail. Beautiful in summer and spring. 
---
These are all places that I have went and have had good experiences with. There's more than whats listed but I have specifically listed places that is in 76. Mothman Fest and Hillbilly Hotdogs is a real treat.
---
Friendly PvP surprise parties
---
nice. thanks.
---
Why is this marked as nsfw?
---
All of those corpses that follow me are completely empty as I previously looted them, I think you are right as it can be used for that but it‚Äôs also just an unintended game mechanic
---
They‚Äôre talking about what the event rewards you with. Not what you get off the Queen.
---
I feel you. I wouldn't be mad if they added it.
---
Only 1300lb? I have 1499lb most of the time and have to be drinking beer just so I can walk
---
I was looking for the blue icon, I've realized the blue icon isn't actually being offered for free
---
thanks for the help locating that tab though
---
That or they don't know but either way being able to give them a üñï would be nice
---
Only if Beth would show us Enclave members some love.
---
A glorious buggy mess
---
My guess I'd to get people to look
---
Hopefully for just 2 more days, but we get to look forward to a new perk card being broken.
---
&gt; Once placed in your camp or vendor, you have absolutely no way to prove how you got it. It's worthless food.
---
&gt; Lol cry about it.
---
Make sure your excavator isn't missing a piece or something. When you click a node once, you should get 4 ore. And yeah, I typically get 350-400+ ore per run so there's lots more to be had!
---
lmao
---
Thanks all
---
How‚Äôs the snow there by the end of February?
---
To be fair he finds it quite relaxing. We‚Äôve learned not to ask questions about why precisely.
---
I‚Äôve soloed the queen in about 10 seconds and haven‚Äôt gotten it, my discover locales in cranberry bog is bugged and the couple of people also ha e the same issue of not actually getting rewarded for discovering abandoned bog town. And I think i have a couple more bugged but hey, unwanted game mechanics from Bethesda.
---
Meanwhile in the Freestates "look if you have an bunker, you're in"
---
Not to mention the amazing gift our even more amazing space platform can drop for all loyal members. Both pleasant and... deadly.
---
Honestly, it‚Äôs 100% hit or miss. I‚Äôve come across those types and I‚Äôve come across the nicest people out there. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs going to happen. :(
---
Why did you need to do this in one go if you‚Äôve been ‚Äúgrinding for months?‚Äù  You knew that there were going to be more extras than you could scrap even if you had gotten what you wanted. You can‚Äôt expect the game to accommodate an edge case like this...
---
I was joking.
---
Your camp starts spawning before you do, as the game loads all your assets in, last thing being ur character with its inventory. Its possible that your game registers the blast for the nuke as u go into the game. It happens when you enter a nuke zone in nuclear winter, the ground shakes and the sound que plays, but you take no damage. Its possible that the game loads your camp, than loads the nuke, then loads ur character last.
---
Not saying it‚Äôs not true because wit hasn‚Äôt happened to me, I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôve never heard of it from myself, my friends, or anyone else, even though this community is always complaining about the smallest of things
---
Two words: pacifist mode.
---
Find it in settings, enable it. Don't join private teams with anyone you don't know and trust. Public teams are fine.
---
You can also fast repair stuff thats broken at camp by clicking on the CAMP module itself and pressing repair all
---
Use Pacifist mode, and you wont engage in any PVP (except in workshops).
---
Additional info Edit:  This community is really awesome, we got some rotten apples but very few, and if u guys are on PC you can add me (ign: Glowingpossum) I can rebuild ur camp at cost free. :)
---
Ya that happened to me the other day. Everyone there but me said screw the event and lined up to see Grahm's wares.
---
Lowest I‚Äôve gotten ever was 212 and I missed quite a few. Did you use excavator power armor or run in without it? Since excavator would make it 4 per ore instead of 1
---
Subjective, adn longer than I expected when I started:
---
Conditions: 15 base STR, plus STR for armor, underarmor, and mutations, martial artist maxed, and not under the influence of drugs, foods or other performance enhancers.
---
speed demon and twisted muscles.
---
I like switchblades - IIRC, they are 0.3#.  Very cheap to repair.
---
My standard speed (vamire) switchblade hits about 3x in the same time frame it takes a grognak or super sledge to hit once.  
---
The latter 2 do about 180 dmg per hit.  
---
The switchblade has been modded for a serrated blade, and does 80ish per hit.
---
It hits 3x in the same time frame it takes a sledge or grognak to hit once, so 
---
80x3=240 vs 180x1=180.
---
It can also stagger.  Because it makes the enemy pause, I can get enough hits in to kill a mob, which is something I cannot do with a super sledge or grognak.  I will usually die if armed with a sledge or pretty much any medium or slow weapon) if I engage  a mob.
---
My FSS switchblade hits approx 3x in a bit under 1-1/2 seconds.
---
With the FSS ghould slayers, I can take on 5 bloated glowing ones and they are all dead in what seems like 10 seconds.  That one will 1hit a L42 ghoul and 2-3 hit both L58 and L62 charred.  Have not power attacked with this one yet. At 200% repair, it will last more than 2 full circuits of WS cottage/clubhouse.
---
Power attacks - depending on which switchblade I use (I have several), I‚Äôve seen power attacks in the mid 500s.
---
That help clear it up?
---
Hello friend!
---
Block them, leave server, join a new one. It's that easy.
---
Yeah I've never seen one either (Level 149) and I've been putting in hours every day for this Legendary Run...still no sightings.
---
I'm now at 30 crafted SS chest pieces not one fricking vanguard.  It's almost not worth it as all I do is have to scrap the armor since i cannot script it all each day and it just wastes my scrap.
---
I found him buried up to his neck by the gates to foundation once. I think the raiders were just fucking with him at that point.
---
Nah most of the community is pretty good you will find a Ahole or scammer here and there but mostly great people. 
---
If somebody comes and try‚Äôs to fight you just ignore them they will leave eventually and never fight near your camp it allows them to destroy it but you can repair everything if you go to the C.A.M.P machine and press repair all. 
---
You will also see a lot of high levels give out freebies etc. 
---
And lastly sorry that guy ruined it but you find one piece of trash  who can‚Äôt compete in their own levels so they try bully low levels but they can‚Äôt do nothing if you ignore them or just leave the server and go to a new one.
---
If you are on Xbox shoot me you‚Äôre gamer tag I will fix you‚Äôre camp up for the free I have plenty materials
---
You're playing too much dude. Your post is basically "I've done everything the game offers, why is there nothing else to do?" Games can't be infinite unfortunately
---
Oi, don't u dare shit talk Maxson or I'll use my vertibirds made out of Cork Scrap to hunt you down.
---
Not in the mood to get into a tit-for-tat, NW is all about finding that particular edge that works best for you, arguing that NW is balanced: disagree That short term available items shouldn‚Äôt be allowed: disagree, when I can‚Äôt be on board with anything you‚Äôve said the math equals, pointless to argue
---
Just like in SWTOR.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the endless ghillie suits
---
Yep u found a moron. Sorry about that. Pacifist mode as others have said he can spend as much time as he likes attacking Yiu he won‚Äôt do jack.
---
The event would still continue with none of the rewards is my assumption.
---
I would love to play WoW again. My gaming PC bit the dust a few years ago and I replaced it with a console.
---
Kinda mushy, muddy snow. The year I went it didn't have much but they've said some years they've had quite a bit and some they have none at all.
---
Thanks, I really appreciate the offer.  I'm on PC though.  I'm really glad to see the community on here seems more helpful than toxic.
---
Unless you are wack and run bloodied and junkies at the same time
---
Swing speed determines how many hits on an enemy you can land. Granted if you have lets say a combat knife, ukl be able to strike a ghoul 3 times before it gets a hit in, were as a super sledge will net you 1 hit. However keep in mind that with a proper melee build with full perks ull be one shotting most things. My recommendation is then to find a weapon that deals sufficient damage for its swing speed when it comes down to fighting a boss enemy. Example being the super sledge for the slow weapons. Give it faster swing speed with martial artist and a legendary preffix, and ull be doing rlly good damage overall.
---
You can join private teams now, team pop was disabled with the public teams update, worst they can do it build stuff in your camp.
---
MODUS, get the nukes.
---
I have 2 characters. 1 is level 280 and exclusively uses PA. I haven't had regular armor for him since level 15. The other is level 200 and doesn't have a suit at all.
---
Do you mean the image of the power armor helmet on the main screen of the game? I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs a similar one in the legendary run.
---
I‚Äôm going to totally agree. I feel that if they added a finger emote that it would a level of toxicity to that game that is honestly not needed. We have created a Super Rare community of people that genuinely nice to each other for the most part. A ton of people running around giving each other the finger isn‚Äôt going to help.
---
Game pass.  Ive added it to the firewall exception list, opened all the ports, my NAT is open, and still wont let me in.
---
Meat week should be coming up in a couple weeks and colossal problem tomorrow, so SHOULD be some new content to enjoy for a bit
---
Ah thats great news. 
---
But yes, building stuff in your camp is currently still a huge issue. Many players are breaking others camps by placing glitched ammo factories
---
Read the latest in bethesda news, junk collecting event in prep for BoS arrival. Cork is has the same target as other materials but is much harder to collect
---
I think it's stupid they even have it in the game yet
---
Send me ur igns I can easily build u guys a decent CAMP and I love helping new guys up.
---
I tried to go onto their site but it wasn't working, so when is it happening?
---
Nope, I prefer a mix of Zealots and Troubleshooters primarily.  Makes a good set for encryptid, silos and scorched earth.
---
It‚Äôll complete anyway to give a false sense of community involvement just like the scorchbeast one.
---
Thank you sir. I will be there in my finest tattered rags.
---
I wonder if Bethesda will ever do a community driven story event. Something where the community controls the outcome and will have lasting effects
---
Why not the amount of resources needed absolutely earn you a 3 star
---
 I Found him sleeping midair...
---
We really need some new emotes, the ones we have are practically useless except a few. I'd be happy to have at least a laughing emote even if I have to buy it.
---
Ive only heard of it on reddit.. never experienced or saw it in game
---
of course some peoples definition of griefing differs greatly from my own...
---
I worked out with gold bullion, it‚Äôs would take max of 45 weeks of non stop playing to get every item including the 300 gold bullion a week
---
What kind of materials do you need? I have a bunch and am on PC. I you wanna send me your username I'll log in and gift you some.
---
Did you install the game in your main Drive? I heard there's issues with it if u install it in a secondary drive.
---
I've seen heaps of one shotters but generally they're cool enough to let the fight go for a minute or two, and save everyone a ton of ammo by ending the fight earlier. This is actually appreciate in a way. 
---
Those L80 might have been alt accounts after this whole banwave. It's hard to say.
---
With little pee pees.
---
They could change it to ''Gain one Level Up'' or ''Gain X amount of Experience'', whichever you complete first awards the SCORE points that day. Most days I complete it by leveling up a low level mule character, since it takes me like 1/20 of the time.
---
Imma assume they'll just give us the rewards anyways.
---
Nah don't think so. It's just a real quick way to get muted by a lot of people.
---
If you're just playing it for friends that's fine, but if you're just spamming area chat with your music then that's not really cool. Mic spam of any kind is poor etiquette in any online game.
---
So you saved up 400 modules at 3 a day or just over 4 months without crafting a single piece. Let‚Äôs say we believe that. U then moan that u now are over weight with armour that you knew you couldn‚Äôt scrip more than 6 3* a day? If I believed you. Which I don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs got to be the thickest thing I‚Äôve ever heard anyone bitch about. Congratulations you win bellend of the year 2020
---
I am going to specifically repair it every server I join now. /s
---
kill BOS agent (0/1) S.C.O.R.E 250 will happen
---
If that is the case the game in unplayable for me.  My bootdrive does not have enough room for it.  That's what I get for being an early adopter of m.2
---
Long time ex-player here. I stopped playing a little while ago when seasons started (bad imo). But I can honestly say it was mainly the community that kept me playing since beta. FO76 has one of the best player bases I think, and most are glad to help (as a hi-lvl helping low lvl and new players is great fun). A few tips though. Don't accept random team invites. Common tactic is for someone to join your team- then they attack a hi-lvl friend in hiding close by. This puts you and your team in auto pvp with the hi-lvl. Then they trash your camp. Also unsure if splash dmg is still a thing. Some mutations (electrical one I forget name) can dmg a player if stood near them - triggering pvp. Also make sure pacifist mode is on (especially in events to prevent hitting a player and causing pvp. Lastly ... good luck and have fun :). It is a great game. I'm just waiting for a little more endgame content and rework of the grind system is all.
---
Less about shooting her and more about standing on top of objects too small for her to land on if she targets that player (fence, tent, V9, etc)
---
Shooting her is fine so long as it's not throwing her into the stagger animation
---
Ideally everyone would be on the ground in open terrain, but that'll never happen on a public world
---

---
Destiny 2 does not have these limitations and I love it for that
---
Honest opinion from me, I could easily reach end game in a week or get a roll away from end game. Fuck me when I first got the game, it took me 3 days to get my main missions and level 50 so it‚Äôs really not hard
---
Btw this isn‚Äôt even with glitches, I could do it even faster with glitches
---
One other option would be for them to find out about the Enclave in Whitesprings from the vault dwellers and then you work with one side to take out the other. Then assume lore-wise that chapter goes quiet and sits on the nukes or destroys them all. I don't know how else to explain their lack of involvement in any East Coast stuff or The Pitt.
---
Indeed.
---
Beth=Spaghetti code.
---
Ah such a love/hate relationship I have. üò¢
---
Heavy gunner, nerd rage and bloody mess. Heavy gunner perks gives you a total of +60% damage if you have all three max level. Nerd rage gives you more damage while below 20% health. Bloody mess gives you an extra 15% damage when maxed out.
---
Working with the dirty Wasteland outsiders? Disgusting...
---
I'd appreciate a "stop" emote.
---
Yeah the worst part is I forgot to add, I can't break it again by shooting it either. Forgot to add that up there.
---
Ok so from what i was told and going off the on screen details the only excavator pieces are the arms. Maybe thats the issue...
---
Sent
---
Yep should just be able to roll infinite scrip until we get what we want.
---
It happens. Not often but it happens.
---
Plus people can still use nukes to destroy your camps even without PvP.
---
There was a fix released for it, though I dont know the details, I would suggest Googling it, and if it doesn't work try a refund and you can get it on steam (works flawless  for me)
---
Only if you let it.
---
I am not the one on trial here.
---
And for the record. Full time with a long commute (for a brit)
---
Unfortunately I foresee 3 more hours in your future rebuilding your camp out of its range
---
I sometimes nuke on public thinking it‚Äôs a private and end up killing the queen almost at the start, I try not to do it on public but sometimes I just forget. People get annoyed but if it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs nuke I don‚Äôt just kill the queen in under 10 seconds. I tend to wait until Regen and let her get to 75% again then I kill. Or I just use a non op weapon. I‚Äôve had people steal silos from me and kill the queen within 5 seconds of her landing. I feel bad for people that can‚Äôt deal enough damage to her to get loot. Also, has anyone recently done scorched earth, got loot from the queen, but the event didn‚Äôt give you flux or Ultracite scrap?
---
I fully agree. Do the daily‚Äôs, finish weekly challenges , do both foundation and crater, trade out my scrip and play some NW to level up. Then I go to fallout 4 to shoot the shit with nick and piper at sanctuary and listen to Travis. This score thing is a total stall for us to wait while you make a new quest that will take everyone  2 weeks to get all that brotherhood loot. I‚Äôm trying to get a few plans from vendors and I have around 5,000 and oh wait, that plan cost 10,000 caps? Wtf. I can only get 1400 caps from vendors and completing all daily quests gets me to around 2500 caps. In previous fallout games you never had a cap limit,  never had any subscription service and never had a stupid atom shop. I am a fallout fan, love the lore and games but 76 has gone to fucking far. Please listen to us Todd, and change the game. Instead of the atom shop, get a creation club and change the challenges from 20 atoms to 40 or 50. Stop being greedy for that sweet green and stop the limits.
---
Man imagine if people stopped being scared to use voice chat hoe much easier it would be to get these ideas across during the event.
---
Agree
---
\+1 Yes Please!
---
This is a problem with so many games and the entire industry, with regular games trying to model themselves after Mobile games (at the same time, there's no excuse for microtransactions outside of f2p games, and no, the "cosmetic only" argument for mtx in paid games is still a failed argument lmao)
---
Anyways, same.  I WANT to love 76, i enjoy playing it with people on frienda list, but i do NOT WANT to feel the pressure to log in every day for challenges for a season pass mobile style system that's even worse than the daily/weekly atom challenges we used to have which were outright better for atom earning (and CHOOSING your rewards instead of beth throwing trash at you) even though it's a paid game and shouldn't have ANY mtx at all.
---
If a paid game wants continued revenue after it's release, it should make expansions, and a game only deserves to charge for expansions if the base game wasn't a pathetic bug ridden mess like 76 was and still is.
---
Ok! i will be on in a couple of hours tho. Sometimes invitations bug, if so ill let u know
---
This is perfect for aholes that go to workshops to kill levels below 10 when they are 200
---
Yeah that's why I'm not playing right now lol
---
God the TENTS. Enough tents people surely one's enough they're all the fucking same tent....
---
Poor bitch ain't got a scrap of land to touch down because it's a refugee camp.
---
As a tent user put it at the eastern edge of the map and you're not gonna mess up the fight area. And for the fatties its still within winded walking distance and there's no stairs.
---
Okay should be around all day don't work today.
---
It was free on game pass.  I wanted to try it.  This is a great way to get people interested.
---
Because MMO isn't a specific game type. But it has specific design features.
---
This was beautiful. I really like playing this game. I play it daily, but you just summed up every single problem I have with this game, outside of the lack of any real endgame content and the persistent bugs. 
---
I really want to recommend this game to friends, but I can‚Äôt in good conscience do that. I just can‚Äôt. Bethesda has found every conceivable way to double down on pushing away any and every player with a passing interest in this broken game.
---
Yeah I saw with my work schedule and being forced to life things I wasn't gonna make it so I went hard to lvl50 or so then bought the rest with stock piled atoms.  You still get your dailies and weeklies. But aside from that warm.fuzzy feeling of seeing it tick as complete you don't get anything else.
---
That is a whole lot of nothing being said by you.  Still waiting on those details about game develop time and resources.
---
I've often wondered what a different game Fallout 76 would be if the people who work on it or upper management actually played it compared to what we have now.
---
Nothing will happen except a barrage of recriminations and abuse. But for sure:
---
1. It'll be Bethesdas fault.
---
2. Devs will be called lazy and/or incompetent 
---
3. See 1 &amp; 2
---
So normal Reddit life.
---
I don't have a mic, and don't always have the ability to be vocal. Text chat would be nice
---
(... Dupes AA battery somehow so there's now two batteries hammering your camp.....)
---
Haven't tried with melons, but the best way for say corn is blueprint 2 at an angle to each other. One has the normal collision, but the second can be placed real close. I blueprinted a whole planter so didn't have to fiddle with it again.
---
This was really the intent of my post, to make people aware that they can still come out ahead if they‚Äôre getting close, but know they won‚Äôt make it. Im fairly certain I‚Äôll be cutting it close myself unless the bonus score events get me a little further ahead. If I‚Äôm level 97 on the last day, I‚Äôm pretty certain I‚Äôll buy the last three levels so I come out 50 atoms ahead, but if I‚Äôm 96? I might not...
---
Thank you for posting this.  It's posts like yours remind me to stay away from this title.  I visit here every now and then, to check on things, how the game is being supported, fixed etc hoping one day I will see something that will convince me to jump on board.  
---
I feel your frustration, and I don't want to feel that way myself.  That's not what games should be made for, it should be fun to play. 
---
I will not support such developer practices with my money.  Sadly, my list of this type of games grows longer and longer.
---
I had an enemy bug out on me after I killed him and he didn't explode but his insides did become outsides leaving this [nightmare of a thing](https://imgur.com/XluCQ31). I think it was caused by bloody mess but not 100%. It's like his body went to explode but glitched at the start

How about *in the game* instead of in the shop?

I like when the town (Ward included) congregates around that fuckin horrendous 'band' playing the most savage hillbilly music I ever heard.

There's not nearly enough shine in WV to make that sound good. Meanwhile I'm trying to break Wards attention from the calamity so he can do his job for a second.

Best legacy out there! Thx mate, you are right.
---
I have yet to see her refuse to land when people don‚Äôt fire on her either. Sometimes there‚Äôs 10 of us on the fence, but the difference is we‚Äôre not staggering her over and over. 
---
I get it, people want to get their damage in so they get loot, but I get mine by waiting until she lands.

haha thats why i clicked

That‚Äôs why I start all my timers first thing in the morning. I start my vendor, scrip, and gold bullion timers and try to do my resource runs (lead, salt, copper, etc.) All before 10 AM (EST) so that everything will be reset by 6 AM the next morning. That gives me just enough time before I leave for work to start all of the 20hr timers. 
---
TL;DR - Start all 20hr timers in the morning before 10 AM, finish them in the afternoon/evening, they‚Äôre reset the next morning. Wash, rinse, repeat.
---
Lmao I was bad in 4 myself. I would save every... Single... Item... I had different stash boxes for different things. It was pure insanity but I enjoy it for some reason.
---
These posts are hilarious. Gave you an upvote.
---
Idec about scrip and cap and bullion limits i just want to be able to hold more stash shit without having to drop everything so i can hold more scrap to craft stuff I'll have to drop to craft more stuff, just let us have a decent inventory already
---
I agree that tons of tents are a problem. But I get why people who don‚Äôt know better might want their own tent to stand on: they‚Äôre using an explosive heavy weapon and will kill themselves if anything walks right in front of them while they‚Äôre firing.
---
Your title is wrong. This video is not a "must watch". If you want Bethesda to listen to this opinion that obviously came from somewhere else other than your head, you really shouldn't ramble on talking shit about them for 75% of your video. Nice effort though, you'll get them next time!
---
What‚Äôs encrypted?

I leave one of my water purifiers unlocked so anyone passing through can take some, people still go and unlock the other two.

I took the Percepti-Bobble perk and found that unlike magazines the vast majority of bobbleheads are hidden extremely well in places you would never see them normally. Some are in such ridiculous areas that I can't imagine anyone would ever find them without the perk.
---
How about no more crap we can't sell or transfer.
---
This is why most people play on private servers and why the games getting more empty.
---
If the odds are just a flat 3* item the system can be easily taken advantage of. SBQ is already very easy to beat for specific builds or magic weapons, and a lot of players can farm her quickly in private servers. and if it‚Äôs every 3* then it would make the grind for soul bound gear useless - which has been Bethesda‚Äôs goal with wastelander‚Äôs onward. 
---
The odds should increase with difficulty for sure, but a guaranteed 3* would most likely just lead to issues similar to the duping problems they‚Äôve struggled to control.
---
Just because it has a chance to spawn somewhere doesn't mean it will or someone else possibly found it
---
A lot of people farm them and they don't usually spawn (they have like a chance to spawn), so just depends on luck. You'll find them eventually.
---
Capitalists....trade is the life blood of a rebuilt economy,
---
It isn't a an actual boss fight, it's more akin to a novelty teasing the actual event coming with patch 21.
---
If you want three star enemies/drops and you're going after the Colossus or SBQ you're fucking crazy when events like Riding Shotgun exist and can be farmed for a fraction of the effort.
---
Well isn't that stupid! I wonder what's the reasoning behind it? 
---
The 2* are nice in the early game when you haven't grinded that much but not later. I wonder why it does not have the same loot pool as the Purveyor.
---
So if you're short on materials but have plenty of caps, there is always the option to just "move" your camp even if it's just a few inches. It'll cost you 40 caps if you're leveled up a bit but it'll store entire camp and repair everything for you. (of course if you enter a server and "your camp could not be placed", then it'll be free which could save you from spending anything really)
---
Only issue aside from the cost of caps is that you'll have to set everything up again. If you had a house platform with a bunch of stuff on it, it'll save that entire thing as a single blueprint that you can just set down at once. Only thing then that you'll have to set back up manually are typically crops or anything that wasn't being "supported" by something.
---
Even though I'm on ps4, I'd be happy to help you guys with advice/suggestions if needed.
---
You‚Äôd be amazed, I‚Äôm building a nursery at the moment. And that seems to suggest my free time isn‚Äôt going to increase any time soon, either.
---
The level up challenge is badly designed, in part because the easiest way to complete it *every day* isn‚Äôt in normal play - it‚Äôs to spin up a burner character to do it instead.
---
The event should....for 99% of the players, 2* armor is nothing but 9 scrip.
---
Hmmm..... Still........ I more believe it's they don't wanna add control....
---
Not sure why you are getting down voted.   I did laugh.   I know the outcome of the quest but I could see some dude named Crane complaining an imposter stole his sign.  
---
It might be dark times guys, try to find the humor in little things.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll start finding them.
---
Most likely, someone else got there before you.  For example, there are 3 different spawn locations at Bolton Greens, but I only find 1 of the 3 about every 5th time I log in.
---
You can try server hopping a given location until you find one.
---
Alternately, you can buy them from player vendors.
---
Many players sell them for 75-100 caps.
---
Wait until you start hunting magazines :)
---
Me and Grahm once cleaned house together in Big Bend - before Wastelandeds, I mean! We walked through there together, smashing Scorched as a team. We parted ways at Watoga, with an unsaid understanding between warriors.
---
That's true! But then there's some nice Unyieldings and Vanguards and others in the mix but always 2*.
---
You can do Wastelanders in a couple hours, pick up an osmosis kit then just camp your alt in Foundation.  Log in once a day to auto-complete the Vital Equipment quest.  You'll have access tol SS armor and gauss shotgun in a month of just logging in for 30 seconds a day and occasionally using the bullion machine or fast travelling to pick up modules.
---
You dont really choose. Do both questlines until you get quests that say: side with crater/foundation. Doesnt really matter which one you go with as you grind out rep for a month or two afterwards in their dailies. Go for the one that have the rewards you want the fastest.

Nah, just send a tribal on a big boat to their base on an oil rig, that'll work.
---
Yes would be nice.
---
Ah I did not know that about 76. Thought once you had it the once that was it!
---
I found a camp selling what has to be  thousands of Nuka quantum for 1 cap each. Interesting marketing. I didn't buy any lol not taking any chances
---
Did you do this all on one server, because I feel that's where you should make a r/TIFU posting. Make a few on a server, get shit, go to another server and make a few, rinse and repeat. If you did all of that one one server, it's effectively the equivalent of standing in front of a brick wall and smashing your nose into it again and again.
---
Yes, this will ban you out of the internet, hopefully.
---
&gt; Less about shooting her and more about standing on top of objects too small for her to land on if she targets that player (fence, tent, V9, etc)
---
I've seen her land on top of V9 and tents, I wish people would stop spreading this misinformation. The SBQ is just a mess and nothing will change that short of Bethesda fixing her scripting.
---
They have been living off apalachilli they need some way to stop the brown tide.

it's simple, no cork no barrels, no barrels no water, no water no armada

If you have an NVIDIA video card, you can just set a framerate cap in the driver software.

no problem lol I forgot where I got it too
---
Can it ban irl too?
---
Is that glitch still alive? I thought it was patched.
---
WELLLLLLL! 
---
I'll allow it.
---
&gt;Lemme see...what time did I hit the robot vendors yesterday...got to wait 20 hours.  
---
&gt;What time did I unload my script weapons...got to wait 20 hours.  
---
&gt;Opps hit my 1400 caps for the day...got to wait 20 hours
---
They're all 20 hours.  Do them at the same time.
---
Lol... Hmmm...... if you really crafted that many, and if you really don‚Äôt want to drop them... maybe equip the perk in strength that reduces your armor weight by half? Then you would only be stuck with 650 pounds of trash armor. Then, drop/destroy all of the 1* armor you crafted. I‚Äôm sure at least a quarter or even a third of what you crafted is just 1* junk? So is it really worth keeping all those 1* pieces? Netting you only 3 scrip per piece? If you do that, then you might get back to normal carry weight in power armor. If you have calibrated shocks that is. Nice story though. ü§î
---
This happened to me once too. One of the funniest moments so far in this game.
---
I've had a quad auto tesla collecting dust in my stash since 2018
---
Excellent answer. I finally got a perfectly preserved pie from a machine. I know you can get one on the roof of the west tek, but finally getting one the honest way meant something to me.
---
Did they grow their own food in fallout 4? Nope. We are helping them in exchange for "protection" lol

Just promise me you won't scratch your nose with a shotgun.
---
The Mojave chapter was rsther different.   Elijah was completely like this to his own fault, and McNamara was definitely closeted and hoped to protect his own. 
---
However with Veronica, things got different.   And of course McNamara can change his views depending on your decision.   If you choose the one that evolves the BoS, you end up eradicating the last there that believe this way.  
---
But that's because Bethesda didn't write it, so there was character growth.
---
Edit:  Before people get upset on another Beth bash, lets be fair.  Obsidian knows how to make stellar role-playing (at that time and before).  They deconstruct what roleplaying is in a sensible way.  They just don't know how to finish a game
---
This same exact glitch happened to me last night
---
I‚Äôm level 9 and some twat killed me today just as I was about to finish a quest, they were level 115, not cool.
---
Honestly, you should check out the chat mod on Nexus. It‚Äôs made the game so much more enjoyable and it‚Äôs pretty easy to install
---
Im lvl 260 i can do it just about every day. Canned meat stew, well rested and lunchbox if you have it. Run west tech and the surrounding areas and white springs. Hop servers and repeat.
---
I'm surprised you waited 30 minutes for that really shitty event.
---
You mean this?
---
Neither. You do what all "PvP'ers" do in this game which is jump straight up and down shooting their Teslas at the ground while spamming Nuka Quantums.
---
Great idea. Ive been dropping them or selling them to vendors for caps. Im done carrying them. Been doing it for years.
---
Wait, so when she says she needs some space...?
---
It's something referred to as a "magic" weapon. There are certain legendary mods that cause shotguns and heavy weapons with 200+ RoF to do massive amounts of damage.
---
edit: basically a bug within the coding that cause certain mods to react in such a way. Doesn't always work the same for everyone and can bit a little inconsistent.
---
One Enclave, one America. Now and forever.
---
It's a kind of magic
---
the roadmap shows August 4th:  [https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4mPsYvLByiH9sFAAOEcMAq/6a81bc94d42fb2489f1eb5e445efa29f/76\_S1\_FullSize\_CommunityCalendar\_EN\_1920x1080.jpg](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4mPsYvLByiH9sFAAOEcMAq/6a81bc94d42fb2489f1eb5e445efa29f/76_S1_FullSize_CommunityCalendar_EN_1920x1080.jpg) 
---
but depending on when the update goes live and which timezone you are in this may differ for you
---
Magic shotgun I think, yes it should be, wait for someone else to comment to confirm
---
That‚Äôs a game changer if true. I know this glitch happens when you go to a second server, so if my camp is not able to be place I end up restarting the whole game to avoid this. If it doesn‚Äôt charge then it wouldn‚Äôt be as big a deal!
---
Bashing damage, limb damage and 33 VATS are "magical" or broken effects on shotguns right now. You can one shot most enemies, larger ones take a couple extra. Check out Angry Turtle on YouTube. He covers all the broken effects on ALL weapons. Not just shotguns.
---
I hate this song.....
---
The only reason timegating exists is to make you spend money on atomic shop items and fallout 1st,plain and simple,
---
It's a "magic" shotgun.  Search magic shotguns if you want to see more about it.
---
It's not very common, at least in my experience. Even if you do run into a griefer, their options are pretty limited. They can talk until you mute them, or shoot you for zero damage. They can only actually hurt you if you're in a workshop that you've claimed (not your own camp though), and even if that happens you can only lose junk items. 
---
I think I've received a grand total of about 90 minutes of "grief" in about 1200 hours of play. So, I wouldn't worry about it.
---
Note, if you're visibly female it can open you up to extra annoying attention, but nothing that can't be swiftly muted.
---
It's both. Tracking gets thrown when she can't land next to someone she argos against and staggers resets tracking
---
It‚Äôs why I stopped playing Destiny 2. The combination of time-gating and FOMO, didn‚Äôt kill the fun, but added an unnecessary level of stress and effort to every aspect of the game. 
---
Go to the tower and pick up daily/weekly bounties. Have a story mission on Mars? Pick up the three bounties, but it‚Äôs almost noon so they‚Äôre about to reset, go to all the planets and pick up the bounties. 
---
Want to get a seal? A Triumph? An Exotic? Add in another level of thought to your process. I need 1000 shotgun kills, 100 Gambit shotgun kills, and 100 Forge shotgun kills. 
---
It‚Äôs a shame because it would be so much fun if there wasn‚Äôt this mad rush to complete everything. There‚Äôs so much content and enjoyable grind already without adding more.
---
Yes, Todd Howard claims your house as his own personal workshop and puts level 4 locks on all the doors.
---
And he leaves a workbench by the open window *juuuuust* out of reach...to taunt you of course.
---
I was in the BOS, do you guys play ps4?
---
This is known but I would still like to know
---
I‚Äôve always wanted a laughing emote
---
I vote we have this added
---
Please tell me in FO3 you collected the plungers just from that one really... dark and weird plunger room.
---
The Enclave in WV basically have been dead for decades; any new ones showing up would either immediately get got by MODUS, or would try taking him down for murdering everyone. What I'm saying is, bringing him back would be tricky.
---
They cant keep annoyingly coming back to try and kill you untill you finally get killed if they could not seek revenge. I mean come on lol
---
Not had that issue but as a side note I highly recommend taking the easy option with the challenge and use a different/new character. 0-1 is far less hassle than 70+.
---
God I hope they wont turn out like the vault raids
---
It's okay as long as courtney love isn't around to pull the trigger
---
Damage is capped in PvP so the only way to increase DPS is by increasing fire rate or reducing reload speeds. Because of this I believe the Fixer pulls ahead slightly as it has a slightly faster reload speed if I'm not mistaken.
---
The difference probably isn't that great in practice however. Against most players you're going to down them in less than half a clip anyway, and team PvP is next to non-existent so it seems less important to be able to follow up for a second kill. There's also the firework mine "feature" that cuts your reload times in half making the difference between the two completely negligible.
---
This is why I miss the SINK in NV.  So much variety and intuitiveness on where you could horde.  All.my subsequent playthroughs I did OWB as fast as I could... and because I was lonely without the Stealth Suit.
---
EDIT:  Also because I miss Muggy whenever I play.
---
Yup I hated shotguns until I saw angry turtles video and started using the quad one I have. Amazing gun when it hits. I probably scripped so many magic shotguns because I hated them. Smh but the quad 1 shots almost everything. A 1 star scorch beast I think it was 2 shots to head and down
---
I can help if you still need it
---
Should have had this title and the body of the post should just have said "run" lol
---
Just works!
---
I have crafted about 50 ss armor pieces at the same station everytime..10 modules at a time I always get at least 1 unyielding that I'm looking for .at the moment I only have one leg that is 2 star just havent been back to tha workbench.if you saved 400 modules that blows to have all the weight drop it man it's a losing battle to login and scrip 150 at a time
---
People think everyone who plays the game differently than them is a griefer, so reddit will tell you it's out of control but really it's not very common
---
An emote to stop people holding aggro in the middle of the blast while everyone is stood outside waiting would be helpful. Can confirm follow, follow, angry, follow, spray in the face with explosive minigun isn't a big enough hint.
---
I agree heavily, and with disdain. I stopped playing after 100 hours when I realized the only way to play along with the loot system is to pay real money for storage. Realized it was useless to loot, useless to mod a bunch of weapons and armor, useless to get creative with my base building...
---
THERE ARE ROADBLOCKS AT EVERY PATH OF PLAY STYLE. Idiotic.
---
Oh then maybe it was just different for me (I live in Spain so maybe is because of the time zone), thanks!
---
Try attaching a current foundation to the existing one then scrapping the stairs and the foundation.
---
Yep. Killing a legendary before everyone gets to tag it or killing someone in a workshop is NOT griefing, it's the game
---
5 star weapons yeah right like the ability to make them has been in the from beta on. Oh wait....
---
Yeah well
---
1 don't use too many of them or you'll get craft locked 
---
2 5 vault steel per logon is painful
---
Man i loved the hell out of the Two-Step Goodbye.   Truly unique.
---
Beat me to it
---
Lol they should put "killing fuckers and collecting trash" right below the Bethesda logo from now on.
---
MMOs don‚Äôt typically cap your income or even amount of currency you can hold
---
Unless they‚Äôre f2p
---
Low level twins dawg......And I mean the Arnold And Devito twins.....lol......And Nahh I wish I'm on Xbox but I need people around my level......
---
I think there is a setting maybe? I've heard people in my area that is talking and not in my group.
---
Hope its ok. Did you put it in a shoebox and take it to the vet?
---
I know it's Bethesda we're talking about here, but I doubt they'll make THAT mistake again.
---
Download the fo76 interactive map- solves alot of problems
---
I really hope they understand that time restrictions cause bigger burn outs than people playing a lot
---
It becomes more exhausting when there‚Äôs time restrictions and you‚Äôre doing everything because it‚Äôs time not because you want to, and when you want to... you can‚Äôt anymore

Ally‚Äôs give loot? I thought they just *exist* at your camp and do nothing

I assume he is bugged. I ended up having to use a different ally so I could get the daily quest.

I have a heavy weapons character, started as a mule. Found that power armor is matched or exceeded by full sets of legendary gear and perk cards.
---
Everything from carry weight, damage resistance, radiation/stealth and quality of life. I keep my power armor sets as a stool to jump higher. Also as a way from getting unstuck in environmental glitches.
---
I love Grahm he comes past my place near Summerville about twice a week, and I always seem to bump in to him across the wasteland kicking someones ass :), when he comes past my place he usually crosses the bridge and the blood eagles pick a fight they can't finish, go's on for a good twenty minutes and I can hear the commotion while i'm doing stuff in my camp :P
---
One dream, one soul, one prize one goal...
---
Unsure on the levels. I am 280, and I don't really pay attention.   There's 1 sheepsquash at each area.  Probably going to be a high level.
---
If you have your audio set to ‚Äòteam‚Äô  and you‚Äôre not in a private chat, then yes.

I can hear you yelling at your husband to go let the dog in.

I can hear you asking your mom if dinner is ready. 
---
I can hear you arguing with your girlfriend... well, now ex-girlfriend. *Sorry for your loss, MistahLongJohnson420.*
---
I only had the arms as I was told that was all we needed
---
Or someone that one shots a legendary, when I was kiting it so lowbies could all get a hit in.
---
Same thing today, he one shot the legendary. So I decided I would I would follow him around the map with the üëéüèª emote untill he left the server. Followed him from the event, through his camp, spamming the üëéüèª non stop. He quit after about 5 minutes of my spam. 
---
It was worth my time. What an ass.
---
Maybe he kills enemies you didnt hit. You only get exp if you hit it as well I think
---
Me and my wife are about the same to and im a few ahead also. She has better gear tho.
---
Yep, seems neat can‚Äôt wait to help this week!
---
Higher intelligence, he gets more hits on certain mobs, etc. Wife is 3 levels ahead of me
---
He might be doing things like picking locks, hacking terminals, crafting etc that give him more xp
---
If you had a choice between J/25/15fr fixer or a J/E/15fr fixer, which would it be.
---
It could be a varience in INT value. I noticed I leveled up much quicker with high INT than my friend with low INT. Mutation and perk interactions could be affecting these values as well.
---
Things like your Intelligence and some foods as well as legendary effects boost your XP gain. Not too much but it stacks over time
---
Depends if you mind others taking stuff. If you dont mind other players taking stuff you dont need to lock them. But if you wanna keep it yourself, lock  it
---
Getting banned and wiped probably
---
There's a variety of possibilities. Like mentioned from debby, you're both could be not hitting all of the same enemies. Intelligence affects the amount of xp you get. There are buffs you can get from eating certain foods as well as from sleeping.
---
INT is higher? 
---
Does he play with unyielding armor?
---
I have been looking to acquire insurgent outfit and ran across your post. Was hoping you still were giving away outfit or wouldn't mind trading?
---
Starts Tuesday, after the update, so hop on then if you want to donate.

I just hope they limit the per person amount each day as the glitchers have probably millions of each type of scrap in their boxes at this point and the goal will be done in a day otherwise.
---
I'd rather have something like ESO's "flip the bird" emote.

AW YEAHHHHHHHHHHH
---
I mean I just eat Canned Stew, get my Lover's Embrace from Sophia and slap on Inspirational and I get a good boost to my xp boost.

i didnt have the secret service plans until recently. i saved until i had 4500 bullion before i bought the plans.

He cooks A LOT, could that be it?

He secretly ihas punching liberators when you sleep towards the kill 1100 robot's unarmed.
---
Intelligence affects xp. Tagging mobs, crafting, cooking and building. Will be why two people who play together are varying levels.
---
I found tadpole quite easy but grindy.
---
is this an edge case tho? youre telling me you make 1 piece of armor at a time?
---
I for one will not be donating. Each faction that has entered the game has required our help and what they give back is not worth the effort.
---
Ah I love it when I see someone try and steal my shit. My FE90 Rad Rifle teaches them a good lesson.
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt understand the people who are very vocal about not liking aspects of the game that don‚Äôt align with the one way they like to play the game. There are thousands and thousands of players who played very differently and the game is diverse enough to allow all of those different place styles, so why spend so much time and energy bitching about the things you don‚Äôt like. Of course, the server seems to hate everything about the game, so there‚Äôs that.
---
Everyone plays differently.
---
If you want to catch up, you could boost your xp by eating cranberry relish, being well rested, using the inspirational perk, or boosting your intelligence stat by whatever means. He probably did some of those things to have wound up ahead of you.
---
Fire rate. With damage caps and fireproof/dense you will get more bullets for pvp damage cap in a shorter time

ah shit, I did have a private party but my network cut out - forgot to set it up again when I reloaded...

---
I had a high level bloodied contest my workshop today, then walk right out into the open and check their pip boy.  Then when I checked took their loot, it was way more than I could even got in my stash box.  
---
Did they not know they were contesting my workshop or something?   I was literally just defending the workshop and logging off too.  Sucks for them.
---
It also depends on their settings. As you can mute everything if you want, as I often do because I get tired of hearing people yell or eat, eating is the worst! So it's entirely possible that no one heard you or they muted you pretty quickly if it bothered them.
---
On the gripping hand, if they want to encourage time-in-game, a ‚Äúplay for x minutes‚Äù challenge would do, too. ‚ÄúLevel up!‚Äù is a blunt instrument.
---
Ok, did you repeatedly hit the collect button or just once on each ore? Also what platform since I can show you my route
---
So? It's not like you get much out of killing the SB. You get more xp killing the horde of scorched
---
I played a few dozen hours of NV and I loved it. Id like to play it through again. I've been bouncing back to 4 lately but I'm itching for either 3 or NV soon.
---
Um what?
---
If I may ask, what is a B2525?
---
The extractors only generate a certain amount of whatever it is, and then they're full until you stop by to empty them out. Unless you plan on stopping by camp frequently to get the stuff, locking them could just waste their potential. Lots of players are too nice to take something even from an unlocked extractor, anyway.
---
Lone Wanderer does not work when you are in a public team, even when you are alone there. But as replacement you can use Empath mutation with perks Class Freak and Strange in Numbers. You take 8% more damage (reduced by Class Freak), but it also gives 33% damage resist to all team members (including you). So you get 25% damage resist from it. But Empath mutation requires at least one other person in your team. Also some other team perks like Inspirational and Strange in Numbers only work when you are not alone in a public team.
---
Could be a duper but honestly, not sure of a high luck is.involved or not, but I got a ton of Nuka Cherries.  Way more than Quantum....  i could see a high level dude just wanting them gone for stash space (Yes I also horde my Nuka Colas).
---
Also during Fasnacht before I knew about duping I received about a thousand Mounted Head plans from a drop.   Still here.  I don't dupe, but yeah, surprised if they didn't flag my account before they realized how much of a noob I was.
---
Yep, that adds up more than you‚Äôd think.   A significant portion of my xp earned is from crafting and cooking.   I use the super duper perk, so I always cook every bit of everything I get, in a full day of play I‚Äôll get at least one level and max vendor caps just from that.
---
Raven Rock will be disappointed.
---
No I spammed collect until the ore disappeared from the node and then went to the next. I am on xbox, i know it did the sound effect as if you picked up multiples so i know it was at least appearing to collect
---
No opinion about this itself, all I know is if someone invites you to something called BoS;E or Brotherhood of Steel Exodus, don‚Äôt join, just trust me.
---
Set the nuke to go off with the center on prime, when there isn't anywhere safe to hide from rads everyone just charges her. It's a much more pleasant and chaotic experience.

Damn!!

I have the paintings in my camps since the beginning of 76. Hell, I even had them in Fallout 4 settlements. Now I'll feel a little bit sad everytime I see them. I know that this kitty will be immortalized in the games forever, but... I feel so sad, when I remember some kitty passing away, even if it's not mine.
---
Lies! MODUS sicked it's fascist thugs and assaultrons against my base! BOS forever!

---
But as long as the Atom Store stock keeps coming! üôÑ
---
Ok, I can show you my route I a couple hours if you want. I probably won‚Äôt be picking any up since I still have a good bit of ore remaining. But the might have been some you missed, also when you spammed collect so you remember if it said lead ore(1) or lead ore(4)?
---
I'm getting so, SO frustrated at the cap limit. Constantly selling, buying, and shutting my vendors down. Countless times I've lost money because a player bought two expensive items before I could shit the power off. I bought 15 3 star weps to scrip and now I have no stash space, I'm overencumbered, and I hit the limit after 3 guns scripted. Thats not even including the trash i find when i play that i now have to hold onto. So now im dropping heavier legendaries and losing scrip. This makes no sense to me. Let us have a weekly limit at least, not a daily.

Ol‚Äô Ward...he ain‚Äôt quite right.
---
Now I‚Äôm sad for your sick pupper. I hope they feel better soon.
---
This right here is why reddit is a joke
---
PLEASE.
---
Calibrated shocks for ultracite are really rare sbq drops. Hopefully someone has them and are willing to help
---
actually wasn‚Äôt i have no idea what‚Äôs wrong at all
---
You could always use the report player. A dick move deserves a dick move back
---
Some form of interrogation is warranted.
---
I don't get what you mean
---
And what about those who won't be online or put some in, do they still benefit?
---
Totally misinformation, I have yet to see proof that standing on tents or fence causes the sbq not to land...
---
People be guessing
---
We need a lot of emotes added. Most don‚Äôt use headsets in this game, emotes are pretty much all we have and basically we have to interpret ‚Äúhello‚Äù and ‚Äúfollow me‚Äù to mean too many different things.
---
This is why i stopped playing fallout 76.
---
This game has a worse grind than a free to play game.
---
We paid for this game, it should be enjoyable. This game is like the opposite of enjoyable for me and a lot of other people
---
Jesus. 64 comments. Still no attention. 2 months old. I‚Äôve quit since then, with no other content to explore other than Daguerre. Good luck brotha.
---
Happens to me when I've moved my camp and placed a stored ally. You usually need to scrap it and place it down again
---
Yeah some days I log in and they just show as a location. Some days it‚Äôs a workshop but won‚Äôt show me if it‚Äôs owned. 
---
It‚Äôs a crapshoot.
---
Haha. The person next to me probably thought so. ‚òπÔ∏è
---
You can have more people on a map in CoD than you can in fo76...
---
I‚Äôve always marked it for pickup.  I use it to mod scrip armor with an ultralight mod to drastically reduce its weight, and cork is uncommon junk.  I probably have 3-4K in storage.
---
Well at least he still has his appetite.
---
your inventory got wiped? I've heard most people got to keep it
---
honestly thank you, ive got my fingers crossed for muting then 
---
mate i can‚Äôt even eat when I‚Äôm on chat! usually I‚Äôm bothered about whether people are hearing my heavy breathing never mind getting on like this
---
Amen brother!
---
They can try. I love watching power armor explode when you hit fusion cores. üòÄ
---
Not OP, but yes, I make one piece at a time.  And I make sure my Intelligence is as high as possible before doing so to maximize base durability.
---
Hmm, only I didn't move my camp, and I already scrapped it and placed it again
---
Time for that mouth harp to "go missing".
---
Not just my inventory, my entire motherfucking account. All five characters, just *gone*
---
üëÅüëÅüëÖüëÅüëÅ
---
Well, it is a more selfish use for all this concrete I was thinking about giving to the tin cans... I dunno, do I have to pay taxes?
---
Odd, what ally is having this issue?
---
Boom
---
Deguerre
---
I've noticed this bug coincides with another issue. When the workshops show on the map as locations, not workshops, you won't have map markers for events like Leader of the Pack, where there would normally be 3 pack markers on the map so you know where/what order to go.  
---
It's frustrating to deal with. I basically concede as soon as my map shows the regular location markers now.. which is every other day.
---
I spent 20 minutes following it all the way to a house in Harper‚Äôs Ferry, where it got stuck in a loop, unable to navigate up a house porch
---
Aw she‚Äôs good don't worry - she‚Äôs an old dog with a temperamental stomach! Just need to make sure shes okay before it happens
---
Hmm, have you tested having another ally and seeing if they have the same issue?
---
It comes off as a bra burning femaninst question, where unless you agree, you're a male shovanist. Apologies if I'm incorrect, that's just how it appears...
---
I finally have a weapon I can do some Vats damage with and kite her away from the tent riders. Hit a couple scorched to build up the meter and crit her in vats with the right perks and she'll follow you anywhere. Gotta treat a queen right.
---
It won't happen. No matter how mature a game is, the ways players are able to communicate with their avatars in online games have always been neutered. For example, you can't use the word "Ass" in a GTA Online Crew or Organization. In Mortal Kombat 11, you can't name your custom creation using the words "Damn" or even "Hell." In this game, the PVP emote to tell other players that you want to fight, is simply a western finger guns mime in the tamest way possible. The most offensive thing you can do aside from what you can do in any game with your voice or harassing players with your avatar, is thumbing them down. Sad fact is, that when it comes to player interaction, devs are too afraid to give players any tools to upset each other that could cause any kind of controversy or at the very least, cause some players to stop playing. It's just the way it is and the way it always will be for AAA games.
---
Damn, I'll pour one out for you. Mind a few questions? Did you spend money on the game? I have this theory that Beth won't ban people that spend lots on fo1 or Atoms. Also, if you had to estimate, did you dupe a lot or just a bit compared to other people?
---
Same. Where's the emote for, "sorry, the map is bugged, my bad?"
---
Yeah what we need is for Bethesda to add multiple long good questlines
---
I'd go explosive personally. The E effect gives the weapon a chance to stagger and also adds an additional (albeit somewhat weak) AOE hit that is separate from the base damage. I find the AOE damage useful for pinpointing a stealthed enemies location.
---
25FFR is a good effect, but in my opinion is more beneficial for PvE than PvP. Having a faster fire rate on your rifle only matters if you're actually hitting your shots. With VATS being broken in PvP it's much harder to nail nearly every shot in your clip so I find it hard to justify FFR over E.
---
In the end I think it's mainly preference. Both are top tier effects and I believe an argument could be made for either of them.
---
[](/cooldash)[Loyalty Until Death!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7lG5A4Z_OY)
---
Wow.
---
I think it also depends on the tent placement. If she's doing crop dusting underground (land shark!) there's probably a tent with bad placement.
---
Yes, but no, but yes. It will automatically blueprint your camp when you move it, so that in theory you can just place the same structures again in the new location. The auto blueprints are slightly stupid, though, and some stuff like wiring etc gets broken. 
---
You won't have to start from scratch, but it'll still take some work.
---
Sounds a lot like the Mr. Fuzzy stuff
---
Not to my knowledge. Explosive Harpoons, yes now legacy. 
---
What I heard about railway rifles, is there is no ability mod them to automatic now. All 5 railways I have are auto, and even have the auto plan still. Will have to craft and see if I'm still able to mod it to auto.
---
You must not be the one putting out the most damage then... Thought about tweaking your build?
---
Well, i guess its time to change a few wall decos in my camps in honor of this little fuzzy fellow...
---
Ooof yeah some level 150 was selling, standard outfits by bulk, casual wear, slacks etc
---
No I just got one a couple of weeks ago, it was a supressors explosive, I just scripped it last week.
---
I am a Fallout 1st subscriber, or was until they pulled that bullshit. And I *highly* doubt I exploited this as much as most people. I duped so I can trade for legacies and that I don‚Äôt have yet, and I actually got surprisingly few orders despite selling these things for caps.
---
My guess is that they are probably judging their own success based on the volume of daily active users or some shit like that, which incentivised them to use black hat gamification techniques to emotionally attach you to the daily grind without caring whether you actually are enjoying yourself.
---
If you measure the wrong thing, you do the wrong thing.
---
Ah good to know. Thanks!
---
My first one was a furious and never used it but then I learned the automatic mod and it‚Äôs a beast in vats against the queen I might‚Äôve had more but never liked them. Wish I would‚Äôve known better. I also have a 2 star Instigating explosive railway
---
Companions were the best in Fallout 1 where they would spend the entire game with you and then politely walk into a laser door to be incinerated so you could have a proper final confrontation with the big boss of the game.   
---
What I'm saying is; Have Sofia be incinerated whenever you are joining an event.
---
The only time mole rats rock
---
I'm guessing that when these BOS "challenges" are released they will actually be auto-completed. We just have to make sure everyone logs off playing NW before they release this new patch :)
---
its a great spot for loot.. id hate to see it go away
---
You guys come of with these ridiculous theories and then spread them as fact. Don‚Äôt get salty, Chief. Just get better.
---
Could be op is a man too xd
---
Literally how, I have maxed out strength, maxed output with radicool and full unyielding and I top off at 430. What am I doing wrong?
---
If you see 100 ammo munitions resource devices...I say take it
---
You're stupid
---
They're building a giant corkboard. After they get killed off again, they want a centralized location to leave environmental storytelling notes for future generations of players.
---
I just want you to know that you're right.
---
And regardless of what the community thinks. Beth wants to treat it like an mmo
---
I already said if your actively participating(fighting) in event you should get loot.
---
It's not nearly as obvious as this game. I can't think of another game I play where I cab reach a point where I can longer progress each day
---
It‚Äôs because one idiot makes up some theory and other idiots start spreading it as fact. If you can‚Äôt replicate the issue using one of their 100 made up theories then they don‚Äôt exist. I mean we‚Äôre seeing it live now. The theory was standing on tents stops her. That‚Äôs an obvious lie. Now it‚Äôs standing on a fence or tent, and doing the most damage. Also false.
---
Plus on the first go around , the 2nd person to attack has a HUGE advantage so a round 2 is only fair
---
Seriously we need one. Just for the douche's out there because there out there @Bethesda üí©üí©üí©‚úä‚úä‚úä
---
Thanks for the considered opinion/educated reply. You based in US I assume?
---
Graham saved my life once before Wastelanders from Ghouls near the fissure in the road south of White spring.  I was being overrun when he came charging out of the bushes knocking out ghouls like bowling pins.
---
Yeah but like just down near the lake....
---
Yes, but those wouldn't be dailys like the Mr fuzzy stuff and the rewards would be random. The tokens are already there in the game and it would give them a purpose.
---
Make them the actual legendary weapons from the series.
---
Like ‚Äúthat gun‚Äù, ‚Äúvengeance‚Äù, etc.
---
its currently bugged and cannot drop right now
---
Harder, maybe (in that steel is stupid easy) but by no means hard. Golf balls scrap for cork and there's a near infinite number of them around the white springs, since it is.... A golf course. The only real difference is that it's more of a world drop than a mob drop, which means picking it up as you go rather than taking it off the corpse of the thing that you were killing anyways. Since many people already farm the area for xp anyways, it'll add a little bit more time to the loop to grab all of the golf balls sitting around the displays and in baskets.
---
 im gonna scrip it, its just ridiculous how long its going to take. i had figured i would just drop everything once i got the legendaries i wanted, but to not get anything i wanted after wasting so many legendary modules hurts my soul. 
---
i have no choice but to scrip it all and buy more modules. absolutely disgusting. 
---
btw, when i crafted my vault 94 armor, i only used like 50 legendary modules and got everything i wanted.
---
I have honestly never used it except to mine lead.
---
The other sorts I upgrade then put them in my stash for no reason whatsoever.
---
Do you think so?
---
I'm literally asking in the game what could cause the huge level difference. Stop reading into it.
---
They seem totally random, though all 3 star weapons. 
---
If the rng seed thing of popular legend is true, they're probably affected just like legendaries from Mmurgh.
---
I can confirm that you can buy it at Le Grand Gourmet inside Whitesprings.
---
No, I had an executioner's explosive drop a few days ago
---
They could just make her actually hard to kill. As is now she just a bullet sponge. I've only ever died from falling in fissures not her. And why they haven't nerfed builds idk
---
Of course it is. I wouldn't have made my character the way I did if I had known that 90% of the items I'm looking for are either bugged or are only rumoured to exist.
---
Everything would indicate that either the First Expeditionary force never regained contact with Lost Hills, or that they're written off in whatever takes place during Fractured Steel.
---
Bethesda hears you. They're cooking up a vertibird skin for the survival tent right now, only 1200 atoms.
---
Not to forget all the mounted animal plans.
---
k
---
That's a good point, maybe there could be some type of "clean up Tyler county fairgrounds" and have that as a 3 times a week type of thing. Just an idea lol.
---
Chally Milk is the best milk.
---
They have extended the scrip allowance at least with quests and events granting script now too!
---
I did reject them and I joined the Free States.
---
&gt;Killing a legendary before anyone else can get a hit in isn‚Äôt griefing
---
Still a dick move. I get it if it‚Äôs done unintentionally, but if someone‚Äôs walking around with a lever action or some other one shot gun in UF and camping spawn areas, they‚Äôre an asshole
---
Problem is half the time lobbies won‚Äôt come down to fight her then. I‚Äôve had this happen to me 3 times. One time I launched the nuke myself and only 3 ppl showed up being they had to be in the zone
---
Well.  That puts a different look on something I did recently.
---
I just started playing again and someone took my workshop.  I went there and obliterated him, took it back.  Maybe he didn't know.
---
1.  Is that you Curtis?
---
2. They‚Äôre a horribly mismanaged server that treats half their members like crap. They demote people for being ‚Äúdisrespectful‚Äù to them (disagreeing with them whatsoever), and a few other reasons. I just left, I wasn‚Äôt admiring these things to myself until now, but they‚Äôre all true.
---
Why not use a less powerful weapon? I use a western revolver for events with people just to tag...
---
He. I can relate to that XD
---
Who‚Äôre you?
---
Not exactly intuitive but the picture up there rarely ever has anything to do with the free item they tell you about.  Occasionally it does, but not very often.
---
If you post a complaint about an event that hasn't even started yet on this sub, you get 250 SCORE.
---
My fav is the crying kid in the background with parent telling them to be quiet cuz it's the SQB fight. lol
---
I really hope we can actually ‚Äòpick sides‚Äô in 76 eventually. The Raider V Settlers thing was cool and all but there wasn‚Äôt any REAL consequences to choosing one over the other. But if they reinsert the Enclave in Appalachia there will be two sworn enemies occupying the state, and it‚Äôs guaranteed we‚Äôll have to choose a side.
---
That's obviously Plan A, but we all make mistakes.  Plus, not everybody cares, so why give them the chance to screw everyone else over?
---
Most likely just being wierd.   As I have not heard of an inventory stealing glitch since winter.  That is not to say that the person was not trying, but as long as nothing is missing it's just wierd.
---
No one is one shotting anything. Their weapon does so much damage and usually swings or fires really fast. So the enemy dies in like half a second. It will mutate after the first shot, just happens extremely quickly. Not much can be done about this.
---
True first kill never counts.
---
Really? I have never seen one for sale. Gonna have to keep my eyes open for that.
---
To avoid vendors, you can buy items off of a friend at a cap a piece, I do this with my friend all the time. If she isn't on, I just buy one round of ammo I need at a time and then the rest of their stack. Bethesda sure does love this daily challenge
---
The community is good but the game has gone off to a  dead end. Its a shame that they dont understand what the players need
---
I've tried so hard to stand under that when it drops and it just pushes me off to the side.
---
Its just because they can and wanted to. There is no issue or secret behind it. No different than if your at a store and someone looks at you. Its just because they can. Personally, I'd highly recommend it not bothering you or ignoring it. Shop and then gtfo so you don't notice em
---
It's all about shooting her tbh. There are quite a few perks wich are widely used that cause staggers and the SBQ resets her attack pattern when staggered while landing.
---
You can literally see this when she starts doing the animation, then jerks to a side aka gets staggered and then resumes doing fly-bys.
---
I don‚Äôt know how to break this to you...
---
I feel attacked
---
"Their weapon does so much damage and usually swings or fires really fast. So the enemy dies in like half a second."  
---
How is that different from one-shotting?
---
No, but I fast traveled away and back to my CAMP and she's back to normal
---
Actually dont. Just clear out the monsters so that they wave event never comes.
---
That's good, but still weird it happened in the first place
---
I agree, it can be frustrating, if anything, buff enemies
---
Grahm has scared the SHIT out of my on multiple occasions.
---
Been playing since release aside from a 10 month gap after I quit cuz of a Camp glitch which wiped 2 days if building. I dont think I ran into him the first time until about a month ago. My camp is behind the vendor in flatwoods on the river. So I can see the agricultural center between the trees. One night I hear shooting coming from there and think a low level needs help. I scope from my roof and see a super mutant fighting the robots and think thats odd. I run down and its grahm. So I help clear the bits and shop from him.
---
2nd time I'm also in flatwoods at the diner collecting scrap and hear a very loud voice growling/mumbling near me. I checked the map and there were no players and then I hear it again and I'm just like WTF IS THAT. I carefully look out and then hear the voice, clearly this time, talking about meat over the hills. I quietly change into a fresh pair of  underarmor and go buy from him again.
---
I never new my camp was so close to his path all this time. I've run into him at least 4 times in flatwoods and once near the freakshow.
---
I am seeing pretty much the same thing. I am pretty new to the game and only recently getting into the practice of dailies so I thought this was how they worked. Heh heh
---
They used to send squads to the Responders trying to collect ammo and other supplies. Maybe they'll have random BoS guys show up at player camps demanding free stuff, or else. It would be both accurate and entertaining.
---
Ghost of Tsushima is pretty great.
---
That's due to be fixed on Tuesday. They're redesigning the converter interface and it's due to be released in patch 21 which comes out in a few days. I don't mind the interface as is now that I did most of the tedious work already because I mostly just use it to grind up missiles when I get a few and that's rarely more than two to three cycles, but I stopped using it for low level ammo until the patch because 10mm piles up fast and scraps too slowly.
---
I always check every major update because that one time it performed flawlessly and three 3*** super mutants showed up. 
---
But every time is just a kick start into a ditch.
---
Yeah or look for modders with high karma.  Keep in mind this was a while back but I bought a fully modded X01 for like....6k? I just gave it away cause I don't use PA anymore. But I'm sure ther a still plenty of folks out there that can add the mods.
---
Why join something you know will eventually lose?
---
Each pack gives xp. Spam them all and you'll get loads of nw rewards
---
Shotguns in fallout shoot multiple smaller damaging shots in a spread, with a higher vats chance it makes them all hit 
---
Sum magik
---
I think they are trying to say that it's not a one shot it just appears to be one shot due to let's say 5 bullets hitting fast. 
---
However this also would be the problem with your solution. Automatic weapons that kill fast would also kill them even if they mutated 10 times. Unless your looking at the enemy quick kills will always happen.
---
Source or calling it bs. Never seen anything like this mentioned in datamining discord.
---
Those were unlocks that were obtainable during the Halloween and Christmas events. They are currently glitched, and can be unlocked now. The xp you are getting from opening packs with duplicate cards is applied to those. They are supposed to be fixed in the next patch.
---
As far as the lots of packs, I had that happen too. Apparently it happened to a lot of people when Wastelanders dropped, or maybe before that...I honestly don't remember.
---
Essentially, you're getting some cool skins and stuff for free so shhhhh.
---
Edit. Bethesda already knows about it and no one seems to be getting in trouble for it. The shhhhh part was just a joke.
---
I believe is a server issue, because earlier she took forever to appear in my CAMP, even when her console was there
---
When it comes to armor, SS is basically more worth it for the jetpack than anything else. While we *are* getting more bosses such as Earle Williams, you really don't need a full SS set with perfect rolls for any content. Same goes for damage and most other things.
---
Eh, you know.  Another Bethesda special.  I never do those dailies anyway.
---
Do you realize that is one of the locations where the Surface To Air Event occurs? 
---
Repairing the battery is part of the event.
---
Wrong. I've one shot lots of legendaries. It's pretty easy to tell the difference if you use non-automatic weapons.
---
I understand where your coming from, but then if we can't 1 shot things then whats the purpose of these builds? I am behind your frustration of weak legendary enemies getting 1 banged and us unable to get any reward from them. I would suggest either we remove the idea of having to have "builds" OR make it so every one at events gets to loot things. I know people will complain if everyone gets loot because then "sometimes" a few ppl might just sit at events and do nothing. But I'd rather have that, than have the 1 guy kill everything, and I also put in work but miss out on the few legendarys that he kills
---
Eh, I'm a bit squishy with shop/craft/carry perks equipped so when someone crouches up on me with a shotgun every time I turn my back I get nervous anyway. But if I'm buying their stuff, being creepy to your customers is just weird.
---
üñï there ya go. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I‚Äôm not sure about that last part, I have a female character and my gamertag makes it even more clear I‚Äôm a girl, but at least so far I haven‚Äôt had any negative or unwanted encounters because of it. It‚Äôs pretty refreshing compared to other multiplayer games I‚Äôve played. I don‚Äôt use a mic though so maybe that makes my experience different.
---
What I have had are people coming up to me and gifting me stuff, leaving stuff for me at my CAMP, and I‚Äôve gotten a few messages asking me if I need anything, but that‚Äôs probably just more the community in general being helpful than anything else. And I‚Äôve only run into a griefer once when I first started playing, nothing since then
---
Lol as am I, I have too many "food build" perks. But pop in this game doesn't let them sneak up and F ya from behind. You'll be safe no matter how many ppl file up behind you ominously
---
I have 14 level difference with my brother, the only difference is the amount of INT, we tag all what we kill together and have same exp boosts.
---
So it would be Intelligence, or he's playing while you're not around.
---
Oh, also, I've watched legendaries die while I was switching weapons, which is the worst.
---
Forget them both. Join the Brotherhood of Spirits! Brewmaster Biv doesn't want your loyalty OR your resources. He asks only for your sobriety. (And liver, but who needs that?)
---
Yeah I was aware that is how some people are tackling it. I'm way ahead of schedule in terms of SCORE so I don't mind not getting the points. I just want to get to lvl 100 eventually.
---
With how they seem to be involved in the next seasons I can only see them being added as a new ally we have to get rep with so I imagine there might be a series of quests beforehand which leads up to use being recruited into the Brotherhood.
---
Also wonder what there gunna do with all that technical data.
---
hell yes!!!!
---
I've done that too. Sometimes I need the ammo and have to shop outside my team.
---
The reason why it does a lot of damage is because of the amount of pellets it fires, each one will deal the amount of damage your gun does.
---
I messaged you the list, sorry i got caught up my sister snd her boyfriend came by for dinner.
---
No they just drag shit out by making grinding take hours or require 10,000 kills of a mob to get the item you want. Doing the exact same thing just a different way by making you work harder to achieve the same thing that you do in 76.  In fact 76's system is better because it doesn't mandate you play for 8 hours straight to achieve the same thing. You can get on and depending on how focused you want to be grind out your dailies and then get off and play another game. 
---
I spent about 2 hours on 76 doing my dailies then spent the rest of my day playing other games. Actually makes 76 more enjoyable because there is no burn out.
---
I had a guy following me around contesting my workbenches because I accidentally one hit a 3 star. After about 15 min of back and forth revenge tactics, I put a marker near his camp, blocked for session, went to silo b, and well...after I blew up his camp, he left. That's my new favorite thing to do. Not one hit legendaries. Troll the trolls with a nuke.
---
Edit: I normally help low lvl players get items and lvl up, part of a group that spends a lot of time doing it, which is why I wanted to specify *accidentally* one shot the 3*
---
It takes more than one shotüòâ
---
"file up behind you ominously" lol sounds like the walking dead, DMV version.
---
I'm trying to go for rare outfits in regions. Blows that they don't trigger.
---
You want to talk "accurate" and yet you claim *everyone in Appalachia* has access to nuclear silos, and that the BoS won't happily sell out their ~~morals~~ equipment for material gain? üòÇ
---
That really sucks. I honestly wonder what their process is on selecting who gets permabanned and who not. Consider yourself a Martyr lol
---
So... How did I get the packs? Was it all from my couple hundred hours in adventure mode?
---
DEMOCRACY IS NON NEGOTIABLE
---
Yes I am a sheep because I enjoy a game.
---
*Just Gamer Logic*
---
The Brotherhood was pretty much a dick squad in 1 and 2. They grudgingly gave you some equipment, but no real support beyond that. To be fair, though, the Enclave were pretty thoroughly evil in FO2.
---
The Brotherhood got a little more helpful in FO: Tactics, where they actually gave a damn about saving civilians. Then they did a big nice guy/asshole flip flop between FO3 and 4. 
---
I can't really get enthusiastic about joining them, because they just can't seem to stay good for long. They always go back to their fascist roots.
---
Bahahahah
---
I had a really rare AAE25 GP as well, fucking cunts.
---
Yeah, I wasn't sure if that still was a thing or not. I also have people just follow me around and shoot me sometimes.  Low level baiting with high level team mates I'm sure, and a hop and block fixes it. But annoying when I'm squishy.
---
So, I‚Äôll shoot it twice. Easy easy.

If they were going to make them accurate, they'd have us turning our energy weapons in to the BOS, and have the BOS finding all of us 76'ers being mutated as problematic.
---
I sort of feel like this game kind of happens in it's own bubble in regards to pre-existing lore and concepts from the other games. 
---
Bethesda: Here's what you're all been waiting for! BOS and Enclave Plushies!!
---
I guess I‚Äôm in the minority when I say I play because I find enjoyment roaming West Virginia, capping workshops, helping lowbies do events, crafting, and fine tuning my C.A.M.P.
---
1950's America is fun
---
I Personally make a fortune from my player vendors.
---
I guess you don't understand what would happen..
---
 If people could make their own legendary weapons with legendary modules there would be absolutely no purpose of player vendors.  Whether they are overpriced or not you wouldn't need them because you could craft your own.
---
 As it stands right now all crafted legendaries are non tradable which means you can't barter, you can't sell, you cant do anything other than use them yourself.
---
 If people are able to make their own legendaries of what they wanted there would be absolutely no use for player vendors because you can't trade those particular weapons.
---
This! üëç
---
Seriously gaming subs are the worst.
---
Also God yes please plug me into the Matrix, can't be worst than what's going on in reality...can it?

It is the build order. You have to remove other wall/floors until you can remove that one.
---
Such as?
---
oh thats good to know! thanks!
---
I also have an Instigating explosive railway but never really use it. You like it?
---
A  secret it is then lol. I'm not complaining since during the Halloween and Winter events I took a break so I missed everything during those times. Maybe this was a thing to get people to try NW. Side note, only did the "survive x minutes" score challenges. Nothing else.
---
It actually doesn't work sadly
---
lmfao
---
The game literally being boring after an hour of tasks is what burns out and the fact you quit for other stuff immediately after is proof of it not incentivizing enjoyment
---
Imagine lamenting MMOs that have a drag grind then saying that a drag grind that also makes you literally spend a day to progress is a good thing
---
There is no way Bethesda is getting rid of the limit. You obviously knew about the limit and crafted a shit ton anyway. Now you are crying about it on Reddit. Pretty sad.
---
I did not. Someone already pm'd me to tell me that however so now I do. And I've moved my camp now but I appreciate the comment.
---
Never tried the instigating one but the furious once you learn automatic pistons is amazing. Almost every shot is a critical. I never used my railways before like I said. But did with this and used every spike I had because of it. Learn automatic and give it a go man. It‚Äôs amazing
---
I can 100% agree to this.
---
I would personally prefer to be able to have longer game sessions where I build up the notes and then turn most of them in at once, instead of being forced to log in every day of the week to turn them in after playing on a sunday.
---
What I would suggest is having the daily turn in cap changed to a weekly one and increasing it a bit. That seems way more sensible to me and would probably help with build-up as long as you don't have long daily sessions.
---
/r/apexlegends is the same except it has fan art and clips. Most of the bitching is in the daily threads. Same stuff you'd read here. Terrible devs, don't know how to run a game, can't fix bugs, not enough content, it's a cash grab, dead in a year (written a year ago).
---
If you really dont want combat with pvp, just turn on pacifist mode.  Its basically prohibits pvp (barring any glitches I might be unaware of) except in the case of workshops.
---
As far as I am aware, pacifist also removes the tap damage that other players do to you before pvp is initiated, so no squishy problems.
---
This thwarts the bullet catchers as hitting them will not trigger pvp.  There have been glitches in the past where pacifist could be circumvented by exploiting the counter damage from some mutations, but I believe this has been addressed.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong on anything.
---
Holy shit you are one lucky sob. All I get is one star nocturnal junk. Buy a lottery ticket....
---
I would love to have the middle finger salute as an emote.
---
It was a bug where adventure mode was awarding NW perks. It‚Äôs since been patched
---
Someday I hope to come across your camp and find this pie!
---
Heck yeah I‚Äôm fairly new as well.. lvl 30ish. I don‚Äôt have a mic (yet) but down to wander &amp; do some team stuff‚Äî
---
GT Sabotage Mahal
---
I thought you were gonna mention the option to turn events heroic...
---
I feel you. And fuck everybody telling you off for duping. You were doing the community a service üëç
---
One Appalachia will likely fix this
---
I've got about 120 hours in and I've completed all the quests, visited and looted probably 90% of all the locations. It would have probably taken a lot less time, but I was playing with a friend, so avoided doing quests while he wasn't on so that we could do them together. At this point in Fallout 3/4/NV I'd call the game complete and move on as there isn't anything else left to do. This game feels the same way, so I'll probably only play when my friend wants to or when they add new content.
---
A female friend has had some annoyances, but I'm pretty sure she was using a mic. I don't think it was anything egregious though.
---
Most players are really nice, and many of us are just waiting to see a low level player to shower with extra plans and stuff that are filling up the stash.
---
I like to drop gifts at noob camps, or leave them in the overseer caches in Flatwoods or the overseer's camp.
---
Everyone, this is what happens, and it broke with one of the last 2 updates.  When first joining a server after loading the game from the dashboard/whatever, the map markers on workshops show like they used to.  The collections tab, however, lists all zeros, and has 'perk coins' on there even, as well as some quest markers won't show on the map and other problems.  You have to exit the server and join another one to correct this, but that will then cause the workshop markers to change to regular map markers.  Every time you first load the game or have to fully reload it after it crashes to dashboard or something, it causes the above to happen.  Good job, bugthesda.
---
I take it off to craft or sleep sometimes...
---
Unyielding and int differences would be my guess, maybe some cranberry foods or brain fungus soup also.
---
Maybe I've been away from mmos for too long, but I remember weekly raid progression lockouts and other major progression limits like that. Imagine if you could only launch each silo once per week and if you were in a group with someone when they launched it, that counted as your launch. Once you loot the queen, she doesn't have special drops (legendaries, plans, etc) until the server resets. Instead of bullion and modules, she drops SS gear, but it's random and bound to whomever claims it. How much worse would the grind be if every queen fight was a GROUP roll on the purveyors 3* list? I'm not saying that the current system is the best. I think that all the gate limits should be higher, but I remember spending literal months grinding for sets of random drops in mmos with level caps instead of currency caps so grinding meant just for drops, because it didn't matter how much you killed if they didn't drop something useful.
---
That's my guess too. I played NW once with my main when it first came out. Not my thing, so I stopped. Played Adventure a lot and gained a couple hundred levels. When the SCORE challenges came out I jumped back into NW and had that happen too. I didn't check the math, but it seemed like I procured the same number of packs in NW as I gained in Adventure.
---
Someone noticed it when. It first happened and posted about it here a while ago. I think it was about when Wastelanders dropped, but I am not sure.
---
Same with the level up challenge, when I get close to lvling up I log off because I might not want to do 1.5 lvls the next day.
---
It‚Äôs a good thing I kept some armor and legacies with friends, so I can replace my Commando PvP character‚Äôs gear but I can‚Äôt replace my melee character‚Äôs Unyielding AP BoS set or his BSSS Super Sledge. Or the literal thousand hours I put into building those character‚Äôs builds and gear sets.
---
Welcome!
---
Depends on the gun.  My bloodied explosive hunting rifle can one-shot most legendaries.
---
Maybe im crazy but legendary enemies should be hard to kill lol
---
I hated the sights on the gatling gun, works fine without that sight
---
ü§£
---
I straight up saw someone get their ass kicked in uranium fever for constantly hogging the legendaries. I was laughing
---
This thread has been very helpful bless you all
---
It does not. One shot to the head of a 3 Star Level 64 Ghoul with my very slow Dragon will kill it dead...no mutating, just dead.
---
If I were you, I'd go with the handmade, simply because of the recoil on the fixer. Fixer might be better, but it has terrible recoil ^^'
---
Please explain. You have gained my interest
---
???
---
Sure why not lol
---
What weapons? I have had very few melee weapons that were only dropping limb damage.
---
The brotherhood will take the super mutants under their wing and create a unified Appalachia once and for all.  Together they will build housing for the Scorched!!
---
I did that one time and busted out the mic because I really didn't mean to do it
---
I have been playing with passive mode on for some time, I can confirm that it works without issues. (Or at least I have not encountered any in \~a hundred hours on PC)
---
I would love if they made a casino
---
That's hilarious. Did you get video? Please say yes.
---
Basically there is only one location in the game to get a clean globe,it‚Äôs in one of the ‚Äòinaccessible‚Äô tnt dome closest to the main building
---
Well everyone from Vault 76 does. Paige even mentioned  how he was aware of the vault residents having access to it. Really there‚Äôs absolutely nothing stopping the raiders and settlers from doing the same. And this faction of the brotherhood? No i couldn‚Äôt see it tbh. This is OG brotherhood. The first Maxson. The creators of protecting mankind from technology. I couldn‚Äôt see them selling out. Me if you were talking about Elder Lyons.. yeah i‚Äôd see that
---
Deep pocketed cargo shorts. The pockets go all the way down to your ankles.
---
Only one location for it it and that is in one of the ‚Äòinaccessible‚Äô tnt domes you can power armour glitch in btw
---
Why not do the leader of the pack event? Often up, 3 guaranteed lvl 10 wolf legendaries. One of the easiest dailies because of this.
---
I'm of the opinion you should not be able to put a tent up
---
I would try a different ally for a bit.
---
That would be pretty fun, just like new Vegas.
---
Yeah tbh this is also what got me to stop playing.
---
Yo thanks if you haven't of posted this I would of being nuked within an inch of my life
---
Or when someone starts the Radiation Rumble event with two people.
---
I wish the next fallout would go back to new Vegas and the west
---
Oooog, I get it, they make a giant wine bottle, drink it all and while it's all drunk and hazy they put the cork over the fissure site, once and for all!
---
I messaged you the list via chat. I can hop on my computer and direct message it if needed.
---
What output? You only show the pip boy, that number's just the base not the output .)
---
Why 11%? By accident?
---
Because the gain below 19.9% is so minuscule.
---
Also please don't come to the SBQ fest with your tank killer equipped.
---
I get what you mean. While it usually doesn't affect me too badly, it can get pretty unpleasant sometimes. One little tip to (maybe/hopefully) make it a little easier - by holding down the 'place' button instead of clicking it (it's X on PS4, don't know the Xbox controls) you can then use the left stick to push it farther away or side to side so it doesn't have to be all up in your business. Also works well if you have to place a light or something really high up.
---
Events are random who knows if it'll be up. but that's a good idea. I usually shoot for uranium fever these days
---
How?? I have full unyielding and can carry 430 without buffs
---
There is no fate but what we make for ourselves....Kyle Reese
---
Where do I sign the petition?
---
I don‚Äôt think the mutations would be problematic for them. It isn‚Äôt really abuse of technology. And the brotherhood didn‚Äôt take huge steps against irradiated creatures till Roger Maxsons grandson (Elder in fallout 4) took the lead. Their main purpose was originally just technology. Not really getting involved in the problems of everyone else. 
---
Now if it were like the cybernetic mods in Fallout New Vegas.. Yeah i could definitely see them having a problem with that.
---
I believe so
---
I saw man, I'll check what I got tommorow, its 12 where i am so I'm gonna go to bed.Ill message you what I've got tommorow and well see if we can make a deal.i think I have some of the items and some I think I will be able to get quite quickly
---
Gatling gun will trigger it with around 100% chance after you fast travel =\
---
So I wear regular gear and get in power armour and the effects are lost. If I get in power armour they should stack. I am wearing double armour after all.
---
If no one donated the BOS would just steal it from us like the raiders in shining armor they really are.
---
I'm level 565 and don't have a need for it?
---
SBQ? She's always been fought outside the rad zone.
---
Personally, I set my tent down so players have the ability to access their stash box to either get more ammo or weapons, and so they can put the legendaries they get from the event up. But now that I know that it f**** everything up, I‚Äôll stay on the ground and do it from there.
---
Break the TOS and then report it to the company? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That 11% is just what it is right now. I try to stay just below 20%
---
It might be other walls or stairs or whatever that area attached, or if there's nothing like that attached it's probably other foundation pieces are attached that wouldn't be placeable without the piece you're trying to remove. Not really sure how to explain that, I hope it make sense.
---
Exactly. This is what I want. Don‚Äôt just have them selling to anyone. Make us join ranks first, like we‚Äôve had to do in previous fallout games
---
It's that attitude which leads you to lose to "The Chosen One" and "The Lone Wanderer". Admirable but futile in the end.
---
Alright now Elder Lyons üòÇüòÇ
---
And if you throw enough wine cork bungs into fissure site, maybe the problem will go away
---
This is exactly the issue I've been having.  I really hate all the caps.  I hope they see our feedback on it and maybe down the line increase or lift the caps a bit.
---
I'm really hoping for like, a battle over Appalachia event.
---
The same thing happens to me regularly. There are some that it lets me do 2 or 3 times a week, and there‚Äôs actually one it‚Äôs never let me do since the very first time I completed it. To me they‚Äôre still worth doing for the easy XP, so it‚Äôs slightly annoying
---
Doesn't make it right, but when we're poor on developers bugfixes, beggars not choosers.
---
Maybe Todd shouldn't make the SBs for the event spawn and stay on the other side of the building? And no, they rarely come over to the event side
---
The way I see it, these are the reasons he might be ahead of you. 
---
His character‚Äôs intelligence might be a little higher than your character. More intelligence means more experience points. 
---
He might have a card under charisma called ‚Äúinspirational ‚Äú which depending on the level of the card, it increases the experience you gain while you‚Äôre on a team. 
---
Even if you both shoot/attack the same enemy. The person that actually kills the enemy gets more experience than the person that just damages the enemy. 
---
He might have done more quests, events, challenges while you were doing your own thing. 
---
OR THE WORST POSSIBLE REASON OF ALL
---
He plays without you behind your back. You should flick him on the nose.
---
Bloodied, 25% faster fire rate, 25% less VATS cost
---
So standing in place doing the same 5 actions for 6 hours to get 25% of the way to 95 attack skill from 94 is better?
---
I actually would love to read game memory to catalog my stash/inventory on all characters, but oh look, ToS prohibits this, like that ever stopped actual cheaters.
---
It'd be cool if they took us to new Vegas in the expeditions, although that is across the country. But hey you never know, the brotherhood could have their vertiberts.
---
Truly Bullet sponges.
---
And Gatling gun, and Flamethrower (I am not even low health or junkie)
---
I completely agree. I don‚Äôt get the passion for PvP in this game when so many games do it better. When so many have to crutch on a Tesla pointed at the ground or some other radiant effect, you know the gunplay is weak sauce.
---
I'm only in my PA for the Queen and nuke zones on my heavy gunner. When I played a commando (and when I make a new one) I'm never in it.
---
The power core drain from sprinting and VATS usage really kills my desire to stay in it for long periods of time. 
---
I wish they would either remove that drain from cores entirely, or make it infinite sprint/VATS as long as you have charge left.
---
I'd gift you some stuff but I'm on pc unfortunately. As much as it sucks, look on the bright side, at least you have some back up gear
---
‚ÄúGet up and dance!‚Äù is in the same series as the 
---
Omerta‚Äôs creating murder porn btw.
---
My sniper/commando has a dusty old suit of X01  in the stash that he hasn‚Äôt worn since V94 shut down.
---
My heavy gunner lives in a Strangler Heart suit.
---
It depends on the build and what factors are involved in the task.
---
First do the quests for both sides. Remember to get the stealth suit plans from the settler quest and the special power armor paint from the raider quest (to get it you need to loot the power armor). After finishing the preparation quests for both sides, you can decide how to proceed. Going in with the raiders gives a legendary plasma rifle ... there are no special rewards for the settlers. On what to do with the gold, depends on what you want to achieve. If you want to buy plans early give the gold to a faction for a reputation boost. If you plan to get everything, then just keep all the gold for yourself. You will max out the reputation for both factions by doing the daily quests long before you get enough gold to buy all plans, so long term its best to get the gold.
---
?
---
Red Dead Online has a middle finger emote? So does GTA Online if I recall.
---
Fair enough :)
---
So what is your output?
---
"It makes sense". First time with Bethesda, mate?
---
If this is laptop then you can't force the game to run on the 1070. There's a new windows update though that allows you to choose what gpu you want to use or prioritize over the other. Did you also try to right click an go into the Nvidia control panel and choose the 1070 as the main gpu to run programs?
---
I only do when she's not on, otherwise I just go to a random camp
---
I knew from the title it was going to be Ward.  Dude must have been born into Crique de Soleil.
---
It happened way before Wastelanders.  There's bugger all you can do about except not dying or quickly fast travelling out of the nuke zone.
---
No problem, I will.... After I get that collectron
---
It‚Äôs due to a targeting issue which came up in a patch months ago....you‚Äôll notice your left arm will take a significant hit.
---
Free drugs AND cookies?  The Enclave has a good hearts and minds strategy.
---
It's kinda sad that it is "socially acceptable" to hide and afk in nuclear winter. Especially since PvP is seen as a big no no in survival
---
Idk I use those armor repair perks and I never have to repair anything
---
Do you have the prime receiver for the Gauss rifle?
---
Graham is the strongest and most OG npc in Appalachia and sole purpose to help players get hard to find items through the exchange of caps
---
Because you totally cant sell ammo, chems, junk, maps, pvp supplies, collectables, script, or outfits. I'll reiterate, the items people would be trying to make arent the kinds of items you sell. If they are, I'll eat my words. Then I'll buy everything you have and flip it for a much higher profit.  It will also take a very long time to actually make those god roled pieces. So people are still going to wander around and look to see if you maybe made the gun they wanted. Player vendors will only die if people dont adapt. Make a bunch of guns and try and sell them. Make your own god roles and join a trade group. The ability of me to make a decent item would not affect whether or not I purchased an item from someone else because they arent going to be selling the item I'm going to try and make.
---
Nope, I asked my friend for it and the bastard traded it away. So I have no backup gear at all.
---
No, just the mini... your joking me. I have to also get a Gauss rifle prime also?
---
The game is actually so immersive that we‚Äôve all been doing cosplay in game without realising it...
---
Sorry, but yes.
---
I have basically just been logging in for 2 minutes to get that foundation rep achievement (since its my last one in the game) and logging off lol
---
Cork is an amazing insulator. I don't know why it's unrealistic a building would need insulation, it's also a good conductor apparently.
---
.....well damn.
---
That helps a bit. Thanks!
---
Phase 1: Get the saps from 76 to mine ALL the cork.
---
Phase 2: Ensure no more can be found(golf ball genocide).
---
Phase 3: Rahmani's BOS vendors sell Bulk Cork for 30k each.
---
Sounds legit
---
pretty decent damage for not being a heavy build
---
That could be it. And yeah, I‚Äôm level 48 currently and I still occasionally get people giving me stuff. I‚Äôve been playing on my private server more (so I can use workshops to farm XP without having to deal with PvP) but I still go on public servers occasionally, mostly to look at player vendors. I‚Äôm also trying to start paying it forward by gifting things to newbies, but the couple times I‚Äôve tried they end up running away from me, lol
---
Hmm plunger house sounds fun. I used to fill rooms in Morrowind with spoons until the game crashed, not sure why it amused me so much. Never tried to crash out Fallout in same manner.
---
Has everyone forgotten the 5% boost from berry mentats? Plus using the lunchboxes can get you up to +100% xp for 1 hour. (Though so far I‚Äôve found eating canned meat stew or any other food giving xp related buffs actually decreases the buff.)
---
Eh I dont even know how to tell if you‚Äôre downvoted lol.  Glad you enjoyed.
---
That‚Äôs not kid friendly, we can‚Äôt have that in the game while kids are getting murdered by horrid abomination of nature.
---
The whole new gold/treasury notes/new gear was a great addition to the game. When it first launched, the whole server showed up at events, and the game felt full of life and community.
---
Now, no one shows up at events unless there's a ton of mobs for xp, and sometimes not even then.
---
Why? Because we can only turn cash in for 200 gold a day, and there's a 5000 gold you can hold limit. I have over 400 notes from just playing the game the way I want, and I recently bought the secret service helmet just for a useless cosmetic because I bought everything else I want.
---
I bet this applies to many of us.
---
If they wanted us logging in every day, timegating only works if there's a reason to play and there's something to spend currency on.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you might need to craft the prime receiver, then 2mm ultracite ammo will unlock automatically (**need to double check this**)  
---
or you may just pressed Q (or whatever on consoles) to hide items, that you can't craft due to lack of resources
---
trust the process
---
I just got one as a reward yesterday, so no
---
That would be perfect when the Scorchbeast Queen starts flying in the air, while I was meleeing the fuck out of her with my Vamp's Deathclaw Gauntlet and had no Ranged Weapons.
---
You get the same 25% with tasty squirrel meat stew with the carnivore/stranger in numbers.
---
When a game becomes a chore I would rather stop
---
Same, it's around time when you finish the work day so there's not really a chance that you'll be in-game
---
I see, thank you. May I ask what quest it was?
---
How else are you going to plug the Fissure Prime?
---
I 100% agree but feel like we're striving for a perfect world here, if only bathesda would do this sort of thing I would finally be able to collect all the appearal, mags, bobbles and weapons I want
---
Came with patch 20
---
Why swap? You‚Äôre losing out on all around xp when you do. Every kill on building team is extra xp, and extra xp after the event. Event team is only event xp when the event is over. You don‚Äôt get a boost during the event itself.
---
well tell me this: someone gives you a calfskin wallet for your birthday, how do you react?
---
Is anything else in there? I was trying to photo mode glitch in earlier and couldn‚Äôt get it to work.
---
I finished the legendary run on the double XP weekend two weeks ago. Doing daily and weekly challenges still gives SCORE, but as I already reached rank 100 it is pointless. So basically you can just ignore the daily/weekly challenges after you finish the legendary run.
---
He's a communist.
---
So I have it unlocked and can mod it but it's not letting me make the ammo. I checked(even looked it up) and I have everything needed to make it.
---
Then that emote will also be bugged.
---
Not sure, to be honest.  I finished the wastelander questline, checked off some of those misc quests, and did a couple dailies.   I didn‚Äôt notice it in my inventory until I was about to log off.
---
Nope, since they are mods on the legs, thus they replace something else, Backpack slot is unique without equivalent on PA.
---
Only more rare junk nothing important though btw only ones filled with anything
---
She actually spoke less out and about. They definitely need to reduce the chatter regardless.
---
Now I feel like crap for talking shit about those paintings to the artist robobrain in far harbor
---
1-5 sure, 5-20, a lot but reasonable.  400 individual times can‚Äôt possible be something the designers imagined a player doing...
---
ring of fire except every time he says fire it gets faster by 10%
---
Ah, so better invest in that one armor perk I guess
---
Do you happen to know the number? I might try messing around again later. I don‚Äôt know how to do the PA thing but photomode usually works like at the doors in whitespring
---
Well no one laughed.
---
I added you
---
How do I enlist sir?
---
Don‚Äôt remember the number but it‚Äôs the one closest to the building
---
Wow ü§Ø Never heard that one before
---
Meh I'd just be happy if the reset everything at 12pm every day so I don't have to wonder.
---
I kept reading the later levels were more difficult, didn't know if that was true
---
I got a level 5 instigating western off leader of the pack. I can do up to 950 damage with critical shots. Maybe even more actually.
---
Thanks again. Seems the legacy is the lvl50 prototype. It was a static spawn (apparently) and was removed when wastelanders dropped. Aww, thought I had my second legacy there...
---
Add Ted Kaczynski as leader of Free States you cowards
---
The medic perk appears to work off damage. I've tried it with pistols and laser pistols and got very little result but a shotgun will fully heal.
---
I‚Äôd stick with the brotherhood till Arthur Maxon Exists
---
I would be happy with a blurred middle finger.
---
So much for that "friend". Don't wanna tell you what to do, but I'd honestly stop playing at this point, you're probably better off missing out on the grind anyway...
---
Boo hoo
---
You still get perk cards for the dailies in addition to SCORE.
---
Medic perk? You mean the team medic? Or are you talking the legendary effect?
---
&gt; THEN every single player in the workshop area is considered hostile towards each other and you‚Äôll have no choice but fight.
---
Wow that's fucked up
---
Lol what is he swinging? An ultra sledge?
---
Oooooofffff
---
With scrip I think they shouldn't put a daily limit on how much you can get but a limit on how much you can spend
---
love this. great idea
---
Which weapons? This feels like you are going through old posts from last year where a lot of melee weapons were bugged and only giving limb damage. That has long been patched.
---
I‚Äôm seriously considering quitting for good anyway. If I end up playing again despite all this bullshit...
---
I rarely use power armor mostly due to having &gt;10 fusion cores. When I do use it it‚Äôs either to help traverse the mountainous terrain of the Savage Divide, or to add extra survivability in The Mire or Cranberry Bog.
---
**Tracking Unknowns.**  
---
Starts from 'Investigate the area north of Valley Galleria'  
---
Finished it like half an hour ago on my alt.
---
No. It‚Äôs a quest reward for the free states.
---
Thank you, about to join
---
It‚Äôs also early days. The BoS from the other games is year and years later. It takes time for ideologies to solidify and dogma to form. 
---
Plus it could always be a specific faction or sect with a slightly different agenda.
---
I think there should be more NW emotes like need ammo or need nuke cards or have a brief case
---
I know bro you don't have to tell me n.n
---
Na brother of steel has far cooler armourü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I think that‚Äôs still a bug though. If it‚Äôs not fixed in Tuesday‚Äôs patch you should def submit a ticket.
---
This is what I do.  A 2300+ dmg gauss shotgun easily gets aggro even when she‚Äôs in the air.
---
It's a rare drop from events. I got mine as a reward for completing TeaTime. I don't think there are any world spawns or any other way to get one.
---
Just be happy they aren't asking for gunpowder or ammo
---
The one higher up are only a problem IF they get the SBQ aggro...
---
The secret to get her to land is only to shoot at her to get her attention and then only shoot her when she's landed.
---
Also, never ever come equipped with tank killer as staggering her will stop her landing. As for crippling, that doesn't work anymore.
---
The thing the devs don't understand is that is doesn't make you come back every day, it kills the fun in the days you actually feel like playing. Maybe some days i want to grind events for gold, maybe some days i want to grind caps and maybe, maybe some days i just want to explore and don't feel like i'm missing out because i'm not working toward the daily caps that just suck the fun out of the game. I get that they want players to play everyday so event will always be populated but make fun events, the current model just promote doing the shitty lvl1 event that you can complete without even paying attention just because you want the scripts/gold.
---

I have a better idea. Have an unlimited cash in for scrip. Limit the amount you‚Äôre able to spend in any one day, say 600. This allows for 6 bullion weapon rolls (compared to 1.5) a day, 12 bullion armor rolls (compared to 3 a day), and solves almost all our weight issues (minus junk which is solvable with Fallout 1st.)

If the Queen is targeting a player standing on a tent, she won‚Äôt land.  As soon as that player hops down, she lands.  Never fails.  Just get off the tents, fence, etc.
---
Yes, but that's Rockstar. They're known for pushing the limit. But, as I stated, even they limit things such as their profanity filter. So, my point still is correct in general. There will always be exceptions. But do you think Beth will be one?
---
Well for starters she can no longer be crippled. That was changed recently in a patch.
---
crystallized cryolater To freeze and enemy you need at least one magazine to slow the SBQ and I belive three to freeze.
---
Croc backpack plan in there too?
---
Wow if you use Destiny as example... destiny is pretty much the exact same game as it was at release. I recently bought the newest expansion which was an instant regret. I know Bethesda is one of the worst examples but Fallout 76 is still way above Destiny.
---
Although it sounds good but it would ruin the economy even more
---
How so
---
Yup. I text my friend and he came in and they went at it lol I was level 6 my husband too and our teammate claimed the workshop and domb jerk killed him and we just went to help defend against the scorched not the player lol..but he felt he needed to kill us and do it again
---
They do have awesome sound effect though
---
E is for Emerica.
---
How
---
Weightless armor more so, as they can be made to weigh 0!
---
Because that‚Äôs the only currency they deal in.
---
Just like Mama Murmrgh only deals in scrip.
---
That's called muling, it's been around for decades .)
---
Have a broke mans gold ü•á
---
They need to see this message. Every single point you mention is spot on. 
---
And when you list it like that it does not at all seem like a game you would wanna play. But it‚Äôs true.
---
(And tbh it would probably take less than a week for the devs, but idk)
---
I think some Woody Guthrie songs would fit to some themes of the game very nicely.
---
In addition can we get rid of the DJ, she talks too much.. gimme 3 Dog or no DJ at all.
---
Dude thank you. This literally fixed every bug that's been annoying me.
---
The scorched plague already does that
---
Just doing my part, citizen
---
I‚Äôd like to hear ‚ÄúIn The Air Tonight‚Äù. 
---
That slow build up. I can feel it coming in the air tonight. Oh lord. 
---
And then the *drums*.
---
I know that but can you sell things to them, i cant imagine why Bethesda would give them gold if you can't get it by any means...
---
It's stupid when you can fast travel to SBQ and arrive safely in front of the bunker and well outside the nuke zone...but if you die it spawns you Inside the Nuke Zone, sometimes a long way inside. 
---
I got caught in a loop where it respawned me repeatedly right next to the fissure in the max Rad zone - no amount of Rad+x/away could save me, and no time to scroll menus for my CSS - believe me I tried. 9 deaths before it spawned me close enough to the clear air. 
---
People have argued you should always wear HasMat/CSS/PA at SBQ. Rubbish. Most nuke are placed specifically to leave the bunker area clear to avoid such problems and even if you die you should be safe. At the very least the game should be offering alternative revival spots.
---
I hear you on the Dj i want some with style first it was travis than her give me someone with style
---
Someone in another post mentioned rather than having a scrip limit, it gives scrip notes similar to treasury notes and then you can convert the scrip notes into scrip at another time. 3* weapon would give 40 scrip notes for example. 
---
The scrip limit is getting a bit ridiculous especially with so many character locked weapons and armor now.
---
It's honestly not worth it. The story stuff can be cool but the grind is just a predatory and glorified slot machine designed to keep you coming back everyday for a small chance to get something good. I recently traded for a B2525 fixer and now I'm honestly at a loss justifying myself coming back everyday. Yeah I could get some better armor pieces but it won't make much of a difference. I mostly play this game because there is nothing better to do, but when you think about it, literally doing anything besides grinding in fo76 is a better time investment.

I left in the past two days. I guess that doesn‚Äôt narrow it down much, does it? I was a high ranking scribe... again, doesn‚Äôt narrow it down much more, does it? I wasnt a proctor.
---
I really hope that PA won't be a skin but unique PA if you get Enclave karma someday in the future.
---
Like a reward , pick BoS or Enclave. Can't get both
---
Best advice I have is to have rad shield or a hazmat suit on your favorite menu. It's saved me a few times.
---
I clawed a thousand hours out of a game I paid ¬£8 for. So it‚Äôs not like CoD, where I paid ¬£63.99 only to hate it because I refuse to pay to get a decent gun...
---
Everything but the mounted head plans, so I hear.
---
Thank you so much, very helpful!!! Awesome that you / the people you've worked with have made this possible, much respect and appreciation!
---
Think yourself lucky, I've been respawned inside the fissure before.
---
*Insert the do you know how little that narrows it down meme here*
---
Get on your microphone, select "area" and tell them all to craft Tesla's
---
I was hearing his song this land is your land and it does fit
---
Hust check the workshop desk. If it's owned it will show both as text and the antenna will be at the top
---
Anytime! :)
---
For the immersion. 
---
For future updates. 
---
There‚Äôs nothing (that I‚Äôm aware of) that you can sell to Regs, Samuel or Maximillian.  Maybe you can sell back a plan if you accidentally bought one in that session, but I‚Äôve never tested that.
---
He‚Äôs just mad that he can‚Äôt afford to pay $13 monthly or $60 a year. He‚Äôs mad that other people who‚Äôs money they are putting into towards the game is supporting Bethesda. Kinda backwards logic, because those people who pay for Fallout 1st are the best supporters of Fallout 76 because they are consistently supporting it monthly. 
---
I don‚Äôt get it. Private servers in literally almost every game is paid through monthly or yearly. 
---
The way I see it is, he wants the entire game to be completely free and private servers to be completely free as well. He thinks it‚Äôs unfair that he can‚Äôt afford $13 a month while others can. He thinks it‚Äôs unfair people can stack hoards of material in their stash, when the reality is those FO1st players grinded more than a regular player did because they play every day and have every right to defend themselves, cuz hello, they support the game by paying monthly. Those regular players are casual af people who play maybe twice or three times a week. 
---
They all complain about free items in the shop that isn‚Äôt what they want, so then they demand free shit or a x3 exp weekend for being screwed over cuz they didn‚Äôt get what they wanted. 
---
So point is : Fallout 1st players deserve to be praised because THEIR money helps support the game while regular casuals don‚Äôt buy shit.
---
Yeah. My left leg always seems to break first. This is across 3 characters.
---
It's probably their method of "siphoning out" the duped materials. After all, they went through inventories before unbanning all those dupers, so they know exactly how much cheated junk is out there. I'm sure it will work fine, just look at how well their efforts to siphon out the christmas gifts went! Oh wait...
---
Even a LOL emote would be great
---
Would explain why my character in PA goes ‚Äòargh!‚Äô when stepping on a punji board.
---
Oh mannn 4 waves of radscorpions attack during defense of mononga power plant.
---
Ahhhhhhh, I just let it fail and come back to retake by killing 4 scorpions that respawn and get sticked on the pylons instead.
---
Ok cool!
---
ok thanks, i was unsure if i was missing another way to get gold
---
For a community manager, lady devann doesn't really do a good job at managing the community. She should stand up for players and argue for them not against them. If she had any pull whatsoever, she would get the devs to do what we are asking of them. Or try to find the resource to do it.
---
Damm so quite bad odds of getting it then XD
---
if you can get to level 50 and complete everything in 3 days then you must be able to play 10hrs plus a day.  
---
Edit= Even then it would be miraculous
---
I personally love having to log in and out 20 times just to buy my vault steel. Actually, probably closer to 50 because it will keep putting me back in the same server and won't let me buy more. I swear, out of all the stupid mechanics in the game...
---
Exactly. My boy thinks the map extension should be level based, like how some of the events recommend levels. "In order too get to that area you need to be 100+ level, but you have a chance too earn way more valuable loot". Enemies that make the SBQ look like a plushie compared to them 
---
Honestly, the limits would be the most important option too work on right now. I don't see why it's taken them this long too set Cap, Scrip, and Gold limits the way they are now. How hard is it too set it too unlimited or hell at least set the Cap limit too over 100,000. 
---
Economy is broken already, how would it make a difference?
---
Yep consider the game finished lol
---
Not difficult, takes longer to level up, that;'s why save your atoms for the last levels. I am not really putting a lot of effort in other than doing my dailies, I am behind so we will see, not doing to badly, my 4 characters are all around level 58-59. Going to be interesting to see how far I get and how close to I get. My goal is 78.
---
You can get this weapon as a meet week reward. It is called ‚ÄúThe Tenderizer‚Äù.
---
Once I finished off wastelanders I cancelled my fallout 1st logged off and won‚Äôt play until more major content is released. Then I go and play other games and when the BOS content is released by desire to play is back again.
---
I made the mistake of waiting till I collected up 900 or so scrips and decided to cash them in all at once. so of course I got a bunch of garbage, the problem then because I could recycle them at the legendary machine for scrip, I had to keep the junk items in my stash until the scrip limit reset.
---
What if they made it like a race with a preset list of Legendary Run quests. Make some of them easy and repeatable with minimal pay out, i.e. buy from a player vendor, join a team, take photo in team, etc., make  harder set ones that reset after you finish once, i.e. complete 10 dailies, complete all enclave/raider/settler/brotherhood/first responders/free states events; make this a list, maybe make some new ones, then make some of them insanely hard but will pay off big and make those one shots, maybe take a photo with you and deathclaw/scorchbeast/colossus in background. 
---
This would allow people that don‚Äôt play often to stay in the running and not give up and/or not because they are already so far out of the running. 
---
I understand the point is they are trying to get their daily user numbers to go up for a variety of reasons but you got to keep it fun beyond just a grind. 
---
Heck you could even make it a race in the sense that the first 76 players to complete the board get a special golden prize and once they are all gone other players  can buy a non golden option. This way you still get that cash inflow.
