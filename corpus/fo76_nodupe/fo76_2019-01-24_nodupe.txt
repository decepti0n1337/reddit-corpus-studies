Standing at Whitespring Station, listening to the Classical Radio channel I love the sound of all the explosions and gun reports in the distance knowing that those are real people, it makes it all more real for me, more vibrant.

---
---
I'm not sure where that is I don't seem to have unlocked it on my map and can't find anything when I search for it. 
---
The difference being that most MMOs feature some sort of total respec mechanic.  Switching from a shotgun spec to a rifle spec, for onstance, would require over 10 levels of moving special points.
---
I always figured it was coming from Vault 76 and being ran by the robots.
---
They taste like chicken O.o
---
Seriously the worst feeling ever... I couldn't even tell you how many hours I spent server hopping, in hopes to find those shocks with absolutely no success. Then to basically win the damn lottery by winning them, only to have them scrapped. For what? 2-4 pieces of steel?... I can't imagine how many other people this has happened to, across all platforms.  Thankfully, another extremely nice &amp; extremely generous player PMd me on here &amp; hooked me up with another set of shocks. But, Bethesda DEVs really shit the bed on this one...
---

---
Tell you what, if by some miracle I come across another set, I'll hit you up &amp; pay it forward. 
---
It could still be that the Fusion Generators can recharge Fusin Cores over time though, or that power armor uses a lot more power than what they are used for powering (Which honestly couldn't be that unlikely, since a decontamination arch in this game uses almost half a generator. 
---
I'm betting if you shot at him, he'd still be aggro'd. So, yeah, life imitates art once again. 
---
Two spawn there. They’re underground and spaced out so it’s possible to miss one if you don’t walk the whole island. 
---
It's 2019. That's a thing now. 
---
I used to work at the resort! The game left out the part I worked in though - I suppose for historical accuracy. 
---
It’s big like getting ten levels to do that is going to take that long. 
---
If enemies are swarming you then you would use it it’s also super cool😎. You can’t be a cowboy without fanning the hammer
---
I have, I've done Belly of the beast and  I am become death, and killed the scorched Beast Queen, I've. Gotten almost every plan for my Camp, completely finished it's design, gotten basically the best armor and weapons in the game even though I more base it off what looks good and now there's nothing left to do, even warframe is less boring and empty than this game turned out to be.
---
It'd be cool if you could repair something you accidently tag to get rid of a wanted level
---
Meh fly into Pittsburg and rent a car, it would be a nice road trip
---
Found one yesterday. I think they're coming in a DLC but the helmets were accidentally unlocked early.
---
Where are the robots?
---
What else is there to do? The only thing I don't do I'd Pvp because I'm not a mindless child, if I want Pvp I can play something actually made with Pvp in mind on an engine with Pvp in mind. 
---
And the duped TSE weapons will remain the most OP weapons in the game.
---
Bethesda punished normal players who got a decent two shot or explosive drop but not TSE and dupers didn't get punished at all. The problem was the perks combined not individual. Epic incompetence on Bethesda..... they're practically saying if you cheat we will punish everyone who didn't cheat.
---
I personally think that there should be more NPCs, but not necessarily human ones. The idea that literally NO humans survived the scorched plague is a little ridiculous - no Free States or Vault Residents hiding in their bunkers?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But, non-human NPCs, like a talking dog or a 'deathclaw traveling merchant' (assuming we ever find a live one) would be a nice addition to the game. Or, maybe a reveal that some people did survive, and are hiding - like Abbie. There's no guarantee she's dead, as we never find her corpse (as far as I know.)  
---
I'm glad that they're going to fix this issue, but the damage has been done. As I've said on a separate comment, I can't imagine how many people this has happened to. Reimbursement &amp; compensation is definitely in order for shitting the bed so badly on this. 500 ATOMS just isn't going to cut it. 
---
And now imagine some of the guards being gamers that find themselves hanging around the Whitesprings golf club all night long, just to wake up and think to themselves, "WTF am I doing with my life?" :-p
---
This could be quite interesting even if Whitespring pretty muchgets pissed as soon as I shoot my TSE Gatling anyway. 
---
I thought I'd have time to jump on before work called, but as soon as I posted, I had to run. IGN name same as here. I'm usually on most days for the next 4 hours at this time. 
---
Noted.   I definitely should have been more cognitive, but this should have never been an issue to begin with. :/
---
Thank you! And may the Wise Mothman bless you with endless caps! 
---
Funny how the post apocalyptic version has MORE greenery. XD.  Excellent pics!
---
Hey they said explosive shotgun not a two shot explosive.... details lol
---
This is what they do. They tested out stuff for oblivion in morrowind, for Fallout 3 in Oblivion, For Skyrim in Fallout 3, and for Fallout 4 in Skyrim. Most of the time it graphical test like draw distance, micro and macro textures, weather effects ect. And sometimes it's gameplay enhancements like, adding sprinting, different level up systems, or different battle mechanics like duel wielding. Then they read internet threads to see what people liked ,didn't like, or if they want something different. 
---
This is why I love this game.  I grew up 30 minutes from the prison and did a couple law enforcement training seminars there,  it is actually in Moundsville WV,  been to Morgantown, Bekley, Charleston, driven up Dolly Sod, powhattan Point,  Harpers Ferry, and the Greenbriar.  Nothing is where it should be on the map but  fun none the less
---
Reason why the game excited me so much when announced.  
---
I’d imagine that all those chems you are using are speeding up your metabolic rate and you are requiring more calories to function 
---
Pipboy: chameleon edition
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
The cake is a lie :(
---
TBH I think that's their price point strategy even if it looks absurd to someone who is responsible with their money. You have 800 atoms from playing when a good skin launches, so the $10 worth of atoms doesn't look too bad. If it was just a flat $18 cause you have 0 atoms it's a harder sell.
---
And your proof of that is?
---
That was one thing i was excited for before launch, i questioned if we could tame animals like in fallout 4 with the beta wave emitter and after seeing the live action trailer with the friendly deathclaw at the camp i was sure it was possible, well maybe in the future
---
So...  HAD to see how far of a road trip this would be for me.  Its only 3 1/2 hours away...  This might be in my future.
---
Did you swing by Carnegie Hall in Lewisburg by any chance? I think it’s only like 10 minutes from The Greenbrier. Kind of a low key location in the game. I had no idea it was going to be there. 
---
Lol he better, I’m down to 60 atm
---
Msg me on Xbox. I'm collecting a set of wood armor. Need a left arm still. I use a stealth build so it ties in well with it. 
---
I may have been around for this so thank you for attempting vigilante justice lol. 
---
I was playing with some friends to complete my I am Become Death and while we were getting ready at one of the camps some guys showed up and just kept totally wrecking the camp and killing us all repeatedly. It was really annoying.
---
We switched servers and then after I set off the nuke- more jerks but just kept repeatedly killing me in the nuke zone to the point where I had to switch servers (even though I was trying to  farm my own nuke. ) 
---
Took my caps, all my nuke junk. Just really obnoxious. They definitely need an opt out for this. Or servers for pvp and non pvp. 
---
Melee, ranged or both, and thanks!
---
To confirm what is LVOV?
---
They should really go the prototype route. The deathclaws 200 years later were perfected by The Master, and slowly spread across America. We've never seen the prototype ones so it's not hard to imagine the 76 ones as being them, especially as they seem weaker and fairly rare.
---
It'd be easy to add an area where they were worked on. Maybe have a number of variations, from weak, malformed ones to some containing different creatures DNA, they could even reuse the gatorclaws. 
---
Thanks
---
Some good ideas here!
---
It’s my favorite fallout! 
---
I visited a couple of times when I was younger. My stepdad and his family were originally from there. 
---
This happened to me as well with a party of three.  I took out the one and turned around just in time to unexpectedly see the second, it excites me because I thought there may be a second spawn I didn’t know about but as you said it seems to be a party thing 
---
The desk would at least offer some semblance of protection if parts of the ceiling fell down. 
---
I think you're making my point for me. Some people think they are better informed than others despite having zero experience and just can't see how wrong they are
---
I wear full sentinel armor under my PA, when I take workshops I exit my PA to avoid being 1 shotted. 
---
I get your pain but I think what we all want is more engaging gameplay that makes the gear we get feel more like a reward for a quest well finished or a challenge achieved and Jess like a lottery or grab bag. 
---
I like the idea but god damn man I'd be so paranoid my shit's gettin' jacked all the time!
---
I don't carry any armor. I wear a BOS Officer suit under the Power Armor, but that's it. Anything armor I get, I sell to vendor or players. 
---
I've transitioned to only using PA for bosses and hordes, so I keep my regular armor on me at all times.
---
The advantages of legendary armor outweigh the pure tank qualities of power armor, for the most part.
---
If all your combat is done in PA; dump regular armor and even under armor since none of the stats or legendary effects take affect when wearing PA. Just wear an outfit if you don't wanna be naked outside your steel cocoon.
---
I visited a couple of times when I was younger. My stepdad and his family were originally from there.
---
No, I create my own stuff from my imagination and what I think looks nice, but seeing how other people do it helps you develop a feel for it. If you need to you could probably replicate how other people do it, after all I imagine that is why they make their guides.
---
Did you already launch the nuke?
---
A Perk card Loadout would be amazing. Ive gotten faster at equipping the perks I wish to use for a situation but, a loadout would be efficient. 
---
Does anyone else find it crazy that it’s lawmakers that got access to the bunker? Like a nuclear apocalypse just happened. How are lawmakers going to help after? Save the engineers! Doctors! Etc 
---
And what stuff points directly not indirectly to free to play?  If it was copies being removed from game shelves and not even from all stores and not even all copies that is not hard evidence.
---
My point is trying to jump with the outrage crowd whenever something is mentioned about 76 looks foolish especially when it was something that was debunked.
---
I prefer to let the workshop get taken back over by baddies.  Easier to kill a workshop with one round of spawned mobs compared to four waves.  You get the same rewards. 
---
Dear Sir or Madam,  
---
  
---
I'm not sure if you missed the point of the thread, but this is to help the community, and Bethesda, address our issues.  
---
No one claims the game is without flaws, but those of us who enjoy it would rather you take your trolling and clickbait somewhere else.  
---
Thank you in advance.   
---
P.S.  
---
You're full of it, tons of games have had similar threads with know issues and status reports, especially more complicated ones beyond the standard "Point and Shoot". 
---
Sentinel armor? What's that?
---
This is true, but at the same time they do need to work on the other things because let's face it when they finally fix the stability even they probably won't know for sure for at least a week or more and it will probably take the community even longer to realise because people will always be quick to point out when they get booted over the days they do not. So they need the other QoL/improvements to show progress in updating the game.
---
If I remember correctly, the Pulowski Preservation Shelters only existed because of all the paranoia around nuclear war. 
---
For example, if someone was on a street and they heard a loud noise, they may instantly assume it was nuclear war and hide in the shelter, give it its money, and then come out because nothing happened. 
---
Nice good to hear. Now let’s hope they fix it, because they’re still blaming Sony. At least when I talk to someone.  
---
Same, poorly defined and unhelpful error code here.
---
Not yet! Repairing the cores right now
---
Im sitting on 6 points now and I own almost every card. Its a dead end at that point. Im level 138 currently
---
YES PLEASE. this and inverted roof corners
---
If you can tame one, pics please and your new pet’s name! 💖 #petsoffallout 
---
Spoiler: It's pretty cool. 
---
I've never been to the real Green Bank, but there is absolutely no mistaking what you've found when you find it. 
---
Vault etc doesn't have a great track record. A lot of vaults ended badly because of the people inside. Some of the people leaving the vault were also born in the vault. So the vetting process wouldn't have been able to weed them out. 
---
I like PA because I use heavy guns often, have oodles of fusion cores, and it's fun being chonky. 
---
What kinds of legendaries are you using instead of PA out of curiosity?
---
Also I did a trade with a guy yesyetday for the Western outfit and chaps and he confirmed the only event he does is grafton day. Hope that helps
---
Please let me know if you get the trophy, I also got to level 100 on both of my characters with the Monster Mash event, so I would really like to know if it is possibly tied to that.
---
Thanks will add the info, if I can get past the character cap!  
---
BTW RE: workshop issue, do you use power armor? If so get the "Coiled" mod for the Torso, I've killed many a stuck mob with it allowing me to claim workshops.
---
With my melee build in PA I just got rid of all.other armour. Only had my space suit and beer hat on when not in PA. Everything else is a waste on weight.
---
Some LFC would be cooler because you would get something other then generic perk cards. Plus they could have fun with the artwork. Something fresh and new.
---
Launch in about 20 minutes
---
Nice :D
---
I mean, if you want you can continue to be obtuse and try to make your point that way, but you'd.. well, come across as obtuse. A couple - two or "a few" according to dictionaries. A few - contextual, but when talking about hours google tells me no more than 6 cause then we move on into "several" territory. So, yeah, either way it's contextual. Everybody knows the dude or dudette isnt talking about two hours, but rather an unspecified session of a few hours, which could be colloquially understood as anything up to 6. You deliberately chose to interpret him in the least favorable way to make an absurd argument. That makes you naturally obtuse or intellectually dishonest, there's no kinder way to put it.
---
And as for the spirit of the comment, well, the guy is trying to get a point across. That servers are shit and he's having major problems with them. This is not a fringe problem, it's *very* common. If it's on the end of every person having this problem, well, it's no longer a their end problem, it's a poorly optimised game problem that doesn't work well on a very large portion of the playerbase' systems. There's no excuse for this kind of poor performance, and trying to push responsibility onto the users for it is, well, a dick move.
---
But if you could do that you would short yourself on this game that is a part of the learning process. Notice how little hand holding there is in this game? If you could just swap all points what would you do with all that free time you missed out on? Take it from some one who has done everything this game has to offer, I'm thankful for that part of the game or I'd have nothing left to do after 400 hours.
---
That's a great combo, but I have a tin foil hat that might be even better. 😂
---
Actually I found some posts from people getting them a month ago, so no idea whats happening.
---
Do you leave you camp clear acrossed the map or do you keep pulling it with you?
---
Which bits of junk do you keep in your stash and which do you risk?
---
someone with a wanted lvl is near your camp, but you are almost at the end of this building.....what do you do?
---
the paranoia would add a fair amount of pressure....I love it.
---
Bethesda is far from the only game with a list of issues that need to be addresses, it is intact quite common.  
---
Constructive and helpful input is welcome,'but I think I can see where the downvotes are coming from.
---
That’s where my camp is currently! A great spot for sure...but mine doesn’t look as good as yours... it I do have lots of light up signs 
---
Running a single handed melee build with lots of perks for sprinting adding protection and speed. And perks to swing faster. Fun running from enemy to enemy and stun locking them with flurries of blows.  Now i got mistress of mystery full set so i been finding low levels to help.  
---
I'd like a pet brahmin that does nothing but walk behind me so people recognize me as a trader 
---
Yes! Other games have rewards to long difficult quest lines that are ONLY achievable by that quest line (cannot be traded or sold). This makes equipping it a badge of honor. People who see you with it know you put in the work and did something hard. 
---
Right now, if people see you with something rare, know you dupped it/bought it/got lucky.
---
&gt;I was under the impression that once an item is offered it is in the store for good. So the store is always growing in Stock
---
Blackbird paint, Hot Rod paint and PA station, to name a few things that weren't added afterwards.
---
I like that idea! Maybe the Enclave was using them to eradicate the Brotherhood? I know the Enclave is more about droppin bombs but they do have a pretty sweet genetics lab. 
---
Or Prime Receiver
---
Imagine trading those for an LFC that gives you a lvl. 3 lockpick or hack with one card. It would eliminate 3 points that could be used for other perks in that category. 
---
Fortnite, the sims, barbie games probably.

We are same same.

Also my family has a group FB chat to keep in contact (my parents call it "the blog" because they don't know what blog means) and the chat is title crazy dog people. Parents got three (siberian husky, shih tzu, chihuahua) and i have two (mongrel mutts). They are all so damn spoiled. Dogs are the best. i love dogs. 
---
seriously how does she take chems 
---
The real life graphics are so much better than the in game graphics

They were in fallout 4 just fine 😂

unless it's a random encounter spawned alone, then no

&gt; I am not sure if its account or Character based, but there is a “Seeded” Random Number Generator. Extensive testing has been done, from several hundred vendor interactions, several hundred treasure maps (same location) and a couple thousand legendary drops. I can't see any other explanation. 
---
That would explain why I never find any explosive weapons, let alone TSE.
---
I can understand why it might be considered an advantage to be able to see when the Scorchbeast spams it’s attack but I can also understand why Bethesda wouldn’t want to be liable when that screech finally triggers someone’s epilepsy and causes a seizure. That screech is HORRIBLE 
---
He was clearly exaggerating 
---
It’s that’s simple.
---
You’re trying to bring all this crap to cover up that fact.
---
But you spend your life the way you want. Or waste it. 
---
There was a special election planned for just before the bombs fell, if I remember the newspapers I read correctly.
---
Wait what does production sell? I didn't even know they had a vendor 
---
I still haven’t met him..
---
I really like her commentary, but sadly she only plays like what, two songs? They're not even real songs either, it's like elevator music. If she had a real radio station I'd listen to it. 
---
i run into silent invisible monsters about as often as i run into the mile long mongrels.
---
personally I'd rather see some kind of player driven town concept where we could make our towns more interactive for others 
---
like radio beacons that show our location on the map - a protectron we can quest to get that picks our crops repairs our buildings (only non destroyed) and collects water or junk while we are adventuring - maybe a few cosmetic pets like a mole rat farm basically things to make our camps look more like small scale settlements instead of square bunker forts 
---
False scarcity, pretty sneaky bethesda. I looooove being manipulated like that.
---
Only launch on her when the server has 6+ lvl 80+ on, if you vet mostly 40s and 50s you are not going to beat her 
---
yeah i know, but i’m not talking about the purpose of concept art. i know cause i am a concept artist for bliz and i work along side some of the greatest artists i know, including luke mancini. 
---
i understand the pip boy is fan art, not concept art, two totally different purposes. but in short i’m just saying i just love the guys pip boy. i shouldn’t compare art to art but i couldn’t help myself. 
---
You can tame animals its just pretty buggy and only works on specific encounters and specific creatures. They just hang out at camp. Ive had a deathclaw, mirelurk hunter and sloth
---
Lumping these together, Cheating/Hacking/Modding: Altering game play to give one player or players avatar advantages other players do not have access too through normal game play.
---
With that in mind. 
---
Mods that provide any unfair advantages would be just like the lock pic mod a lot of pc folk talk about on here... The one that shows you, The sweet spot.
---
Official statements:  "Fallout 76 does not support mods." 
---
That I cannot deny, it is indeed a terrible sound and I wouldn't blame anyone for using the mod (hell, I'd probably use it if I felt more comfortable with that stuff in an online game). I'd be less concerned with them seeing that specific mod as an advantage, and more concerned that they have a blanket policy on mods that alter these things. It would be very nice if we'd be able to get some more detailed confirmation on these things.
---
I can see them nuking the White Springs and farming into the early morning hours, getting dressed and heading to work at the Greenbrier and just wishing they could nuke it in real life.
---
What is his GT?
---
WoW has a [*plethora* of mods you can install and Curse has been a **huge** thing for years](https://wow.curseforge.com/addons) and a lot of similar UI editing to save time / macros for QoL apply here
---
I don't think thats clear. I've had several hour long sessions that has been nothing but one big performance issue. Given the state of this subreddit I'm fairly certain I'm not alone.
---
yes, i know. art is still art
---
A lot of people are upset because it's simply not what they expected (even though it's kinda exactly what was advertised)
---
Initiating launch! 25%
---
Will take a short break after 100%
---
That doesn’t sound fun to me but I am interested to see how the upcoming PVP servers will work. If we have to start fresh without dupes I would probably be inclined to play there instead of the current servers. 
---
I myself was a bit weary when I saw that mod posted, but its a gut feeling founded on absolutely nothing. 
---
Just had a look at the glowing plans comments on Nexus, didn't see the word banned in any of the pages and pages I went through. Would think if that one had gotten somebody in trouble they'd have mentioned it there. 
---
Each piece reduces damage taken when standing still by 15%. And reduces damage taken by 8% from players. Which means I get 115% damage reduction when standing still. 
---
No u can not
---
I'm level 313 and I've found a total of 4 explosive weapons, while "two boxing" (I run 2 accounts often), and no TSE's..  
---
Have a few friends who have more or less quit, because they got Fist fulls of them, which effectively broke the game (for them, making it too easy)
---
wonder if there are any smoothskins still kicking out there? naw there probably all dead at least I still have my co host *feral ghoul screams* ha good one
---
I went to it yesterday I'm level 13 and had a bad time dealing with the dragon thing and mutated ghoul things
---
Ohhhhhh the legendary effect. Gotcha. 
---
I thought it was all random just that certain events had a better chance of getting a plan or something like that. 
---
It won't be as cool as Steve (mire lurk king)
---
Yeah I'm a stealth build and don't use PA. As soon as I get into PA I'm instantly overencumbered because I lose all my weapon and chem weight reduction.
---
That's higher res than anything in the game 
---
I love this
---
Play the game. 
---
 I don't use VATS but even so trying to gun down swarming Ghouls is good for practice only.
---
 I keep a beastly sword for them. ;)
---
Yes the game would do well with bind on equip and bind on reward
---
i saw them for sell in grafton before.
---
Thanks vextroa (and squeakybeak) , I have him, will stay 15 minutes, then need to go to bed :)
---
Both grafton vendors can sell them
---
oh thank fuck, thought there was a whole thing of content i was missing out on..
---
I thought so too but a few ppl I’ve spoken to said that you can only get certain rare items from certain events. I have no clue how much truth their is to that but I’m big on collecting the costumes in this game so I’d like to find some type of guide since that’s apparently the only way you can get some of the rare apparel.
---
Cool! I got pretty lucky and got the coat on first try.. that said i did server  hop for about 90 mins before he appeared..
---
What do you think the ability would be vats? it would just be hip fire
---
Both?
---
Very Online people don't get that they're a defacto minority because they assume everyone else uses the internet the same way as them. When in reality 80% of customers aren't reading about games online, much less making posts about them. 
---
Like the title of this post is kinda hilarious/egotistical in that OP thinks he speaks for the playerbase, when Bethesda has more than enough telemetry data to make that judgement themselves.
---
he showed up when i was low level and trying to get a bag of junk back from near a deathclaw he gave me money and then i died again 
---
Pictures or it didn't happen, I kept nearly 5,000 legendary armor drops from 6 weeks of WhiteSprings and not a single person I've run with has seen a piece of wood armor above 1*, and I have half a dozen hard core traders watching out for any wood armor above 1 star
---
Defense in the game is a joke it would not be a detterent.
---
How does it work if they pick up your stuff and swap servers and block you?.
---
What if they just log out?.
---
Imagine the amount of posts Bethesda would be dealing with this and the backlash over doing this to stash upgrades.
---
This might be possible but it would require it to be a pvp server only system maybe. Not sure even the pvpers would be fully up for it over stash increases.
---
The only reason you’re noticing it more is because the community isn’t fixing it for them like they always do and now we’ve got server issues to deal with on top of it.
---
I’m not saying it’s acceptable or that they should get a pass, just that it shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone. It’s the main reason why I never bought one of their games until the GOTY came out and was on sale for $20 (at least over a year). 
---
I got this game at launch knowing it was going to be buggy, have issues, and be a pain in the ass. But I gave them my money because they were trying something different. It’s up to them if they want to prove they can make their shit work or if I go back to buying their games long after release and letting the community fix it for them
---
I don’t see it actually doing meaningful damage.  Neither do any of the others like electrically charged or plaguewalker.  
---
I stood still and let L3 ghouls attack me, and charged did no noticeable damage, but did cripple.
---
I hopped 30ish times without him appearing, gave up,  then saw this thread, a mere 10 hops I have the coat. :) 
---
I've heard about this, is it true? If so, where does it stop increasing, level 50?
---
yeah you never play a online game, if you think isnt about min max and builds. 
---
If Bethesda want to make this game actually something that will keep going over time outside the blind ppl that just fallow Bugthesda for no reason, they need to add some form of competion, from raid from world mega bosses, any online game have those. Just look any of the success ones, like Ark or The Forest. 
---
And for the is what ppl want min, max their build to dont lost time. Is a game isnt a real life. 
---
I'd instinctively be on alert for ghouls. 
---
I do have a targeting HUD on my main PA that I wear all the time and get a lot of sudden crashes to desktop.
---
I reloaded and intentionally wore a different PA for a while but was still getting CTD's with it.
---
For me, it seems to be somewhat related to how many people are on the server, or perhaps the game in general. I crash a LOT when I first get on (around 9pm-11pm central) and later at night, I can play for hours without crashing (midnight-3am central).

PVP seems like it was slapped onto a game that, regardless of how it was talked about before launch, is *heavily* PVE-focused.  It's lacking in NPCs, with most story told through notes, holotapes, and terminals, but otherwise it leans hard towards PVE activities with little for the PVP players they tried to appeal to.
---
PVP is a nuisance because that's what PVP is about in FO76.  Being a nuisance.  Some view it negatively as griefing, others view it positively as raiding, but ultimately there is nothing competitive about it outside of the more regulated PVP events (which, from what I've seen, aren't popular).  PVP players get bored, with few others to play with.  Any time I glance at the map, I see 1, maybe 2 
---
So they go after PVE players, PVE workshop owners, and level PVE camps.  Since PVE players are unlikely to be geared and specced for PVP, and the pacifist mode makes them helpless victims, only one side of that exchange is going to have any real fun.  As fun as leveling a lower level player's camp, or taking over their workshop, fairly certain they can't stop you can be.
---
I've been lucky in general, from what I've been reading, because I've had very few PVP experiences, and half of them were just players looting my bag because they came across it (which I consider PVP, since that's taking loot from me, and wasting the time it took to collect it).  While this means relatively comfortable playing for me (technical issues aside), it also means that any time PVP rears it's ugly (to me) head it drains whatever enjoyment I was having immediately.  I want no part in it, and even pacifist doens't let me fully opt out.
---
While the workshops were supposed to be a sort of hotspot of PVP activity, it seems like enough players are disinterested in fighting over them that I've rarely been attacked for owning one and I've never seen multiple players fighting for ownership.  Most seem to claim them more for the rewards and the occasional defense event than setting up resource gathering.
---
It seems like they're adding PVP servers (with no pacifist mode or other restrictions), which I think is good for the PVP players since it will let them connect with each other instead of with players who have pacifist on, and will relocate or server-hop instead of fight back.  However, it seems like they're leaving the non-PVP servers unchanged, which makes no sense to me.  Give both groups the experience they want, PVEVP isn't working out.
---
I wouldn't say just kinda, it pretty much is. There are only a handful of official statements about the game that you can objectively look at and say are wrong
---
I only wear my Tattered Dress and some other cosmetic items under my PA. I only take my PA off to sleep and craft, so the added weight of other things is pretty useless.
---
Sweet! I’m looking for deep pocket plans for combat and or marine armor (already have the limb version for the latter). Any idea who might have them?
---
Yep, Agreed, I've just had my base completely destroyed while participating in Death from Above by two players, when I got back after the event, it was trashed, practically everything was destroyed, I gave chase, then killed both the players twice, what sucks, is the materials they did drop, didn't make up for the materials it'll cost to re-make my base, after I've moved it obviously. They need to add a 'report feature' in game, having to go to [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) to report players is a chore. Frustrating, It's not like its Rust and I have items of value at my base (**well, value that they can stea**l) They can only destroy it and become wanted...Yay...GG...urghhh. 
---
DLC!
---
Do you regularly wear PA with a targeting HUD? If so, that might be the cause.
---
Im at the watoga train station if you guys want to add me and fast travel really quick. PSN is same as my username
---
Yeah, I thought I would hate multiplayer, because I'm an introverted weirdo who likes Fallout too much.
---
Welp, turns out there's more than just me out there who's like that!
---
Explosive weapon are not hard to get. I've seen several over the course of 3 characters. Having them does not make you a cheater. try again.
---
Ok, I'll give that a shot. Thanks!
---
You can change it back, as long as you have an option available. Tested right now on PC.
---
Keep an eye on updates and we will see you in the wasteland
---
I was told forever you could only ever get the handmade plan from a vendor and from level 15-44. I got it as a reward for One Violent Night at level 186
---
What console? 
---
My GPUs will agree
---
They are releasing the first DLC very soon or "Early 2019" whatever that means. Maybe you can sit down the game and come back in a month or 2 and be satisfied.
---
Please 👍👍

/u/Papa_Shekels not sure why you deleted your comment as you're 100% correct, I just figured if I said "exactly what was advertised" some moron would argue some obscure irrelevant point they got wrong
---
Can't confirm the validity of this but here is some info - [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p\_2jw2yNRY8JIE7qTfUwXTgivFDcuy0Xltb4N8kct4o/edit#gid=63173560](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p_2jw2yNRY8JIE7qTfUwXTgivFDcuy0Xltb4N8kct4o/edit#gid=63173560)

I updated my post with all the TSE weapons we have. Message me on Xbox when you’re ready to buy/Trade.

I believe they are called lever gun but I’m not sure.
---
Sorry, only place I have seen marine stuff is Watoga, White Spring Bunker and Harpers.
---
 Not had any luck at any for decent stuff. :(

You're probably not aware of this, but the BOS underarmor actually COSTS you resistances under Power Armor. It's bugged. -54 DR, ER, and RR.
---
I would be curious to see how that build solos Awol Armaments?
---
Would probably take more work than bethesda would want to put in. if the steal from you they cannot log off for 5-10 min if they "dc" in that time the stolen loot would be dropped into a bag which you could collect like you had died. or something like that.
---
Bump stash to 800 when they pop in containers. people will never be happy with stash size always claiming it is to small and they need more. Or just tie stash size and camp budget to the main questline so people's camps can actually grow as they advance in the game.
---
Yeah that’s what I thought. Am stalking watoga and Harper’s for them but haven’t come across them yet. Going to bed now, good night!
---
It'll definitely take a while longer now that they nerfed the nuke zone ghouls
---
My user is asrielgoatz
---
Ps4
---
Which platform?   
---
Curious as I've been asked to add this issue to the bug roundup I've got going, and it seems more console linked.
---
I like this game because it’s a lot like Fallout but at the same time it’s something new. New is so rare these days with online games. I know it resembles a lot of other games but it feels like its own unique thing and that’s so rare. 
---
Platform?
---
That could be a lot of fun. It wouldn't be for everyone, and those that didn't want it wouldn't use it. It would be a good way to have more equal footing in PvP. 
---
You know.....I wouldn't be surprised if troll camps became a thing because of it.
---
Dont use vats in that case
---
This is the main issue with the way this game was made, it was never design for pvp. It was always made with a pve mind. So the unblance on weapond/armor/perk make it terrible for pvp. 
---
That why ppl complain alot about the lie about the BETA. Since it wasnt a real BETA. It was just marketing (not well done by the way)
---
Right now after they announce the pvp new servers they making Bugthesda should have a running BETA so ppl can help balance it. 
---
But for the look of it is to much right now. They arent showing the ability to handle a online game. (and before you jump on me ESO isnt the same dev team that did Fallout 7shit, and for the look of it they didnt even ask they for help)
---
I'll trade or sell one if you want. 
---
Yea super annoying on PS4. Quantity and price does it now for about a week so far
---
Ps4 pro
---
My bad. 10. Thanks for the correction.
---
They taste similar in my opinion, the hard green parts on scorched are like rock candy. The scorched are alive just like ghouls, but the disease keeps them more in line as soldiers than ghouls are as regular mindless people.
---
Heh, key phrase being “it’s complicated” ;-)
---
The train station vendor, and Greg the Vendor Bot at the Responder building in town. I got my Lever Action Plan from Greg.
---
Didn't see this listed, Explosive Vents on the T-51b legs don't actually do anything (maybe all power armors, I've never seen anyone use them).
---
How do you change your face?
---
Yes but it disconnected out full party all three of us from different geological locations disconnect at the same time, it's sever side
---
I use a Furious Lever Action Rifle to kill Scorchbeasts on my current character. It is set up as a sneak/VATS build and yes VATS certainly does work on Scorchbeasts.
---
With the perks I have any hit can fill my Critical meter, Critical shots do +50% damage, the mysterious stranger likes to pop up and distract her and because I am using a Furious rifle every hit I do does more damage than the last. Action boy to refill AP quickly.
---
Next time there is a nuke at Whitespring, head over and join in the Bloated Ghoul killing. Gain a few levels, invest in some VATS perks and get a few legendary weapons on the way.
---
Scorchbeasts are nothing more than an annoyance, and most of my characters find her a real pain in the ass because she spends so much time in the air. My VATS character murders the shit out of Scorchbeasts... before they get a chance to land.
---
so u asking for more stuff that should have been on the game to be on the atom shop????
---
i mean really, the store is terrible already and the price conversion is one of the worst i see on game in a long time so no.... They should add all those stuff you ask for free. 
---
I role-play as a lone firebreather near the forest region, and a tech aficionado on another account.
---
Hemlock holes. Your welcome 
---
PVE and PVP servers is the best option.  PVE servers wouldn't need pacifist mode because there would be no slap damage, no handshake to enable PVP, and no destruction of camps or workshops (workshops might need some slight tweaking, since counter-claiming wouldn't be possible).  PVP servers would simply be unrestricted PVP all the time, no pacifist mode, no slap or handshake because it'd always be full damage, with the only exception being maybe reduced or no friendly fire within groups.
---
I don't think the mix is even necessary.  If you want PVE, and only PVE, you play on the PVE servers.  If you want PVP, or if you want PVE but also like the added danger of PVP, you want the PVP servers.  The PVEVP thing we have right now just leads to frustrations for PVE players who don't want their experience interrupted by other players, and PVP players who are lacking proper oppoents.
---
I have nothing to contribute but you should do a VM Varga build instead. 
---
Thank you very much for the information! Your Awesome I was looking for this forever! @ _Eise and Bunnyfufue 💕
---
I think alot of us are in the same boat. Mainly two options one is to dedicate your time to helping others prepare for dlc. Two would be to come back in a few months. No harm in it alot of games work well like that.
---
Oi m8
---
If you're on PC we should def team up tho
---
I wear pa constantly, although I do keep a set of armor on me and equipped. PA breaks incredibly fast in PvP, much like shooting parts off in fo4 and while I play in pacifist, I know I might need to PvP at some point and I don't want to risk a leg being broken and having to walk to the nearest stash for a different suit lol
---
Have you tried them vs NPCs?  
---
Just curious as I've not bothered, but wondering if anyone has used them vs low level ghouls or Molerats 
---
I'd pay $15 for a corgi
---
PC.
---
Last night for example the first 2 hours I CTD'd 10 times. After about midnight I never CTD'd again, despite still using the PA with the HUD.
---
I do Scan and Repair at least once a day, as well.
---
I pray you're just being a troll.
---
fun. There you. Go. There's your purpose. 
---
TBH I think they need a late game way to eliminate the acid need for refining ore. Maybe a plan to make a smelter?
---
As a heavy weapons build, an overly large chunk of my times goes into finding materials to make bullets. I stocked up over a thousand acid using the bulk acid glitch before they patched it, and I'm almost already out... and I don't even play that much. 
---
Having to farm acid *as well as* both lead and steel... just so I can actually play the game?
---
It's honestly becoming not worth it.
---
Do you have any 3*** ones? Otherwise I’ll juust buy some ammo and stims
---
Nah, first they need to update the atom shop and nerf whatever the best legendary effects are once explosive and two-shot drop to the bottom of the list. Then they should implement necessary improvements that players have already modded into this game.
---
Sorry for being salty, but seeing this list I'm recognizing so many issues I run into every time I play this game and it's starting to look like there is too much work getting this game to a state it should've been launched at that actual expansions or improvements beyond basic QOL are not gonna happen at all.
---
I think I'll make a new helmet for my PA without the HUD and see if that helps any, I will report back once I've got more data.
---
Thanks! Makes sense and doesn’t get too math-y
---
Ooh, sweet link!
---
Anyone still holding him?
---
Yes, we have 3 stars. 
---
I all ready have 2 legendarys I just want the plans
---
Contents 1 salt
---
The problem with this, however, is if you get insta-killed (taking enough damage to take you over the “downed” threshold), you can’t be revived. This is especially worrying if you’re PVPing - the bonuses won’t help you much. 
---
BSO has def had NV themed stuff in the Creation club on FO4, so it isn't hugely unreasonable to think it's a possibility for FO76.
---
mines.  so many mines.  
---
but they kill the SAM too, fuck it.   
---
Didn't say anything about struggling with Lvl 3 locks. Maybe read correctly before declaring how great you are at everything.  
---
And you must be a whole lot luckier than me, because I've never had enough glitches to eliminate every dud in a terminal hack. Half the time I don't get one to reset tries either.  
---
So my opinion stands that repairing the pipes (which can be done in less than a minute) is the consistently quicker method.  
---
You would be my hero!
---
I honestly lucked into them. First time i walked into the armory i saw them and bought them, without even having the plans for the x01 armor yet. I just knew i would need them at some point. 
---
I have a dream that one day i'll be able to take off my excavator suit.
---
Only way I could see it work is if it was literally a 10 to 1 (or more) ratio, and could only be applied to "masterwork" items.  
---
So if you wanted a 2 shot weapon you'd have to scrap TEN other two shot weapons to get it.  
---
Anything less and it's unbalanced, as evident from Fallout 4's legendary item crafting mods (I even made one
---
Myself.)
---
This is so sad, bethesda play ~~despacito~~ country roads :c
---
Its thru the laser grid and upstairs. Next to wear all the nuke information is. Its 3 terminals it looks like an armory. Theres power armor in the back you cant get and mr handy floating around.Those terminals sell x01 mods the others dont.
---
&gt; Your one to talk about grammar.
---
Irony at its best.  
---
Very nice! I love trying to find locations like this
---
That's what I'm talking about
---
Agreed. I get this stupid grin every time i see Grahm, just because he is not commonplace. Making NPCs common would diminish his value beyond his role as a merchant. Then again, I've never personally liked the NPCs in Fallout games. The way I play makes the isolation and lack of interaction that much more immersive.
---
I'm disappointed I can't nuke it 
---
But that's the whole thing. It does matter what it's called, since it's not broken by the current definition of pacifist.  
---
We go in as a team of 3-4 normally. We like to stick to the divide. One of our go to spots is Pleasant Valley Train station, but it varies.  
---
I saw a group of streamers take on a bunch of level 50 or something deathclaws there during the beta.... Just yesterday I found it and avoided it for this reason (I'm level 16).... This changed after that I guess???
---
This. ^
---
Ah, I actually remember hearing “mass attenuation” years ago. Thanks, that triggered a quick side read and a lot of it filled in some hinge
---
Was that a nuke? Guess we are all going to die from all that harmful radiation! Wait, nevermind.
---
Tried using them on NPCs and Players, thought maybe just the explosive animation wasn't happening but it seems to just literally do nothing.
---
Yes we have 3 star ones 
---
Why are we still getting 3+ disconnects in an hour? How has this issue not been fixed? 
---
Yeah doing this helped out so much. Thank you!
---
No I was actually doing pvp with some people when I found this out and many times when ever I should have been downed my health actually when straight back to full it looks like going under 25% health to quickly makes the stim heal time be instantaneous
---
Basically stating the obvious.
---
Its sad ppl are that dumb and need a youtuber to tell them common sense.
---
I like the idea, but I think we'd need a lot more gear and legendary effects for that to work, and some better balancing (like what they're trying to do with two shot and explosive).  It'd definitely be nice to not have to rely on RNG for everything, but there would need to be incentive to use more than just the best meta combination of effects.
---
Also we would probably need more stash, or a rework of how storage works (separate containers by type, capacity based on number of items instead of weight, etc), or experimenting would run into problems since gear in the stash is at full weight.  Hard to hold onto multiple weapons and armor sets as well as the materials to mess with it all.
---
Diablo has character classes. We are able to swap perk cards on a whim even during combat if we choose. A cap sink to reset our special would be nice, but keep in mind we have vastly more freedom than a game with character classes. It's not like Diablo lets your barbarian become a necromancer so you can try it out.
---
I meant more in the sense that if you get instantly killed by say, an explosive double-barrel shotgun. The damage taken would instantly kill you, with no chance to stim yourself. 
---
However, with Fireproof perk cards, I could see this working. 
---
Since the last patch i went from never CTD'ing (and I run 3 clients on the same PC) to up to 6+ an hour.  Something changed in the last updating resulting in increased instability for allot of people. :(
---
What’s the 3rd star? I’m not gonna be able to see them in trade 
---
It's nice being chonky and when I'm not in PA I use vanguard and unyielding as well as sentinel. Most legendary armor is good and you can build perks and mutations around them accordingly, the best bet is find a full suit of 3* and then workout what works for you. Currently sentinel is broken for pvp because you can just stand there and tank damage. 
---
Really curious, please do let me know.
---
Good thing you're just one person, a drop in the bucket with no sway whatsoever. At least on the internet you can whine and complain for virtual points.
---
They had a explosive double barrel and I don't really have any defense perks just scaly skin
---
A wasteland corgi. Plump little bum puttering across the wasteland... fur scattered with little radiation burns.... ma heart...
---
I am very interested in knowing where you land when you fast travel to your camp. 
---
Of course, fo4 also had the mysterious serum so that was pretty nice
---
I believe so, one of the “open” houses is the presidential one, with a room with a large desk, as well a living room downstairs, 2 rooms upstairs with their own bathrooms 
---
How much for the plans then?
---
I have some super-basic, but critical questions for you that can make things easier, (and maybe you are already doing them, but they could be simple to miss since this game is so sparse with instructions) -   
---
**1)** are you using your hot keys/favorites ?   
---
Generally speaking, I use 1-7 for weapons (1 is my primary, 2 is my melee, 3 is close in ranged, 4 is grenade, 5 for sniper, 6+7 for secondary grenade or situational weapon).   
---
8 for purified water, 9 for Radaway, 0 for Stimpaks.   
---
The trick (if you can call it that) is to be **consistent**, so that you can swap weapons or hit a stim FAST under pressure.   
---
OH- And don't forget to reload ALL your guns after a fight... ;)   
---
**2)** Are you maintaining your "survival" stuff? Eating food, drinking water, keeping rads in check, not walking around diseased? Again, "simple" stuff, but it can radically affect combat performance. Check your "effects" from time to time... Hotkey water, eat often, get "Good Doggy" under endurance\* for easy food/healing. (I usually just get it in a perk pack rather than spending a point on it). And rest in a bed, to get the 5% xp bonus...   
---
**3)** Scrapping and modding weapons? Vanilla guns are not great after level 10... While it's not wise to get "attached" to a gun past it's level peak, you should definitely upgrade at least your primary weapon (Hardened or Powerful Auto receivers + Piercing Magazines are the best upgrades).   
---
**4)** Check your map... if there are multiple higher level players ahead of you in a location, DON'T GO THERE YET. High level players spawn high level mobs...   
---
OR -   
---
Stash ALL your junk (so you don't lose it when you die), get your best gun or melee and DO Go there, try to stay close to the high levels (or better yet, team up) and get a single hit on any mob you can reach. Turn on pacifist mode, throw nades... you get xp for anything you hit that dies later...   
---
**5)** Fire Axes - If you don't have a good melee weapon, or perks for the one you have, get or make a level appropriate fire axe. 3 lbs base, very good damage. Ask a high level friend to make you one with spikes. Simple, point, click smack.   
---
Even with no melee skills, the ol'Fire Axe is a decent tool. Available from Level 5 up... Great for when you get caught sniping by pesky mutant hounds or high speed ghouls.   
---
I'm sure there are a billion more little things that many players take for granted as well...   
---
Good hunting... see you in the world. 
---
Thank you! I was actually scouting the map to try and find some location that would be already sheltered, possibly military looking, like the BoS camps in Cranberry Bog.
---
But unfortunately all those kind of spots are marked, so it doesn't allow us to C.A.M.P. at them. :C
---
Thanks, now it'll be stuck in my head too.
---
Thanks, I'll try to test myself since you've given it a go (try to replicate the issues then include details).
---
Actually inside the monorail, already tested it. ;D
---
Player trades. Buy plans. 
---
I added that he says he was banned 7 times for duping to the list  above... So he's bought the game a lot but I suppose if he was selling duped items like everyone else he was making enough money to justify it.
---
Were you being killed after one shot? 
---
Yeah, that’s my struggle too
---
Level 110, I've been playing a hell of a lot less. Most of my time "playing" is spent cruising the market subs and Facebook looking for the top tier gear I'm after. Grinding events and nuke zones for legendaries for days has never even gotten me a good enough piece to trade out.
---
I'm still hopping on for a bit every few days to play with some lower level buddies, but I'm pretty much maxed out without something new. (I've been posting the following a lot, haha) I'd like a system where we can remove legendary modifiers from weapons and armor, and apply them to our own, even at an astronomical cost per removal/addition. It would give so much more longevity to the game, allowing us to craft our own perfect sets of weapons and armor.
---
I have a pole hook with almost the same perks. Love it! Actually, it's kind of what prompted me to write this post. The pole hook, Pitchfork, baseball bat etc are kind of useless when compared to a sledgehammer, grognaks axe, war drum with similar stats because the swing speeds are exactly the same but the damage output is significantly less. If they natively had a slightly faster swing speed because of their lower weight, they would have comparable dps and be worth using.
---
Idk, I'm just going of my own experiences with these weapons and maybe there is some other benefit that i don't realize.
---
I've done it maybe 10 times, 3 were bugged and you could not click the device. 1 the scorch beast never showed up and the event timed out. 
---
The loot is the same as you get from a regular scorch beast, not really worth it, I've stopped going to it When I see it.
---
Go to Whiteprings and buy some shit. 
---
I only put "often" because I didn't want to make it an absolute.  I personally have never had one that was not linked to the mobs level but since I have not done everything in the game I left it open.
---
Rifleman, not Commando? I wonder, then, if Gunslinger would affect the Flamer Pistol.
---
Buy plans and junk from vendors up to 1400 a day sell your resources to them ..rinse repeat 
---
This is actually very bad. I almost never go into the bleed out state, which means the effect won't even work.
---
After I lost my stims yes before i lost all my stims I could tank a good amount of shots
---
I gotta work out some way to deyermine what plans I don't have
---
 Yeah, its good practice but if there are Ghouls everywhere my sword is far more efficient.
---
Sorry not me, gone to bed..
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
76 really feels like an evolution of the series even though the timeline is going backwards. I really like the major decisions that made this game the way it is. I like it in almost every aspect, even though I can’t yet build large settlements or become a power armor collector like I could in FO4. LOVE THE GAME!
---
This is completely wrong. I personally enjoy and care about FO76 a lot, which is precisely why I feel like bringing these bugs to Bethesda is important. They can't fix what they don't know about, and this game has too much potential to let it languish in the realm of "good enough".
---
Claim the Power Plant workshops. They make 8 fully charged cores per hour
---
 If you want to slap me and see if I am interested in PVP, that is fine. But if I do not slap back,  and you keep trying to get me into PVP, go F*CK yourself, griefer!
---
And sometimes it goes back a few words in the sentence to "correct" it.  That's really obnoxious.
---
Buy all those lovely Ivory Grips 
---
7 accounts.. wow, what a loser.
---
Maybe it does work then... But it’s also an expensive endeavor to undertake (buying the aforementioned armor). Maybe one day I’ll be able to look into this as a viable build. Still, thanks for the info!
---
I only went into the bleed out state twice
---
Dude.  Take a break.  Go play something else.  
---
I have over 1600 hours invested in another game I love, but we’re taking a vacation from each other while I get my wasteland on.  
---
It’s not cheating.  
---
Sometimes you just need to spend time with your other friends while stories develop you can share again at a future date.  
---
We’ll still be here.  
---
Maybe not me at that moment, but others will.  I might be building spaceships on some lonely planet.  
---
But I always return to my Fallout...and I really do like this one.  
---
I was serious sry. Vats isnt good in fallout 76 i have noticed. I gave up on using it to miss 95%
---
RNG I guess. Did you try it against PVE enemies?
---
Sneezing irl can cause this game to crash.
---
They have a monitor at one of the entry points for the production room. 
---
Something like this might be better-suited for /r/fo76FilthyCasuals, and probably on a weekend?
---
Whaaat. You mean not using a critical part of the game, that the game basically revolves around, isn’t a valid solution???
---
I completely agree with you though. Was trying to help out a lowbie on feed the people and accidentally laid into him. Of course it didn’t hurt hurt but he got all wary. It was actually really adorable how he kept an eye on me (and kept his distance) the whole time after that. The he just left and I didn’t even get to give him some goodies. :(
---
We need a “oops didn’t meant to” emote. 
---
I'd like a browser based atom shop so I don't have to log in to check out what's new/on sale.
---
It's been 200 hours and I haven't met him
---
Wow. That's crazy.
---
Just that reminder that youtubers are shit ppl and have a negative, not positive, effect on gaming.
---
Glad he's on pc at least as I'm on console. I've noticed there is very little being sold on eBay for console. 
---
Unfortunately that aspect of gaming will give pc a bigger black eye.
---
I have three alts full 😭 nothing to do with them until a new DLC 
---
Yeah, I do that with path of exile and used to with D3 as well. Have too many hours to count in it, but really only go hard every 3-4 seasons. 
---
Please elaborate. Because apart from it being "broken" if the weightless perk scaled the same for swing speed as it does for weight (which i already addressed) i honestly don't know what other downside there would be. This is how systems work in many other games and it makes for a more balanced game as all weapons are potentially viable in their own way.
---
If anything, it's already broken with the Sledge/super Sledge, grognaks axe, way drum, etc. far outpacing all other melee weapons in terms of dps. At least that's been my experience.
---
Also, in case i need to say it, i am talking about basing swing speed on initial item weight, not adjusted weight using perk cards.
---
PC has a mod but I'm assuming you're on console. For-tu-nat-e-ly (robot voice) the decoration vendor sells a bunch of unique items that you can only buy there, so you may not have those. Basically all the "resort" decorations that are all around 1k caps each. 
---
I muled mine to alt, kept grinding. 
---
I haven't seen third season yet. Looks good though! 
---
Np man it seems to be working for me also if you want a good and fun build go for a tse Western revolver I don't even have all the cards for non automatic pistols and the revolver is doing close to 900 damage and im not useing nerd rage cards or adrenaline reaction
---
There were some mumblings of people making a killing on ebay with duped items. I'd say if that is what the end goal was, hes still up more greenbacks. $5 for a gun you've potentially got 1000s of and an apparently willing customer base.
---
Then why did you go through all of that if it was boring and empty the entire time?
---
Kind of a dorky thought but itd be cool to be able to recharge one fusion core with a solar panel thing that could be located on top of your camp, or just outside. Or just solar power in general. 
---
Another good combination is dirty army helmet, gas mask and farmhand clothes 
---
Unique build
---
What is your carry weight currently?  In the X-01 I currently have 380 carry weight with no chem buff, just PA mods. I can buff with cards and chems over 400. Escavator you can go even higher but with X-01 I have no fear of soloing anything in the game. 
---
I don't know about you, but the way I do it is by getting a shotgun, equipping maxed out enforcer, and shooting the robot arms off.
---
That's not a good reason
---
Prob got nailed with a cease and desist.
---
Interesting, i'm gonna try it that seems like some buggy interaction going on.
---
I must be in the minority who loathes most of the voiced npcs. Repeating the same idiotic barks over and over.There are complete transcripts of all the dialogue on the net and really  it's mostly  bad mad max fan fic.   
---
Being the sole survivor has been a narrative device in quite a few games and no one got upset
---
Put your own second bag next to theirs and don't interfere with their bag if you want to benefit them.
---
My camp budget couldnt handle such a machine.
---
Very nice OP hopefully its not too long until we have them +1. :)
---
Yep i’m having the same problem on PC. My friends are too.
---
I laughed when a guy messaged me on Xbox. He was pissef I killed him because he was destroying my camp trying to kill ghouls. Then he comes back again and shoots me. Killed him again. COMES BACK AGAIN and I kill him. So I proceeded to demo his camp until he logged out of the server.
---
I've never gone out of my way to destroy people's business, but after three attempts to kill me and destroy my camp, you're doneskies.
---
I just wish they would bring back synths... okay I just wish they'd bring back Nick. He was my favourite 
---
😂
---
My ocd hates this. 
---
Or maybe, just maybe, we like graham so much because he is the only npc. 
---
When I first read that I thought it said Heather Grahm's ramble. If only.
---
Yes I guess I mean im a stealth build with a suppressed lever action so I don't really take damage in pve
---
Yeah, i figured as much, but they could at least keep playing the title music or something. It's just boring staring at the same picture and trying to read the tips that change way too fast for like 2 full minutes. At least in fo4 you could interact with the little 3D models in the losing screen. That was kinda fun.
---
Just seems like a step backwards is all
---
I know this is late but it's dead wrong. I've gotten wanted level (3x actually) by accidentally shooting a player's crop while trying to kill mole rats. Not everyone who is "wanted" is a dick, the game just has a ridiculously sensitive flagging system.
---

---
You could become a necessary trader throughout the world. For instance you could take orders and craft items for people at their request at low prices or for free. Whatever makes you feel needed
---
Ohhh wow ok this is probably what I’ve been doing wrong! I’ll thank you!
---
Aye, most likely. If I knew a person irl that stole and sold stuff, I'd think they were a loser as well. Yes, duping is not the same as stealing but hey, I can't think of a rl equivalent. I'd say knock offs or things but those are not the same quality of item, unlike a digital dupe.
---
I should have jumped on another copy of 76 when it was cheap... Only way I'm gonna be able to do the Alt thing  I guess haha
---
Pretty sweet little cozy place.
---
Looking for Bear rug plans BTW, anyone have em?
---
How about health of objects reflecting their real damage level? I'm tired of looking at a wall that's 10% health, but cant repair it... because it's not damaged.
---
Still a loser.
---
Oh yeah I should also mention I got disconnected a bunch of times during that horrible quest at the DMV ... I was fit to be tied by the time I got through that one!  I can’t believe that there isn’t a way to give you the option of connecting to your last server or connecting to a random one ...  I can’t imagine it would be that hard 
---
Why do people seem bothered by the idea of putting lots of hours into FO76, burning through the content, getting bored, and then going off to play something else?  You probably more than got your money's worth of entertainment and there's lots of good games coming out to play.  On a per-hour basis it's probably been some of the cheapest fun you can find.
---
If you get into something else and don't feel like coming back later (assuming they release more content as they've said they would), what's the big deal?
---
I might just do that, thanks!
---
I've been getting really annoying game freezes since the patch. If there are a ton of enemies around and I open my pip-boy to use any kind of aid item, my game will sometimes completely freeze beyond any alt+F4'ing or task manager fixes. I have to ctrl+alt+delete and sign out in order to be able to use the PC further. 
---
Level 245 here and the game has def lost me. Waiting for division 2 🔥🙏🏼
---
I’m aware of it. I still wear it, haha. 
---
you gotta make sure the terminal is connected to the same  network of wires as the switch power and door.  so like terminal &gt; power.  power &gt; switch &gt; door.  the terminal should be able to talk to the switch through the power source.  just have to be sure the wires don't get mixed up.  if you end up connecting the terminal directly to the switch it might power OFF the terminal thereby locking even yourself out from outside.  
---
These are all things i would love to have. They need to drop some prices.
---
You don't need to play the game every day, for 8hs you know?  You can play a few hours today, maybe tomorrow play other game.  
---
I still coming back to Skyrim, rd2, teso, fo4, bfv, pubg, etc... Lol. 
---
If you got a clan or mates in 76 just have them bank stuff for ya on your alts.
---
I am more hyped for Anthem. What attracts you to Div2 instead?
---
Have the voice actor for Marge's sister in The Simpsons. They fit pretty well.
---
Actually, I do too. I usually forget to swap out. 😋
---
This is a great idea for an event! 
---
A giant version of just about any of the 76 creatures that’s minimally interested in you but dead-set on destroying something specific out there. I can imagine it swatting away players with ease, spawning groups with a legendary leader to try and push you off. 
---
You're on Xbox? 
---
That's pretty cool i had no idea. cheers for the reply
---
I want an eyebot so bad... ED-E!
---
Is it me or does their latest blog post seem a bit underwhelming? 
---
I got hooked on the PVP mechanics and all the possible builds you could do. The story was good and all however I enjoy getting sweaty and running from 4 people while trying to murder you for all your loot 😂
---
Gotcha
---
When I get wanted I usually load up my character with all the junk I get rid of and then I'm just a giant pinata 
---
While i will always have issues with those that exploit. I am glad this one is telling others not to do it anymore.
---
Its a small win for us i guess.
---
I *REALLY* don't wanna find out
---
Do you have the purple PA helmet light like I do? That's when this phenomena started for me .
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Bear rug plans can be purchased as static stock from one of the vendors at Whitesprings resort mate
---
Check your local gay bar. 😁
---
Lol, I love the loot grind and would prefer PVE.  
---
Nice one, never even been down there...thanks :-)
---
At this point I would be happy to just have my camp invincible against players while in passive mode.
---
Pacifist only applies to damaging other players, not their camps. been like this since the beta. Even if pacifist is turned on, if you shoot any part of their camp you will become instantly wanted.  
---
Well obviously you won't scrap *your* screwdriver. Just the random ones you pick up. Maybe it slots into the pipboy.
---
Ran out of things to do a long time ago. But i found alot of joy in helping others. It might not be for everyone. But i cannot get any stronger and i have everything i require. Both as a vault dpser and a vault healer for the clan.
---
So spending time prepping others has been alot of fun. Mind you we do this through the text chat community.
---
They're wrong. It only applies to players. Even with pacifist on, if you shoot someones camp you will become instantly wanted. 
---
Happens pc as well.
---
It is entertaining yes, yes it is. Particularly useful for damage not really.
---
Sorry, I wasn't accusing YOU of this, I was just saying I have seen more than a few comments from people who blame and/or downvote other users for **mentioning** bugs. I was referring to them with my comment, and that their presence can negatively impact the community and stall progression.
---
Also, you are definitely right, and I think you worded your feelings (which I share) on the matter very eloquently :)
---
Yup... I have given up on this challenge. 
---
Grahm is proof that good things remain good so long as you're not saturated with them.
---
I had to sort by controversial. I feel ya, man. This is the most disappointing day yet for 76 and forums in general. All those numerous critiques against Bethesda should be shotgunned into the face of everyone who upvotes this puerile analogue trash.
---
Can't they just go play StarDew Valley and stop trying to ruin everything complex and fun in gaming.
---
I’d buy too. Size small or medium
---
In general it just makes the game worse.
---
Especially because this is an RPG, and people will scream constantly to nerf builds and legendaries and guns and armeo because they're good in PvP.
---
PvP just, shouldn't have been a thing tbh.
---
Adds nothing to the game as is and never will.
---
This is very cool, thanks for sharing. I feel like the lack of lag and rubber banding would make it feel less authentic, though... ;)
---
Nothing. You just get no rewards for the event and the generators for at the workshop won’t work until you do
---
According to benchmarks, your CPU is comparable to the i5 2400, which is 4 generations behind the recommended CPU.  Compared to way-back, processors can't really be compared by looking at clock speed and core count alone anymore, since the architectures keep changing in other ways.
---
For GPU, I'd check if your 1070 is the 3GB or 6GB version, the launcher's complaint has me suspecting it may be the 3GB (which should probably work ok enough anyway, your main bottleneck is CPU).
---
I think the RAM checker is confused, because it didn't expect anyone to have 32GB.  Possible it's looking at some other stat in the background, but who knows on that one. :P
---
You sure they want to trade? Somebody shooting you is a pretty dumb way to get your attention.
---
More rewards if you do.
---
I think you just get the same outcome
---
You on pc? In interested in for profit no griefing pvp
---
I have repaired it, but not fully.  I still got a reward, and the 100 power boost to workshops still took effect.  I can only guess that perhaps the completion awards are superior/boosted in your case?
---
Camps are structures like all the other in the wasteland, which dont get attacked at all so I think that should be the case for our camps too.. 
---
Esp for the pvp servers.
---
That's so bizarre. I've had like 2 crashes on PC in the last week. I don't know why some people get so many issues.
---
It kinda sucks having someone come cut your rope and run off onto another server 😩👎🏽
---
what does that mean? you take 50% extra damage?
---
Fuck steelheart 😂
---
Well when i'm shot and I stop running, turn around and then they decide to use the emote, i'm guessing they "want" to trade. Shooting someone to get their attention is pretty dumb but apparently some people feel it's the best way. 
---
juggling numbers in an inventory is not survival, its excel 
---
they were probably there for the ground zero achievement 
---
Does gun slinger or rifleman affect it though? That's my question.
---
You leave Sullivan out of this and lay off the gutbuster, dwarf!
---
Can't repair for free but you can use caps rather than resources. Just move your base a little. When you place it back down everything will be in your storage repaired. 
---
So nobody figure out where TV3 mapped works?  I mean...eventually it should work where the image shows.  Meantime...?
---
I run heavy and I’ve never had an issue with the heavy gun damage, it seems be right about where should be. I love my laser Gatling but even tse it’s still weaker than it should be so energy guns truly need a solid boost. 
---
Corpsey up there is the ideal roommate too, quiet, tidy and a non-smoker.
---
Add Metal fences akin to the small wodden ones.
---
Okay, that is something to search on. I found the one about magazines:
---
"Using a collected magazine grants a temporary, unique bonus. You can find the same issue multiple times, and each time it's used will either award the bonus, or refresh the timer if it's already active."
---
I found this in multiple places, but I have not found one regarding bobbleheads. 
---
Anything fully broken gets deleted though. This only works with damaged but not broken items, and I was talking about fully broken.
---
I’m wondering if you go into a mine or cave, will you survive the blast? I have not been in a blast zone so far, and I am wondering if those are viable options to survive?
---
All I know is whatever subcontractor built those stripes pipes should be taken out and shot.
---
Can it fly too please?
---
Plenty of people have, they are quite rare and worth a lot of caps or items on trading forums.
---
Can things be fully broken? I've always seem a destroyed version of the item giving you the option to repair. 
---
Heavy damage isn't necessarily BAD per se, but when you look at the DPS you can get with other builds it is kind of sad.
---
Ok great, I'll add you, please message me when you're on next
---
Yep
---
That’s what I meant. If something is at half health or whatever, moving fixes it. If something is broken and gives the option to repair, like a turret being unable to fire because its health is at 0, moving deletes it. Otherwise you could exploit it.
---
I am suuuuure it'll come down again haha
---
Bethesda didn't hit their sales goals. They reduced the price of the game.
---
You aren't even convincing Bethesda with your arguments.
---
Does that include the marine wetsuit?
---
I got an instigating hunting rifle but I think that's it
---
Also why does assault rifles weigh so much
---
I'd agree with that, but fallout 4 was the first one I played at launch on pc all the others was on consoles so only had Bethesda fixes. As I see it this is still the worse I've seen maybe not for you but I've had Dozens of bugs in this one in a few hours that took hundreds of hours to get in their other games.
---
I don't think so. I've fixed my camp multiple times this way 🤔
---
Excel is way more complicated than either keep or don't keep lol if your juggling crap in your inventory it's because you have too much stuff, plain and simple. I have a full set of weapons for my character, all the unique weapons, materials to upkeep my weapons and PA, and four power armor frames, and still have plenty of space.
---
All I'm saying is the management isn't that hard and takes at most a few minutes of game time. Notice patterns in what you use, and get rid of what you don't. 
---
Yep. 
---
Couldn't agree more! I've been to the Greenbrier twice before the game launched and couldn't stop gawking and laughing as I walked the Whitespring. Even the shelter entrance and shops were in the right place.
---
For those traveling through the area (IRL) it's worth the time to check it out, but call in advance. The guides are awesome and most grew up in the shadow of the secret and have interesting stories. 
---
Can you send the link? 
---
aw man, I thought something was weird, lol
---
Through the Bethesda launcher
---
*RAPTOR CHICKEN*
---
Exploding randomly when hit is fun and can stagger the attacker, but it's not a game-changer like Speed Demon or Marsupial. Never tried it with Strange In Numbers shared, though.
---
Login to Bethesda launcher on PC 
---
I will be honest.  I have one friend we keep him out the party and I target and hammer him on pacifist.  The tse I have and his melee build mean I just bounce explosions off him.  He's like a homing artillery strike.  It works real well on the golf course or where a ton of ghouls spawn.  Just have him pull aggro VATS him and poof no ghouls
---
The game seems absolutely awful and the PVP system was clearly the worst of both worlds well before launch but being able to shoot people while they’re trading with a NPC sounds hilarious
---
When this dumpster fire goes F2P in a few months I’ll definitely try that with some friends 
---
Itll be ready to download.
---
I found a 1* Vampire. Put a precise 50 cal receiver on it and the paint from the atom shop. It’s my go to for the lvl 5 super mutants that spawn near my camp. 
---
I absolutely love how he opens his video telling people to visit his site to buy dupes. Everyone, throw your dupes away then click here!
---
Happens on pc also.
---
This is a good daily reminder.
---
Flamer - Fuel craft is 9 not 90 each still need someone to add the zero. It burns ammo faster than any other weapon in the game. Doee almost zero damage even using the correct setup compared to almost all other weapons. But its biggest problem even repaired to 200% it breaks within a few mobs. Normally i have to carry several on me and a good 10k ammo for the queen fight.
---
I placed it down when i got my Shotgun build working as both of mine can kill everything in one shot outside of sbs and qsb.
---
I would rather have servers fixed first but nice place
---
This is a really good idea.
---
They did?
---
K
---
In a small house near the Nuka Cola plant. Interestingly, you can place a camp inside and build on the entire house.
---
Are all the underarmors like that? I wear the enclave urban underarmor in PA.
---
Oh God...I had blocked that out of my memory. That was one kinky mutant.
---
The robots.
---
Aww you remember the gift he gave you for losing 
---
Seriously, everything else is being manned by robots, why not the radio stations... two stations definitely are.
---
The rallying cry of every legendary super mutant. 
---
You can definitely survive in the Whitesprings bunker but it is the only location I’ve tried so far
---
76 has rad sponge and ghoulish.  Shared on a team and you are pretty much invulnerable to radiation.
---
I got bloodied abd faster fire rate. Im fine)
---
I hate this bug, I'm CAMPed in the monorail pylon and have a really precise build, but this bug has left my place littered with stair wells and foundations that i cant move anymore, I really don't want to have to reset it, so I'm gonna hope an update fixes this soon
---
If I remember correctly the story is from a novella and a really quick read. It’s worth it. 
---
Different teams I believe, content and fixes are not the same folks :-)
---
Thanks for sharing this!
---
Y'know, now that I think of it. It might've been a Quake mod. Zeroster or something like that. But yeah, fart sounds and the minor screen wobble and half jump was always a laugh.
---
I did the day before patch. Was highly confused.
---
They could introduce Riot Gear (which the Ranger armour basically is, sans the overcoat).
---
Totally lol
---
Made a 3rd character and in the first 20 levels i saw Grahm about 7-8 times. Nearly always near Sunshine meadows. he even stopped outside once for about 10 minutes. I sent up flares and messaged people on the server but nobody came to see him. 
---
It’s not a bug it’s a feature 
---
The first time i had no idea.The second time(only other) I was the kid ..ICE CREAM! ICE CREAM! ICE CREAM!
---
Well well need to see what the new mode brings as it may work on many levels like other games that have long term mb player based. But as for the current system yes it needs work but there is def a need to separate the pve/pvp ppl for sure. And yes what we have now is broken and does need help, but open pvp is different. And there needs to be a reason to hunt other players or raid camps. Pvp is fun but the lack of consequence as it is negates it. I'm all about the coming pvp update but some balancing is needed for sure as many player dont have tse weapons or sentinal/assassin armor to gain an edge. Pr the ppl that grinded out serums and mutations already. Some will always have more time to play than others and will have the edge no matter what bit still we need some change first lol. I'll take whatever changes they can bring to us!!
---
I'd agree the game is boring now been like that after less than a 100 hrs but ppl don't like to hear that. Farming is the only reason to play now and making new characters is pointless the content/quest isn't fun after the first time. This game needs to pump out meaningful content not stupid kill quest and area exploration. Which looks like what's coming with the vaults.  I'm not even a developer and have tons of amazing ideas to make the game more than a looter shooter.
---
I had a blueprint from my maxed out camp and when i moved camps i ended up having about 1/3 of the bar left to fill. So unless its a display bug, but i definitely was able to fill more stuff. I assume its a hidden mechanic to encourage us to move our camps around at least a few times?
---
I remember picking up the bozar and putting down every other weapon because it was the best. Lol now heavy weapons are a joke. Big flashy waste of lead and it's sad.
---
Stitches!
---
Most of my problems have been server issues and CTDs. But I’ve seen some of the shit people have dealt with. 
---
I guess all we can do is hope they fix as much as they can as fast as they can and fix as much as they can with F5 and skyrim2 before they release those
---
I set up in one of these for a while. Very cool location, but the perpetually open doors got to me in the end; the CAMP system is too fussy to let you block them up properly. 
---
Totally agree! I really like pvp in this game even though i definitely think it needs some serious balancing work (remove one-shot god guns). 
---
I play on xbox and i'm always looking for other players that want to play hunted/hunter. 
---
 
---
It was like 8-9 weeks of dupers doing their thing without any repercussions so to hear a different tune is nice.
---
Maybe they could release the same design, but without the shimmer effect. That way tee #6 is still an exclusive shirt, but the tricentennial saluting vault boy design can still get put on a shirt. 
---
I'm looking for a M or L. Herein lies the bidding war
---
16 times the detail
---
bugs
---
duping
---
server crashing
---
console crashing
---
the huge issues with PC on release where the game would delete itself 
---
these were all advertised, I definitely saw these mentioned in the live action trailer that didn't show any gameplay. whoops! guess I'm a moron for not liking the game as much as you 
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **6th Cakeday** amdnivram! ^(hug)
---
"Disenchant"
---
Oh, I remember.   I didn’t even need a damn power fist...
---
Does anyone have an update on this? I have just gotten this exact glitch.
---
Fallout: 76/76 weight limit. 
---
How much,of wat ammo 
---
I liked PoE.  Played quite a bit, but I’m a builder.  I play FO4 to ease the pain, but Space Engineers, a game that has a horrible past, scratches my itch.  
---
76, with all its bugs, has zero issues compared to how SE started.  
---
There is literally no end game as there is no game.  No levels.  No XP.  
---
Just an open sandbox of space and your will to do stuff.  
---
I will be playing 76 for a loooooong time.  It has stuff...and people.
---
:)
---
I believe that has been cleared up at some point, thanks.
---
I've gotta go play some tragic the garnering now. Have a nice day
---
Then we could recreate the campfire scene in Blazing Saddles at our CAMP! 
---
Love all the ideas. I am level 112 and def feel like they missed the mark with the card system. Hopefully changes will be made. 
---
🤞
---
I heard that they actually do protect you from explosions.... I think I'll test that with the orbital strike beacon...
---
Thanks for the post. Happens on xbox too
---
There's a nice midsized stone plateau just west of Fort Venture that allows construction, it has some deck chairs and goods scattered there already. It's a good elevated defense base with only 2 pathways leading to the central area.
---
I just made a rant post about the PVP/wanted system dumpster fire on this same sub. You would probably enjoy it.
---
Enclave underarmor works fine. 
---
 theres alot more important stuff to fix n address before this lol
---
They have the burping with the Cannibal perk
---
Most people that PvP don't play in passive mode. I know I dont. He probably wasn't either. 
---
yes
---
I wasn't in passive mode either.
---
What
---
RL knockoffs are pretty similar. Wearing a $40 pair of nike knockoffs to trick people into thinking you shelled out the $200 for the real deal is not disimilar to running around with a duped TSE and gloating about it
---
It was better before Tse, it’ll be a little better after Tse nerfs. 
---
Plus, if it could also negate any stealth effects you were using. Just like flashing on your lights for a second. Or readying a weapon. Gain you some unwanted attention...
---
Over 100 rounds .38 and .44 bunch of fusion cores and some other stuff
---
Good thing Bugthesda owns more than just "Pier One"
---
Steve must be a cultured Mirelurk King 🤴 
---
Xbox here and it at least appears that I crash more with the mod on than without.  
---
I was fully PA all the time; now I’ll be transitioning away as I find legendary armor pieces to cover when I am out of PA
---
One time there was a guy one shotting people spawning into Drop Site.
---
Yeah Juicehead did some thing on how much they were making. $1000+ for a seller just on a single listing in one example... i think. 
---
Money talks and Bethesda accounts walk, apparently
---
You are basically just asking for the old perk system. Coulda just said that. I agree that the current perk card system is half baked right now. It needs something done. 
---
Even before I got a tse 50 mine seemed pretty good but the Gatling laser (it’s my favorite weapon out of the whole series) is extremely disappointing in power even with tse on it. This last patch was supposed to buff the shafting barrels damage but I see no difference in damage. 
---
For the most part, gauss mods can be bought from modus and may be a random drop plan, but the best way would just be to craft and scrap a few. The plans for the gun are expensive from modus but if you really like it, it would be worth it to drop the mats and caps to learn the mods. Overall though, the gun does just fine without the mods as i dont think any of them increase damage.
---
Nope. They have to fix it. Nothing to do. I tried everything. It's simply a bug.
---
I'm ready to be around a more hardcore pvp crowd tbh. I can deal with whatever happens I jus want more than jus seein other ppl, I wanna raid em lol
---
Not really, I enjoy the game as is but Respec currently is not Respec. Grinding away to creep points into different specials isn't a good design.
---
Hell, drop Respec cards or card packs after 50. Something other than the level up change point system. Or charge caps or atom.

Open the map click LB for Xbox idk for all others, but there should be a button to change appearance.
---
You mean like Skyrim?
---
I think it comes and goes on XB. If I crash, it’s a few times in a session or not at all. 
---
Only accept group invites if you know the person or expecting it.
---
The bounty system in groups can be very annoying.
---
It doesn't take long but it's also not adding enjoyment
---
Do what I do. Don’t wear any armor at all :) Garb of Mysteries for life :)
---
With the new anti armor meta it’s hard to find good plans for caps. 
---
I was lucky enough to be there last year for the Fallout 76 event and The Greenbrier is such a phenomenal place with such a fascinating history.   
---
I love how close it is in game to the real world, it's definitely one of my favorite locations in the game.    
---
Also outstanding job with the photos / poses. :D

Mr. Handys look built to flip LPs. 
---
And getting a 5 card pack instantly grants me special powers. Ok.
---
Awww man! Wish I was home to help! Sorry!
---
Same. On PC also. Picked well over 100 flowers in some cases and still at 0/10 or 2/10. Annoying.
---
This video is awesome! do you mind me to post it on non-English forums or communities? I will post a link to you and in the content will mention it's not my work, but a sharing post.

Missing Advanced Power Connectors
---
No NPCs is part of the lore.
---
All of the raiders are gone. All of the humans who weren’t in the bunker died.
---
It will come in time, my children.
---
If you had that, guess where would be nuked constantly
---
I would not want to play on PC. Just grouping with people on console... most of them seemed fine with either duping, using the xp cheat, or doing the carry weight glitch... so I guess there's just a lot of cheaters out there :-|
---
The thought of people being able to add in mods makes me think that the PC experience is bound to be an even more dishonest experience than on console.
---
Thanks, I know some things don't drop mods on scrapping so I didn't want to waste a lot of mats.
---
The atomic shop items... are terrible.  If the goal is to get our money, release good items. 
---
It actually seems like they don’t want more money, they just want to price gouge people who make niche purchases.  For no apparent reason.  
---
It’s truly inexplicable.
---
Silence it, night vision scope. All the riflemans, batteries included, bloody mess &amp; weapon artisan (i think its called).... or maybe take 8,000 caps &amp; ill make you guns forever😃
---
You must have pacifist mode on. If you're wanted, everyone can do full damage to you so turn pacifist off. 
---
Agreed, I have lost interest in my alt, because all the plans aren’t known by him. It’s such a buzz kill to know I have pretty much everything and my alt has to grind the same pointless stuff. 
---
I've learned GeForce Experience overall is kind of a system burden. I used to like it for the instant replay type recording but have since switched to OBS and I think the whole computer has responded positively to its removal (it was absolutely causing issues for me with FO4). 
---
Are you thinking of G-Sync/Freesync in place of V-Sync? IIRC V-Sync isn't proprietary and its been around for ages, its supposed to help with screen tearing when the GPU &amp; monitor get their refresh rates out of whack. 
---
There are quite a few more .ini settings one could try out, among the most classic method of just tweaking the in-game settings until it works a bit better. I've read its very VRAM heavy and I would suspect the 3GB is a limiting factor. 
---
Lol you got me there.
---
Cavalier is very good for melee builds (because they're running a lot) and Sentinel is very good for ranged builds (because they stand still a lot)
---
Just had to close the game. Hope the stuff is still there
---
Stability and INTEGRITY are the two most important things they need to focus on. 
---
Integrity is completely lost when dupers and exploiters run wild.
---
On my way, IGN Malicron
---
Refreshing change from a different YouTuber promoting real world trading for in game items and providing a discount code!
---
I don't see how with the slap damage system that this, or a similar scenario, would be any better. 
---
Player becomes wanted. Player hides defensively. Bounty hunter(s) come(s). Player snipes bounty hunter and does peanuts for damage until the bounty hunter opens fire. There is no point in getting "the drop" on people coming to kill you because they are essentially bullet spunges until they shoot you first.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/72mS8mnzJ6UgSMo0GQIaQy/pre-order-fallout-76-on-pc-and-receive-the-fallout-classic-collection-for
---
Yes, but in a 1 vs 1, I think sentinel has the upper hand, because when yiu hit, you stoo running
---
I was like, “maybe it’s just a colorful local name and there aren’t really an.... RUUUUUUUUUN!!!”
---
I have noticed that the luck perk class freak does not seem to slow down the increased hunger and thirst from the speed demon mutation. My character with 0 points in it has the same drain as the one with 3.
---
That’s what my main does lol, but he is trying be better
---
If you haven’t done ESO, and like that sort of thing, it’ll keep you busy for a long while. 
---
Learning process? It stifles users from wanting to explore the cards. Instead pushing users to grind hours to finally get to a place they realize isn't beneficial.
---
Everyone who specced in energy weapons didn't learn anything other than Bethesda nerfing that entire tree.
---
I know that...
---
Garage sale!!
---
Ok well i have all but fusion. I guess tonights the night lol
---
I'm a fast moving melee build. Can't just stand there if I need to close the gap between my target and I, so cavalier is more useful. Same for pvp against gun users.
---
Well actually he shills a discount code at the start of the video lol
---
Look. I got my opinion and you got yours. I was really happy to see limits on containers in fo76.
---
I used to genuinely get irritated by how unrealistic it was in the older games to have a container with endless items.
---
Cool story that you're rallying to try and get more. I think you guys should stop complaining about challenge mechanics. When mods come out you can play your lame little experiments. But right now its online only with a highly competitive atmosphere.
---
And the players who do not manage their weight are yes... losing compared to the players who battle on playing the game without 2 of every type of gun.
---
You can kill a level 100 with a lvl 25 hunting rifle.
---
Now this is the last i speak to you about this worthless agenda you represent.
---
Lol..I read the title as Whitepower jumpsuit for a fleeting moment
---
If you’re on XB, I’ll hold your stuff while you hop on/off for your alt. 
---
&lt;whisper &gt;Hey, hey buddy... Go over there. Where there’s probably a super mutant around the corner.”&lt;/whisper&gt;
---
Best boy.
---
are there any level 14-18 who can help me get a handmade schematic?
---
I don't think pistols *are* weak. I ran a maxed agility/luck pistol VATS crit build with Gun Fu and it was pretty powerful. 
---
Jesus take the wheel....
---
WoW has a plethora of skins and script that honors the global cool down. Those are not mods.  The mods people want in Fallout 76 change actual game engine code.... Therefore.....it's a Mod....
---
Also, without the whole argument. From the very beginning they told you.... No mods... Somehow the language barrier may be confusing for you but that's ok. Basically it's... NO MODS. I hope you understand what it means when a company says.... NO.
---
Annnnd it's gone. Sorry all
---
3k here if you are onxbox
---
I don't even play for an hour a week anymore, I just get bored as soon as I start repeating events and attempting to interact with players.
---
It's sort of like when you use cheat codes to unlock everything in a game like Saints row.
---
PC. I’ve added enough friends that mulling gear is pretty simple. They don’t even know I’m doing it or am in their game. Join their instance. Add the loot to a random container. Swap chars, join the instance. 
---
If you are on xbox id mod it for you
---
5% off bottle caps is the start of the video, then it goes on to the points I listed above
---
Related - what about the chickens?
---
Oh yeah, rad sponge, good point
---
Thanks for the nostalgia trip!
---
Fair enough. If known stuff was greyed out, it would make plan hunts way more fun. 
---
You are welcome :)
---
Thank you for the replies, im not decided yet about wich one I should look for, I love melee and guns
---
There’s a mod on PC that shows you known plans. That is incredible. 
---
OMG I CRASHED
---
Its a survival game buddy not a GTA. Online car collectors club.
---
Sook
---
I got a twoshot one but my gauss rifle still deals more damage.
---
That is freaking awesome!
---
On my level 25 character I have  a 2 story building with a balcony and a separate smaller building to store my generators that power my 2 industrial water purifiers.
---
If they had a fusion core regeneration system you would want it to select the highest.  Then dump the low ones into the re generator before they are consumed.
---
I'm nearing level 400 and have seen a total of 1 TSE gun. A harpoon gun around level 200. It was also my first explosive gun. The duping fiasco has given many people stupid strong guns they should never see. Saw a level 48 with a TSE gauss rifle and all I could think was how he just entirely skipped any of the challenge of the game. 
---
If I was on PC, I would lol
---
Not anything the likes of you would find familiar.
---
Your posts reflect such.
---
&gt; no fast travel \*no players on map 
---
Yes
---
&gt; \*open loot system, take all from anyone if you can 
---
No
---
I know there not weak but when compared to auto rifles especially with sneak or melee weapons doing 1500-2000 PER SWING on a medium swing weapon it’s pretty weak 
---
It might look ok with the pink fringed dress. 
---
I have one for sale or trade. What do you have for trade? Also have spare nuka and cuckoo clock plans
---
Regardless it would be unable to cleanse their mutations
---
NO turrets they take up a huge amount of budget
---
PC, thanks though
---
Nope. Nuke inbound toward fissure site prime.
---
lol what a comical post, judging people negatively for not wasting more time on Reddit and then acting as if the community of this colossal failure of a game is some highly desirable exclusive club that only the best can be part of 
---
The games community and echochamber seem to be every bit as much of a joke as the game itself 
---
I agree. It's annoying, and I've never been a big fan of it. I usually have pacifist on, logged in tonight after a long day at work. I thought, I'm gonna go make my rounds, sell off the stuff I don't need. As I'm clearing out stuff from my stash, here comes a level 114 and a level 97 who decide that the perfect thing to do is attack a level 26 player. ( I don't get to play as much as most people, two jobs does that to you.) This wouldn't have been a problem if my pacifist mode hadn't mysteriously been turned off... Of course, I died, I don't have the gear or weapons most others do. Thanks Bethesda. You know, if you wanna do pvp, at least make it so that you can't kill someone that's less than ten levels either way of your own level. 
---
Keep up the good work.
---
I share a 2 point rad sponge on my team and have ghoulish.  In lvl 25 PA I only heal in nuke zones.
---
COOL
---
If you are on PC I can mod it out for you if you like.
---
let me know.
---
Who said everything in the game was advertised? Why are you pretending to be stupid?
---
No Shih Tzu's. I got one, she's ugly as fuck. 
---
I open it but it's just black I have to wait a while for everything to load
---
Only the agressive animals are tameable and not all of them but nothing like chicken squirell opossum frog 
---
I'm so willing to spend money on atoms but nothing is worth it. The second I saw the camo paint for the hunting rifle I grabbed it. More actual stuff. I want to spend give you my money. Make good stuff. 
---
I'm all for suspension of disbelief, at this point I would be happy to see Bethesda jump the shark and give users all the fun and enjoyment (with challenge and good quality design).
---
Introduce more vendors like Gram! A mad scientist that bag Respec you if you can find some serious difficulty resources.
---
now i know. Just hoping that other people see this post and not fall victim and lose alot of pure flux thankfully i only had like 3 so that wasnt too hard to recover.
---
Oh for sure. It was a great observation, and I never thought about it, in 4 fallouts! Thanks to you I will now haha. 
---
His damage wasn't getting reduced?
---
This is the simplest solution
---
Nuke touchdown! Join on me if you want to fight the Queen.
---
because if you could kill everyone else, the trolls would just become wanted, and go around one shotting people who didn't want anything to do with PvP.
---
The current system requires some sort of consent. Is it perfect? No, but it was an interesting attempt at least.
---
The only reason I like this system, is because I would hate for a worldwide version of the DZ in The Division. That was a broken shitshow forever.
---
I get multiple blue screens daily, and all of my power armors have targeting huds maybe ill try playing with out them for a bit.
---
Its ok Aminsino your not the first victim to it and most likely won't be the last. Its a very scummy move to take peoples flux.
---
His point is they do full damage on first shot, which is a huge disadvantage.
---
What should we be allowed to loot?jus ain't enough esp. If you dont carry any? I jus want more consequences for dying or fighting. Maybe better loot for no cap reward intead??
---
The bunkers confusing. Theres 4 different terminals that sell different things hopefully that was just the issue. I still get lost running around in there. 
---
I'd like to trade or buy the coat off of you if possible, I'm on Xb1
---
The Quartering is just like Rags, CPG, LegacyKilla etc. Their channels thrive on public outrage in the game industry. Never take what they say to heart or without a grain of salt. 
---
Also let's not forget that Quartering was banned from MtG for harassing a female player. 
---
Wanna trade? I’ve got full sentinel, I’m looking for cavaliers
---
On PC all your photo mode photos get saved in the my documents folder for fallout 76 even if you delete it from your gallery. 50 is only the cap for your load screens. 
---
Earlier i was farming the level 10 grafton monster near charleston trainyard and i saw chally moo moo running around getting chased by it but no Grahm oddly
---
Thank you for this you’re doing great work 
---
I can't think of it off the top of my head but a town toward the right of the map where a robot makes you go pick some flowers and there's like a workshop on a roof, if you know the town I'm talking about go there and check out the church of the town and I found a sack head on one of the pews 
---
I was doing this for ages and found most people never bothered to come get their stuff. 
---
I'd leave spare chems and any random leggos I didn't need. 
---
That is exactly how GTA Online works.
---
And after more thought, maybe the Painkeep mod. Told you I was an older gamer. I remember when qtest came out......
---
Interesting, I'll take your word for it. But man it would be great to see a picture of it just to be 100% sure. :D
---
If u believed the rumors then ur an idiot
---
i'm on the rooftop now i don't see any. Is there any specific location?
---
"but they're on SALE" -bethesda's favorite customer.
---
Man, I'd love to see a nice XCOM-style Tactics update with robust multiplayer, mission editors, and mod support. I'd play that shit for ages.
---
I tested it by just removing my helm and going for SBQ, but I just happened to pop in a server with SBQ lol. I've also heard of a bug that shares targeting HUD to teammates oddly
---
This game is 100% what I expect Borderlands 3 to be. And I love the style of play. Other than crafting 76 is very similar to Borderlands 2 as far as gear and loot. 
---
Right, it shouldn’t be assumed what it is until it is seen in action or confirmed by the creators
---
Most Bethesda games, they tend to load you in and give you control before loading is fully complete. You have to do the MS Windows thing and let it sit and settle down and actually finish loading. Otherwise you get blue screens, crashes, weird shit happens, and so on. I remember playing Fallout 3 and having it crash if I started moving too quickly after loading a save.
---
It's the same thing as warframe where you just want to see the end of the storyline and get the shiny trinkets to show off to other players, but unlike Warframe the story isn't interesting or mysterious enough and the loot is too sparse, annoying, and unbalanced, there's only a handful of actually good weapons and armor drops, the rest being filler junk, like oh wow a legendary assassins security baton.
---
And not just that targeted harassment of other mtg players as well 
---
I will be on tomorrow morning around 7am. Gt same as my name here. If that rime doesnt work, i will be on this weekend. Looking for 2h melee or handmade plans. If not, 1.5k on the coat?
---
Yeah it sucks that those who went energy weapons ended up screwed out of points and I hope they fix them soon. 
---
That said it really feels like you just want the game handed to you, in the same fashion that people can't handle the stash limit. If you want to explore perks that you don't have there are tons of online resources to do so. Honestly the first 50 levels should be quick enough for some one who knows the game already, why not start fresh??
---
 All I'm saying is this game is a little shy on end game content right now, so having that is at least something to do. I just play to have fun and have tons of levels sitting waiting for me to change my play style. 
---
No idea. He was just firing explosives into the spawn location and taking people out.
---
 It seems to have been fixed to me. I can't tell if it was in a patch or not, but some people told me that using that transparent-pip boy caused it, and to fix it all you had to do was change back to the regular pip-boy screen.
---
However, it happened to me even while i had the regular screen on. After a while and some updates it just... stopped, really. My game's normal (except for the part that i can't connect to SA servers and still lag) now.  
---
 I would say maybe try to re-install, since i've done that to re-organize my Ps4 and i noticed that after that the voices were normal. Tho i do remember that i've once re-installed and still had it. 
---
It’s really dumb especially since this game is actually in a good position to use higher operating costs as a balancing factor.
---
I actually think heavy weapons need a durability buff as well. Some of them are ridiculous, like the missile launcher.
---
TheQuartering is an asshat  that got played by people with info about something and ran with the speculation even when refuted by EBGames Australia and in the aftermath of it has taken to calling himself a gaming journalist.
---
Makes a person want to give him more fake anonymous tips to see just how stupid and gullible he is.
---
I rp as Arthur Morgan from Red Dead Redemption 2. I made my character look as close as I can and people have told me he looks pretty spot on. I wear the Black Cowboy Hat, and the western duster. For weapons I mostly use the lever action rifle. 
---
Ah, undernet #quake
---
I had a feeling it was going to be a convoluted process. Considering the hassle and the still insanely low odds, I think I'm going to force myself not to bother trying. Guess I'll stick to dailies and events (if the game will ever let me; it's been refusing to give me any in the Mire for the past week).
---
pretty sure bethesda already said this is on their list of things to do, yet we still get 50 of these posts per week
---
Ugh. I guess I can hope someday, on console. 
---
I personally NEVER have crashes before and after the patch
---
Nothing outside of SBQ needs a legendary weapon to kill assuming you have the right builds, and that reflects an issue with the SBQ really. And if you’re being attacked by 4 people then you probably SHOULD lose the fight. 
---
Lol he looks like the type of guy who would harass a woman for playing HIS card game
---
GREAT. THANKS~~
---
This is bullshit dont fukn nerf my tse builds i dont do pvp n its hard enough taking out scortched bq coz not meany ppl play this game anymore  just fix th game. some times more often then not my tse dont do any damage anyway coz of that dumb fukn glitch fix th game 1st aka duplicate glitches ect!!!!!!
---
I'm over 200 hours in, only about 123lvl. I don't need the game handed to me at all.
---
I just want something more than mindlessly grinding levels just to Respec.
---
You’re welcome: https://m.imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl
---
Pacifist mode would mean he does no damage.
---
Interesting, well thanks for letting me know how he was doing it now i should be able to keep an eye out for that griefing tactic.
---
Oh my fucking thank you ❤️
---
Ok sure I'm down for that, but a flat out freebie is to much. This game gets easy after the first week of play. that's last thing it needs, is to be made easier.
---
Damage done to players that aren't hitting back, you can kill them it just takes a while
---
I've known about this stuff. I've rarely ever been to a camp when the player isn't there though. I've been hunting down player's camps to look around and see all the different things people build. I don't have a decon Arch and I'm not sure I really want to with how expensive it would be to repair if someone broke it
---
It did back in F4 but I’ve seen a lot of posts which seem to imply there’s a cap. From my own testing, I’d agree. 
---
Didn't they eventually fix that? What was the fix?
---
Yeah this weekend works, Because idk if I'll be awake at 7, Yeah 1500 sounds good, And I'll look if i have any of those plans
---
You can attack anyone else that is wanted, or your assigned target if you turn on the hunted/hunter channel, or you can go try to capture workshops since their current owners have opted into PvP, or go to Morgantown and do the Monster Mash...
---
Absolutely, yes. But I've been thinking about a different solution to this problem. I'll finish writing it up then post it.
---
Such a mess, much shame...
---
Although in most multiplayer games im like how i am in real life, very introverted. I have so much fun after getting the hang of the game. Ive only played f04 and maybe 2 hrs of fnv but this is my favorite one yet
---
I'm at 125 with 400+ hours,  so you don't need to grind to make this game fun.
---
The end result when -
---
Your wife asks, "Does my ass look fat in this dress?"
---
You answer "Yes"
---
Try lowering texture quality. I've found that if I go above Medium on my GTX 970, the game starts throwing a fit. Seems like Fallout 76 is the first game I've played where the infamous "3.5" GB of VRAM actually matters.
---
fair enough, yeah feel for the people who paid top dollar for it just to get salt in the wounds when the price dropped
---
I agree.  If they do split PvE and PvP servers, then you will never find me on PvP.  I've never viewed the Fallout universe as a PvP game.  If I wanted that, I would play any number of better PvP games.  
---
I come for the quests, the exploration, and, once done that, building a nice retreat for my character and graduating from the  adventure class to the merchant class (i.e. savaging and selling stuff)....
---
In the mean time, I'm hoping that Bethesda is working on content with a new storyline with live NPCs, DLCs, and perhaps a dedicated community map where you can build a permanent settlement.  Perhaps, you have to buy land to settle on...    Some of this may be pie-in-the-sky stuff but it's necessary, in my opinion, if they want to keep it online for several years.
---
If they don't move in these directions, then I'm likely to jump ship to The Outer Worlds....  I'll probably end up playing it anyways, but if there is nothing new to come back to at that point, then why bother...
---
There wasnt one in particular. They kept tweaking shit around all the problems, but by the time it was worth it, everyone was gone.
---
/^this. I’m amazed at how many people don’t know about this.
---
i'm here now and i don't see any :(
---
Thank *you*. I got a prime Enclave plasma gun plan; I've been looking for one for ages!
---
Slap damage is basically the damage amount of you slapping someone 
---
Easy counterplay hehe
---
I almost never get disconnected on xbox before and after the patch idk if I'm lucky or what
---
When you said
---
&gt; and other things that add bonuses
---
I assumed that you meant bobbleheads.
---
i got a stalkers explosive.  iz gud.  
---
Or the volcano lava flows in South Park. RIP Kenny.
---
I love your ideas...
---
We need...
---
Prison fences. Decorative boulders, Death claw Skinned rug! Taxidermy Animals, (these already exist in the antique shop near watooga.) Our own deployable Protectron, or sentry bot at our camp. Escalator. Spiral staircase, Wooden Stairs, Increase Camp Budget and Increase Camp Size. 
---
Fuck me 
---
Yes 
---
That's awesome, the attention to detail is tremendous, thanks for sharing. :D
---
How? Only iron fist applies to boost the weapons damage, how could it catch up to the power of the sledge 
---
Please post farming locations of other materials you've found!
---
Mine sure can xD
---
Instigating 
---
40% power att damage
---
Somethingsomething
---
Busts pretty much anything in one punch
---
While you go on helping to ensure that gaming never improves. Enjoy ten more years of cooy/paste gameplay. 
---
What did the five fingers say to the face? SLAP!
---
Thanks folks :) I just imagined a player going about slapping other players in the map for shits n' giggles ..... but you learn something new each day.
---
Appreciated :)
---
Fist weapons have higher base damage
---
I'm level 58 and I've only ever seen him once. I was at a train station selling, and I heard him shouting about "selling being better than shooting" or something, and yes, I did rush out like a kid hearing an ice cream truck to see what it was.
---
Haven't ever run into him since. :(
---
Talons and bloodied 
---
Im fine, UK
---
I still wear armor when wearing power armor i usually use my pa outside of blast zones since at least to me my excavator armor the one you craft during miner miracles doesnt have the greatest rad resist so i use a hazmat suit when im gathering flux. I may be wrong about the excavator and id appreciate if anyone can deny or confirm what i thought.
---
I cant find metal plans anywhere tho I'm stuck with brick, any suggestions??
---
Well I have a bloodied power fist, unyielding and adrenal mutation attached to damage and at base level it can do 1600 damage, bumping it up to 2200 and higher.
---
Oh good. More min/maxing.
---
I miss mods. They let me tweak the game so I could build a character, not a spreadsheet with a face.
---
Wow it sounds so close though, cool thanks for the info.
---
And this is from a guy who wants to start a game website because of the current state game journalism these days.
---
He was still trying to save face in this video and promoting so called reporting from gamers around the world.
---
He's as bad as the rest of them.
---
Probably still lurking here to report on us attacking him again.
---
Nice ones!
---
Anything over 1000 is a RIP off. Got mine for 500. Go to the xbox game up and ask. Way easier and cheaper 
---
trust me, im in the same boat as a heavy weapons character that dabbles in heavy energy weapons as well. 
---
I spend 20 minutes grinding for bullets every startup. Its not that big a deal and im well over 5k now, but im getting close on acid and its becoming worrysome. 
---
He does that?
---
imagine if they didn't try to write off all the non feral ghouls like they did also.
---
You dont have to buy the game 7 times to be banned that many times. You just have to buy it once and make new accounts 
---
gonna need like 3-400 acid a run, i do not server hop. ill check this place out, but last time, it wasnt even enough to smelt my lead out. 
---
This dropped for me earlier today in Whitesprings off of a 3 star bloated ghoul. 
---
[https://imgur.com/a/WBtqg1c](https://imgur.com/a/WBtqg1c)
---
Yeah that’s what I worry about, that arch took me a while to make but it hasn’t broken(Yet) so fingers crossed 
---
I just tried and it worked but it did take longer than usual.
---
Holy shit
---
Talons too. Don’t forget the punctured mod that ignores a percentage of armour. Highly recommend.

Another post also mentioned that if you bulk steel, the scrap system will ignore the bulk steel in favor of scrapping one of your mods.  Also, I guess you don't save much weight in bulking steel anyway other than making it easier to sell.  Moral of the story, be careful what you bulk at least until this bug has been fixed.  Keep all of your steel as scraps...
---
Or non-hostile bots, would be nice.
---
He did do a video about a thread here attacking youtubers including him and yongyea.
---
Ah I know the one you’re talking about
---
You deal reduced damage.
---
Lol Charleston Fire department for lead!

They could easily add new perks and more ranks to some.  
---
If one character can eventually have 'everything' then there is little use in creating another character.
---
Thanks, sure I don't mind at all. :)
---
Almost agree with all of them but anyone is a victim in the wastes..high and low levels your junks all the same..
---
Agreed, the game is easy day one. However Respec isn't going to make the game any easier than it already is, changing the way uses take damage, more enemies, adding challenge makes for fun. Changing some cards around doesn't break the game at all, if anything the special/cards mechanic itself is inherently broken and don't add anything to the game other than making minor choices. We're all funneled into similar builds already, allowing change opens up a possibility for creativity.

Im enjoying my chrome minigun

Apparently he cares about our opinion here.

Any plans for 2 handers melee weapons?
---
I don't lock any of my doors, and leave most of my water unlocked, but I don't have anything particularly expensive to repair either 
---
They still have to damage him once before he can do damage. The problem is they do full damage with the first shot, and if it only takes one, he doesn't have a chance.

Shotgun is in a better spot currently but that could all change if they fix some of the dang issues with heavy weapons. I love flamers and Gatling lasers but my lord to they need some love.

This one would probably take a couple of hours due to servers not responding but otherwise the mothman egg method works like a charm. I went to Point Pleasant, cleared some of the scorched, headed to the mothman statue, and harvested all the eggs I could. Then head to the western part of town by the river and there'll be more to harvest. This is where you can keep switching servers and keep harvesting. They sell for 2 caps per egg and in just two tries I had 52 eggs. It won't be as quickly as bounties in bulk but if you have all the towns discovered, just go back and forth, switch servers harvesting and selling when you can. It'd be about 22-24 caps per fast travel but 100-200 caps per vendor depending on their max and if nobody empties them out prior.
---
That style is even earlier than 70s-80s
---
This game needs more unique bosses, if you nude fisher prime you get a scortch beast queen, if you nude deathclaw island you should get a Boss mega Death claw, Pick areas of the map and give each one a unique boss, a Huge Grafton monster if you nude grafton. Pick a spot in the ash heap and make it spawn a Radscorpion boss, and mega sloth at point pleasant, Call him the mega yeti or boss hermit crab At the red rocket mega stop. and a snallygaster At Charleston. A Massive Blood Bug at Camden Park. Give us other boss monsters and incentives to Nuke other places.
---
Also if you’re at an event you can’t do damage to another player. 
---
Why the fuck would you ever go to west virginia? I wanted to go to boston after fo4 but I could never drag myself to go to West Virginia.
---
Agreed that's why I'm still playing, exploring is fun. But there's no creativity, no need to try new things, and there's no end in sight.
---
I do this with my TSE Gatling, but your way sounds even more satisfying.
---
YES. I am in the same boat. I currently have Strong Back at rank 3. I'd like it instead to be at rank 2. I just earned a few levels, and took two Strong Back cards (again) and an Explosive Ordnance card (the reason why I'd like to "rank-down" SB). Well, I come to find out that it appears my only option is to rank up Strong Back to rank 4, and not the two new cards of SB I just got to rank 2, as I want. I'm going to wait for my next level, grab yet another Strong Back card, then rank up to 4 and see if at that point I can rank up the two remaining SB cards to rank 2. So, in the end I'd have a rank 4 (not wanted) and a rank 2 Strong Back set. Stupid. But I'm hoping at least it works this way!
---
Also why is a hand-crank gatling gun superior to a modern day minigun? I’m sick of using this antiquated weapon over anything else. 
---
You’ll realise that you might not even need unarmed Perk card and throw your points into something else. In terms of damage you will be taken care of. The unyielding build takes a bit of getting used to, I’m still adjusting. You will die a bit; just make sure if you are going on junk runs you deposit it when you’re full. Last thing you need is someone picking up all the things you acquired.
---
"Xbox game up" Wym? And oh wow, Yeah that's much cheaper
---
Any card that has only one star (travel agent, scrapper, chemist, hacking/lock picking) I’d like to see as set as passive/always active peeks

It's scary how fine of a line it is between saving someones life, and devouring their still beating heart.

This post isnt relevant anymore what so ever. This was more of a rally method to stop duping from being as common as it was for a while not quite so much about how good the money making method was

As much as that isn't a thing, it really needs to be a thing.

Hahaha, you call fannying around with inventory a "challenge" and makes it "competitive", but think MY "agenda" is worthless?  It's a shame you aren't going to speak about it any more because that shit is downright hilarious.

I totally agree.
---
Stop watching his channel. You are giving him views. Is your goal to draw attention to him?

Watch the ones without the obvious troll titles. There are a lot of other, actually fun and useful channels that start popping up as suggestions once you avoid the click hate for a few days. 
---
Prickets fort wood 150-300 per run.
---
Probably not the same people, though...
---
U got to do what you got to do. But the higher levels usually horde more stash, have more caps on kills and are more willing to seek revenge. While the lower levels just easily give up wasting your time and effort. Keep in mind, they most likely die alot, so chances of them holding alot of junk is pretty low.
---
To maximise profit, they are better left alone.

He didn’t claim Bethesda told him it was going free to play. He conjectured that it was going free to play based on circumstantial evidence. Bethesda never told him they were going free to play.
---
Thank you fellow raider, it takes a raider to appreciate these methods lol.
---
I like Yongyea but I hate when youtubers just scroll through Reddit posts and call that reporting. 
---
Equipment/combat mechanics and factions are better in NV. F3/4 follow the standard Beth gameplay philosophy of "just increase the numbers" for enemies and gear same as in TES games.
---
No sorry. There were some pretty basic plans but nothing like that. Then I had to exit the game and it all went bye bye
---
I could have missed an obvious search query, but I used "pacifist mode vats" and the most recent post was 21 days ago, with a couple a month or more prior.    
---
Bethesda has indeed responded on one of those posts and said they'd pass it along.  Even if it's already been posted on before, it's such a bad a thing that people occasionally re-post something they'd like changed.  It lets Bethesda know we're still interested in seeing it happen.  
---
Anyway, you're exaggerating more than a bit about how often you see this particular post.  Didn't mean to rustle your jimmies, man, I just wanna to see this game be as good as it can be.
---
Country roads took him home? 
---
At 0:52 of the video he says he bought it 7 times. Hes on Windows. I'm speculating that on console with a disc, then get banned,  you would need to buy a new playstation plus or xbox live to even get past the main screen. 
---
Maybe you're not a build that can make use of VATS properly then, like in past games it's highly dependent on range. Yes it can be finnicky if the enemy is running behind objects but you just need to learn to use it properly. In the current meta a VATS build can be quite deadly 
---
It is super clear. Two shot is getting nerfed. Explosive is getting nerfed. They are both being nerfed.  
---
If you have TSE, it will do less damage.  
---
If you have explosive without TS, it will do less damage.

If you have TS without explosive, it will do less damage.

I’ve used a Furious plasma flamer and a Furious deathclaw gauntlet and I’d agree. It does increase but caps relatively low. Highest boost I recall seeing was 263 to 310 with the gauntlet. 
---
Look at it like this. Tons of people are about to be super pissed they spec'd out the way they did with the incoming Nerf. So should they all get a free pass to swap to a one shot insta kill melee build like I'm sure most will? To me that seems easy.
---
I'm a rifle player always have been always will be my ts radium rifle is about to go in the toilet for damage, meanwhile one of my new friends gets to fly through the ranks because he chose two handed melee. Where's my free swap?
---
I don't have a decom arch yet.   Not sure that I need one with the amount of radaway that I find.  But I leave my camp unlocked with access to the workstations, except for my bedroom, which has my fusion generator off of it.  
---
In fact, I'm starting to think that I may as well create an open outdoor porch or a garage for the crafting stations.  No sense in locking them up when they are easy to rebuild.  
---
Of course, it all depends on where you build your camp and what spawns nearby.  Mine just gets a couple of those tiny red star robots, or a couple of mole rats, or a single low lever scortched.  Nothing that the basic turrets can't handle.  My walls have some minor damage, but very little for the amount of time that my camp has been in the same spot.

The Quartering does this for a living, spreading rumour and fake outrage.

You know the PS4 saves all photos and screenshots in its own memory? Even after you delete from the gallery in f76 it is still on your PS4 under storage.

Holy shit, indeed... That thing sounds like a beast.

Well remeber raider life has different paths you are about the coin..I’m about the blood and fun but I get ya and will be incorporating some of this stuff as well..

Hrmmm 78% upvoted... that's fun

I can’t tell if you’re technically diligent (a good thing) or a critical asshole (a bad thing), but of all people that may have possibly earned a right to be trusted and taken seriously about Fallout lore, Oxhorn stands alone.
---
This reply is more for others reading who aren’t aware, rather than you. You’ve clearly made up your mind either way.
---
He’s doing similar shit with the upcoming Anthem release. Telling people not to buy the game based purely on speculation and talking about the demo as if it’s some insider thing made for reviewers to dupe people. The demo is open to preorder customers on Friday and open to the public next week. 
---
It's a fox.  It will at most nibble your ankles.  One good step in PA and goodbye.  
---
I dunno how well it sold but it's already on sale for $20 CAD here in Canada at Costco.
---
For reference, Star Wars Battlefront II also went on sale cheap at Costco like that - and not as fast or as deep a sale. And Battlefront II lost EA a *lot* of money. Having said that, it certainly did have higher production costs than the phoned-in FO76 did.
---
I use a instigating meat hook with 40% swing speed and wreck.. 
---
It seems pretty minor. I barely ever notice anything, though I mostly use my stabilized heavy guns.
---
Went last summer. Recommended in the summer. Hoping to hike Acadia in the winter next.
---
That’s kinda lame of him. Even if it is EA you should play the game and see for yourself instead of using unconfirmed information
---
Your legs are numb.
---
Tried it. Wrong color, wrong style.

I've always been melee, God is good.

Go try it. I just did.

Need to have your perk cards on.

Either way, it’s all good. Support what you want to see more of.
---
there's a 5% chance to miss though
---
It was off. When wanted, anyone can come kill you 1 hit you or even box you in a camp and you cant do shit. without getting a higher wanted level.
---
apparently the flower one is buged according to some people, but they both require you to pick/kill 10 od a certain type.(except assultrons. just one of those) clicking on weekly then on the quest will tell you which.
---
If you insist, thanks for the feedback
---
That is exactly what I do with my workstations, I’ve effectively created a mini camp at the front door of my base for wandering players with a small 2nd garden next to it. My main garden and bedroom  is enclosed around concrete walls and requires access through a second garage door. 
---
&gt;It was posted yesterday and he posted a video with the title being Bethesda Spoke to me on Fallout76 Going Free to Play. Of course this is either him being dishonest for the sake of hating on FO76, getting his video to 10 minutes and over for ads, or even both. He claims Bethesda told him it was going free to play but BETHESDA THEMSELVES SAID IT WOULDNT.
---
I just watched the video, where does he say that Bethesda told him it was going free to play?
---
Happens all the time
---
My guess is that any perks to reduce materials needed is percent based and not shown in full on the repair screen. Such as if the reduction lowers parts needed to 10.4 from 15, it shows as 10, having rounded down the number, but in actuallityit requires 11 because 10.4 is still more than 10 (and we dont have fractions of materials). Though I could be wrong
---
i read this reply with a badass tone in my head. Well said and true. I aim for the loot and coin. The kills are only part of the process. I could imagine pure hunting could bring up so many other methods. Like using the environments for killing or loring enemies to victims.
---
I cant see if anyone else is wanted if Im wanted (I believe, I havent gone looking while wanted) but I cant do anything when Im wanted. No one does hunted hunter, and i'd say maybe 2% of people actually pvp for their settlements. The only pvp that I see 100% is when Im wanted, people fast travel all over this dick and 1 hit me while I can just sit there and take it.
---
On xbox you just have to buy 1 copy ( digital or disc) and you only need 1 xbox live account. They dont ip bans
---
Do you have the perk cards on?
---
Sometime if you have the exact number of some mats it wont let you craft it. try relogging.
---
Sometimes there is an issue if you have the required mats split between your inventory and your stash. put it all in one. try relogging if it still doesnt work.
---
When used with the flamethrower modifications, do they count as flame damage for the Friendly Fire Perk?
---
It's really fun if you do it right though.

Man, that gave me a laugh. It reminds me of the mid 2000s non-smart phones that only had a *total* 50 text message limit. 
---
Crazy, I’ve had 250+ hours and never had this issue, it’s odd my explosive weapons couldn’t register a hit on it 
---
Melee &lt;3
---
Do you know by chance if the flame mod counts for use of the Friendly Fire Perk?
---
Do mines trigger wanted level?
---
lol why are you so salty that your game isn't as good as you think. stop being a sheep. 
---
id buy a 1000 point ghillie suit...
---
Happens way to much
---
Agreed, BGS needs to just accept they were wrong with their original 'no npcs' design philosophy. Doesn't mean the game should be packed with them but a few here and there, especially if they're part of a quest, would be fine.
---
This.  I’m getting close to 400 per swing with all rise.  Sooner or later I’ll get a 3 star melee and I’ll be ecstatic.
---
Twisted muscles reduces accuracy a lot. I use vats with excellent accuracy until it flips me around at the wrong target. Quit talking about stuff you don't understand enough to use. 
---
Hope Grahm could sell more rare items and has his own bottle caps pool
---
People have easily reached 4K w/ powerfist 
---
Which one did you go to?  The Production Vendor?  The Serums Vendor?  The Medic Vendor?  Or the restricted Military Vendor?
---
Agreed, PvP in this game is broken especially if you have an explosive weapon or instigating. I have an instigating sledge and if I can somehow get close enough, 1 shot you're dead. Lame.
---
Well but of course I currently run a lovely little trap house that does all the work for me..i simply just whisper those sweet sweet nothings they want to hear and pied pipper their sheepish arses on in..then I get a new toy..money..and eventually food or date I’m not into the fresh dead..giggles
---
Do you have any mutation serums?
---
Yep this was a learning experience
---
I keep my camp unlocked anyways, water and all. Had people walk in and look around use stuff while I was there, just give a wave and go on. I roam enough I pick up enough junk I need lol
---
Like I’m going to make a difference in the world? That’s kind of you to assume.

Petition for Wooby to be the next new NPC

The other spots for lead, from my understanding, are Flatwoods Motel gym and the Vault Tec U gym. I've heard there some good spots for lead it the Palace of the Winding Path and Site Charlie. There's also a decent sized gym in the upper floors of the Hornwight estate building (across from the building you get the excavator power armor)  but you'll need the keycard to activate the elevator.
---
The military wing one, someone said that power armor mods don’t spawn at that one so could be it 
---
See what I mean though I would love to blast all points to melee now that the only good gun I earned on my own is going to be useless. So instead I hop on and go look for a new gun and in the time it takes to find one I'll have the levels I need dump on what ever gun I get. 
---
I feel like the real culprit is some of the perks are definitely in the wrong categories.
---
In addition to the Grafton vendor bots, I've also seen it occasionally at the Camden Park vendor. The plans are called "Lever Gun" for some reason. I personally got my copy from the Grafton train station vendor a while back.
---
Alright
---
As did I before I posted.  
---
Wait, so you didn’t like the Fo4 because you enjoy the grinding aspect but couldn’t stop yourself from consoling in whatever you wanted?
---
I got raider protective today from the guided mediation event
---
Bloodied explosive.
---
You tha real mvp.
---
Bummer. 
---
Funny, I looked on ebay last night and the vast majority of items sold were on console.
---
Regardless, as I'm sure it changes by the day, people need to do the right thing. The sheer amount of money wasted by 'working the system' is what keeps other people in business. You may try to get ahead, yet someone is always ahead of you. Who is the idiot, really?
---
I used to watch him back when he provided insightful videos but once he saw his views skyrocket because of battlefront 2 and lootboxes he went balls deep on any outrage he can cash in on.
---
Hi, common bug

Store everything you need to repair / craft in your stash

Or withdraw everything you need from your stash

Oh no, I understood you completely, I was mirroring your sentiments. :) Sorry if that response was confusing, I wrote it on my phone while cooking, so I'm sure it's less clear than if I took the time to assemble my thoughts properly on a computer. :)
---
And thank you :) I like the generally positive attitude of this sun a lot!
---
The Military Wing Vendor has a randomized assortment of three X-01 mods every vendor reset/spawn in.  It will depend on your spawn-in and those iof your teammates.  Each of you will see  a different selection, but there will almost always be three mods of some sort in the Mod tab of the vendor screen.  They will only be for X-01 PA though, never any other types.
---
I feel the same way. Makes zero sense. 
---
&gt;	lay off the gutbuster
---
How *dare* you. 
---
This is what I’ve been using for my rifle build. Or bloodied/increased vats crit dmg.
---
I wouldn't ever want to be your victim, that is for sure. I can sense that ur confidence is built on successful experiences. U seem to have some nice tricks up your sleeves. Would you like to share them?
---
Not at the moment, but I can get some! What are you looking for?
---
Yes, and 10 mobs coming for me, this seems like a good time to cover my entire screen with my new 1\* bloodied pipe.
---
From events or missions right? Agreed.
---
I did like the crazy robots. That prize one spooked me in the mire. Promised me a prize and gave me nothing. So, I shot him. His prize to me was 2 steel scrap.
---
That’s weird because like I said I’ve checked the mod tab daily there for a month plus and there so no mods at all. Thanks for the info for sure 
---
...yay
---
NEVER fucking fast travel to your base when wanted.
---
If you're worried about him taking your junk and getting a few caps, consider that a decent outcome.
---
He could have leveled your camp and gotten absolutely 0 wanted level for it... Then kill you aftwerwards
---
Speed demon, healing factor, marsupial you know the works👍
---
It incentives me to not go melee anymore, and try new things. So I really want to see what's the worst build possible and try to add some sort of difficulty. 
---
Energy weapons and lots of nuka cola. My basement dweller build is going to be great! 
---
I'm not giving help currently please try again later
---
found a bloodied sledgehammer last week... with low health you can 1hit bloating ghouls its insane
---
You're like a magic 8 ball...do I have to shake you later when I try again?
---
Lol fair enough. I'll get back to you when I have them in stock!
---
Using glow sights and tenderizer perks are what made the difference for me.  I used to three hit them.  Now it’s a one hit.   
---
Awesome man, I appreciate it. No one seems to have any other type of guide so it’s better than nothing.
---
That's why I could get behind it if it had a high cost and you couldn't just do it Willy nilly.
---
but..... it's not fun....
---
The single rectangular windows on the brick set you can also just jump straight through.
---
Gotta spread the word to others when I can lol
---
I think Explosive probably has more utility since it can wreck limbs and you don't have to be dead-on accurate with it.  It's just more fun to screw around with.
---
Damn that had to be surreal
---
As far as no fast travel, I'd rather see other players not on your team count as an enemy. Join or die. Can't defend your camp if you can't fast travel back. 
---
No players on map you just plain may never see anyone. Perhaps a less exact player location that updates slowly so you can look for people if you want?
---
Idk about gear dropping, but dropping food/drink/chems/junk. But I'd rather see it pick some random items than dropping everything. Would be way too easy to grief people if you killed them took their supplies then killed them again.
---
Have you selected the quest to view which types of flowers you need to pick? There are specific types that you have to pick,  and i think you need to get something like 10 of a type  for it to count as 1/10, then you need to do that for the other 9 types.  Having said that, I haven't bothered trying to pick flowers so maybe it is bugged, IDK. 
---
Trying putting all your Junk in the Stash before repairing.  The game sometimes get confused between the Junk on your person versus the Junk in your Stash.
---
There might be a lot of broken things, but they're being fixed.  Meanwhile you don't get to do this in many other games.
---

Ok thanks man 😁
---
I personally think the lack of NPCs makes it perfect for release but then allows for outside groups to move in after the inoculation means while still a threat the scorched are sorta contained and heavily armed groups can try to invade the area for the silos and ultracite.
---
Give the players factions they can join and advance their agendas.  Claim territory for various factions

yea gloe sights is insanely strong! Havent bothered about this perk for a long time lol

Pretty cool door for a pretty low price. Always love Atomic Shop items that are brand new. Hopefully we get some clean walls in the future to go with all of these "modern" looking items.
---
I do wonder what's the process between deciding **"Limited Time!"** vs regular permanent items. 
---
Anyways, first new post on the new account, **and** 132 followers before I even posted anything on it. 😩👌 See you guys in the next update. 
---
I didn't have a problem with the robots and managed to get that one just fine.  I've been picking flowers as I come across them, but I haven't looked at my progress on that.
---
Oh really? Well, that's good to know...
---
But either way, I like it when they display on the loading pages and don't like it when I'm told I can't take any more images when I find something I really want to capture.

Ah. I see what you mean; and I think you’re specifically taking about players willfully engaged in PvP, not players being griefed. You’re totally right—and if you’re engaged in PvP, disconnecting isn’t really any different from any other kind of cheating.

you still holding him ?

That's a very good point. I never considered that, it was kind of a panic move.

This is amazing. Thank you!

It's fun for me. People enjoy things you don't like. Get use to it.

no idea what it’s called, something along the lines of “couches” i guess? i got it from a quest cause i know i never bought couch plans and i have a few couch types unlocked including that one

Funny story about this skeleton sitting outside the Mothman Museum. I live in Gallipolis just across the river from Point Pleasant and know the people who work there. There is an employee who works there who is a massive chain smoker and always sits on this bench. So when the developers visited they decided to immortalize him in the game.

Wow, I didn't even think of that.  I haven't used that perk but yeah, it'd be practically useless in a lot of scenarios with other players and friendly bots.

Cmon, that can't be right. They would ban the xbox live account associated with your gamertag. 
---
I would love to see a moonshine still to make booze also think it would be great to make a marker that other players can see that you can leave a message like items for sale or lookin for items or personally I’d love to role play as a hired gun and have a way for lower levels to be able to find and hire me to follow them around. And give me away to delete a tamed animal so I can get rid of it when it’s attacking team mates.  And most importantly let me tame a chicken so I can have an attack chicken named nuggets.
---
I'm having the same issue but just with the flower one.
---
The robot one I've completed but the flower one does not record even though i've collected the correct type. It still shows as 0 of each type.
---
How many ranks in Tenderizer? And do you run Lone Wanderer?
---
 That is me as well.  I always place two purifiers, one for me one to share.  If people want to be dicks they will be dicks rather I lock the door or not.
---
I think I'll let bethesda do the talking ;)
---
If they can’t replace lost items due to paper bags disappearing etc. I highly doubt they can isolate duped items for removal 
---
This if true would bring me back to the game. But I agree with the others, pics or it didn't happen.
---
I posted looking for information, not vague bullshit.
---
Happens to me nearly every time I log in on Xbox, really frustrating to have to reload the game every time.
---
Yes the xbox live account gets banned correct. But you can play games on other accounts. Im not going to get into it but you only have to pay once
---
*Duper’s* items are being deleted. Any accounts with stupidly unrealistic and unreasonable quantity of rare items are being suspended and having items wiped from their accounts. 
---
Individual items are not being wiped. 
---
Little late to the party, but White Sulphur is my home town. Worked at the Greenbrier all through my teen's. AMA lol.
---
Do you have a link?
---
I have 5 big purifiers locked and like 12 little ones unlocked hahaha 
---
I am glad I stuck it out until I got past lvl 50... it’s a real culture shock coming directly from fo4, and there are so many things that are vastly different that it’s easy to get hung up on that. But honestly once I got past the learning curve and really just took it as a unique experience it really is very enjoyable.
---
I still pop into fo4 for an hour or two every now and then, and it actually makes me appreciate both games more. If there is a single thing that I would love to see someday is console mods. Modders just really bring some amazing creativity that completely revitalizes the game. But I know logistical considerations make it kind of tricky to work in to multiplayer environment.
---
It's all good! I think I think I didn't place your first sentence into the context of the conversation correctly. Everything was very well written, especially for being done on a phone :)
---
Hope your meal is good!
---
Yes please! That's a good door
---
You should already have it if you played Fallout 76 last year.  Get the Bethesda Launcher on PC.  On the left sidebar, above all the icons, you'll see a "&gt;&gt;" button.  The Fallout goodies are in there.  It's not the most obvious thing to click on, I know.
---
Well it sounds like an xbox live membership applies to the entire xbox and not just individual accounts is what I surmise. No bother. If that's how it is then that's how it is.
---
Well fast traveling needs to be addressed as ppl can wreck your camp n fast travel away. Other games like this dont play out like that at all, you gotta be there to defend type thing and camp structures should be more durable to counter camp griefing. I shouldn't be able to tear walls down with a board or pipe wrench, there alot of adjustments I'm seeing that we need now. Atleast we cant get offline raided in fo76 lol. 
---
One person's trash is another person's must have.
---
I love the mid century modern chandelier. Have it hanging in my camp already. Also bought the swing arm floor lamp and the new hat. They all go well with the modern fireplace, succulents, string lights, Christmas lights, snowman, painted faux Scandanavian front door AND the craftsman door.
---
Now I just need hanging plants, clean curtains, nice floor rugs, barn windows that aren't broken, clutter, clutter and more clutter.
---
Biggest problem with the Atoms shop is there isn't a big enough selection already, so people get frustrated.
---
Probably want to delete that so people dont make dummy accounts to dupe on
---
I have seen alot of posts about gear disappearing.
---
Probably just hearsay though
---
The hot dog eating contest at Camden Park also has belching so intense it staggers the player.
---
Some of the king rats on youtube known for teaching people how to glitch/scam are putting out warnings after mass bannings. Not really in the mood to link their channels for obvious reasons.
---
Thank you! Putting everything in my stash worked! It's nice to finally have a solution to this issue. It's been driving me nuts. 
---
Explosive but more vats related.
---
Sadly my vats/rifle alt is being shelved for a vats/auto rifle /sneak build.
---
My main is melee and i got so bored with it
---
Could you link the facebook thing please?
---
Seems like most ppl don't like it, get used to that
---
Mine was bugged on the complete daily challenge one, the challenge? Complete daily challenge 0/1 it was the only daily challenge I didn't complete yesterday. Kinda just got into farming atoms and it sucks that I missed those ten. 
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **7th Cakeday** Ishouldnt_be_on_here! ^(hug)
---
Need answer for this, I gave up on my friendly fire build because of the cost of flamer fuel.
---
I bought it in the hopes that I will eventually have something appropriate to wear with it. 
---
[Still rocking my tuxedo and clean space helmet for a Daft Punk look](https://www.mytuxedocatalog.com/wp-content/uploads/Daft-Punk-Large.jpg).
---
 Always suppressor.
---
With the nerfs and buffs to certain enemies I am so excited for anthem. I am level 302 on fallout 76 and they need to be focused on the real problems instead of balancing for pvp which a lot of players including me are not interested in. 
---
To play both sides of the fence, how else is Bethesda going to make money on this game? It's not selling well and population is going down. They need more players and more money to make more content and keep the game running well. New players aren't going to try the game with their money with all the bad press out there and unstable servers.  But new features and fixes require money. 
---
Yes please!
---
I don't know why you'd bother locking your camp doors, not like people can steal anything. 
---
Plus, if people *really* want in they'll break a wall. 
---
NEED.
---
Everyone loves him because there's one.
---
Same on Xbox we gonna miss on 30 atoms this week
---
That was a nice brick to read on my way home) but yeah, I do basically that. Camp building and helping bypassing explorers are definitely my favorite things to do. I love getting a heart emoji from a player after picking up the paper bag I drop them) lol I gave this level 67 at least 8+ legendary armour/weapons and stimpacks. He/she was so happy, and so was I, I got to lose all that dead weight haha. I didn't fast travel last night for my first 3 vendors and had a blast. I instantly met Graham maybe 20 feet after I started my jogg from Watoga station to R&amp;G. Then I came across a herd of lvl 32 wendingos (that was awesome) at least 5 of them just jumped me while cruising to Lewisburg from R&amp;G. Then I came across those two dead Travelling merchants that I hadn't noticed before. I'm definitely going to keep running around from Vendor to Vendor. Maybe not low level areas (don't wanna spawn high level ads for low levels near the vault lol). But yeah man, everything feels more like a chore instead of work/reward factor. They need to give us more to play with as far as puzzles, mysteries that we slowly uncovered as a community and stuff. The first thing I tried to do was find that Yellow Broken plane we see in the loading menu screen. Unfortunately, we can't find parts and fix/fly it around. Things like that would be tight. Repairing some of the mono-rails/train stations so they can actually function. Basically rebuilding Appalachia as promised. All we do is nuke and destroy (as humans do naturally) but I thought the point of our existence was to "Make Appalachia Great Again". Doesn't feel like we're doing anything at all.. 
---
 That may not be the holy grail, but it is a pretty nice gun.  Would love one.
---
 I like you.
---
Geez sold the quad lever for less then 50 caps to a vendor a nice one too :/
---
Yeah cause at my lvl I have over 100 picks most times so once you get a stash of them it is simple
---
 You are a good a good person.
---
Darn, been looking for a really good Lever legendary since its just so good at maximizing the damage of .45. 
---
In fine with that. Don't push to have a feature removed because you don't like it. 
---
Regardless of whether it's true, saying anything like that is asking for an argument here as you've already seen, and just after posting that I realized I'm not actually in the mood to get my inbox spammed today
---
Martial artist and incisor also help.
---
I find it equally amazing that 60,000 people wanted to cheat their way to victory in a game where victory means... what, exactly?
---
The heavy guns that need rebalancing are all of them except the 50 cal machine gun and Gatling gun. The .308 long burns through an uncommon ammo that’s hard to craft, and does little damage. The mini gun has pathetic damage while burning through ammo. Flamer and cryolator ammo is very rare and expensive to craft. The explosive weapons don’t deal enough damage for their massive weight and expensive ammo. The whole weapon type needs rebalancing.
---
Why not? if most people find it annoying, why not get rid of it?
---
jacobs town 2.0
---
I agree it's a cool idea. If you play on xbox and you like pvp, feel free to check out my Combat Zone Camp in my bio. 
---
I don't need handouts, just enjoy pvp big time!
---
Stop being so fucking lazy (you won't, hence why you have duped shit in the first place) 
---
I'm afraid that the silver shroud outfit will be limited time, so I'm not spending any of my atoms  :P
---
Absolutely nobody is saying that the server and stability issues are ok. The only point out of there that was ever advertised was 16x detail, and I'm pretty sure that's one of the bs ones. It might win on some technicality like the bit wars with those 32/64 bit consoles back in the day, but in reality most of the game looks pretty much like fallout 4 with maybe a couple texture mods when everything works right.
---
If you're on PC I can plop you one down. Just moved camps and don't need multiple
---
I'll be sticking with my two-shot as it's all I've got. 
---
This guy..this guy gets it..
---
I'm solo as well.
---
The occasional group ups.
---
I got wanted and 20 players fairly easy.
---
Just wait your time, server hop to find wanted people.
---
No matter how much they are worth.
---
I'm still missing the magazines and reviving people.
---
Entitlement. If I get 1 hour for each dollar I am pretty happy with a game.  It is not like you can;t take a break and come back when the DLC start coming out.
---
I don't have any duped items. I just don't use Facebook, so I wanted someone else more in the know about the situation. Dumb cunt.
---
Depends if you have an auto reciever or singleshot
---
74%
---
Any rifle with an automatic receiver is an automatic.
---
Wanted to add a bit more to this.
---
Plastic: Morgantown High School gym/cafeteria (look for golfballs, plastic plates, utensils, plastic pumpkins, plus there's a few toys in there if you need screws) + crazy cat lady house that's south east of the high school (several catbowls inside)
---
Steel: Have scrapper perk and try to scrap 10mm pistols, combat rifles/shotguns( +any other type of shotguns), middle launchers and Fort Defiance is a good place to look
---
Ballistic Fiber: Camp McClintock + Fort Defiance + Clancy Manor (should be next to tinker craft station inside)
---
Aluminum: Again, Fort Defiance lol
---
Crystal: Cavern below Tanagra Town has a good amount of crystal nodes( plus gold nodes and well)
---
Nuclear Material: Found it much better to take that workshop in the south (Federal Disposal Field HZ-21) and hold it for an hour or so.
---
Screws: Sugar Grove + Whitespring Bunker + Charleston Herald building (look for typewriters, 2 on first floor, 3 on 3 floor with 2 of those being on a desks between two office doors and the other being behind a locked office door)
---
Adhesive: Fort Defiance + Farming it from Mutfruit, Corn and Tato + Purified Water to make Vegetable Starch (helps to have perk cards Green thumb and Super Duper rank 3 to get more than normal)
---
 Take a break and play something else for a bit?  
---
That's not called heroism. It's called honesty, decency and a care factor for somebody else's game experience. Credit the person with what they earned :)
---
I think I'd stick with 2shot too. Its too annoying to hurt yourself with explosives. And jumping around while shooting at your feet is horrible xD... I know there are perks and mods to lower explosive dmg taken... but it doesnt make sense to use perks against your own dmg to protect yourself lol
---
What receiver are you using?
---
When you click to inspect it.
---
The 1st item on the list, tells you what type of firing rate it is.
---
Besides the good ol' just hold your button and does it fire more than 1 shot.
---
Then look for it yourself instead of delegating your quest for information to the sub and getting snippy that we aren't as helpful as Google. 
---
I did run lone wanderer at max.  Dropped it down to 2.   Only got tenderizer at 1 right now.  I had to move some points around the last few level ups.
---
Tried a few times, but get toasted by TSE shotguns, hiding backup, etc. Seems all the wanted people now are doing it deliberate.
---
no, you'll take that weight 20 missile launcher we didn't tell you about and you'll *like it*
---
Underground maybe?
---
Look it up yourself, dipshit. 
---
The fact that the Gatling plasma breaks within 2 reloads is sad
---
 I have not found that to be true, but you sound just like a youtuber spreading BS.  
---
Anti-armor sneak.
---
Hit them before you can be hit back.
---
It’s such a cool weapon just way to breakable 
---
It is kind of perplexing.  
---
I tell my husband on the regular that I kill mobs to support my camp obsession.
---
At the very least, they could just reskin the Santa beard Brown.
---
Get ammosmith. And any other perk that helps generate ammo. Otherwise your going to constantly be running out.
---
Well... If it's a two shot...
---
 Very cool.
---
On paper, one is supposed to be the slower firing but more hurting while the other was supposed to fast firing but low damage
---
In practice, however, the Minigun ends up being shite when used by the player (oh, but when a Super Mutant uses it, all of a sudden it deals a billion damage and you're dead in 2 seconds), since the damage is low enough that it won't out-DPS the Gatling gun whatsoever. Furious? Gatling Gun is better. Anti-Armor? Gatling Gun is better TSE? Gatling Gun literally overkills it's enemies. The Minigun isn't useful in any situation and the weak durability doesn't help much.
---
This is awesome. Upvote for sure, but why does every single person need to put a bearskin rug down? There isn't even a bear in the game to fight, is there? Maybe that's the reason for the rug? It's a rarity?
---
Just drop it on the ground, duper trash
---
how much for 100 bobble heads of strength and might do 100 of luck depending on price
---
Yup, I got the pink sun hat back when the game came out. Why can't i wear a hat and also have hair?
---
Counterpoint: I bought that MCM light fixture as soon as a friend texted me it was in the shop.
---
Seriously, though, they need a better mix. Still can't believe the Blackbird skin hasn't come back yet.
---
Also seriously, I did buy the MCM light fixture as soon as a friend texted me it was in the shop. 
---
Again.
---
 What receiver are you using? 
---
Two-SINGLE-Shots?
---
Or is it spraying?
---
Whats with all the market place bullshit? 
---
Gear disappearing is an isolated bug usually related to random disconnections, or the occasional missing item after a fast travel. They aren't about to see that one player has one rare item so it must be removed right away! That would be ludicrous
---
That is an odd color for pie
---
&lt;3
---
Make it offline and I'd be in heaven 
---
We had chili, and it turned out pretty dang good if I do say so myself. Thanks for asking! :D
---
Means literally nothing
---
Hold trigger = bullets?  You need the automatic rifle perk
---
Hold trigger = one bullet? You need the semi-automatic perk
---
Well guess what you cant make that judgment withought ever seeing the invintory. Nothing is duped. But thanks for the feedback 👍
---
That is not how spawning works. The first person to reach a location sets the spawn level. The last person to kill the spawn resets the level. 
---
Just server hop if need be
---
Pro tip for bats
---
Use third person mode until it lands
---
Not when you pair it with a Nuka Cola Quantum!
---
Dupers gotta clear their stocks due to Bethesda cracking down on them. They have said if you stop duping they will go easy type deal. So most likely they need to drops all their weight right down not to be banned 
---
Baby don't hurt me
---
 I have been looking for them for an age.  Even though I have a LVl 50 bloodied lever action I don't really belie hey exist.  It is the only drop of one I have had and never had a generic drop or found any mod or the plan.  I am LVL 65 and have been hunting a lot since level 40.  The amount of grind and rng for basic shit like this is ridiculous in FO76.   I really enjoy the game, but the balance is not there.  Fortunately, I got lucky to find a Handmade plan in only 5 rounds of patrol duty or I would have probably rage quit by now.  why the hell are those weapons so under-represented.   We won't even talk about guass weapons.  I have found one, and can buy the plans at the bunker, but do they even drop as legendaries?
---
There are things in game to allow you to play without PVP. You can basically ignore it entirely 
---
Gosh, if I ever visit this place my reflexes might not fail me...
---
I carry a set of "weightless" armor (with ultralight mods to make it weigh 0.0) just in case.
---
The lack of living NPCs with branching dialogue options is a big miss in this game. 
---
That, and the lack of a player hub.
---
Friend. That made me a spreadsheet?   
---
I'm very confused. 
---
There's a difference between "won't" and "can't". And it's stupid easy to purge a player inventory, tracking specific items might not be as easy. 
---
I would take all but 1 or 2 points from END and put them in AGI.  Take 3 off out of INT and put them in AGI too.  You don't need to run around with Weapon Artisan.  In END you can make up for some of those lost perks by going Herbivore so you don't have to carry all that food around or worry about food lasting in your inventory (eat on the hoof).  Take Super Duper off of Luck and use Starched Genes to keep Herbivore  (and what ever other mutations you want).  Class Freak will help offset the downsides to mutations.  If there are any other passive skills like the Weapon Artisan or Super Duper remove those as well.  They don't do you any benefits while you're out fighting.
---
Melee weapons are just stupidly overpowered. I played a melee blitz sneak build in Fallout 4 and could literally one shot mirelurk queens and everything. Just crazy powerful. Looks like the same in 76. 
---
Downside is you have to get much closer than pistol and rifle users. 
---
So you only have to pay once, but if you get banned once, you're going to get banned again on a dummy account. And those take time to make. And then you have to spend half an hour getting out of vault 76. Then what, you get banned again the next day. And then in a couple weeks the whole duping thing gets patched. 
---
If you get banned you can get unbanned so long as you don't dupe anymore, apparently. If you go to a dummy account and keep duping after getting banned once then there is no chance to get back your original account sans duped items, also apparently (according to RGD5Impact lol)
---
I don't know what the right answer is here. If I delete my comment and let this exploit you mentioned vanish into the shadows, well that seems wrong to me. 
---
 I have to brood. Maybe someone else can chime in with a solution.
---
I think you're talking about Berkeley springs. I found a toque there. Maybe the headgear is a random drop.
---
It does affect the damage resistance but only that from what I've seen. Energy resistance seems to stay the same. Works on armor and power armor. However some people say power armor is bugged and after taking any damage it reverts back to the regular value. Haven't tested that but have crafted the same item with different intelligence levels, can confirm
---
It happens to me all the time on Xbox. Made a post yesterday about it, I feel like it’s people just messing with others out of boredom. 
---
Yup my guy gets fullbody paralysis on xbox if i push b before the game world finishes loading.
---
I've found one near watoga out not too far from fissure sight. Whatevergun it had wrecked me and I couldnt find it after respawning but it was the one n only I've seen yet
---
I just wear my prototype hazmat suit and I go in nuke zones all the time. Mayhaps my sun-kissed perk mitigates the damage somewhat. 
---
  Let me correct this.
---
   Hold fire button = Rifle goes Pew - Rifleman Perk.
---
   Hold fire button = Rifle goes pew pew pew - Commando Perk.
---
Thank you for the info
---
Love camps like this. I'm too lazy and uncreative to get something like that done lol.
---
Fast travel to a train yard and dump everything in a stash
---
Rad-x and an x-01 power suit brings me down to about 2 rads a second
---
Check to see if they're supressed on the stat screen. 
---
Ok or if someone dupes on dummy accounts and just moves that inventory over to a main account then there main most likely wouldnt get banned as long as they dont have ridiculous numbers
---
I have a camp that's only about a 10 minute drive from Big Bend Tunnel. I've also been to Camden Park many times. I've seen the Gorge Bridge. I live about 10 minutes from the power plant that the Posiedon Energy Plant is based off of. I could go on for forever. It is so amazing to see these locations in game and know I have seen them. 
---
What wonderful job Bethesda did mixing the real world with the game, and how pity it fell victim to the poor technical execution. People won't appreciate this beauty cuz they'll crush 15 times in a raw, deinstall this crap and never think of it ever again. Can't blame them.
---
Thanks, not at my screen to confirm the different pew cards
---
That's what we call "lag". 
---
Is that in 76? The fuck is a bozar?
---
The only good Heavies are the 50 Cal (what the Minigun *should've* been), Gatling Gun (fuck-ton of damage per shot) and Fat-Man (no explanation needed)
---
The Gatling Laser's durability is extremely weak. So is the Gatling Plasma and Minigun. The Plasma *would've* been a great weapon in theory since it's more ammo effecient than the Laser and deals good damage but the durability is piss-poor
---
The Minigun's damage is terrible and overshadowed by the Gatling Gun
---
The Missile Launcher has poor durability, does as much damage as a frag grenade, and the ammo is surprisingly consumed fast with the Triple/Quad Barrel. It's great for downing the Cargobot though.
---
The Flamer chews through ammo and barely gets any from both the wild and via crafting. 
---
The Cryolator is a inferior version of the Flamer and suffers the same ammo problem.
---
And the MG42 does moderate damage, but chews ammo even faster than the Flamer and again has poor durability. The only saving grace is the fact that although .308 is pretty expensive to craft but it's easily found in the wild.
---
I use a scope so I can’t really 
---
I have yet to come across that cow suit you are wearing.
---
Submit yourself to Atom.
---
  I kind of like the MOB spawn thing.  Sometimes I got ridiculous XP, sometimes I got wasted.    I just avoid SBs, they don't drop enough to be worth the ammo I use and the damage they deal.  I do play a sneaky sniper type so disengaging, hiding and sneaking away is a thing.
---
meh, most of it's one off guys looking for or looking to move one rare item, sad sacks like this that deserve to get hit with a perma are rare. 
---
Doesn't matter to me, since all the legendary armor I get have less damage resistance than my normal armor.
---
What if it only goes pew pew?
---
In me and a friend's unscientific experience, your hunger and thirst rates seem to increase with the card slotted, not only stay put or go slower. So I wouldn't be surprised if your more robustly tested experience is more accurate than ours.

Bring back the Black Bird Power Armor skin. Only available for one day and I was on vacation.

Your assuming their main account has gotten banned and has all of their inventory on it. They could also use a dummy account that has only desired items on it to sell things for real life currency and if that account gets banned move on to another and another and another
---
Dear Bethesda and players.
---
Fallout76 has had it fair share of bad press. Regardless it still has a chance to become somthing great. Bethesda lets make this game great.
---
Platform:ps4
---
I want to adresss and clarify issues about some things i spoke about in my last post.
---
1: Workshops
---
2:PVP mode and how current and previous dupers will effect the economy.
---
3: end game content/challenges.
---
4: community feed back in comments section of this post
---
Workshops: Workshops was intended to encourage pvp. A way for us to challenge each others skill against real live players. Bethesda designed workshops so that if I own a workshops another player can claim it at the workbench. Once the other player has made a claim on it I have the option to fight him for the workshop or leave and let him take it. A great attempt on Bethesda to give those players that love pvp a place in the game. There should be a place in the game for pve players and pvp players. The problem is some players make it impossible to take a workshop without getting a bounty by building completely around the workbench so that there is absolutely no way to access it without lock picking a door or shooting down a wall. This gives that player a huge advantage because once I have that bounty  they know I'm in their workshop location.  2nd they can use end game weapons and perks and 1 shot kill me at anytime before I even have the chance to try and make the claim on that workshop. It would be much more fair if once a player steps into a workshop area both the attackers and defenders are automatically flagged for pvp. Give bounties to griefers that blow up other players houses, that i agree, but not for buildings in workshops zones.  At this current time workshops is the only real pvp that we have. I can never get matches with the hunt or hunted radio station and I dont run around the map looking to kill noobs and blow up their houses. I'm not looking to grief anyone. I simply just want fair pvp. Workshops is not the best place for pve players. Those pve lovers that want to hate on me for this post and my last post please understand that workshops is a pvp zone. You have the whole map to play pve so don't cry when some high lvl takes your workshop away. Expect it to happen. Maybe this will change when Bethesda releases there new pvp mode. Until then, If you don't want pvp then simply stay away from workshops. The other big issue is the rewards of owning a workshop isn't really worth the time invested.  There are many other places on the map to farm all this stuff. Give us pvp players real incentive to owning and working a workshop. I'm the type of guy that when I really find a game that I love, I play it for years. I've always been a fan of apocalyptic survival pvp games. I gave Fallout76 a try simply because of it's play style and because of the promise of pvp. So far Fallout76 has everything I want in a survival game except for the lack of pvp and end game challenges.
---
2: Bethesdas new pvp mode and duping: 
---
I'm in high hopes that all forms of duping will be patched out of the game before the new pvp mode has been released. This duping has completely destroyed the fallout economy. I hope that you require new characters to be made for this new pvp server that don't have access to pve servers so that duped items can't be traded away from pve mode to pvp mode.  In single player games duping has no effect on anyone's game play except their own. On an online game it effects everyone's gameplay. Duping will be the death of Fallout76. It is in my opinion the single most important issue to be addressed.
---
3: End game content and challenges: with end game gear and perks I find it difficult to find good pve challenges. Fighting the scorched beast queen over and over can get old fast. I'm just asking for more locations with different, harder mobs. I'm confident Bethesda will bring this to us.
---
My last post I got a few haters. Maybe I came off as a griefer, that is not what I'm about. I'm just big into pvp and workshops being the only option for pvp in a game that I really like to play, it kinda leaves me no other option but to jump severs and take workshops to instigate that pvp. If you're low lvl and I kill you and take your workshop just be cool hit me up in voice chat or send me a mail on the ps4. Ill give you the workshop back and move on to look for others that want to pvp. Lets work as a community to help make this game fun for all types of players, pve and pvp. Fallout76 still has a real chance to be something great, something we can enjoy playing long into the future. I encourage all to comment on this post. Give Bethesda your ideas.

I have one you forgot, when you tame an animal to be used at your camp if the creature dies and you move camp it will take a permanent 10% of your camp budget and be used as "stored" even though there is nothing there. Taming other creatures adds to this 10%. 
---
Hope it never will, cuz I have it :)
---
Go to options and go to change user filter on the subreddit. 
---
I would like to browse your inventory! Mainly looking for vanguard combat armor that’s the heavy variant 
---
Unyielding
---
Change your flair when viewing the sub click the 3 little dots.
---
Give us the option in settings to choose between prioritizing players or mobs. This is t really a pacifist issue.
---
Huh that's f2p. Its already b2p. Getting rid of the box sell is f2p
---
If only we had more NPCs... oh well
---
That's just overly complicated.
---
Legendary effects should be craftable mods using materials salvaged grom legendary items of that effects. Balance is around number of mats, etc.  This way, crafter building can also become more significant. 
---
Since last patch been a rise in CTDs on pc and Errors screens on consoles. Hopefully they have some more stability patches to come in the next update.
---
Alright then I'll just email Bethesda about it as this is their problem anyways. Thanks for letting me know about the exploit you found. Hopefully they can work with Microsoft to fix that.
---
It effects my fat man. I can see the fat man drop from 20 to 14 when I equip Bear arms ( if this is the perk card). I  can send pick of my Fat Man and the weight difference  before and after the perk is on and off.
---
Maybe the patches it sense then? 
---
Happy hunting.
---
Suppressed by radx or strange in numbers glitched on you.
---
Imagine exiting vault 76 and boom scorchbeast
---
Yes, but I was responding to the comment that he was doing slap damage because he was passive. If he is doing slap dammage then he cannot be passive.
---
You are not.  I enjoyed that show.
---
That would be an ip ban. Microsoft already said they wouldn’t do ip bans for mistakes that bethesda has made
---
  Burst limited, so far there are no perks that effect it.
---
Don’t know about that in this specific situation, simply due to a death and a fast travel it would be more of a did not load correctly 
---
Rad sponge and a team. 
---
Definitely needs to be harder to get wanted from attacking bases and stuff. Singke shits should not flag you 
---
Understandable.
---
If you think my anecdotal experience is invalid simply because it contradicts your anecdotal experience then maybe it's time someone told you that 2 people playing the exact same game can end up with wildly different experiences
---
Yea same here this was my first as well
---
Thank you 
---
That's an awesome find!
---
That must have been it!
---
I hate that, I am definitely in pacifist mode and if I blow up one of them dame whitesprings robots it is over 
---
Yeah, I thought it was the other fella I was responding to when I wrote it, but left it up anyway to clarify the details of why this presents an issue. Really shouldn't have been done in response to you.
---
I don't use perks for heavy guns and it works well enough for me
---
I am so very jealous.
---
Look up the quest for rad shield, the stack rad shield, rad-x, rad-x diluted. You can also get grape and orange nuka cola from the cola vendor inside the white springs resort. Grape removes rads and orange gives you another +25 rad resistance. Makes it so it’s not too bad then make sure you have radaway and stims on hand. First aid +3 goes along way.
---
Sentient deathclaw friends?
---
Do you have healing factor? I’m fairly sure it isn’t working for me.
---
Not really...
---
Fuk
---
What's odd is the disconnects seem to happen a lot to random people. My gameplay has been really stable for example while other have been getting worse. So strange
---
Great shot!
---
Just do it.
---
Honestly I just save the majority of the rad away I come across and it’s all I’ve ever needed.
---
I’m with you on that. Listening to the fun shots and firefights in the distance make it so immersive to me.
---
You can re-craft and level up the gear from the Order of Mysteries quests, no need to grind.
---
Strange in numbers happens when a team mate leaves, radx suppresses all mutations. Use radshield instead, or radx diluted.
---
Wow that's very Canadian of you. Whoop your butt and then buy you a beer.
---
It reduces the damage you deal to a very small percent...which means a level 150 takes sometimes up to FOUR whole hits to murder a level twenty player.   
---
It's a joke that bethesda put in that does pretty much fuck-all. 
---
Neither can I, but it's good to know I'm not *completely* crazy. =P
---
Not at all but i wish i could get a private server you lucky son of a gun.
---
No, your point was different. That's the issue.
---
The first point was about how no one was responding to requests from your female friend streamer regarding her reporting to microsoft, Bethesda and whomever the third party was.
---
That's VERY different to the point you've changed it to because that actually makes sense to the title.
---
You were complaining that no one was acting on reporting. Now you've changed the story entirely that it's about passive mode not being effective enough.
---
These are not the same things.
---
Do you want to put back up the original post to see what the real reaction should be from all these folks?
---
It's worth noting it's only really useful for power armor as legendary armor and weapons can't be crafted and will be superior to the crafted versions, since you can add mods to both. The perk "Fix it Good" repairs armor and power armor up to 200% of normal maximum condition, increasing damage resistance. Crafting one power armor piece with 30 int gave me 86 DR while the base version (63 DR) when repaired with this perk gave me 84 DR. Not a big difference but I'm working on maxing out intelligence to see how high I can get it to see if it's actually worth it. Also testing if the crafted piece with 30 int can be repaired 200%, boosting it even more.
---
He isn't the only NPC
---
I just bring a shit load of rad away
---
 Rad-X and Diluted Rad-x stack, also I think wearing a hazmat suit helps and get X-01 PA at the highest level helps.  Bring lots of Rad-X and ad Away if you want staying power.
---
Which rad suit do you have on?  There's one that gives 500 rad protection and one that gives 1000.  I wear the latter with no Rad-X and it takes a good 20+ minutes to even get to 25% radiated.
---
Toxic Valley Treasure Map #3 does not work at obvious location for it to work at. (In the Pioneer Scout Camp area)

Ok cool
---
This would be neat and helpful to organize
---
Beats my furious +1P
---
Its odd right normally all solved within hours. No idea why this one is remaining lost to us.
---
I had one with one other low level. By the time i was ready to go enjoy this empty world my game crashed.
---
Its only stocked like that as you said because of the Queen. Same applied and still somewhat applies to checking the station near Whitespring after nuke runs.
---
Store your arch when you're away from your camp.
---

---
If Destiny did it I don't know why FO76 couldn't have it. Hell put some lore entries in there for a bigger rip. Shove some pip-boy games in there to prove superiority
---
We had a mod that opened the trading cap from 5000 to 25,000. Then bethesda said they fixed it as an "exploit" and then implemented a buggy version of what the mod did.
---
Someone can't respect the authority of a 350+ group over them, gl in your 1 person crew. When you interchange the words "I" and "we" just say "me" me wants to have me own clan.
---
I went the wrong way with two-handed weapons. I do tickle dmg compared to that.
---
Deuterium is simply water with H3 isotope of Hydrogen instead of the more common H2. In Fallout, the water is radioactive because there are radioactive isotopes dissolved in it. Thus bolling the water would remove the isotopes from the steam, thus removing the rad intake. 
---
The Norwegian Wood mod is good, unless you run across mutant Beatles.  
---
If there's a will there's a way. But I dont think Bethesda has the will unfortunately. 
---
If you're going for an unarmed build the best possible legendary armor effects are unyielding and + strength, for sneak use weightless or chameleon (don't mix) and for overall damage resistance go for vangaurds
---
That sucks man i have been dieing for private servers myself. I want to lock one down and have it invite only. I am really hoping they can give them to us this year. Got pages and pages of mates on the friends list would be nice to just focus on bringing them into one world.
---
Too often we are stuck in wait ques to join together it bloody sucks.
---
I'd be afraid that the lag between the app and the server would open the game up to more exploits. It's probably better we not have this
---
Thank you I’ve been sitting in the launch room for like 30mins searching for it 
---
I have no anti-rad perks and I take &lt;1 rads per tic in just a haz-suit without rad-x.  Last run I only popped 2 rad-aways after about 20 minutes.  Not sure if there is something I'm missing
---
Did you get it from the machine or west tech.
---
reddits search feature is notoriously awful, id wager there is a post at least 1 of these posts every 2 or 3 days, I didn't intend for my post to be taken 100% seriously and i apologise for any offence given.
---
The Bozar is from Fallout 2 and New Vegas, it's like a weird light machine-gun/sniper rifle hybrid.
---
I think the comparison is that guns in Fallout just aren't made as fun as they used to be compared to how they are in 76. I don't think balance was that great in most games but damn if they didn't have some overpowered and fun weapons, gun or not. Most of the time I find a weapon in 76 I think "oh this looks really fun to use!!" and it isn't. It's the exact opposite of how a Fallout game should be, let alone any shooter.
---
I love all the Super mutants. I love it when they say "Here...catch" as they throw a frag granade. All the little things they say crack me up. 
---
What if it just loaded the last save it had so you can see it?
---
Definitely. I had my entire camp, every single part of it, destroyed in less than 10 seconds
---
Okay, have a good day.
---
I got it from the machine in Morgantown. 
---
Cool
---
I did like her story though. It was pretty interesting seeing how her story was so interconnected with the raider quest line.
---
I love him but I'd die for Chally the moomoo
---
Just use a friend to transfer to an alt?
---
I've never noticed anyone by my camp though :( I'm under Harper's ferry bridge. Come get free purified water lol
---
If a „name“ is all it takes for you never critically question or judge the content of a video or message, you are gullible (bad, at least for you)
---
Feel free to summarize the „full story of pulowsky“ as seen in the video 
---
This has happened to me at least 5-10 times
---
PVP is fun for people who enjoy it. Thing is, F76 PvP is just ass because Bethesda has no idea how to make an actual funa nd engaging PvP experience. Instead you have this half ass stupid "try to please everyone but no one is happy" medium where it's all just badly designed. But then again, badly designed seems to be a staple of this game. 
---
If it was viewable only and you couldn't take actions to equip/use/drop, I think it'd be ok. And that'd still be pretty useful for when I'm trying to organize trades and can't remember what my current build's armor is or what inventory I have in stash to sell
---
MB or GB?
---
That doesn't seem to happen to me, instead as soon as I crouch back down to caution they start running towards walking tanks.  Sometimes its helpful, but sometimes I have to stop hiding to get their attention again.
---
I saw him often when I had not enough caps to get anything, now I can't find him anywhere.
---
what gear do you use.
---
Had the same thing happen at a workshop. A friend and I had just taken and defended a power plant workshop. Both of us were around level 85 at the time, and we were just trading extra plans and talking about what we were going to do next, when I was immediately killed by an invisible player with a 10mm smg. I choose revenge, spawn back in and bring up the map. He's about level 50 or so. I head back over, take a bunch of drugs, and blast the hell out of him with an exploding round shotgun, with stealth bonuses, perk bonuses, etc.
---
A lot of probably know where this is going. Not only was I unable to kill him, I was barely able to make a dent in his health. He turned and immediately killed me again with his 10mm smg. At this point I'm convinced he's cheating. My friend has gotten back, in stealth armor, starts meleeing him, does no damage and is also one shot with the smg. We try one more time to get him, working together, and are barely able to get 1/8th of his health off. Finally, I creep out into the woods and start head shotting him with a silenced rifle. Once he realizes that he can't find me on the map he server hops.
---
We looked the scenario up that evening, and that is when I learned about the bizzare, inexplicable way that PvP works in Fallout 76. And that is why I want nothing whatsoever to do with it.
---
I love this game. It is beautiful, fun, frustrating, engrossing, creative, and filled with all manner of kind, sociable people. I've run up to level 9s at their base, built them a set of studded, deep pocketed leather armor and a tricked out sniper and run off into the woods like a jackass. I've had others do similar for me. I've seen the most ridiculous glitches and killed every damn mole rat I can get my hands on.
---
But PvP has never, for one moment, been enjoyable, understandable, rewarding, compelling, or, even in the most base way, interesting. The risk is low, once you know how to protect your stuff, but the reward is also low. The challenge is overwhelmed and eliminated by broken scaling, and the fact that 'slap damage' from the right loadout can kill you fairly quickly while your using a terminal (in pacifist mode) makes it hard to feel like it is optional. 
---
If it isn't fun, doesn't work right, and can't be avoided, it's probably going to wear a lot of people out.
---
I had the same panic reaction on a 10 cap bounty that I got accidentally damaging a player’s base (they had set up a XP farm / shoot at ghouls in Whitespring trap ... like a deer blind but for ghouls lol) - I was getting chased and shot at (not by the dude who’s base I was in) so I panicked and fast traveled to my camp. then I realized the bounty hunter dude had fast travel chased me to my base so I fucking logged out as fast as I could. As far as I can tell, it worked. 
---
That's fair, everyone has their own views on what constitutes a worthwhile microtransaction. After wasting the cash for Tricentenniel Edition, I can definitely relate to not being incentivized to buy any Atoms. Until I see something really cool (though cool is subjective) I'm just gonna grind for Atoms.
---
I hope you get something that piques your interest, soon :)
---
I'm on PS4. I've got at least 8 of everything. Like 30 fluorescent lol
---
How would anyone know that right away besides you? Can I try? 
---
For anyone living under a rock and don't know me, my rank is Liberty Prime in my clan. See?
---
Yeah I gotta get my hands on these plans. Picked up an exploding lever action but would really like some mods for it
---
The higher your luck stat, the more chance to get it. I tend to get it easy enough I started to drop bags off of useful things for new players to find and include a pie. I hope they notice its rare. It's fun to watch someone walk up to it and discover goodies.
---
I highly doubt there are "millions" of people playing fo76...lol.
---
Unreal thanks buddy.
---
That’s why I made a comment for it. 
---
It's fine at lower levels, but as you approach end game the loot in these generally isn't worth it if you need the perception points allocated to something that does more damage.
---
I got one from the water park and I kept it with me for good luck (no real luck bonus) but one day I was spamming purified water and accidently ate my pie. Though I just went to the (top of the) West Tech building and got another (static spawn location).
---
I would recommend against it as customizing your favorite gear is the end game right now. If you are not interested in grinding it out yourself, this is a generous offer
---
It will be. Because what's the alternative. The same PvE over and over? PvE can only keep people interested in a game for so long until they move on. The game needs either constant PvE content addition at a stable rate, or a massive grind to keep the hardcore PvEers occupied. 
---
Or PvP, which can keep games alive much longer than they would without. 
---
Blah blah blah. Your spelling and grammar are atrocious. Consider taking up reading instead of playing games for a while. You don't make the rules for Bethesda, little man.  
---
You must be a real gamer to say that, I hope your mom loves your humor as much as I do.
---
Needs max armorer in i. Perk. From vendors buy bos heavy armor plans, deepest pocketed. Little ways west of Wotoga vendor is traincar with bos knight **under armor** plan.
---
Blast zone radiation will make you dead straight away without pa or hazmat suit. There is a fuckin crazy effective naked blast zone nukesanddragons perk loadout somewhere around here.
---
Your English is worse than your argument 
---
Lol....I highly doubt there are "millions" playing fallout 76.
---
Where are all the talking ghouls?
---
exactly this. I'd prefer if the messages appeared in the top left corner. The mob that comes in right after the scorchbeast queen dies has killed me a few times just because I couldn't see what was coming at me
---
It pretty much locks out lower level players though. At least with Whitesprings, if there are any enemies inbound, you have robots to help protect your entry/exit.
---
Fallout tactics had the Gauss minigun, which was exactly as overpowered and ridiculous as it sounds, but you could probably only fire the burst 15 times with the way ammo worked. We have steaming pile of shit minigun that is completely worthless without legendary modifiers haha yay
---
It is and it isn't.  People leave dog shit on my lawn. They probably go home and dupe right afterwards.
---
Not a bad idea this actually 
---
Give it about 10 months and you might just get what you want.
---
He literally said that Bethesda spoke to him in the title you dunce
---
sounds fake
---
I do the same but it is annoying to server hop if I have a question in the area
---
It doesnt delete the bag it just gets rid of the marker with a new marker so you'll have to find it
---
Dear Bethesda and players.                                                  
---
Fallout76 has had it fair share of bad press.                        Regardless it still has a chance to become somthing great. Bethesda lets make this game great.
---
Platform:ps4.                                                                             
---
I want to adresss and clarify issues about some things i spoke about in my last post.                                   
---
1: Workshops.
---
2:PVP mode and how current and previous dupers will effect the economy.                                                           
---
3: end game content/challenges.                                        
---
4: community feed back in comments section of this post.
---
(1)Workshops: Workshops was intended to encourage pvp. A way for us to challenge each others skill against real live players. Bethesda designed workshops so that if I own a workshops another player can claim it at the workbench. Once the other player has made a claim on it I have the option to fight him for the workshop or leave and let him take it. A great attempt on Bethesda to give those players that love pvp a place in the game. There should be a place in the game for pve players and pvp players. The problem is some players make it impossible to take a workshop without getting a bounty by building completely around the workbench so that there is absolutely no way to access it without lock picking a door or shooting down a wall. This gives that player a huge advantage because once I have that bounty  they know I'm in their workshop location.  2nd they can use end game weapons and perks and 1 shot kill me at anytime before I even have the chance to try and make the claim on that workshop. It would be much more fair if once a player steps into a workshop area both the attackers and defenders are automatically flagged for pvp. Give bounties to griefers that blow up other players houses, that i agree, but not for buildings in workshops zones.  At this current time workshops is the only real pvp that we have. I can never get matches with the hunt or hunted radio station and I dont run around the map looking to kill noobs and blow up their houses. I'm not looking to grief anyone. I simply just want fair pvp. Workshops is not the best place for pve players. Those pve lovers that want to hate on me for this post and my last post please understand that workshops is a pvp zone. You have the whole map to play pve so don't cry when some high lvl takes your workshop away. Expect it to happen. Maybe this will change when Bethesda releases there new pvp mode. Until then, If you don't want pvp then simply stay away from workshops. The other big issue is the rewards of owning a workshop isn't really worth the time invested.  There are many other places on the map to farm all this stuff. Give us pvp players real incentive to owning and working a workshop. I'm the type of guy that when I really find a game that I love, I play it for years. I've always been a fan of apocalyptic survival pvp games. I gave Fallout76 a try simply because of it's play style and because of the promise of pvp. So far Fallout76 has everything I want in a survival game except for the lack of pvp and end game challenges.                               
---
(2) Bethesdas new pvp mode and duping: 
---
I'm in high hopes that all forms of duping will be patched out of the game before the new pvp mode has been released. This duping has completely destroyed the fallout economy. I hope that you require new characters to be made for this new pvp server that don't have access to pve servers so that duped items can't be traded away from pve mode to pvp mode.  In single player games duping has no effect on anyone's game play except their own. On an online game it effects everyone's gameplay. Duping will be the death of Fallout76. It is in my opinion the single most important issue to be addressed.                                                                                 
---
(3) End game content and challenges: with end game gear and perks I find it difficult to find good pve challenges. Fighting the scorched beast queen over and over can get old fast. I'm just asking for more locations with different, harder mobs. I'm confident Bethesda will bring this to us.                                               
---
My last post I got a few haters. Maybe I came off as a griefer, that is not what I'm about. I'm just big into pvp and workshops being the only option for pvp in a game that I really like to play, it kinda leaves me no other option but to jump severs and take workshops to instigate that pvp. If you're low lvl and I kill you and take your workshop just be cool hit me up in voice chat or send me a mail on the ps4. Ill give you the workshop back and move on to look for others that want to pvp. Lets work as a community to help make this game fun for all types of players, pve and pvp. Fallout76 still has a real chance to be something great, something we can enjoy playing long into the future. I encourage all to comment on this post. Give Bethesda your ideas. 
---
Nice, but no need to brag
---
'You knew the risk'  :-D . Kids today. As I said, go and read a book for a change. It will be a good experience for you. 
---
Death needs to have consequences. Sometimes they are harsh. 
---
He made good arguments and your reply is a generic "go play X generic over played game" reply. Could you be any more basic?
---
The worst part is trying to trade something to a low level for free and hitting 25000....  you just give up and re-trade, no way in hell I'm going back to zero from 25000.
---
Does vampire work with bashing? 
---
Nope. I’ve heard that before. Maybe it’s new, but I tried that each and every time it happened knowing exactly where my bag is. Doesn’t happen anymore at the very least
---
People need to learn to listen to quests. OP probably usain bolt through the free state questline and never paid attention to anything. 
---
&gt;could/can it be that hard to leave a bag on the ground 
---
It usually should do so - I assume you either ran in a bug (or someone looted your bag) or you got server disconnected before you could pick it up 
---
It's gotten progressively worse for me over the last 2 patches. Now I'm all but guaranteed a disconnect at least once per play session of maybe a couple of hours or so.
---
If you're worried about it being destroyed, build it and store it instead of scrapping it. You'll have to place and re-wire it every time you want to use it, but it keeps it safe
---
In fallout 2 the flamer was wonderful. I barbecued many super mutants. I fitted an entire settlement in fallout 4 with flamers... They barbecued themselves with friendly fire it was a terrible idea. But flame throwers should be awesome and aren't and it's sad.
---
The entire game is an afterthought. 
---
Oh you bought it? How much did you pay?
---
My Gatling does 400 damage per shot. The 50 cal has lower DPH and higher DPS. 
---
Figure out where the game mechanics that raise damage live, figure out how to met their conditions, and your weapons won’t suck. 
---
It’s an RPG, not call of duty. The same weapon won’t yield the same result in different hands. 
---
Learn to drive buddy. 
---
I have a ton of lower power cores so I moved the higher ones to my stash and I swap them out from time to time. It’s not ideal but it’s nice when you area using 10 at 25% and your stash has 62% and above.
---
sometimes a little, sometimes a lot, not never.
---
tedious.  last queen I did dc'd, then froze, then crashed.  Today's queen, zero issues good guys win.  iono.  crashed later lol.
---
Thing is I'd like it if a random person came and used it. I just worry about that one guy that says oooo smash camp 
---
Wait, I don't think the power armour and hazmat suits both stack.
---
Also depends on the power armour. Not all are equal in terms of rad resist.
---
When you take a significant amount of damage, you stagger. When staggered, sentinel is no longer active
---
Mission Failed. You'll get em next time.
---
I have this issue where 90 percent of the time I get empath, but 100 percent of the time radaway removes marsupial first 
---
Hah. Have you done this already?
---
„Go away solid snake!“
---
Seriously... Bethesda needs to have some guys try to do a ten-mile ruck march while carrying a 25-pound rifle at the ready to get a reality check.
---
...but then they'd probably nerf the carry weight, too.
---
The reason no one PvPs much is because of the baby pacifist mode making world encounter PvP basically non-existant, and as such, the game is a PvP bore. It's just a bad boring PvP game because it's designed so badly. PvE-ers are afraid of something that can actually kill them and as such, avoid it as much as possible, and PvP-ers end up with next to no real content. 
---
Exactly why I want it. We deserve it if that's how trading is going to be.
---
That's what I think whenever there is only a 10-15 cap reward. I got a 'wanted' sign once for accidentally whacking a weapons bench I was borrowing, with permission, because I pressed the wrong button. No damage but I still got killed. 
---
Ninja-ghouls or ghouls that learned how to use a stealth boys
---
Best thing to do is get something with unyielding and sentinel (15% less damage while standing and not moving) or cavalier's (15% less damage while sprinting). Cavalier's might be a better fit for a melee build, but sentinel would be better for the queen.
---
i too have a 3 story house there, great job bud i might need to switch it to brick after seeing this one
---
Wonderful, one more mess to clean up.
---
If you haven't picked up any new loot since your death, the bag should persist between deaths. But if you pick up any loot before getting back to your bag, then you die, you'll drop a new bag, and that's when the old one disappears.
---
If you hadn't picked up any loot, then the bag SHOULD have been there still. In that case it might be an actual bug.
---
Liking PvP doesn't mean you are a griefer. 
---
I thought Bolstering beat out vanguards? I guess if your stealth sniper vanguard's would be better for for any type of mele I would think that bolstering would be better.
---
Where is my middle finger emote and my naughty nightwear?!
---
You can't consider legendary effects when talking about weapon balance. Of course a TSE heavy weapon is going to be strong. Anything TSE is strong. A damn TSE pipe pistol is strong.
---
Abusing an overpowered aspect of the game doesn't make it okay to make the base weapons unbalanced. I shouldn't have to farm whitesprings for days to find a legendary heavy weapon worth using.
---
put it in an open access room guarded by turrets
---
After you die you get a misc quest to grab your loot. You may have clicked it off. Turn it back on
---
Ninghouls I like it, sucks they’re explosion proof 
---
Uh ya, ok... that's a far cry from the claim the Op made... "He claims Bethesda told him it was going free to play"
---
 please hold my hand and show me where the bad man said Bethesda told him FO76 was going free to play.
---
You won't, because you can't. You're a bunch of liars banding together to call someone else a liar.
---
I had that happen today. Server I was on crashed and when I rejoined a new one I was the only one on it. 
---
Cleaned the Whitespring, a couple of events, good times. 
---
I believe that this is what Todd meant when he said during the announcement that "Of course you can play this game solo."
---
Not what this post is about
---
I normally have no enemies spawn near my camp and the handful of times they did they shot one mutfruit up. I don't have protection for any of my camp. My fusion generator is on my roof, a slight drop from the bridges by Harper's ferry. Worst case scenario I'd have to go scavenging for 10 minutes to fix it all lol

    (1)Workshops: Workshops was intended to encourage pvp. A way for us to challenge each others skill against real live players. Bethesda designed workshops so that if I own a workshops another player can claim it at the workbench. Once the other player has made a claim on it I have the option to fight him for the workshop or leave and let him take it. A great attempt on Bethesda to give those players that love pvp a place in the game. There should be a place in the game for pve players and pvp players. The problem is some players make it impossible to take a workshop without getting a bounty by building completely around the workbench so that there is absolutely no way to access it without lock picking a door or shooting down a wall. This gives that player a huge advantage because once I have that bounty  they know I'm in their workshop location.  2nd they can use end game weapons and perks and 1 shot kill me at anytime before I even have the chance to try and make the claim on that workshop. It would be much more fair if once a player steps into a workshop area both the attackers and defenders are automatically flagged for pvp. Give bounties to griefers that blow up other players houses, that i agree, but not for buildings in workshops zones.  At this current time workshops is the only real pvp that we have. I can never get matches with the hunt or hunted radio station and I dont run around the map looking to kill noobs and blow up their houses. I'm not looking to grief anyone. I simply just want fair pvp. Workshops is not the best place for pve players. Those pve lovers that want to hate on me for this post and my last post please understand that workshops is a pvp zone. You have the whole map to play pve so don't cry when some high lvl takes your workshop away. Expect it to happen. Maybe this will change when Bethesda releases there new pvp mode. Until then, If you don't want pvp then simply stay away from workshops. The other big issue is the rewards of owning a workshop isn't really worth the time invested.  There are many other places on the map to farm all this stuff. Give us pvp players real incentive to owning and working a workshop. I'm the type of guy that when I really find a game that I love, I play it for years. I've always been a fan of apocalyptic survival pvp games. I gave Fallout76 a try simply because of it's play style and because of the promise of pvp. So far Fallout76 has everything I want in a survival game except for the lack of pvp and end game challenges.
---
                               
---
    (2) Bethesdas new pvp mode and duping: 
---
                                                                                 
---
    (3) End game content and challenges: with end game gear and perks I find it difficult to find good pve challenges. Fighting the scorched beast queen over and over can get old fast. I'm just asking for more locations with different, harder mobs. I'm confident Bethesda will bring this to us.
---
                                               
---
    My last post I got a few haters. Maybe I came off as a griefer, that is not what I'm about. I'm just big into pvp and workshops being the only option for pvp in a game that I really like to play, it kinda leaves me no other option but to jump severs and take workshops to instigate that pvp. If you're low lvl and I kill you and take your workshop just be cool hit me up in voice chat or send me a mail on the ps4. Ill give you the workshop back and move on to look for others that want to pvp. Lets work as a community to help make this game fun for all types of players, pve and pvp. Fallout76 still has a real chance to be something great, something we can enjoy playing long into the future. I encourage all to comment on this post. Give Bethesda your ideas. 
---
Oh, look. A significant game mechanic that I've never heard of after god knows how many hours of play. Lol
---
Could you put a mine next to it? 
---
B U G G E D
---
1. Anything TSE that isn’t a minigun or a shotgun is rubbish. TS destroys accuracy and recoil and makes you miss more than what it adds. E makes it not proximity safe. 
---
2. I can and will consider all game mechanics made available as part of balance. If you want to abstain from figuring out some of them, that’s your issue. The game isn’t the subset you decided you want to limit yourself to. 
---
As far as armor - just the haz-suit (+1000 rad res) no PA.  Don't believe I have anything else that effects it, but I might have something I'm forgetting.
---
Does Fallout community hate Fallout 76? If so why?
---
Thanks.  I actually updated to the most recent driver and it seems to be working slightly better.  I will probably also hit the texture slider, as that seems to be the biggest draw on VRAM.  Thanks!
---
You have to start the next part via terminal 
---
I'll figure something out like that later, in the meantime I need to get a few atom shop items and plans for t45 PA so I convert my camp to a BoS recruiting station where I'll give people a free set of lvl 25 PA and direct them to begin joining the brotherhood hahaha
---
It depends, how long you left bag there? Try droping some spoilet meat to two different paper bags and check out, how long they will last.
---
You'll still have to step into the tin can for Blast zones but with the right perks you can be plenty tanky outside of it. I run 2h melee as well with dodgy, blocker, sole survivor(whatever the autostim perk is) and lone wanderer, and even keeping my health at around 40% with rads to keep my Bloodied, Adrenal Reaction and Unyielding buffs going I'm pretty much invincible (Mr. Gutsies still scare me though)
---
Build I currently run with a bloodied Grognak and 3 pieces of unyielding. I play solo 100% of the time so I don't really have any experience on what team play swap ins. Also way more endurance than most people take I think, lol. Unyielding makes up for the low agility though. 
---

---
But you have to have low health and if you have low health and out of power armor you might as well do more damage with unyielding bloodied unarmed.
---
.50 caliber, massive damage, four shots in a mag, weights a lot?
---
All check, you have a genuine Barrett anti material rifle 
---
Good choice 
---
Cool two cents. I don’t like it
---
Now tell me, is it good to use? Like better than something with faster fire rate?
---
I bought one off the Whitespring trainstation vendor that has plus 30% damage to scorched, 10% more damage while aiming and plus 1 perception.

Hey! I like to write short stories about fallout 76. Could I use this photo? Will give full photo credit to you! 
---
The amount of times I’ve accidentally shot a whitesprings bot and then had to switch servers is incredibly annoying. 
---
I live near Fayetteville and Oak Hill, West Virginia. I wish the New River Gorge Bridge and the Gorge was a lot bigger. 
---
But I used to go to Lewisburg a lot, and the Greenbrier is about 30 minutes away from Greenbrier Medical Valley. Which I’m surprised the State Park and GBMV didn’t make into the game. 
---
But yeah if you can go see the Greenbrier it’s worth it. 
---
The missile launcher is terrible. Extremely low damage for a missile. Weight is 37. Damage is trash. Ammo weight is 2. Damage is trash. Okay the TS should be good. Meh. The missiles do seek the target with the targeting computer. That's cool. So that way you can for sure hit with trash damage. Rifles do more damage, weigh significantly less, and are likely to hit more often than not. 
---
Missile launcher, probably not worse than minigun, but is still bad.
---
The Gatling gun furious with a prime receiver is a decent weapon. Even without the heavy guns perks. Pretty good. 
---
.50cal machine gun is only usable with TSE and that's gonna be nerfed soon, so meh. 
---
MG42 I didn't even bother since every other heavy weapon is trash. 
---
If you have a weapon with a massive weight and the ammo is also heavy, you'd expect it to do some real damage. But not these weapons. 
---
Gatling plasma I was actually impressed with. Has a kick but the damage tears up those scorchedbeasts. I'd give it an overall rating of meh. 
---
Gatling laser is fun to shoot with but eats up those fusion cores unless you have the extra duration perk. 
---
 .308 machine gun. Meh. Hunting rifle is better for .308 ammos. 
---
So for actually usable heavy weapons, in ranking of best to worst I'd rate 
---
Gatling gun&gt;Gatling plasma&gt;Gatling laser&gt; .50cal&gt;MG42&gt;.308&gt;missile launcher&gt;minigun. 
---
I have a camp in the mire with a black titanium extractor so i have that locked and have a room overlooking a cliff that has my crafting stations and access to my generators that is secured with a locked door.
---
I have only ever gotten caps from it, usually like 20-25 not worth the .308 spent to kill the lurks
---
You’ve lost any ability to bd taken at face value with me. I don’t believe you.
---
First you try and argue couple doesn’t mean two. Then when I extend the time to 4 hours, you come back with the over used obtuse insult/rebuttal.
---
I simple don’t believe you. Your own words did you in. 
---
This is where my CAMP is, please delete this post
---
I can always tell when I'm on a fresh server because all the doors to commonly used places like train stations are closed.
---
You're not getting the point. I'm trying to make the game for better overall by offering a suggestion. I'm not ignorant to ways of dealing damage. I know fairly well how to do damage. I have a explosive Gatling gun that serves me just fine.
---
Just because there's a way for anything to have ridiculous amounts of damage (so ridiculous they're nerfing it) doesn't make it balanced and something that should be left alone.
---
Have link? I couldn't help my self to lol in real life. Tried holding it in but cant. Need to see this
---
Because they were originally meant to be used only with power armor. There was a discussion on the FO4 sub about it some time ago.
---
When i logged at day those challenges changes. i had 0/8 bud have completed bigger half of flowers. So i belive, i would not be able to do it.

Curious how many fusion cores you carry with you at one time

I'll hit you up with a request tomorrow, too tired now :3
---
Fallout is a game that appeals to multiple audiences. All creation engine games are.
---
One of these audiences is the min maxer crowd, which is a subset of all players 
---
Ditch the ability to develop high damage builds (through hard work and painful compromises) and they won’t play the game. 
---
Thats what I was about to say
---
If it does delete the first bag upon the 2nd death, so what? I cant think of another game that leaves the first batch of loot if you die a second time. Most either have you lose something full stop, lose something but can try to get it back, if you fail (ie take to long or die again) you lose it, or you dont lose anything at all.
---
Yep, pretty much that. I've hovered roughly between 1200 and 2200 atoms for a long time now, buying a few &lt;=600 atom items every so often.
---
Yeah that's the one. Walked into that church and found it sitting at the front right pew. If it is a random spawn I'd just check it every now and then when you past the town maybe
---
3k if you're on pc. Ign lgeo

Well you got the mass duped one sadly, I have one too as well as a few thousand others
---
I love Fallout 3 and 4 but I may have put in more hours already. I feel like I’ve searched and discovered so much and still don’t get tired wandering. 
---
Same as slap dmg? Let them waste 1000 bullets to break a wooden wall. Fine with me.
---
100% confirmed. Friend and I made it all down there w/o code. This one works
---
Sounds good thanks, been following the subreddit for awhile and read guides but have never played and only seen little gameplay so I'm kinda fresh towards the game. I'll be learning tn though!
---
I have died 20-30 times facing big enemies when I was lower level and my loot was still there. The only time I lost my loot was if I disconnected from the server OR if I picked up something else before getting my bag back. The second you die with new junk and haven't picked up the old one the old one disappears.
---
Makes sense, I definitely prefer unyielding myself. Not a huge fan of the unarmed weapons though just traded a bloodied ss DC gauntlet for grog axe pretty fun times
---
Let’s say this, you meet a level 60 when you’re level 20. You die, due to the stroke of bad luck, and the high level enemy won’t leave, you have no way to get it back. For no better reason than a weird spawn. And that’s why you lose all the junk you’re carrying? A little extreme. And to answer that, I know ARK leaves multiple death bags, 7 Days to Die, etc, so that other games part is incorrect
---
Food degreades over time and turns into spoiled vegetables/fruit/meat
---
Think I'm gonna try getting wanted and play a game of hide and seek on the roof of the Greenbrier with chameleon on. XD
---
Well this is good news right?
---
I grew up in Berkeley Springs, and they also did a great job of recreating it as well. 
---
They're never going to devote resources to some guy who accidentally dropped something, it'll teach you to be careful and that actions have consequences.

I just finished a SBQ battle. I'm strong a crit speced level 90+ character using both an Explosive Double Barrel and Executioners Automatic Handmade (perked to Auto) and I'm sad to say I made little noticable difference. We brought her down but not necessarily because of my contabution.

Issue: Lately, seems after recent update, the " danger " alert has been getting stuck, which during more than 1 gameplay it was for over an hour. No matter where I was, or was doing.  When this happens, healing mutation doesn't work and all enemies instantly spot and come after you.
---
I appreciate your time :)
---
I meant what i said.
---
Turrets have enough terrible with environmental move. They are absolutely no challenge to even modestly leveled players. 
---
Hey dude no offense taken!   I was just trying to justify my post is all.

I'll keep an eye out for more duplicate posts like this over the next few days.  Hopefully there won't be any.  That way you won't have to look at them and I'll be right! hahaha

cooked /raw food rots if you don't eat it. If you don't want to worry about food spoiling you can get a luck perk called can do that lets you hit a button to search garbage cans and coolers for a chance to find canned food that doesn't spoil
---
Did you hide in the shed? People who hide in the shed and don't help a lot in the SBQ fight tend to become targets.
---
Otherwise, sounds like Raiders to me.
---
Every other respectable MMO I’ve every played has replaced accidentally lost or dropped items with a limit of course. Accidents happen. And it’s not just accidentally dropping something...it’s a glitch on their end for the paper bags not appearing. They should replace lost items due to something that is their fault 
---
Sorry bloodied + swing speed death claw gauntlet
---
I'm so stupid 😂😂😂 I thought it was just uncooked food that went bad. It all makes sense now. I have no clue how I'm a lvl 83 and didn't know that
---
Oh my lord why are plans for crafting REGULAR raider armor so impossible to find? I spent a week looking ive given up. All i want to do is look cool.
---

Some glitches are fun and harmless, sounds like this is one of them.
---
Happened yesterday had to close the app and restart it I recommend waiting a little while before doing  much of anything to be safe
---
I did not hide in the shed my friend.  Three of us took her down.  Everyone contributed.
---
Lunarknight666 add me when I'm on I'm always down to group or play! I'm on often :)
---
That's fair, but you have to also consider the casual crowd, opposite of yourself. If the causal game isn't balanced, it's not as enjoyable for that crowd. If min/maxers wanna have ways to get tons of damage that's, fine. But the core weapons should be balanced, from which then you can sky rocket your damage in different ways if you dedicate time to it.
---
At the core heavy weapons are not up to par with melee and rifles, etc. Ignore drugs, legendary effects or whatever. A rifle/pistol vats/stealth build or melee build will out class a heavy build almost every time.
---
They have a whole lot more on their plate at the moment. Paper bags aren't meant to be the way to transfer valuable goods, and if you are going to, drop a bullet in there first and then transfer into the bag.
---
It's alright
---
A timeless classic
---
That's a brilliant use of what is otherwise a borked VATS system.  Maybe they can allow each individual player to set whether VATS targets non-hostiles in Pacifist Mode, so you could keep that tactic.
---
This is what I love about Fallout 76, they let us build wherever we want, with few exceptions, it allows for so much creativity.
---
the original fallouts: 1/2/tactics are still my favorites. I was hesitant to play or enjoy the first person versions(i hear vegas is good, only played 4 to completion), i definitely like this more than f4 for longevity, and especially if/when they add more content and endgame.
---
a good side effect to get is 50% less fall damage if you have 2 pieces of armor with it you can jump off anything and be fine
---
Raiders then, Raiders never change...
---
I replied to a post down the thread but I think this applies to the main thread still...
---
 Can we extend the slap mechanic to c.a.m.p.s?
---
 If it took as much ammo to take out a SBQ (no stacked bobbleheads) to destroy the average camp of a pacifist mode player AND pacifist was only accessible from the main menu it would solve so much.
---
My only ask for the Atomic Shop is a bunch of good hair options. The ones they have now are super underwhelming.
---
Certainly! I’d be honored!
---
Seeded RNG makes so much sense. I'm level 125. I have looted hundreds, maybe over a thousand legendaries from golf course, watoga, and nukes and I have never seen a 2shot or an explosive. I could even count the amount of 3 star legendaries I've found on one hand. 
---
Yeah kill the scorched they spawn will trigger a landing also.  
---
I'm on PS4 sadly
---
Found mine at Grafton Station 10 mins before the New Year came in. From what I've been told, they are level locked to players above level 55. Was level 67 myself when I got them myself.
---
Yeah or when you're doing literally ANY mission involving an NPC escort or friendly turrets and Gun Fu keeps swapping you to the friendlies you're supposed to be protecting and you accidentally destroy them yourself.
---
Gun Fu should ignore non hostile targets completely.
---
VATS should have a settings menu toggle to make it only lock on to non hostile targets if they're manually targeted and then VATS is pressed.
---
Will definitely stop by if I see you online at the same time. Game needs more general trade, I gave it up long ago but I will happilly be a customer.
---
It’s happened twice, it’s not the quest marker problem where it’s only on the most recent bag and I have not disconnected or been away too long. If it’s not the bug it’s an undocumented change that is very weird
---
Farting should temporarily pull you out of stealth.
---
I literally only use my flamer for friendly fire healing with my friends
---
What the fuck? by your logic most game are trash after 6-20hours. I have been playing Fo76 for 350hours and i still didnt find best build. I think nobody find top build. Min/max bitch! :D
---
I’ll make sure to tag you when it’s posted!! 
---
Probably closer to Tommy and Henry selling bootleg cigarettes in *GoodFellas.* It’s still the real deal with the same effect, just obtained through nefarious means. 
---
Is an anti-armor minigun really worse? It benefits from it so much more than the gatling gun
---
Awesome! Cant wait for your business!
---
I didn’t imply that they were a means of dropping valuable items and I definitely agree they have plenty more on their plate atm given the current state of the game. But paper bags not appearing still isn’t a game issue that needs to be addressed. But my point of the original comment was if they can’t replace said dropped item when given an exact date, time and location of player I don’t see them being able to track down the thousands of duped items that are now spread across almost every players inventory whether they are the actual duper or a player that received one unknowingly. 
---
You must not get to the cloud district very often then. 
---
Okay
---
That’s fair, I’ll absolutely grant that. 
---
If you stretch a continuum from mechanics (such as a weapon, or a weapon+perk combo or bigger more involved combinations) not everything has to be readily available to a player, casual or not, that just walked out the Valult 76 door for the first time. 
---
So they let you drive a PA frame, but you won’t use armor pieces on it until level 15.
---
You may find a low level automatic rifle you can use but ammo won’t become abundant until later. 
---
You can find a rad suit and walk over to join an SBQ fight, but you’ll probably get killed many times and will likely not even be able to deal enough damage to her to tag her. 
---
The point is that neither the most casual nor the most technical are isolated universes. They’re a continuum of development everyone is invited to walk, at their own desired pace, and just because a specific player, say my grandma, will never become super-min-maxer, that doesn’t mean she needs to be showered with weapons that sport end game efficacy. 
---
Chances are that the issue you’re raising has less to do with ineffective weapons, and more to do with people taking effective weapons for their level to places with more leveled enemies on which these are not effective. 
---
Simple solution, don't die.
---
Guy said offer him 10k and above and offered him 14k
---
Same with Xbox. Had this happen like 3 times in a row before I learned my lesson. I just stand still until I can hear the radio. 
---
I haven't died since I fell in a fissure about 40 levels ago so I wouldn't really notice, but you can probably send in a report to  Bethesda at the least. Hopefully if anyone else has noticed they post in this thread.
---
Screenshots of the lost parts or I am calling bullshit.
---
Hey does empathy stack?
---
I said" I cant think of any" and "most". I figured there were some out there that did. I just didnt know them. I mean hell there are games even that dont even have you die.   
---
I play sniper most of the time just for that reason. i sneak and head shot as much as i can. had a pistol for backup until I got the enforcer perk now I kneecap the overly powerful mobs with a shotgun and keep my loot.Though as I get nearer to 50 they are less overly powerful as much as swarming when they become an issue. so again out comes the shotgun.
---
 If you are the type that goes in gun a blazing or hammer swinging good for you but that has consequences. 
---
Not sure where he got it from but he said he only had one! 
---
Nope. Works correctly for me every time, from 1 to the max items, never going to either 0 or wrapping around.
---
I guess being a lower level I probably die much more and experience more than others on here would. Thanks for not being negative like most here lol
---
Also I'm not sure the golfer ghouls part is correct. I'm not sure how it works. But I've got a camp by the course, and I visit there when no other players are there. The golf course itself will be full of lvl40 gangrenous or high level charred ghouls with no golfers. But the storage area  next to the resort with the laundry room will sometimes have low level golfers alongside high level charred ghouls.
---
It would probably come down to some unique item ID on the back end, otherwise they would just check for stacks of identical weapons or large amounts of bulk/bobbles/etc. It absolutely wouldn't be a precise method, but it could get the job done within reason.
---
Main thing would just be adjusting parameters so that there aren't any innocent casualties (if someone has 10 of the same TSE gun, whether or not they duped it they are guilty).
---
Also they need to change the LMG over to 5mm ammo because it using .308 with such low damage and high fire rate is ridiculous. .308 is doing 80 damage in a hunting rifle but put it in a LMG and it's doing 16 damage? No, just use 5mm so I can craft it in chunks of 140 instead of 16.
---
This looks really great! Some comments about CAMP size limit confuse me, though. I have a large house with two stories, a walkway to a bedroom and a tall platform with an umbrella table on it, along with a lead extractor, three turrets, two medium generators, a windmill, a garden and a bunch of decorative stuff, and I have roughly 10% free space.
---
I'm only level 28, so it can't have gotten to be this... Lenient from my levelling.
---
Maybe I'm just having a bug. My place isn't very pretty imo, but it's obscenely large.
---
I agree with you. This along with no new content since launch are the most frustrating things about the game. Theres a ton of potential but it seems they just dont care as long as you spend those atoms. 
---
I want to be wise as you master. Why do i debate until i am completly mad about how people are ignorants? Learn me your ways!
---
Let’s go raid some, all I have is this chrome car paint that tastes like peppermint 
---
He lied! That's what they all say to get you to buy it. I literally have the same gun down to the receiver that came on it. 
---
Check xbox lfg or trade forums... you'll see it. Also there's a quad explosive 90% reduced weight starting to float around.
---
Just used it on pvp it definitely has range and accuracy but probably be best used for sneaking and hunting wanted player from long rang 
---
This is how fallout 4 was for me when I was down town, I'm glad other people get to have this experience, especially someone who would never play a game
---
Does anyone know if the First Aid perk boosts Vampire? 
---
Only thing that is fucking awesome about this game, is the free world. I hated Borderlands were more like maps you must run thru with only 1-3ways. Same in Diablo 3 and million other games. FO76 is exactly what i was waiting for.
---
Tinfoil hat time: It's an entropy method. You need to cook certain important items using boiled water, so everyone will need to gather dirty water in order to cook food. Just collecting Dirty Water imparts about 5 rads (IIRC). This means every time you cook an item you're "using up" at least 10 rads (because you need two boiled waters IIRC). This accumulates over time and forces people to use either Rad-X, Radaway or other materials. This helps put those materials out of the economy and prevent build up. As more anti-radiation drugs get used up, they become (relatively) more scarce, which means jumping into high-radiation areas isn't always a "without thinking" issue.
---
Essentially, similar to how you need to repair weapons/armor. Ofc just a conspiracy theory.
---
It was pretty good in Fallout 3 and NV also. I remember fearing enemies who had them.
---
&gt;-Two Shot:
---
&gt;Weapons shoot perfectly normally when you aim down the sights, but if used in VATS you can see the bullets bounce off each other into different directions. The 95% accuracy being displayed is a lie as you can only hit about 25% of the time in VATS with a two shot rifle. (Reported by mitchisawesome)
---
god, this do much. i use vats all the time, but after experiencing useless VATS with my TS pipe rifle, i switched back to my hunting rifle even though it has much lower damage
---
I only have clothes or leaded leather armor ( so I can cannibalize ghouls in nuke zone) if I'm in pa, but I have a set in my stash. Ready to pull out if I am low on cores
---
A Player in a team for a SBQ fight hits someone base
---
we all go wanted ? 
---
I am in pacifist mode, I hate pvp and never engage
---
I must have gone wanted! with doing nothing as next I am 1-shotted
---
I lose hundreds of mats, for being in same ghroup and someone else messed up ?
---
WTH is this PvP crap ?
---
someone asked for this ?
---
Argh !!!
---
FIX IT!
---
I did nothing and lost
---
a fortune !
---
J
---
The grinding aspect of a game is pointless if you can eliminate it wi tg h a few quick commands. Also the fact that to get some of the best weapons in the game you cant just Google search it and go to the spot that has it and bam gg.
---
Fallout 4 &amp; 76 are literally the 1st Xbox games Ive played. When people use the emotes to me by the time I remember how to do emotes back they're long gone ☺️
---
I'll be honest, I was kind of hoping that no one would respond to this, just to make it look like no one was here.
---
Nice
---
I have to completely agree I love this game have over a hundred and fifty hours into it and I haven't touched it in 2 weeks at this point there's nothing left for me to do so until they fix it and add more I'm off to a monster hunter
---
Go south from Vault 76 near lumberjack place is small lake, on left side is RANDOM spawn of critkets (or how to spell it) Server hop there until you get squirrel. You can get there spawn of house cats too. Idk if you can tame tho, let me know later. (I use this place for killing daily challenges)
---
rule 34 mate, go wank one out to clear your head *then* see how you'll feel about it afterwards
---
you'll either accept it or become really disappointed in yourself
---
Same here. Level 70 and I have never found anything in any of them.
---
Yup he just posted same ad again 
---
Its the pied piper random spawn
---
Perhaps the next Romeo and Juliet
---
I have quad +50% limb damage, and i struggle killing 68 super muties. Cant oneshot those bastards even to head. With explosive you probably dont have this problem.
---
Was it xbox though? From what I've seen on trade forums, xbox got fucked the hardest by duping. TSE handmades were selling for 2000 caps weeks ago
---
Last I read about it people were thinking that it stopped spawning in vendors at about lvl 25
---
Fk, i would kill for psycho
---
People will shoot you, and kill you.
---
Maybe it's best to accept that from this same moment.
---
I don't know... the community so far seems to be pretty awesome. I think most times it would work out and the times it doesn't would be few and far between. I've seen a surprising amount of cooperation in 76.
---
If you think thats bad then dont watch YongYea.
---
nooo with curent state i need like 25agility to equip all perks i want lol
---
Yea, if someone has 10 of the same TSE it’s pretty safe to say they knew they were receiving duped items. The huge amounts of bobbles, mags, etc is a dead give away. I don’t have an issue with them doing something about the dupers or those with many multiples of the same god weapons/armor. It’s the people that traded for or bought one that will end up screwed since there is no real way of the average player knowing if it’s a duped item or it was gotten legitimately. The entire situation just sucks. 
---
They should just make it so Q is Enemy only Vats, and Shift+Q is Vats but including friendlies. 
---
Add a toggle in Settings to flip them, and done.
---
The MG42 felt useless to me till I found one with a decent legendary to make up for it's shortcomings. I got one that ramps damage over consecutive hits and that made it easily as good for knockdown as my two shot gatling. You can drop most enemies with a quick burst, whole low level mobs even. Without the right legendary mods though it's empty before you can even drop most enemies above level 40.
---
What kind of "player driven story mission?" Do you mean raiding?
---
Balance in Fallout 76 is non-existent.
---
And don't expect a fix any time soon.
---
One bit of advice common to this thread: go strength and melee and (at least for now) power armor.
---
But, if you say no to that then I have advice that I haven’t seen elsewhere in this thread: at level 29 (?) you will get access to Four Leaf Clover as a luck perk.  If you take 3 ranks of that, and attack things in VATS at very close range with a shotgun holding down the critical attack key, you’ll do quite a bit of damage.  (bonus for using Concentrated Fire to target the head or whatever is vulnerable for that kind of enemy).  The idea is that shotguns fire 8 (?) pellets and so count as 8 hits for critical bar increase (if they all hit), so you’ll refill critical every couple shots.  I think that’s for me about when mole men (and thus much of the Ash Heap) went from Problem to Not-A-Problem.  At 40 I’m now able to hang out with the big kids in Watoga.
---
I found a quad magazine one. Didnt even pick it up.
---
That's why I always have my mic ready. I usually just tell people no thanks instead of searching for an emote.
---
Usually both. 
---
Well what I meant was if someone only had one or two of any given weapon, they'd basically get out of it. They've already been banning based upon mass crafting from the last dupe glitch, so that would thin it down even further. Any who still have tons of duped crap know what it is and would deserve it (again, not if they have 1 of a gun, but if they have stacks, or 1000+ bobbleheads or plans etc)
---
Good info, I've only got it to stop after killing the initial target, it's made me use VATS less and less..
---
Good find. Could easily even get up to 30-40k with people getting crazy about getting their hands on a OP hunting rifle
---
Yeah and the free states people killed the non-feral ghouls.
---
Everthing is tax free
---
When a player higher level than you gets close to an area it spawns enemies there appropriate for their level and not yours 
---
I'm on XB so I can't help with teaming up, but do get a mic. It makes it so much easier to play with others.
---
This reminds me of that „rick and morty“ season with the sex robot 
---
Is this game still shitty
---
Sometimes he gives you watches and lockets. Then I kill him, steel runs through my fingers like water
---
I do that all the time (Reddit on my phone while cooking or doing dishes...) one of these days I'm going to burn something and my wife will kill me!
---
dont you mean pEYEd piper?.....I'll see my self out.
---
Oh damn, not only duping but let. You should report their Reddit and console username
---
Its really nice to see someone enjoy the small things in a game👌🏻
---
Already got my headset and mic plugged in
---
Happened to me the other day 
---
Do the Patrol Duty even at the prison.  You can do it multiple times a day, but you'll have to server hop to get it to trigger sometimes.  At certain times of the day it took me 5 or 6 server hops to get it, at other times, only 2.  Walk to the front door and if you don't get the warden voice over telling you to report to him for patrol duty then change servers.  It took me 6 tries to get the plans.  I've read of other people getting them in 2-3 tries and one guy told me it took him 14 tries.  The event takes 15-20 minutes and is easy with low level super mutants/scorched.  If there's a good side to taking so many tries to get the plans I did pick up two other plans that I didn't have.  The reward is always a weapon plan.  The ones I got were: Sub-machine gun, laser gun, single action revolver, one that I forget and the handmade plans in the end.
---
I hit him whenever I need gears
---
I get some of the salt...  
---
Hell they won't respond to the offered of Paints for the raider armor / power armor, which is my favorite, but give us Pink Castle beds and hats I think are silly, but what do I know right?
---
It's happened about 3 or 4 times tonight so far.
---
I'm games like ark you can fast travel but cant take stuff with you across the map, I'm sure its gonna go that direction if there's better looting but if not I'd say they'll jus remove the slap damage and let ppl go.. only time will tell
---
People bored and wanting someone to try to take it over so they can PvP
---
Wallace is the best part of 76 change my mind 
---
But they didn't kill him. They blew themselves up. Lol
---
Maybe I missed it, but the 'Speed Freak' mutation can still be bugged to not give any positives but still have the negative debuffs to food/water. 
---
It won't show normally under 'effects' tab unless you move, then briefly you'll see the debuffs pop up. Taking Rad-X shows 'Speed freak' being supressed, but after Rad-X wears off it disappears again. Speed of walking and reloads are the same suppressed or not.
---
My character has this and since there's no way to clear specific mutations I'm kinda stuck with it. Should be added to the list.
---
Same thing happens to me frequently. Either that or my character looks like he just has underwear on.
---
Good info, had not considered it, but would explain why I'm always hungry and thirsty.  will have to test in game!
---
I would vote flatwoods instead. since it cannot be nuked if people start gathering.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
I mentioned the killed creature doing that, but will edit t include the "moved of killed", thanks!
---
well I had my level 19 friend with me the entire time and he couldn't get the plans either :(
---
Ah forgot that one, thanks!
---
Same PS4 It happened week ago, but it was only one kind of flowers, so i picket the rest of them and completed. This time i have only 7kinds to picks and need 8.
---
I seen him on the first day of beta but never again.
---
Raider noob lol
---
How about instead of the ridiculous crap like a FNAF themed power armor skin or pajamas, let's get something the community actually asked for like outfits based on previous games. Desert ranger armor,  tunnel snakes jacket, winterized combat/power armor, the chinese stealth suit (with or without the magical curve-enhancing technology), legion outfits, benny's suit, joshua graham's clothes, ulysses's duster, vera's gown....anything? Can somebody honestly tell me they would rather have the stuff we have now instead of any of that?
---
Hell, there are plenty of other simple things too. Universal weapon skins, universal power armor skins, recolors of existing skins...some of these are extremely easy and low effort and yet people would love them. Come on, what's going on over in the microtransaction department?
---
Share the perk strange mutations it does unless they patched it. I stopped playing awhile back so I cant tell you.
---
This happens to me way too much. And every time I think “WHY?”
---
Some people seem to have unusually high or low RNG's, it seems to be moderately consistent (the high rollers have off days, but fewer than the rest of us), sorry you seem to be on the low end of the curve.
---
I just went to Berkeley springs and grabbed the one on top of the hair salon every day until I learned all the mods.
---
Yea, that's what I often see. This is different than that as you see absolutely nothing. Also, my teammate will sometimes see a half-naked "dummy" version of my player somewhere else that stands motionless. It's kind of like for my teammate the game still thinks my character model is somewhere else.
---
rotten luck :(
---
Half a reload dude, and that's at 200% with luck of the draw 3 
---
some players have been creating bases and having a huge bounty (kind of like a super boss) for players to try and kill them. Usually the hunters honor the rules like no one hit weapons or the "Henchmen" on his team will one hit you. Some players took it into their own hands to create endgame bounty hunts
---
Sorry to say, no offence, but you are noob with not good gear for PvP, thats why you get oneshoted.
---
Tested the ghouls one extensively (the low level quest related one).  
---
If your the only one there, spawning them in @ the max for your level (above 60) you won't see the lower level ghouls. 
---
This would be incredible. Imagine if we could join factions with mutants, ghouls, or other similar things and create towns with them? That would be a fun way to rebuild Appalachia 
---
The two shot effect seems to work very well outside of VATS...
---
Make them decay faster. All you need to do 
---
Selling pirated music/movies
---
Thanks for the feedback!  
---
It sucks putting it all together, but I love the game in an oddly Stockholm'esk way, and the best way to improve it is, well, helping run the stuff down.
---
Light, Medium or Heavy Variant?
---
not a bad idea. now to find a good source of 556 that doesn't take hours to make...
---
Game ate all my Power Armor mods while decorating my base.  Apparently there is a glitch to where you run out of materials and it starts using your stored mods instead!  Wonderful! 
---
Why not both?
---
Exactly.
---
BTW what platform are you on?  
---
I'm a raider by nature, rocking full raider armor under my raider power armor at level 315, and I've got to hook my fellow raiders up!
---
It depends on the kind of radiation, really.  Most alpha-emitters you’d find as a byproduct of a U235 decay would show up in water as a sediment, so if you were to set up an ad hoc alembic (say, by sealing two bottles opening to opening with one side holding the dirty water being boiled and the other cooled enough to collect the condensed steam), you could purify some amount of radiation through boiling alone.
---
Of course, you could also make a gravity-powered charcoal filter with a large plastic bottle: cut off the bottom, put something like a coffee filter at the neck, and then layer finely ground/powdered charcoal and varying coarseness of sand in the bottle, setting the finest at the bottom and the coarsest at the top.  A little weird that *that* in-game recipe makes purified water when realistically, it’d be as pure as the boiled stuff I described, but, whatever.
---
Just as with alpha-emitters, most beta-emitters coming out of a U235 reaction could likely be removed by boiling or filtration, but I don’t know which would be better off the top of my head.  Something as thin as a sheet of paper can do a lot to block alpha radiation (since it’s basically helium nuclei), but for (obvious reasons) an electron moving at an appreciable fraction of the speed of light has a bit more penetrating power.
---
I’m not sure what the best call for a neutron emitter would be since hydrogen is the best neutron-absorbing material out there.  Maybe you’d just be screwed.
---
And, if you’re worried about gamma-emitters, chances are you’re close enough in time to the nuclear blast that radioactive dust from the fallout is still an *airborne* issue to contend with.  Of all the outcomes of a nuclear reaction, the emission of 2 photons tends to be the shortest lived—which makes sense, if you think about it: an atom that’s able to make itself more stable by shedding energy alone is probably going to get about doing that a lot faster than the atom that has to shake apart into pieces.
---
*****
---
If you can get past the statistics, nuclear chemistry is pretty fun.  I love that it’s basically built around the principle that if you smack an atom hard enough (or soft enough, in the case of something like a U235/n reaction), something interesting happens.
---
I'm pretty jazzed on the chandelier, too.  I love mid-century decor and modern art.
---
Same. In every FO game I’ve played seeing a Deathclaw in the distance was a huge event for me. Having to fall back, assess my inventory, spot some high ground, and prepare for an epic fight made these such intense and genuinely scary enemies. I mean... it’s a Deathclaw!!! But in this game I bowl over every one I see. Tonight I actually killed a Matriarch Deathclaw with three shots. Very inconsistent with lore and really disappointing all around.
---
Clown suits are always dirty, even if they just came out of the washing machine.
---
It’s mind boggling how all we get are ugly PA paints and hats with updates 
---
But annoyances likes sliders flipping from 0 to 24999 and dropping weapons or disappearing armor stays - and (for some) connectivity and game stability has taken a nose dive 
---
And Bethesda is like: „*But let’s get PvP content first, because that’s what EVERYONE wants and loves the most!“*
---
Lucky Hole Mine with Excavator PA (gives you 4x scrap out of veins). Came out with 360 Lead Ore. 2 ore = 5 lead scrap. 900 total. 
---
They hired people to record holotapes just fine. 
---
It only happens to me when we fast travel to fast after one another so we just wait till we load in properly now 
---
The gatling gun should've been the one using . 308
---
I was in the same boat...seems like 20's and 30's it was easier to find myself in places where a high level would spawn some tough enemies.  One thing that was a big eye opener for me was to realize I needed to upgrade my weapons...was using a level 5 hunting sniper rifle for the longest time.  Now in the 40's with level 40 weapons and armor, seems like I can stand up to more higher level enemies.  Also check your perks.  I'm building a sneaky sniper so I've been boosting the perks for that (rifleman, bloody mess, sneak attack multiplier).  I almost always am sneaking so the 2.5x multiplier is a big help.  Another thing that helped me was getting the .50 cal conversion for the hunting rifle....crafting .50 cal is super cheap so I never run out of ammo for that one.
---
A little work on item organization and a better save system and it's already fixed all my problems with it.
---
Hell my main issue is not being able to play passed 60 hours without hard crashes every 5 minutes.
---
I believe they are balancing them next patch as they said from inside the vault was to reduce TS and E both by 75%.
---
With PA is stealth much harder. On melee u will be ok. Rifles are, uhm, without stealth modifier / TSE weapon it does like no damage in endgame. But you have to try yourself.
---
Ammosmith and Super Duper perks help out tremendously.  Chemist also applies to making gunpowder.  I'm always stockpiling lead and steel, even if I have 2000+ rounds.
---
I was just farming whiteaprings with ya bud 
---
I don't like the fact you cant see the hair on the character models with a bunch of headgear.
---
Knowing Bethesda is prone to typos, you may want to try loading your gun up with ultracite .45 ammo 
---
Maybe it works 
---
Your locked doors stop no one who wants to destroy stuff. They'll just break the doors and walls like they were planning on doing anyway. 
---
If you don't hit level 44 yet, try to check all the different faction bots to see if you can get the handmade plans. If you could make enough of them and scrap em to learn mods, you can make a decent rifle that way. Otherwise, and it's harder to do now, but killing level 3 legendaries could potentially drop a 2 shot explosive weapon - the dragon/ 50 cal/ grenade launcher being the best
---
Deuterium is H2, not H3.  The latter is tritium.
---
You can filter out H2 and H3 from normal H with a centrifuge and careful filtration, but if you’re pumping in enough energy to boil water, the steam will carry all three fairly indiscriminately.
---
Radioactive dust dissolved into the water, on the other hand...yeah.  You could probably take a chunk out of contaminated water’s radioactive content that way.
---
He must be from enclave. We kill only lowbies with bounty on them, bcos they have no chance and we are not brave. All we need is psycho. Do you have any tin can man?
---
This belongs in the "missed connections" section of craigslist.
---
My overuse of crits in fo4 kinda forced me into a bloodied melee build but then again I need something to shoot shit down. Had a guy chasing a cargobot screaming “does anyone have a sniper rifle!?” Laughed my ass off and shot it down.
---
Unless a new one came out, that bug was fixed since like... the first patch
---
We need better examples of what shit looks like too.
---
I bought the new chandelier... all excited for it cuz it looked big and fancy... shit is way too small.
---
👀👀 gonna have to through there later tonight, thank you! 😁
---
I think you must check this page. You'll get a few suggestions from [here](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/240053-fallout-76/77273052?page=1).
---
Yep I got killed while wanted today...I had the drop on the guy clearly running to me to melee me ...shot him enough times to kill him 10 times over then boom one shot death cause I'm just doin slap damage ..its pretty wack
---
Or go take over the abandoned munitions factory, build walls in front of all the doors and let it run
---
I always sell low level legendaries at low level area so new player can buy it for their usage. Instead of selling a lvl 50 gear which will occupied their stash after a while. 
---
Good riddance I say, Bethesda should go after these Youtubers just like Rockstar did with their cheating/hacking scum. Copyright strike every single last 76 dupe/glitch/hack video and overrun their channels with strikes forcing them resign as a youtuber. This person does not deserve to be a content creator for any game, his viewer base is toxic for any gaming community.
---
It's a shame that was a limited time item, it was arguably the only good skin so far. It seemed to be one of if not the most popular on here, and if I had to choose any one item to keep it would definitely be that
---
I bought a two shot laser rifle one week after launch. Since then, it's at my mule.
---
It's implied that she is a personality imprint of an actual person named Rose. Rose died and either the boyfriend survived and imprinted her personality onto the robot on holotapes or the robot found the holotapes and assumed the personality - that's what I got out of the scattered notes and tapes anyway.
---
Yeah I was using a level 5 as well until level 30 haha. I have no issues now that they are upgraded but I have not found a mod for 50 cal. and I have dismantled hundreds of hunting rifles so is it a plan I need to find? All my perks are set pretty well, all ammo, guns and resistance. Couple good mutations as well.
---
It'll be better in the sense they won't be doing enough damage to one shot you. I'm hoping there will be no chip damage in the new pvp mode. 
---
LOL.  The same thing happens to me.  It's highly annoying.
---
At the very least, give us an option in our settings to turn player/friendly targeting on or off, like pacifist mode.  If you really want to shoot a whtesprings robot, you can still do it manually.
---
Also, I wish car health was like 4x stronger than it is now.  Even with my armor piercing handmade rifle, cars are exploding everywhere with a stray bullet or two while tracking a moving ghoul.
---
You know you can preview Atomic Shop CAMP items in-game right? They pop up just like any plans you haven't learned. So as long as you don't set it to only show you items you can build, you should be able to preview those items, and even unlock them from workshop mode. I'm looking at the ceiling fan right now.
---
(And yeah, that shit is too small.)
---
Love it, solid write up... But I have one question.   
---
**What about extortion / tolls? ** 
---
I'd love to see an effective way to trap and extort players, not to the point of rage quitting, but truely wasteland level "taxing" for breathing my air..
---
Thanks for the heads up! I don't know who is downvoting you. I suppose it's just someone who really likes TSE weapons.
---
Bought mine at watoga station 
---
Whenever my CAMP is getting attacked. I just hop servers immediately. 
---
Once you partake in it enough, it all becomes the same, all too predictable and more annoying than anything else. At that point it becomes much easier to ask yourself if it's really worth it
---
Cheers.
---
No problem OP, most likely but its best that everyone prepares for the changes comming. 
---
Ign braingler we've traded before. Ive been trying to just get some plans for ANY variant to learn some mods. I personally like the medium arms and heavy chest look
---
are all the limbs separate and do you happen to remember the names of them exactly?
---
"15.  Increase the freaking budget already, I’ll pay atoms for that"
---
Some people think this will be P2W. I dunno why
---
I've seen 4 no stars and 1 3\* in the 500 hours I've played
---
There’s a decent bit of npcs but the biggest issue is the lack of character for them and the lack of dialogue/interaction. They are literally having a monologue since you have no voice or choice of your own.
---
Tested with my friend tonight, dropped an orbital strike on him and it did nothing. 
---
Every time I invite someone to my team or leave a team it removes all good effects of mutations for about 5 minutes so it might be doing that to you too. 
---
I think so. Because I can only mod my chest piece only
---
I STASH my armor.  In fact, I wear my Vault Suit under my PA, so that when I'm not in it, other players know I'm not interested in PvP.
---
Today on PS4 I lasted 30 seconds before lock up restarted almost got killed before it let me even move, then I could run but not go anything else then suddenly I could go to map and then finally could access pip to get a weapon lost almost all my armor to a scorchbeast
---
There is a comouter on the overhang in the control room you have to use. Not the targeting computer or keypad or card mqchine. It is on the overhang above it. Click on the computer and click initiate launch prep.
---
thanks!
---
The game let me have one on my birthday, I hope I just got lucky and Bathesda isn't stalking me.
---
well as a sniper, if enemies get in close, NOT using VATS doesn't work that well
---
1% chance that the bullets jam and the gun blows up in your face insta killing you.
---
Whenever I claim a work bench with a fusion core resource (usually Posiedon) I leave it unlocked.  Feel free to stop by on PC.  My in game username is the same is my Reddit ( I am not very creative with names).
---
Thanks for letting me know, Im gonna check it out for myself.
---
I swear to god I hear them begging to die when they’re sprinting at me. It kills me to kill them.

At least, not since *the incident.* MODUS kinda killed off all of the assholes. 
---
I've seen quite a few, they aren't really rare. There's almost always one in scorched horde event. If you get the quest to clear Civic center there's usually one there. 
---
I found their walking radius since tied to the feeder is abit long. Best thing to do is to place it in an open area for them.
---
And how do you do this on the PS4 version? Honestly,  it's just bizarre that people only think the game is PC. 
---
r/Showerthoughts
---
Albino scorched, chameleon king or something unique that would be cool for another endgame style enemy that would spawn on a nuked zone. Other endgame boss-like enemies would make nuke locations more broad. I only see 3 locations nukes still, kinda stale after a while.
---
I love my Gatling Gun and .50 Cal, good at long range too, if you go heavy weapons make sure you use the Stabilised perk in Int 
---
Ive seen him 3x this week. Twice last week. Its not that rare. 
---
Don't know if you noticed, but if you select the challenge, you need to collect 10 of different types of flowers.
---
It’s a known bug that happens when you both enter through the same door at the same time 
---
The game seems to have problem loading two or more peoples gear at the same time - this is a fatal problem with the game engine coding itself 
---
A few Modders that made „oblivion online“ (and got sued) back in 2003 discovered this and advised to wait for 3 seconds before loading into the same cell
---
They aren't balancing TSE they're nerfing TS and E weapons, most of which are far from being OP.
---
TSE are still going to be the most OP guns in the game. Bethesda punished non dupers with 1* and 2* legendaries instead of the dupers.
---
Upvote because you shouldn't kill the messenger 
---
Am I the only person who absolutely appreciate the absense of human NPCs in here?
---
Sometimes we need a different kind of game environment. Failed Bethesda's intention or not, we are supposed to interact with other players rather than mindless script driven unkillable stupid NPCs. 
---
On PC? dm me you GT I’d love to see this lol
---
Nope! I wish it did.  It should, IMO
---
Done? I never even started. 
---
I guess if you do the Scorched horde event you'll see them fairly often, but I haven't really bother with those events much, and outside of those events, legendary scorched are almost non-existent.
---
TheQuartering is an alt-right twat, and he was banned for harassing several MtG players. Fuck that human trash.
---
Pc yes Chazcon 
---
What levels do you get these perks? 
---
Where is this on the map? 
---
Yes, sprint and run are different things.
---
C’MON BESSY YOU CAN DO IT
---
As far as permanent perks go i'd make the system like Skyrim where just doing something gains you exp toward that skill. Skills will still be level locked so you can't just run to morgan town and grab the PA and start leveling the PA perks.
---
Like Twinks in low level BGs in WoW.  Sure a few of them claim to do it for the challenge of who can build the best Twink, but the vast majority of them cried when Blizzard starting giving EXP for BGs and if you disabled EXP gain you were put into a separate BG queue (that was essentially only twinks).  Thus removing their ability to 1 or 2 shot everyone else playing in that bracket while having 4 or 5 times the health of a normal character that level.
---
Found mods only at Welch today after server hopping 6 hours straight. No plans though. Guess I’ll head to Watoga
---
What was his gamer tag
---
Thanks for the suggestions! a question if you dont mind :)
---
how does the heavy g. work with ammo? picked up a power armor and a .50 mg just to try it out. Think I had to spend like 300-400 rounds if not more just to kill 3 spawnd packs of same level radrats defending the munitions factory...  sometimes it feels like melee is the only viable option if you dont want to spend 50% of your game time filling up the ammo box.
---
Haha, I figured that was my least threatening outfit...
---
That's not limited to heavy guns.   
---
In heavy guns, Gatlings and 50 Cals are good, while LMG, minigun and explosive weapons suck.   
---
In commando, handmades and combat rifles are good, the two SMGs are okay (the 10mm is actually not half bad for low level areas) while assault rifles and radium rifles suck.  
---
In energy weapons, flamers suck, cryo are ok and plasma gun on flamer conversion mod kicks royal arse (albeit breaks fast). Laser weapons suck.  
---
Half of all equipment in the game being somehow nerfed to be useless is a scorched plague that affects all weapon categories in the game, not just heavies.
---
That should be amazing.. and when you defeat him.. instead of normal looting he sells you something cool..
---
Again using their words got an issue with it take it up with Bethesda lol.
---
People so jumpy at the TSE nerfs, just prep more weapons i stocked myself 5 good weapons because i knew they would do something like this. Even tried to warn people in so many threads here to prepare for nerfs and just got laughed off....
---
Its not the most ideal choice but its the one Bethesda has chosen.
---
That’s not my point though is it? The entire point I’ve made is that it’s possible to bypass locked doors which makes locked doors redundant in some way.
---
So I have no  idea why you’re just saying things that are obvious to anyone who has played the game for 10 minutes
---
NPCs were originally in the game but they were cut, so the resources definitely exist.  
---
Furious favors higher ROF weapons. Anti Armor is also questionable. 
---
I would love it if Atomic shop had some seriously cool stuff. Realistically there's what 30 items, that might seem like a lot but it's a very tiny amount. If Bethesda wants to maintain people spending money they need to realize we need moar variety. I think there are two things on there I want but don't care enough to spend the atoms. Stash box color and pipboy color. I'd even spend the real moneys if I came across something I felt. I kind of thought this is what they were going to do, maybe in the future?
---
I owe you an upvote for the wonderful work you did on your edits.  You gave me a lot of viewing material and, for someone who has terrible insomnia, that's a real service.  This is something to help ease me into sleep sometime around 5 in the morning.
---
Im talking about the caps. You get negative balance on your caps if you have no caps and die as wanted.
---
Believe there are only plans for the Torso, limb's cannot be modded with dense. As well, the naming is screwed up on them, so they're wording something like:
---
Combat Dense Lining Plan - which is the Marine Torso
---
and
---
Combat Dense Lining Plan - which is the Combat Torso
---
Kind of a toss up if you get the right plan.
---
Maybe he'll join the non-dupers one day when he gets sick of "God mode" and making cash at the expense of others in a scammy way. I don't know if he'll be around in 5 years but if he is that he's making content that isn't like this. 
---
Don’t remember. Something with the name Ryan
---
I see, thank you for this!
---
My point isn’t that people won’t just break your stuff, It’s that this makes locks redundant in a way. 
---
It’s also something I see a lot
---
Locked doors but easy ways to get in. So clearly people don’t know about this little workaround which is why I’ve made the topic  
---
Screenshot that and post it. I'm curious as well but on PS4
---
I shouldn’t be able to target anything friendly in VATS. I’m so sick of targeting a turret with ghouls coming at me. 
---
That's been a trend in the comments, sadly. 
---
I mean, it’s basically just Fo4 but reskinned and a lot of Fo junkies hated 4 because it was more of a FPS than an RPG so yeah. 
---
I’ve never had it target a player after something dies. The first target is generally where it fucks up and targets a friendly.
---
I won't do a gun build of any sort without vats.
---
Its too much of a massive damage boost to ignore
---
LMAO, imagine trying to witchhunt somone for playing the game how it was intended to be. I get that it's a dick move, but fuck right off.
---
Thing is your title... Sounds like a letter from a creep to a girl he's been stalking for 7 months and 28 days.
---
I mean it's not the weirdest thing I'd see in Fallout but still... kinda gives me the shivers.
---
Also who the funk thought of making the supply drops character specific? I liked them when they didn't share inventory and were not property of one schmock who called it.
---
Will cat meat do?
---
The correct picked numbers showed up for the individual flowers when I logged in today but still said 0 of 8 on the challenge. Then at some point, they all reset to 0
---
Well. I wish I had their sales numbers in front of me for the Atomic Shop. I'd be really curious to see what the player base really thinks. Me personally, most of the item shops seems silly and overpriced. Don't get me started about how paint jobs for armor only cover one armor type, which essentially means if I want all types I'd pay what $30? hahahaha. But I am sorta glad I bought the bone antlers.... with atoms. 
---
Just pointing out that they're botching the nerf. Dupers with duped God rolled guns were the problem......and they still are.
---
I've only played 300 hours and only have 2  3* legendaries. One is a quad explosive radium that I built my character around and the other is an anti-armor cryolator which not only doesn't fit my build but I don't want to build a character around it.
---
I have a TS handmade that needs some mods but it is mediocre at best. Just a regular old player here, not a duper but it's my mediocre weapons that are going to be nerfed while the TSE will remain the best guns in the wasteland. Bethesda botched this big time.
---
Wasn't bragging, I dont even take part of it. It was just a suggestion 
---

Ping me tomorrow on Discord or here, I'll help you out with a full set of 1*+ Raider Armor, I might even have some weightless left :)

It's a bug.

If you want to use it you'll have to find a prime receiver for a different weapon that uses .44.
---

PvP players getting desperate.

It doesn't. It requires .44.

Probably still a typo, but it's unusable.
---
Awesome, hope you had a great time...   
---
As I said there, love it when we can get 6+ people all working together, 9/10 Legendaries might be terrible, but chatting while smacking zombies is always fun!
---
Had shit ton of issues after ingame and ini tweaks after update so I reinstalled. And today played for 6 hours with one crash like 3 hours in and then 3 hours till the next one. Ini tweaks just fucked it up for me so I made nvidia 3D setting favor performance over quality and that also seemed to help. Used to crash every 40th minute before reinstall.
---
Agreed 100% flamer blows when compared to other weapons, but in pvp the flamer is my go to weapon. I cant tell you how fast it burns hp, I have won so many fights using it. People never see it coming
---
Got most my weapon plans from patrol duty. 
---
Furious is my favorite legendary effect; its nice against tough enemies with high ROF weapons. Explosive and Two Shot are good and all, arguably better in most cases, but somehow I really enjoy plinking their health bars and watching each consecutive hit hurt more and more. 
---
Hey, I give them prop's for what they tried. The problem is to pull it off, it needed a lot more time in the oven. It's the kind of thing that sounds good on paper, but continuously seems to crumble as time passes.
---
" Considering how the only legendaries anyone seems to want on trading sites are Two-shot explosive guns, "
---
Wrong for me, I want an Instigating/Bloody/AA/Mutants + 50% vats crit damage rifle but no one is selling one since they weren't duped and actual good loot drops in this game are very very very bad.

Hmm good one.

Question, when you got the mutation did anything wacky happen? (CTD, Death, server disconnect?).  
---
What platform are you on?
---
You are incorrect.
---
Yeah those were bugs and they are fixed 
---
My two closest friends like it a lot more than any game released last year and they both could not get into fallout before 76. I like it because I have played the series since I was a little kid. I dunno what it is about this one but we all love it.
---
Fair point, in '76 I personally love melee or ridiculous heavy weapons, but neither work for a non-PA stealth sniper.

Yeah, apparently it was quietly changed a little while back...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afoc1y/psa_supply_drops_are_now_unique_loot_and_need_to/
---
Now I feel like an idiot for the ones I launched not realizing the changes ...
---
I believe the push is going towards AAE weapons over TSE for the pre patch prep.
---
The only thing i can say is prepare for the change. I am sure once they start balancing it all out they will do some buffs to the other less used affixes as well.
---
It’s healthier to not expect anything anymore 
---
&gt;TSE are still going to be the most OP guns in the game
---
Debatable. 
---
Is that represented by Vault-Tec University in-game? 
---
Im inclined to agree with the sentiment here. A lot of what I see boils down to people wanting their character to do everything equally well and not make any trades. That is not Fallout 76. This is not Battlefield and it is not Call of Duty. 
---
Don't mind all the negative Nancy's. You do you! If you enjoy it, do it! A build that is fun to play with is better than a kick-ass build that you find boring.
---
I agree.
---
I've currently out the brakes on my perk card selections. I'm not going to waste anymore time building my character in the wrong direction until I find out how badly my gun gets nerfed.
---
How many more months? lmao....
---
I had a guy send me a party invite and when I told him I’m a lone wanderer, he didn’t like that answer and started to follow me around.
---
At one point I thought he had finally left me alone, but lo and behold, he shows up again. This time I decided enough was enough, so I turned and started firing on him. As I started firing I noticed a HORDE of crabs surrounding us. He never had a chance to fire back...
---
Had that happen a few days ago. Hopped to another nuked server, and it was normal. Glitch, I guess. 
---
Xbox here and definitely works normal for me have gotten a few other mutations through serums since having carnivore.
---
Before it's been the server disconnect, but now it's a legit full on game crash. Ie. Blue screen to the PS4 menu bar. 
---
It would take a modder 5 minutes to do this btw. Is anyone left working on this game?
---
Stupid idea imo
---
Why change something like that when there're bigger problems?
---
Like my GFs character genderbending through loading times or Scorchbeasts feminism mode (nonstop screaming)
---
Exactly!!!
---
Is purified water even good for anything?  I just drink muttfruit juice or corn soup 90% of the time anyway
---
Actually that is something i have not prepped but should...
---
We only know of the two major ones might be worthwhile to seen how the rest play out. I have my 5 ready and most covered by builds. I might prep some points juuuust incase.
---
Yup happens on PC too. Had this happen many times tonight, the map seems to be ok though although people and nuke zones arent loaded for a minute
---
Territorial Occupation With National Sanctuary 
---
The best way I can see this working is if online official guilds were added like the BoS, the Enclave, Raiders, or the Responders. Each faction having territory to conquer and defend, and in their territory there can be these T.O.W.N.S. that provide temporary shelter, shops (either run by robots or other players), gardens, and medical treatment centers. There would have to be designated, permanent areas but players should be allowed to build on them, such as defenses, decorations, crafting stations, and such. 
---
It’s impossible to truly trap someone though, when they can just server hop away.
---
A majority of the guns in this game are utter trash due to various reasons. Beta testing.
---
Level 83?

Your backpack must have smelled pretty bad with the few metric tons of spoiled food it contained XD

Try putting one of each in your buddies artillery. If it works you will be the best PvP player in Fallout.
---
Excited to see you come back to this post when you sober up. Really hoping you forget you posted this.
---
Also works fine with me as well, I use garb of mysteries with Eye of Ra.
---
Anti-Armor gives a flat 28.9% damage increase.
---
It should be better for low damage weapons or against high armor targets, which would at least make it interesting, but it isn't.
---
I suspect the same thing happened to me.  I have plans for Ultracite .308, but no receivers in that chamber.
---
Unfortunately they’re probably duper’s which means the cost to repair will be nothing to them, but good job nonetheless.
---
Navybluepaint Ill add you tomorrow mate
---
How did you find their camp? 
---
I am sure modders would jump at the chance to get into the game like that. But they are limited to interface mods.
---
Mind you alot of the mods for 76 spin me out. Like the text chat mod. Made and hosted by one lad even gives us clans and all.
---
One lad made that lol...
---
Or the author of the known plans mod and better inventory mod... crazy.
---
Weird. I use 3x chameleon gear and 2x harder to detect pieces, and have 25 AGI.
---
If someone player is near me causing a ton of noise I am always detected.
---
So in this case, DP means drunk posting or....
---
I'm guessing maybe. When I first entered the house their were 2 bags on the ground, filled with plans and treasure maps. I may have taken them all. 
---
To some people, the challenge of finding and abusing exploits to their advantage *is* the game. 
---
Out of curiosity how does that work? 5% off caps seems like it’s a scam 
---
Hehe very generous of you. But i already have a good set going, just missing a couple key mods. Hence why ive been looking for crafting plans, so i could learn them through scrapping.
---
They weren’t hacking, they were duping before the latest patch.
---
I know.. Like I said I wish there was an effective way..  
---
It would give us options outside of just murdering people for their Junk.
---
Watched them afterwards for a couple minutes. They were in the middle of no where stationary. Figured it was their camp. 
---

---
I'll try to remember to look in the morning and I'll tell you where they can be found.
---
how do you know it was stacked bobble heads? or dupers? 
---
TBH almost all the rifle weapons should be .308. as default. Combat Rifle based on Browning Automatic Rifle used .30-06, LMG and AR based on MG42 and FG 42 respectively used 8mm Mauser. The Minigun based on a M-134 uses 7.62 NATO.  
---
The only conceivable reason i can the CR uses .45 is that .45 in game represents .45 ACP AND .45-70. .45-70 i might add is a caliber used in hand cranked Gatling Guns...  
---
5mm ammo shouldn't even be a thing only 5.56.  Damage should be tied to the Bullet and the bolt action receivers gaining a small damage boost compared to the semi and full-autos.

To be fair, fallout 76 did throw out a broad net to people who spent their time until now playing rust, borderlands, fortnite and call of duty, rather than just those who’ve been immersed in Skyrim, new Vegas and fallout 4. 
---
Understandably, when they crowd get given a rocket launcher, they expect it to behave like a rocket launcher in fortnite, not a rocket launcher in real life. 
---
I have a funny anecdote on that. I’m an Israeli expat, and did military service there. There’s a social debate going on in Israel, about whether combatant units made up of aging 40 year old office workers who come in to do reserve duty for 4 weeks a year are, from a strict combat efficacy standpoint, any good. Critics call out the “rocket launcher measure”. That is, the guy with the rocket launcher gets to practice fire maybe one rocket a year. And they use that person to gauge how capable he entire unit is. Hint: that metric is abysmal. Across the board, in those units, that guy can’t hit shit. 
---
And that’s a lot of words to say that in real life, your rocket launcher doesn’t become a useful piece of equipment the moment you pick it up. Takes skill and practice. 
---
In Fallout 76 too. 
---
Not sure if dupers. But one shot from a fair distance away dropped me in 1 hit. I've PVP'd explosive weapons before but usually takes more than a couple to down me. 
---
He provides a discount code to buy duped items and caps at the start of his video on a website I guess he's either affiliated with or owns. I don't know. But then goes on to tell people to stop duping. That's all I know.
---
Just for the record, I just now solod it. Pretty handily too. No higher levels came along this time. Level 37. :3
---
Ammosmith is 34
---
Super Duper is 50
---
Chemist is 34
---
Responder trading bot wouldn't agree.
---
I managed it once I found a slow server. Rank 37 was enough. Super sledge and power armor was really all I needed. 
---
Sometimes I think Bethesda should just wipe all legendary weapons and basic materials to a clean slate.  Just give every existing player like 50 of each in their stash as compensation.
---
Sadly no, I wish I did because I was "disconnected" from 5 different servers each time I was helping a low level
---
Fantastic job.  It looks like a proper house.
---
Some people are luckier than others.
---
just what i was thinking since my idea wont work. Do you know any good pa melee builds? Also do they use a gun as a secondary against scorchbeats?
---
Yeah maybe, but still that is only unofficial modification, no something officially made.
---
Interesting 
---
Does it even crash when you just tab out to desktop?
---
Can you run it in window mode with borders and check if your RAM usage is spiking shortly before BSOD?
---

---
I’m curious as to how one buys caps though, there is no gift function so does he have to then meet you in game and buy 1 steel scrap for a pre set amount based on the cash purchase
---
I’ve seen loads of videos with a 5% discount on items/caps but never hit that click bait, sadly I’ve only seen one fo76 video where the person didn’t do the hit like hit subscribe routine kept it short and sweet so there was no ads 
---
Its a pretty complex problem and every solution Ive heard has some pretty scathing negative tradeoff. In your case, people who played legit would be losing their items. For me personally I am not in love with my items and could let them go, but I imagine there are people who just would never be okay with losing all their legit gear (obviously). So I'd say it is too big of a negative to be a viable solution
---
&gt; **Who in the marketing and monetization department** 
---
Everyone. All of them. Except they're not "disconnected;" they just don't care. They have their cookie cutters and their MBAs and aren't capable of understanding the concept that there's anything they don't know that might be important.
---
Probably, but perhaps their concern was that being the internet this would quickly become spiteful.

English is probably the most difficult second language, and honestly, there are many native speakers with worse. I liked reading about something other than bugs thanks for posting.

For sure, not an easy call to make.  Perhaps it'd be better to have something like a hard limit on the amount of identical legendary  weapons you can hold, and extras are immediately deleted. Perhaps only 2 or 3, since getting  identical legendary item is pretty rare.
---
I crouch and try to kill everything without being seen. Hell, even if I’m in power armor

Nah, his channel has been abusing glitches since the first year of its creation; he needs to learn a lesson eventually from someone even if it means getting his channel shutdown. He's just going to move the next game and post more glitch videos for it since his audience wants that toxic content.

Nope doesn’t BSOD when I tab out to desktop. Ram usage never hits 9GB.

What made the fallout series great were the stories you don't get that rich environment without the factions or the npcs Nick Valentine struggling with his humanity kent getting so overwhelmed by the harsh reality of a post apocalyptic world that he turns to a fictional character for a glimmer of hope the people of good neighbor the list goes on ,those were the things I really loved about fallout and Skyrim without these things there just buggy messes whoever took the reigns put profit before product and it shows in 76 but hey at least we have graham

Ad Victorium! Though I may be isolated now, we will rebuild!

Ya definitely here a video of it with no rifle man perk 
---
Just had this happen to me. I have a TSE lever action I never use because I kill myself with it, but it came in handy when three guys tried to push me around on one of my low level accounts. I switched accounts and wiped the floor with them. One of them said he could do it all day, and I didn't mind making more caps so I let him. 
---
Ive been to three seperate blast zones in two days and i think they might have over done it
---
This has always been a problem with class less RPG systems 
---
What exactly are you having trouble with may I ask so people can maybe give you tips.
---
I crash around Watoga ALL. THE. DAMN. TIME. since the latest patch.  Cleared my cache, rebuilt the PS4 database, and still crash a ton.
---
Only option remaining is to reinstall, but I don't want to lose all my screenshots from launch... 
---
*sad trombone*

Scorchbeast queen also takes damage from hits that are not VATS or criticals.
---
VATS and critical are not required to damage the scorchbeast queen.

You can damage the scorchbeast queen without VATS or criticals.

Jeremy (TheQuartering) never claimed that Fallout 76 was, in fact, going free to play. He says multiple times in his first video on the matter that this was purely his own speculation based on what he was being told and what he was seeing. The title of the video, "Bethesda Spoke To Me On Fallout 76 Going Free To Play", is not a lie, unless you interpret that as "Bethesda literally spoke to me on the phone, not via email", in which case there's no point in this rebuttal at all.   
---
His exact statement in the video is as follows:   
---
"Hi, I wanted to introduce myself, I work for Bethesda with content creators and streamers. I saw your video on EB games and free to play. I posted our official response in twitter form below. If you need anything else in the future, I am your official contact."  
---
The twitter post being referred to is the same twitter post denying F2P rumors that we all saw. If you genuinely refuse to believe that Bethesda would make content with youtube content creators, streamers, etc, then I'd argue that that is inarguably false, because, well, they do. So, I've got to ask, in the context of the Fallout F2P rumors and the videos Jeremy has made on the subject, what did he lie about?   
---
As for the Squenix debacle, I didn't watch those videos, because I don't care. But, honestly, seems like you might be pissed off about some weeb shit. I have my own issues with Jeremy, but even I can't deny that as far as games industry commentary, he's one of the best. His information, from what I've seen in the past couple years, is nearly always accurate, and if proven to not be, he has a proven track record of correcting it.   
---
I know this is probably going to get downvoted into oblivion, but I think it's about time we all learn to stop worshiping our personal sacred cows (video games we like) and learn how to acknowledge and build off of differing opinions, constructive criticism, and start acting like adults.

Whenever the protectrons do the weird voice drop thing it gets me every time lmao, Wallace is #1 to me for that reason, Phoneix takes #2 for his genocidal tendencies towards the robots of Watoga

It would be much easier for me to learn english well, than whoever speak english to lear Czech. If i would active use english for at least month i could use it properly, but i don't use it at all, so...
---
They use the same system in their laser gats. If my understanding of the situation is correct they would need to create another script and that might be asking them too much currently. 
---
If they change it by tweaking the script and not creating an entirely new one your laser gats will pretty much be reloading every 5 seconds cuz they keep putting in half charged batteries.
---
So its essentially someone gets screwed no matter what. Seeing as a person using power armour only has to deal with this every hour or so while a person using a lazer gat would have to deal with this every minute or so, you can clearly see who they would rather benefit.

If it makes you feel any better, every time i do distant thunder I get the motion servor for the t-60

The ability to use crafting benches through locked doors is a carry over from Fallout 4. Some people likely know already. 
---
This annoyed the hell out of me. If you open the pipboy the second you get it'll be pitch black then you'll be locked and get move. Fast travelling freezes your character I think if you do that with the glitch.

thats low deathclaw is fine if u want farm some gear.

Your modern, real life radio station can operate without a human at the controls, no problem.  It's all automated, and the DJ is just there for the sake of tradition.  As long as there's a power source to keep the computer running, it could play the programmed top 40 hits and ads for all of eternity.
---
100 feel ya this overpriced Sims bs is outta hand less frilly dresses and go kart beds and more badd ass apocalyptic stuff the direction they are steering this franchise into   is way off course
---
And now we have the burnt out gamers annoyed at the still present crashes, and un-immersive bugs 
---
thank you
---
Close out the game and it'll fix it don't bother logging out as the bug remains, and after obviously don't go opening the pip boy until you load.
---
because he sell uniqe items...
---
I'm finding them in the wild more now, his unlocked the drum mag!!!
---
They are more for going against the edges of you walls roofs and floors, meaning the are for indoor use mostly. There are two kinds, one that go along the ceiling and the other along the floor, the flat side of connectors will tell you which is which. 
---
You will still use wires to connect your device to the pipes, but they will be greatly shorter and less sightless depending how close to lay the pipes to the antenna. Use a a single sided connector close to the antenna and work backwards towards the generator. From that point to need to see if you want a single pipe line or if you’d want it to branch out at a certain point. 
---
Since I can’t see your bases and there really isn’t videos on this stuff you’d just need to take it slow and go through trail and error. You should get the hang of it soon enough.  
---
Nice I've done this before, when I saw some guys griefing a low LVL players camp. I want there to be a Rogue or bounty hunters side group falll
---
ction (like cult of Mothman or mistress of mysteries.)
---
Well my whole team gets dc and then we all can join right back unlike the regular dc of a whole  server
---
Its bug cause by charisma perk card that increase their power, you have to remove it and then equip it again.
---
but what if my camp is on seneca rocks?
---
I get a feeling that if this was implemented the first thing people would do is nuke them
---
I repair walls and turrets at camps I find all the time, or kill off attackers while I'm there.  I think of it as my fee for using the generously provided stove and stash box.
---
You have to kill a high level assaultron and they will drop the plan
---
Jealous, I keep spawning midway in the sky and always cripple my legs :( 
---
Youtube business model encourages trashy content, what's new?
---
Thats no joke. Ive actually had just as many crashes since friday as ive had in the previous 2 months. Idk whats happening.
---
Play for a few hundred hours and then post your experience.
---
Yes definitely seeing them more, loot pool possibly buffed last update? 
---
Yeah, I've spoken to a few fresh faces who say Appalachia is "just a big, buggy mess" after just being outside for an hour or two and they immediately go back into the Vault. I mean, I've seen a few irradiated giant ticks here and there and a few Cave Crickets but it's the bigger things they gotta worry about...like Fog Crawlers and Hermit Crabs.
---
I don't blame the devs, just the marketing and oversight pushing it out. I still enjoy the game and have dumped way too much time into it. 
---
The other side of the coin, it's a con to initiate pvp so they can bypass slap damage -_-
---
I'm kind of glad you said something.
---
I was carrying 11 of those...
---
or just learn how to kill sentry bots...
---
Lone Wanderer is a big card for me.

Mad scientist that sells new perk cards and Respec.

"I was wanted and someone killed me and took all my junk, I don't understand why"
---
Bro if you don't store your junk when you are wanted, you have a lot to learn. Being wanted is really fun if you dump your junk first and go looking for trouble and don't have to worry about losing anything besides 10 caps. Try getting wanted and running up to people using emotes and melee, people will get it and often shoot at you with a smaller weapon than their best 2se. If they do 1shot you, no big deal. Get wanted again and find someone with a sense of humor
---
If you want the thrill of hunting someone or being hunted, there's a whole radio station dedicated for it (Hunter/Hunted Radio)
---
The wanted system is designed to punish players.
---
Eh, people will stop as soon as they can't one shot you with the upcoming nerf to explosive and two shot; pvp will improve dramatically.
---
I managed 417 ore last run. Be sure to check the ceiling, and the secret passages are loaded with them as well. 
---
No your just playing a more stable version of the game than us. The past two months have not been good to us. While we love the game to bits and the idea of it. It does not mean we can shrug off the past two months. 
---
Alot of the complaints have alot of grounds to them. Some went about them the wrong way and the rest of us just did our best to bring them to light and hang through the bugs , crashes , disconnects, exploits etc etc etc.
---
That's pretty awesome. Though, I'm waiting for the chroma skins to come out so that you can do the Armageddon hero walk shot

Same for cavalier, no? 
---
For every person like you saying it's easy, there is an equal amount, or more, saying they have a hard time finding him, one is in this very chain.
---
this is from the ps4 version
---
Sure do, they have this „pew pew“ red light guns and some have green light guns 
---
How about we have vodka and some jet and take a  guns from their cold dead hands? 
---
I know they have a bunker around here somewhere. I want green gunz, you can have the red pew pews 
---
Ya I def feel like is has been but that could be my imagination
---
How high? Like we talking Snoop dogg or Joe Rogan?
---
If you're willing to give up some Atoms, you could buy that suit in the Atomic Shop.
---
I'm curious where you are getting that figure.  
---
If DR works like it did in fo4 (as most of the game mechanics seem to) then iirc the benefit of 50% armor bypass would vary wildly depending on the ballistic DR of the target.  
---
But all that said if you have some info on that 28.9% number and how it's derived I'd love to learn more.
---
Eh in between it can be level 35-60
---
Yeah they're not all up to snuff. If they can't handle a few bugs they can't help us push back the scorched. We can send some of them to Camp Venture and Camp McLintock. If they can figure out how to get in our secure areas of Fort Defiance without us holding their hands, I'd say they're worthy of being an initiate.
---
It is a nice card.. Too many more evening like tonight and I might invest.
---
Well, go buy some caps and find out. Make a video about it. Interview the seller. Find out what they think about duping. Ask them if they think its cheating. Etc. Then post it on youtube and post it here. I would have no ethical qualm with someone doing this as a journalism experiment. As a journalist its important to not be like overly judgemental or moral. It's about letting them tell their story. It's just an idea since you seem to want to know more and this subject and i think doing so as someone who wants to learn but doesnt condone duping, well that'd be a journalist. Just a thought.
---
I do this all the time but I never take their stuff. I figure they would rather that than someone who would take the stuff, and sometimes the 10 caps is more than what I paid to get to them, so that's a plus!
---
Shitload of orbital strike grenades and a fatman
---
Use the Robotics Expert card maxed out and hack the residents robots in each area. Do this first thing in each area to limit the number of robots in the area. Then hack each one you find. Then do what you need to do in the area and move on to the next. Warning as soon as you attack a robot you will either have to hack them again or defeat them. The hack lasts about 3 minutes and is harder to do each time on the same robot. (Just guessing about time length I did not time it.)
---
Maybe they spammed explosives or something? like, just hawked two dozen grenades at your camp? that would also probably make the server slow way down.
---
I've dropped by an E or TSE before and it took a few hits, I'm assuming in my case that the player wasnt cheating. But I was lucky I suppose
---
Youre close, Rose was a sort of replacement goldfish for David Thorpe’s girlfriend that he made when the real Rose died during the destruction of Charleston. Which has it’s own creepy implications... 
---
It's actually based on statements made by the game's executive producer, but sure, making shit up while accusing people of making shit up is fine, I guess. 
---
only content of this game farming legendary... this is some kidn of gambling.. ur bet is ur time and ur amolution. so if u can craft them the game is ended.
---
Noice! Now if only there was an aluminum (aluminium if you're across the pond) mine of the same volume.
---
It's also kind of not true. And by kind of, I mean entirely. Check out the video. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEYBO5A18YQ&amp;t=627s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEYBO5A18YQ&amp;t=627s)

This is fantastic.  How weird must it feel to be intimately familiar with a place you've never been to in real life?
---
When I saw the pic of the clubhouse, I was like wow.....I've spent so much time there and it's real.  I'd be half expecting a swarm of ghouls while opening those doors.
---
The WV Tourism site is almost surreal, seeing so much stuff I'm familiar with in game as real life stuff that actually exists.
---
What's your characters luck at??
---
If that doesn't work, dying usually fixes it

---
Sorry I was just looking to see if anyone knew anything about it, obviously you don’t but seems like you have to be on a soap box so please continue commenting while not acutely being able to answer in any real fashion 
---
Was it laggy there?
---
Yeah, just delete mules who are carrying dupes of items. I mean its usually like 100 TSE shotguns on a mule, and then 200 TSE handmades, and then 50000 nuke colas. 
---
I know some people have complained about this idea because they have legitimate junk mules... like someone was saying they had 50,000 steel that they got legimately. It seems like a lot of steel so I'm not really sure how many people are legitimately using a mule to hold extra bullshit or not. 
---
 bethesda could also be worried about a class action lawsuit of angry players claiming their legimiate gear got nuked. I don't know how valid such a lawsuit would be, so maybe I'm way off the mark here. But deleting a legitimate item that took hours to grind it sounds like there maybe would be an avenue for a lawsuit... I don't know.
---
Hmm i might try that
---
This is now my favorite topic on reddit 
---
I did. Unfortunately it still comes up zero for each no matter how many I pick 
---
Wow, this is 3* legendary tier. Your voice fits really well with the song.
---
My only critique is it should be "what you got now / less 50 cal" not "what do you get / less 50 cal" because I changed that lyric. But from the sounds of it, you did this all in a single take and re-recording it all to fix that would have probably been a pain in the ass.
---
I also love the few touches you added to this. The little swear in the background and your outro are both great.
---
I think the nerf is or was needed tbh, I know ppl want shit to be easy and somethings in fo76 ain't without some OP weapons but for pvp it's by far a too OP 
---
When the timer runs out you can still kill and loot her. Even if it takes you an hour. Me and a friend did it, just the 2 of us.
---
What do you use aluminum on? I find myself constantly dropping or bulking and selling it.
---
This is useful for pvp in general 
---
I actually found the plan inside whitesprings. It was on a dead assaultron in a laundry cart. Its on the 2nd floor i think in one of the back rooms. Though its probably a random drop on assaultrons.
---
Yeah doooooo it
---
Still a better love story than Twlight.
---
By the time she would have died, all my ammo would have been gone and weapons broken,  unfortunately. 
---
Can't wait for people to be able to make private servers on their own and actually fix the meaning of pvp in this game as well as many other elements. Modders have almost always been better at pleasing the fan base than Bethesda. 
---
All depends on what platform you are running on. 
---
Also depends on the community you play with. The online human player element makes the game great or rage quit worthy!
---
As stated depends on the community you play with...
---
Yeh we had to take turns returning to base to fix our weapons lol
---
You're really setting the bar high there huh
---
I had it before that the SBQ stops, losing health, waste of ammo tbh
---
If a player fast travels to somewhere there's no location for one, or if they seem out of place on the map both are pretty good indicators 
---
Should be in challenges
---
Yes jus wait a few more sec for loading to complete. I was freaking out but it loaded
---
I'm a outfits collector. Ive almost everything but VTU baseball cap and dirty white asylum worker hat....
---
Got a beautiful vampiric limb damage cat weight one. Lvl 1.
---
Alot of mine in stash is from stable flux. I have around 120ish lbs of that alone. Most of it from the 78 Yellowcake.. I need to sell some of it I guess
---
Ive done all that and reinstalled twice it hasnt helped a bit. Watoga and whitesprings are death but i still crash elsewhere. 
---
They will eventually release new more powerful weapons and a power creep spiral will ensue 
---
Shotguns will be among the top tier weapons for pvp, So I conclude after seeing the leaks of the pvp map 
---
Hey it's just an idea. Relax. I'm not telling you what to do or what to think. It doesn't matter to me in the slightest what you do. But I will tell you that I really don't have much respect for people that mistake someone sharing an idea with telling them what to do. Take that for what you will.
---
I honestly couldn’t agree more
---
I can make VTU jumpsuit (not jacket and jeans). Yes its plans exist. selling it for 200 caps if anyone wants it here.
---
Sure
---
If it's a random drop. The same applies to Mr Gutsy and their Buzzsaw Plans, and the Bladed Commie Wacker Plans are found on Liberators. 
---
I have one for you. I should probably report this. I've noticed it since beta.
---
When in power armor, the up/down movement (I guess that would be the Z axis?) when sneaking is significantly slower than when not sneaking. I haven't found a way to fix this with sensitivity settings.
---
I have to add another 1" - 1.5" of mouse movement to my up/down aiming when sneaking. The left/right aiming doesn't seem to be affected.
---
Dont get me wrong. I’m 100% on your side. I would love to see a huge stash increase. Afterall this game is about collecting stuff. And with the current stash size we are very limited. You need to think twice about stashing a heavy gun. Let alone two or three.
---
But I fear Bethesda is at its limits with the currrent engine which is super dated since the days of Oblivion and was never designed as a multiplayer engine in the first place. 
---
Hopefully we will get at least a bit more space. 
---
Maybe they spammed explosive bobble heads and MIRV nuked your camp, bringing down the whole server with them while at the same time used the server crash for their dupe 
---
Amen to that.
---
How??,I thought 15 was max unless your all chemed up lol
---
1. buy a plan of gaus from enclave vendor
---
2. craft 20-30pcs
---
3. scapt it
---
4. now u have all mods
---
now u just need to get a decent two shot gaus (oh to bad its will be nerfed to usless level, because dumb devs dowt undestand the explosive perk what is broken). u need all rifle perks and long shot +blody mess+tenderizer
---
Are they at the vendor bot that's supposedly there? I just followed someone to where the bridge key was and haven't gone back.
---
Shiny team!
---
Yeah, happens to me on PS4, I thought it might be to do with certain perk cards but I need to test it further and work it out. My prime suspects are action boy and gun fu. I'll report back if I find out!
---
Random invites 
---
Incite destroyed camps 
---
It's a part of this thing to get plans for the alien blaster fusion cell ammo type
---
If you're on PC I have Prime Western Revolver Plans. Learning those should give your access to .44 Ultracite ammo. 
---
It did double dmg in fallout 4 for guns thats shot one bullet at a time.
---
Incorrect, any will do.
---
Personally I got mine off the 24's outside Watoga. 
---
Welp, gonna have to hope that next patch helps, I guess. 
---
I usually crash around events and vendors (the only two things I find fun/need at this point), and most often while sprinting. Sometimes, if I stop just outside of render range and slowly creep up on said events or vendors, I'm all good. 
---
Rest of the time I do my best Eyeore impersonation, "Well... I guess I was just going to server hop anyway...".
---
My bad, ive only gotten them off of higher level ones. I apologize 
---
Great passive aggressive tactic but really I’m just happy to have wasted your time now lmao but when someone asks a question and you can’t or won’t give an actual answer specific to the question why do you feel compelled to say anything there is nothing constructive to be gained outside of making yourself look foolish 
---
I'm impressed you managed to get up there. I tried to move my camp there when I first found it but couldn't place the camp anywhere in the vicinity close enough to be able to build in the monorail car. 
---
&gt; Everyone's gonna want cool looking BoS armour.
---
Unless you're waiting for Maxson's battlecoat or Kells' hat, BoS outfits are all available in-game, not in the Atom shop. The armor paint is weirdly found mainly at the Grafton vendors rather than Phoenix, but Forbidden Knowledge and the Cranberry Bog in general are your source for basically everything else BoS.
---
As with real life, suicide fixes a lot of things - I can attest to that 
---
There's 3 bags inside the Uranium fever room, so whenever I'm there I pick them up
---
Assultron's don't even go anywhere close to 60, the max out at 48 with assultron dominators. 
---
Other MMOs manage it.
---
Do you use targeting HUD in your pa or party with someone who does? This has been causing stability issues since last patch. Recon sensors might cause it too. I was having similar issues, installed a vats matrix overlay and the issues are gone (that is the mod I happened to find at a vendor first, didn't want to have to find a new helmet and bright lamp)
---
Do you use the targeting HUD pa mod? That mod has been causing issues for a lot of players since last patch
---
a regular gaus gun make same damage.. just say..
---
They need to add a timer under the event son the map or have a warning when trying to FT or join that say "event is almost over, do you still wish to travel/enter" 
---
I've lost so many caps like this for feed the people  :( 
---
Yeah, I agree.  I've been waiting for a cool brotherhood or enclave outfit to wear.  Something kinda camo.  What's in the atom shop right now screams "hey this is RD2, enjoy your cowboy outfits".
---
I DO! ON ERRYTING! 
---
Thank Frank I have a no-PA skillset to fall back on. Will try that and see if it helps.
---
I love it when people attack, end up getting their asses handed, and start blaming me for defending myself.
---
Wait - treasure maps drop on death too?!
---
get a gaus gun...
---
An example of my complaints.  Playing this weekend with time more of an issue than caps I fast travelled to Watoga and actually bought screws.  I then fast travelled to an event that popped where you have to protect a robot at a military base on top of the Mt. South of Watoga.  As I spawn the cliff doesnt render.  I fall to my death only to have the cliff finally render so my freshly bought screws are 10 yards deep in a mountain side.  Fun huh.
---
Yeah like we shouldn’t be feeling forced or restricted this much to having to increase special stats just to have room for weight reduction cards. Like I hate feeling constantly bogged down just because I need thru-hiker 3 to carry a comfortable amount of purified water (not to mention food) on me in case I’m out for an extended period of time because of an event, nuke or something similar 
---
Or you can remove your helmet temporarily, it won't make a lot of difference if you aren't in a nuke zone, if you have a mining helmet for light. I don't recommend going to SBQ without a helm though... I did that. I definitely noticed 😅
---
Yes. What they're asking is why you can't use purified water to cook with as well
---
Monorail near Fort Defiance has like 10 bags. And there's some on the bridge just south of Flatwoods.
---
I don't feel foolish and I don't think it was a waste of time talking to you. I'm actually debating doing it myself since you passed up on it because it sounds pretty interesting to me. I am unfortunately really behind in doing a bunch of mundane life bullshit to tackle
---
As for why give an answer that isn't the answer you wanted? I gave you an idea to go get the answer. You think it's a bad answer so fine, I accept that. Moving on 
---
I'm sure they could change the menu to eat boiled OR purified
---
Thiiiis is gonna be great when you sober up
---
How do you get by without any junk? 
---
I am a level 109 now and honestly i start to miss something i feel i have done everything, i have all the PA sets, launched nukes, killed the SBQ, done all the quests, ofc i can make mods from my PA and  find new plans, but its more like travelling from vendor to vendor. Pvp is  just wasting caps. You dont rly gain much from it. I hope bethesda will add new features soon like quests, a better pvp system and new locations soon.  Also maybe add more bosses on other places  when u nuke a that place, because its either whitesprings or fissure site prime thats being nuked. Which gets boring after a while... 
---
Totally worth 25K caps. *bapbapbapbap*
---
Couldnt care less Grahm is considered special because of artificial rarity created by Bethesda. Ill trade that any time of the day for a world with full of npc like in previous Fallout. Gameplay/fun above everything else. 
---
"Nothing is duped" lol, good one.
---
I don't bother locking the door to my main house in my camp because I'm not concerned about repairing anything and I like leaving a welcoming refuge to players. I have a small hut that houses my fusion generator next to my home and I do have the door locked on that, but only because I don't want mobs opening it and destroying my generator. (Why can hounds and other animals open doors??) The shutters are locked too so no ranged mob attacks are successful.
---
My camp is north of Vault 76, so I don't really worry about high level player damage either, and I like the idea that someone fresh to the game might've just come out of the vault and see what kind of thing they could build.
---
Really other than minor generator protection, the main use I've found for locks is in workshops. It helps limit the points of entry to buildings during defense events and makes it easier to set up turrets strategically. You can lock any doors as long as they are inside your workshop area, regardless of whether you placed the door or not.
---
There are also some workshops that have concrete for extraction, like Abandoned Bog Town has 3 I think. Some others have 1.
---
*aytracyed*. Really? 
---
Thanks for the advice! Will try that.
---
The disjointed dialogue of the vendor bots can be pretty hilarious.  Wallace, Resin, Blackwater Mine bot and Captain Kid always make me smile.  I actually LOLed the first time I heard them.  That dispassionate, pasted dialogue could be incredibly funny as a radio DJ.
---
You mean mediocre becomes good because of artificial scarcity. Great for grahm but to many, the world suffers from it. Many likes a world with npc like previous games.
---
I'm jealous!
---
Caps still seem like a decent reward. Since you can only collect 1400 caps from vendors it means something if you lose to much. Lose two many fights and you're set back a couple days. 
---
I think the amount you lose when you die should be standardized. I can see people creating twinks in an attempt to farm caps from higher level players. All while the higher level player has to risk more against what is, at least equipment wise, an equal matched player. 
---
I really love and appreciate your support ❤️
---
If it does not bother you to play with a lvl 15 guy id be down. PC btw
---
It'll drop from any Assultron at random.
---
My suggestion would be probably be to farm the 5-6 on the south west end of Watoga. 
---
&gt; I really want to just be able to wreck shop with a giant blade 
---
Also as far as this goes you'll probably be dissapointed when you realize it's only about the size of the revolutionary sword, shishkebab or Chinese officer sword. Basically any full sized 1h sword in this game it's damage is so-so and if you really want to go one handed you're probably better off just picking up the revolutionary sword plans off of the Whitesprings bot in black powder.
---
I mean Ig the Assultron blade is all black so if you want an "edge sword" you'd be golden? 
---
There is Light/sturdy/heavy version of every armor, you have heavy normal and light legendary armor probably.
---
Different types of armor have different damage resistances, like Leather, Combat, Marine, etc. They also come in types like Light, Medium and Heavy. That's why you'll see differences in their resistances.
---
Oh yes! Game breaking. Log in, see I’m hungry try to fix that, pip boy fails can’t move. But I can go to my map, but if I fast travel I still can’t move and next location. I have to log out and log in. 
---
I rather have a more fun world, interacting, talking to quest givers than 2 npc feeling godlike because of shortage Bethesda created.
---
theats my base too. i build stairs up to the lead. you have to be creative with your camp placement to hit both, but yeah the scorchedbeasts spawn every 3 minutes there, its nuts. they always attack my wires going up the mountain :(
---
Its a good 5-6 hour drive from DC to Greenbriar. Flying into Richmond would put you slightly closer and avoid tolls and the NoVa traffic.
---
XEdit says the only leveled list it appears on (as one of 24 items) is on a leveled list with two items (the other being quest reward melee recipes found in the Bog), which is on a list of all random quest reward recipes in the bog (including armor, chems, and food), which is directly referenced by Census Violence.
---
The other events in the Bog take it even further, with the recipe leveled list being part of the Bog's "grab bag" leveled list (which includes its weapon and armor reward lists twice each), which is part of the generic quest reward list shared by those events. Census Violence *also* references this list, so you have a slim chance of rolling for it twice on that event.
---
Certain other events (including Hunter/Hunted, powering up the power plants, clearing the missile silos, and Horde events) reference an "All Regions" grab bag list, which will randomly pull from one of the six regions' specific grab bag lists.
---
tl;dr: The Ultracite Gatling Laser is a tricky plan to hunt down. Census Violence gives the best odds, but it's still only a small chance to locate it.
---
I just wish I could eat robots and stuff like that 😥
---
And yeah I’ve got lvl 2 class freak, not enough points to go around into luck for level 3 though with my build sadly
---
I’m very happy with death claw island. When I was low level, I used him to give me the confidence to explore higher level areas. Testing new weapons and armor to test my might; once confident, I moved on to bunker buster! I actually still have my house located just south along that road. It’s my hometown now. Away from the chaos and away from the grind. A peaceful place to scrape, build and modify. 
---
funny how people never post which system they are on, on posts like this
---
No, he's terrible, just terrible.
---
Northwest region.
---
Solid argument. 
---
Now that was constructive thank you, dude you’re really not the only one who has life to deal with I’m recovering from a spine injury, so I’m either in rehab with pain or at home in pain, and honestly if I wanted an idea on how to get the answer I’d ask for an idea to obtain my answer not ask the basic question of how it works so sometimes trying to go above and beyond doesn’t actually help 
---
The dragon has a long load time making the actual dps less than a shotgun if you want to get technical. 
---
i whole heartedly agree with your accesment. 
---
Im also bummed out about the brotherhood. in the first 3 games they where absolute badasses cleaning up the wastelands. and this game there presence is so miniscule and there chumps who failed fo defeat the scorched. considering they where the most badass part of the franchise, ids a disappointment they were left out of this game almost entirety. 
---
fallout new Vegas was the last true fallout game. the new model is a souless doppelganger.
---
I'm sorry but if there customer service is as broken as the rest f there game surely that needs to go on this list as well?
---
I went there and had 2 spawn. One popped out of the ground, the second came out from behind the bus stop or shack or whatever that was. I went when I was level 60 something, and both of the deathclaws were level 70.
---
That first one looks oke some sort of alien planet-esque photo
---
Kent's storyline makes me sad every time I do a playthrough. 
---
Fuck yeah! A door! Take my money bethesda, I fucking love doors!....
---
Only two hours over encumbered, I've been like that for over a month now lol it's become a lifestyle choice 
---
Probably about four hours now lol
---
Just copy pasted it from yesterday
---
F.E.A.R. from 2005. It had very clever uses of the environment that tricked you into thinking the AI was slicker than it is. Other than that, I legitimately can't think of a game that does have REALLY good AI. 
---
" few thousand other people " ur so optimistic... not even thosand people play this game..
---
A lot of the butthurt is imaginary, just early fans that over-hyped this game to the point where it was never going to meet their expectations.  That being said, there are a great number of bugs that are very, very frustrating;  Bethesda has shown tremendous effort in dealing with them and working to improve the game though.  Still, a lot of folks read the first page, declared they didn't like it, and put the book down.
---
He's very clearly not alt-right. That's a generic label thrown around by those on the left, presumably like yourself, that are having a hissy fit.
---
There are legitimate "alt-right" individuals, but not everyone you disagree with or hate is alt-right. Get off your horse.
---
The *lusty assaultron maid* did the rounds on r/fallout a few years ago. Definitely NSFW. 
---
The missile launcher is great for killing other players as explosive damage bypasses DR and you can shoot homing missiles at them from afar with the targeting computer mod.  It's really great.  Only defense is fireproof perk and dense armor mods but since most people run PA then you don't need to worry about the latter.  Auto Grenade Launcher is also pretty dope but breaks really fast and isn't affected by bear arms for some reason.  It's great at killing players too.
---
Ammo for both is actually really easy to stockpile if you're using them as secondary weapons.  With ammosmith and super duper you can easily stockpile up so long as you maintain a steady spring supply.  Springs are the main limiting factor in all crafting whether it's repairing anything or crafting explosives.
---
just use the prototype space suit ? it's orange.
---
Fallout 4 felt very off and alot less Fallout style than the previous two. I would agree that 76 as much as i love the game is further down that path than even Fallout 4. 
---
Probably a stacking +3% more or less per chained bullet until bullet missed, what it was in fo4 my guess.
---
I read 10%, up to a cap at some point. The effect seems bugged to me though. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t, on my furious lever action. 
---
Well, um.. I shouldn’t have to constantly mule things back and forth when I need/don’t them, for one thing. For another thing, did they have a new update where weapon weight mods were introduced? Because I’ve never learned that mod for any of my weapons. I’ve got a few with a legendary effect that reduces their weight, but as far as mods go I haven’t come across any
---
#6 was a good tip though that I should implement a bit more , thanks!
---
My PSN is chaoscythe. My name is also Josh. We can go around joshing with everyone. 
---
I also would like to know this.  I found a Furious 10m   Is there are better use for my 10mm ammo than pump shots into a deathclaw?
---
That is the nicest thing anyone has said to me in a while. Alien/HR Giger has some of the most inspiring pieces of work. Cheers) 
---
I cannot confirmed if they fixed it or nor, but i feel like it is still not working as intended.
---
I have a TS Gauss and it misses a lot even at 95% in VATS.
---
It is a pain when you have a 95% Vats hit chance and not only do I miss but the bullet hits a car 10 feet away from the target.
---
Thanks for that.
---
Census Violence you say? That's a bit more fun than LITS. The players I know that have found the plan all say they got it from LITS.
---
The aesthetic of the atom shop is done for cloud pleasing and for the exclusive and intentional purpose of keeping it separate from the main game. If you are selling a PA paintjob, you might as well make it eyecatching and hence, 'wacky'. It's true for every game that sells skins; it keeps things fresh. I personally feel that this was a conscious decision based on what the current trends in gaming are. You will have noticed that story-wise, 76 goes way darker than any of the games did before. Even with its gritty undertones, 3 could not match the stories or murder and betrayal and other horrors of the wasteland that we see in 76. The tonal shift may also be partly due to the fact that the studio working on 76 is different, and I feel that once the original studio resumes work on Fallout 5 (which has quite possibly taken form in their minds at least to some extent), we will no longer see these 'wacky' things.
---
My TS rifle will miss a few shots in VATS, but not all of them by far. I have concentrated fire rank3 but no idea how that perk actually works
---
Well I'm glad I did bite the bullet and pick it up. I can't pass up a fifteen Dollar fallout game regardless. 
---
I could see mabye at 70 price point having a bit of a need to have more involved quests.. well a little bit more of everything heh. But that is why I held off myself till now. 
---
Thanks for the post. Was to the point and very informative at least as to what is been the general consensus at least in a manner I could read and understand. 
---
For that I thank you. 
---
It was only denied by the creators after it became a big question. Bethesda never would've said anything about it to begin with if it hadn't been made into a big deal.
---
He was reasonable for suggesting that it was possibly going f2p, as a company could possibly face lawsuits if they knew their product was going to be free but continued selling stock. Would they hold water? Maybe, maybe not, but litigation fee's exist, and more importantly - it would just be more bad press.
---
I'm sure a legendary piece at least identical to the non-legendary counterpart.  There are light/sturdy/heavy versions of most armors.  Maybe you're getting a light armor legendary and your heavy/medium is providing better resistance.
---
Many legendary armors provide superior effects, such as vanguard/bolstering (+35 dr at high or low health) or unyielding (+3 stats at low health) or mutants (+10 overall dr if you're mutated)  Keep in mind that individual pieces stack with each other.  A full set of vanguard armor, for example will net you +175 dr/energy resist over the normal resistance at full health.
---
There are also up to two other additional effects, including +1 stat boosts, weight reductions for junk, food or weapons, +50% durability, AP refresh boosts and sneak bonuses.
---
I have a light metal leg piece with chameleon, +1 AG and 20% weapon weight reduction.  I take a bit of an armor hit, but i think it's worth it for such a fantastic piece on a stealth rifle character.  Between two rifles, that one piece saves me 8lbs carry weight, I turn invisible when standing still and I'm harder to detect overall with the AG boost.
---
I don’t know about for you but I got the 10mm smg perfect storm at level 50 and it was great at ripping some hoards in two
---
 No problem! Have you tried getting a good shot near that crashed space station up north?
---
thx for the warning...what platform are you?
---
I personally like my junk extractor, always has screws, springs, or gears in it. Also has acid too sometimes. 
---
 My parents think Vault Boy is Tintin.
---
Assuming that it works the same on all ranged weapons, it's about 5% extra damage per shot, capped at around +30% max. Tested on Watoga robots. I heard it's ok to miss a shot as you hit the same target again within a few seconds, but I haven't tested that myself.
---
Even 200 dollars for the game that i paid, i still love it. Although i wish they let it bake for a further 5-6 months before placing it on the table for everyone to dig in to.
---
Give it another few months and i feel like the game will be 100% stable with almost all issues done and alot of content for as to delve into.
---
I’m willing to help
---
First nuke I experienced was at Morgan town and I feel like there was way more ghouls. So maybe Morgan town?
---
Still have my lvl 25, shoulda known better.
---
I've actually thought about that while I have been bulking items or making a ton of ammo. It would suck getting banned for just playing the game.
---
I’m down to help
---
Cool so it should still be decent against scorchbeasts 
---
Gauss aim is weird without VATS too. I eventually figured that it shoots on the dot when uncharged, but way high when charged. Maybe related.
---
Then he’ll dismiss any criticism that’s given to him as “fanboys” , and he just covers anything controversial or fake to get people angry
---
The thing for me was I just never got around to finishing that quest until around level 60 got it and loved it
---
Well I understand the pain thing unfortunately. It's a bitch. 
---
I get what you're saying about getting the long winded answer being annoying. 
---
The flip side is this thread will be buried forever in the morning and likely you won't get no answer. And what if you said yes and the next thing is we're interviewing cap sellers and it turns out to be a fun thing. That's my thinking at least.
---
I personally have a pet peeve where I ask for directions and someone gives me some sort of half-assed "I think it's its over there like 2 or 5 blocks maybe, or is it to the south".... It's like... "just say you don't know where it is so I can ask the next person.". So I guess I've become that guy. Fun

I had very few crashes of the game itself until this version.  I've tried updating my GPU drivers, but the issue persists.  I have no other stability issues as far as I know.  I have a separate AIO cooler on my CPU and GPU each, and my temps are very low, so that ain't it.  I run far heavier loads than this game without issue.
---
FWIW, I also run FO4 with around 240+ mods with little issue.
---
Whatever the previous version number was, I had very few crashes until now.  And compared to other people I know, I get fewer server disconnects.
---
I do remember seeing  another post like this a week ago. Did not think much of it but the mention of the spamming mass bulk causing server issues could be pinged as the same way as duping.
---
This seems like something that needs to be looked into. Please OP put a ticket in and keep the sub updated on this issue.
---
Did you appeal the ban? That sucks :( Thanks for the tip, though! I'll make sure to take my time bulking.
---
PC my bad
---
LITS *can* drop it, but there's no reason for it to do so more frequently than, say, AWOL Armaments or Monster Mash.
---
Same here. I don't even bother with gathering ore now.
---
No argument from me! I grew up with a Bullmastiff, then had my own, an English Mastiff in my teens and early 20's. Then bred British Bulldogs before my divorce. Then 10 years without,  then my new wife watched John Wick and 3 months later was surprised with a Beagle pup (she's now almost 4). Still have my English Mastiffs ashes on my window sill and miss her everyday! 
---
This is my Beagle Amber

I did not know that.

Nope, still refuse to believe that

Fallout from FO3 onward has always been grim with a side of wtf weird. In FO3 you had plenty of weird side quests like the vault full of clones or the tree that grew out of some dude's head. New Vegas had a trait called wild wasteland that added and changed random encounters to be more reminiscent of the dark humor from the first few Fallout games. The flying ship from FO4 is by far my favorite quest in that game. Imo, the weird humor and wacky stuff has always been there, it might just be taking more of a front seat now than it used to. But, that's not always a bad thing in a game world meant to be so depressing. I guess like all things, it's personal preference. 
---
i hope they bring back the blackbird skin in the shop. missed it as it was a 24H exclusive.....
---
Arent the "green storms" actually radiation storms?  In fo4 if you were outside during one, you gained rads without proper protection.  Figured it was the same here.
---
I was just giving an experience based on how I thought of it based on the wall of non stop posts and negative feedback in the media. Nothing more. 
---
I went in expecting garbage and got a gem. 
---
Mabye this was all you wonderful folks doing after all.. if you hadn't set my expectations so low for an entry point I might not have seen a gem either.. but rather a turd. 
---
Good food for thought. 
---
I doubt it. I just got 2-star and 3-star boards, back to back.
---
whell i'm glad that i found a lvl 50 furious gatling plasma to tear trough big enemy's. but as this post is about even with 200% durability and lvl5 gunnut for that slower dura loss, it still breaks after 3-4 cores thats like 1000 shots. and for a freaking gatling gun thats not much.
---
I had some guy tell me how it was intentional on Bethesda's party to discourage people spamming trades or some such bullshit. I personally think he was full of it, but if not, that has got to be the worst "fix" I've ever seen.
---
That's... That's about it.
---
This sub has descended into a true echo chamber, I wouldn't bother. You can't get better at r/Fallout either, since they're pretty heavily biased against 76.
---
Just let them jerk in their little circle.
---
Sure the comedy is cheesy and it has been pushed a bit in your face but if you read notes and terminals in the series it has always been there everywhere. I see the exact oposite with the grungy dark tones from the series. They used to be super in your face and have toned down a bit (although if you explore each city there are some pretty fucked up places, think of what happened at Vault-Tec University) and the notes and terminals hold a lot of the sadness and hopelessness we are used to from the classics. Again it is still there everywhere it just requires you to really delve into the lore.
---
I see NV as one of the darkest yet also the goofiest in the series (post Black Isle) so I don't think Fallout is loosing touch of the core of the series. It's just a balance. The main storyline in 76 starts you off listening to holotapes from dead people and the sadness and horrors they dealt with, how is that too wacky for you, mate? The moment you leave the vault you see a body that's just weeks old at most. Your trip towards Morgantown Airport is filled with looking for people you know are going to be corpses huddled in a corner and stories of people desperately gripping to the idea they can rebuild and survive. The excessive push for full automation in the Ash Heap causing massive waves of unemployment and riots (one of which caused a bombing). It's hopeless, the only "living" people are us.
---
Of course there are goofy stuff like Rose and the communist identification test but is that not something to expect from the series? Yes Man, Moira, Tabitha, No-Bark, Hancock, etc. We will always have goofy characters and goofy moments. 
---
Same, good two-three minutes sometimes a little longer if I'm unlucky.
---
I’ve found four so far. 2x two shot, one anti armor and one executioners. Looking to sell one of the TS. It’s level 50. Just the one effect.
---
Nice, good job.
---
You mean the black screen that 99% of the time if you wait like 5 minutes will fix itself. 
---
Your sad response is sad indeed. I hope one day you break the mold and stop with the counter strike and wow sayings and learn to utilize the English language in all its Glory. 
---
There are much more interesting and inviting ways with words to hurt and maim each other's internet "egos" 
---
Good luck on finding you a new path. One less used by the entire world. I'll point you in a direction.
---
God speed. 
---
So what you're saying is... We need more capes in the atom shop!
---
Man, that last one is just awesome.  Very Asylum/Sci-fi, if you get my meaning.
---
I mean, have the devs tried actually playing the game and do they personally not get annoyed by shit like this. Because i still have no clue how you would ever just let it fly that your game is still only half-loaded after it "loads".
---
Can always do it like WoW and stuff too, where you set the bar then each craft takes a couple of seconds
---
I would LOVE a ghoul version of Black Mountain radio
---
Yup, I almost want to believe its bugged because people were stating many patches ago that hey used to get all sorts of mods for the  T models.
---
That would work as well i mean more worried the OP got knocked up for it. But thinking of ways they could stop this issue for the futue as well.
---
I don't think either mods or plans exist for Buttressed. You'd need to find someone who's unlocked it by scrapping, and get them to mod it for you.
---
I meant weapon weight reducing legendary effect on guns and armor.. sorry I was not clear on that point
---
i only have the headgear of this XD
---
I mean most game's that came out before fallout 76 like red dead redemption 2 and cod bo4 have not had any content updates. I mean aside from nuketown for BO and that game came with a gamepass that people have got nothing from yet. Battlefield 5 deluxe gave players literally nothing for the weekly item for 20 weeks. has brought in almost nothing. For me stability has gotten a lot better. have not had one of these glitches you talk about in over 300 hours.
---
The team that is working on the game now seems to care and wants to fix things. you cannot expect them to fix stability issues and plug out new content. one thing has to be done at a time. I would actually prefer it that way. anybody that has over 300 hours by this point has been playing the game almost everyday for 5 hours plus. Then they turn around and complain their isn't enough to do. I don't know. I think people just complain to much.
---
We dont live him because he's an npc. We love him because he sells rare plans and is rng to find.
---
Could be anything else tbh
---
Isn't the damage on shotgun per pellet fired?  Sure a dragon may do more than a typical shotgun per round fired but when a shotgun can put 4 or 5 down range before you can fire a 2nd one.. the shotgun wins.
---
Thank the silicon god for google maps
---
People always talk about getting random invites or having players try to initiate either PvP or just team up. I've only ever been approached by higher level players wanting to give me things, and occasionally I've visited open bases while the owner was inside.
---
Oh crap, time to start hunting then lol
---
Yes use all values at 1 and 1024 for the minmipskip
---
Set large texture res to 2048 ( I tweaked a bit) 
---
Updates and recent patches have allowed for these changes with improved performance 
---
Not enough to justify their ammo cost.
---
This! And they should require bobbleheads to get a specific effect. Atm bobbleheads are no real use
---
You won't, was 1 day special in Atomic Shop... :-)
---
"Paladin TA-GER-DEE in command"
---
Lead is what I burn through constantly.  I keep 400 screws and springs in my stash and give away the rest in blue suitcases at Stations.  What are you using so much acid on?  I have 10 bulked and rarely use it unless I need to make gunpowder (with chemist and super duper perks swapped in)
---
It probably depends on your build and what you're interested in making.  When I was crafting armor to learn mods, I was always hunting down rubber, leather and plastic.  I recently got a quad/+25% fire rate tesla rifle that I want to use for Whitesprings nukes with a farming group, and now I'm always hunting for crystal to learn the automatic mod.
---
I heard 50% more to scorched, but it's only what I read on reddit ;)
---
It should be that you have to have to accept the bounty to hunt someone down, and as soon as you accept it you are falgged for pvp with the wanted guy,  right now the wanted player is at a huge disadvantage since he has to wait to be hit first, in the game one hit is all you need.
---
Have you noticed that it’s affected by pistol perks, I also got a pistol challenge once while using it 
---
Can’t you just find them at the space station?
---
Not everything should be balanced like you are imagining it should be. You figured out the way  do the most damage points to the fictional bad guys! Yay you win teh game! Now stop whining on reddit for buffs. It's cancerous.
---
Hmm, no, never noticed that. Weird.
---
so tl;dr - everything more than 20 INT is pointless?
---
It's pretty shitty.

I cant fathom why people still keep gathering junk when theyre wanted. The system sucks ass, but im going to use it if its there. And if you're stupid enough to keep a huge stockpile of junk on you while wanted, rethink your play style.
---
PvP is shitty right now, stash your shit if you don't want to lose it.
---
Based on my findings, yes. That was my goal. Lots of people selling “master crafted” armor with boosted INT but 20 is the effective max it seems.
---
Yup exactly why I'm asking this Q. I'm pretty sure it works like Berserker cause I don't feel any difference.
---
change it forr your prefs ini as well as your custom ini
---
Got 10 caps for my head by lockpicking t3 trailer in some other guy's workshop (Gorge Junkyard). Surprisingly, nobody came in like 10 mins. Switched server and decided to clean off my bounty just by waiting in some peaceful place - Lighthouse was my aim. By the way I found a bottle of burbon and was even happier, but when I climbed the Lighthouse, some fuckbuckethead in PA with Gauss twice higher level than me (88 vs \~42) didn't let me sit on top and have my last drink in fucking peace. Even more of that, when I came back (just to pick some flowers and stuff) he was still there and tried to snipe me, but failed due to my pacifist on. 
---
If he felt righteous - congrats on being a total ass fighting much lower level player with measly 10 bucks bounty.
---
I’m sure slowly there should be npcs back I mean in the story we kill the queen and clean most of the scorch reproduction so I think if they keep the story going we should see a few npcs making their way into Appalachia maybe looking for a new home or just passing by 
---
Agreed, Fallout is suppose to primarily be a dark survival game with the occasional gallows humor thrown in. The "whimsical" nature of the Vault boy clips should be viewed for what they really were...social propaganda used to lurk people into horrifically cruel, unethical and morally reprehensible human experimentation.
---
They murdered families and killed children, experimented on babies...Vault-Tec should be listed near the top of Organizations that have committed crimes against humanity. 
---
Yet like you said, its appears Beth wants to turn this into a joke. The people that are attracted to a game like this, like the dark narrative. It scares us to think that history could have taken a much darker path than it did.  It is a post apocalyptic world where ALL humans are DEAD.  Stop trying to backtrack and put all this Care Bear fluff into the game. 
---
It is like a Dark Gritty movie has been made and your mind was blown. You go to see the sequel and for some reason they turn this into a musical comedy....just why? 
---
As long as one-shotting is a thing PVP will never be viable or fun. And slap back while being wanted is silly as well, you'll always be at a disadvantage.
---
I think the clean one is different.
---
Do you have the perk strange in numbers? Were you in a party and your teammate was offline? If yes, just disband the party and it should be fine again. 
---
Do you mean *Jacobstown*?
---
Indeed.
---
I recall sneaking up on a group of super mutants and overhearing the conversation:
---
M1: This place suck. Wish we were still at Airport. Airport better than this place.
---
M2: We not at airport because you shoot boss, Why you shoot Boss?
---
M1: Boss made me angry. Boss Dumb.
---
M2: You should not shoot Boss. Boss be Boss.
---
Not the exact conversation, just what I remember.
---
That moment made me wish there were more NPC's with real character and stories I could interact with. Dumb Robots, monologues via Audio-logs and notes can only take you so far into the world, without two way conversation the world feels half there.
---
Grahm, is that you?
---
Good to know - I have base INT 13, got 2 pieces of armor with +1 int, always Brain fungus soup in a stash and berry mentats, which gives me 21 INT.
---
It doesn't make sense why they added Graham but refuse to put other NPC's in.
---
Only reason I can think of is either it raises technical issues they can't handle (having too many npc's) or they just felt it was against the atmosphere they were trying to create.
---
I'd be fine with a non combat pet to walk around with like in ESO, and with all the mutations there should be plenty of variety
---
Sign me up for a shih tzu! Need a wasteland version of my little irl fuzz-loaf, Josh!
---
It’s okay I was really just messing with you. Regardless though, good legendary armor with weight reduction effects don’t tend to grow on trees yknow. RNG with legendaries in general is very much hit or miss in this game. Now, since the white springs nerf it’s even harder finding good 2-3 star legendary combat or marine armor (aka the 2 armor types I prefer to use, marine being my favorite) but anyway, point is RNG is rough and finding good legendary armor to buy from someone is kinda rare. I don’t even mess with whitesprings much now, I mainly just like trying my luck with the scorch queen(and some other events)
---
Crazy how plasma and laser switched positions in this regard.
---
Heavy weapons are fine with perks, my heavy gunner character is my main for farming as he just shreds huge groups of ghouls in seconds. Problem is the Gatling gun is the only one worth using other against scorched beasts because of the barrell charge up time
---
Google? *steps up soap box* I don't know about Google. I mean, is it really wise to give one company so much information? And why's all their stuff free? How do they make money? And what's all these controversies about data sharing? Who are they under all those pretty little cartoons they put on everything? Do they really "do no evil?" *prattles on for an hour*
---
I agree most heavy weapons could do with a round of buffing (especially LMGs which seem obviously inferior on paper much less in practice). I melt everything with a .50 cal though and I don't even have full % damage perks for heavy weapons yet.
---
Pokechamp5611 we share the same account just diffrent people 
---
Bethesda lost this fallout fan with fo76.
---
They might not have been duping.  Serums don’t take that much to make.  The hardest thing to find are the fluxes and Ultracite, if they were farming the Queen fluxes and Ultracite can stack up pretty quickly.
---
What makes you think it'll go f2p, or is this merely a rant?
---
Hahahahaha gah dude awesome 
---
Because the rug really ties the room together
---
What's the mod?
---
Different gangs have different codexes. My raiders attack any and all high value targets.
---
They already denied this rumor started by the youtuber The Quarting or what ever it is.
---
Now my question is, as it is damaged does it lose its armor bonus or does it always stay higher and can this same effect happen from the 200% repair perk?
---
I just bulked a bunch of stuff today and I hammered the keyboard to get it done. Are you saying speeding up mundane tasks can get you banned? Man I will be pissed if I get banned due to poor game functionality 
---
Please do not post this directly in the title! Thank you!
---
New char because nerfed experience reward. New content coming this month. Otherwise, too bad
---
Lol i tought this was already patched, since i no longer have this problem. vats just do not target players for me if i'm in pacifist.
---
Does legendary light and medium armor drop more frequently than legendary heavy armor?
---
No, standard Excavator helmet.
---
Just usd Rad-X to supress all your mutations for 10 min. After that they will work again.
---
If you have plans for any marine armor piece, use at least Armorer 2 perk (decreased material cost), Super Duper and Scrapper (increased yield on scrapped resources) perks to fabricate a bunch of pieces.  The level of the piece doesn't matter, so make the lvl 35 version for reduced resource drain.  The learned mods seem to carry over to all pieces (ie, I learned asbestos lining, which is a chest only mod, from scrapping arm pieces).  I don't personally use marine armor, but I've definitely learned all the mods available.  I'm assuming buttressed is the highest DR?  I wanted to be able to make the best kitted out pieces and custom mod bespoke legendaries as a service for friends and visitors to my camp.
---
I'm not sure if I've learned buttressed mods, but I've scrapped hundreds of marine pieces and I'm sure I have all the learnable mods.
---
I'll be happy to kit out your armor for free (xp is cool and I have very little to use scrap on aside from making more ammo after a nuke).  Shankwell on PC.
---
Quarterpounding is clickbait!
---
It's caused by the mats being split between your character and stash..
---
Put it all in one place and it should work. 
---
*glances over at my girlfriend who uses her atoms on the clothes*
---
I'm guessing her.
---
It’s a hard life my dude, sometimes I find myself dreaming I’m at a base in an electric chair they actually have working so I can commit character suicide once I’ve finally had enough
---
Just alt f4 when they start trashing it
---
Amazing thanks for the tip!
---
Congrats and welcome to the Wasteland 👍🏻
---
Yea they said fo76 is not going f2p just as they said there will be no lootboxes and the microtransactions will only be cosmetic.
---
Guess wat!Dataminers are discovering lootbox files that give Carryweight , Damage and radresist boost.
---
Reinstall and using the regular screen has worked! I still don't get audio dialogue but I can get subtitles now which is a big step up. Who knew how much I was missing!! Thank you so much
---
Only instanced locations.
---
wow, thanks!
---
Thanks for answer
---
I have even felt a bunch of legendary weapons are incredibly underpowered. Though there are a few good weapons when modded can be pretty good. Like Fire Axe with spikes mod and 200% durability is pretty good. I'm sure there are a bunch of others.
---
Im on ps4, but thank u . I was wondering if i need to craft legs cause legs are missing buttressed. I happened to know chest piece so im gonna try that
---
All of my counts reset when I dced.
---
but how many Turrets do you have?
---
i use acid to break down ore. I find tons of of, especially lead
---
Well it's in the forest. If you want high level deathclaws there's other guaranteed spawns
---
I wouldnt belive a word that guy says. In that last video his eyes where flackering all over the place. He basically said that he did not belive Bethesda.
---
What amazes me in his videos are his followers eating everything he says raw.
---
Ahh makes sense. If nobody gets the loot or xp though, why put down the camp? Just to be a arse?
---
I feel like i have seen a youtube video recommending people do this?
---
Junk. 100% I can farm metal from bots and guns, but screws and springs are the real commodity.
---
All the evidence points it will go f2p.First of all , Bugthesda denied the game will go f2p , wich is already a sign it WILL.They also denied the fact lootboxes wont be in da game and wont give actual bonuses but now dataminers are discovering lootbox files that give carryweight , damage and rad resist bonuses.
---
2nd of all the whole system of fo76 would work great as a f2p microtransaction game , look at the perk packs.
---
3rd and finally the game going f2p would be a great excuse for it being buggy , broked , contentless and boring.
---
you can also check challenges - one in World tab is how many hours you spend in Appalachia out of 7600.
---
Three. Two machine guns, one shotgun.
---
Were they counting before hand?
---
Is that a RAD storm in the last pic? I havnt seen one since Beta D:
---
Jeremy Hambly in fact IS a pretty scummy human being 
---
Sadly i am on Xbox, thank you for the offer though!
---
Summersville, noted. Will look it up and have a hunt. Appreciated!
---
The thing is, Fix It Good does nothing when crafting the armor initially...but as soon as you REPAIR it, after it's taken its first bit of damage, you get 200% condition just as if you'd had 20+ INT all along. With that increase in condition comes the increase in Damage Resistance. (Weapon Artisan does the same thing for Melee weapons. You still get higher condition on Ranged, but no increase in Damage.)
---
All you really need is enough INT to equip the cards you can fight without (for me, that's 9 INT for Gunsmith (5), First Aid (3), and Scrapper (1). With this much INT, I can swap in all my crafter perks and get 200% condition on weapons and armor as needed.
---
The first time I met Grahm he was being slammed by a Scorchbeast! I was only level 15 so when I tried to help him I was promptly annihilated. 
---
Hold my Nuka Cola, I’m going in!
---
Seems like a Jeremy fanboy
---
You should get a tse 50. Those things shred the sbq so fast
---
Sadly I'm on PC. :(

Whitesprings friend
---
Static recipe spawns
---
95% sure I picked mine up from there
---
Why the hell are people like you giving a Youtuber so much exposure?
---
Free PR for him.
---
I can’t watch his videos... the way he moves his head and can’t make eye contact with the camera just makes him come off as disingenuous and shady... I wouldn’t call him alt-right but he seems to think of himself as some great game journalist despite not appearing to have much journalistic integrity. And to be honest about fallout76 YouTube videos 99% of them are complete garbage just tryin to take advantage of people hating in FO76. Don’t get me started on CleanPrinceGaming either... go watch some commentary-free gameplay videos and then try games out yourself. I have yet to find an unbiased “game reviewer”... there’s either IGN guys who don’t know what they’re talking about and there’s the guys who wish they had the audience of IGN and just trash them all day... it’s so high school that I’m done with it all. /rant
---
I never understud why everyone refuses to talk in this game. It's hard for Bethesda to make a fun game since the community is purposly acting anti-social.
---
&gt; Anything TSE that isn’t a minigun or a shotgun is rubbish. 
---
Lol, this is just not true at all. Handmades, Radium Rifles and the Gatling Gun are extremely strong with TSE. Maybe even more flexible than the shotgun because you can shoot one round at a time instead of always 8 and this it's easier to use in CQC. Make them automatic and you got an extremely strong weapon that consumes almost no ammo because they do close to 500 damage per shot.
---
This is very much true and should be kept in mind. Once the games been out for 6 months I feel certain they’ll have the game in the state they SHOULD have released it in
---
Til then they’ll just be quiet while they develop the game and introduce new content at the same time, can’t blame em, it’s kinda what I’d be doing in their situation lol
---
I guess it never hurts to triple check the Whitespring. Good thing my CAMPs really close to it lol
---
Gave it a crack, and get downvoted for it haha. I feel like some people are just toxic for the sake of it, downvoting every comment.
---
I frequent the fifa reddit, so im used to it! Had a ridiculous pack, and my post got downvoted into oblivion because of people who were jealous
---
Stealth vats crit rifles is the most powerful build. It's not the toughest, but my buddy does more damage to the scorch beat queen than 5 other people combined.
---
I see no lootboxes in game and the atom store is cosmetic only. The data miners found lunchboxes it does not show if they were cut content or even the idea of the future event rewards they once talked about. Remember the buff idea hmm?.
---
Alot of content gets cut and changed and we do not base things on what data miners find bud. 
---
May change the description to Ultracite Calibrated Dynamo because the Ultracite Calibrated Shocks plan are indeed the shocks.
---
My weightless armour seems to work fine. Doing a vats shot with the dragon however misses every time
---
Thanks for the info
---
I'm a huge fan of mid-century decor and modern art.
---
The best sources of plans are other players and checking Wallace at Harpers Ferry and the two Watoga vendors, who tend to sell the more interesting camp plans, then server hopping if they don't have them.  There's no foolproof way to get a specific plan, unfortunately.  The "nixie lights" plan is my favorite.  Buy it immediately.
---
As a fellow fan of mid-century art, add me to your friends list and I'll keep an eye out for modernist plans to give you for free as I find them.  Shankwell on PC.
---
Alternately, ask me to group with you and I can travel to your house and add all the modernist plans I know to your house.  It would actually be amusing to have an in-game client asking me to move something just a scooch to the left while drinking wine at noon or if I could change the color of the orange stained glass bits in a reclaimed church window to something a little more red.
---
Have you found any level 62 ghouls?
---
Read the damn news before you post. Bethesda have stated unequivocally that the game is *not* going free to play. 
---
Yes there may be loot box files but that could have just been for the developers 
---
And his AI made him try to anticipate where you were running so he'd constantly pass you running, then run to where your crosshair is and stop. If you are running long distances he'd run up and stand in front of you every 10 feet so you have to run around him or trick him by moving the crosshair somewhere far away. Drove me nuts...
---
Yea just like they stated there are not going to be any lootboxes.Rn the dataminers found lootbox files that would give damage , rad resist andcarryweight bonuses.
---
Yea well then why were they ADDED in an update after the release of the game???
---
Fast treveling or entering/leaving building fixes it as well.
---
Yea well then why were the files ADDED after the release of the game???
---
You can also upgrade to the Brotherhood of Steel paint on Combat Armor to make it the best it can be. Just remember, if what you looted doesn't *seem* as good as what you're wearing, check out what the stats are if you upgrade it to BOS and repair it with **Fix It Good**. If what you're wearing is over 100% condition, it gets a DR bonus from that, too.
---
Lever Action and Hunting rifle combo, neither are Legendary. But I'd kill for a decent 3 🌟 Legendary Handmade to fill in and replace the Lever action. 
---
A good Legendary Hunting rifle would be nice... but RNGesus doesn't see fit to bless me with the Phat Lewtz or I suck at finding them...
---
I'd say yes, especially in non-endgame areas.
---
Hey now! Grahm saw a void and filled it, what's grahm going to do when the world is full of other people and he starts losing profits? Do we really want to see grahm living in the gutters of grafton, offering a piece of chally steak for a little bit of jet?!
---
Have they been implemented? No, they haven't. They're likely legacy code that hasn't been removed yet. 
---
True i guess 
---
Why were they ADDED after the release of the game then????
---
The thing you are missing is that becoming wanted is a punishment designed to be enjoyable for the bounty hunter, not the player that is wanted. It isn't part of the core PvP element. That's why shooting somebody doesn't make you wanted but killing them anyways, when they don't want to engage in PvP does. 
---
I mostly use handcrafted weapons. I don't get a lot legendaries. But they still get the job done. 
---
Kudos to you for trying.  I think my first scorchbeast encounter was around lvl 40 and I went through 20+ stimpaks, a handful of radaway and a couple med-x.  I limped away with an entirely broken suit of armor and spent a lot of caps on bulk ballistic fiber.
---
White Knight perk in AG tree makes a huge difference with armor durability.  Even just one rank is a noticeable improvement.
---
I’m using my jetpack rn with no mutations or anything too. But it definetly burns through your fusion cores quickly. Maybe you can’t see it because all you do is jetpack on a roof from time to time like I do. But pay attention to the fusion core charge when you jetpack. It’s ridiculous. So as soon as I get the mutations I’m definetly going to equip Poweruser as I’m gonna use the jetpack a lot more often. 
---
They probably planned to add them, and then realised it would be a stupid idea and canned it. 
---
Agreed. I just feel like at level 100 I'm not going to make anything better than my 3* legendaries... And crafting has Always been a cool parr of these games prior to this title.  
---
Lol I cant believe how you still trust them lol.WE CANT BE SURE OF ANYTHING BUGTHESDA SAYS AND WE SHOULDN'T TRUST THEM.
---
They were not added after the game release, they were found in beta days. The change was the atx line to each. We cannot know their reason to this. If you choose to believe the doom and gloom we cant correct that.
---
Nope not me. Looks like from a couple sources they are gonna do an unban wave on a warning. Deffinetely curious to see if anyone got any kind of a response. 
---
&gt;Only thing I can think of is launching the nuke crashed a bunch of people. 
---
Last weekend I had two instances of me getting disconnected from the server during the nuke countdown, so I think that's a possibility.
---
There's nothing wrong with 1 point but I wouldn't put more in. 1 grants 5% extra damage but 3 only 7%. Adrenaline, Bloody Mess, Weapon Damage or Armor Penetration perks are much better.
---
Not sure why you think you know everything. You know as little as everyone else. 
---
I just added as friend my GT: PedalingPrimate
---
I will drop him some stuff later. 
---
what you using all this acid for? refining? gunpowder? 
---
Yeah that's cool sometimes. I mean, i think speed running is rad, especially when it makes use of crazy glitches. Or people that try to find bugs for a bounty. Bethesda should open a bug bounty for people that find game breaking glitches like this dupe. $2000 (number outa nowhere) to submit the glitch and sign something saying they won't reveal it.
---
The duping thing only bugs me because it devalues caps and apparently fucks up the servers. If it was just some people duping and there was no currency involved I don't think id care this much. But I want the cap currency to be legit. I mean, I have no idea how money really works but I know you have to trust it and i don't trust caps anymore cause duping has messed up their value... i think. 
---
I'm on PS4 and can mod if you're hard up. I just pick up every piece if armor I find for scrapping. Armor mods are hard to learn, but I think I have every scrapped mod for every armor. Check every queen, scorched, wendigo, honey beast, etc. The can all drop basic armor to scrap.
---
If I see a low level player, say &lt;lvl 35 I fast travel to them.
---
Emote a hello and starting talking over the mic.
---
Sometimes they can talk back and other times I just ask them to acknowledge they can hear me with a thumbs up.
---
That’s when I explain the whole wanted system, passive mode, don’t open locks at camps or hack terminals and or be careful of owned workshops.
---
Then I offer to remove their wanted status, tell them to take of the armor so it doesn’t get damaged and give them extra stuff if I can access my stash. 
---
Have even helped out some of them with modding their weapons!
---
As for high level players, well they are fair game and open season I say...
---
Yeah im def gonna do that from now. I got hardened for marine legs now. But i think buttressed is better def
---
I think it's entirely random.  I've easily killed 1000's of legendary enemies hunting for a 2-shot handmade rifle (1 star is fine, I don't want explosive for a close range rifle) and still haven't gotten it.  I've gotten many 3 star armor, 3 star melee weapons, 3 star gatling guns and various other nice items of all kinds, but never my little grail of a 1 star handmade 2-shot.  
---
Well, if you don't find it, I can drop it in your camp for you
---
Tis a shame that I'm a console peasant and I'm pretty sure there's no cross platform play, otherwise I would be thrilled to take you up on that offer (if not just as an excuse to drink all that wine I have in my stash box). Still, it's always great to meet somebody who appreciates mid-century designs! And your suggestions are pretty helpful, too. I've never considered server hopping, and I feel a bit stupid for not thinking of that myself. I'll definitely look into those vendors!
---
&gt;everyone loves graham
---
That's just a generalization, I don't care about NPCs unless they sell me good plans or have caps that I can trade for. I could care less if he was voiced or not. Supermutant or robot.
---
Oni didn't realise that. But if I type one word sometime it turns it into two entirely different words I don't get it.  Only thing I can think of is that I got my keyboard on multilanguage so it does English and dutch at the same time. Maybe it got some problems with that. 
---
Buttressed is the best yeah. Data mining shows no plans available for buttressed.
---
Honestly in pvp all skills should be negated and weapons damage should be reduced to absolute base damage.... then we get the bitching pvp battles we looking for 😆
---
Let’s say a handmade round does 100 damage. 
---
A handmade perforating mag has potential to deliver 20 rounds, or 2,000 damage. 
---
A bloodied handmade with good recoil and hip fire on a rad build will deliver 3,800 damage (180/round), in one 4 second burst most or all of which ends up in the target. 
---
A two-shot will _theoretically_ deliver 40 rounds, or 4,000 damage. 
---
But in reality, tour two shot sprays it all over the screen and hits maybe a quarter to a half of the 40 (20 double) 100/round shots it fires. 
---
 Ever mind maintaining one continuous 4 second burst on the target with it being a fantasy. 
---
It’s a prissy spray and pray weapon. Yay that you can kill weak enemies with the occasional shot you can hit. And yay on you being able to use it as a melee weapon from point blank and even hit most of them. 
---
But on the whole; it’s an inelegant piece of rubbish for people who can’t fps. 
---
Sorry bud.
---
hahahahahahhha 
---
another score for the bethesda QA team. 
---
This, and there's 4 in blackwater mine in the uranium fever room by Charlie
---
I've had the same issue happening a few times, along with it ignoring keyboard inputs for little bursts too which causes me to wander off uncontrollably. I have a razer mouse. Maybe it's possibly something to do with their hardware
---
Ok , so its scrapping the next few days
---
That's sick
---
Alright Ill be on later Ill go onhis file then mine to sort out rewards
---
You have to go inside and reboot the system in the computer if that helps. I've never had it bug it but who knows with 76.
---
Robot ones working for me but the flowers isn't.. I know I've gotten 3 of them fully and sometimes it shows 9/10 and then you look again and it shows 0/10..annoying since its a really easy challenge! 
---
Can we stop feeding the troll ? Seriously guys, you should know by now
---
I will check into it. Yesterday I found a parcour thing in the forest region and on the final high placed tower there probably waits a surprise also. However I try to do it about 50 times and I had to give up. It is impossible for me.
---
Two shot on a shotgun only adds one extra pellet
---
proof?
---
Can youtube shut down a channel for posting glitches? My instinct, which I shouldn't listen to but I'm too lazy to research this, is telling me that his channel would be protected under some journalism/consumer advocacy/free speech thing
---
Or it's night time and my nocturnal explosive level action can blow their heads odd. 
---
Oh? That’s awesome. 
---
I've gotten used to shooting the turret with an exploding weapon as soon as I hear scorched. They die just fine. I also don't repair it immediately when it does break. Milk that timer for 30-40 seconds and you'll spend a lot less steel.
---
Xbox sorry I forgot to add it in
---
This video is for Fallout 4, but it's really the same thing. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-2hPDPRIj4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-2hPDPRIj4)
---
Looks like you guys have the Right Stuff
---
You are just wrong on all accounts, I've been using a TSE automatic handmade for weeks.  
---
1. It does 528 damage per shots with all damage perks.
---
2. With the drum mag you can have 85 rounds in one magazine, that is over 44'000 damage for one magazine (before reduction)
---
3. If you scope in your accuracy increases dramatically. I had my CAMP at the top of the highest building in charleston and could hit any enemy i saw in any direction from max distance with no problem.
---
4. If you hold in the trigger and use hip fire yeah they will go all over the place, if you scope in and fire in short bursts you practically hit every bullet you fire. My friends have trouble killing scorchbeasts in the air with their explosive shotguns but i kill them in less than 8 hits.
---
5. It one-hits every enemy below level 62 and two-hits anything above that
---
You don't have to be sorry, clearly you have not tried this weapon at all. It's very ammo conservative because you one-hit every enemy you run across and you can craft x36 5.56 per craft so you can make plenty of ammo. It's extremely easy to maintain a continuous fire while scoped in on big enemies. I miss maybe 2 or 3 shots when autofiring on a landed scorchbeast, and this is from like 30 meters away.  
---
You don't have to explain to me how the weapon is bad because clearly you have no idea what you are talking about.  
---
Maybe I'm not following.
---
I have a Gatling Plasma showing 91. I have a Bloodied Gatling Plasma showing 143. They have identical mods. I have Adrenal Reaction.
---
91 != 143
---
Explain please.
---
Has that happened before to someone posting exploits? 
---
I love the libertarian bot! 
---
Addiction can lower stats, and doesn't show in the status section. Try an addictol.
---
Ah okay. Sorry, PS4 here. If you have any stealth perks I'd highly recommend just trying to sneak your way through it. 
---
Ooooh is that why my pc spawned in then couldn't move at all lol.
---
Now I know why.
---
OP, exactly how much did you bulk up?  Like, did you do 100s or 1,000 of something?
---
I really like the White Knight perk too, but now I never do face the Scorchbeast unless I am in power armor.
---
Do you mean the prototype hazmat suit?
---
I’m gonna have to try lol thanks anyway
---
Dunno if you played Fallout 4 but there is a cult called Pillars of the Community that tries to scam you in loosely similar way
---
Better idea. Store your arch. Log out. Then back in. When you place it back it should be back up to full health. 
---
Yeah, I’m gonna need sources and documentation before I believe this
---
Ok personally I hate Graham. He's fucking annoying as hell. He's like Dog but worse. The random ramblings get very repetitive very fast.
---
The real problem is how damage resistance works in this game. The "more fire rate, less damage" would work if the residtance scaling works the same way... except it doesn't.
---
When you gain damage resistance, the first few points will mitigate damage by a large amount before the benefit decreases as DR increases. When you shoot very high damage, single bullet, you have the "momentum" to across over that heavy DR at the beginning. Now if you spread that same damage over smaller hits with multiple bullets, every bullet gets hit with heavy DR - meaning spreading your dmg over bullets (rate of fire) causes you to get penalised by DR harder. Which is way there is insane performance disparity between heavy single hit vs. Low dmg, high rate of fire weapon. 
---
Yes, as it gets to 100% or lower, the DR bonus shrinks to normal, and stays there until you're able to repair it to 200% again.  
---
100% to 1% has the normal DR. Above 100% has a DR bonus that scales with the percentage.
---
Same level and perks? I tested it with a Bloodied, Furious &amp; Anti-Armor Handmade. Can add screenshots soon.
---
I'm going to guess that pvp shenanigans may have frustrated some people. Also, do you know if there is a way to mute individual players in game? 
---
Ohhh... you’re playing rifleman (with commando perk and auto receiver). Right. 
---
If you scope in and do short burst, your DPS is a fraction of a build that can twitch-kill mobs, without losing half a second to scopeing, holding down auto fire for any number of seconds. 
---
Your way has you kill a mob in 4 times as long as my way. 
---
In other words. By the time you cleared one fifth of a building, I’ll have cleared the remaining 80%. In that time, my DPS, running aiming and reloading accounted for, will be 4 times yours. 
---
Reeee don't call my shitty ideology shitty
---
Wood armor from free states is the shrouded mod for wood armor.
---
Your combat armor scrapping, I’m not sure what you expected to happen? Scrapping armor has a low chance of unlocking any mod for that weapon, which it sounds like that happened. 
---
Its around 250 (depending on charisma) if you find it at the Responder Vendor-Bot .. dont get yourself scammed. If you pay more than 1000 caps, you are stupid.
---
i never heard of him before the free to play rumors. As a real life Journalist, it's outraging for me see how an idiot can freely talk nonsense about rumors and affect even mainstream videogame sites, which don't even check on the news. I would encourage everyone to criticise these behaviors and eventually stop following people that spread fake news. 
---
Playable
---
Super
---
MUTANTS
---
This also happened to me today.  I died before I could ever see what killed me.  Then I reload and tried to run. Won't let me pull out my weapon.  I'm rapid firing left trigger and right trigger and nothing.   Constantly getting hit and can't see an enemy. Died again so I waited and finally 2 deathclaw loaded.  3rd time I was able to regroup and come back for them.
---
Same level and perks.
---
What's your PSN?
---
White knight in agility is one of must haves. Also if you have like me 100 super stimpacks from farming queen traveling pharmaci is great perk card to have. With  Marsupial mutation you should have Bird bones (also better ap regen and sneak from those +4agi).
---
I got if from the queen
---
Ah you obviously are a child.  There should be an age limit on forums like this.  Have a nice day at school.
---
If you have starched genes maxed out, they stay forever. 
---
I bought plans for my Camp and learned them, they're still locked and when I bought a duplicate it says they're already learned. I've made 3 or 4 tickets with Bethesda and nothing has been done.
---
Cool thanks for answering
---
Stats says it’s 15% food, so that checks out...
---
Are they still buggy?
---
If you have starched genes maxed and out it on after you get the mutation, the mutation stays. If you take Radaway or jump in the shower without the perk on, you’ll likely lose the mutation(s). 
---
I have an instigating lever action rifle. With all my perks, I can one shot kill a lvl91 deathclaw in sneak mode without a fuss. The most cost effective weapon!
---
the bug appeared in the most recent patch claiming to have fixed 150 bugs.
---
Where does it say, that it's not a hoarding game, though? They never really expressed themselves in this regard. Why is it wrong to play the game differently from other players? Soccer is not a very good example, because we know the rules in advance, but here.. it's a survival game, just like you said.. which means that there are no rules. One may choose to run around every session looking for specific locations that spawn Stimpacks, load videos like "Best place to farm plastic!" on YT, while other will login and go straight to his business, because he prepared in advance. It's a choice really, and saying that I'm "playing the game wrong" is.. just plain weird.
---
are you sure? I got a bounty after killing one guy with a bounty who was closed inside his house.
---
nope, 200 hours i never knew that for 1 minute
---
nvm... Just had to equip the bloodied one - they were just in inventory similar        
---
      
---
Sorry for the confusion !
---
Wiping all legendaries and stocks will destroy the game. I worked my ass of for what i've got and, actually, working towards that total unyielding set is what keep me playing this game.
---
And let's be honest, the majority of dupers just duped for their friends or perhaps to get some caps. They took a short cut in the game and ultimately this only impacts their own gaming experience (asin, either making it no challenge whatsoever, or remove any work, and the reward if you completed something)
---
The main issue now are the guys who are cash sellers, they are ruining the game because any cash that goes there way is cash that potentially is NOT going to Bethesda, and is NOT going into further development of the game.
---
I never really got into ore farming or claiming workshops.  I feel like ore is a bit of a sink, as it requires other resources to refine (Super Duper perk helps considerably, lvl 50 luck perk).  Exploring and collecting tagged items (rat poison, paint cans, soup cans and combination wrenches for lead as an example) seems to be a more efficient method for me.  I also get to gain xp, caps and stay active while looking for resources.  I think if a workshop extractor had at least 4x the yield speed, I'd be encouraged to invest the time into maintaining and defending it.  The other day a buddy and I claimed the converted munitions plant with a fusion generator attached to the ammo fabricator and I was fairly disappointed with the yield.  I could farm way more .45 ammo just wandering around various raider locations in Savage Divide in the same amount of time.  If I were using .50 ammo, which is really uncommon, doing the same thing with emphasis on steel, lead, cloth and acid, I'm sure I could make way more ammo in the same amount of time with Super Duper, Ammosmith and Chemist perks swapped in.
---
Can we bring back that robot making thing from automotron? As far as someone to talk to goes, that's good enough for me.
---
 *Ground Control to Major Tom*
---
You've had numerous responses to this particular claim. Maybe it's time to lay it to rest.
---
Easyest way to get want you want is mutation serum drink them, then put Stange gene in and you have it. 
---
Second way
---
Never use radaway to get mutations. Use decon arc and look for toxic water. strange gene off, go into the water get a mutation. If you want this mutation put Stange gene in,if not go under the arc. Change server and repeat. 1 mutation per server. 
---
Of course I am, why would I not use the most optimal perk setup?  
---
DPS doesn't matter when enemies die in one hit. And when it does matter the enemies are so big it's impossible to miss them. And "fraction" is just a straight up misrepresentation, the difference is really not that big at all. Did you also miss the part where it one-shots mobs at 62 or below? Why would I need to hold down autofire for any number of seconds when twitch-killing mobs?  
---
you can still kill enemies with a single hip-fire shot, you only lose much accuracy when you start spraying. Like I said, if I one-hit kill any mob at level 62 or below how does that take 4 times longer? Reloading takes literally faster than a second with the reload speed perk and speed demon. And keep in mind we are now talking the top 1% of damage, clearing in 20 seconds or 19 is not important at this stage. A weapon isn't trash because it doesn't do absolute maximum possible damage, you're one of those classic reactionary gamers where everything is either "garbage trash" or "op".  
---
And all of these numbers, 80%, 4 times, again 4 times, are all numbers pulled out of your ass so you can feel like you are doing more damage than anyone else. Get off your high horse and stop making everything a competition, two weapons can be OP at the same time. Truth is any TSE weapon will outclass any standard weapon with 2 modifiers atm, after the nerf they will still be incredibly powerful.  
---
Clearly you are a person who has trouble being called out as wrong. I am not saying you are not doing a lot of damage with your weapon but you clearly have no idea how the handmade works and you are clearly just making up numbers so you can feel like you didn't say anything factually incorrect, lol.
---
Lmao, if only you knew.   
---
Seems weird that nobody can answer my question though. 
---
I'd settle for a town of super mutants in bikinis taking turns wrestling in shallow pools of FEV. 
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/214
---
I actually agree a lot with what you're saying.
---
The thing with post-apocalyptic media is that few people genuinely want the utter hopelessness that a real post-apocalyptic story would probably be like. I mean, if you read up on estimates of just how many people would actually survive an apocalyptic event...then think about what sort of life they would lead - how they would spend their time, what sorts of hopes and dreams they would cling onto - it's definitely a different picture than what most media portrays.
---
We've had a lot of these stories in Fallout games - things like people committing suicide rather than living in the world, people with newborns or children who have to decide whether to try to care for them or kill them to save them from that fate, people with sicknesses and disabilities struggling extra hard, the results of more disasters happening after the initial apocalyptic events (fires, floods, etc), lack of resources, etc. 
---
In studies done for post-apocalyptic films, they find that the audience reactions are really searching for that "hope despite it all" theme, and for "wow that sucked for a while but everything turned out okay!" 
---
It gets to the point where directors change the original endings they had planned for the movies, in order to better please the audience. Apparently they did that with "Bird Box", and the book is much darker, for example.
---
I worry that if they really leaned into the reality and sadness of this game, what with there being no human NPCs - it would be much more depressing than any previous Fallout game. 
---
Think about what motivates players to keep going. 
---
Maybe in previous Fallout games, you were partially driven by wanting to help out the human NPCs and make their lives better. That's pretty much gone in 76. One could argue that you're trying to make life better for your fellow vault dwellers, but since nothing we do as players has a permanent effect on the environment for each other (like you might see completing a quest in a previous game), this isn't enough motivation by itself. Our perceived benefit of helping others is just in our temporary interactions when playing together. 
---
Okay, maybe you were driven by starting with very little and eventually accumulating enough stuff to feel like you were "making it". I think that's still present in 76. One thing about post-apocalyptic worlds is that often there is an overabundance of resources like scrap because...well...a lot of people died and left their stuff. If this feeling ever goes away and you feel too powerful, I recommend a "naked run" - leave ALL your gear in your stash and go somewhere and only pick up and use what you find in that run. Very humbling, very quickly.
---
Maybe you were motivated by getting a cool collection of stuff. That's less present in 76 than it was in past Fallouts, because we can't keep as much stuff. So this opportunity for motivating players is lost. I mean, even in 3 I would keep all the unique weapons and other stuff and carefully click and drag them around my Megaton house to display them for myself. Picnic table with ALL the hats!
---
So what's left to motivate players to keep playing and building up their characters? Well, maybe making it fun? And injecting silly things into a hopeless world certainly does make it more fun. I think more of us tend to show each other things like the silly costumes vs. "hey I found a really sad bit of lore where everyone decided to kill themselves do you want to go look at it?" 
---
I think the hopeless narrative works VERY well for single player games where you can take your time with your feelings and explore at your own pace and try to immerse yourself in the messages as if it were reality. But, we have to admit that a lot of gamers like to rush things, and some of these things are serious topics we deal with in our pre-apocalypse world. It would be in really poor taste, for example, for you to come across a really depressing scene with a lot of corpses and be feeling the genuine emotions (e.g. relating the scene to something that really happened in real life), only for someone in a goofy outfit to run up and start teabagging the bodies and laughing. 
---
So that was a lot of writing, but I'll sum up by saying I think I get why they did it this way. And while I agree with you, I am enjoying the silliness and being able to have fun with the game with my friends. 
---
I am eagerly anticipating a more depressing single player Fallout in the future.
---
I think hes wrong. I havnt tested in terms of damage but in terms of armor, it does indeed reduce their armor by 50% ( verified by the perception perk ). Something with 50 physical defense reduces down to 25, something with 100 drops to 50, etc
---
Ok so with starched genes it doesn’t matter what I take or do I’ll keep the mutations? 
---
Clawlinary and Biting 111
---
But... they did. They did that. 
---
If you enjoy Xbox PvP I could send you a gammer tag of someone who whacks people on workbenches.  Maybe you could show them some "love".
---
I had hoped to uncover the ever elusive deathclaw breeding grounds
---
I have to agree it's the bad pvp.  
---
But sometimes we get into our small groups, and all find it hard to break out of that.   Plus add to that we can only do four [unless that changed] and it's easier to keep team chat.   In the end alot of bad design makes it... hard.  
---
 But if certain events wouldn't start until you had say 10/12 people before it begain....  I would be happy to join those type things.  Somethings are fun.  But I had so much fun with a group of stranger who agreed the pvp should be a server based thing not forced on us all.
---
Played 120 hours, never saw him. So yes.
---
I hate her soooo much. She's so fucking annoying. I wish i could kill her. Twice. 
---
I met a guy in nuked Whitesprings that was insta gibbing all the glowing enemies. I asked him if he was a duper and he said no dude, I bought this gun for $5 on Ebay.
---
A really friendly player I met on Christmas evening gave me a 3 star legendary exploding stalkers gatling gun with added defence when reloading. It's an absolute beast. I haven't put it down since. 
---
Near the chemistry bench uphill from Wallace in Harper's Ferry
---
Heavys like the .50 are very perk heavy. Must haves are all 3 gunner perks maxed out, stabilized for armor penetration and adrenaline. 
---
I was very lucky and got a explosive .50 very early, i think when i was around lvl 50 to 60. with all 3 gunner perks maxed, Demolition expert rank 5 and lvl 3 bloody mess, this thing does 222 dmg per bullet. Couple that with adrenaline stacking, maybe a bobblehead and overdrive, this thing gets pretty op.
---
 Before that, i used a two shot gatling gun, which is very ammo efficent. It two shots most trashmobs, with adrenaline kicking in oneshots them even. Btw: 5mm ammo with rank 2 bandolier has no weight, i run around with 10k 5mm rounds.
---
What isn´t really needed is that heavy gun perk in luck (forgot the name, that one that staggers and has a small chance to cripple) you will kill fast enough so you don´t need/notice the stagger. Maybe useful on the queen, but i never tried it. In my queen fights where always some shotguns with enforcer around.
---
About ammo: one run of lucky hole mine with a exc power armor nets you enough lead for atleast a week. easiest way for steel is picking up every enemy gun you see and scrap it with scrapper perk. Acid can be farmed by farming snallygasters in toxic valley or in whitesprings by collecting abraxo cleaner.
---
Had this bug do me out of credit for launching a nuke.  
---
I and two other friends were doing the silo. Zone in, and I can't see one of them. I'm kind of the "healer" of the group - high charisma, running both Team Medic and Rad Sponge (shared Rad Sponge because I've got Healing Factor, so my teammates don't really need to heal me back) so I needed to be able to see them to stay close to them for healing. I load out, then back in. Unbeknownst to me, one of my party members can't see me, nor do I even appear to be IN THE PARTY to him. He's the one we let launch the nuke. Other party member finished his questline, I didn't. Boo, hiss. I appeared to get credit for the nuke launch, but I still have the quest in my journal. The two guys I ran it with no longer have the quest in their logs.
---
That’s right. I think you have to remove the card to get the mutation and then put the card back on. But then as long as it’s on, you keep it. 
---
Make sure to let the others that know this in on equipping it. ;)
---
Just hit whatever this bug is myself! Trying everything to "unstick" myself. Nothing has worked yet... 
---
Just Carnivore &amp; Herbivore were bugged but it's fixed. You can't have both at the same time but before the fix they excluded all mutations once you acquired one of the 'vores.
---
Odd, when it kept me from getting credit for a nuke launch, I'd exited the building and came back and my teammate still couldn't see me. I didn't even appear in his TEAM, but my Rad Sponge was still ticking off for him just fine.
---
I think a couple might be (like they don’t do what they are supposed to do). But I haven’t noticed issues with the ones I’m using (marsupial, electrically charged, scaly skin, twisted muscles and grounded). 
---
is it only bulking? sometimes i get worried when i'm cooking up all the stuff in my cook cook queue. because im pressing the button so so fast fast, i hear the noise, i count the clicks, matching it up with the number i will run out of first, and they don't all register
---
I don't think any pistol perks have an effect.
---
It definitely does count for the pistol challenge, though.
---
To much fake news as is. Show proof.
---
I scrapped a normal piece of heavy combat armor. I then got a promt that the BoS mod was unlocked. 
---
Alright thanks
---
Does carnivore work with the cannibal perk i mean it is human "meat"
---
1 if you tell me that your circa-250 DPH weapon (whose tooltip for the two side by side billets it shoots reads their combined damage OHK’s everything, I call bullshit. 
---
In flatwoods. Maybe. 
---
2. You don’t seem to get it. Damage per anything
---
Isn’t calculated of what you fire. It gets calculated off what you **hit** and unless you use your two-shot like a bolt-action sniper rifle (with a fancy pyrotechnic that fires ammo into the clouds in full auto from the second/third round onwards), it just doesn’t hit much of what it shoots. 
---
Yes, you can manage it. But the result is a sub-par mediocre weapon. I’d rather a recoil controlled piece that can combine the entire contents of a mag into one punch or many rapid punches, from up close or from a distance. 
---
A two-shot won’t even hit a burst in VATS when VATS reads 95%.
---
Yeah ppl just nuke those two spots. I havent seen any other places being nuked.
---
If I ever launch a nuke again, ill hit the Mire.
---
You can do the quests in any order. 
---
You don’t have to
---
Since you're also using a knife make sure you keep Martial Artist equipped.
---
It increases the firing rate of Gatling and Laser Gatling for some bizarre reason.
---
Personally I just run the wires on the outside of my house and the roof. The power connectors that attach to the wall and you wire up work for radial power so they just need to be within 1-2 foundation pieces of any lights/radial power things.
---
If you need to connect a wire to a terminal or something, I like to just put the terminal in front of the window and wire it through the window to the connector on the outside of the wall. Not all windows work for this, but pro tip: The brick wall windows have no glass and you can wire right through them.
---
Makes for much cleaner interiors with no wires about.
---
Always remember NOT to give Sulik a burst weapon if you want your party to live :)
---
Is it hard getting used to the jumping height with the marsupial mutation.
---
What are the advantages of jumping higher?
---
YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO
---
YOU AREN'T MY REAL SCORCH-DAD &gt;:(
---
Yup, I have it on 100% of the time - essential for melee.
---
Right, as long as you have this max card activated you can not lose mutations. Doesn't matter if you use radaway or decon arc :) 
---
Nah that’s my favorite. You get increased carrying weight and jump high. Love it. 
---
I want a talking Deathclaw that travels and sells us stuff.  Like the Traveling Salesman, minus the hostility.
---
Or "Spends caps to join event, arrive there and its 2 minutes away from ending"
---
I have a level 17 that I just bought a second set of "Handmade Gun" plans on. Make sure you're looking for "Handmade Gun", not Handmade Rifle. I server hopped a couple of times to find it at Watoga.
---
Maybe not his house?
---
So this one YouTuber is a reminder that all other Youtubers are shit people?
---
I really hope that you don't use this logic too often......
---
Sounds similar to Skyrim's bow mechanics messing with the vertical sensitivity. Definitively an issue with the game itself.
---
Ok great. Thanks mate 👍🏼
---
Sounds cool 
---
I will either buy marsupial or electrically charged tomorrow. Thanks for the advice
---
My pleasure! Thank you for a very friendly conversation, it really brightened up my evening :]
---
Then you either are still low level or you run around in low level areas only. When you are high level, the game spawns more enemies using assault rifles or combat rifles, which drop 45 or 5.56 ammo instead of .308 ammo. The higher in levels you get, the less .308 ammo drops. Simple as that.
---
You also dont need critical savyyl and four leaf clover. I always get crits after 1 shot after my first crit. Better get bloody mess imo. 
---
Also white knight is not needed for a stealth build, because you probaly wont get hit anyway.
---
i played fallout 3 for one hour and stopped.
---
i have played fallout 76 for 200 hours.
---
i played fallout 1 and 2 for a number of hours i cannot quanitfy
---
Man, I wish we could have attended their event there. I know it was for promoters, but I hope the next one Bethesda sells a vacation package to. Would hopefully be a cheap way to make a buck off us while giving us a truly unique experience too.
---
Yeah this is a major reason this game is in  such a bad place right now, and it’s a fundamental flaw in the design. It won’t be fixed. Best option is to stop playing and monitor the sub until they do or don’t pull a no mans sky.
---
I'm still missing 95% of my shots when it says 95%, lol. 
---
uhm I deleted it already to avoid confusion :'D
---
If you want you can go all the way to the hardest part of the map and join the enclave at level 1 only restrictions are quest chains that require one main quest to initiate the next main quest in that sequence, top of the world questline is a great example. 
---
That’s Bethesda newest can of worms to open - I assume team buff was bugged 
---
There isn't any reason to craft anything in Fallout 76 _except_ to immediately scrap it in hopes of unlocking a mod to put on a legendary.
---
PA parts and the Ultracite Gatling Laser are probably very niche and notable exceptions. The hunting rifle used to be in that category, but there are now legendary versions available as drops.
---
My inner troll wants to down vote this so bad haha. Good on ya tho. Depending on the subreddit I consider some downvotes as merits to my character. 
---
I can't tell you but I would guess so. Anyway Carnivore is a pretty good mutation since you'll come across a lot of meat ;)
---
Yea, be mad at me because you suck at grammar. 
---
Probably in a friend's house 
---
In this case it must have been your raider clan!
---
Get him boys!!!
---
(Jumps into cover and hides)
---
hey, this is the build I've been working on!
---
I am mostly melee with a backup of Tesla Rifle for crowds and a Two Shot (non-explosive) Automatic Handmade for big baddies. I wear Power Armor all the time and don't use regular armor at all.
---
Here is what I put together, it's probably not perfect, and you can play with the perks like Tormentor, Bloody Mess, Tank Killer, Commando, etc. as your preferences dictate.
---

---
I'm not super into min-maxing, I just like to reach that happy medium where I'm doing a lot of damage (currently one-hit most things in melee) without dying all the time.
---
Yes, remember Goris, the sentient deathclaw from F02? He came from Vault 13, the deathclaws there had evolved and  rebelled against their Encalve masters. 
---
Did you guys visit any other locations? I wanted to surprise my husband with a trip out there to visit for our anniversary. It seems like a lot of fun!
---
Now that I think of it, I've never even tried to hit him to see what happens. Unlike that prize robot... Graham's just naturally welcome around me, even though he never has any caps..

.
---
Vendorbot: „ [...] and if you regret buying, no refunds“
---
Awsome ty much for info was wondering if I was going to have to remake all my armor
---
Nope. Just let it get a little damage and repair it. 
---
chainsaws do not qualify as any weapon type for perks when clearly they are a 2 handed melee weapon, and often fail to continue Sawing when you would expect it to continue because it is a mechanized machine and unless my enemy is using some kind of incredible vibrational/sonic force to disrupt the machine's rotation i do not expect it to stop unless they completely destruct it.
---
That quarry in NV scared the shit out of me! I was like...."Yay exploring....OH FUCK A DEATHCLAW!!!"
---
That was the BoS material mod for the Combat Armor Helmet. The other BoS material mods for combat armor (arms, legs, and chest) need plans to get. You can't learn those by scrapping. The Grafton railway vendor sells the BoS material mods for Combat Armor.
---
If the biggest gripe against the game is shit that doesn't exist then I guess it must be pretty great. 
---
sometimes it’s not even the right event, i fast traveled to “grafton parade” and it was the protestor one wth
---
I guess it has to be weak because it's so close to the Vault 76.  When I first started, I explored that area and saw "Deathclaw Island" and I NOPED the fuck out so fast!
---
I HATE VATS STROBE
---
I can open pip boy sometimes now to break the strobe loop
---
He means the class of weapon
---
I love how you say "all the evidence"....
---
And then provide no actual evidence....
---
Accusing BGS of lying is not evidence.
---
Data miners finding reference to lunch boxes, references that carried no context to whether these are purchased boxes, event rewards, etc is not evidence. 
---
Thinking the game would be a good model for micro transaction fueled F2P is not evidence. 
---
You are speculating. That's not the same as having evidence.
---
Being wanted sucks dick.  You would think it would make for some thrilling gameplay fighting off bounty hunters but in reality you’re just waiting to get one shot by some level 200 asshole with a TSE or something.  There’s not many interesting fights that come from being wanted since you’re always stuck letting them get the first hit so they can just one shot you without worry.  Sometimes you run into a player that doesn’t kill you immediately and you can have a fair fight but mostly you’re just biding your time until you’re one shot.  The PvP seriously needs a revamp so I’m not getting one shotted by some guy I didn’t even notice who just fast traveled to me while I’m wanted or I’m getting one shotted because I tagged someone first so they get the first hit on me and I have no hope of fighting back.  It’s stupid.
---
Oh thats nice to know. Thanks.
---
You can test that for yourself and see if the bonuses do not apply
---
Two Shot is inaccurate unless aimed. VATS uses non-aimed (hip-fire) accuracy, and the % displayed in VATS is inaccurate for Two Shot weapons. So VATS is mostly useless for them. That's the main drawback of Two Shot... Great damage (until nerf) poor accuracy in VATS and hip-fire. After nerf two shot will probably be garbage, Anti-Armor, Furious, and Bloodied will all be far superior.
---
FYI: Metal Picnic Tables can be bought from  Grahm
---
Thanks!
---
dont play online then
---
Until OP provides proof, this is as baseless as it gets. It's more likely OP was actually duping prior and was banned whilst bulking, if this is even true at all.
---
Does the suit give a bonuses against environmental dangers like a hazmat suit?
---
I'm sure you can provide the notification of your ban....
---
Also, this is the internet sooooo..... "I'm not a duper, I was banned in error" literally translates to "I'm a duper who got caught"
---
this is the best part of the game. enjoy the challenge while it lasts.
---
The piece you craft with 30 INT can't be repaired until it's below 100% condition, just like the stuff I craft with a 9 INT, so no, you can't repair it to greater than 200%.  
---
I don't think a max of 10 DR more (2 per piece for 5 pieces) is worth it to spend 15 perk points in INT and jump through the other drug/bobblehead/consumables hoops. I'll stick with 9 INT, craft my stuff (or find my legendaries), let them take a bit of damage, and repair them with Fix It Good/Weapon Artisan.
---
You should let the information reach youtube and when they realize it's a threat, they'll fix it. Otherwise you're talking to walls
---
Atomic shop sucks cuz I can't wear the Outfits when I'm forced into a Radiation Suit. ;o
---
I still want all the tribal stuff from Honest Hearts though.
---
and I wish for floor and wallpaper to be able to be slapped over existing pieces since I can't replace floors near steps and whatever other building oddities to annoy me.
---
&gt; Hope this information keeps you from missing out on those limited time atomic shop aesthetics.
---
Why would you want to spend money on a company that falsely banned you, and other people?
---
Jesus you guys spend too much time following youtu r personalities who are 95% idiots. 
---
When dealing with upper floors, you have to work backwards from the way you laid them down. Last piece first.
---
Enjoy while it lasts. Once you hit high level, any kind of challenge is just gone forever. 
---
Please stop spreading this f2p rubbish, it was already denied by Bethesda.
---
Don’t worry about getting addicted to alcohol, my drunken character just drinks through it. Also you aren’t getting hit, don’t bother with improved stims. Carry weight doesn’t matter either if you are in power armour. White night is useful for nuke zones and maybe bloody mess for more damage. Instigating lever action and you’ll one shot most things
---
Can you get banned for having a duped item you bought from another player? I'm always worried about engaging in trade with others because I don't know if they dupe or not. 
---
Yeah that's not good. There's a couple of reps that patrol the forums but you're best off logging this with Bethesda. 
---
is it the best part of the game, really? Not being able to craft new mods and weapons because all your junk goes towards repairing your camp over and over again, as packs of Lv.50 enemies raid it?  
---
I'm sorry, but there's a huge damage gap between that. You can NOT clear out a high level location on Lv.20, without using up obscene amounts of ammo.  
---
The peak of this was when Flatwoods had an event, so I joined it, and all the event related mobs were max level.
---
Love the firerate and sound of the MG42... shame its such an inefficient sack of shit.     
---
Sticking with combat rifle / handmade for now.      
---
A bit of a sad story about a moment of weakness. I was doing the mistress of mysteries questline when I had to use the blade to kill different kinds of enemies. I only needed one more enemy type and I have been running around for a while just trying to find any enemy type I have not killed. That's when I found a mister handy leading a  small pack of stray cats. It was the cutest thing I ever saw... but I needed that last kill to complete the quest.... It was a sad day in Appalachia...

Bethesda has lost a lot of fans „to“ Fallout76
---
Worse of it all, they were genuine fans of Bethesda Games 
---
IT'S GRAFTON DAYYYYY INNNN GRAFTOOOONNNNN 
---
well, that will be changing for you in the next update, as they're nerfing double shot / explosive :)
---
" Rifles are extremely op and shotguns can't even compare with them". WHAT? 
---
5mm ammo is a classic type of ammunition from the original Fallout games though, that's why it's still here despite it not existing in real life.
---
Plus, it kind of makes sense lore wise that an hand held minigun would be shooting a generally less powerful cartridge than even 5.56, since even that has a lot of recoil when you have a weapon with a really high rate of fire.
---
Level 300 guys are real businessmen
---
Btw shotguns can still hit up to 600 damage with bloodied and perks alone.
---
Isnt legendary allways heavy? i have never found any other version.
---
You don't have to use stimpacks rad-x and radaways at all.
---
Adamantium Skeleton for never be criple again.
---
Sun Kissed for removing rads
---
Healing Factor for outside battle
---
Vampire weapons for in battle
---
And you can use health regenerating armor as well
---
Never have to worry again about your gems!
---
I don't know if I'd want a town of NPC but I would love for there to be a dozen or so roaming the map wanting to do business. 
---
Nope, the item will get destroyed :(
---
I stopped playing around level 25 because every location was spawning max level enemies ... and because of the tedious nature of fo76
---
No, but I heard recently there is a bug and there is a way to do it. I couldn't test it though, because I can't find anyone with black jet paint for X-01 who would like to try it ;)
---
Oh that sux. I have a full lvl 30 t-51b PA with custom paint, if i want to give it away i should get rid of of the customisation?
---
Maybe allow vats to target team members? Could have an option to toggle between who vats targets.
---
I was also wrongfully banned. I tried bringing it up here but was down voted and accused of duping despite my innocence. I wish you the best of luck and if you managed to get unbanned please share how. I've still not received a response in 5 days. This is the last straw with Bethesda for me.
---
Let's all do something productive and STOP talking about him daily! Let him just disappear into his shitty hole and never come back.
---
Shotguns. Love blowing the legs of things and watching them crawl around pathetically while I run around in circles around them. 
---
Fair enough ! 
---
Doesn't higher int make the condition bar longer? Or does it just give extra secondary condition bar? 
---
I think that should work. Just go back to the normal paint job
---
You say you're not about griefing, but you admit to taking workshops from low leveled players just because you can and then server hopping to find low leveled players you can steal from. THAT IS GRIEFING. That is EXACTLY what you're about. You're fighting people who have no chance of fighting back, whether their stats are far, far below yours or they're in Pacifist Mode and quite literally CAN'T fight back. You are a griefer, nothing more. If you want PvP, go do the PvP events or use your radio on the Hunter/Hunted station. Or better yet, go play a different game altogether.
---
i would like to know how you dont one shot players? every PVP match i have been in, i one shotted the other guy and he would one shot me. 
---
I'm from Gallipolis too. That's the main reason I bought the game. Lol
---
For me, Lakeside Cabins is notorious for unreachable mobs. Got a feeling it happens when it filled with passive  ghouls or molerats, spawned underground, so they can't see you and get full force aggressive stance, and can't move cuz they stuck. When Cabins was filled with Super Mutants, everything was fine. Same shit could happen in Charleston Landfill.
---
Have seen the Vendorbot four times and was lucky enough to get a Hunter's Longcoat on one occasion, twice nothing to purchase other than clock plans, and the last time a player shot him just as I approached and then gave me a thumbs up. When I asked why would he/she think I'd be happy about it the reply was that the bot had nothing of value. I had to explain to this cretin that the inventory would have been different for me and something of value might have been there for me to purchase on their behalf. Some people are just shite. 
---
But congrats to all youse! 
---
Or god forbid, as a tool to have text chat in game 
---
The problem with that is that players who want to fight will go and attack players who don't, and if there's no penalty, then griefing will run rampant more than it already does.
---
Claiming workbenches "missions" - always rewards you with random plan. Problem is, it marks you PvP ready, so anyone can kill you easily.
---
 TWZ05 "Event: Swarm of Suitors" \[QUST:0025C090\]
---
Actually there is an another reason to fail the quest - the game doesn't register any player reaching the island. I did this event once and failed no less than 5 times just because of it.
---
Claim workshops and defend them. 
---
Taking workshops works for me  
---
In one way the wanted system is meant to punish you for what you did.
---
if you could freely start a defensive pvp just because you're wanted,then the whole server would become a pvp far west of 10 caps bounties,beacuse griefers would actively use it to attack,not defend.
---
As for the high level chasing a 10 cap bounty,yes i do it too. There's a challenge for collecting bounties ,so your head might be worth 20/40 atoms.....not 10 caps.
---
No matter what build, I always recommend at least 5 Intelligence for Rank 5 Gunsmith/Makeshift Warrior for whatever build you use. Maybe go to 8 Intelligence if you mainly use Power Armor to get Rank 3 Power Patcher.
---
If you don't use Power Armor, then at least 3 Agility will be necessary for Rank 3 White Knight. 
---
Then you are either still low level or playing in low level areas.
---
.308 is quite the poor ammo choice since it's both hard to find in high level areas (Most Super Mutants usually have either have 5.56, Fusion Cells or .38 while scorched usually drop .45 with the occasional Shotgun Shells)  and also very hard to craft compared to 5mm and .50 BMG (Which with the right perks you can craft 180 at once with 1/3 chance of getting 100 bullets more with Super Duper). 
---
I've enjoyed all Fallout series from the very first one and 76 is my favorite.   It looks like FO4 multiplayer DLC, but actually the gameplay feels far different.  I particularly love the real time VATS which was a bit tedious in 3, NV and 4.
---
I normally don't carry more than 30 stims with me 🤔 and i don't have bird bones atm and hmm im not sure do you really get improved sneak from that one? 
---
 white knight i not a perk that i have equipped all the time just for repairs i just swap like amorer and stuff like that 
---
That dude is cancer he’s 5 times worser then the game journalists he hates 
---
Not sure if this was listed since it's a long list, but the legendary effect on armor "Weapon weights reduced by 20%" will fail to work if you log out with the armor piece on. You need to log out with it off and put it back on when you log on. Interestingly, it still seems to work as intended when the game inevitably crashes.
---
Bethesda's official statement was if you bought a duped item but didn't know it was duped they'd IRL mail you a postcard of a slightly-disappointed-while-sighing emote face....... Seems pretty harsh.
---
I found them pretty helpful 🤔 maybe i ll try to swap them and see if it makes a difference thanks (:
---
how do you not one shot people in PVP? When i fight with someone in pvp i one shot them, melee with a fist weapon. i also get one shot with any weapon unless they are using a heavy gun like a mingun or gatling. 
---
Last days, i got an issue with mutations, i don't know if it already been 
---
1/ On PS4
---
2/ Gnakor
---
3/ I don't have screenshot now. i'm not even sure how i can send it to my PC.
---
4/ The beneficial effect of mutation disapear. it's obvious when you have marsupial. They don't show in the Status interface, only the negative effect (like "-1 STR" for Bird bones). It last until i disconnect.
---
How to reproduce :
---
- Invite someone
---
- Share Strange in number
---
- teammate leave the group.
---
I have class freak as perk but i don't know if this impact.
---
An other bug that could be related even if i don't think so. When i log in, i often have 2/3 of my mutation showing in the status screen. It's probably a synchronisation problem but it's still annoying
---
5/ Not reported yet. and not sure i can because i'm at work
---
But should you be able to create something better than a legendary?
---
I don't mind legendarys being RNG based, but it would be better if we could have some kind of input into what dropped. Maybe certain events drop certain effects or types of effects. 
---
Ps I main a .50 hunting rifle until I find a good legendary one. Does the job until I'm spotted then I pull out a two shout assault rifle. 
---
Locks are only good for water purifiers and resource extractors
---
raiders are only raiders because they raid things for profit. If there is no profit, "raiders" would never be. 
---
It isn't
---
I got this bug once or twice. But it was lock on danger and ennemies didn't spot me. it just seems a display bug for me.
---
k
---
Why
---
Yes friend, let us all waste our hard-earned money on a game just to be allowed to have an opinion on it. If you really thing Anthem is going to succeed then the triple A gaming industry has been really succesful deluding your mind. EA cancelled a singleplayer Star Wars game because it wasn't a 'billion dollar' idea, EA would'nt let any game be in development for YEARS on end it if didn't have any monetization possibilites besides selling the game.
---
wow guys, it's almost like this isn't the 60th time this exact idea has been posted
---
i was in a group of 4
---
went to my camp to bulk some stuff after a material run
---
went to the workbench to bulk as fast as i can cos we were about to lunch a nuke
---
as soon as i started suddenly in the middle of the bulking process, the server started to act up to me and even my friends 
---
so i slowed down figured it was cus i was doing it to fast, yep as soon as i stopped and slowed down everything went back to normal.
---
The improved stims are just my "i need 3 int for switching out other int perks when needed" 😅  i just need 3 int for hacking or armor / weapon building 
---
If you have a better 3 int perk i m willing to switch (:
---
Im not sure if i could skip the endurance drinker perk 🤔 im not drunk all the time to save alc 😅😅
---
I never ever use PA ^^ i hate it don't fits my sneaky sniper 😀
---
Do you think lever action rife are better than hunting rifle? I neither have a lever or hunting legy atm 😢 
---
Fallout's tone since 3 has changed very little. 
---
There's just this segment of fans who see Fallout's sillier side as "immersion breaking" because they want a more "serious" , "dark" "depressing" post apocalyptic tone. They want a hard core survival game tone and experience in Fallout. Which is not Fallout. 
---
For instance your praise of FO4 and it's opening? The whole son kidnapped thing? Boring. Cliche. Forgettable. Most of the cast are cliches. Not even interesting ones. 
---
I much prefer the start of New Vegas. Far more interesting. And even that game.... The now darling of the FO community had Old World Blues. 
---
Old World Blues. An entire DLC that start to finish is absurd. Every moment of it.
---
 *"Agility is a measure of your overall finesse and reflexes. It affects the number of Action Points in V.A.T.S. and your ability to sneak."*
---
White knight:
---
 **Your armor breaks 90% more slowly** and is cheaper to repair.  
---
But you should make your build to suit you best, not what anyone else use.
---
the first part of your sentence seems like something that could be fun,but the second half makes it look like you totally missed the point. You're wanted because you did something wrong. There's a penalty for doing wrong ,you know?
---
Think you forgot this
---
/s
---
So do they accept caps as payment?
---
I got the same problem on PS4. It happen to me when i try to open the pipboy before anything else when i log. I'm lock at looking at my pipboy without the interface. then i can go to the map and fast travel if i'm not overweighted
---
Get to work on your essay then.
---
&gt; I can’t watch his videos... the way he moves his head and can’t make eye contact with the camera just makes him come off as disingenuous and shady..

"I can't think of anything wrong to say about his content, so I'm just going to nitpick because I disagree with his opinion." You're better than this, stop getting riled up from sensationalist YouTube videos and Reddit threads like these, it's better for the mental health.

Ur point is?

I want to kill you, becouse u spreading fucking hoax. I cant also kill you, like you wont get your $15 for liying bitch. Fuck this triggers me hard.

A hatch that leads to a secret lab full of lore where they were genetically engineering the things.

That would be pretty cool.

Harass a women? He simply said, that she is cosplaying to get the money of the guys, with her sexy outfits, which is not unlikely if you follow that girl very closely. He didn't rape her or something else. He also got physically attacked, because of a statement.
---
In what world, do we live, where someone can't say what he thinks? 
---
Seems like you didnt follow the story and are just accusing him for something, just to beat on him and his reputation, because you dislike him.
---
It's like Sirius XM, an endless loop, over and over, powered by a solar panel. The bigger question is why is all the music 100-150 years old. 
---
So after a full day and so of grinding again I finally got my trophy on “Playstation 4” and earned my platinum. I believe that the monster mash was to blame the first time around. 
---
Things I done difference this time. 
---
1) Stayed clear of the monster mash event making sure I didn’t trigger it once. I didn’t even enter the area and avoided unlocking any locations close to it. 
---
2) Farmed the golf course for XP with the help of some friends. Even with the latest patch it’s still one of the best locations to farm XP.  
---
3) Reached level 99 touching 100. Then went to a low populated area where I was basically alone. Making sure the server was stable and not lagging/bugging out. For those wondering I farmed my last few 100 or so XP near vault 76. 
---
4) Deleted my original character lvl 190 and deleted any saves I had on my console starting completely from new again. 
---
5) I didn’t use any glitches/exploits. 
---
6) And I didn’t drop the end game nuke either but I did complete pretty much all of the main quest-line. 
---
My friend also unlocked the trophy doing the steps above on his second character. So it will need some more testing from other people willing to restart but I’m 100% sure it’s the monster mash event that bugs/glitches the “Fallout forever” trophy/achievement out.  From the testing I have done myself personally and “With the amount of people I have came across all saying the same thing all the evidence is pointing to that being the reason it’s not unlocking. 
---
Hopefully the developers fix this problem sooner rather than later for those people not willing to grind again but I wouldn’t hold your breathe on that being anytime soon if at all with how they have handled previous fallout bug/glitches in previous games. And for those people who are just stay clear of the “monster mash event” hopefully this help people. 
---
you complain about something you usually dont need? okay...
---
I found the novelty of the app wore off in FO4 pretty quickly and I stopped using it after a few days. Might be interesting if it worked in Fallout 76 but I can't really see me using it much.
---
I want my 69 euros back.. 😒
---
The regular disconnects put me off doing events a lot of the time. Especially if there is any kind of visible server lag.
---
See here's the thing.
---
Fallout has never been just dwrk and gritty. It's always had a balance. Fun, silly, dark, bleak, sad, absurd. It's what makes it such a great setting. 
---
Too many people don't realize that dark and gritty isn't the same thing as good. Without the balance of other elements dark and gritty is boring, predictable, one note and reeks of trying too hard.
---
Slot Machine.. Good analogy.
---
Melee have good perks with all the penetration.   Good damage on many weapons.  I would recommend keeping all the melee like it is though.
---
But yeah, its rough sometimes with competing with OP TSE.  Once the nerf comes for the TSE, it should be much better.  At least it will take two shots to kill stuff (maybe).  Looks like the TSE will still get +50% damage (vs the current +200%)
---
I'll to this that sometimes, Ennemies don't spawn but we have the quest to clear the ennemies. The quest marker is next to the workshop bench in the air.
---
Got this bug 23/01 on PS4 on Lakeside Cabins
---
It was one shitty youtuber that started the lie. In that video you could even tell it was a lie or at least knee jerk stupidity. Not going to say that further in the future the game won't go free-to-play but not for a while.
---
I know Bethesda are not exactly trustworthy at this moment, but they are the lesser of 2 evils when the other side are angry youtubers with subjective evidence, who make their livings from controversy.
---
Take everything with a grain of salt (juicehead) and just enjoy the game..... for now.
---
It just gives the secondary condition bar. 
---
yeah everytime you hit the button to craft an item your client has to send data to the server. Do this fast and you lag the server. It's natural to spam crafting as fast as possible cos it's mind numbingly boring... I hope one that they let you choose to craft a number you choose with one click. I do a lot of ammo crafting - that's mining, smelting, then ammo making. It's horrible and stupid. If I get banned for it I will certainly be writing an essay in my complaint! email
---
Only tried her once. Broke three rifles and used 2000 rounds. Used all my chems. Got two plans for my trouble. 
---
Ah yes i mix those up.
---
Don't understand why they decided to go so extreme on the turrets,  Just two heavy turrets its so extreme there is no point putting them up unless you want to live in a shack.
---
Maybe a non feral ghoul that we've met in later games? One that was pre war
---
While there is always the posibilty of this game going f2p, your logic is somewhat flawed. And there's certainly not going to be a refund for you. Still figuring out how the world works?
---
Yeah. Juicehead now entirely makes content based on speculation. 
---
It's sad. 
---
What! I was convinced it was amethyst wow
---
If your using a power armor helmet with the Targeting HUD mod, I recommend using another helmet for now. Since I've stopped using it myself, I haven't crashed for 2 days. Other people have also been experiencing this issue.
---
i hope you see the I R O N Y here 
---
Why? Really, why do you need that, other than as a novelty or to kill time when you are not at your gaming system? 
---
All it does is costing Bethesda ressources to make and maintain and update. It would have to be updated everytime the devs patch something in the main game. And it is an additional error source fiddling with the live game inventory and stash system.
---
My guess is, in a year, it'll be a decent game. Hopefully more content and bugs removed. 
---
What platform are you on? I spend most of yesterday sharing perks like weapons artisan and hard bargain for lower level players 
---
Yes. No content in the first 2 months....
---
And none in sight... Except the upcoming content they keep mentioning...
---
still waitign to see him after 200 hours
---
I dont use power armor almost ever. That said, i do have it as my installed helmet mod. Ill dump it for now.
---
Hang around low levels, or go to a Scorch Queen fight. Somebody will probably need revived.
---
&gt; now 
---
What? He never had any content, just reading some "drama" he found on reddit. Idk why the fuck he is always in my recommended.
---
Exactly
---
Going against many players and being at risk of attack at any time and No map awareness is already a huge disadvantage, plus the bounty Hunter can always see where he is, if he get spotted then fair game.
---
This will actually put a risk in being a bounty hunter if you don't want to risk yourself then just don't accept the bounty.
---
I still don't get the concept of I am here to kill you because you did a bad thing and you can't do anything about it so stand still so I can hit you.
---
I see.  I thought it was already here.  Thank you.  
---
It will be a definite improvement as I might be able to actually shoot 1 or 2 ghouls in whitesprings after that patch before they get obliterated by TSE.
---
Where were you yesterday? I died 6 times!
---
They are developping a new feature to do so. Just be patient.

Vault Tech Bed unlocks the metal framed bed with the cleaner mattress (no covers). Vault Tech Bed 2 is the metal frame bed with sheets and a green blanket. Simple Modern Bed is the bed with the wood head/footboard, sheets, pillow, and VT blankets. It seems to be the only really clean bed in the game. 
---
Chances are that TV3 map wont work anywhere, because in code each location can have only 1 map value and two locations, SD4 and TV3, have been set same map (SD4) value.

Everyone likes him because of the stuff he sells.  Hardly anyone would seek him out for his personality.

If he did not sell anything, doubt people would look for him.

Or "Bethesda Tries to Deny Rumors About 76 Going F2P" ;)
---
Well atleast I noticed there was no real difference with four clover so I prefered the 15% damage 
---
I'm not sure how many gameplay hours I have but I probably had to server hop 600 times or more for the four encounters. I've only seen Grahm about four times as well. Sadly, he only had some goodies on my first encounter and I was broke as a joke. 
---
When I saw how much it cost to make the ammo I didnt even bother with the prime receivers.
---
I dunno man. Shotguns have some wicked close quarters damage. And I don’t know what you mean by there being no shotgun perks. You can up the damage, lower weight and reload time, increase cripple chance, increase stagger chance, increase accuracy and spread, ect. Ammo is on the cheap side to craft too. I really don’t understand where you are getting your shotguns from. 
---
A real journalist would realise that the dude clearly states the rumor was denied by Bethesda and the dude is merely expanding on the discussion. 
---
Ah okay so the +4 agi are the more sneaky 😅  yes okay i see that now 
---
But what would you swap to get those 3 free points for white knight? 
---
Im used to repair my armor just swap peaks for less cost 🤔
---
Only if you need it real bad.
---
I've tried that but my connection isn't that great so I never really join any servers with anyone on them. It's mostly just me for some reason. That's why I'm trying to get help :)
---
And i want the time back i have wasted writing this reply and watching all the other click baity fuckwits, like you, have made me waste on this nonsense 
---
One thing I've seen is and this is with 20 sbq runs. NEVER PUT YOUR BASE NEAR THAT EVENT. The turrets create lag issues with some people.
---
Haha I'm sorry! I'm more than willing to help now though :)
---
Well one of the reasons why the game isnt stable is the dupers but I'm sure once they reel that in they will figure out the rest of the bugs that are causing it.
---
I was actually quoting him "take with a grain of salt", and in his defence, most times when there is opportunity to profit over a possible misfortune, he doesn't. The last 2 videos about going free to play he actually presented both allegate evidence for and against, generally tells people not to give into the hype and has been opposed to the rumours despite the fact if he just easily jumped on hate wagon he'd be hitting much higher views like other youtubers.
---
Oh by the way, I'm juicehead's mother.
---
Boo
---
That place is expensive no matter where you travel from.
---
I stayed there for work, and dropped serious coin; it’s a resort for the wealthy.
---
That said Bethesda nailed it, especially with the carpeting, walls, etc.  It’s just as I remember it in real life.
---
Lol ign is my username, add me. I’ll be online in a few hours, if you’re still awake (?)
---
So Fallout (all of them, pretty much) is built in such a way that you're kinda supposed to get distracted with other things, not just do the main quest as quickly as possible. If you run through the main quest, you will likely have trouble because you won't build up enough XP and find enough weapons to do well by just doing the main quest. That doesn't mean it's impossible, it's just not really how the game is probably designed.
---
To fix this, try exploring the lower level areas and really cleaning them out to level up. 
---
I started in the Forest and made sure I had all the map markers and had at least looked through all the buildings I could find, then moved on to the Toxic Valley (which you could totally miss just following the main quests), then the Ash Heap (which I really just skimmed through discovering locations). Then I was ready for the Savage Divide.  
---
No, not hard. It's harder to adjust playing without it though! 
---
This mutation can be a lifesaver. Since you can jump higher you can easily hop onto places to give you a height advantage over enemies, or simply get away from them. 
---
I dont think it's true. But Bethesda lied to us before, so...
---
You can use any thumbdrive to save stuff.  I just put all my playstation stuff on a 16g thumbdrive if needed, and if I need a bigger one well I will use a bigger one.
---
It's 9:30pm for me so probably not. I'll add you just in case haha
---
YongYea doesn’t skew any of the facts though and admits to when he gets things wrong, if anything he’s the only YouTube journalists I keep updated with.
---
I’m 117 and still haven’t gotten one. 
---
Its about playing the game your way if its min and maxing well have fun if its not and its a different way do that too.  I just play pve and have fun.
---
&gt; Explosive and Two Shot are good and all, arguably better in most cases
---
Factually better in all cases so long as you're only considering DPS output. TS (until the nerf) is a 100% damage increase and the same for explosive. Except explosive benefits from the demolitions perk making it a 200% damage increase. When you put TS and explosive together you get a 500% damage increase unless the explosive damage calculates from the TS damage in which case it's more. That vs Furious caps at 30% increased damage and takes time to build there... no contest. I see placebo effects from furious all over this sub and it's pretty easy to test yourself to see the damage increase.
---
I Really like your ideas. They could also be the highly asked for (faction based) player hubs we desperatly need, to trade or Team up with others.
---
But I also agree with you. Most of his videos is speculative nowadays. It's always "uhhhh this is what people are saying. I'm not sure. I got a cool voice. This is some evidence, but it might not be real. Just wait for answers. Psychology."
---
There is only the chest piece thats dense and you cant by it but find it in the game via a special quest.
---
Jesus
---
There is a form of extortion. When you take your victim's loot and they see that can not get it back. You could extort them with suggesting to return their junk if they meet your conditions.
---
I sometimes recruit players as bait this way lol.
---
In regards to traps. it's really hard to execute, cuz of fast travel and server hopping.
---
When I first came here, this was all swamp. Everyone said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built in all the same, just to show them. It sank into the swamp. So I built a second one. And that one sank into the swamp. So I built a third. That burned down, fell over, and then sank into the swamp. But the fourth one stayed up. And that’s what you’re going to get, Son, the strongest castle in all of England.
---
Look on the bright side if they go through with the patch at the end of the month we all will quit using and quit talking about two-hot weapons.
---
&gt; isn't affected by bear arms for some reason.
---
So it used to be, but it was also effected by all the heavy weapons perks even though the perks specify non-explosive weapons. I assume to "fix" this issue there is a field that identifies a weapon as a certain type so that the game knows what perks apply to it. They don't know how to apply just some heavy weapons perks, it's all or none of them.
---
I did notice this, then my poor level 16 self got murdered for it yesterday lol. I had a lot of stuff on me, and was badly overencumbered with junk. Saw a large base on the horizon, so i (very slowly) battled my way up to it, to find it locked. I eventually skirted around the edge until i found a weapon workshop, that i could use through the window, not realising it would teleport me in. Unperturbed, i scrapped all my junk and the multitude of looted weapons i had, i then turned around to see a level 57 stood there. My wave emoji was met with a shot from a TSE shotgun. 
---
Basically, all the effort looting, and scrapping... and he took the lot. 
---
Middle mouse button is also assigned to the weapon wheel? Could it be because of the conflicting bindings? 
---
Think it used to be like that in beta if you had the scrapper perk.  Don't know why they changed it except maybe to be an ass to the player population in the game.
---
I am level 180, Got first Executioner (explosive) double-barrel shotgun around level 50. Then i got explosive assault rifle, dragon, 10mm smg, laser pistol, .44 revolver,....  Just play, you dont need it to level up to cap anyway.
---
Same on X1. And the challenge “collect 76 recipes” is bugged too. I’m constantly 3/76 even if I’ve learned at least 30 recipes
---
&gt; 140 
---
180 and 280 if you use super duper.
---
I have experienced this with the Vault Tec bed, too.  
---
Similar situation happens to me in Warframe lol
---
I know how you feel I got 3 different 3 star weapons that were crappy melee weapons that you wouldnt even use including a bat.  Talk about crappy loot.
---
it was never an issue before. ive had these bindings since launch day
---
I got stairs built up to one car, lined them up perfectly... after 30 minutes.
---
Then saw inside and realized, putting workstations and even a bed would be problematic.  So gave up on the idea.
---
You know who is free 2 play? Ur mom. Hehehhehuehue
---
Yep, along with bobblehead and magazines displays - I using only duplicates (triplicates to be precise, since I selling duplicates;) and I want them in my bedroom nicely displayed...
---
The game interface badly needs an LFG function.
---
I can get 3-4 loads out of mine... still trash durability though.
---
If you try and farm them in the wild you will most likely get one you dont want.  I have like 9 on my character and I got all of them through serums.
---
But the missile launcher and fat man are fine.
---
Unless you feel confident with your group's ability to clear the queen, I would advise against assuming anyone else will pop in to help. Message some people around the map to motivate/inform your intentions, It will also give them a reason to return to the server if they get disconnected.  Use vats/sneak/ armor-pen/dmg/chem perks to your advantage, avoid shooting while she's flying, and cripple her asap.  Get a hammer bro to help out, they do stupid damage when perked properly and don't run out of ammo. **Do not rely on solely tse weapons**, we saw a pair of chumps exhaust "over 2k rounds" of 5.56 with e/tse assault rifles, doing miserable damage(very little), you gotta setup your build to compliment the tools your working with.
---
If you want help and are on xbox we run the queen 3-6 times depending on schedules just send me a message.

---
Now I am looking at all my bobbleheads and magazines in my stash (only 1 of each) taking up 1 weight each as well.
---
*Sigh*
---
Wow. This looks surprisingly similar to my camp except it's a bit larger and has that thing on the top.
---
:'(    F for the bears 
---
Trying the same. Got myself a TSE Flammer. I know the TSE will get nerfed soon but with the explosiv modifier the flammer has unlimited Range.
---
So what are we going to do when we've gone past 7600 hours?
---
.50 cal is also good.
---
Ye i think. Psn mjesticbattlecat 
---
I've gotten it off a level 24-28 in Watoga. I don't think it being high level has anything to do with it. I've gotten the Mr. Handy Buzzblade off a level 8 Mr. Handy.
---
I did have to do it all in one take so that it flowed naturally, if I'd stopped and started I'd have fallen off the rhythm, but that was like my third or fourth take if I only count the ones where I went all the way through.
---
Otherwise, thank ye. I appreciate the compliment but I'm really not that good.
---
Im lvl 285 and i have one that ive kept. Ive had a few drop but this one is worth keeping. You gotta farm like a mad man/woman do uranium fever event, fight queen, farm whitespring, and kill every legendary you see
---
bobble yes (1 weight), but magazines weight 0,25-0,5 each.
---
Sending you a friend request! Lv 23 same screen name. Not playing right now.
---
You need to provide proof or you're just accused of bring a duper, regardless of your innocence. That's how it is thanks to a number of "I was wrongly banned!" posts that turned out to be dupers. 
---
Just use another power armor helmet for now. I took off one with that mod 2 days ago and I've yet to crash again. Before I took it off I just started playing and crashed 4 times in 20 minutes.
---
HOLY SHIT. 
---
This list is enormous. Ive barely played this game, and knew it was a bit buggy, but this is beyond a joke surely?!
---
Level 152 here and just found my first explosive weapon. A Suppressors explosive .44
---
Pray to RNGesus. That's all you can do.
---
Oh yeah your right, I was looking at my Nuke Cola collection.
---
......I have a collecting problem.
---
Yeah, I don't know why bethesda applied this to only the AGL, but it was in their patch notes.
---
Want paying if you can?
---
And which pieces can you mod with dense?
---
Well I wasn’t banking on the dragon calling to be nerfed but hey let’s do it !
---
#Nerfout76
---
Like when I got a bounty for accidentally shooting a player then someone 3x my level comes along and repeatedly mini nukes my base? Tell me this isn't a shit system. 
---
Don't know, it's more than 316 days, no one played that long. Probably we'll only get poky 20 atoms ;)))
---
apparently :)
---
Whenever I get wanted. I drop off my junk in a stash. Fast travel to vault 76, take off my armor and wait to die. Normally under ten minutes....
---
OH MY WORD! I mean, I know it was modeled on a real life location, but it's just so trippy seeing it!
---
YOU WERE AT THE GLOWING GOLF COURSE!!
---
Thanks muchly for the photos!
---
 Some of the more insensitive, immature or just plain ignorant players would place, profanity, pornography, swastikas, homophobic remarks and racial slurs if given the opportunity. 
---
Stockholm syndrome?
---
Seriously though if you still enjoy the game and want to spend the atoms, go for it homie. Some one has to pay for our free dlc.
---
Okay, Todd. "Just give me his name"what else would you do with it? You're awful at lying. 
---
Yep. Ive been caught in a couple and seen a handful in the distance. They look pretty badass from a distance with the green chemical glow they give off but I fast travel out of them if I get stuck in one because theyre just annoying as hell. 
---
Didn't read it 
---
I agree, it’s fun when it’s working properly.  Just for the record, I play 5 or 6 other folks and they have the same experience.   It’s rare for more than 10 minutes to go by without at least one person  saying Ahhh $$&amp;%  I just crashed.  If I were to look for a silver lining I could say at least the crashing party member respawns mobs when they come back in:)
---
Though Rad-X suppresses mutations. Use diluted Rad-X instead. 
---
Thanks I was wondering this myself.
---
Basset hound please!
---
Nose might come in handy too!
---
Oh really? So if I have the mutation and use it it’s not active for those 10 minutes? 
---
\#JustFallout76Things

Goddamn Brahmin. 
---
I got heat flashes from honey beast, still looking for whoopies
---
I literally giggled with glee when I encountered this.
---
I don’t use it.   
---
Hmm maybe its bc i have "overpowered " luck 🤔 i maxed out 15 points and get 4 more when im drunk 😅  
---
I wish i could fit bloody mess into this build i got tenderizer from charisma to compensate a bit🤔
---
Accept Rngesus as your Lord and saviour. 
---
If you ask me I think they fucked up with what perks should and shouldn't apply to it.  Bear arms should apply but I think it's a result of removing perks that shouldn't apply and removing that along with it.  It's dumb.
---
look at his previous posts, he was banned not only because he "crafts a lot" but also because he PVPs dupers and steal their (extremely loaded) inventories to drop all the stuff in a river.  
---
That's as innocent as "sorry officer, but you have to understand I only STOLE THAT STASH OF WEED TO THROW IT IN THE RIVER".
---
If you have pacifist on you do no damage at all to other players. Doesn't matter if they are wanted, if they attack you first, none of that. You deal 0 damage.
---
and the prototype is yellow anyway.
---
the dude isn't expanding on the discussion. He firstly claims things that doesn't make sense and link everything with the possibility of Fallout 76 is going free to play. He makes 10 min videos just to make money without consequences for his false statement. Since it isn't your job you shouldn't even be talking about journalism and how to talk about news and rumors
---
When everyone is special, no one is special
---
I don't have any concrete data to support my claims so take this with a grain of salt. I do however have an anti armor prime gauss rifle that I use specifically for scorched. It does about 245 energy damage without chems or other buffs, and feeling the difference with the added Prime receiver and ammo I would say it feels about 15-30% buff to damage against scorched. 
---
Also I agree that the ultracite ammo is ludicrously expensive, making any automatic use of the ammo impossible even with ammo Smith. Though due to the low fire rate of the gauss rifle combined with the obsurd weight of the 2mm tungsten ammo means about 100 rounds lasts for several game sessions. (Ultracite 2mm ammo made with ammo Smith II produces 54 at once meaning 2 pure crimson flux nets you 108 rounds)
---
It's known and fucking annoyi g.
---
For me, it goes straight in the sky. 
---
I never heard of him before the free to play rumors. As a real life Journalist, it's outraging for me see how an idiot can freely talk nonsense about rumors and affect even mainstream videogame sites, which don't even check on the news. I would encourage everyone to criticise these behaviors and eventually stop following people that spread fake news.  (i've written the same thing above but downvoted from biased fans)
---
Mhh Ive a razer mouse too... 🤔
---
I know right? Must be a mod
---
Some ghouls are feral right away. It’s entirely dependent on the individuals physiology 
---
I've unsuscribed a lot of channels because of fallout 76, I think this game opened my eyes to this kind of people.
---
Joining the enclave will guarantee the access to the bunker ?? 
---
Imagine if they either sold everything you could craft if fo4, without breaking lore of fo76.... or if they actually just let us craft all the skins and stuff for free. You know, since they should be free anyway.
---
This is their latest version of the bethesda mod store. Started with fo4 with the whole mod bs (the main reason i build a pc). Now it is this, an even more diluted mod store... but for more money?! Wtf
---
Listen whiney Wendy, this is isn't a mainline quest and done game
---
But I WANT pvp. I just want it to not be horrifically unbalanced and penalising 
---
It’s about running around in a tuxedo shooting prewar money from the junk jet 
---
Gee, that might end up being the best option. I've been server hopping for a few hours now, and none of the vendors are selling couches. Pendleton is selling "resort couches" for 1100 caps, but that's not what I'm looking for.
---
I'd hate to be a bother, though--
---
i've noticed this if you only have just enough materials
---
Wouldn’t let me repair my power armour yesterday , picked up a few more materials and tried at a friends workbench instead and then it let me 
---
Happened to me tonight and several days ago. Also got kicked from the server after 4 hours of solid gameplay on xbox just now.
---
i mean yeah, if they're irradiated then they would be...
---
I was thinking the exact same thing. The down votes just proves your right and they can't handle the  truth.
---
Unfortunately it’s a case of too realistic, Flamethrowers were shit in world war 2 and Fallout stagnated after that and focused on other things, the flamer is just a fuel tank on a gun effectively...
---
Thanks for this, I spent a few hours Tuesday night server hoping, mainly at Grafton, with no luck. Decided to try again last night and jumped on, went straight to Camden Park and found them!
---
“I didn’t know the gun was loaded!”
---
As far as I know the event in flatwoods requires you to kill some single digit level protectrons, and get to a terminal, while holding off waves of low level mr handys.  When I do this event well pass lvl 100 its still the same.
---
As far as I know most camp locations are also far away from high level spawns, unless you are in the cranberry bog or the mire, as camps can only be placed far from world locations. Which would mean that your claim of getting raided by packs of lvl 50s is very questionable. Even when my camp is near fissure site prime I only occasionaly get scorchbeasts on my lawn. 
---
If you decide you need help clearing lvl 60 mr handys from flatwoods I would be glad to help, can always use the extra exp. 
---
Yeah he might be using outrage to get views but he did in fact NOT harass sprankle, they (the MtG community) used her as an excuse to drive him away.
---
Dont worry, Bethesda already thought of a solution: nerf all other weapons to make them shit too.
---
Please stop posting about this and stop watching the drama creating youtubers. Thanks!
---
His dev room video he basically said he doesn't condone exploiting and cheating but then says it's Bethesda's fault that there is exploiting and cheating and he is still on the eassy part of the TOS when literally the day he posted the video bethesda had came out and said they weren't doing that part of the TOS.
---
I was going to write something over reactive, because I don't take well to hetero-normative bullshit - but now I just want to wish you luck battling your demons.
---
Would be nice if it were F2P, to get more fresh blood in, but oh well. Thought it was too good to be true anyway when the news websites only had one source, "TheQuartering". Also yea, shouldn't don't trust that youtube channel. Tends to stir the pot when it comes controversies. Would rather have Oxhorn than TheQuartering for the community.
---
Yes. I have exactly the right amount of mats and it wont let me repair
---
I find the flamer very effective against SBQ, does anyone else find this?
---
Hope they fix it soon
---
I did one shot someone at a workshop with a fatman the other day, 4/5 demolition expert, im level 29 at the time. he is a high level playing not outright hostile but unfriendly . this kill did not disappoint. 
---
Well it's not my birthday, so maybe just a happy coincidence? 🤣
---
Sorry for late reply but dm me
---
I can try fix it for you if your on Xbox? 
---
That doesn't change the fact that I am not guilty of what I'm being accused and no proof of my guilt has been provided by anyone including Bethesda. What I did with what I stole is inconsequential  because I am being accused of doing something specific that I clearly did not. I have never and would never participate in the act of duplication, unfortunately their broad algorithm has pulled myself and other innocent people out of the game. What's even more unfortunate is that this seem to follow the trend of half baked and incompetent ideas implemented since the launch of he game. I have no faith in Bethesda to correct this mistake but rest assured, if they do I'll be sure to share it. 
---
It's been stable for me for about 100 hours but then last night was awful lol. I'm going to log back in just now and see what's up. At least I got to do all the missions 
---
Bruh got the exact same weapon. How good is it sniping enemies with a shotgun, feel like a baws.
---
Oh no! RIP pie
---
Not tried minigun with tri-barrel yet, may be a large improvement. Not sure yet
---
Did you mean Virgo LXXVI?
---
Grahm cages incoming on camps
---
Idk why this made me laugh so hard 😂
---
I hope this helps me.
---
I'm playing on an rx 590 and get microstutters even in lowest settings. It drives me nuts. 
---
It's the first time I actually got one! I was so excited! My luck is only at a 6, too lol
---
That's not what you're after D:
---
Sorry mate! Gave you a bad steer
---
Yeah freedom of expression is sooooooo gross...
---
I have an issue when I cant change from third to first person while I reload. And sometimes it just dont work when I push it, tho my mouse wheel is in a perfect condition. Seems like this button have some weird code attached to it
---
Charging mod is fine and the same shooting frequency as gauss rifle.
---
My favorite is the Shotgun mod, can also be charged but it has a really good crowd control effect and if you tesla is a Two Shot.... Oh yeah... Pretty big radius of  lightnings :) 
---
Welp. I quit. 
---
I got nostalgia in advance for how different things weren't usable but we struggled to try them out and maximize them anyway and enjoy it before it all got fixed. 
---
Done the same myself.  Even though Skillup ravaged the game I'm still subscribed because he does provide insightful reviews. 
---
And his brother's channel I subscribe to even though it is clickbaity as fuck they're upfront about it and is  actually funny to me.
---
Yongyea is shitsack
---
Sunshine meadows has a concrete extractor. I built one there for a few hours, back in the day, and I haven't needed concrete since. 
---
There is almost no female hat options on the standard game, I guess that is why they add that hat.
---
Yep...totally agree. Tons of enemies surrounding me and I VAT, next thing I know I'm targeting another player behind me or beside me and I'm disoriented!
---
Im on PC.
---
It's an owl. 
---
This wasn’t very specific.
---
Workshops and treasure maps are pretty underrated but reliable ways of getting plans.
---
I have my camp next to Top of the World, on a junk location. Just got a pack of 4 lvl50 glowing wolves attack it, with another camp that clearly belonged to a high level player.
---
If there is a high level player around my camp, the mobs that respawn there are max levels.
---
As for the flatwoods event, it requires you to kill 3 spawned protectrons first. Those were max level the first time I went to Flatwwods with the new character.
---
And don't get me started on Whitesprings. That area is a no-go zone xD
---
“Downvotes prove” gtfo, child
---
And that requires you to invest into shotguns.
---
I'm sure they know the system doesn't make sense, that's why they are making the pvp servers
---
Why you gotta be so negative all the time....
---
I'm fairly certain that enemies in the Forest, Ash Heap and Toxic Valley are level locked to a max of 30-ish. Ive been in all those places as a level 100 and they've not scaled with me. Outside of those areas, its anyone's game. 
---
Until \*wild scorchbeast appears\*. Those are immortal.
---
Ah! That's okay, I shoulda been more clear as to what kind of couches I was after, not your fault there
---
My gt is Royal Octo
---
Sure its *possible* to have a TSE drop off an enemy for you.  The rarity of the item, its prevalence among the playerbase, and the known duplication exploit suggest the vast majority of TSE weapons aren't legit.  Using a duplicated weapon is cheating, yes even if you play the "I just bought it off some guy, he offered it to me, idk how he could have gotten it" card.
---
This past weekend alone I got 4 PMs through xbox offering various TSE weapons for 500-1500 caps apiece.  At one point I saw a lvl 2 standing at the overseers CAMP so decided to fast travel over(from gorge junkyard) and give them a little care package.  As soon as I show up a lvl 84 and 141 fast travel in and offer trades.  One of them had 15 identical TSE .50 Cal machine guns, the other had 27 identical .50 Cal Machine guns and 8 identical TSE shotguns.  Sure its *possible* those are legit but it's much more likely not the case.
---
I just watched that the other day. Great movie!
---
Mentioned this yesterday on a post. Found that there are actually people out there who are wanted on purpose, to initiate pvp. They lose their 10 caps if they die, or gain whatever cap value your level is. I found this out the hard way.
---
They need to change that. The wanted guy gets rewarded highly for surviving. Sentinel assassin armour is no joke. Makes me want a set.
---
Dude yeah wtf. It either regens or does no damage 
---
Just want to remind also that mods are also lacking.  My 50 cal has a whopping ONE mod for a heavy barrel.
---
Almost as bad as me starting up game, dying in game, then getting dc'd at the moment of trying to respawn. Bye bye bulk junk.
---
I've never gotten a single char "high level" with my most advanced being in the mid-40s.  I'm currently on my 6th or 7th.  I've never had anything like you describe happen, so i suggest you contact bethesda directly &amp; report it as a bug for you.  Since this is happening for you all the time, there should be no issues with you providing them screencaps as proof of max level in low level areas.
---
Also i've learned in my PT that while i tend to usually play solo, to not treat this as simply a single-player experience.  I regularly check the map &amp; see what level folk are around me &amp; what level folk are around an area i'm about to fast travel to.  Having a little "situational awareness" goes a long way to reducing problems.
---
I’ll buy the instigating combat knife with swing speed, psn YOCupcakeKilla 
---
I'm gonna say it... the grafton mayor shouting about the parade is more annoying than preston garvey.
---
No wood armor? phew, that sux.
---
Well maybe move your camp? I really think you are playing the game a little to fast... never had the problems you are saying here, white springs and scorch beasts used to be tedious until I got my build right.
---
I can one shot lower level players with the missile launcher if not then two shot.  Higher level players might take 3 rarely 4.
---
Same here, my middle mouse button is for bashing and grenade but they seemed to have worked in some kind of delay as of last patch 
---
Wow such but hurt 
---
How dare YouTube channels talk about the stupidity of Bethesda. If only we had channels who were shills to the corporate way of life. How about we criticize him for bringing up a rumor that he said he was wrong on in another video. That will show him!
---
You guys need to stop being shills for Bethesda. Many people who watch the guy know that he isn't the most open, but he is much more open about discussing topics then Bethesda ever has been with the release of this game.
---
People here remind me of the Blizzard shills sometimes. 
---
I mean... wouldnt that be what a duper would say?
---
"Hey guys, get rid of all your dupes so mine have more value!"
---
I appreciate what he is trying to push and i dream for a dupe free fallout but i feel some of those dupes will be in the game for months to come, unless they reroll the crafting schedule significantly.
---
YES! GIVE US DOGS ..... or one of those 3 headed opossums 
---
They just butt hurt dude. 
---
Even if he were to be more specific, there is little we can do with the „no naming and shaming“ Reddit rule 
---
I just want a protest sign to swing around that says "I am taking your job"
---
.....welcome.....to fallout 76 *cue shitty, harmonica Jurassic park theme*
---
And the problem is? 
---
If you put the feeder down, do brahmin just spawn on it?
---
\*100 dog shits appear in your yard\*
---
DUUUPEEEERRRRSSSS!!!!
---
This is so annoying.  Teammates will be invisible with the exception of the floating gamertag. Sometimes if they are in power armor all that shows is an arm a leg. I think this is a new bug since the last patch.
---
I can fight a few boss/Scorchbeasts with the Galting Plasma before it breaks but i play with Gunsmith 5 equipped. Yeah, it costs a lot but changed my heavy guns experience. The only thing to consider is ammo but Galting Plasma ammunition's materials are not hard to find (vs absurd fusion core materials required for Gatling Laser...)
---
Ok I’ll hold it for you👍
---
I love my TS +50 limb damage Gatling. I shoot SB out of the sky with it. 
---
I'm dreading the TS nerf as it's the only great ballistic weapon that's dropped for me. Miniguns have always sucked (unless they're explosive) in FO games IMO. 
---
Or like when I got a bounty for doing a quest and some asshat came along and outright destroyed three hours of searching for materials so I could repair one weapon even though I was on Pacifist Mode?
---
Yeah, it's not a perfect system. I never said it was. But if you think it's bad WITH a system at all, imagine what it would be like WITHOUT one. 
---
You are mad that people are being critical of a game that should not have been released? You and I both know that the game needed another year or two of work.
---
You want to do crazy damage without putting a point into perks?
---
Thanks appreciate it.
---
There is none...
---
Handmade, the gunshot sounds aren’t too bad, it feels good and looks good.
---
I used to have a gatling and .50 explosive effect guns as my mains. I liked the sound effect when you stop firing the Gatling, it sounds like thunder.
---
It only takes 3 luck, for class freak rank 3. You only need starched genes on when you use a radaway or decontamination shower. Swap it in/out as needed.
---
I found 10+ bags at the top of the monorail elevator on a broken train. West of Watoga.
---
No, I'm stating for you to perform that amount of damage you have to invest into it you can't just have the shotgun. You were basically talking about shotguns as if they were OP lol
---
Only torso can be densed
---
The Napalmer in FO3 was OP and adding the perk made it a blast to burn and churn.
---
You remember what you did differently since yesterday?
---
Let’s start with „what did you have for breakfast!“ ;)
---
I cannot remember the name of the farm, but there be mutant frogs there. West of the BBQ place in the savage divide. Just outside the shed in the wheel borrow. 
---
I've got ammosmith rank II but at level 79 I've never had super duper drop for me. When does that card become available? Every time I level to a new card pack I hope it shows up, but no dice so far. It seems like I get the same junk card every time.
---
You can't get up there currently though 
---
I heard about that one. Tried going there last night and everytime i used the elevator it just loaded me back at the bottom outside.. not sure if it was a buggy server or what. Ill try again tonight thanks!
---
To be fair, having artillery in his yard isn't helping.
---
PS4
---
MARBELIZER 
---
NA
---
It could be listed here somewhere but the weapons Grognax Axe is still not benefiting from the weapon artisan perk card. Everything else can be repaired to 200% except this weapon.
---
Guessing by the downvotes I assume OP already knows about the workshops 
---
Like 10/15 bags behind the r&amp;g processing plant (site charlie)
---
Because a lot of people actually enjoy trying to figure them out.
---
I dont watch much E3 coverage or game hype in general but wanted to see what 76 was all about.  The whole "reduced damage until both people participate" thing was promenantly shown in the gameplay clip that was part of that initial reveal with Todd. 
---
Awesome thanks!
---
No I did not. What I said was " Btw shotguns can still hit up to 600 damage with **BLOODIED** and **PERKS**"
---
Ill have a look see later, thanks!
---
I don’t have a prime weapon at the moment but only because I haven’t bothered and I have 16k or something regular 5.56. If I did decide to switch right now though, it wouldn’t be that hard to build up a large stock of ultracite ammo. A bit of a grind to get the flux but it’s not as expensive as people say.
---
Anyway the main point of it is to use it against scorched, including the queen. Its damage against anything else barely increases but it goes up a lot against scorched. I expect the main point of it is to use against schorched beasts and the queen, since their the big bads of 76 right now and nukes revolve around the queen.
---
You mean 5mm? Also if you use super duper you double your outpost sometimes.
---
Then just dont look at it lol
---
how much are you looking for? I have like 2 of each stable flux I can spare. I'll be online  from about 5:15pm est till around 7pm est tonight. What's the going rate on stable flux?
---
Yeah, I don't blame you. I would have no desire leveling multiple characters above 100. I appreciate you asking for the why behind a thumbs down. And I agree that they should at least say "we will not be pursuing any more STASH limit updates" but I see why. It's really easy to jump on the hate train right now and no need to give critics extra ammo.
---
I wonder how drastic playing would be if you maxed up to 15 in only 3 of the 7 categories, then put the remaining points in only one category?
---
Can't remember if each category started with 1 or zero...
---
Yeah the elevator is bugged at the moment. If you trust your footing you can find a plank that's fallen on the rail further west (south of the lookout tower which also has 2 bags). You can walk the rail the whole way.
---
Happened to me too during ws nuke. Teamed up in pacifist, team mate got engaged in pvp and lost me a couple hundres caps... everytime you try to fight back, no damage dealt. Luckily, he had tse weapons and wiped them out gaining me over a 1000 caps. That was fun in the end.
---
I didn´t know! Thanks for sharing, awesome!
---
Ooh didnt think of that, maybe ill give it shot. Cheers
---
No point farming ore because you need acid for it when you need acid for other important things. Ore also gives crap return and you can get what the ore turns into much easier and more efficiently in other ways. I’ve only smelted ore maybe twice in 300 hours.
---
Make sure the mats are in your inventory and not your stash.
---
Gnomes!!!
---
Right?! NOW it'd be worth it...
---
This change is long overdue. It's basicaly useles to fire weapons like gatling laser or minigun, just how damn fast they eat ammo, how damn heavy they are (hello stash limit, be cursed forever, damn blue box) and they got not that big of a damage. Totaly fucking useles. 
---
Nah making money off a bunch of nerds makes him the winner of the situation, just because it makes your game shittier doesn't mean he isn't winning lmfao
---
It’s definitely not working as intended but even when it is I would still expect two shot to really mess with accuracy.
---
Feels real like how?  I've made more friends in 2 months of this game than I have did in 6+ months of sea of thieves.  I attribute that entirely to the neutered PvP and ability to interact with others knowing they cant kill me unless I'm already almost dead or attack them first/back.
---
All I ever feel is paranoid when dealing with randoms in an "open" PvP environment...and relief once they leave.
---
I agree, I've started a melee build and I'm lvl 16 from farming the workshops. still have to got to the airport. yesterday 
---
I took over billings farmstead, cleared a group of super mutants to claim the workshop, then had some more come to retake the farm for the defend mission. I went back to Sunshine to defend it against ghouls and when I had to come back to billings to defend it again, this time the Super Mutants were lvl 68, so I turned tail and ran. 
---
It felt like the Super Mutants were wondering what happend to their brethen so sent the big boys to investigate. 
---
I also like how you have to really think about your build you can't just activate all the perks you want and have to carefully think about your choices, Do you carry loads of food that doesn't spoil or do you carry a small amount and cook more frequently. so you can concentrate on a action build. and the inventory management is also more relevant, because you can't just take everything. (I still do, but I scrap it and sell it to vendors).     
---
&gt;If you do not have starched genes, any time you reduce your rad count, you risk losing your mutations - radaway or anything.
---
This is false. Only radaway and decontamination showers cure mutations. There are more ways to remove radiation that don't cure mutations than there are ways that do cure them. The perk that removes rads in sunlight doesn't cure them. Sharing rad sponge with team mates doesn't cure them. Nuka grape doesn't cure them. Losing radiation by dying doesn't cure them. **Only** radaway (including diluted) and decontamination arches remove mutations.
---
The cost of staying there is fairly cheap actually. Getting there might cost you a small fortune lol. 
---
I thought explosive was getting nerfed and not two shot. Are they doing both?
---
Yes you can find them at the space station. However, you can really tell the difference between the regular and clean. 
---
And why does a maxed assault rifle do less damage than a hand made or combat rifle? I crafted a level 50 semi assault rifle and it did 66 damage per shot. In FO4 that same gun was over 100 per shot.
---
Awesome video! I didn’t know about most of these. Thanks for the knowledge :D
---
Maybe Bethesda could release a game that isn't easily exploitable... Nah it's the people's fault it's broken.
---
Right. 
---
It's going to happen one way or another.  I promise.
---
\&gt;Has only green grass in the wasteland
---
\&gt;dogs \*itsfreerealestate.jpg\*
---
Go to the Bethesda page and it tells you how to get them. 
---
Morgan town. It has ghouls there, as well as in one of the buildings (school I think) which are turned into glowing ones too. The times I’ve nukes it in the past, not many people came.
---
I agree with this statement.
---
She doesn't have nearly enough lines.
---
It's like three raider tips on repeat.
---
I've never even heard a song on her station, lol.
---
Or they can just add in a variant if the wooden sign weapons?
---
After a nuke zone has ended the game spawns other enemies there instead of ghouls, I think because of the bug where glowing ones would spawn long after a nuke has gone 
---
I think we misunderstood each other. I'm in no way defending TSE. The first person was talking about the experience of the game being easier while the second talked about TSE playing a factor in that and that it is being nerfed. Your reply made it seem like shotguns still deliver too much damage even without TSE.
---
I'm... wholeheartedly addicted to this game.
---
I never realized how much I took that feature for granted. 
---
No its not.
---
This was the first time we found this vendor, and all my teammate really wanted was the Hunters Longcoat! Since there was 3 of us we would alternate leaving the world and returning while one of us anchored. Each time we came back the vendor would have different items.
---
Kudos - I see a lot of work went into this one!
---
Certainly doesn't fit the theme of survival in the harsh wasteland, why not just use reddit / twitch as your hub? As such MMO's don't even need a hub anymore.
---
There also doesn't have to be a new FEV source.
---
It affects all people a little different and Graham, Fawke's, Strong, etc are proof of that.
---
Not all of them become unintelligent warlords.
---
Happened to me for the first time this morning, 24 caps down the tubes.
---
It's in the title. So you see it as you're scrolling through. 
---
If the title was Bravo Solo codes. And then the code was in the comment section, it wouldn't spoil it for those wanting to figure it out. 
---
I love it!!  Im a sucker for defensive walls.  Nothing beats that safe and secure feeling in the wasteland.  
---
Isn't that what reddit is for? Are you trying to be ironic?
---
Truth.
---
just go on the bethesda launcher and download them. 
---
And an XP bonus
---
Spoilers 
---
Lies, join the dark side and hail Lootcifer.
---
That’s like relying on an exterior universe to bestow upon you a golden duck. It should be all in game experience and you shouldn’t have to utilize a third party source for trading, teaming up or anything else. I’m in the wasteland, There should be a player hub and player vendor stands. While reddit and Reich are great they’re not in house of the game and don’t really give you the in game experience of meeting players through the game. 
---
I think the multi tracking is just too much. It burps and hitches on my regular armor at times, but with the targeting HUD, it just seems to straight up crash and blue screen. 
---
yes but in the past that silly side was measured and limited. With Fo76 it seem like its become the priority. Daily silly outfits or packages on the AtOM store, just seems to make the game feel like its meant to be more joke than anything else.  
---
&gt;What's even more unfortunate is that this seem to follow the trend of half baked and incompetent ideas implemented since the launch of he game. I have no faith in Bethesda to correct this mistake but rest assured, if they do I'll be sure to share it.
---
 Ignorantia juris non excusat, beside you knew what you were doing, online games use databases to keep track of things, so your account was flagged for something along the lines of "had more than 1000 X during the last 24h".  
---
Destroying or dropping items doesn't make it a "good thing / reasonable thing to do" or, in other words, an action that their ban algorithms can understand and avoid.  
---
There's a lot of people who got in contact with items dropped from the test room, and, afaik those who pooped their pants and got rid of everything are \_yet to be banned\_ .  
---
Did you, by any chance, decide to keep some of the loot ? A legendary TSE weap, anything ? ;)  
---
Funny thing is, if you're "truly innocent", this kind of situations happen pretty often and the support will probably assist you in getting your account banned.  
---
Yes this might take some time, just like real-life, it takes some explanations and talks to clear yourself from the accusations you face.  
---
Note for yourself: don't force yourself into stupid situations, stay away from problems, you wouldn't sit near a dead body without calling the cops, would you ? Don't chase dupers, don't take their items, at best be like those "vigilent citizens", start recording to you have something to show BGS support, maybe get dupers actually \_banned\_, like, kill them, record their inventory, clip it, send it to support ?  
---
This is the best spot, I think!
---
Hey have you noticed today that the flowers are being shown as picked aka (10/10) but it isn’t showing up in the actual (0/8) category? Or is it just mine?
---
Me too. I think a lot of people are like me, have a bunch of atoms stored because there's no skins for the weapons people use, and the PA skins are aweful.
---
man i am grinding 350 hours and dont have all, when do i have to enjoy endgame, like 1000hours after?
---
There's about 5 bags of cement of the Gorge Bridge south of Flatwoods.  
---
Stay on the top road, until you come across a fallen truck with nuclear material, it's right behind there.   
---
Enemies are low level ghouls and bugs, so easy grab ;) 
---
Not to my knowledge. But could happen.
---
Ah great thank you
---
The other game, just taking a guess. Is it GTA online? 
---
YES
---
What a fantastic economic cycle:
---
stupid consumer &gt; cash &gt; duper &gt; ban &gt; cash &gt; bethesda
---
Bethesda could break the duping rings by selling actual items in the Atom store direct to the stupid consumers. 
---
I'd prefer actual content. Most of you just want dupes and to be carried the hub would just make the universe more boring.
---
I hope you understand that it's content vs features. You can't have both.
---
Almost no one is recruiting for anything even mildly interesting so IMO reddit is more than enough.
---
Holy shit this sub is a shit show...

How about game company's stop trying to fleece their customer base and when charging for a full price game, give full price content. This game is FO4 - stripped of all NPC's and all the assets used in that game ported over to 76 and sold for cash in their store.
---
From FO4 in which you paid for nothing extra to the embarrassment of 76's "online shop" (which only an idiot would spend actual money in), we've gone from a complete game to a 3rd of a game charged at the same price.
---
Lol!  Space Engineers.
---
Awesome job!
---
Oh yeah I definetly need to get one of those. But if it‘s a shotgun mod does it still count as a non automatic rifle? 
---
This is good! 
---
Well glad to know I've enlightened someone with the existence of legendary laser rifle.  
---
I know what he said. He is talking out of his ass based upon what the dev says. In other words, he is making value judgements on something he has not seen for himself. It’s his right but it also makes him full of shit. 
---
I actually don't think this at all.
---
Yes, you're entirely right that at the start of the scrapping process, things unlock at a pretty impressive rate of knots, but it's all (in my biased opinion) a lot of useless crap. I don't want a stinging magazine, a quick magazine, a shiny magazine, a see through magazine, a glossy magazine or any of the other seemingly endless combinations of rubbish that blocks me from getting a hardened receiver, long barrel, long scope, full stock and suppressor.
---
I have to scrounge for at least half an hour to get enough screws to put one more Handmade and Lever Action together only to scrap them to get a +1 increase to ammo, +2% armour piercing bonus or something else I absolutely don't want and will never, **ever** use.
---
Sorry, that went a bit ranty towards the end. Apologies.
---
AHAHA, AHAHAHA, AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Thats illegal though. Or at least against the terms of service. 
---
Yes, i am quite sure the only possible reason they could've done that is sheer malicious intent and sadism. No way there could be any actual reasoning behind it.
---
Got it. Any opinion other than "Anthem new best game gamers rise up we live in a society!" Makes someone full of shit.
---
Basically the person that replied to my comment implied that with the upcoming nerf to TSE weapons, the game will become more harder/challenging because all the crazy one shot kill weapons will be gone right? So I reply no, there is still builds in the game that allows you to oneshot most enemies in the game (shotguns with the attributes I mentioned being one) So the game won't get harder with the nerf, people will just switch to a different builds that grant the same result as the TSE ones. 
---
They don't because mods are learned faster if a weapon has a large amount of modifications. 
---
I thought I had all hunting rifle mods learned until yesterday. Scrapped one because I was short on steel and learned a new mod. I've also scrapped a lot of weapons with low amounts of mods and I don't learn their mods as fast.
---
Wow no one stays to defend? Wtf are you afraid of losing? Hit repair all and it's done. Your stash is full of materials you're saving to never use and soon as they break something they're wanted one hit away from dying cause lvl 25s have TSEs now. Fuck.
---
Want your heart broken? Go invest some time building a base in Ark and have real Griefers pay you a visit. 
---
Pull your finger out of your ass titfucker
---
Yes, it 100% is your fault. You’re the one breaking the game and ruining it for others, not Bethesda. Now yes, Bethesda does deserve criticism for not properly setting up the game so that this doesn’t happen, but you are 100% not innocent, you’re breaking the TOS, and for what? A few shekels? To “stick it to the man”? 
---
I'm going to play the game for the first time tonight. What do you mean by opening the pip boy? Like, can I use it on the loading screen?
---
He's not wrong. People have been reporting people they trade that have absurdly large numbers of items. 
---
Even if you never trade anyone, you're running the risk of Beth learning the super *involved* detection technique of:
---
    if(count &gt;= 10,000) flag_for_review();
---
Upvote so Bethesda can fix this god awful thing
---
**BUDGET NUCPEAR PROTECTION!**
---
I didnc% even have to know the lore about them to know that these things would be absolutely useless in the event of a real nuke. It looks like a cylinder-shaped Port-a-Potty.
---
No they haven’t. As great fun as it is, Bethesda showed almost no effort or very little in fixing the problems. Server crashes as well as client crashes still happen regularly, the duping exploits were left in for weeks over christmas because Bethesda hadn’t fixed them before hand and didn’t feel like fixing their mistake before going on holiday. There’s so many other examples but I won’t list them, too many.
---
Where Power Armour then - you don't take fall damage in it.
---
You'll find him in MegaTon.
---
It spawns at that train station I've seen him twice my self there and every screen shot has him right outside that little shack. Camps don't effect it cause I have mine in that little house
---
It happen to me when i press A (X for me on PS4) multiple times when the server lag.
---
Oh damn wow, I can't believe I didn't know it was such an accurate recreation!
---
This makes it so much cooler
---
He seemed like he was being sarcastic and to be honest you can’t really talk about using the English language properly with all your spelling errors.
---
Ground control to major gutsy
---
yep both are getting nerf'd. Thing is for the most part they will still be the best just not as OP as they used to be. 
---
TS   goes from +100% to +25%
---
Exp goes from +100% to +20%
---
Yep says same for me now. 
---
&gt;the protestor one
---
Which I never managed to complete.
---
I've had that on Xbox. Moving the mats to your inventory from stash seems to work.
---
I got 1500% budget or so, it would take me hours to delete all my crops. You're saying deleting it on playstation would refresh the cache? I got my doubts.
---
Okay let me clue you guys in just a little. I used to run a Diablo 2 trading site. We had a working dupe for. 1.09 till 1.13. I made 20-30k from duping high runes and rares. Getting bmanas on ladder etc. The vast majority who buy stuff like that in game are older and don't play but a hour or two a day after work if that. $20 isn't a hour of work for a lot of people. Now if people don't have time to farm they will just buy what they want. They can work an hour and get more stuff than mindless grinding would get them in 8+. That's why people buy shit. Time is precious and as you get older money is a way to buy time.
---
Game is designed around micro transactions and is the worst selling besthedia game in years so it still remains a pretty good bet it goes free at some point. It’s alread down to 35 dollars to play
---
Increase the cap the prices will go up. :)
---
Never understood traders these days. Before dupers went nuts and i closed my shop. I had set prices of 500 caps for 1☆ ,  750 for 2☆ and 1500 caps for 3☆. 
---
Only for god tier roles  i was selling for 1850 caps.
---
Don't pay for things that high.... its just silly. 
---
Bethesda should really should change it so that we can retrieve mods from armor and weapons. At first I gave them the benefit of the doubt by assuming it was a bug that we couldn’t do this but now I’m not so sure.
---
I have to say again, I wasn't banned for the possession of items, I was banned for "exploiting a system issue that resulted in item duplication. Your Latin is pretentious and irrelevant because all of this occurred before a clear statement was made by Bethesda. There was no "juris" to be ignorant of. Anyone with common sense would know duplicating is wrong, but like I keep saying, that's not what happened. What we have here is a company without a clear vision, unable to appropriately handle their failings, and a large subsection of the community that has seemingly never been the victim of false accusations. The idea that the burden of prove should be placed upon me is ridicules and I know that you know it. It would be impossible to prove, even more so now that I cannot access my account. Here is a little experiment for you, prove to me that you have not duplicated items without getting onto your account. The fact is you couldn't prove that even if you did have access but i'd like to introduce you to my struggle. I'll wait right here while you figure that out. 
---
or it has already ended 
---
 pvp is broken because those that want to PvP can't really and those that don't want to PvP are the ones everyone targets
---
Like the others said bro you should see them on your launcher on your pc. If your console then just open the launcher on pc.
---
The vendor bot is there - if you fast travel, walk past the main entrance to the hole in the fence further down, and head on inside.  There's 2 bots you'll see there - a Mr. Handy that's inside a broken down building that's for some event I believe, and the protectron further up that's the Responder bot.  There will usually be a few Scorched around the bot so kill them before shopping.
---
In all the times I've capped workshops, the only one that someone actually pvp'ed me for was the golf course with the acid... so maybe?
---
yea just found it thx
---
I dont disagree with you, but posts like this i find funny as one of the main complaints with FO4s building system ect... Was that there wasnt any clean items and everything looked run down, now the complaints are the other way around
---
Just find a friendly person to mod if for you then you can enjoy the game😉
---
Post up those specs! This is not normal behavior for the game. This seems like it may have something to do with your computer or internet connection. 
---
As a loyal customer I can vouch for that. Jokers Bargains was the place I went when I needed new gear, or a gear repair. Prices were always fair and I always had a laugh! 
---
Actually, the it’s the food cost that kills you.  There are resort fees tagged to everything, and I remember I got a burger, fries and soda at the cafe (it’s shown in the game along the row of shops, where it is in real life), and the bill came to about $30.
---
That does sound tempting...
---
Is it dropping the armor near a PA workbench, go into modify mode, then paint the piece, then someone else claims the armor?
---
The takeaway here is to always question ALL information you're told, especially when it comes from a form of journalism, or an entity who may benefit either directly or indirectly from your attention or by influencing your opinion.
---
It's also worth considering that even if the person sharing information with you has no ill intent, they themselves may have been influenced.
---
Remember when you were always told to listen to your parents? What about 30 years later when dear old mother is telling you about how Mr Trump will save her from the muslims?
---
Yeah, but I wouldn't put it to the point that it's a concern. I'd still rather use something as versatile as an automatic rifle than a shotgun.
---
Yeah, I maxed out my INT to craft a set of max level X-01...there was no difference in the size of the bar from 13 to 15 to 20. All it does is add the extra condition bar, which can be attained by simply repairing anyways.
---
Your problem is simply that you don't post your contact info / schedule, and then you complain role players aren't magically following you around. Reddit is our hub, it takes some effort.
---
Personally i've sacrificed a noob to a mothman and organized a sunday workshop event for PVP on PS4. Participated in a few murder houses. Got a big team together for a symphony.
---
You got to appreciate that munchkin try hards bragging about their boring damage #'s make it impossibly to RP. We have to exclude them.

Hey Dylan!
---
I promise when the camp vendors return and the last of the duped exploits starts to really hit really low. I will return to sell for the clan and crush these prices right back down again.
---
Just waiting for them to get a handle of the cap gains from dupers atm.
---
Wait, do the bears not get auto scrapped when they're in a stash? That may explain why it's always full.
---
Oh cool maybe Ill check that out. I have like 2700 i  gtao lol is pretty pathetic. F76 is my new fav tho. 
---
Hmm I thought the flamer was pretty decent, I’ve only just started using it recently (level 55 here). I agree it does burn through ammo but it’s pretty good damage wise I’d say. I’ve outfitted it with a compression nozzle, larger tank and napalm mod or something. It does 60 odd dmg IIRC. I only used it cos I had like 500 fuel in my stash but I then started to warm to it
---
It's low level because it's in The Forest, the region's define the level cap (with some exceptions).
---
I have no doubt you will mate! I can't wait tbh it was always good coming to see how you were and what the new stuff was. And thanks for my free stuff too! 
---
Happens to me and my friend a lot on PC, if you can't see your friend it's on your end. Log out and back in to correct it. Just to the main menu usually fixes it. It does have it's benefits though, you can shoot through your friend. I would block a door after herding up an area of enemy's and my friend would shoot through me in realative safety since she's not in PA and at the time did not have any legendary armors.
---
It didn’t used to be this way so was it changed? That’s a bit silly.
---
It's a mode added by a developer clueless about online gaming. Given the duping and the stacking PVP is entirely unbalanced making it pointless. In over 200 hours I've seen people pvp'ing precisely never.
---
no
---
You are arguing on reddit with snowflakes brainless kiddos. If I were u i'd rather jump from a plane without a parachute. At least you won't get downvoted by moronic chimps while doing something very stupid. Call me an alt-right fascist I simply don't care about an opinion you can't make by yourself
---
High value. Sounds like Gunners, to me.
---
The ads say, plays best on Xbox One.
---
Performance is better than on a console than on your PC.
---
I was trying out a shotgun build myself and using a shotty is a ton of fun. However i stopped because i felt like i was going through shotgun ammo too quickly and crafting it requires too many materials in my opinion. You need so much plastic especially for so few bullets. It wasnt sustainable for me, so im curious how you handle your shotty build?
---
Great, he's solved it. Good job. Everyone can relax.
---
I, too, run like a scared lil bish 🤣
---
You have the right idea re: white night. If you’re a sneak sniper, you’ll only suffer armour damage if you mess up. It’s pointless having it equipped all the time. 
---
You know Dylan you should consider comming to me in game some time.
---
I have been focused on helping others and my job for the clan has been the collection and storage of plans and recipes. 
---
Come to me in game i believe i have about 150 weight worth of plans and recipes atm i could do alot to help you for free of course.
---
I think about it every time i craft ammos. I usually craft a lot of ammo at 1 time around 3-6000 5,56mm and don't think about it for a bunch of gaming session. It makes the server lag a lot during 3-5 min
---
Just walk some step before doing anything else.
---
I will message ya Davi.
---
I don’t believe it tells you when you are addicted to chems/alcohol I think it just decreases points in on of the SPECIALs not even under affects
---
that is being added soon , it was in the patchnotes.
---
But if that's the part of the game you enjoy (and ostensibly you're playing the game for enjoyment), you could just not do that. 
---
you play to much.
---
 to start the game it takes \~5 minutes
---
5x43=215 which is  \~3,6 hours.
---
Then I would say, that you havn't had a crash everytime you startet so I would say 15 minutes
---
and that is over 10,5 hours. Excuse me, but maybe the game tries to tell you something.
---
Serendipity does not work in PA
---
You do not need all 6 points invested in HWs, go with a point in each, unless you really really really want to.
---
Adrenaline is a one point wonder.
---
Not really sure of why you are using escape artist?
---
What does stash size have to do with you buying 3 copies (for yourself??) 
---
Fallout uses the same engine as previous games and it’s incapable of fast speeds for the character. For example in Skyrim, the horses speed is as fast as the player could go without causing client instability. This is directly from the devs, not random crap I’m making up. If the perks affected your sprint speed with their current benefits, you’d probably crash or lag a lot and they would only be able to fix it by nerfing the perks.
---
They’re still useful though. If you’re overencumbered but can still run, you get around places faster.
---
I really disagree as this is content that could be added to the game not a feature of the game. A town for players would be very beneficial especially for new players. They do need to add more things like raids or something to make this game much more playable so there’s a reason to play and I do think this would enact it greatly. 
---
It's possible that it's not even supposed to be in the game, or at least not yet. In the game files, plans to craft the axe are marked for DLC release and it's believed that the weapon is in the drop tables erroneously. It's also possible that it's a holdover from Fallout 4 game files that Bethesda either missed or was too lazy to take out (either of which is believable at this point). It's my suspicion that it's not properly implemented because we shouldn't have access to it.
---
You're pretty hostile about a Reddit post. That's strange.
---
also lag spike doesn't happen for me and I have a 1050ti with medium settings
---
Just wait till your camp loads in.  Then you won’t lock up.  Stopped having this problem as soon as I started waiting.
---
Enjoying a game is cool and I don't want to tell you what you should do or not do, Just spreading my opinion.
---
Pip Boy interface on PC (ultrawide if that makes a difference):
---
Using a mouse with the Pip Boy doesn't let you always click on the items that are under your mouse.
---
Up and down on the keyboard work fine, but I sometimes have to shake my mouse to get it to register that I am hovering over something. Typically, I have the most trouble when I scrap something and the selected item moves to a new item, but it doesn't move to the item my mouse is actually hovering over.
---
I've scrapped my good armor and weapons on accident a few times because my mouse was over an extra gun, but my good gun was selected instead.
---
If you want to throw one point in it it’s pretty good especially for a queen or something since it affects everyone’s damage against the target
---
You played the worst game you've ever played for 3000 hours? xD
---
What you wanna do is go to someone elses camp and have the battle there so they get a wanted level too, especially if they try to level it
---
Bunch of little babies in the sub won't defend their own stuff. Call people griefs when they get pvp'd or their base destroyed. I think I'm gonna make a Montage of destroying people's bases for this dub. 
---
That's not really typical performance. I'm on PC on a barely meets specifications build and crappy  ADSL2 connection and I only average 1 crash per 3-4 hours. 
---
You can trade in Destiny now?
---
My question is: is there a secret bunker beneath it?
---
I've been playing it alot on Xbone, and I have only crashed a couple of times out of nearly 600 hours.
---
Yeah, I just ran into this bug it's still a thing
---
Yeah to make money on a game that won't last longer than 5 more months. Some guy walks away from 76 with a fuck load of money for easy work while you walk away having wasted hours on a fucking shitty game. The duper is in a better position than you. Deal with it.
---
That's a good question. But yes I think so or maybe as Shotgun. Try it out :) 
---
imagine what playtime his favourite openworld game has...
---
Someone actually downvoted this post. Screw that guy. Have an upvote.
---
Seriously?! Y'all are pathetic. Go play fallout 4 if you don't want people thrashing your shit. Pacifist, fight your fucking battles.
---
Right now I am trying to get those stupid homemade rifle plans before I hit 45. I read they don't spawn after level 45 so I have been hitting Harpers Ferry vendor over and over. I stupidly spent caps on a radium rifle caps before reading about the handmade thing so I cant really afford to fast travel right now lol. Although selling the weapons from walking in there has helped a lot too since I am server hopping.
---
Which is sad because this how I use to fit travel for free.
---
But if you buy the hat you can make a Jinx character and make reaction videos
---
If you played 24 hours straight, that means you disconnected every 30.6 minutes on average.
---
If you played 12 hours straight, that means a disconnect ever 16.7 minutes on average. 
---
If you played 8 hours straight, that means a disconnect every 10.2 minutes. 
---
If you played 6 hours straight, then 7.6 minutes.
---
If it was 4 hours, then 5.1 minutes.
---
I doubt you played 24 hours straight, but I once played 14 hours. 
---
14 hours would mean every 17.8 minutes.
---
Honestly I believe you had a lot of disconnects. I just think you are *exaggerating* how many. It's really hard to believe that anyone would sit there for hours and hours, reconnecting to a game that keeps crashing the amount of times you say happened.
---
You've made these kinds of claims before. 8 crashes in under 20 minutes. That's a crash every 2.5 minutes. But you say every 5 minutes in that post. Not very good with math it seems. And of course that post claims you have the very best that USD can buy! Only that time, you gave up after 20 minutes. Or was it 40 minutes? Or longer?
---
Here you want us to believe either the game crashed every minute, or that you spent more than several hours trying to play a game that just keeps crashing over and over the moment you get into the world. 
---
Sorry, I know the game can crash more for some, and less for others. But exaggerating and even flat out lying doesn't help. 
---
I’ve no idea seeing as I don’t play it, i was just more pointing toward the player hub itself rather than the trade system. The fact is our society as a whole always establishes groupings and it seems to me that currently this makes no sense that we do not have a player town. Even in a post-apocalyptic world people would join together and establish this in multiple areas. It’s human nature and as such should be reflected in the game as well. 
---
Chemist doesn’t apply to gunpowder man. It’s the same whether you have the perk equipped or not, unless it was stealth changed very recently.
---
No, i won’t deal with it. Just because you’re a fucking greedy dipshit, the rest of us shouldn’t suffer. Rockstar’s right to ban dupers. You have no one to blame but yourself, should they take action against your account.
---
I know, right? Buying the game for its features it advertised is now the most controversial thing on this forum; RP, PVP, and survival.
---
It's a massive opportunity to role play but it's like everyone in this thread is saying NPCs are more interesting than actual people. Considering most of you describe things as "literally" 1000X a day that might be true.
---
IMO Fallout NPCs sucked when they became unkillable. Back in Fo1, even #3 Dogmeat was so beautifully mortal. Now even Nick Valentine feels like a cheap gimmick because he is immortal.
---
No you still have to pick the lock, even if it belongs to you.
---
Some cards can’t be obtained through card packs. Just buy it.
---
I run with it, and it is might sexy with my furious minigun.
---
You could, and could also drop a bag on top to hide it a bit. 
---
I hadn't thought of that before, but it would be a nice surprise for the griefers, or any other A$$hole that needed killing.
---
Thanks for the Idea, I will use that one.
---
I will but first I have to craft and scrap the shit out of the tesla rifle :D 
---
I pmay on xbox and the lad and disconnects are just as bad. I have a 100 meg download connection. The game us just trash. 
---
Remember that vendor inventories are shared. If someone else has already bought it on that server, it’s gone until restocking occurs.
---
That sounds fantastic Joker! I could do with the help. I'll see you in game soon, today hopefully but whenever your free :) 
---
Can you remember 8 digits at a glance??
---
Thats actually the same voice actress as Marge herself.
---
Dang, I would love to have this kind of time! Instead of writing down the lags and loses, start writing down all of the good stuff like the names of funny people you meet. For example, I met poopyhouser yesterday. This game isn’t a job. Like a best friend, it’s going to let you down a few times but there’s  a lot to be thankful for. 
---
Wasnt a point I was making it was boring 3 hours in but its fallout so I grinded through the game sucks as a fallout fan. My build best I can get and needs to be 1 or 2 shot everything besides queen. Even without your glass cannon build. 
---
There's a couple places you can farm.  Train car outside of Watoga, Harper's Ferry Display Case, For Defiance, Garrahan states .... depends on what you're looking for.
---
Killed those nonferals. But now Free States are dead too. 
---
They didn't email, like everyone was expecting, but they did announce the launch for everyone in there "inside the vault" updates.
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/3wohkyIGcEOE8gayy6yCMg/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-9-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/3wohkyIGcEOE8gayy6yCMg/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-9-2019)
---
Did we read the same comment? I got the opposite feeling from uapcent, that they didn't want to support people spreading false rumours, not that the game was released early.
---
Just because teenage girls are manipulative doesn't mean we should support or encourage that kind of behaviour.
---
Oh my god. That's the one that makes enemies highlight red, right? If so that would make a lot of sense, thankyou!
---
Here take my upvote
---
For a AAA publisher this is unacceptable. These dipshits couldn't think to get in some professionals to do the MP aspect? Let's not forget just how many millions of $$ Bethesda have and to produce a game of this poor quality is simply embarrassing. 
---
Carrying isn't beneficial you're ruining their experience.
---
Raids are coming possibly next week. There will be less raids if there is a hub; content vs features.
---
I don't think you understand what "theme" means either. Is the BoS going to vertibot us all to this hub? It's not logical or realistic within the setting.
---
Seriously, what do you want to coordinate with other players beyond extremely analogue try hard carrying? Why won't you post your contact info / schedule and make it work within this framework?
---
Answer: Automatic rifle. Which would be the "Commando" Perk card under "Perception". 
---
Wasted 3 perk points trying to figure it out. But thanks to someone else here mentioning that you can check the damage on a weapon before and after adding/removing a perk card.. i managed to find the answer. 
---
Sidenote about damage. Lvl 50 base dmg is at 38. With 1star commando card it's at 41. (Modded ofc)
---
Anyone else unable to respawn upon death too? just spins the camera around my dead body lol
---
Man, tell that to my Gauss plans! took like 20 breakdowns to get the supressor, and those fuckers ain't cheap.
---
I got every bit of the Marine Armor plans on multiple alts all from the train car just west of Watoga before you get to the NAR. You can enter from either side and there is a body, across the door to the bodies left are some crates, there are often plans clipping halfway through the far box.
---
Go to the mine that is east of white springs , just pick one up off rack.
---
Still away at work i will be on this Saturday and Sunday. If i remember i will send you a message on here the moment i log in.
---
I should be able to fill your collection out heavily. If you use mods like us i reccomend grabbing Known Plans before you come to me. I will happily complete your collection as much as possible.
---
Also if you use or have text chat mod we use it in game to seek people to help. Its such an amazing community and i honestly can't go without it anymore.
---
Anyway I'm off for the night bro i will see you this weekend bro.
---
I didn't personally dupe shit (the game is so fucking easy you could use a 10 mm pistol the whole time without thinking), I'm just not a 5 year old who doesn't understand how life works.
---
You won't get over it and I love it. You kids love to cry when someone used the game how it was released because you're too fucking dumb to do it yourself. This game has a meaningless PvP system and you're only upset if your autism is flaring like a fucking nuke. Keep crying about people doing things you don't like in a game that was released in such a broken, exploitable position.
---
I could see both of those being true but I would go with the former possibly was set to be released with 1 of the DLC’s and got thrown in the loot table by mistake but even then you think the weapon artisan per would work so possibly it is not suppose to be in game at all lol 
---
I’m only level 29 and came up against a level 59 Super Mutant tonight in Ash Heap. Might have been wrong place, wrong time though because everything else was under level 32.
---
What about Tank Killer, does that work with the gauss?
---
Radiation wouldn’t work the way in game as it does in real. Radiation in particular works considerably differently in the Fallout universe than in reality. For starters, while Fallout has radiation sickness, it's also capable of causing genetic mutations that are directly integrated into a creature's biology, leading to creatures like radscorpions, stingwings, and bloatflies. In reality, radiation simply damages DNA, causing it to replicate improperly and causing the body to function incorrectly. Also, in Fallout, simple hazard suits are shown to significantly or completely block radiation when worn, while in real life, the only way to block radiation is to place enough matter between you and the source to physically block the rays. A suit that truly protects you from gamma radiation would be too heavy to move in (although, in 3 and New Vegas, you can only have so much radiation resistance, about 85%, and in 4 1000%+ RR stil lets in 0.5 Rads. 
---
It all is zigzagged because off a struggle between the original designers; one designer exclusively attributed the mutation not to the radiation, but to the Forced Evolutionary Virus, a mutagenic Synthetic Plague that the US government was cooking up to facilitate bio-engineering projects before the war; when the bunkers containing F.E.V got blown up, the virus was scattered across the world and caused the mutations. The other designer hated this idea, because they felt this undermined the setting's Zeerust aesthetic. The generally accepted compromise is that all of the mutants stem from a cocktail of both radiation and F.E.V.
---
Sounds good mate! Sounds a bit like the BoS discord group! See you over the weekend sometime. Goodnight mate 
---
I agree. They’re slacking and it’s showing.
---
But they aren’t marketing or creating atom shop products instead of fixing the problems, the artists that create those skins etc are not the people who fix the bugs and crashes. Those are different skill sets.
---
I thought you could get one shotted in the game even if you don't PVP due to stacking and hacks/glitches. I think people who enjoy PVP in FO76 don't really have a lot of PVP games under their belts.
---
Thank you! I'm still looking for more!
---
Thank you!
---
Join the **R e s p o n d e r s**
---
For a public event, some people feel entitled to the sbq and anybody that goes there to kill it is just "leeching" 
---
This is likely a behavioral issue during their upbringing. 
---
Someone downvoted you, screw that guy. Have an upvote. Same thing happened to me and I lost 6 mods that I’d been saving. Only 2 were rare but it was in the early days and I didn’t know much about their rarity.dishesrtening.
---
Especially pipe weapons, they use a fucking screw as a trigger!
---
1. That's normal, you killed the SBQ and a bunch of other enemies, so there was lag
---
2. Next time walk far away enough that you could fast travel back there and then go back. Or just walk around the area for a minute or two
---
How does that work?
---
 It's not bad, but fakedoors.com takes care of all my door needs sorry Bethesda!
---
Happened last night to me on Xbox for the first time. Super frustrating 
---
QoL perks like weight reduction are a waste.
---
This just blew me away, thanks so much for sharing!! Definitely top of my FO Tour Of America list now :)
---
How can u get annoyed on rumors? Just ignore if u don’t wanna hear or see anything about it
---
See I don't have that thing but every once in a while I get that red highlight anyway.
---
I have an explosive laser Gatling. It’s so weak I don’t even use it to waste out my excess fusion cores.
---
As far as I know, Marine Armor Helmet plan is not available yet - I got it by scrapping that helmet I've been given by other player. I'm on PC though, so can't help you...
---
But grahm loves you anyway
---
I hit 10 yesterday, but that was a really full day of playing. Nothing really consistent about it that I can tell, mostly server not responding while trying to repair items or just a CTD out of the blue.
---
Internet would basically never cause crashes. It *may* be the pc but I would expect other things to crash also
---
Mine is your best chance,got mine at level 26,it's at room before death low
---
The mind boggles that Bethesda would prefer to ignore the fact that there player base is a lot older than fortnite and keep making fruit hats.
---
The decision to nerf legendary drops was a terrible one from a financial perspective as well because now everyone is spending money they could be spending in the atomic shop (if it had decent roleplay items) on TSE's from super farmers.
---
Literally everyone I come across in game has a selection of TSE's and based on the drop rates they must overwhelmingly be paid for
---
Lol, they want you to kill Van Helsing.
---
Finally, someone said it. (If it's been said before, I missed it.)
---
They seem completely unaware of what their players actually want to see in their game. 
---
I have made exactly 7 Atomic Shop purchases, all with earned atoms because FUUuuuuck paying SEVEN USD for a virtual bed. They were all CAMP items because building is the most fun part of the game for me, post-50. 
---
I would get more things, but most of the items either look terrible (Looking at you, Red Rocket Door), or are something that I would never use. (Most skins, and about 95% of the apparel, as I play in first-person, and mostly solo)
---
Side note - I have no idea how you guys see things/play in third person. HOW DO YOU SEE THE BOBBY PINS?
---
I would love more CAMP items, personally, but I want functional things. Aesthetic is nice, but I am a firm believer in function over form. Where are my weird Cooking Stations made with Human/Animal bones? Why do we not have Saloon Gates? Can we get Fish Ponds that serve as a placeable source of water? (Make a standard version plan that spawns in-world, and a premium version.) I'll stop rambling, now. 
---
Steep learning curve, semi-buggy physics, only private servers or solo play, and no story, quests...really any built-in purpose to the game.  
---
It’s not a game I openly recommend as it’s an acquired taste.
---
Being able to customize equipment and weapons as much as they want and also base build whatever they want without worrying about limits
---
Been waiting for a post like this. +1
---
well, Google search Fallout 76 free to play, and you will have a list of sites confirming that it is a total lie. Case closed
---
I run a two shot gatling gun permanently, I'd love to find a two shot explosive. Zero luck!
---
Perk / weight is managed if you have a team. You don't understand game design.
---
Here is your role play challenge: choose a perk loadout for next session and you're not allowed to change it under any circumstances. It will make you a better gamer to team up.
---
They're looking at continuity of government and command with these types of facilities, not to re-create civilization.   
---
Looks like a novelty door for a kid’s bedroom. Business as usual, then. 
---
Why? Bethesda already dissed that rumor. What are you afraid of?
---
This has never been confirmed. Not once. No video evidence has ever shown this to be true. most likely a widely over hyped hoax
---
I know it's a lie, thata why its annoying.
---
I think if anyone's PA causes it, everyone can see it
---
The Forest area has a huge river.  Anywhere along that, you'll have a very easy time defending.  No worry of nukes, no worry of high level monsters.
---
Forest is pretty much the safest place.
---
I would like to add something to the VATS section:
---
Firing your weapon while VATS is still 'zooming in' will definitely result in a miss, even with the hit percentage number already showing 95% (unless the target is in the middle of your screen). 
---
This is especially noticeable with the Gauss Rifle; if you even start charging the weapon before you go into VATS, or while the system is still zooming in, the weapon will simply fire on the middle of the screen, regardless of how much time you've already waited to release the shot. It seems like that initiating an attack before VATS completely finishes zooming in, will result in said shot simply not being treated as a VATS shot, but simple hip-fire instead.
---
Even just cosmetic pets that can't be harmed or do anything. 
---
Flatwoods
---
They aren't rumors... they are lies, Bethesda already confirmed that they aren't going to make it free to play. People are just using it to get clicks.
---
I’m not talking about carrying, I’m not talking about the BoS vertibirding us in. It seems to me like your over thinking this whole thing. You should not require an outside source to be a place for players to connect. The game should HOUSE a source where players can connect. It is logical and very realistic seeing as this whole game is based on roaming wastelands MULTIPLAYER style. Why should I have to come to reddit to say “hey I’m going to be doing X thing over here, all are welcome to join” when I could just do that in the game seeing as that’s the medium I’m playing on anyway. The “theme” of this game it to play with other players in the game not connect with people on reddit to buy/sell/trade and team up on the outside before entering a game. I’m not saying it’s bad but it shouldn’t be needed. It’s the same as fast traveling to vault 76 is all it would need be.
---
This is especially frustrating with weapons that require charging before releasing a single shot (eg. Gauss Rifle).
---
Act that way in real life and you’ll get your skull smashed. Don’t be a cunt, it’s dangerous.
---
Yesterday i was at my girlfriend partents house watch their dogs. Whole day on internet, hope i dont kill anyone driving my car on way home. Cause i want to.
---
On PC? You can move them out the folder they're stored in. They won't show in load screens though.
---
I'm not afraid... I'm annoyed to see it all over the place even though Bethesda already said it isn't happening.
---
1) Wear, not where 
---
2) The issue at hand is why am I spawning midway in the sky? I shouldn't have to put on my PA every time I want to return to my CAMP 
---
I think there are only 5 mods, ring scope, standard barrel, charging, automatic and Shotgun :) 
---
And that there is kind of my point. 😁.  I go right for pretty much a similar weapon combo because all the stuff leading up to it is "rubbish".  But would it be considered as rubbish if it wasnt so easy to blow past to get to that hardened suppressed rifle? 
---
  i just unlocked a drum mag for the handmade on the 2nd-3rd weapon scrap.  Why would i even check out any of the others?  I'm happy i found it, but damn that was fast
---
so then dont bother calling in sick for work, got it thank you
---
Lol wut? Bandolier is useless for a HW build? So he wants to fight the SBQ with 100 round for his HW?
---
Good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Yea, I'm tired of it too, and it's just the next bandwagon for everyone to jump on.. I heard it on Youtube, it MUST be true!! Topics like that come up in large waves for like a week, then drop off. I wonder what will be next??
---
Happened to me with 3 t60 calibrated shocks! Saved 4 up for my second character and a friend, was then farming for maxed out t60 sets. When I finally got two sets the disappointment was unmeasurable. Since those aren’t THAT rare (compared to x01 shocks), I found another 3 in the last week. But STILL: Time and of course 1,5 k caps GONE. They can detect dupers, I hope that they’re able to detect those glitches and give us our items back. But I have not a good feeling about this...
---
I recently got a double shot black powder pistol which isn't the worst for higher level hostiles, slow as hell though lol. Id be down to buy one for caps if anyone is reading this and has an extra low enough for my level, an explosive round weapon I mean, just sayin
---
Havent gone through the patch notes yet, amazing news! Thanks 
---
They never know what hit em
---
screws, gears, springs, concrete, fertilizer, plans, weapons, drugs, ammo, lead, you name it can all be found in quantity in abandoned bog town, 
---
on the west side of town there are lots of drugs that spawn in the bathrooms of the various trailers, and there are a number of chem boxes and mirrors that can be pharma farmed
---
in the middle of town the police station and two tall buildings with scaffolding have huge amounts of stuff in them, the police station spawns leveled smg, combat rifle, and a ton of ammo, as well as several straight jackets. The tallest building has a "secret" room accessed by dropping down the elevator on the roof, and has a dozen typewriters, phones, clipboards, pencils, and a couple globes on top of a lot of searchable desks and lockers. below that is a construction room with \~90 concrete in bags, paint, and some random tools as well as a leveled sledgehammer. in the ground floor are several weapons, some canned food in a corner, and several additional drug spawns. On the roof adjoining that building is a room with a chained door, which can be accessed by a hole in the roof, and has a ton of fertilizer in bags as well as a chemistry bench.
---
North there is a dinner that spawns food recipes, as well as a couple tables plans can rarely spawn on, a bit more paint.
---
south has a red rocket with a tone of leather if you want to spam craft armor, as well as oil, there is a 50 cal spawn on a truck near the scaffolding towards the center.
---
The east side has the workshop veins, gold, silver, acid, oil, and triple concrete, as well there is a tinker bench in the workshop.
---
It's the best one stop shop I have yet to find, and has kept me well stocked for almost 120 levels at this point without much need to farm elsewhere for general purpose maintenance. 
---
10-4 thanks
---
yep i just searched it up, Bethesda gave there statement less then 48 hours ago... all the videos from the bigger youtubers are atleast 3-2 days old if not older
---
I'm thinking the next big rumor will be unconfirmed private servers... I hope we get them but no confirmation so far.
---
I got attacked by scorched there.
---
Bug seems to be if your materials are split up between Stash and Inventory.  If you transfer them all to exist in one location (usually store all junk in Stash) it works.
---
All I want to point out is that levels only matter to 50. So it's more like a level 50 vs a 42. The only thing it means is more play time and more perk cards. 
---
Please do! If you need a companion I'll come thru for some house wrecking fuck, I've got caps to blow. 
---
Like I said, all perks apply to a weapon type, so if you want heavy weapons perks like bear arms to apply then the heavy weapons damage perks apply as well. They could probably fix it fairly easily, but they've known about this since the day the patch was released (maybe earlier) and it's been a month and a half with no fix.
---
Best guess is they actually knew this would happen but figured the trade off was more important than leaving it alone. So it went from a strong ass weapon into a useless one. I have a two shot AGL and the perk changes made me sad, now TS is getting a 75% damage nerf and I'm considering just throwing it away.
---
Just filtered by "today" on YouTube and still found several. That's what prompted me to make this post.
---
Is that like an actual thing I can do like the quest  perk where u don’t take rad damage in fallout 4
---
Fast travel to 76 does break immersion, but it doesn't totally destroy it.
---
You're under thinking it - why not just post contact info / schedule? What are your ideas beyond carrying and being boring? Anything even mildly fun or you just want to show off your TSE and dupes?
---
You're stealing my content demanding worthless features.
---
I often have about 3K+ rounds on me. what are you using, grenades? nukes?
---
you people are terrible with weight management.
---
I have a level \~110 and rerolled a sniper at the beginning of the week. The 110 melee gave me a lot of bad habits since I couldn't die to really anything and 1 hit all but bosses. 
---
For a ranged build, if you play carefully you can use whatever armor is lying around but build a good gun. At 25 I could take out any level I spawned into though level 68 would kill me if I got more than 1 or 2.
---
I played 14 hours yesterday and had to repair twice, I know of several places where there are no enemies at all to attack it so the poor placement is on you, I don't see why it is their problem when you are free to put it somewhere else.
---
There’s also some kind of “lobbing barrel” or receiver I had once, made a large orb of splash damage that sticks to the ground and does a sort of burning damage... fires kinda like a Fat Man but with a much sharper arc
---
Fast traveling, being eaten by lvl 1 mole rats at the starring  area motel before I can load in, crashing losing all my junk, and when I relogin I find myself back at the fire station with 2 scorch  beasts above me while having almost  no hp  left.
---
The area north of New Gad is really flat, has water, and there's even an iron deposit somewhere. The only threat is the super mutants and scorched that inhabit New Gad. But they are low level so they shouldn't be too much a problem.
---
The scorchbeast and fast travelling issue I fuck with too hard. 
---
Atoms shop to me has the most boring, stupid items ive ever seen in a game shop.  
---
The only thing that was actually worth getting was the blackbird PA paint.  
---
Bad enough the $$/atom is shit, but holy fuck, at least have items worth it.  
---
BoI did you played som MMo before 2010
---
Faction specific skins for flags and other items like barriers!! Also some faction specific signs would be dope.
---
Lol. Hopefully I smash your base. Nice threats on the Internet, if people act like they do in video games you probably whine all day. 
---
I am not 100% sure on this, but it seems to be working for me. 
---
In build mode, pick up your camp box, and rotate it so that the little crooked antenna thing is pointing where you want to spawn. It should place you about 20ft away from it in that direction. 
---
Aw rest in treats to your bull mastiff. My 16 year old golden retriever passed over 10 years ago now-- it's incredible how much you can miss a little animal.  
---
Dude in love beagles. Shes absolutely precious. Ive always wanted one! Love the name amber too hahah my dogs also have people names. 
---
These are my two mongrels: http://imgur.com/gallery/0If3y7w
---
Brook on the left,  Teddy on the right. Both rescues who were former strays. 
---
I can't imagine going 10 years without a dog. I went a couple years when i was stationed in korea,  but in would feed the strays outside thr barracks haha.  As soon as i got back stateside i volunteered at a dog shelter after work... then little Brook came back (i had fostered her in Oklahoma),but that's a long story! 
---
I’ve experienced the one with invisibility.
---
as if they needed any encouragement. 
---
i don't use PA and the servers still crash daily 
---
You've really made the graaaaaade.
---
I hate spoilers too but there are only 60 known people on earth that have hyperthymesia. That’s less than 0.00000001% of the global population. You won’t be remembering that code unless you read it over and over for several minutes and then keep repeating it afterwards.
---
Personally, the people are both the best and the worst part of the game.
---
I tried launching a nuke once, CTD just as i'm about to hit the button, log back in to be outside like nothing ever happened. Haven't tried since and likely won't.
---
You’re speaking like a crash every 2.5 minutes is uncommon in Fallout 76. Trust me, it’s definitely not. 
---
I only had a minute before work but that allowed me to listen to the most important part of the video.  The intro and thank you for not starting with "HEEEEEYYY YOUTUBES ITS YOUR BOY/GIRL ANNOYINGFACE!"
---
Yeah it’s a pretty shitty feeling to see all your hard work go for nothing. I won’t be launching a nuke for a while now it seems. 
---
stop doing that then lol, only watch videos released by JuiceHead, Mattyplays and the quatering if you actually want the news intime.
---
You can’t damage my base and I was warning you. I don’t bother threatening people, if someone pisses me off I just hurt them straight away. Teaches them a lesson faster than any threat will.
---
I don't remember Tibia crashing every 10 minutes
---
One issue I had with Scorched Earth was spawning in on the event marker. Evidently, it drops you right on, or under, the SBQ.  Which, ordinarily is kinda nice. 
---
My shit luck happened to spawn me directly over a fissure. 
---
The garb isn't great. It has some bonuses to sneaking and stuff, and it gets better once you get the eye to wear with it, but even when you upgrade it to maximum level, the dr/er is nowhere close to what you get from 5 pieces of armor, not to mention the armor mods; need more carry weight? AP? Explosion resistance? Deep pockets, ultra light, dense, muffled, shadowed... There's a ton of options that you just throw away not wearing armor. And on top of that, each of the 5 pieces of armor can have up to 3 legendary effects. And don't forget the underarmor. Fully upgraded vault/bos/enclave/whatever suit gives a pretty decent set of stat boosts.
---
Unless you are running around in power armor 90% of the time, or avoiding armor entirely for something like the chameleon mutation (even then, you're better off scrounging up a full set of Weightless armor), there's just no contest between the Garb and armor. The tattered dress, on the other hand, is objectively the best outfit in the game, being the*only* (as far as I'm aware) over-armor outfit that is not just purely cosmetic.  People may look at me funny, call me a cross dresser or whatever, but +1 perception is +1 perception.
---
Far far south and a little east, down by the bear on the map there are some lakes, I have put my camp in a few spots where I have never seen a bad guy, just the occasional fox.
---
Yeah, me too. Go mine. Is there a tangible improvment of the prototype Hazmat compared to the normal one? Both have a 1000 rad prot.
---
Farm the deathclaw on deathclaw island, and Grahm will show up basically every 10-15 mins while hopping(in my experience)
---
FYI with some  CAMP Hocus Pocus you can expand you CAMP on put some floor in the monorail cars roof. This allow you and outdoorsey are for crafting tables and PA station. 
---
I’ve actually never been unlucky enough to spawn on it, and I’ve done it a few times. That’s some shit luck dude. 
---
No point in doing so until all dupe exploits are fixed and the people with 100k or more nuka-colas in their inventory have their inventory wiped or are banned. 
---
Almost exactly happened to me and my first ever nuke - I was 107 lvl, done launch prep all by myself, launched a nuke on Prime Fissure and few mins after fight started, I was disconnected from the server - I didn't play in a team, so I couldn't even dream of coming back to finish the fight. Luckily few hours later someone else launched a nuke, I went to help and we manage to kill it quite fast (like 15 minutes). Someone obviously had cryolator and slooooowed her down on the ground, so it was nice and easy.
---
You realize OP has 9 strength right?
---
That’s pretty unlucky. At least it wasn’t for nothing!
---
For some reason I think Mothmen are the fucking cutest things ever 
---
Same on PC
---
Nothing gets auto scrapped when you put it in your stash. Always scrap it at a workbenches before you put junk in your stash.
---
...except for thing that need to be whole for crafting like hardened mass etc.
---
 there's no difference apart from an aesthetic one,  the prototype is yellow
---
I have done 5 this week and I solo in them. There is still 4 teams beside me there and we have no problems for over an hour. I also don’t farm Legendaries and just go for xp. If you were expecting to still get 10 Legendaries per round and have someone leave group, log off and come back to respawn, it’s not happening anymore. It shouldn’t have been like that from the start. The mobs still respawn but not nearly as fast. I would say every 20 mins now. Which is what you would expect. 
---
So this will be scattered because I'm still waking up, but here are my thoughts.  
---
On the very first advertising for Fallout 3 that I saw emphasized that you could kill mutants with Teddy bears. The Rock-It launcher I think it was.  
---
I hated it.  I played Fallout 1&amp;2 when I was about 16 and I thought that Bethesda was ruining my beloved franchise with gimmicks and FPS gameplay just so they could cater to console players and CoD bros.
---
But let's get real.  You could shoot monsters in the groin from the very first game.  There were quests with weird cheesy NPCs and LOADS of pop culture references.  Fallout 2 was legitimately kind of a mess that way.  Monty Python references just everywhere, an overpowered Red Ryder BB gun referencing Christmas Story.
---
Fallout has NEVER been a serious, grim post-apocalyptic hellscape kind of game.  If anything, Fallout 3 was the deepest dive into that territory that they've taken, and I thought it was kind of overdone when I played through it originally.  What you're really experiencing, my dude, is what happens when you get older.  The new thing clashes with your nostalgia, which is uncomfortable.  But in a lot of ways, once you get past the surface silliness that's around in the atomic shop or whatever, this is the most grim and depressing Fallout story yet.  
---
All of the people who were here before you in Appalachia died.  Every story ended before you got there.  You just sift through their belongings, sometimes accomplishing what they couldn't, sometimes just dropping their last words into a paper bag on the ground and walking away.  This is a very different kind of Fallout story.  It's downright haunting at times, and I really appreciate what they've done here.
---
Right....
---
I think OP means that caps cap should be higher, but shared on your account. For instance, instead of mulling 25k caps on alts, you could hold the whole amount on main, while not being able to collect more on alt. This way you won't have to bend over backwards to move goods/caps around.
---
I see Grahm around Sunshine Meadows a lot.
---
congratz, so far I have only been able to collect 3.14159 of these.
---
47 times in a row? That's the part I'm questioning. And that anyone would sit there trying for 2 or more hours to play a game that would literally be crashing about a minute or less after you fully loaded into the game.
---
The game crashes at different rates for different people for sure. But this guy is clearly exaggerating. He's not the first person that has done so. And then come clean that they were. 
---
Again, if he's having this much trouble, there's likely a big issue on his end. It's not all Bethesda if its this much. 
---
Sorry, we are all playing the same game, connecting to the same servers. The fact that I can play for hours without any of this. Perfect example, fought the Queen last night. There was ten of us there fight, all the mobs, the sonic and acid attacks. 
---
While at times a little laggy, still was able to play, fight, and not get disconnected. 
---
Explain why some people can have my experience, and why some people are being disconnected every 2.5 minutes. 
---
My favorite site to camp at for no reason other than scenery is on the cliff just west of the crashed space station. It’s an awesome view. Not the most ideal place as far as flat ground is concerned, but it’s pretty easy to build there now that we have the bulldozer feature. And with careful camp placement you can even place an industrial water purifier in the small stream down below. [Here’s a video I made of my recent camp in that location.](https://youtu.be/zqVGEh2N_fw)
---
I have 10. what's your point?
---
Fuck. 
---
Haha my parents have a shih tzu named Charles. Never though i "liked" little dogs but can't resist that little stinky fluff ball. Even though he sneaks onto the kitchen counter and rains treats down to the other dogs. 
---
I'm glad you agree that you are exaggerating. Now stop. 
---
I've had that happen twice after this last update. It got so bad with silos/nuke zones that I quit doing them all together. I contacted Bethesda and got a reply, made a thread on here but for time sake. Couple questions:
---
1: have you tried to delete game data, uninstall then reinstall the game? Deleting the gake files from your system does not delete character saves, just pictures you have taken in the photo mode, option settings, and controller settings. 
---
2: does your power armor have Targeting HUD mod on the helmet? Since I have done the reinstall all but one crash I was wearing PA with targeting HUD. There is a bug with that mod right now. It tries to give the perk to your team and the game freaks out and bombs. The only other crash (in over 15 hours of gameplay) was just random, and they do happen. 
---
Since I have done the reinstall and stopped wearing PA with Targeting HUD I have had next to no issues. I have done half a dozen queen fights and had frame rate drop but that is it. Before I did this I was crashing at times 3 or 4 times an hour. Started after the last update. 
---
I see what you did there 🤓
---
This has happened to me, I’ve also been downed waiting for a Stim when she died and didn’t get credit for the event. It happens, don’t lose hope. A couple rounds of breach and clear and you’ll be swimming in ammo.
---
Ad Victoriam 
---
isn't that just your lack of self control? There's plenty of people who don't have problems with that.
---
Lol you can't take any stress, no discipline. I don't think you've hurt anyone in your life. You wouldn't survive in the real world. If I find your base I'll destroy it then teabag you then take your junk too. 
---
You're spawning in midair because the quality of the coding is substandard. Of course you shouldn't have to but that's primarily down to Bethesda for a poor quality product. Given the reality of the situation - you can either wear PA or take fall damage - that's your 2 choices.
---
And far better equipment. Not some Excavator PA and pipe rifle right from some mutie, but T60 + Gauss, optimized perks, some upgrades I'll get probably in two months and the right to shoot first. Sure, we're nearly even /s
---
People don't play the same way you do.  Shocking.
---
I had Dogmeat as a companion in FO4. He was nowhere to be found. Assumed he bugged out. I was sneaking by some supermutants, and all of a sudden comes Dogmeat running around a corner!
---
The Suiciders didn't see me; they saw Dogmeat. 
---
I channelled my inner Eustace Bagge to the fullest extent that day. 
---
Balacing PvE with PvP never worked. Last time I remembered that happened was with Destiny but on a much smaller scale. 
---
I never understood why they didnt create an option where you could easier opt-in or opt-out of the pvp play. I also couldnt care less about pvp and as I read here most people dont.  
---
I agree, don't do it just yet until there's been a wipe/ban wave, but in the future at some point?
---
My first moth boi startled me and I evidentally shot him, he didn't like that.
---
I died alot
---
There is just no fun in pvp whatsoever though.
---
Fighting over a landmark is the only time you can have a good fight and even then, being the Victor is just a matter of who gets bored first.
---
It might as well not even be in the game.
---
You could stack items ready for a fight only for the enemy to ignore you, or not do so and find the enemy buffs heavily, walks up to you and 1 shots you in the face with a shotgun in vats... 
---
Yes. The wheelbarrow holds fertilizer. 
---
Funny thing about foundations, it's like they have an invisible set of stairs built in, the brahmin is just "climbing" them.
---
Thats true it does sorta preview in game... but not in the store itself, where i buy things.
---
It feels less like implementing a preview, and more like sneaky in game advertisement.
---
Okay, yeah everyone has the same game and that’s fine and all, but did you ever take to consider not everyone runs the same PC specs?
---
You have to consider how poorly unoptimised this game currently is. When I first got the game I think I had an average crash of about 5 minutes, and that is no exaggeration. The game was unplayable because by the time I loaded in I had about 3 and a half minutes to do my thing before I crashed. 
---
Lol theres a huge greyhound rescue where my SO is living right now in GA. Apparently they just outlawed dog racing in Florida, so homelesss purebred dogs are flooding in to the Southern states. I absolutely want one... but my SO capped us at two dogs... and we already have two :(
---
Not ranty at all. I was excited to build a pipe rifle because I had a literal fuck ton of. 38. Using all the mods I had I built my Level 35 pipe rifle with drum magazine because I'm going to pepper those low tier mobs in Woods to death with my super tricked out pipe rifle.
---
Drum magazine increased magazine from 15 to 18. Whoopty fucking doo. I even rebuilt it twice, once immediately once an once after a restart incase it was a bug.
---
Nope.
---
The abundance of useless mods means you harvest them quick quick.
---
Maybe I'm misremembering but didn't FO4 have standard, quick reload, large and large quick reload? 
---
Fact all fast travel breaks immersion
---
Fact it’s not boring to know you can team up with current players on your server 
---
Fact posting contact info on exterior sources shouldn’t be needed as the game should handle itself
---
Fact no one cares if you have a TSE weapon 
---
Fact duping is retarded and shouldn’t have been possible in the game in the first place but guess what it was and there is no solution for it other than to ignore it, inspect every stash and remove those items, or to out right ban those player who are actively destroying the economy before implementing a player vendor system. 
---
Fact this game is already unrealistic and your acting like I’m asking for them to put a hold on some content they probably already have completed and I’m not.
---
You find a problem with me wanting a better way of connecting with other players and I find that very sad since the whole point is multiplayer and building a community. I’m sorry you’re level 200 and have duped every over powered weapon in the game and are ready for the next big creature but some of us want to just pick up the game, play with different people kill shit, and then put it down after 2 hours and do something productive.
---
Press "R" to pay respect...
---
Oh wait...
---
You already DID! ;)
---
I've reread this but don't understand.   
---
Prototype hazmat suit if different.  
---
Got mine from the responder wondering bot
---
Eventually it was ok, but I felt terrible when I was disconnected, all my preparations, all silo launch preps for nothing. I play strictly solo (only trading with other players), so I was really disappointed when my first nuke failed. And I so wanted to make it properly - I've collected card by myself (not bought), I've collected all the codes from officers for silo bravo using enclave computer, I've decrypted it by myself (using guides of course, but not going to sites that public codes every week) and all that for nothing...
---
This happened on console, because it runs better on my Xbox than it does my PC (that really says something about this game). 
---
I’m not sure if I’m using Targeting HUD, but I’ll have to have a look. Thanks!
---
Correction: American flamethrowers were garbage. Everyone else had pretty good designs for them. The first american flamethrower was so fucking bad, that while they started rolling out the brand new M1 flamers to troops, they were already working on the M2 flamethrower. 
---
While we're at it, I don't want to scrap half of watoga to hold down the trigger on a lmg for 3 seconds.
---

Krusty crab is unfair
---
Yeah I guess you’re right. Just gotta soldier on. 
---
Ad Victoriam brother. 
---
Oh man! Yours put mine to shame!
---
This was absolutely beautiful and gave me some ideas, as I'm currently renovating mine. 
---
http://imgur.com/a/xCgazsw
---
When my camp was built in the forest it was constantly attacked by super mutants, now that it’s in watoga it almost never gets attacked and when it does I just get precious food stuffs 
---
don't launch nukes unless you have more supplies than you know what to do with. half of the time it's gonna kick you out.
---
I mean, do you honestly expect the game to work for 45+ minutes during a nuke? fat chance!
---
shows the current state of Fo76.
---
Yeah no kidding. It’s sad to see all that self worth you have after doing everything properly just go to shit in the matter of seconds. 
---
Think I got a bunch of prewar money, wasn’t impressed so I broke him.
---
Yeah. I kinda gave it the benefit of the doubt. Thanks Bethesda you godtier developer. 
---
Right, Bethesda said it ain’t happening and we still got JuiceHead making clickbait YouTube videos discussing it? It was already clarified by the publisher we don’t need some non professional journalist out here clarifying for clicks 
---
Fair play, thanks for the informed response 
---
Unless you have the "silent but deadly" perk.
---
&gt;I only used it cos I had like 500 fuel in my stash but I then started to warm to it
---
I see what you did there...
---
SCREEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
yes.
---
I hear you! I had to stop picking up bears because they'll just get scrapped. I hope they figure out a way to display at least the bears, if nothing else. So many pieces of display furniture with nothing to display. :-\
---
Lol. I didn’t share my experience for your approval kiddo. I could give a fuck what you think or feel about it. Why would you be under the impression I am, I don’t know. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Happened to me, and I didn’t know what it was. Thanks!
---
JuiceHead started with hate videos on fallout 76, to “opinion” videos and “update” videos, dude is no more of a tool or anymore credible than any other trash YouTuber who just makes videos for clicks.
---
You guys should go into the silo and take a picture next to the missile. Or get a shot of one in the background launching from the silo 👍
---
Dude, the game starts after you install it and accept terms (w/e it is, Eula, cluf).  
---
Every. single. game retro-actively bans players who abuse any exploit, glitch, etc... they deem "too damaging not to be punished". People actually got banned from Fallout 76 for role-playing as homophobic nazis...  
---
&gt;  Anyone with common sense would know duplicating is wrong, but like I  keep saying, that's not what happened. What we have here is a company  without a clear vision, unable to appropriately handle their failings,  and a large subsection of the community that has seemingly never been  the victim of false accusations. The idea that the burden of prove  should be placed upon me is ridiculous and I know that you know it.  
---
Just look at OP, OP deleted his post, but OP is a liar and a cheeky cunt, check his previous posts, you find a (bad) dubstep song he composed on youtube, which leads to his youtube page, which have fallout 76 "TSE one-shotting PVP" sequences, vid description ? "was inspired by another cheater's video lololol".  
---
So hmmm... at this point I wonder, people "who claimed to be falsely banned" are in fact cheaters/dupers/bug exploiters. BGS has all the "clear vision" to gather stats and make "dupers behaviors" models out of it, then refine it, and finally make a "ban wave".  
---
Currently we have no clue if there is "confirmed" false-bans, and we barely know what BGS based their decisions upon.  
---
Once again, in statistics you can be an exception but it wouldn't confirm they're banning innocent players, and the more you post on reddit, the more suspicious you make it.  
---
I'm not the one asking you to post proofs, IDC, i'm telling you to deal with it with BGS support because false-bans CAN happen.  
---
Now for the "reddit is trash" concept, you're here (on a suspicious thread by a "real" cheater) venting without showing anything from a simple screenshot of the mail BGS sent you (you're banned because, yada yada).  
---
Either post and provide, or don't and don't. You don't do things half-way here. Reddit is full of private inspectors and you're taking their fun away by making claims you can't sustain.
---
&gt; Here is a little experiment for you, prove to me that you have not  duplicated items without getting onto your account. The fact is you  couldn't prove that even if you did have access but i'd like to  introduce you to my struggle. If you want to really make it fair, give  me 60 dollars and something you have spent hundreds of hours on to hold  hostage. I'll wait right here while you figure that out. 
---
Just because that makes sense to you, doesn't mean it's a great example. Here's an easy example : without starting the game, I can tell you my account is not banned, which still is a pretty big sophism, because it's basically saying "because I'm not punished yet, I'm innocent". That's also the principle behind "innocent 'til proven guilty", you were \_ACTIVELY\_ banned for something, be it a false flag from their ban detection system.  
---
You can't go outside, look for people and tell me "look, you can't prove you didn't rob a bank, go tell that cop not to arrest me because it's the same thing, they can't prove it", yet there's cops after you... yada yada.  
---
You could be innocent, you'd still get detained and probably arrested, and then they'd do their job, look at pictures twice, get your fingerprints, yada yada. &lt;-- this is the "irl" equivalent of reaching the support and EXPLAINING YOURSELF.  
---
Something you don't seem inclined to do, as you posted on reddit, which makes you even more suspicious.  
---
&gt; If you want to really make it fair, give me 60 dollars and something you  have spent hundreds of hours on to hold hostage. I'll wait right here  while you figure that out. 
---
Once again, you may know it's a "woopsie i'm innocent" situation, but they (bgs) don't : 
---
1. you refuse to contact BGS support  
---
2. you're arguing on reddit instead of doing the right thing (see step 1)
---
3. the more you post, the more suspicious you get (why post on reddit if you're not trying to show you're innocent, like, a screenshot of your ban, or else there's no point to post your issue here ? What's the purpose of NOT reaching support and NOT trying to cast light on yourself on reddit ?)  
---
It's not even about your proving you're innocent, which you can't be, it's about you showing GOOD FAITH god damn it.  
---
It actually looks suprising good when worn with Nuka Cola T-51 instead of the T-51 helmet
---
You are a hero
---
We have a fun and laid back group that does SBQ on the regular. We also share resources and can make you some more ammo. If you are on PC we would love for you to join us!
---
But 🤔 it still would be a huge downside if i would suffer from withdrawal all the time or not? 
---
I try to use alk only in combat or when i have to carry more stuff or when im thirsty 😅  
---
Just jungleing through the woods without alc 🙄 
---
Both good sir or madam.
---
Do you maybe have other suggestions to my build? (:
---
As amazing as this sounds, my PC is currently bronk so I’m restricted to Xbox. 
---
There need to be players like you console, but you know how it is. 
---
They all need a buff
---
You can use prototype at level 1
---
As long as you link your account to the Bethesda launcher EVERYONE who purchased fallout 76 before like January 2019 gets them for free 
---
Inventory space ?
---
The story has just moved below the surface is all. You need to read more, listen to all the extra stuff, really want to know what happened.
---
Well that escalated quickly. 😳
---
That was the other game
---
I agree completely! I would LOVE to see a perks load out. I have several time consuming load outs.
---
The cringe is strong with this one
---
Ok, how many hours did you spend when you had the 47 disconnects? 
---
Also, if you are swearing and replying you certainly do care. You care i'm calling you out. You care that I'm pointing out the math of what you are claiming. Your words give me that impression. 
---
My keyboard seems fine but it’s razer too.
---
No, private servers would be good news. Most of the click bait seem to be negative hateful videos
---
Well there's your problem. Move your camp to a lowbie zone, you silly goose.
---
There is armor mod reducing staggering.
---
Thank the guy who does the Forgotten Weapons channel on youtube!
---
I mean I'm not asking for loads of screws. Even one would do and they'd soon start to rack up 
---
For real? Why I never saw this one before :o
---
Ok I play since the beta and saw a burning chainsaw a few days ago for the first time. Damn now I'm also interested in that tesla again haha
---
You can get some in the HZ-21 disposal site building
---
Yes it’s sad
---
But I don’t like using an exploit to rebuild my camp with the chance of being banned for it someday so the safest route it to not accept invites and have others pay their 14 caps or so 
---
My worst day was yesterday. On a normal day i get about 1 disconnect every 2 hrs or so. I loong on and have no problems so I decide to finally go get my Fussion Gen plans. 
---
I log over to Start the event and it very low level....most MOBS are level 6 or so. I am level 123 and well equiped so should not be a problem. it is a 1 hr timed event that can be done in 20-30 mins solo once you learn the layout of the place. Also there are 3 plans and to get the fusion Gen Plans you need to run this event 3 times. So if including some time for server hops you are looking at 1-2 hrs to get it done.
---
Took me 6 hrs. 15 server crashes, several while doing the last phase of the event. Once has to abandon the event when I got stuck in the Ceiling while using VATS to kill a turret.
---
6 hrs to run an event 3 times. An event 100+ levels below me. This was painful.
---
Once the atom points are awarded they are mine and I won't waste them on the stuff currently cluttering up the shop. No matter how they were gained.
---
Well I got my flamethrower info from cracked.com, quite a lot of informative articles there, though I may not have remembered that it was specifically the American M1 Flamethrower. Bright side, flamethrowers don’t explode when you shoot the tank...you just get knocked on your ass because of the pressure release...though it’s up to you to decide which is more dignified XD 
---
This is actually painful because it was about 7ish hours for me due to same reason. 
---
Yeah when I saw tickets were $400 I figured it must be much farther than I'm thinking
---
It’s known? I couldn’t find anything about it, everyone seems to be fine with disabling vsync and mouse acceleration. :( 
---
Have you overclocked anything too?
---
My friend has a camp west of vault 76 and north of mothman museum along the river and he only ever gets attacked by the occasional mole rat or 2, and there is a junk deposit.
---
? My Gatling gun can chew through groups of super mutans far far than my rifleman and handle trios of scorch beats better too I think. Sure, you give up massive burst damage and you do really smash through ammo, but heavy guna work more effectively in group fights and even the constant DPS out does the bursty DPS that my rifle man does I am pretty sure. I want balance, no need to make us OP.
---
Except on the gorge bridge. I want to set up camp and offer base jumping on Bridge Day :(
---
It's cool if you want to disregard what I said above. I know you can lock those but I don't bother because my stash is always so full, and purified water drops on almost every event quest reward.
---
I'm simply providing the locked doors solution to some workshops (ammo factory anyone?) in order to prevent mobs from gaining access willy nilly. Y'know, defense strategies.
---
I’m out of troll food for the night, sorry kid. 
---
This actually makes a ton of sense. I see it randomly sometimes where everything is highlighted. Ill try take more note of it, my most recent crash was about 15 minutes after a queen kill and I was in my PA using targeting HUD.
---
erm if you don't want to unlock the upgrades so fast, stop dismantling weapons...pretty simple really.
---
I love how vats targets my Brahmin. Like I want to shoot the poor thing.....
---
Shoutout to 1999 for making me say Cool Story Bro 
---
I had this issue I took everything needed out of my stash and put it all back it and it worked for me hope this helps . 
---
Probably the most satisfying pick up.. I've never won one of those machines in real life so..
---
OC - yes, factory setting.
---
As far as I can tell, I saw this topic a lot in reddit.
---
Vsync os off.
---
Acc is on I guess, don´t want to set it off and on back and forth.
---
Don’t know what it reduces or for which SPECAL might affect you a lot or not at all
---
Pneumatic. It doesn't work super great IME
---
RIP dogmeat...and Cassidy...and everyone else, including me
---
Whitesprings is probably the top contender for future hub style updates
---
My first time there I actually thought it was the hub.
---
All the empty rooms like stages and diners upstairs, as well as the locked rooms seem to point to it being updated over time, potentially with our own private rooms.
---
It's also in the center of the map and right next to the best farming spot in the game 
---
Yeah you're probably right... My suggestion was too 'kind' for a YongYea video. 
---
Got an lvl 1 suit and an lvl 5 suit where you can get the Nuka Powerarmor paint is :) 
---
Wait you can tame animals? Which ones?
---
Only if it's perry Winkle blue
---
Would you even suggest fireproof as a way to mitigate explosive dmg a lot?
---
Thanks, I’ll try that, I hope it works
---
not sure tbh. I don't PvP much, but u/brainceps would know.
---
You go to modify/repair, choose weapon and Paint is always on the bottom on the list - there you can paint weapon (armor works exactly the same). You must remember, that paints are usually available on limited kind of weapons (i.e my tricentennial one works only for 10mm, laser gun and hatchet).
---
Maybe explore the world and search ? Makes the game way more fun 
---
I had the same issue when needing to craft baited mines had the required stuff unable to build again removing all items from stash and replacing fixed it . Good luck bud 
---
If it doesn’t work just try to relog that’s what I did when I couldn’t create some pa
---
From my own personal testing it seems to be a flat amount of damage per hit. Not percentage based. My TSE Dragon min/maxed at around 4200 damage does the same damage as everything would differently. Bumping damage numbers through bobbleheads, perks, etc does nothing. Show me a video of someone ACTUALLY killing you through slap damage. 
---
Guys, did you hear fo76 is going free to play??
---
Have to enter the MOD screen for the right weapon. I believe you have the one for the Hunting rifle right?
---
So have a HR in your inventory goto a weapons crafting station and select mod/repair. Then mod the HR. there should be a MOD spot for paint.
---
hope it helps.
---
You just don't want to say how many hours you spent playing when you claim you got 47 disconnects, because it seriously undermines your claim.
---
If you say to high a number, to make the times between disconnects seem more reasonable, then people are going do just what i did. Question why you spent so many hours doing the same thing over and over, hoping for different results.
---
If it's too low, people are going to assume you are exaggerating. Like you have in other threads. 
---
You might be having a higher rate of disconnects than others. But you are clearly exaggerating. People do that because they think making something sound worse will get them faster results. 
---
Plus, it really does sound like a problem on your end. 
---
Now, reply again to show me just how much you don't care. 
---
My camp os below the snake on the map near whitespring golf course i never get attacked there 
---
Over-encumbered since the BETA lol.. 150+ hours played like that
---
You go through a lot of ammo until you get a good shotgun. Then a couple hundred will last a while. 
---
Yea but why 
---
I’ve just done that quest and won’t be using it, if your on Xbox you’re welcome to have it for free

I had this issue last week. I had exactly the right quantity of the black titanium needed, but all materials were still grayed out and I got the message that I didn't have enough. I had to go out and collect a few more titanium and then it worked. 
---
I think it might be related to no longer auto-scrapping mods. Technically you *have* the materials, but they are not available for use until you manually break down that mod for parts. Just a guess, as I have not had the time to test that.
---
Also, if you see any lead pipe weapons, you get some concrete from them (for some reason)
---
I can tank my own explosive shotgun if I aim it at my feet. I learned from this guys mistake in Fallout 4. 
---
Dense chest, 3 fireproof, dodgy, adamantium skeleton. My own explosives do literally nothing to me. I can literally sprint at someone and chuck a mine at us and I take no damage while they go boom.
---
How would I do that? The game doesn't outwardly show damage numbers. I'd just be guessing based off a visual  estimate of how far the target's hp bar decreased with hits.
---
Like a Lvl50 3* Instigating Golf Club w/+25 Poison Resistance and 90% weight reduction.  Base damage on Golf Club w/full Gladiator perks is like 85.  Such a F U from RNG.  Picked that one up.last night.  Sold it to Vendor with lvl3 Bargaining for a whopping 2 Caps.
---
Honestly I think I have atleast one of each of the teddy bras in the game. You should be allowed to put the on a shelf or something in your camp so you don’t have to carry them around,  but don’t have to scrap them. I don’t want to scrap my little dudes, I love them so much.
---
Gauss rifle uses 2mm rods as ammo.
---
I think you're right on the amount of mods for FO4...also yeah the pipe rifle drum mag is a total joke.  Would folk then prefer if betheda removed some of the excess filler mods instead?
---
If you find a fix, please please please let me know!
---
Thanks pal I will try and add it if it is still worth adding when I get home. Currently embracing IKEA
---
I’ve got a flaming laser sword for ya. 
---
Same with .50 cal
---
That's why I'm dropping heavy weapons for a bit. A single queen fight? About 1.2k ammo
---
I don't think ten hours is that much. I've played 14 hours one day, me and my friends were having a lot of fun, it was Saturday, and the weather so bad, there was no point in going out.
---
To think he crashed every 19 minutes, and spent 14 hours going through the same cycle of reboot, login, play about 14 minutes and then crash is what seems like a very hard thing to believe. 
---
They did it to add scarcity, but all they did was create frustration.
---
1. PC
---
Game crashed when I unplugged my headphone.....
---
I'm on PC, and got these mutations earlier this week.
---
I THINK I died getting the Speed Freak, I know I died getting Marsupial but that one still works fine.
---
When I get home I'll post some screenshots of my pip-boy, I think I have Marsupial, Scaly Skin, Healing Factor and said glitched Speed Freak.
---
Some TSE weapons can also destroy all of your walls (even metal) in a matter of seconds. Maybe the warning message was even lagged? What others said about explosives could also be the reasoning. 
---
I feel your pain. I recently scrapped my collection of bears, but am holding out on my billiard ball set for the time being. 
---
the 30% cap is unfortunately true.  I found a lvl 15 furious mr handy arm on my sniper, and decided to play around with it.  It was remarkably underpowered on higher level ghouls at white springs and could take up to a minute to rip through.  The damage buffs up for a second or two, and then its done.  
---
I still dont have TSE anything...one day...
---
If a played is in one spot for a long time and not near or at a fast travel waypoint it is easy to assume that's their camp. Ive done that before to seek revenge on a guy who wrecked my camp for no reason.
---
I hope I remember that ;-)
---
Im pretty sure that if you own a workshop, you're in full PvP mode while you're at the workshops territory, even if its not currently contested.
---
How did you lose all your progress did you lose your screws springs and gears  and still salty after a week and still on this sub reddit?
---
Lvl 70 wondering what space station you're speaking of?
---
Oh my god what?!
---
The camp will be attacked wherever you put it. It's a game mechanic so monsters will spawn periodically near it

no scenery but it has its perks.
---
I hope it improves. But I don't expect it will any time soon.
---
I sold my silver and gold for 2 CAPS each last night.. only 4 charisma, and level 3 hard bargain here
---
I had to moff ball my heavy weapons/PA character until the rebalance.
---
Whitesprings!
---
I've had this happen before. The issue for me was I had the required materials but a low amount of them. Recipe needed 2 steel I had 2 steel and only 2 steel. Went and got some more from mama dolches factory and it let me crafting my item. 
---
It's no Deathclaw Sanctuary or Deathclaw Promontory that's for sure. Wish it had an actual boss Deathclaw. Maybe a Legendary Mythic Deathclaw that could call a pack of other Deathclaws to its aid. The Powerstation north of Watoga has better spawned Deathclaws. Disappointing and feels like a waste of such a good name.
---
The world is filled with NPCs because robots, supermutants and the mothman are considered npcs. The game doesn't have any *human* npcs.
---
Wow even skyrim had that? Yeah there's just no excuse for bethesda here.
---
Was at Charleston station at the time of death. Was not in the territory. I think it's any where if you have a workshop, I could be wrong. 
---
FML, so only the HR? when I read "literally everything" I got it to put on all my weapons..... and I only have one gun, isn't even a HR. Live and learn I reckon. 
---
The entire system is ill thought out and hastily put together. Good thing we are still in BETA...
---
This time. What I'm saying is that, if he keeps playing, people will shoot him and kill him eventually. Instead of making posts about it, he should learn to accept that like a grown person.
---
There is a prototype hazmat suit as a world spaen at said location.
---
yep got swarmed by a massive amount of those little robots you see outside V76. they were lvl 62 though.
---
thought this is odd!
---
Yeah,  I've downed her multiple times. Just trying to get the Ultracite Helmet plans on PC, which is the last piece I need. I'm currently using a two shot combat rifle with better VATS accuracy and lower VATS cost heavy crit build which actually does great damage (and she's so damn big, the spread on two shot in VATS doesn't present a problem). I use Tormenter to bring her down quicker. The problem is I was the only one doing any significant damage to her. 
---
I just figured the level 200+ and the several level 100-150+ plus (along with my level 122) would be able to drop her. Then they all vanished from the time I launched the nuke to the time it landed. 
---
apparently, it does not work on any of my one guns or 4 hammers. Thanks for the help!! 
---
I've played 160 hours and my only Mothman encounter ended with him disappearing after I'd killed him about 2/3. 
---
Am I just going the wrong places, or something?!
---
Yeah. Bethesda could learn a thing or two from the people who did Skyrim. 
---
I've read modplans drop off enemy's in the ash area but haven't found one. Wallace in Harper's ferry usually has excavator mods, got come calibrated servos and a targeting HUD from him. 
---
A Lincoln's Repeater skin for the Lever-action rifle to make it look pristine.
---
Now get the alien blaster 
---
That’s very strange, I’m gonna try what the others suggested and if it doesn’t work then I guess it’s back to grinding 
---
In the ATOM store you have to read the fine print.
---
I don't see a lvl 50 Scorchbeast as an endgame creature. I've been running away from them for 50 levels, and after 180 hours of playing it would be nice to be able to at least dent their damned hide. 
---
The Mire is my home. 
---
I had to scrap all my bears and fuzzies.  I'm holding on to my scorched head in a jar and my Mr Handy model though.
---
someone took the time to reskin the bears like 50 different ways, but never bothered to check if energy weapons worked.
---
what an odd development cycle. 
---
There's a Caddyshack easter egg on the golf course. There is a human groundskeeper's skeleton by a tractor and trailer. He is surrounded by cans of rat killer and a box of explosives.
---
Quick hint: the Charleston newspaper building typically has 4-5 typewriters (don’t miss the two on the main floor) and a couple fans. And Sugar Grove is lousy with fans and globes. 
---
thanks
---
Silver shroud outfit, NOW &gt;:(
---
They need to make it so we can just yell at scorchbeasts to make them land. Then when we beat them down with our melee weapons that vastly outperform easily obtainable weapons, give us the ability to gain their powers when we eat their corpse, leaving behind an empty shell. 
---
Neeeeeeed. 
---
That would be a great place, here’s to hoping I guess. 
---
And here I though I was unrealistic in asking for a stripper ghoul (because she isn’t a human NPC)
---
I want sharks w freaking laser beams attached to their heads 
---
Depends on what you call “fun,” I guess.  To get the screws I need, I end up scouring the same office buildings for desk fans and typewriters every time I need them, which wastes about an hour and a half of time that could better be spent wandering Appalachia.
---
Someone else suggested that even *one* screw in every gun you scrap would be a huge improvement, and I agree.  I’d be much more cavalier about mowing down hordes of scorched and supermutants if I knew I’d be able to repair my equipment afterward.
---
Plus, if you think about it, having the “one screw per gun” option wouldn’t be as lucrative as scavenging: you could carry 4 or 5 desk fans for the weight of a single combat rifle (iirc), so scavenging would still be a viable option.
---
Is it about 70ft long? 
---
yeah, I should have known better. Meh, good time to expand my collection of one gun to two guns. 
---
I haven't used any energy weapons, but all the heavy weapons I've found have been fun but rubbish. Missile launcher (20lb+2lbs/rd)? Use a black powder pistol (3lb+.1lb /rd) instead. Gatling gun or minigun? Fun, but better to use a rifle or pistol. I figured grenade launchers would be really good at crippling ghouls, but shotguns are better.
---
This game has turned from bad to an absolute joke
---
Thanks. It was probably a dumb question, but I wanted to make sure.
---
Doing events and taking workshops, especially early on. Also, just looking everywhere and in everything. I've only bought maybe 10% of the plans I've gotten. 
---
Since I'm playing with the same friends, we are all really good at giving each other those too. If we have it, we always give to each other. 
---
nope, they all playing gamebryo for TES 6 right now. 
---
That would be pretty nice. I always find a surplus from picking up junk, so I kinda have mixed thoughts on it. I think a lot of people could benefit from it though. :)
---
I've been wanted twice (oops) for lockpicking (the same) owned safe at one of the workshops.  What I do is store the most valuable junk (screws and springs mostly) then carry on wandering through flatwoods awaiting the 1-hit kill.  That done I thank the guy then get on with my day lol.  They are welcome to any of the other random stuff that I drop at death, I almost never retrieve it.
---
Youtube revenue justifies for him, in-game currency is just a bonus...
---
Best comment 
---
The laser sword would break after 1 swing anyway.
---
Ghouls in my opinion are the best aspect of the games because they were around before the bombs dropped and have seemingly infinite lifespans. They're like walking time capsules. 
---
Underworld was probably my favorite location in Fallout 3. Listening to people carry on about barbeques and how pretty they looked in their dresses when their skin wasn't falling off will always be interesting. 
---
Lol hilarious. Throwing your suggestions in the mail along with all the other people. Bethesda going to get all the mail and throw it away. 
---
Greatest explanation by FAR! Thanks!
---
No. 8 inches. Sorry. Lol. 
---
I got two deposits in my camp near Watoga. My camp IS my workshop
---
There should be no scarcity of junk in a land of waist. Only scarcity in water, food, and ammo.
---
Up north there's a crashed space station.
---
Absolutely....not 
---
Because, yes, artists are the same as gameplay programmers.  Yep.
---
I'm not sure where you get the idea that I didn't contact support. I made it very clear that I have in my first post. All you've managed to do is make assumptions about me and my situation. The fact is you are just some guy on the internet and being on Reddit does not make you special. This site is far from special though it does have it's uses. Especially as it relates to my profession. Of course you must know that after doing your "research" Mr Reddit investigator.  Their was nothing wrong with my example and your word soup does not change that. I was banned "indefinitely," not pending an investigation. This again a case of you not knowing what you are talking about. You really just aren't as smart as you think you are and I encourage you to stop embarrassing yourself. 
---
I mean this in the nicest way possible, I owe you nothing and your opinion on my guilt or innocence is worthless. The reason I am posting about it on this subreddit is because Bethesda clearly reads the posts here. The reason I am posting within ops thread is because it had some viability. You willingness to attribute ulterior motives to both of these things while knowing nothing about me is quite sad. Your good faith argument falls flat when considering these two things. What's worse is that in your post you attributed quotes to me that did not come from me. You've even tried to tie me in with people like op. How about you stop poisoning the well and take your own advice?
---
"Literally one thing"
---
Up voted for making my morning 
---
Really hoping as time goes on some dlcs introduce npc's. The games really missing character without it.
---
LOTS of crashes lately....I assume the dupers are in overdrive trying to redo their stock as TSE weapons will no longer be the OP God weapons they once were.
---
Yeah its is crazy how in all the other fallouts we have ghoul NPCs but not a single ghoul with a lack of sense in this game!
---
&gt;I don't understand why pacifist doesn't make me alive to still be killed by other players,  I shouldn't take slap damage if im in pacifist mode because I too live in it.
---
Well, Pacifist Mode seems to work the way it does in real life.  Just because you have pledged not to hurt others doesn't make you immune to harm yourself.  
---
Odd, I would’ve thought w/that many luck points you’d be swimming in legendary gear.
---
My main has 3 in luck and it’s got great gear. No TSE, but great compared to luck.
---
I have pix somewhere of it when it flooded really badly a few years ago.  Once the waters receded, it looked pretty much like a wasteland.  
---
I know right, it's so FUNNY how everyone seems to have these super low drop rate weapons. I happen to have a legit TSE Gatling plasma(it sucks because energy weapons suck) and I would be fine with a purge.
---
That depends on so much factors... your daily routine, the kind of scenery you like, the ressources you need, if you prefer being secluded or easily discovered...
---
Healing factor so I dont need PA anymore 
---
ikr, screws are the only components I could reliably obtain if I dismantled weapons irl.
---
I think they're trying to stop us from making a mountain of weapons, scrapping them and unlocking all the mods.
---
Unfortunately, this is what I would like to do. Some weapons are hard to find.
---
I had soup for dinner.
---
Thanks, Would never imagine to use fireproof to reduce a sonic attack.
---
If you repaired the reactor it tells you to head for the control room.  The next quest marker is not the control room, but the terminal that gives access to the control room.  When you access terminal it initiates the next step in the process(Destroy Mainframe Cores) once that is done there's one last step before you get to the control room.  You're only 2/3 of the way there and starting the hardest part(running in circles).
---
in the last two weeks, most of my games began with me, going to 2-3 spot where I can find screws (when no one had the same idea), only to gain 10 screws. it's just the rarest of the "common" ressources. 
---
Tesla is always a rifle regardless of the mods added
---
Single not sorry!
---
Most of my nuke runs don't have much in common with your story, but the few that do are some of favorite FO76 moments.  Makes me want to get on right now.
---
or like... an android tablet duck taped to your wrist. 
---
I have all these fake bombs from daily events and I wish so badly I could set them up to look like my camp is rigged with bombs.
---
We're taking over the wasteland, it would make sense as time goes on to add player hubs
---
Thanks for the fun read. 👍
---
I woulda thought there were display case plans somewhere 
---
I dropped 2 beacuse i never use the gun 😁
---
TIL. Thank you.  
---
Exactly how do 3-star legendaries work, because I more often than not get one-star drops from said 3-star legendaries?
---
True,  but I wish it was more like gta online. 
---
Well shit negro that’s all you had to say
---
We need a monkey costume and a group of people wearing it to follow these people around.
---
I always scrap stuff before putting it in my stash box.  I'm asking if the teddy bears get past that step without being scrapped.
---
Oh, well have you heard the f2p rumors?
---
It's not fun, it's tedious. It's extra tedious when some other player has already stripped the area.
---
It's a post-nuke thing. I've seen swarms of liberators there as well
---
Also, camp McClintock is chock full of battered clipboards, plus a few typewriters and fans. 
---
We've been in a lot of nuke zones last before. But last night was the first time we felt we were high enough to try and help with the Queen. It was crazy, and it was fun. We loved how many different creatures showed up. The level 1 radroach being our favorite. Because what the heck! Let's have a pesky level 1 radroach be there!
---
Level 150 here. I've never seen an explosive weapon drop. Plenty of TS but no explosive.

These weren't 3 star. Mine was just a one star.

I wish I could get a refund of the atom I used. I was saving up for a PA skin but, then THOUGHT I could skin my gun on the cheap, not so much. Man, I just don't understand how the Atom Shop can have zero good things and only like 50 items total. 
---
Well, the first thing I did after getting Wanted was a quick trip to the nearest stash ;)
---
Perfect response.
---
Allows you to build raider outpost items from nuke world by having the 1st outpost for a group, you won’t get all unlocked until you have more outposts
---
Nobody deserves a cold meal
---
1 screw per gun, 2 if you have the 'scrapper' perk. That would make a big difference.
---
It reminds me of the time in Fallout 4 when I needed a small quantity of glass to finish my town.
---
I had bottles of beer and cola in storage.
---
So I drank them.
---
Turns out you keep the bottle cap, but eat the bottle.
---
I have an explosive Cryolator...not sure how that works lol. Haven't really used it yet to see if its worth keeping though. 
---
Personally, I'm noticing a lot more stability after that wave of bans went out. https://youtu.be/BHUFiG1YBwc
---
Yes! Cannibal becomes so much better thanks to carnivore. I love the combination.
---
The way I see it, we need a timer to see how much time is left on the event. After that, fast traveling to the event should deduct the travel cost from your caps, so that if you finish said event, the travel cost is refunded. That way events can be uses as free fast-travel, and be very attractive, simultaneously increasing event participation.
---
Only if it somehow involves a canvas bag.
---
Shut
---
If this works when I get home I am declaring you a Prophet of Atom.
---
Just to be sure, I tested my revolver rifle last night. It gets both perk types as well.
---
They should at least make the teddies Misc items. I picked up a bumblebee bear for a friend and accidentally scrapped it.
---
Felt something like an emotional stab wound.
---
If they are in your inventory then they get scrapped. 
---
Varies from person to person. For myself it has gotten worse as I get several ctd every hour now.
---
The game can be difficult. Or it can create difficulties. The difference is that the first is a challenge, and the second is just annoying.
---
* When you are dealing with a strong opponent who hides from your shots, shoots back and can fight back, this is a challenge.
---
* When you break a weapon during a battle or run out of ammunition, it is annoying.  
---
* When you barely manage to kill the boss to get the recipe for cool weapons, this is a challenge.
---
* When the legendary wooden armor falls from the dummy boss for the tenth time, it is annoying.  
---
* When you go to a dangerous cave to get materials for new armor, this is a challenge.
---
* When you need to go to the familiar farm point every hour and farm there food, water and chems for the thousandth time, it is annoying.  
---
* When you are offered a ton of gold and you choose to die with it or throw it here, this is a test of will and a moral lesson.
---
* When you can't take an extra grenade or medicine with you, this is a bad game design.  
---
The main reason for hating this game is that it is not difficult. It's frustrating. This is a game from which the developers pulled everything that could be fun and replaced with a buggy routine. That's all.  
---
Im an idiot, i meant the Emmet Mountain Disposal site. Its a bit further east from the abive mentioned Blackwater Mine. Although if my memory serves me correctly, there's also one at blackwater.
---
Exact location:

It sounds like the paranoid feeling you feel is how you most likely would feel if put in a post apocalyptic setting fighting over resources in real life. That’s what I’m talking about. Making friends is not the realistic part. The realistic part is the human nature element that is currently missing, because another human can do nothing to you beyond emote. 
---
I know what you mean, I use mini nuke launchers alot and it takes 10 screwed per MN batch. I spend more time hopping servers trying to find one that has not already had the locations looted.
---
Bump.
---
I’ve got a couple of toons and I’d like a reminder of where they’re at relative to quest line, location and gear.
---
I would vote for the second floor of Top of the World.. Kindof a useless and under-utilized area right now. 
---
Positives: 
---
\#1, you have to load into the area, which can make for some good instanced stuff
---
\#2, it comes pre-loaded with many "shops", a stage, and other cool stuff
---
\#3, It's big enough for 100+ people
---
\#4, it's fully indoors, and safe from enemy attacks/scorchbeasts
---
You need a butt-ton of screws once - maybe twice -  to craft the excavator armor. You're given the ultracite armor, and you can find T-60. I assume you might need more screws for the x-01. I have the plans, no rush to create it. But it did suck circling the drain for clipboards, fans, and typewriters
---
Actually because it's a debuff on the enemy that 2% ends up increasing your damage by a lot more than 2% weapon damage. Bloody mess is still king, but this is huge especially vs the queen. Also fyi more points also increase the duration of the debuff; tenderizer 3 isnt required but its not a waste either 
---
Plasma and laser guns. Always been my favorite. Pity I can't use them because they're weak as pigs and break after *maybe* 2 reloads.
---
I see more deathclaws in savage divide mountains then anywhere else
---
I cast my vote for a flying liberty prime Mecha with a flaming lasersword, crewed by frickin sharks with frickin laserbeams attached to their frickin heads. 
---
No no, we need that.
---
Ah. I have much to learn.
---
2 solutions : 1/ explore, spend 2 hours to gain 5 screws, but use them to repair your gears.  
---
2/ farm 3 buildings in 20min, gain 5 screws (you are not the first in those buildings), repeat. That's boring, but that's the best way to gain some ressources.
---
I talk! I'm more than happy to talk! 
---
If you’re on pc, there is a mod that shows you which plans you already know.  That could prevent you from buying the same one twice. 
---
Exact location as a world spawn:
---
Dam you to hell, now all I can think about is what a teddy bra would look like!!!
---
for the last few days, I can't even get anything to show up in the atomic shop, or anything purchased to show up in game.  like, the squares are there, and I can still spend atoms...but the skin just doesn't show up.  I bought the croquet mallet skin for my new melee build.  I couldn't see what it would look like before hand in the atom shop, and in game its completely invisible.  Come to think of it, I saw a guy at the presidential shops that was just a floating head and hands, and I bet he was skinned in one of the atom shop skins. 
---
I usually give it a burial at sea. Or river, I guess.
---
oof. Thanks. I'm going to walk back to my camp now, see you in a day!
---
Aaaw so that's why you're acting all cool and stuff, you are still heartbroken after someone destroyed **your** cute little shed in ARK? How sad, and now you're acting out against others feeling insecure about yourself :/ well, I hope you do feel better one day
---
I used the printer to print out the decrypted code. It's under whatever silo/code word on the wall
---
I didnt even know bladed commie whacker was a thing. 
---
Follow up. I had 7 turrets at my camp. The last 3 were consuming around 40% of my budget. 
---
I will upvote you every day for every reminder. I have an AAE LMG just waiting to be used in my stash. 
---
But with the high cost of crafting .308 ammo and the still low damage with everything specc'ed for heavy guns, it's just not worth using. It doesn't make it better that the durability of anything with high fire rate, is really low, but that's a story for another day.
---
WOW. Haven't tried the Fatman yet, but considering what you say, I am not sure I want to...
---
I played last night for 1 hour on Xbox:
---
* Two eternal load screens
---
* One server disconnect
---
Why would they throw away perfectly good toilet paper?
---
Yes, I am having a hard time taking „xXxPussySlayerGodxXx“ seriously just because he made that Bethesda account years ago 
---
Thats how I felt too. Until i started crafting power armor.
---
It's called Lever Gun (Plan: Lever Gun)
---
I can't wait for an easier way for players to start selling stuff! We've probably lost some amazing weapons and armor that work well for some builds but not all due to inventory constraints.
---
This is where I am lol. Excavator armor lol
---
I have a TS flamer I keep it on my team medic character and only use for healing because like you mentioned to expensive to make ammo and it eats it to fast and breaks to quick, but holy hell does it do a good job of healing, eat your heart out Mercy.
---
I'm in the Forest.  I get Liberators, Protectrons, Ghouls, Scorched, Mole Rats, occasional Mongrel.
---
I'm near the river that the first Overseer's camp is at.  So it gets traversed often.  But everything is level 1-5 garbage.  Never seen a Super Mutant spawn near my camp.  Even if I'm the one that triggers the spawn (higher level).
---
O shit waddap
---
Thanks for doing this
---
Just kinda poke it with a stick until it falls in.  "eww...  eww.... ewwwwwwww...."
---
I did it too. But I kept a couple that I rarely see. 
---
No joke! If you have a TS one forget you might get 8 shots out of it.
---
This. Use other camps against them. I had an epic shootout  where me and the other two guys were all wanted, everytime they came to shoot me, I was in this random guys base and they would destroy a little more and get a bounty each time. By the end, his entire base was a frame and it belonged to none of us.
---
In my experience Dense is better. Along with Fireproof perk and Dense mod sentinel makes you completely immune to TSE light weapons (pistols, rifles). 
---
I wouldn't say 'It Sucks!' but I do feel it's still early days.
---
I'm thinking/hoping that as time goes by, more 'themed' items will appear, perhaps based on 'real world' events/holidays.
---
I'm hoping for a Hockey Jersey, but may have to wait until it's Stanley Cup time!  Don't be surpred if you see an Easter Bunny outfit in a few months!
---
Yup, I have my camp in this area too.  The most I see is some Radstag.  I get plenty of purified water and I'm close to all the end game fast travel points.
---
I thought so too until I saw its mouth
---
What bothers me is I'm pretty sure there is a display case I'm not at my PlayStation so can't be 💯 but it's just a visual you can't use it
---
We need a Fusion Core Condenser, to make our many less than 100 FCs into only a few 100 FCs
---
I just like killing people, whether they're at 10 or 10000 caps
---
There are a lot more springs and pins in a firearm than screws, typically, but still plenty of all to be harvestable.
---
SHINY AND CHROME! RIDE ETERNAL!
---
There are plans labelled 'Display Shelf' and similar, but you can't actually display anything on them...
---
Just let me hoard my knomes. For the love of Atom
---
..... all that plastic though.... precious....
---
I dont even see the point of all the separate bears if we cant even display them.
---
Agreed, it’s bull crap that we can’t 
---
What is the difference between clean and the dirty versions, is it just look?
---
The game still got problems with quest returning, missing quest related things (disappearing guide arrow textures in run around the town quest for example) and still got terrible performance, but dcs ale quite limited (like up to 1 for 5hrs) and overall the game itself is even enjoyable. I can't wait next patches tho
---
You’re welcome.
---
Seriously? On the 2nd or 3rd? Mate... that would be great. I think I've unlocked a bayonet, a short scope and a Hello Kitty sticker on the stock :O
---
I do kinda know what you mean - but padding out the game longevity with RNG always feels artificial and having a barrier to progression simply for the sake of it. And I know *it is in fact a barrier to progression simply for the sake of it* because that's what online games actually require from time to time, but it's never a nice feeling for the players.
---
I'm always the same: "I'll just get the gear and things that I need \_then\_ I'll play the game." Then I find that getting the gear \_was\_ playing the game and nothing is left. I feel a bit cheated :)
---
Had to log off and go to work this morning, and was running a bit behind. So as I'm doing my last pre-log off stuff I hear Graham mumbling past my camp by Pleasant Valley Station. Needless to say. . . I was late to work. Also, he did have some bulk aluminum I was sorely needing for my calibrated shocks, but sadly nothing else of note.
---
but you get the nuke mats back because each reactor has a Nuclear material deposit.
---
I finally scrapped my brahmin feeder.
---
I just got tired of asshats shooting my brahmin and having to repair it. Sure the repair cost is almost nothing but the fact they can shoot it and it doesn't flag them as PVP/Wanted/Attacking my Camp annoys me. At least it freed up a nice chunk of budget.
---
I mean, is there a way to figure out what you receive in place of the \`\`\` ? Just have to memorize your entire inventory before the event, and do maths?
---
Fake bombs?   You mean mini nukes?
---
Those are real.  They are used by the Fat Man.
---
I'm going to need to have you work Sunday, m'kay?  That would be great 
---
PA is tank Armor, Good Legendaries are Glass Canon Armor
---
Helps a lot when sneaking
---
Ok great thanks. I was just wondering because if you add automatic it also affects your perks
---
I would say look in the forest or Savage Divide.
---
However, remember that there are a lot of criteria for what makes a CAMP location good or even great.  Land features and mob spawns are two, but also how popular of a spot is it?  How much fast travel value does it bring, and does it take advantage of Vault 76's free fast travel?  Does it contain enough flat ground so as to not have floating crops?  Etc.
---
If you're only looking for water, I would recommend just looking at the map.  Especially in the forest, most of the buildable water is shown on the map.  As for spawns, the best thing I've found is to pick a CAMP spot and hang out in it for a few minutes.  Sometimes an area will look peaceful enough, but after walking around for 5 or so minutes, things will start spawning.
---
Ah, so that's why I have an invisible ramp
---
Wow, that's quite a number and I can't even download 2.9 gigabytes in 25 minutes. :-(
---
20 caps + some flowers 
---
Let's not be pedantic. We both know that when people are referring to NPC's, they're talking about the non hostile kind. 
---
Beckwith farm.
---
Noticed the same thing post patch. So, I just play dead for 60 seconds or so until the assets/loading catches up. No problems since then.
---
Thanks! I'm a bit of a purist and prefer to not go outside of the game to find a weapon. I almost feel like I'm cheating just coming here for advice. I feel the game \*should\* provide everything I need, yet here I am.
---
You're funny. There's no building budget in ark and you actually have to grind for your building materials. Someone fucks your fallout base it's a 2second repair. Nothing to complain about. Super soft.
---
Yeah, the only shotguns are the ones that shoot shells. Started as a shotgun character so I'm positive on this one 
---
Yes indeed. I have to remember not to use beyond a certain threshold or the balls get scrapped for ammo or binding bulk materials. 
---
Okay thank you for your response. 
---
Right I agree it would only cause disconnects. Personally I would google "Nivida control panel setting for fallout 76". Also this sounds a lot like your graphics drivers may need to be updated, check for windows updates as well. Ive had these exact problems before with other games. 
---
Okay thank you. 
---
If its 3* probably 3k - 5k caps depending in the last stat. If 2* then its probably 2k- 3k caps 
---
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on...
---
I have seen them go for for 1,5K - 2K. caps
---
I've built walls around benches, particularly in the munitions factory since it can be hotly contested at times.  I held the thing for hours without anyone trying to take it.  And last night I saw a workshop build at Poseidon that was off the chain. The person who'd claimed it had pretty much encircled everything from the vertibot pad, the power substation, and the fusion processor with concrete walls so high you would have needed a jetpack to get inside them. There was one door with a level three lock and turrets on the outside of the walls to blast away anyone trying to get in. Seriously, this player had turned the workshop into a friggin' fortress.
---
Any stuffed bears I find, I sell to vendor I try not to let the stash get too big, since I got plenty of cloth and trying to transition to ballistic armor.
---
Personally, I like the mountains that run vertically up the map and boarder the Savage Divide.  There are a lot of interesting features to be found there, and some great views.  Check the mid-to-southern stretch to take advantage of fast travel synergies with V76.
---
VERY ANNOYING!! Please fix, Bethesda. Thanks!
---
Honestly, it sucks that I'm more terrified of Mirelurk Queens than alpha deathclaws. In previous fallouts I'd about shit myself when I saw a deathclaw. It wouldn't hurt me if deathclaws were a bit like giants in the elder scrolls series and need to have a partner help you out with one while you dont have all the good gear/weapons
---
I use unyielding armor on my stealth build and stay at about 1/3 health. I get about 35-40 Agility and I'm almost never spotted. They run right by me, Even bumping into me sometimes and always go after my buddy whos build isn't so stealthy.  I also have like 35 points in perception with Armor so I'm at 95% in VATS all the time. Combine all that with a combat sniper rifle and you are one deadly M'Fer.
---
He's not wrong. The way damage increase due to armor penetration is calculated is basically [1/(1-AP)]^0.366. At 50% its just 2^0.366 which is 28.9%.
---
No I haven't....do explain and please cite youtubers with no credible evidence.
---
If you need screws sugar grove is great there are phones desk fans and portable fuel canisters be careful though lots of high level robots there
---
LOL, at least you are honest.
---
I dunno, I'm only partially optimized, and it feels like I do so little damage to everything. I blow through most of my ammo through any relatively significant location, and it's prohibitively expensive(and/or time-consuming) to craft. I can usually manage, it's just so resource intensive to be exhausting after a while. At least I'm getting up there in levels so I can start taking QOL perks to swap in to make some things better...
---
Platform will make a big difference as well. Console seems to be markedly cheaper. 
---
Hmm no serendipity for PA RIP....
---
Definitely going to do this!
---
that would be preety cool idea 
---
also poor teddy bears
---
i want a rubber ducky in this game
---
Mine is up by the water park (top left of map). You can venture down and fight anglers/ ghouls or just collect wood from the fallen trees. It stays quiet!
---
This is fine.
---
The clean one smells like a new car.
---
I find it grimly ironic that you can lock up your game with your pip boy, yet if you use your pip boy to load a video game cartridge that game will play flawlessly.  Is this meta?  It feels meta
---
my dirty one smells like radiation and steaks
---
So basically Voltron.
---
Think that's bad... try Bolton Green plate settings... you can fail the quest and still have a few in your inventory... you can not do anything with them but just drop them. However I forgot I had them and didn't think about how much they weighed once... I had like 3 dozen of them and was wondering where all my weight was coming from.
---
Once the timer runs out of the quest any plates you still have in your inventory become dead weight that most times people don't think about and forget.
---
This is what the scrapper perk used to do. Nw you get an extra wood. It also would only give you high level stuff from upgraded pieces not just a run of the mill leather arm, it’d have to had nice mods on it to get them
---
Jangles the Moon Monkey &amp; Spacemen Squad 
---
If I can craft bookshelves and such… I should be able to put things on them, like teddies. 
---
In the INI file, There is a line that says difficulty and its at 2. I'm just not sure if changing it does actually change anything.
---
I missed an opportunity here to show it off.
---
Unfortunately, that radio station is dedicated to active PVP sort of like how the moon is dedicated to crop farming.
---
I dont mind this as much as "Spend Caps for Workshop", "Build Fusion Reactor and bunches of other stuff using own mats", then disconnect.
---
Read the details of the challenge. It's not just "kill robots" its "kill this many of these types of robtots" same goes for the flower picking, you need a specific amount of specific flowers 
---
It could just be that they are tired of weapons that weigh a ton, which break after a few shots, and do very little damage in comparison to past games.
---
Is that demolition hammer a sledge hammer or a super sledge? And what level is it?
---
Maybe 1 screw per gun, throw in a spring with Scrapper activated.  Most of my guns don’t have many screws (mostly in the adjustable sights, sight mounts, and to hold the furniture), but every single one of them has at least one spring.
---
The difference, of course, comes in the universality of those screws and springs: any hardware store with a decent selection of small machine screws would carry any screw I’d need to replace, so I could pull screws from most of my guns that are similar enough—but I don’t think I’d be able to repurpose any spring from one gun to another without some modification.
---
How many steps backwards can it take without actually going forwards :(
---
I have a basic PC (i5 2500K, GeForce GTX 960)  and the game runs nicely with some slowdowns in some areas (Charleston, Morgantown...) ; not many CTD , some server disconnect.
---
As far as I remember, I did not have any issues with quests or holotapes.
---
I'm playing about 1 to 3 hours per day since release.
---
Or just incompetence!
---
Dude lmfao your killing me 😂🤣😂
---
It breaks after he shoots it twice.
---
I'm in NA East and my username is trash-queen
---
Yw 🗿
---
Try three times. 😎
---
Why do people in government vote to keep themselves paid, with great benefits, and immunity from crimes in some cases?  Your answer lies there.
---
I agree. I like collecting trinkets in Bethesda games. I realize why they can’t do the usual and let dropped items be individual items but it would be nice to have some way to display some stuff you found. 
---
I don't really know. I've gotten 1-3 star legendary items. I don't always pay attention to that. I figure, I'll either get something good, or something I sell. Or something I give away.
---
Honestly i just play the game to have fun with my friends. 
---
Going for specific things always seems like a way to make the game less fun, when it doesn't pay off. 
---
I do have my perfectly preserved pie. What else more could a wasterlander really need? Oh Boiled water. Lots and lots of boiled water. 
---
"Their fricken heads" Honestly, Am I asking to much reeaally.
---
Ok made my purchase yesterday! :)
---
Well, sweeeeet.
---
I love collecting teddy bears too, but I had to scrap many of them because my STASH was nearly full :( At least I can fondly look back at my [teddy bear pile](https://i.imgur.com/tydHEyo.jpg) from fo3.
---
Did you need to download an update too? Average traffic I've seen playing 76 is sub 100kb/s... you'd need upwards of 8 hours of gameplay to hit 2.9GB.
---
There must be 76 Easter Eggs, surely. ;)
---
I just started using mods,  the three I use are known plans (so I no longer have to guess what plans I own), better inventory (to better identity where all my character weight is going) and perkcard load out (so that I could shuffle my deck from crafting to fighting)
---
Tbh I think all these things should already be implemented  in the game,  but I'm not using anything to alter the appearance of the game.
---
If you don’t mind moving your camp there’s a concrete extractor right next to new gad 
---
The same things at startup happen to me on XBox...  
---
Yeah like how they expect the game to function for a few hours without crashing.  Or release a patch for bobblehead stacking which has made PvP unfair and costly.  Sick of having my armor blown off in one shot.
---
Totally unrealistic.
---
...I would use it for the giggles.
---
Near as anyone can tell, the Atom Shop items are imbedded in the game and being released on a set schedule by a bunch of interns in a bunker.  They will stick to their schedule no matter what.  It's like waiters on the Titanic still refilling empty drinks left on tables that are tilted 30 degrees.
---
Just keep moving and don't mind us. We are just a harmless box. We are not recording everything you do.
---
Do you really need that many blackberries?
---
Buttressed can be learned by scrapping but it takes a while.  I can do most of the marine mods on PS4 if you need a hand.  Just send a pm.  I have not learned Dense yet though.  Got most of the others I think.
---
Okay thank you.  The holotape issue was if you were using the alternative view for the pip boy where you could see some of the game still while using the pip boy the tapes wouldn't play. 
---
TSE handmade or my TSE Suppressed Combat Rifle
---
I was thinking more Planet of the Apes (the Charlton Heston one AKA the Good One). But sure we can go with Jangles too.
---
Pretty much the same a last month, patch didn't really do anything noticeable.
---
Some people say its great but then others are still crashing out every 20- 30 mins. The last patch was supposed to fix 150 different bugs apparently but if anything all it did was add more Bethesda flavoured shenanigans.
---
Hard to tell if it was working as intended because as like petulant teenagers that have been caught lying about something Bethesda refuse to be drawn on conversation about it and seem to be pretending that everything "just works".
---
Stay away another month or two if the crashes and cheating bothered you, if not go get dem nukes!
---
Well Cavaliers would synergize with perk cards that also increase your DR when sprinting, sentinel has no cards to buff your dr when not moving
---
huh.   I did not know this.  Thank you.
---
I will remove that mod.
---
Last night both my friends had to wait to join my world because it was full. Not the first time in the last few weeks. 
---
Do this https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/eternalscourge/video/67801315
---
Nice! I'm still curious as to if they'll expand the Sickleman story in the game. I was listening to a fallout podcast where some local wv guys had a good theory on the reference and kind of connected it to the Grafton monster. 
---
Here's the [timestamp for the story](https://youtu.be/saKuZLpWd10?t=2172)
---
Stop with the negative and think if a cool new super weapon for the game! 
---
Kind of makes you wonder if they are really doing proper QA before releasing updates.  I discovered this bug within 5 minutes of the new patch dropping.  How does this not get caught?
---
Laughs in 600 Screws
---
No one has posted anything. These are all in your head. 
---
Jesus Christ buying this game was fucking dumb idea. 60$ down the drain. Played for 2 weeks.
---
I didn't even know fallout uses physx
---
I knew it was going to be bad when my buddy told me about it followed by it is in the forest. 
---
I destroyed wanted players camp with a TSE pump with explosive perks and wrecking ball very easily. Not going to lie, it was VERY fun lol
---
I can't say I ever experienced any cheaters in fact during my play it was rare to actually come across another player.  Thank you though. 
---
This very same bug happened to me last night.  Logged in, tried to use my lvl 50 All rise and it was gone.  It was my go to melee weapon.  
---
Yeah i have one in my camp and you can’t put anything in it :(
---
... I see you are a man of culture as well ...
---
I was going to say, Radshield as well. I've been in blast zones with just rad-x and glowing blood packs. But when I got radshields, man o man. 
---
All the Upvotes for you.
---
Just ridiculous what people are asking for.
---
I wouldn’t say I’m riled up... I’m more laughing at people who give any credibility to these YouTube experts.  My mental health is fine ;)
---
I didn't know but now i do!
---
I want what this guy wants!
---
I fast traveled to watoga train station (outside of blast zone) and ran back. And a dude on our team left the server and came back hoping that would jump start it so to speak. Wheel kept spinning. 
---
Wasn’t just my team either. Half the other folks were throwing up the confused emote. 
---
Musta skipped the part where I typed we were there for ten minutes. We actually started to wonder how long until the nuke zone wears off. I couldn’t even drop some stimpacks for my teammate. 
---
10 e cells and and half a ton of lead was used on my behalf (completely unknown how much ammo others used but I’m sure it’s the same as me but probably more).
---
When we showed up the bodies around the fissure had loot, deathclaws and raiders etc. bout halfway through we just started getting infinite wheels. Even saw my first fog crawler. 
---
So bummed. I (and I’m sure a good sized group of fellow dwellers) have been through the ups and downs of this game, the disconnects and loot changing in front of our eyes. The nerfs, the buffs, the duper’s and griefers. We all stayed and played. Defended the game (as much as we could) but that was truly bad. I feel robbed. 
---
I’m still not going to bash the game. Regardless of my end game boss experience. I had a great time playing. Adventures and hilarity by the truck loads. Met some cool folks too. That was just a kick in the gut. 
---
No doubt I’ll don my big nose mask once more in the future after a dlc release but now? 
---
Nope. I’m taking a break. I’ll go be a cowboy or space explorer for awhile. M
---
Weird thing is I’m not even mad. I figure I’d be pissed. I’m just super bummed. All those robots and turrets down in alpha, (got some decent loot there) the wasted nuke keycard cause I fat fingered a number. 30+ pounds of ammo. 
---
*sigh* 
---
Just super bummed. 
---
Makes sense, but if you need 11 screws to make it, then the screws must be in there somewhere. I can't imagine the spring from a pen would be very useful in a firearm.
---
This happens to me all the time I would prefer that they just disconnect us rather than to sit there and still be hit from the environment.
---
Both are very common.  The first is usually loading and/or rendering.  Other versions of that include appearing naked and stretched out (PA visual glitch).  The second is annoying, and usually comes after switching leaders or if the leader disconnects and rejoins the team. If anyone disconnects on our team, we disband and reform.
---
I'm level 88 and I've only seen a mothman 3 times, and only managed to kill one once. All in The Mire.
---
Up on the Seneca rocks are a jangles the moon monkey and a panda bear next to the words "astropanda" my base is set up there.
---
I love Graham because he's such a rarity. If the world was littered with NPCs, he wouldn't be so special anymore.  He'd become just another face in the crowd.
---
I honestly don't understand why so many people want more NPCs in the game.  For me, the lack of them adds to the immersive experience FO76 offers. 
---
Moth?
---
Getting screws, springs from weapons makes more sense then killing Yao Guai for them.  What’s more believable, breaking down weapons to get weapon parts like screws and springs?  Or, finding springs and screws in the undigested remains from the last meal of a 700 pound mutated bear?
---
Yep invis happens every fast travel or zone for me and my buddy, so does a body being stretched out and in underwear like it's supposed to be as long as pa.. 
---
Even bgs adds more bugs then it fixes. I barely even play lately. Its just not worth it.
---
The amount of posters not adding their gaming platform to their complaint posts have been HORRIBLE.
---
The game is fun if you make it fun, I'm having a (nuclear)blast.
---
Sorry you arent enjoying yourself. If you're on Xbox come play with me and we can explore. 
---
Nice, ready whenever
---
these textures looks like taken from DUke Nukem3d..
---
That looks really great! I'm sure it was difficult juggling the layout!
---
Do you mind if I ask how often the camp is attacked? I'd love a location like this with Junk, water and access to a town, but I still only have fairly basic plans and the pea-shooter turrets :/
---
My base is indestructible inside. Wondering how many other locations something like this might be possible? https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/eternalscourge/video/67801315
---
"it just works"
---
I know the physics engine used by fo4 is Havok, but I don’t know anything about Nvidia’s PhysX being involved. Maybe it could be, but dedicating a whole separate card to it sounds excessive unless you’re struggling performance-wise.
---
And wanting to sacrifice 50 luminous bugs and toads in his name before he shows up :D
---
Teddy Bears? Thank Yog. I'd thought you'd shot a Fox.
---
If you've got duplicates stored that's not cache, you'd have to manually delete them 
---
We won't because of server stability. There's a reason things we drop are paper bags and don't have physics enabled.
---
lol sorry normal sledge hammer lvl 50 
---
I already figured out FO76 netcode to be abysmal, but that is an order of magnitude beyond.
---
At this point they'd be better off streaming the game to you.
---
I think there are only a few items don't get scrapped; e.g., Hallucigen Gas Canisters, baseballs, beer bottles and mole rat teeth.  Teddy Bears were apparently made from rich corinthian leather
---
You do on PA bud.
---
I don't know about you, but I keep my screwdriver clenched tightly between my buttocks!
---
Or build somewhere else. 3.
---
Yeah it sucks!  The headgear where you can see hair is just 1000x better.
---
Another problem with the old ass engine and it's clipping issues.
---
Why can't we have content and features?
---
I know Bethesda is incapable of doing both (or one well) but its a sorry state when your expectations are that low that you believe its a choice between them for a AAA tite that is like the 5-6 game in a franchise using the same engine as the previous 3 (hell it's pretty much a copypasta of the last one)
---
130 dev's worked on this buggy mess for years ...
---
Thanks, this was super helpful!
---
You just want him to carry the heavy stuff.
---
Just curious what platform are you on? 
---
Haha I imgane!   
---
I met a couple of them and fought them off.   
---
But they were not the "wise ones" They were either the stalking or vengeful kind.
---
Honestly I would be OK with a happy medium. Have it show your Account name as it currently does (so you can send friend requests, mute, block, etc.) and Below that show a character name.
---
If you want to get fancy have a settings toggle so you can toggle which you see.
---
I logged out in the Whitespring bunker.  Next day I log back in and I'm outside service exit door just taking incredible amounts of health damage.  Can't move.  Wait, now I can move, stimpack!  Wait, now my healthbar has changed color and that's not regular damage, that's radiation damage!  But it's a beautiful day out, what the heck?  Ok, I'll just run straight ahead into the bunker so I can load inside.  Loading... wait, I'm back outside again!  And now there's a nuke zone here!   About to die, run back inside again!  Loading... wait, now I'm back outside yet again!  And now I'm dead!  And now I can only respawn right where I was!  And I have 1 hp!  And I'm dead again!  And now my PS4 has had its power cord yanked out somehow!
---
Yes!
---
Love Brook and Teddy!!!!! So lucky to have now found a forever home! Am a big firm believer when somebody asks me "Who has the best dog?" I say all of them! When we go to the play dates i forget to talk to people, as am with the dogs 90% of the time! Luckily my wife is more social! lol

---
the cheating was referring to dupers and people stacking bobble head's more than anything else :)
---
This is where I found mine.
---
Ah. I was unaware and only going off what I had been told by others. I hadn't ever tested it because I didn't start getting serum recipes (and therefore the ability to easily refresh mutations) until after I had 6 or 7 and I didn't want to deal.  
---
Thank you for the correction!
---
I just noticed the same thing on my game, hence why I am here. Did a search in here to look around.
---
I’m level 59 and I still haven’t seen him once
---
Also it should all weight 2 lbs
---
I ran into him like 3 times before I was lvl 30. Now that I have caps I cant find the dude
---
Thats nice but Im on PC
---
I had the same crisis of faith with Nuka Cola. I am a Nuka Cola fanatic and I love to collect all the different types. Especially Quantums. At first it was fine, I had plenty of space. But like every wastlander I soon realized that there was a limit to what I could carry. 
---
So first I just drank the regular Nuka Colas. I made sure to wear Cola Nut perk so that I could really enjoy the flavor. I was a Nuka Cola connoisseur mind you. But not too long later I was once again at an impasse. Over 40 Quantums in stash, almost the same Cherry, and my one beloved Nuka Grape. What do I do?
---
I cried a sad tear and started downing the Cherry as well. Each drink a magnificent blend of happiness and sorrow. I drank them until I had but 5 Cherry left. But I dare not ever touch my Quantums. Never.
---
But I too know that soon hat day will come. And I weep. 
---
That's where I got mine, there are 3-4 suit spawns in the building.  Also a great place to farm mutations, PA, and magazines.
---
Not true at all, heavy weapons are broken into "explosives" and "ballistic"; it's not just "heavy weapons"
---
For example the fatman and missle launcher DO NOT get heavy weapon damage buffs but they do benefit from Bear Arms. They fucked up the auto GL in the same patch they made fusion core generation 0.8/hr at workshops. They just fixed that to 8/hr so fingers crossed they fix their other mistakes 
---
I want a cat called captain snuggles he will require kitty Power Armor and tse claws
---
Yep.  Just started and looks like a box :)   This is very familiar to many new people.
---
As you progress through game, many more options open up for you.
---
Mmmm milk steak 
---
Have you found Murgle the cat yet, or the artist that loves her?
---
I met a couple of those. They are hard to deliver a finishing punch on. This one though... He comes freely if you sacrifice lumious  bugs and toads at the Landview Lighthouse just east of Vault 76 -&gt;  
---
[**https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/7/71/Landview\_Lighthouse\_map.png**](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/7/71/Landview_Lighthouse_map.png)
---
For me it was spending ages on a camp build, realising I'd got the positioning a little wrong, then finding I was unable to move the stairs as doing so would make part of the structure 'inaccessible.' I can only presume they were referring to the sky, as that's the only thing the stairs led to now. I had to move the entire camp and start over. 
---
When I first heard about Fallout 76 and its focus on base building, I thought 'awesome. Now they're really going to spend some time ironing out the inflexibility of Fallout 4's settlement mechanic.' Not only did they not do that, but they somehow made it *worse.* 
---
Long shot was one I wasn't if it was worth taking for an automatic or if it even worked. I always forget the variable damage based on distance, I just need to learn range of engagement. My pirate character has certainly made that obvious! Haha.
---
Go ahead and pop some numbers into the FO4 damage coefficient formula. Reduce the divisor by 50% and you'll notice the final damage increases 28.9% every time (unless the damage coefficient was already 0.99).
---
Yea its a Brahmin steak made by Ghouldon Ramsay 
---
Anti-armor seems to only be good for the queen so far. 
---
Even worse, I thought they shot a cat. I care across a group of three cats somewhere in Appalachia in the northern part of the savage divide. I feel like they glared at me and ran off because I interrupted their secret meeting. 
---
50 Shades of Fray
---
Launched a Nuke last weekend, 10 people showed up(including me and a friend), only 3 people total were attacking the SBQ(that included me and my friend). The other 7 people were literally standing around potshotting the other mobs and running around... We ACTUALLY didn't kill the SBQ in the time limit, I was kind of pissed lol...
---
No... This is due to having many weapons/armor not drop reliable off of monsters. I rarely get Lever Actions, Laser Pistols, or Plain armor pieces. The only work around which is absurd is to craft the required item and hope I get a mod from breaking it down when it HAS NO MODS. This is only if you have the BASE PLAN already which is a problem in itself.
---
I do not use power armor and at 150 I need particular mods that I can't seem to find after weeks of vendor hoping. Now I'm absolutely stuck with using the previous mentioned method which is pretty stupid.  Plus to add salt to the wound after a set amount of break downs you no longer unlock any mods. So if your fishing for something particular and break X amount down your not guaranteed to get that mod. 
---
A divine experience. All hail the wise one(s)
---
ANGERY 
---
Not everyone has the repair materials.  Especially if you have rare plants from other areas.  So that means going around, bit by bit, and fixing it.  
---
Lower level people, most prone to a destroyed base, don't always have the more rare things available.
---
They removed the fast travel mats from CAMPS due to exploitation.     People could use the mats to get to places not normally accessible.
---
Doubt seriously they will enable that ability back.
---
That was my major concern since some of the automatics just spit out bullets. Is there a caliber that is the most cost effective? I assume .38 but the damage wouldn't be optimal.
---
Personally I don’t mind waiting 10 seconds every time I load the game initially, but maybe your lag lasts longer than that? I have a very weak PC so i’d be surprised, but it just gives me a little bit more time to do read my book or do something on my phone 
---
I'm back with evidence they are banning people with duped items in their inventories, and like I said this was a really fucking stupid idea.
---
Jury Righing. Dismantle to repair, like New Vegas.
---
Yeah it’s a terrible decision considering the weight of everything involved. Don’t. 
---
Physx was used only for a few (or one?) effects. Everything else used Havok. We dont have those effect(s) in Fallout 76, so whats your point?
---
I updated the topic with a front picture.  
---
Unfortunately the mouth isn't open.
---
It just works ;)
---
I walked into a Red Rocket station a few weeks ago and saw that someone had killed a family of foxes that lived nearby. That was the most disturbing and upsetting thing I've seen in Appalachia so far p__q)
---
Please don’t use the TC words, bethesda might be watching 😖 You don’t wanna scare them do you 
---
Very little padding...or overstuffed i guess?
---
Yeah, like bug fixes 
---
Either my quad auto pistol or vampiric handmade. I’m a melee/explosive build but I like to keep those two to clear out low level mobs while farming chems and bobble heads 
---
Very cool!  Appreciate your time into this.
---
Some people prefer to treat this game as a solo adventure. I don't advise it but for those individuals they are SOL or need to put their grinding pants on because there in for a long journey lol.
---
If BGS doesn't add this it's just proof they're tone-deaf and don't care about their fanbase. Fucking shills. 
---
Before I even went to the video, I said to myself, "I don't really have 40 minutes to spend on this. What we really need is a list of the Easter eggs with timestamps." I went to the video, and you already did it. You rule!
---
Yeah, I had accidentally shot him.
---
Wwwwhhhhhhrrrrrrrrrrrrr 
---
what patch notes?
---
Has there been a patch today or something?
---
The veil of secrets from the Mistress of Mystery quest line works as a gas mask. 
---
All day farming and you never stored your junk? You got what you deserve. No way you’re not abusing some exploits if you carry everything you pick up all the time 
---
Physx support didn’t come to FO4 at launch, it came as a patch roughly a year later.  It also caused a lot of crashing for some users, crashing which was literally never fixed so a lot of us just couldn’t use it.
---
I think that instability might be one reason, but I think another could be that FO76 development was started on an older version of the game engine before Physx was implemented.  It might be cool to see them have another go at the feature though.  Maybe this time it’ll work for more people.
---
It sounds like you were confronted with a problem and decided to run away
---
There is also a skeleton near a box of explosives and a ignition plunger over looking a section of the golf course. I always assumed that was their reference.
---
SERIOUSLY!
---
Really? Shit that sucks
---
I thought independent physx cards were antiquated and they are now integrated into graphics cards? 
---
Boo get over it....this is a joke post 
---
everyone loves finding Graham, if Graham was just at another location offering the same crap plans he usually does no one would care.
---
Found him like 6 times probably, never had a plan i was interested in either the troll :/
---
Only reasoning would be he’s doing shady shit. Nobody carries a full day’s worth of loot around for hours without storing it. Fuck this idiot. 
---
I got a 2* level 50 suppressed (lower enemy damage output) / 33% vats hit hunting rifle off a legendary super mutant in Huntsville.
---
I have to agree.  If it really required that much data, there'd be a *lot* more people complaining about not being able to play it.
---
You know what......This guy has some good IDEAS!!!!
---
Has anybody asked for a viable hover board yet? 
---
Marty is that you?
---
I like this idea, works for a lot of other games and it would give us a purpose for all that extra crap we’re all lugging around
---
Maybe even put the game on sale for the weekend like overwatch does
---
I believe the cap on furious is 30%, so pretty low when you consider that beserkers or bloodied (with no other stacks) is 60%. I believe it's using base damage for each additional hit, so it's kind of counterintuitive that it should be reserved for higher base damage weapons with slower rates of fire. A good candidate, if this is the case, would be a harpoon gun, fat man, or possibly a missile launcher. A bad candidate, again based on whether this is how it works, would be most other non-explosive heavy weapons. And that's why a furious ripper or buzz saw blade is underwhelming.
---
Yes. Let’s all belittle the numerous problems with this game. None should be fixed and everyone mentioning a problem is a baby. Excellent post. 
---
The Prisoners Collar works really well with the helmet. It will add a nice unobtrusive red light to your collar for that extra "space beep" feel.
---
Most likely the latter
---
What's even more interesting is the bunker that's still in operation at Mount Weather
---
Happiness is a warm gun right? He was spreading joy!
---
It's a DPS machine and I love it
---
For the implications they had about the owner, or to add another descriptor to the image, maybe Like: why did someone as Pro America as the Overseer have an imported chinese panda toy; and coming upon a really creepy scene with a Teddy Fear overlooking it is unnerving, while having a normal teddy might have lacked that added bit edge 
---
Learning to ignore noise from the internet should be a required class in school. It is an essential life skill. YouTube is not a mandatory part of the internet. It makes Twitter look like Harvard.
---
What other people think about things - and what they think about YOU, too, for that matter - is none of your business 
---
Minigun or just the 5mm ammo should have an inherent armor piercing effect like it did in NV.
---
Or just buff the base damage by like 50%. Same with the LMG 
---
As his channel is actively advocating actions that break Bethesdas TOS, he very much so could lose his channel and even worse if Bethesda decided too they could very seriously sue for damages and win in a landslide as he actively encouraged actions that harmed thier servers and service which honestly I dont know if they should but the option is definitely on the table
---
You're boring me with your rant. Have a good day but the door is that way sir.
---
I SAID GOOD DAY TO YOU SIR.....
---
No, I haven't.
---
The initial load takes a very long time these days.  Like you say, there's another good 20 seconds where you're just standing around in the world too.  I tend to spawn right next to my CAMP and I've noticed that I don't have full control until my CAMP starts phasing into existence, so I don't know if that has something to do with it.  Like you, if I try to bring up the Pip-Boy in that time, I'm just stuck.
---
Ps4?
---
I save scummed so much because of companion burst fire.
---
I always feel like I have a lacy g-string on my face. The knowing looks from other players: "Ooh, you've been making the acquaintance of the Mystery ladies again, haven't you, laddie..."
---
Could just have it appear on the shelf as a part of it when you put it on instead of having it be a droppable item. As in the shelf is an inventory that you place the bear or whatever on.
---
this!
---
should be boss variants off all of them, Mothmans, Behemoth, Rad Scorpians, Mole rats etc. What made Bethesda thing that 1.....1 boss per map per nuke per game ever was enough for a multiplayer game.
---
It's almost as if no one at Bethesda has ever played an online game, a multiplayer game or even a MMO. It's almost as if they haven't even bothered playing FO76 yet as well :(
---
I want Half Life 3
---
All I’d like is frickin sharks with frickin laser beams attached to their frickin heads 
---
Taking caps upon successful load rather than immediately would be a simple band-aid until they fix disconnection issues. Wouldn’t mind seeing that change. 
---
PC. When the game was about to be released i had a dilemna: spend $250 upgrading my PC to be able to play or spend $250 and buy an xbone s and play with my buddy. I decided to upgrade my pc in the end bc i dont think my buddy would've actually enjoyed the game and i heard it wouldnt run great on the xbone s. 
---
The last remaining doggo left in WV and you shot him!? Murderer!! lol
---
This channel is amazing. One of my favorites and I'm not even a collector anymore
---
Second time I've seen this reference...
---
Second time I've upvoted.
---
Fack you beat me to it 
---
And we've gone too far.
---
F
---
I need the ability to ride dragons, turn into a werewolf, and shout my enemies to death.
---
Blah I didn’t read comments first. Somebody beat me to it 
---
Commencing countdown, engines on...
---
I would never! 😈
---
Unless they don't really care about the workshop but are instead 'attacking' it to be able to farm you for caps and junk...
---
Its never too many sharks...never
---
Pretty much this. Just having better weapons decreases the grind factor in this game so much
---
&gt;And Sugar Grove is lousy with fans and globes
---
And battered clipboards. I'm pretty sure I've gotten 40+ springs on some trips to that place.
---
Whatever it takes to make that item (weapon in this case) is what you should receive when you scrap it, just in smaller numbers.  End of story. 
---
The scorch beasts are basically DragonBorn.
---
nice, you would en happen to have a picture of that place, not sure how to find that exact spot :/
---
Dead 😂
---
Oh okay my friend was stuck in a loading screen once
---
Nah they are called Inert Bombs and you collect them in a daily event you get from a bot (named Boomer I think) found at that hotel in the Mire. They weigh nothing but look kinda cool.
---
I’ve concluded that the shredder barrel is the only way to use the minigun efficiently. Ditch the ammo and go to town. Breaks fucking fast though
---
The reason is because of the extra effort it would have taken to make them, plain and simple
---
R u bots?
---
&gt;Why can't we have content and features?
---
Because you won't post your contact info / schedule. You're not making use of what is available so it's logically consistent to stick with 'lead you by the nose' spoon feeding content that lives up to the theme rather than rehash this issue - YET AGAIN - hoping for nothing other than an echo chamber karma farm.

See you guys next week, more reposting karma whoring?
---
Yeah if anyone says the forest is safe the haven’t lived in the forest lol, I’ve gotten attacked there more than anywhere 
---
I've moved everywhere and found that the top of Seneca Rocks is my favorite. Awesome view and no monsters spawning.
---
weird.  i've never gotten one of those.  i'll have to do another one of his quests and pay better attention.
---
Quoting other redditor, my power armor needs its power armor, gimme craftable liberty prime plz
---
This thread is a shinging example of the FO76 player base.  People playing a game they enjoy, and twats that label their griefing as being a raider.  We've reached the highwater mark follks.
---
&gt; I assume you might need more screws for the x-01. I have the plans, no rush to create it.
---
Springs were a bigger issue for me on the X-01 armor than the screws were.
---
&gt;I have a TSE Gatling Gun. It demolishes everything.
---
He's not talking about fixing problems he's talking about the ridiculous things that people are asking for that would completely break the game. Lighten up dude
---
We need to ask for even more ridiculous stuff so that the "compromise" Bethesda puts in the atom shop is better than a new hat every other week.
---
Chicken?
---
I sure hope so, they said the first major update is supposed to be THIS month but there’s only 5 more days? Idk what they’re doing 
---
Fallout: Gundam
---
The big problem with going this route is you cannot craft legendary.
---
They have as much detail as a random settler who joins you in fallout 4 and less options...
---
I like the idea too, but I'm not sure how convincing it would be.  Even if you come to 76 with knowledge of how past games work, there's definitely a learning curve and the game doesn't really explain itself that well.  Overcoming it can be very rewarding, but a lot of players (and reviewers) don't want to put in the effort to do that and condemn the game for not holding their hand.
---
If you've got Amazon Prime, their streaming service have a couple of interesting documentaries on the Flatwoods Monster and Mothman.
---
How would stabilized perk factor in when using an anti armor gun?  It claims it adds 45% armor piercing, how does that play with the 50% of anti armor prefix?
---
Certain weapon types and armor types. Like combat armor will always be lvl 50 but never 45 but marine armor will always be 45 and never 50. 
---
Only if you promise to save me the face. Nothing like a delicious boiled scorchbeast face to start your day. 
---
Is 2 shot missile launcher any good? Would both missiles lock on with the targeting computer to deal massive damage? Been curious to try that but haven’t found one 
---
Wooden skis don’t seem to auto scrap either for some reason
---
This is fucking fantastic
---
It just works.

Looks like you dropped this citizen.
---
Voltron, assemble!!!
---
Bought my TSE lever action for 2500 but my brother a TSE pump shotgun for 500...so depends on who duped what and how generous they are I suppose 
---
the question is, is the sword flaming but shots lasers or are the laser shooting out of the sword flaming?
---
I'm going to start compiling the pettiest complaints. My last comment is addressing how we have had dozens of "needs a hub" posts - there will be more next week. Starting to think you're a bunch of vote bots. Here is my FussOut 76 meta game list of whittling down the Dev's:
---
We should have a Fusion Core regenerator plan
---
Graham is proof that this game would benefit from more NPCs.
---
Idk if this has been said already, but is there a reason purified water isn't treated as boiled water?
---
Passive mode should make it to where other players can’t kill you, destroy your base, or interfere with your gameplay at all.
---
Legendary effects should be craftable
---
Can we get a roof piece to make bigger warehouses roofs more consistent?
---
[Console] - Can we get the ability to store more than 50 photos?
---
I’m quite tired of having to constantly have weight reduction perk cards taking up special points just to be able to manage my carry weight
---
A machinist shop capturable workshop where you can take steel and convert it into a choice of gears, springs, or screws would be cool.
---
You have to suspend your sense of reality in order to get some semblance of game balance - and there's really not much of that to go around already. Heavy weapons really should deal less damage given their sustained rate of fire and how much ammo between reloads. In a game where explosive AK47's exist, we really shouldn't be asking for realism
---
I'm from the Enclave and I kill lowbies with bounties. Then I add useful items to their bags to surprise them later. I figured it's better that I get rid of their bounty than some raider who'll just take their stuff.
---
Are you in need of a handmade rifle plan? i got one I can sell you for 1k caps. 
---
And yet I'm still farming too much to keep myself in ammo and stuff.
---
I'm getting sick of the constant farm. Must be hell for people that don't know where to go to get what they need
---
The Atom Shop is a whole other shipwreck. Like, i am not even tempted to spend my free Atoms. 
---
If I know the first number, part of the riddle goes away. 
---
I don’t see, why it’d be an unreasonable request to simple not include the solution in the title. I’m not saying it shouldn’t be posted at all, just a bit differently.
---
Where do you get them!?
---
If Bethesda fix there shit, start communicating and even ya'know add some features or content into the broken product they sold it might be a start hey ;)
---
Bethesda uses the sub so why not let them know about the issues? 
---
It's all good though todays into the vault should be full of info and content for us hey as they said it would be :)

finally at lvl 50, im strolling and I see him, but he dont see me, maxed out sneak and 3 piece chameleon armor. i get right next to him when he finally looks over. he then did a quick double take and kicked my ass with the swiftness before disapearing.
---
You only get 1 proc of luck of the draw per trigger pull. So if you're laying on the trigger, yes, you're gonna break it sooner. 
---
Yea I'll agree it's quiet but I think a lot of people forget about it 
---
Buff rifles, this kid is insane.
---
I'm a Heavy and I find my explosive Harpoon gun to be very effective at one-shotting most enemies. I bet a TSE Harpoon gun would be a monster. You should give the Harpoon gun a try.  
---
But I do agree that Heavy weapons in general aren't as efficient, and that they may need some tweaking to make em feel less dumb. I find myself carrying a single heavy weapon (harpoon or gatling gun) and a spear because of carry weight.   
---
I rarely use missile launchers or fatmans because not only are the guns heavy, but the ammo is too, so I can't just store them in my stash box and wait until I have enough to bring them out for a SBQ fight.
---
Yes sir. Right away!
---
FO2 world map traveling...

what level are you? I'm on PC and a casual player but i'll team up with you if you need a hand or some gear or anything
---
I bet it will sell for 12 caps. But now I want a Hunter's Explosive Missile Launcher, because that's the only way to go hunting, ever.
---
i like it
---
Maybe if 5 people come together in powerarmor we can Power ranger zord it up.
---
Waow mate! Nice work
---
Where is the space station?
---
Laser sword beats everything 
---
cant you just make a storage box at you camp to collect things in? and then use the stash on the go to dump things before moving them out of the stash when you get back to camp...? 
---
how does anyone "steal all the ghouls" from another player?  Are they marked as "YOUR" mobs somehow?  Last I recalled, if they fast traveled into Whitesprings, it was actually them that triggered respawns.  That's moot, since it's a online game and any mob out there is for anyone to kill or not kill.  
---
If someone is able to tag and kill them faster than you, then they are faster than you, not "stealing".
---
Works for me. Seems ironic and lazy that you DEMAND a hub MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY BELLIGERENTLY but won't post contact info.
---
Reddiquette allows me to downvote reposts.
---
no i live a mile from national forest in colorado, lots of sunshine in my life.  i can launch 3 nukes in under an hour.  git gud

I do have targeting HUD. I will try doing the quest without it I suppose. If I still bluescreen though, look for me to be the next “rage quit” video poster on YT lol.

In New Vegas I would keep them in the Sink, in the Big MT, in the safe next to the bed.
---
In Fallout 4 I always placed a footlocker next to my bed in my favourite settlement to hold all the teddy-bears, right next to my hamper filled with Frag Grenades.
---
In Fallout 76... I pick them up and they get scrapped the next time I press "Scrap all junk".
---
I have no clue how its works as a C.A.M.P. location as I just ran through it for the first time ever yesterday, but the big empty wilderness space to the east of the NAR (?) Rail depot that is south of top of the world might be a good spot. It looked really nice and I didn't see any enemies. Plus there is a river running through it and lots of tree cover. I even saw a few deposits, though I cannot remember which.
---
The Wise Mothman is from an event at the Landview Lighthouse.  Really easy one too.  Just kill a bunch of fireflys to power up the lighthouse.  Then he spawns at the end.  Any other ones I've seen have been random though.
---
I'm sorry to hear that :/ I wonder if this is a "new" thing caused by an update or if it's something that has been going since the beginning?
---
That's the Mek in the most recent Ark DLC pack, lol (other then the height, its only about 20% taller then the T-rex).
---
Vehicles would be cool, though whether the engine can handle them is kind of suspect. I can barely use the motorbike in 7 Days to Die because it turns the game into 2002 esque framerates and texture quality.
---
Praise be to Mothman!!!!!!!!!
---
Correct. I think the broadsider is only effected my demo expert too if I’m not mistaken, and bear arms applies to that too. 
---
lol, it may be the end of the story for you but some people are still following the ongoing narrative
---
....GLOWING flaming laser sword 
---
Server's wouldn't be able to handle it.
---
They should work on fixing stuff for current customers before trying to entice more in shouldn't they?
---
Awesome work!  Any chance I can get the full list of Mods too(Or know where its posted)?  I need to see if some exist.
---
I thought it was only supposed to be another bug and balance patch. (the one where TSE guns get nerfed) not so much major as about the 4th such patch.
---
I can definitively say the Holotape thing was fixed.  That happened if you were using the "Quick-Boy" interface (the one where the Pip-Boy is just overlaid on your HUD instead of physically showing your arm).
---
The rest really varies.  There are times when I'll go hours with no problems at all, and days when it seems like there's either a crash or a disconnect every 2-3 hours.  Part of it definitely comes down to nuke zones and how often players are firing them off.
---
OMG ROCKETCAT CONFIRMED!!!11!!1!!
---
It clearly says PC?
---
I think haikus are only supposed to be 3 lines...
---
This game is more like ark and rust, rather than fallout style gameplay, I enjoy this game because I enjoy survival games , but people who aren't used to the bugs that go with them will be rightfully upset
---
There are vertibirds. I know they aren't vehicles but they give me hope.
---
You know what's truly evil? They have plans for a display case. I bought it, super excited to display that exact same collection I had built up, only to find out it was purely decorative. Bethesda truly wants us to understand what it means to suffer in an apocalyptic wasteland.
---
Its a legendary drop. Not a quest item, so keep farming. 
---
man, that request is heavy...
---
Yes, you just use a second card.
---
750ti tends to be the sweet spot and they're $30 on ebay
---
BS articles?  I find charging for reused assets lazy and insulting.  Put them in game behind event quest rewards to give some more end game.  The atom store should sell new items we have never seen before.  After all we are being charged for them.
---
In before 'aToMs aRe FrEE'.  They are to a certain extent.  I've bought only a handful of items in my play time and the atoms go quick.  I have bought atoms so I could get the hot rod paint.  But actually using money to but them requires more justification to any purchase made.  I find $5 for a croche hat that doesn't support my characters haircut not even worth looking at.
---
If Bethesda fixed the game, added in content and generally looked after there customers they wouldn't need a free 2 play option or Demo.
---
The product would speak for itself and word would get around.
---
Marketing and gimmicks aren't what will improve the bottom line for Bethesda, it might be all they are capable off though :(
---
Yes! Such divine experiences will convert you. 
---
All hail the wise one(s)!
---
It's too high of DR to bother with a 50 cal. You can get your DPS close to the same at much greater cost to weapon condition and ammo. It's a resource hog
---
sorry, to clarify: 
---
they left the game in artists hands long enough to add 50 variations of teddy bears, but yanked it from gameplay devs before they could ensure energy weapons (a staple in FO lore) worked.  
---
today or tomorrow. But there should be one this week. 
---
that detonates a mini nuke every time you're hit
---
This one isn't tamed, it's a part of the Fertilizer Resource object.  
---
But, yes, you can tame animals.
---

---
When have i ever demanded or requested a hub?
---
/pat
---
Maybe as an event? 
---
I have one too. It’s pretty decent with the crystallizing barrel. Not sure how it as without that though. 
---
FYI the barrel adds ballistic damage but the stat screen is bugged if it’s an explosive legendary. See below. It’s misleading and doesn’t show your ballistic damage value for some reason, but the damage output is pretty good if you use it
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/G6u2pst
---
I'm five minutes in so far and I love this!! Your voice is very soothing and you have some really great informative tid bits!
---
Okay thanks, but do I need to nuke whitesprings or is it just as random without a nuke?
---
Sorry, i didn’t mean to say this update was supposed to be major. Just stating that they have claimed first DLC was supposed to be this month and there are only 5 days left and it doesn’t look like it’s happening .
---
I was complaining about this way back in release week. I had been collecting all the different stuffed animals until I realized there was no way to display them.
---
Unyielding is the only armor that grants +3 stats to all but end and that's only when low HP.
---
There is no high hp that gives +3 stats.
---
Vanguard gives up to +35 resists when high HP though, but that is not direct stats.
---
Bolstering is opposite Vanguard that gives + resists when low HP.
---
Running a bloodied weapon, you can run with Bolstering if rifles or Unyielding if melee.  (Or a mix but that would be a waste)
---
I'm down. 
---
SUMMOM LIBERTY PRIME 
---
Every container you make in your camp is a stash box. There is no other safe storage available.
---
turn down voice. Problem solved
---
They just need to rebalance scrapper and allow lvl 3 scrapper to give rare mats when you scrap armour, PA and guns. 
---
If I have to use ballistic weave to make shitty leather armour, at least give me the small chance to get some of it when I scrap armour. 
---
I agree, heavy weapons should do more damage than other weapons, however I think they should also come with a mobility penalty or at least weigh significantly more compared to non-heavy weapons (modded rifles seem to weigh about the same as heavy weapons). You probably should also not be able to use heavy weapons affectively without power armor.
---
You could but the garage door at the front wall to use a gate with a switch :D
---
With confetti
---
DMV!
---
So basically you want a Gundam Wing... I also want this.
---
The plan is, Modern Couches. 
---
This guide has been so helpful in figuring out what plans do what. 
---
Next time this happens... launch a mini nuke at him
---
Listen: flaming laser swords need to happen. 
---
My headsets busted plus most of the time all I’d have to say is here take this gun what kind of ammo do you need are you good on stimpacks?
---
1.) Ps4
---
2.) EVILWATSON9 ( and Kylie Brandon for reference)
---
3.) Have a photo but don't know how to add there :[
---
4.) I collected enough parts to creat a lvl 50 tier x-01 chest piece. Despite all parts listings being white font and applied, the chest piece selection is light grey (unavailable) and says I need parts. On the Kylie Character, I do not have this issue. (Btw, a resource transfer tool between characters would be a great addition as she could make the armor and transfer to Evil). What's puzzling is that the Kylie chat is lower level, and doesn't have the power crafting perk Evil does. It makes no logical sense and is irritating the bejeebus out of me...
---
5.) No ticket as of yet.
---
Yeah, I got stuck in the cliffside at glassed cavern. All I could do was sit there and get destroyed by scorchbeast sonar blasts. Lost a lot of DPS, then I was disconnected and lost my junk
---
Is it really too much to ask?
---
I'm listening. . . 
---
What is worse is spending caps to join and auto failing as soon as you load in as the timer ran out. 
---
Such a simple fix (visible event timers when you scroll over an event on the map) would save a lot of irritation. 
---
I have received several from Whitesprings nuke event ghouls.
---
Does intelligence improve the total length of the condition bar? Or is it always the same based on the item's level and the extra is only due to putting more condition over the default 100%? 
---
You can add me ign gireitami
---
Indeed.  I've begun to recognise the difference in weapons the game uses, and ones we use.
---
It's random got mine at uranium fever only level 40 aa grognaks axe but I love it
---
Had same issue, had to completely move camp to blueprint everything then break down the blueprints to force store everything 
---
Maybe they’re busy working and testing said major update? Or they could be sitting around with their thumbs up their asses. Who knows.
---
More like "go annoy someone else, you dweeb." I don't have the patience for little scrubs who think running around  shooting random players is funny when I'm trying to complete a task I've set for myself.
---
I noticed the opposite.  15 luck and crit savy and I crit every other or every 3rd shot. With four leaf clover I chain crit all the time.  MASSIVE improvement for me.  Very noticeable taking 4 leaf.
---
Good ol dragonrend
---
where did they say that? I have only ever scene that the content updates will start occurring in 2019. nothing ever had anything about one coming in January.
---
I believe it was designed that way in error too and they decided to leave it alone. Like it was supposed to me a semi auto sniper and coded it as automatic by accident and decided to keep it because it was more fun. Think I read that somewhere or I’m just talking out of my ass :) 
---
We all know the game was released unfinished, at this point all the aspects where the game needs to inprove are already told. One thing are the videos like ''10 things Fallout 76 could improve'' and others are ''fallout 76 didn't die, it was murdered''. 
---
GET BEHIND ME, SATAN! THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELS YOU!!!
---
I'm hoping for ITV today, PC patch tomorrow, console early next week.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was ITV today or tomorrow, PC patch next Thursday, console early the following week, though.
---
The facetune is SO strong here. 
---
Obvious! 
---
I get that all the time.  Especially with concrete stairs 
---
I'm EU my ign is gireitami
---
This does randomly happen. It’s a bug. You have to completely move your camp
---
See your 600, laughs even more with his 1357 screws, and 1200 springs.
---
lol; says the player who can only figure out one possible reason for this problem :p 
---
There's a whole storyline in town about him and the couple he is with. Heartwarming in a tragic kind of Appalachia way.
---
Nope nothing running in the background, I'll check it again (for a shorter period :)) after work today. I'm in total agreement that 6gb/hr would be a bit much for a MMORPG . I'll also make sure nothing is running on the iPhone either. I'll report back in tonight and thanks for the support!
---
Thanks for letting me know guys thought this was a quest reward.
---
Why do you need screws? I use them periodically here and there, I really do, but I have 500+ and considering selling them, but waiting till we get vending machines since seems people have issues finding them, I don't know why? I just can't get rid of them...
---
Sure he is the most sexist persion out there 
---
Torble  is my username 
---
That's not really true though, i use my phone as hotspot to play Fo76 cause my internet provider sucks and dc all the time, and i consume 200-300mb/hour at most.  
---
Maybe your laptop has some programs in the background that pull data usage ??
---
Sam_is_scribbles I’m Australian so we might not get to play together unless I forget to sleep 
---
Decrease prices too, and eliminate all limited time items, they should stay in the atom shop if added, not go away after a couple of days.
---
&lt;facepalm&gt;
---
FLAMING LASER SWORDS NEED TO HAPPEN!
---
Assault rifles are good for selling and that’s it. I routinely can sell them for 15-30 caps each depending on durability and if I take charisma drugs. I only have hard bargain 1.
---
Other than that it’s completely outclassed by the handmade in every way 
---
There’s no other reason someone would walk around with an entire session’s worth of loot without storing it. Even if storage is full you gotta make room somehow, can’t carry everything forever. Clearly he’s up to some shit. 
---
That is weird, he has only ever given me quests where i collect the inert bombs, now I got tons of em.
---
I'm listening . . . 
---
If you read the title in added [PC] for a reason.
---
There is an emergency protocol mod for PA chest that works about the same way if you really want it.  I'm really tanky in my PA and hardly go under 50% health, don't let that be a deal breaker for you. 
---
It's an island. It has Deathclaw. 8/10 would visit again #truthinadvertising
---
Wahhhhhhhhhh I want the ability to be a Jedi and use the force wahhhhhhhhhh
---
Are you using a targeting HUD on your helm?  
---
I removed mine and only locked up once and no CTDs.  It was the first crash free evening in a Whitesprings nuke zone since the patch!
---
oh wait, i do remember that.    it's been awhile.  you collect them for the quest.   i was thinking quest rewards.
---
i don't remember what I did with them.
---
Im online now, so im down to play
---
Back in the day, the very first Madden for PC had one issue.  If you called a post pattern the AI never could defend it.  Not once.  
---
So you were always tempted to get out of a 4th and whatever by calling a post.  So people did.  People can't overcome the temptation.  That's human nature.    
---
All that was needed was to patch that one play.  But, back then, games were only patched if you wrote to ask for a disk be mailed to you... :D
---
Quite like the golf course resort just by the small stream. Very rarely gets attacked and there’s also a lot of friendly robots around that jump in to help
---
It’s quite a popular spot so you do get the “cannot place your camp” a few times
---
I think events need to give more caps, as of right now, you spend more traveling to them instead of making.  
---
Not to mention most of the times map is dead and only 1-2 events active or less.  
---
We need more events and more rewards imo.
---
hehe.
---
I would love to see an early liberty prime bot in the game, but I'm pretty sure it would crash the servers and break the game permanently.
---
&gt; Kind of makes you wonder if they are really doing proper QA before releasing updates.
---
At this point we aren't wondering anymore, we know they aren't lol
---
Thanks for the updates.  Even though the atom store is lackluster at times it's good to be informed of items just in case something good appears.
---
Ummm no.  Get invite so someone can know my CAMP location so they can knock it down?  No thanks.
---
You can collect, but you can't display for more than 60 seconds at a time...
---
until you realize a main quest is broken and you can only fix it by loading from save. But you can't back up to an earlier save because you've been saving over the same slot for the past 4 hours
---
You’re gonna die, clown. 
---
Yeah, I can remember 10. The same amount as a phone number 
---
Plus I tend to use patterns to memorize codes.
---
Ex:3-10-5-11 
---
Single 
---
Double 
---
Single smaller number 3
---
Double smaller number 10
---
Single bigger number 5
---
Double bigger number 11
---
It sounds weird and maybe doesn’t make sense in my head ... but it works for me.
---
Sorry, but if you're modding the game, you can't complain about crashes.
---
I use my hotspot every day to play Fallout on, never used more than 1gb for a 4 hour session. You must have updated something and not realised it 
---
10 seconds would be wonderful. My loading after hitting PLAY takes a few minutes and when it launches I wait 10-20 seconds for the game to pop in and catch up. 
---
To me it sounds like this thread is full of people who don’t like to be faced with something difficult. I assume that any time you have had a problem you have had somebody else solve it for you. You guys simply do not know how to stand up for yourselves. Honestly it’s quite sad that you have to cry about you getting killed on Reddit. The workshops were most definitely meant for PVP and for more engaging online experience. It’s not hard to understand that the game is meant to have these sort of challenges. If you want to complain because I level is killing you and simply change servers or get off the game. The workshops in the game are not required for you to even go near. It also seems to me that when you are using an argument you bring up invalid points not to relating whatsoever to the actual thread. Honestly it’s just sad to see people like you on this type of thing who don’t know how to handle themselves. It’s simple if you do not like the game do not play it
---
Stacking bobblehead's...or some newfangled exploit people are sitting on waiting for the next patch that fix's 150 things before they announce it to the wasteland.
---
Bethesda official line though...."It just works"
---
I've found stuff in them on occasion. However, I have never-and I mean never-found anything by choosing to search a petrified corpse. All I ever get from that are rads.
---
"I'm feeling particularly energetic today."
---
A combination between exploit and an extremely unbalanced game.
---
Same.  Even though I begrudgingly hate the fact it's not in game already.  Bethesda know it's a popular item and I'll be shocked if it's not limited.
---
I have Acid Deposit and will never move.  Yes, I have to log/relog a lot because people take my camp spot.
---
For Ores, its very easy to do a trip to get lead/ores of at least 110 each.    Acid? no so much.
---
Oh yeah I take around 8 minutes of loading screens to play, I meant 10 seconds of lag when finally in game and in control of my character before I do anything.
---
I only have to die 2-5 times when taking on a Yao Guai. Putting my entire junk stash  in the open in a convenient paper bag for anyone to take or lose seems fair. 
---
A snorkel would be cool
---
It was in an old thread, but Bethesda Jess (or Jess Bethesda) said that an Inside the Vault was likely for today: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agn5ir/will\_there\_be\_an\_inside\_the\_vault\_today/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agn5ir/will_there_be_an_inside_the_vault_today/)
---
Spend 25 caps to travel to claim workshop. spent my own resources to build generator, but worth it for all the resources I'm gonna get while I play for the next 5 hours. Disconnected 30 seconds later, no longer have enough aluminum for next generator.
---
A lot of duplicated bubble heads!
---
I wanna shoot rose in the face.
---
Good job.
---
Bobble head exploit? I’ve heard you can dupe the melee bobble head an it stacks with itself... haven’t seen it in person though. 
---
We need more robot settlements and groups with quests tied to them. Bethesda did robots right in fallout 4. My favorite quests and locations were USS Constitution, the Far Harbor vault, and the General Atomics Galleria. Grey Garden was funny too.
---
Idk why they didn’t add more of these kinds of robots in 76. Would work with no NPCs and they provided some of Bethesda’s funniest quests and gameplay moments in fallout 4
---
Simple, you can boil water with soil in it and drink it 
---
Or you can drink clean water with no soil in it 
---
That’s how I look at it lol

*That's pretty groovy baby.*
---
And another post making me glad that I returned this game.
---
You can keep repeating that you can only come up with one reason for this situation all you want. What may be clear to your opinion without evidence, questioning, or a pursuit of the facts might not be apparent to others. Just by stating something doesn't make it so, lol
---
I've absolutely cleared through two nuke zones, three events, and four or five story missions before I was killed; when I went to pick up my dropped loot I was shocked at how much awesome stuff I'd been collecting and scrapping (black titanium, a messload of springs, crystal, fiberglass, stable flux, and even a few bulked items I'd forgotten to sell off. There may be reasons that you cannot see from your particular play perspective!
---
It seems to mostly be based on what level it first unlocks - if its an even number, then it goes up to 50, if its odd, then 45. It seems like something that would be easy to change in the future.
---
shut up, todd
---
Jess the community mod posted in some random thread from a week ago that she expected it to be today.
---
She's the best Community Manager.....making us hunt for the info then ignoring the community, standard Bethesda practice i guess!
---
Speaking of junk, I’d like to know if anyone has made a list of the “pieces of junk you don’t need; drop most of it”   
---
hmmm....didnt know that. i just got the game last week and I'm still catching onto things like that. 
---
yeah, they should let you craft individual inventory boxes for things that ppl like to collect. ... otherwise, what's the point of having collectable items? 
---
Very nice.  I like the internal generators.  I have mine in a room up off the floor, walled off.  
---
Can I come by and use your outhouse? :D
---
In Morgantown near the airport and train station is my perfect spot. It's right across the river from the Red Rocket. It's such a small piece of land, but it works because there is so much to loot for junk/meds nearby.
---
I feel as though a lot more casual players picked up this game, and they all just want everything to be given to them.  Super annoying. 
---
It was a site to behold. 
---
The whole server was just left standing staring at each other like wtf just happened?
---
no idea tbh...
---
lmao testing the update....
---
I vote on thumbs up arses!
---
Because they can be used in the ski blade melee weapon.   ( essentially whole junk ingredients for recipes shouldn't get scrapped automatically) 
---
There’s sort of a built in difficulty sided, it’s east/west.  Not to be sarcastic.  
---
cheating.
---
No I'm gonna be honest the food and drink is already an annoying enough mechanic. I dont want yo waste my time sleeping too
---
Okay, but you have to admit that Super Mutants dropping Loose Screws makes *perfect* sense. 😉
---
So what damage buff is applied to scorch beasts, because to my knowledge the legendary stats they affect are animal, so surely you should be able to if you can do it to other animals?  
---
I also thought someone would have done this by now if this is correct, so is there something else preventing them (assuming they are animals)?
---
In what way is any of this unreasonable?  Live your dreams!!
---
I never said I was interested in role playing. I only said the game has potential for it. And that Bethesda didn’t really make any in-game mechanics that would facilitate role playing. Other than the perk system. Why should I rely on a third party website for establishing player factions? It’s fine if people use them, but it should be something you can do in game. Either way, Bethesda said they would add player made factions in a future update.
---
I'd spend atoms to run around in a swimsuit and snorkel
---
A display case would be pretty neat but I think it's towards the bottom of the list. Odds are they would put in in the Atom store anyway. 
---
Not just no, but hell no.
---
A dedicated "Yell" button just to deal with a single enemy type? Ain't gonna happen. Maybe if by killing the scorchbeasts, you could gain the ability to yell other stuff like "Fire" instead. Imagine that, playing a fire-breathing human! Or ice-breathing, and walk around the wasteland dressed like a viking. That would be epic. 
---
This place is sad
---
u/jessbethesda
---
Jess said it should be today yesterday in a random week old thread.
---
I mean, it’s safe.  Those creatures are harmless and die fast.  Even for a new player, they serve no threat.  
---
I love that you found the ghoul farm spot! Pretty sure we all recognized it immediately. 
---
So I used some of my free atoms to get the clean orange Space Shuttle-era suit &amp; helmet, but where do you get the clean Mercury-era suit? I’m only aware of the dirty version that spawns at the space station.
---
My teddy bear collection taught me how to manage my inventory lol. I still have one of each kind that I got when I first started playing and plan to keep it that way. I should note I don't collect Mr. Fuzzy stuffed animals, just the classic teddy bear. When I started collecting Mr. Fuzzies I sadly realized I had no room for them. ): If they ever up the stash box storage the first thing I'm doing is finally getting my Fuzzy collection.
---
"Exploiters are getting banned"

True
---
Everyone has a story like this in every multiplayer game I have played.  Unfortunate it happened to you.  I make a point for major events in games to prep, logoff, restart my machine, then log back in and proceed to help avoid this kind of thing and it has helped, but nothing is 100%.
---
Except missle launcher and fatman are affected by bear arms but not heavy weapon damage perks. 
---
Thank you for saving your extra scrap for players in need!! Our community's awesome sometimes :)
---
I always laugh when the legendary ones yell RUN AWAY!  and you have to chase them.
---
Idiocy. 
---
Yeah place a bet and the fighters get stripped of everything untill after the fight, so no armor stock list of weapons to choose from and no mutations so we can level the playing field. Then it's a game of skill that no previous glitch or exploit could effect the outcome.
---
Eating and drinking is so easy to manage 
---
I don’t feel like that’s a bad idea at all. 
---
I was playing around with it when I noticed my fast travel would make me break my legs. Rotating the box successfully placed me on the platform I wanted. I hope this works for you, too.
---
You’d think that an alien race that has mastered interplanetary travel would have a stronger blaster then just 13 plus or minus energy weapon buffs
---
I see it only firing one with lock on. Though rarely I see a second missile burn trail. It might just be firing one or both inside each other.
---
I like the picture though I need to get into a group
---
I, too, would like to play as Voltron.
---
I would be in favour of this, but the food and drink requirements are already far too exaggerated so I don’t trust the devs to implement it. 
---
I know right the guys gonna smash my skull and track me down
---
It's a pointless time sink
---
Jess? Obviously I'm not up to date. Who's that? A community manager?
---
This will be the 3rd week in a row to get them on Thursday 
---
Running any mods?  
---
I am finding shorter wait time on initial load on \[PS4\] but I've learned not to move a muscle until my PA fills in and the Fusion Core percent shows.
---
lol :P
---
Ha, I see what you mean there. But it only goes from easy to meh.
---
so he can multibox and transfer items from one account to another very easily with both toons online at the same time more than likely!
---
I have an explosive flamer... It's pretty fun even if it's not the best gun ever due to durability and fuel consumption. 
---
The basic weapons and light armors are available at level 1. More powerful weapons / heavier armor unlock at either level 5 or level 15. So it’s understood that, even though some items stop at level 45 they’re considered more robust than - or at least equal to - those that make it to 50.
---
If you're on pc I'll give you 5k for it
---
Yeah, I'm constantly amazed by how often I find *Plastic*, of all things, to be a limiting factor.  You would think it would be the one resource I'd be swimming in.  It's not that I don't know where to find it, or what contains it, but bulking and repairs chew through the supply very quickly.
---
It’s simply not feasible in an entirely online world where timescale is server based rather than player-based. You couldn’t possibly sleep for 8 hours and get a good rest in this environment.
---
I'm not even mad, that's amazing
---
The only heavy gun I use is my very fast hauling gun with a fast receiver and fast legendary effect. 
---
Were just asking for things that were in working fashion in the last iteration of a Fallout game. 
---
Really not asking that much. Increased stash limit? Ability to decoarate things at your camp? Actual legendary drops that aren't wood armor? Actual rewards from killing some of the hardest enemies in the game? 
---
Freakin sharks with freakin laserbeams attached to their freakin heads!
---
It was after a 8 our work day... played almost two hours and then this happened.
---
It was to much for me to understand...

Got it, one Gundam coming right up.
---
Thats weird - I tested my revolver with no rifle perk, then just rifle perks, then rifle and pistol perks together and didnt see a change between rifle and rifle+pistol.  Maybe I need to check again
---
I am surprised cryolators are not used more at these events.  They slow the queen so much its like she is frozen in mid-air.

I enjoy walks around Cranberry Fog. Not a picky eater. Will try to leave his on enemies so everyone gets EXP. May ninja weird outfits to make you only slightly uncomfortable to be seen in public with me. Had an Uber Rating of 76.0. wants more preserved pie :)
---
I can see those scenarios. The Camden park and the other park I cant think of off hand have tons of bears for no real reason other than "hey look at all these bears."
---
Who? No I’m Calvin, Calvin Klein. ;)
---
3rd one today.  
---
heaven help this subreddit when they stop doing them.....
---
I've been having a similar issue of invisible solid objects in my Camp that I have to climb over, looks like I'm floating 
---
There not replacing quest items that disappear either, the GM's response to the guy that posted it here on reddit was start a new character....they can't track any items in or out.
---
Yeah... I was thinking the same thing.  Just because he could not manage his stash, he thought to buy extra's for mules to hold crap?
---
But I hardly ever crash since the duping patch/duping bans took effect.   Its actually much better now (PC).
---
Getting 500 hours out of a game or $60 bucks is actually pretty good IMO
---
I agree, it's just tedious for the sake of artificial difficulty
---
It works great until you take a staggering shot. You can get staggered from a crit and all shots until the stagger animation ends won’t be reduced by sentinel. AFAIK, staggering is related to high damage 
---
This has come up many times here. 
---
Didnt say it was hard to manage I said it was annoying. I dont find the idea of always having to drink my water and eat my canned dog food an all the instamash necessary. Other than wasting perk slots and being a nuisance eating and drinking restrictions are just annoying. I dont want to add another time sink mechanic into this. I just wanna wander the wasteland. But I cant even leave my controller to go do something for a few minutes without coming back and being dehydrated and starving and taking damage from the invisible food gods. I have tons of recipes and food I have my own farms I kill brahmins and dogs cook the steaks. But it's just not fun.
---
Tldr: food management is ANNOYING enough dont add more bullshit just because.
---
Pretty sure we are the QA guinea pigs
---
It's a game where we're supposed to be rebuilding America. So it makes zero sense to me that we're forced to destroy all those little bits of America that make it unique.  
---
One more reason why I think this is all just a communist simulation experiment.
---
You see, if you had led with the customer service that would have been a conversation.  
---
I can't argue with the customer service portion, it's been very poorly handled.
---
Idk why your worried about it. Majority of ITV have just been spun up bs.
---
 "Were taking a hard stance on cheaters"- still cheaters everywhere.
---
 "We have content coming this year"- no shit.
---
"150 bugs were fixed"- games running worse
---
cool
---
So don't spend any perk slots on it.
---
What you need is going to vary quite a bit based on your build and how you play.  That's why most tips revolve around "If you need this, there are the objects you should seek."
---
Mole Rat Teeth do get scrapped with scrap all. Im guessing (myself included) people first do scrap all then scrap weapons and armor and if you scrap a Mole Man Gauntlet you get teeth which explains why people still see teeth in their inventory and stash after doing a scrap all.
---
A 2 shot explosive that when stacking bobbleheads blows off armor and one shots the queen.  Oh wait...that's already in the game.
---
No need for new weapons.  Need to buff energy weapons.  Increase durability of heavy ones.  Make flamer fuel last longer than 5 seconds.  Buff pistol builds or require less perk slots so they can be treated as a secondary rather than a primary with poor dps.
---
I enjoy the game dude but your post is complaining about user feedback.  Feedback is good no matter how stupid.  It creates discussion and generates ideas for the game.
---
The weightless is erratic, I have a blooded missile launcher (with weightless) that one day reverted to 20 lbs for example, and a weightless raider torso that went to 12lbs
---
Doesn't upper level Scrounging do this?  Allow more of these rarer items on breakdown?
---
I'm level 75 and have an explosive plasma gatling I picked up from a legendary in Whitesprings last week. The thing is sweet af and comes in handy when fighting scorchbeasts. 
---
True story: when I was still lower level I went into my first blast zone teamed up with my son, who was a higher level than me at the time and was basically protecting me so I could farm experience from tagging the baddies and letting him finish them off.  He also let me loot the bodies to increase my inventory. One of the loot items I got from that excursion was a TSE. At the time, however, I didn't realize exactly how powerful these weapons were. It was above my level so I couldn't use it and it also took up a lot of precious stash space.  So what did this ignorant little noob do?  I sold it. To a vendor bot.  For a few paltry caps.  FML.
---
So a playable version of Power Rangers: RPM? (aka the best one) Sign me up!
---
Holy crap really? I heard it's also getting an update with NPCs!!!
---
No one has links because its not happening.
---
2 people got banned because of there activity on you tube. There was also someone editing a ban from ESO to make it look like it was from FO76 (fanbois are weird) but nothing yet on this ban hammer wave that's going round. Apparently its all over there discord and everyone's friends with a ton of dupers that have been banned but no one's got minerals to post up proof.
---
Of course could be wrong as am open minded but it smells like more Bethesda hype and speculation to me :)
---
You need to though Haha if you dont all that shit drains faster and you need twice as much food. Cmon you know this dont be ignorant because you're on the internet. Fo76 I love it but it should be called micro managing simulator
---
Good info, I'll check the keywords on the weapon.  
---
In all my time I've only found one and accidentally scrapped it :(
---
No mods. Clean vanilla game. It worked almost flawlessly right after the last patch but some time between then and now it too a turn for the worst. Again, not sure if a new duping exploit was found or Bethesda failed yet again. 
---
Mistress of mysteries
---
Workshops is a pvp area. Omg how do you not understand that? Yes i would definitely kill a players that behave just like you and keep your loot drops. Im a real nice guy but i can also be a real jerk when pushed. Today i killed a lvl 58 and a lvl 40 holding a workshop. 2 vs 1, after i mailed the lvl 40 on ps4 told him he could take his workshop back that i wouldn't kill him again. He was real cool about it and i ended up joining his group in case they needed to defend the workshop from others. I ended up crafting him a set of marine armor. Gave him some lvl 45 legendary pieces, tons of plans and some good game tips. Playing the game as it was intended is not griefing especially when im willing to return it aftwards. Griefing would be if i ported to your house in the pve zone and blew it up then killed you and took your loot. No i will not play a different game but you sure can go play somthing else if you dont like the pvp aspect of Fallout76. You have the hole rest of the game to play pve why do you feel the need to play in a pvp area then cry about getting killed?  Do you wish that more players quit the game due to lack of pvp? You know that they give lower lvl players extra benefit  in pvp vs higher lvl players to balance pvp. Your perfectly capable of killing me. I never even use power armor when taking workshops. Im actually pretty squishy.  The right thing to do would be to make these workshops more balanced and fair for the pvp players in the game. Im sorry if you dont agree with me. Your entitled to your opinion.
---
One Punch Woman?
---
I seem to be offloading a lot of bulk rubber!!  Not really sure where it all comes from!
---
(Insert S&amp;M related comment here)
---
exactly, but in my fight she was frozen on the ground, almost harmless, just usually bullet-spongy;)
---
Yes, it's torture.
---
Lol. It's no one "thinks" it's happening. Its confirmed that it isn't. I'm allowed to be annoyed by straight up lies on the internet.
---
Which is still unacceptable. 
---
I saw this vendor once early on and have yet to cross paths with him again. First trip I found the bathrobe and didn't buy it. I have the best worst luck sometimes. Haha
---
Thanks, will add
---
They said they were to ANNOUNCE the first major update this month
---
Item leveling goes.. 5, 15, 25, 35, 45 or 1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
---
If it ends in 5 then it can go up to 45
---
I'm compiling about people. Sucking the fun from the game. 
---
Please.
---
This game regularly disconnects.
---
Will add, the weight reduction items seem a little spotty at times.
---
Apparently doesn't do much though.
---

I can’t speak to what you just said because you just made it up. However, telling people not to buy a game based upon a future prediction is disingenuous at best. It is especially suspect coming off of an unverified rumor that he just started a week ago. 
---
Let's do it 
---
No thank you
---
Is server stability in nuke zones too much to ask for? I know it puts a lot of strain on the server and all, but last night i was in two different SBQ fights, we almost kill her and the server crashes AND my game blue screens. It's the first time i've really had any issues with this game, and makes me seriously question if i want to keep doing this "end game" content.
---
I can't think of a context where "a couple of hours" is ever meant as two. I don't know what your first language is nor do I care to, but you're hanging this whole "you're empirically wrong cause it's implausible" thing on very shaky semantic ground. Pretty weak. Dismissing *my* experience because of your *linguistic* ineptitude in another case is absurd. Saying you're being obtuse is just the kindest way I could put it. Lets drop the charade. You're a fucking asshole. I'm done. Good riddance.
---
Thanks, lots of long nights running McClintock, The Asylum, And every place else I could fine clipboards, phones, fans and typewriters. My wife literally begs me to log in when she needs to repair her stuff and she is running solo.
---
It would be a griefers weekend aswell.. 
---
There is power counters that cycle through random numbers, you could use that for gambling
---
The point is not for trolling but to compile a comprehensive list to get issues resolved.  
---
I can say that many an online game has had as many, if not more, Bethesda is not alone in having a laundry list of issues to fix.
---
You can already sleep in FO 76.  No difference. You have to wait 10 seconds and you are fully refreshed. My idea was about the regular requirement of this. You know what I mean?
---
nice, will check, thanks :)
---
Nope.  But we do have some mutant sea bass.
---
Try the t60. You lose some dr rr and er but plastic aluminum and steel repairs are godly
---
I don't think it's the amount of events, it's just the motivation to do them. A lower event count in theory should mean more players should be at these events, it's just they are not rewarding or dynamic in anyway.
---
It's a role playing game. More immersion. ;-) 
---
What an idiot. He should have taken high ground.
---
It's multiplicative. So It's [1/(1-AP1*AP2*AP#.....)]^0.366
---
I thought the RNG was shit. Fuck me that is frustrating.
---
Hang in there, brother.
---
I just want to fish. 
---
Fuck people. The end. 
---
Driving past a forest on your way to GameStop doesn't count bruh.
---
If you launch 3 nukes a day I'm sure you probably are really gud at video games. Now you just need to get gudder at getting a job, a girlfriend, and going to the gym.
---
Ouch!  
---
On Ultra-wide myself, question(s) for you:  
---
-Did you adjust the mouse scaling?  
---
-Did you disable the mouse acceleration features using the *.ini edits?  
---
I have a house Southwest of watoga, oh a cliffy area with a private pond and gorgeous view of fissure site prime and all the nukes. It also has a copper extractor. Friend me ign:stonekraken if on PC and I'll show you exactly where and then logoff so you can build. 
---
Post removed. Go fucking figure.
---
I too I seen Grahm at least 4 times at Sunshine Meadows.
---
Great catch!  That is exactly how I work my scrapping process.
---
Handmade, m79, 50cal MG
---
You realize you could just, you know, make this a "rule" for your character to follow, right?
---
Wtf is this.
---
Victory is exactly what you make of it. A similar game is EVE Online, where you basically make your own fun (and I like this about FO76).
---
You bring up a mildly disturbing point - it is possible that 60k people think "fun" is duping/cheating. That's just a gross thought. How pathetic. 
---
One day soon people log on to fallout 76 to find their TSE weapon replaced by a plastic bottle and a "canvas" bag that when scrapped gives you plastic instead of cloth.
---
I did not adjust the mouse settings - only the resolution.
---
Oldie but goody I forgot to add.  
---
Some of us are wondering if this is a "Gandhi" issue, where the to hit percentage wraps around back to zero, but reports a 95%
---
Bathrobe definitely sounds like a luxury item in the Wastelands.
---
Thanks, will add to the VATS section
---
Volume is 10% of the annoyance, the voice is the other 90%.
---
If you pick up a teddy bear then put it back down again, it becomes...   
---
FLASH! BAM! ALA-KA-ZAM!  
---
The teddy bear has turned into a paper bag!  Wasteland magic!
---
It has and continues to be.
---
The list you guys have compiled looks like an every day patch list for most other online games. Ya' know stuff most of them keep on top off and get fixed. For some reason though its the customers here that are doing it. Can you guys fix them as well? I think at this point you have more credibility than Bethesda does :(
---
Don't really want a conversation with you about semantics though its more about exposure and letting Bethesda know its not acceptable. They took money for a product that wasn't fit for purpose and continue to hide away hoping people will forget and pre-order there next game whilst the community does there job for them :(
---
I guess should have leveled up on my PC account, at least the modders will be able to fix this mess in a year or two perhaps.
---
English is my first language. And how racists to try and use that as a justification.
---
You are trying to pretend couple doesn't mean two. It's literally the definition of couple. 
---
It's your attempt to rewrite what couple means that is pretty weak. All because you can't stand being wrong. It's your charade. You are welcome to drop it anytime you want. 
---
Racists asshole. 
---
they are going to nerf those weapons soon instead of 100% &gt; 25% damage    
---
and some other things
---
Charleston workshop has three junk excavator sites, good for most junk except adhesive for some reason.
---
Short and sweet, with a twist at the end. Well done!
---
It isn't too unusual to see a tiny area of a low level map have far out leveled enemies in an RPG. It's almost a sort of traditionally be(at least if I believe tv tropes - and maybe I shouldn't ;p)
---
 I suspect people were expecting something along those lines.
---
Time sink is a bit harsh.  Unless you think eating and drinking are pointless too. But that's what makes it a survival game. And I must say I love this aspect of the game. It's immersion. 
---
They need to fix events in general alot of them are buggy af.
---
In F04, I used to collect all the Quantums and use them to light up my main settlement with their beautiful glow. Never drank one!
---
Ahh, I to have felt this dread, I refuse to pick up bears anymore till something is done
---
Bang, bang, shooot shoot.
---
Screenshots would be great!  
---
Death while getting mutations seems to cause some issues.  
---
Also, if you'd like I can make a little over half the mutation serums, if you wanted to contact me through discord I could see if we could RadAway your mutations and then replace them via Serum, see if it resolves the glitch.
---
Somewhere, on some plane of existence I like to think they know and appreciate what a toll having to make that decision took on you.
---
May their souls finally know peace.
---
I haven't experienced that. Been pretty smooth sailing for me. I did have an incident yesterday where it was a bit laggy when I went to trade with a vendor. Took a couple seconds for their inventory to load. But besides that, haven't had any issues.
---
Burial at sea you say? 76's dlc confirmed... bioshock crossover
---
The Clean Spacesuit is sold by the Responders Vendor as seen in the photo. He's a random "event", if you want to call it that. In this case we found him at Charleston Station.
---
What does "CD" mean in this context? 
---
Well, that's some power fantasy.
---
Release the meteorrrrrrrrr
---
Well, there is that as well, RNG god(s) curse some of us.
---
Eh, I'm used to breaking my games with mods so crashes and instability are not a huge deal for me. It's less crashes than I get with Skyrim, 3, 4 and NV.
---
 It's gotten more stable for me as more patches have been implemented, it was pretty horrible back in November for me. 
---
Springs: Sugar Grove, Camp McClintock, Enclave pest control missions (Yau gui)
---
Screws: Sugar Grove, West Tek Research Facility, Abandoned Bogtown secret room ( All the way to the top of the scafolding between 2 tall buildings, drop down elevator shaft.)
---
Lead: Lucky Hole Mine and Excavator Armour
---
Copper: Abandoned Bog Town, copper nodes and Excavator Armour opposite Whitesprings Train Station
---
Acid: Whitesprings for Abraxo, Hemlock holes workshop for 3 acid nodes
---
Plastic: Any cafeteria
---
Steel: Hornwright Air Cleanser Site #03 for Iron, lead and gold ore - Excavator Armour
---
I suspect it counts every enemy struck by the explosion as a “hit” to the weapon’s durability. With that, who knows what else counts as a “hit”? Cars? Random junk in the blast? Corpses? 
---
I tested once by shooting at an airborne SB and eyeballed the durability bar. It looked like a full bar = 25ish missiles. So it’s a very small bar as it is.
---
I’d be ok with it if they vastly reduced repair costs on it. That’s ok too. But otherwise, right now it’s literally not worth shooting the damn thing.
---
"Coooldown", the time it needs to activate again.
---
You will receive great loot and wisdom but only if you comment "Bless you Wise Mothboi".
---
It is a survival game... Those are basic qualities of the genre.
---
get the perk in the STR tree that reduces stim pack weight.
---
Gatling Gun and 50 cal MG tear things up ok in my book. Rest is kind of meh for different reasons.
---
So I am ignorant because I don't have any food and drink perks and I never run out? There are animals everywhere to cook and I get tons of purified water from my CAMP. 
---
Okay thank you, I'll reinstall. 
---
Wishlist of requirements (some dumb ideas also thrown in.) 
---
* Hub to be outside and not behind any loading screens.  (Unless global lobby of 50+ players).  Or even the missile holotape info.
---
* Be caravan themed.  
---
* Feature player vending machines that work like safety deposit boxes.  I.e, all packed together for easier browsing.
---
* Access to machines to cure rads, addictions, diseases.  
---
* if it's own cell, feature a train station board of upcoming nukes in worlds....or events already in the world to join.  
---
* Legendary item trade in.  Pawn in 3 one stars for a 2 star etc.
---
* Hook up a distribution system to workshops.  Have vending machines of junk, ammo, packaged food sent from player workshops directly to vendor.  Will give more incentives to hold a workshop.
---
Wouldnt make much difference would it.....there always so empty and vague :/
---
Hoping this one today will have some meat to it though!
---
Lmao idk. But seems he lost his mind because of griefers 
---
If you could toggle it like a hardcore mode like the other fallouts sure. I put up with what I have too. But just like i told someone else I'm not gonna slow walk everywhere for the "immersion".  
---
Melee weapons are really overcumbering so watch out for them
---
I get the same power armor mod schematic every time I do distant thunder. EVERY TIME.
---
Fireproof should be standard for all griefers.
---
Away from my desk, but if you google a bit there are settings for the mouse for us Ultra-Wide people, if you can't find it let me know and I'll dig it up later for you.
---
You mean, other than buying it on eBay, which is what 99.99% of people who claim to have found theirs do?
---
Need to cut out the salt from your diet, it’s not healthy.&gt; game
---
Kind of yes, though sometimes I do miss being able to fix things with console. ;P
---
I have been having the desire to start 4 again so I can get real weird with the base building (might even not install mods so I can be sure whatever I learn from building actually applies, haha)
---
Theirs a perk agility too that reduces weight of food and drink
---
I want to kill people that are asleep. ;-) 
---
You can get it from the quest “Tracking Unknowns” which is started in Harpers ferry.
---
Apparently a youtuber named theRealdonaldtrump said the game will be F2P as of tommorow. Also you don't get a refund, except 20 Atoms. also now F76 is entirely PvP.. deal with it.
---
-Most of reddit's stupid users
---
Hah! I was collecting them too because I thought for sure I would make a big display of them... but when I realized they weren’t going to be adding the ability to drop things and put them on shelves anytime soon, I just scrapped them. It was a sad day.
---
No, it’s on the inside of the vault articles on Bethesda’s website , it’s where they release patch notes for coming patches and their future plans.
---
We need this. But you can only use that ability once per episode, I mean, event. And only after losing the fight individually for a while. Because reasons.
---
My above post might sound like im critisizing, im not. I was just shocked at how many issues there are. Maybe i will stumble upon them as i play, currently i only experience crashes every now and again
---
Your build is not that far off mine. I would reduce END and CHA personally and add to PER, AGI and LCK. This is my build:
---

---
Using a lever action rifle and VATs crits, scorch beasts die  in 5 or 6 shots if you aim for the head. If stealth is blown, stand up then crouch again to return to [caution] with escape artist. Shotguns are for close quarters panic but I’ll probably get rid of those perks as I don’t really use them anymore. Useful mutations are marsupial, speed demon and eagle eyes. 
---
They said it will likely be Thursday.
---
It's the armor and weapons sounds like. I run PA (which ways nothing when worn) and only 1 gun. They really need to do something about normal armor. Maybe make it weigh nothing when worn so it's easier to manage your weight
---
No worries. Do you know about the bunker in Watoga that spawns marine plans too? 
---
That's literally the only reason I see anyone care about him after meeting him once. If anything it's a testament to having a traveling vendor sell rare shit
---
lol
---
Good listener too
---
I had to do this and dump a missile launcher as well.
---
Somehow, I've failed to visit Landview Lighthouse.
---
Most events are rewarding in that while you do spend caps to fast travel there, you get caps, stimpaks, rad-x, radaway, scrap, ore, etc. that make up for the monetary loss.  Hopping around events can be a very quick way to get a huge stockpile of stimpaks as each event could give a few.  On top of that you get XP for completion.  However, the most rewarding events are the ones that have lots of enemies to fight and for lots of XP and the ones that give plans like weapon, armor, and power armor plans as they're rare and it's a way of farming them.  Events like Census Violence, Distant Thunder, Line in the Sand, Uranium Fever, and workshop defenses I do all the time as there are usually good enemies to fight and I can get plans for doing them.  Any of the horde events?  Fuck running around the map for a small amount of enemies to kill.  Fly Swatter?  Haven't got a single good thing from that yet.  Back on the Beat?  Fucking boring as hell following that slow ass protectron around and for nothing worthwhile.
---
I wish he killed you just so I could see another post wah wah pvp in a game where pvp is implemeted
---
Awesome pics! I had the chance to take my teenage son with me on a hike of the Freedom Trail in Boston after both of us played f04 for a few years. It was great to see some of those same places and talk about them as we walked the entire day. 
---
Strange things, xo-1 armor bugs my game. But excavator does not. Xo1 I'm lucky to get 15 min a server, excavator is crash free. Doesn't matter if I'm in it or not.
---
Gunpowder, ores ,and  some notes which are in misc can weight you down without you knowing. I only carry about 100 gunpowder if any. 
---
Chems, spoiled food, and normal food can weigh a bunch. Meat weighs about 1-2 pounds. 
---
Junk that isnt scraped can weigh a bunch too.
---
I can't / won't argue they have dropped the ball on communication, transparency and Customer Service, and I don't want a debate on the semantics either, just trying to keep this thread focused and constructive. 
---
It's probably Bobbleheads.  The effects of Bobbleheads stack, and while there's a hefty degree of randomness in finding them (especially the ones you want), it's no problem for a duper.
---
It's really obnoxious when this happens.  I remember the first couple times I did the Queen battle, it was a struggle and *fun*.  The next several times, she was dead before I even fast traveled there.  Well, I hope they had fun, I guess.  It's the same thing when you go an Event that you know is reasonably difficult, and some schmuck with a TSE comes in and one-shots everything before you can even stab it.  I'm sorry I got in the way of your grinding routine. 😒
---
Trust me I know I'd just rather play it as a fallout game not rust. It was always an option before if you wanted "hardcore mode" and I'll play it like, I'm not gonna stop playing the game, I was just saying there is enough already eating up random amounts of time in this game that really dont add much to the exp except to take away. I dont need to add more. Game would be much better if they just reduced the drain rate at which your food left your body. Of course you can always get dysentery and just kiss your water supply goodbye. 
---
They're used in most weapon and armour crafting and repairing, am guessing you've managed to avoid doing these things? If you want to learn mods for a rare weapon then crafting and scrapping them is the best way to do it but eats through screws like nobody's business
---
Im almost completely sure its rather the shot being handled as a simple hipfire one. I did quite a lot of testing, and its 100% reproduceable. No matter how clear the shot, how far away you are; if you've started the charge before VATS, or before it zooms in, the bullet will go straight to the middle of your screen. I've literally waited a MINUTE on a fully charged 95% shot standing right beside a completely stationary super mutant, without the percentage moving even 1 point. The shot still acted like a hip-fire, and missed.
---
Im guessing the problem is the same with the other guns as well, but since those are insta fire its less noticeable. The only reason these shots CAN hit is because VATS centers you screen on the target the moment you initiate it. You can also abuse this to actually pretty much always hit if you're fast enough, and the target isnt that far away.
---
I wouldn't say the damage was ever really bad, the ammo crafting for it though is a joke. While I cant directly comment on a default flamer, my Furious Flamer melts all targets and excels at horde control. Flamer meta will be upon us soon for vault raids though. 
---
Damn that's weird. Yesterday was the smoothest it's ever been for me since launch (PC).
---
Correct.  You can both start doing full damage. But be warned, it works anywhere and it is for the whole team. 
---
You can get the bathrobe at one of the Whitespring Resort vendors.
---
Junk, water, radx and radaway, stimpaks, ammo... all these things add up fast and you're running around bloated.
---
drop all ammo you don't use
---
There's been no patch notes for any patches that haven't been released though.
---
Can't see the patch notes for next weeks patch on there.

I was crashing trying to walk into Grafton all the time.  Maybe because of all the mutants it tries to draw in on the other side of the shed (even though they are out of sight) between the train station and the town vendor, combined with the HUD bug were just too much.  Since taking the HUD off I've had multi-hour sessions with no lockups and no issues in Grafton. 
---
Which is something I guess.  HUD isnt the only issue out there, but it is one.
---
I've got a bloody explosive gatling and I mow down everything and the ammo consumed is low.
---
But most of the other heavy weps while fun just chew waaay too much ammo like you said.  My gatling laser broke within 1200 shots or something.  They need to buff the other guns and fix ammo availability rather than nerf the best heavy wep.
---
I'll actually pvp a lot more not having to worry about being one shot
---
Hi, yesterday i got disconnected from the server every time i tried to enter a world before i was even able to move after the loading screen, i tried for at least 30 minutes before giving up. Can it be related to the fact that i was entering a world with my character already inside my excavator power armor or that i was carrying around 350 weight? Btw your post about all the bugs is very helpful, great job 👍 
---
It doesn't ever go away either. It also generally affects your entire foundation. 
---
I tore mine down to the foundation, moved my CAMP  an inch, and deleted the blue print. Rebuilt everything after, and noticed the same thing had happened again.
---
Best to bulk it and sell it rather than drop it. At least every couple of days I have a big junk clear out and that's been the main source of caps for me in the game
---
I hear you. I just simply maxed out my Weapons Artisan, Fix it Good, Power Patcher and put points on Gunsmith to combat this issue.
---
that screws with me while triggering me
---
You can absolutely have both. There could be a hub at Fort Defiance or the bunker. It makes sense lore wise too. Factions within this universe have always created safe zones but the current F076 build prevents us from doing that other than at a few workshops in each play session. I could understand why they wouldn’t have this at launch because we are retaking Appalachia but it shouldn’t remain that way indefinitely otherwise the game world remains the exact same no matter how long you play. At the very least could have faction control points like ESO where we fight to maintain control of an area or settlement. 
---
Guessing this is a console issue. Haven't seen it on PC myself.
---
no..... so chally where was I fried meat squishy meat gooey meat (walks off into the distance) 
---
honestly I'd love pets that had some significance if I see someone walk up and he has a dog dressed as a raider I'm going to treat him as a raider if I see a responder walk up I'm treating him like that if I see someone walking down the road in excavator armor with a pack animal I'm going ohh that guys a merchant and walking up to him and asking him what he is selling 
---
Holiday tapes were great in Far Harbor.  In 76 they are too long and filled with boring survivor stories...from dead people.  So not really survivors 🤷
---
I think it opens up a whole new level. I wouldn't mind lugging a sleeping bag around, we already have plans for them. Along the same lines, let us set up cooking fires so we can cook on the fly. And weapon/armor repair kits!!!!
---
Land sharks!
---
I really like the Mad Dog Malone events personally. Fighting his gang off at the prison...Trying to capture him alive at the Grafton dam. Sounds easy until you realize all the doors at locked at level three. I had to use the secret entrance from one of the drain pipes and fight my way up to him.
---
Cheat their way to end game. Gets endless caps/gear. Then grief other players because the game is not fun for them. They cant play overwatch because they get pawned of an even field and cant work with others because Cunt bags are like that lol
---
Someone with sentinel armor and dozens of stacked bobbleheads will still kick your ass in PvP, just so you are aware. 
---
Ah, Np, and I'm not trying to be rude / aggressive, just trying to keep things constructive and on task.
---
If they are actively claiming it, no. Be sure to take pacifist off.
---
One tactic I've run into lately is that they will be timing the takeover with a friend.  The friend will blast you with a TSE the second they start the claim process. 
---
Nah ignorant was DoNt SpEnD pErK pOintS cause you know its beneficial and they made it so you virtually need to in this game lol. I can go mash collect button and boil 80 waters. Again it's just an annoying time sink/micro management that doesnt do anything for you. They could find another way to give you the well fed bonus. I never remember having to rely on food and water from my inventory unless it was for health.
---
id take a skateboard at this point!
---
Thinking about it, keep ya motorbikes and car, i want roller blades to go with my jet pack mods now damnit!
---
I no longer have a problem with super mutants wielding miniguns. I discovered if you run up to them and get right up in their faces, they don't know what to do and stop firing. They try to slowly back away, but as long as you stick with them you can take em out with zero resistance. Unless of course their hunting-rifle toting buddies are nearby.
---
t60 motion assist servos?
---
There are Yao-Guai, which are radiated bears.
---
Miniguns have needed innate armor piercing in every Fallout game since 3. I’d go earlier but I have not played those extensively. Guess what Fallout NV ended up doing? Yup, gave miniguns innate armor piercing.
---
Even with full Stabilized, miniguns tickle enemies. You just can’t get around the issue of low damage per bullet = bad performance against higher damage resistance. And all high level enemies have enough DR to make it bad.
---
I’d say they could either give miniguns some innate armor piercing, or code it so it “shoots” slower but each “shot” is 5 bullets with the damage of five of the single bullets now. So that’s 15 base to 75 base. Much better. Same animation, just change the way it applies damage. It’s janky but it’ll work.
---
Didn’t work for me, inside mines or some huge buildings like the prison it’s stutters aloooot but my fps are stable? I don’t get it,.. do you use razer mouse by chance?
---
I was thinking she must be saitama’s sister or something.
---
Supposedly it doesn't spawn all the time though? Only recently did I decide I wanted to pick it up for a character.
---
They are obviously scaling down server resources, or the game is getting worse performance wise.
---
I'm fine with how it works prior to 50 because you end up alternating every 5 levels or so.  But, imo, all weapons and armors should have a Lv. 50 version even if they have a Lv. 45.
---
Don't need three weapons. One melee (machete is awesome at the early levels) and one rifle/pistol. I don't mess with the 10mm's , low damage -- pipes are great because they are plentiful and rapid-fire for distance shots. Scrap all the rest for the mads. Light armor (leather) with pockets as soon as possible. Don't repair - just scrap. Cheaper and easier to make new and you'll get experience points. 
---
I killed him through the window, i didn't even need to go inside the building xD
---
There is an issue with the hats, uniforms will still work properly
---
I'm still holding out hope energy weapons make a comeback. But I gotta say I have a Furious Tesla and it's pretty dope.
---
Gilligan thought it was the bee's knees!
---
not really since you would still need to farm the weapons for the parts to make new ones or at least have to farm something similar like a quest to find the plans and other things 
---
I'm also not saying remove totally the legends in the game as is I'm saying let people do both let crafters actually be able to craft end game items just as much as letting a player who wants to solo it let him do that to you don't have to remove one play style to add more depth to the game
---
also thats only the current end game what will the end game look like this time next year is what I'm thinking of or in 2-3 years 
---
YUP
---
This is interesting, someone else said if you add the hip fire upgrades vs recoil they've gotten steady hits in VATS.   
---
Since you've invested some time in troubleshooting would you be willing to swap some mods to hip fire bonuses and test / report?
---
What you're asking for is a gundam. I wouldn't mind though.
---
Indeed, and I upvote every time.
---
I like the idea of bobble heads as a component thats pretty cool idea 
---
Tell that to Clayton! Senior citizen of doom! "GET OFF MY LAWN!" (lets bullets rip from his automatic rifle.)
---
Some creatures carry it around 
---
 It's near the bordering wall of Whitesprings next to a few large trees not far from the road. 
---
Ghouls 
---
Oh man oh man what a wonderful twist this would be. It would even allow you to do crazy shit that ignores established lore.
---
Everything should have the same potential max level, otherwise the game is just ensuring that some items won't be used.  I personally think it's just an oversight that some stuff ends at 45 for no apparent reason, but even if it's intentional as some sort of balancing or design consideration then haha nothing is balanced around here.
---
Glowing enemies mainly. Some locations also have it to collect. 
---
mole miners
---
I totally get why they made these things a rarity, but the reliance on screws and springs definitely seems out of balance to me. This is an improvement I would definitely like to see. Would give me a reason to pick up guns I don't need to scrap for mods anymore, aside from for selling them which is often weight/ caps inefficient
---
Thanks man
---
Going by this analogy, shooting monsters is nothing more than bashing the buttons 80 times.  I think many players play this game not just to shoot things around, but role playing with it.
---
Welcome to the party, been doing it for weeks, lots of useless legendaries though and 1 star drops from 3 star legendaries same as other places though..... :-)
---
Definitely gotten plenty from nuke zones. I'd recommend farming those for nuclear material. 
---
Anywhere? The whole workshop area or really, anywhere?
---
Ghouls drop every kind of junk/ammo. Their variety of loot is huge
---
Drop a nuke at white springs and farm it off the glowing ones.
---
I only find it easy if the Radtoads make an appearance. My character is a melee build and its really difficult to hit those little fireflies!
---
just make the teddys unlock a decoration when in your inv that has the component cost of 1 teddy bear of that kind
---
Missiles, flamer fuel, the grenade launcher ammo as well always seem to sneak into my inventory :/
---
It's the other quests and event's as well we can't always see what were being rewarded for doing them because the text doesn't stay on screen long enough and if its more than 3 items it scrolls off the bottom of the text box.
---
Again a simple feature that someone that played the game would have caught. Not sure why Bethesda don't test this stuff out or even bother to play there own game :/
---
....deflector shield 
---
Aid is a problem, especially stealth boys, some junk weighs a lot (most are less than a pound but a few are more) some ammo including, but not limited to fusion cores, missiles, mini-nukes take up a lot of weight. Also, alcohol usually weighs like .7 of a pound making it kinda heavy so drink those before water, and they also give a boost to to SPECIALS. if none of that helps get power armor chassis. They give you +6 in strength without armor on it and only have like 2-3 almost fully charged fusion cores on you to not take up much weight since they are 3 pounds each.
---
Wow, really? Like I said, you don't need the points. Not trying to be a dick here, but honestly try not using the perks. It's still easy to manage and there are better places to use the cards
---
Not after this guy told everyone where the type writers are :P
---
Got one from Census Violence and AWOL yesterday.
---
That castle bed is awesome in its ridiculousness!
---
Has anyone found a way to get a full set if you didn't get for completing it? Because I didn't get a chassis or anything.
---
That's basically what OP is saying. OP is Just wondering why.
---
Awesome! I like your thinking. A bit like Red Dead 2 where you can set nightly camps.
---
Where is that?
---
Hoping for big content once they fix some server stability, put a squash to the dupe for good, and make proper balance changes. Maybe they have these things in the works just dont want to release during the extended beta we have now. I will say I do appreciate what they have fixed. Bethesda gets a lot of flak, for good reason on some, but the fact that it still is fallout online for the first time ever is a great feat. I too just wish they had more end game content to start. I think they need to add dungeon or wave type arenas that you pay caps to get into and get guaranteed 3* items from if you survive. I also would love to see a legendary global vendor who's content changes weekly and can be obtained through purchase of special vouchers from either caps or trading in unwanted legendaries. Keep the vouchers on the vendor though so they have no way to be duped. Gives honest players another way to get items they want and both give everyone another use for caps. They could make some really cool changes or additions that wouldn't take away from fallout but would make it feel like what it is supposed to be. 
---
I believe Vanguard had that option. Nice touch, people would buy my stuff then find me and ask for more items. Was nice advertising for a crafter.
---
nuke stuff, but also: wakemaster alarm clocks, blast radius board games (and rad poker i think), biometric scanners and high powered magnets, and ALWAYS check the little red canisters to see if its volatile materials.
---
There is a bunch of canisters in nuka cola plant.
---
Not for me, I've had better luck the last 2 days though. Lots of 2 and 3 stars aswell
---
"YOUR MOTHER WAS A BAT AND YOUR FATHER SMELLS OF COCKROACHES!"
---
I had trouble while on my shotgun build. The windows let grenades in...but super mutants are smart enough to avoid them sometimes. Mad Dog certainly knows. Haha
---
I like about half the stuff in the Atom Shop. There are some things that aren't my cup of tea, but they don't bother me.  
---
Nice place near Monagah. Lead node and iron ore deposits. Near a spawn but it's super reliable. Kill the 3 things first  when you travel back good to go.
---
Certain "Ammo" types like Fusion Cores, Missiles and Mini-Nukes are common hidden sources of weight.  Gunpowder and Raw Asbestos have a tendency to add up as well.
---
You can always see in your Junk tab what an item will break down to.  Some items are more efficient sources of parts than others.
---
What was removed?
---
I'm a level 120 and I've never had anyone wreck my camp.
---
I've always hated the PvP aspect of this game but the fact that lower level players are the only ones being harassing is infuriating.
---
It's gotta be bad enough being low level and having other players spawn insanely high level enemies for you but now they also need to deal with being harrassed by higher level players.
---
I really hope Bethesda separate PvP from PvE soon because they'll never get enough new players to stick around like this.
---
I've left for work but will be on tonight, I typically get on from around 6-11EST during the week and all day/night on weekends
---
I have pc
---
Yes.
---
I mean it would be a nice change of things.... But have you noticed how easy they blow up ... 
---
Video? 
---
I was running along a couple of weeks ago when a mothboi appeared in front of me and scared me half to death, then he disappeared again!
---
I haven't tested it personally because I don't own a cav set, but from what can tell if you stagger during sprint you aren't sprinting  because your character stops moving for a second, so I'd assume the cav effect would turn off during that period. The one that's better depends on playstyle and situations there is alot of room for outplaying people with both.   
---
Grahm is that you?
---
I will ride a damn Brahim cow lol.
---
But if this was real, people would laugh at the idiot walking miles and miles. 
---
"Dude why are you walking?"
---
"Well I don't have no car"
---
"But you just made a laser gun from scrap."
---
"Yes but I just can't get the peddles on that bike"
---
Ha! I never visited the place with my first endgame character neither.  
---
The event is fairly easy even though it's on time. Collect 50 lumi and put them into the beacon. Bugs gives you 1 lumi, toads will give you two.
---
legendaries do not always respawn as legendary.  I've been in watoga way too many times to prove that wrong.  You can shoot a robot and a few moments later a new one will be spawning out of the closest tube.  I've killed a legendary and watched a normal spawn back out.  I've killed a normal and watched a legendary spawn.
---
The reason people nuke whitesprings for ghouls is ghouls spawn more enemies per spawn point than any other enemy.  And being legendary is just a random % chance per spawn.  So more spawns = more legendaries.
---
Sell a casual game to a casual audience with little investment in what Fallout is and you'll get casual suggestions hit the front page.
---
Bruuuuhhh
---
You said it was in patch notes, that's NOT patch notes. That's a comment about stuff they want to add waaaay in the future.
---
Patch notes are a list that shows whats in the latest patch. 
---
Same here. Just the HUD? Thought my xo1 was bugged. Ill Have to try changing the helmet.
---
I’ve moved mine because almost every time I load in someone has already built one there and I can’t spawn my camp. 
---
Happy to help, thanks for the feedback and reposting here! :).  
---
To be honest I don't know, I am constantly over-encumbered in my PA, and will Occasionally have long load times, but rarely fail to load in.  
---
That said there have been allot of reports of issues with the Excavator PA and it reporting the weight properly.  
---
Some basic questions:  
---
-Console or PC?  
---
-Wifi or Wired connection?  
---
-Do you have the same long load times when out of PowerArmor?  
---
-Any odd effects on your player character? (Multiple diseases etc.)
---
Oh dude look at YouTube, cause you have to do some steps to get in the Bunker where it is :) 
---
Sure. So its hip-fire, or recoil? Or both?
---
Set up camp at a uranium deposit.
---
In my experience it spawns pretty frequently. I think maybe once or twice it didn't show up. I remember seeing it for the first time and buying it immediately thinking it was super rare but every time I went back (which is a lot) it was there. Maybe that's just me though.
---
Yup I've been doing this for a while. I've not had a 3 star drop from Whitesprings since the update and people are too selfish to share. 
---
Overall Watoga is the place to be imo.
---
Happens on Xbox as well.
---
I hang around in watoga aswell for legendaries.  Been hanging in Whitesprings and didnt encounter much legendaries tbh. Or to many ppl hanging at whitesprings 
---
frogs (the critters not the mobs) can have 2 uranium ore one them. also scarpping the nuclear board game gives it, and dont toy rocketships have nuclear waste or was that changed from 4?
---
They do that. It's startling af.
---
Sharing is caring. 
---
Oh god... the missiles... we call dropping those missiles the final step to completing a nuke launch.
---
ORC CAMP
---
THIS GAME REALLY IS JUST A REALLY BOOTLEG SKYRIM ISNT IT NOW
---
Exploring one day, I discovered a bit of ground that wasn't ground. Instead of grass it was BSOD. I took a screenshot and will upload when I get home tonight. That's when I started looking deeper. Clues are everywhere.
---
Thanks for the reply - any word on why these are never on the same day or why theyre so vague?  
---
I get excited to hear about new content information, then have to wait a day or two just to get a "were working on stuff we wont talk about that will be out eventually"
---
I've tested this the last 2 days and for me when a legendary robot came out of one of those machines, it respawned a legendary everytime for me. 
---
But, for that time, for that single swing... you'll be a god among mortals
---
Have a fishy stick!
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/yJRC0tu 
---
It feels like it's getting worse. Just doing the most trivial things in the game bugs everything out. Vendors are unresponsive at times, I've gotten stuck in the work bench by simply bulking my items, the damn quantity scroller is a pain in the ass and I still have issues in a group when after zoning me or my teammate are invisible. 
---
Its food for stocking up on fusion cores also, 3 armour spawns within 100m of each other, fusion generator and loose core in Watoga medical, lots of Stims also...cool place for sure..
---
I always thought the same thing since the brotherhood, enclave, and NCR all have vertabirds and the boomers have there plane.
---
Aviation is possible but not ground transport. Although the NCR also have the train thing. 
---
But there is a random event in 4 where a group of gunners are defending a pre-war tank that's clearly getting fixed.
---
I'd just like to be able to recharge a few I have so I don't end up with 15 cores with different charges so they don't stack.
---
I can make it strong. I mean I can make a power armor. All it needs is some wheels. 
---
Fallout was a mature themed post-nuclear RPG adventure.  Fallout 2 was dark, for certain, but chocked full of popular-culture references.  Fallout 3 did many things wrong - but credit where it's due, they did add to the Fallout universe.  Skipping ahead, the attrocities of FO76 are the butchery of the timeline, absolutely magnified by the terrible writing.  The flimsy and pathetic writing used to include super mutants, BoS, etc.  Are laughable, if they weren't so sad.
---
Can't seem to find the comment again but it was basically one the of the laser turrets in the beginning could be melee/VATS to pop behind the wall.
---
hopefully it has some actual info this time instead of the usual "were working on stuff that will come out eventually"
---
And pencils for lead
---
"Safe Vehicle"...
---
One bullet and everything in this game explodes into a mini nuke... I dont think there are any safe vehicles...
---
Remember to say it with a low coarse voice.
---
How is it challenging with all the disadvantages given to wanted players that I mentioned? You know exactly where the wanted player is, you can get right in his face and take almost no damage and buff/stim up, then wait until you have your best close range headshot lined up before combat actually begins. Hell, you can stand in one place, eat a sandwhich with one hand, and lob a grenade or a fat man with the other, and there isn't a damn thing he can do about it except log off.
---
That was very casual of you to say. 
---
Yup, just swapped out my helmet.  I'm currently running my T60 armor.
---
Having a vehicle would be great, think about having a vehicle workbench where u can mod them. Adding guns or armor to it. 
---
Thats so odd I am using a combat rifle. I got 15 luck +luck from raider underarmor but Thats weird.
---
If you just need a little bit of it, the mole miners and the locations they're in - around Welch and the mines there - often have it. Brooms or mops - can't remember which off the top of my head - also have it. 
---
VATS is your best friend there.  I mainly use melee as well and using VATS once you get close enough allows you to hit them no problem.  Even teleports you a little bit if they get too high to hit them normally.
---
I’ve said the same thing but people think I’m wrong. People on this sub just don’t get how game development works. It’s not easy to address what everyone wants...
---
Best I can do is 800 something (can't remember the exact amount) currently as that's all the caps I have. But if you're willing to do that then yeah I'd love to
---
So I know I'm not crazy now because someone mentioned it in this thread, but scrapper used to give rare mats when weapons and armor were broken down.
---
All I want is a two-handed sword. 
---
Yup
---
Also, I've noticed since I  keep moving my stuff around I'm always losing my components for locks. So I started just making them all level 0 with a turret near by so if anyone tries picking it they'll just get gunned down. Side note: I only have 1 locked door behind a restricted area sign just as a test for people. A LOT of newbies try to pick anything they can, they really do not understand. I've had to run up and unlock it for them so they don't get wanted and then killed lol.
---
I took 2 new players to montonga to power it up, that was fun for them. I then took them to the public workshop and we did that together they had fun, it wasnt fun for me because i got like 30 caps and 1 stim pack from the whole thing. 
---
i did have fun cause they were having fun, they got 100 caps and like 2 stim packs and some radx. 
---
Came here to say this.
---
Everyone in an online game is male until proven otherwise.
---
I would do that leave and come back and some sick bastard had dragged it out and put it back.
---
Thank god someone said it. Between the fucking youtubers and haters... Comedy always gets an upvote from me. 
---
Lol hell yes! Click brrrrrrrrrrrr whoooohoooooo!!.
---
We can race eachother and actually have some fun with random encounters instead of trying to make them clear you dropped a gift for 15 minutes. You just do clock out them heelys and they will know what's up.
---
This is a great wishlist, much better than I was thinking, it should definitely be in the open world but protected by robots or something. They could even have an event for it called protect the settlement from ________ where we have to fix turrets and stuff or protect it from scorchbeasts. 
---
I usually use VATS if I'm fighting a flying enemy or in a crowded area where I don't want to hit another player.  Really helpful in some situations.  Glad I could help.
---
Maybe he likes to dress up, it’s cool I don’t judge.
---
I like how you call him a piece of shit at the end. Clearly u mad bro :P
---
Yea, I know. I find it hard to find info. on anything as well. If you're on Xbox I can go look and pick one up for you. I don't mind.
---
Interesting... I've done the same quite a bit and never experienced it.
---
Yet, at the same time, I ran through an unnuked whitesprings one day and EVERY SINGLE ghoul dropped a legendary item.  weird stuff happens I guess.
---
Yep. I think it also visaully highlighted items that scrapped for the rare mats you were searching for (I think). 
---
No idea why the nerfed it for 76. I guess to force us to grind for rare mats by killing bears....
---
Along with McClintock it's basically Springhalla
---
yup
---
You drive a hard bargain but that sounds good :)
---
Ill PM you
---
It's a cool item for sure but I'm mildy salty Bethesda's charging us for reused fo4 assets. IMO, any old / already existing items should already be in the world of fo76.
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again in case anyone in Bethesda is reading... **The Atomic Shop should be a place where the developers should have fun and get creative. It should NOT be a place to sell recycled fo4 assets.** I mean cmon that's so dirty. :/
---
I'm gonna move my camp there and make sure it's visible, except I'll only build a flamingo somewhere you can't see.
---
It would be interesting in pvp.  For example if someone tries to run u over you cant be harmed with PA and like i read before vehicles explode pretty fast.   But it would be awesome to have a bike and drive around on the roads while being chased by a scorchbeast. 
---
I want so bad to repair a bike and ride it around like I'm leaving Pallet Town
---
Build over any fissure.
---
Yesterday I had a ghoul that dropped 2 legendaries!
---
When he respawned, he dropped 2 again. First time I've seen this lol
---
Try the area to the east of whitesprings. There is a little two or so house town by Solomons lake, is usually where I check for PA, not many people look there I think. Had the same issue looking for a left arm
---
Does scrapping weapons you've made actually unlock plans? I scrapped a few of mind but didn't get anything. Was I just unlucky?
---
I built my base at the Rusty Pick. A known nuke waste spawns there along with a pack of high level mutants and power armor.
---
Are they... ill-tempered?
---
Agreed! I don't even own any firearms but I love learning about them.
---
Dude, that's so cool.
---
PA, Heely's, Cryolater and fatman in hand
---
Heelys &gt; £6 mullet hair style on atom store!
---
Make it so Bethesda!!!
---
Not a dumb question, as other items do not stack.  Hard to keep track of it all.
---
Anything glowing has a higher chance to drop it. 
---
Sounds good
---
Because you can increase and stabilize framerate significantly with all of the particle effects turned on  
---
I have a 1080ti paired with a 750ti and the 750ti hits 20% utilization regularly
---
But I agree that if a 3* comes out of one of those spawning machines, it's not for sure that it will be a 3* again... but it was at least a 1* legendary for me every time
---
Why don't we just turn it into a fantasy dragon MMO?
---
I think the furious weapons reset every time you miss. So as soon as one bullet misses, you're back to base damage. With a .60 cal or any automatic weapon with poor recoil, you're more likely to miss before you do any real damage and reset the counter. 
---
Well, I dont use non-PA armor and I guess gauss, lever, handmade, tesla are the only weapons needed to be crafted for mod scraping, but I dont have any legendaries of these kind, so not using these currently and thus no need for mods
---
&gt; I was so ashamed I scrapped the mirror from my camp because I could not even look at myself.
---
That got a good chuckle out of me.
---
Good thing I have a flamingo Slayer tire iron with +40 damage when not moving and two shot explosive.
---
lol instant kharma!

It's shop.  If it doesn't make money then it's a bad shop.  It has been designed to make money and this isn't bad, its just reusing fallout 4 assets is lazy.  As for events?  I see many fallout 4 assets in the atom store that aren't available in game.  Like 250 atoms for the lucky tattoo.  Come on that's just bullshit for something that was FREE in fallout 4. 
---
I've got 500 hours in this game now.  I know how atom generation works and I can tell you the well soon dries up with a few purchases.  To add further insult there are many challenges that are currently bugged and do not work properly.  
---
I'd happily spend lots of money on items if they were better priced and not just copy pasted in from a game I've already bought.  In rainbow six alone I've spent $450 on cosmetics and dlc.  $5 for a hat or $12 for a suit I got for free in the last game?  No chance.
---
I don't know, whitesprings is the player hub at the moment and it is in the middle of the map and has everything you need. I think a 2nd player hub would be kinda dumb.
---
I completely agree. The sad thing is if they got creative with it, it could make for a thrilling PvP element in a game that desperately needs it. It seems like it would take relatively little work to implement, just some brainstorming. 
---
Maybe bounty hunter is a role you can play, but to accept it, you have to enable PvP mode, which means being able to get shot first; or, maybe they enable PvP mode when you get within a certain proximity of a wanted player. Maybe they add the "last seen in" feature that I mentioned instead of a blinking red bulls-eye on the map, even when the player is crouching/hiding. 
---
It would be awesome if "Wanted" posters went up with the player's self-taken picture on them (the one that the player takes when they create a character), and more and more of them went up as the bounty increases. Or if the player can hide in Free States territory, and anti-government bots protect him. There's just so much potential for it! And it would actually make a reason for PvP.
---
I still cant  believe they havn't buffed laser rifles durability yet, it has to be a stupid easy fix and there is no way they can think it breaking after 2 enemies is ok 
---
That's toxic.
---
It's hard to believe that in the era we live in that Bethesda allows this kind of gameplay to go unchecked. There is no option to opt out for those who don't want it.
---
They had one group that was following a player around using homophobic slurs and they banned those players and shut off proximity chat but basically the same crap is still going on just without the microphone and racial slurs.
---
plug in a second card, enable it as a dedicated physx card in the control panel.  watch game run better.
---
I play on Ps4 with wired connection, the load time was more or less the same as the other days but i might be wrong because i was very upset and my time perception might have been a little compromised lol.
---
My character has one mutation and maybe one desease.
---
I apologise to all the people that potentially crashed because of me and also for my english (not a native speaker)
---
That will be $149.99 please
---
As the others have said, probably only need one ranged weapon and one melee weapon - quick switch between them based on enemy type and distance. If you come across a second, decent ranged weapon, it can be worth keeping in your stash, just in case you're short on repair supplies at some point for your main weapon.  
---
I'll go through stretches where I don't use stimpacks for days, and then, I'm popping like 10 of them in 30 minutes. So, I'd recommend holding on them if at all possible. You can probably cap your Radaways at around 30, and your Rad-X around 10. (And even those numbers are conservative on my part, probably.) I usually sell all of the non-perishable aid - Nuka Cola, Blamco Mac and Cheese, etc. - to vendors. There is so much "fresh" food in the game, which you get EXP for crafting and has better benefits to your character, than all of the packaged stuff. 
---
When it comes to junk, I bulk everything - it's easier to keep tabs on it that way, and to sell it to vendors. I usually sell any bulk past 5 back to vendors. (i.e. If I have 15 bulk wood, I'll sell 10 to a vendor.) Screws and springs are the only "common" junk that you don't ever want to sell - they're needed in pretty much all of the endgame weapons and power armor.
---
A big part of the premise of the Fallout series is a war predicated on the end of fuel resources right? I’m just not confident fusion cores are powerful enough to power much more than an e-bike. Maybe I’m wrong there. But with no other fuel sources made I have doubts. 
---
I really hate this particular mechanic.  Congratulations, you completed a quest.  Here's a *27 pound Flamer*.  Dumped into your inventory after a long quest where you've probably been looting and gathering stuff anyway.  What, you didn't have 27 pounds of free space?  Too bad!
---
It's like they needed to have a kind of buffer inventory like Borderlands has, where you temporarily exceed your gun limit.  It's a one-way thing - you can't do anything with an item in the buffer except pull it out, and once you do, it can't go back.  The trick would be finding a way to do that which isn't exploitable.
---
Have fully modded t51b PA with nuka paint already on it. If want to trade something I need..  Took weeks to assemble the 3 sets I have. But I dont use the one avatar anymore.   Willing to part with it if got something good.  Weight less armor with chem reduction  or 3* 2h melee.
---
Even melee players tend to block the doors meaning you don't get hits in most of the time. there's always that one guy with a super sledge who 1 hits the legendary before anyone has a chance to tag it.
---
If you kill SBQ a lot, you'll end up with so many ultracite explosive vent plans
---
Which is why beam katanas are better
---
1st off shame on you from taking them out of their natural habitats.  The bears just wanna live their lives and have parties and go hot tubbing.  But not only did you force them into captivity, you then tired of them and killed them!  The wasteland has made you far too cruel.  You don't deserve the bears company anymore.
---
Been playing since Black Fri, only seen Grahm twice and his stock was a huge let down
---
Where you wanted? Or did he just have an OP weapon?
---
This should be at the top of there list of fixes / changes.
---
Plans being level locked (would be ok with this if they told us what levels etc), Named wrong on vendors, not being able to see which plans we already know and which ones we don't, Helmets and hats not showing up etc.
---
It's not even funny how broken it is and its a huge part of the game. Whats funny is Bethesda haven't even acknowledged it :(
---
I looked all over the map, kept jumping servers and going in circles for weeks :(
---
Wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes
---
Even if it was for just one day?
---
Wouldn't it be good if we could wish ourselves away?
---
Wouldn't it be good to be on your side?
---
The grass is always greener over there
---
Wouldn't it be good if we could live without a care?

Grabs repair perks in luck
---
Hi everyone, thank you for reporting this to us, and I'm sorry about any frustrations this is causing you. The dev team is aware of this issue and they are actively investigating. 
---
In the meantime, if this is happening to you consistently, can you please shoot me a private message with the following details?:
---
* Your Bethesda.net account name
---
* The email address associated with your Bethesda.net account
---
* The platform you're playing on (Xbox One, PlayStation 4, or PC)
---
I don't use this perk so it doesn't effect me.
---
But you do realize that every time you keep bringing this up, there's more chance that they'll fix it right?
---
Remember Fusion Cores recharging when you logged?  Gone now.
---
How about you don't keep bringing up a bug that people like? 
---
Stack a bunch of your friends, equip Lazer rifles &amp; fatmans. Mutate everyone heavily and have someone equip a shishkabob, boom makeshift liberty prime
---
This would be really cool. I like the robot one
---
I don’t have much to offer so I’ll keep looking and maybe someone will have just the leg. Thanks tho 👍🏻
---
Go to Mama Dolce's.  Turn South West and enter the booby trapped barn.
---
That Power Armor spawns T45, 51b, and 60 armors.  It is a low level area and it is very quick to server hop to.  You'll have a full set of all three in no time.
---
Oh good! I'm not hte only one that got attacked by one of these but couldn't fight back!  
---
Its like you have to kill each and every single bee in the swarm.. 
---
Won't be on for hours 8 hours or so.  But I have about 2k.  Got anything good to trade.  Dont need caps.
---
Oh yeah, didn't mean for that to be judgemental.  Anyone can be who they wanna be... It's just generally a safe assumption
---
Yeah last night I got stuck on my power armor station with the repair screen not appearing.  Had to get a friend to kill me then respawned doing the fix animation.  Went back and still bugged out.  
---
Had to restart my game 2 times before it registered.  I've also noticed just 1 nuke will degrade a servers performance by over half.  Causing items to load slow and event completion screens to not load until 5 minutes after the fact.
---
After the patch the servers were buttery smooth.   Which implies they up the resources for better performance in case something goes wrong.  Then decrease those resources after.  I get they need to load balance and also for costs.  But when it affects game performance for their players... They need to rethink this strategy. 
---
That's a good thought. We'll be renaming ourselves lol
---
Fair enough. Crafting and repairing PA still costs screws though so maybe hold on to some!
---
I've always loved the power up missions
---
You’d think! I can’t even tell you how many times I visited that place. Anytime I get T51b to spawn it only has the parts I already found... so frustrating!
---
Ironically players putting camps there does not stop the vendor bot from spawning because i put a camp there on a low level alt and the vendor bot has been there twice. 
---
Go to the Burning Mine.
---
Check uphill.  Kill the enemies.  There's a PA spawn up there.
---
Check downhill just inside the mine entrance.  You can just run past the enemies and get in.  There's a PA spawn there.
---
If you don't find parts you need, relog.  Every server has a chance to repawn in both locations.
---
Fastest PA farming spot I've found.
---
Hope that helps!
---
DITTO.
---
Gogo fallout rangers!!!
---
Yes, I agree with everything you've said here
---
Mole Miners drop it like candy :)
---
Go do the Uranium Fever event.
---
Scrap for mods 
---
I'm ready, got some gear for him!  [Dog Helmet](https://imgur.com/a/eEO0gyR)
---
Agreed. I never fucking sleep sooo it'd glad do it. 
---
That sounds interesting indeed. I was a little hesitant about the vehicles in pvp because of how pubg struggled with that. Blackout seems to do a good job with it though so there must be a solution. 
---
It’s all fun and games until you have to drink more water than an Olympic power lifter.
---
only to learn mods for the weapons/armor
---
I scrap them
---
Belching Betty is also an easy spot if you have uncovered it from the Firebreathers missions.  It tends to have 51b and 60.
---
Those two spawn locations are right next to power armor so very little travel time.
---
He didn't know the gun was loaded...
---
Nowhere near doing this yet, but its the same for most quests - Congrats you completed the quest/event/whatever  
---
Have all this really have stuff and oh - heres a horde of &lt;insert creature here&gt; for yo uto fight whils you can't run!
---
Actually corpses don't count as hits, it only affects living targets for durability loss. I've shot a corpse up to test this and no durability loss on my minigun.
---
Yeo, definitely need robot guards of some sort.  They could add those surface to air missiles or aa guns you see around the power plants for the attacks.  
---
I haven’t noticed that happening. Last night I didn’t even get to the ‘world found’ point it just had the vault tec logo but I didn’t notice it fluctuating in speed. 
---
If it's deliberate, then they broke continuity with the story that's on a holotape found in that very same clubhouse.
---
GG BGS
---
Agreed on the high level design.
---
Implementation seems straight forward. 
---
The bus outside of the amusement park with "MAGIC" spelled out. Maybe it's my age but I thought it was in reference to the Who song, Magic Bus.

I've got it, half life with a tse shotgun

Yes it does. That's how I've got nearly all the options for gauss rifles.

 The we can add Godzilla to the game. Plz happen.
---
Marine Armor
---
This. I am honestly so worried about the opposite happening and everything just being thrown in the store..
---
I need to figure out how to get screenshots off my PS4, but I was taking pictures with the friendly mothman and I got one just as he was despawning, so he's all ghostly and translucent. 
---
Lmao, its something that doesnt work like intended. 
---
like duping? many people were a fan of duping. so why report it
---
Sadly I am on PS4, but I appreciate the offer!
---
Thats most likely because some one else already looted it from that server. it only spawns 1 on each spin up. thelast time i took some one in there i happen to see one spawn and i snatched it (i already have two).
---
Even if the base goes from the rail to the water?
---
It definitely seems worse for me but only \*sometimes\*. I crashed liked 5-6 times in 30 minutes in one session, took a break, started a new toon and didn't crash at all in more than an hour of gameplay.
---
Been there too. I honestly have zero luck with finding it myself, hence the post ☹️
---
I did something like that aswell. I hopped 4 times from server to server and it said. Your camp could not be placed when i log on. My camp is always near the trainstation at top of the world. Then the 5th time i got the same message. So i was tired to hop servers again and wasting time with loading so i explored around the area to  find another players camp. And there it was..  Doors locked, junk extractor locked.  So i took out my TSE gatling gun. Destroyed the wooden wall with locked door and went inside towards the tinker workbench. I crafted some more 5mm ammo and started shooting the workbenches and crafting stations, the junk extractor, the fusion reacter and the waterpurifiers. Then started shooting the walls.. And suddenly the owner arrived.  He didnt even wanted to fight me, he just left with his camp. 
---
I know, these guys want the perfect town but there are going to be raiders out there
---
Weight rooms in flatwoods and Charleston FD are my go-to for lead 
---
No. The cap limit is perfect. I don't want whales with no life making all the good gear stupidly expensive. In a decent amount of time anybody can get just about anything. 
---
Mr crappy?
---
I want a pick-r-up with mini gun mount in the bed and a Brahmin skull on the hood.
---
I keep like 80 ish screws, gears and, springs in stash. If I need to repair armor its cheap. Guns are cheap to repair too. Just get double durability and reduced cost. 
---
That makes sense, but past a certain point in the game being able to craft your own weapons becomes pointless.
---
But we can also make jetpacks. 
---
You could be right afcourse but I feel there is a way to prevent us from walking. I would already be happy with a bycicle.
---
I do not keep them. the are to heavy :D if we would get more space to store items... maybe I would keep some there.
---
"Tell Merril, 'swing away' "
---
Some people just like exploiting flaws in games. Are speed runners gross and pathetic?
---
All enemies have a chance of being completely invisible. Last I played there was an invisible SB
---
Ok, I hope you can get it!
---
Fats travel : when my mother in law drives to Walmart.
---
All I want is a combat axe, just gimme a one handed axe with a medium swing speed that fits with the whole combat armor, rifle, shotgun, knife theme and I'd be happy
---
I had a twin shot gatling plasma that would break well before the clip was exhausted.
---
It would be cool to be able to display some of the trinkets and toys on the useless shelves in the CAMP. What is the point of having a bunch of empty shelves?
---
Thank you for the feedback on the events!
---
TQ is a fucking joke with no right to call himself a "games journalist". He spends more time going on about "woke sjws" and "waaaaahmen". Typical arrogant right wing prick.
---
I had invisible scorched, ghouls.. 
---
Until lvl 75 or so, crafted guns is most likely all you have.  Good legendary guns are "supposed" to be very rare. 
---
Workshops will always be attacked by a few waves of add's. Its a good way to level up, claim a few workshops then fast travel between them for the waves and rewards.
---
The level thing is annoying as the game doesn't explain it you at all. The enemies will always scale to the highest level person in the area. So if there's a level 50+ near by when the attack triggers the mobs will spawn at there level. It can be avoided / planned for by keeping an eye on the map. However as workshops are PVP contested zones I think (not 100%) that some PVP'ers can not show up on the map (i think not 100%).
---
Sounds bad but server hopping is a good way to avoid this etc if it becomes a major issue 
---
I do actually and i recently added it. I was wondering if it was PA in general as ive been using it more. I hadnt heard about the hud and will ditch that gear for now and see how it goes.
---
What’s the story in a nutshell?
---
I have a vampiric gatling gun and that thing is MEAN and I basically cant die.
---
Thank you! What an awful design bug in this quest.
---
Idk man ive bought a shotgun from a guy who had like 50 or so intelligence when he repaired it, ive put about 5k rounds through that thing and the second cobdition bar hasnt moved.
---
Hey, still got that bomber jacket for sale? 
---
😉
---
I can just go on to the community on ps4 and buy whatever I want relatively cheap.
---
Vehicles are very server intensive on resources.  I've been through several iterations of this argument in other survival games.  You've got to give them their own physics, damage / health bars, now we're talking fuel, then do the speedometer gauges work, now can you damage players inside them, what happens when you hit another player with your vehicle, what about lag / desync, which is authoritative......the player driving the vehicle or the server?
---
Do you want the game to perform worse?  If they implement cars and ANY of the above items are buggy, will you still be happy?  Will you not ask for vehicle storage and mad max armor upgrades?
---
I would rather have them put real CONTENT in the game (work on opening new vaults, adding player vending, known recipes are grayed out, new events, etc).  Not waste time on things we don't need.
---
You can fast travel.  You don't NEED a car.  If you really want to, make the sound "vroom vroom" when you fast travel.
---
I feel your pain. I’ve been looking for a T60 left arm for weeks. 
---
I find plenty of armor... just no left arms. 
---
Im pretty sure they nerfed the power armor spawn rate, or they could have completely changed the spots. I had 4 places i check, two in ash heap, two up north (i forgot the section name) and when i check those spots there is nothing.
---
Ewww. Cheater.
---
I've been at it for weeks. All the armor mods ha e a very low learn chance so it's a long process. You can craft them to speed it up a bit. The plans for marine armor spawn in drop sites c2 and g3, the train car west of watoga station, and the bombed out 3 story building in Harper's ferry closest to the fast travel arrival point.
---
We see a lot of this particular feedback, and have been passing it along to the development team. Thanks for all the continued feedback! 
---
Also glad to know I'm not to only one who collects every different teddy bear they find.
---
personally i just keep moving around the map and dont get stuck on any one spot, my run is multiple locations for multiple things and i walk away with about 30-40 screws after an hour. ill probably throw charleston in my route since i can waltz though that area pretty quick and hit up the spawn to see if the responder bot is around
---
You know, I have had a similar experience on PC, but oddly only with my new character. If I open up my pip boy with my new character too soon, I cannot make the pipboy go away and it doesn't show anything even if I fast travel, it stays in my face. My old character? Absolutely no problems. I wonder if these two problems are somehow related. 
---
I just want the Aristotle emote tbh
---
Proto-culture!
---
I was meticulous when I tested. First removed ALL cards, then added one card at a time and checked stats each time. Sure enough, revolver rifle is a handgun and a rifle.
---
Perk decks, passive perks and active perks a proper respec option.
---
Any of the above would be welcome!
---
Perks in packs is daft, not sure why they wanted us to get used to opening packs for them but meh some dev's idea of a good idea i assume.
---
This is plausible 
---
Thats true, and to be honest besides all the bugs in this game i really enjoy it, especially since there have been so many weird or funny encounters with other players 
---
Thank you for listening and hope we see improvents in the future :)
---
pretty sure it's just a bad RNG spot for you.  My normal spots still seem to spawn as usual.
---
Cheating? By trading on an mmo?
---
Whitesprings is fine.  It exists already, and they can easily put Player Vending Machines in the basement.
---
I'd much prefer it to be at Whitesprings.
---
yeah, this is what i meant :) 
---
I mean, I really do want this now
---
How hard is it to post info across multiple platforms?  It would go a long way with the community. 
---
A lot of the time I find a comment on the forums and nowhere else.  
---
What did that stand for? I never thought about it
---
&gt; Sorry for killing your wife or girlfriends character but you need to move your shit.
---
That's a non-apology. Nobody *needs* to move for you. They have just as much right to be there as you do, and it's easier for one person (you) to server hop than it is for two people (them) to server hop. If they were newer to the game, and they don't frequent places like Reddit, they may not know how to "jump servers" or even know that changing servers is a thing they can do. They probably also had no idea that the rare vendor existed or how to spawn it. It's also not a trivial thing to move a camp, especially if you haven't put a lot of time into learning how it works. 
---
Your TLDR is just basically saying that if anyone does something anyone else doesn't like, they'll be bullied and destroyed. What a lovely message of friendship and acceptance.
---
So, congratulations on being an entitled, self-centered, and antagonistic, I guess?
---
Casual burn 
---
Ah I see. That's pretty neat, I didn't know that. 
---
Thank you guys for the info! Now I know why 9/10 times a lvl 100+ started to claim my workshop and then simply go away once they collected some free caps.
---
Well you wield the crank with one hand. So maybe its not a bug
---
Hey I'm not defending every single writing choice.  I'm just saying that there is a lot more there than funny outfits or whatever.
---
I've been thinking the same thing lately. Can I drive a semi-truck that shoots missiles out of the front while playing AC/DC?
---
Those things are fine, it's some of the other things that are over the top. Mostly related to crafting everything you need instead of exploring to find it.
---
Ahh okay, so there was likely a higher level in the area that caused this. Bit annoying that it doesnt realise that the person who claimed was level 16 haha
---
you only really need to be close by what ever you fast travel to the most.
---
Tbf Im 26 and want people off my lawn 
---
Cool, but... what does that have to do with this post?
---
Unfortinately as much as i love free weekends (they got me into R6 siege and Rocket League) i can already see certain youtubers playing amateur spin doctor...
---
"Bethesda does a free weekend for 76? LOOK AT HOW DESPERATE THESE SCUMBAGS ARE"
---
ok big man 
---
Nope, not wanted. Just got blasted into oblivion by the guy haha
---
I do see the issue with that even though I myself stay away from pvp for the moment.  Maybe they should create a new mode, bounty hunter that could be put in place like the passivist.  Then while that mode is on you could have the wanted people displayed or have that last seen feature.  Also if you have on bounty hunter then those with bounties could attack you for normal damage but those without bounties would still be slap damage to prevent using it as a tool for murdering random people.  just a thought.
---
i bought a Nocturnal, Explosive Western pistol off the watoga station vendor and it's got to be my favorite. I run a melee build but dedicated some points in pistol perks, first for the sommerset special, then this. I like sneaking and sniping guys before i run in and bash them. That satisfying THWUMP when the bullet hits is just too good!
---
I also have an instigating, bonus limb damage double barrel but the limited range and ammo capacity bug me too much to use it all that much. i usually only pull it out when fighting sb to get that cripple. 
---
You also pull the trigger with 1 hand for every other weapon. That doesnt make any sense to me
---
I want a 'four arms' mutation.
---
So i can wield 2 gatling guns at once 
---
and the papers want to know whose shirt you weaaaaaaar.
---
150 bugs fixed and a new crop of bugs.  They can't parade that around when if they subracted the new ones it would probably be 1/3 of that.
---
And I'm guessing you didn't actually get the Atoms?
---
It'd be cool if you got them anyway.
---
Depends on platform. PC is way different than console. Console is cheaper due to massive duping
---
I am on xbox, if that is why, but every server ive been on theyre empty
---
I consider it a robot clean up crew after a nuke has gone off, the glowing ones body’s make such a mess
---
It gets a day later every week.  Tues, We'd now Thursday lol
---
More events.  Lower CD timers.
---
Better rewards.  They should REVERT the legendary drop nerf.  Items that drop from legendary creatures should scale to YOUR level.  I'm currently grinding Uranium Fever and 100% of the drops last night were under-leveled trash I couldn't use (to include multiple 3 star items leveled anywhere from 10 to 40).
---
Ima go out of my way to put my camp there.
---
So a post 5 days after the original statement on here? Little late for evidence.   Also if you ask around you know the people that got banned, they all had 100,000- 1,000,000 in weapons, armor, and junk stacks. 30k junk doesn't get you banned or me and a bunch more people I know would be banned, in fact my entire friends list for FO76 would be banned we all have mules we all trade and farm every day still. You know how easy it is to reach 500k steel? Shit even 10k ballistic fiber in a day is easy if you farm on 3 characters and mule it over.   
---
So no they are still not banning on carry weight or I would have been banned already with my 1.2 million on a mule. 
---
Seems to be about right for XBOX
---
i would be happy to relieve you of your cap burden! 
---
Federal disposal site has 3 uranium extractors, its a workshop at the very bottom of the map in the Savage Divide. West of the Monorail Elevator. 
---
&gt; Totally unrealistic.
---
You know, if you got shot with a TSE AK 47 in real life with a full suit of armor, it'd probably get blown off in one shot.
---
Buttfloss.
---
Bethesda themselves say there is no truth to that rumor, so
---
I found a full set between the 2 in watoga fairly quickly. I know it was  good luck but one of the sets seems to always spawn 51 armor if not both.
---
Ah. That’s great to know. Thanks 
---
You KNOW they are all dupes. So yea. Roll you own or nothing. 
---
I'll take it for the 1k caps. 
---
You still need those marine leg plans? I think I have those too. 
---
IDK how to check challenges so IDK if it has
---
Apparently its to much for Bethesda or they think its not important :(
---
Community manager suggests that its there role though and part of there job description so not 100% sure why its being ignored the way it is.
---
If you've got a load of angry customers, ignoring them and hiding away is the very last thing that would solve the issue. This isn't there first game either they should know this so it is very strange that it's being allowed to continue like this now.
---
There’s so many things I would love to display at my camp too! Being someone who likes to collect things is such a hard thing to deal with in this game. 
---
Why cant you just go to whitesprings like everyone else?
---
But only on headshots
---
Crap we are back to the master chief power armor
---
Without exploits?
---
Adrenal, Talons, Bloodied Powerfist, Twisted muscles, full unyielding, and all necessary perks along with VATS crit should take a nasty chunk out of her health, but still should not be a one shot.
---
So yeah bobblehead stacking is more than likely
---
I have experienced the same thing, but when I looked, that server was pretty empty. On a full server after a hop, I still got quick respawns so maybe it was that?
---
I have them. But I can sell you the BoS jacket. Reply to the original post so I can give you karma. I’ll be on later
---
tear it down and build a new different camp 
---
Since the last update, I'll sometimes just be completely unable to move. I can see trees and plants moving, and I've even had other players run past. But I can't move at all. It won't even let me open the pipboy, it'll only let me open the map, and even fast travel. But I'll still be unable to move or look around. 
---
BUT I CAN SURE AS HELL TAKE DAMAGE. 
---
Now I know how the Tin Man feels. 
---
Sorry no.
---
Don't want any more micro-management of character state.
---
If you want a body sim game get SCUM.  You'll be super happy there.  Just don't forget to make sure you take your vitamins, sleep, poop, pee, heal yourself over and over and over to regen, etc.
---
This is a very good analysis.  Thank you. Updooted both places. 
---
You can drop a bit of that if you want to free up a perk slot or two. I am tanking my TSE shotty /w demo5 using dense+fireproof2+dodgy and getting no damage.
---
Thanks for all the feedback on the atomic shop items, guys! It really helps us to hear what you personally want to see, what you already like and what you don't like. 
---
That would be so op. 
---
However, to balance it, it dissallows your character from ever using power armour, and chest armour pieces (but you can wear 4 arm pieces!). 
---
This is fun. Hehe. 
---
Lol I’m just messing 
---
Do other Responders vendors not sell it? Just the one bot?
---
The 2 communities I use strictly mod and prohibit the trading of duped items. But I only use melee so I'm pretty sure my weapons aren't duped.
---
It is implied cheating since we know "all" guns are duped and if you trade you are trading for duped items thus you are a cheater.   
---
This is the current logic of the bandwagon around here. It is best to ignore and not feed those on the wagon. Also don't worry the youtubers will tell them to be mad at something else by next week. 
---
It’s not an official hub and doesn’t promote player safety and learning. It’s just a kill em all grounds. That’s fine for now but not good enough if they want to make this game better 
---
FUS RO DAH
---
Mine too, it's also the missed opertunites for quests that relate to the items. The vault tech power armour paint should really be found somewhere in vault tech university. Could have done a retrieval quest, go to each of the other vaults to unlock it or top student that year gets the paint job.
---
Take the waste disposal workshop in the south below RnG it has 3 produces 10 per machine just about every 20 minutes. I make alot of mini nukes and it's my go to workshop. Not alot of people go after it either. Honestly can't ever recall it being taken at all.
---
Griffin....you mean Grafton station? 
---
Please, do.
---
I have screws tagged for search and a magnifying glass never shows up next to any clipboards.
---
I'm 28 and I want a lawn for people to stay off of. Haha
---
I hope you’re on Xbox, I’ve been looking for a camp to level for a while now
---
Mine is in the Savage Divide, right near one of the launch silo tubes. I really enjoy sitting on my balcony and watching the missiles launch!
---
But my camp is made of wood and i'd really like to tear it down and rebuild it with brick. I spend a lot more time near watoga now though so i'm thinking or relocating down there somewhere. I'm not terribly concerned with resource nodes, just want a good spot that is close to where i want to be and isn't being constantly attacked. water is nice but not a deal breaker. 
---
Yeah, imagine wielding two TSE gatling guns, SBQ will shit her pants... Err wings  if shes not bugged 
---
Some of the camp stuff is alright, like the fireplace and the Appalachia map. The rustic and nuka cola stash boxes are cool... But a toy box???
---
Did you just make liberty prime a world raid boss
---
Same here. Mine ran well in beginning but has progressively got worse as well.
---
If you see level 45 or 50, just think to yourself "ok that's max level".  They should've made max for everything 50 just for OCD's sake, but it really doesn't matter.
---
Are you still hunting?  I’m sure we can offer out more fun spots.  
---
We are constantly working to address servers and connectivity. When you have crashes, it helps us a lot to [have a ticket filed](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10) telling us about the issue so we can further investigate and fix what's needed. Our next patch will bring even more stability.
---
all i need is the frames, i know a sentry bot spawn that is sometimes legendary
---
I frankly really like it. It is probably the most progressive and interesting character building system out of any fallout game and it allows for really cool levels of character specialization.  Like you say, you can also collect enough of each card to have 1 of each level (a lot of people want the ability to un-upgrade cards, but that is just not necessary because of this fact) to have maximum flexibility.   
---
I would love perk decks, that is a cooler name than "loadouts". Definitely seems like a must.   
---
A less necessary need would also be to have some sort of passive perk mechanic because, while decks will alleviate a lot of the hassle from constantly needing to swap cards, it is just kind of a little silly in my opinion. I am glad that I can easily swap the cards to be able to do more with my character, but in some ways that just seems kind of unnecessary in many situations. Swapping cards to hack or lockpick turns into a chore more than a fun aspect of an otherwise well designed system.   
---
That being said, I might also be supportive of actually restricting ability to swap decks to, maybe only being able to swap at a specific place on the map or something. That way it encourages more team play and rewards specialization more. I think the single greatest strength of the perk deck system is that it enables and somewhat rewards specialization. 
---
Yeah, then it was bugged. I accessed that terminal and it did nothing.
---
Press start and hit LB on Xbox. Not sure about PC
---
Well fast travel just isn't realistic specially when it costs me caps. Atleast make up a story on how I fast travel. 
---
Also I agree on the different games and pubg struggled with it for a while, it got better now. Cod blackout did a good job. They have 100 people on a server instead of 23. But I understand fallout needs more than pubg or cod. 
---
I don't NEED a car no but we don't need anything since its all for entertainment. We don't need but we would like.
---
Yes but having more than one could be effective so you don’t have to always got to white springs even if you are far away have one closer to the mire and cranberry bog or maybe a low level one in the middle of the forest. Yes we have one doesn’t mean it wouldn’t hurt to have more than one
---
Duped bobblehead stacking.  They really need to fix it so you can't stack bobbleheads.
---
So that person is either 1.  A duper or 2. Friends with a duper.
---
I did not. Only for the one I could complete
---
I just would love to see the visuals of it. 
---
Kind of like that  Mortal Kombat character but with two heavy guns. 
---
Though it might actually be longer than that - - like the length of the disease resist debuff. 
---
One of my fav events.
---
An excellent rationale! I like it!
---
Oh did not know that thot it procd on each hit
---
Yeah haha
---
I've seen plenty of speed runs for Mario, Zelda, Metroid, etc. Can't recall a single speed run that wrecks server stability and is used directly against other players. I could be wrong, but seems like your example missed the mark. 
---
i had a camp north east of there, right up against the invisible wall. That was back when camps kept getting stored and i just wanted somewhere out of the way. I never go to the toxic valley anymore so i moved it down to the divide
---
Last weeks was on Thursday. Which is today. Honestly I have trouble knowing what day it is. I'm a professional illustrator working from home so all days kind of blend. 
---
r/Fallout76Settlements
---
im on xbox, thx
---
 If you see level 45 or 50, just think to yourself "ok that's max level". They should've made max for everything 50 just for OCD's sake, but it really doesn't matter. 
---
Not really, literally every new player i have met has been at white springs, i picked up two level 11 and 24 players that are part of my low level army. My kids were the ones that introduced me to white springs and they found it cause the bots helped them grind xp. 
---
I would be happy with a shopping trolley for the extra carry weight.
---
I literally saw this post and then immediately ran across one in the game, 500c? 
---
The bobble head stacking effects over as well.  I unloaded 3 full clips into the SBQ last night and another player instagibbed her an I got no credit for loot.
---
Fix it for the sake of both pvp and pve.
---
That trash fatman isnt going to do anything. I aint no level 45 yiu can have a "hissy fit." With either. 
---
There are weekly challenges?!
---
Camps dont have any effect on the spawns, ive had tons of camps that have had npcs spawn into the camp itself and joined servers with player camps that were in locations everyone says dont put here cause it breaks one of the mobile vendors. 
---
Glowing things, and one of the board games
---
but but but you're just asking them to make the game easier! /s
---
We absolutely need a weapon rebalance particularly for heavy and energy weapons. Players who want to use these weapons shouldn't be penalized for it, there is no reason to punish them for using weapons that exist in the game.
---
Honestly IDK, but the hip fire thing could be spot on, which is why I was thinking it could be a good test, most people put recoil upgrades on Rifles since it assists with sniping 
---
I have one 3* and it’s a furious Gatling laser ffs I will never use that in my life
---
Right but it will be fun.
---
can't wait to read how they fuckked my mom and that I'm a wallhacking camper noob at my leisure 
---
Just like how the server stability was still garbage for 3 days after they patched the duping methods?
---
We're working on ways to let you know what the current event status is before you travel to an event, and also addressing server stability further. The next patch will have more server addresses. Thanks for your patience while we work on this! In the meantime, we're still looking for more feedback on events in general. So feel free to comment your thoughts and ideas in our [forum thread here](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/314209/feedback-requested-events?language%5B%5D=en).
---
Yeah, I can’t use PA pieces yet though I have two frames in my stash. One with some T-45 pieces and one with T-51 pieces. I considered wearing an empty frame but I’d rather not waste my 1.5 fusion cores.
---
Can't they find a way to track which items have been duped and remove them?
---
Items have two scaling patterns with level:
---
**5-15-25-35-45**
---
Or
---
**10-20-30-40-50**
---
I like how all of the ads said "Don't go it alone!" but you get evicted from your land for building 5ft too close to somebody
---
Same thing on my Xbox. Getting real hard to even play this game anymore
---
Yeah as fun as writing a 30 paragraph essay on why you griefed a bunch of noobs.
---
that sounds like something right
---
It's a small bug that really doesn't hurt you.  Do you get sad when you see someone firing a gatling gun slightly faster?  No?
---
Do you get sad when the server crashes because dupers are trying to dupe thousands of items?  Yes.
---
Pick your battles.  Let them focus on getting us more CONTENT instead of chasing bugs nobody cares about.  I give 0 shits about the perk working on gatling guns.  I literally couldn't care less.  I'm wondering why you do.
---
I’m still learning the perks and which tree to focus on, so this is helpful, thank you!
---
Yes. In the menu on the start screen. 5 daily challenges, 5 weekly challenges as well as character, survival, combat, social and world challenges. They all award you atoms to spend in the Atomic Shop
---
Pretty sure there's one or two spawn locations where they don't aggro on players unless attacked.
---
My favorite weapon is my Level 1 Non-legendary pink baseball that I found. 
---
No worries about communication, happy to be slow and steady.  
---
For consoles, I've seen allot of posts talking about clearing the cache, rebooting and then rebuilding being key when performance / stability becomes an issue, have you done that?
---
I’m with you man, everything I have I found save for a few that friends found while I was with them and they traded it over. 
---
All the more reason to launch more nukes and farm more. Happy to hear someone else is committed to legitimacy.
---
Because I want challenge and extended life to the game rather than one-shotting everything?
---
I don't just stand around in the Forest picking flowers, but I'm level 25 and have gotten exactly one legendary drop so far (other than the one you get for quest rewards). Some legendary dog dropped it when I was level 15 and it was a level 5 pipe pistol that does more damage the less health you have (I gave it to a level 5 player). I actually enjoy crafting new weapons to my level, and feel some sense of accomplishment as enemies that used to scare the hell out of me now drop in one shot. But I would never tell somebody else that they shouldn't go trade for some BFG or whatever if that's what would make the game fun for them.
---
Granted, but it costs about a thousand dollars
---
I build my base around him, and have a neon sign letting him know he's a good boy even when I'm not home
---
It happens, move on. I'm sure they'll appreciate your defense.
---
been happning to me very often, lvl 53 gutsys. lvl 50+ mole rats and chinese robots. i was lvl 20
---
i was able to take down some lvl 50 robotrons, but the lvl 50 gutsy would destroy me
---
all at starter camps Sunrise and the razorgrain camp below it
---
I get a PA show every time I try to find a specific set. 😀
---
Thats why TSE weapons will be nerfed.
---
I'll throw in on this too. I am not sure when it started but once I pin down which tube the legendary came out of I have had 5x respawns in a row on two tubes that were always legendary. 10x legendaries in a row from teh same tubes says something is up for sure.
---
Also the deathclaw spawn north of watoga will always respawn legendary if it is a legendary.
---
Complete and total agreement.   I love the look, feel and sound of the energy weapons, but they're shit.  So I never use them.  Such a shame.
---
If you found one you would never sell it, where do you think they come from?
---
Raiders only attack the weak and defenseless because they are weak children who have no courage to face someone who is an actual challenge.  Grow up or go play fortnite, child.
---
Some of the story is fine, incredible?  Hardly.  The writing is typically Beth - medicore and sitting in the backseat to the "tragic skeleton" placement crew.
---
Maybe they will add new powerfull legendaries
---
Check ignition and may Todd's love be with you.
---
Damn, that's a sad situation.  Hoping things clear up for you.
---
 [u/LoneVaultWanderer](https://www.reddit.com/u/LoneVaultWanderer) [u/kindofsquishy](https://www.reddit.com/u/kindofsquishy) looking for your acknowledgement on this, at least. Would really like to see this addressed.
---
I tend to have one melee and two guns depending on my ammo count and durability levels. I don’t have perks to increase durability yet so things break easy which gets annoying when I’m out exploring/questing. Thanks!
---
So.... Optimus prime?
---
Yeah, I'm always: hey, can I randomly find the T-51b today, or will it be, literally, the 5th one!??!?
---
Your diligence is appreciated and I don't mean to be rude but if I filled out tickets for every bug and every crash I would spend more time filling those out than playing the game. The last patch brought less stability, hopefully the next reverts it.
---
anything that drops glowing meat, i have it tagged so i just keep picking it up even though i dont need it all the time. 
---
I’ll have to look for that one. Thanks!
---
Why is there not a thread with just over the top requests? Might be good for a laugh? 
---
Like a TSE BB gun. 
---
Crafting the electrified hatchet is busted. You craft, it uses up items and then stays the same.
---
Good times. I love using up that duct tape it takes me ours to farm up like this.
---
You don’t know who has dupes and doesn’t. Not to mention someone probably traded some of their personal favorite items THEY farmed for the items they wanted. This game is based around trading. If they wasn’t expecting you to trade for the items you want, the trade function wouldn’t exist. To shit on people for playing the game as intended because you want to play by yourself or without trading is an ignorant response. I’ve personally found god rolls and trade some off to players for things I’ve needed, doesn’t make me a cheater nor the person receiving them a cheater. Another person who hasn’t found anything useful and claims every good item is duped? Sounds like it. 
---
I've now made it my mission to get this suit.
---
That’s where I got mine. I kinda like the dirty look too. Plus I’ve been wearing it since beta so it’s kinda become a staple for my character. 
---
Im not the one justifiying me being a dick hesd via a tl:dr post on reddit. 
---
Was definitely hilarious 
---
Twice in cliffs just outside watoga (monorail-ish).  Both times he was pretty isolated and not near any fast travel points.  I do roam those hills more than most, so I suspect it's pretty random.
---
You couldn't care less? Why did you even comment in the first place then
---
the problem with that is you now have a unique item in a data base instead of just an item in the game. 
---
Because clipboards don't give screws. They give springs
---
We're aware of this issue, a fix for this issue is coming in a future update. 
---
The OP. 
---
I didn’t consider how much the spoiled items weigh and I tend to save them to craft fertilizer (what for, I have no idea lol). I’ll drop them when I’m on next and see how much space that frees up.
---
Nothing you can’t hear from them in person thanks to proximity chat xD
---
How dare you acknowledge that someone is using a feature as intended, such people are pieces of shit! /s
---
Carebears gonna carebear.
---
BuT iT AfFeCtS mY PvP eXpErIEnCe!
---
Ooo Mr bad ass over here.  Everyone watch out
---
No i didn't, i'll try later and hope for the best. I'll keep you updated, thanks for your help ❤
---
Don't forget they're also good for scrapping. 
---
Get excavator armor and go to lucky hole mine. You would not believe how much lead scrap you can get.
---
For what it’s worth I’ve found the route west from Janet’s Ice Cream to yield many more encounters with the vendor bit than Charleston Station
---
You ticked most of this sub's boxes but you forgot to imply in your story that they were a duper. 
---
Because of that I'm afraid you may not qualify for /r/f076 gold, you may however still qualify for silver.
---
Initial load of game near my camp takes a bit but other than that, no major issues (PS4)
---
Sounds worse than Afghanistan.  How did you survive the emotional trauma?
---
Starting during the beta, I noticed all these different bears and thought "there must be a reason there's such a variety, I'll start collecting them!"
---
So I did, and I had a ton of different ones, but then that stash limit snuck up on me like a train running on time. I dropped a few here, a few there, and finally had to drop Quantum Bear at the government disposal site so I could fast travel away from a scorchbeast (I was not equipped to deal with it). 
---
Quantum Bear held it off long enough for me to get away. 
---
Bone shards, ammo you aren't using or plan to use, unbulked lead and aluminum, spoiled food and chems you don't use/need/sell. 
---
Great, thanks! 
---
But you are arguing with one, I appreciate your feedback. just call me a bad person and continue your day. 
---
No, they can only see how 1 becomes 2 becomes 4 becomes flagged on a character. It has been a debate among my friends some of which had accounts banned, only one was not a duper by the way, didn't even use duped items just made way way way to many shotgun shells while they had super duper on since they spammed over 10k worth it must have flagged the system. One got a perma ban now after they requested an appeal saying they can see how 4 became 8 which 15 minutes later became 16. One of the other dupers that didn't get banned duped in small numbers but still had large sums.   
---
So honestly overall we do not know their total methodology but it is known they are looking at the amounts being doubled.   
---
And no I am not saying duping is fine I give my friends shit for doing and laugh still about how they lost their main account and now have to play on their mule account. 
---
&gt;  Hopping around events can be a very quick way to get a huge stockpile of stimpaks
---
That doesn't feel rewarding though because I didn't need stimpacks in the first place. I do a few events, find myself with over 100 stimpacks and I go vendor them for more caps.
---
Events should at least be giving a legendary item. If the current loot lotto system is staying it would be a good place to give us more chances to get something useful.
---
I haven’t run across vendors yet and I have no idea how to bulk items lol. Thank you! I’ll review how I manage my aid inventory and reduce that down.
---
Thank you, I will give it a shot. 
---
I have a soft spot for Deathclaws in my heart, it was the the first enemy in a videogame to make me audibly scream when I saw my first one in 3! I will mention to the devs that we want more Death on Deathclaw island!
---
What about small letters and Neon signs?  Its more thoughtful when they talk about fucking your mom and call you a wall hacking camper noob.
---
Fakenews
---
The TSE harpoon gun with fletchettes is the tse shotgun 2.0 and the tse 50 cal gatling is better than almost every rifle
---
While I’m at it. Would love the same kinda thing for those pickled scorched parts, board games, teddy bears, and gnomes.
---
Im not arguing, youre a dick, try it with a higher level player. Then write your novel.
---
There are very friendlyt supermutes in West Tek (shh nobody tell him)
---
My experience is that the ones you run into early on in the Forest aren't aggressive. They are yellow when you look at them. We found one in the Savage Divide when I was level 30 which was red and aggressive. 
---
I suspect they are just supposed to terrify new players and foreshadow that you'll be dealing with these later and need to get stronger.
---
I second that. The first week or so after the latest patch the initial load times were incredible. Now, not so much. Seeing the black screen effect as well. No mods installed.
---
15+ crashes yesterday not counting...the crashes on login...random server disconnects,... and the game crashes when exiting to desktop (yes that bug that is still present).
---
if I put is tickets for all these I would spend more time writing tickets than playing the game.
---
Crafting is where I shit the bed in the end game.  
---
I want 10 points in intel now so I can use makeshift and gunsmith level 5  
---
I have white knight and that has been amazing for armour longevity.  
---
Super Duper lets you double any crafted items.  
---
I see this as well.
---
It’s definitely useful but I feel like it’s not as personal as you voluntarily going on a terminal and finding it lol
---
I understand that completely. Thanks for your patience on this!
---
Yeah, there was a few times I was serving hopping for lead at the fire department where I returned to the same server. At first I didn't recognize it but then I realized a mutant I shot inside the firehouse with the same loot was there a several times in a row. I thought I just got there too late to get the lead and it turns out I was the one who got the lead before me. Hasn't happened lately though. Not sure why it did for a couple days.
---
Well, then a console wouldn't be the wisest purchase.
---
Fallout lore says most vehicles became nuclear powered.
---
Darn. Pre-war money.
---
Vampiric Fat man is what I got yesterday lmao
---
Would you rather have 2 more vaults opened?  What about 2 new events?  What about player vending?  The amount of work needed to get good FULLY functional implemented working vehicles is massive.  And if they are implemented it will DECREASE server performance.  7 Days to Die spent about a year doing it, and I remember their stupid bikes would lag the server like crazy, to the point where if too many people were driving it would straight up crash the server.  I still don't know if they ever fully fixed the vehicles because I stopped playing after the 50th crash, players would literally drive as fast as they could just to crash the servers for fun.
---
That doesn't even take into account vehicle hoarding and vehicle griefing.  Ok, now you can drive cars, but every single time you log in your car is blown up.  Now you want secure storage options, or invulnerable bases, only to find out people can still throw X grenade at your base and it will eventually destroy the vehicle in your new "secure" garage.  Once they put vehicles in, then people will hoard and hide them.  Steal all the vehicles, drive them into a spot on the map where nobody can get them back out (like a fissure).
---
Let them focus on content.  You have fast travel.
---
If it comes down to it I will. Would it have been better if I left their levels out? Maybe it will sound more fair. Be on the look out for the next post when it happens, I look forward to your comment.
---
DUDE is that a dog camera? Where can i get one in the mount NEED!!!
---
That was my location for weeks. If you place your camp 3 stories up the stairs then you can build from the ground to the train car
---
This is funny because bethesda has done it in skyrim /thatsthejoke
---
Ok, enjoy your purchased items.
---
If so, some teasers would be nice in the form of images/gif.  Rather than just text about what may come.
---
It's already covered in shit?
---
Your ideas are intriguing to me, and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.
---
&gt; ......I have a collecting problem.
---
&gt; Swapping cards to hack or lockpick turns into a chore more than a fun aspect of an otherwise well designed system.
---
I honestly, and truly understand this aspect. 
---
But to me, these two skills only exist because, it's expected. And they allow you to get extra stuff from locked containers or from behind doors that can't be opened without a terminal.
---
There's no quest that requires these skills to complete. So these are just perks for bonus stuff. Let's be honest. We all have some degree of belief that if we don't check everything, that's where the thing we want is. 
---
So we never pass up on one or both of these skills. I think the real issue is that these skills aren't well used in the game. 
---
They really need to find a way to implement these skills to make a difference in the game? For example, there's spots where you can repair a massive gun and it will shoot Scorched beasts. 
---
What if you had to first repair them. Then use hacking to improve their targeting? The level of your hacking would determine how good they operate? 
---
What if those places that require you to find a key card, could be bypassed through hacking? Or what if hacking allowed you to make security cards, that could be used once? I mean, most of the time the card you need is somewhere close. And if not, there's always the quest markers to show you right where it is. 
---
As it is, it's just annoying to have to switch into these perks because we can't pass up a locked container or door for that extra chance to find something. I'm not even sure that unlocking a level 3 safe give you a chance for anything good, just more stuff.
---
A pre-War Mechwarrior, why not ☺️👍
---
lvl 50 gutsy can destroy level 50 players if they arent careful
---
Camp mclintock is always looted out for me.
---
Yeah, thats wjat i was thinking aswell. If my theory is correct, the reason why the hip-fire addons help, is because the initial snap centers on the enemy, and the addons reduce the 'spray', makimg the initial hip-fire shot more likely to hit.
---
It is easily tested luckily. As long as one charges the shot before VATS, wait for the zoom in, then takes a couple steps sideways it still should consistently miss, whatever addons are on.
---
I have no opinion on whether OP is lying or not, but there’s certainly a good reason for carrying loot with you vs. storing it: weight-reducing perks plus an almost-full stash. 
---
What I don’t get is the progress loss thing, unless they’re talking about uncheckpointed quests. 
---
They are stuck. Move camp.
---
Things like this should be told to the player by the game in any kind of way :/
---
Maybe many people would've kept a good gatling gun if they knew they can fire it 40% faster... especially when they found a legendary with faster fire rate effect
---
Have you tried turning your Brahmin on and off again? :)
---
(Joking aside, thanks for bringing this up I'll pass this along!)
---
Almost no one builds there camp there - funny thing was that when I first started out during the beta, I built my camp on the cliff above the spawn point (just after the overturned bus) just so I could snipe at the supermutants that spawned at Janet’s- not realizing the cornucopia I was preventing with my presence.
---
Do you still need one?
---
What level are you?
---
Nope and nope
---
Yes so can I, but not from scrolling by it on Reddit for less than a second
---
If I'm ever in yo party, I'mma hide a speaker somewhere in that monster.  Bwahahaha!
---
My mind just got corrupted.
---
OP nailed it!
---
Thank god these people are not game designers haha
---
" it was a mid summers morn, the dew touched the flowers in such a way. I didnt get my way in a game so i acted like a child, a small, insecure unstable child..."
---
Yeah look forward to it myself.
---
Yeah, I don't understand why they didn't include that with the scrapper perk like Fallout 4's: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Scrapper\_(perk)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Scrapper_(perk))
---
The mire junk nodes next to little ponds are both pretty good spots.
---
Confirmed on xbox my fresh friends that dont even have PA see highlights from my targeting HUD. I'm going to remove this and also test my crashes
---
You are a little bit to serious about this topic lol. Half of the game is still broken at the moment so implementing anything right now wouldn't be smart. 
---
And pubg has it fixed. Also cod has it flawless Bethesda should be able to make it happen. 
---
Agreed, I always recommend reinstalling the driver and resetting the control panel as you do
---
That's good to know, I will keep that in mind to look around next time without looking suspicious.
---
That bot gives me the creeps. Ever see the dumpsters where he dumped Eckhart and the other Schlummies? Savage!
---
Well, I'm having fun being a raider, I don't harass low level players that don't deserve it. I also only go alone, cause I'm a wanderer. Everything if fair in war, and war sir, never changes.
---
SKRRAAAWWW
---
I have two shot and explosive but not both on the same weapon. It’s about to be overnefed anyway though. 
---
Will do and you can enjoy following the trends 👍🏻
---
I've seen the string! Lmao! But no paddle ball
---
I’ve run into that prize bot at least 8 times now. He’s given me 250 pre-war money, a broken hunting rifle, a watch, four bullets... even if he gives you something, he gives you nothing.
---
Yes! I want more relaxing social things to do.
---
Let me check my caps when I’m home and I’ll get back to you, but hold on to it :)
---
I kinda wondered about that.  Early on I saw one flying directly over Morgantown Airport the very first time I went there, and it scared the crap out of me.  Didn't attack though, so I wondered if it was a scripted event that I triggered just to show off or something.  Since then I've never even seen another anywhere in the forest.
---
Hmm i'mma hit you up too, that is my general playtime.
---
I have paddle ball string.... where did I get it from? I swear I think I scrapped a paddle ball? Weeks ago?
---
Dammit, I’m going to go insane.. now. 
---
This happened to me last week and they ended up killing me.
---
That's a great start, I hope you don't mind if I use it for my next failing novel. I will give all credit to u/turd_ferguson_turd
---
a remote control liberty prime
---
Thats why you setup a friends camp with everything you need and dont go to your own camp
---
I actually have not... I have to see this now. 
---
I *do* feel a little regret for the normal guys just doing their jobs and got killed too, though. 
---
This has been a persistent problem in the Fallout universe. I'm not sure how Bethesda can rationalize a canonical step forward in technology having less power than traditional firearms.
---
Level 192. This was the result of a glitch and was shear hell  to scrap. Loved building it though but had to pull it down because I couldn't build anything other than what you see
---
I do some testing when i get back home in about an hour. Hip-fire addons can definitely help if my theory is correct due to the inital VATS snap centering on the middle of the target's body. If its really a hip-fire shot, the reduced spray could make it feel like 'VATS' has gotten more accurate. 
---
Welcome anytime 
---
What does it mean?
---
Hmm...Has anyone tried nuking Deathclaw island?
---
The trend is to buy duped items. That's why I'm salty. Kinda makes the effort I put in to get my stuff worthless. 
---
That's a great idea! I hope Bethesda sees this.
---
Yeah that's something you have to get a feel for (not a hard thing to figure out).  I like the idea of being so far out that when you hit them the mobs have no idea where the shots are coming from, but you're so far away that it takes way too much ammo to kill them so it just isn't worth it.  I've never used that skill so perhaps the added accuracy solves that problem, but unless you're just outside wandering around and you're in a good position to have a lot of mobs to hit from long distance I don't see the benefits in having that perk turned on all the time.
---
Get Excavator PA as quickly as you can.
---
Yeah man, they were just trying to help. Continuing the war on China was no real option lol. But yeah check it out outside of the resort in like a little like fenced off dumpster area he has all the bodies just completely stacked in there
---
Agree to disagree I guess, sorry you're not enjoying the game
---
I'll have to look up how to get him to spawn there, even though the actual chance of getting the jacket is slim to none. 
---
Lighthouses. It just works
---
This would be awesome
---
My best weapon is a LV 35 Two shot, Explosive, Damage resist while reloading Lever action rifle. It dropped for me from a ghoul. A Non nuked, 3* lv 42 whitesprings ghoul. Im definitely "rolling with my own legendary"
---
Or any animal companion for that matter. I'll take whatever I can get.
---
Phoenix going on his self-imposed cleansing of Watoga. You can show up and this dude is waddling back to his store among bodies and bodies of robits he was just out killing for shits before you got there. 
---
The shimmer effect makes it for me, would just be another fallout shirt without it.
---
Reported for posting exploits !  :p
---
I got a Legendary Cultist Sword named “Nailer” Level 50 with a Bloodied effect from “One Violent Night” at the Sons of Dane Compound. So, some events do give you a legendary, but which ones? It would be nice to see more stuff like this in the future. I was so hyped when I got it last night!
---
&gt;I really do want this meow
---
Fixed that for you.
---
Love clickbait.
---
You can craft them, i'm sure i have seen them in the ammo section before 
---
Because you're literally pointing at something nobody cares about and SAYING they need to fix it.
---
**You also pull the trigger with 1 hand for every other weapon. That doesnt make any sense to me. Its a bullet shooting weapon  40% faster fire rate thanks to a MELEE PERK is too much Imo**
---
Nobody cares.  If they fix it, who cares.  If they don't fix it, who cares.
---
Let them focus on CONTENT.  Nobody needs silly stuff like this fixed.
---
Wait I have seen this! I thought those were resort residents! 
---
I think any centralized hub should be indoors.  It's going to be TOO tempting for bored high level to nuke it lol
---
I'm new, level 6, and I came up behind a 90 something at a npc last night then sho him once in the back because I havent gotten these horrid ps4 controls Dow.
---
I guess I should be happy he didn’t smack me with his power Armour, but hey, shit happens.
---
Post s link showing this offer 
---
Not if you have the mod. Think of it as an all in one install package
---
It really is the games greatest failing. I love this game but man I just want a mini nuke, a handgun, and some loose bullets resting on a magazine on my bedside table. One day perhaps, but not today. Not this day. 
---
 good you are kidding was thinking it was another silly But My Mom said and the schools are teaching that I'm entitled to whatever I want....
---
I agree
---
I dont get the purpose of making people map blind while wanted. If they were set on destroying camps, then they only need to team with a "spotter" who looks on the map and tells them where to go. However if you're a solo player who accidentally gets a bounty it's a huge pain since it's rare for other people to try for your bounty 
---
If it didnt stop me from checking out the map, I would leave a low bounty on 24/7 tbh
---
Also you could either build a bot or use a terminal function that would auto collect your food and water and store it there too. Though I would also like the Nuka Cola machine to vend and maybe like a water bottle machine, 3 caps for purified water, 5 caps for a Nuka Cola, etc. You would have to put the things in there of course. But a visitor could buy drinks or even snacks from your machines and they auto collect every hour or so and add to your caps. 
---
To add to that, I am Lv 174 with about 500 hours in, and have not found any other "god tier" legendary rolls. I did trade for some armour though. 
---
I don't enjoy the missed opportunities - they had carte blanche to come up with any justification to include Deathclaws, super mutants, Boss: we get no explanation, putting something in the water, and a satellite phone call.
---
Yup! I’m sure a paddle could be found in Camden Park
---
haha yea, I'd love it if they allowed full pvp when you are wanted, but then again I would totally go on a large killing spree of anybody in the area if I could so I'm sure thats why they nerf it. 
---
I like the idea about consenting to hunt a wanted person and allowing full pvp for both parties up front, that'd be way more exciting. 
---
At level 250, it is a much cheaper way to pvp as say I only lose 10 caps, instead of 250 while like you say getting a influx of caps as people try to come claim the wanted. 
---
Man, looks like a lot (if not everyone) is impacted by this bug, BGS needs to fix it - or just give everyone those atoms.  :P
---
BTW, the status of my submitted tickets is still "Waiting on agent".  Ok, to be fair, it's still less than a day, I bet they have a loooot of tickets to go through daily, haha.
---
I've had a similar issue with the power armor station as well. Unfortunately I was solo so I had to force quit the game. As for the bomb sights, I avoid them entirely. In the current state of the game I have an 80-90% chance of crashing when running in there. 60-70% just for having a nuke go off in my server in general. 
---
Not a bad idea. But very easily exploitable. Griefers would have a field day with this. Say a rando puts in a 3* TSE Shotgun(not likely but dupers will do anything) and another dude comes along. Takes that shotgun, now he’s got the means to destroy your camp, if he didn’t already. 
---
Plus, not to mention, half the stuff Wouldn’t go to someone who needs it, it would end up in a vendors inventory for caps. Which is what I do. Chems are worth a LOT. Stuff rando 1 might not want say, 30 stims, you need. Rando 2 comes by before you do and grabs those and anything else and cleans it out and bolts. 
---
That's is pretty cool. I found the same gun the first day with legendary lever action, but only lvl 1. Did the only right thing and left it at the corpse at vault 76.
---
It happens to me sometimes, but not always (PS4).
---
I play it on a pretty decent gaming pc. I dont have any performance issues, have not really encountered any bugs (except the camp 'no support available" when moving camp) and i think I have only crashed once or twice in the past two weeks, with 4-6 hour gaming sessions. And those crashes are when I quit to desktop.
---
So, yeah, performance varies from person to person.
---
Gameplay-wise, it has been a fairly positive experience for me. I havnt encountered any griefers are assholes, i have helped, and received help, from random strangers, and people seem pretty decent. I was at whitesprings last night and saw a person not in power armor getting swarmed so i (rocking my sweet sweet inferior raider power armor) ran in to help, then another guy in power armor charged in with a super sledge, and we saved the person in a dress. Then killed a few more clumps before going our separate way. Everyone was very helpful and friendly.
---
Why do assume patience?
---
Not once have Bethesda asked us for it. 3 months on games a buggy mess and the few posts you do make are in random threads and as empty as your into the vaults.
---
Not good enough for paying customers.
---
It's not meant to be fair, in the same way that prison is not meant to be fair. It's a punitive measure.  Designed to punish and discourage griefing, not as an alternate form of PvP.   
---
The ideas you listed in your edit section would make for a good addition to the hardcore PvP server they're talking about, but in the general world I don't think it would  work.  
---
Lol idk it’s my head canon maybe? I figured it was them just because of the easy access from the service entrance to the bunker. Eh idk anymore lol
---
Of all of those. The only one I actually like is the machinist shop because that would be a cool feature. 
---
Eh, im not above looking in paper bags and snagging some screws and leaving some missles
---
so far i've posted new updates after all the patches.
---
here is the most recent post which also contains links to the previous ones
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aekjtl/datamined_new_atomic_shop_items_10_januari_patch/
---
Yeah, I thought it was one of the prizes you can get from Mr. Fuzzy Tokens?
---
Currently using a non legendary bat and non legendary pump shotgun.  The bat does surprisingly well, but i'm hoping to find some upgrades soon.
---
Same here. Found my first explosive weapon just yersterday (lvl 152). A non-TS Suppressors .44
---
I'm not a grinder so i will keep playing my more or less casual way until one day i will find a good weapon eventually. Until then i'll stick to my 1\* Hunters Handmade which served me quite well for over 50 levels now.
---
This is why I don't use windows or doors you can see through.
---
I'm sorry, are you saying meow?
---
Just one question. Did you eat paint chips as a kid?
---
I'm sure someone could make that mod for you for Fallout 4.
---
Oh man, I think she's just the worst. I tried to kill her when I found out she was robot. Her voice is rough, but I was willing to put up with it thinking she was human. 
---
It would be nice before the Vendor Update for sure!  On top of screw and springs, we need to be able to breakdown ammo.  
---
Yesterday he/she said there would "likely" be one.
---
The trend is to buy duped items? The trend is to trade/buy/sell. What I chose to trade for is what I chose to trade for. I had 2 lvl 100’s before getting my first god roll weapon. If I come across a guy selling something I want and I have the caps or the items to trade, I will do it. I have plenty of time invested. Otherwise I wouldn’t have the items I have. To limit yourself and complain because your stuff is worthless that you have found has nothing to do with my choices. It may be worthless because you never took the opportunity to trade or buy something better. I spend a vast majority of my time trading things to get what I want. It may take me days or a week or so to find the item I’m looking for. My inventory is very limited but I have no issues giving up something I rarely use for something I will continuously use.  I farm for stuff I need as well. I’ve gotten quiet lucky off of the queen multiple times and gotten quiet a few nice items. But those items got traded for something I would use. My friends list is 90% merchants I’ve met on reddit. Everything from plans to ammo. Things I don’t want to grind for but I will pay or trade for. 
---
Events. I got 4 mini nukes from an event once
---
My one and only Mothman happened on the road south of Summersville. I was mid-20s level? He popped out of the bushes, my rifle was already out and I shot him on instinct. Bizarrely he was only level one (!) and had only mothman eggs or something like that and junk. Kind of anti-climactic, haven't seen one since. Did take a trophy pic though.
---
I did get the clock plans but he only had a couple of clothing items. I have a theory (untested) that his inventory is based on your characters luck. My main had 2 luck so I’ve made a secondary and leveled luck first of all. Haven’t found him yet with this new character but Graham had some pretty good stuff when I ran across him.
---
I would just like the game to work properly.....
---
And a Working Corvega.....
---
And a motorcycle.....
---
And a rifle that performs as well as a melee weapon...
---
Offer is legit, they were doing it in Australia last week. But to call it "free" is bullshit.
---
What about when someone calls me an ass eating, butt burrower? Am I then allowed to kill this person?

---
Its in German. 
---
I have to admit, it was fun for a while, now I haven't touched it in weeks .
---
Mine goes from Vault tec logo fluctuating in speed then I get a sort of distorted film negative view of the surrounded area I'm about to spawn in then BACK to the loading screen and finally the game launches. After that I have to normally wait a few seconds for textures to pop in. 
---
I bought the plants to put around my camp, I'm not a fucking savage. I would probably buy a watering can if they had one available.
---
Is it in the ash heap?
---
As well as their reflex sights 
---
Just repeatedly drop grenades or mines at your feet.  Best to use the pulse and plasma ones since they pack a bigger punch.  As they explode you'll eventually get the bees.
---
The experience is way better on Xbox.  I've recently bought the PC version and being a primary PC gamer myself, I can't even play it. It's very rare I would take a sub 30 fps experience over a 144fps one.  
---
There is UI lag with the mouse that feels like I'm playing on a WiFi steam link.  The sliders don't even slide down to the end in settings.  The lack of basic keybindings.  Who the fuck uses tab to go back or exit something?
---
The resolution isn't correctly scaled.  Something is very off about it.  The PC version needs some love with the UI but hey, it has mods.  
---
I refuse to buy weapons either a drop or vendor for me they may not be amazing but they work for me 
---
Best times in fallout 4 was messing with console commands to summon Liberty Prime and have it fight scaled up deathclaws. 
---
Does this count as "Going f2p?" xD ^(/s)
---
A lot of people prefer the game to run like its intended before they come up with new content.
---
I dont say they have to fix it asap... if its a bug they should fix it anytime in the future. If it isnt, the player should be told about this perk affecting this weapon by the game. 
---
Defense already is way overpowered to offense, if you have a full set of assassin sentinel gear then tse do less than 5 hp per hit. After they nerf tse, you will be basically invincible to anything but unyielding melee characters 
---
Sounds like a good idea to me.
---
Well the thing is i can’t respawn anywhere not even right where i died, i’ve had to just quit the game unless i’m missing something. I guess i should never take my excavator power armor off after nukes lmao. but ty for the heads up tho man
---
With all the rumors of the game going to Free two Play, there's a healthy amount of doubt when people see things like this. 
---
Anyone find a 2SE paddleball?
---
Want to say west of the crashed space station but could be wrong its been a while!
---
You can chat in game using the party feature, or if you are on consoles you can form your own parties that are not limited to the games UI.
---
So tape a nuke to a bat, gotcha
---
There is no text can't unless you are on PC and have mods.
---
What about things like the pipe revolver? Up through where I am now I’ve been crafting 5-10-15-20 and up
---
Thanks for making me aware. I am now a god among men with my TS Gat speedy receiver! Hahaha!
---
Have you tried going to the locations on the interactive map here: [https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/)
---
Thank you. As soon as its downloaded I'm jumping back in. 
---
Wait sill needs time to develop
---
Yes, we need to be able to put junk and items on shelves. Why even have the shelves and tables if all we can out on them are lamps and shit? There was a mod in FO4 that made display cases that actually displayed stuff. I wouldn't think there would be any major problems making it where you could store stuff on a shelf and it would appear on it. (Like the mag racks and bobblehead stand in F04).
---
Yeah, my friends list is mostly merchants too. And people I give free stuff to regularly.
---
Ah, I'll kill it when I get the chance. Don't you worry!
---
deconditions on each hit, but procs on each trigger pull. If there's only one trigger pull, you get the worst of both worlds
---
Seems like it, kinda unfair for the people who bought it full price.
---
Never really paid attention to pipe revolver since it doesn't have a legendary tbh, so I don't know that particular case
---
There is indeed player to player trading. If you walk up to a player, you hold Space to initiate a trade (on PC, unsure about console). And there is proximity voice chat. There is no built in text chat function. And no, this is not an MMO. It is not "massive" in scale, and servers are capped at 24 players. 
---
That's how the screws ended up in the bear's tract in the first place, it looked like lunch
---
Which should also cause frenzy to nearby creatures
---
*Loader Bot will remember this* 
---
No, its not an mmo.
---
Most trading is organized out of game.
---
I'm not saying he wasn better geared, not that as a wanted person you weren't at a disadvantage, but when it comes to pvp level only matters to 50.
---
[https://variety.com/2019/gaming/news/video-games-cvaa-accessibility-law-1203099440/](https://variety.com/2019/gaming/news/video-games-cvaa-accessibility-law-1203099440/)
---
You dont have to comply with the CVAA if you dont have any form of chat. So basically the law intended to make communication more accessible for those with disabilities resulted in game developers simply just not adding any form of communication. 
---
Well, this time everything IS heavier in the future. Just look at this 0.1 pound bobby pin..
---
Don't forget that all those abilities need to be enabled passively without perk cards, so there's still room to use perk slots on other better, more important things.
---
Yes, I get annoyed with pointless suggestions that have the potential to delay new content and lower server performance.
---
"Half of the game is still broken at the moment so implementing anything right now wouldn't be smart."
---
You're literally making my point for me here.  Yes, lots of things are broken.  And you're asking for them to ADD cars to that list of broken things.  Meanwhile we have vaults that aren't open.  We have player vending that's not in yet.
---
"And pubg has it fixed. Also cod has it flawless Bethesda should be able to make it happen."
---
Does PUBG or COD have thousands of AI enemies running around?  24 player made bases with AI turrets?  Hundreds of active quest lines that can trigger at a moments notice and spawn in waves of AI enemies?  Nukes that change entire zones into new flora and enemies within 30 seconds of hitting?  You're comparing "shooter" games with very LOW overhead on server resources to "survival" games with very HIGH overhead on resources.
---
Amen brother!
---
im a 75, have encountered 3 and killed just one. same as you.
---
I'd settle for the limit of half-life as it approaches three, that at least we might get hl2 episode 3.
---
Because to get a decent legendary you usually need to farm, and farming is a joyless, soul-sapping experience. 
---
I still farm almost all of my legendaries, but because I'm starting up a store this weekend I go to all of the popular trade vendors and pick up any fair to middling pieces people sold. You get some good stuff sometimes. And then also I use the discords to pick up random three star armors and two starred explosive weapons
---
I am with you. Every weapon I own is a product of my own grind. 
---
I had a 2\* scorch in the ski outfit yesterday on the slopes with the lift.
---
My main (who is shelved) didn't trade.
---
My alt did trade, he's shelved at level 72 as its boring as sin.
---
Grass is greenee effect is real.
---
When new content comes out I'll make a 3rd and not trade
---
Ha, it can be a bit overwhelming, getting used to the systems in the game. :) There is a vendor in Flatwoods - where the first story quest should take you. They're all robots, and each robot for one of the game's factions has 200 caps. Items generally only sell for around 1 to 20 caps each, so just accumulate caps slow and steady. Nearby, there is another vendor from a different faction at Sutton Station. (And as a helpful FYI - The various train stations function as good "safe zones," as enemies generally stay away from them.)
---
You can bulk items at the tinkerer's desk / station. This is also where you craft ammo. Bulking items requires around 10 to 30 of the substance you're bulking - wood, steel, glass, etc. - along with 2 pieces of plastic. For this reason, you should tag Plastic so you acquire plenty of it out in the world. (To tag junk for search, go to Junk in your Pip-boy's inventory screen, and then there should be an option for component view.) 
---
As long as you help with the SBQ you should be fine. The issues is when you show up tag once then wait or only farm mobs.
---
At one point I had a ton of mods for Fallout 4. One included "working girls". I made a bar in sanctuary with a singer, and all the ghouls dancing your little heart desired. The best thing about it was the neon sign outside, "LIVE NUDE GHOULS".
---
It was undoubtedly the finest bar in all the commonwealth. 
---
Where do we draw the line then? I disagree. ZERO tolerance
---
I almost had a lawn with a girl who had the nickname Hyena
---
I can agree with the spirit of what you say. 50 nuke zones full of tse weapons tell me the market got trashed. I also have 2 characters, both high level, with a solid set of legendary gear. I even have a couple decent weapons. 
---
I do self limit.  Hell my second character is a pistol build.  But to pretend anyone found themselves a god roll, and is selling it for 500 caps? No way.
---
Yeah, the scienc-y weapons are terrible that way. I have a 1 star furious gatling plasma that I can only run 2 cores through before it breaks. Of course, that can kill 4 scorchbeasts or take a giant chunk out of an sb queen, but then I have to switch to other weapons.
---
I hate the fact that they can fasy travel chase you. It just feels wrong. It feels griefing. Yeah I get that you and I as the Wanted players used it first, but we're using it to flee, they're using it to chase us. It would be different if we could hide or even had a circular zone around us on the map instead of a bright red blinking bulls-eye down to our exact location. AND they don't take any damage until they shoot first. I mean we might as well just AFK in a field somewhere and wait to get killed. If the bounty game is that stacked against us, might as well make it no fun for them.
---
And I think if the Wanted system is left like this, you *will* start to see Wanted players just saying "fuck it" and not fighting back. Then the bounty hunters won't have any fun out of it either. Lose-lose.
---
Not sure if you can tbh, didn't want t try myself as there's a giant portrait of it on the wall so as my All Rise hoovered over its head I could see the big soppy looking eyes from the pic staring at me :(
---
Plus no recipes needing cat meat yet so i let it live :)
---
I'm reading 'tse' as in Russian/French/German take your accent pick villain saying "Bring us tse kitty claws!"
---
I think over 60 is probably not scoffed at.  Under 40 definitely gives me the itch to PK.  Heavy gunner is also a plus.
---
I think that this should be a feature of legendary protest signs.   They wouldn't have special bonuses.   They would just be customizable.
---
Each armor part is seprate as far as unlocks go so legs chest an arms
---
I can't speak for every group but as far as my little band of miscreants and I are concerned the more help the merrier. Just don't be one of the barn lurkers and we're all good. 
---

---
Same. I had all them carefully placed on shelves all around my home. I dream of the day we can actually place things down. Even if it means risking them being stolen I would still like to be able to actually show off my collection.

All you have to do is drop the atom painted power armor and somebody else can use it. I would be careful though, my friend got banned for trading atom shop painted pa

As long as you get in there and don’t hide out in the bunker most people appreciate the help. 
---
Can't want to here the results 
---
Made myself a stealth pistol build alt. Way more fun for everything but queen grinding.
---
I’m a big believer we need more chaos amongst players to make the game more exciting 
---
will shortly 
---
You can craft them at tinker bench. How did you get a string?
---
Best way to PvP for those that want it is to take over already-owned workshops. 
---
Queen is always for everyone high enough in the server. Don't worry, they want you there! If you're not hurting the SBQ then try to make sure the additional monsters are staying away from the heavy hitters
---
I already had one friend quit because he's bored due to lack of new content.  He didn't quit because of bugs.
---
My other friend is thinking about quitting because of lack of new content.  He isn't going to quit because of bugs.
---
Half the people I traded with, met, added to my friends list don't PLAY any more.  My friends list is 90% offline most of the time.
---
Let them focus on FUN things to do.  They'll eventually fix stupid things like this perk. 
---
The current state of this game is making it much harder for me to defend Bethesda. As a fan of the franchise I'm mining for positive elements in order to convince myself that this game isn't that bad.
---
I have one from the Mr  Fuzzy tokens. 
---
Was she a super villain in training?
---
I enjoy farming, I've only been playing for little over two weeks and I've just been farming my way to level 82 so far. All my armor is 3 stars and I found them all myself.
---
All THAT and a turret? Color me impressed.
---
Funny, the title of your thread had me expecting something about the cannibalism perk and nonexistent children... 
---
There is a thread on this sub with a datamined spreadsheet of all plans in the game.  (Search will pull it up.). I don’t recall stealthboy, nor jetpack, either as mods or plans.  And reactive isn’t working, so don’t waste time on that til they fix.
---
ammo crafting workbench you can make paddle balls. How did you get the string?!
---
Got you homie that'll be 20.99 or 20.98 with ea pass. I can also give you ultra laser beams so when you fry enemies you can eat them without disease
---
tried to put in a ticket. it looks like even my Bethesda account is affected as i changed my password last night via a reset by Bethesda and still cant login . my only option was to respond directly to the email
---
You can go all over the map and find some that are white/non-aggro.  Even near fissure prime.  The one that flies over The Forest is always non-aggro.  If you have any Sneak perks or armor at low level the best thing to do if you see a red one remotely near you is to freeze in place (while sneaking) and don't move until it flies past you.  They have very high perception.  If you try to walk they will spot you and kill you.  When you decide to go to Savage Divide I strongly advise against taking the southern way (the area east of the dry lake bed) around because there's an aggro one down there that patrols the entire southern pass.  Going up the ski lift path from White Powder Sports is the easiest way in.
---
Not. Yet. I rarely go over there anymore haha it's so... sad. They missed a huge opportunity to do something with that station. Hopefully dlc :) 
---
Yet it unlocked chest off arms? so should I keep scrapping arms?
---
From what I understand not all bottleheads stack. I know explosive does which is what they probably used
---
There is trading. Communication on consoles is through a mic.
---
Much more of a snipers perk honestly.
---
Is it just a paddle or is there a string with it ? How many tokens does it take?
---
soon . give me 15 to respond to you guys 
---
if that doesnt help let me know i can post a vid on Instagram of how i have it arranged. 
---
War. War never changes. Especially when you plant your camp right on top of a rare spawning ground.
---
Uh does it count if you sell guns or armor off for 10-25k and have it come back around to you for 300-500 caps in a week?  
---
agreed
---
Unfortunately the game isn't in a decent enough state for a free weekend.  Which is sad for an AAA game.
---
Depends on the spawn.  I have a 1 and a 50 :)
---
check it out!

Noticed this too. Same things for me loading in. I've filed crash reports and commented many times on other threads since the patch about the new issues of sudden crash to desktop issues, and server disconnects, and incredible lag. A lot of my game time that I am able to play is spent with repeatedly trying to hit enemies that either don't register the hits because of lag or freeze in place for several seconds before animating for a few seconds and then freezing again on repeat.  
---
Maybe running several instances of the game on one PC could be your issue. I have one mule account, and I do get lag sometimes if I'm running both, and the random disconnect. I play on average four hours most evenings, with maybe one disconnect. 
---
Yep they have, becouse some fucking bag. People are crazy.
---
Thanks for the reply! Even though I'm 165 I have almost exclusively used PA and all the other stuff I paid attention to was Weapon Mods
---
if i was duping . then i wouldn't be bitching about my 60 dollars . nuff said 
---
They need to buff the frame rate on ps4 for heavy weapons. Every time I fire one my fps drops to single digits
---
Happy to hear that! It was nice talking to you!
---
Please. No oppressors. No nononono onono
---
give me 15 
---
Tesla Rifle. Sometimes it just breaks and deals 300 damage to an entire crowd of enemies. I love it. 
---
looks like it 
---
I recommend not moving at all any movement freezes me everytime while i get slapped by a super mutants dick.
---
You are legendary thank you so much :)
---
Thank you.
---
they ask you to keep your response short soooooo lol
---
On Xbox one I can't sprint without the framerate chugging or freezing for a few seconds, but it would be funny to see the car hit something tiny like a rock on the road or a paper bag someone dropped and the car flipps and explodes, or you just see 2 people sitting down but moving really fast by you in the car that decides to be invisible randomly
---
You are fantastic!
---
Gotta set an upper limit to fix per day, otherwise those damn dirty dupers will fix it too fast
---
I drool for the lvl 1 versions. Best way to get our low level friends into the SBQ / WS Nuke events!
---
Bought one for my bedroom yesterday. Might go back for the princess bed.
---
Cave-dwelling Santa for the win.
---
I see that you've never been one-shot by a glowing deathclaw in a nuke zone, I didn't even see it coming.
---
Fun fact, the average power armor is already about 150 feet tall, this is due to the fact that the Fallout universe takes place in a reality of giants. 
---
Pretty sure it's the actual weapon, the paddle ball. The string is the ammo. Its 50 tokens.
---
There was a post a while back with values for unlocking mods.  I want to say that the data found suggested the armor mods are significantly less common to unlock than weapons...which is exactly my experience.
---
Charging barrel is stupidly good. Hell I like the default one either way, but that +30-40 damage from the charging barrel is hard to pass up. Also good for tagging mobs in nukes 
---
I've got healing factor, stimpacks are not a worry, also get a ton of them just killing ghouls at whitesprings or raiding the safe in watoga.  
---
They need to drop up to 3 star gun/armor for each event and I'd do them, even the really boring ones like killing rogue farmer bots in the safe zone.
---
So far 100% drop rate :(
---
He’s lying

Its a Apeman 1080p, but they also do a 4k version. Got it for half price in an Amazon sale last year. [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B077XWM9NJ/ref=dp\_cerb\_1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B077XWM9NJ/ref=dp_cerb_1)

Thanks! Does it matter what we break down? Or just keep making the cheapest version and hope for the best?
---
Make a glider outta scorchbeast wings
---
The reason why excavator doesn't get the paint jobs is because its a new unique mesh. 
---
The solution you are proposing would be about 10 times as much work to implement over simply making a fitting texture for the excavator power armor.
---
Honestly i don't really know why they didn't make one.. Prob just laziness.
---
If you are on pc you could simply replace the meshes and textures for the excavator with one of the other power armor designs and then replace the "paint" textures with one of the designs you like through modding.
---
(i put a new skin on my x01 power armor every week or so, i only use it for nukes though, and i've never even bothered with the excavator since i don't like its looks.)
---
This still wouldn't allow you to select the paint ingame though, for that Bethesda would have to write new scripts which i'm pretty sure they won't be doing :P
---
If you are on console.. well you are at the mercy of the developers
---
It's dupers.  They have thousands of bobbleheads.  So stacking 100 or so isn't even a problem for them.
---
They need to ban more dupers and make it so bobbleheads don't stack.
---
You deserve ALL of the Karma!
---
This happens pretty much every time and I’m certain it’s spawning underneath the map it happens with bloatflys for me when logging in. (PS4)
---
Screws seem to be the most abundant resource for me, I consta you sit at around 400 and I seem to sell 100 every session 
---
Lobber only seems to be available as spawned.  Weird idea, not sure what the intended use is.  #weirdwasteland :)
---
It was pretty late at night, so I wonder if the number of players in general has anything to do with it. 
---
Scrap all armor.  Mods unlock for whatever pieces you're scrapping.
---
Hope that helps :)
---
I just right now got an email saying they are looking into my appeal. 
---
I had to buy the .50 cal plan.  I think the one I have is the refined .50 cal too.  I came across it I think at Top of the World.  Either that or Lewisburg/Welch.  I've only been to Savage Divide/Forest/Toxic Valley.
---
Nice! Would be great for leveling new characters
---
I've unlocked most of the handmade mods this way; I've only seen \~5 handmade rifle drops in the "wild," whereas I've probably scrapped 50+ that I've made myself.
---
So...a Gundam?
---
Flying and roaming imagination 🤣👍
---
I use posedian energy plant and set up an extractor.
---
Build 10 -20 handmades and lever actions to scrap for mods and see if you feel the same way. 
---
If everything was that easy why even play?   Has to be limits to resources either by stash size or scarcity.  
---
These are in the Whitespring bunker right? I have not progressed far enough in the quest to access that yet.
---
Are you on PC? I dropped by this, or some other, monorail camp, within the past few days.
---
It's taken a lot of time to figure out what does and does not drain the CAMP budget.
---
See yes ofc every one wants that stuff...no one wants to wait 18 months for it though. 
---
I'd take mounts that didn't even give a speed increase as I know it would crap out the servers. 
---
7 Dys to die isn't a fair example or comparison though is it really. Bethesda is a huge huge company FO76 had 130 developers working on it, whilst getting most of the assets and game play from a game that they already produced and sold 4 years prior.
---
7 days to die was literally mole man working in his basement, sold the publishing rights to tell tale for console and gave it about as much support as the 130 dev strong team has for FO76.
---
I get what your saying and that the game needs to be more stable before adding in new stuff and when they do add new stuff it needs to be worth while not just mounts / skins etc. But using 7 days to Die as an example isn't fair. Bethesda is a huge animal in terms of developing games that have already done 3 previous fallout titles with the same engine and 7 days to die couldn't be more indie if it tried.
---
How I wish you could run a store by grinding and selling.  There was a huge chunk of the game completely removed by the massive deflation of legendaries.
---
There is none afaik
---
I’ve been lucky to pay under 6500 caps for any god roll. Given there is a huge amount of people who have TSE. I personally have found a TSE in the past. I traded it off for a rifle I needed on my rifle build. TSE is obsolete now. I use a bloodied explosive now. And you talk about something hard to find and expensive? Jeez. Some of my stuff may have been cheaper than I should’ve been but I now have the weapon Arsenal I need to get by. My next goal is bloodied explosive weapons and some sentinel assassin armor. Extremely hard to find but if I come across it, I’ll pay whatever I have to pay within reason for it. I come across god roll melee weapons fairly regularly. Bloodied with swing speed is fairly common imo. I have a decent arsenal of melee and guns. I’m actually working on an unarmed build since I recently got some good unarmed items and want to test the build. I pass my armor between the characters I’m playing at the time. I was mainly stating someone isn’t considered a cheater for playing the game as it is intended. Bethesda knew about the dupe for well over a month and proceeded to do nothing about it. It did cause an issue in the market but it was their fault for not fixing a game breaking exploit on the spot. The community that used the exploit took advantage of a situation that they seen as opportunistic. And to be honest I would rather have that glitch back over the new one that is crashing servers. 
---
Level 1 explosive pipe weapon is a helluva headstart.
---
Another video from the World Record using the camera. Great for the price and better for bright days than overcast ones i have found.

---
Is Beth even aware of the bobbleheads?  It'd be nice to hear at least a 'we are aware of it' type message so we know it's going to get patched.  Compared to the dupes that should be easy to fix. 
---
Wouldn't it be nice... if this exact same request didn't pop up as a new thread every day?
---
(But yes, it would be very nice to display stuff)
---
Same. I just found the helmet plans there last night.
---
My understanding is that its not supposed to matter what level the scrapped item was.
---
plus the glowing blood pack for another +75
---
Wait. Wait. Wait. Are you for real? Why haven’t I ever noticed that 
---
Haha I know the feeling.  I code from home so have trouble working out what day it is 😂
---
If you're selling ammo 2 for a cap, just do half for 1 cap each, and after they buy those, put the rest up free. (Putting free things first is never really going to work out unless you're using a trading subreddit with a karma system and proof)
---
That would be cool but they can’t even get vertibirds to fly right in this game so idk vehicles lol.
---
Yep.  Set it so the same type of Bobblehead cant be stacked.  Different types are fine, but ffs, this seems like it should be an easy fix and they shouldnt make us wait for another massive update.  Do a hot fix for one or two major bugs while you work on a major release.  
---
And obviously, get rid of cheaters AND the ability to cheat.  Tons of youtubers showing exactly how to dupe.  Sure they can duplicate (phrasing) the issue @Bethesda, just fix it already.  
---
Sorry about that
---

I am lvl 100 and still haven't found a legendary gun that fits my build. 
---
I still rock crafted weapons.
---
The worst for me was having the game crash while battling the Scorched Queen at half health. Waisted loads of ammo for nothing. I've even had the game crash right after my own death so I lost my paper bag filled with ALL the material I was farming at the time. It's soul breaking to say the least. 
---
It’s not unrealistic to fix the crashing. The fact that I’ve never crashed within 50 hours of playtime shows that it’s possible for them to fix the issue in its entirety
---
Only brotherhood paint job in the game currently is Initiate for T-60
---
No fast travel.  Sleep required.  No magic stash access. No magic restocking of world items / containers.  No mules.
---
I want a bumblebear!!!
---
Toilet paper. I collect the rolls of TP. I imagine a nice big shelving unit with roll upon roll of pristine tp sitting in a bathroom in my house. 
---
Then, i end up needing to scrap for space.
---
I was expecting it to be slick and seamless like ESO. But now I've grown to love the clunkiness of it.  No horses or other critters to ride, just slogging your way home, overencumbered and thirsty.  Still fantasy, but gritty and real.  I cant wait to see it in a year or two!
---
I share your pain.  I love collecting these bears and would love to have a way to display them in my CAMP without someone stealing them from me.  Unfortunately I've found that many of the bears I've saved to my stash have been inadvertently consumed by crafting efforts.  Looking forward to Bethesda giving us a way to keep the bears and display them in our CAMP.
---
Craft hard to get weapons (10mm submachine gun/lever-action/handmade rifle) for low level players/characters and mod them up.
---
You use the word "accidentally" like my seven-year-old son does.
---
Use that bloodied gun, run low hp, throw some perks into pistol and buy an adrenal serum. You’ll drop everything your level in 1 hit ezpz 
---
That seems like a lot of work when I should be able to just set any price.
---
Some general tips :)
---
If you're lower level at prime, clear the mobs out so high DPS can focus on the queen.  I have a high dps melee character and frequently I have to stop hitting the queen to turn around and 1 shot whatever scorched, cricket, or other enemy that's slowly ticking my health down behind me....lol
---
If you're higher level help with the queen.
---
IMPORTANT:  Stay away from player bases, fixed in-game bases, groups of trees, and fissure openings.  The queen will not land if there's no clear area underneath her.  So your melee is useless for DPS and just stands there fighting trash mobs.  Also if you're near the fissure, the melee takes longer to get to the queen, and has to constantly stop and check that they're not going to walk into the permanent death lose all loot fissure.
---
Yes.  You are the only one.
---
(Level 50 Grognak*, anti-armor.  Can't remember if it was nuked or not Whitesprings but it dropped right when my fire axe broke so was doubly amazing)
---
Right, that's a TSE, and mine a TS.  It's been offered to me many times to trade or buy a TSE, but I want to find one...I dont see any fun in buying my way through the game.
---
I have power patcher 3* and fix it good 3*, not a problem at all =)
---
It's a niche situation, just do the best with what you have.
---
stop being an asshole. God damn. 
---
You'd get banned
---
So you want new content cause your friends quit playing?
---
What if they now come up with new content lets say a vault opens... New weapons new armor... everything gets duped or doesnt work like it should and then again everyone will hate on this game and quit again.
---
"Are you here to watch the video, or are you just here for my s o o t h i n g v o i c e?"

i was bummed that I could only pacify the cat there that looks like mine IRL, not tame
---
IDK how true it is beings I have never received one but apparently doing the quest that requires you to put in the technical data will net you a paint job for some of the PA you get in the game. It's completely rng and by extreme chance. but that what I've been hearing on the xbox one lfg. Take with a grain of salt. Just telling you what I heard
---
And of course I spelled challanges wrong my bad.
---
the most i remember bulking in the last 2 days was like 300 something steel. 
---
&gt;Why should I rely on a third party website for establishing player factions?
---
I personally hate it, seems like a disgusting meme but here ya go:
---
PC Master raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace nooooooooob! Console plebs can't even get on reddit trolololol
---
I keep seeing posts "Don't do (insert common gameplay) or else it breaks the game!" Its just sad.
---
Yeah, I do that all the time for free to whoever I come across.
---
Trying to work out Bethesda logic is like a rubix cube :/
---
my thoughts exactly 
---
Unable to see Imagur at the moment, is this the pup on the cliff overlooking the Harper's Ferry Bridges?
---
for now, either set up around the airport or Sutton so you can fast travel for free. Later, when you have the resources and want to build your *forever home* look for a resource node (I prefer junk) next to water in an area you like to farm.
---
You may have a disease.  Sludge Lung does that to me.
---
Oh yeah, you get rads in 76 storms too. It's awesome and I wanna know where they come from. Like, the source of water that causes the storms to form. Must have some gnarly mutated sea monsters)) 
---
What are the legal implications if I render **your** character as nude against your will? This feels like a amusing news story if nothing else.
---
This game is so fucking broken it’s pathetic. But I’m even more pathetic because I’m hopelessly addicted 
---
Where’s the cat???😱😱 and where would I find the dog as well?
---
Thank you so much for the time and effort you and others put into this list. Now all we can hope for is enough upvotes for bethesda to take notice. Also I'm sure you've already done this, but I highly recommend you copy and save both your original post and your comment in a word document so you have it for future use as well. Great list! 
---
Bosses in general is the main thing lacking from the game. at the moment there's only one 'boss' and that's the SQ. There should be multiple types, all hard to kill with decent loot at the end of it. Currently I can take out a Level 91 Glowing Deathclaw with two bullets.
---
The enemies need buffing if they're meant to be mythic status.
---
Honestly it was
---
too many quests that I cant complete because of an invisible enemy or an enemy stuck inside a wall I can't damage. Good stuff. 
---
No it's on PC too, happened to me. I was transferring ammo from my stash to character. Can't remember what caliber.
---
Other languages have a more generalized word for "the group of y'all" but in English "you" has colloquially replaced "thou" for addressing groups.
---
With that said you would be right to criticize me for never remembering your names. You could immediately reply to me in another thread i wouldn't remember you - all i care about are ideas.
---
Can you post apicture of the reaponse email? There are tons of people here who think the bans are not real
---
I had a lady try to sell me some of the ammo, give me some free ammo, then I buy the rest. It was crazy. I just told her to set the price on one round for the total and I’ll buy, then the rest for free. Stick to Market or bazaar, we haven’t had any troubles in those. It’s a nice community and we see the same people often. Bromorin said it the way it usually goes, but it would be shit to buy one round for hundreds of caps and that player bails. But karma system is good. 
---
FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits are the place to trade.  You'll find lots of players buying, selling, trading items there.
---
It definitely helps if you have a mic.  It makes trades go a lot faster / smoother.  Even if you have trouble with english, still try to use your mic.  I'd rather have someone mis-pronounce words and use weird phrases...........instead of staring silently at a person wondering what they want and why they won't talk to me.....lol
---
If you can say "no", "yes", "want sledge", "lower price", etc that's about all you need :)
---
I can't figure out what you want via emotes.  No matter how many times you wave and heart emote at me.....lol
---
You can though, I trade from lots of shops on discord and reddit. Things I currently use, too. Real dupers moved onto cash money.
---
I craft and scrap for mods. In working on gusts rifle plans as we speak
---
I sent them a tweet to let them know, reported the players using the stacked BH.  They know.  Never got a response though.
---
yeah
---
Why wasnt this done prior to releasing the game?
---
Go to watoga, enter the municipal building. Go to the top of that building. Jump off the building down to another rooftop on the side of the elevator you came up in. There’s a power armor there. Turn 180° from that power armor, and jump over to that roof. If you don’t have marsupial, there’s a fire escape that takes you up. Go to the vertibird on that building. There’s a power armor there. Drop down and go to the other downed vertibird by the center of watoga. There’s another power armor there. And if you want, check Phoenix for weapons/mods
---
Join and enjoy.
---
how's that being an ass hole?
---
Asking why Bethesda seem to assume our patience? Paid for a product looking for some answers is all.
---
If the community managers did there job properly there wouldn't be so much hate for Bethesda.
---
Just cause your opinion is different doesn't make you right. Bethesda even said before Xmas they would be better at communicating and be more open with there customers (the people that give them monies). When does that start exactly?
---
Mine is just always dead. To mole miners. Or mongrels. I don’t understand why random camp attacks are so frequent. Are water pumps that offensive to wasteland critters?
---
Happy, Thatday! Yay it's Thatday of the week!
---
TGIThatday!
---
neither do mine .sometimes i hear the noise even if it didn't go through . im not sure about other crafting iv only been using the ammo bench the past two days . it may not just be bulking items too fast or too much . it could also be related to the amount of bulk items i had on me . i distinctly remember picking up 30 bulk plastic off a death bag. which i found to be an unusually high amount when talking about anything . but i picked it and everything else up in the bag because im so used to doing so .and because i needed the free bulk .who wouldn't pick it up ?  
---
Thanks, we just need way more world bosses and for them to be a lot stronger. Any TSE can one or two shot Level 90 creatures atm. I used to really fear running into a Deathclaw, now I just see it as free instant exp
---
I have the same exact issue, but for all the power armor in that quest! I have more than enough to build at least 2 or 3 pieces, just keeps saying I can’t build it, and I’m a level 30. 
---
I’ll try. I’m not good with the interwebs. I have an old man brain. 
---
Do like I do, kill everything and make sure it won't get back up, then loot.
---
Yoooo wait up there's vendors?!?
---
You must be either a hardcore player or innocent.  Either way I wouldn't have came back.  Especially if I was innocent.  Good luck to you, and yes i do enjoy the game.
---
Yes I am!
---
Not fun at level 90 either
---
I will sell you a Hunters Longcoat for retail
---
If you set an item twice, remove it, set it again, it blue screens the buyers game.

Got a two shot missile launcher recently

well this game is dead i was pushing lvl 300 but  there taking out the 2 shots explosives out of the game (btw its the only viable build) and just not puting enuf content in the game the only only way to save that game is to release private servers other then that this game is doomed
---
How do we put them back? I found myself looting a crib with a shrine to a dead child last night and I stopped for a minute to try and put it back but it just gave me a sodding paper bag.
---
Not all challenges can be easily defeated at low level and it's not your private server :) 
---
I am constantly selling or dropping it to keep my levels at or under 100. I don't do anything specifically to pick it up. I have my CAMP NW of Watoga, NW of Sunshine Farms, between those two firebases NE of Fort Defiance. I typically maintain those firebase turrets, seek out Scorchbeasts, take on scorched, super mutants, ghouls, all around the SE of the map. I also farm Whitesprings a fair amount, both in and out of blast zones. I do an occasional nuke silo run. I hit almost every vendor faction, almost every day, so I'm hitting Harpers Ferry, and Lewisburg/R&amp;G, or Sutton &amp; Flatwood (where I sometimes farm lead, along with Charleston). I regularly do Uranium Fever for legendaries and scrap, and Census Violence trying to get that shielded marine underarmour. I do a mix of other events as I stumble into them.

Imagine the graphics how sharp, and a new set list of 40’s standards songs that you’ve heard 3 times in one hour. I’d still buy it 
---
Ps4, sorry I forgot that
---
Man that's awful! Sorry to hear that, but hopefully when the new pvp mode comes out, there will be less briefing in the regular mode! 
---
No.... Just the helmet. I wish those spacesuits in-game did something combined with the helmet, but it's just costmetic. The helmet DOES prevent airborne diseases and doesn't have the -2 PER like the other helms/masks. Very nice indeed) I still use my Mole Mask anyways haha I want the Owl/Mothman mask so bad... 
---
By "annoyed", you mean stealth promoting their content. This post will show on Google. People will search YouTube and give those guys clicks. You're basically letting those dudes use you as a tool to get their name and content out there. Its Naive to think that your complaining does any thing other than help them. 
---
Maybe crashed after dying or something like that. Drops all your junk and can't get back on the same server. Or maybe it's possible with some crashes that your character is still in the works briefly and can die? I don't know. I've never had inventory rolled back from a crash more than 2 or 3 minutes.
---
I just want to be able to play the game long enough to make progress. Is that's too much to ask? I guess... 
---
Thank you)

Wth are u doing at the bog as lvl 26

Well good luck 👍 hopefully I hear something soon too

Great list!  Also, I think the beaver on the gurney in the Ranger office is a reference to an episode of the [adult swim] show Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell, where Gary's head is surgically attached to a beaver body.
---
Morrowind has never had vehicles, your closest bet is a radstag to sit on a saddle and walk straight up the walls of the high rises in watoga.  The engine is already in a full body cast....

What system are u on? Need to get better weapons to defend yourself and your base. Duper’s went crazy with explosive weapons. Gotta fight fire with Fire they will leave ya lone 
---
I know a couple of ways to crash the buyer but I also don’t abuse it. You can trade a person an excessive amount of maps and it’ll cause both players to crash. That does sound like a shitty bug though. 
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.
---
It's not hard to get what you want there.  Just gotta put forth time and effort.
---
Plus it gives you something to do, become a trader, that's pretty decent content :)  I trade all the time now.  I'm working on getting new weapons, armor, crafting recipes, etc.
---
I play on X-box. 
---
It was the first and I probably won't do it again. I appreciate the offer but I will continue to try my luck. 👍

This post might show up on the 10000th result page of someone googled fo76 going free to play. Get real.

As far as I know.

ya . i see a few people post about this and get down voted too . im sorry to hear that . hopefully you hear something before i do . if so post it here please . thanks for the kind words

Random drops... two shot explosive shotgun, of any level, even 25, would be capable of destroying a camp quickly.

Isn't it the case that many events don't actually start until a player is near the location? Like the Grafton events or the prison events Patrol Duty/Jail Break for example. But Grafton has always has people going to it since it's one of the early towns people go to and kind of a quest hub, so events there seem to get triggered very often. I think I've only ever noticed the prison events active on my map twice, but they often start up when I get there. But since people are always going to Grafton, it seems like there's an event active there half the time.
---
I've just stopped going to that train station to sell stuff because I can only hear "Iiittt'ssss Graaafton Daaay!" so many times.

I had to google what that was. The app? lol

That's quite presumptuous of you.

I've killed a number of players that used the carry weight perk for junk and carried *all* their junk on them.

Just yesterday some guy picked a lock at my workshop and left me 10-20 stacks of almost every bulk material when I blew him up.
---
Nice guy.
---
I'm a fan of fallout as well, have pre ordered all previous fallout games i could for me and my kids. Not any more though.

This is what happens when fans defend mediocrity, cash grabs, broken products,bad customer service and lie's. 
---
Companies begin to feel entitled to it and then act like they are above common decency when it comes to fixing there mess within a reasonable time frame.
---
Bugs in this game are the same as in Fallout 4....a 4 or 5 year old game. That's just wrong, especially as they even dared to call there demo a beta (what fixes made it into launch from the beta?)
---
Sure.  But I would never bulk LEAD, screws, springs, adhesive, gears, oil, ballistic fiber. 
---
I can sympathize with "over modding" myself. Been there.
---
Hopefully Bethesda gets this settled. I want to play again, but it's nowhere near ready.
---
That’s the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard considering that’s your only loss when you die. Sorry, just is.

Yeah. Just making a light joke. ;)

I have a screen shot on my iPhone but how do I post it? Do I need to host it somewhere and post a link?

Probable answer by bethesda: "hi, thanks for your feedback ~~(same than 20 people before yours before), we'll put it where we put the other ones before you: in the trash can~~  i'll forward it to our support team!
---
I have a feeling anti armor will be slightly better than TSE after the nerf.  If you use VATs, one that increases VATS crit damage might also be helpful.
---
On long drawn out fights, furious may be the better choice.  TS will still be better for triggering on hit things like 4 leaf clover.

Once you have a few perks maxed out it makes life easier. Armorer, weapon smith, white knight, fix it good, weapon artisan to name a few. That with knowing where to look and how much you tend to need to keep around things balance out, but it is effing dumb that you can lot and scrap two dozen working shotguns and rifles and somehow not have the materials to make one broken like weapon work properly. You can tell me to cram my opinion but it's still baloney.
---
I use Imgur
---
Most of them have a train engine icon on the map. There are a handful of others that are in marked and unmarked buildings, and a couple that walk around. Each vendor belongs to a faction, each faction has a cap pool(shared across all faction vendors) of 200 that resets daily. There are 7 factions, so if you're trying to get all 200 caps out of each faction, you can get 1400 caps a day. Advanced shit, just in case you were going to ask about it.

Why would nayome need that when Two-shot explosives are a thing?

Damn I am on PS4 would have gave u something for free to fight them assholes when they come around

Some gamers can't really handle their sig others' gaming habits truth be told.  And use ridicule and whatnot to just get it back to the olden days before you played games.  Just them. 
---
Don't take it personally like they were attacking your ability to play games. They prolly sucked too in certain aspects as well from time to time I'm sure.  
---
I think either they were jealous you were getting involved too much with the games and taking up their time with the games heh. Or they needed to just pad their ego and usurp their e-peen was greater then yours.. 
---
Either or both catagory pre-teen behavior. Nothing to see or hear. Move along. 😀
---
My gf is getting into games now finally. I have been making it a point to include more and more stuff to try to broaden her horizons with gaming in general. (Not usually anything but candy crush etc).
---
Now she is wanting to try out dark souls, adventure games.. even turn based and real time.. she might not be as fast at it now. But I would never want to encourage her not to keep trying. That is a sign of a weak partner to begin with.
---
Your supposed to support. Not restrain or put down. Sad times. 
---
What's your build and platform? Im drowning in stuff I want to give away.
---
Do you get a bounty for jacking a workshop?
---
I tried to nuke her and it didn't work.

For me, it's been the Ultracite Rusty Knuckles. Every damn time.

Simple rule of thumb. If you didn't drop it hit queen only when the roamers are not up clear the roamers quick so the core that dropped it can maintain focus. Odds are now high that the person that dropped it could easily solo duo or 4 man the queen.  If you are rolling with a group like I do we can kill the queen before it finishes saying completed death from above.  So honestly I doubt you will have even gotten a shot off on her.   
---
But honestly if you have dps and bullets hit her the more players the longer she is up. I've had one where we almost had her killed like down to the O in her name and like 12 others spawned in and it took another 5 minutes to kill her since most were hazmat scrubs. (meaning lower than level 45)  
---
The only people I have a problem with for play style is the useless level 30s running around getting people killed. Oh that guy is higher than me and I am being chased lets run right into them with their 50 cal tse and get them killed...  
---
TL;DR Really it isn't an elitist event, just having low players you have to carry makes it the challenge, otherwise DPS and help clear the mobs if they pop. 
---
It just will require bear arms and ballistics perks at a high level.
---
Glitch has been around for months, sometimes happens when you spawn into a nuke zone
---
bruh I never even noticed lol.
---
Ammo is a big culprit most of the time. Drop missiles, 40mm rounds and mini nukes.
---
Next check your plans and recipes they waive. 25 each which adds up pretty quickly.
---
Lastly smelt any ores you have under misc players forget about them a lot as well. 
---
If you're still overweight at that point go thru your stash and get rid of junk that's really junk. Bone shards, extra cloth you dont need, glass, even crystal

I never keep wood in my stash since running around the forest for 10 minutes normally nets 100 or so scraps.

I scrapped an arm and got chest mod. Was very confused.

The wooden ski makes the ski sword? Ugh, seriously. Then why does it look like the composite ski when you have it in hand.

I agree PvP needs an overhaul. If I cant use my sneak attack to initiate combat then there is no point. Give me PvP/PvE servers already.

That's the obama armor anyway. The t51 has nuka cola and can be painted with atom shop. x01 has tricentennial and atom shop paint, or mix the protocol paintjob in.
---
Off topic but can you get rid of the wendigo in your name they cause nightmares.
---
I think the idea is the screws from dismantling a pipe gun break and can't be used as a screw in itself.
---
200 caps for a pool of vendors and a 25k cap limit seems like a weird thing to put in to an online game.
---
DCUO and other free 2 play games do it, but its usually to entice you spend on a sub or an item from there in game market that up's your limits.
---
Just seem's like it was put in to annoy and gate people though in fo76. I mean whats the other reason it could be?
---
And bloodied!

Claim a workshop at a power plant, drop an extractor on the uranium ore deposit, and let it start collecting the ore for you.  Once you have at least 5 uranium ore harvested, go to a chemistry workbench, selecting the smelting option, and then scroll down to the uranium section.  Smelting 5 uranium ore results in 2 nuclear materials, if I remember correctly. Just make sure you have acid in your inventory for the smelting process.
---
I dragged mine around the map for my first 40 levels. Just recently decided to build an actual base at  lvl 45, no reason to rush it.
---
I need all the blackberries, and cranberries, and brain fungus. Dont judge...
---
Every weapon me and my friends use were obtained legit.  We all run together and independently.  We trade items to who can use them the most... I'm really good with a lever rifle, so I get those.  We've got a heavy gunner, so I've given him some TS and TSE heavies I've found.  They've given me a TSE lever.  Doing it all on your own is just going to take longer.  Get some friends, nuke some ghouls and start collecting.
---
This is great. People on this sub are like: “What’s a lore? I want shit that looks cool and doesn’t fit in Fallout!”
---
Wait, you mean to say it’s like episode two ended in a climax and unfinished event to start off a new part of the series?!
---
Not sure how your chewing up screws I’m only level just reached level 100 and have over 100 screws probably More like 130 , do you play with power armour ? Do you build bases near junk piles ? And farm them do you take over resource bases and hold onto them, I continue to explore dungeons for more ? 
---
Do you use power armour I run with a level 50 set of excervator armour a one star legendary super sledge and melee my way into super screwdom? Do you farm super mutants ? There’s plenty of ways to get them iv contemplated selling mine to make room for lead and metal since I just build ammo and sell for 1 cap per round not sure how you can’t find any 
---
Depends on what you're fighting, I think. Getting stacks of 5 frequently from certain enemies can add up pretty quick compared to getting 1 from every fan you pick up.
---
You have a fundamental misunderstanding of what pacifism is if you don’t think you should take damage. Pacifism suggests the individual is against violence himself not that the person cannot be victim of violence.

This whole sub is just a huge list of terrorist demands disguised as player suggestions.

Since games release I have seen 3 patrol duty events. One of the few events worth doing since it gives weapon plans, yet it never occurs.

Shotgun, enforcer perk under agility. (30% chance to cripple, so 3-4 shots with any shotgun will cripple it) once landed and crippled they take a lot more damage.  Still a tough fight at lower levels but for the level 90s on here, y'all need to get on this cripple train.

I had this problem last night.  Fucking bees are hard to target!
---
On one hand, the notion of successfully firing an automatic weapon into a swarm of bees is ludicrous.
---
On the other hand, it's a good argument for carrying around a Flamer.
---
Ahhhh! I’ve had that distorted thing too, but then it just took me into the game. I tend to spend around 20 seconds as a floating head though! But with infinite loading I’ve found no other way to fix it than to unplug my Xbox

How long ago were you banned? I was hit on wed of last week and haven't gotten any response yet!

Could you please show me where I said that they have to fix THIS BUG before new content comes?

You didn't wanted it to be reported cause its a bug you like, that was what I dont understand. 
---
I never sell screws, springs or ballistic fibre, as I'm often short of these; but I keep a reserve of the other things and sell any excess. I haven't dropped below 100 adhesive sat bulked in my stash for weeks now so am considering reducing that reserve amount. Lead and oil, again I keep a reserve amount but if I suddenly need a large amount more than I have I'll go scaving for them. Doesn't happen that often and I like to keep my stash managed
---
The paddle ball is the ammo. It is crafted at the ammo workbench. So is the string and paddle two separate items that are require to craft the weapon or do you get the string when you get the paddle?
---
Hah, no it didn't. I said glitching is cool **sometimes**. And I think my bug bounty idea is a decent idea that gives incentive for not wrecking servers.
---
Well the decision to exclude a proper story or NPCs because, as Todd Howard stated, WE'RE the NPCs is an example of how out of touch they were with the gaming community when planning this game. It also feels like this "survivalist" gave was developed by a team that never even played one. It's mind boggling how this game is structured the way it is yet ESO is in the complete opposite of the spectrum. I've played ESO for over a year and had that game crash once in the entire time.

The online market is flooded with overpowered explosive weapons thanks to dupers. The economy and quality of the game has plummeted because of them. Most high level people have an assortment of them now and theres nothing that can be done about it except for the upcoming nerf bethesda is going to release. But even then the weapons will still be incredibly strong in pvp
---
Not really related, but the Mysterious Stranger has taken to showing up in his underwear. A lot.   🤷‍♂️
---
Every time I attempt to claim a workshop, around 2 minutes after I claim it I get disconnected from server.
---
thank you first time one of those things attacked me I forgot what game I was playing.
---
I ventured down to the south end of the savage divide the other day trying to get to Top of the World from the wrong angle(crouched the whole way around it because I knew I was out of my depth), saw the glowing green fissure at least 100m away, and noped all the way back to the north end, lmao. I didn't know Scorchbeasts spawned out of there at that time, but I knew it couldn't be anything good.
---
Ended up making it to Top of the World only to get stomped by a Scorched Controller as I was stepping out of the elevator. I was so confident too...
---
I got a downvote:( Yeah, I mean I don't have all these guns to test it myself, but from what I can tell AA will be my best bet. I know they have pretty good explosive resistance so I was wondering if I should try to avoid it in favour of some of the VATS perks instead.  
---
Plus it's hard to tell now before the nerfs, rn the TS one hits a lot harder and from what I can tell from other people's research furious has a cap of 30% damage boost I believe? 
---
I'm not sure, I've only seen the weapon there, and my buddy got the weapon. I'll ask him and get back to you.
---
Somebody said to take out all the junk in your stash and then put it back in, I tried that and it worked
---
i keep all the loot i find off death bags . the day before yesterday was the first time i had ran across so much bulk in one bag . not an absurd amount of everything . the highest was 30 bulk plastic 5 bulk copper 3 bulk steel. no unfortunately i have yet to find any such weapons in death bags. the closest lead i have on getting a hold of a tse . is a tse pistol i found at R&amp;G station a few weeks ago . but i think someone might have sold it to the vendor before i came in because non have spawned there since.
---
Funny, When I first heard the Freddie Lang holotapes, I thought she sounded much like Rose. Different inflection and enthusiasm, sure, but possibly once the same person?
---
It is not always another player.  Spawns are notoriously mismatched.  Even in events (such as defense) where i am the only player anywhere near, I can get enemy groups twice my level.  Or L3.  (These by definition are not left over from some previous visitor.)
---
U put that song in my head
---
I feel like all the random vendor and spawn interactions that encourage server hopping arent helping with this. Constantly forcing the server to load entire camps and terrain changes and inventory swaps cannot be good. I could be wrong...
---
Just give the damn vendors the entire list of mods (up the price if you want) might help.
---
Half the people server hopping are for vendors, the other half for mob spawn but I doubt thats able to be easily changed.
---
Funnily enough they are one of the best items to pick up to scrap. They give one of the better mat to weight ratios along with all the other toys.
---
I just want to be able to use my purified water for cooking recipes, that’s all. 
---
Didnt fallout 4 have a limit?
---
I’d have way too many screws 
---
Some events also end up bugged, so if the game doesn't let you fast travel to them, don't bother trying to get there by other means. I've seen this at least twice. The other day I tried fast traveling to Census Violence, so I click the icon, it asks if I want to pay 19 caps to travel to the event, and I say yes. Nothing happens. Try again, nothing. So I try fast travelling to the nearest location, almost on top of the event. I spend 12 caps to do so and it works fine. I follow the compass marker into the event area, I'm on top of the event icon on the map, but the robot is nowhere to be found. Out of curiosity I try clicking the event map icon again and try to fast traveling to it even though I'm standing right on top of it. Now it costs 39 caps. WTF. It shouldn't cost 39 caps to travel from any one part cranberry bog to another. My only guess is that an event somewhere else in the world spawned, but it got the wrong name and map marker, and the travel costs were based on the actual location, but for whatever reason that broke actually being able to fast travel to it.
---
I play on the PS4 and I am a  stealthy rifleman.
---
As much as I appreciate the offer though I'm going to have to refuse.
---
No offense to you at all. I'm quite sure you got your items fairly but I just can't trade with anybody with the risk of getting a duped item.
---
I understand I wouldn't get in trouble for purchasing one duped item but my conscience just does not allow me to even take the chance.
---
Even if it wasn't a duped item I would still feel "dirty" knowing there is a chance that it was.
---
I’m a hardcore fallout fan. Iv got a vaultboy tattoo. I have a whole wall of my house built to display my collection of merch.

I'm sure there will be more in the Atom Shop for $3-$5 a piece...

I made a post about this as well but figured it was also good to paste it here:
---
Ever since the most recent patch we now have a "double" loading screen. I know this is due to it loading the actual world and the second is to load your character in so you aren't attacked by random invisible enemies and the likes. I dont know about anyone else but this hasn't solved a thing. I still load in after the double loading to be a floating head with all my health/ap/hunger bars full or empty and not registering . To make matters worse, if I load into a world where my C.A.M.P cannot be placed after the load screen it gives me the pop-up telling me such but when I click OK the game freezes for a good 30 seconds. This makes it even more difficult then before the patch since now everything is loaded in but im frozen. Multiple times I have been dead on arrival since enemies/nuke zones are live and well while I am frozen in a dreamlike state awaiting the infamous "third" loading screen.
---
I have cleared my Cache and done everything accept for re-install.

Anyone else in this same boat as I?

I didn't realize there were red ones! That makes more sense. Guess it's good that I haven't run into those yet.

Some guy just handed me one last night, a TSE the dragon.  He said "these are getting nerfed so I don't want them" so yeah, that's one way to get them xD
---
Got it. Thanks. 
---
Graham could be a robot in people would like to find him it's not the fact that he is who he is it's just the fact these are random rare vendor that roams around.
---
The game could use some more random things like that rare kind of spontaneous or something you need to seek after maybe for some cool rare plans for your house yeah just some more carrots for us to Chase and be excited about

Oh wow, I thought for sure Rose was [Taryn Manning](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0543383/?ref_=tt_cl_t9) . (Pensatucky from Orange is the New Black)

One mini nuke can kill your camp.  100% mini nuke drop rate on the suicide super mutant outside of Wes Tek.  Camps get destroyed easily in this game but are repaired easily also.  Repair and move on lol

If I recall correctly the recent patch changed the PVP so that you will aggro all teammates when engaging in PVP and not just the target.

How about this?

VendorCaps = 100 + Level + 10\*Charisma + 50\*HardBargain
---
How to you know they're duped? Not every weapons being traded is a TSE shotgun. I've bought half a dozen or so legendaries and sold way more, none duped unless people are duping just TS heavy weapons, which I doubt because all of them took me days of looking over the market subreddits to find what I was looking for. 
---
You seriously need to take a break from whatever is making you so paranoid that you think all trading in the game is because of exploits.
---
Funny thing is they're asking for stuff like this in the Atom Shop that make no sense in Fallout instead of generic skins then they complain about lore inconsistencies.
---
I would love it if when I decapitate someone I could collect their head and display it on a shelf.
---
I guess other stuff too :P
---
Cant believe we need to discuss crap mechanics like leveled gear in a Fallout game at all, to be honest...
---
Gotta make it like other MMOs I guess. Yeah...because that whole genre is doing SO great these days...
---
Wear protection.
---
Haha, scared you into another game. I remember they were pretty terrifying during the beta. So I went in search of it. 
---
Fair enough, Im just a hoarder/farmer but I get not wanting to support dupers. 
---
It had a limit of 999,999 I believe
---
YES!!! So Lame
---
I played ESO on PC at launch....it was just as bad as this, it was that bad it was removed from a lot of stores etc. 
---
Took them about a year to re release it. After that I played on PS4 when it launched and have over 1k hours in it.
---
They really need to take a page out of there book though, its like they've got all that experience and didn't learn a thing from it. I know its Zenimax and not technically the same team however surely the different departments share info and whatever else they need etc. 
---
Know what the biggest issue with the game was at launch btw...item duplication which allowed players to gain an advantage over others, something they still (3 months on) haven't fixed in FO76 :(
---
Amazes me how anyone can white knight for Bethesda and this team really does :(
---
Wont be getting the latest DLC for ESO though when it comes out as Zenimax is part of Bethesda and Bethesda treat there customers like shyte.
---
If you went back for revenge you're in PvP with them so your base is fair game. Yes teammates of wanted players can kill you if you kill their teammates. It's retarded and the latest in a long line of abuses of the system.
---
There in the trees man.... in the fvcking trees!

One of the reasons why I keep a couple orbital strikes on me lol

Maybe an idea is to have the players "scale" to the event level but their event rewards are at the player's level.

Legendary dog? Was it... Dogmeat? :)
---
I'm only level 32 and I've scored 3-5 legendary one-star weapons, all but one is useless, and that one is a black powder rifle that does +10% versus players and it's level 45 so I haven't done anything with it yet.

I don't craft weapons though, I get almost all of them from enemies and just mod them.
---
If you can settle for like 8' tall that actually sounds like Anthem lol
---
this has turned into a witch hunt pursuit thing . My previous post . was this exact post . but it was pulled because my TITLE wasn't descriptive enough . im sorry you dont like my music? wtf? since when is posting a  pvp video on YouTube wrong and make me somehow guilty ? seriously man some of you guys really disappoint me. Im here trying to help you guys out . i never asked for an unban or anything from you bro . why are you so mad. jesus christ.
---
What, you mean you actually enjoy gunning down huge mobs of ghouls!? That's nonsense, the game is only fun if you're struggling with shit weapons/armor/perks.
---
I wish there was a new list that we could put in the game so we can flag certain items like missiles and ammo and it'll whatever items that we don't want to pick up when we hit collect all or when Quest try to drop off something so don't just go into where I'm at to where we got cost at Lee clean out our inventory
---
Because longer than usual maintenance times cause people to bitch and moan about not being able to play.
---
Spelled it wrong again
---
Absolutely yes. 
---
Also I wonder what they had/have planned for the mod slot that at least some of the gas mask options have.
---
Go to cobbleton farm, instant adhesive (craft from the plants using cooking or chemistry station).

This is an old picture. It’s almost all fallout now. 
---
This is good news! Wasn't there supposed to be a big update at the end of this month? We're getting close.
---
Are you grouped?  Group is detected as a unit, which is silly.
---
Likewise, once a single mob sees you, magically the all do.
---
Client side mods have nothing to do with it tho
---
actually . they told me to provide  "a short description" 
---
I'm not trying to loot. The loot window shows up no matter what if you happen to look down a bit preventing the ability to heal. 
---
A level 40 gun only has like what, 3-5 less base damage than a level 50?
---
Not ideal but I don't think trash is wholly valid.
---
You mean free with Atoms earned in game. 
---
That is a great strategy and also completely insane from a game design perspective, who has to build a weapon in order to take it apart to learn something new from it particularly a mod that wasn't even on it in the first place.  Mods should just unlock as the relevant perk cards rank up, what do the cards even do otherwise?
---
I love filling my bed in any Fallout game with Teddy Bears. At first it was because y'know, my Lone Wanderer needed security; but then the Courier and SS decided to too. Now it's a tradition. Megaton, the Sink and the Red Rocket garage all had a bed with a ton of teddies. Hope my CAMP will be able to too.
---
I'd even be happy if they made it where when you place it on a shelf it's "used". I just want my shelves and magazine racks to look full 
---
All the nuke sites have a weight room too
---
Level 128 here. It was a mild nuisance. 
---
You can make your legendary better if you're able to mod it yourself. I craft and scrap weapons to get things like the hardened receiver.
---
My second character still uses a crafted weapon at level 60. Its perfectly fine.
---
I second this, because the big office building right next to the workshop also had a floor under construction, there’s about 6 concrete bags sitting around in there too, plus a few more scattered around
---
Are they any different from the ones you can find at the space station wreck?
---
If he asks you to get in the box, use your safeword.
---
Honestly I've only heard it from people like you who keep posting about it just stop posting about it
---
Dogs "It's Bethesda's fault for not putting a fence up"
---
But that's my point. ESO is their game and because that launch was a mess you'd think they would have learned something at least. With the size and detail of ESO I'm surprised it doesn't crash but they figured it out. There's no reason 76 should be in this state what so ever. 
---
Add another to the list
---
Government supply drops.
---
I start my play time dropping supply drops from all the towers near where I'll be playing and keep and eye out for people getting close to them, if it looks like they might try for it fast travel and get ready to collect that sweet sweet 10 cap bounty/scrap
---
There is point on the map that trigger events. If you want to spawn events go to overseers camp down the road is a truck. Jump over the barrier an run through the grass it will spawn a random world event. I 100% agree about rewards. I made a post a few days back that talked about how the event swarm of suitors doesn't give you anything at all right now. No exp, junk, aid, nothing. Tried on 3 different severs 3 different times.
---
I don't know about you, but I've got exactly one legendary weapon, a level 30 Vampire's Switchblade.
---
Everything else is crafted.
---
Hey, i think this looks fantastic!! We have very similar styles/abilities haha Just curious why you chose to use the Barn slant at the top of the Brick structure? Not that it doesnt look good, just curious of your train of thought 👍
---
My mom alway said "from nothing comes nothing". She was wrong 😂
---
Not actually sure if int affects it, but there definitely seems to be some RNG in how long the durability bar is when you craft something, and thus presumably different absolute durability at 100% condition.
---
Its the CTD thing that fristrates me the most. This and only this game. Ive yet to have any other titles Ive played online in the last 10 years constantly CTD... dafuk, and like you so so random. Some days 9 hours one one server, others constant disconnects not even worth trying to take a workshop.
---
Still in love with game but damn it it doesnt need more thrown at it to get fixed. Dangers of adapting a poor quality engine never designed for multiplayer I guess.
---
lol yup! was pretty comical to watch him wip
---
me around like a rag doll.
---
350 hours in so far and only seen him once.
---
noticed him, my turret started attacking me (i don't know if bug or he hacked) ignored it ran towards him and he vanished.
---
haven't seen him since :(
---
Thought he's just rare, but now i think its just another broken feature :(
---
Awesome! God bless!
---
yes i responded back to them. i dont expect to hear from them in a while seeing as some of the people posting in Reddit havent heard anything in weeks . not a problem . im just making this public so people pay attention to this sort of thing now .also it might be worth noting to not have too many bulk or too much bulk of one thing .that could have also been the reason .im not sure yet . the email was the same everyone else got  
---
Your dowmvote means nothing.
---
I just want to be a ghoul...
---
What was the first sentence that I posted?  Oh, wait, I have it here:
---
"I don't use this perk so it doesn't effect me. "
---
Oh and there's this:
---
"Nobody cares. If they fix it, who cares. If they don't fix it, who cares."
---
And this:
---
"They'll eventually fix stupid things like this perk."
---
Yeah, I'm totally on the "hype train" for not getting this bug fixed.  You caught me.  Thanks for pointing that out.  You should join a debate club.  You'd win every time.
---
Just a FYI but I have one melee character and one ranged single shot rifle character.  I have ZERO heavy weapons characters.  Why?  Because heavy weapons are under-powered and chew through bullets like a fire hose.  I can do more DPS and use less bullets with a single shot build.  Or I can use my melee character with even more DPS and zero ammo expenditure.
---
FYI Bethesda is WATCHING the posts here.  They've already proven that by what has been included in previous patches being A LOT of stuff talked about here.  So you pointing dumb things like this out, gets it recorded, and brought up at meetings, and has coders tasked to work on it.  Those hours could be devoted to much MORE important things like server stability, crushing dupe exploits, and adding new CONTENT.
---
Pick your battles.  This is a dumb bug.  Nobody cares if they fix it or they don't fix it.
---
Debate over, go find something more important to complain about.
---
Yeah, uh, that's not that bad?
---
Forego an overpriced coffee out for cute hairstyle? I'm fine with that.
---
Also 300 atoms is easy peasy.
---
Its bugged 
---
Fat man your feet. Now.
---
I will recive the decesion in 7 to 10 days
---
Sweet, lot of folks over at the trading sub do ask for low level leveling weapons like this. Probably could trade it in for something more your level
---
Take mentats and eat SB brains.  You get shown fewer words with high intelligence. At really high intelligence, you get fewer words than attempts, so you don't even need to solve the minigame
---
Seems to be getting popular.  
---
Here is a vid of spawns.
---
https://youtu.be/0tZBnirhUAE
---
Yea ps4 for the w
---
then maybe this was not the case because i do not remember the server acting up when i was doing this . and i wasn't getting a server disconnect message or anything like that 
---
PC
---
The venders had a limit but you could offer something more then they had and then "buy" some items till they could afford it. 
---
Dang, that's awesome! 
---
I would definitely recommend class freak.
---
This video was so good. Very well done, I loved it. 
---
My friend an I have this issue alot. One of us relogs usually solves it.
---
My current Camp location has not yet had a single monster spawn
---
Yes! It could make your CAMP spawn while the app is loaded, so your water purifiers can create three ounces of water and then quit, while sending status updates:
---
"There is a ghoul in your corn garden."
---
"The ghoul has ruined the water pump."
---
"The ghoul is eating the walls."
---
“More stability fixes.” -Game somehow runs worse.
---
I might have one in storage, I won’t be on until tomorrow though. Send me a PM Friday afternoon if you still need one and I’ll go check.
---
For 2000 atoms or whatever it was, you can damn well believe Santa n his trees are staying out all year :p
---
Since the latest patch, sometimes I will log in and notice that 1-2 armor items (not power armor) have vanished. I have so far lost at least a legendary left leg armor and a legendary arm armor, as well as my flux crafted vault 76 under armor. Relogging will not bring the items back, they are just gone, period.
---
Thanks for the feedback.   
---
No Reddit Community Managers have commented / Reached out yet, but here is to hoping they do!
---
Thank you kind sir
---
I am *so* on board for more extreme cosmetic updates like that!
---
I just thought I'd start small lol...just sick of everyone wearing one of the 3 acceptable hairdos.
---
i have not spent one dollar on this game aside from the 60 i payed at launch for it . i earn through my dailys,photo challenges ,and so on . if you really grind the challenges you can get a few hundred atoms in a day 
---
More the merrier, I'm.  I'm up to 13
---
Laser guns
---
If you can put things on bookshelves and such...I should be able to loot them. ;)
---
I didn't buy it, but I did see a Vendor Bot selling it. I thought it was an odd thing. I guess I've never seen the paddle ball. Lol
---
Things that shoot lasers 
---
Red rocket workshop has a extractor.
---
Finally somebody with some sense.
---
Not even close. 2 shots do a flat +25% damage after the most recent patch. 
---
My TSE dragon is still OP af tho.
---
Thank you! 
---
I have a Hunter's Explosive Harpoon Gun.
---
Her name is DETHKLAW and she kills Deathclaws.
---
Or buff the Scrapper perk
---
They need to fix this, it's so stupid.
---
I have a pretty good executioner vats guass rifle I believe. Can't remember stats atm but I can get back 2 you if you like 
---
Wat were is it?
---
I dont know. This game is so half assed i dont know up from down.
---
i wish i had the extra money to spend on atoms but i have to earn them like a peasant 
---
Patch allows the team to enter PvP, like mentioned above. The one shot is difficult without more details as PvP scaling is weird, but also there are definitely weapons out there that can pack a punch. As for your CAMP, did you just revive or come back for revenge? If you sought revenge this automatically flags you for PvP against them again, and as such they can trash your CAMP without picking up a bounty... If you don't fit into those scenarios, then not a clue my fellow dweller.
---
No cat meat recipe? This game is unfinished beyond repair!
---
He is rare I've seen people post screenshots after killing him. 
---
I saw him 1st day of the beta and snuck past him because I knew he would wreck my shit.
---
For whatever reason, people have started using the term “DLC” to mean “any new content,” which is obviously wrong and confusing, yet it happens. 
---
Bethesda said they hoped to add some quests by the end of January. 
---
Ok thanks for the conversation anyway.👍
---
We dont have to agree with each other. Everyone can have his own opinion
---
Oh I'm with you on that one, just round these parts people are quick to jump on the Zenimax studio side of it and to be fair it was a different team.
---
No excuse though i know! There is only 1 reason why the game is in its current state and that's greed :(
---
If they really had any ideas on how to get out ahead of this and get it fixed they'd be talking to us daily, they  have the staff, the platforms and the knowledge but still take the stance that the customers don't need to know shit. That its acceptable to assume our patience and carry on pushing fluff onto the Atom Store.
---
The atom store should be removed until its working to show good will / faith. Do Bethesda really think its alright to profit off a broken product whilst ignoring customers? I hope not but can only go on experiences off them and what i see.
---
They are a disgrace no doubt about it. 
---
That's why Todd's in hiding, he knows.....real question is does he care enough to do something about it.
---
been there, dude. got ganked by a 3-man scorchbeast squad + scorched entourage. not enough stamina in the world to escape. 
---
lol, when I first started a level 30 was waiting outside vault 76 he took care of all the mobs while I did the first few quests, was a great help. Then because I only use melee weapons, I was giving away free ammo and a guy gave me a 3 diamond legendary at my level. That helped tremendously. Now I just help others I come across by giving away hundreds of bulk items, stimpacks, water and food as well as having given away tens of thousands of rounds. I'm really liking this game and have been pretty lucky to get the items I've got.
---
Nice build. I had a town in the same location a week ago http://imgur.com/gallery/byHn3Tn
---
You don't need barbarian, it's broken anyway, if you have any fractional strength (from mutations and class freak, for instance). So incisor, martial artist, blocker, 3 points for either iron fist 3, or 1 point in each of the gladiator or slugger perks. That's everything you need from strength for a good melee build, and leaves you 3 points for traveling pharmacy.
---
This is one of my biggest peeves with the perk system.
---
"I have *some* recollection of how to put this flamer barrel on this plasma gun, *but my damn fingers just won't do it right.*"
---
A sincere thanks for your post, kind sir.
---
It’s more of a playful “that’s what you get” type of thing.
---
im just sharing my experience if it turns not true "and wish it did" ill happy to go back my regular crafting without the fear of server disconnect .
---
the one that goes pe-pew pe-pew.
---
Please god yes radiation immunity. Even if its a fucking 10 point endurance card. Its the only thing that completely shita on the concept of not using power armor.
---
Jumping in front of explosive weps for bags! I like seeing low levels, they trigger a lot of players with no aa damage
---
it works sometimes, but I do use the mutations too.
---
Vendor cap is meant for balance. If not for the duping it would he pretty hard to hit max caps unless you made that your goal.
---
The most I've had at once was 7K, but I'm also a shopper so theirs that.
---
I hopped through like 5 servers to find one
---
you think i could replace commando with rifleman? also if not i dont mind using commando just got to find a handmade auto mod
---
Off topic, are treasure maps worth it? I have like 30+ or so in my stash, mostly the mire
---
Curls and I’ll be the happiest man of the Appalachia. Without curls my character doesn’t look like me irl 
---
That’s racism against people with curls 
---
Would be a cool heavy weapon. A concentrated heavy laser beam gun in a taxidermed shark body with its mouth open.
---
I don't get it man(n).  I'm the same. Can't go an hour without it booting me, yet here I go jumping right back in.  
---
Its the last patch that fixed 150 different things (lol) but didn't really....unless it just meant 150 different lines of code.
---
It broke more than it fixed, its been steadily getting worse and worse since the patch.
---
Hopefully its something server side that's trying to record item dupes etc but I doubt that as Bethesda seem to have the item dupe in all there online games at launch.
---
I got you on trying to summon a BSG rep.
---
r/ladydevann
---
As long as unyielding stacks, it is the build, not the weapon, that matters.
---
If this is true, I need to drop it from my build
---
Client side mods can absolutely result in crashes and disconnects. Disable your mods and then you have a leg to stand on if you still have issues.
---
Ya, you would have to be okay with people putting whatever in and others taking out whatever.  It is a free trade system.   Maybe 'trade' stash is the wrong word - maybe 'world' stash.  It would work  the same way any other container does in the world.  Maybe you could filter it by item type.  Only allow Junk or Notes or Ammo to be put in.
---
Same. I've made over 70 camps an a ton of locations don't get attacked.
---
Just let off the trigger every 10 rounds. It’s pretty easy.
---
You need dense armor. While still annoying SB aren't that had anymore.
---
2nd row on the right at the end, not a locked safe just one that's only open a little bit. Mask is usually in the safe on top of a pillow.
---
Cant see it in the pic btw if that's what you meant lol I've been and collected it for like 4 diff mates though after i found it in there couple of server hops and you should get it :)
---
The only one so far that I was tempted to buy was the Side-Roll one that was a limited time item.  But I really want longer hair-styles for my characters, not shorter.  So I decided to wait and see if more come out soon....
---
Thanks for clearing that up, and for the downvote!
---
Maybe you've been lucky, maybe they came when you weren't there and the turrets go them. Maybe your time is coming... Who knows but it's definitely a mechanic
---
There’s a visual bug that causes vendors who have reset their cap allotment to still show as 0. Try selling something if you think the vendor should have reset, if they have and this bug is occurring you will be able to sell and see the caps normally afterwards. Closing the menu and reopening is a legitimate fix too.
---
Vendors reset 20 hours after you first interact with them after a reset. So if you haven’t seen them for 20 hours they should be completely reset. 
---
Power fist..... explosive.... dont think they used explosive bobbleheads. 
---
Well, i can definitely tell that even with all-out hip-fire addons i can still consistently replicate misses with a Gauss Rifle. As long as you're starting to charge the weapon before going into VATS, you can miss 100% of the time (out from a 100 shots, tested it), as long as you're stepping sideways. The camera is slowly trying to center on your target while you're doing so, and as long as the middle of the screen is not exactly (and i do mean EXACTLY) on your target, you WILL miss. Its definitely shooting from hip-fire.
---
Another reason to support this theory, is that if i carefully center the middle of the screen on the "subject"'s legs, or arm, i can still blow the limbs off; the hit is definitely on the limb, even tho the VATS is aiming for the torso.
---
Two things i got wrong before, is that first, VATS doesnt immediately snap your target right in the middle of the screen, its more like a slow turn of the camera, so insta hip-hits are NOT a possibility. 
---
Second, you dont actually need to wait all the way for VATS to finish zooming in (by zooming in i mean the VATS sound effect finishing, and the camera to stop). The time-frame for an initiated attack to be hip-fire is relatively short. Definitely less than half a second, maybe 0.25 seconds (testing was done on a server with minimal amount of latency). As long as you start firing after this, its a normal VATS shot. The problem is most noticeable with the Gauss Rifle, as people can start to charge the show even before going into VATS, and this results in a hip-fire 100% of the time.
---
With normal rifles (Using a fully modified, semi-auto Combat Rifle as a secondary weapon), you need to be extremely fast on the trigger pull after going into VATS to trigger a hip-fire; and the second shot is always normal VATS. It still can be replicated though.
---
Havent tried an automatic weapon, though i would assume the first shot can still miss, and the second should be normal VATS.
---
Again, i firmly believe it's a hip-fire thing, not the percentage indicator showing fake numbers, as i have managed to consecutevily miss 100/100 shots with side stepping.
---
shhhh...that is my secret CAMP location!  But it is awesome.
---
I think it'd be great if they were craftable at various levels (And they add in a quest that gets you a legendary with bonus robot damage). And they don't have to make the messages with complete customization. Give me a font picker, a selection of colors, and a few hundred word dictionary to use (and have someone creative go through and figure out the 'naughty' combinations and blacklist them as invalid combinations).
---
Sounds like you want to play a different game.
---
That would nice. Giving your camp a raider look 
---
I've got 6 2-4 diamond legendary melee weapons with perfect rolls that fit my two builds well. and all my armor is 3 stars, which I found myself.
---
Thanks for the info! It sayd “respawn (x)” (I’m on PS4), so I don’t think I went for revenge. There was no pvp message popping up that gave me the option for revenge or respawn, I am certain about that. (I pressed respawn like 15-20 seconds after I got killed) The changes in the last patch would explain why the other guy was able to kill me though. And since they weren’t wanted after destroying my camp, I somehow went for revenge without noticing I think. 
---
I forgot about it because I tuned in for hours and nothing happened. 
---
Maybe that's what he does when he see's my main character now hehe
---
Vampire mole miner gauntlet for me. Combined with the luck card that has a chance to repair on hit, I never repair weapons anymore. Add solar charges and whatever the card that radiation heals you, stimpacks use is pretty much only for the big monsters. 
---
That would explain the first part of the scenario, thanks! 
---
It's not trying to Max caps I want. 
---
I pvp often and sometimes bite off more then I can chew and I'm alright with that, I just wish I could afford to die more then 6 times to pvp on a day before I'm broke.
---
I've heard  a few other bobbleheads can stack. I just know explosive does
---
Vendor inventories are not shared. I play two accounts on two PCs. When I'm running a vendor loop, the same vendor will have entirely different stock to offer each character.
---
750,000 caps for a level 50 with 15 charisma??
---
;) /s
---
Why won't Bethesda listen to the real fans and make this happen. /S
---
yea the suitcases sometimes have tons of ammo lol! 
---
So you want to be Liberty Prime, except also fly and have a flaming sword and star trek shield. 
---
Just spoke with Mom, claims she hasn't said shit! I'll keep my eye on her though.
---
Where is this location I’m asking for a friend
---
He said it was a challenge. He didn’t say it was *challenging*. Not his fault that’s the terminology Bethesda chose for those atom quests. 
---
Did you really need those 39 cans? 
---
I think the platform debate is dead. Nobody really cares. I think he new metal is cross play. We jus wanna all play together.
---
That patch hasn't happened yet.
---
I mean most efficient per SPECIAL point. Strong Back at max rank only takes up 4 points and applies to everything. Yes, you can reduce your carry weights to almost nothing across the board, but it'll cost you a dozen SPECIAL points across various categories, which limits your options for other skills. 
---
NO THEYRE UNDER THE STREET
---
Where is that location?
---
Yea
---
I hadn't bothered to search out the dig sites and have been saving mine as well, but I was bored so decided I might as well get rid of them.  Got some other regular weapons and armor to junk to learn mods, and a bunch of plans I had already learned.  
---
It's kind of fun to see what you get.  
---
/slow clap
---
It’s entirely possible the serum-Santa wasn’t hacking. If that group farms the queen a lot, that person may just have a lot/all of the serum recipes. And with the recipes, serums are pretty cheap to craft. It’s like 2-10 each of 2 different scrap resources, and a single stable flux. 
---
I know it wouldn't be together, but I'd seriously get her Fallout NV and 4 - if she liked the Fallout vibe she will love those games and the best part is you won't have to server hop to get away from griefers
---
And what weapons are they nerfing?
---
I thought the armor helmet plans (not the wetsuit looking one, but the combat style one) wasn't available in game unless someone hit the dev room. Could be wrong.
---
It'd be super cool if they made something like a Commodore 64 that you could wire into the TV and load the Pip-Boy game tapes into.  Then you'd be sitting at your TV playing video games in-game AND irl
---
Alpha male would have higher hit points!
---
Shes lying... Sleep with one eye open.
---
You're doing it wrong. Use it on rabbits and molerats instead! No meat mincing necessary, just add salt'n'pepper. And rename it to Redneck Precision Tool.
---
It was the other stuff like All rise/bunker buster/daisy cutter/silver lining/ete. 
---
thank you for sharing . im probably going to be staying away from crafting altogether after this one . or resort to crafting really slowly .
---
getting back 1 or 2 of em should be nice with the perk card.
---
Join the discord and send some things out in the LFG. I find this is the best way when I’m getting into a new game
---
What are those rounded walls?!
---
Damn that sucks. I've been hunting the plans for a while. I just recently got the Marine tac mask plan from drop site v2. They sell for 27c to vendor max hardbargin if that's why you're going for the plans.
---
Believe it is the third safe room you open during the event 'Back on the Beat' in Morgantown if memory serves me right.
---
My GT SamuelV87 just message me or add me
---
Toxic valley, left of the palace of the winding path
---
Because I want vehicles? Lol.
---
Yeah happened to me too 
---
Nah dude, dont think of it as punishing yourself. I caved and bought a normal TSE a while back and felt it ruined the fun of grinding gear for me. It now literally sits in my stash while I use my own rolled legendaries (which arent the best) to bring the challenge back and my TSE comes out only on the rarest occasions. My best roll is an explosive combat shot 2 STAR and a TS LAR 1 STAR
---
Drops for items containing screws are similar to FO4, except for the fact that they cut the quantities in half for those junk items. Example, typewriters, fans, and toys only contain one each now. I always pillage kitchens as well, since pepper mills actually contain 2.
---
Just tried this on PC too and had the same problem, picked nearly 100 flowers still at 0/10
---
I ran scrapper because I thought I would be getting the non-basic stuff too like it used tonin the other games. When I realized I was just getting more of the same, I got rid of that as a perk I use. I can get these basic things in the wild and at a lower weight than using weapons for those crafting items. 
---
Makes sense because it never procs when I'm laying into the queen when she lands, I'll have to test it when I get home from work 
---
Last weekend I think. Not sure if it helped but I responded a couple times and also logged a ticket to see how long it would take. 
---
God I hate that event. So buggy. Half the time it won’t even start (doesn’t recognize you’ve reached the island), I’ve had it spawn the queen because the mirelurk male ran underwater to the island and I didn’t see him, but with like 1 minute left on the timer, the timer ran out before I could kill her, and so I failed the quest. I think I’ve completed it successfully like twice, out of maybe 7 attempts... I usually ignore it if it pops up these days.
---
Thanks! I know I’ve seen him at least twice, but it was so long ago and I was so low-level that I didn’t recall seeing the spacesuit.
---
The trainyard  between whitesprings and top of the world
---
I got you fam
---
Weight management, or at least that's why I sell shit I wouldn't otherwise.
---
Anything but the white screen. Didn't it change colors if certain events have happened?
---
Morrowind had silt striders though. 
---
The trainyard between whitesprings and top of the world 
---
That's the structure that was already there.
---
Set a few decent things up at a lower level but once you’re endgame is when you should be deciding a permanent one. Once you here, try to get near the water, for purifiers, close to vendors for easy travel, and if you need I would put it on a resource vein too
---
Alright so, forgot to put an update but now the challenge is showing that I picked 10/10 flowers for about 5 of the types when I only picked about 3. wtfmate?
---
True that. I’ve scrapped so many that I’ve unlocked every mod for it (minus ones you can’t get one scrapping). Now I just sell them unless I’m low on steel.
---
Even with the best mods, it’s still shitty.
---
I have a **level 35** powerful auto handmade  that does 10+ more damage than a level 50 powerful auto assault rifle. The only thing the assault rifle has going is I can put a perforating mag on it... can’t imagine if I found a level 50 handmade what the spread would be 
---
That's right I couldn't place that. That quest was pretty good IMO
---
I meant price
---
Yes!! 
---
But I’m at work for 5 more hours. 
---
Get them all.  #weirdwasteland

My risk to take, and your bounty to risk having levied.

I posted this on one of the YouTube videos of the song, but here was what I wrote there and my interpretation of the lyrics.
---
&gt;I think there's been a few efforts to nail down the lyrics, so here's my take on them.  Note that the original Seven Wonders of the World were the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, the Temple of Artemis, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, the Colossus of Rhodes, and the Lighthouse of Alexandria.  There are lists from other eras as well that include the Colosseum mentioned in the song, along with the Leaning Tower of Pisa and some natural wonders show up on various lists as well.  
---
&gt;The reference to roaming or living in the bass has to do with piano players using their left hand to play bass lines / chords while their right hand typically plays the melody.  
---
&gt;Honky-tonks are typically bars that specialize in country music (and maybe hip honky-tonks played newer styles), but also refers to the style of piano that was related to ragtime music and was an important influence on the boogie-woogie style that became popular in the 1920s.  Kansas-style is probably a reference to Kansas City jazz that also became popular in the 1920s and 1930s.  
---
&gt;U-235 is Uranium-235, an isotope and was used in the Little Boy atomic bomb (as opposed to a plutonium, implosion-type bomb like Fat Man).  
---
&gt;Anyway, here's what I think the lyrics are:  
---
&gt;*I know you've heard*  
---
*About the Seven Wonders of the World*  
---
*The Colosseum, the Pyramids*  
---
*The Mausoleum, now listen kids*  
---
*The Tower of Pisa, Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls*  
---
*And the Painted Desert really enthralls*  
---
*But there’s an eighth*  
---
*An aid to the boy wonder*  
---
*Who plays piano in Savannah in a manner*  
---
*That brings down the hearts like thunder*  
---
&gt;*He's got two left hands*  
---
*And they love to roam in the bass*  
---
*That man's got two left hands*  
---
*And they make their home in the bass*  
---
&gt;*He's got the right amount of fingers*  
---
*And the right amount of toes*  
---
*He's even got two eyes right over his nose*  
---
*He's got two left hands*  
---
&gt;*He plays Kansas-style*  
---
*In the really hip honky-tonks*  
---
*Yes, that man plays Kansas-style*  
---
*From Savannah up to the Bronx*  
---
*‘Cause when he plays the boogie-woogie*  
---
*Oh, how they all applaud*  
---
*He doesn't have to look to find the lost chord*  
---
*With a built-in beat in the bass*  
---
&gt;*He's got the right amount of matter in his cranium*  
---
*Yes, the right amount of brains in his branium*  
---
*And when he plays it hits you like uranium*  
---
*U-235, solid jive*  
---
*And he keeps them both in the groove*  
---
*And he keeps them both on the move*  
---
*Oh, he can buy a new tuxedo*  
---
*The kind of suit he loves*  
---
*His only trouble is when he's buyin' gloves*  
---
*‘Cause he's got two left hands*  
---
*A built-in beat in the bass*﻿
---
I just want to microtransactions removed. I’m not paying $20 (1/3 of what the game costed me) for one small simple item. 
---
Fallout 76 was rushed out as fast as Bethesda could manage, I'm sorry but everything that happened is predominantly on their own heads. 
---
I spent an hour clicking one of those darn things, my build is 'crit happy' with 15 luck, and I was drunk (Got the 'luck from drunk' and was eating something with +luck.
---
That and the Ghoul Slayer's bashing \*\* radium rifle make it official, game hates me.
---
I think its the tunnel undernead the big road if you travel from watoga to bog town
---
Damn, thanks for the quick response! Much appreciated. I'm holding Grahm up right now waiting to buy some plans. Haha!
---
Nah bro definitely don’t get empath
---
if i had award gold for this comment id have sent it your way. but im broke. so accept my words of award for making me laugh this morning from some good old truth.
---
As soon as I saw the Junk Shield perk, I immediately wanted to have an armor made of teddy bears.
---
If you are on PC I can make you serums for just the crafting mats!
---
I will check that local out.
---
I feel you on this. I scrapped all mine awhile ago and have been taking pictures of them instead but now I hit the photo limit so there is no winning. I just want the damn bears :'(
---
Slim pickings after an apocalypse I guess.
---
He is a ladykiler.
---
Then it would undermine the purpose of the Atomic Shop. 
---
Nah empath is Garbo since class freak doesn’t work with it
---
If they mean that spiderman looking thing then the plans are in the game. I think I have about 2 spare but am on PS4. I think I got most my marine stuff in the middle of Camden Park, there's about 3 plan spawn points in there. 2 by the armor bench, forget where the other is,
---
You on PC I can check if I have one for you when I get off work
---
Honestly couldn't care.
---
Being able to craft gives you the opportunity to essentially always have it on hold. As long as you have the resources, and if not it will take 5 minutes to find them all, you can make that item and any mods you want for it. With a legendary, you have to actually get it through rng or trading, and then forever have it sitting taking up space in your inventory or stash. I scrapped my fully modded combat rifle because 20 pounds is ridiculous, and whenever I have 5000 or so .45 I just build another one and use it all up. 
---
I haven’t been killed in this scenario but I have definitely been frozen several times. This especially occurs after loading into a new server for the first time. 
---
Just turn the fallout series into a mecha anime with giant robo-suits all power rangers style and shit
---
200hrs seen him 8times, always near whitesprings 
---
Sadly no, im on xbox. I wish there was cross-platform
---
Dont check the train hangar, go a little bit further up north,  its in one of those buildings 
---
YES!
---
IT SHITS MINI-NUKES!!!
---
Ah
---
Love the look! Imma have to go look for that!
---
Only reasonable explaination I can think of is collection of gases in the atmosphere from fissure sites. 
---
I live in a wooden shack over a filthy pond. I eat mutated molerat for breakfast. I got needle tracks from all the stimpaks. 
---
Yesterday, ghouls ate my bed, Watoga bots shot me off a building, and I stuck my hand in scorch beast guts to get its DNA.

"Rough Nite" is the only realistic hairstyle for me.

---
I also notice now the last week that my camp almost every time I load in cant be placed? That is something new I havent seen in the past...
---
Did you get the hydraulic press in AMS headquarters? Just found that yesterday and was excited lol
---
Be cool if they would atleast show the pictures we take or something
---
Not Another Mothership Zeta! Actually idk how popular that dlc was
---
You are correct!  But they will eventually get around to fixing it.
---
Getting all is super simple.  Getting all but one is maddening....
---
Ha. Trying to manage a tech support call while reading and posting. Sometimes one or the other doesn't end well.
---
Its fine, ive been deciding if I should get it on PC if i get the money
---
I've tried to do it twice. The first time, I went up there as a level 30ish, and level 50 something mirelurks came in droves and droves and droves. (I want to say 58 but I am not sure).
---
When I was there the other night I was level ninety something and all the mirelurks were level 5 or 10 and just wandered along the shore and never tried to actually approach the island.
---
This game is odd sometimes.
---
He seems to have a glowing personality. Seems like you two will get along quite well. If nothing else, it looks like he might have a ravenous appetite in bed
---
Afcourse I prove  your point because it's true what you say. It's just a fun discussion for sending inspiration from future ideas. 
---
And we can make fun of some of the flawed mechanics or is it absolutely forbidden to just say it is ridicoulous we have no vehicles? Because in a wasteland like this we would definitely had created some form of transportation besides walking. 
---
It's all in good fun. Stop being a fanboys and treating this game as the god of all games. It is a fun game but it has many many flaws which hopefully will be fixed I. The future. But let is just have fun with the flaws for now instead of getting annoyed about a game which purpose is entertainment. It is a game, just a game. Just for fun, relax. 
---
Make sure its the tech support that goes well
---
Very true. As a level 70ish player, Ive been using my non-legendary level 40 modded hunting rifle, and it works fine. I’ll replace it when I get a nice legendary one, even if it’s base 40 again. No need to recraft it to a level 50 plus all mods just to gain a couple base damage points. 
---
It's directly south of Mount Briar's workshop. :D
---
Some people like eating poo. Ralph Wiggum loves finding Easter Egg.
---
Heavy sturdy and light are all modifications so yea
---
Picture's would be okay, but I like the idea suggested a few days ago that your pictures could be framed and hung.
---
Or that haha either way, they are awesome. 
---
That’s ok. I’m pretty sure the armour I’m using now is T60, in which case I can give you the arm.
---
Yes. It's something that has, in 22 years, never been apart of the series. It's not about keeping up with the times. It's about keeping a consistent experience and that's why Fallout is good. It's a game that requires you to discover new locations and you'll miss a lot of that if you're just driving around the map. The whole point is to explore EVERYTHING. It's especially frustrating in this sub because everyone wants to change how this game works, not add something small or something that would make life easier but completely new mechanics and new perk cards. The game, when functioning, is fine how it is. And I'm personally sick of seeing people asking for non "Fallout" things to be sudden implemented in Fallout. If you don't like the game the way it is, don't play. Don't beg for changes that will ruin the game for people who enjoy it for what it is.
---
Nah, they would make more money off of people buying them to sell off to other players than they currently do with only a few players buying one or two items that only they can use
---
yes. For example, I wear heavy combat armor. I scrapped mostly light versions of combat armor and those mods carried over to my heavy.
---
Well if you do Ill get you a Dragon!
---
Last two I went too not only did we kill it but all the loot loaded with very little load time on PC. Can't complain on my end.
---
That or they release cross-platform (i think it would help the game)
---
And when you move the scorchcbeast queen away from that tower of lag guns, they just respawn the entire camp underneath the new location, which makes even more fps drops loading in all those turrets
---
The problem with that balance is, the ammo still cost the same. The DPS meter should favor the minigun for wasting so much freaking lead.
---
I can’t remember?!?! I’ve had it forever. 
---
tbh i would love to fight Rathalos with a gatling gun 
---
ESO did this with their cash shop, honestly hope FO76 follows suit. Of course, top end gear is crafted instead of dropped in that game, so maybe it does make a difference.
---
You all should join [Space Team!](https://imgur.com/a/mpWE2Q6) 
---
Or ballistic fabric from armor we scrap....
---
Keep on server hopping.  Took me quite a few hops 
---
Agreed. As of right now, I tend to only do the events that have a legendary spawn. (Uranium Fever and any Horde ones mainly) The others are just not worth the time and caps.
---
Chirp Chirp. I got nothing from website, twitter or here. This sucks.
---
I always thought this was a bummer, beth has encoraged us to become hoarders and now they are teaching us to limit what we keep, I DONT WANT HELP IM PERFECTLYBHSAPPY THE WAY I AM.....i might need those 80 combat rifles one day.
---
Great! I got a heavy chest but can't craft the heavy version of it. This makes it way easier :) 
---
Gib hardcore mode pls.
---
Seriously power crept my way to one hitting most enemies with Knuckles.
---
also gib legendary knuckles.
---
A non legendary one can be bought a Harper's Ferry for somewhere between 500 and 800 depending on your charisma. As far as legendary go, well that depends on the effects.
---
There's always a (moth)man, there's always a lighthouse
---
I find it regularly between the Welch station and the other one in the ash heap. It’s name escapes me but it’s on the same rr line as Welch 
---
Thanks! Sent them a thank you msg!
---
That would be terrifyingly adorable
---
Currently no upside to not having mutations
---
yea ik about the legendary part, thx for telling me about Harper's Ferry
---
It would be great to recover caps for travel when disconnected.
---
You mean the one that kicks in 5 swings after I have to repair my broken super sledge?
---
That’s faulty logic. 
---
And from what I see in game and in picture posts. A lot of people buy a lot of stuff in the shop.
---
Not that popular. Then again the only real must haves for F3 DLC was Broken Steel and Point Lookout. 
---
UPDATE!
---
Finally got an email response from Bethesda today.
---
Take a look.
---
https://imgur.com/a/ycKJ9r8
---
I will let you guys know what they decide. 
---
I would love that!
---
I question your judgement in men.
---
Seems i have still lots of plans to find. Where can you find
---
- metal building set
---
- powered gates
---
- terminal
---
Ahahahah youre right holy shit i need to sleep
---
Well, you cant mod a light armor to a heavy or sturdy one. Thats why I was askin
---
We are talking about 76 though there arent mant client side mods out there that would case CTD or server connection issues.
---
Seems like you are desperately trying to minimize or belittle anybody with this experience.
---
Game is busted, just accept it.
---
hah, i spent a couple weeks trying to put a suit together and i could NEVER find a right leg!!!
---
You definitely should’ve taken his shit. His fault for being an idiot 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Is it possible to scrap light combat to get the plans for actual sturdy and heavy plans
---
In your picture you admitted to duping guns on your account.  I would love to see a follow up on what happens to your account.
---
got banned yesterday for either having too much bulk 
---
or making too much bulk too fast. 
---
Im a lvl 43, and most of my friends are on xbox, but one of my friends is on PS4 and me being able to help him with my other friends would be fun, and if u have an xbox and pc account you would be able to transfer items
---
Very nice work. My updoot you shall have, spend it wisely.
---
Maybe your own personal store. Make a small profit, you set the prices. People would be less likely to exploit if it cost them caps.
---
I love how you get all upset o we a game lol. I mean it's supposed to be all for fun lol. It's entertainment nothing more nothing less. Stop acting like it's your life's work. It is a game :)
---
Vehicles do not change the game at all. It would make sense that when I see a bike that I can fix it. 
---
It would be totally realistic.  Or atleast give me a way to move faster then walking. 
---
And yes we can ask to make changes that has never been done before because Bethesda changed the whole ballgame by making a fallout online. That changed everything. 
---
And since we are talking about not changing anything which in your eyes is forbidden. Why are you not complaining about the paper bags we have now? That is a huge change. Or the building in fallout 4. That was a huuuuge change.
---
Stop being afraid of change. 
---
What they said!
---
There's an inside the vault due out today though, kinda expecting / hoping plans like this are going to be mentioned though as Bethesda know there's an issue with certain plans and didn't address it in the last patch.
---
One of the data miners released some info that suggested certain plans were level locked as well, this being one of them i think but who knows the truth .
---
the only t60 piece i've found is a helmet. I seem to only find t45 pieces. 
---
When BOS initiate is underwhelming.  Can't tell the difference on anything (if there is one) except a small box sybol on the chest.  
---
Saw him for the first time today but he teleported away before I could get closer. Wish the encounters with the Grafton monster were that pleasant 😂
---
Or maybe it's the subliminal messages from listening to the Beach Boys song "Wouldn't it be nice" on the Appalachia Radio that is causing these threads to pop up every day.
---
I got mine at Grafton Station. Took quite a few tries.
---
If you're on PS4, I'll build you one for free. I have most of the mods unlocked for it.
---
I loved mothership zeta  and Broken steel. Didnt like point lookout and the pitt much
---
The Pitt was great imo, as was Zeta. Upvoted because I totally agree. 
---
i heard theres a frame on top of watoga high school too, dont know if that's true though
---
Bloody seems like it on ps4 lol. Used to 1 shot normal scorchbeasts now it takes 2 shots. ( maxed out shotgun build. Plus extra scorched damage. 
---
It would be great if it started at zero, we dont use the recommended values anyway.
---
Oh, my mistake. I read into that wrong.
---
There's a Responders and a Cowboy group I'm both part of on ps4 for Fallout 76 if you want to join either! 
---
I completed the main game quest with a Order of mystery build.  Using pistols, one handed, vats and sneak perks.     Late game pistols just don't cut it.   I switched to using rifles and with no rifle perks the whole experience was much better.  
---
That would make a cool Power Armour. Like a teddy bear esque head and torn bear limbs on the arms and legs, Maybe some fluff scattered on it. Throw a little blood on there you got yourself a 800 Atom Paintjob!  Id be on it in a heartbeat
---
I don't think so. I have broken down tons of combat armor and haven't had this happen once. Your best bet is to farm events like "Monster Mash" at Watoga High School. Then take the heavy combat armor you get from it, and use the mods you've already learned to enhance that. Much easier than building your own heavy combat armor.
---
I see the plans about every two days at either Grafton, Camden park, Welch or Lewisburg. Less frequently at Watoga Station and BoS vendor.
---
I have a 1* Instigating Dragon I'd sell you on xbox
---
There are spots where these skills can seriously reduce danger or give shortcuts. Not many yet but the biggest example is the missile command sites. Those places even have some applicability for Robotics Expert with three levels of Hacking. 
---
How much would u sell it for?
---
Yeah this too, I thought  people were kidding until I saw it happen.
---
Then don't. Go farm atoms, it won't kill you. 
---
It was terrible. I mean in theory it is a good idea, but in actuality if just makes everything worse and make is very hard to kill anything. Not to mention being only affective when the queen is on the ground (my most powerful weapon is melee) she does land often. 
---
Had this happen the first time I logged on after the patch last week on PS4. Since then I haven't been opening my pip boy within the first few minutes of loading into a server.
---
storage is full like everyone else in this game insensitive punk, and thats being very kind to you right now which is more than you desearve.
---
I'd give it to you for 500 caps, 10 bulk aluminum and 50 waste acid
---
/me puts a perk card in pocket and suddenly know kung fu.
---
Theory that all of this game takes place in the matrix confirmed!
---
Ive seen 3 between those stations since I started playing in beta. It will show up eventually.
---
Laser guns, ultracite laser guns, Assaultron heads, and Tesla rifles. I managed to complete killing scorched with lasers by using the Tesla rifle.
---
I think at this point it would be more fun to blast the prize bot than to wait for it to give you junk......:)
---
I realize this probably hasn’t been implemented because of filing issues but being able to rejoin a server you’ve been disconnected from is a MUST for a game like this that requires you to invest caps up front to compete in lengthy events. There are many other situations as well where this is a “no-brainer”.  This needs to be number one on the priority list imo. 
---
Has anyone ever noticed the alien statue below the west side cliff?
---
Powered gates - from Graham the travelling super mutant merchant
---
Terminal - from the enclave bunker vendor
---
Metal building set - i got from watoga super duper vendor
---
Is it money and materials, or money or materials? because Im struggling to even have aluminum rn because im crafting power armor
---
Is it time to start stating location as well as platform when we're having trouble?  
---
I'm UK and I've only had the double loading screen thing where the map loads with messed up lighting, flickers away, then loads up properly. Nothing else. Is this because the European servers have a lower load than the US setup?  
---
Is this a server problem?
---
Last night convinced me there is an issue with servers tied directly to the population of that server. I believe if a player was on a server by themselves it would be perfectly stable. 
---
I was initially loaded onto a heavily populated server. Lag was horrendous, below 1 frame per second after fast traveling. I thought the game froze, but  every few seconds the next frame would display. I tried waiting it out, and the game disconnected from the server. I immediately hit play at the menu and was astonished i got back into that same server. The performance was still horrible. I know i was in the same server because when i loaded back to the whitespring station i checked the same suitcase i always check for loot, people leave unwanted items in, i leave stuff there too. It had the same 3 items in it. There were also the same 2 level 29 players hanging out at the resort. I always check the map before fast travelling there and wait until no one's there.
---
The game hard crashed shortly after i realized i was on the same server. I restarted and hit play again. Loaded onto a server with only 2 other players and the server ran like butter. I actually got a lot of stable play time in and spent a good amount of time on that server. 
---
I'm starting to wonder if all the server instability is because the servers can't actually handle more than a few players without hitting some kind of bottle neck. And I'm starting to think that bottle neck is enemies spawning tied to a player entering an area given how unstable the game is when that happens with more than 1 person in that area, t-pose, enemies attacking before you can see them, enemies nit spawning until you're right where they spawn at, etc.  I play one PC.
---
That's fine, 500 caps + 50 waste acid is fine
---
K cheers for the advice, trying to collect all the plans for weapons/armor. Any tips as to finding the plans for these tho?
---
Just saw that, glad it’s working for multiple people, so I hope it will for me 
---
You can find super mutant body parts in Emmett disposal site
---
I spent about two hours moving around between junk pile locations last night looking for one near water and away from high level enemies. I ended up settling on a concrete resource and stream next to a junkyard. 
---
I killed it without much effort.  I only seen him one time. I had mothman, stalking mothman and vengeful mothman so far. I am kinda tired of mothman tbh
---
My gt is m3ment0, but I'm presently at work. I'll be on in ~5 hours, little less
---
Cool! Yeah, I kinda thought that may be an issue with a pistol/ one handed build. I do have an explosive Western Revolver I thought I could maybe pass onto that character but doubt that would make enough difference
---
Ill work on that when I can, since I only have like 80 caps. but to me thats a good deal
---
not all of the methods have been patched.
---
I want a laser mounted on the moon. I’ll call it The Allen Parsons Project. 
---
Yeah I cleared out 150 weight in junk recently when mine got full. If you’re carrying tons of junk with you on a consistent basis you are quite frankly just doing it wrong. The ONLY penalty when you die is dropping junk, so clearly storing it as often as possible is the only way to avoid it. If you refuse to do that for whatever reason (ignorance), that’s on you. You deserve no sympathy. 
---
Thanks for the info. What about music plans?  Piano, guitar etc
---
Do you want to get rid of that if you still have it?
---
have a post up with pictures of my ban from yesterday . They said i was banned for having a *"excessively high rate of item creation"* I believe it was from one of two things . having too much bulk junk on me . or creating bulk junk items too fast . i would stay away from either one until ban waves are fixed .
---
Empath and Herd Mentality or whatever the other group/solo one is really bad if you primarily play solo
---
Right. But not having them doesn’t stop the quest. Stuff like that should be throughout the game to make the perks more than extra loot. 
---
Imagine if there was area were you could lock doors to get the enemy to go a certain route. Set up an ambush. 
---
Or you can hide in a room you have to unlock first, to avoid creature that are high level and dangerous? Or are s lot?
---
It was only the most popular dlc to have ever been released in a fallout game.
---
handwriting in one thing. The text on a computer is entirely different.
---
No - the lack of NPCs is one of this game’s *strengths*, imo. It sets the tone for the game much more firmly than a hundred rubber-faced NPCs ever could.
---
I honestly do not know why people are so insistent on wanting dull, scripted random talking heads in this game. We are the first emergence into a dead, failed world, and part of the story is specifically that life as we know it is over unless *we* succeed where the previous inhabitants of West Virginia failed. 
---
It’s a lonely world, and FO76 is the story of that world told to us by the memories of the dead.
---
you're not the one that missed the mark with the false equivalencies
---
piano and guitars i got from doing workshop events, the wind instraments is from any responder vendor i believe
---
I have so many empty tables and shelves in my camp and it looks so odd, filling it with teddy bears and other cool items would be amazing 
---
Laser Rifle has burning dmg barrel or smth. Dunno if it works tho
---
Well all the mods for combat armor depend on your play style. I play with ultra light armor since I'm a stealth sniper. The only mod I'd absolutely recommend is the BOS combat armor mod. There are 3 types of these plans (arms, legs, torso). To get them, you'll have to server hop with Grafton Station and the vendor in Grafton to buy them. 
---
As for weapon plans. The easiest way to get every one of the ranged weapons is to do the "Patrol Duty" event at the prison. I got every plan possible from it including the hard to get Handmade rifle plan.
---
Lots of misinformation here. Intelligence ONLY affects maximum durability. For durability between 1% and 100%, damage reduction is exactly the same. For durability OVER 100%, you get bonus DR *only* (no bonus ER/RR) based on how high the overrepair goes. The confusion comes from this- is it again based on percentage, from 101%-200%? I believe so but I haven’t verified it yet. In this case, again, high max durability doesn’t give you higher max DR, it just means it degrades slower. 
---
Some, however, have claimed that it’s actually based on the total durability value, so if you have a higher max durability, when you overrepair to 200%, you actually get more DR. I haven’t seen any actual evidence of this yet. 
---
lol, less FO76, more sleep
---
Can you explain more exactly what route?  Are you meaning that you just walk the road between charleston and the ice cream place?
---
Bethesda doesn't care one bit.
---
This happened in ESO, there last online game as well. Just the fact that it made it out of beta into launch and has been ignored for 3 months shows that well enough.
---
being constantly overencumbered made me wish there was a an old timey hand driven rail cart I could use to go up and down the wasteland railways. maybe have it where you have to constantly press "R" to pump the handle to move.  
---
I think full on free roam vehicles would be impractical but if they were static to rails it seems more feasible.  
---
Or I'd love if they just had a hand driven rail cart model sitting static outside the stations that you could pay caps to "fast travel" to and from different rail stations, even over encumbered, heck would make the ticket terminals functional.
---
It's how I keep track of how many times I've killed the SBQ!
---
Is this meant in a funny way? 
---
shishkebab sword does fire damage
---
YES PLEASE! I hate that they are trying to be like some Fortnite knockoff with all the silly costumes, hairs, skins, and objects. It's getting really annoying, the target audience of this game isn't little kids like Fortnite is. A lot of us who play fallout are older and want the atom store content to be lore-friendly. I would totally grab some of these hairstyles because they actually look normal unlike that horrid nuke cloud hairstyle they have currently.
---
I didn't realize I needed this until you said it. 
---
Pineapple juice
---
This is a very original post that no one else has thought of and posted 900 times.
---
i found a giddyup buttercup during the beta and i really wanted it in my camp
---
Provide some examples of the prices you're having issues with.
---
Don’t forget to make it 5 separate Power Armor suits that connect to form the giant for when you are playing with friends 
---
Has anyone actually worked it all out re damage differences will be after the patch? Bloodied, anti-armour TSE etc. Would love to see some statistics on damages
---
I fail to see how removing the cap gained from Nuka fixes fake caps? This is either fake or on going issue I wasn't aware of.
---
I admitted to having duped guns. Big difference. 
---
Never once duped myself. If you could see the rest it goes into what happened and shows that I never duped. 
---
Why does it always say I was disconnected from server when I log off. No crap..
---
110 here, never seen a TSE anything, maybe one TS, maybe one E. I did get a quad Dragon which is a fire and forget because of the reload time. I mostly run with a lever action and a handmade. Eight of ten nuke runs result in crashes. The ninth results in a server disconnect. I can only farm legendaries on the 1 in 10 nuke run that doesn't fail, or non-nuke legendary drops.
---
I'm at the 25,000 cap limit with nothing to buy. There are no good plans or mods available. There is nothing to do. I haven't played for a few days.
---
I just scrapped one I found on a wendigo (PS4, so I wouldn't have been able to help you anyway). The problem with the gun is, I think there is just one mod for it, the bayonet, so there really is no need to pick up extra guns once you found a legendary version that you decided to keep. And because of the weight you will get rid of it at the nearest vendor, so no-one is carrying extras.
---
I will get rid of my Vampire's The Dragon as soon as I find one with better mods (instigating, troublemaker's, explosive, you name it), that's for sure. Will drop it into the Watoga Station suitcase if the vendor is out of caps...
---
I believe the Shishkebab worked when I checked it a month ago.
---
Apparently that's not uncommon, I dropped by Watoga last night and the blue suitcase had about 20 different plans in it... including 8 copies of the Ultracite rusty knuckles and a couple of explosive vents as well.
---
You know something I'd like to see? Doing the 'Powering Up' events gives you a generator you don't have every time until you have all of them. If they have that logic (give random plan from this list that player has not learned), have a second list of 'after generator' plans, maybe specific to the plant, eg: 
---
* Poseidon gives lower level armor/weapon plans and the 'cheaper' furniture.
---
* Thunder Mountain gives BoS and Free State related plans and heavy weapons
---
* Monanga(sp) gives specifically Raider related plans, PA, etc and lots of the more wacky weapons or mods plans.
---
Idk, it was just an idea.
---
Btw I've been clocking myself, I soloed Poseidon in 12 minutes last night, though someone had done 2-3 reactor repairs when I got there. But the entire building was popped with mid-level critters I had to deal with and couldn't just ignore.
---
(If you did not know, by the way, they un-nerfed the fusion core generators, they make 8 an hour again... I've got so many fully charged cores I was tempted to use a meh legendary gatling laser I found just for laughs. If you hang around for long enough to beat off the initial 'after claim' attack on the yard you'll usually get to pull at least one if not two cores).
---
Rude
---
I did that with the multitude of individualized teddy bears found in the game. Why are there so many unique items found in the game, just to be used as scrap? This game is built mainly from FO4 assets but theses teddy bears didn't exist in that game. Somebody worked to design  them and name them only for them to be useless beyond turning unto cloth.
---
In my opinion they should give the most resources because they would obviously be the easiest to disassemble  
---
Well i think i got the message by now.. congrats for wasting  your time. 
---
I'm not upset at all. You're the getting triggered. I saw this same thing happen to Destiny. The online communities cried about not going to get a higher light level because they didn't pay for dlc. Unfortunately Bungie listened and next thing you know you're average enemy is dropping high level loot than what you get after spending 6 hours on a raid. To that's a slap in the face. And I feel the same way about this game. I'm fine with some changes. 8d love to be able to name my power armor or have perk load outs. But I don't want cars in a server that's already having a hard enough time functioning as is. I'd rather have new fun quests than have a vehicle. Getting caps isn't hard and grabbing the world traveler perk will discount fast travel. There are plenty of great ways to get around that don't break the game even further.
---
How do you get them to Xbox One?
---
Idk if this is relevant but once while fighting a regular scortchbeast I was definitely ill prepared and used a random shot gun I picked up when I shot it the health just continued to drop until it was dead I’ve only had it happen once but maybe a similar bug?
---
JUST GOT A RESPONSE lemme read it . i will post updates 
---
Haha, very nice!
---
I believe you can find this in a garage behind Abandoned Bog Town. There's a bit of lore I don't want to spoil but look inside the van.
---
Also, don't pick up more than 1, I can't seem to drop the password item from my inventory and I'm stuck with 95 copies :3
---
You to seem be describing a Knight in Warhammer 40k
---
Its part of the watoga mayor for a day questline
---
He's pretty easy to spawn unless you hate server hopping entirely.
---
Bog town i think in some shack with a caravan inside  
---
About a month ago, I was near the Top of the World when suddenly a dozen Super Mutants spawn in with a Flatwoods Monster. I started shooting the Monster while popping a Stimpak to compensate for the mutants. You have been disconnected from the server.
---
I saw the monster a couple of times since then, but even with my highest damage output, it disappears pretty quickly without fighting back. I was never able to kill one.
---
But other MMO type games have this too... Why not Fallout76?
---
Yeah I'd let friends use it and pass it around to other new friends that start lol
---
people were duping stacks of 100k nuka colas, therefore duping caps....
---
It's not, you're talking about marine tactical helmet, I got Marine Armor Helmet - its the only helmet in the game that give you ballistic resistance (mine around 18, crafted with 21 INT).
---
Bloody mess.
---
I am not sure though, but if i remember well that was part of a quest.
---
I'd love companions in general. Closest I have right now is my best friend the Mysterious Stranger
---
[boi](https://imgur.com/gallery/2QuZp)
---
I just want a fun game that works.
---
But I know that's asking for crazy ridiculous things that can't really happen.
---
The trade off is supposed to be high capacity and fire rate. We should see a DPS measurement if someone's willing to test it.
---
Laser's should penetrate armor as trade off while retaining the durability issue. Not sure if it currently does.
---
Bullshit. It caps at 5 damage, can be lower if you have a weak weapon against a high armor target. 
---
I’ve tested this with my main and an alt. From .44 body shots up to 2-shot lever-action headshots, it never did more than 5 damage a hit. 
---
You can't dupe caps, but you can dupe Nuka, so the dupers make thousands of Nuka for the caps. 
---
This is either an odd turn of phrase or the most egregious autocorrect I've seen ~~ever~~ all day.
---
Zenimax made ESO not Bethesda
---
I was trying to be rude, lol. But really, there are SO many things they could touch upon before removing microtransactions.
---
I found it the other day at Harper's Ferry, so I think it's RNG. 720 caps or so with Hard Bargain 3. I believe I first picked it up either at Grafton Sation or Camden Park.
---
How about like ... the size of the circular zone of “wanted” indicator on the map is relative to the amount of “wanted”-worthy damage dealt? That way it would intensify if the player has been really doing a lot of damage but not be that serious if they haven’t. And ... if the wanted level doesn’t go above a certain threshold, it should gradually decrease back down to zero. 
---
I agree with you on some points but I love heavy weapons and I’ll explain why.
---
The Gatling is fantastic, got that throaty roar, high damage, common ammo that is cheap to craft and sparingly used, and a consistent and inescapable damage output from point-blank to long range. It’s a fantastic main weapon imo. 
---
The .50 cal is pricey to run but eats enemies. Good secondary.
---
The cryolator can freeze the queen on the ground. It may glitch her landings after that but I don’t have the data set to know if that’s just normal glitching. I’m going to stop using it and see.
---
The flamer does big damage to the queen imo, I think she’s weak to it.
---
The harpooner and broadsider are massively powerful weapons. Both use cheap ammo (the harpoon has negative ammo cost due to bugged flechettes).
---
The burning effect of the laser gatling
---
makes it great for putting small amounts of *consistent* damage on the queen in the air, which also means you’re marking her with fire and a light show for other players. Otherwise it’s fairly useless and competes with the jetpack for ammo. I did recently pick up an explosive version which is probably OP as fuck. An Ultracite LG with the right attributes will be ridiculous, more so when laser gats get the patch they obviously need. 
---
The plasma gatling breaks too easily. It has decent damage output however and its two main drawbacks (the ammo in clip = number of cores left when you equip it and its fast breaking) will be patched sooner or later. Plus it is fun to use, pretty important to me.
---
The last and most interesting heavy gun is the LMG. An LMG with the right stats will wreck stuff like you won’t believe. I have an AA and +Fire Rate one with prime. Why prime? Ultracite .308s are cheap (to me, level 140ish) to make. It wrecks. I have an explosive one that I don’t like as much but that wrecks too. Obviously these are mainly for the SBQ but they are *so* much fun to use.
---
Perks. Bear arms will mean that your massive arsenal of wildly different guns will cost almost nothing to carry. This applies to a whole class of gun. From faux-shotguns to faux-rifles and all the weird and wonderful cryos you can carry. You can even kit a harpooner out like a sniper with a scope, or make a missile launcher so accurate and zoomed in you can use it like a sniper. I don’t. But you can. All these guns use different ammo so you’re rarely stuck for options.
---
Perks II. Stabilised (int) buffs two attributes for all heavy guns. That’s insane. It applies the powerful AA effect to every weapon in class. Crazy. Obviously you have to be in PA but I use other guns if I’m not. Other guns which I can carry because my ridiculous acme bag of heavies weighs nothing due to bear arms.
---
I only run one rank of master heavy gunner for icing on the damage cake.
---
I don’t use TSEs so take it as you will, this is my take on why I love heavies 👍
---
Not being a fanboy.  I point out things that need fixing or adjusting all the time.  I just pointed out in another post that they need to lower the cooldown on events and REVERT the legendary nerf they did (where legendaries stopped scaling to your level).  They can do both of those things very quickly and easily.  
---
Lower the cooldown on events is a single variable for each event.  Cooldown = ~~45 mins~~ 30 mins   DONE
---
Reverting the nerf on legendary drops not scaling, have whoever coded that nerf in, put the old code back in place.  I'm 100% positive they have stored backup repositories of previous original code.  Cut, paste, DONE.
---
It's about priorities.
---
Prioritize things that will add fun and new content to the game.  Not some completely new mechanic that they've never done in any Fallout game ever, which would cause more problems.  It wouldn't even be one developer needed to implement vehicles, it need to be a full team.  Animators, modelers, coders, etc spending hundreds of hours working on the physics, modeling, animation, and coding of the new vehicle system.  
---
Meanwhile those people aren't working on things that would be more fun and could be delivered to us faster:
---
\- New Vaults = The dungeon code is already in there.  Level design, some event timers and triggers, maybe some voice acting, done.
---
\- Player Vending = The NPC vendor code is already good, they just need to add player interfaces so you can add / remove items from a Player Vending Machine.  Some UI work, some background code work, done.
---
You have fast travel, relax and use fast travel.  Remember it's fast, and easy, and you can go get a drink while you wait for the load screen!
---
But we on team during the event so u gonna be itchy till event is over :P
---
This bug is super annoying. A couple of friends were wanting some ammo that I had like 2000 of and it took me like 5 tries to give them like 200 each because it kept skipping to the end. I noticed from this thread we can use the triggers on console so I guess I'll use that workaround for now.
---
Happened to me yesterday when I spawned into a nuked whitespring.  Went away after a death.
---
No, it's an honest question. Why is the menu not showing up directly? 
---
What gets me is when you take damage from enemies that have not spawned yet.
---
Right now only a t-60 initiate paint can be acquired by progressing through the brotherhood main quest then looking for technical data. It often spawns in those cylindrical file cabinets. You will take that to the brotherhood camp in the mire to turn in. You'll get about 40 caps plus random rewards. The BoS PA paint is a rare reward, but i've gotten other brotherhood outfits (bomber jacket, scribe, scientists, and fatigues) from turning in that data as well. The chances are super low like maybe 1 in 10 gives you a realish reward. probably even lower chances though. Although elder, paladin, and more brotherhood paints are in the game files, there is currently no way to acquire them in the game state today.
---
I'm going to reply / rec every time I see someone recommending removing the HUD if you're using it, because it is great advice.
---
I tracked that suggestion down in a thread a few days ago and since ditching the Targeting HUD helment it's like playing a different game in terms of stability.  I'm getting through most evening sessions with no crashes at all, sure the random server disconnect, but no lockup crashes.
---
I thought someone said .308 actually had higher damage. Unsure if crit/armor pierce is different 
---
Just a heads up, with proper camp box placement you can get both a junk extractor and a lead extractor in the same camp. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png
---
Directly below the T in "salutes" is a spot that has both close enough.
---
Toy box would look good next to the racecar or princess bed :)
---
I like the atom shop. It's a lot of fluff you don't need to play the game, but still lets you add your own little flair to you/your CAMP
---
I want to be a  supermutant and use junk as armor. 
---
1) Railway rifle does not currently benefit from ANY weapon-class perks whatsoever. Rifleman, heavy gunner, tank killer, stabilized, etc. 
---
Only way I’ve found to increase damage  is with bloody mess. Would be nice if it could be considered either a rifle OR a heavy weapon. Right now it’s nothing.
---
SPECULATION - still classified to the cut weapon class “EXOTIC”.  Guide book lists exotic crafting perks that aren’t found in game, I believe railway rifle may still be classified as such in the code... may effect other weapons (Crossbow? Broadsider? I haven’t tested to see if perks effect damage)
---
2a) Salvaged Assaultron Head still suffers from infamous damage bug / health regen glitch when shooting enemy with a multi charge shot (2+). Bethesda CM has acknowledged to me that the team is aware of it. 
---
2b) Gun still starts with ALL fusion cells loaded at once. Workaround exists if you store all fusion cells in box with weapon equipped and pick them back up. Now loads them in normally
---
These ideas are awesome.
---
not even my raider power armor could save me
---
lol...  all i want BETHESDA is a true .50 cal. with the scope and range capabilities of the true weapon...  NOT A CHEAP .308 knock-off. it wold be nice But not necessary to get that in legendaries too... 
---
As hard as it may be to accept but Todd Howard and BGS seem to be more focused on their next titles. Despite the horrible condition this game was in at launch my bets are it still squeezed a profit. I'm not sure this will get better anytime soon. The most we can hope for is dupers eventually losing interest and abandoning their accounts stabilizing the servers while patches drip in. 
---
U so virtuous, I wish be moar like u so great sjr
---
I know, Zenimax Bethesda. 
---
Why would 2 companies owned by the same company share info on successful business practice hey :/
---
I went with some luck perks. The four leaf clover one. Some vats stuff. I try and use vats to maximize crits. Also easier to cripple limbs
---
From what I understand, TS is going from +100% to +25%, and Explosive from +100% to +20%.
---
Change your receiver to a .308 hardened for more damage. And do you have tank killer level three? 
---
Just use mods!
---
...oh wait
---
But I thought we hated youtubers?
---
Yeah they kind of messed up the balance of food. Instead of having rare food, with have unlimited amounts of instantly spoiling food. 
---
Had people limited their duping to tens of items instead of tens of thousands or more, it may have gone unaddressed.  I am not a fan of it at any level, just making an observation.
---
I love heavy weapons. They are ammo hungry but honestly, I find the materials for them easier to farm than the plastic for shotguns (that being said, you find a lot of shotgun ammo in the wild. HW ammo, not so much).
---
However, there’s only 2 HW I consider useable. Gatling Gun, and 50cal. The rest have massive issues with damage, durability, or ammo consumption, or all 3.
---
Good thing is I love the 50cal, and with Martial Artist and a speedy receiver, the Gatling gun fires fast enough that I enjoy it too (baseline fire rate is just awkward)
---
oh i know i had a lvl 86 before re reolling and i could barely take them out
---
partly my fault though from my play restrictions lol im an anti power armour user lol
---
Yeah it‘s gonna be my secondary weapon for ghouls and scorched mainly. I really like it but I still need a two shot version. 
---
I want to upvote this twice.
---
I had that the other day. Sorta ruined my ghoulish regen idea.
---
As soon as I walked out of the blast and back in the radiation kicked in like normal.
---
To clarify, scroll until you get to one with white diamond and take that one.
---
Does that non-mutated cat spawn there still?
---
The most disappoint thing about it, is that despite its rareness, the loot is not even worth it, is more about the experience I guess
---
You can show them off to me- just put them in a paper bag and I’ll take care of it
---
I've seen this happen since day one, but last night there wasn't even the gamertag and there was a naked, immobile version of my character in the last location we were at.
---
Roses are red, super mutants are green, do you really need 5 rifles to be a killing machine?
---
They are getting nerfed but they will still be pretty powerful. At least no one shot kills anymore
---
I prefer to be a roof korean
---
According to u/Silent454:
---
Just found a new spawn location for this bot. West of Lady Janet's Soft Serve on the road, shortly past the tipped over bus, and next to the 25 mph speed limit sign. As far as I can tell it was just a straight run from the ice cream shop to the sign and he spawned for me.
---
Edit: pic for proof https://imgur.com/a/hkjdkUI
---
Basically, I just go to the spawn point for Lady Janet’s, clear out the trailer, then sprint past the bus. If the vendor is there, great - otherwise I deal with whatever spawns (if it’s hostile) then head back to Lady Janet’s. As I approach more hostile may spawn. I deal with them, then get close to the trailer and server hop.
---
I’ve seen the vendor here 4-5 times, while I’ve only seen it one at the Charleston station.
---
I want a rock to wind a piece of string around. 
---
Currently the cap is 50
---
Yes armor and weapons cap at level 50. Some guns like the handmade rifle or lever action gun only go up to 45.
---
In agility
---
covert operative perk
---
mister sandman perk (only works at night though)
---
Adrenaline perk (this perk is only ok if your not just 1 shotting everything)
---
In perception
---
Glow sight perk ( very good in nuke zones with lots of glowing mobs)
---
Can't! To busy trying to do the challenges. As slowly as possible 
---
BOS underarmor also inexplicably COSTS you 58 DR, 58 ER, and 60 RR in Power Armor. The Enclave underarmor doesn't do this. Makes absolutely NO sense for an underarmor that was specifically MADE to go under PA.
---
Titanfallout
---
Hardened .308 reciever does more damage than any of the .50 recievers. Also bloody mess is a good 15% damage increase, adrenaline works well when you start stacking kills and can seriously boost your damage 
---
So you think that BGS staff can only do one or the other?  You know there is more to creating content than coding it and there is more to debugging than tracing code?  Relatively few people are involved in doing both.
---
Yeah I'm sure they will still one shot things.  I mean explosive is only really good for killing trash.  A bloodied weapon seems to do most dps for like sbq.  Everything else in the game is just so damn squishy.  With dense armor mod (greatly reduced explosion damage) and fireproof, even full damage PvP explosive weapons don't one shot me anymore xD.  Good stuff lol
---
From my understanding EU broadband is much faster than us in the US but I actually pay a higher tier for faster connection. Only Bethesda would know if it's a congestion of players and activities or regional. All I know is I'm in the NY/NJ area and the servers are shit. 
---
Dickish responses to community managers isn't going to help any game.
---
Yeah, Rage 2. Comes out soon doesn't it? May i think. 
---
Cancelled my pre order couple of weeks ago now. 
---
I think he's still going to be in hiding, i very much doubt there was enough time between this and that for Todd to show his face again. Especially after claiming communication would be better going forward then going AWOL again. Cant wait for the drama t unfold though when all these angry customers Bethesda have been ignoring and nickle and diming start seeing his awesome face and posts trying to drum up interest in Rage 2 lol 
---
Wouldn't be surprised if it got delayed tbh.
---
I know everyone says Point Lookout was supposed to be great, but I actually never bothered playing it. :/ I was burned out on FO3 when it came out and so it didn't really interest me, but Mothership Zeta was different enough to grab my attention, even though it was kinda linear just like Operation Anchorage and The Pitt were.
---
Rofl I check in on this sub every couple weeks, it’s like a free drama show that just can’t get it right.
---
Thanks! What weapons and gear would that be? Or is it random?
---
Same! If it had included some long locks ala [Betty Grable](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/21/a3/bc/21a3bc4ef67196a97752cb210800ec0c.jpg) I would have been sold.
---
The phantom attack? I get that a lot. 
---
Ye it does
---
What the rest said. Also if you happen to be lucky enough to get your hands on an instigating hunting rifle...by all means make that your sniper rifle.
---
I do because Whitesprings Golf Course = easy XP and chance (however slim) for something. I did find a 50 cal Ghoul Slayer, which in hindsight maybe I should have kept since I farm them...
---
Correct, just ignore that zero and try to sell something anyway. It will tell you if the vendor really is out of caps, otherwise the trade will go through, and the remaining caps will be correctly displayed.
---
There still is a bug though, because for me the vendor always gets the math wrong: I will for example often sell something for –say– 8 caps, but the vendor's total will only decrease by 6 or so. My char is heavily mutated, though, so maybe the algorithm chokes up between all the boosts and nerfs to the Charisma stat. I couldn't care less about the caps, but it's still a bug allright.
---
Class freak, and go all out.  They are all good once you keep class freak on.
---
I saw it the other day as well.  One of my teammates, who could not enter a nuke zone w/o crashing was able to enjoy a crash free night as well.  
---
Okay? I'm not arguing it's dumb. I'm just telling you you're completely wrong with your conjecture that "only people doing sketchy things" keep inventory on them like that.
---
You need to smoke a spliff or something dude. Chiiiiiill.
---
See this is why I would be a bad criminal.
---
Whoever designed [the Atomic Shop video](https://i.imgur.com/Zqqbd7O.png) agrees with you
---
Like now i am killing supermutant warlords like they are low lvl  ghouls with my TSE gatling gun. It makes the game very easy and less challenging. 
---
Thank you
---
Awww, that's terrific.
---
When you're over encumbered, and you find yourself outnumbered,  the ghouls come in hordes, make peace with the Lord. Amen. 
---
Just a quick PSA: you can't even vendor them with a custom paint on them....
---
Not to be a negative Nancy but display something nice and some Band of Dooshbags will destroy the camp, cause it would be fun.....

Here’s what’s been datamined. Seems to be the only stuff on the horizon for now, sadly.

heh...Yes

You got a name?

Heh...Pain

---
Modding changes the mechanics of the game.  The code is unstable enough.  Not all crashes in the game are necessarily due to discussions with the server.  FO4 and Skyrim had crashes, they were totally client side, and mods made them less stable.  
---
Mods can make a game less stable.  Simple programming basics.
---
Well yeah thats a possibility. They could destroy it but all i have to do is repair. 
---
Horde events are fun, when not requiring me to traipse around the entire map, but the rewards are terrible. 9 times out of 10 I find the horde and it winds up being some level 20-30 legendary that drops a level 10 item. 
---
Glowing entities often drop it, I get most from them.  Sometimes I use a workshop, but that is less often now.
---
That's frickin nuts, dude.  
---
Where do you get all these legendaries? Farming Whitespring?
---
A lot of the heavy weapons cap at 45, it's not random, but I've never been able to find a complete list.
---
Ah, I've just recently found that place by accident, there's a path up to it from Welch Station, right? 
---
Hey, they tried. Maybe they couldn't do much more damage but they still wanted to help.
---
That may be true, but I have fought invisible bee swarms about a dozen times now and haven't seen any other invisible enemies.  
---
If this was truly down to the bulking of items then Bethesda certainly managed to lower a bar that i thought couldn't get any lower.
---
They make a crappy broken copy of FO4, allow the game to get duped to high heaven because there's no profit in them to fix it, then start banning customers that are playing because there crappy crafting system can't support multiplayer.

Please don't delete this thread, leave it up and post the response you get from them. You got any screen shots that happen to show your recent inventory, maybe something in there shows your not holding 100k nukas or 876 TSE shotguns stacked together?
---
Also stockpile Calmex if you can get it
---
Particular prices are not an accurate representation of my qualm. 
---
The qualm is that my trust in the currency known as caps has completely eroded. I can not go into any trade knowing whether or not I've been placed at an unfair advantage due to being in the dark as to whether the other character has taken advantage of the ability to print (dupe) their own currency (caps). 
---
I believe that it should either be flatwoods as a social hub or somewhere in the vault
---
yet it may cause them to have unnecessary net issues such as having at least 20-15 people at one area for them to chill while knowing bethesda aren’t the best when it comes to latency and its server crashes

I have been having stuttering along with other issues like : servers crashing and often there is severe stuttering to seconds long freezes just before the crash, sometimes when I load in it crashes or I am basically frozen for several seconds, and others. And it isn't my rig. Everything else runs fine and is stable. It isn't my internet connection. We have 200 Mb/s and Amazon is less than five miles from my house. The servers or the code they are running are buggy as hell. The only correlation I found in a couple days of testing was that some servers gave me a buttery smooth game and others were stuttering like mad. No rhyme or reason to it. Sometimes a good server goes bad. Sometimes a bad server gets better. 
---

Oh well, I guess I will put the game on the back burner until there is a new patch. 
---
wow i never thought of this!. Definitely adding
---
Containers are player specific. Open air items you can phisically see (typewriters, globes, etc.) are first come first serve and take a bit to respawn. I think.
---
Annoying but smart I guess? Ultimately I had to look up duping honestly. There's no bugs! Just features?...Right?

I understand its annoying when ppl just trash your camp for fun. But its a, survival game.. And survival means also dealing with assholes that are bored because they 'finished' the game. 
---
I live beside a brahmin spawn in Savage Divide near Top of the World and the brahmin are always floating or glitching into my foundations. These brahmin also slowly die from swimming in the water? They spawn on a little pond and their health slowly disappears as they stand in the water. I noticed your brahmin pen is very close to a wall in your photo like the brahmin spawn is very close to my home at my CAMP. I also have a brahmin pen but it's a little farther from my home so I don't experience the floating issue.  I think the issue is that there is no collision detection for the brahmin when it comes to CAMP objects.
---
I really wanted to call bullshit on YouTubers trying to get view by drumming up drama about this game but unfortunately Bethesda is helping their platform. I want this game to be great. It has huge potential but it's impossible to remain positive when DC every 10-20 minutes or when you DC in the middle of an event essentially wasting your time. 
---
Thanks dawg! you are the real MVP!
---
Update: here it is! [https://beth.games/2S4zsRb](https://beth.games/2S4zsRb) 
---
They should include something like the grinder form borderlands two, sacrificing like 10-15 low level legendary gear to get a higher level one, or have a way to reroll perks obviously with a high resource requirement 
---
I searched for about 2 days and then gave up - it just seems to spawn at a really, really low rate. The plan goes for about 2,000 caps on the Market / Bazaar sub, if you post an ad on there - it would save you a ton of time, and in the long run, that's only equal to about 1.5 day's worth of vendor selling. 
---
It is definitely worth hunting down though. Ever since they fixed the animation bug for it, it has been my dedicated ranged weapon. 
---
Did the publishing get delayed?  Should we look out for it today or tomorrow?
---
Ill check my junk. Might have some T51 legs on a frame! We could swap!
---
I have an FX 8350 and an RX 480 8GB. I have noticed a small frame drop near Watoga, and only ever had one crash running into Watoga for the first time while someone did the mayor for a day quest and a nuke dropped at prime. If you have any questions let me know.

Please post here for those of us blocked at work.

Nice, the survival mode sounds great.

Remember grave stones with Oregon Trail on the old library computer?  That's the caliber of messages you'd get.
---
T-There’s a Gold Tie too..?
---
..The hunt continues..
---
Same happened to me last night at the Pharma Plant.  It was going on for about 25 mins and was having a hard time understanding what was going on.  Then suddenly a ghoul appeared from the feet up in front of me and i realized that there were more of them all around me but still invisible.
---
'til you get shot in the face with a TSE gun....
---
I don't personally mind *some* goofy outfits and hairstyles (the series has a heritage of goofiness), but I hope they offer some better "classic" additions too.
---
Like I get why the Megaton and Beehive are there since they already developed them for FO4, but even the limited time one they had recently was so short and just kinda meh...not the WOW I hoped for. :(
---
The retro-future aesthetic is what hooked me so hard playing FO3, I just want some more of that in FO76...these people coming out of the Vault are not too removed from pre-war afterall!
---
Finding it isn't the hard part. It's letting go.
---
Nope but at that point I only had 1 point in the card, sold it to a vendor.

I use this map when looking for new homes.

FALLOUT 76: INSIDE THE VAULT - JANUARY 24, 2019
---
In last week’s Inside the Vault, we briefly mentioned a new, more dangerous mode, which is separate from the main game and has fewer restrictions on player-versus-player (PVP) experiences, will be coming to Fallout 76 in a future update. We’ve dubbed this new mode “Survival” and we’re excited to share a few more details with you today. Additionally, we’d also like to give you a little more information on our next major patch.
---
A NEW, MORE DANGEROUS GAME MODE: SURVIVAL (BETA)
---
Since the launch of Fallout 76, we’ve received lots of feedback from some of our more competitive players who requested greater challenge, fewer restrictions, and more incentives when it comes to PVP combat. With this in mind, we began developing Survival mode, which will bring a new way for you to engage in even more demanding, high-stakes, and deadly adventures in Fallout 76. We’re still hard at work on this mode internally and plan to bring it to the live game in phases as we add more content and features over time. Here’s a preview of what you can expect from Survival when phase 1 opens for beta testing.
---
A NEW WAY TO PLAY
---
After hitting Play from the Main Menu, you’ll be able to choose whether you’d like to play Adventure mode, which is Fallout 76 as you know it today, or the new Survival mode. The same quests, events, and story that you’re used to in Adventure mode will all remain available in Survival, but you’ll have to navigate them under the ever-looming threat of hostile dwellers who may be hiding just around the corner.
---
You’re free to create new characters for Survival mode, and encouraged to do so, but you can also use your existing ones. If you do take on Survival mode with an existing character, keep in mind that all your progress from Adventure mode will travel with you, and anything that affects your character in one game mode will also affect them in the other. This means that if you fire off all your ammo, level up, complete a quest, spend Caps, or find a fancy new weapon in Survival, this will also be reflected on that character in Adventure. If you’d rather keep your existing characters as they are, we recommend starting a new one when you head into the more challenging Survival mode.
---
STRANGER DANGER
---
Survival mode is not for the faint of heart! All players, except your teammates or event groupmates, are automatically flagged as hostile toward one another by default. There are no “invitations” to PVP combat in Survival mode. You can attack other players without restriction from the first shot you line up, meaning every encounter you have with a stranger could turn deadly in the blink of an eye.
---
Further, level scaling in Survival mode will work the same way it does in Adventure mode today. This will help to level the playing field a bit and give newer characters a fighting chance against high-level players they might encounter during their adventures in the Wasteland. As a result, you’ll need to keep your wits about you during every hostile encounter, because even low-level characters can pose a real threat.
---
GREATER RISKS, GREATER REWARDS
---
As this will be our first implementation of a Survival mode, we plan to experiment with different rules after Beta release, such as death mechanics. Currently, players who die in Survival mode will be unable to use the seek revenge respawn option against their aggressors and can only choose to respawn at their C.A.M.P. or Vault 76. We’re also planning to award you double the Caps when you kill another player, and they may drop their Aid or other items in addition to their Junk. Added risks and rewards like these in Survival mode PVP will make each of your deaths more devastating, and every kill you rack up much more lucrative. However, it’s important to note that these changes aren’t set in stone, and we’ll be looking to make adjustments based on playtesting and your feedback during the Survival Beta.
---
It’s also worth noting that players who are currently in Adventure mode worlds are completely separate from those in Survival mode, so you won’t need to worry about Survival players coming for your Aid items or double Cap rewards when you’re in Adventure mode.
---
LEADERBOARDS
---
For those of you who are focused on the new mode’s more competitive aspects, we’re also planning to roll out in-game leaderboards with the start of Survival mode (Beta). You’ll be able to see how you stack up against your friends and others in your current world, so you’ll need to stay sharp if you want to stay on top. We’ll have much more to share about leaderboards and all of the stats you’ll be able to keep tabs on during each play session as we get closer to the Survival Beta.
---
Looking further ahead, we’re going to continue to evolve, improve, and add content to Survival mode with future updates throughout this year and your feedback will incredibly helpful as we make it the most fun and challenging Fallout PVP experience we can. Our hope is to roll out the Survival Beta in March. However, we still have a lot more work to do on Leaderboards and other features and may need more development time for testing. Stay tuned for more information on the exact timing, and an even more in-depth look at Survival mode as we get closer to release.
---
PATCH 5 DETAILS
---
We’re still targeting the end of January for the release of Patch 5. In addition to the changes we previewed in the last Inside the Vault, we’re pleased to share that we’re swatting another massive round of bugs with this patch, and implementing a number of changes based on feedback that players like you have shared with us on the forums, reddit, and social media, including:
---
Hotkey improvements for AZERTY keyboard layouts, which should help French-speaking players have an easier time when constructing their C.A.M.P.s.A “(Known)” tag will now appear next to recipes and plans you’ve already learned in Vendor and player inventories, and trade menus.The Traveling Pharmacy Perk will now correctly reduce the weight of RadAway and other Chems.Early Warnings quest progress will no longer become stuck when crafting Upgraded Motors, and logging out after crafting Upgraded Motors will no longer reset the quest tracker to 0/5.And much more!
---
Additionally, we’re continuing to investigate, track down, and eliminate exploits, and your reports on these types of issues are a huge help in quickly bringing them to our attention as they spring up. Once again, if you think you’ve found an exploit, or observed another player using an exploit, please let our Support team know by submitting a ticket, and include any steps that may help reliably reproduce the issue.
---
IN-GAME EVENTS FEEDBACK
---
Finally, please be sure to stop by our forum thread for Events feedback to share your experiences with in-game events and answer a few questions about which you enjoy the most, which you enjoy the least, what types of events you’d like to see added to the game, and more. Your feedback is greatly appreciated and will go a long way toward helping us shape and improve events going forward.
---
Until next time, we’ll see you in Appalachia!

It varies depending on SPECIALs, cards and mutations of course, but mine does about 2200 with all three rifle cards and demoliton expert 5.
---
Survival sound good...but what about the rest? You know the next patch?
---
I’m online 
---
YASSS!!!!!!!!!!
---
plans will now be marked as known. Good job, boys!
---
Will survival mode still use the bounty system for players that do engage in combat and kill someone?
---
Its not a dickish response asking someone to do there job, Community Managers usually interact with the community and inform us and keep us up to date. 
---
If you find criticism to be dickish or take it offensively I suggest your reading it wrong.
---
Customers that don't get what they paid for have a right to ask why, demand to know why even. You'll probably understand that one day though.
---
Todd said 2 months ago that communication would be better and more forth coming. Why are thew community managers not following what he said?
---
We need more actual content, not fucking survival mode...
---
let me review some in game footage from the night before the ban . see if i can snap a screenshot of my pip an my stash . carry limit an all that .i have nothing to hide . give me a minute to sift through video
---
Make sure a high level player isn’t in your vicinity.  Otherwise you’ll encounter crazy overleveled enemies.  
---
No. The high level mobs you are encountering are mostly based off the fact that other high level players are in the area. You are an appropriate level at 22 to be fighting in that area normally. I might server hop until I find that area lowly populated so you aren't overwhelmed. 
---
That is awesome great pics!!!
---
In theory is seems like a good idea, in reality it is not. I am not angry at them. I just want to let people know that it is not a good idea. 
---
The nerf is way to dramatic..... its going to make these weapons fucking useless
---
I'd just sell the cola for more caps
---
:(
---
Yeah certain areas are generally designated for high level enemies only, most of the eastern side of the map. Also if a high level has been in the area recently, it would of spawned high level enemies. I would stay in the centre of the map and down towards Flatwoods. until you ready to venture out. Either that or some areas are bugged, I notice with my level 15 alt I get level 40+70+ enemies wherever I go .. make sure you have some Raider PA as a backup and get some T45 to help out when you turn 25.
---
IF the dupes are fixed, surival mode should be new toons only.
---
Cool I can join you if you’d like 
---
&gt; You’re free to create new characters for Survival mode, and encouraged to do so
---
Are we still limited to the 5 character slots or will extra slots be made available so we can create Survival mode characters?
---
I just want some content
---
There's a rifle perk that ignores a percentage of armour, I can't remember the stat but I haven't seen anyone mention it yet.

Probably another player with higher level was in the area. The enemies will automatically level to the highest level player. That area is supposed to have enemies around level 30 to 35. Maybe one or two supermutant bosses level 50 in the cabins. But thats it.
---
Yea, i love fallout games always have. That's why not going to let it drop. If didn't care would just leave it.
---
The gaming industry never learnt a thing from No Mans Sky did it. 
---
Yup cat hide from customers in this day and age its not the 80's early 90's any more. The old You don't code so you don't know is irrelevant these days.
---
Look after your customers and they will look after you, shit on them and they will shit on you.
---
!!!!!!!!
---
Known tag hooray!

DON'T LET EXISTING CHARACTERS BE USED IN SURVIVAL THIS IS YOUR CHANCE FOR AN ECONOMY RESET BEING ABLE TO JUMP BACK AND FORTH HAS EXPLOIT WRITTEN ALL OVER IT HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THIS NEEDS TO BE EXPLAINED JFHC.
---
i literally snatched that 2nd suit last night i have yet to find one under level 50 though so im not sure how people find level 1 versions of it when it only spawns at the disposal site. 
---
now the regular hazmat suits, i have about 20 or 30 of them sitting on a mule for people all the way down to level 1
---
If this isn't right outside the vault it is unfair to casuals.
---
Do the Wanted trigger mines because that would be an awesome present to leave for these unruly party guests...
---
om
---
There have been some recent threads on this exact same question, just do a quick search. Grab the Pharma Farm perk asap and level up to level 3 asap. Do the Camp McClintoc Missions as soon as you ready to get them out the way.
---
It only works as long as people don't know about the change to them in the last patch. Gotta play with this quick before folks catching on and don't loot them
---
If you need one I can make one on PC, just throw in any mats I'm missing (I'm low on mats).
---
I dont get the two shot nerf but I could understand nerfing explosive a little since they can both be on the same weapon
---
they made us wait a week for this? yikes.
---
not that I'm not excited for Survival, but they are using their weekly check ins to confirm info that most of us already gathered from last week's tease. just kind of lame imo. especially since it isn't coming out until March.
---
also, i love that they are getting rid of bugs, but they keep saying that they are going to provide full patch notes in these blog updates, then continue to give us a watered down list of the highlights. 
---
hopefully this patch is as good as the last..
---
Good question, curious to know as well. My *guess* would be that bounties don't get applied for PVP, but still do for the other bounty activities (stealing, damaging CAMP). Or maybe they get applied based on a level discrepancy? 
---
I'd have about 550 caps with this as an endgame player, and while I'd be all for it, factor in the seven factions and the 25K limit most players would hit that in no time.
---
I thought synths were only in the fallout 4 area?
---
when you can open 25k of them and be at max caps with an unlimited supply of them does it matter if its 1 at a time? 
---
It would be quicker than travelling to vendors to vendor them and get the 200 caps that way.
---
This explains why I've had so many people trying to buy cola's off my main character. Too bad he's a cola nut.
---
Finally a fix for the ‘early warning’ quest
---
The linked post's content was removed. What was it you did that lead to the ban? What was your response to Beth?
---
I bulk stuff frequently, sometimes with the Super Duper 3 perk card on to get some extra. I usually press Space about 5/second but I never noticed any lag (if you don't count the SD proc indicator showing up tens of seconds after the crafting).
---
hehe not a bad thing really...unless ofc you already are a crimo then I would suggest a career change!
---
I agree. Some goofy is alright but from what I've seen so far almost everything released in the store has been silly. I did see a camo hunting rifle paint last week but they only had it for 3 days! Something like that should permanently be in the store. Some more retro-future fallout themed content will be hugely welcomed.
---
That's true, I forgot dupers have no life.
---
This is concerning, but I know for a fact I can make the server unresponsive but just crafting food or stimpacks and I can do it repeatedly .. so it is definitely taking on the same attributes as duping which is obviously not the case. It may have been that a duper was on the same server, idk. But if I spam too quickly the server will become unresponsive and then resume again if I stop.
---
Yes just you
---
Yeah, it'll be great when all the exploiters get to take full advantage in a 'competitive' PvP environment.
---
Still nothing for people who don't pvp nice.
---
At the beginning go slow, loot/explore anything, and limit yourself to acquiring rank 1 cards.  It gives you a chance to experience a lot without heavy investment or regret.  When you get to level 5, turn pacifist mode right back on in the settings menu.  
---
In addition to the visual bug that pops up sometimes, remember that some of the vendors have shared cap pools (Responders and Raiders particularly).
---
can confirm, level 176
---
It's hard to compare displayed damage without also naming active perks and related S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats. My Vampire's The Dragon shows 227 something IIRC on my melee build, no rifle perks active. My guess, though: that 804 is the total damage (minus explosive?), and someone has to look into the number of bullets fired by a TS Dragon. Is it really 8 bullets, or rather 5, like with TS shotties' pellets?
---
True but I don't think the nerf will stop that, as it seems to be over killing them significantly. Know what I mean? Like I one shot things with mine but I have no skills in it, i don't even have the 15% damage boost from bloody mess in luck on this character yet lol
---
added to the list, i got loads of supply drops. Gonna have loads of fun tonight.
---
And much more... 
---
I'm. On 1080p and everything on high. What are your settings? 
---
I usually invite random people on the map so we can travel for free and share perks. But people are scared of the camps destroyers... but i got some nice guys sometimes. It was fun
---
Im really not that interested in a more hardcore pvp mode. Id prefer new content to the already existing world.
---
I like to scare new players with it (now that I granted you low class leather armor you are a worthy foe for me) unpacks minigun and starts shooting at level 2 player while in pacifist mode (MUHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHAR DIE DIE DIE)
---
It scares the shit out of them and they log off immediatly.
---
I havent boosted my explosives perk completely yet. 
---
O I've been buying them off people for a cap a piece, people don't care to do them but their happy to go pick one up. 
---
What console?
---
It only takes a bit over 2 weeks (\~18 days) of easy grinding to his the cap max of 25k so it isn't really much of a disadvantage 
---
No I'm talking about the one that repairs my Gauss rifle (and only this weapon) that never has ammo
---
*Spends Caps to join event*
---
*Event timer ends soon after, making it impossible to finish the event*

Why downvote constructive criticism? He’s right! 
---
Finally
---
unfortunately it seems like i didnt use my pipboy or access a stash box in either of my two recent screen caps. but i am confident that this will be worked out soon they will be able to see everything. haven't heard of anyone else getting a response back yet. so there is hope 
---
You're missing a key thing here - Bethesda *Softworks* (the publisher) and Bethesda *Game Studios* (the developer) are different things. Rage is *published by* Bethesda Softworks, while Fallout and TES are Bethesda Game Studios titles.
---
Basically, Todd doesn't have anything to do with Rage, and it has no effect on BGS.
---
Fallout 76 is actually a lot closer to DayZ than any mmo out there. 
---
Heck i wouldn't be suprised if they used the hive(the dll for saving player data in dayz) since its available on github.
---
Because I don't want the game that I rather enjoy to be buggy? 
---
You've reached the point in the game if you are a new player soloing that you hit a brick wall in terms of trying to do the main story quests.  The game tries to keep higher level players challenged, so it spawns higher level monsters when they're around those areas.  And unfortunately the main story quests brings you right to them on a regular basis at that point.
---
You can either try server hopping until you're the first player in that area, in which case the level 50+ radscorpion (or whatever) in front of the Top of the World elevator will be replaced with normal level 10 bugs that are supposed to be there.  Or do what I did and wait until you're level 50 before trying to solo those quests.  Or you could always get high level friends to help clear out the higher level mobs.
---
Collect wood and use it to cook meat and boil water.
---
Collect junk and scrap it ASAP. (you can do it at any workbenches you find if you don't have a CAMP where you can build them)
---
Collect weapons and armor and scrap them to learn mods.
---
Use the Overseer's camp Stash box to store your scrapped junk and anything else you don't want to carry (be careful to use your stash box and not the overseer's box).  
---
Early event like "Leader Of the Pack" is a great way to get low level (1-10?) legendary weapon and armors.  
---
Activate public workshops for XP and plans and chems and water.  
---
Survival mode will be an absolute shit show unless there is a MASSIVE overhaul to certain legendary weapon and armour perks.    
---
    
---
Sorry. I want to be positive but it seems that the devs are unaware of just how broken clued up and well equipped players will make their "new pride and joy".
---
 But there are four possible spawn locations for power armor in Watoga (that I know of). If I need a core, I’ll just take one without having to wait around. 
---
yes just you, you are the only person out of thousands to want this, because no one else complains about the current system ever...
---
Yeah, I would must prefer survival mode to be new characters only.
---
Yeah i am not interested in that either. I dont feel like losing caps over and over
---
Good riddance to the hand-written checklist of plans &amp; recipes.
---
What everyone else said, plus Pyschotats increases your damage by 25% for a period of time if you are doing something like scorch queen.
---
Great details!  
---
1) I'll check the keyword usage in the game files to see what is going on there, but I'd agree it should be one or the other. Heavy weapon makes sense, considering the bulk, operation, etc.   
---
2) still trying to figure out why the ammunition usage broke between FO4 and FO76, but helpful workaround.
---
Yeah I think we will still be one shotting things after the nerf but I could be wrong.  I mean these are 2* and 3* legendary weapons so maybe they should one shot things lol.  I made this second character for a challenge anyway, if need be, I guess I'll make another lol
---
very quick as far as what iv read in the forums .
---
crap I said into instead of inside
---
which ones dont stack?
---
very quick 
---
Awesome!
---
I myself have never seen him, but it's unfortunately kind of a letdown for me.
---
Hopefully this survival mode causes all these assholes that love to grief players to go to that mode and leave us on adventure.
---
glad they were specific.
---
i wasn't sure if much more was included in this patch.
---
A friend and i found a cache of free stuff the other night. Hes like i cant even use this stuff!! We were both several hundred pounds Overweight and trudged back to camp lol
---
I hope they dont remove tse i just friggin got one!! And my buddy needs a few more lvls to even use it lol
---
I believe you, read through your comments in the other thread and this one. 
---
This may be the internet but Bethesda have lied to me more than you have recently lol Still waiting on the duping to be fixed and this better communication that Todd promised just before Xmas (Xmas sales hey).
---
Ya never know though, maybe something in your game footage might help with the ban removal etc.
---
Just take over a workshop and drop in junk excavators. Off the top of my head, Charleston landfill has 3 different sites where you can farm screws, springs, and other assorted junk. While you're there, pop a generator on the water purifier that produces 5 purifieds every 5 minutes. Once you've got all this set up, hit Charleston.  Like someone else said the Charleston Herald for typewriter's, desk fans, ect.  You can grab a bunch of stuff from the AVR medical center and DMV as well. Basically any office building.  Between each run, fast travel back to the landfill, collect screws/springs/water, then head back out into the wasteland to scrounge for more junk. Keep doing this and soon you'll be carrying a ton of water in your inventory.  Go to the Charleston Fire department and sell water and junk you don't need to vendor bot, then buy bulk screws and springs from him.  Keep selling water, looting super mutants for caps, snagging cap stashes, and killing the two grafton monsters in Charleston and you'll soon have quite a few caps. Then you fast travel to Morgantown Station to buy bulk screws/springs from the vendor there. Then off to the Top of The World vendor for more bulk screws. All the while those 3 junk extractors are still pulling screws and springs out of the ground for you.
---
Don't sell or scrap your Blade of Bastet if/when you get it because it can be upgraded. This is my single biggest regret in the game so far.
---
Even if its 2 to 4 shots i wouldn't complain.  Killing a supermutant warlord with a non legendary weapon is like trying to shoot a brick wall down with a pistol 
---
You do realize Bethesda even from E3 said Fallout 76 WILL support mods but the earliest their support will arrive is November 2019. That was kinda a big deal at launch. 
---
There gloves cost more?
---
Or a pet baby mudcrab....or really any pet like in ESO, I mean they don't do anything but still they are cute af
---
Pretty sure the only reason it got fixed is because some one failed to notify ebay that the duped items were not allowed to be sold by 3rd party websites, ebay would have removed them. 
---
I get the same when taking things out of my stash too
---
I just want my kleo assaultron sexbot sidekick. Is that too much to ask... and dont forget to have her say yes my thane
---
Yeah, my bad - came across [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9uzdpd/tips\_for\_playing\_fallout\_76/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9uzdpd/tips_for_playing_fallout_76/) which is a superb breakdown! Should be pinned so it's easier to find. 
---
The Robobrains make it a massive pain in the ass though 
---
What about a S.H.O.P feature? 
---
The Free States: The Remnants Chapter (PC)
---
I want the Curly Bun. Not sure how it'll look, but I wants it.
---
They broke it during the last patch, needs to be fixed. It is annoying. I would get fired if I QA tested this and it passed QA .. unbelievable I know.
---
i think my account was auto flagged for either having too much bulk junk on me at one time . like 30 bulk plastic . or from crafting things into bulk too fast as those were the last two things i did the night before i received the ban notice . aside from that i was just instigating pvp interactions all day . im not huge on the crafting aspect. i just do it when i need to fix something or bulk something to make some caps . im not some trader who sits around and fixes guns for people all day. so those were the only tow things that stuck out to me that could have been the reasoning to my ban . 
---
Agreed. They should not be transferable. 
---
As an example of prices, though. Here are a few hypotheticals
---
1) I find the game's first 5 star legendary weapon and want to sell it. It has arguably some of the best effects. I know in game I can make around 1400 caps per day from vendors minus traveling expenses. But I also know that a duper can make as many caps as they can drink nuka colas so long as they have mules lined up to unload each 25000 caps they aquire. I get an offer for a million caps which is most likely duped. Since I don't condone duping, I turn it down. But then I have no way to know who is a duper or who isn't. I try and think of an accurate price based on my own experiences in game;  knowing how much I can make from Vendors; and also if I were legimately buying and selling daily to gain a profit. Even if I settled on, say, 50000 caps, I have no guarantee that the item won't be taken and reproduced endlessly and reappear on the market 2 weeks later at 200 caps. The obvioius outcome of this conondrum is that people who get items legimiately through hard work are never able to confidently capitalize on them with any degree of confidence, even more so if they care about having a strong economy
---
2)  I offer a service. I'll build you an elaborate mansion for 10000 caps. I have  gotten all building plans after much hard work. My buildings have been featured on Bethesda's twitter, and I have a following of people on Instagram who follow me just to see my CAMPs. The estimated time to build you this mansion is 10 hours of in-game time.... Now if a duper can dupe 10000 nuka colas and gain those 10000 caps in half an hour, how then am I supposed to feel that my work and skillset has any value when anyone can just print their own money on the spot to pay me?
---
Gameception!!!! I like  it
---
Low level scaling is garbage. Now we need to make pvp purpose characters with as long level possible to get needed perks.  
---
The vast majority of people who PVP are going to simply stay in the normal mode anyways.  As stands catching off guard people is still more lucrative than finding and fighting people who expect to PVP.  Only way around that would be making something more valuable than junk and aid drop.  The cap increase idea is one thing but might not be worth the time invested since you have to actually find someone in the first place.  
---
&gt;simple programming basics
---
Look Im glad you took CS I and think you are Linus Torvalds but those CTDs happen when there are cell conflicts typically. The mods for 76 are basically just interface mods. Thats my point, there are no mods for 76 out right now that would cause severe crashing like you see in the other Bethesda games.
---
I suggest actually working with the CE before applying your other irrelevant experiences here, less you continue to look like a smug fool. 
---
this isnt the only time iv heard something like this unfortunately 
---
Tip 1: dont come and try to get a TSE shotgun at level 5. Play through the game how its intended and worry about end game items when you are end game. 
---
Tip 2: you only get so many special points to allot, stops at lvl 50 so assign special points carefully. 
---
Tip 3: fully read and understand the perk system. It is actually very well put together and can make for some crazy character builds. If you are confused search or ask about a perk. 
---
Tip 4: if you have friends on the game run with them, if not meet some guys in game. Most people are pretty cool and wont mind helping out. 
---
Tip 5: play how you want to play. Dont be influenced by current meta because it is going to change once the balance patch comes out. Find what you like and build towards it or be rounded in 2 alor 3 areas. You cannot be great at everything due to Tip 2. You can move special points after level 50 at the cost of a perk point so dont worry if you change your mind a little later, I did and I was fine. 
---
Tip 6: scrap most early weapons and armors. It unlocks mods for these items and you will be thankful once you start finding legendaries. 
---
Tip 7: manage inventory and weight well. Springs, screws, aluminum are always good but you dont need even 300 leather and others. 
---
Tip 8: save crafting perks until later in the game. Instead focus on what you want your character to be strong in. You wont have great plans for a time anyway so no reason to use the perk points on stuff you cant take full advantage of early on. 
---
Tip 9: try to avoid power leveling (at least first time through) this game has a lot to offer and is more enjoyable early level since it is harder. You will run out of stimpacks and will be fighting for ammo (if you aren't melee) but later on you will cherish those memories. 
---
Tip 10: explore explore explore.... oh and explore. There are tons of side missions and quests to partake on you just have to explore.
---
Tip 11 (optional): ignore all of these tips and play a different way, after all it is Fallout. 
---
It's nice when your trying to atleast trade and run a shop. Cant tell you how many times I wish I could pull up my inventory to see what i have. I dont think it would need patches or updates like crazy at all
---
Roses are red, I want an apple,
---
Can't meet you in watoga, cause I can't fast travel.
---
Nice I will bookmark it and remember to send it out when people ask. Thanks for sending it
---
I loved the use of the word ‘competitive’.  *sarcastic face*
---
Sounds like someone needs a trip to see Vera at the Whitesprings Spa. And while you're there, do give Flauresca at *Live Chic* my regards, I'm sure she can fix you up with something nice to wear. ;)
---
Damn those look terrible, the last ones alright with the hair knot.
---
How about ...if they were tracking how many nuka colas people drank, and the numbder is over 5000, ban the account.
---
Does Perfect Storm work?
---
Hm, doesn't have flame barrel but does have beta wave tuner which adds some flame damage.
---
Curious how much.
---
Lol, true.  Though I haven't tried with any armor penetration skills yet. I know there is one for heavy guns in power armor and a few for other weapons like rifle
---
What if the "100 + Level" was replaced with just "150"?
---
There's another post on this somewhere.  Bethesda said it will be fixed in a future update.
---
I'm running a handmade &amp; a lever action right now.  I have already built &amp; scrapped that many.
---
My only must tip is that you should decide on how you like to play, and then pre plan a build around it. There are some decent builds on this site [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/builds/](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/builds/)
---
\+ karma
---
Aren’t most items in the game capable of being duped? Boiling it down to the Nuka Cola in general is missing the point. It’s really just the exploit itself that’s the issue.
---
Has been happening to me a lot lately, servers are bugged or something, changing servers helps but is annoying, sometimes I have to load in 3 - 4 times before it works, something recent seems to have changed, this never happened before a fix ago. Feels like they hot fixing stuff and breaking it at the same time. Definitely seems like a new issue in the last week or this week or even maybe in the last few days. Jump servers it should fix things eventually .. game is still fun, just be patient ... I can't stop myself playing .. 
---
a "bulk max" button would work nicely as well
---
Can others destroy your camp? 
---
Nope, not directly. 
---
But its all part of Bethesda and if the bottom line for enough of there products is hit then they will have to take notice and will star asking why internally. Which will lead back to who ever's responsible.
---
Im not missing anything anyways, Rage are missing a pre order though (well 3 but who's counting hey...oh wait Bethesda prob are)

when ever i leave my power armour i never get the normal pip-boy it only ever shows the power armour pip boy screen and when ever i enter my power armour my strength does not increase
---
They expected this to be Fallout : Battle Royale.  That’s why the content push is towards PvP.  I don’t think there was much PVE planned.  It took them by surprise most folks want to be vendors and other role playing characters instead of just running around shooting each other.
---
ya . i tried to reply back to them with in game footage but it was too long to send in an email .i didn't want to doctor it to make it shorter . maybe i can post it all to video and send them a link . 
---
* And much more! 
---
I'm wary of pulled-back hairstyles...I feel like a lot of them make my forehead look weird. x_x
---
Yes, but I think most of the time people have a lot of etiquette. That is one great thing about this game.
---
Has anyone else noticed an extra loading screen recently. Every time Iog back in I load into where my camp is for a few seconds (the area the camp not there. One time I loaded in upside down which was neat) then I get one more loading screen then I am at my camp.
---
Very strange.
---
Xbox btw. 
---
soooooooo nothing new.  
---
*Goes back to his cave and lets FO76 collect dust*
---
I'm also doing 1080p high
---
Then why get mad over bans on mods and people useing them when it's not November 2019. Also I hope you realize that since launch Bethesda explained how there be no support for mods and no one is allowed to mod at this time. Sorry your all butt hurt about this. But it's their mmo. They call the shots. You don't like it? Then as EA put it."Don't play it".
---
Rockstar did it and they worked out fine in the endgame, they had a horrible time with cheaters and bug abusers until they took action against the toxic YouTube community that was the promoter of them. Bethesda is completely within their positive rights to take action against hackers and bug abusers; anybody who supports that toxicity isn't on the right side of anything. (I'm looking at you Youtubers who backed up the players abusing hacks to get to the dev room and then acting like it was completely fine.) The sooner Bethesda takes actions against Youtubers who go through multiple accounts trying to undermine their efforts to stop bug abuse the better.
---
I tried it and it looks awsome! It feels like the fps goes down though...
---
This is honestly super frustrating when I have multiple sets. They have the skins for it... I would think they could just check a box.
---
Since the latest update whitespring and to an extent have become unplayable for me. I play on PS4 and sometimes have to restart the game just to load it again after logging out. When I'm in whitespring and sometimes watoga I have between 2-5 minutes before the game will crash on me. I had problems with freezing before the update. I could live with that bit the endless crashing and reloading is killing me.
---
Sounds like good changes/additions, but PLEASE can we get some word about more storage space in our camps? At this point I believe it's been at 600 longer than it was at 400. How much longer do they need to wait before upping that number significantly?
---
Watoga vendors sell it, I believe I see if often at the Phoenix Vendor, you need to server hop.
---
I had this happen to me today as well, and a quick search led me to this post.  I was in Watoga Station when it happened, and grabbed a screenshot.  I do think it's probably an orbital scan beacon or whatever, as I heard a noise right before it happened (and I also saw someone else with the effect on them).
---
[Pink glow from first person](https://i.imgur.com/IbFPB1w.jpg)
---
I'd be okay with displaying collectibles, even if it means it taps into my CAMP building budget.
---
I can't say if the issues are due to it being rushed, or too small a test base.  
---
**Now some perspective:**
---
Being a mod author myself (with some more complex game play change mods)  I can say with a great deal of authority what works for 5 to 10 beta testers won't for 10,000 (I've got a couple mods that had several thousand downloads in the first day / two for example).  In practical application what was a "flawless and bug free product" turned out to have dozens of minor to major things to resolve (which is easy to have happen with a few hundred thousand edits to a game engine).  
---
As a result I learned from the experience and try to expand the test base for a second beta phase, then expect a number of conflicts and problems to occur.  
---
I also have a tendency to go into a communications blackout when I'm doing a major update / change, because the time it takes to read, process, troubleshoot and refine eats up hours a day, and kills productivity. In one week another mod author and I spent 40 hours (no, I'm serious) troubleshooting and resolve bugs for an issue that turned out to be caused by a 3rd party (a mod manager conflict).  
---
None of the above is to excuse or justify Bethesda's mis-steps and issues, but sometimes perspective can change how we see things, and how patient we are.
---
Or their client just crashed :P
---
Alright will do, cause I’m at him rn 
---
Agree, should be mandatory fresh start, that way everyone is equal from the get go.
---
 if people can transfer their main to survival the entire servers are going to be full of bobble head 2 shot explosive exploiters and no one but others like them are going to stand a chance, it'll be a blood bath especially if they create a leader board of kills because they'll all scramble to be at the top 
---
I cry every time I scrap a bot model. 
---
And you've learned all the upgrades?
---
starfield should have flaming laser swords
---
While I'm not interested in Survival Mode myself, I'm happy the PvP fans will have something new to do.  And maybe it will help revitalize the game on Twitch somewhat.
---
Is Fix It Good unbugged now? It's no longer one hit more than full health?
---
They said they don't officially support it - if your game breaks, it's on you and the mod.
---
They didn't say they weren't allowed. [You can read their official stance here](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/kw/mod)
---
Cause there are people like my self who are level 37 and have yet to get a legendary weapon of any type and so instead rock the homemades.
---
Hooooot poooo-taaaa-tooooo

I'm wanted multiplayer Fallout.
---
" You’re free to create new characters for Survival mode, and encouraged to do so, but you can also use your existing ones.  " oopf
---
exactly I'm not sure how they thought this would even remotely be a good idea in the first place it makes no sense. And economy reset is the best thing that could happen to this game.
---
Harpers Ferry as well. I've seen it at both.
---
Are you playing in borderless window mode? It might help.
---
I'm actually interested in this. However everyone should need to make a need character in that mode. Allowing "adventure" mode characters defeats the purpose.
---
I like how the LMG has no mods, takes multiple perks from multiple stats to even be usable, one of the most expensive to buy (I think only the gauss rifle costs more from vendors) and craft and maintain. 20 308 rounds takes half the materials of 180 50 cal rounds. And it'll pea shoot those all away in a tenth of a second. 
---
And it's pathetic in every way. The only way I've made it useful is having an anti armor explosive one. But with explosive getting nerfed it'll go back to being useless again. 
---
and ballistic fiber for scrapping armor
---
Only TS, not Explosive. Explosive is not changing at all.
---
No one is butt hurt because as far as I’m aware no one has really claimed to be banned for mods yet. In fact quite the opposite. It’s more the point that this game is, as my name says, painful to play. Scrapping mods that you spend 500 caps on because they contain steel and you’ve run out in your stash is kinda dumb when it took 12 hours to find. A mod that fixes that just makes sense. The reason for mods now is to make the game more comfortable to play rather than wait until the end of the year. Honestly you seem like the most butt hurt person in this post. JS
---
I have always been against mods but the I had to make an exception for the Known Plans mod. Many blessings to the person that wrote it despite it about to become moot. 
---
Alot of people didn't pick up the game because of how the adventure pvp system is. It may be to late as those people probably have moved on. I personally enjoy shoot on sight games. 
---
TIL game devs go around asking possible players what do they want in their game they're about to make 
---
Any idea on price 
---
We can have robotic bodies and still be within the law. 
---
Not full synth level, but close to it. 
---
We're not being banned for using mods
---
You are being banned for using mods that inject things into the game that they can't see what's being changed (reshade and cheat engine) that *are* used for definitively advantage giving purposes 
---
Look, I get that griefing needs to be discouraged or punishable in some way, shape, or form. But I feel that the current system suffers from a complete failure of imagination. It sounds like a child designed it in a game of pretend. "Okay, you can do damage to me, but only chip damage until I shoot back. And if you shoot me or attack my base, you can't see me on the map, but I can see you. And you can't hurt me or anyone else coming to kill you until I'm ready, otherwise it's a do-over."  
---
I mean, why even \*allow\* players to damage other players or bases if they can barely do any damage, and are made completely powerless until they're killed? Instead of making all these unrealistic, half-baked measures, why not make it a boon to the game? Instead of punishing Wanted players by basically making them powerless until killed, why not make more of a game out of it? Maybe bounty hunters can get legendary gear if you're \*really\* wanted? Maybe there are anti-raider systems like the scorchbeast detection systems? Maybe there are "Wanted" posters plastered everywhere the more "Wanted" you get? Maybe jam their comms and make a realtime quest out of it similar to Daily quests. If you actually reward other bounty hunters with more than just 10 caps and some junk, I assure you, the Wanted player would be at a disadvantage enough without taking away their ability to do any damage until shot first, and without putting a big red blinking bullseye on their exact, realtime location (an estimate, "last seen" location, or a red circle around their estimated location would be good enough).  
---
You could even take away their ability to talk to quest NPC bots while they're wanted, as you are now an enemy of Appalachia. Hell, maybe they even add bounty hunter bots too. Pretty much anything is better than the current system. And Todd Howard did say that Fallout 76 would basically be a player-driven community and they would add player-requested features and content as the game evolves.
---
I tried clearing the cache a couple of times, i turned off and on again the Ps4 but unfortunately it didn't work...it seems i can't play anymore
---
Please see my answer to AvatarofChaosvX
---
😂😂😂
---
Yeah, my hope is that it's designed in such a way that not *everyone* who plays it will be a blood-thirsty murderer.
---
I want to make guesses about who is friend or foe, not assume everyone is the latter.
---
Died randomly to I'm not even sure what during a queen event in 1 shot an then disconnect before reaching my dropped loot. Forgot to place my flux back into storage an lost all of it. Had about 60-90 of each flux..
---
I like you.
---
Wow finally marked learned plans...that’s gonna save me millions of caps
---
Well a part of ppl dont care about pvp and another part wants pvp but get annoyed by ppl being in pacifist mode. Now they can do survival mode  and shoot each other to pieces 
---
Destroying a base isn’t griefing.  It’s a built in mechanic of the game.  Maybe play the game you bought instead of trying to make it the game you have in your head.
---
Wow I've been wearing the fatigues under my PA, didn't know about this. Is it reflected under Stats on your pipboy?
---
The camp budget does not increase.
---
That's where I've never hopped my hundreds of times to find him. 
---
No mention of stability or optimization?
---
I hate being so crass and blunt about a game I am so personally invested in, but some times you get to 'that' point.
---
Don't get me wrong, I do love this game. As others have pointed out in the comments, there are people out there who do love the silliness that the Atom Shop offers right now, but there is a core bunch of us who prefer a more traditional experience as well and I am hoping that the marketing and monetization team will eventually acknowledge that moreso than they already have.
---
Missing out of the Blackbird paint was one of my biggest missteps so far. I wish I would have known exactly how limited it would have been so I could have picked it up.
---
Another thing that bothers me, particularly about the skins and certain outfits, are that you cant wear a "paint" overtop of a modified armor piece (from what people have reported, anyways). If this changes --  I would have gladly bought the Combat Armor camo, but until then since it isn't limited time -- I wont be buying it. 
---
Same goes for things like the Hazmat suit. It shouldn't unequip all my armor just to wear it overtop. Maybe this is in part due to risk versus reward, but I don't know.
---
the other day i was at flatwoods and a clean space helmet was for sale..i was surprised..but i wasnt gonna pay 252 caps for it
---
I found it at harpers ferry  the vendor bot sells it
---
This.. is awesome.  I'm going to see if I can read it when I print it or not
---
They keep pushing those, and cryolators. I just haven't bitten yet.
---
Read all plans and recipes you pick up. Go to your pipboy and find the notes tab. It was 2 weeks before i learned that and they took up alot of weight. If you arent going to use ammo, like missiles drop them. Dont hang onto any gear thats not 3 diamond/star. Scrap weapons/armor at benches to learn upgrades for them. Get a hazmat suit asap.
---
That, among other things
---
I've seen this issue since beta. Usually I'll stab the air in their direction until they stop hurting me, but sometimes I'll just run away.
---
I've been looking too. Someone said there's one "outside Watoga", but I've been looking all around there and haven't found anything.  If it doesn't really exist, then probably the closest thing will be "Boody Kate's Grindhouse", which is just North-East of Riverside manor.
---
I miss the Starlight too - it was the trading hub of my Commonwealth settlement empire. I built up and modded the shit out of that place. Good times. 
---
And one from r those into... disciplinary recreation. 
---
I think 600 caps?  I am not sure. Might been 200 to 300 too
---
Yeah it is, especially for the reason op did it.
---
Wooooa deep post man, reddit all star here.
---
I'm happy about it , even though I don't kill people usually unless they're wanted and a level I can stand a chance of winning lol
---
What is bothering me though is the ability to transfer your main to this new mode, it'll be hell if all those bobble head 2 shot exploiters join it and ruin it for everyone in that mode, it would be better if it was a mandatory fresh start 
---
I agree with your sentiment but they aren't proposing "transfer" of characters; the character can freely connect to either game type back and forth based on what they have announced.
---
Well you sound confident about it so i'd rather give you the benefit of the doubt than Bethesda (Canvas bags anyone? Nuka Cola Scam? ESO duping).
---
You should get your account unlocked, and if not then this next few weeks round here is going to be wild, everyone that spams the button when crafting getting banned and being accused of duping whilst the real dupers are still selling weapons and caps on ebay and stuff lmao 
---
Could be worth uploading the vid's if you can and stand your ground if they re-instate your account id be expecting apologies and access to a pass or something for free Atom store items or maybe a code for rage 2 or something.
---
If you haven't broken the rules, you've been locked out of your account for using the game the way Bethesda released it, that's not on.
---
Hell all them you tube click baiters will destroy Bethesda with this stuff if your being honest lmao
---
They didn't mention stability improvements or optimization in their latest info. Wth
---
I agree everyone should have to start new in survival mode . 
---
We’re also planning to award you double the Caps when you kill another player
---
great!
---
 and they may drop their Aid or other items in addition to their Junk
---
questionable!
---
Thank you for the pic, people were swearing up and down the bans werent happening. Im ancious to see where it goes, good luck op
---
I can second that. I don't use the turbo button of my Hori PS4 controller any longer with the game when crafting, because the lag is embarrassing. Especially after I learned that it's not just for me, but server-wide. :-/
---
You win:) That's the most useless vampiric Item out there!
---
I would figure a high level would have used missiles or artillery.
---
Stats wise though the T-60 is pretty inferior to the Ultracite PA isn't it?  If that's the case, it kind of sucks that the only PA that can have it applied isn't very strong.  Can it at least hold it's own on the SBQ?  I've never beaten her in any PA.  None of my friends play anymore so I feel I have to play in PA to survive. 
---
Too soon.
---
I would be down for something like that. Anything to offer more specialization and role playing opportunities!
---
I don't code games.
---
I have a very deep sympathy for failed complex codes, because coders are often under pressures from people who do not do coding.  It's unfortunate.
---
It's terribly unfortunate, also, that you choose to be insulting.    You refer to my "irrelevant" experience, without knowing what it is.  You intimate that I'm a smug fool, based on reading a few posts I have made online.
---
And so I shall deescalate the situation.  Candy and Flowers to you, Brother.
---
Roses are red I need to level 
---
Can’t meet in Watonga
---
Cause I can’t fast travel 
---
Ehh.  While it's nice that they're showing us which plans we know...
---
I feel like development isn't heading in the direction I'd hoped it would.
---
I have zero interest in PVP.
---
Well, I guess others disagree but I think you are way underleveled for that area.  Even without high level characters going there which can spawn tougher enemies (which they do a lot for the rail station vendor/raider vendors), there are native high level supermutants and robots -- notably Col. Gutsies and assaultrons -- that frequent the rail yard, raider camps, and surrounding woods.  I camped in that area for a while and you can even get really nasty packs of yao guai and the occasional deathclaw or two.  Just because the next step of a quest is in an area doesn't mean it's safe to immediately go there, the game does not seem to have any level check when moving you to the next stage of an assignment, it just assumes you'll get there when you are finally able to.  My advice is to backtrack a bit and explore Whitesprings and areas west of it to level up and get more perk cards to help you out.  Good luck
---
Though I don't plan to use this mode I agree 100%. This has "sit outside Vault 76 and grief new characters" written all over it.
---
Thanks everyone!
---
For further clarification: I want to be able to wear the BoS mod with the Camo Paint and still retain the BoS logo through the paint because I think it would make me look like a BAMF.
---
Help inspire "Roleplay", as I have said in many of my posts before.
---
Did you log out in a weird location?  
---
Last suggestion, a couple people have posted that uninstalling and then reinstalling after a reboot of their console resolved their issue, it's the only other thing I personally can think of.
---
You had my curiosity. Now you have my attention.

"(UPDATED) Changes to the Two-Shot and Explosive Legendary Mods: The Two-Shot and Explosive Legendary Mods will be undergoing a few balance changes in this next patch. We know that there has been some frustration over how powerful these mods are, particularly when combined and used in player vs. player combat. With Patch 5, the damage bonus for Two Shot Legendary modded weapons has been reduced from +100% to +25% damage. The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100%. Note: This was a misunderstanding in what was being addressed with these mods. They will still be available in the world but are just undergoing some balance changes. Thank you for your feedback, and we look forward to hearing your thoughts on the changes."
---
Wishing that they some Day allow twoshot quad weapons or add violent efect from fo4
---
And add a timer to the world map so we know how long the event has before it ends!
---
I hate spending the caps to get somewhere only to see it's almost timed out and there's no way I could complete it in time
---
If your on PC i got a full set of ultracite plans i can give you to rebuild the PA you lost
---
So please don’t label this “survival mode” this isn’t survival mode as much as it is just pvp enabled by the sounds of it. I need more difficulty in fallout 76, as someone who’s played hard core/iron man saves and mods on all the previous fallouts back to fallout 3  for thousands of hours the first thing I noticed was just how little punishing the environment was and the enemies felt spongey, but now it’s just 1 shot everything. IMO survival should be about making the whole game as a whole harder, not just pvp enabled all the time, which is what I feel like is gonna happen and get “survival mode” slapped on it with perma death or something. 
---
Exactly. Moving them off will only improve the regular game. 
---
ballistic fiber is like gold
---
Did you mean to write: Noooooooooooooo...!
---
Flare guns also replace legendary loot =/
---
If I understand correctly doesn't someone need to be in an area in order to trigger an event? I know that for the powering up events, if you walk near a power plant and it hasn't been triggered recently it will start the event. Same thing with distant thunder and the other cranberry bog events.
---
I basically depend on my excavator power armor 
---
I think some of their servers are corrupt last Sat all day fighting to stay in a world 4-5 bad then nothing since 
---
I would be if everyone had to start fresh other wise what’s the point . 
---
Did the same thing for that brotherhood quest that gives you a set, dropped it then couldn’t pick them up because I was lvl 42 at the time and the set was lvl 50 so I had to walk for like an hour to my camp by Fred’s bbq because the set weighs like 100 pounds lol. Three deathclaws and getting chased by a scourgebeast for the first half kinda made it a real chore.
---
You have played a fallout before, right?  You know this isn’t the Sims.  Those settlers are lucky they havent met an Overboss yet.
---
No, it's NOT working as intended, so there's no debuff to show under stats. It is, however, obvious when you look at these screenshots. The only difference is underarmor, but look at the DR, ER, and RR numbers. It's actually -58 to DR and ER, and -60 to RR.

&gt;dumpsters
---
Where you spawn for the Whitesprings Service Entrance, do a 180 and go in the little alcove with the fusion generators. 
---
That's true as well.  Totally forgot about those.  I usually only see drills or stringers though.
---
I guess you could argue the survival mode is for people who don’t PvP. In theory, it sounds like those who want to PvP will gravitate towards survival, leaving adventure with more PvE oriented players. I guess we’ll have to wait and see how that works in practice. 
---
Yeah, bad idea.
---
All I wanted was a clean cut hair from fallout 3 and NV 
---
I get why we don't have fighting pets, but why not one like ESO? Right now all I have is that stupid Brahmin.  
---
Stats wise. t-51 is best for DR and X01 is best for rads and energy. T-60 however is like the honda accord of power armor where the repair cost are pretty low and the mods are really easy to find and get.
---
So for high level encounter not in nuke zone - t51
---
For nuke zones and scorchbeasts - x01
---
For every other thing in the world - t60
---
Wouldn't it be nice if they eliminated PVP from Adventure?
---
Yeah, I think the confusion here was that you didn’t realize BoS is just a mod for combat armor of any sort. BoS isn’t a separate class of armor. 
---
'' We’re also planning to award you double the Caps when you kill another player, and they may drop their Aid or other items in addition to their Junk. Added risks and rewards like these in Survival mode PVP will make each of your deaths more devastating, and every kill you rack up much more lucrative. However, it’s important to note that these changes aren’t set in stone, and we’ll be looking to make adjustments based on playtesting and your feedback during the Survival Beta. '' If it drops my weapons or armor, it's a no for me dawg
---
I’m Fallout 4, there was a lot of times you could turn off turrets from terminals. I haven’t seen that as much in this game.
---
It would be cool if you could use hacking to reprogram turrets to attack the creatures in the area. 
---
I like how in Poseidon power plant you could set the Protectrons loose to go after ghouls.
---
More stuff like that. Hack into the terminal to change parameters like in Fertile Soil. 
---
I agree, because its gonna be a, TSE shootout. 
---
[Noooooooooooooo...!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAYtHiCjN8)
---
My wife, on \[PS4\] got stuck in two eternal load screens.  Once moving within game, and then after resetting, loading in to the game.  Load times seemed longer, too, but then they're always VERY LONG on \[PS4\].
---
Many others share your plight. I once got some Shotgun Shells and a Screwdriver off of her.
---
To everyone: Please help this spread. Don't allow Bethesda to shoot themselves in the foot again. This Survival Mode could be the Soft Reset many of us have all been asking for. Let us all band together to try to make this happen!
---
Here's what happens when I play: I snipe with a reflex sight. By the time I'm done with the area I just cleared, I've gained more ammo than I spent. Screw big weapons.
---
I hate to break it to you but I don’t think that’s quite possible. Just thinking about it if it doesn’t require power armor it’s gonna most likely require that you use radiation perks or damage resistance perks simply due to the fact it’s almost impossible to go into a nuke without power armor or a hazmat suit (which won’t allow any armor pieces). My advice would be probably to spec into damage resistance perks from melee builds but then stack up on commando and rifleman in perception to get more from guns? I don’t really know. I kinda threw in whatever I needed at that moment. I’ve never played the games in a way that required me to plan from the beginning. Hope it helps
---
I agree, the pacing on some of them are terrible. Line in the sand im standing around for over a minute each wave because the enemies havent spawned (this also happens to workshops).
---
The only thing I dont agree on is this regarding the loot:
---
&gt;it feels extremly random
---
More randomness would be better than the current "RNG” which gives me the same garbage 95% of the time. Oh great, another T60 motion assist servo plan. Let me store this on the bookcase at my camp. Oh wait.
---
This is the GOAT. I want this one so bad. 
---
Maybe u/Ladydevann is paying attention? :D
---
Yeah whatever you like and want to do 😎
---
Cool, thanks. Any idea when the patch notes are coming out for next week's update? I didn't see them in the most recent "Inside the Vault".
---
It's almost been normalized here but the duping really is a serious problem, like, a massive problem. Even if they have fixed all the dupes all those items are still out there. Saw someone offering TSE weapons for 500 caps the other day, that is completely insane. The damage is done and Bethesda seems unable to do anything about it. Right now the best we can hope for is that things even out in a year or so which, quite frankly, is unacceptable. I didn't spend money on this game to be a beta tester, a quality assurance bug reporter, or a test subject for their new multiplayer experiment. 
---
I turn the numbers into a little tune. People look at me like I'm a lunatic when I start humming  and making little noises when remembering phone numbers.
---
I have been playing since the beta on Xbox one I have spent time collecting all of the bears and any other souvenir but once something is gone unless you know the spawn and it’s rate it’s so hard to get back so just having a place to hold these things would be amazing
---
That used to happen to me in FO4 at Nuka-World with the ant swarms and I’ve noticed it in FO76 as well. They’re still killable, which is good, but it’s still annoying
---
It does to a certain lvl. I can place more  stuff compared when i was lvl 30
---
My understanding is the artillery has a hard time tracking and being effective against scorched beasts. If you have done the BoS event that uses the artillery, it has a hard time taking down even a lvl 50 scorched beast. 
---
The UI is still stretched maybe one day... 
---
Heavy weapons are fine, at least they have good perks; what really needs fixing is pistols and energy weapons.
---
I got a bloodied explosive and red Asylum uniform yesterday lol I beat the game
---
Yeah man I’ll take it!  Thanks!
---
Why is there so much attention paid to pvp when most people are pve?
---
Why not just make adventure not have pvp at all? Survival should be totally separate.
---
Are we still getting the nerf, if so can you only make it apply only to survival? 
---
When is the patch? only 6 days left in the month. Its literally the end of January now. 
---
Most of all people want to hear about new quests and events but you tell us more about a pvp mode only a small percent cares about. Im utterly confused. Maybe its just me but it seems Bethesda is completely out of touch with the players. Stop trying to force this game to be fortnite and focus on its uniqueness as a coop survival. Its an amazing game but we need actual content.
---
As a PVE player, I find it very boring. Happy for the PVP folks though. Can't please everyone all at once I suppose. 
---
Mittens?
---
Join us!
---
My philosophy is that the more mutations you have, the more valuable Class Freak becomes because that’s a lotta debuff mitigation coming from just a few perk card investments. 
---
This is annoying, but pretty simple to work around. 
---
On PS4 hit the L2 to bring counter to 25000. Next, hit L2 4 more times and your at 0. Annoying, but after a couple times muscle memory will kick in. 
---
No i just logged out near twin lakes where my camp is but the camp icon doesn't even shows up on the compass. I just found out that i can log in with my level 4 character
---
I feel the same, I don't practicality like to vats or sneak. Builds options are limited and I don't see them overhauling perks to achieve more diversity unfortunately. Maybe some items that attribute to other builds, wishful thinking.  
---
I'm not touching that mode unless the rewards are insanely good. 
---
I'm happy the Early Warnings quest is finally getting fixed.  Had that problem since launch.
---
So survival will become a bobble head 2 shot explosive paradise, everyone encountered a definite kill on sight especially if kills are recorded on leaderboards 
---
Thought they would just have their mailbox feed directly to their furnace lol.
---
I actually hang out with his sister.. she likes to live on the edge, but sometimes gets too intense
---
[https://imgur.com/JkhHU3M](https://imgur.com/JkhHU3M)
---
The only useful thing in all damm communication.
---
You on PC? Would love to host a launch party! 
---
I just read it myself and it seems that they aren't prioritising server performance at all.
---
 Absolutely insane, I don't k ow what that boardroom are discussing but it's not the right things. I'm on right now and have had to switch server 3 times due hard crashes in the middle of whitesprings, no one else here, no nuke. Just me and some ghouls. How is that worthy of a crash? 
---
No doubt. I'm definitely don't want this mode. Pretty much everyone I know who plays is PVE based. 
---
Whilst I appreciate the QoL changes I can't deny that I'm disappointed that the first content update is not raids or vaults but PvP. Might step away from the game for a year or two and see if when I come back there's any new content or if it's fully become Fallout: Battle Royale.
---
I also dislike that Survival allows using existing characters. Would be far better if it worked on some sort of seasonal system to combat dupes and other exploits. The whole losing more caps and potentially aid items? Well then people will just trade them away to alts or friends on normal servers before joining.
---
Lucky I've been fighting to play since the last update. 
---
Yeah it's annoying. Hopefully will add more control to it soon. 
---
Agreed. I’m all for the survival mode for those who are into it and I’m glad for them that they have this for their builds, but a PvP build has no place on an adventure mode server. Perhaps PvP on adventure mode should be decommissioned? 
---
Or not. Because then that punishes characters who haven't duped, and does nothing whatsoever to remove the caps already acquired by dupers.
---
Bug
---
Yes. But there is litterally no reason to play the game anymore for a lot of us that have finished the content when this game is published to be an MMO. Every mmo adds content at somewhat regular intervals usually. Were now pushing 4 months in an have yet to see anything meaningful other then them fixing bugs that we reported after the first "BETA". Remeber the hyped holiday events? Me either. We need content added, not them creating a server for people who exploit to run rampant an wreck on people more. Duping still exist an if they release this mode while it still exist God speed anyone who joins a survival server.
---
When the hell did they say that? That's kinda garbage. Well, we need some math wizards now because i dont know what would do the most damage post patch now.
---
Find a server with a nuked whitesprings, Takes me a maximum of 10mins to find one usually. GGs drop more of it then you'll know what to do with.
---
That's not how it works. If your character is over weight without power armour you can respawn only at vault 76 or the closest known location on your map. 
---
I’m so tired of people posting this, *it’s not fucking happening.* The server cannot handle the load requirements to allow people to put crap in their C.A.M.P.s!! So stop asking!!! YES it would be nice. NO it’s not happening. 
---
We live in an instant gratification society. People want everything immediately with as minimal effort put into it as possible; but all my legendaries I have fought for and earned.  I've gotten rid of a ton of weapons and armor I didn't want or need along the way, but it just made finding my Explosive Plasma Gatling that much more exciting.
---
Drop every cool item you get because there's not enough stash space to get sentimental. 
---
Why?
---
Also works for other Fallouts. I live closest to Vegas since I'm a west coaster, but it's awesome driving along the route and seeing places that were represented in the game. 
---
[This website](http://www.falloutnewvegastour.com/2011/03/introducing-my-fallout-new-vegas-tour_24.html) has a tour
---
This is great but are there really that many people who want this more than actual content? I feel like there a better things they could focus on instead of fortnite76 mode. 
---
I found the clean helmet just the other day when randomly searching around the outside of Whitesprings. Its was just laying on the ground. No idea if its normal or rare spawn.
---
Dont mind that we may drop some aid or items as long as it isn't all aid and leaves alone weapons and armor we've hearted 
---
I keep saying this everywhere. If only the 'fans' would listen to the moral of their favourite game that they worship.
---
It’s a lot of coding to make the whole price and hover deal. For selling stuff the vending machine will be fine. 
---
I agree with display, just make the display like the weapons, clothes/armor, bobble head stands in fo4 but for obvious things you want to display. 
---
As for other players destroying or stealing it, just make the item itself undestroyable and not an option for other players to take. The display can be destroyed but when repaired the items are back. 
---
For a more immersive feel you could just make it to lock and items can be stolen. Still you can’t break these items but stolen would be more real. Make the wanted level higher for the more expensive items stolen. 
---
A cool feature would be able to take a picture using one of the cameras as a home security system of the gamer tag, so you know who to hunt down later. 
---
I’m sure many of these ideas have been said but Bethesda needs to be able to code without screwing up other things in the game. 
---
Ideas are great but don’t expect miracles to happen overnight. 
---
The idea of having a store with displayed items to sell is pretty cool I admit! But I’ll take vending machines for now lol. 
---
Hey there! We're aware this is an issue currently and are working to fix it in an update. I hope to have a more solid answer for you soon! 
---
The way I see it is I’m going to use QOL “mods”/“GUI changes” however you want to call them, until/unless the game implements a version of it themselves. I’ll remove known plans since the next update will implement that into the base game which should’ve existed since day one. There are even plans that have the exact same name but different prices. I think they said something about organizing the inventory layout but I’m curious if Better inventory will be better or not
---
It isn’t patch notes
---
The blurred image to hide spoilers looked like Bob Ross. 
---
If they can put “Top of the world” tower in game then ...
---
# YAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!
---
I feel like this is a good thing that way we can separate pvp from non pvp this way adventure mode then can make non pvp in the future 
---
Totally agree keep it separate and get rid of pvp in adventure mode.
---
The crap is already in their stashboxes so..  
---
&gt;You have played a fallout before, right?
---
Yes. All of them.
---
&gt;You know this isn’t the Sims.
---
It also isn't Post-apocalyptic Asshole Simulator either. Just because the setting of the game is tough doesn't mean the players have to be selfish, entitled jerks. Also, killing someone because they're getting in the way of triggering a rare spawn isn't any kind of role-playing befitting a harsh setting. It's just one player punishing another player for something that has nothing to do with the story or plot.

I want a flying unicorn mount that drops nukes

Hello, I would like a gundam please. Actually it doesn’t have to be a gundam, it can be a mobile suit. Like I’ll take a zaku gen1 or 2 for real. A gm would be dope. Just none of the sailor moon gundam s from g gundam
---
Each event should have a chance to drop event-exclusive armor/weapons, that way people are even more inclined to participate and diversify the events in which they partake. Maybe allow events to randomly spawn as "Legendary", increase the difficulty and let the exclusives have a guaranteed drop with the possibility of a randomly rolled legendary perk or two as well.
---
I don't really think more events are necessary at the moment though. There are quite a few, they're just mostly not fun. Make the events that we have fun, then worry about adding more. 
---
Ok yeah I agree here. I think a fresh start with no gear transfers would be a much better start for the new mode
---
it would be nice to receive an apology from Bethesda .im trying to get video from other people i play with (of me) so i can account for my last 48 hours of game play as proof to them. if i have to send in a support ticket after being unbanned because i missed something limited time in the atom shop i was waiting for .then so be it . i actually was hoping some YouTube would take this information if this is new to everyone and make it more publicly known. so they change there method of banning . an to bring it to everyone attention so no one else has to experience the same issues im currently facing 
---
Just delete Bobbleheads from the game, can't really imagine anyone would really care apart from dupers. Or at least keep them only as a cosmetic to fill a potential 'bobblehead display' in our CAMPs.
---
Yup me and my crew run a lvl 5 character who runs into players aggros them n then at the same time we kill them
---
And you should.  
---
I spent a stupid amount of time collecting bears, making sure I didn't scrap them, and then found I couldn't maintain the effort.

I want a bear collection!!

It's almost as if randomly generated loot is random... :)
---
Best he not.  Your answer is nonsense
---
But more budget? Please? My camp is so dark
---
I appreciate what your trying to put out.. but the resolution of those images makes it so you can't read any of the text.
---
Not trying to be an ass, just cant read it.
---
Thanks.
---
Since afaik they still didnt fix the class freak / herd mentality / egghead / barbarian / evasive bug, how about all minus 3 lol. Painful as heck. 
---
&gt; She also adorably called the Vault Boy "Fallout Guy"
---
I've been playing fallout for years now and still call him "Fallout Boy" until I correct myself, lol
---
dang
---
Up until March, to have this b***t of mode? And Perhaps more. Really? And a tag for learned plans? Only? Sad, sad and sad....
---
I think I just spooged a little.
---
Please say you're on xbox. (Crossing fingers)
---
I mean I mostly have 80-90 fps but these massive drops make the game stutter every few seconds and unplayable in some areas. 
---
Yes, we see this feedback about wanting to display items, and I totally get it! We're shared with the devs that this is something players want.
---
Well it sounds like it's coming out in the march so they have a month to fix all of that 
---
I couldnt agree more with this. This mode would be SO much better if everyone started from even ground again, especially if they intend to run with the leaderboard idea. This has the perfect makings for a "seasons" type model that could be ongoing with new leaderboards to keep things fresh and bring in new ideas over time. 
---
600 still isn't enough for me to keep what I believe to be a proper store of junk. Majority of players agree. It's impossible to keep anything for sentimental reasons. The limit has also forced me to have 15 strength and every weight reduction card possible, for how I want to play. I'm pretty sure if they could tack on another 400 that it would be just perfect. I could definitely be satisfied with that and never complain again. 
---
Why would they include patch notes for a patch that isn’t ready? They don’t know what all will be included. This is just a weekly state of the game update.
---
They updated it about 2 hours after they originally posted the thing about TS being nerfed and removed.  Updated to reflect TS and E getting nerfed but still available.
---
TSE +45%
---
Anti-Armor ignores 50% armor.  
---
Higher armor enemies I assume anti armor will work better.  TSE will still probably one shot everything.
---
My cap hoarding paid off.

---
You just summed up this entire game. Why is any of it the way it is?
---
Agreed. This is the only thing I care about at this point. I thought they were evaluating another increase. I spend way too much time in game dropping shit on the floor and sorting out my inventory. 
---
Ive been meaning to post about this, so annoying.
---
Its like they copied the "attack point" (ie, the ASAM turret) and pasted it into the "spawn point" attribute.
---
At least you dont have to go running around trying to find em stuck in the trenches, I guess.
---
5 paragraphs to say your getting pvp servers (with no real detail).....the last thing anyone wants!
---
Why are the normal servers not changed to PVE servers then when this mode launches? Tap damage to start pvp is just weak and needs to be gone completely.
---
Leaderboards? lol wtf? whats the point, whats it scoring or based on?
---
Should be new characters only as well unless of course your going to remove every single duped item in the game! 
---
Beta for pvp servers seems unnecessary, as essentially its exactly the same as what we already have!
---
Hot keys fixed and support for AZERTY  keyboards aren't something that should be the meat and bones of your weekly (and only) announcements for customers. Its like you want a pat on the back for something you should be doing already you get that right?
---
IS THE DUPING BEING FIXED ONCE AND FOR ALL AND WILL DUPED ITEMS BE REMOVED FROM THE GAME?
---
Simple question, cant get a direct answer though almost 3 months on. What are you trying to avoid saying or hiding?
---
Announcing PVE Servers might have saved you some grief, Do you really think people want to PVP in a fall out title? Most serious PVPERS will be long gone before you even get this out to us as the PVP in fallout isn't fun, the mechanics of the game don't allow it to be. Just the fact that you cant see that and have focused solely on it is worrying, it shows you are not listening to customers at all!
---
So essentially you are saying we have waited a month for a handful of basic bug fixes and some vague statement about a PVP mode that's coming soon(tm).
---
/slowclap Bethesda
---
Got them new stuffs on the Atom store though hey ;)
---
\#cashgrab
---
Find me when you do.
---
No more pen and paper tracking! Wohoo!
---
I understand that.  But the point is that the end game boss really shouldn't drop something as worthless as a syringer, drill, or flare gun.  Hell I'd take a Exterminators wooden left leg over a syringer.
---
Only PVP in adventure should be workshops and events. That’s it. If you want a pure PVP experience. You should go to Survival. It’s so annoying having your CAMP destroyed. Or just have some fuck kill you instantly.
---
Hmm, I unfortunately sold mine, will have to run that quest on an alt to find out.
---
Will get back to you tomorrow if no one else does.
---
It‘s a trap!
---
They should really just server wipe this game (then shut it down and put out a better one)
---
I have not bought any legendaries either. All mine come naturally. I haven't found a TSE but a few TS and one E shotgun.
---
I was pissed yesterday,  I finally got an instigating hunting rifle (1*) but it was level 40... :\
---
Yeah just what we want people running round with OP duplicated weapons from their adventure characters.
---
So it does show under Apparel, on the individual numbers on the diagram as well as on the bottom right?
---
Right now my concern is teams of dupers that will be fully outfitted in Sentinel/Assassin or Cavalier/Assassin gear, which makes them almost unkillable when standing still or sprinting... TSE doesn't even hurt you in this gear right now with a 'Dense' mod on your chest and proper perks, and they will do even less after they are nerfed. 
---
There's something oddly comforting reading about people who want a different tv show on their camp tv or a water purifier with a drinking fountain attached, while I just want to be able to walk for 10 minutes without a server dc.
---
Should be new characters only as well unless of course your going to remove every single duped item in the game!
---
Hot keys fixed and support for AZERTY keyboards aren't something that should be the meat and bones of your weekly (and only) announcements for customers. Its like you want a pat on the back for something you should be doing already you get that right?
---
I would do this...but, they lost me at being able to use current characters. I have not ebayed, duped, or exploited. I look it as being handicapped. Why would I want to be handicapped? They should require new level 1 characters in survival mode. This should be called “Duper vs Duper” mode. I bet these servers are empty and a waste of effort on Beth’s part. 
---
Terrible idea. 
---
Yeah that too. They could add another 50% to camp budget. 25% minimum. Would help me finish interior decorating. I'd also like a decorative junk budget. 
---
Is that your level though or simply because they’ve updated the game since you were 30? I might start a level 1 and build as plants as I can until it’s full then count them and check my level 120  to see
---
Personally I think that the remaining raiders will be the cowards and bullies who can’t make it in survival. You know, the ones that pick on players straight out of the vault or who like to pick on characters many levels below them. I’d like to see PvP disabled on adventure servers (for various reasons, but especially since survival doesn’t mean the creation of a new character) but that’s probably a controversial view... 
---
Everyone knows that the little green men that are the basic component of radiation can't survive heat.
---
Yep,,, and have you noticed the advertisement pictures have outfits like the ( still unreleased ) Silver Shroud Jacket being worn in the pictures... 
---
I think its a play of words with Thor's hammer, Mjolnir
---
Ha! I would like to have the ability to jury rig vehicles to work temporarily in the wasteland. Grab a motorcycle, fill the tank with bulked gas, and take it for a joyride. 
---
Have people pile into a barely functioning car, turn up the radio and drive the roads while navigating the road damage and barriers along the way. Road trip through Appalachia. \*country road!!!! take me hoooooome\*
---
I'd caveat that it's not a permanent vehicle that can be stored, popped out and placed from your inventory like power armor. There's enough static vehicles in the wasteland (doesn't take that many hits to explode) to make it feasible to roleplay a roving band of raiders on dirt bikes kicking up a plume of dust behind them.
---
I don't recall ever having trouble finding screws in FO4. Weren't part of the scrap rewards for some guns in that one? O see no good reason why they removed that.
---
Shhh don’t tell everyone...
---
It is actual content. Perhaps it's not content that *you* want, but that's a subjective issue.
---
If they are adding this mode, it's because they are receiving plenty of feedback about PvP.
---
What a waste. I bet more than half the time the turrets were just annoying whoever forgot to turn on pacifist too lol.
---
Use heavy weapons to cripple the queen and you'll never miss as long as your artillery is in range. Have everyone else use orbital strikes and fat man's. Then make sure everyone is looking away from the explosions. Very effective strategy as long as you don't over do it.
---
I would be happy with vending machines yeah.  About the stealing. Idk if i would be happy if a TS weapon would be stolen. And the person who stole it stashed it in his lootbox and left the server. All i want is the ability to sell stuff without actually  searching ppl to trade with. 
---
16 servers later and still nothing :(
---
I read somewhere that basically everything in the game has armor, even the zombies. It's very possible that anti armor will be Superior
---
Sorry, ps4! (Psn Carnage23666 for anyone wanting to come adventuring)
---
Quantum Bear is the type of hero we should all aspire to be
---
Some enemies should not be random anything. This is the queen we are talking about. This is just lazy.
---
Yup, I agree. I even heard that some dupers were getting unbanned WITHOUT player/item wipes. 
---
This is why we MUST demand a new character only barrier. This is a great opportunity for Bethesda to soft reset and start fresh.
---
As fans we must let them know this and stop a huge potential mistake.
---
add a gas mask.. and just say "are you my Mummy?"
---
Shows up, Op whips out his ionized meat. Radiation fluid everywhere. Then shows me his glowing mass.  Exactly as advertised.
---
Then something wrong. My friends and I always have the same vendor inventories and if I sell something to the vendor, other people can buy that item because it comes up in the vendors inventory. They definitely share.
---
Same result unfortunately, the load screen lasts a lot longer but i get disconnected anyway.
---
I just quit for today before i smash my controller on the wall lol
---
Exactly how the game was meant to be played.  Good job.  Have an upvote.
---
I’ll sell you mine for 5k caps clean suit plus clean helmet. And I can throw in for free the Alien blaster with rounds for it. 
---
I have yet to find the vendor since and it’s been over a month. I don’t server hop unless forced to by freezing games. But I try the Charleston station every so often, still nothing. 
---
I hate when someone has their camp there, nothing spawns when they set up a camp by the station. 
---
My own opinions:
---
* We should have a Fusion Core regenerator plan
---
 * I don't agree, I've used Power Armor constantly for the last 20/30 hours of play and I'm STILL carrying about 30 Fusion Cores with no sign I'm going to use them before I find more to replace them
---
* Graham is proof that this game would benefit from more NPCs.
---
 * Agree 100%
---
* Idk if this has been said already, but is there a reason purified water isn't treated as boiled water?
---
 * Agree
---
* Passive mode should make it to where other players can’t kill you, destroy your base, or interfere with your gameplay at all.
---
 * Disagree, it costs next to nothing to repair a base from my experiences. Couple that with the fact that every single PvP encounter I've had has been running into someone with a bounty or getting a bounty, you would just remove what little PvP there currently is. Once the PvP mode comes out it would most likely become a non-factor anyway.
---
* Legendary effects should be craftable
---
 * Disagree, what little "end game" we actually have is already farming legendaries over and over for the hope that you get a super good one. Removing that "grind" would just destroy the current playerbase as there would no longer be any "end game" what-so-ever. Though the ability to transfer a legendary (limited to same weapon model) would be interesting, maybe you can remove a legendary from a 1 star and use it to replace a bad legendary effect on a 2 star so you have 2 good effects.
---
* Can we get a roof piece to make bigger warehouses roofs more consistent?
---
 * Yes please.
---
* [Console] - Can we get the ability to store more than 50 photos?
---
 * not a console player, but I can see the frustration
---
* I’m quite tired of having to constantly have weight reduction perk cards taking up special points just to be able to manage my carry weight
---
 * Agreed, a high level perk card that lets you fast travel while encumbered for an increased cost would be a life saver.
---
* A machinist shop capturable workshop where you can take steel and convert it into a choice of gears, springs, or screws would be cool.
---
 * Why the scrap table doesn't let you craft specific components from basic components is beyond me.
---
I want PvP servers. I'd only play on the PvE servers though.
---
Thanks all!!
---
I'll look into bloody mess, tank killer and the CRIT boosts! 
---
When I go to put the hardened .308 on it's only 1 point more, so I'll probably stick with the refined .50 for the ammo crafting. 
---
Same with "Feed the People".  Bethesda prioritizes the bugs we like.  
---
They thinking of givin me and my crew a chance to fuck new players and players in general over.
---
I think that's a big 1% tbh but maybe well see 
---
(im in that 1%)
---
Agreed.  It's going to be filled with full assassins + sentinel players wielding TSEs. Good luck making a new character.....
---
I have made a daily-semi daily ritual of putting on Excavator armor and running Hornwright testing center #3. in the far south of Ash Heap. When you fast travel there you are on a path with a cliff face. Immediately walk up and hit an Iron ore, grabbing your 4-12 ore. Then walk back behind the red heavy equipment and hit the \~7 lead veins there. keep walking that way and go up the slope so you are now on top of the cliff and walk up to the edge, roughly 10 more iron veins. Then, if you are feeling fanciful, drop down to the landslide area above the house and turn back towards the cliff... there are 3-4 black titanium veins. 
---
With excavator armor on, you have an easy 50 ore each or more. There are no enemies that spawn here, save for maybe the rare chance of a scorch beast being close. 
---
Then, back to your chemistry bench with super-duper equipped and go to town. 300+ iron and lead in 15 minutes. 
---
I think that might just be a thing on Bethesda's side in terms of stability. I've heard of people with higher specs still having problems.
---
Yeah. No turrets for life! I think I'm getting downvoted here... man.. people really don't care about the wellbeing of this game. 
---
I suggest Greg's Mining Supplies. There's a trailer nearby that spawns food, plenty of junk inside the mining supplies itself, is fairly isolated so no chance of running into unfriendly stuff, it's a central location for most early game quests, animals spawn in the nearby forest so more easy food, and level 1-6 scorched spawn close by in small groups so thats keeos the xp bar ticking along. 
---
Okay! I'm excited to make a new character for survival mode. When do yall think it will start?
---
Nah allowing pvp in adventure gives us a chance to start large factions and create clans that are immersed in different facets of the game such as trade, mercenary, healer, etc... brings the small scale team into a larger stage.
---
I respectfully ask for your reasoning.
---
Same!  Also I have a stash of magazines just waiting for a display like in fo4.  When Mcready gave me his toy solider I put it in orode of place on my overseers desk :)
---
Don't worry pal, you'll find that green stuff one day. Never give up hope.
---
You're right. The way they describe survival mode, it just sounds like a big reward for the dupers and all their 'hard work', and as a result no one but those guys will ever use it.
---
Mandatory new characters would be one possible restriction, or they could make (all or legendary) weapons &amp; armor mode specific, meaning: your inventory of adventure mode w&amp;a doesn't load in survival (and vice versa), but everything else does, including perk cards. Bobbleheads only if the related exploit is fixed by then.
---
Dropping aid items upon death would keep me from playing survival. What about dropping weapons instead? Beth can play around with that: do you drop all weapons, all favorited weapons, or just the currently equipped one?
---
I bulk stuff constantly and i'm never at a loss for plastic. I just pick up tons of antifreeze containers, plastic dishes/silverware, dog dishes, pens. you name it. If you are a shotgunner you'll burn through it making ammo, but otherwise it shouldn't be a problem.
---
Keep in mind I've ran out of plastic several times for sure. I really just had to get in the habit of always picking it up.
---
Asking for slap damage to be removed is one thing, asking for separate PVE servers is another. Both i have seen asked for a lot. 
---
A new pvp server though nope haven't seen that requested myself unless someone was asking for them to b separate i.e PVE AND PVP servers.
---
I just hope the pve rewards in survival are also increased. I don't want to PvP just for the sake of PvP. (That's call of duty) I want to hunt the frafton monster for his epic weapon drop with the threat of a player sniping me while doing so. 
---
I mean the Guitar Sword kind of looks like an axe.
---
I had a thought, maybe Bethesda thought that providing a platform for the griefing, bullying, bobblehead stacking, oneshotters might make those of us who don’t do any of those things happier. Maybe they thought it would give average players some peace. The flaw in the plan is allowing players to use both modes with the same character, that’s where the fault lies. 
---
It seems this new mode is the opposite of what needs to be done to make players want to engage in pvp.
---
Losing your aids in addition to your junk will make players not want to lose their progress but I want to stay optimistic on how they implement it. 
---
You’re right 35 years of gaming on multiple platforms. I have no idea what I am talking about.
---
Yeah. I've played Fo76 on PS4 a bit, but I can't really tell if Supersampling mode is big FPS issue in most areas. Have you extensively used SS?
---
I think the only answer that comes to mind is the C.A.M.P. unit. You just feed it materials and it gives you the completed object.
---
Fallout Scavenger: Inventory Management, RNG edition.
---
Thank you very much for taking the time to provide a response!
---
There are a lot of players who want it, there are also a lot who would like PvP eliminated entirely. By giving aggressive PvP players a new place to go, it should be beneficial to both player types.
---
Honestly i love scavenging 😁
---
Need more like patrol duty. One for armor, one for mods etc.Just respawns if no one is there and make level appropriate. Would fix a lot of them right there.
---
So essentially treat it like placing crops, which makes it even easier because they already have things like that in the code. Since the material for crops is the item that the crop consists of.
---
This is easily solved by playing the normal mode until you have a character that's worthy of survival.
---
That this still hasn’t been addressed more than two months after release is astonishing. Should’ve been in the first patch.  
---
I honestly disagree. I've been building a character fair-and-square for weeks in anticipation of this mode, and if they forced me to make a brand new Level 1 for this mode I would simply not play it because I don't want to deal with that. This also creates huge challenges for things like the economy, where items have different value on trading forums based on game mode and all sorts of stuff. It's a much simpler and cleaner solution to let people play their characters on both, and it also encourages folks who primarily play adventure to maybe give survival a try.
---
For reference, lots of other games have kept characters between world PvP modes and PvE modes and had great success with it. It encourages cross-play, and really, the *last* thing Bethesda should do is try to segregate their community based on the game's early public reception. Additionally, they should absolutely deal with dupers and exploiters, but they can both deal with those folks and let people play their characters in both modes freely as they've already decided to do.
---
I stand by that their current decision is smart.
---
Yeah. it appears they have slightly fixed up bulking so the weight advantages are more-so now. I always bulked to sell excess, but I do it more diligently now. I burn through plastic pretty quick. 
---
At the absolute least they could bring back the feature of dropping the actual item and being able to actually pick it up and move it
---
Nice! Thank you!!
---
This is content, just because you don't like PVP doesn't mean others don't. Personally i could care less but it's something a lot of players asked for, the other content they already said is coming, just hold on a bit, this is a win.
---
That old chestnut
---
There is one like this but not this one.  The on on BotB is wall safes I think instead of standalone safes.  (I think)
---
The scanner I used has a set resolution and saves to pdfs and I had to convert them to a jpeg and trust me the pdfs are a hell of a lot better. Will try to get those put up later, will have to use dropbox or one cloud or whatever MS calls it.
---
Don't really mind resistance perks, just as long as it still leaves me enough perks to be able to do some dmg as well.
---
No they're not coming in Patch 5, they were teased as a feature being looked into but were never given even a tentative release date.
---
I get that urge every time I'm on the freeway
---
Are you still willing to do this? I'd greatly appreciate it, I'll try a bit of server hopping now but if u want to let me know my gt is 'tlgmuller' I just need to gather the materials
---
I know the feel I bought the giant mr.fuzzy and thought it'd be a camp item, I was mistaken, it was a massive Mr.Fuzzy cat with a bow tie, the in pipboy model was so large it was clipping against the top of the screen and I was hoping oh so much that it'd be a placable seat at camp
---
With the fact that you can only really get 3 fuzzy tokens a day and this thing costs like 15...it's very disapointing
---
I read somewhere that it did.  I never really looked at how much powder I was making, because it's pretty easy to make a lot.
---
I think allowing current characters on the new servers, glitched/exploited/duped or legit is a disappointing.

---
This is important. I agree. I am up voting any post like this to get it seen. No gear trading from one character to another and no main toon transfers. Agreed 100 %
---
The PvP server is a momentary diversion for tryhards, until they realize fighting each other is hardwork, and go back to griefing.  They'll revisit it later.
---
Well I guess two steps forward and one step back is still progress.
---
Really sad about the new survival mode though. I was really excited to start over without all the duped items in the game, but oh well. 
---
People have been asking for PvP and pve and survival only servers for a long while now. 
---
I'm all for a PvP mode, but.... that's it? Really? After all this time and vague hints towards new content, this is really all we've got? To say my interest is waning would be an understatement. Also I'm surprised that feedback is still being requested for events. That is a no-brainer, something that the existing feedback and analyzing data could easily answer. I've had a blast with this game and I'd love to continue doing so, but a PvP mode that should have been in at launch isn't going to cut it. I'm just continuing to be disappointed by these inside the vault updates, and my expectations are pretty damn low at this point.
---
Itll be a blood bath on survival servers, there will be bobble head 2 shot exploiters just camping near the 76 vault entrance waiting for people to spawn there after dying, just killing them again and again when they redrawn just to rack up kills on the leaderboard
---
There is none, the old servers aren't going to change into PVE only
---
That's even better!!! :)
---
People wanted them so its more challenging and actually better for them to not only have pve servers and an entire mode for that certainly is better IMO 
---
They need to elaborate on the PvP scaling they hint at in the article, but I agree they should require new characters.
---
I have no idea how they expect this to be enjoyable, with the current weapon balance, itemization and combat mechanics. Feels to me like they're chasing after PUBG/FortniteBR dollars, without understanding what it takes to run one of those, and what makes them so popular.

My main worry right now is that they are forking the development down two different modes, when the base game is still an absolute wreck. I'd be *totally* fine with them doing this a year or two down the road, when the main game and all of its mechanics are in good shape. But to fork the game now, in this state? Nightmare scenario, in my mind. Worst possible thing they could do at this stage, for a game in this state. 
---
look back to the threads on here and in the bethesda forums, from after the game was launched. I'd say that 3/4 of the threads (besides the obvious fixes), were about a hardcore PVP mode
---
In the 99% here ....
---
I mean...on one hand, this is literally something that in previous games a modder could hack out fairly quickly.
---
Which is what the majority of Fallout/Elder Scrolls players have grown accustom to, ridiculous mods that are in no way BGS lore friendly, but were still possible to obtain.
---
On the other, I don't see the problem with people making requests, despite all of the ultra sarcastic posts (like this one) I actually haven't seen very many highly upvoted requests for content that is entirely unreasonable.
---
This has always annoyed me a bit. I can cook tons of harvested meat/plants but I can't store them for any length of time and certainly can't eat them fast enough. Which leads to me thinking I have tons of food and then finding out I have none. I'd totally settle for 1/2 the food produced if it would last twice as long. Using the salt perk as well. The rate it normally rots at is ludicrous.
---
If the exploits are patched it makes no difference, unless they have enhanced snooping tools to flag cheaters.
---
Well... yeah. That would be yet another painfully obvious thing to do which Bethesda has yet to do to my knowledge.
---
I think it's pretty widely accepted that they are shite. You only ever find skeletons or feral ghouls in them.
---
Pretty sure were just gonna get a vending machine thing like you see at the train stations.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 
---
but seriously i ain't playing this game until i either can sell my items properly or have a stash increase. Did too much and now overencumbered at 1600 pounds 
---
Survival mode....dope! ...Carrying over characters from adventure...You fuckin dopes!
---
How can they launch this while knowingly allowing thousands of duped items into the economy.
---
So you will have level 1s running around with TSE shotguns from the get go. At least they may stand a chance against the army of dicks standing above the door of vault 76 sniping newcomers.
---
What a wasted opportunity. March is a while away though yet, so maybe they are cooking up a ban/item wipe we don't know about.  
---
Perhaps it's one part of a multi-part solution
---
nah players will still come and destroy bases because the pvp servers will be to hard core for them.
---
PVP'ers don't grief, griefers grief there's a big difference.
---
All of the trolls that wanted this to be another psychopath simulator like Rust or Day Z. "It's not hardcore enough, game has no identity," and so on.
---
Agreed. But i think they want to address the griefing problem first
---
/agree
---
I get about the same, @2150 or so, 3x3 Rifleman, Demo 4, Tank Killer 3.   
---
The damage displayed on the pip boy is your current damage (total, for all barrels and all bullets and explosions) with all perks and effects...   
---
The RANGE also seems to vary from gun to gun... (mine is 395), not sure if that is condition/over-repair dependent... 
---
Damnit...not again
---
If u protest enough  they might change their mind
---
Doesn't this defeat the purpose of a new mode?  A fresh start?  How is it in any way competitive if everyone brings their characters of varied levels and equipment?  Shouldn't it be based on how well you do in survival mode to determine whether or not you can compete?  It seems like a total waste.  If they had presented it as a late game mode that only level 100+ can join into, I could see the argument.  As it is, anyone who starts a new character is completely hopeless from day one.  What is the justification for that?
---
The things you learn reading about this game. Thanks for the rare info about another culture. 
---
If you're adventerous I trekked/jogged from flatwoods to the whitespring hotel at level 5 without dying. I thought I'd die at least couple times.
---
From the main entrance, up the stairs, hang a right. the soda shop will be past the ballroom and on your left. I just found it recently and have been hitting it up at the end of my sell run to buy nuka grapes (I'm up to two!) with loose junk I still have an excess of.
---
Because lots of legitimate, non-duping players might want to be able to switch between regular and survival mode, depending on if they're in the mood for questing or PVP. Someone might do some PVP, then get tired of it and want to get back to their quests without the constant fear of being ambushed.
---
There are other solutions already proposed to fix issues related to dupers wrecking the in-game economy and having overpowered weapons. Those solutions are a better alternative than barring legitimate players from playing the game the way they want to.
---
Yeah thats how they looked but you're the one supposed to sell the items. 
---
I agree. 
---
&gt; Even if they level locked servers so people with massive level differences can't play together, whenever a new survival character gets out of the kiddie pool, all the same assholes with TSE garbage will be waiting at the deep end and you will have zero competitive chance.
---
No they won't, they'll all be chameleon stealthed at Vault 76 waiting for shiny new chars to emerge.
---
Sorry cupcake. Thems the breaks. People cheated and it's the only way to weed them out.
---
The first step is accepting it.
---
I can picture people with chameleon/sneak builds, just camping and sniping.. just like call of duty lol
---
I certainly understand why you would want this but my pessimism prevents me from putting too much hope into it. Even if they were to make people reroll for the new mode it would likely be only a few days before some new dupe bug was found and then that mode would be tainted anyway. The cats outta the bag, the damage is done. Bethesda either can't, or won't do anything about the duped items.
---
Again, I am a bit sore but if this game continues on the path it has since beta I don't think the pvp "mode" will be anything like we expect or want. 
---
I myself will be staying as things currently stand.  Workshop PVP is what I focus on given how many people do not know the dangers of claiming one.  They could disable PVP altogether for Adventure, but I for one would immediately quit if that was the case until new substantial content came out.  Survival is not beneficial enough as stands for the effort involved.   
---
I'm excited they're adding a competitive aspect to the game, but I'm worried TSE are going to break the PvP. Especially combined with bobbleheads and Assassin armor and guns.
---
Hope we get some substantial content before Anthem/ Division 2 comes out. 
---
I love Fallout 76 but the end game is kinda weak. 
---
Hopefully, besides this new pvp mode, we get some more meaty news on when/what content is coming soon. 
---
Keep up the good work though Bethesda! Going in the right direction. 
---
I think it's fantastic.  It's giving you a choice.  Don't like PVP? Adventure.  Like PVP? Survival.  
---
I was blown away by the ITV, they are daring enough add in a complete new player mode.  Props to them.
---
Tremendous hands folks, absolutely huge hands. The biggest hands anyone has ever seen, really folks. Not a lot of people know that but it’s true, it’s true. Sad! Everyone knows my hands. Big hands. Great hands. 
---
You don't want that I've seen them in real life and trust me you don't want that.
---
Rolling in springs, screws, and gears here. I instantly collect anything that has either. 
---
If not disabled it should at least be scaled back on adventure servers
---
* Prevent griefers from damaging a camp unless they are actively engaged in PVP with the owner.
---
* Reduce slap damage to 0
---
* If you have pacifist enabled you should never be put in PVP except when defending a workshop.
---
* Maybe even a "confirm PVP" dialog like Borderlands.
---
I think moving in this direction would drive some of the remaining raiders to the survival servers.
---
What happened to the planned faction system? 
---
They said itll be the same as it is at the moment 
---
But lets shoot for the stars anyway!
---
Just because it MIGHT fail doesn't mean it shouldn't be tried. 
---
you guys are fucked hahahahaha
---
Your microeconomic hypotheticals do not warrant the kind of fix simply because your personal faith is shaken.  The kinds of people who will be engaging in the majority of trade will not have access to the kind of alt accounts to generate the cap reserves to truly tank the economy.
---
You said prices are out of what, you show hypotheticals and fear mongering instead of specific examples.  Because you're chicken littling is duping your personal doubt faster than anyone can ever dupe caps.
---
And yet there is a substantial amount of legitimate trade.  Which you will seem potentially suspicious simply because you don't know if you're being taken advantage of.  With anyone.  Ever.
---
So let's kill nuka colas for all so you can feel better.
---
Yeah dude, griefers were ruining the game, this is a good first step, as a PVE player, good riddance to annoying players and hopefully this will satisfy their hunger, I mean this is a the best possible way.
---
World separation was definitely needed, it will go a long way.
---
Level 1s can't use a TSE shotgun
---
Wear powerarmor or equip perk cards to improve dmg :)
---
Normally I'd agree but no matter how high they raise it, you'll fill it and still cry for more. 
---
This is a cost based decision. They literally have to put no effort into implementing these pvp servers. It will be another failure in this game
---
I would honestly just like a mount of some kind. Towards end game walking everywhere gets tiresome.
---
Since I use bandolier to help with my weight issues atm, I never really check my ammo since I don't pick up what I don't use. I always look for the big ticket items first like missiles and nukes never really look at much else...180 40mm Explosive rounds. I nearly shit myself, I never pick them up, I don't use that gun. Dumped those in the Watoga Station lunchbox with an assortment of other odd ammo. 
---
Welp, guess my camp is only going to be foundation, upper floors, and stairs if I’m ever gonna play this PvP mode.
---
Y’all can’t blow my shit up that way!! Ha!
---
Yep, going to upvote every one of these comments.  They really screwed up with what should have been an exciting new play mode. 
---
Eh, smart means a lot of things to different people I guess. I don't consider it smart to cheat. :-/
---
yup. those excavator pieces are like 49 screws per leg for top level. I didn't start that quest till level 40 or so. at 50 now and finally just finished the last piece.
---
Were not getting PVE servers though. Just a new PVP server, nothing to stop people staying on the current servers and continuing to "grief" as everyone puts it.
---
Not yet, they will stay as is for now, maybe over time but I hope you are right though
---
Hopefully the bobblehead stacking fix is in Patch 5
---
The survival mode explanation made me chuckle: ‘every encounter you have with a player could turn ugly!’ No, it *will* turn ugly, as literally everyone playing this mode will be looking for a fight. 
---
I’m sure some will welcome the new mode, but tbh sticking the PVPers on their own server feels like an appetiser rather than a main course. I’m also getting slightly worried that there are no concrete dates for vaults/more specific QOL additions by now. While I’m sure they’re working very hard, it still feels like the devs are wheel spinning. 
---
I was killed. Pacifist mode. at level 40. In six hits. This isn't a "story I heard" thing, this is a thing that has happened to me. 
---
I for one don't want to have to make a pvp only character with as low level possible to be competitive. You would literally have to run from monsters to not ruin your build. 
---
question - is the excavator armor the best for the power armor?
---
Yes, this. 
---
Get out the vault before you start if I wanted pvp I'd wait at vault 76 door and smash newbies that or camp white springs with a sniper you can't respawn for revenge so ez caps lol
---
I'm 95% sure I'd be comfortable for the rest of the game if they raised it to 1000. I hear what you're saying though. 
---
Again, it's easy to purge an entire account. 
---
Nothing new?  They are adding a whole new game mode in.  This is big and gives us more choice to choose how we play.  
---
I'm excited for consequences to dying.   Stakes will be raised!  
---
Granted, but it takes 100 unique TSE weapons to charge each time, and lasts as long as your dad does in bed. 
---
Worthy if survival? You mean unlimited stims and ammo from duping
---
I haven't tried PvP much in the current game. So, there is level scaling when a level 30 player engages in PvP with a level 200? 
---
hah...i think i've sold half a dozen of the later. 
---
I think they should.  PVP should now at least be scaled back on adventure servers.  How about 
---
I also have this bug (PC) as do all my friends.  Sometimes I can get it to show my progress if I log out/back in, but it never progresses while it's broken. I'd be happy with a replacement challenge for this week, while they try to figure out what's wrong with this one.
---
Then most played and realised that PVP in fallout is bad news?
---
If they change current servers to PVE only and new one to PVP id be on board, but as it stands personally i think its a waste of development time. Unless of course the PVP'ers are the majority and that would be surprising for Fallout imo.
---
Two line items for fixes and a "more to come"!  Gee than
---
And the god damn inter character loot swap locker. Its so frustrating tryin to swap a hammer that my sniper picked up to my melee build. Let me just drop it in a weight restricted box of course because thanks obama..i mean Bethesda.. and let me swap it over with out naggin my bff to hold this while i swap characters through 3 load sceens...
---
I'd prefer if they patched the game so it doesnt break ever few minutes
---
can you craft a bathtub and just drop them in?
---
1,000 would definitely be cool but there will always be people who want to hoard 50 combat shotguns for no reason lol
---
Xbox 1
---
Hey so I'm having issues with The Missing Link- follow Madigan's Trail. The quest tracker sends me to top of the world and no matter which floor I get off at it send's me back to the elevator.
---
I think the issue is because i completed signal strength and flavors of mayhem with a friend before I had gotten to this part of key to the past.
---
Let me know what I need to do to continue on this quest.
---
They went the cheapest route possible to implement pvp servers. This literally takes no thought or effort. They are simply removing slap damage and pacifist mode
---
Yay another repeat of a negative comment with zero value to my joke post.  .   .
---
Except Adventure mode still have PVP.
---
I think the answer to the OP question is that a lot of people are into this so it’s fair that Bethesda did this.
---
Yep. Both the weapon and armor ones should work correctly now. I've used it for all my built power armor and can attest it does not 1-hit degrade anymore.
---
It is if youre scaving, xo1 or ultracite are better to fight in imo.
---
Hahaha! They ruin it for the rest of us. 
---
Basically after level 50 it becomes the same, like a level 51 can kill a level 300 the same way that high level can kill the 50, what changes is just how good your weapons are with perks etc, but it balances it as well. Like I do very similar damage/ number of shots to a high level compared to a lower player
---
All I use is Blade of Bastet and a two shot handmade that I found on a random ass supermutant. Using what /you/ can find in the game is way more fun and immersive than just buying bullshit  
---
What's wrong with more choice?  The new mode won't affect you if you choose not play it and stick to adventure.
---
Far Cry New Dawn and Metro Exodus are both coming out Feb 15th ... the 1st content update at least better be around the same time.
---
I was actually going to post someone else had a really nice setup in New Gad. 
---
You already broke it down?
---
Maybe posting an [actual poll](https://www.poll-maker.com/poll2228081x216B417e-64) might help. Just an example.
---
Ill have you know I don't take all their stuff. I just leave anything I don't need. Like body parts. 
---
Pretty much this. If there arent more rewards in survival then they might as well make a battle royal mode stadium. Give people a reason to play the survival mode. Also dont punish kills with caps. Keep the "wanted" except for the caps part. Losing caps because we pvp in a pvp mode is stupid.
---
That and the Super Mutants' "Retreeeeeeaaat!" are my favorite Fo76 lines.
---
That's really one of the two major challenges for FO76.  It lacks the ability to mod as extensively as previous games.  It comes out of the gate with a huge crutch and needs to make up for it somehow.  They started something great with a bit if a world builder with FO4.  They transitioned to online which gave them a perfect platform to take it further.  Then they too a huge step back with tiny and non-persistent camps.  The ability to build is a tiny fraction of before.  They needed to go the opposite way.  Just open up the entire world, build anywhere and have it all persist from every player.  Each server is just a unique world, constantly getting reshaped by the people that play it.  That would actually be something.  Anyone can build.  Anyone can destroy.  Buildings attract creatures which helps simulate some level of fight against the wasteland.
---
The second part, that's the cut off NPCs.  Bethesda opens up an online, social environment, and then implements zero social tools.  There's no roleplay, no jobs, no barter system, and no creation tools.  Do you know how cool it would be to build an event of your own, creature and building setup, set up the event in an open area, and launch it live.  To can set up town attacks, treasure hunts, or so up a giant tower of doom for a raid.  
---
This kind of stuff could exist.  This kind of stuff would actually make the game feel very alive and interesting and would make good use of the social space.  Online play really hands value with customer development.  It's free too.  Bethesda only needs to develop the initial tools.
---
scrapping guns basically only gives steel and rubber. that's how I end up with tons of it.
---
I wanted pvp servers but not this version of lazy pvp servers
---
Right... you should have to play SURVIVAL MODE to be worthy of playing it.  You shouldn't be able to go farm shit in adventure mode and then just walk on over to the supposedly harder mode and use all of your resources there instead.  What is the point of increased difficulty or scarcity if you can just walk way and resupply in an easier mode?  I cannot fathom the logic here
---
Wrong ! It will affect everyone because they are focusing on the wrong mode.This is FALLOUT ,we don't want another fortnite, come on.
---
Ahh yeah much better... still fuzzy, but way better than the initial imgur link.
---
For me it's because the things attacking me haven't actually loaded into the game yet.
---
Yes disconnects not ctd, not that many times
---
I’d argue that instead of corn, get the soup that best fits your needs and make a bunch of it. If you are going to a Rad Zone, Razorgrain for disease resist. Concentrated Fire build? Gourd Soup (I think that one give Perception). If you’re already pretty highly specced in AP regen, food that boosts that can see diminishing returns, so avoid those foods.
---
To add, never leave your CAMP without at least 1 hour’s worth of Well Rested. CAMPs in the middle of the map save you caps on fast travel. 
---
Most importantly, at least for lore nerds like me, take your time and explore. Look at the way skeletons are posed, what is lying around them, and consider the context of the location. You may be reading an unwritten story, and some of these are funny, some are horrific, and some are tragic. Most are tragic. 
---
And a Pvp mode BETA at that. Strap yourself in while Bethesda reinvents the wheel, it's going to be a bumpy ride.
---
At the very least it could show the test card, that would be cool since there probably wouldn’t be any broadcasts 
---
I have noticed that they appear in the menu in the same spots, My EX is first, the T60 second, and the blank ones stack (2), etc.  Still a huge and pointless pain. 
---
On ps4? And I'll let you know after I try for myself a few times. 
---
If you find you can't do a lot of damage on SBQ, make sure to help out on the add waves that come up and keep them off the big gun guys.
---
Considering the ammount of food necessary to carry its probably better to have thru hiker. Ive tested this its also great to reduce stimpaks to 90%having both is just so massi ely beneficial
---
Fallout ain't Warhammer 40k
---
There’s a key you can get as part of a quest... works to open those doors during the event too :)
---
It's the best for carry weight, but the weakest as far as everything else. You need to scrounge for better gear and throw some points at whatever type of attacker you want to be. Find the perk cards that increase damage and accuracy and you see a difference instantly.
---
This needs to be done. Fresh start day 1 of SM:BETA Everyone comes out of the vault and instantly kills each other with pipe pistols and bare fists
---
Thanks! Im on PS4 though.
---
A known tag for plans/recipes is definitely a welcomed change but I do not agree with allowing existing characters in survival. This is your chance to reset the economy and you're still going to let all those dupers and exploiters to use their stuff in Survival? What a joke. I really hope some other content is coming, I know people were asking for dedicated PVP servers but I hate PVP and won't be using this feature. Looks like I'll be putting down the game for a few months to focus on KH3.
---
Nope, and this was supposed to be the "New Content" announcement. Not sure if Bethesda could be any further away from there own game at the moment myself.
---
Unless of course its the Bethesda staff that play that go round wrecking peoples bases and duping TSE one shot killers for there own fun!
---
Game is full. Good luck anyway!
---
It's not much of a survival mode if you can opt out of it at anytime. It should be survival only character or normal only characters like any other online game does when one mode is more hardcore than the other.
---
Hey buddy, your the one who made a post on the internet, its not exactly like your post is very original anyway. No need to to make fun of the people taking time to respond to your work, it makes you seem petty and that's why real comedians dont act like that. 
---
It is lazy implementation. They literally ate just turning off slap damage and pacifist mode. It is likely players will have unlimited Stims and Ammo. 
---
True, but semantics.  They can still bring their best duped lvl appropriate gear. 
---
Your opinion is correct based on arithmetic.  Excavator helps out greatly with carry weight, Xo1 and Ultracite have much higher raw resistance. 
---
I kinda feel like things are heading in that direction, maybe after an evaluation of how many of those ass holes are still terrorizing adventurers instead of utilizing the new play mode. 
---
Events I'll grant you. Workshops? Want mine just fucking server hop. 
---
The problem with this is that the power balance will be broken again in 2 weeks.
---
Duping is not gone, only slowing
---
Players will blast ahead to lvl 100 in more days.
---
You thought the Whitesprings Farming was bad now with the Camps full of missile turrets.
---
Nothing will change except there is no slap damage.
---
I won't step one foot into a pvp server without some progress on my character until duping is 100% resolved and Bobblehead stacking is ended.
---
I got a 1*mutant slayer ski sword yesterday 
---
Heh, yeah. I move my camp around like 2 times a week if not more. Pretty much all there is for me to do. Finished questing, gearing, lvling, min/maxing could do a bit more but I already 1 shot anything not a scorchbeast or queen.
---
Common duped tse's are receiving a huge nerf, and characters will carry over to pvp. Not sure what your getting at.
---
1 of their 10000 Stims they have in inventory
---
Does this new survival mode brings new quests as a Quest called
---
Player Death 
---
Just appeared on my screen is this a glitches where it's showing the quest early or a Bug ?
---
I have a two shot gatling gun I bought... from the Watoga vendor for like 500 caps. Somebody sold it off after a SBQ fight and I grabbed it. I think that is "buying fairly"
---
I hear you on the TSE shotgunners. Nothing is quite as "fun" as showing up to a nuked whitesprings or other blast zone and having a squad of TSE shotgunners in a race to see who can paste the most ghouls the fastest while not letting a single other thing register a hit. 
---
I was doing that last night. Got to the point I was just spray and praying into a mob hoping to land a hit or two because some chucklefucks were blasting everything before any of those other 3-4 people could join the fight. 
---
Adhesive is worth hoarding in my opinion. It's actually pretty easy to get compared to a lot of things, even without farming starch. Still sucks to run out of though. 
---
I've had plenty of times where I thought I was flush with some item or another and stopped picking it up, then ran 100% out of it a day or two later.
---
But this still has the same idea of "The problem won't be 100% fixed so why try at all" 
---
We should try everything we can to salvage this game from where it is. Yes duping is still a thing but it will be much easier to contain on a fresh server without the last few months of history behind it.
---
Where's the poll? At least set up a link to strawpoll or some shit.
---
I only say corn because it's easiest to find. 
---
Its a way of getting all those scammers and dupe weapon enablers to have a playground to go blow each other brains out and leave the rest of us in peace.
---
Free stims!
---
YAAAASSSS KWEEEN!!!
---
After level 50 its mainly the extra choices in perk cards and full sets off 3\* legendary gear (duped or not) and weapons that would give someone an edge.
---
A fresh level 50 may have a few perks out of place or one or two specials they want to move where as a Level 100 character will have all cards unlocked and can switch out whatever QoL / Aggressive builds they want. Base stats should be the same though.
---
Those twats give us raiders a bad name. Sometimes we just want caps instead of killing you. 
---
Who cares - most of us just want the pathetic PvPers gone from the normal servers.  PvP in this game will always be a joke - you can't have fair and balanced fights when its all about your build, equipment and other stuffs.  Someone will always have the advantage.  You can reset characters and it will end up being just as unbalanced after a while.
---
I'm here. Can't wait to kill all of you with my adventure stash.
---
tse is easy to negate. However duped assassin sentinel sets will defiantly be a issue.   
---
" You’re free to create new characters for Survival mode, and encouraged to do so, but you will totally getting your face smashed in. "
---
As a watoga noob i only know of the vertibird one. And its core is always gone lol
---
Did they just cut and paste fo4 AGAIN and call it content?
---
Still trying to get a suppressor for mine :(
---
Why? So there is artificial scarcity and people have to grind more? That benefits Bethesda but basically no one else. 
---
i get those too. I actually think it's your processor capping out. What helped me was i set FO76 CPU usage to HIGH Priority and it lessened those hiccups. I used to not be able to walk into morgantown, but now it's pretty manageable. 
---
I would only keep leather left legs on me
---
850 wouldn't hurt either; aniway il be offline for about 2 hours then back to business
---
I kinda just wanted PvP to be fixed. Like the systems all ironed out and perfected. 
---
They pretty annoying, get a super sledge and make sure you strength perks are good. What build are you playing ?
---
Alot of it is itemization, there are perk sets that render explosive weapons useless, pair that with the fact that you don't need to "engage" in PVP and I think certain weapons will far surpass TSE shotguns tbh
---
Sent request!
---
Yes definitely subjective. I dont agree, In my opinion its for monetary reasons involving the hype for PVP games like fortnite. I have no problem with it and it wont affect me but I honestly feel from reading the forums all day that people want actual content like quests. From what ive read not many care much for pvp. I don't feel like pvp should be taking priority. 
---
Shes dead a vault dweller with tse gun 1 shotted her
---
That's not scummy at all. Sorry, I don't have any advice, but I like your style. Good luck, op! 
---
They unchecked the slap damage box and called it listening to player feedback lol
---
They said we’d be getting a big patch. This isn’t a big patch. 
---
Never the less the point remains, anyone who goes through the process of getting a set like that will def be the type to want to be apart of that pointless (who has the most duped BiS gear) ladder.
---
2457432 serums and 76586 X01 Jetpack mods
---
Hey step back on that gear trading.  When I play with a friend we like to specialize crafting perks.  Also I'd like to run into player shops that trade gear.
---
I was honestly expecting that at the very least. 
---
oh man I am too dumb to know anything about “builds” in fallout like idk why i’ve been playing since new vegas but it seems like I switch it up halfway through 
---
How will it be easier to contain?  Give a logical reason.  It will be out of control inside the first week.
---
was gonna but its in read only mode for 6 hours or something for maintenance :/
---
 OK. Plant Corn, Mutfruit and Tato. Take that and mix with Purified Water and voila ... adhesive. ;)
---
You're welcome!
---
Absolutely. Clean slate, new characters only. Carrying over anything ruins the entire point of this mode.
---
He who bullies others lives a shamed life. 
---
Before people start clutching their pearls and squeaking. 
---
They seem to be going after the dupers. I’d hope that they ban a lot of these leading up to this. 
---
"waiting at the deep end" Lol, more like waiting in the shallows near vault 76.
---
This!
---
Quality over quantity!
---
Oh. He exploded. Like ew exploded
---
people have been working hard on their character to be ready for this server, not transferring=retroactively wasting all of their time. you dont need to put any effort into pve, you can just pick up a super sledge and x01 armor and beat the game  
---
this is the only way to get any use out of the builds people worked so hard on
---
I believe that the game doesn't recognize spoiled meat, fruit or vegetables as any type of "food" which is why you don't the 2X benefit or being free of disease. It is weightless because it has purpose but to make fertilizer. That last part was conjecture.
---
Hopefully just items of clothing, weapons or armor you havnt hearted, I'd be pissed if my favourite weapon or armor was dropped upon my death 
---
Nope.  But I'll go get more mats &amp; then build/scrap some more of them
---
Creating a new character isnt going to prevent anything. These people have stocked level 5 TSE weapons, level 5 armor. Wouldnt matter it would only delay them momentarily.
---
Also, TSE isnt the problem currently, its stacking bobbleheads and doing 35k damage a shot. So thanks to everyone for pushing for the nerf of TSE weapons which lead these people to find a new even worse way to grief.
---
Add me too!
---
If the you lose too much stuff when dieing and the quests/events dont have more rare/better rewards than in adventure mode then I see the griefers stay in adventure mode and keep griefing players. You need to give people a reason to play survival mode other than just pvp. If every legendary mob is dropping a 3 star then everyone will be flocking to survival and it will truly be like the age of pirates. Treasure hunting while trying to survive.
---
I just laugh as they realize its defended by rocket turrets and a deathclaw. 
---
I think it's going to depend upon how much armor they have.  If they dont have a lot (ghouls) popping them may be easy with a TSE, and you'll get less peak out of an Anti armor... TSE improves the base damage, anti armor just lets you ignore some of their armor.
---
Guess I'm the only one that sells 20-100 screws and springs daily. XD
---
Surely you wouldn't get many caps/junk from such a new character tho, but yeah I could see people doing this.
---
I tried for years to get one in Fo4, thinking they never dropped. Then a month ago, I get 2 with a 1.5 week period. 
---
can i use that?
---
I also agree.  
---
I can imagine so many duped TSE weapons + duped bobbleheads out there with no PvP restrictions means it will be a griefers paradise.
---
If you drop weapons, that would suck dick
---
&gt; if the wanted level doesn't go above a certain threshold, it should gradually decrease back down to zero.
---
I could be wrong, but I think it does. Granted, a 10 cap bounty, I think, is usually an accidental stray shot (unless the bounty increases), and I think it takes way too long to go back down to zero. Your first idea about the red radius around the player I think is a great idea though.
---
We shall call it a 2%.
---
Dupers galore
---
In fallout 4 yes, in 76 I've never had to make adhesive and I still bulk it to sell. To reason to take the time/resources to make it in my experience. 
---
Yeah... but surely there's body bits left? Don't need much for kebabs. 
---
 LOL. Don't play it then. ;)
---
Yeah. Like red sacks of arm and leg. Well, was.
---
500 bobble heads 
---
You can sure as hell bet im going ot twink any character that goes into survival with stuff i get off adventure mode. 
---
Doesn't mean people can't just be doing it wrong and still playing legit.
---
THIS. The ONLY hope I had to get back into this game after all the dupes being dumped into the economy was that maybe we'd get a separate game mode, and the PVP aspect on top was very appealing. Fighting for survival as you level up in 76 sounded very fun. This is not what I wanted.
---
Yep, appears so.
---
On top of the high school, on top of the civic center, and if you have Bird Bones and a jet pack you can hop to the one on top of that building east of the monorail. 
---
Nah. They would've used them all already
---
I believe you only get one chance a day with a single pie machine. 
---
Letting characters cross back and fourth from survival is just fucking stupid, make everyone restart so the survival economy has a chance and griefing will be minimized in the first 2 weeks 
---
You and OP are right, that is a brilliant idea. But how do you find other bases? They aren't listed on the map, right?
---
Starting from a sever with zero mule accounts, zero dupped out characters and zero exploit leveled characters would allow Bethesda to better handle the accounts that then use these methods as they won't have the backlog behind it.
---
Is it perfect, no. Nor have I ever claimed it too be. However it is something to at least try rather than just shrugging while doing nothing.
---
That's ok, you can't go too wrong I think, what level are you and what cards do you currently have .. ? Maybe sent a screen of your perk cards at the moment. I would focus on strength if you haven't already, get things like slugger, two handed strength cards and 1 handed to help you when you stuck .. mine is pretty mixed as well, but do just fine.  I think I Have 14 points in strength .. mole miners can be overwhelming without the right gear ..
---
Hey hey hey. Dont loop us all in with the lower scum. Some of us, like the Ritualists have standards. 
---
I'm getting at the fact that almost everyone is using duped weapons.  If they really wanted Survival Mode to be a success then they would make everyone start a new character to play it.  
---
Now, it's just going to be the exact same duped market, and everyone will already have their perfectly curated weapon/armor sets in place.  It's just a bummer, dude. 
---
Good to see Early Warnings is getting fixed, but will it be possible for players already affected by the Upgraded Motors bug to go back and complete the quest?
---
Also, HELL YEAH for "known" tag! Thank you for this! :D
---
Can't agree more what are they thinking 
---
3 months so far and its still BETA, prob be 4 months by the time we get it as well!
---
You need way more springs than screws, especially if you want to build max level.
---
Ah, so your saying it's gonna take little while...and it's not a quick process?
---
you can access your stash box from a chair. I have a desk with a tool box stash. my character sits at the desk and sorts. which is fine but I want to sit down and listen to holotapes and catch up on notes I've found
---
In the beginning i was loaded down with screws and springs, now INEEDF'GSPRINGS. Screws I still have plenty but i can't collect enough clipboards to get springs. Nuka Cola for Nuka Grenades too - I have a ton of cherry and quantum but reg. nuka is hard to find.
---
Yup. In FO4 where it’s available. In 76 it’s a one level perk that increases the amount of common scrap. 
---
This was my first thought when I read it. Definitely should be new characters only, by March even the most reluctant alt creators will be happy to for the experience. This would also ensure not having to rely on the scaling so much to allow for a level playing field. I can see getting stalked by level 200s while trying to get a few levels being less than fun.
---
Oh yeah, I didn't think about that. I can see how you'd burn through screws like crazy!
---
I can see it now... "players discover bug that bypasses all of those restrictions" ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I feel you on that one.
---
However if it was outside, people would kite enemies to it.  So your poor level 15 player who figured out how to sneak past the ghouls...........now has a level 90 deathclaw somebody kited over......eating him while he's in a terminal browsing things :)
---
That can't happen inside.  Worst case scenario is somebody shoots a robot, but then all the robots chase the one person that shot them and ignore other players.....lol
---
.. just fix my (silent) Slay Bells, and I will roll with everything else.  :)
---
That said, this update looks exciting.  Folks that genuinely want to PvP will have their playground.  The people that grief using the excuse of "I'm just trying to PvP!" will have less of a leg to stand on now.
---
I believe with the new PvP servers, the current goofy slap mechanics are good now for the adventure folks (such as myself).  They just need to fix the balancing a bit - make the slap damage a set number -vs- a percentage of the damage you can deal normally. 
---
Agreed, that is genius. I wish I knew how to build a decent base, and I would follow suit! My base looks like the outside of a trailer at a trailer park, it's so bad.
---
It’s to let you know it’s ready to continue when you are ready. 
---
That's why I said with Zero contact between servers. Let them have their backlog of level 5 items in Adventure Mode. But don't allow adventure mode and survival mode characters to interact at all.
---
Make em level 1. 
---
Don't have access to alt accounts? A person who takes advantage of the 5 built in characters can hold 125,000 caps. With 2 accounts that's 250,000. And that amount of caps can be regenerated with laughable effort compared to someone who acquires that amount via fair means. 
---
Why are my prices out of whack? More out of whack than an economy saturated with fake currency? Two Shot explosives were selling for 25000 caps when they first started appearing. Now they sell for 200.  And If anything I low-balled 50000 on a 5 star legendary, but it is impossible to actually gauge a price when people can print money. 
---
No trade is legitimate in a market where the currency can be manipulated vastly more than it can be controlled. The real world equivalent is that every other citizen has a money printer in their living room and the government has no power to go after counterfeiters. Of course we're talking about digital goods in fallout so that's where the real-world analogy fails, but for those of us that want an honest experience in-game, I feel it is still an apt analogy.
---
If the money isn't backed by power, and it's supply isn't controlled, then you have a failed currency. And what we have now is a black market through-and-through. 
---
Even when they are considerate and let you tag, it still is not very fun. Someone letting you play...
---
Yup Far Cry will be awesome.   FO76 will be shelved for me for a bit when that comes out. 
---
Preesent.
---
I would be OK with this.
---
3) Actually explore and find the places that don’t get mentioned on Reddit but actually still have their screws springs and gears. FTFY. 
---
I assume they mean between your own characters on the same account
---
DITTO! They are my favorite gun by far.
---
I'm not too sure about people being able to use the same character on both servers, i kind of understand why they would do that though as if they say people have to start a new character on it there may be a considerable number of people who just stop playing for the next 2 months and wait for it to be released. 
---
Lasers are red, 
---
And it's funny that you ask, 
---
Because my gatling laser's durability,
---
Makes me think it's made of glass.
---
100% agree! New characters only or this is going to be terrible because of the dupers and exploiters. TBH I probably won't use it because I don't like PVP but if I do, I want new characters only.
---
Sorry, speaking from a min / max perspective.
---
If you're a min / max player, anything sub-optimal gets your OCD in a bind.
---
Also for traders........level 40 gear goes for very few caps.  So it's not even worth picking up and selling it.  I do however donate any good 40 pieces I find to noobies (I try to find a level 35-50 that could use a boost).
---
Me too, however there have been no reports of them removing the duped items.
---
Apropos username
---
It is broken before starting. There are too many duped items. Developer room gear. Unlimited stims and ammo. Unlimited buff aids. 
---
You can tweak perks with duped gear to make killing someone almost impossible. 
---
It is a joke
---
There's a named one daisycutter 90% weight reduction so I think it weighs 6 pounds? as quest reward (Ella Ames bunker?). It scales based on your level at completion so I'm on the questline now as I recently hit 50 the other night. MIRV mod splits the mini nuke into multiples so using it too close = suicide.
---
For the most part I don't craft mini nukes, I carry them till I get to my base with the intent of using them on enemies I can see off in the far distance from the roof of my camp as a "get off my lawn" deterrent. It's handy to have if some dude griefs you by destorying your camp and goes back to his camp to recoup.
---
The level 50 bunker buster targetting missile launcher serves the same purpose. There's a reliable stash of missiles found on that one roof in harper's ferry that hardly anyone picks up. I have thought about ranking up bear arms to swap out against pack rat to reduce the 40 pound weapon to something more reasonable.
---
Did I miss an announcement? The game already functions in survival mode compared to the previous games with food/thirst/disease/bullet weight. What more could they do since saving is irrelevant?
---
 You need 4 Charisma for the best deals outside of chugging chems.
---
It's not the BIG new content announcement, we could already infer that they were talking about PvP coming first from the last couple of Vault articles
---
Maybe I'm in the minority, but I believe the lack of end-game content is much more important than a PVP only mode. I expected things like increased stash space, CAMP budget, more and better events, more nukable areas etc. etc. to come before anything like this.
---
I also think the fact that you can take your level 250 with TSE and 50k bobbleheads straight to the new PVP mode is a mistake. 
---
Eh, not clutching my pearls.  Just was hoping for a fresh start where everyone wasn't using exploding weapons (myself included). 
---
There's not one person without duped gear and evil intentions that doesn't agree with this thread, right here. This is their chance to even out the playing field, with all the exploits fixed - without anyone legitimately complaining.
---
Come on, Bethesda.
---
&gt; Survival mode will be an absolute shit show unless 
---
... they decide to NOT let existing characters join.
---
No.
---
I am not shrugging and say do nothing.  I am saying starting from zero only delays the inevitable repeat of history of the other servers. Without the simple fix of disallowing stacking of bobbleheads, and fixing the duping exploits for good, fresh start servers will not have the effect you hope.
---
There is a post we are trying to get spread talking about this very thing!
---
So spawn at your camp ?
---
I feel they should've made everyone make new characters 
---
Yes fix it good is unbugged as per one of the previous patches.
---
Then don't play the new game mode.  Just select adventure when you start fallout 76.  At the end of the day the free market dictates a games success, if PvP mode becomes more popular then you can see what the majority actually want.  However you will not forced upon it, there is another mode that will not interfere with your play style.  
---
Higher player base = more revenue.  More revenue = more resources put back into improving the game.  Who doesn't want better server optimisation and more content?
---
That and they're harder to find - take it from me.  XD
---
Thank you Kanye, very cool!
---
Sure duped gear, unlimited stims, unlimited ammo, unlimited buff aids. It sounds like a great idea.
---
The old servers will be the same though. 
---
Griefers wont go to the pvp servers they will stay where they are. They don't like fair fights they prefer to grief people and destroy bases and annoying pve'ers don't they?
---
I prefer adventure mode tbh. Alot of us dont leave the Mine, preferring to spend our time trading or praising Cthulu. However if someone wanders in or near the mine, we gang up and kill them, or force conscript them into the gang *cough* cult. 
---
Agree.
---
There's always one nay-sayer, just being the Devil's Advocate. The vast, vast majority of players would agree with you Issac.
---
New toons can still get the duped stuff now.   
---
If they are banning duper’s and deleting their accounts, hopefully it’s before they can unload much of their stuff. 
---
So there goes their duped items.
---
Or the level one would just use a pipe pistol with a million stacked bobbleheads to insta kill you.
---
 Why the people who will not play this mode hate it is beyond me. Some kind of epenne thing I guess.
---
Not my thing really, I'm just a lone wanderer traveling WV. 
---
I can already see the "P2W lootbox crazies" foaming at the mouth &amp; posting about lunch boxes are loot boxes for survival mode.
---
I'd love it if a Ferrari cost $10 bucks but that's not realistic.  In the end, it's just greedy to demand everything immediately, at the lowest possible cost to you. That's not how the world works; why would you expect a game company to be any different than any other profit-making entity?
---
Seriously, i know it hasn't been out that long but i thought they would start to address the lack of end game content in game by now in some way, when are they going to open up those vaults? And how hard is it to add another enemy besides ghouls to nukezones? maybe another raid beside SBQ, they have so many options.
---
Oh yeah, I can definitely still do this. People send me messages all the time lol. Just send me one on Xbox when u have all the materials. It also requires some asbestos, aluminum, and adhesive. Not sure of the exact amounts.
---
Um this happened to me last night!  No kidding the first server I got to, cross the red bridge, head back, and out of the sky comes vendor bot!  A fricken level 8 comes out of the train station and executes him and his eye bot.  I couldn't believe it.  Server hopped about a dozen more times and only got protectrons and that obnoxious eye bot that plays classical music with a bunch of rats chasing it.
---
I actually agree with you.  Honestly, if folks want the adventure of leveling up a new character on survival - sounds awesome and actually extremely immersive.  
---
If folks want to bring over their OP adventure characters and start blasting people.. well.. that's the wasteland.  Those folks will get bored quickly, and the people starting new characters will just have to outsmart them.  There's no "slap" mechanic in Survival Mode, so there is no reason that somebody lower-leveled couldn't get the drop on an overconfident TSE-wielding dude in X-01.
---
How many New Players do you think will opt for Survival Mode over Adventure Mode?
---
How is the new mode going to directly affect you? It won't.  You still have the game you continue to play right now.
---
We encourage you to make new characters, but then we will throw you to the horde of level 200+ characters that can instantly kill you. Sounds about right...
---
Why not? 
---
It's funny because it's true.
---
Valid points, they need to sticky this so it can hopefully be seen.  Everyone can pick it apart and provide suggestions.
---
Yeah they pretty much advertised spawn camping the vault with that little sentence.
---
I was quick to pick that would happen with my recent post
---
Thanks. And I don't mind the discussion pro or con. I think (if anything) it betters the chance for this VERY important topic to get noticed.
---
I didn't downvote you, don't be a baby.
---
This might be the issue I’ve been running into A LOT as of late on the Xbox. Wasn’t exactly sure what it was other than my game locking up and only the map would respond to inputs. Only way for me to fix it is joining a new server.
---
Only allow new characters in Survival please. 
---
I like pancakes. 
---
Sounds great. I cant wait to see how well I do against dupers with developer room gear and almost unlimited supply of stims, ammo, and buff aids. 
---
Just call them Juicer Dupers. They will be able to stack buff aids, perks, duped gear, and unlimited items in such a way that they are unkillable.
---
Sounds fun
---
You said it. Damn right. Another mis fire on their part. Maybe if we make enough noise they will change that decision. 
---
fallout 4 and DLC awaits friend. 76 is a pvp game bruh.
---
I think your exaggerating about almost everyone using duped weapon. I’m not. Not my friends. We never buy items. We play with what we get in game.
---
Sounds like you don't actually want to play Survival mode then. So stick in carebear mode if you "thought grief in was bad now." 
---
Yeah I was confused by that. Seems that It is random what mod you unlock, and for what body part. In other words it doesnt matter what you are scrapping, it could unlock any mod for any bodypart. Scrapping arms is the cheapest material wise.
---
I'm open to hearing any suggestions you have as well. 
---
It should be with how crappy the game runs
---
I'm definitely down for pancakes with a side of 400 more stash space. Maybe some eggs too. 
---
Cheers man I'll look up whats needed to craft it and I'll get it all together, I've dropped u a message on xbox as well:) 
---
Rule #1 is don't fragment the player base.
---
yes. i've only gotten from distant thunder. althought they are the rarer drops from that event.
---
\*Thru Hiker
---
Not so much trying to be a grammar nazi (ah, who am I kidding) as trying to make sure he's looking for the right thing.
---
I want pvp servers, but only if they required a new character to be made and its locked into it. For their current direction, I doubt I'll touch it.
---
Totally agree! That and get rid of PVP in adventure mode or at least make so pacifist mode works properly.
---
 Absolutely. Clean slate, new characters only. Carrying over anything ruins the entire point of this mode. Also, only teammates should show up on the main map. Anyone else should be hidden and their "dots" only displayed on your compass when in range. It would help stop fast travel camping cheese and provide a huge element of surprise. Perception would see a huge benefit from this.
---
I would like a game on par with the previous instalments that works
---
Awesome, just got back from work. Let me know when u have everything! 😁
---
+1 absolutely it should be separate characters from adventure mode.
---
This is the best opportunity to do a "v2.0 launch" for F76 without the integrity issues of the early (and current) exploits and bugs. 
---
PLEASE RECONSIDER AND MAKE THIS COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM ADVENTURE MODE!  
---
I don't know they have player scaling in PVP in ESO and it seems to work really well. 
---
OMG i love your voice
---
Wow in my 200 hours of gameplay i have never seen the plan for it 
---
Talking about broadcasts I just thought that it's weird that they don't exist in the Fallout universe. I mean it's probably gonna be a nightmare to code and look pretty bad because of engine limitations but when you think about it analog television transmitters could still be around like radio ones (especially the ToW, there must've been TV transmitters in there) and I'd expect people to have claimed them and be broadcasting. Definitely a cool thing if it somehow makes it's way in a future game.
---
You act like its not going to be pure chaos either way lol. 
---
And I want a balance pass through gear before we get a pvp server. What fun is having only a handful of viable weapons and armor pieces?
---
That's Thru Hiker, available at level 7.
---
Juicer Dupers:
---
Players that previously duped gear, aids, ammo, and stims. Stacked aids with perks and they are almost unlillable. They have thousands of Fury, Psycho, Stims spread around mules to duck under the radar of bans. Beth cannot even fox duping.
---
Lets make ladder pvp....
---
I kinda just want 16 times the rendering capability of fallout 4
---
I know it not the greatest res, but it does work and I hope it helps
---
Is there a through wall conduit? 
---
Most people who bought the game? Survival is the PVP system as advertised.
---
Finally i see someone saying this.I got heavily downvoted when i asked for anerf to assassin sentinel, but they have no clue....
---
I haven't waited for Reddit to find my own farming zone, and I think I've explored most of the map.
---
Came here looking for this comment.  We need larger stash sizes.
---
What platform?
---
By name only it seems, but yes :-)
---
Sorry. PS4
---
I'm not criticizing it. I'm answering the question of who wanted it.
---
Not at all, I had to open it to look for myself.  All this time I've read it as Tru lol
---
&gt; Have you ever heard of spawn camping? Outside the vault 76 doors will be a constant bloodbath. 
---
Yeah, god forbid that ever happen in a PvP mode.
---
A few probably, however that's another question isn't it....fo76 and new players? how does it attract any "new" players.
---
But yeah i think a few would choose the new servers but it depends on how well survival mode is made and if it is actually a survival mode and not just the same without slap damage to start PVP.
---
Then it would also depend on how many people get 1 shotted constantly coming out of V76, if there's no content for high level builds then noob's are going to get farmed heavily!
---
Not sure why they've mentioned scaling as how can they make players scale with each other.....Bethesda really don't have much of a clue when it comes to there own games :(
---
And I have 3 pieces of t60 plans from distant thunder event
---
Yeah you are probably right. But I think if over time, controls will be put in place on the PVE servers, I am really hopefully they want. But you right, griefers are soft target pussies and nothing more, they want to feel OP but attacking someone who doesn't want to be attacked.
---
With the non existent balance and  horrible netcode, its already sounds like a joke. 
---
Bethesda you need to go full Robocop on all the dupers and bobblehead stackers or survival mode is going to be a dumpster fire. This has disaster written all over it if you don't stop all the exploits. 
---
Agree 1000%  
---
Level the playing field or don't bother.
---
Was banned a week ago. Got this email today.
---
[https://imgur.com/qh7LQHd](https://imgur.com/qh7LQHd)
---
I expect the PvP to be a huge disaster. Really hoped for more PvE content but I guess that is not the plan.
---
I'm thinking they are saying they are going to allow players to move characters over because if they said that you'd have to create a new one there may be alot of players that just stop playing for 2 months and wait for the PVP area. And then at the last minute will say you will have to create a new character.
---
&gt; And much more! 
---
Stealth Nerf  incoming, wonder how long its going to take to find it.
---
 Survival mode, broken right out of the box.  
---
[Shame shame](https://giphy.com/gifs/Ob7p7lDT99cd2/html5)
---
Ah sorry I'm Xbox.  
---
I'll have to try that later thanks for the info
---
Just consider unlimited stims, ammo, and aids. How does that work on pvp servers. Not to mention developer room gear. They put no effort into this.
---
It should be: Blind maps, No legendaries, New Level 1 characters, Max aid inventory of 100, No cross character transfers. 
---
Some lasers can be green, 
---
And they hit a lot harder. 
---
Use an ultracite laser gat,
---
And it'll get you a lot farther. 
---
But seriously if you like to use laser gats and want like 3 fully modded ultracite ones and your on pc, i know how to craft them and have roughly all the mods unlocked. 
---
Oh I see. That sucks. 
---
I feel like all they learned was it does not matter and it will get better with time and you'll still give them your money 5 years down the line either way.  XD at least that's what I'm getting from this story lol
---
I'm all for fixing the duping and removing the ill gotten gains from it.
---
I haven't collected any because I wanted to spare them and myself of this fate
---
Never mind. I’ll hang for a 5 or 10 I’m sure some will get involved. 
---
Yeah, guilty as charged.  I just have seen a large influx of the number of people using explosive weapons and I have never found one at level 100, so I'm an ass assuming shit. 
---
They should be addressing instability issues.
---
You would rather lose aid than your weapons? This seems a little strange to me since I am the complete opposite
---
Do you use the "Tag for Search" feature?
---
I probably sell 30-40 each a day to vendors just to get rid of my excess over 100. I do tend to pick up every bit of junk I see though.
---
You just give the duped items to the new toons,  inventories are sharers between both servers.
---
I love the idea of people dropping aid items though. Also if they make it so only new characters can join the server I would play this new mode almost exclusively. It just needs tweaks
---
Well then, just like everything else... learn to adapt. 
---
I can do 850. :) What’s your IGN? 
---
They... have...
---
It makes me feel like I'm trying to find out where they moved the damned bread aisle.
---
Got mine today as well. Posted it in another thread. Good luck with yours. 
---
Because they have been promising they would.
---
Grumbles quietly. No stash or camp budget increases. 
---
That dog was waiting for Fry.

 INSIDE THE VAULT - JANUARY 24

[https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/1PnLPLl6a8D6gPNWvSVA0Q/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-24-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/1PnLPLl6a8D6gPNWvSVA0Q/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-24-2019)
---
OP should have included this.
---
I'm into the idea of Survival mode, but can't say I'm a fan of Leaderboards being incorporated into it. I think it'll take away from experiencing the world and turn it into a headhunting competition. Gives too much incentive for people to grief and solely focus on constantly killing others.
---
And when the patch is ready they will...
---
I don't think I have any plans myself, but I just farmed existing pieces in the world.
---
 Absolutely. Clean slate, new characters only. Carrying over anything ruins the entire point of this mode. Also, only teammates should show up on the main map. Anyone else should be hidden and their "dots" only displayed on your compass when in range. It would help stop fast travel camping cheese and provide a huge element of surprise. Perception would see a huge benefit from this. 
---
Yeah I am amazed they are pouring resources into a new mode when the base game still needs dramatic attention.  Either the new mode is just a layer to the base one and so will import all the same issues, or it's a diverging game experience that will siphon off dev attention and resources from that point forward.
---
Then why tell people it will be given in advance? It's idiotic.
---
Whilst I appreciate the QoL changes I can't deny that I'm disappointed that the first content update is not raids or vaults but PvP. Might step away from the game for a year or two and see if when I come back there's any new PvE content or if it's fully become Fallout: Battle Royale.
---
I also dislike that Survival allows using existing characters. The whole losing more caps and potentially aid items? Well then people will just trade them away to alts or friends on normal servers before joining. I think Survival would work a lot better with a Diablo-eqsue season system, perhaps with the added incentive of faster leveling or unique PvP-oriented items like Destiny 2 offers for ranked mode.
---
I want to keep playing this game but with several hundred levels in characters I've run out of interesting things to do and a copy paste of normal servers with always enabled PvP with the possible reward of some caps or aid supplies is not enticing.
---
Will heavy/energy weapon balance be looked at soon? They are pretty bad right now.
---
Wow.  So Ultracite PA is not really needed?  
---
100%. 
---
Adventure and survival need to be completely separate.
---
Agree 100%.
---
To destroy for mods. and beginners. You were there at one point.
---
Disagree.
---
I want to keep the broken record of "I will pay Bethesda for more stash space" going in light of these posts. 
---
Imagine if your character has a little badge or something that says they are level 0 hardcore created. Like a badge of honor for levelling all the way on the server. Maybe like the little diseased icon next to some mobs names.
---
They’ve mentioned several things to come on this next patch already. They haven’t given a full list because they don’t know the full list. It is that simple.
---
Woooaaaah bet. Any news on the release date?
---
or, now hear me out, don't.
---
Well griefers will be everywhere.  I just seen alot of post from different ppl complaining about how the pvp system is trash and that they want private servers.  Bethesda is providing those but now they complain by the fact that they will allow to bring your existing characters into survival mode... Conclusion, it will be a dupers VS dupers TSE gun bloodbath with griefers hiding at vault 76 waiting till lvl 1 characters pop out..  I do understand why they complain.. If bethesda wont change it. Survival mode is ruined before being launched... 
---
or maybe just maybe, let them
---
Then don't promise that you'll tell us in advance.
---
It is that simple.
---
that would not surprise me.  There are application support sites I can't get to without applying for an exemption to the security policy as it is.
---
Yep but they respawn pretty quick. I'm camped next to mclintock and I see people looting it and I go up there after I get done cooking and refilling my gear and it's full of stuff already. When I loot it though it takes about 12 hours to respawn it seems. I grab the ballistic weave and springs from there daily.
---
This is one if the fastest games to level in...
---
Just like whenever there is a new D2 ladder, gold sellers make a killing.  You think there will be less TSE weapons in survival if they start fresh?  No. There will just be more money sent to China gold farmers.  
---
I'll pay $20 for 400 more space. 
---
They are telling you in advance...
---
I disagree, I think you should ONLY be allowed to make a new character. Or sort people into servers with all new characters or all existing characters. What doesn't work is mixing the two, which they plan on doing.
---
They haven't said, but the next patch is next week.
---
I'd prefer having to start over and no legendary armor or weapons, or stacking buffs. Now that would be a fun game. 
---
Just need a little nuclear material, and the asbestos and fluxes. I doubt I'll have it all today but theres no rush, tysm bro haha
---
I shouldn't have to but if that was the option, I'd take it. 
---
IMHO no not really.
---
Can't tell if you're being intentionally thick, or you're just slow.
---
no way they just cut n paste fo4 for the third time and called it the first major dlc!
---
How often are you running into other players were you get yo observe their play? 
---
Sure if there’s a Whitesprings blast zone, or maybe Cranberry Bog. You’ll probably see people like this. But I don’t spend much time.
---
I think duper’s are bad. But they have never had an impact on my direct game. 
---
I ask for your reasoning. You know, to hear you out.
---
I think that's the test of just how much people are jonesing for a new mode.
---
It'll give them a chance to totally retcon themselves, and they'll power level.  Not for everyone, sure, but I think this is what they crave.  No-holds-barred.
---
Yep. It's exactly like playing regular mode.....except that if someone wants to fuck with you they will have more options and rewards for doing so. Did they think all the griefers will conveniently separate themselves from the rest of the player base?
---
Who asked for this anyways? It doesn't sound like a good time and the game is still an unstable mess, still being exploited.
---
Yeah I've spent a lot of time there lately trying to catch up on screws without needing to move my camp. Also the only time someone has actually taken a workshop from me. (though weirdly, I respawned, came back, and they asked me to be on team with them, and then left the server so I kind of got the workshop back?)
---
We don't want exploiters on the non-survival servers either though.
---
Think I'm just gonna start a new character, carry only salt, and just keep bothering the people that kill me.  Wished it displayed the characters name instead of the account name - I would name him "pointless"
---
from the sounds of it, PvP is still automatically leveled and starts on lvl5.
---
Sorry if that seemed personal, but I meant it more globally. I re-explored anywhere likely to have screw bearing junk, then looked for which ones were best.
---
The trick is that the places work because they have more dangerous enemies and/or are less convenient because they’re not near a vendor. 
---
You’re actually upset about them doing exactly what you’re wanting.
---
So "Survival Mode" is just the same exact game but PVP is always on and you get a few more caps and maybe some aid that no one needs. That's really not exciting at all.
---
What about all those exploiters running around with all their thousands of TSE weapons,  stimpacks and radaway, etc? I rather restart a new character then run around with a bunch of exploiters or high level griefers that will kill me the moment I leave the vault so they can take my stuff I worked hard on getting in adventure.
---
I used to use it as a storage container in my survival play through when I was too lazy to walk all the way up the hill into my house
---
Lol no. You literally don't know what you're arguing
---
From someone who went out of their way to make a user name like Fallout76ispainfull but I'm butt hurt. Lol. Dude, your asking for a mod in an mmo that will make it easier for you to manage your resources because your to lazy to find steel. Let me ask you this. What other mmo makes it so when you run out of something....rather then going out and finding more. They just give it to you. Would you prefer to simply be gifted it just so you don't tempt yourself with scrapping something more valuable. If you scrap your mods because your strapped for steel. Your playing the game wrong. How about you actually play the game and hunt for materials that you desire.  Don't get mad that Bethesda did not let you mod the game that way. 
---
Where? It isn't in the past 2 weekly updates
---
Appreciated! Yeah, allowing existing characters into survival will be the dumbest shit ever for new players. What a horrible idea. 
---
I am tired about hearing about the canvas bag.  
---
Can you put the floor/roof back after?
---
No. They would be paper bags.
---
Either way, they should only let you be in a server with other people who are starting over on a new survival character.
---
You know what fans of Fallout want?
---
More Fallout, not pvp.
---
Well in the post they mention possibly losing aid items and such.  So a well planned attack could see them lose all that 😂
---
I just think there should be some incentive to craft equipment at level 50, and it would be cool if when you inspect it, it says who made it.
---
Noobs not knowing how to put things on display. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/aa654m/finally_got_around_to_filling_up_the_shelves_in/
---
It goes great with the gunpowder they use, and the caps they always spend.
---
100% agree. I'd try it out if we have to make a new character but definitely not going to if I have to face level 200-400 players the moment I leave the vault.
---
Hmmm.... wrings hands and plans for tonight.....
---
This is why in my original post is says to not allow characters to communicate between servers.
---
No connection between adventure and survival. Period.
---
I am always solo.  I am at the point now where armor and weapons aren't desired.   Well, for selling them to vendors yes.  On a different topic, i have 16 mutations and boy are they fun!
---
I just got this in the northern part of the Mire (along the main road) from a 3\* Scorched  @ 500 hours:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/F1NvrNo](https://imgur.com/a/F1NvrNo)
---
My last explosive was a Tesla Rifle @ 300 hours from near the Tunder Mountan NPP.
---
This lever action is awesome, like 2.5x more damage from the explosive effect doubled by Demolition Expert 5. I haven't even hardened it yet...
---
Are you assuming new people won't be buying/starting the game a year from now? In theory a live service game always has new players joining in. A year from now they'd on a new server with other new players, or new characters.
---
Syringer and drills 
---
New play mode is cool but when is Bethesda going to fix the stash weight limit? 600lbs is not enough. I am having to sell grenades, drugs and other weapons and armor just to make weight. I found a nearly complete set of T-51b armor and I couldn’t even store it because of the weight limit.
---
This is just further proof that Bethesda doesn't have a single clue about multiplayer game design. They should just give up on it at this point and stop doing damage to their own name and reputation.
---
Unless they're able to lock down those exploits beforehand?
---
I want more NPCs, but how does he prove anything?  He's loved because he has interesting things he says and rare items, but you can't interact with him other than trade, which is no different than any other robot vendor.  What we need are interactive NPCs with decision trees and consequences to decisions we make.
---
Remove the floor or roof. Not the wall. The spikey end goes toward whatever is being wired. The nodes attach to other conduit/pipe pieces.
---
I predict empty survival servers and a river of tears here. 
---
This new spawn camp mode sounds fantastic.
---
I mean, how does this have any upvotes?  I've yet to see anyone on this Reddit even want to PvP lol.  Y'all aint gonna be on there.  As far as I'm concerned, this should be the only game mode and it should have been there since launch.  So why should I start over while you get to keep playing in carebare land?  Goooooo mind your own businessssssssss
---
I like the white trim on it and it kept with the color scheme of the rest of the place
---
Its a odd desicision to make a whole entire new gamemode without patching glitches and bugs 
---
Yeah I think that is the next step after they get the new PvP mode off the ground. Make PvP less rewarding in Adventure mode.
---
Seconded.  If people want to destroy other players and their camps - then make it only possible in survival and put EVERYBODY on pacifist on adventure.  Only snag would be workshops.
---
 Yup. It'll be tough, which is the point for me. I'll roll a new one just for the jollies. ;)
---
The spike part goes through the wall. The curved ends face into the room you're placing it from. The vertical pipe should be flush with the wall on your side.
---
Can you wait about 4 hours :)
---
you know what would fix most of the dupers/cheaters for survival mode?  
---
stim healing and drugs are on timer and no TSE 
---
They announced a dedicated PVP mode weeks ago
---
haha reading that takes me back to me UO days!
---
Can remember them bringing out the new "safe" servers and it was the first time in any MMO ive seen huge amounts of players leave over night.
---
SWG and the NGE was worse but that took quite a few years to match that early UO drama, WOW ad EQ2 have had its moments since and a lot of the smaller titles have done it as well.
---
Thing is Bethesda, do you have enough customers left playing to divide the community again and carry on ignoring the real issues (dupes and lack of end game team content). Personally i don't think so :)
---
Lord British has got a new MMO coming out soon i think btw OP (hopefully better than Tabula Rasa lol) :)
---
It's going downhill from here on. Probably new exploits will be invented to keep up with the leaderboard. This whole idea is a joke if you ask me.
---
Not me, don't have room for that at my Nuka B&amp;B. I nope right out of the server.
---
"Why not ruin 2 servers just because one is already fucked"
---
Absolutely fix the exploits and remove the ill-gotten gains.
---
My preference 
---
There aren't enough screws. Every time I go to places that have a lot of them to loot, they've been looted already and I have to log off and log back on several times frequently. 
---
Putting points in a scrapper should let you get screws, Springs, nuclear material, ultrasite whatever if you Max it out, from the things to scrap.
---
In a perfect world its all free and all that stuff, but if they want a way to make money to keep paying for stuff this is the best suggestion i know people will want also
---
What happened to factioned pvp? This survival mode sounds like a misguided battle royal.
---
Occasionally? The same as the normal amount ive felt like in all my travels. It does suck a little since that is an end game location which is leveled between 30-99, so the enemies that attack my base have scaled to that. I ended up loading into the area before my turrets and killing everything before my turrets which is why I went down to just 1 turret. Hot key that power armor just in case!
---
I second this, i have 20.00 waiting for another 400 space too
---
This. The round disc part behind the spikey should rest against one side of the wall.
---
Bad idea. Most people wont re-level a new char just for the pvp mode. If they require you to level a new char again this pvp mode  will die. Players dont wanna do all the quest again, instead they will stay in adventure mode and grief there instead.  People worked hard to level up in adventure and now its all useless in survival. Nah 
---
Oops. Typo in the title. I mean "now that we have pvp mode". I'll repost in 10 minutes.
---
My my. Really going all out to give the enclave a bad name eh?
---
Absolutely, and i hate that that was so exciting to see. I thought to myself, now i can safely start buying plans i don't have without trying to remember what i have. 
---
What a small thing to be excited about. Why arent we opening vaults yet? Why isn't there another place to nuke for a new boss...or anything to actually add to the game? It's just something else being fixed, that should have been there from the beginning.
---
&gt;they may drop their Aid or other items
---
Goddamn, Bethesda, what other items? Other items besides junk and aid are: weapon, armor, misc, holo, ammo and mods (did I forget something?). Am I gonna drop a jetpack or my main weapon or a random holotape? 
---
What's your tag? 
---
Praise the Lord! And pass the ammunition!
---
Glad you can see the future and tell what will happen with a feature planned for beta release in March....
---
I'd rather has Skittles.
---
ya digging the sales but I thought it was the base price to be honest. Could be mistaken tho ....
---
To me the issue feels like it's too easy to farm legendary items, and that in turn bloats the game with excess legendary drops that make any non-legendary moot half the time. Duping only makes the issue exponentially worse as a duper could easily just sell, dump, trade, or give away dupes and half the time people don't realize it (it's not like there's a tag on the item). It also doesn't help that people just love to grind for "that perfect item" and seem to forget that the game itself needs to be experienced. It's easy to not have fun when you spend all your time killing mobs at only a handful of locations just to get the perfect weapon that will let you...kill more mobs even faster/with little effort.
---
"We will create the game based on player feed back"
---
Players: "1000s of bugs and game runs horribly"
---
"Here is a new server with a leaderboard"
---
&gt; A year from now they'd on a new server with other new players, or new characters.
---
Exactly. This would cause chaos on the servers. This wouldn't be able to function.
---
That would be great and all but I highly doubt that they will get them all before March. I know they've been working on banning them but there's people willing to buy TSE weapons on Ebay and other websites from these exploiters. The economy is screwed up and personally would rather see everyone on a clean slate.
---
From mining the game file, there used to be another 6 nuke silos; would it have been better or worse to have 3x the possible nukes?
---
Errrrr 2:57 :256 2:55 
---
Its gonna not really work out cause anyone that goes to those servers will be kitted for those servers with gear from the adventure mode servers. 
---
It is going to be PvP, you're not changing their mind
---
You sure you don’t mean: Awwww, scrap!
---
  I think its great. I am puzzled by those who will not play it hating on it though.
---
good deal, makes sense, thanks!
---
Agreed what isn't being said is far louder to me in this update than what is, and I don't like it at all. We are far enough along that we should be getting more than this but the silence is deafening.
---
lol every fallout fan would freak tf out
---
Just checked, have a spare 
---
And I thought my hopes of an animal companion where beyond reasonable.
---
THANK GOD we dont block reddit. Everything else is blocked so, honestly, i'm pretty surprised. 
---
Didnt read terminate
---
When was it down to 1400? I didn't even know it went down that low. Although I'm on Xbox I don't think the atom stores have different prices. I've only ever seen it at 1800.
---
Excavator with shocks.
---
 I can't walk around with my collection if I dont have that on
---
if nothing else it should siphon off PvP players so you can enjoy PvE with less hassles.
---
You have melee players selling springs, screws, and ammo there all day every day for caps :)
---
Normal price is 3 caps per spring or screw..............or 4 rounds of ammo for 1 cap (prices may be higher or lower depending on the trader).
---
If you need caps, sell stuff there, people are ready to buy from you right now!
---
Weird, I thought excavator topped out at 45. I'm consistently short on springs but I basically re-craft all my guns whenever I can bump the level, and between that and the mods they go quickly. 
---
Used in other stuff too. I finally got the fusion generator plans but can't build one because I'm like 2 screws short lol. I'd CAMP on junk piles just for the screws, but I have a higher need for lead and steel so I bounce between those.
---
Or an increase in the cap limit for vendors.
---
If I could sell more stuff, I wouldn't need to dump the stuff I can't store.
---
  What events do you guys like? ( we all answer ) Great here's free for all pvp, now you can lose things to exploiters instead of flawed in-game mechanics, Your welcome! ( our collective "..." ) 
---
I'm level 219 or so. So if iget killed in Survival, I'll lose 438 caps?! (+Stimpakcs,etc..). Why would I want to play that? 
---
Hurray! NOW GIVE US DIS HUMAN NPCS
---
Nah, I say let them. Just ramp up the penalty for losing the fight. Your entire inventory is now lootable. 
---
Ok, I'll give you 1k for free just for the lolz, are you playing on PS4? 
---
where’s my stash increase!?! Goddamnit fuck.
---
They mentioned they needed to evaluate how it affected server stability when they increased it, but then the dupers went wild and kept fucking up the servers, so it was probably difficult to evaluate how the stash increase affected things. I imagine that once they have good data, then they'll let us know one way or another.
---
I think they should display a replay of your characters last death on loop. Just so you can really sit back and absorb what went wrong last time.
---
The irony is a lot of those cap stashes have been removed from the game.
---
"Dont need to put effort into pve" "worked so hard on" ... hwhut?
---
The problem is less about the innate level, and more about the gear options that those more 'established' characters have
---
im convinced the new mode is just bait to expose dupers and exploiters.
---
You clearly don’t understand what I’m saying. The game AUTOMATICALLY scraps your mods WITHOUT your consent. The next patch will address that. Nobody in their right mind would scrap an X-01 jetpack mod but the game will happily do it if you run out of the materials the mod is made from. I never intentionally scrapped a mod but the game has happily scrapped a T-60 Calibrated shock I spent all day finding simply because I needed steel to repair a gun and the mod contained it. It’s also why when you store all junk mods automatically place into your stash. There are no mods that I’m interested in that do anything aside from change the UI as even the mod that prevents scrapping isn’t one I’ve installed due to the fact they’re addressing it. You’re the one that acts like doing any of this is going to get someone banned. From what I’ve seen it doesn’t. And what I’ve experienced it doesn’t. In fact you seem to forget what the post is. This post was to ask people what Bethesda’s official reported stance is
---
I mean, you got a car in fallout 2
---
If you think that new players would only opt into Survival Mode if it's well-made then what's the problem?
---
But it doesn’t have to be rendered which is what causes server problems. It doesn’t matter if it’s just an imaginary item floating in the unrendered stash void. 
---
There comes a point where you have too many of both.  Lol   
---
Just got DCd. Piss!
---
Whitesprings is a much harder area than you'd think given how early you can find it on the map. Especially if you don't play melee. Those ghouls are vicious, and there are just so many of them. 
---
Most people disagree with you and that obviously includes me. Do you use a .50 cal as your main weapon? No, not unless you're some sort of farming masochist, but it does pretty unparalleled dps in the heavy weapons space. No the gatling gun does not come close in dps. So if you've got a good .50 cal, it's the best DPS heavy weapon you can have, end of story. So in the end it's worth using on shit like SBQ and Mirelurk queen if you don't have a TSE gatling gun or something like that. I have a vampiric .50cal and I use it if I'm getting wailed on.
---
Haikus are easy
---
But sometimes they don’t make sense
---
Refrigerator
---
Oldie but goodie
---
Yes I can, something wrong with that? Don't get the downvotes from people honestly, can't even voice an opinion now?
---
Yeah it's really a bummer that they did.
---
Sir_cakington
---
Ok so these survivors cobble together weapons, recycle power armor.  Cobble together high tech laser turrets and security systems.  But not one God damned  person has the time or ability to fix a vehicle (which utterly litter most of the wasteland) I've always questioned this.  Personally in that position I would be working to get at least a motorcycle to work to cover more ground faster to gather resources.  Or maybe a death claw saddle hrmm.
---
My changes for survival mode should be only new characters allowed from the get go. No transfering over a character. Second would be a map blackout so nobody is seen on the map. Otherwise youll just have people fast traveling to locations people are, killing them and then moving to the next location. If you want it to be hardcore, make them work for finding other players. 
---
Change I would want to see for adventure mode would be passive mode being full on and not letting others destroy your stuff or kill you. You would still be able to have pvp in adventure mode if you want but if passive if active, it removes you from that so you can play the game and not worry about other clowns wrecking your camp and just need to worry about environmental damage. 
---
Do you actually use all that stuff or is it just for fun?
---
I agree with you OP.  I think most people are using duped weapons.  Unless themselves or their group looted it , most likely duped.
---
You only need the external 'wall mount' type conduits actually as they put out a 'powered' field type deal that applies power automagically to things in a fairly sizeable area around where they are placed
---
Be it for feedback or monetary reasons, as you say, it will have an audience. Which means that there will be people that want to play it. Same thing. I don't care if they receive a benefit in the process, honestly; I already paid for my copy of the game - whatever they add now, I see as an extra.
---
There's a whole team working on Fallout 76. You don't know the priorities said team has.
---
Definitely. And like, apparently there are vendors like the one near Charleston train station that don't spawn every time? WTF is that about? Just spawn em, people won't need to abuse the servers then.
---
In the latest edition of "Inside the Vault" they said all other players on the server would be considered "hostile" so I doubt you'd be able to fast travel if you were nearby another player.
---
There were horses in FNV's graphic novel
---
I approve this comment. 
---
One right here
---
If you can't use existing characters then it will only be a week max before there are strong characters in Survival mode doing what you described. That's a really poor payoff for prevent people from carrying their characters over. 
---
Some weapon and damage adjustments are required in this game since clearly it's too easy to kill people. I'm sure Bethesda will get around to it. Especially before the release of. PvP mode.
---
I have a copy of that same map. I intended to build down on Cranberry Bog and connect to the power substation. I went over to check it out and a level 80 death claw walked around the corner. I wasn’t wearing PA at the time so I just ran but it didn’t help. He chased be down and bitch slapped me dead in three hits! Needless to say I picked a much quieter spot to strike camp. 
---
I’m in the same boat no explosive weapon drops level 90 getting repetitive drops in weapons n armor so I just stared a second character to try my luck. There was a post yesterday about sampling the drop rates in the game n how higher luck apparently has a negative factor to dropping high end gear. Which is something I can personal believe given the shear multitude of 3* creatures I’ve killed only to receive the same 1* items over n over. Three 3* pieces of gear have dropped for me since starting the game an hour after the initial launch.  
---
About time!
---
Oh, I'm sure you are SO easy to kill with your 900+ damage sniper rifle that you can pick people off with a mile away and not even touch you. Sorry, but workshops are one of the few reliable ways to get plans for anything, especially with the high level vendors having bugged loot tables, and all your doing is destroying someone else's caps, resources, and time while they are waiting for the *PvE* events of defending their workshops which is where the plans come from. And guess what, it's because of assholes like you that dupers have an economy to work with, because it's a lot better to just buy duped plans than to wait around for some asshole to come along and ruin their efforts. There's no two ways about it, YOU ARE A GRIEFER. You are harassing people who not taking part in PvP. That's what a griefer is, that's what you're doing.
---
i have my daubts, considering combat for instance has both dense and padded, while padded is reduce dense is greatly reduce. i would love if it was correct but i don't think it is, i can confirm plans for dense combat/metal/raider/robot and trapper not sure about raider but other ones i got at random from train stations
---
I think next time I’ll bring a spare!
---
i understand where you're coming from but i think this is the way it should be.. in every game where you can craft god-tier weapons (think Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning or Skyrim) that's one of the top things people complain about; they're like why bother having these epic and legendary drops when you can just craft things that are so much better?
---
And i have to say i agree, it feels so much more satisfying to get a random but very good drop from a chest or a boss/enemy loot than it does to just grind out some materials and be guaranteed to craft a weapon better than anything you can find (It was especially bad in Amalur, where the materials were so readily available you didn't even need to grind, you could almost just freely craft weapons halfway into the game better than anything you would ever find)
---
It's a wasteland filled with its our dream to rebuild the waste to what America was before it, and cleanse the wasteland of its filth 
---
Bet the people that ordered that version are as well....shame they still don't have them yet though really :/
---
Well nvm beth replied anyways.   
---
But I want the improvements that you've made
---
I totally agree. Characters and equipment from adventure mode should not make their way into survival mode.  
---
Maybe even go one step further. Have an extra survival mode which wipes weekly, like when the nuke codes reset and at the very end. That would be very cool and at the end of the week everyone who had created a character during that week sees how they fared on a high score list.  
---
If they ever allow private modded servers, this is what I'd set up.
---
It is a separate game mode
---
Yeah the fubny part is everyobe cried about TSE non stop to where it got nerfed, this bo one gives a shit about.
---
?
---
No. I like the light PvP elements in a predominantly pve gamemode, i don't want to lose that and be forced either into full pve or hardcore pvp.
---
Go ask for a seperate game mode.
---
Darn, not a fan of low HP builds.
---
Apathy, arrogance, or incompetence. Pick your poison.
---
I guess you haven't been to Valley Galleria yet...
---
&gt;First new content is PVP servers.
---
&gt;No new content
---
I'm getting mixed messages here. 
---
But seriously, they have added new content. Just not to the actual base game...Looking at you, Atom Shop. Also I feel they've made it clear these initial patches would be mostly bugfixing. Which they have been. This just seems to me like an attempt to "fix" the issue of players wanting a proper PVP Fallout experience (Which is fine for them if they wanna do that I guess, it's a big no thanks for me). 
---
Though I do agree that the whole letting players "carry over characters" is absolutely moronic and unbalanced. 
---
I agree duping is the number 1 biggest issue to be addressed. If the duping continues it will be game over for fallout76 sadly 😥. The damage already caused is serious enough but it is not to late to recover.
---
This is the best chance we'll get at a "v2.0 launch" until private servers are a thing.
---
The integrity of the current adventure mode characters is too far gone from bugs, exploits, and general changes done. If they resolve these issues before launching Survival, myself and everyone I know would come back more excited to play on fresh characters than when the game first launched! 
---
I'd like workshops that purely co-op PvE, actually.
---
Exactly!  Also, I love my TSE Handmade.  Sad they're gonn nerf it, but understand.  Would much rather they fix the damn game than sissify my favorite gun.  Oh well.  
---
grinded over 100 hours to have perfect roll armor that nobody else has. people accuse me of duping but you cant find my exact pieces on any trade group since they dropped for me or people in my team who werent looking for it.
---
Single player game with no back end options for Bethesda.
---
Seen a thread once, some guy lost the quest item so couldn't progress main story. Bethesda GM (support) told him to make a new character as they had no way of taking or giving items from his account.
---
Its on this sub somewhere unless it was deleted.
---
Because they were coded that way while AGL was simply coded as your average heavy weapon instead of explosive. The quick easy fix was to change it away from heavy weapon so that the perks no longer applied. Again, they've been alerted to this fact since the day the patch launched. It's just not a priority.
---
The ammosmith perk will help with that or at least give you more bang for your buck
---
Nuka-Cherry is hot keyed for me, it’s my oh shit button (aka the + key on PC). 
---
They restore practically full health (I’m a cola nut too), a fair amount of thirst (helpful after many stimpaks and psycho— which is also hot keyed) and the game doesn’t seem as picky about when you can drink them as compared to when you can stim yourself. 
---
I would be ok with fast travel removal. Hopefully the new servers bring out some of the best in players instead of just the worst.
---
A bolt action rifle will likely have two screws holding the stock to the rest of the gun.  Ditto a lever gun.  Pistols typically have a minimum of one screw holding the grips to the frame, some having as many as two *per* grip held to the frame.  Any gun that has a scope will have at least one screw holding the scope mount to the gun and at least one screw per scope ring.  There aren’t many adjustable sights that aren’t attached to the gun with screws, and even ones mounted via dovetail are still held together by screws—because, go figure, *adjustable* sights.  About the only gun I can think of that has a shortage of screws is the AR15/AR10/M4/M16/WhateverBlackrifle, and even then, the gas return pressure is adjusted with a screw.
---
Now, obviously, you’re not going to be able to pull the take-down screw from a Marlin 39 and use it to hold the stock of an AK, but there’s at least *some* universality to scavenging screws from a firearm.
---
My point here is that it’s not unreasonable to expect a useable screw or two from scrapping a gun, even if they’re mostly pins and springs.
---
You keep doing you and get as much hyperbole and fear mongering as you can into the blender so you can drink your daily dose of chicken little smoothies.
---
You don't even have stats to back up your claims.  Just anecdotal conjecture.
---
Ahhh. So by filth you mean anything weaker than yourself? 
---
This is because the IT guys read reddit and keep it open for their own entertainment :)
---
That projection. I'm not attacking you, and I don't wish any ill upon you. Good luck, sir.
---
I know [it was bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pck7i7hshc), but ESO has roughly [1,900 quests](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Category:Online-Quests) and [19,000 named NPC's](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Category:Online-NPCs). Half are probably DLC, but there's bound to be quality issues with that kind of quantity. Having something so vast is what keeps us engaged for thousands of hours. There's not just one group boss to fight but hundreds.
---
How does 76 they catch up with something like that? 100 hours in and you're running out of things to do. I wanted to fill the time until the next ESO chapter comes but Elsweyr is still months away.
---
Funny though, in 76 beer bottles are needed for molotovs so it doesn't eat them. I think it will still use them for glass if you need it, but they don't auto-scrap to the base material.
---
Now if only they could do that for bleached dogwood and all the other stuff that should not auto-scrap.
---
I just wanna sell plans. 
---
That's a long wait ): I really enjoyed these brotherhood quests, they were pretty interesting. I suppose I should wait though, most of the guns I find at the locations are about level 40-50 anyways.
---
I had a teddy bear mascot head I’d wear on my power armor in FO4
---
it's not new content. just a new mode. literally nothing new about it. they're just letting players have an unrestricted play mode. though the carry over bit is hella dumb.
---
Hmmm this is a good answer actually.
---
Especially in a world of god like GECKs and vending machines that create anything out of matter (looking at you Sierra Madre).
---
The plans get fed into the machine and it does all the work just leaving us to put stuff together like LEGO.
---
Works for me (for now).
---
That said though why hasn’t the entire country been rebuilt in over 200 years since the bombs fell with such technology....did the denizens of vault 76 decide to just keep nuking each other after defeating the scorched?  Or did a new threat rise?
---
Something has to have happened to wipe them all out after all or maybe vault tec built in a kill switch on the CAMPs.
---
Did the old wire through wall trick, looks better anyway, but thanks for the tips :-)
---
The upside to downside just seems off.  Spawning far away sucks, and I don’t need more aid items, I’m already selling or throwing them away.  Any real rewards would be too easy to exploit by boosters working together.  Ie tons of xp for killing players or unique legendary drops added to their loot bag. 
---
So it’s going to be zero sum and there’s nothing I want from other players.
---
They’d have to build a real system beyond a leaderboard.  I think back to WoW battlegrounds and you had a separate pvp rank that you leveled by killing players and completing pvp objectives.
---
Agreed. This should be treated like soft-/hardcore characters in Diablo III (and, probably, numerous other games I don't play). There is a 0% chance I will ever set virtual foot in Survival Mode if it's as willy-nilly as they have proposed even though it sounds like it could be fun.
---
Yeah, not to mention the end of that quest will be hard for a character at that level.
---
Matriarch would have baby death claws to throw at you like the crazy cat lady off the simpsons
---
I don't think any bounties would really work well. An attacker would be at a big disadvantage when fighting someone else at their camp/workshop, since shots that miss will now likely hit a structure and put a bounty on them. If everyone else is marked hostile, camp turrets would automatically attack, and you need to be able to defend against those. And stealing? If you're already getting their junk and aid items when they die, what's picking a lock for a few more resources or purified water?
---
It worked for one then not the second time. I'm going on a Netflix  break then il try again soon. You might be onto something
---
Fair point. Bethesda though..more than a few of these mistakes could (and should) have been both spotted and avoided. They weren't, why? They have the tech, the people and the experience to know better.
---
That's exactly what it is.
---
There was no mention of player vending in there ITV which is the number 1 thing people wanted.
---
Always at work when I see these posts. After work all I see is Whitesprings. Guess it's time for a sick day.
---
I saw a level 100 like a week after the game came out - even if everyone has a clean slate, it'll be like 2-3 weeks before there are people able to gank you.
---
OMG I thought I was an idiot 'cause I could never find them as they relentlessly attacked me.
---
Yep, this is my go-to. I just wish we could paint the Excavators! I’m sick of looking like a human highlighter running through Appalachia.
---
The INTEGRITY of the current adventure mode characters is too far gone from bugs, exploits, and general changes done. If they resolve these issues before launching Survival, myself and everyone I know would come back more excited to play on fresh characters than when the game first launched!
---
This is Bethesda's chance to deliver on a version of the game that we should have gotten at launch! Do the right thing by the players!
---
Everytime I ever submitted a ticket regarding a crash or instability, THEY ONLY BLAME MY SYSTEM
---
Wipe all characters and alot of ppl will stop playing the game. Some players dont have any duped items and they shouldnt be punished for that.
---
I’d like to see it limited. Every map region has a faction base to some extent, use those. 
---
-Vault 76
---
-Your CAMP
---
-Owned workshops
---
-Teammates
---
-Morgantown Airport (Responders)
---
-Top of the World (Raiders)
---
-Harper’s Ferry (Free States)
---
-Fort Defiance (BOS) 
---
-Whitespring Bunker (Enclave) 
---
I love the idea of limiting respawn to your CAMP or Vault 76 when you die. It makes it at least a little bit like death has consequences and like killing your opponent is really a victory. 
---
It's a bit tricky, but I think I figured it out. You have to have all the conduit piping on one side of the wall and the conduit wire connector on the other side.
---
Why ask for this stupidity when the game is as unstable as my mental health!? 
---
If it wasn't the only reliable way to get plans, it wouldn't be a problem. But the high level vendors that are supposed to sell them have bugged loot tables and they won't appear in their inventories after specific levels. The only other ways to get them is to hope and pray that you come across them sitting on a table somewhere (where the percentages are extremely low), or you take a workshop and wait for the PvE events (funny how there are PVE events in places that griefers seem to think are PvP zones) where the plans drop.
---
I think it's under 'lights'
---
Why do you even have your mods on you at all times. That's dead weight. Put in stash. Use. Put back. That crap is usually 1lbs each. That's 1lbs of steel I could had in my inventory. 
---
Well I’m absolutely sure I can clear trash mods and keep them off the core group ... not sure how my build will do against the SBQ ... I guess the only way to find out is to join in next time someone nuked fissure prime ... great tips everyone!  I really appreciate the feedback!!
---
Yup but then how would it look after the nuke ? 
---
Use resources to “rebuild”
---
Just be yourself, I'm sure he'll like you back ^^
---
It’s under lights. It’s in the same line up as the nuka quantum sign, just scroll over.
---
New content my ar#e. First its a same content. Second, this only shows how bad Beths designers are. They have no idea what to build and how to build. Instead of actually expanding the map and give a dedicated PVP zone with actually events and rewards to give incentive people to go there, they are taking what they have, switching some rules and calling this a new content. Anyone who played DayZ, where hive was shared between PVE and PVP servers know how this concept doesn't work. And if they decide now go "Create New Character" approach, f#ck off. I would gone to PVP server from the start, but not after I have done all the quests and farmed all my gear, just to do that again. I rather stay offline or do PVP in normal servers. New mode is not something I would come back for.
---
100% agree. The modes need to be totally separate and require fresh characters. Any ranking system would be meaningless, especially in light of the xp and dupe glitches.
---
Agreed. Destroying CAMPs is a PVP action that for whatever reason Bethesda didn't account for. Last week I had some guy show up at my CAMP with his friend. His friend warned me that he was going around destroying other people's CAMPs. Why!? Because he knows he won't get tagged for PVP so he can get away with it. Workshops would definitely be an exception which is why I'm ok with the option of pacifist on adventure as long as it works properly.
---
Sure, I played hard to level to 346 on my main, but levelling up my alts was great fun too. Being weak and having to worry about mobs actually posing a threat is fun.
---
I don't think that's what they're looking for. 
---
I didn't even think there was still duping going on 
---
/justupvoteifthat'sallyouhavetosay
---
I’m only saying this to say that it’s wouldn’t be that bad to complete at your level.  Most of those quests are just clicking on things and gathering.  I completed at level 15 (with a 2H melee build, and 3 pieces of raider power armor) simply running past enemies and not engaging.  So feel free to give it a shot!
---
The only reason I did it as a level 15, is because I accidentally scrapped the ultracite power armor (final quest reward) on my main.  Why in the world didn’t they label it as ultracite, I’ll never know..
---
Look at your weapon in your inventory. Unequip damage perks. Check your weapon again.
---
Again you’re not paying attention. They are in my stash. That’s WHY they were scrapped. Are you truly this unaware as to how broken the game was released?
---
Done. 
---
We are running again just stating Charlie so 15-20 mins. 
---
Yessss I'm so down for this. Yall best not just try to resell us Fallout 4s Wasteland Workshop DLC through the Atomic Store though. 👀
---
^They're ^totally ^going ^to ^try ^to ^resell ^us ^more ^Fo4 ^assets, *^aren't ^they?*
---
Yea don’t know how I feel about this. I want player interactions to be tense but I also don’t want it to devolve into every one is a raider kill on site either. And it looks like this mode isn’t a survival mode where there are incentives for killing others or working with them, it looks like it’s just going to be kill on site mode. 
---
Wipe all cuz if u wanted PvP whole time and should get wipe then also if you wanted pve whole time should get wipe because both Sr unbalanced and everything should be wiped because I don't have good ngear cuz j never farmed for it so why should everyone get to keep playing there characters on survival mode or on adventure mode?  They should start over so they are even with me
---
Or maybe they just disagree with you?
---
Personally I'm fine with the stash as is. It's giving me more to do with managing my inventory. But I do agree that the camp budget is way too small considering how expensive items are to build. 
---
Yes, it intersects with the ladder to my basement if I use the conduit, the through wall will not pop through behind the ladder, so screw it, wire through wall :-)
---
I love it. It's a great game and comments kinse this dont add to the conversation. Just don't play. 
---
Why exactly do you think you speak for the majority of the playerbase?
---
I personally wholly disagree.
---
I am happy to start over on separate servers. At least there will be a couple weeks of not being overrun by duped explosive weapons.
---
r/whoosh
---
Stupid fucking mode. I didn’t want to take my pvp character over to the new servers but I guess I’ll have to. Assassin sentinel is going to ruin the new mode forgive me in advance. I wanted a fresh start.
---
It is too late for that, the "industrial" dupers have already traded much of their gear onward to others, some know its dodgy gear, some suspect and some are clueless.  It would be sad to have traded for dodgy gear with hard earned graft to have it deleted.
---
I am petty.
---
Yeah, this killed the game for me. I'm level 87, and have a full set of legendary armor, a full set of backup armor, 2 sets of power armor, and one of each of my favorite guns with 1-3 stars. As such, I'm constantly managing my stash space, and balancing just on the edge of 580-600. 
---
The game just feels so unrewarding now. I throw away almost everything I pick up, unless I happen to come across a legendary guy and I just hope he happens to drop a better star combo than the ones I already have, and that fit my build. Otherwise, it's just bumbling around aimlessly and picking up junk to go back to my base and play more of the Inventory Management mini-game and craft some ammo so I can go out and do it all over again. 
---
I haven't played in a week. I'm really, really disappointed. I really wanted to love this game. But one of the things about Fallout that made me really love it was the exploring and the collecting. The exploring now feels pointless without any reason to loot, and there's absolutely no collecting. 
---
Disagree.  The fact that it's not restarting from 0 is a deterrent.
---
At least with a server wipe it would be a legit server with no duped items. 
---
I imagine it's the same composer that created the Mii music.
---
I’m just surprised that there isn’t one working car. Also amazed and how I have plans and the ability to build a Mini Nuke but no ability to fix an engine :-)
---
If there isn’t slap damage you don’t need to stack Bobbleheads. Head shot crits do insane damage to either players. 
---
Laser is good
---
Ballistic is better
---
But one is the best
---
My Super-Sledge-Hammer
---
Yeah, a reset (or fresh 'league') is the only thing that can save the multiplayer part of this game.
---
Check lighting or misc.?
---
I'd rather it have a +50% damage Oppressor. It chews thru a lot of ammo to kill higher level enemies.
---
I don't understand why they couldn't just make all weapons only have base damage negating any boosts. You know.. like actual balanced PvP. Makes you want to get batter weapons with better stats rather than stat stacking and one shotting everyone
---
When i was that level, a scorchbeast was an immediate server change. 
---
I disagree with you but I upvoted you for adding to the conversation with a well-thought-out comment and the **downvote button is not an "I disagree with you!" button!**
---
It might not be, but a lot of them still have the items. 
---
Exactly.  We should not really even have a separate server/mode at all really. If anything three could be a more deadly "zone" on the map
---
You've got a point there. So assuming they keep the standard rules of hostiles nearby preventing fast travel, any player could keep you from fast traveling by mere proximity. 
---
Well, I hope they disable pvp grief/damage in adventure mode, at least for pacifist users. I would also prefer a duel request instead of this slap mechanic bullshit.
---
Then the public demo goes live. They have been up talking their endgame and I hope it is good. Same with Division 2.
---
My biggest question is: what the hell does the Scorched Fever Inoculation do? you get the same amount of damage before as you do after, you would figure that quest woudl help you take less damage against SBs
---
\&gt;weigh a ton
---
compared to what? The 20 pound handmades everyone carries around? Maybe you should be farming for lightweight guns instead of TSE?
---
\&gt;break after a few shots
---
or, actually like two or three full belts of ammo, more with perk specialization for longevity.
---
\&gt;do very little damage in comparison to past games
---
compared to what? I had a fully specced laser gatling in Fallout 4 and it barely did shit compared to a super sledge. You're delusional.
---
We do not speak of that place. 
---
Yeah I understand that but haven't heard of any duping methods now 
---
Example is the handmade rifle..
---
Lets say you get one. A nice shiny legendary one.. ooohh ahhhh uhhhh.
---
Its fully semi auto with a silencer and recon scope and the bestest stock evar!
---
Your build is a full auto hip shooter. Oh no what do?
---
Start crankin out buster lvl handmades from the plans. Make a dozen or so. Then scrap em all. Use scrapper perk if ya wanna feel like it helps (not really) recoup the losses.
---
With that dozen. You will learn a few alternate recipies for gun crafting. That will apply to that epic turd in your inventory. Making it not a polished turd but a purpose built killing tool.
---
Thats what crafting is for.
---
Or instead of yelling, have a mod or legendary variant of the syringer that causes them to land
---
Or Lucky 38
---
Right!  I've never seen an MMO where you could grind from 0 to max level in one day. 
---
Beeeet. Preciate it bud.
---
Anything is better than a White blank screen...
---
Hey a brain on Reddit.  Holy shit have I been looking everywhere for you lol.  Please be my friend I'm surrounded by outraged subredditers :(
---
Yeah, it had the same duping glitch though and seeing as its still here in FO76 just makes me loose hope, 
---
Personally im at 350 hours and when im playing with my group we always find something to do, but its because its fallout online and we love it. 
---
The dev team have dropped the ball though and need to make it up to us customers now with excellent work and patches, after reading the latest into the vault I'm struggling now really am. Really starting to believe it's all just a cash grab made out of one of my all time favourite titles / genres. Bethesda really have got to up there game i think personally and sugar coating stuff because some community manager might take offence is wrong. Bethesda created the mess and issues they should stand by there product regardless though.
---
Had thought about going back to ESO to check out the latest DLC when it drops, but now as it's got Bethesda's name on it i very much doubt i will.
---
Actually, Ill take this over another complaint thread.  Don't even worry about installing the trojan, Ill pm you my social.
---
Well i have explosive weapons which i farmed from  legendary robots in watoga so i should get my character wiped because you dont have any weapon like that? Doesnt sounds fair..
---
I'd also like to see fresh characters being requiered, however there are also benefits to being able to simply switch between modes.
---
For starters the obvious one that you don't feel like you're splitting your progress, you can play your 'main' and play as well as progress that in both modes. No need to be forced on an 'alt'. Think for instance recipes, which are a real pain to unlock.
---
Also consider how things would turn out down the line. There would be high level well geared players eventually anywhere. If someone wants to try out the Survival mode they would have to roll a new character and be vastly outgunned by all the lv100+ with legendary weapons.
---
If you can simply bring an existing character over this allows people to get comfortable, leveld and geared in the much more forgiving Adventure mode and hop over when they feel like trying. Giving these new playerd to the Survival mode a more fair chance, which makes it more likely they'll stick around as well.
---
The problem with overpowered gear is in my opinion more a matter of there being overpowered gear. TSE as it currently exists is simply ridiculously overpowered but also getting nerfed soon. If something is overpowered it should be balanced rather than employing measures to keep new game modes 'pure'. As this unbalance will still be an issue as eventually people will get those weapons anyway, and it persists as an issue in Advanture.
---
Am I mistaken in pointing out that Bethesda created/allowed greifers as a raider class in the game?
---
Now kith
---
As long as I can kill you with one head shot crit from stealth with my anti armour dragon it seems fair
---
There's usually a glitched mob of whatever is attacking you. One of my favorite pics is a fully naked, headless scorched in the guard shack at the Eastern Penitentiary.
---
Agreed. I've had success with Sugar Grove, etc. but have sometimes had to re-log several times. That's not all that fun and it's kind of a time sink. Also seems like once *you've* farmed out an area of world spawn items, they don't restock for a while. 
---
I think Bethesda developers are playing too much Fornite in their lunch breaks, they're getting all discombobulated when they go back to their coding thin clients.
---
Yeah survival was the reason I kept playing fallout 4 for so long but it wont be that way for 76
---
For a game that markets itself as "rebuild the world" you sure can't build/fix anything. Having no affect on the world feels like such a huge letdown.
---
Even without duped gear its a bad decision.  There are players that have exactly 0 duped items but still have "god tier" equipment due to already playing the game for hundreds of hours since beta/launch.    
---
New players will have to contend with existing players (legit or otherwise) with:  
---
* shielded underarmor: up to +3 to primary stat of choice.
---
* high end weapons including whatever then new top end meta is after TSE nerf
---
* all "assasins", "unyeilding" "weightless" and/or "sentinels" armor in EVERY armor slot
---
* top end PA and non PA armor 200% repaired from day 1.
---
* jetpack mods, calibrated, on and on from day one.
---
* every single mutation from day one.
---
* Deep pockets so they have a massive PvE advantage and can out collect junk needed to make ammo or build a solid defensive CAMP
---
* Bobbleheads aplenty
---
* recon scopes (assuming you can tag players these will be super helpful)
---
* dozens of every chem under the sun including "rare" ones like fury psychotats calmex etc. (sure they drop but you can stash them and only carry a couple at a time).
---
* CAMP bristling with rocket/heavy laser turrets (if this is advantageous, I suspect it won't be and instead players will op for very basic camps so it won't matter when they get destroyed :P )
---
I can probably keep going but really is the above a formula for a good PvP game?
---
One invites you to a team
---
Then he shoot his mate
---
Will drag you into pvp so his mate can one shot you
---
did you even read it? it is literally a completely separate game mode.
---
Agree.  Small payoff. And why should pvpers have to start over and over not have to start over anyway?
---
Separate rule sets is fine. As long as I can just join my friend in whatever server type they are playing in at the time.
---
Yep, even though I call the Mire Vietnam those tunnels are just too Vietnamese to not be called that
---
And one last thing, if you visit a vendor and zero their caps, than visit another vendor of that faction and buy/sell something to them at a later point, the 20 hr ish timer gets reset to the last time there was a cap change in the vendor.
---
I came to this thread to say that nothing beats marsupial. 
---
I am wrong. 
---
&gt;Crappy pvp servers at that. They are just enabling Duper vs Duper mode. Some of these players have unlimited Stim and Ammo.
---
Truth! 
---
&gt; They have developer room armor and weapons.
---
False.
---
Murgel is still there. 
---
Lool
---
Deriving entertainment from negative sources is bound to mess with your emotional well-being.
---
I’ve wondered if they could tag items based on how aggressive you are and if that could be the solution to the pvp/wanted problems. If you steal from other players the stolen items also drop with your junk if you die. If you kill another player unprovoked then you are flagged as a raider and all your stuff you are carrying is lootable when you die. Risk reward on whether you want to go raiding with your best gear. 
---
Sweet I’ll just trade to a friend who then trade to me.  Problem solved.
---
Just give legendary items with minimum prices based on legendary effects.  That will make it more difficult at least.
---
Yes well it's a price I'm willing to pay so that we have same clean slate
---
It's pretty rare. Like I'd say maybe 1 out of every 30 killed drop them. 
---
I am not mad at you.  I don't care about your opinions.  Your really full of your own importance and you need to get it through your obviously conceited sense of self importance, that I have no interest in your views.  What a deluded individual you really are.

It'll generally start if you go there and walk up to the door. Might not trigger if someone else has just done it but otherwise it should be fine.
---
Dude i found those weapons fair and square why should we have same clean slate lol 
---
You would have to disable workshops for those not in PvP mode, part of the issue with it is with out pvp mode people are just going to generate more resources than they need with workshops with zero risk. 
---
&gt;  Instead of actually expanding the map 
---
Not needed.  They just need to *use* the map.  Ever seen an event you wanted to go to on the left side of the map?  Yeah, me neither. 
---
Thanks, not sure i need both rifleman and shotgunner, dont mind going all into one type of weapon :)  
---
was thinking of something like this before:

(perhaps remove 5p from endurance and put them into agility for adrenaline)  
---
But was told that wouldn't hold up somewhat viably in end game.   
---
and on a side note, is junk shield really that good? feels like i'd get more resistance for those point if i put them in barbarian or evasive? and those are somewhat permanent, granted i carry junk most of the time but still.
---
Yeah basically they should have PvP mode and PvE mode. Thanks Pickle Rick. 
---
NO CHARACTER TRANSFERS EVER, NONE, ZIP, ZERO, NADA.
---
Only freshly created characters allowed!
---
I have only what I have looted from the world.  No two shots, but two guns that have explosive. 
---
And this kids.. is why punctuation is important
---
Why they would let people with duped items into a brand new mode to one shot everyone around them is beyond me.
---
See I don't mind that the weapons all balance out DPS-wise from the high capacity/high ROF heavy guns doing lesser damage I just am annoyed they chose to chamber the LMG for .308. It's just disproportionately expensive to craft compared to the 5mm and .50 cal that the other two heavy ballistic guns are chambered for. I can't keep it fed, I end up using it less than 10% of the time because it's always dry. I might just park it up for now because I just got an instigating hunting rifle today so I'm redoing my build a bit around that.
---
Make sure you're using MAXED OUT White Knight and Fix it Good cards when repairing normal armor.
---
It only takes 1 ballistic fiber per piece to repair now, and it repairs to 200% durability.
---
You'll be swimming in so much ballistic fiber you'll be selling it to other people :)
---
It sounds like a pvp fest and teams of existing min/maxing high level characters will dominate, probably all  stealth snipers, and those not in such a team will be fodder.  Bored folks at endgame might try it out for a while but trying to level up in that environment is going to be very tough. Not appealing to me, but I am sure it will have some devotees.
---
Can get ~10k tooltip on powerfist without abusing any bugs
---
Can't you just seed the whole vault area with mines then just watch the fun why sipping a sweet moonshine :))
---
I am not disgruntled with this game at all. Still very much enjoying, and probably will enjoy the PvP server.  However, unless there is a detail I am missing, I do not think there should be any form of transferring a character (not even one).  IMO survival mode should be an opt in, with no interaction between non survival characters.
---
Missed opportunity if it isn't a clean start from level 1 for everyone who opts in.
---
I agree that would be super cool
---
Yeah this is a fairly common bug and I don't really think people are using it as a duping method.
---
To soon, man. Too soon....
---
More budget, more stash, less dupes, more caps! 
---
[repeat ad nauseum]

If it makes you feel any better Op, In the fallout universe the teddy bears are actually tiny robobrains with the brains of new born babies inside.

I second this decision. Oh, and a fat man scaled up in size to be used for it
---
Please don't say Pickle Rick ever again. The McDonalds sauce videos still give nightmares at times.
---
If you get stuck in terrain then just place your power armor down and hop in. You're free.
---
Part of me has enjoyed managing weight as it is a challenge to tackle. I've adapted very well. But i still thirst for a little more freedom with it.

Boy, you in a whooooole heap of trouble.

pfft amateur,  you forgot to say. 'if you dont fucking add this in the next patch i will never buy another bethesda product!' 
---
Would you be happy at 1000. I feel like that's the perfect number. 
---
But if people can kill other people with no repercussions, then the game will become unplayable. People don't want a "good fight". If they can one shot someone in the back, they will, even more if they get away with it without any penalty. Case in point, when I got a BUGGED wanted level, they didn't care that I never intended to get it and they didn't hesitate to murder me on the spot BECAUSE THEY COULD. I've even been killed just because I was low on health and ran out of stimpaks. The guy spent two clips and I never fought back and he did it anyway. Hell, if there wasn't a limitation to level 5, there would be servers where people wouldn't even be able to leave the Vault after character creation.
---
Globes!
---
With level farming it won't take weeks.
---
Videos of the Wasteland was one of the better cosmetic mods on Fallout 4, I think. Bethesda should really incorporate something similar with Vault Tec tapes that play SPECIAL instructional videos and other advertisements. Collect them, input them into your televisions, then let them play on repeat.
---
No, I am not spinning up NEW characters for every new flavor of server or new mode they come up with.
---
I worked really hard to grind TWO characters up to 150.  I'm not spending all that time again to grind levels, find plans, etc.
---
No thanks.
---
Every game I've played the hardcore player base killed their own servers.  DayZ, H1Z1, etc.  They kept asking for more and more punishing restrictions until NOBODY played it any more.  Then they'll shut down the servers and you can come back here to cry why they took your servers away.
---
CHILL, let the casuals enjoy PVP too.  Otherwise you won't have anyone to play with, and they'll eventually shut down your depopulated hardcore mode.
---
I wasnt trying to be a butthole and apologize that I acted like one. You dont seem like a bad guy so I shouldnt have been an ass.
---
I just wanted to highlight that interface mods wouldnt usually cause massive crashes like people--even those with zero mods--experience with the game. Im well aware that mods can cause game problems, I know that first hand lol. 
---
It’s more about the gear. If duping really has been patched, then the amount of god mode gear will be greatly reduced. If anything, your toon should be able to move over, level and perks intact, (with an option to respec) but no gear. Those level 200’s will have to search and scavenge for gear like everyone else. 
---
I personally have no interest in pvp but if they reset the gear I might actually try it from time to time. 
---
lol, sounds like a future quest, how did you trigger it, and what did it tell you to do ? :)
---
Dude made a playlist on youtube of the three songs they use in case you wanna listen to it for sleepy time...[Atomic Shop Theme Song](https://youtu.be/LUA7S36MbAE) 
---
I’d not, then this mode will be ruined by stacked lvl 100+ warlords.  
---
Imagine if they made everyone create a new character for the PvP servers just to get past the "duping" issue.  So evvvvvvvvverybody had to start from scratch.  Then a few days later a new duping method was found, allowing the PvP characters to be flooded with duped items just like the ordinary ones.
---
The kvetching that would ensue would be epic.  
---
The Raider PA from roses quest dupes itself all the time too. Idk I just leave em behind 
---
The Nuka Cola plant is stuffed with it.
---
It's usually total happenstance, but they are common at whitespring and other well known areas. Always take advantage if you see one and the option for pvp arises...
---
All the wastelands inhabitants DNA has been mutated by the radiation. 
---
Spoiler Alert! lol
---
Don't play Survival then.
---
Back to the_dumpster with ye
---
Apology not accepted, next time do better
---
It was actually worse now as it can cause server roll backs apparently whilst kicking people off the server.
---
If you quit the game it records your items, if you force a server crash you get a slight roll back though as it's not saving on the fly.
---
Probably comming after the update or the next
---
I'm confused?
---
Oh man, even a lv 1 would have teared shit up lol
---
But even if they created a new character what would stop them from transfering loot from a duper account? All it would take is a friend to hold the loot then they transfer the loot from the middleman to the new account. 
---
Figure it out Bethesda.
---
I_like_things.
---
Literally doesn't matter haha, there gonna be a ton of no life griefers within a week with "God tier weapons" doing exactly what you are saying... Jesus, there's no winning with you guys... People want a place where they can be assholes openly, I am glad they have their new mode. I will be more than glad to continue, working with friends and randoms to do PVE content and hope for more...
---
ahh..
---
Strange, but cant remember that i have ever seen it, i am a lv121 :/ might just have forgotten it, lol
---
Given I've gained a paltry sum of caps from nuka cola, the positives vastly outweight the negatives for anyone that plays the game honestly. Doubt that applies to you as you seem keen on constructing a straw man followed by a personal attack and then proclaiming victory.
---
And where's the fear mongering? Non-existent. What hyperbole? Duping takes 15 minutes with the last method. Doubling quantity. 100000 caps can be duped in 15 minutes. Where's the conjecture in that? 
---
They dropped the ball on this and being stupid about not restoring items.  
---
It's THEIR decision that made it possible and retroactively doing a hidden message in the support page that you shouldn't drop items there is just TOO lazy.
---
Probably forgot to give any power to the support people - which is why we can't get the items back. Lost my legendary 2shot 50 cal, sucks. :D
---
I would like a full game that’s worth pumping time into and not an incomplete sham of a game with nothing to keep you interested other that shitty Sims-like micro transactions, since we’re asking for things that aren’t possible...
---
Whut in tarnation.....
---
Agreed. The endgame feels pointless. With the weapons that I have gotten being over lvl 100, no creature is challenging to kill. I'm shelving this game for a few months until something interesting happens. 
---
My post literally says no connection between the servers. Adventure and Survivor characters should not have the ability to interact. Period
---
Exactly how I've seen it. A challenge. I've currently found a way to keep 4 different sets of full PA alongside ~20 full FC's and thousands of rounds of ammo and various legendary items and junk (which I always bulk so I can sell it as soon as I see I have too many stacks).
---
I'm find with it as is and don't much care if we get an increase or not. Personally I'd prefer being able to craft multiple Stash containers that each have their own limit or are perhaps even limited in what they can stash. Someone else mentioned being able to stash different items in the benches as well, but idk about that. 
---
You have no data to back that up.  I'm not willing to start over.  I have a life, I'm not going to manage multiple characters.  
---
I just read that a day or two ago about the generator plans for the 'powering up' events and it was actually pretty cool to learn. I had been looking for the fusion gen plans for a bit but didn't know they were basically guaranteed if you do the event a few times.
---
Boring. . . 
---
i have over 300 hours in and i havent even been to the nw. i have not been se, i have not been anywhere west of vault 76, and i have  been to teacup island once. i need to play more. 
---
Wasn't a miscarriage... 
---
I worked really hard to grind TWO characters up to 150. I'm not spending all that time again to grind levels, find plans, etc.

Every game I've played the hardcore player base killed their own servers. DayZ, H1Z1, etc. They kept asking for more and more punishing restrictions until NOBODY played it any more. Then they'll shut down the servers and you can come back here to cry why they took your servers away. DayZ Vanilla was the least popular server type in the entire mod community. H1Z1 had hardcore servers, which were always empty, and eventually went away.
---
**CHILL, let the casuals enjoy PVP too. Otherwise you won't have anyone to play with, and they'll eventually shut down your depopulated hardcore mode.**
---
“If not”.  Sorry, I was in a hurry to contribute without proofreading.
---
I mean, to be real, i usually check the thing like twice, then walk away from it bored. Once the super mutants take it, it's free. 
---
Oh god 'carebear' haven't heard that since I was playing Eve lol
---
I agree. When I was low level I got a chassis that I had to strip bare to use. Randomly days later I had 2 in my inventory and one had a full set of armor at a lower level that I could use. I was amazed and sooo thankful for the glitch!!  
---
You get power from the station nearby?
---
My wish would be be that they would just incorporate pvp events in the current world, similar to workshops but popping up at random in various places.  
---
Yeah, no.  It's really not. 
---
what if you overly disagree with it?
---
I think 2000 would be the best goal.  It has to be higher because the Perks we have don't impact the storage STASH.  So if you have a really nice rifle or heavy weapon that's 20+ lbs right there in a STASH box.  Explosive ammo is even worse in storage since you would normally have a Perk to reduce the weight to make it possible to carry it.  Stand alone power armor parts are bad too, unless you put them on frames.  If you ever want to switch playstyles on a characters and swap back and forth, you have to have significant extra space to account for the weapons and armor you offload into the STASH.
---
It will be same code in each server and that they were detailing it's PvP configuration and not the bug fixes that will come in the next patch.
---
Having servers with a different config is the first step to private servers.
---
There is a liberty prime power armor mod for fallout 4
---
If they required you to send it back, they would have said so.
---
I'm not sure DayZ should be an example for *anything*.
---
man i also love armchair game design
---
No that quest is

miscellaneous
---
Get your dropped items
---
Has nothing related to Player Death and I did not die so stfu  with the whole " this is whats wrong with the internet"
---
I was simply asking people what they think as it confused me.
---
I'm glad you worked hard for your characters. I have worked hard for mine as well. I still think we should make new characters as it wouldnt be fair for new player to run into your level 150 Or my level 103 on day one.
---
Yep, I have definitely had this one happen to me before. Ended up paying like 30-something caps to fast travel like a quarter mile away for the only event on the map one day 
---
Just had a thought as well, will all the items being sold on ebay be removed and gone before this mode launches or even if duping is stopped can people just buy there TSE's and hop straight on over to the new servers?
---
Bethesda, you got to talk to us, open communication. a weekly vague post doesn't do it. Take a leaf out of Ubisofts book with the division, get some weekly streams going and some lets plays! 
---
Find it very hard to believe that any of you at Bethesda even bother playing 76 i really do. I mean how can you play the game and be that disconnected from your own customer base :(
---
I just don't think "Let's have a perfect PVP server because the PVP players have already wrecked the PVE server" Seriously, every PVP player I've run into is running around with duped TSE's and shit. It's all trolls and dupers and griefers and the idea that some PVP server WON'T be composed, primarily, of the toxic fucking garbage that's made the social interaction on the main servers so painful is...a joke. 
---
I like this. I think it's annoying when I get mean messages or get shot at from people being mad that I won't sell them my weapons that I'm using. People should learn to check for offers only, I told you I sell chems, I'm not giving you my level 50 single action.
---
That actually means a lot because I was extremely self conscious the entire time I was editing because of my voice 😅
---
I wouldn't mind being a highlighter if the helmet looked better though..
---
I understand if you think it is too similar or whatever, or you were expecting team deathmatch, but it is literally a separate game mode so
---
If hearting a weapon makes it safe then i think there should be a limit to the number of things you can heart. 
---
That includes you no? 
---
No problem! Thanks for the support!
---
Then don't play it from the menu. It's optional not mandatory. Play in adventure mode, that's what I'm planning on doing. 
---
That area was tough for me too at the beginning. High concentration of enemies in a smallish space
---
I can't believe you've done this
---
lol, nope, do you have a location for it ? :D going plan hunting now...
---
i understand that but my point is i couldn’t see vault 76 or any near locations at all. 
---
nah, PC. Appreciate the sentiment though!
---
Oooooo I’m telling mom! Jk super cool when it happens to a good person with a conscience. Glad you came clean. We forgive you. &lt;3
---
The mode has already failed.
---
The ability to bring another character over means even if duping is fixed it doesn’t matter. It takes 1 mule to just ruin the economy all over again. 
---
If Bethesda don’t make it so you have to start fresh the new mode will be dead before it’s even alive. 
---
Assassin sentinel/Cavalier and Explosive Weapons 1 second into its release.. pathetic..
---
Been looking forward to this mode to start fresh and this is coming from someone with a maxed lvl build assassin sentinel perfect perks etc..
---
Truly disappointed and hope they rethink this before it’s too late.
---
Thank you so much!!! I was so nervous releasing this mostly because of how long people would have to listen to my voice haha &lt;3 
---
I have given up on this game. I tried holding on. This specific reddit itself is the best part about the game and honestly thats sad.
---
I really don't get how you can fuck up so many times in a row and not have a some sort of realization at this point.. I just dont get it. 
---
Hope the game improves soon for the rest of you. Dope ass sub. But the game just isnt fun..
---
In survival they should remove the player indicator completely,map n all.
---
It should act like the player is constantly wanted with no indication any other player is near, at least then we may have a standing chance of actually surviving in that mode without being constantly hunted for leader board points.
---
It'll be alot more immersive having to hide within buildings or using stealthboys/chameleon gear to hide from potential aggressive players 
---
All excellent points!!
---
This would make me much more likely to try it, actually.
---
You better go drop that thing in a river and server hop!
---
Easy caps? Easy kill sure but they won’t have much of cake on them so what would be the point. If it’s just to provide frustration to the new person, not really any different to the way it is now?
---
While I don't agree with being able to use existing characters, everyone is giving a choice to. You are not at a disadvantage unless you put yourself at one. And TSE isn't a big deal after the nerf so I don't see why that is your BIG issue, you should care more about bloodied/cavalier/sentinel armor.
---
Ultimately the mode won't be dead as everyone is  saying, and there is only a disadvantage between character if you choose to. So if the mode will be dead for anyone, it will be for those who wish to start a new character for no reason.
---
I fast travelled to a horde event up it didn't say what horde it was bugged out and when I load in it pops up yet when I checked my quests it wasn't there only came up for a split second.
---
I have all the sneak perks, plus one piece of chameleon, and two of those 'become harder to detect' pieces.
---
Im invisible. Rarely ever get seen unless things get reeeally screwed up. So im guessing they all stack to make you more effective? 
---
Plus got that muffled mod on both leg pieces. I also hear lightweight helps too. Less heavy armor means more quiet.
---
Then post your disagreements. This should be an area for all thoughts to be shared and debated. Bethesda should make a choice based on the fans as a whole so everyone make your voice heard. If I am in the minority then let this post show it.  
---
Preach. 
---
Noted game designer NetLibrarian has schooled us all.
---
Im level 151 and it's the first time I've seen it I think.
---
Jesus dude, they announced this was something they were going to have soon weeks ago... Why is everyone bitching about this now??
---
Thats nice and all, but what about the planned **Player Faction System**? That would make PVP a lot more interesting than just a survival deathmatch mode.
---
Also, what about **Player Vendors**, **New Vaults** and increasing the **Stash Limit**?
---
Where it IS NOT is at least one of the fissure sites in the far south east.
---
I like to PvP, but I'm a level 200+ solo player and I believe there's little incentive for me to enter this mode. I'm at max caps so nothing to gain on that, but a lot to lose (I can lose 400+ caps per death!?). I would be dying fast to teams of two or more, and lose a ton of caps + aid items.... what do I have to gain? Is there better loot in this server that makes taking on the risk described above fruitful?
---
People can their existing characters. So dupers with their TSE and maxed bobble heads will stomp you in one hit 
---
Did BGS post something in the last 24hrs where is this panic coming from
---
No you’ve definitely seen it. I thought I never saw it either, but it’s that dead dog with the dead raider you see on your way to meet Preston
---
I’ve been over encumbered for the past month. 
---
I wanted to do this SO MUCH! The reason I didn't hang out for longer is simply because I couldn't find that many without stretching some things. Also? I had already been working on the video for a month and a half and was just too excited to wait any longer! 
---
Yes you should. It's the same mode but no slap damage. Why are u making it out to be a completly different mode worth only starting a new character? I've worked too hard and too long for my build and can't wait for this mode. My only guess is that you and everyone who liked your comments don't have good gear. This is a vad sugesting. No
---
Heheheh! Yeah I've been rocking the double calibrated shocks on power armor. Keep portable power on too. So I'm chassis galore. I run all the weight reduction cards. I only keep scrapped junk in the stash. Only keep the weapons I want. I don't use any normal armor. I have a great groove going. As a power smith, I'd like to have just a little more room so I can save more stable flux. I craft jet packs for t45, t51, t60. Takes a lot of flux. Even if they just added another 200 bump to the space, it would be a bit help. 
---
I didn't say if I liked it or didn't. Not relevant.
---
It might be just tweaked features, but it is a separate game mode. It's just an objective fact.
---
You can not like it, that's cool, but it is still literally a separate mode.
---
Not only that but as soon as the nuke is finished or actually in the zone people may try to gun you down to gather the loot you gathered 
---
Can you guys put a ticket system in the game and have the game autoreport drops like  these instead of relying on people to log in to a forum that they have literally no indication to log into other than posts by the team in random reddit threads please?
---
I sincerely thank you for the offer, but I won't be coming back to 76 until the dupers are all banned and the dupes are out of the economy. That, or we get private servers.
---
They mentioned leaderboards, which will encourage people to get kills or damage or whatever it will be they track so I am thinking that stealth sniper teams will rule and there will be little incentive to cooperate outside of the team.  Not a place for casual individual play to be sure.
---
I know many of you don't want to hear this. However here it is. I'd pay extra for higher stash limits. 
---
I for one would buy the lunchboxes. I don't mind spending a little more on a game that I enjoy. I have never had high expectations about this game. Only downside so far is the occasional freezing.
---
High risk high reward. 
---
If you want to team up you'll have to coordinate instead of lobbing grenades at the guy with the x01 armor and super slesge.
---
Vendor bot, yes.  PvP no.
---
Stash limits increased or camp display cases, yes.  PvP no.
---
Something besides SBQ or Whitesping to nuke, yes.  PvP no.
---
Player hub, yes.  PvP no.
---
Stop bobbleheads and magazines from stacking,  yes, for love of God, YES.  PVP no.
---
99 problems and PvP ain't one.
---
How is it going to kill solo play?
---
I'd have liked to keep things like Perfect Storm, Bunker Buster, Pyrolator etc... there's no room to keep those nice unique items. 
---
If it wasn't for people selling legendary equipment to the Watoga vendor, I wouldn't have any either.
---
Thats does sound extremely op. I would think that it reduces dmg for the individual piece. If your shot in the leg then that individual piece would reduce dmg by 15%.
---
About number 4, I've found that when this happens your best bet is to go to sleep: the menu will pop up and once you quit the menu your character will get up and workbenches work as expected after that. Worked for the few times I had this issue lol
---
Drop site C2 bottom right of the map. 
---
It is a half submerged bunker. Go in and at the back left of the bunker, next to a metal box on the middle shelf is a plan spawn. 
---
There is also usually a mini nuke and hazmat suit to the right of the spawn on the same shelf middle shelf. 
---
If you’re also going to lose aid items upon death then healing factor is going to be the meta 
---
Bethesda should hire you as creative director!
---
Seriously, gotta be better than the one they have right now!
---
I think Scavenger and Survival are better names but that's just my opion.
---
because you need to craft some to dismantle to learn random mods for the legendary?
---
On day 40 a new player will still run into level 150 with TSE. Unless they keep resetting it every season this won't matter.
---
I agree, it's bullshit.
---
It doesn't change the fact that it is a separate game mode. You don't play with people playing the other game mode. If op was making a statement about shared characters, they should have chosen better wording.
---
Chameleon pieces in past games have stacked the sneak percentage, though like the other guy said it doesn’t make you “more invisible”
---
That has been known from the day the game was announced.
---
Did you read it? Because while technically it is a separate game mode it also isnt at the same time for a few reason. Reason 1 is you can bring over existing characters. Reason 2 is Character progress is shared; Quests, Inventory, current health and status effects all shared. This will lead to the same type of gameplay except now the dicks can be dicks easier. 
---
In order for it to truly be a separate game mode it should be completely separate. No being able to bring over characters, items, or anything. Fresh start level 1 characters that are locked to that game mode. And going forward that's how it should remain your character is locked to whichever game mode they were created in.
---
I think a nice solution to that would be to allow players the option for building locked display cases they can stash weapons in to keep them from using stash space and allow players to show off their loot. 
---
Go read Dungeon Lord by Hugo Huesca, best I can suggest for lazer sharks.

Nope. He walked up to me at my base, I've been running pacifist since day fucking one because PVP in this game is stupid. I didn't have a workshop, i wasn't in an event. None of that shit. I was building on my fucking base and some shitloard walked up to me with a power fist. 
---
You're just, flat out, fucking, wrong. 
---
2000 would be so insanely good. Like if you fill that, it's your fault. Right now filling 600 isn't really any fault of ours. Filling 1000-2000... that would just be poor management. So yeah I feel like that's an ample number for sure. 
---
Please explain me what's up with this survival mode plz. I'm kinda out of the loop.
---
All that sells real nice to vendors.  
---
Swing speed * base damage = damage per second
---
ie: A 180 dmg slow melee weapon is comparable to 40 dmg fastest swinging weapon. ( not actual numbers, I dont melee much)
---
not going to lie, that's what i assumed. I work for a Fortune 100 company so i am continually surprised. 
---
Ooooh I see, so "your team" initiated pvp therefore you take full damage...
---
That probably shouldn't happen
---
What I meant was known spawn and fast travel points are exploitable and the easy caps was more in reference to white springs I'm not sure if I actually had any caps out of the vault 
---
Yeahhh. A pvp server / mode isnt going to keep me playing. No thank you. Over 200 hours in. Just about done everything there is besides legendary grinding.
---
Never liked pvp in this game.. Never will.
---
I read somewhere that you should try and uninstall then reinstall the game.  I have the issues also, but it's not too bad most of the time.  I might try to reinstall this weekend and see if it helps...
---
I think it would be nice if this resulted in fewer dingdongs constantly using explosives for everything. 
---
Irony is picking up the key AFTER sneaking in. Haha Sort of like T-fuse building.
---
Oh boy! Basic functionality that should have been present from day one is finally here! Kudos all around!
---
I was looking to actually play this game again after hearing this mode was on the rise. 
---
Then finding out the characters can carry over....Uggggggghhhh...... BUT I DONT WANNA PLAY CALL OF DUTY!!!!!
---
Count me in. 
---
I start swinging my melee when that happens and eventually it's dead. I never see it but I'm fairly sure.
---
Maby that creates more ''raiders'' in the playerbase, that would be interesting
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_weapons](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_weapons)
---
As long as the 100 damage weapon is the same 2h or 1h as the weapon you are holding then your perks are already applying to the damage listed on the weapon. 
---
However you also have to take into consideration level and scaling, so the wardrum does more base damage than the sledge hammer but it stop at level 45 and a level 50 sledge hammer does more damage than a war drum. thats just based on me picking stuff up. 
---
**To be clear I agree with you**, but one issue that you may not have considered and is a challenge from Bethesda's perspective is that there's a 5 character maximum per account. There are people who have reached this maximum, myself included. This effects a minority of players, for sure, but it's a challenge for Bethesda nonetheless because this minority has still purchased the game and this maximum is a rule they have chosen to apply. I have only actually played on two characters, and the other three are caps/item mules. Say I'm able to offload the items from a mule (I dunno how, but w/e), there's still nowhere the 25k extra caps can go. If survival mode required a new character, that would disproportionately impact my account if that were a mode I chose to play. There's no way I'm the only one in that situation.
---
I hope Bethesda hears the playerbase's concerns regarding survival mode, but I just wanted to offer another perspective. It's easy for us to point out things that we'd like or even things that seem elementary - why would they not design this system that way? There's usually more to it, and I hope Bethesda chooses to tackle those challenges rather than brush them aside.
---
Cool.  
---
Thankfully this happened happen to me like in 3-4 weeks, but when it did it was 3 weeks of super annoying hell on xbox
---
where does that plan drop, same as the above places ? :)
---
The whole PvP server thing is a terrible implementation. 
---
Yeah that freezing has been quite frequent for me. Although 2 nights ago I finally had a crash free session! Was just luck because last night I crashed twice. 
---
RemindMe! 2 days "Stash update"
---
ive only seen it at 1800, there was several other bundles released that had a price of 1400
---
I’m going to say it’s something like that fungus that infects ants and makes them climb up trees.  It gives animals a “base need” to do something, in this case it might just be as simple as making them come to the scorchbeasts, which then gives them protection.

I just want sea creatures man! So much opportunity for boat missions in rivers/lakes and shit. Ah! 
---
Gotta love poetry
---
Yeah, if you want to look back in my post history I've got a (general) guide pointing out some of the tricks to each of them. Not extremely detailed, but there is enough there to answer any questions you might still have.
---
Just you think about that, Lebowski.
---
TSE is still going to be the strongest damage modifier combo hands down. I don't know why everyone is up in arms about the nerf numbers. They're well deserved. Yeah the TS part is getting overnerfed unless they drastically reduce the accuracy debuff that it gets, but when paired with explosion it's still stupidly strong. Explosive is still too strong for a secondary legendary trait. Literally nothing else touches it in consistent damage.
---
Correct but at least everyone had a chance for a fresh start at the beginning of the server.
---
It is not a perfect solution and yea it will suck to restart from the beginning but shouldn't that be the fun of a "survival" mode anyway? Working your way up through the ranks. Fighting for survival from the base.
---
At day 60 if a new player sees a level 100+ then at least that new player knows that high level character faced the same trials and tribulations they too are about to face.
---
I don't think you are in the minority. But basically as a part-time player there is no way I'm making a second player just do be in an open PVP realm.
---
If it is only new characters it'll be a month after the mode comes out it will be full of over over levelers, and dups weapons, and other hacks and what not.
---
You need to get the flamer mod for the chainsaw.  The lighting adds to the creep factor.
---
I've been running this get up for a while, and I recommend that fanascht man mask.... it really adds to the creep factor too.
---
But I like someone is taking it to the next level with the loot drops and such.
---

\*\*server crash\*\*
---
&gt;If you do take on Survival mode with an existing character, keep in mind that all your progress from Adventure mode will travel with you, and anything that affects your character in one game mode will also affect them in the other.
---
How can a group of otherwise competent people so consistently arrive at terrible approaches to things supposedly in their wheelhouse?
---
They are one of the few I will actually repeat. Had a weird one though yesterday at Posiedon where I did the reactor fixes fine, then went and cleared all the cooling tower stuff, but it didn't register any quest progress for those. Even though I finished the rest of the goals under time it expired without completing (but didn't give a fail notice) 
---
Then someone else started the event again a minute or two later, and it immediately gave me credit for all the cooling fixes I had made on the last attempt. Completed it that time. Again it didn't give an event end notification, but I checked and it had still granted me all the rewards.
---
Yep, weird to me that they didn't go the route of trying to satisfy the, 
---
&gt;where I can not think of consequences of killing or dying and just have fun
---
aspect for the "PVP players".  I was 99% sure we'd get an instanced PVP experience that's kind of "click and play".  Is rust-like PVP even that popular?
---
Will be a very strange game experience given the current size of populations on the (relatively) large map + whether or not people's markers will be visible on the map or not.
---
Oooh male or female? I had a female out at Poisidian, I called her Babette. 
---
Shit I would start playing survival mode just so everyone is forced to have a clean slate. I could really do without players having TSE shotguns/gauss rifles/whatever and infinite bobbleheads in fucking survival mode. That would absolutely suck.
---
Not only "standing still", but the Sentinel effect applies when jumping as well, which of course it's ridiculous (I've a full set and still want it nerfed). 
---
Did someone whisper "Esports ready" in Todd's ear?
---
And they should disable legendary drops in survival mode too if the want somewhat balanced gameplay.
---
Yeah, they not really thought it out have they. Just needed something to post up so peeps wouldn't go in on them :/
---
They need to Pull the Atom store and go back to the drawing board and fix the game from the ground up.
---
We need group content for end game, separate pvp / pve servers, and more than 1 boss fight per map per server!
---
Can you imagine SQB with 2 or 3 nukes on her, cluster fuck of lag and TSE shot gunners one shotting everyone before the queen even screams at us once :(
---
I'd love a challenge but that just sounds annoying
---
There's a new "inside the vault" describing the upcoming survival mode
---
So the answer is to do nothing and let them all in anyways? At least having a clean server to start with will allow Bethesda to hault the spread easier without 2 months of inherited issues.
---
Really? Do we get more info on it later in the game?
---
r/monkeyspaw
---
I came across Willy (Michael) the other week. Man I was so happy ))) I got the golden Holo tape boys!! 
---
The new mode should be a clean start, and legendary weapons and armor should either be dialed way, way back or eliminated altogether. Same stackable buffs. How can you have a competitive mode with weapons that do thousands of damage per shot, and on the other hand have armor and perk loadouts that render players invincible against other players?
---
I've said it before, I will keep saying it until I croak or Bethesda does what it should and rolls back "legendary loot." That shit never should have been put in these goddamned games to begin with. What is so legendary about that particular radroach, or glowing ghoul. It's just such a lame mechanic that breaks whatever immersion I've managed to muster.   
---
Bethesda said this game was going to be about rebuilding, what it turned out to be is a shitty loot grinder where everyone is after the same God weapons because if you don't have them, you may as well try to piss up a rope. PLEASE don't submarine this mode by putting everyone at the mercy of people who have nothing better to do than farm Whitespring hundreds of times. At least make them start back at zero.
---
Ah well. I was just working on something at the desk anyway, and had LeG15FastMacro running.
---
I've seen a few but have never actually made it to one yet. Either too late or was in the middle of some other thing.
---
Vendors act like other world containers. The initial loot is instanced per player. If you put (or sell) anything into them, then all players can see it.
---
Since plans can't be sold, they are always instanced to each player. What you see and buy has zero impact on what others see.
---
Some vendors have limited options--Whitespring Station's Barbed Walking Cane for example--and you will get repeats. But if one player buys that plan, the next player will still see it available.
---
It would be neat if they could use the TV to make dream events. Like if you sleep near the relay tower close to vault 76 with the TV on, you do G.O.A.T. event and there can even be npcs because it's a dream. The relay near the scorched can be a mob wave mode. Another could be a tales of mystery sci-fi event. But I guess that would be more like add-on content. 
---
You thought wrong, bethesda never said that. New pvp mode is tentatively slated for March. 
---
Which brings me to my other point that no way I’d make another character just for a PVP realm. 
---
being this angry over a video game
---
Only important thing is plans will be marked. PvP will be ruined by dupers. 
---
No NPCs was a dumb idea without giving players trading capabilities and being able to offer quests etc.
---
Hah! I have been wondering how to get past the locked doors, and figured there must be a sewer entrance or something.
---
Nope. 
---
Sounds like you're looking to play Fallout 3 or 4 👍
---
What about the map markers I think there should be no player map markers in survive mode
---
I mean I hit wendigo cave, EMS and whitesprings a lot so could be all the wendigos. I've also got a few hundred springs that never seem to go down too
---
While I applaud your forward looking approach (e.g. clans/factions and player interaction such as trade/trade routes), this will never be the case with 24 persons in an 'instance'.  I think the PvE/PvP modes is a step in the right direction though.  Next will need to be server permanence and an increase in players per instance/server.
---
Looking back at my newbie self I am glad that I was chased into a pack of super mutants 3x my level by a scorchbeasts.  Made it all the more rewarding in the day I stood my ground and took that flying bat down all on my own.  Survival can be rough sometimes. It’s motivation.  
---
Not only that, but characters need to be locked to a mode.  Adventure characters should not be able to move to Survival and vice versa.  The ONLY thing that I would consider ok is if someone starts a Survival character and ends up hating the mode, they should be able to move that character to Adventure, but it can NEVER go back to Survival.  And it should give you a big warning.  "You are about to move your character to Adventure mode.  This transfer is ONE WAY and cannot be undone.  Type your characters name to continue."
---
I just got the Carnivore mutation and the party boy perk and I eat steaks and chug whiskey all of the time. It's so much easier than water and the 2x benfit for eating meat is great.....I never even ate vegetables before.
---
And rob those shops! 👺
---
One of the more annoying things are the "horde" events. You fast travel to some point to start, and then find out there's three random areas all across the map you have to then travel to and search. 
---
I know there bases that get attacked only by low level rats. Those are kind of bases I'm looking for
---
Ahh, ok. Thank you.
---
It’s not auto scrap. That part, thankfully is safe. If you want to see what I mean then try this. Go to a tinker bench and look at ammo crafting requirements. Drop all steel until you’re literally 1 scrap under the required amount. Buy any mod for whatever that contains steel as a scrap panel resource. Place it in your stash. Make the ammo. Your mod is now gone. 
---
Except I want to play with friends and family. 
---
&gt;while technically it is a separate game mode 
---
that's it. that's the argument. case closed. it is a game mode separate from the one we know. that is all i am commenting on. if op was making a statement about the characters carrying over, then they should have chosen their words better.
---
i get what you're saying, i don't disagree that the characters should be separate, but it is an objective fact that it is a game mode separate from the original. that's all im saying.
---
this mode needs 2 basic things to happen if it will ever have a chance.
---
1. OP is right. New character with NO contact between PvE and PVP servers.
---
2. An absolute complete end to duping.  Duped equipment will end this real soon. Whether it is already duped stuff entering from the Adventure servers or Dupers in PVP pool their resources and dupe the good items they find and outfit each other.
---
there are other things that can kill this new mode but these 2 will cause it to be DOA. I wont even try it if these 2 points are not done. I just cannot compete with GOD geared players with unlimited stims and bobbleheads.
---
Where’s this entirely clean economy coming from
---
If they remove the feature with using existing characters then i would love it
---
That's a healthy compromise imo.  Also adds a bit of an edge to the survival part.
---
Then it might not be for you. I don't say this as a dismissive comment or to shut anyone out. Modes aren't for everyone, and many are willing to do this. I understand time restraints as much as anyone but this is still the best choice (that I can see) for the greater good of the game.
---
Yep.  They are too lazy to create an actual separate server/mode so they just slapped a new PvP rule set on the current model and are calling it a "new game mode".
---
Super lazy
---
YES ASTROPANDA! I know it must have some background though! Didn't want to include it until I found that out first! 
---
Its per character too, ive gone to the same vendors with different characters and they have different cap counts(they also have different vendor specific stuff) 
---
I'd like an option to migrate the character's appearance only to survival. I don't mind starting fresh for that mode, but I don't want to painstakingly recreate the face.
---
I finished one the other night after only having to search one area. It gave me the success pop-up but listed zero rewards.
---
Just a suggestion for all platforms, how about increased damage dealt to enemies but decreased damage resistance? It would make the game a lot more tense!
---
I think it's fixed i haven't heard of a new duping method i heard rumors that there is a secret discord server that has found a new one but they are keeping it under wraps 
---
&gt; players who die in Survival mode will be unable to use the seek revenge respawn option against their aggressors and can only choose to respawn at their C.A.M.P. or Vault 76
---
::gazes into my crystal ball:: I see snipers in chameleon armor, camped outside Vault 76 and one-shotting anyone who happens to spawn there
---
I feel like we really don't. I've only twice gone past 400, let alone 600. 
---
I agree with more Camp budget space though. 
---
Splendid. When does this patch go live? I'm aware that PC patches come earlier than the console patches. 
---
Not really, it will be a lot harder for a new player to level up who joins the game in a few months. That level 100 player didn't have to face bored level 100s camping spawn killing everyone trying to leave.
---
Hah! Well I mean, jet packs are a thing on power armor right?
---
I mostly want a larger stash, that would rock. 
---
(rolls eyes)
---
I said questionable because I need more info on what exactly we drop
---
It's just very unclear in their post 
---
I’m assuming that the only reason the are initially deciding to allow it is because they thought that the community would be mad if they were forced to restart a character. But it is what we want, so please do it. 
---
Are you sure it isn't intended to be for recommended Player level?
---
Survival should either have all legendary effects disabled, or new characters only. It's already easy enough to one shot any wanted guy from a massive distance with my TSE black powder rifle, I can't imagine the kind of murderfucking that a dude with a fully decked out set of duped legendary gear + weapons and a million nuka grapes can do.
---
I like to PvP in games and i fail to see the appeal of this mode, especially for solo players. 
---
Now the issue is the shitty loot drops. And getting a decent non TSE will be unlikely.
---
In survival mode gank squads will pwn every single solo player they could find.
---
That was the duping method they fixed
---
So allow this issue out of the gate?
---
Why, praytell, would they not announce that they've solved one of the biggest problems in their newest game?
---
I meet neat folks and have fun. Works for me. I just want way more with tons of variations. 
---
It's just a skin from the Atom shop!
---
If existing accounts were unable to access the Survival servers (requiring a fresh character), there'd be no way to flood them with the duped materials. In essence having a line drawn between the modes would keep survival from being ruined by all of the duped items in adventure.
---
Maybe even separate inventories. Same character but separate inventories, stashes and camps.
---
I have had the game for a little over a week and I feel like I keep seeing the same events over and over, no matter how many times I complete them. Some new events added at regular intervals would be awesome. Also, while wandering throughout the map I just don't encounter that many enemies. I was expecting to really have to fight my way through the map but it's more like a leisurely stroll and every once in a while I have to kill a robot or a scortched.
---
I was responding to your comment that all heavy weapon perks apply or none do. Your comment made it sound like (to me anyway) those were the only options, when the fatman and missle launcher are working properly. 
---
This isn't the first comment I've seen that is optimistic about Bethesda, but pattern analysis suggests that long term planning isn't their strong suit. I'm sure someone with some juice said "would it be a good idea to let people just transfer their regular characters to hardcore?" and that idea monopolized people's thoughts without any of the playing audience available to ask "WTF?"
---
This is not the first time that I have to wonder if anyone involved with the game plays it for fun (I mean, fairly and according to the rules), because it shows a real lack of foresight on their part.
---
There is no point. Bethesda Totally gutted crafting and fundementally unbalanced the game when they planned on including legendarys. This game would be so better off if legendary effects were something that could be crafted into a preexisting weapon randomly with rare materials than it is now.
---
Don't know why you have so many downvotes. Mode is completely optional
---
Yeah. They're a real headache to get. Glad you worked something out!
---
I get that, I just thought white springs was semi safe lol. Might as well label the whole map lvl 1-99
---
Then make a new character specify for survival? That is the option that is suggested on the patch notes. 
---
Not sure about aqua boy, but yes with collecting with 3rd tier lead belly.  Not from drinking but yes when collecting
---
Yeah, sadly I dont know how to do that. Cant you plug in a USB drive and transfer the image files to that. I know I've backed up a fallout 4 save file to USB, so pictures should be doable.
---
Not only that, but characters need to be locked to a mode. Adventure characters should not be able to move to Survival and vice versa. The ONLY thing that I would consider ok is if someone starts a Survival character and ends up hating the mode, they should be able to move that character to Adventure, but it can NEVER go back to Survival. And it should give you a big warning. "You are about to move your character to Adventure mode. This transfer is ONE WAY and cannot be undone. Type your characters name to continue."
---
I've been disconnected 4 times today in the span of a couple hours maybe less... Jan 24 2019
---
This.  At least that way I don’t have to worry about those couple things killing me while I go pee and get my kid a drink or whatever. I find I cannot play as enjoyably without a pause feature, but these 3 make it even more difficult leaving your person “unattended” instead of loosing a server your enjoying. 
---
I can't prove it so u probably found from eBay but I'm not saying u did but it's very possible so I don't see why u should not wipe with everyone else
---
Pls don't assume my gender I'm non binary and we exist despite what u are saying
---
It's crazy that they're looking to launch a whole new game mode before addressing the PVE end game, the  events, or the item duplication.
---
There is no balance to any weapons or armor and still thousands of dupes floating around the world.  How can they think to implement a competitive PVP system on a weak foundation like that?
---
That's a fantastic question. This post is partially meant to highlight the absurdity of the situation.
---
Yeah, I admit I wrote my comment poorly.
---
I'm not super happy that Beth's focus seems to be on pvp appeasement, but I'll let them release and decide for myself when it comes. Hoping to see more pve endgame content in the future though
---
was hoping we'd see those vaults and the Enclave stuff soon! 
---
So if I take over 180 pieces of loot on several places, I can server hop and do the whole cycle again? (with good luck it’s not looted already by other players)
---
Yup, or do season wipes. Doing it once in programming terms is just a "hack."
---
This is included in the OP.
---
NO darkzone please, that failed in Division and will fail in Fallout 76 IMHO... in Division were exactly 2 types of players those who want a "PVE Darkzone" and those who want "PVP". You can't really mix those players... for me the Darkzone was just a no-go area, but the loot was great in there for a while, so it was allways super frustrating for me to play...
---
Having a dedicated mode is the better way!
---
Pretty much the same 
---
You obviously don't understand that gear is more important than levels in this game. So as long as the duped gear is transferred from Adventure to Survival, then it's unbalanced and the economy is ruined from the start.  
---
It would have been wonderful to have a fresh start with all of the exploits fixed, but apparently that is not going to happen. 
---
Low armor pierce/penetration/anti armor is my best guess, especially with a shotgun.
---
I know with my black diamond ski sword (/w armor pierce mod) against a Scorchbeast, if I dont have Incissor 3 on I barely scratch the bugger, but with it on I take huge chunks of hp off.
---
The dense armor mod and the fireproof perk both reduce the damage of the sonic spam.
---
Robots + mutants and SB/SBQ have very high armor values.
---
Ghouls like to swarm you, so I always try to strafe in a circle around them, they spend half their time lunging and getting up so I dont get hit often.
---
T-60 is the poor mans GOD armor. Decent armor value that gets awesome with the Fix it Good perk, im almost 600 dr/er @ 200% repair. And the best part it only costs PLASTIC, STEEL AND ALUMINUM to repair! No springs/screws or harder to find junk needed.
---
I..
---
Ok ya sure. Whatever u say
---
How do you get that Order of Mysteries tag next to your username?
---
I lovvvved how the division 'divided' pvp and pve. Going into the dark zone felt like such a tense adventure. From the super strong ai enemies to the 'friend or foe' aspect of the players. And how you have to air lift your loot out made the treasure hunt more fun, honestly.
---
What is survival mode? Has there been some new info? I'll research. Hmm.
---
They will probably up weapons and armor to level 70 eventually and make all of the duped weapons obsolete.
---
I personally hope they have a better solution as I don't trade and I spent a lot of time to build my character around the quad automatic radium rifle that I got. It would piss me off if I had to grind to find another quad automatic to fit my build.
---
Not carrying over is dumb. Bethesda sees that too. 
---
Yeah I’m sure. I got the game guide even though 80% of it’s going to be obsolete inside a year
---
How many people are doing it?  How many caps have been generated?  How many people have loaded all 5 regular accounts up to 25k and started on a second account?
---
You push the fact that it's possible with the fear that everyone is doing it.  Or at least that you can't trust trading either anyone because you can't be assured they didn't.
---
Your conjecture is that it's a widespread problem.  You have no specific facts or evidence.  No one doubt that duping happens and that it's a problem.  But your lack of ability to trust is personal and not indicative of systemic issues.
---
You push the notion of 200 cap TSE miniguns like that is the norm.  It's not.  Soke may have been.  But not commonplace in the normal market where they're still going for 1.5k to 2.5k.  Why so low? Partly duping increasing supply.  Partly the upcoming fixes that will cripple them decreasing demand.  Partly the fact that other things are out performing them. less resource intensive or have more potential upside.
---
And nowhere did I declare victory.
---
I make my caps on knowledge.  Knowledge of where certain items spawn and on when to login so I can collect my 1400.  Which quests yield certain rewards.  How to effectively farm them.  The old fashioned way with hours of grinding.  I don't sell guns.  Just clothes and plans.  Made 25k in 5 hrs 2 days.  Spent 17k in an hour.  Made another 16k in 2 hrs.  Made some connections.  Got lines on people I can spend those caps with who have what I am looking for.
---
Those things you miss out on, whining about the sky falling because of duped nuka colas shaking your faith in the almighty cap.
---
that's the funniest part of the game. beats being bored.
---
Ok. figured so. People seem absolutely panicked
---
hmmm i found out about that one on like the 15th 16th which was after the patch wasn't it? Can't remember the patch date myself.
---
Player vendors and stash limits are probably not going to be touched until they get a better hold on the duping issue. Because quite frankly how is a humble player vendor suppose to compete with a TSE duping vendor.
---
I wont play the PVP mode until its made CLEAN SLATE, new characters ONLY. That means you're wasting your time developing for it Bethesda. Have fun wasting more money and time. 
---
I truly believe a lot of the complaints are from players with no multiplayer online experience and FO76 is their first outing.
---
I know for me it was but I got hooked on the style for some reason and now I play things like The Division, Titanfall, ESO, For Honour, Warframe and I have a list of games to get to in this space (Titanfall 2, Destiny 1 &amp; 2, Anthem, The Division 2, Rainbow Six Siege)
---
Anyhow if I compare the journey those games had and still have from their launch to today I see a very similar experience to FO76, only difference is I am playing FO76 from the start with all its balancing issues instead joining 3 years late like The Division where Ubisoft sorted out most of the balancing issues.
---
I think Bethesda knows the journey with its player base will be challenging and I believe they were prepared from the start that this will be a multi year endeavor for them. 
---
Death. Would be point 
---
This would be nice, but it's not as dire as you make it sound. If they let characters join both, then those who aren't ready can stay in non pvp until they get some decent gear.
---
I would prefer it be new characters only, mostly because it would be more fun to have people fight each other at lower levels and without all the greatest gear at first. 
---
They're not going to lose all aid items per death. Just some.
---
You're a different type of player then. Which is fine. 
---
Because I would stand no chance to progress as a low level when people 200+ levels / bobbleheads / TSEs / in teams will be roaming around the map killing you at every chance. Doesnt sound fair or fun. 
---
The marked plans will be nice, but it took 5 patches to make it in :\
---
Oh okay, sorry. Just the first thought I had to explain it lol. But ya, sounds like it was obsolete when it was written if this is any indication haha
---
An event timer would be massively helpful, and hopefully with some kind of way to show what percentage of time is left, and maybe shows as read if it's less than 50% of original time or something. I think I've tried the lighthouse / firefly event three times and have just never had enough left on the clock to actually finish it. I've popped in for workshop defense events that literally ended right after I fast-traveled there.
---
I'm not sure what causes this, maybe players come through, trigger the event, and then leave? For stuff like that it should cancel if the initiator leaves the zone, and start over if someone else shows up.
---
I'm advocating they make the pve more challenging in addition to the pvp changes not instead of them. 
---
I think what needs to happen to truly balance PvP. (And this is a really controversial idea) but legendary armor and weapons need to not exist at all in survival mode. 
---
“Died of dysentery. gg my dudes”
---
I respectfully don't agree with allowing this from day one. Just because it CAN become an issue doesn't mean we should just allow it to happen.
---
At least sell screws at vendor stations.
---
same, broken steel was the best for the increased level cap and new weapons and armor and perks, while mothership zeta was just the most interesting to me, it was so different than the typical fallout fare and i loved it; I know people love to sing the praises of The Pitt but i don't really get it, i didn't enjoy it at all and it just felt gloomy and tedious, same with Point Lookout really, but at least Point Lookout had the decency to include some really good weapons
---
I think Beth has found a way to determine who’s causing server crashes (a feasibly easy feat in all honesty, with debugging being a feature of all of their games), and can ban those players. Problem is, existing dupes may not fall within that peripheral, and thus one player with 10k TSE’s opening up shop would pretty much be the end of it
---
Crafting is for low level, and mods in late game.
---
"There's no way Bethseda would look at the state of the game, w all the exploits such as duping and infinite xp, as well as the constant crashes, items disappearing and horrible pvp, and sell it to everyone."
---
Pretty sure you could have said that the first few months so I really doubt they solved anything. 
---
"Toons"?
---
I think one of the terminals in the warehouse mentions it, that is how I figured it out.
---
I agree. Other multiplayer games made it work so FO76 will be able to as well. It won't be overnight though and the journey will be rocky so it will be interesting to see whether enough players stick to it and help Bethesda make it good or whether players just give up and leave never to return.
---
Oops missed that.
---
Yes I do. That's why I said the weapons need to be adjusted. PvP is a one shot kill fiesta. People will be able to obtain those weapons again, that's why they need to be fixed.
---
Make a new character in adventure mode and when it's ready for survival switch to survival? 
---
This is certainly a good point. I don't have a kid but I do have a dog and when nature calls for her I gotta take her out. I've been killed a few times due taking her outside while low on food/water. 
---
It just frustratingly breaks the game loop for me.
---
\###About mutation effect overlapping power armor
---
It is strange that the power armor made for human beings will be effective with mutation of body change.
---
Therefore, if equipped with a power armor, disable physical mutations such as marsupials, birds' bones, twisted muscles, and introduce those effects as power armor MOD.
---
As an additional MOD, I want "Jump power 60% up" for the foot part MOD.
---
Arm MOD is a power armor I want various customization such as "STR + 2" or "PER + 2" or "recoil alleviation" or "close damage 10% rise" or "reload speed 10% rise".
---
That’s a great idea too! Being able to leave notes at other camps
---
All my weapons break fast AF even when overrepaired 200%....
---
Yup lol. Just gotta be more careful everywhere like I was in fallout 4
---
I've just found a targeting hud but I'm on the PC version, I'm not going to equip it because I think the sensor array is better anyhow if anyone wants it then let me know - fo76 gamertag is 'CheezBoss', I'll accept 500 caps for it :)
---
That's a pretty interesting take. I like it, though I have a feeling they wouldn't do that ☹️
---
RuneScape.  I dunno what you kids are playing now a days lol
---
Dear Bethesda,
---
[Please completely change the game from the way you designed and explained it pre-launch because I don't like it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IDLGUO7zXk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2854)
---
Sincerely,
---
A player
---
How about we scrap the charge bit and make the suit look like a giant clown and any time you enter it a 500 foot tall wendigo spawns aggroed to you?  Then nobody will complain that the quest won't go away anymore!
---
I listened to that! I didn't think I could do it justice so I left that bit of lore out. I love the connection they were making - I strongly recommend you guys listen to it - I'll see if I can find the link to it again and edit this reply! 
---
What events do you guys like? ( we all answer ) Great here's free for all pvp, now you can lose things to exploiters instead of flawed in-game mechanics, Your welcome! ( our collective "..." ) 
---
100% agree. Also if you join a friend in survival your last used survival char gets automatically loaded into the game. Same with normal.
---
Also will they remove pvp from normal mode with pvp server? I dont like pvp bc everyone just one hits you anyway. Id like a balanced pvp fight. (Never killed a player lol) 
---
The anti pvp posts have been spammed on here sure.  But never getting much more than 300 up votes.  So if 300 people keep spamming the same feed back it's not really representing the entire community.  Pvp was a focal point in what they initially offered with this game . Game was never advertised as a 1 player solo pvp free game. 
---
I have a Stalkers Explosive Harpoon Gun with the Flechette mod. I call her Felicia cause she bad. XD
---
r/themonkeyspaw *
---
I always gave him the .223 pistol 
---
On a positive note...a good percentage of the douchebag griefers will migrate away from the current servers to compete with others of their ilk to see who has the smallest penis
---
Playing melee and haven't tried over repairing anything else yet. So I cant tell if its only this weapon of mine.
---
Thought I'd ask if anyone else has experienced something similar
---
Your about right the better thing to do woulda been to buff the other legendary perks to match it in some way but now it just feels like your lightly tapping everything to the point melee is the only real dps now. Heck a baseball bat with a rocket mod and no perks or prefixes at lvl 30 does more damage then my lever action with all3 rifle perks and and bloody mess and other buffs.
---
So about the invisible team mate, unable to accept invite, can't send team invite, and being forced to join from main menu bugs? Still no mention? Ok cool 
---
With aquaboy i take rads drinking.  But not standing in water.
---
I would like to be able to summon one of those loot drones so we can put our junk in it and it will go back to our camps and drop it off.
---
Could also be! My reasoning was the orange tie Mr. Fuzzy that reminded me of Miss Frizzle's orange hair!
---
I was wondering whether a percentage scale would work. Calculate the effective damage then scale it to the person’s available health. Let’s say a griever stacks bobble heads and effectively can one shot a person. Instead of calculating 2400/8=300 dmg (still enough to one-shot some lower players), add a hit maximum to be playerHealth/4 - or some factor like that.
---
This would play out as follows (assume player health starts at 300)
---
Shot 1 drops player health to 75% = 225
---
Shot 2 hits for 56  = 168
---
Shot 3 hits for 42 = 126
---
94, 70, 52, 39, 29, 21, 15, 11, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, Dead
---
18 shots total, if PvP is never engaged
---
This would certainly change the dynamic of engagement - AFK suddenly become targets, as do people crafting at workstations. Or wait until a player is within an inch of their life after fending off a Yao Guai. 
---
Maybe 18 shots is too much - change the formula to require 10 shots, or 4 or whatever.  Maybe the player is forced to drop whatever they’re doing and react, or they’ll be dead in a few seconds - there is still that dynamic.
---
Point being : change the formula so that the contest is engaging, challenging and exciting for all, rather than frustrating and rage-quitting for some and re-enforcing bully behavior for others.
---
I'm cool with it. Being able to dip in and dip out. Survival mode in any game, Bethesda games or not, has never been for casual players. Don't see the beef.
---
On the right hand column of this page, look for the little check box that reads: "SHOW MY FLAIR ON THIS SUBREDDIT. IT LOOKS LIKE:"
---
Click the little (EDIT) link next to the visual to spice up your life.
---
P.S. This works for all subreddits that support 'flair'.
---
Yes, I can swim all I want, and breathe underwater, but get rads dipping a bottle.
---
Not everyone shares that sentiment. There's nothing I hate more than starting the game over and unlocking everything I've unlocked.
---
&gt; People will be able to obtain those weapons again, that's why they need to be fixed.
---
Yeah, but they won't be able to dupe and distribute those weapons again.  It'd actually make TSE a rare combination instead of one of the most common legendary weapons available in the game. 
---
Go into your profile and choose add flair
---
Jetpack to the hole in the roof &amp; done.
---
Excuse you. Plenty if us enjoy the game. 
---
True, but nothing is stopping me from playing in adventure mode right?
---
The vendor at Harpers Ferry sells the plan, if the vendor don’t have it server hop till he does.
---

---
Maybe the best thing for Bethesda would be to tank there own game.
---
"It just works" wasn't as easy as Todd thought, and they've got no chance of adding perk card packs (why else we opening packs...fifa) to the store or adding in a subscription based option (like eso). 
---
There charging almost £5-6 per hair style on the store....you can get a key for about 12 bucks for the whole game which they promised DLC would be free (if they bother). Unless they are really proud of there product and work and want to have some pride in the product I cant see how they would dare to ask players for another penny / dime.
---
Wouldn't surprise me if they just wanted to walk away and forget it completely, Todd can go round telling people "It just doesn't work" then and get back to lying about whatever other product hes rushing out through the door in time for xmas sales hey.
---
\#FUTODD

Reporting bees as bugs? This made me giggle.
---
That's the idea ;) 
---
*BzzZZzzzzZZZzzzzZZZzzt*
---
Nice, safe area for easy resource collection during slack times, yup, and convenient to vendors. I had my CAMP in that area from about level 5-25.
---
Most definitely! I knew I'd be missing a bunch releasing the video this early. Best way to reach me is my Twitter @EllyTheGeek ! But I will continue to watch this post for more too!
---
The last words on the patch say, "and much much more". 
---
They probably will address a lot of this but just didnt in this posting.
---
I feel ya. I don't understand how beth can't see these really obvious issues. I get they're pitching this as a BETA program, but even then... this feels like a half assed pre-alpha.
---
Delete a character. We have too many mules as it is, it's ruining the economy by allowing those who will go through the trouble of muling (or have a friend they an rely on to transfer) to be much more picky about trading because there's no pressure to get rid of things.
---
If you made a protest sign with this on it, I would go around and kill mole rats with it.
---
It takes a fair bit of time to die from thirst.  I could fill a pool with all the purified water I’ve dumped in this game.  How hard to just stay above 75%?
---
*/in my best opera singer voice* ***MIIIIIIIISTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!***
---
PvP mode is fine, when the game is already running fine. This game is not fine. It is so far from fine it can't even see fine with a high powered telescope. And instead of fixing the base game, which affects both PvEers and PvPers, they are wasting time on PvP mode. Feels like a colossal mistake. I understand the rationale - they see PUBG and they see Fortnite making billions a year. Thing is, this game ain't Fortnite. The devs will have to spend years on this game before it is within artillery range of Fortnite. So trying to milk people for money with the PvP mode, when the game is like this, I just don't see working well at all.
---
Worse - introduction of this mode is a one-time thing. It is introduced. People either adopt it, or they drop it. It's extremely difficult to let people to try again, after they already wrote the mode off. So dropping this mode into an otherwise broken game is extremely risky, because if players don't like it, because of issues with base game, not even PvP mode itself, the mode will die. It'll be a ghost town. And once this happens, even if the game is fixed, getting people to revisit will be hard as heck.
---
So that's my $0.02 on that topic. Focus on the base game. Get the base game to work like clockwork - perks, weapon balance, itemization and procurement, crafting, events, endgame, etc. THEN start putzing around with PvP modes. Chasing that BR dollar is going to get the game killed. 
---
Swarm of Suitors rewards nothing. 
---
 Good write up.
---
Why not just be forthcoming and say you mad that people can still pvp in the normal mode as designed .
---
Your brother may have a superpower ;)
---
I'll take one too, let me know when the orders being processed ;-)
---
Oooooh yes, but it do happen, lol
---
-_-
---
100% agree, and while the tone here sounds optimistic, the post isn't entirely meant to be. It's a situation where they have a legitimate chance to solve the problem of all the duped items, it's a binary choice, and they seem to have irrationally chosen the wrong option. The only way I can square it is that they have a solution, otherwise it's difficult to find any reason to do it this way.
---
yeah, adventure mode will stay the same I hope. I was talking about the new one.
---
I’m listening. 
---
My apologies but the RNG gawd has granted me 5.  Now, that's because ive been staying at Whitespring for 40 levels worth of grinding ghouls (and not leveled enough to get many of the boss XP green-glo).  I've got two 45 shotguns (one dbl barrel) and a 35 that I gave to a friend - and the other day a nocturnal explosive minigun, for the same friend.  And an explosive laser, I have no idea what to do with it.
---
This isn’t content at all. It’s the exact same game, save for a few already existing mechanics being tweaked. 
---
My camp is between the Train Station and Blackwater Mine, and I absolutely love it. People see it when they FT to WS Station, and I have a garage with workbenches and water purifiers for people to use as they need. Not sure what it would take for me to change the location, as I absolutely love it. Incredibly strategic as well
---
I'll be honest...if this game ever leaves it's current early beta state, i'd kinda be interested in seeing a complete-relaunch. But, and this is the kicker, the game as it stands isn't worth a re-play. There's no way I'm making another character and going through everything again...because there's no point. There's no plot, no RPG elements, no alternative path to take.   
---
Just mass-ban the dupers and the people who gave those asshats money...both of which are clear violations of the TOS. 
---
Why such downvotes? 
---
Obviously people shouldn’t play survival if they don’t like the fucking mOde.
---
Ahh crap, lol.  Well, not gonna edit mine now :P
---
You have to wait for them to load before doing anything else, otherwise you have to leave trading menu and re open it. 
---
They should reset it once every 2 or 3 months imo. Model it a bit after D3 seasons.
---
There are already PVP events.  Any event with the "versus" tag is PVP.  I did one at the high school in Watoga where you try to collect candy by killing each other.  Nobody else showed up, so me and my teammate just killed each other...  We didn't even have to drop team to enable PVP.
---
You have to fight a giant scorched baby in a cave somewhere in the savage divide
---
Oh good, we've already started the "shit on Bethesda" train for this new feature. Glad to see it's still running on schedule.
---
I think its intentional, but if it's a bug it needs to be patched and that's final.
---
Will you be able to see people on the map? The notes did not say anything but I feel everyone should be hidden in a true survival mode.
---
There's beating a dead horse, and then there's selling it for use in the Donkey Show, this constant 'better post shit about this game for some quick attention' crap is the later
---
I would do it if everyone started fresh, and I must've spent over 1,000hrs in Fallout 76 so far. 
---
umm k
---
What about same characters but mode-based inventory? You first join a pvp server and your Inventory is empty. 
---
I craft weapons for ammo types I don't normally use so I can scav easy areas and craft bullets for my good stuff 
---
That's actually not a rule. 
---
do you have power armor and a decent melee weapon? if so you can probably take them if you're careful. 
---
Grognaks axe?
---
Oh trust me friend, ammosmith rank 2 and super duper rank 3 are a must have.
---
What is survival mode?
---
What is adventure mode?
---
Will there still be a lvl 5 rule? If not everyone will hang around vault 76 and pop em as soon as they walk out!
---
Faction-based pvp would certainly fit into the lore much better than FFA
---
Hey neighbor! I've been in a nearby spot for weeks. Only one or two enemies ever spawn in when I pop home. Plus some neat/ useful stuff around there. Not too many people passing through all the time either. Plus our buddy in the lake is always nice company
---
Making servers so that they don't  constantly crash should have been done first before adding a new server type.
---
Me and my friends had a discussion about everyone having amazing legendary weapons. We came up with an idea that Bethesda should just do a whole erase of all 3 and 2 star weapons, just weapons so people could keep their 3 star armor. I've earned my 2 shot explosive gatling gun and would be just fine with this.  People will probably get angry but me and my friends will try to go threw a nuke and people will come down their and one shot us when we'r trying to kill the robots. I can one shot them to but the constant back and forth of one shooting each other is rediculas. When I started my new character I had to have my friends body guard me to people don't one shot me and take my loot without out them getting shot as well. So earse all 2 and 3 star weapons would be great i think.
---
This is ridiculous
---
God you are so unbearably assuming. I don’t have to be a hoarder to have a need to craft ammo. And I can admit it’s not easy to run out of those materials, unless of course you don’t need them and dump them like I do because pack rat is 3 points of strength I can better use for melee. And 300 can do fine unless the only gun your build can do decent damage with is an automatic. 300 is fine for a hunting rifle but not for an LMG especially when most automatics take a full clip to kill one high level enemy due to being melee built. Then again maybe I could install the perk card loadout mod as well so I can swiftly change from melee to guns at a moments notice! Thanks for the idea. I’ll go download that one after I get back home 
---
Survival mode is going to be a real shit fest. Imagine starting a character on it and getting repetitively killed because the person is level 100+ with the best armor and weapons. Meanwhile you’re fresh out of the vault.
---
unlimited stims don't matter in pvp, they can't save you.
---
You and i sound like the same person. You described my character exactly.
---
Roses are red,
---
Canned dog food consumed,
---
Snaptail added,
---
4 .308 round removed
---
Its bugged i think, it doesnt always show up
---
FUCKING THANK YOU
---
PRAISE TODD
---
I would bet $1 that the leader board is going to be lvl 15s with TSE that one shot everyone.  
---
then stop it.
---
I've never duplicated. I don't want to start over. I think you're scared. I wreck kids ALL DAY. Bring whatever gun you want to the fight, and I'll one shot you regardless. I will be number 1 on my leaderboards.
---
That's more of an medieval executioner's axe. 
---
I'm talking more like the tomahawk reskined to look like steel. 
---
Plus I assume one day they will increase item lvls so I want to be able to craft a set of lvl 70 t60 ect
---
Typical shortened word for "cartoon", and just refers to your in-game character. 
---
Puny enclave? I'll kick your ass wit- nevermind my 5th carling plasma broke 
---
So basically you want a Gundam? I ain't complaining. 
---
It would be nice to have more stash space, but I’ve been occasionally pulling out 1/2 of everything (except the hard to come by stuff) and selling it or donating it to a register.   Maybe a larger, account-wide stash?
---
I wouldn't want that either, I'm a bigger fan of season wipes. But wiping it only once doesn't solve anything long term so why do it.
---
Nice selection you got there.
---
Any chance you got an instigating lvl 50 combat shotgun?
---
And whats your price on the hunters longcoat if you got one?
---
100% agree with you. The game is not heading anywhere exciting it seems. SO much potential in this game and it is being squandered with bad decision making. 
---
Reset won't benefit me.  I have to re-grind all of those levels.  I have to spend tons of hours acquiring the plans I worked my ass off to get for my existing characters.  I like my character as-is.  My setup is good how it currently is.
---
But sure, go ahead and insist on the purest hardcore mode you can get.
---
It'll share the same fate as DayZ Vanilla and H1Z1 Hardcore Servers.  Low population leading to eventual deletion of the servers.  You won't find any sympathy from the player base when they shut down those servers because they only catered to 5% of the player base anyways.
---
Griefers will grief in every game mode that allows it.  
---
&gt; The limit has also forced me to have 15 strength and every weight reduction card possible, for how I want to play.
---
Well, that is kind of the point isn't it?  it's how you want to play...there will be a give and take.  Players who want a melee build have to build their perks accordingly, as do riflemen or any other specialized playing style.  Why wouldn't players who want to hoard mats also have to specialize their builds to do so?
---
You aren't playing an MMO?
---
May I have an opinion about it though?
---
I think you are using that as a crutch , to push an unreasonable agenda . Are you a low level player getting constantly griefed ? No? 
---
I like the no lege idea
---
Mannn, have y'all ever played an MMO.. ever? We're keeping our characters.. they better not make me start over. Put way to much time making my character dominate in PvP. I've been waiting for this since launch.
---
To at least give them a shot at fixing it. Lessening the problem is still a move in the right direction.
---
Dude read their entire sentence. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
But TSE will be nerfed by then, anyway? I want to see what it's like before they decide to wipe, hopefully. Maybe things can work out with the new systems.
---
cap it at 1 damage and extend it to include that persons camp.
---
Passive mode also need to be altered so VATS will not target players and non hostile targets.
---
NO damage to non hostile robots. Cant kill any mobs of they get near a WS robot cause I hit on them and the whole Zone will aggro on you.
---
Yes indeed. Every now and again I may see a ghoul staring at my base, butbthats few and far between. It does get decent foot traffic being close to flatwoods so I leave everything unlocked for everyone.
---
I've only done this one maybe once or twice when I first started and didn't know what I was doing yet.
---
It doesnt even reward food items or anything?
---
Then they'll just wait at the Overseers camp
---
No legendaries? Are you kidding me... What's the point in playing
---
I think that is a good idea, but definitely not for the initial beta test of the new mode.
---
I like how it’s essentially the Iron Giant from Ready Player 1; It eats legendaries to fuel it for 2 minutes,
---
I server hopped for that damn plan for a good chunk of hours.
---
When i finally gave up, found myself at one of those stations selling chems (lewisburg i believe)
---
Friggin hell. The robot had the Lever Gun plans.
---
You gotta offset the desire sensor. Its the only way.
---
if you launch a new mode with a clean economy and no patch to eliminate duping it wont take long til the dupes flood that world too.
---
AFAIK, The scorchbeast that flies over the Forest area does not aggro.
---
I've seen it a few times and only flies over the area (Morgantown and The DeathClaw island)
---
" They put no effort into this."-- Basically describes the whole fallout 76 experience
---
I agree. I have 2 high level chars. I spent days farming plans/mods. If  have to do this and complete the quests again ill just stop playing. Most people wont level up and spend days again just to pvp. It will be a dead mode if they require you to create a new char. I aint sure gonna nuke whitespring and farm legendary again for days. Many new games are gonna come out soon in feb/march. I can spend my time better on thsoe games.
---
I would think so as well. Maybe if they did do that, put them on their own special servers or if they have friends, a friend can join them or they can join the friend. I like the friend going to their server option. 
---
I notice that “admit we made a mistake” was not one of the possible outcomes. 
---
The camp budget does not increase but new stuff takes up less budget based on your level.
---
I don't plan to PVP for at least 5 months because I don't want to deal with all the bugs and exploits so your solution does nothing for me.
---
That's the point of an MMORPG bro. Have you ever played ESO or WoW? It's not about being balanced like some socialist bullshit. GET GOOD
---
Must be nice. I don’t even play the game
---
Learn the meta?  For people excited about this game mode, the meta is to buy broken ass weapons from dupers with cash.  If that's what you mean, then you're a fucking moron.  This is a chance to play a survival mode, what is the point if the 'meta' involves transferring items from easy mode into hard mode?  If they wanted a TSE arena they could have made that and not called it survival mode.  And by your standards I probably do have 'bad gear' because I didn't get a lucky god tier roll or spend cash to get on the level of the meta.  I would like everyone to have to play by the same rules and start on equal footing, and not get shit on from day one because I don't have a Tse shotgun the moment I walk out of the vault.  
---
51b is the best for resisting damage, but the worst for resistin rads
---
x01 is balanced, but has a net 15points higher res than ultra
---
Ultra is balanced and has 15 points higher physical res, but is 15 points lower in both energy and rad res when compared to x01
---
Yeah, it's like Bethesda is full of Peter Molyneux types, they have wild and crazy ideas but don't having the coding nous to implement those ideas.
---
Yes, but it's not balanced well. Need some wiggle room to fit more items. 
---
Thank you! With bears, magazines, bobbleheads, etc being obvious sets of items... displays should be an option. Let me shelve my hundreds of Nuka-Colas in a bar area please.
---
The existing mod for this works great.  Hopefully the new implementation will be as good.
---
&gt;ust be forthcoming and say you mad that people can still pvp in the no
---
Cos, if that was the case that's what I'd say!
---
I'm not mad, I'm annoyed that Bethesda is ruining what could have been the greatest MMO of all time. People still play Fallen Earth because its the only Apocalyptic MMO out there (non zombie).
---
I'm going to level a new toon on the new servers from scratch, i may transfer one of my higher level ones across but me and my group gonna be rocking level 15 TSE's and smashing the shit out of everything on our noobs. 
---
Someone destroying my digital camp in a game made up of pixels has never really butt hurt me tbh. Camps in this game are pointless at the moment anyways, all they do is lag the servers up.
---
THEY BEST BE GIVING OUT NEW CHARACTER SLOTS THOUGH AS WELL WITH THIS SERVER!
---
Lol I wear a straight jacket and introduce myself as "Jerry" to other players, and then I run away and come back in a dress with a "clearly a guy trying to sound like a girl voice", or sometimes in cowboy attire with a howdy accent, or sometimes as a clown all looking for "Jerry". As I do this I don't give out much but if they ask for something I give it like one time a guy asked "Jerry" for some shotgun shells to which "jerry" provided some. Sometimes it scares players, sometimes it makes them be like "wtf", sometimes they laugh, all rewarding reactions.
---
But it does for many others.
---
I think they should fix the fucking game first, then add new shit. 
---
And the different games. :)
---
Blue head light on T-51B doesn’t even show a light source in third person, lol
---
Just a big fuck off blue cone
---
Absolutely true. But I was under the impression that duping now requires more people and is a more laborious task. Although it was supposed to have been fixed I think...
---
Don't see how this will effect anything. Sure you won't have people kicking your ass right from the start but give it a few days and it won't be any different lol. You can get to lvl 100 in a couple days easy while farming legendaries at the same time. You will be against tse lvl 100's in 2 or 3 days and it will be the exact same. Have fun getting shit on. At least they are getting a hefty nerf but you will still get rekt if you aren't willing to put in the time like others. Tough shit, but its how it will be.
---
I was hoping to have some new info about upcoming content, not just a new mode. 
---
I’m glad people that enjoy a more pure PvP focused game are going to get some love, that’s awesome! Some sort of roadmap for the rest of us would be great, though. The known plans/recipes thing is nice!
---
I REALLY enjoy the game, but without fresh content, it’s going to fade away into obscurity rather quickly. 
---
At first it might be chaotic but if they patch the dup methods then we have a chance that anyone that brings tse over will lose them because they do say you can lose aid and other items they never said it wasn’t weapons or armor.
---
You misunderstood my meaning. That last part was pointed more at the Obsidian fanboys that think they need to mention Obsidian on anything Fallout related.
---
Why go half way?
---
Have you turned off the Event in your tracker all together?  Maybe during a previous mission in the area that you wanted to remove excessive trackers from?
---
Can someone explain why this is a hot topic today specifically?  Is there some tweet or new story or patch notes I'm unaware of?
---
To be fair, it was pretty easy to get their meaning. 
---
Keep checking the Watoga venders and you will find a sold Dragon for cheap.  
---
Lol another reminder that functioning magazine racks and bobblehead stands were literally in Fallout 4 and had to be taken out at some point.
---
I've had the same issue - Can't fast travel to it. One time, it was near a place I could walk to, and as I did my screen and graphics were starting to glitch out - Not sure if it was a coincidence or related. I had some good junk, so I logged out to be safe, and when I rejoined it was on a different server without the same quest. 
---
All I see in the PVP server is folks just hiding and waiting to ambush players.  I am not a huge fan of battle royale, but the way you are creating this new "Survival" mode, allowing "Adventure" characters to play in it; then fine, just make "survival" a battle royale mode, and let people fight it out, and the last one standing gets a sweet reward to take back to adventure. 
---
Yes this 
---
The how many accounts is irrelevant. They don't need to load up on accounts. **They can print money when they see fit.**
---
I posted yesterday about how a prominent duper on youtube as of late has been telling people to stop duping entirely as they will get banned. You'd think such universally good news would be upvoted to the ceiling. but it wasn't. Last I checked it was at 70% which means 30% of people saw reason to take issue with duping no longer being safe.
---
Do the math yourself. I'm wore out doing the heavy lifting for you.
---
Reading through the comments... I can tell this group is full of casuals who are about to get smacked when this drops. I'll gladly go back to ESO if I can't transfer my gear and characters. Never duplicated. I'll still one shot ya. Get ready. I'm gonna be #1 in my lobbies
---
This is more than just a coding issue, though. I mean, don't get me wrong, there have been tons of coding problems since release. But in the big picture, this is a simply policy question. "Do we allow X?" That just takes someone who is aware enough of what it's like to be a rat in the maze.
---
This is why mods are great. In the single player fallout games the answer would be there are the pieces, build one yourself. Or check if someone already made one.
---
Hunters long coat 2.5 k  that’s a negative on the shotty
---
What about that heavy nerf on TSE's? Imo you should make weapons not drop with BOTH effects on and keep the TS damage the same. Explosive needs a nerf tho. 
---
(Im using a TSE Dragon, so i dont care about explosive nerf) TS is my favorite legendary tho. 
---
Its not about getting good - its about Fallout leftover mechanics that were designed with single player in mind.  The problem with Fallout is that you have an MMOFPS, not MMORPG, but its FPS mechanics is junk for multiplayer.
---
If you aren't willing to put in the time and effort to get spec'ed properly for pvp it won't matter if they start off at lvl 1 or lvl 200, you will lose either way.
---
Im Hoping player indications act like they are  perminantly wanted unless they are in a team, it would be amazing for immersion having to hide within buildings or use stealthboys/chameleon gear to hide from potential aggressive players.
---
Camps would totally change from being visible houses as players would try to make them as hidden as possible 
---
Yep been doing it to me for a bit 
---
I disagree.  They'll try it and comeback - griefing is not about challenging PvP, it's about ruining it for others.
---
I find a more "dangerous" style of gameplay appealing , however, Leaderboards I could have done without - it just gives incentives to mindless killing instead of a certain kind of tension every time you encounter someone.
---
If the options are 
---
A. New characters which helps many for now while fixes continue to roll out
---
B. All characters because why bother if the issues will come back/are 100% fixed
---
I'll still take A.
---
I think they rushed the new server , and that they should fix duping or alternatively start fresh on new server. I'm just getting tired of what seems to be the same 300 or so people constantly posting that they want pvp removed from the game entirely to separate servers 
---
Yeah, i'd love to see Player Faction system.  Most of these games are mindless dumb KOS fests.  See it, kill it.  It would be nice to find some randoms to team up with to take down a bunch of enemy faction players.
---
Also the Player Vendors and Stash Limit are much much more important to the player base right now than anything else.
---
I can only assume yes. Though I’ll never use the new mode unless the game bugs out, which it will, and places me into the wrong game mode, which it might.
---
There isn't a way to directly message someone on PC. The Bethesda Launcher doesn't have a friends list feature like Steam does, or a messaging system like Playstation and Xbox. Emotes aren't the "safest way", they're the ONLY way, and not everyone uses their mics, push to talk or not.
---
Play mode should be a character property, not an option when selecting "Play".  The two should never be mixed - a one-way transfer from Survival to Adventure should be an option if somebody wants to throw in the towel.
---
let me have all learned plans from my main and i'm ready for new character
---
We both know you won't lose weapons 
---
This also isn't coming out until the end of March. That's two more months of nothing.
---
Ye, Iirc it was the last thing he did before he stopped playing lol. 
---
All the way through i thought can't wait to get mods for this so they work as well.....no mods though to turn them on sucks :/
---
Bethesda not paying attention or having a Q n A department i guess :(
---
I so agree with this. Maybe if you have too much time or a hardcore Fallout player. But Ill just play other games that comes out in feb/march. I wont waste my time doing all those shit again just to pvp.
---
Griefing isn't that big a problem, but this could balance out grievances that some people do have.
---
Too little too late for me personally
---
It sounds good aswell, but Ive not played for a few weeks and have zero motivation to get back online... add to this the fact that its expected in March? I'll have completely lost interest by then unfortunately
---
If this only came earlier
---
There must be, because I can craft everything but T-60. I'm not sure where I got them.
---
I can't wait to get a Jetpack...I feel like I'm missing things on roofs.
---
But let us have all learned plans from our mains because i grinded them for 600 hrs and don't want to do it again. thanks
---
No but it seems to be this major talking point for the ppl who want to abolish pvp and have exclusively pve servers . It also never seems to be actual low level players who have experienced this so called rampant griefing.
---
Double dang. I dont think i have that much.
---
Ah well. Thank you for the quick reply!
---
Why though? everyone runs around with crafted guns? Where does that end? If you cant get the handmade or lever action plans do we start calling for them to be removed as well?
---
Who am i kidding its gonna be a melee only server anyways isn't it lmao
---
They want to make it fortnite76 instead of the amazing unique pve game it could be.
---
100% agree.
---
Check out my post above, what I put up there would be even BETTER than a fixed limit :)
---
I thought it would be cool if you could find old Silver Shroud or The Unstoppables holotapes out in the world that you could play on a tv, it would be more work but it would definitely be awesome and something cool you can do with an otherwise useless TV xD
---
Were you here at launch? The game has improved immensely since launch. Some of the bugs they nailed were 100% game breaking.
---
Ditto from yet another West Virginian who loves seeing WV locations like the capitol and Camden rendered beautifully and accurately in FO76. The one that really floored me was the Morgantown Airport. That airport is tiny (unlike Charleston's airport) and in the 5 years I lived there I only ever went there to get a car rental or dinner, but it's the spitting image of the version in the game.
---
I mainly use my own powerfist and an explosive shotgun i found in uranium fever.
---
But i also have on me a tse handmade that i bought and of clear duped origins.
---
Your own stuff feels better tho.
---
Me too... Meee too..
---
I just wanna go into some vaults man.
---
It never triggers so it is never added to my tracker. (I also do ‘t see it in my pip-boy events). 
---
That sound actually useful. You could carry half the amount of missiles and save a ton of weight. 
---
I tried it once. Finished most of it, then spent like 10 minutes waiting for the next wave which never came. Turned out there was one mirurk on the island sitting still the whole time that I thought was just another dead body &gt;:(
---
I’m so glad I wasn’t the only one collecting bears or magazines or bobble heads. This game really turns you into a hoarder. I also had a difficult time parting with my bears.
---
How about instead of dots on the map you get area circles, like the game uses for some quest objectives. The size of the circle could be related to your Perception stat -- higher stat means smaller circles. That way you still have the hide &amp; seek hunting aspect, which is a big part of the fun of PvP, but you don't have players wandering around the map and never seeing each other.
---
There we go 
---
Are you a duper?
---
Ya they should add it in already
---
The crafted guns are alot more balanced then anything legendary. 
---
Depends, if it turns out like The Division then you will have multiple groups of over powered players competing in PvP which levels the playing field again. So maybe at day 1 yes you will kill players easy but then again based on the reddit threads the amount of OP dupers out there are staggering so you may run into those dupers instead.
---
Plus FO76 could introduce the "Rogue" element like The Division with Manhunters hunting "Rogues". That could be the start of the different factions in the PvP world. So you would have OP Duped Responders with TE weapons hunting OP Duped Raiders with TE weapons. 
---
If you are a new player just run with your faction until you are OP. I mean there are more examples of this where some game publishers manage to balance the PvP element and some don't. Hopefully Bethesda manages to fall into the group that can manage that balance to keep most players content.
---
I totally agree with this
---
You can tame a Deathclaw or any other animal/creature to guard your C.A.M.P. Just be careful that you don’t accidentally attack it and have it aggro you or your friend. You need the perks though 
---
The problem with not transferring characters is that there would be no place to level up a new character after day one.  Beginning on day 2, this mode will be ruled by roving min/max'd 4 man teams.  Any new or solo character will just be cannon fodder.  Survival mode is an apt title.
---
the way it is currently written yes. Each time you hit PLAY you can decide which servers you want. You can log back and forth as needed.
---
The leaderboards will be full of cheated scores anyway. Someone with millions of points. So it will be useless to try to do headhunting to gain a leaderboard rank. 
---
I have never seen a leaderboard with no scores that are obviously done by cheating.
---
What they should do is have Co-op mode (no PvP), adventure mode (current mode), and Survival mode (only PvP), and then measure how many people actually play in each type. If some mode isn't played that much, then end support for it. If you have to start over for Survival, and make a survival only character, that's fine. I actually support that. However, without fixing the duping bugs and exoloits first, the new survival mode will become just as bad as the current adventure mode (maybe worse?) after a few months.
---
I just wanted to say I appreciate you for making a calm, reasoned post about this issue instead of the [knee-jerk](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajftuz/do_not_allow_current_characters_into_survival/) [hyperbole](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajfg2r/you_should_absolutely_not_be_able_to_transfer/) of the other two threads on the front page.
---
Only the hardcore players like you has no problem starting over. Most people wont. This mode will die faster than being killed with a tse gun.
---
Glass cannon builds dont have any thing to loose. 
---
You can do it, sneak, don't pick up the ultracite, and stay focused on your objectives (particularly at the end of the cave).
---
&gt; instead of the amazing unique pve game ~~it could be~~ **I want it to be**.
---
FTFY
---
Well they haven’t been moving so I could do 2 special price.  I’ll keep my eyes peeled for the shotty tho.
---
seems just like a plot reason on why we dont become scorched as soon as we get fart attacked. the fact that we dont get infected if we skip that quest is just suspension of disbelief i guess
---
lol, yeah.
---
Run for your life! 
---
I've seen Murgle. I had no idea it was a she lol
---
If you can get your code working in a timely manner it gives you more time to implement X though.
---
You should still be able to unlock the post office box. 
---
Nope.  I've actively written about ways to get rid of dupers from a technical standpoint.  
---
Explain?
---
What drops should I hope for if I can build every weapon in the game?
---
Oh then I know exactly where I’m going tonight
---
I legitimately lol'd.
---
Then don't get killed! You are a high level. Guess it won't be that easy to kill you.
---
YES! On several occasions I would sever hop to see if I could find it on another server and I have ended up in other locations. 
---
Ha! We’ll see about that
---
I don't need more pounds of stash space.
---
I need a weapon stash that holds 20 weapons regardless of weight
---
I need a power armor stash that holds 20 pieces/chassis regardless of weight
---
I need a regular armor stash that holds 20 armor pieces regardless of weight.
---
I've had 7 explosive legendary drops (most are not max level and none are two shot though). You're just suffering from bad luck with rng loot. 
---
right!
---
So, basically it's going to be Fallout: Rust Edition. Sure, whatever. As long as they leave "Adventure Mode" alone.
---
I don't know what I would link. It was all over this sub in early/ mid-December
---
Roses are blue, violets are red, hey look, there's a Scorchbeast...well, shit, now I'm dead.
---
good to know.
---
Prepare to be downvoted by everyone and their granny that bought all the serums to have 15 mutations, TSEs and ammo from eBay.
---
No I want the choice for people.
---
As its only 24 people per server there was never ANY reason to NOT have PVE and PVP servers from launch.Apart from lazy Dev's.  Its as simple as that, its just bad game design / choice and hasn't got any sort of thought process behind it.
---
Todd said once we'd never see a server list....and he boxed them into this crap we've got today. I've never understood whats wrong with seeing a server list before you log in. 
---
That would honestly be great. Like have a magazine rack for each magazine type or something that you can build at will
---
You will get shit on by the tryhards either way. Deal with it, thats PvP. There is two ways this will go down. Either you go in with your current character and stand half a chance against them or you start off fresh and the tryhards power farm to lvl 100 in a couple days (at most) while getting tse weapons in the process and shit all over you anyways, which keeps you from farming and leveling. Bethesda made the right choice letting current characters in. This is a good case of the player not knowing whats best for them lol. I've seen this exact same thing happen in many MMO's. Trust me, you want your current character or it will be hell.
---
I can get down with that, for sure. 
---
This is game development, B (100% fixed or even close to that) will never happen. The only way to do that is flatten all stats in PVP so everyone shoots the same base weapons for the same damage and has the same armor stats. (example: all Hunter Rifles hit the 5 damage with 10 ammo and reload speed 3 in pvp.
---
Watoga train station shares Cap's with that travelling supermutant and the shopping plaza has a Brotherhood vendorbot named pheonix. Harper's ferry has a vendor that is easy to overlook as well.
---
Ok I see now. Yes I agree, it was a chance for them to start refresh.
---
ah, just like I thought thanks
---
Is my DLC idea too over the top?
---
oh yeah, totally ;)
---
You're welcome.
---
Nothing comes from blind anger. This post is welcome to both sides of the argument. I just hope it remains this civil.
---
What’s funny too is that epic games does a fantastic job with communication, updates, patches etc and down time for patches is during the night for USA. So if they are trying to emulate them, they are failing at that too. 
---
Those are good too.
---
My point being what they picked sounds confusing, especially to new players who might join and go "oh adventure, sounds more casual" and then get upset they have to eat food to not die...
---
The problem is the people being referred to are using glitch gear that wasn't obtained through legitimate play.
---
I had stash problems, but mine were a bit easier. In my early base I had a large farm that I harvested often. Fast forward 50 levels and I'm looking through my stash to make space and I find out that I had 350 mutfruit, 200 corn, and 250 tato.
---
Sometimes you have to stand against the cry babies 
---
yeah, this is exactly what i was thinking about. but instead of driving the infected to latch on to a leaf, they seem to want to follow and help other infected (like the mirelurk following enola as soon as it lost sight of the scorchbeast). I think the scorchbeast are the only infected that arent controlled by it, so they use echolocation to command the rest around
---
We need a clan based system for sure
---
There's a perk that can actually make your damage be 0. I think it's 40% of the time. Maybe 60%. If you're below a certain level. 
---
Also several types of armor that increase your damage resistance the lower your stats. 
---
And perks like junk shield. 
---
And mutations. 
---
Okay but not all of us want to start over.   I definitely don't.  None of my friends will want to.  
---
Trying to remember but I believe I just looked it up by name. I think there's only a few anyway. Just look at all of them.
---
Note, INT above 20 does matter if you don't craft with Power Smith 3. Power Smith 3 gives you the equivalent of about 5 INT for item condition. INT 25 is the actual max required if you don't use Power Smith 3. It works very similar to hard bargain 3 and CHA, you get maximum prices at about CHA 25, or around CHA 20 with Hard Bargain.
---
You’re the kind of guy that gets the bare minimum of service from everyone they encounter and I bet you wonder why. 
---
My point. So A still allows for some measure of fairness from the getgo
---
In your opinion.
---
You are not missing anything. That was a normal workshop transaction. Chances are that you can find that players post on this sub talking about how Bethesda needs to get its shit together over it.  
---
They should remove Open World PvP from Adventure Mode.  They should leave PvP Events, Areas like Workshops, and formal duel requests.
---
Could not agree more.
---
One way transfer out only. Never back in.
---
I'm usually pretty strictly a PvE-only player, so this whole Survival mode thing doesn't really interest me much, **BUT:**
---
I would personally strongly recommend **not** implementing leaderboards, or at least being *very* careful as to how they work. I get the appeal of them, of course, but you only need to look at something like GTA Online to see how horribly they can backfire - over there, people are so concerned about having an "impressive" Kill/Death ratio that they'll go out of their way to hunt down and attack unsuspecting players just minding their own business, and yet these are the same players who will kill themselves and run away at the first sign of anyone putting up an *actual* fight, just to protect their precious numbers. And while I 'get' that the idea is to have there always be an element of risk, ideally it should try to avoid directly encouraging griefing.
---
Awh man don’t come looking for me!! 😬
---
You kind've hit the nail on the head there.
---
Given the current frequency of game crashes I wouldn't hold your breathe...
---
But many do. It may be a necessary evil everyone endures to stop something worse.
---
Thanks! I’ll look into that :)
---
Now I'm not gonna stop reading it like that.
---
Yup, that fucking thing man...
---
&gt;A “(Known)” tag will now appear next to recipes and plans you’ve already learned in Vendor and player inventories, and trade menus.
---
YEEEESSS
---
Lol I’m kidding
---
ROFLMAO
---
Balance doesn't come into with Bethesda or FO76.
---
If it did they wouldn't be adding a thing in-till they got shit working properly and fairly
---
I would have to disagree. There are plenty of us that want a fresh start full pvp no pacifism or halved damage until fired back upon server
---
I'm the one who blocks!
---
Exactly, I didn't get this game for the awesome PVP lol. They should poll their players to see who is even interested in this survival mode before spending too many resources on it.
---
For some reason I struggle with this game, and only got a decent foot hold in my 20s levels.  I have never had so much water I had to dump it though. In the beginning I couldn’t find any stimpacs but that seems to have been leveled a bit now for me. 
---
The playing field will only be level for 1 day.  After that the hardcore will have leveled up, geared up and will be in packs hunting your level 10 self.
---
Character. It’s an mmo term
---
I think they misunderstand the PvP problem.  People who want to PvP fairly already can.  The problem is the wankers who just want to fuck with other people's game.  Why would those people be drawn to survivor mode?  Unless you change the pacifist model in Adventure mode, that's where the dickheads are still going to go, to troll regular players.
---
Noun. jawn (plural jawns) (slang, chiefly Philadelphia) Something; any object, place or thing. (slang, chiefly Philadelphia) A woman.  
---
huh.
---
PvP is what this game should be. 
---
I removed it with some extra add on the second it came out... I felt bad for him (or her).
---
It should be nice if you dropped one stimpak or radaway, but nothing more. And if the other player tries to ''farm you'' killing you multiple times, you should not drop more aid items
---
Here's how bethesda should play it out. The day the PVP server comes online, the first thing that should happen when you log in is you are back in the vault, coming out of a simulator.  Nice little story as to how all of the time in FO76 to date was just a simulation based on research of whats out there, and the vault door is really opening today. Do you want to go out, or do you want to back in to the simulation and continue? Easy story line that fits right in with the lore, perfectly explains the pacifist mode, and gives you the option to always come back and play along in your previous "simulation". 
---
But, bethesda, so I expect a disaster. 
---
How just separated stashes? I really dont want yo re level but I understand not carrying over gear and weapons 
---
I hate that shit lol
---
Spot on assessment now I think about it
---
I wouldn't buy the franchise because time is cyclical and the franchise will die and a better one will come. I would go to dairy queen as well 
---
If it is listed as owned, they are still in the server. Players who are crouching don’t appear on the map. Check the server player list to the right
---
I can only base my comments on the data I have and the data I can observes. The overwhelming comments on my post and others, combined with the upvotes on these posts support my point.
---
How can not people realize this? It doesn't change anything, fresh start or not.
---
There needs to be different adjustments for it to work. 
---
people spent months building up a character to be able to use in a theoretical pvp server  
---
do you realize how annoying it would be to have to start everything over, doing poseidon 3x for generator plans, remaking excavator armor to be able to have a PA station etc.?
---
It’s common sense to seek out a ticket system when you’re experiencing issues. This shouldn’t be something new or confusing. 
---
It's true that's not the only option. But coming from someone who has, on more than one occasion, been one-shotted by a group of players, and then had my base leveled just after, and lost all the goddamn springs I just farmed from Sugar Grove - I'd be pretty pissed if they ALSO got my stimpaks!
---
&gt;You're just suffering from bad luck with rng loot.
---
I don't disagree.  Bad luck RNG is one thing, but we are talking massively duped items that should be incredibly rare.  You said yourself you have never found a TSE drop but, on PS4 at least, they are practically a currency at this point. 
---
He never tells me how he's been though.
---
hunting rifle is what I would be using at that level.   Get a shotgun for close up stuff.   
---
YES COMMIES DETECTED ELIMINATE 
---
I love how they say double cap rewards like killing people in adventure mode doesn’t already net enough caps
---
I love the idea of a one way transfer out. I truly hope they consider new toons only for Survival. The idea of a fresh playing field, no players visible on the map, and just a pure survival experience, sounds EXACTLY like what this game needs. DayZ meets Fallout. Allowing the current end game players to dive in with their gear? I'm out. 
---
In the grand scheme of things, this is not a lot of upvotes, and Reddit is only a small portion of the players.  
---
Nope. Existing characters picking on lower level newbies for non useful aid/junk/loot? 
---
Reward isn't worth the risk.
---
The risk? Is other high lvl players quickly realizing that picking off other high level characters who are picking on low levels is an easy, distracted target. 
---
Especially if the stuff the drop is expanded. 
---
if you really think "almost everyone is using duped weapons", then there is a level playing field and they can be in their containment pvp mode, while you can be in adventure mode
---
Exactly my thought as well.
---
Right? I feel like most people who hate PVP in this game are old people who can’t compete against youngins with fast reflexes and such .
---
My go to early on was the hunting rifle and shotgun (preferably combat), which I would alternate between depending on ammo availability. You're really relegated to shit guns early on.
---
How hard is it just to pre-load everything for your area BEFORE you load in/arrive? What is the point of getting us there early with unloaded content? I really don't understand this.
---
I would go to Dairy Queen but since they’re seasonal the ones near me are closed until March. I understand the thought of the franchise dying but I’d rather give it a proper burial and not let it be monetized to death. It deserves better than that. 
---
So be unfair to all or only fair to some.
---
I'll still take the some
---
No one does apart from a few worthless bits of junk.
---
They say there going to make it meaningful, but how? unless i can loot your weapons and gear how is PVP going to become meaningful just because we don't have to both hand shake (slap damage) to initiate?
---
There rushing this out because they've got nothing else to say. Last week people moaned because the ITV was vague and empty and short i.e didn't say anything. They've just done the same again but fleshed it out a little, essentially though they took 5 paragraphs to tell us about a PVP server coming without mentioning 1 single new feature added to the game (apart from these leader boards) or give any specific about the new PVP servers other than its not this patch coming up.
---
Didn't mention player vending machines or duped items being removed. Or when this new mode is even coming. we know we get a few bug fixes at the end of the month maybe but that's all we know, oh don't forget support for French keyboards or something ....(shouldn't even be mentioned its not a feature its something that should be there already).
---
Its marketing / mushroom speak
---
Because I'm very aware of the audience in this community. So I made it clear that I'm not trying to take away their favorite auto aim, I only care about PC.
---
Yes. 
---
Perhaps.. Id be very curious to see the behind the scenes calculations regarding stealth.
---
Oh and careful with those mole rats. Those things, if they see you.. Will follow you halfway thru the dang map. Relentless bastards.
---
Ahhh hahaha yes! I guess there's huge scope for developing survivor mode.  My concern is that means splitting their resources between two streams now, when we haven't exactly seen evidence of a surplus of development resources..
---
Give your level 50 duped TSE to your new level 7 survival character? 
---
So stating true facts about how the game is unbalanced is being a crybaby?  Mkay.  Because that’s totally reasonable and makes sense, right? 
---
oh I have a LOT of Leg items no problem........the problem is 99% of them are so bad they are worth less than a basic item of the same type because I can scrap the basic item for scrap and maybe mod plans. I sell or drop my extra stuff on the ground once ive gotten my daily max caps from shops. On a side note I did pick up a 2 shot harpoon gun and it hits harder than my explosive lever by a LOT
---
Sorry but tse weapons are not the biggest problem. You have a lot to learn. Proves my point. Thanks for for the name calling but u gotta get better at the game. 
---
Great advice but considering the size of this game, it would take almost a day to do this. I don't really see how that can help with server issues. 
---
Then we will need to build a "Griefer Hall of Shame" which would simply be a list of known griefers so people can reference it and block them all.
---
Do you also jerk off to Todds pictures? Maybe his face super imposed on Bethesda's ToS. You lot aren't fit for real life.
---
what
---
This mode will bring Battle Royale into Fallout someday. 
---
Correct, however it does reflect the sample size that is provided.
---
If they do it right, this is the best thing could've given us. True competition to DayZ.
---
It’s because TSE is OP,  it either effect alone is not. Two shot weapons fire two shots at different trajectories. One of the projectiles will often miss. That means a two shot weapon that is not 100% damage with both shots has the real possibility of being a 0.625 weapon. Far worse than a non legendary version. 
---
Explosive itself is not OP either. It’s powerful and should be. I use an armor piercing explosive handmade and it feels just right. Still takes a solid 8-11 rounds to take down a glowing one and more for high level super mutants. There’s really no point in having the effect if it’s going to take much more. 
---
It's not new content. It's the exact same with pacifist mode removed and some settings changed. Also for someone who doesn't like PVP like myself, I won't be using this and I will now have to wait longer for actual new content. Knowing them I will have to wait until after this PVP mode comes out to get some actual gameplay content like the vaults opening.
---
Shhhhhhhhhh don't tell everyone or they might fix it ;)
---
Exactly right. Hell every time I go to the dark zone my heart rate goes up by a few BPM and it stays there until I leave. Really intense and a massive time investment to get good gear just to stay alive.
---
There have been multiple posts about this. Do you have the targeting hud? If so remote it. 
---
The operative word is "think."
---
I think that sounds good depending on how the circles are done, because if the circle is centered on the person it acts the same
---
wrong but whatever.
---
They only place i get bare minimum service is Gaming companies like Bethesda
---
Hallelujah!
---
Never claimed it was the whole player base but think from the perspective of a casual gamer.
---
Additionally, a player already has the option to start from 0. By forcing everyone to start from zero, it creates less freedom in gaming where we already have less choice.
---
I got a Two-Shot Black Powder Rifle a few days ago. I have 2 Rifleman perks at rank 3 and the third at rank 2. It also does +10% damage while aiming (and +15% reload speed, praise the lord.) It’s base damage is 558, so combined with a Psycho and a rank 3 covert op sneak crit... 558 x 1.10 x 1.25 x 2.50= 1,918 damage.
---
Not easy to me to die to a low level (although of course it could still happen), but there are tons of people at, or above my level that will be going around IN TEAMS. Everyone WILL get killed, and each death will be super punishing with losing double the caps + aid. 
---
I would but it says data corrupted. Supposedly there should be an option to look up by PO Box number. 
---
Dense armour, stealth rifle build.
---
Had all three land around in a circle a few feet away staring straight at me but unable to see me.
---
Thanks for the easy headshots guys.
---
I just crashed when I was running to loot her.
---
Yeah, that is true. I have both so guess I gotta go with them til I can get something like a Submachine Gun or an Assault Rifle.
---
yeah, this is what I want clarification on - is it one? is it all?
---
heh, you're the first person I've seen express this sentiment (about pvp, not leaderboards)
---
May I ask, how do you feel about several months down the line being in the same server as someone who's accumulated tons of chems/perfect rolls on armor/weapons?
---
And you're primarily a solo player?
---
the only reason anyone does it, is to make a ton to scrap for plans
---
Yeah I get the two notes but I can't advance the quest or find where Wood lives
---
Eight minutes?? Are you playing on a potato?
---
&gt;do you realize how annoying it would be to have to start everything over...
---
I find it less annoying than choosing *not* to create it on a fresh server **without** an economy ruined by dupers.
---
I have a feeling this won't be a very popular mode, we will see though.
---
I wish Bethesda would actually play the game themselves as much as we do and as we do, and just realize every little thing that could be so much better with such little work 
---
So it’s you causing my camp not to place so often.
---
I built under the radio tower for its flat ground.
---
But gear evens out. And who's to say they won't find that later on and dup again?
---
On top of, a black powder rifle can one shot with a crit even without effects.
---
when you're fucking crying about them, yes.
---
Basically recreate Rust in FO76 world.  Server wipes. Fresh toons only. Depleting structures. Random resource nodes. All of it.
---
Just Rust wrapped in FO76 giftwrapping. Please! 
---
This is fallout. People have never played this game for the pvp. 90% or more of the player population wants more pve content. Thus, with the developers focusing their efforts on this pvp mode, 90% of the player population suffers because those efforts could be being focused on more pve content.
---
And if you’re playing fallout for the pvp, you’re dumb and need to play literally any other game with pvp because the pvp in this game has always been pure shit.
---
It will at least gauge interest in PvP.  I would personally also like a pure PvE mode.
---
You could also wear PA or a hazmat suit while collecting. 
---
I also don't understand the logic of when you die you can only respawn at your base or Vault 76. When someone kills me in RDR Online I want to hunt them down for the rest of the session, not respawn on the other side of the map.
---
This mode is what's going to bring me back to the game. I enjoyed the PVP myself. It was just hard to PVP because no one wanted to. I had to resort to stealing people's workshops to make them fight me lol
---
&gt; dozens of every chem under the sun including "rare" ones like fury psychotats calmex etc. (sure they drop but you can stash them and only carry a couple at a time)
---
I've been running lvl 3 travelling pharmacy since as far back as I can remember. I have so many chems lol. Lvl 3 travelling pharmacy and lvl 3 Thru Hiker and I'm still at 75lbs in Aid. I may have a drug problem...
---
No i really would prefer people had the choice of PVP AND PVE Servers, its a fact that's my opinion :)
---
Oh wait you mean the bit about 24 people per server and there beign no reason for it....well there is a reason for it, its that the game runs on a single player engine and cant handle 24 let alone a server with 5k players on like wow etc etc
---
/pathead
---
Oh srry mixed up comments. My bad
---
Sorry, that really sucks.
---
What I didn’t think they addressed, and correct me if I’m wrong, is that if one day I feel like playing adventure and the next I want to play survival can I freely switch between those? I don’t want to get locked in 
---
It’s so annoying when I set something to zero and then it goes past, so I have to cancel and restart the trade. But yes I agree
---
Does Sentinel work while crouching ?
---
Same lol. Well definitely get downvoted for our comments but it’s the truth 
---
I don't agree with that either.  r/DestinyTheGame has seen this before.   Lots of upvotes for a change.   Change is made.   Everyone who didn't want to happen gets upvoted now for it to be turned back.   Not to mention r/fallout and r/fo76 are both echo Chambers (since that's how Reddit works) and they are going to be biased.  This is not good data as it is incomplete.  
---
And that, ladies and gentlemen is a classic example of a strawman followed by a pointed declared victory
---
Have you ever been attacked by bees? You just swing at the air trying to hit something that you can't see while running for your life. I feel the current implantation is very accurate. 
---
After a day when everyone has maxed characters and gear will it really matter?
---
'' **PVP Mode is not what we want** '' says who? why do people always phrase things like this. I want nothing more in this game than a pvp mode.
---
Isn’t pvp about skill? I don’t think pvp should have legendaries at this tome die to duping. That evens the playing field
---
And the fact that is was an optional (altho more lucrative) means of gearing up and fighting baddies.. Made it so you could tackle that on your own terms. 
---
Oh and the multiple entrances and exits? A lack of any real in depth map. The isolation aspect was just perfect.
---
Then when you find a dude fending off a bunch of baddies.. You throw a medkit over to him, hunker down and provide cover fire. Throw a salute or a wave.
---
Such a cool moment!!!
---
The black powder rifle is already strong on it's own. And the double barrel close up with a crit can end people quick, too.
---
I don't think you realize how hard some of these weapons hit even without effects.
---
Agreed. New characters only, and honestly: no legendaries in survival. Will make for an actually fun pvp game. 
---
For once I agree with someone on this sub. Please I hope they see this. 
---
I'm not being a smart ass, I'm genuinely curious about your answer...what do you do in the game that would require having 600+ pounds of stash at all times?  My stash stays around 450 to 500 or so and I've never felt a real materials crunch.  Well, except when building my Excavator PA.  That was a bit of a pain.
---
Even if you have to start over there will just be high levels again in a few months. A better way to deal is just make it more difficult to find other players and have a decent bounty system
---
What? I'm not trying to harp on you for a fucking *maximum-over hard mode*. I'm just saying, if you are casual, you're going to be put up against people you will have absolutely no chance killing, and they will kill you constantly.
---
There's nothing stopping, again, a level 250 with bloodied/TSE minmaxed gear, bringing a bunch of dupes from adventure mode to survival, and killing anyone casual. New character requirements would completely shut that out the gate. 
---
What is this?
---
BTH would better create for survival mode once every time span, a new universe like they do in OGame.  http://wiki.ogame.org/index.php/Guide:Universe_guide
---
Adventure mode should be levelling up and discover all of Appalachia.
---
My friend and I use monster mash to help level alts. Build the low level a quick firing pipe 38 weapon, have them stand up on one of the planters in the foyer then the other leads all yhe ghouls there for the lowbie to tag. Similar to Whitesprings but less crowded.
---
NTA
---
Supposedly if your crouched you dont show up on the map.
---
Your like 95% Okay, a ton of people especially newbies think that slap damage will protect them and allow them to run away from a claimed workshop if someone attempts to take it, it wont its full damage from the time they pay the caps to claim your workshop, until one of you dies.
---
The only 5% I think you did wrong was take it from a level that would not be able to compete with you, but you also did not know his lvl til AFTER you capped. That said if you have other workshops claimed on the map I dont expect you to server hop. The only reason I say this is because it was probably a large investment for a lower lvl player compared and for you it was pocket change.
---
You didnt abuse the mechanic to have your friend kill him/take the workshop, he opened fire first, and hopefully you didnt take ALL of their junk, so all said and done I think your good, you just cost them some time and salty tears, but im sure most of us have been in their shoes a time or three.
---
I have it happen @Charleston landfill all the time, people just gotta get that junk, ya know.
---
I love it! I play with my hubs too but he is level 25 and im level 63 lol. He looks cute running around in his T-45 power armor set though hehe
---
Are there going to be designated Survival Mode servers?
---
Yup, any vertical or downwards movement isnt considered "moving"
---
I wish I could say I don't poo my pants every time one comes around. Especially the time  I turned to see a vengeful creeping on me up in a tree at 3am. I had to take a time out.
---
Inventory should not transfer. 
---
I may not understand what's going on here with this new mode, but if I log into play and my toon has been reset, I'm done with this game. 
---
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
---
Upvote this 
---
Fair enough
---
Speak for yourself bud I've wanted an open pvp mode since day one.
---
Dayz was so 10 years ago but no even with this they've messed it up.
---
PVP or PVE servers from the start would have been good, then we could have been getting a decent DLC in march but nope now we get PVP servers .....we wait another 3-4 months for actual new quests or vaults opening after that now?
---
That is for **how long an event has left for you to fast travel to it**
---
Not &gt;how long **until and event starts**
---
Honey honey honey. That guy is a monster. Please don't go out with men like that. He will only hurt you in the end.
---
There is no strawman in that lol. Go look it up.
---
I think he's referring to the inside the vault post about how bgs is reworking the PvP system. Nothing definitive yet either. There just making changes to it.
---
Referring to the new survival mode with much less PvP restrictions. 
---
Let's be honest - Making a new character will only "level the playing field" for a few days. People who want to grind and have time to grind will dominate others and be far ahead.
---
A level playing field might be more achievable by allowing casual players to use the character they have been working on to "keep up" rather than having to start all over.
---
If you are beckoning for a new character requirement, please keep in mind not everyone has as much time to spend gaming as you
---
Its for a separate mode. Your toon would be on the original mode but to get to the new Survival Mode with unrestricted PvP you woukd need to make a seperate character.
---
It would be nice for people who enjoy your playstyle if they made an "offline" mode without achievements where you could play with like 1-6 of your friends privately.
---
We're back to bitching about the atom shop again? Jesus christ...
---
I don't get why you single put console users whatsoever!? It makes no sense, that's is what I'm trying to state. It bares no significance on the point you're attempting to make.
---
 I'm a console user who doesn't use vats, I'm sure the general consensus is the same. If it was aimed at Bethesda maybe make it a bit more user friendly instead of paltry insults. 
---
Why would I care if someone has better loot than myself?
---
If he isn't rewarded to hunt me down over and over because of a stupid scoreboard, I guess he has no reason to use that equipment against me.
---
Of course he could be an annoying idiot that just wants to get on my nerves, but that's exactly what I tried to explain.
---
Not everyone is an ass, maybe this guy with all that fency shit decides to talk to you and gift you some supplies like ammo, food etc. while having a short talk.
---
But such things won't happen if they reward you for killing every player that walks by.
---
Survival mode?? God, this fuckin game is tedious enough. 
---
I would like this.  I recently switched from dropping free stuff to trading for free (to avoid disappearing bags). Can't tell you how many times I jumped the bar.
---
Upcountry for more visibility. Bethesda should absolutely **NOT** allow adventure mode characters in and **NOT** allow item transfers in. 100% clean slate so it's 100% fair to **EVERYONE**. 
---
Adorable! Hahaha
---
Grinding is fine. Cheating ain’t 
---
No?
---
Right, I seriously can’t believe that Beth claims to “listen to the community” and now they’re implementing a survival mode of all things! Garbage.
---
More endgame content soon would be great. 
---
I always took the giant teddy you can find driving the bus near the marina tours and put him in Shaun's crib
---
&gt;Do crafted weapons/armor and Power Armor have higher stats and durability than usual?
---
Higher durability, yes. Higher stats, don't think so.
---
&gt;Do Intelligence Levels and buffs effect crafting?
---
Only so far as to effect your durability, and the mods you can craft on them. IE Science perks have INT requirements, to craft higher-tier gear.
---
Same. It sucks having to restart the moving cap thing. Especially on consoles 
---
I've bought several at Live Chic because I kept accidently scrapping them. 
---
I did it my first poseidon run and finished with seconds on the clock. My second try it got bugged, but I honestly spent about half the time just trying to find my way around and could not get back to the reactor room 
---
That's awesome!  I haven't been to the Motown Airport but I'm pretty impressed so far with the places and how well they did with representing them!
---
Oh that just means its time to milk it. 
---
I think just removing Legendary loot from Survival would pretty much do it, then it's down to build, skill, and your loadout. Someone can have this awesome sniper rifle but if I stimpack fast enough after they shoot me i can make that rush with my pump shotty to the face, even if they're 10 Lvls higher than you there's always a decent chance you can come out on top if you've got the build and experience.
---
It's a brainfart. I can't think of any other way to put it. Someone at Bethesda, or some group of people, thought the concepts of 'competitive' and 'transferable characters between modes' were complimentary. xD
---
I just don't know what they're thinking, it's really that short-sighted and stupid. hehe.
---
For sure, the circle would have to be randomly placed around the character somehow instead of centered on them.
---
With such a large map I think you either need something like this or some points of attraction to draw people together. Otherwise you're just never going to have enough people bumping into each other to make for interesting combat. It would be like playing PUBG without the collapsing barrier.
---
Yes, but there is a min level on black powder weapons
---
I'm only upvoting because you're probably right.
---
Your missing the point really are.
---
I'm going to playing PVP, ew character and old ones. Got some low level legendary s waiting for them for me and my group.
---
If they had put PVP and PVE servers in from the start you know this first content would  be new quests or areas or vaults opening yes? But now its exactly the same game cut and paste but with no slap damage. Comes out in march if we lucky....then what we wait another 3-5 months for actual content?
---
Keep blowing Bethesda though it really does help :/
---
I get that just trying to find out if its an attempt to pass on information or get free therapy.
---
Mutants in FO76 shouldn't even be from the original Fallout's FEV experiments.  The original Mutants were FEV dipper by the Master from the Mariposa strain; East Coast mutants from FO3 on were from Institute experimentation along the same lines, with some significant differences (sterility/eventually returning virility vs barbie doll is a big one)
---
What Platform?
---
Ready you're clicking fingers on the downvote, but I'm gonna say it. This game has no reason to be getting a survival PVP mode. If you don't have a one shot build, you don't matter. The entire survival system will be a huge waste of time even after the TSE nerfs because you can rifle one shot, melee one shot, etc. It's not even a skill challenge after the nerfs, because vats crits do more damage anyway.
---
The screaming has demanded things that the game doesn't need, and now we're not getting new content. Look at the pathetic list of patch notes coming our way, and wonder how much of their resources are going into the new and improved "you died in one shot anyway" mode. What a waste.
---
A bad PVP system won't be fixed by more PVP.
---
Same.
---
Hahaha, brilliant.
---
That's as far as I got with the message.
---
But would the circle randomize every time you open the map or what
---
&gt;Bathrobe definitely sounds like a luxury item in the Wastelands.
---
The bathrobe outfit also includes fuzzy slippers. 
---
The fact that you can drop your aid items is even being considered makes it a big no go. I don't need to get whopped by some guy with a Super Sledge while I'm in my pip boy only to lose my stims. Fuck that.
---
The fuck you mean? Either TSE or bloodied melee.
---
Better at the game? Yea all the skill of tanking with PA to press Q and left click, or even the skill of two-three shotting someone that doesn't run dense or fireproof. 
---
Don't forget the skill of not moving so sentinal and assassin armor negates all damage, maximum high skill to not touch my keyboard~! 
---
If you seriously think you're a hotshot because you can use this games busted ass pvp you gotta sit the fuck down bro LOL. 
---
I guess, I personally have a few weapons, all outfits that I've used which weigh next to nothing, a lot in my aid section like purified water, a ton of bobbleheadds and magazines, and I scrap all my junk and store it. I don't store ammo except for a few backup fusion cores and some missiles. I'm currently at less than 400 and rarely ever get close. 
---
No down vote here. I hear ya loud and clear. There's next to no pvp, currently, besides stealing workshops, or the one or two grieves rumbling around the map. Definitely need more, lol. 
---
This. And they are going to have a hard time in pvp so they’ll just come back where it’s easier to be a douche. 
---
They coulda just left the standard mode as pvp with a few tweaks here n there and made a passive server. 
---
Yes! More stash space it a MUST. Mine is constantly almost full, I try to keep like 20-50 empty room in both my stash and my inventory but it gets filled up quick. I feel like being able to display stuff in our camp would help with the lack of storage space, but then we would need more budget for our camps, which is something I want just as badly.
---
Imo that is a good thing to keep immersion.
---
There is nothing more annoying as constantly respawning in an open world right next to the one that killed you.
---
Yea, not the biggest fan of that either. Maybe if it was a set amount like "lose 3 random aid items" or something so its not a complete wipe
---
Agree with everything you said. Also, not a fan of the fact that they can hardly manage the game they currently have, yet want to make another version of it. A beta within a game that hardly works, fucking christ. Can't wait until March (I guess it's good they're so incompetent it'll take them two months for this shit) when the dev team is divided between two modes. About to be out of hope for this game.
---
I feel like you were joking when you asked for the deflector shield.
---
Well, the Question is, why are you both still here?. The Survival Mode will be a separate Mode (as they said in the News from the Vault).
---
Just go away if you don't like the Game or is your Life that worthless that you have nothing else to do?
---
I googled it. I have never seen that. I’ve also never used the bridge so there’s probably why
---
First of all wtf this is a video game 
---
No.   Is that a thing?
---
Are you on PC? That gate was for consoles, but they left it in the PC version too.
---
&gt;Think from the perspective of a casual gamer.
---
I am a casual gamer. *The ONLY WAY I would play on a hardcore ruleset server would be with forced restart.* Otherwise all the hardcore gamers that already have complete build with multiple BiS weapons will shit on me repeatedly. This seems like a very simple concept, and I honestly can't think of a single game that opened separate hardcore ruleset servers that *didn't* force restarts to play on them.
---
&gt;By forcing everyone to start from zero, it creates less freedom in gaming where we already have less choice.
---
Sometimes less freedom is good for the health of the game.
---
Hopefully there will be an in game report player mechanism and harsh penalties for griefers on the non PvP servers.
---
Why was it even changed...
---
I’m going **DOWN** the slider because I want zero, not fucking up.
---
Jesus christ...
---
Guess I don’t need the mod for marking known plans that came out a few weeks ago anymore. 
---
Xbox One, edited post to reflect.
---
Booooooo. The same thing happened to my buddy &amp; I last night too. Super lame when that happens 😒
---
Wishful thinking but if you think greifers will move to a system where they can get ganked, I got a bridge to sell ya.
---
It won't matter anyway. One shot builds don't need a tse to work. 1000 damage and armor penetration isn't hard.
---
I know, right? How can we call this an mmo without fishing?
---
Better make it no PvP until level 5, maybe after that it has to be mutually agreed upon.
---
They already know about this when its not only my shotgun. I'd like to know more about it, how did this happen? 
---
And vice versa  lol
---
I actually got one once on my second try, I accidentally hit the button again and it picked up the pie. That was my second piece, I have photos with the two empty machines.
---
100% agree. No character transfer. Let everyone start over with a clean slate. 
---
Servers are still crashing pretty bad on PS4 even after they fixed the exploits that were known to crash the servers in January's latest patch. There are times, the second I load into the game, I immediately crash out again. Usually after that, I get stuck in an endless searching for world loop. This happens until I either get an error message about "this account is not authorized" or I close the glame and restart my PS4. Then maybe I'll get a stable world/server for a few more minutes then it starts all over again.  This happens like every other day. Some days the servers are completely stable and then the next, it's a total shitstorm again. 
---
Scaling exists.  
---
Perhaps the compromise solution would be to have an option to choose if you want to play with your Adventure character or create a new character - strictly for PvP (and these two types of characters should play on different types of PvP servers).
---
Also it would be OK if we have to create a new character for playing PvP but this totally new character will have an opportunity to freely play on Adventure servers too.
---
As for me I don't like games which forces to have different characters for PvP and PvE and I will be so sad if Bethesda choose this way.
---
Don't think it was intended, since it only jumps for me when its in the speedy mode.
---
A “No legendary weapons in survival” rule might actually make me want to play it. That sounds fun and challenging.
---
Still take rads though
---
If the past few months have shown us anything, it's how much Bethesda cares and listens to us. /s
---
I was looking at a two shot bp pistol I got a few weeks ago, just noticed it’s tse! You can murder fuck anything with it. My character I leveled to use pistols is level 47 and it does 800+ dmg per shot. 
---
Nahh i usually only have 1 shop going at a time...No need to hog em all :)
---
And I tried to talk to the guy but guess he had chat off.   I feel for lower players and thats why I dont want to be "that guy" who picks on the lowers.  Most of the time i drop stuff off for them if I'm not using something.
---
I think "some" of the people whining about "cheaters" falls under them not realizing how things work.
---
Jawn is used to describe anything in philly. 
---
Factions. Pick a faction from the start and you spawn at their start location (safe zone). Safety in numbers, but if you wander off the beaten path alone....  
---
Could of had fortress battles, claim workshops as a faction and have epic battles....Claim territories (mines, resources, power plants) that offer faction wide benefits. 
---
This PvP is just going to be a gankfest. Doesn't seem like they put any thought into it at all.
---
Explosive is being nerfed in the next patch along with TS.
---
but allow us to save known plans from our mains
---
Knowing this game it probably managed to get to -1 health somehow and now has infinite health :D
---
Sounds like you're talking about the movie theater that has **GUZZO (Go Big SCREEN or GO HOME)** then you have **Pacific Rim** by Guillermo del Toro.
---
Not only should they start fresh, but the ideas they have for this sounds totally stupid. Drop aid? Spawn at camp only? So... you PvP for about 5 seconds, lose all healing items, and reset across the map? Unless I misread, yeah that sounds so much fun! Damn it. Why are they even focusing on PvP before more PvE? I already quit playing, won’t come back for this. Enjoy my money BSG - you won’t get any more of it.
---
I mean I can happily start bitching if you’d like. It’s only a penny for my thoughts though, but this one of a kind “Limited time only” Mr. and Mrs. Claus digital outfits are a one time only payment of $30, but just because we like you so much we’ll cut this amazing deal down to a one time payment of $20! Hurry though! Once it’s gone it’s gone for good!
---
While I agree there's got to be some limit. It's a pain but time spent on inventory management does reduce time spent by hoarders and legendary farmers on killing lower level players.
---
I don't think there's a perfect solution, but we 600/600 need to recognise that Bethesda needs to cater to other players too. :)
---
The sandman highers the sneak exponantial. Look at the top left corner when you do a sneak attack
---
I read the News from the Vault and they said there that it would be a "Separate Mode" so I guess this means that they will not use the Chars from the Adventure Mode.
---
Another cool Thing to have would be a Lobby system that is based on the Character level or at least a Specific Range (1 to 15, 15 to 25, 25 to 35 etc)
---
Probably therapy. There's really no definitive answer on how PvP is changing yet.
---
Level locks would just encourage smurfing. Level 45 - 50 strict pvp with rare exp gains
---
yes! that's what i'm talking about!
---
What's survival mode 
---
boohoohoo???
---
Agree with all of this, it was going to be *interesting* with new characters. With our preloaded god-roll weapons? Yeah it's pretty pointless
---
there are still probably around just underground 
---
I wish the scrapper perk worked for this like it did in Fallout 4. 
---
No vice versa!!!
---
Get off my lawn!
---
Man I really hope Bethesda shows some sense and comes through on this.
---
I know. Thats why i said TSE not only TS. 
---
I want a giant giddyup buttercup power armor horse. 
---
Might as well keep this going....Level 137, definitely not fun. However, last night the game for some odd reason glitched on me where I received no damage from any of the scorchbeasts attacks. My body armor on the other hand was damaged to all hell. 
---
Is that confirmed? And is there a cap on that? I got to a point where it seemed like I needed 3 levels to put a powered door wall up
---
I’m not lol
---
I’m literally watching YouTube videos and it reminds me of this game so I pop in and look at that... Bethesda done fucked up again lol
---
Without any sort of incentive for cooperation, every encounter will almost always be just shoot-on-sight, imo. 
---
Hope you all enjoy that, but I'll opt out; that's not for me.
---
Console users would be much thankful of mods xD
---
Don’t worry they will put peaceable camp junk in the atom shop eventually :3
---
I would of underlined the last entry there.
---
I do understand the risks of this. Please don't comment for me. If that happens then it will be something the community will meed to deal with. But do not presume you know my thoughts.
---
Just a launch screen.  Consoles have different guis naturally.  On the PC it is redundant.
---
Basically lol, average around 30 fps 😂
---
Then watch each other stream it and use discord. What you described is FO4 non-survival mode. Weightless ammo and no hunger or thirst..not really a survival game at that point.
---
No thanks Jeff
---
Dont ban them just dont let us carry our other players over. 
---
We all leave the vault and start from scratch the first time we go into survival mode is the solution.  
---
No, new characters don't matter in the least. The system is fundamentally broken. Grind levels till you can one shot prior, and it's a rush to vats each other. No game play, just first shot.
---
Then the number has gotten smaller and that makes them easier to track
---
Honestly the whole point of no micro transactions is more about how when I was a kid I could go buy a PS1 and a copy of Resident Evil 2 and I knew that I got the whole game. If it was fun then it was. There wasn’t some political agenda behind it and it wasn’t going to be built upon the premise of getting more money out of me for as long as possible
---
That’s what camp limit is for. Just make the items take up budget.
---
People have put so much hours into this game and have been waiting for this for a while now. They can’t just do that.
---
Quality of life patch #783 
---
Currently on : #29
---
&gt; yeah mate 
---
Read a bit about the locked vaults?
---
This would be a proper into the vault worth waiting for!
---
Can't imagine it coming next week though :(
---
Ongoing development needs to go hand in hand with fixes and bugs. 
---
Don't be padding out ITV's with bug fixes. Thats stuff we expect and that you should be doing. Nothing to get excited about and nothing worth a pat on the back (ok fixing duping maybe).
---
Yeah, same
---
But it’s unpredictable
---
Sometimes it’ll flick over from &lt;10 caps
---
Sometimes it’ll slooowly slide down from 50 caps
---
Do they view this reddit? Someone needs to be sure they see this.
---
Thing is, this was never advertised as a PvE oriented game.
---
Well, in honesty, except for the hunting rifle i learned all my mods just from finding regulair weapons in the wild.
---
And for a lot of mods you can also just buy plans at vendors.
---
But i did find an explosive weapon (several actually) which basically rendered all craftable weapons underpowered.
---
And even nerfed explosive (never mind tse) remain the best.
---
In short i think it was a mistake to give legendaries better dmg, just reduced weight or faster reload wouldve been ‘nice to have’ but not making crafting totally obsolete.
---
I'm in the full pvp no passive mode camp tho
---
In fallout 4 I believe you had a food and water bar and maybe only one life. Not sure though never played it.
---
Hopefully those that do want PVP will make use of the new survival mode, but I fear griefers will stay behind in Adventure mode. More fun for them to try to kill people that don't want to PVP than go after people that want to fight.
---
You can make servers with a max level gap between players I assume. 
---
Yeah no, if the dupe exploits are fixed then they wouldn't be able to dupe on the new server and we wouldn't have 1000 copies of every TSE gun. 
---
I've only ever had that happen to me at the one that spawns outside of the "Steak House" full of Super Mutants. It happened twice at that location. 
---
The others that spawn in the bog are fine. 
---
Hopefully removal. 
---
And yes, you have a bugged as heck mutations.  
---
I can do both of those and the following:
---
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/212733438862688257/537493133060079636/unknown.png
---
kinda ironic considering the state of the game though :(
---
Yeah but we're talking about the new survival mode update on FO76
---
For poseidon I'll add:
---
- get to the security desk and print those credentials. This will get you past most of the blast doors, and you can re-use them if you repeat the event
---
- cancel the lock down while you are there, which opens all of the blast doors, including at least one I don't think you can open manually and is an easy way into the reactor room
---
Hey baby, you just jelly I found't me a man.
---
Yes to both questions. I've tested this myself with 9 base INT and after having 4 unyielding boost INT to 21. 
---
What's the motivation to hunt other players? I have all the caps and "Aids" I need. I'm so confused. I play COD for PvP... Not Fallout. 
---
Oh. Didn’t know that was a thing.
---
i mean . you could try it . see if you get banned. we need more data anyways 
---
I totally agree. There is SO much that needs to be fixed and added to the existing game mode before they make a whole other one.
---
I’m used to this from another MMO I used to play, in that, on death you dropped your whole inventory and you had to work against a timer to get back to your ‘grave’ in order to get it all back. If you died again before you reached your ‘grave’ it was just hard luck because you lost everything. 
---
I, possibly everyone on here as well, have an issue when shooting the scorchbeast while its flying. Sometimes the beast takes damage, sometimes it doesn't (even if I know I hit him dead on) Would your method cripple it even if it didn't take any damage? If so, I am hopping on your cripple train.
---
Well, best of luck to you then. Hope we meet again lol.
---
&gt;After 76 I can only imagine the franchise is worth a few hundred million.  
---
According to Money Inc. the estimated value is actually only $45 million.  
---
Your right, Fallout has never in its history been thought of as a PvE game series so it was naive of me and anyone to come into this Fallout game under the impression of it being mildly PvE orientated...
---
What is the plan for users who are stacking bobble heads. i have seen a lot of players who are using 100's if not 1000's  to 1 shot everything. including sentinel assassin armor built players. is there going to be a limit put in place to prevent a user from using a ton at once?
---
It's a half-cocked idea. I see what you're saying, and in a sense yes it will be convenient for some players to switch between modes. But that convenience is largely going to consist of going to Adventure Mode to farm, and going to Survival Mode to fight, with no chance to actually earn your stripes in a hostile world.
---
In other words, this isn't really a mode or a server at all. It's not much different than a battleground in WoW. 
---
Instead, this mode should be new character only. You should be able to take pride in surviving the SURVIVAL MODE. You should have to earn your items instead of walking into it with some stupidly high level toon with all the OP weapons and advantages of the early launch period bugs and exploits.
---
In summary: There is zero integrity to this mode as currently outlined, and frankly, it's sad to think that they plan to spend MONTHS developing such a petty thing when so much more could be accomplished with that time and those resources. :/
---
And if they do implement the already much-requested change to remove x-server transfer, and you still want the choice between relaxing session and hard competition, just make a character for each server. It's that simple. ;)
---
Probably a female who doesn't want the juvenile antics of gamer-boys.
---
You as well
---
I feel I see more people that want a full PVE/RP mode than a new PVP mode. I don't get why they focus on a new pvp mode right now.
---
There are a few areas in the the mid-level areas that attract higher level players because of some unique attractions.
---
Top of the World seems to spawn a lot of Mobs, has several plans and recipes laying around, and often can have quick easy to grab junk.
---
Whitespring has the Bunker, and an insanely high spawn rate during Nukes.
---
I'm a solo, and I went through both in my 20's though would occasionally get roasted by critters much higher level than me. My approach was: The penalty for dying is pretty low, so just avoid bringing a lot of junk in with you so you've got little to lose if it does happen.
---
I used to keep my camp near the top, but moved once my levels got higher so I wouldn't trigger that overwhelm on people. I still go to both occasionally while shopping.
---
There was an Inside the Vault article today. Pvp always enabled, no slap damage, can only respawn at vault 76 or your camp, you also lose aid items when you die
---
Survival mode will also require very very careful watching. They need to correct the latest exploit currently and then dish harsh punishments to anyone that tries when it comes to pure pvp. Well regardless but it will have a even larger effect on this mode.
---
Wow... I’m sure if I offered $300 million Bethesda would still try to ask for more
---
I've heard that suggestion before but for me I don't find melee as enjoyable as others do. To ensure this never happens again I switched to the Gauss which has the cheapest ammo and dropped points in Ammosmith. This way I take less of a hit if the server crashes again. Fortunately I'm actually enjoying the Gauss so it's a win win.
---
That's fine though you can be in a PVP camp and still get new content.
---
If they had offered PVP OR PVE servers at the start you wouldn't need to start over on the new servers (look at the complaints already they wont allow old characters on the new one they'll change that) you would have been playing on them already wouldn't you?
---
Thank the lawd!
---
Yea I am kind of confused at their focus on PVP.
---
Whatever. Guess I will wait another 6 months and check back. Maybe the game will actually have an enjoyable, friendly, pve experience.
---
This
---
People duped chems/caps(Nuka) too so letting them carry over their unlimited supply mules to the "new" game Mode is just not appealing to me in the least but I hope some people enjoy it. 
---
Hella nice, i knew it has to be modelled from a real place. They really captured the scenery well, albeit the robots that work there :D
---
Can agree. Been playing Fallout since the beginning, and the Player Trading is so fucking obtuse.
---
The caps thing is what gets me... Lose double caps?  So, after 75ish everyone is pretty much the same... but a 150 fighting a lvl 75... if they kill each other an equal number of times, the 150 loses more caps.  Cap loss from pvp should be capped... at say 100?
---
Set it 10,000
---
I think this would be a great compromise for making new characters for survival.
---
great, thanks
---
Personally, I'm stoked on the new PvP mode! 
---
I'm not a grieffer, nor am I getting griefed due to my beefcake arsenal &amp; armor, but being in end game, I'm looking forward to a new kind experience 😎
---
No, I'm the opposite. ;-) Just raising the stakes, and of course there would have to be some mechanism and rules to it. But bringing a TSE gun to a knife fight should put you at risk of losing that. 
---
Aid items, on the other hand, are my carefully curated tools to keep me in the game: magazines for 10 extra carry weight, drugs for tight fights, water? Plus, aid items are my stock vendor merchandise since I can't lose them when I fall into a fissure site (like I disturbingly often manage to), and I'd prefer for it to stay that way.
---
I do a lot of crafting. I need hundreds of junk scraps for it. At the same time I'd like to keep items like Bunker Buster, perfect storm, pyrolator etc... I had to dump pretty much every named item in the game because of weight. 
---
Someone link me these news!?
---
A high speed, shredder minigun with high strength and bashing damage buffs would beg to differ. I carry two Anti-Armor and one Furious to handle low and high armor enemies and extend playtime between repair runs. 
---
Supposedly already happening, never going to happen, and most likely not going to happen, in that order
---
Youre not wrong. 
---
In fo4 i did 3 playthroughs. Good and evil. And the 3rd was using zero legendaries. 
---
That 3rd run was arguably the most interesting because i had to constantly change up between weapons mines and grenades. Which is something that legendary items tend to make us ignore. 
---
Back in the old days... the only legendary was tthe alien blaster for a few rounds before it was rendered useless. 
---
But.. an old man can dream...
---
This is a good idea
---
That and some shared stash space would be 2 very big additions in my opinion! 
---
Not big on building CAMP's myself but the budget on them should be upped a bit as well for the holy trinity of quick everyone's happy fixes!
---
Who knew that most of the merchandise from video game companies was overpriced?
---
I don't know how belching, chewing, and farting would go into terminal text. 
---
I agree with this. Since I'm barely discovering new locations myself and more than half the quests aren't even done yet. I've seen alot of players at 200+. Game is only been out like 3 months. That's some grinding right there. I guess it's too easy. Everyone running around one-shotting anything that moves I have to carry around a sniper to get my shots in quick to get that XP with them lol. 
---
Cost effective? Not to my knowledge. They all cost lead, steel, and gunpowder to make so start collecting those right away. *You can never have to much* ammo for an automatic weapon in fallout. 
---
Yeah, if you could craft the best gear, what would the reward of doing the content be at end game?
---
If that bear ate an adventurer guns and all, he could have springs and screws in his belly... It's just too bad that it takes a bear stomach to get those screws and springs back from the guns he's eating.
---
(I agree. We need to be able to get a small amount of springs, gears, and screws from weapons and power armor scrapping... It would make a nice upgraded perk.)
---
Yea doubtful it'll happen, and honestly it's not like I expect all of these things. Just some ideas for what I \~think\~ most people want to see discussed in some detail... even seeing one or two each vault for the next month would be awesome. :D
---
Just grab a cheap jacket (prob better quality than that crap) and get it printed yourself is the best bet in this day and age. Nothing they can do about it if its just for yourself.
---
Faction vs faction would be the only way  I would even bother with PVP in this game. I am guessing the current survival mode was just the easiest to implement and hopefully factions are still being worked.
---
Yeah. I have no desire to go to Survival, but even in theory using existing characters sounds like a bad idea.
---
The strawman is the substitution of printing money for the printing money and stockpiling of money.
---
You chose to cherry pick one item there and conflate it with the actuall point.  That's a valid strawman. 
---
The influence of the ability to print money on demand is contained by the ability to store it and spend it.  The average gamer isn't loading up cap mules on their 5 accounts or moving on to alts to load up again.  So then idea of millions and millions of caps being generated is plausible, but unless they actually do something with them, which takes time, there's no impact.
---
It is the combination of the creation and storage that permits enough fake capital to be generated to devalue currency.  What's actually been introduced into circulation?   Not simply that the ability exists.  So you argue from fear over possibility and conjecture rather than fact.
---
To have impact it must not only be made, it must actually enter the market in enough volume to dilute value.  The duplication of other items is vastly more impactful as it takes true rarity and makes it commonplace.  The issue is not the volume of caps in circulation. It is counterfeiting of what should be relatively unique rare items.
---
Yet you're focused on Nuka Colas
---
Don't listen to them, Beth. I made my character right the first time. 
---
I agree with you that losing weapons would raise the stakes and make it feel like you actually want to stay alive. Losing junk at this point is nothing (lvl 110).  Like the idea but not sure if I would participate unless they make survival and adventure mode separate characters. 
---
Get rid of all the bullshit legendary weapons first
---
yup I find simple is best as it gives fewer things to break by making it a simple placeable decoration they could also add books and other objects we could place on shelves or even meals and forks and such or bottles on the ground 
---
or hey maybe you always wanted to make a beer bottle castle in real life but after half a case you forgot why you had 2 truck loads of beer to go through and realize in games safer this time
---
Yep. I switched to this from traditional melee sometime between levels 50 and 100. I carry 3 guns all over repaired and I have reasonable staying power. It only took two guns to take down the queen last night. 
---
And you think you know whats best for everyone? Or is this whats best for you? You tell me not to assume what you are thinking and not to suggest I know whats best for you in a previous comment to me but you are doing the exact same thing lol. Not everyone wants to start fresh and trying to force them to do so because you want to and you want everyone else to do the same is a really hypocritical statement. You have the option to start fresh if you want to, they have the option to not do it if they choose so. Forcing those who don't want to restart into havin no other option is a really shit thing to do.
---
Lol Bethesda can't do anything right, this is such a stupid plan 
---
100%. dont care about pvp and im already in a dull endgame loop. all this news is troubling
---
They matter a little. All new characters would make for a very fun server launch day, IMO. 
---
The way it looks now is that it will be like what you described from the start.  New characters without duping would have at *the very least* make the economy more interesting. 
---
Well still a point in experiencing the content within the game quests and events and exploration in adventure mode.
---
Then for some good ol pvp move to survival.
---
Wait. OOTL whats this survival mode?
---
UO was 1000000x better before they added fel and trammel. After it was added, people only went to fel to PvP. Before than it was more of a realistic world. People doing their farming, crafting, gathering, pvping, fishing, trading etc all in the same world. If you only started playing UO after tram came out, you narrowly missed the best online experience in gaming history :(
---
I tend not to kill wanted players unless they clearly want me to.
---
I have pacifist mode turned on so they have to wait until I turn it off and go back into the game proper...they usually get inpatient and start hitting me in a melee.  So I use a ripper to get them down to as little health as possible and then blow up a car to kill them
---
Nice work. Thanks!
---
there is only one reason to not allow current characters in the new mode:  duped legendaries.  that's all that needs to be said.  
---
also, op, I think you are confused, if character progression moves over that means all of it, including story progression, you won't be coming out of the vault as a high level with high level gear, you already came out of the vault, you will spawn in the new mode wherever on the map you were, with all your gear and quests.
---
That would be nice. I don't think many players wanted this over improving the current game first. Bethesda is so out of touch..
---
Yo, do you play on ps4. Honestly I a little salty that the message of this post got completely derailed but if you wanted I'ld show you some cool stuff. I agree they're may be some balancing to do, but I really think it's more buffs; most multiplayer games receive balance adjustments.
---
just if we do play, please try to not spoil any immersion stuff, I promise I won't spoil anything for you without your asking for that specific information.
---
I've always said they need the pve servers they have now and then full pvp servers with no character swapping between the 2
---
This was never promised to be and is not a typical, single player, PvE fallout. It was marketed as a multi-player survival game which it is.
---
Survival mode? Adventure mode? Did I miss something?
---
It seems like there is still tons of mixed opinions on this one. I would of thought someone would of already tested it. Looks like I gotta take matters into my own hands? 
---
*looks at the 83 blank holotapes in my stash*
---
What would be even cooler is if I could use my mic to record messages on those. 
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/222594/i-got-an-official-response-to-pve-options-in-fallout-76/2
---
At no point was this game ever advertised that it would have pvp / pve dedicated servers.  It just seems crazy you guys are mad that the game is as advertised.  I want a lot of changes in the game , especially in regards to balancing and duping.  However, I understand that balancing takes time and they need to collect data . This game is still relatively new.  Be patient . Every game with pvp  is always unbalanced as fuck to begin with.  
---
My point is I think some people are making a big deal about pve only servers. That's hopefully never going to happen . It would serve us better to talk about what needs to be balanced,  not let's just build a fucking wall and separate them forever.  
---
For example ; 
---
Camps should be protected and take significantly reduced dmg from players , if you are not wanted or actively engaged.   
---
Dmg against structures should be cheaper to repair . 
---
It should be coded in to be literally impossible to one hit kill people in pacifist mode . So damage scaling needs to be re looked at .
---
They should implement some kind of permanent wanted system and make specific areas ' safe ' zones . Basically copy eve online . For example if you attack someone in the vicinity ' newbies' area you will get killed by bad ass responders that drop no loot and you suffer some kind of lasting penalty such as damaged gear. 
---
If you keep griefing and killing people in newbie areas your account becomed  wanted  for an extended period and anyone can freely attack you at any time, with no penalty .  
---
No one who you've been recently partied with or have partied with in the past can collect your bounty.  If they kill you , you lose wanted status but the caps are lost .
---
Those are some ideas of the top of my head 
---
Does he stay big when you drop him? Because I think I remember there were some "deformed" teddys in FO3, but if you picked them up and dropped them, they became normal. 
---
If it's really made of lambskin as they claim, then $276 is a good deal. A lot of people complaining about the cost of the jacket have clearly never purchased a real leather jacket before.  
---
I would be curious to know what detrimental effects, if any, there are to the color coatings on it (besides being ugly as hell). Lambskin is more delicate than normal leather. Also makes me curious why they didn't just use a cheaper leather to begin with if they were going to paint it. But then again they don't do many things that make sense these days.  
---
Yah this was a glaring huge bad decision. Even as someone like me that has no interest in ever playing in this mode, I knew character transfers with all gear and levels was going to be a big mistake. At the very least I was expecting no gear to transfer over and TSE to be banned or something.  Yikes.
---
&gt;You’re free to create new characters for Survival mode, and encouraged to do so, but you can also use your existing ones.
---
Ugh. TSE weapons galore? No thanks.
---
But then I'm not big in to PVP anyway so if that mode is fucked it's not my problem.
---
&gt;We’re also planning to award you double the Caps when you kill another player, and they may drop their Aid or other items in addition to their Junk.
---
Hahahahahaha yeah definitely not doing PVP
---

&gt;Early Warnings quest progress will no longer become stuck when crafting Upgraded Motors, and logging out after crafting Upgraded Motors will no longer reset the quest tracker to 0/5.
---
Oh jeeze I'm glad they're doing this because I just started that quest and forgot all about the bug.... I hope I don't log on to 0/5 when I get home but if I do at least I can know it'll be fixed somewhat soon.
---
&gt; Otherwise all the hardcore gamers that already have complete build with multiple BiS weapons will shit on me repeatedly. 
---
In a month **tops**, even with a reset, this would occur. Maybe not to you but come xmas 2019 it'll be the same issue for those new people.
---
could also do books and all kinds of things with the same concept wouldn't take much more then a intern and some free time
---
after all they made lanterns we can't pick up cause they have evolved from the FEV virus and nuclear material to never come unstuck from the ground no matter what we do even tactical nukes I'm sure we can do it to a bear
---
Xbox one since latest patch. Equipping or fast travelling in power armor un-equips my right arm power armor piece meaning I lose full set equipped bonuses. 
---
Metro Exodus is out in less than a month :)
---
It's gonna be as successful as a full priced rust, or day-z. Resources are being devoted to this game mode that no one will enjoy unless they're in the predatory role.
---
I only use what I find too, I have never even seen the trade window in this game lol.
---
If you're talking about shroud of the avatar, it sucks unfortunately
---
Nothing they do it about it either way since their logo is just the number 76  with no additive or anything than the numbers themselves, they can't put copyright on a number
---
I am not forcing anyone to do anything. I have stated multiple times in this chain that it is open for discussion. I have even said that if I'm wrong then I would love to know. I have at no point told anyone what they want or need. I would be losing my characters as well but if it doesnt happen then it doesn't happen. I'm only voicing MY opinion.
---
Why are they doing this when they have so many bugs to fix?  
---
Priorities: 1. Fix bugs 2. Add content
---
Nope. But the card just boosts the Explosive part of the damage. So instead of +20% form the Explosion u get +40% with the 100% stronger explosion's. That means u get 4% more damage to your base per rank (+20% stronger explosion's) what makes Demolition's Expert to the worst damage card in comparisson to the others
---
Sure, teach me my job  
---
And software architecture too.  
---
How about proper interfaces and restriction of side-effects ?  
---
Next you could tell me about pure functions  
---
Then separation of concern !
---
These guys, at Bethesda, aren't even able to make sure clicking 3 times a second on a button doesn't mess up their points counting system.
---
I somehow manage, on a daily basis, to make sure users can't spam any button in my UI. Or that no data that shouldn't be sent to the server leaves my users devices. And I don't even consider myself great at my job.
---
Yup, there's two Damaged ones in that locker room. However, the full suit has double the Rad resist of the damaged ones, so it makes the radiation in the plant core much easier to manage.
---
Permadeath.  That would add tension.  Respawning is such a nonsensical concept.  How did this vault get magic? Everyone else ever to set foot in WV is dead, permanently.
---
If we get to respawn, why not Taggerty?  The firebreathers are all dead, but some goofball griefer keeps coming back to kill you like a cartoon.  His own team kills him to keep the bounty har har.  None of that makes any sense in the context of this game.
---
The new "inside the vault"
---
111% agree, PLEASE Bethesda
---
Sometimes if you enter a instanced building while aggro'd, you will bring in what ever is aggroing on you.  Its the main reason people get killed by invisible mobs.
---
I also don't agree with you. Observe that. 
---
So where did they Fuck up in your Opinion?
---
I'm a horrible person and nuked right next to the Overseers camp. Low levels were dying like flys 
---
I don’t like the added incentives for killing other players willy nilly but do like the slap damage going away. Without tying it to factions and alerting everyone in your faction when you are under attack or killed by another factions member, my first thoughts are karma based system to an extent. Based on how many times you’ve killed unprovoked players or stolen from them or damaged their camp, moves you to different karma levels that flags your inventory for lootable items. Any items you have that were stolen drop just like scrap when you die. If you’ve killed other players unprovoked all weapons and armor of yours is flagged as dropping when you die (possibly tie this to the lower your karma is the more of your non scrap items will drop when you die. Maybe make it so you can flag 6 or so items that will never drop but not sure if I want that). 
---
The main thing is I don’t want a “PvP” mode I want a Fallout game where the players can kill each other if they want to, can raid each other if they want to, but there are consequences to killing “innocents” and advantages to killing “innocents”. I hate the slap damage mechanic it needs to be changed to the initial hit does no damage or it does full damage depending on what direction the developers want to do. If they get player vending figured out tying people’s actions to whether they can trade might help. If you’ve killed someone unprovoked maybe you can’t trade with them or their vendor bot ever. So eventually it might bite you in the ass if you just go around killing everyone. I think flagging all other players as red is a bad decision and it should work similar to the way it works with npcs. If a player kills a lot of other players they show up as red, otherwise they don’t. Showing whether the player is hostile based on their past actions. I don’t want a mode that is just PVP for the sake of PvP with leaderboards and kill counts that it appears this is (though I could see a bounty board style leaderboard working). And I don’t like upscaling players to account for level discrepancy. Just like how there is no value going around hunting level 1 enemies when you are level 50 you should have nothing to gain from killing much lower level people and everything to lose. 
---
I would buy Fallout76 and transform it into Rust. I would lose 90% of the playerbase but the game would be a true survival for the remaining 10%.
---
wish it was that easy, the problem is that I dont get audio from other players at all, and neither can they hear me no matter what my ingame settings are
---
I found a nice dump of plans, armor, weapons, 2 PA frames etc. at the train station outside of top of the world last night. I took wat was useful to me and left the rest. 
---
Sounds good. Energy weapon fix when?
---
Its not content. They moved a few numbers around. That might take an hour to do. 
---
To make it worse, the loading screens show random stills from all of your characters, and sometimes show the levels of your different characters instead of the level of the character you've selected. Again, basic stuff 
---
I...may..have just pee'd a little lol!
---
And that's fine.
---
What does any of that mean
---
Post a source. There was no inside the vault Jan 14...
---
For me, on PS4 there is a character tab underneath the PLAY tab.
---
Hear hear.
---
Well said, agree 100%. Very bad move by Bethesda.
---
But that might also confuse people into thinking it is *only* a team-based game mode. Since Co-op has almost universally meant a two-player game.
---
It might be related to where you set up camp, I built mine on the hillside near Mothman Museum, never once had NPCs attack it. Not a great location otherwise though lol.
---
Yeah.  That's nice.  Try 4 guys, all of which are over 35 years old, running around the wasteland in red dresses.
---
there is obviously an intermediate solution, where you can craft the best weapons and/or armor in the game, but the required materials only drop (rarely) from end game content, we see a little of that in the high-end linings but just a few extra SPECIAL points feels a little underwhelming and i think this system can and should be expanded, maybe allow us to put specific legendary effects on weapons using specific and very rare materials that only drop from end-game content (and preferably make legendary effects other than TSE or bloody actually competitive in damage)
---
I doubt we have any accurate numbers about how many people want/enjoy PvP here and I feel like 10% is an understatement, but my issue is that they are working on adding new content for the secondary PvP aspect of the game while there are still major flaws and a lack of content for the primary PvE aspect of the game. 
---
Its posts like this one that makes me think the subreddit is being astroturfed.
---
You aren't voicing an opinion when are ASKING for them to do it. "Bethesda, please make Survival Mode require a new character."
---
You are requesting they do what you want them to do. In other words, you are trying to force your wants on other players who do not feel the same way. It would be better to suggest a split survival mode where you have the choice to restart or use a current character and have them separate from each other.
---
Vat 76 is the only no nuke area.
---
1) Log in
---
2) Check for any events with legendary mobs
---
3) Check vendors for plans I need
---
4) Clear the Whitesprings club house
---
5) Relog and repeat
---
I'll also launch the occasional nuke, but even that gets boring with so few places that are worth it.
---
This is a great idea but i dont know if i want to server hop for 2 hours a day for 2 weeks again just to find 1 calibrated xo1 shock mod. Still havent found the jetpack. They need to make the mods more available. Also you'd be punishing everyone who didnt dupe to get a ton of explosive weapons. Every other fallout game I've enjoyed making new characters but I wouldnt really look forward to grinding another 98 levels to get back to where I am in this one. Plus what would stop people from just trading all their old items to the new character and then joining the pvp servers? If our pvp characters are locked to the pvp servers then we have to do all of the quests over again? Also theres no guarantee someone wouldnt just find another explosive weapon on pvp servers and then start duping and now he has a market on both servers? I think they just need to make all legendarys character locked if they were aquired before the new mode goes online. That way non dupers arent really punished because we're not selling all of our stuff for money. And dupers now have thousands of pounds of equipment they can't sell anymore. I saw this idea posted a few weeks ago but I dont remember from who. Don't want to take credit for ideas that werent mine but its a good one.
---
Have you tried looking up cool camp locations or waterfall location on youtube
---
I've seen 0 pvp, and less than a handful of wanted people ever. Who are al these "give me pvp" people they speak of?
---
Ugh, so many spelling errors in FO76.
---
Then people would say they are ripping off 3 and being unoriginal
---
dude. i can't wait for the new mode. Raiding players on the pve servers sucks cat balls compared to this new mode.
---
I bought the game the day of release, been over encumbered most of the time.
---
It's pretty crazy how incompetent the rollout for everything to do with Fallout 76 is. There have to be smart people at Bethesda who know that these things are going to be received badly, but they don't have the power to say "No, that's stupid." The people making top-level decisions are clearly a) very disconnected from the community at large and b) doing very little to deviate from the plan they set before launch
---
I was hoarding teddy bears lol. Until I found out the couldn’t be displayed in any way. Magazines too which make the 2 magazine racks pointless and stupid. 
---
Yea, immersive but too annoying for what I like.
---
I prefer respawning but without to fight the same guy over and over just because he won a fight against me, such behaviour always felt bitchy for me. 
---
But permadeath is too much for the time you have to invest in questing and levelling. At least for me.
---
Agreed, it doesn't make any sense to transfer characters.
---
Yeah with survival mode coming in it’d be great if they made non-survival mode strictly PVE.
---
Suddenly griefing loses its appear there and people can play in peace without being one shot or having their camp destroyed just because.  (Until a scorchbeast or mirelurk queen on her period shows up anyway).
---
There's (I think) 7 cap pools total
---
* Responders
---
* Raiders
---
* Free States
---
* Enclave
---
* Brotherhood
---
* Whitesprings
---
* Watoga
---
Depending on how you handle selling your drops, it is easy to wipe out all vendors of caps. Even buying stuff from them doesn't help(since they only put like 1/3 of your purchase price back in to their pool).
---
If they just made it so every vendor had their own cap stash, I think that would be enough. I don't see how vendors across the map from each other share a pool of caps in the first place.
---
It’s not like it’s been out for months with complaints about PvP the entire time. Doesn’t take a genius to figure out that a PvP mode might help make people on both sides of the PvP spectrum happier. 
---
That being said, they should probably like... make PvP suck less first. Buuuuut here we are. 
---
You’ll shoot your eye out, Kid.
---
Why even make this post? The entire point of defending “no new characters” is to provide dupers and cheaters with an advantage.  
---
Arguing that no change should occur because “tryhards” is dumb and makes me believe you are a duper, and a cheater.  
---
No player who believes in balance or skill or fairness should buy into this garbage.  
---
Vote yes for new characters only.  
---
It’s called “survival mode beta” 😂 They’re trying to figure what works and doesn’t work. What’s there at the beginning might not be there at the end. They’re not going to know until people play. If you read the Inside the Vault, it states to be aware of low lvl characters as they are also dangerous. So the playing field is leveled to give them a fighting chance. You guys are so easy to jump on the hate bandwagon. 
---
“SURVIVAL MODE IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART” 
---
It’s called survival mode for a reason. 
---
If you can’t handle the drama, hop off. 
---
That's what I'm rocking at lvl 19. + A Death Tambo for conserving ammo. 
---
"sense" forever.
---
"There must be girl monsters or there wouldn't be any monsters."  
---
True, otherwise, how could they... monster mash?
---
Even if they do that the duper’s will just dupe in the PVP worlds and the problem continues. Sure the first few days/weeks will be good but it won’t change anything. Duping still exists and shitty players still exist so this entire idea of a new server was a bad idea to begin with.
---
They should have focused on fixing core issues before green lighting people to get “creative” to save the game.
---
There is a limit. 10 on PC. Once you run out of spaces on the scroll wheel you can't favorite more items.
---
I would be completely fine with that as well. I'm flattered by the amount of sway your comments suggest I have with Bethesda but you are fully within your rights to make a post asking for the policy to remain the same. They will have equal weight I assure you.
---
I don’t think this sub is going to have very many people that’ll be on that mode. I’m just guessing here but the general feeling of the comments is people that don’t like PvP. 
---
Expectations are so low when it come to 76 though :(
---
If we got everything on that list it would be awesome additions to the game, it would still be a very empty weak DLC though compared to what other (lesser dev teams) put out on a quarterly basis for there games. That's whats so frustrating about all of this for me tbh :(
---
Some great ideas though and if we see all of that in next weeks into the vault Ill become a fanboi / white knighter for Bethesda!
---
Is it crag on that sign as well, i couldn't make out the last word. Maybe that's the area that leaked on you tube last week. Hopefully some sort of team content for us!
---
Id be happy if the inside the vaults went to lets plays, where a dev sits around with the community manager plays the game, maybe show cases what they working on and taking a few questions live from players. give us content every 3 months if that's how long it takes, But don't go silent for 3 months and not say a word then show up with a few bug fixes, that just kills it :(
---
Excellent! Thanks.
---
I don't suppose you've done any testing over which PA set or individual peices are best? :)
---
All leather armour with powered legendary effects.
---
That’s what you meant right?  (INFINITE VATS)
---
What? 
---
Cool. I'll bet it's got some sweet loot.
---
Does the luck perk that gives every shot a chance to repair the gun not scale well with automatic? For that matter I wonder if a pipe gun automatic build would be more sustainable?
---
Let's add to the game, not remove! Should be splitted by levels so people can decide if they want to start new character or not.
---
So.......
---
Get off your ass and........
---
Go to another location.
---
......
---
Pretty much. If you need titanium, lead, or fusion cores there's some reason there, but...its minimal. The plans you get from claiming and that first defense that happens are about worth it...and if i'm honest, I've claimed, defended, and then server hopped to do it again, without having to get "defend your garbage" alerts. 
---
Fully agree. I would also
---
&gt;In a month tops...
---
Uh, yeah. I said that in my first post. I'll still take a few weeks of actually enjoying a hardcore more over no weeks.
---
Yeah, in a perfect world, dupers would be banned before this server happens like you said in another comment. But... That's not gonna happen. And saying "But *eventually* the server will be ruined anyway" is a terrible argument because why bother doing it at all then? At least let people enjoy it at first.
---
What's more important, they are boring
---
If they do stick with it, just keep all your aid in your stash and take only with you what you’re willing to lose. 
---
I bought the plan just for the upper cabinets and now I can’t even use them?! This sucks. 
---
Yes the numbers are just an estimation, based only on what I’ve heard and read other players say. But yes this is my issue also, Bethesda needs to get the priorities for this game in check.
---
If anyone can sell me the plan on Xbox I would pay 10kcaps cause ive been hunting the plan for weeks now
---
100% agree 
---
If they expand the dropped items to include aid and other stuff, new players become far less of a target as killing them has little useful reward. 
---
Not to mention that high level players griefing low levels players will quickly learn that they are a target for other high level players. Easy, distracted pickins.
---
That's fair too
---
Well said
---
I forgot the date , the one where they announce that they are adding event progress tags is in the same article where they announce the TS E nerf.
---
Although it doesn’t matter anyway because I misread the OPs post.
---
Pipe guns are garbage at higher levels. I haven't tried the luck skill but if it works out let me know. 
---
Boo hiss. Survival mode might as well not have any armor either and just one weapon. Oh, and everyone stays the same level forever. What a load of shit. Reroll evens shit out for one day and then you go to bed or work and someone else stays up playing. A team of people pool their collective loot and gear and suddenly everyone's complaining about someone having an unfair edge again. 
---
Sort it by level for the love of god. Low levels pay with others in their range and highs in their own world. This is the only way to give both sides what they want and honestly the way it should have been this whole time. 
---
I agree with you, actually. I just think Beth is jumping from one idea to another without recognizing the mismatches. 
---
Not really. I mean, they can bitch slap your camp around but that’s whatever. A bit of farming and you’re all fixed. Unless you’re taking workshops or doing PvP specific quests you’re not gonna be pvping. 
---
Yeah, I am going to be waiting on the edit on this one...
---
Would the fuck is making these decisions? this is the worst thing they can do. Starting fresh will give a reason for people to grind and play the game, this is where the game thrives, end game is where this game fails. Everyone jumping into this new mode with nothing to grind for and no characters to build will just make it boring af and most likely toxic to boot. 
---
For the love of God Bethesda listen to this post !!! this will give us some more playtime out of this game. 
---
&gt; shroud of the avatar
---
I heard that but i heard that about 76 a well so I'm torn, for all my bethesda poking i do love the game and only want whats best for it.
---
Is shroud that bad though? Didn't realise it was out already so maybe there's another one I'm thinking off.
---
There are several spots that roughly match that description East-Southeast of the tracks between the Whitespring and Pleasant Valley train stations.
---
How do they balance solo players verse group players?. Do the solo players just get stomped on and then avoid this mode?.
---
PvP is normally a skill based thing how do they balance gear and weapons?. Currently 76 is very very unbalanced across the board.
---
How is allowing more than your junk to drop and double caps a good risk?. I can see people just avoiding it for that.
---
k stop playing then
---
Click character and then choose which one you want. Hit play
---
1/4 of staff (About 10 people) are working on the game.
---
Rest of making Atomic Shop items.
---
You get &lt;1 rad per second which I think means less than 1 but without it you get about 5
---
Nah. I just don't play games for PvP, unless it's a specific and unifying focus of the game, like Mechwarrior Online, or Counter-Strike. 
---
Perhaps survival mode is to lure out those dupers and punish them? Maybe we should spread a rumour that is what is happening to keep them away. 
---
Guess I'll stick to PvE and be a bitch then.
---
You have titanium!?
---
No imo that is a negligible proportion of the player base. Doing this would only split the community even more. Also as someone keen on pvp, the idea of having to invest another 100+ hours to get my survival character to the same state as my original sucks. This is the mode I wanted the game to be from the start. Really don't want to level to 50 again /repeat all the quests. 
---
Because they changed the software without testing it even once. 
---
Yeah but over time players will gain legendary weapons and armour that will put them at too greater advantage. Just get rid of legendaries in survival and make it even harder. 
---
Or legendaries drop if you die in survival. That will encourage co op play against in game gods.
---
I hate pvp in this game. So I dont know much to add to the discussion on the new servers, but wouldnt most issues have been fixed has they just allowed pacifist mode to be pacifist only. If you select to play that way, you take no damage, ever. Your camp can not be destroyed and you carry on playing the game without being bothered by others. 
---
No matter how much someone has duped or what guns they have, it wont effect you if you're in pacifist mode. 
---
Pvp only mode should be something totally different than just the base game and allowing carried over characters. It should have started everyone on the same level. All plans and mods already accessible. No story line mode at all. True survival. Fight for supplies, fight for weapons, fight eachother. Maybe even limiting the game to 20.or so types of weapons or armor you can use so it's more skill based than who grinds the most. 
---
That’ll just lead to people demanding a lesser budget cost for those items and a bigger camp limit (which we do need but I suspect people will never like a budget on their camp period) 
---
Good luck. I've been posting to the market to buy it and the best answers I get are about the prime receiver for it.
---
It's easier and cheaper to buy serum recipes ..... O.o
---
they have tried to patch duping many times, and there are still multiple ways to dupe. if you truly believe that they can/will patch all of the dupe methods between today and the launch of survival mode, you are delusional
---
My problem is still not having enough space, I have hundred and hundreds of springs screws and gears. People just need to learn to find good farming spots for components.
---
Honestly it’s starting to get tiring hearing people say they don’t have enough. Well stop messing around at whitespring and head to sugar grove or graham HQ, you won’t need to worry about resources, only having space to hold it all. That’s where a mule comes in. 
---
Show me a video of someone being killed through slap damage. 
---
It’s located East of  Top of the World.  You will see a flower icon in he area and that is where it is located.
---
Still not sorted out the main reason why I am not playing the game... I have 2 quests that a bugged completely and the daily/events don’t track which ones I have done!
---
First quest is the Overseers mission, I have all the holotapes, challenge also confirms this but after listening many times of the mature woman it still will not complete!
---
And the most annoying one is the Mistress of Mystery wuestline with collecting the EMP, I have emptied Sugar grove every time I get on. Got the SYPHON holotape, insert it into a the computer to download and it always say, go to main menu to insert holotape...  tried this many times before just getting frustrated and leaving the game as I cannot progress any further in that quest. 
---
is that why 1 hair style costs £6 o.0
---
That's if the game is even the same when pvp comes out. There's a video of a Dev room that looked like a cod map or something similar. There was an open middle section with a train car in it and two seperate lanes all of the assets that are already in game. Idk I have looked on into the vault so if it's a survival surver and not something different disregard this comment. 
---
You don't have a character tab?  On mine you can go into the character tab and choose any of your characters or "new" if you want to start a new character. 
---
What platform do you use? Same issue but not all the time. We just invite via console instead of through the game 
---
I think a better way to phrase this is, why prioritize so many resources to something this involved when the majority of comments and asks are not this. There are definitely people who want to play PvP. If the goal of this is to eventually have anything PvP as one mode and zero PvP in the other mode, that makes sense from a design perspective. Hell, it could mean that we no longer see facets of the base game being changed just to support PvP. 
---
That said, the core complaints and issues people are complaining about great dwarf this. This is something that could have been tackled later. This is just my opinion, but the single biggest thing they should be working on aside from bug fixes/stability is adding more content. For a game that is intending to be around and played for a long time, there's not that much to do. There are a limited set of actual quests, and how often are people going to want to keep repeating the same events?
---
If they implement “Survival Mode” it’s going to be a “Survival Mode” for the game itself. 
---
If it was like that at launch, it would have been dead on arrival for all the PvE only players.
---
It's good that the PvP players get what they really wanted but I'm real glad that it's a separate mode and not something everyone has to be involved with.
---
Yes. Troll are bullies. But now that death will carry a bigger penalty (not just junk) 
---
Watch how surprisingly little griefing happens between high levels and low levels. 
---
You see, other high level players will quickly realize that picking off a distracted griefer is easy work, and get actual useful shit from that kill. 
---
I jsut want to display power armor xD
---
Agreed.  If  Survival mode isn't a fresh start character it's gonna be flooded with everyone and their duped explosive shotties and that's it.
---
as far as your edit did you just load into the server/was it just launched? my game seems to defualt there until i load in enough for the real location to show as nuked in the map.
---
and yup you can nuke up there, iirc only off limits area is flatwoods/vault76 area.  that lumber co. is one of my favorite places to drop a nuke
---
Are there?  How do you know there are multiple ways to dupe still? 
---
&gt;We're shared with the devs that this is something players want.
---
Are you working out of a call center in India?
---
I love a lot of the ideas, and have had similar wishes myself. I do think some might be better than others.
---
I can't wait for any sort of difficulty adjustments making it harder. but they also have players who do want more relaxing casual play and that is cool to.
---
I don't know if permadeath is atually a way to go in this game because there are so many in game functions surrounding the death mechanics of the game. Charisma changes in fo76 basically make death an option, at least tactically.
---
I did like the idea of permadeath when I first started playing but because of bounties and everything it doesn't seem viable. However maybe having it in some other way like:
---
!!!SPOILER WARNING!!!------------LOOK AWAY-----------------------------
---
\------------------------------------------LOOK AWAY-------------------------------
---
maybe make it so that new characters have a time limit to get inoculated or they permadie (and become them green thing or bite the ear off their buddy saying one of us in game while yelling on the mic "dude I swear I can't control myself"). or maybe that if they get the virus through interactions with the scorched the time limit to getting inoculated happens.
---
I have the nuke cola T-51b and it’d be cool to put in my shrine to Nuka Cola
---
Yes, I assumed you had
---
Hence why I explained what they were adding
---
We are talking about the same thing mate, lol
---
The game isn't ready for Survival Mode.
---
I mean I want it 
---
Seriously?...
---
MAKE THIS HAPPEN BETHESDA. WE ALL WANT A FAIR CHANCE 
---
If they put the work in and farm the items, then there is no problem with that. Assuming that cheating has been managed, players don't need to be equalized.  The player that plays better should win. The player that puts more work in should be better off with equipment.
---
Eh I disagree with all some of the things you wrote. Don't mean to be rude or anything but they've released a bunch of statements and lots of fixes since launch, so I'm not sure why you wrote 'go silent for 3 months.. then show up with a few bug fixes'. I definitely want to see more from Bethesda but that seems like a very inaccurate statement lol. And I enjoy the game so my expectations for 76 are not low at all, I just want to see more from the Inside the Vault posts now that we're a few months from launch!
---
As to the image, I \~think\~ it said crag. And yea I'd be stoked for team content. The idea of surviving some kind of valley of death is awesome haha. :D
---
Handmade rifle.  I just like AKs, have 5 in various calibers and considering one or two more.  Fun rifle to shoot, most ammo is pretty cheap.  They are getting expensive lately, becoming a collectors item.  
---
&gt;Players bought Fallout 76 for the PvE(90% or more of players).
---
Source?
---
This is hilarious, the facial expression and positioning really makes it. Seems like he might be kind of jerk though, naked and sprawled out on the only container in the room? Inconsiderate, at a minimum.
---
That thing is ... kinda nasty looking anyways
---
Notice the top right corner at the main menu? I think those are the perk cards people were concerned about
---
At least add a perk or scrapper rank 2 to earn those
---
In Fallout 4 I have one room full of teddies that I have collected... Pls just let me collect them in this game too. 💔
---
Wtf dairy queen is seasonal? The ones where I live are open 24/7 also it's hard to say a franchise like fallout is dead or dying. It was one bad game, not even a bad game, a decent game with some problems.. Monetization of it shouldn't happen that goes without saying, but saying it's going to be monetized to death is like saying eso shouldny have worked. 
---
[Hmmmmm looks familiar....](https://youtu.be/8RIfDYdzNIk?t=158)
---
Pretty clear to me - According to the latest "Inside the Vault" blog post, Bethesda states that players can move their characters between the standard mode to the new "Survival" mode at will.  I agree with OP in thinking this is a mistake.  Characters should be locked to one mode or the other, but I'm down with allowing a one-way transfer for a period of time.
---
Yep, where did they fuck up this Time with the "News from the Vault" and the Announcement of the, more PVP Heavy, Survival Mode. I'm Interested where they fucked up in ur Opinion
---
Hahahaha the "Sad!" in the middle really got me. Actually laughed out loud!
---
Yeah, good point.
---
there is, you can only heart as many items fit on your hotbar, I believe that means 12
---
I don’t mind starting over in level to play in the new game mode but I for one don’t want to have to recreate my character’s appearance and we should be able to transfer caps over to adventure mode from survival as a reward for winning in PvP and that be the only thing we can do. If it just stays in survival what risk is there other than losing caps you can’t use. One could argue you could buy weapons in the new game mode but it would make more since to wipe weapons and gear every week so everyone starts out on the same foot. That why there never is truly a difference except in level.
---
From my understanding this is even worse if you have two left hands.
---
And then set it on fire. 
---
Yeah but in a perfect world fallout 76 should've released with a server browser and modes for both types of players.
---
It would squarely fit the definition here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative\_gameplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_gameplay) Co-op might imply 2-player on console, but in the gaming world in general, co-op game mode means one or more players playing together cooperatively against the environment / AI / plot. It is the converse competitive, versus, or deathmatch multiplayer game modes.
---
Just a word of warning about leaving PA. I did this with a couple of complete sets of raider PA and a few extra cores in the vendor register near by. I pass a level 80 on the way out (flatwoods) and I decided to watch him. He goes to the PA, snags that core and then the other cores in the register. 
---
Obviously, it's up for grabs, but I wanted them to go to a lowbie who could use it. Now they couldn't even enter the Armor to claim it. I had to leave a few more cores after the asshat left.
---
Dream come true &lt;3
---
This sounds more like the arena set up that appeared in the data mine.  I'd rather have this as an instanced event rather then a game mode.
---
Also, try the Battlefield series if you want most of that now and not later.
---
I wonder if the care takers have gotten sick of random gamers making obscure references to a certain game that came out recently. 
---
The leather jacket...
---
The economy going to shit...
---
Still haven’t given the people their bags they were promised...
---
I think you just solved the problem honestly. If they did this and then made it so you had to make a new character at the start of survival, it would be perfect. 
---
wait what survival mode?? what’s that?
---
"Do... do you have a hazmat suit?"
---
"Oh come on, we don't need to use one of those!"
---
"Jonathan you know how I feel about that..."
---
I am both confused and disappointed by this weird focus on pvp first. I am happy that it will be added and that it will happen for those that like it and all that. But there is so much else for content, varied and larger week or monthly events, endgame progression and content, CAMP decorating and building stuff, story live service stuff that was talked about repeatedly.... 
---
lvl 68 Scorched Conquerer spawn wave right now at Sunshine meadow farms
---
Disagree.  People would accidentally transfer and be forever pissed.  
---
Which is why every time I am out exploring.
---
If I see a nice spot I should move to later.
---
I open my map and take a picture with my phone of the location.
---
It helps a lot.
---
I've seen some really nice spots in Savage Divide.
---
I hate hoe popular th middle of the map has become lately.
---
I used to have that spot all to myself on XboX.
---
It has a really nice small lake with attached boat and cave.
---
Because pve...just works!
---
Lol if you're on xbox, I joined that server a bit ago and saw they were nuking there.
---
And go into a frenzy when the babies die!
---
Just export your picutes and delete them. How many charactors are allowed on an account?
---
I get that.  I got rid of Bunker Buster myself.  It stung for a second, but--when I was completely honest with myself--I realized that in all the hours I had invested in this game I had used a missile launcher exactly one time (I was a low level picking off a fog crawler from the Welch Station platform).  Same thing with most energy weapons. I just don't tend to use them, so away they go.
---
Dense armor is not a legendary mod. And fireproof is just a perk. Those two make you immune to explosive damage so you are hating mutations and legendaries for nothing. TSE weapons are already getting nerfed to only doing 20% extra damage rendering them useless. 
---
Remove lengendary effects, that's done. This is the balance eheh ! 
---
If not, let's go division 2 for PVP  :P
---
Hm,
---
&gt; If he isn't rewarded to hunt me down over and over because of a stupid scoreboard, I guess he has no reason to use that equipment against me. 
---
Makes sense, but then why want the PVP server if there's "no reason" to engage in PVP?  
---
Don't think I'll understand :x 
---
Thanks for explaining, though
---
Do you play the game? Literally no one plays this game for pvp. 
---
No, I've not done anything with PA yet.
---
The [protected zone](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/File:Fo76_targeting_computer_protected_zone_map.png) is just some of the forest around and beneath Vault 76.
---
Fallout Youtubers lie
---
Gaming journalists suck
---
This stash capacity makes me say
---
"Excuse me, what the fuck?"
---
And second?
---
I like greater rpg elements and not just pvp.
---
You can't nuke the area near vault 76 but up by Grafton and the Crashed space station, you sure can nuke the heck outta that area. 
---
Your friend would also not be able to trade between characters....so you still couldn't get it into survival.
---
This some r/2007scape tier shitpost 
---
Didn't all of the dev room gear get deleted from players' inventories?
---
&gt; Explosive itself is not OP either.
---
Except that it truly is. It gives far more damage than anything else in its tier and gives damage increase eclipsing most primary damage mods for legendaries. You can't tell me that a secondary damage mod being stronger than 95% of primary damage mods isn't a problem. In fact I think it's the strongest mod in the game, I can't think of anything that out performs it and some mods only tie with it but those require you to jump through dangerous hoops like being **super low** hp. The nerfed explosive mod will outdamage furious and furious requires a fucking ramp up. Explosive will just straight do more damage with no downsides AND turn your damage into a small AoE further increasing your damage. It's only downside is you can't get too close otherwise you damage yourself, but that's not really much of an issue when you're mowing things down.
---
Is there a recipe for Psychotata? I have the Bufftats one. 
---
Because of all the PVE players whining about the PVP players?  
---
Let's be honest.  +20 posts a day cross this sub about griefing, or someone getting thier CAMP blown up, or how workshops suck because people keep hunting them down after taking one...it's an endless stream of Boo-hoo due to the PVP aspects.  It's a combination game and we all knew it going in.  
---
I hate PVP.  I will not be wasting one moment in the new PVP mode, but I will be soooo happy to have the RUST burnouts, the squeakers and the griefers beating on each other instead of bothering me.  
---
And maybe we PVE/COOP players can have some peace and quiet, nice camps, and less fuss about workshops in the future.  
---
Yay Bethesda!  
---
The numbers are just an estimation, based only on what I’ve heard and read other players say. 
---
I personally don't care one way or the other lol. I don't have to cheat or dupe for that to be my opinion, seems like you just want to discredit my valid points with false information. I was simply stating that no matter which way it goes it will have the same problems so leave it how it is so everyone has there choice of how they wish to progress. Either you will get shit on by dupers and cheaters or you will get shit on by the tryhard groups that will take over necessary locations to troll and keep other players from progressing. This game isn't designed or balanced for pvp play (and shouldn't be) so it will fail either way. Players can easily spam stimpaks and other healing items to soak up normal weapon damage and legendary weapons do to much damage that they can't be dealt with, even with the incoming nerfs to ts and explosive. Its a one shot or be one shot pvp environment and no amount of rebalancing will change that without destroying the pve side of things so if you aren't dedicated to being that guy who will one shot everyone you will just end up being the guy crying for more nerfs and changes that won't fix the overall problem.
---
I disagree. This is the mode that many of us wanted/expected since 76 was announced. I really don't want to spend 100+ hours again levelling and repeating all the quest lines to get my character back to the same point.
---
Who the hell is telling them that pvp experience seekers feedback is the feedback to listen to or develop on first?
---
The ui needs action bar customization. That will streamline everything that’s now difficult about reconciling item and inventory usage during live combat. 
---
For the regular game. 
---
The perk ui needs streamlining. 
---
Containers need to be fixed and further implemented. 
---
Trophy / decorating / functional display containers are needed. 
---
A group system for community and rp is needed. 
---
We want TOWNS or BASE. A means of leveling and building as more than just a singular character. 
---
Custom emoting replacement.
---
Server terminal / broadcast.
---
Survival mode will be my first vocal criticism against their choice, so far I’ve had great faith that they brought the game to us to gain player voice even in its vanilla state so we could break it really early. 
---
BUT YOU GUYS NEED TO LISTEN BETTER or it’s for no net benefit to the game. Most players are opposite of who would want a survival mode. Listen to them. Listen to us. 
---
Yeah
---
I am also a fan of blowing up cars for area damage. How is the Ripper? I got a vampire's ripper the other day and sold it.
---
Lol why do people assume so much? 
---
You assume you are getting a rise out of me when really I’m loving watching you pointlessly rant paragraphs and try to call me out when you are mad that you just can’t cuz I won’t entertain your bullshit. 
---
I reply for the pleasure, sorry to disappoint. 💋
---
Oh yeah, it's fucky with stairs. 
---
&gt;Lambskin is more delicate than normal leather. Also makes me curious why they didn't just use a cheaper leather to begin with if they were going to paint it.
---
After the canvas bag fuck-up.
---
They probably had to make it fancy.
---
Disagreements are good!
---
Silence maybe the wrong word, since November for me personally the ITV have seemed like lips service imo. Not one of them really said anything wholesome, if you get me. Just vague statements and trickles of info that seemed more rushed out and designed so they could say look were communicating with you without actually saying anything. Not acknowledging the duping has got under my skin as well, especially after a BETA, the game is cut n paste of FO4 and ESO had exactly the same bug at launch.
---
I think I'm just but hurt that i trusted Todd lol, he said they would get better at communicating and being more open, then they carried on with the vague ITV and nothing else. He hasn't actually spoke up about the game once since that...amost like he trolled us for Xmas sales :(
---
Death Vally or canyon would be cool, wonder if its going to be random waves for survival or maybe Rose sending us in to get some Raider stuff set up for her or something like that. There was 4 of them though in the screen, one in PA (raider) maybe there tank? Speculation is good! New content is good!
---
But that's not true.  I'm not just focused on Nuka Colas. You are seeing through the lens of this one thread. This thread is about how nerfing the 1 cap generated from Nuka Colas is but one part of a multi-part solution. And it is clearly in hindsight. Hence the past tense of the word "fail" in the title. But my focus on this forum has been on duping in general. To respresent me as just focusing on nuka colas as the sole cause of economic malfunction is yet another strawman. Almost every paragraph you've typed thus far has been. I can show you if you want. 
---
Wow, Who the hell is telling them that pvp experience seekers feedback is the feedback to listen to or develop on first?
---
**PLEASE DO NOT ALLOW CHARACTER TRANSFERS.** Its not going to be fun when Dupers have 10000 Stealth Boy Mark III's and are perma-invis griefing all the low level players with TSE weapons in full sentinal/assassin etc etc. 
---
You have two options: 
---
1: COMPLETE SEPARATE SERVERS. NO CHARACTER TRANSFER OR ANYTHING.   
---
2: Allow character transfers BUT you drop EVERYTHING upon death. EVERYTHING. You want to run around in full sets of sentinal/assassin gear with TSE weapons? You mess up one time and someone's gonna be real happy.   
---
I run a community of 30 people and we all want option 1.   
---
***FIX DUPING BEFORE PVP IS RELEASED!!***
---
Why didn't you just say that from the start instead of being arrogant but then implying the OP was being arrogant for their idea?
---
&gt;Literally no one plays this game for pvp.
---
So...
---
Is there any actual source for this or is this just a guess?
---
Exactly buddy. And it's fucking awesome. In all realism, I'm back on ESO. 76 is fun, but full of a very casual player base. Needs better end game content
---
Mods
---
I'd welcome this happily.
---
i have not seen a plan for the scope.  
---
if you get a plan off graham (iirc) you can craft-&gt; scrap to learn it, or farm some harpoon guns to learn it.  there are only like 6 mods for the thing so it shouldnt take to many. (what i did to get the plan)
---

And maybe.

I agree with you, but you really think that they’re wasting their time because *you* won’t play it?

Can someone post a link to whatever you're all talking about because my Google-fu sucks and I can only find people talking about whatever it is.
---
But they've added in all the photo frames stuff in game and i like to see them scrolling on my loading screens. Seems a shame to move them to my pc as id never look at them or do anything with them. 
---
You can have 5 characters at the moment which I'm using all off :)
---
The robobrains are ok, it's the assaultron(s) that kick my ass everytime
---
While I truly hope the new mode will lure the briefer types away, I doubt it will.
---
Griefers are fueled by the tears of other players. They also typically target weaker players or players who are traveling alone. They will find less of this in the survival mode.
---
I doubt much will change in regard to griefers.
---
Mystic_Stylez323 
---
You do realise I was replying to your very own suggestion, which doesn't require the user to name anything, right ?  
---
It doesn't even require the sets name to be stored. Because it can be computed. At runtime. In realtime. Based on what the set is composed of. **The whole point of computed properties.**
---
Not exactly. There was a text prompt  mentioning that a "Brotherhood of Steel" Plan was unlocked after scrapping a piece of Combat armor. Didn't know that it was just the paintjob for the helmet.
---
Mutations aren't that big of a deal, and all have downsides, I wouldn't mind legendary effects if they weren't freely carried over from adventure mode, gonna be tones of people running around in unkillable sentinels armor with god tier weapons from day 1, and you won't stand a chance as a new dweller, they want to encourage new characters, but allowing old ones just means god tier char's running around killing any new dwellers who don't have the gear to compete with them right from the beginning.
---
So don't buy it.  That's my plan. 
---
Sooner or later, there will be a huge discrepancy in  the number of new players vs high level players.
---
2 months from now, people who'd had just bought the game are going to find high level players with legendary op weapons in survival mode. 
---
I know, right? 
---
All I see is thread after thread of people praising the PvP in FO76 and now a few people make a big stink and act like they don't even enjoy it.
---
Glad for the known tag for recipes and plans. Its annoying having to hesitate when i don't know if I have a recipe or plan already.
---
PVP doesn't really interest me so I'm glad there is a server coming that separates. Hopefully they implement changes that work for those who are interested.
---
Kind of disappointed there wasn't anything on the vaults. Was hoping those would come soon though I can wait. I have many side quests and the big finale of the main quest to still do.
---
I can agree to this. Surely. 
---
I was just thinking about this the other day you are right on the money my friend!
---
No I just meant between Survival mode characters and adventure characters.
---
The game was advertised as having PvP. You can’t argue a PvP focus for this game when they never once set up that expectation. I’m not a big fan of PvP in this game but I purchased it understanding that it was a thing. They made it very clear. 
---
It's not hidden information. I know of some and I don't even play FO76.
---
Because it's not called pvp server, it's called survival.
---
The difference would be the possibility to kill or interact friendly.
---
The way it is planed you have either a server where pvp is restricted in a way you don't really have to care if you walk by another player because he can't really damage you without your "permission", or a server where everyone will try to kill you because of k/d ratio and e penis scoreboards.
---
What I was hoping for was just a new mode without restrictions giving players the choice how to interact and if you try to risk to talk to a stranger, or better hide in the bushes until he leaves the area.
---
Maybe I could explain it better this time, my English is a bit rusty and I'm pretty tired, sorry for that. ^^
---
dont put it our with your boots, Ted!
---
What do you have available to you presently?
---
"Are you sure you want to do this?  Once you move your character to Survival, you can't move them back."
---
Done.
---
Haha good luck maxed out characters are allowed to play on them.
---
Anyone can get any mutation, it's not that hard.
---
If you are a cheapskate and don't wanna buy serums just go to the mine near whitespring, sit in the rad barrels just putside the entrance until you get whatever mutation you want.  There's a decon chamber just inside the mine, first door to the right.
---
You think people are just dying to have more pvp or just bored and having a laugh at your expense?
---
People are bored and won't be going to this new "pvp mode". Buckle up.
---
To be fair
---
They are removing two vocal proponents here and hopefully pave the way for actual development instead of constant balancing for ‘PvP’
---
- The pvpers with nothing to do but grief bases
---
- The griefed who keyboard warrior their misadventures at the hands of the former
---
However, bases/townships would be fucking cool
---
That’s not the main menu. On the main menu, there is no way to see which character you have selected. This is a minor point but it is a standard UI feature in every online game ever
---
Did you find it on the Deathclaw or was it lying around?
---
Is
---
I slightly disagree with this. Make it a blank slate with the inventory but keep the player leveling. I do realize that high level players would have quite a few advantages compared to low level ones. However, you have to keep in mind that many if not most people playing the game won't even bother with survival if they have to redo all the leveling and quests (that includes me). I feel that this would be a good compromise between what is going on now and a clean slate. I honestly feel they made their choice based on time-constraints and laziness. There's no way anyone would think it's a good idea to move EVERYTHING from a "PVE" to a "PVP" server. 
---
I have a feeling that changes will be coming to us too to limit the griefing mechanincs.  If they are giving PVP'ers an outlet, it also gives Bethesda an excuse to limit it even more in our mode.  
---
And I am all for that.
---
Above the vault is nukable. Below the vault and west is not. There is a large untouchable area.
---
Yah so would I.  
---
The problem is that nothing is ballanced
---
Most if not all of the Austin studio works on it I believe.
---
You're seriously bitching about people with "god tier" TSE weapons when they're getting nerfed to shit before this mode will even go into testing?
---
And nice try at scaremongering over "level 200" players.  Please enlighten the rest of us to the power level difference between a level 50 and level 200 character?
---
It would be good to have a full open pvp mode. Players would need to start a new character though. One shots are going to be rampant with people able to 1 shot SBQ. They would also have to tune the rules to prevent "two shot explosive instigating" anything from just blowing someone up as well. I would love pvp but the way the game operates doesn't lend itself to it.
---
Finally though, the fact that you make it clear that "fighting other fighters" is only fun for a while and you keep calling things "carebear land" lowers the value of all of this. You're saying that having to actually fight in pvp isn't fun. So are you just looking to kill lowbies? 
---
Regardless, the game needs a mode where seeing a player actually causes tension and creates those moments where you have to make a choice. Right now you see another player and you can just ignore them.
---
I couldn't find a harpoon plan, but after buying several harpoon guns at Harpers Ferry, I took them apart. And I found it! Thank you for your reply.
---
Even fireproof by itself goes a long way. Got into my first PVP fight with somebody and his explosive automatic weapon was mostly chipping me. I died because a random ghoul showed up and distracted me for a bit while I was trying to get out of the way of the explosions.
---
Thank god you arent in charge and bethesda has said the choice to do it this way will stay no matter what yall say.
---
We've spoken before, I'm not sure you understand how legendaries work. I tried to explain it to you once but you got rude and acted like a child so I'll try it again here. Legendaries have multiple affixes and they are as follows, primary, major, minor. There are two more available for the future, but as of yet, they are not in the game. Primary affix only guns are 1 stars. Two star weapons have a primary and a major affix. 3 stars have all 3 categories. A weapon cannot have more than one of each category, being primary major and minor. So when I say explosive is OP, it's in the context of its own category. If it were a primary affix, it'd be just fine after the nerf. TS is getting too much of a nerf, we can both agree on that, but you're a fool if you think either effect alone isn't OP.
---
What about the area across the river from Nelson? If you swim across, there's a hidden canyon in the cliffs that is FULL of deathclaws.
---
It's lazy. 
---
Oof! Cold fingers over here. Thanks for the typo catch!
---
I mean who cares they’re going to dupe anyway or buy TSE weapons off eBay and get their god tier weaponry again so it’s just gonna be the same shit. It’ll just be okay for like 2-3 weeks and then once the assholes are level 100+ it’s gonna be the same shit all over again
---
Yes, that different menu that isn’t the main menu. The main menu shows you nothing about the character you have selected, when it should be showing you that &amp; all the cool stuff you’ve collected. 
---
So your telling me you prefer game mechanics that are purposefully there to slow you down? Tedious speed bumps just to bandaid over the lack of content. My idea which isn't against fallout canon. It just might seem strange to bethesda fans. And it doesn't change whats already a part of the game.

if you have a problem with it then hire a mercenary. no more baby shit. if this bothers you stick to assassins creed
---
Try again in a few minutes at a different station I have this bug all the time
---
I like what I am reading, but I feel characters should be made for Survival or Adventure, NOT both. With the duping fiasco and so many duped TSE and Bobbleheads out there it is really a dumb idea to allow that all to be brought into Survival mode.
---
Off the deathclaw
---
Clearly PvE is the focus when you have to opt into pvp, when there’s hundreds of PvE quests and dozens of PvE events and yet only a handful of pvp events.
---
The OP proposed solution is a little extreme. Character and progress is fine, its the gear itself that needs to stay behind. I deff do not want to have to level to 206 again though this is 100s of hours of leveling progress and like 40 hours worth of quests I completed off the map.  
---
So I propose that you can take your character, his level, his perks that were unlocked, and story progress but you can not bring any items. No aid items, no armor, no weapons, etc.  
---
Bases could also be carried over.  
---
I know that this would be tough to implement across both game states so just separate the game states. Let us import our characters upon first log in from adventure mode but strip that imported character of all gear and items automatically upon load in for the first time in survival.
---
Eh, I'm fine with the current end game, I'm having fun grinding out legendries believe it or not. As for the bobbleheads, My heads probably going to bobble a bit from all the scratching if they don't sort that out before the PvP servers.
---
Because it's in March with no mention of actual new content and the implementation is probably going to be fubar'd no matter which route they go.
---
Won’t be a Bethesda game without constant server disconnects and bugs
---
This is how it is already. That is why you need a 3rd party to transfer
---
I agree with workshops, but restrict pvp to the area around the workshop,not the whole world
---
Look. http://imgur.com/gallery/qpcwJgM
---
The main menu should tell you which character you have selected. Right now it provides no information. It should also display a cool profile of your character and their current gear, but that’s advanced level (ie. present in every other MMO I have ever played)
---
Once Bethesda pretty much eliminates the PVP aspects unless you are in survival, I'll be riding smooth, thanks.  
---
Have fun with the other griefers.
---
I just don't understand the decision to allow existing characters into survival mode servers. I mean when have existing characters ever been allowed to switch back and forth, even in FO4? Bethesda realized it was too easy to level a character to max level on non-survival and then switch over, and that was a *single-player* game. It is exponentially more stupid to allow that in a multiplayer game.
---
I don't think they have "wasted" resources that much. Their planned "Survival" implementation doesn't look like it took much to create / implement. 
---
Because Bethesda has proven to be oh so trustworthy
---
You were able to glitch through the scenery using P.A

Why is this a thing in this game

This happened to me And I have no idea what caused it. Just walked up to the computer and the door opened

I removed my PA mod 2 days ago after a huge string of crashes. Since then they have remained as consistent. I don’t use multi accounts to run, but only when pushing off junk to my mules and the majority of my crashes happen when I’m logged into only one account. 
---
Yes, I get disconnected every 2- 2:30 minutes over and over again for some times 5 times or more in a row while trying to reconnect. This has been extremely common. 
---
Often I’ll be just walking or running and the game freezes and closes, I reopen and upon logging into server I’ll get another crash as the screen loads the world. 
---
There are several times a day where I get kicked, attempt to reconnect, get in and move around for less than a minutes before a crash. 
---
After reading through my non troll comments today it seems I should look at my specs to see where there issue lies cuz no one else is reporting having my issue on this extreme level that I can find. 
---
why?  People were level 100 inside a week anyways at launch
---
Not a bad theory. But man, they could have avoided this whole thing by just announcing it like two weeks out if they were worried about that, right?
---
Your are mostly likely talking to... a duper. A duper who will say whatever is needed to push the scales toward allowing him a new market. 
---
Try some Bikram Yoga.
---
Leader-boards will always bring competitive people and casuals who think they are on the competitive level. At the least it will be the only reason people play FO76 if they don't add more endgame to Adventure mode. 
---
I agree in part. 
---
I am looking forward to PvP server and the element of risk that will come with that. 
---
As for player trading.... I think in the initial demo videos this was shown. I imagine they couldn’t implement it successfully at launch and now with all the duping problems that they haven’t really got under control yet they want to be extra carful before releasing something that could be open to abuse. That is just my speculation though so you never know! 
---
I don't think you have sway with bethesda...its the players upvoting this that do. They think it will change the fact they get killed in pvp all the time and want to blame the games design for there lack of "skill". They don't want to farm the proper gear and use the right perks to pvp and they think a fresh start will fix that. Hell, most of them probably don't even use the Fireproof perk (smart pvp'ers do) yet they still cry for nerfs.
---
That's such a small proportion of the player base though. Most of us have jobs and don't have time to level another character just because a couple dupers got themselves OP gear. It will just result in no casual players even trying the mode because they don't want to have to start the game again from scratch just to enjoy the drama and danger of pvp that Todd originally spoke about at announcement. 
---
I wasnt joking, I'm having more issues now than when it was released. Me and a mate play every Friday night and since the last patch one of us ends up invisible forcing them to leave the server and rejoin several times a night. Without fail we get kicked from servers. For the first couple of months I never had a crash, until the latest patch.
---
I love the game but I dont think these guys can fix the issues, each time they try they break something else.
---
That definitely seems plausible. Good point, I really hope you’re right.
---
Look at [this post from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aj2jmd/pvp_in_fallout_76_what_it_is_and_how_it_can_be/). The DAY BEFORE Bethesda drops this announcement like a wet turd on hot pavement, this guy comes out with what is by all accounts a well-reasoned, well thought-out PvP design that sounds like it could make a lot of players very happy.
---
It hurts to think about what coulda been.
---
Have you ever played an MMO? They separate out pvp, pve, and rp. People need to stop treating this game likes it's not an mmo.
---
This is awful, I can see why you're frustrated. If you want a hand to get through it again and on xbox one. I'll tag along. Level 130 so should be able to keep things relatively orderly. 
---
In the next patch will the animal taming bug where they take up parts of your stored build budget in camp be addressed?
---
I have a phantom 50% of my budget "stored" that I can't use because some of my tamed animals died and I moved locations. 
---
Head to the pumpkin House at the top of the map in the Savage divide region then have a look around there, if no luck have an adventure around the area and look for a tower (this will be Halloween filled and can spawn the witch costume and skeleton costume
---
Even ignoring made up numbers. Is no one else worried about the complete lack on new PVE content? Bethesda isn’t proving to be super fast at releasing content updates, so if they focus on this pvp mode until march, then spend another few months working out the inevitable bugs and balancing issues we may see some pve content by August?
---
Seriously there is no end game anything currently (don’t even try to say the queen is end game) and some half assed attempt at a pvp mode isn't going to keep me around. So many BA games out there these days if all i want to do is shoot people.
---
Todd Howard is a hype man. He's like every other hype man out there and basically every major games company has one. I don't know why people fixate on him so much haha... I just ignore most of what he says that isn't basic information and move on. Obsessing over someone is not healthy (but then many people who get outraged on the net aren't healthy either lol).
---
As to the ITV reports, I get what you're saying. They have been a bit flimsy and more like kinda-sorta-teasers. I will give them props for the bug coverage though, they've fixed a shitload and are pretty good about outlining that in recent reports. But, of course, as stated in the title of my post, I want to see much more from them. xD
---
I think your guess for the crag is a good one. I noticed that the characters all look like raiders, so good call thinking of Rose. My first reaction was that it will be a kind of gauntlet where you're running through toward some objective(s) and being constantly attacked by crazy shit. :D
---
Griefers? This is exactly what Bethesda wanted. You decide good and evil.
---
Make it into 3 modes. Adventure, survival and survival only. Players who dont want to regrind for their gear can still enjoy the new mode and those who decide they want a fresh start can play the survival only mode where character stats and items are non transferable.
---
I appreciate it, although I’m on pc and trying to do my first play through solo. Thanks though :D
---
How did you find 4 diamond items? They cap out at 3 diamonds that you are able to find without applying a legendary mod, which afaik there is only the sacrificial blade for melee
---
Lose double the caps and your aid items in the process. No thanks. 
---
Yup, one step forward....two back.
---
And that short list above is all they've got?
---
Nah they can't all work on it can they surely? Usually after a game launches the cut the dev team down to bare bones and leave them to work on whatever is next etc. 
---
Unless the Austin studio is literally 4 people these days :(
---
Are you a Masochist? If so, Buy. If not, move on and wait for it to cost 19.99 cause that’s how much it’s worth... and I paid 79.95... 
---
 Who the hell is telling them that pvp experience seekers feedback is the feedback to listen to or develop on first?
---
Most players are opposite of who would want a survival mode. RP/casuals and hardcore meta “end gamers” - Listen to them. Listen to us. For the regular game. 
---
The ui needs action bar customization. Like for fixing quick heal, grenade throw, gun bash. That will streamline everything that’s now difficult about reconciling item and inventory usage responsiveness during live combat. 
---
We want TOWNS (teamwork oriented wasteland neighborhood system) or BASE- A means of leveling and building as more than just a singular character. 
---
Survival mode will be my first vocal criticism against their choices, so far I’ve had great faith that they brought the game to us to gain player voice even in its vanilla state so we could break it really early. 
---
BUT YOU GUYS NEED TO LISTEN BETTER or it’s for no net benefit to the game.
---
Lol I know exactly what you mean. It’s annoying sometimes
---
You didn’t initially have to opt in to PvP. They were very clear that PvP existed and was part of the focus. There’s thousands of PvE quests in other games with PvP. That’s not a valid argument. 
---
Here is the blocked off area
---
[https://imgur.com/UWvR1Ql](https://imgur.com/UWvR1Ql)
---
I might believe that if they were ready to launch it with the next patch. Until I saw they’d be working on it until March, and in March it would be released in beta, meaning it will still see a lot of developer attention for months afterwards.
---
I'm trying to find the coherent sentence in your ranting and I just can't. 
---
What's that menu called? Just for reference, since it has all my tabs for characters, settings, atom shop, etc.
---
If you like Fallout games, it worth the purchase. If you are a expecting a well polished balanced game without bugs, you should be cautious.
---
People don't want to hear the truth. They just want to virtue signal harder.
---
Your reductionist Highlander apocalypse cool story while pretending not to care really seems like you care. 
---
Agree with OP. There is too much wrong to allow people with their god gear to migrate over to survival mode. You need to embrace that you have two separate modes that are vastly different and treat them as such. Progress bleeding between the two is a horrible idea. 
---
In fairness, they did say that level scaling during fights will mean lower level players will also be a threat. I don't have great faith in the implementation of that, though, to be honest. If it worked well, it also just sort of seems like everyone's equally threatening, at which point it would have made more sense to force new character creation...
---
So what's to stop people from simply twinking their alts with God-gear?
---
I mean, I wouldn't say that. I see it as two steps forward one step back (not considering anything from survival).
---
But how did these two incredibly obvious bugs get pass someone if they did test the update? 
---
Lol I'm at 99 for my level now and those were the first places I went to when I started. Only the Witch hat spawns at those locations. There are plans for an actual costume that spawn on a dead trick or treater as a random encounter 
---
World of Warcraft had pvp servers.  You had all that the pve servers had but pvp was always one.  You had to make a new character, or pay money to transfer one over with a limit on how much money you could bring.  I think that since it was the number one mmo for so long that it would be smart to copy that.  Huge difference though for WoW vs Fallout is that WoW had factions, Fallout doesn’t.  My suggestion would be to add some joinable factions to reduce it being a free for all, and establish allegiances for players.
---
So now people will be storing more Aid items in the stash as well......
---
Then why be here...? 
---
I have a chameleon left leg I believe, a marksman handmade, quite a bit of steel and rubber. And that's all I remember 
---
My guess is the game engine can't handle a true vehicle. But since this is a online game they should just treat mounts like power armor. 
---
u/ladydevann
---
Did you only read the title and misinterpreted? Come on, I want them to reconsider the caps loss and the broken scaling. They're the ones plannong to double the caps.
---
I think internally they called it the “provides no information without user input” menu, which seems unwieldy 
---
Needed
---
Unfortunately you're going to have to blame these delays on the dupers, cause it's hard to determine server stability when people are having million weight mules instead that crash servers. Once they fully eliminate exploits and duper mules, they can work on giving us the space that they've currently been taking up. 
---
You might not like this answer, so I'm expecting down votes, but it's the truth. 
---
Until then learn to live within your means.
---
They should have a limited pool of weapons. Remove the stupid things straight away like rolling pins and drills. Remove double effect legendaries. Have a pool of limited guns of varying strength so pvp is based on skill and not gear. 
---
u/furysevensix
---
Clean slate or don't bother.
---
We can probably work something out. When will you be online?
---
This isnt coming out till March. We will likely get DLC before then.
---
Because I lost track of which topic i was talking in lol. Was having 2 conversations about the same thing and split them up on accident.
---
&gt;if everyone started on equal footing..
---
I agree with your point wholeheartedly, however, there will ALWAYS be this problem. You can start on the same footing but inevitably people will always outlevel you. 
---
The only solution is exactly what WoW did with their PvP arenas, make it to where you only need to fight people 10 levels above you, in level bracketed instances.
---
It's the only way to ensure no one will be on uneven footing.
---
Scaling is a bad idea, nobody wants to remake there lvl 250 just to compete in pvp.
---
u/valseek
---
I’ve been playing since day 1 beta and PvP has always been opt in. And I would argue that in all the games you’re referring to, that PvE is the main focus. You say I don’t have a valid argument but do you even have an argument?
---
What? What happened? Can someone catch me up to speed? 
---
That really is bad, griefers stopping you from doing the quest is what happened there. You can server hop to try and avoid and check the map to see who's nearby before starting it.
---
I've got a lvl 150ish and a few other high level characters, ave played pretty much from launch and this is the first time I've seen or heard about that being a problem in that area like that. It definitely isn't the norm, try not to let it put you off and go get dem nukes!
---
On ps4 otherwise would offer to run interference for you but you'll be fine next run!
---
No I agreed with you. The way it reads right now is you will lose double caps + aid. it's aboslutely moronic and overly punishing. 
---
Agree with you mate. I want to have a new char for PvP. But i also want that for everybody.
---
&gt; Have you ever played an MMO?
---
Have you ever played an unspecified MMO that I am using as an anecdote to support my position? They don't segment the player base and instead everyone plays under the same ruleset, PvP might be always on, occur in specific zones or is explicitly opt-in by both parties.
---
Agreed I’ve loved this game since beta have no issues with what has happened up to this point but then they drop this shitbomb on us and it just makes me less interested in any future updates 
---
yeah, pretty sure there is.  Psycho + bufftats, but I don't recall of the top of my head if you need to find the recipe or not.
---
I just want this is the game! 😂
---
I don't know man, there's even a neat little box on the top right that provides all kinds of fun information without my input or consent.
---
Yepp they need to clarify that message window to let people know that slap damage will not apply if someone tries to cap your workshop or vice versa.
---
I know it was a bit of a shock to me the first time I got ganked without intiating pvp or so I thought. I was just glad buddy was dealing with my turrets and I was able to run back grab my loot and run away with him hot on my heels, and that eventually a pair of players took a couple shots and sent him running for the hills.
---
Because a great many players have stuck with the game since beta and they don't want to make new characters for the sake of having (at best) 48 hours of level playing field. 
---
Names for random unique stuff is really cool with this
---
No it hasn't. They added pacifist in a later patch.
---
My argument is that they literally said PvP was a focus in the game. Why you think you can speak for the game over the people that made it is beyond me. Coming into a game and wanting it to be something it was never advertised to be is silly and setting yourself up for disappointment. 
---
Wait a minute 
---
You don't like the Ferrari analogy? Here's one more your speed -- you don't get to go to McDonalds and demand that they reduce the price of the Big Mac to 50 cents, because you'd buy so many more.  Your advice isn't helpful to McDonalds, who certainly know more than you, a random internet person, on how best to maximize sales profits. Nobody asked for your advice in the first place, yet here you are offering it, unsolicited.  Said advice, when it comes down to it, is that you don't want to pay them the value of their work.  
---
It's not a hyperbole. You're demanding that a company take their existing plans -- for which you have absolutely zero context as to how they were developed -- and throw them out the window because you want everything right now, and you don't want to pay for it. That's called being greedy my dude.    
---
I'm sure there will be lots of 'good' players in PVP.  
---
Actually, there might be.  The ones that like to hunt raiders.  Might be even better with factions.  
---
I'll guess it might end up being a struggle of good v evil, which would be great for all of the 'bored' people looking for something to do.  
---
Bonus is you can harass anyone you see, just for laughs, and not be considered a d*ck for doing it.  
---
There's an RP world just waiting for you.
---
I don’t write them down no, I just share them with my team when the game works well enough to stay connected. If I can stay connected long enough to play and share that experience so it can resonate, I likely wouldn’t have bothered sharing this depressing info. 
---
But maybe you are right. Maybe I’ll start just blending that in with the rest.
---
Wait, what is going on now? Isn't the game a survival game already? Why do you need a survival mode? 
---
Fog of war too! 
---
They're fixing it next patch
---
There is a perk card. if it's not in intelligence it's in strength
---
Don’t tell me what to do, devil woman!
---
Scaling should be effective up till lvl 35 or so and only to a fixed percentage. It's the scaling at lvl 50+ that makes no sense.
---
Adding standalone pvp mode is just a Petri dish festering with people who are even more adamantly going to be in adventure mode shitting all over people who have no interest in PvP 
---
Maybe insert a ”send crashreport” when the game crashes instead of me having to navigate through Beth external services, find the right section, type what happend instead of having an error code and then get a Bethesda bot reply. Over the different versions i have been crashing straight to desktop with varying frequence. Some versions of the game has been quite stable regarding crashes.
---
My hardware is as new as the game actually and does not strain at all from the game but to what use i wonder... when i keep crashing. It is a wonder i have reached lvl 250 like this.... and that i havent trashed my keyboard.
---
True but better to have a level playing field at day one then never having an even playing field at all.
---
And yeah they won't be hunting me alone as the only way I'd play this mode is with a group or not at all ;)
---
You know, I'm not sure this is going to be a productive discussion if you insist on thinking things through logically.
---
Griefing isn’t so bad, we can just block and go elsewhere. 
---
Best games in history had so many feature and bug patching before any pvp systems and modes beyond the vanilla flagging options were implemented
---
The survival announcement says that it won't launch until March. That gives them some time to fix the current duping bugs before it launches.
---
Damn, a TSE black powder. Really want one of those
---
Respect that! Well try not to be too disheartened. Get another key card and go again. Launch that nuke wherever you like lol. 
---
To get them out of my PVE mode.
---
I rather have them dying in Survival then trolling me.
---
I hear that the new car smell is off gassing of cancerous industrial glue. 
---
This guy gets it!
---
Some people have reported that duping exploits still exist, they are just harder to do.
---
I think that's a negligible proportion of the player base tbh. I see your point but I'm sure there's others like me that really want to play survival mode but don't have time to relevel my character/repeat quests.
---
I would prefer to have a couple asshole dupers around than having a dead game mode because thousands of more casual players don't want to have to restart the game from scratch just to enjoy the game as it was described at announcement. 
---
It gets boring &amp; repetitive real fast. Their isn’t nearly as much to do as in previous fallout games. Not to mention you get disconnected from the server every time a super mutant farts. Theirs like 10 better games coming out this year, including Crackdown 3 &amp; Anthem next month. I would just save your money and wait on something else honestly.. and this is coming from a huge long time fan of the series. This game just doesn’t feel right imo.
---
Hahaha well, neighbors gets a special threatment.. :P
---
I personally love the game, so much to see and do. I you love fallout buy the way. Stop watch negative reviews they just there mostly to get people click baiting them. I play every night and continue to enjoy the game, it's the only thing I play. Sure it's far from perfect, but it also has some really cool and amazing things. They will hopefully continue to improve. 
---
Server disconnects and crashes are the worst part of the game, then the dupers and griefers which can be managed. lots of chronic bad design decisions that boggle the mind, but a lot of good design decisions as well. 
---
Get the game on sale, it is definitely worth your time even if short lived. You either going to love it or hate it but that's with any game. I am and continue to enjoy my experience in FO76, I can't go back to FO4, but I am hoping and dreaming of future changes ..
---
Thank you for making this thread, I've been at work and it was the first thing that came into my head.
---
I cannot upvote this enough.
---
Back on the track, ign: warlord89
---
Duping's been about since launch though, how much time do they need and ofc that's time that could be used for something else :(
---
Disregard an entire discussion point against your case, and just say its ranting?
---
You're a fucking moron.
---
A perk card for radaway?
---
I killed the one in the Ash Heap. Good ol' cat meat.
---
I wouldn’t really want to take my adventure character anyway because you can lose more than junk. I will never bet my armour or guns in a fight even if I’m 130. I’d rather just start a new character and be able to transfer stuff I’m prepared to lose to my new account 
---
You're right, there has been excessive looting of TSE, I'm just saying that not every person using an explosive weapon is a duper/bought a duped weapon. 
---
because people who dupe like to tell people so they can sell things to them. especially when they see my armor and offer things to allow them to dupe it
---
the current popular one is apparently a 3 person method but i didnt care to pay attention to the details
---
perk card for all chems. 
---
Yeah, there's the clear sign of someone with a winning argument.
---
Oh okay. My bad. While I don't mind losing a stimpak once in a while, losing my entire stash of caps to low lvl sniper in camouflage is a no no.
---
Just like *literally every other game with a hardcore mode every.*
---
Transfers go one way only. OFF hardcore servers.
---
Easy if you like fallout games and don’t have huge expectations like 90% of gamers now days then give it a go especially if you like the occasional hilarious glitch, if you hate it you can always refund it (if it’s not a console port) or give it to a mate and play some other games. 
---
I personally like the game but by no means thinks it’s a “great” game, everyone has different tastes so you can’t please everyone but the game has pleased me..so far.
---
I get what your saying. it'd be nice to just have a little render of your current character in the background of the main menu.
---
Yea, Travelling Pharmacy. I have it, but RadAway isnt included for some reaosn
---
Sorry to hear that! 
---
called traveling pharmacy in strength
---
I care to the extent that I want to see it done right so people will see that it isn't the games fault or balancing issue that is why they are doing poorly in PvP (although I highly doubt they will). 
---
I don't even take pvp serious myself and really don't enjoy it much but when i get a bounty for whatever reason and some lvl 180 comes to kill me with his two shot explosive shotgun in power armor and does garbage damage to me because I have 4 sentinel pieces with lone wander and fireproof on and he rages and calls me a cheater when I two shot him with an instigating lever action it kinda irritates me. The game isn't why over half the players are doing shit in pvp, its simply because they are shitty at pvp lol.
---
that's odd... it is for me.
---
You already can't one shot players through slap damage so we're good. 
---
I feel it would still be soft giving any low level a advantage. They can level in adventure mode if they desire. Lawless if fun to me.  
---
This is a bug. If you see the nuke circle there it is definitely landing elsewhere. 
---
Super mutants are green
---
Mutant slayers are neat
---
I have a mutant slayer explosive
---
"RETREEEEAAAAAT!"
---
Theres gonna be a 76 survival mode?
---
Yeah it would be nice to not have to check the character selection menu each time to verify who character is active.
---
If they do allow current characters they shouldn't allow any legendaries to carry over. Personally, I would prefer they make everyone start from scratch. 
---
Remove svav too ?:D
---
I think they should be focusing on more content for the existing game rather than a survivor mode. I enjoy playing this game but there just needs to be more quests and stuff to do in general like the older fallouts. 
---
Currently it does not.
---
As far as I have been told.
---
This would be an absolutely pointless stopgap.
---
Unless you have periodic PvP server resets in less than 3 weeks it'll be exactly where the main servers are now.
---
PvP needs to be rebalanced in its entirety, especially the level scaling system. 
---
As a non-pvper I would be interested if we got to start with a clean slate.  My level 70 with a plain lever action rifle could not complete against the  Melee one shot 150+ level crowd.  Start fresh and it could be fun!
---
The second day of the BETA I had rifle that was maxed out on damage mods. It was the most damage my level 25 could put out. I saw someone that was twice my level plinking scorched with a .38 pea shooter pistol. I did a decent sliver of health damage. He killed me in like 2 hits. So I have my doubts on the PvP level balancing. I am sure it is there. I am also sure it doesn't really work as advertised. 
---
I'm preeeeeeeeety sure YOU fucked you over. Stop trying to get people to pile on this game over your own mistake of missing the refund window.
---
Exactly my thoughts. Hardcore griefers will have the same advantages they do in Adventure within a short period of time. It's all down to the way BGS manages scaling, I think.
---
Yes I think up to intelligence level 20 you get 200% durability, which also affects the armor resists and weapon damage on melee weapons. Though that 200% is the same as Fix it Good and Weapon Artisan, and as it degrades it falls back down to 100% and normal values.
---
It's glitched currently.
---
Works for some, not all players.
---
It's like they've never played GTA V or another game mode where you can kill people without real repercussions.
---
Oh crap really? I had been there a few times and I'd server hop for it and found them both, though this was quite a while ago before the server hopping was patched, thought that it may have worked 
---
Pfft and how about no armor. Every weapon is the same and everyone gets the same amount of ammo so no one has an edge. Make all the foods and drink do nothing too why don't ya? Jesus. 
---
You think the playing field will stay even long enough for you to enjoy it ?  You will go to bed or head to work and others will keep playing. Teams will coordinate builds and divide loot. Better not have trading then huh? This is not a solution.  You will be back here bitching about the next thing needing a nerf or buff. 
---
Separate us by level. Highs with highs only. If all the highs with shit characters and poor gear want to start all over, have at it. 
---
I have to agree for the most part. I will start with this new server setup. It will hopefully if done right draw alot of griefers and pvp players to it away from us. Giving us a better experience.
---
Although really would love see new content by now. Been out of content for about a month now. It's fine i have been spending most of my time just helping others. Its something i really enjoy so it will do me for a long time.
---
But really getting bored in general and i don't find pvp is 76 enjoyable and it does not make sense. But i guess when they say rebuild America and best and brightest. They went we are a punch of serial killers that were able to hold off our urges for 20 years.
---
From my point of view my description stands.
---
I have more issues, bugs, disconnects &amp; crashes now than release day.
---
Not really talking or care about the platform cross play debate, just wanted fellow adventures in my wasteland journey! Xbox
---
We use the cross pad.
---
Less food, chems, and water too
---
Pics or it didn't happen.
---
Like I said I’ve played since day 1 of beta and pacifist mode has always been there. Coming into a game that every predecessor was single player PvE gives me all the reason to believe it will be primarily PvE focused. 
---
Please link or screenshot where they said “PvP is a focus”.
---
Ok I’ll add you. Probably getting game sometime in February currently playing destiny 2
---
Roses are red,  
---
Violets are blue,  
---
This doesn't rhyme,  
---
But it aught to
---
You have to find recipes for drugs. Is this one you can find though. I can buy psychotats, but I want to make them. 
---
Hi everyone,   
---
Thank you for all of the feedback so far on the details we posted about Survival mode earlier today! We'll make sure your thoughts about the mode here and in the future are shared with the dev team. The article mentions this already, but I wanted to restate that we're still iterating and actively working on Survival mode, so things aren't necessarily set in stone, and your continued feedback will very important to us as we move toward beta, and eventually release.   
---
This is also just the beginning of the conversation. We'll be looking to share more about the new mode with you in Inside the Vault, streams, and other means, and also talk more with you about what you'd like to see in Survival mode as we move forward.   
---
Thanks and please keep the feedback coming!
---
It will be fixed in the next patch.  
---
Thank God you were wrong, godspeed pal, lay waste on other folks and prepare for their rants :)
---
You guys have lost your collective minds. In six months when little Timmy gets FO76 for his birthday he’ll start a survival character and then what....enough time has passed for the amorphous slugs of the world to already have level 100’s doing the EXACT same thing you guys are talking about to him. Instead, he can play a non-PvP map until his character is strong enough to actually have fun in this game mode. 
---
Seriously, this is a game mode people will be joining for the sole purpose of killing others. This is not a game mode meant for doing quests with PvP barriers down. When I bring in my character, I’m hunting you down. When I’m playing adventure mode I’m fucking off and having fun.
---
If it makes you feel better, neither can my level 110 heavy gun main.
---
Yes, it looks like it based on how they are describing it.
---
This makes it prime for having a clean slate for those servers with fresh characters only. 
---
This is the same to me as saying everybody with high-level characters in the old mode should have them stripped. When anyone starts the game in any mode all they can hope is they don't run across higher-level characters spiking the power of all the enemies around them and if they don't get their ass kicked and they can only hope to find weaklings like themselves or else they die and that's the nature of survival gaming. Grow up and have a pair.
---
You have a lot of great ideas but my two major disagreement would be all plans learned up front and junk-only stashes. Storage should remain largely the same because I don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t be able to find and share weapons with friends. A full wipe and restart would obviously be necessary for this to work though. 
---
I agree that factions should play a major part in the free-for-all servers and I think each major faction should have a hub to spawn from. I would like to see ESO style control points or settlements that we fight to maintain control of based upon which faction we are joined or allied with. Workshops are a perfect example of such a control point but there would need to be good incentives to capture and hold them. Plans or unique craft-able skins could be a part of the incentives as well as weapon, armor, and cap drops. 
---
I think the worst possible scenario would a simple fresh restart with free-for-all PVP but everything else remaining the same. I honestly kinda lean towards thinking that may be what we get considering the lack of interesting content created so far. This game has been a let down in so many ways I struggle to remain hopeful that they have something great in store for us just around the corner. I may be wrong about that and I hope that it’s just pessimistic thoughts. I really want this game to thrive in the way that ESO has because I thought that’s what the game would be. I thought it was going to be ESO type  mechanics with Fallout gameplay and aesthetics. 
---
End game gear evolves with allocation. You don’t need perfect sets of armor or weapons if you’re competing with others who are also working with near “ideal” gear. Calling something end game and talking about it In your way makes you appear entitled to the opportunities it provides, which I don’t see as necessary for most players.  This game was designed to be a survival mode, where you craft your own gear.  Starting off with the best items in the game, devalues a lot of what 76 has to offer in terms of immersion
---
&gt; Your microeconomic hypotheticals do not warrant the kind of fix simply because your personal faith is shaken. The kinds of people who will be engaging in the majority of trade will not have access to the kind of alt accounts to generate the cap reserves to truly tank the economy.
---
In other words, don't apply the proposed fix (absurdly in the past) because this person is basing it solely on faith. Right, I'm basing it on an exploit. Strawman
---
&gt; You said prices are out of whack, but you show hypotheticals and fear mongering instead of specific examples. Because you're chicken littling is duping your personal doubt faster than anyone can ever dupe caps.
---
My hypotheticals were great examples. The first, finding an ultra rare item and being compensated accordingly while not condoning cheating. The second, being paid in fair exchange for time well spent. But if you don't like them so be it. Not surprised though.
---
&gt; And yet there is a substantial amount of legitimate trade. Which you will seem potentially suspicious simply because you don't know if you're being taken advantage of. With anyone. Ever.
---
Given reason to be suspicious I will be suspicious knowing full well that the system is still broken. As before the point is to have confidence by eliminating cheating. Has nothing to do with my ability to trust in general. Another strawman
---
&gt; So let's kill nuka colas for all so you can feel better.
---
Punishing everyone so I can feel better is a misrepresentation yet again.  Another strawman. Having an economy where cheaters don't come out on top is why I proposed to remove the 1 cap.
---
////////////////////////////////////
---
&gt; You keep doing you and get as much hyperbole and fear mongering as you can into the blender so you can drink your daily dose of chicken little smoothies.
---
But I didn't espouse fear or exaggerate. What I did was propose stopping people from printing money in hindsight since Bethesda took it's sweet time fixing duping (still not fixed). What sounds less egregious. Remove the 1 cap until duping is fixed or keep the 1 cap and let the printing of money continue. Another strawman 
---
&gt; You don't even have stats to back up your claims. Just anecdotal conjecture.
---
I need stats to make the claim that people being able to print their own money is bad for an economy? Riiiight. Strawman #5.
---
///////////////////////////////////////////////
---
&gt; How many people are doing it? How many caps have been generated? How many people have loaded all 5 regular accounts up to 25k and started on a second account?
---
Do these numbers matter? If only small number of people were able to generate infinite caps they'd be able to have an unfair advantage in the market. Misrepresenting the issue by making it about the number of people or statistics is a strawman since it's was about stopping printing money through a simple fix. 
---
&gt; You push the fact that it's possible with the fear that everyone is doing it. Or at least that you can't trust trading either anyone because you can't be assured they didn't.
---
I never said it was everyone. I said I had no way of knowing. This is a strawman. You misrepresent my position. That's what a strawman is. Misrepresenting a person's position.
---
&gt; Your conjecture is that it's a widespread problem. You have no specific facts or evidence. No one doubt that duping happens and that it's a problem. But your lack of ability to trust is personal and not indicative of systemic issues.
---
Two things. Given the complete lack of data published by Bethesda, I have only this forum, youtube, and the experiences of myself to go on. The degree to which it is rampant is less important than the fact that it exists and even a small amount of players who can obtain wares without effort will have an unfair advantage in the market.
---
And thus far it seems relatively normal for people to dupe both in and out of game. To what degree I don't know, and neither do you. But to declare that it solely my inability to trust is yet another strawman. There is more to it than simply an issue with me. It is an issue about cheating, and how it **could** have been slowed down in the past (hence past tense) 
---
&gt; You push the notion of 200 cap TSE miniguns like that is the norm. It's not. Soke may have been. But not commonplace in the normal market where they're still going for 1.5k to 2.5k. Why so low? Partly duping increasing supply. Partly the upcoming fixes that will cripple them decreasing demand. Partly the fact that other things are out performing them. less resource intensive or have more potential upside.
---
Your anecodote versus mine. The actual numbers don't matter. The gist that duping drops the value dramatically was lost on you. Wasting time worrying about exact numbers in this regard is yet another strawman because you're obsfucating the issue under a bunch of pointless text.
---
&gt; And nowhere did I declare victory.
---
Every use of a strawman to obsfucate the issue is a victory for you. That's why people use them. The mental shortcut to feeling an upperhand in an argument that the strawmen provides is what makes the strawman so appealing to those that use such tactics
---
&gt; Those things you miss out on, whining about the sky falling because of duped nuka colas shaking your faith in the almighty cap.
---
Misrepresenting the effortless duping of caps for me having some irrational deistic cap fetish.... Kinda personal attackey too, like most of what you wrote this is a strawman. Everything you wrote today was
---
There is much better pvp games out, such as Rust. I'm going to have fun with it, but I don't see it taking off, too many flaws in the game to be competitive pvp. I agree resources in the wrong place. 
---
Maybe Beth will be removing more PVP aspects for us, like no CAMP destruction or PVP outside a workshop area.  
---
Yeah, some people will just be d*cks, and we will all have to block them.  
---
I wonder if enough people block someone, would they even be able to find a server to play on since they won't be loaded on one where someone has blocked them.
---
On Xbox One at least I've noticed that when it pops up to 25000 I can just pull the right trigger 3 or 4 times to get it directly to zero.
---
PS4 / Bethesda id: Joeyshabadoo / Support ticket# 190123-002751

 I had a surplus of fusion cores (5+) prior to the last patch. Over the weekend, I noticed they had disappeared from my stash and inventory. At the same time, they began to run out of power very quickly (faster than 1-2% per minute of game play), and when I find them, they're almost always at 30%. I now spend all of my in-game time server hopping to farm a fusion core, so that I can keep the PA running long enough to find another. In other words, the game is now unplayable for my character. 
---
Perhaps instead going a route that simply lets you know how many people are in each region. And only after you've joined the Enclave, so that way there is a rational reason why you'd be able to know such things. Their scanners.
---
It’s weird, when I go to 25000 it won’t let me go back. I have to back out of that set and try again
---
I do think that wanted players should be seen on the map. That would make feeling wanted terrifying. With the bounty doubled I feel it would make the bounty system more competitive and fun. 
---
If they make it so camps cannot be attacked by players, once they stabilize the survival mode servers, then I’m all for it.  Assholes need their own playpen.
---
That kind of discounting is actually against consumer practices regulations in some parts of the world.

# Unfair trading, trade descriptions and pricing FAQs
---
## 18. What are the rules on claiming that products are in a sale or on special offer?
---
Broadly, any price comparisons of this kind must not be misleading. For example:
---
* to claim that products are on sale, you should show the previous price and should have been selling at that price for a meaningful period of time
---
* you must not claim a discount against the recommended retail price (RRP), if the RRP is significantly higher than the price generally charged for the product
---
* you should not claim that you are selling at an introductory price if you plan to continue selling at that price indefinitely, or to stop selling the product after the introductory period
---
Some unfair sales practices are specifically banned: for example, pretending to have a closing down sale. You may want to take advice to ensure that any special offers or sales you plan meet the legal requirements.

---
99 bugs in Bethesda’s new game, 99 bugs in the game, take one down patch it around, 107 bugs in the game 
---
A agree, although I've never duped or purchased an item. I'm pretty bummed that the only way to make it fair and fun is with a reset. It sucks that losers to whom fair play is anathema set the tone for everyone, but alas, here we are. I guess it's not too bad, I've already ran out of content, this will give a chance for a hopefully more challenging experience, from the beginning. Still. Sucks that I have to give up my character who was all grind to get to where he is to stop cheaters from ruining the game. Bleh. 
---
If I could find the Terminal plans, I'd be for it.
---
Then just stay in adventure mode.
---
Nobody is forcing you to restart unless you want to try a different way to play.
---
Where did I say everyone was even? I said a smaller pool of items. No one needs to grind for legendaries to get hunters or trouble shooters lead pipes. Or a 3 star rolling pin with faster swing speed. I'm saying eliminate the waste. 
---
Obviously people who play more should be better at the game. Time invested should pay off. 
---
And I said there should be servers grouped by level or skill rating. You can play 300 and be level 150 hours and still suck at aiming. Or play for 50 hours, be level 25 and hit every shot. Hence skill based ratings are always better. 
---
Use it all.
---
Lightning is kinda... Strange. https://imgur.com/gallery/SJvv31R
---
Not what you want, I want exactly this. But completely fresh from the start. 
---
How I see it is that pvpers will play on survival but gather resources on the relatively peaceful adventure mode so we, those of us left on adventure mode, are still server hopping for stuff like savages.
---
It's a game... so it is fun... but it's a buggy game, so sometimes shit breaks.  It's a fallout game without the ability to reload a save... you're just stuck with it if something shitty happens.
---
Find people to roll with and it's a lot more entertaining.  However, there's a LOT less content in 76 than previous fallout titles.  So, don't expect the solo just doing missions stuff to last long.
---
And yeah, it's a game, it's got a variable life cycle that's different for each person, eventually you'll get bored and move on.
---
But there is fun to be had in this little sandbox they made.
---
No one has hit the Queen in a while. I only make them for the fight/nuke zones
---
I pondered this myself. 
---
I’m pretty sure one of the Whitesprings bunker vendors sells it all the time
---
Fallout and Diablo, two games which I'm struggling to keep enjoying. One is being destroyed and the other one is being forgotten blizzcon after blizzcon and is since long completely dead to me
---
New characters only, ranked servers since they're adding a leaderboard.
---
Thanks Valseek, I know it was a real knee-jerk reaction but damn, it felt like I got punched in the gut.  A lot of fair points on all sides, and I'm sure you all will do a great job, whatever is decided.  Can't wait for the beta?  
---
Got an unyielding leg with weapon weight and rad resist. Rad resist is broken. What I'm curious about is if when they fix the bug if it'll be retroactive and work on already owned gear. 
---
It appears they may still be trying to find someone who knows how to work a debugger.
---
Seriously - please restrict it to new characters only.
---
The reason why PvP is mostly dead currently is because everyone and their grandmother has a two shot explosive combat shotgun that they duped.
---
Why isn’t survival mode perma-death and new characters only?  Free PvP mode and no other changes is lame.  Get some real survival going on if it is a new optional game mode.  Open PvP.  Perms-Death.  No character transfers.  Hunger and Thirst deplete 4x faster.  Diseases are more common.  Give us a challenge.
---
That would be waaaay too much work for the Bethesda folks, so I highly doubt they will do anything else than the strictly advertised.
---
Either that or the char would have to be mode exclusive.
---
Survival Mode:
---
Fresh newly created character only and character bond to this mode
---
No Legendaries or very limited, only weapons or armors that you can craft and Mod. (Minimize the gear overpower, emphasized on strategy and how you engage each other)
---
Caps are even harder to come by. Selling price dropped even more but buying price can stay the same. 
---
Green thumb and a card I forgot what’s the name gives you chances to search for meat and 75% to pick something from plant. Without them, animals don’t give meat automatically and plant will have 80% gives nothing when you pick them. Woodchuck to get wood. 
---
Need the perk card to search for medical, ammo bag, etc supply crates. Those things mostly are empty without the perk to search
---
Need excavator power armor to mine. 
---
Problems with the server setup that i think will kill it within months.
---
How do they balance solo and group play?. Will 4 man groups just wipe out solo players?.
---
Dropping more than just junk and doubling the caps wouldn't that scare off pvpers in 76 if they are not in teams?. Team mates could pick up your stuff for you again not sure thats gonna do well.
---
What about all the items and crap we could bring over, wouldn't it deter new players to the setup?. This i am not 100% on could be ok just needs alot balance between scaling of levels.
---
Then what about gear in general how will that even be balanced?. Its not balanced at the moment and that wrecks alot of the game already. Its also why 76 pvp is so shite at the moment. Its not a skill based setup. Throw on sents with player damage reduction and a nice AAE and TSE...
---
Pop goes your power core
---
I'm down to make friends with some low levels to survive. I'm level 126 n play on ps4. 
---
I see it as make some high level friends or be high level.
---
I hope it can make for more stable PVE servers, considering all they are doing is splitting the servers and no actually bringing any new content out. Even so i find my days doing the same rubbish events, getting the same rubbish rewards, rebuilding my camp. 
---
I would just like a little event/boss fight that asks people to join and creates a random group jump in a vault and go guns blazing against something that has potential for awesome loot. Everything is easy obtainable. 2000 caps and you have 3* wep that can one shot things. GameOver. 
---
I think its less about the characters are more about the legendaries.  I have no problem with using the Beta to find out how high level characters work in there a little ahead of time without having to spend weeks waiting for people to level up in order to find out.  HOWEVER:  Balance is completely broken by high level characters with godly weaponry and maxed out armor in there able to go ham on anyone with no real consequence.  
---
It wont be pretty.  At all.  
---
You want high level characters in the survival beta.  More power to you.  Take away ALL their gear, and their stash.  Replace it with a single pipe pistol or pool cue or whatever.  But dont let people with TSE Gatling Guns and Shotguns and Instigating Gauss Rifles go into a survival match with a level 5 pipe pistol toting nublet.
---
Division has the best PVP mode for a PvE game. Although the player combat isn't that great.
---
I’m lvl 50 and for shame my gear is nowhere near end game quality. The advantage the lvl 250 has is hours in game and the higher likelihood of end game weapons.
---
I was selling a cuckoo clock plan from the rare Charleston vendor,, its 194 with hard bargain 3 - i think 400 was a fair starting price to haggle,,, instead of haggleing me they just appeared self entitled doing Angry/no emotes.. Their loss.
---
I try trade with new players too but they don't know how  request/offers work either - i think a loading screen tip would be useful there too
---
Yeah if I have to make a entire new character just for pvp count me out... I have put in alot of hours into my character and I wont be interested in living on a pvp server on a separate character that will more then likely fall behind... No thanks... Yall cry over how greifers on a pvp server it will be the same with in a month on a fresh slate their is no difference... Although I do agree with tse weapons but keep in mind those tse are going to be nerfed by 80% putting them down to a more balanced lvl... With that being said any lvl after 50 is pretty much useless in a combat scene... You people are pretty much bitching just to bitch or if it bothers you so much don't pvp I know I probably wont be myself
---
It seems like Bethesda just does the wrong things for the wrong reasons. At this point I just hope some other company buys the Fallout IP...
---
I got one in the mire with a bt extractor but most of the time i spawn inside of rocks when i fast travel there, it gets annoying fast
---
Because they see what can be the next best cash cow. 
---
Don't look at it through the eyes of a Fallout fan that genuinely wants to see this game succeed. Look at it through the eyes of a money hungry company. 
---
I mean look at Fortnite. PvE first, it sucked ass. Battle Royale, billions. 
---
A semi-auto handmade rifle is usable for close-range emergency spamming as an alternative to shotguns, although kiting melee units is hard work without speed demon or marsupial.  Adding Tormentor may help, but I'm not sure how it works.
---
If you refuse to use stealth with a rifle build then some enemies can burn through your ammo, but it'll probably work out if you chuck plenty of grenades.
---
I don't really understand the concept of "viable for end game". You're lucky if the queen doesn't die in two minutes flat these days, and none of the solo content is particularly challenging even with a trash build and weak legendaries. There are OP builds but no requirement to use them yourself. The difficult part of the game is between levels 20 and 50, due to local level scaling.
---
They mentioned it will scale saying even new players can be a threat to higher level ones
---
The game is very different now (and will be even better by March) from all the tweaks and fixes they've made, especially around XP and duping. 
---
The perspective (which I share) for these posts is that 2 months in to a clean survival launch would like very different than 2 months in to the retail launch because of how much has been changed / fixed / balanced. 
---
The first 2 weeks alone of retail launch had tons of dupes and XP exploits which damaged the integrity of the current servers and character "world". Things would be very different if the game were "relaunched" fresh with survival mode. 
---
It is less about a new player experience, but rather a new experience for existing players with greater integrity. That is my 2 cents anyway!
---
Why? The other gamemode os literally made for being hostile.
---
What we really need and fast is private servers and letting the modders get into the game itself. Then we will see more content than we could handle.
---
As someone with 6 god tier weapons and lvl 250 character... I agree. You should start a fresh character for survival with no item transfer between adventure and survival modes.
---
I'm not opposed to the concept of a wipe, it's just in the current state of the game something that would harm as much as it 'helped' to delay an inevitable problem in the new mode anyway
---
They didn't mention any plans on changing the economy, so it's really not going to be much different in time.
---
Plus, by forcing players to create new characters on this opens a lot of griefing potential to new characters when we're X amount of time in and people have progressed endgame.
---
It's not that I'd like to have one specific 3*, but more that I feel we shouldn't incentive pointless time gating and keeping people from progressing to items they actually want. You can do this in meaningful ways, and they don't involve killing the same N enemies for hours hoping to get lucky. You can still have meaningful grinding AND progression - it's that you shouldn't be forced to roll the dice, because that's just a temporary band aid on the real balance issues.
---
Agree with you, 100%.  Survival should be treated the same way that "Hardcore" is treated...just without the permanent deaths (although wouldn't that be a real kick in the teeth....)  In any case, you either have a survival character....or you dont.
---
Or alternatively fix the shitty Radiation Resist soft cap being so damn low so that lead lining, rad resist legendary, and rad shield aren't worthless trash.
---
Re: plans. I mean mostly camp building plans and recipes. Maybe base gun plans. I just feel that it's a waste of time to learn barn walls and a basketball hoop and building beautiful camps will probably be a bad idea in a pvp mode since they will all be destroyed constantly. 
---
Things that aid in game play like work benches, beds, musical instruments, and weapon and armor mods should still be learn able. 
---
Why not both ?
---
Valid point and obviously true.  They have just been duped to the point that they can be obtained by anyone with a couple thousand caps. 
---
As have serums, flux, mats, chems, etc. 
---
I snagged the plan for crafting T51b jetpacks from the BoS vendor at Watoga, so you might be able to server hop for one there. Enclave vendor occasionally has the X01 jet pack mods for sale, too. No idea when/if I'll see a jetpack mod for the ultracite armor.
---
So you already have people complaining that they're risking dividing the player base between pve and pvp and you want to further divide people within the pvp servers based on rank?  
---
And how exactly would friend lists work?  You're not allowed to join a pvp server with a friend unless they're within your pvp range?  Because otherwise what's to stop someone from making a level 1 character and getting placed in a lowbie pvp server and the inviting in all of their decked out friends for a slaughterfest?
---
PvP is cool and all, I've always been mostly a pvp fan in any game but fallout just does not do pvp well at all, id much rather have them focus on pve. 
---
Raids and dungeons etc would be so much cooler than what they've announced, imo.
---
Everyone asks for pvp servers. They implement pvp servers and I see nothing but complaints. Seriously, WTF. Go play CoD
---
I can tell you one thing. I don't think I'll be playing the "Survival mode" with the way the game runs today.
---
I'd much rather see the energy going into improving game stability, developing and improving the building system (get rid of building restrictions, allow junk placement for decoration, power armor display and better power armor management), adding co-op content, bring back some of the settings from FO4 (custom pip boy &amp; inventory colors, custom equipment naming), [improving the workshop system](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3f1tm/i_think_im_done_with_workshops_until_they_get_a/), improving vendors, player trade vending machines/map markers, fixing issues with teaming...
---
There are so many things that could be improved upon for content and quality of life. I was surprised to see they were working on a PVP game mode rather than working on making the game more playable as it is today. They need to fix their under-developed game and I just can't say if survival mode is a step in the right direction, but it surely feels like they are jumping the gun.
---
I can agree with you to the extent most people are bad at people and I respect you for actually explaining your answers, so cheers to you for that 
---
This sub hates PvP and PvP is what will make this game money.  
---
You missed the point. The main issue is exploits. This includes duping, developer room gear, experience exploits, and more. Think unlimited Stims, Ammo, and Aids such as explosive Bobbleheads.
---
The level differences is not an issue. Beth addressed the level issues somewhat.
---
With the right duped gear and perks some players will be unkillable. They are not going to run out of chems or ammo. 
---
The way Beth designed survival it allows all of the exploits to bleed over into pvp.
---
By requiring level 1 alts in a survival mode it resets the dupes and resets the game. Now that the game has been updated some exploits cannot be done. With no pve-pvp crossover no items can crossover.
---
This allows a fairly even playing field. Granted as long as duping can occur the pvp servers will eventually go to shit. However, I would support a much more aggressive ban policy for pvp vs pve. Beth can even ban specific pvp alts vs banning accounts. 
---
PVP that has in the in game mechanjcs to allow for unkillable one shotting players would be frustrating. No one except other dupers would stand a chance. 
---
Ah… You're one of ***those*** ...
---
i've noticed no difference at all between my anti-armor laser pistol and my non-legendary laser pistol when killing stuff with it.
---
Guh.  Guess I need to get around to joining the Enclave.
---
At the same time there are players at lvl 200+ and nothing to show for it. Is it fair to make their damage scale down too?
---
X01 - Blackbird paint, Mods: (Head) Targetting Hud, Red Headlamp, (Body) Jetpack or Stealthboy (Each Leg) Calibrated Shocks
---
I wish they had a stabilizing mod to put on for each arm but it's all melee so I usually leave my arms unmodded or add optimized bracers for the 1% time I actually use power attack.
---
For real though DO NOT ALLOW STANDARD CHARACTERS INTO SURVIVAL PERIOD. 
---
My clan of nearly 30 havent been really playing the passed week because you either play with a TSE or you dont win pvp fights. Even after nerf. Please delete them all from game and remove the ability for the 2 legendaries to be dropped to gather
---
What if the PVP server is a set-up to instantly ban every one with a duped item upon logging in by flagging ID's for each item or something? Just like the old Halo beta from Crackdown 1 banning an insane amount of xbox consoles (I had two macjines banned myself), **THAT** would be fun
---
My method was to turn the turrets hostile and pick/hack my way through. Was the most fun. 
---
Now I literally blast through with a vampires explosive combat rifle. Hacking the turrets was sooooo much more fun. But hacking can be terrible. 
---
The part that slows me down the most is the random lag I get while removing and replacing mainframe cores. Sometimes it'll take a few minutes to take off all the broken cores. 
---
Can't join lower level friends only higher level. Also I don't know how long you've been playing the game, but after level 50 your level doesn't matter. In some cases even before that as long as you have good gear. Ranked would only let you join friends with higher ranks and whatever. 
---
You're not showing you're dedic
---
Lmfao! You sound like a VATS dependant Fallout player and your bashing console players for having differeant  muscle memory than a KB/M player? Rockstar games have auto aim, Fallout does not outside of vats.
---
 I was with you on your idea, other than you sounding kinda entitled, til the last comment. Bashing console players doesnt prove/improve your point and if you took the time to look around, its probably pretty even numbers of PC/XBOX/PS4 on this sub.
---
Big derp dude.
---
So Bethesda makes people only able to join the Survival servers with level 1 characters?  Good news for everyone that immediately jumps into the game mode and gets a head start on leveling up and gearing themselves?
---
But what about all of the late comers who stayed playing the base game or didn't even get the game until later?  They get dropped into Survival at level 1 surrounded by players who were there from the start with with decked out characters and it just sucks to be them?
---
I dont play solo. But if I did I'd load up on stealth boys n a fat man. Not even a crowd can survive a nuke. :) dont have to be high level for that either 
---
duped gear doesn't make it stronger, only bobblehead stacking does and that's fixable
---
I can be on soon, I have like 460 caps and 80 waste acid RN btw
---
Except they come out with different things they say they're "going" to do while we burn out waiting for our fave one to be implemented. People will eventually stop caring and leave the game. That's not a good practice for them business-wise and people getting tired of waiting can't be blamed.
---
Tons of MMOs, especially older ones really. Even MapleStory 2, from last year, has PVP and PVE zones. The only complaint I have about when games do this is when you have to do PVE quests in those zones.
---
No it is not, it is absolutely not how this is commonly done. Most forums are a cesspool. 
---
How is Fallout 76 a survival game? It isn’t hardcore survival. The food and water and ammo weight are minor inconveniences. Nothing weighs what it should. If this is a survival game it should commit to being one. 
---
I have played survival games and I wouldn’t classify this as one of those. 
---
How is watching each other play fallout 4 the same as playing fallout together? The two aren’t even close to the same and your “solution” is laughable at best. 
---
This is not a survival game it may have some very light survival elements but as it stands it’s fallout 4 with multiplayer on survival mode (which in itself isn’t a survival game). 
---
You would fit in well with me and the folks I play with. We get what we call the mothball going which is a stack of all of the plans that we've all found but don't eat for the night. By the time it hits 18 to 20 lb of plans that none of us need I go track somebody lower-level down and get them on the mic and have them run through it. I tell them to pick them all up use all the ones they can and then drop those along with the ones they're already holding. We do this over and over until everything's gone except for a few ultrasite explosive Vents and chemistry workbenches.
---
We also see if they need anything, like some armor or ammo or stimpacks. 
---
I've run into people leaving stuff in containers but I've also seen higher level people going in and grabbing that stuff to just sell it. I just like to ensure that somebody's getting  the stuff. 
---
Also on Xbox.
---
Nah it would be a waste of time, money and resources.  I like your spirit though!
---
Not only this, there is some serious rebalancing that needs to be done with regards to gear. All assassins gear + sentinel basically means you are invulnerable to other players while standing still. There is no counter to this kind of gear setup.
---
As I'm sure most people are aware, certain weapons are naturally more powerful than others -- TSE will be the most common ones people point to, but don't forget the power of an instigating weapon. You would easily be able to one-shot people. Or stack a few bobbleheads and everything dies instantly.
---
More than enough, gt m3ment0, join me when you log in
---
The enclave has intact nukes.. I've yet to see an intact vertibird
---
If I wanted to PvP is pick any of a hundred other games that do it better.
---
I mean they can literally leave in the 'No PvP until level 5' thing in. Which they should.
---
Nah. They front like they are all clean, fancy and nice but really they’ve got roaches like everyone else.
---
It’s 2019 don’t you know the PVP game mode IS their great big new content? Ain’t that what games do nowadays right?
---
Sure I’m fine with them removing achievements. Not that I see the survival elements in fallout 76 making those achievements harder to complete. 
---
Never any near where I am. 
---
You also missed the point. Duped gear with certain legendary stats can be combined with perks to make ultra pvp characters. Legendary stats that would be very rare if farmed and not duped....
---
I think this move buys the developers time to get after the DLC. I think a lot of people have reached end game much faster than Bethesda anticipated, and they need to keep these players invested somehow. If high levels get bored and sign off, the game suffers for reduced player base. If they get bored and start antagonizing low levels, the game suffers because it will drive low levels to quit. So these players need a new challenge, but the DLC isn’t ready, so what do the developers do? Build a Thunderdome and invite gladiators.
---
Yeah, paint for one model of PA and combat armor is a bit eh
---
However, raider gets even less than that, do they not?
---
I can imagine it now, you're faced with a griefer. You yell into your mic "hey, go play on the new server mode!". He laughs and says he's a raider, kills you and destroys your camp.
---
You come back to Reddit and make a thread, confused as to why a griefer isn't just running around killing other griefers on the new mode. It baffles you immensely. Why isn't this new mode working?
---
Maybe you can summon a vertibot and turn of the autopilot
---
They just need to make a new under armor lining that is radiation resist only. Problem solved.
---
PVP that has in game mechanics to allow for unkillable-one-shotting players would be frustrating. No one except other dupers would stand a chance. 
---
Really??
---
They escort the cargo bots around all the time
---
BGS is the most incompetent game studio I have ever seen
---
Those are vertiBOTS
---
Make it seasonal, like Diablo 3, have a ranked leaderboard, have it reset after 8 or 10 weeks, with a 4-6 week break for tweaking, adding in it new content, making new themes (like robot armor only, or no power armor helmets), making new 'win' conditions (for example, most kills of players over level 100, killing players under level 100 doesn't add to kill score, you have to be level 100 to access the unlocked vault 63 with new content, etc.)
---
Yeah outside events it's not very frequent, agreed.
---
You guys are the absolute most incompetent game studio I have ever seen
---
Technically level 50.
---
The worst bugs are the frequent crashes and server disconnects. Those are pretty much a daily occurrence for me. There are a few interesting and unique quests but most are pretty boring walk-and-collect/kill tasks. 
---
I think I can boil the experience down well enough for you to make a decision. If you liked the Fallout 4 settlement building you will enjoy this gameplay for many hours. If you can enjoy repetitive enemy spawn grinds for high-end legendary drops then you can have fun for many hours in this game. The latter of those two will require a decent friends list to play with but that is easy enough to acquire. 
---
The above scenarios are by far where the most end-game time is spent currently. Either way the game requires a lot of grinding but that equals time spent enjoying, sometimes being frustrated, with the game. I personally enjoy grinding workshops for resources and plans to build my camp but it does get old at times and I’m ready for new content. I’m only level 58 after about 120 hours and I have done all the major quests and killed the hardest of the enemies(SBQ). 
---
I cannot recommend buying anything besides the base game and I wouldn’t recommend paying more than $30. The game can be fun at times but it will be frustrating as often as not. 
---
but they can still be dropped or bought from other players and you have no way to tell.
---
yes, duping sped up the destruction of the economy but with caps having constant infinite inflation it would have happened anyway, just a bit later. but they did not make the guns any stronger than a legit drop.
---
They could just put you on a server with people within a range of your level, say +\- 5.. problem solved.. and then a 50+ server for those who have maxed their special and have a decent collection of gear. Or maybe a 50-100 server, 100-150 etc. 
---
I’d rather that than some weird level scaling. Or get smoked by a level 100 when i’m level 10.
---
I don't want to start over in survival, please don't make us make new characters.    
---
Does anyone know if the Monorail Elevator is completely bugged out, or is that just my game?  
---
Whenever I get into the elevator, floor 2 spits me out on the ground floor inside the elevator, and floor 3 spits me out outside the elevator, on the ground still, next to it.  The OTHER elevator (only 2 floors), the second floor spits me out on the ground outside the elevator.
---
Griefers aren't going to end up in Survival Mode. The whole point of a griefer is to cause grief, and that means killing, destroying bases, and general harassment of players that do not desire it. The only game mode where griefing is even possible will be Adventure mode. By definition, those that play survival will want (or at least expect) those things to happen to them.
---
Having to start over is what makes it fun.  Death should be permanent. There is nothing “survival” about the mode as they describe it.
---
I am excited to try survival mode. Fo76 has been so easy, I never feel uneasy. People are so devious and evil its going to be a standoff everytime you a human player. Amd when you do team up it will be even more epic. I hope they make stealing from camps a thing so you have to either make secluded camps or focus on security. And when i just want to chill load up my og character in classic mode. Plus lets face it, what has been missing since Fo4? Being evil. Now we will be able to complete assholes or fucking saviour of the wastes. I can already imagine lvl 200 waiting at quest locations to crush people just trying to get their excavator PA or find the brotherhood. And then out of nowhere a team of mistress' of mystery arrive, kill the trolls and give the defenceless chems and ammo.
---
Dot think people care about other peoples levels, its the duped items and gear that's the problem.
---
People joining a week after launch wont care what level you are o the server as they'd be running there own race not a race against current players.
---
It doesn't matter what level other people are, that's always going to happen. You can not allow people to benefit from exploited items on the new server though.
---
I guess Bethesda are ok with the dupers selling stuff on ebay though so nothing surprises me any more :(
---
&gt;Also for someone who doesn't like PVP like myself  
---
The plus side of this for people who don't want to PvP is that 95% of the PvPers will move to the survival servers.  
---
And in fairness to bethesda here, separate server modes was asked for very quickly (even before release)
---
Yes I have a TSE 10MM pistol. Although I don't see the point, pistol dps is trash due to a variety of reasons.
---
I liked Hancock tho!
---
Everything is extremely incomplete (or links to Fallout4 instead -_-)
---
If you find a good resource, link me in please, lol
---
That could be doable.. but there's an issue of; if they designed it to be able to work with no humans inside, why would they design a human based cockpit, rather than fill it with everything for the bot system or more cargo space?
---
I do wish we could make profiles for our character for others to see with little back stories . 
---
I may sound like an idiot saying Regis but would you like a sneak heavy gunner? How does that work you may ask? Well I did manage to procure a Stalkers Fat Man with 100% Vats chance outside combat. So if you ever wanted to watch that single ghoul go up in smoke I can make that happen for you. Outside of that I run melee. Sorry I don’t have a photo to share. Still trying to figure that out on my pc
---
My money, lore-progression wise, is on the machines not functioning past a certain age? Like after 200 yrs in the wasteland whatever powers them gave out.
---
Books too, could use the same setup as crops. They'd just need to define "dirt" as "shelf" and put the place on the shelf with that definition. This very short conversation leaves me wondering why it wasn't already considered and added in. My experience in programming is admittedly limited, but I'm confident even I could pull that off without fucking it up.
---
Honestly though, what I'd like to see more than all this is a way to setup a storefront with shelves. Put up "store shelves" and have the ability to put items on those shelves with individual prices that you set and people can interact with to buy. Or, the ability to craft your own vendor bot that people can buy things from. Except instead of the caps going to the bot like with normal vendors, they go to your stash as an item like "Store Caps Stash" to be collected later.
---
I think the biggest thing here it that both pve and pvp will suffer with this split. I mean think about how fast they are rolling out content now. It's all about game fixes as it should be. But now they're going to double that. Ugh!
---
Problem is the core of the Fallout fans don't like PvP. Also BFS doesn't realize the shooting mechanics suck. Its very clunky. 
---
#Ooooh
---
Thanks for clarifying, my bad
---
one of what?
---
You don't speak for everyone. Not all of us want to start over dude.  
---
They could have been used as troop transport pre war
---
There's no way they'd be stupid enough to put player locations on the map for a PvP free-for-all mode...no, wait, they probably will.
---
The unique and non-released items. Specialized legendaries did not. Lets say you wanted a very specific armor setup with very specific legendary stats. A combination of stats. Stats that would take forever to farm. In the developer room they walked out with armor like that and duped it. It is in game armor it just would be very difficult yo farm that specific suit. It could take months of farming. However, it is out there and available.
---
That might be a good thing, for people who have mentioned they don't like having their weapon sights go chameleon. Probably a bug but one that is useful for those people at least. And maybe other people can't see it but who knows? Somebody will need to test to find out I guess.
---
Thank you for your comment /u/Valseek :) Is there any way you can give us a very general idea of when we can expect the beta to begin? Do you know if this will be a closed beta or open to all players who own the game?
---
Also, lore wise, the Nevada already exists! So the tech was definitely there.
---
Lmao this game is garbage from every perceivable angle. Why do ya'll still log on. There's no saving this dumpster fire.
---
Don't have us start over, he doesn't speak for everyone.  
---
I just got the excavator armor, and I'm running low on batteries so I'm thinking "no problem I'll restart a power plant when starting and all will be good"
---
1. I capture the workshop, the server crash on me and kick me out. Workshop lost.
---
2. I capture the workshop, get out of my armor, I'm stuck in the middle of the animation. Alt-F4 is required to unstuck myself. Obviously the workshop is lost
---
3. I capture the workshop, I can't build any defenses on it. The "defend the workshop" is bugged and the enemies never comes. I start fixing the power plant, my game crash...
---
I quit after that and I'm not sure I ever want to try again to do anything in this game.
---
It's definitely worst than before. I'll simply uninstall it and maybe come back next year when ~~it's finally fixed enough~~ nobody plays it anymore so the servers are stable enough to be playable
---
every community except for reddit that i go to, likes pvp and talks about it. however if you say anything remotely positive about pvp on here, you get downvoted until hidden, so it is an echo chamber  
---
I once made a post about reasons not to pvp and it got over 1k upvotes  
---
but every post i make defending pvp goes negative within minutes  
---
I could write an essay on why it is good to let people transfer characters but it would be downvoted to a bolivian before anyone reads it, so i dont bother
---
Very very likely Mohammed because adventure mode won't be pve ish it is still the same as current. So its very possible those that grief or roleplay raiders will remain this side.
---
Dupers are already getting banned, their duped TSE weapons are already getting nerfed to shit, developer room gear were cosmetics, experience exploits never meant shit because you're as strong as you'll ever get once you've hit level 50.
---
Do you lose your stuff when you die I haven’t had a chance to play it yet.  
---
- thanks in advance 
---
Take a penny, leave a penny. Or Tenpenny.
---
Came here looking for this. It would be awesome if people would type the full thing out at least once.
---
git gud
---
    git: 'gud' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
---
After level 100 you don't need to accept PvP it's just auto enabled. 
---
I'd play the shit out of that 
---
But, it's TRUE though
---
They werent "anti pvp". They were the majority of people sharing experiences in which they underlined the overall friendliness of the players in fallout76. People experienced it and were pleasantly surprised that a initialy pvp based game, suddenly turned into an exploration game with tons of friendly and cooperative players. Maybe this even caught bethesda by surprise. After so many competitive pvp games, people were experiencing a different type of game and enjoying it. At least the ones who got this far.
---
What seems to me now is that Bethesda is more or less forcing people to focus on pvp instead of missions, story and lore.
---
As much as they try, fallout will never be a pvp/ battle royal/ survivalist game. And the overall reception and feedback indicates just that. People prefer roleplaying as vendores of vigilantes, than shooting one another.
---
And I think this I outstanding!
---
I’ve seen level 15 do more damage than a lvl 45, so upping the level is only going to fix part of the issue
---
I want to be able to throw a hand full of pebbles up into the air to fool the scorchbeasts into flying after them like you can do with bats in real life. Then heckle them for being so foolish. So a heckle button too.
---
Because low level damage is totally not normalized for PvP purposes...oh, wait.
---
Oh you can bet they know about new bugs before each update but it is no secret that they are willing to release known bugs. They know a profitable amount of players will just keep slogging through the mess regardless. 
---
BRRRRRRRAAAAAP!
---
Please please PLEASE.
---
At *least* for the first month, only allow fresh characters. Let people who didn't play from launch experience a fresh server that isn't overloaded with explosive one-shot weapons. It's an entirely different game/experience.
---
Set up C.A.M.P. here this very evening. Not as well put together as yours, but mostly functional! Went for a stroll into Harper's Ferry and cane back to two lvl 35 Cave Crickets in my bedroom... Times like these I wish I actually _had_ power armour ;D
---
If pvp servers are separate then that is not an issue. If everyone starts at level one with no crossover to  pve then there is less of an issue
---
This happened to me when crafting my latest PA 
---
Super frustrating
---
Hey u/Valseek not all of us want to start over in survival.  Please don't make us!
---
Yeah lol I know that....I would offer but personally require my team to be mic'ed up...makes coordination sooo much easier.
---
Ive had fun in this game, but this is one of the reasons why I quit, I cant trust the game to do anything that requires dedicated time on the same server.
---
Exactly. Already had to do this twice due to a camp on my first character breaking. Not interested in buying all those plans for crafting and base building given I’ve had to do it twice now due to game breaking bugs and character lockout.
---
Right now, we're looking to start beta in March, but that could still shift based on feature work and testing needs. We'll keep you posted on the date as we get closer, and beta should be open to everyone who owns the game. 
---
Yep! I have a Furious 10mm, and have sold an Assassin’s 10mm in the past. So they do exist!
---
6 previous Fallout titles don't recall people saying this would be fun to pvp with. Seen hundreds of people speaking about a fallout mmo over the years though but never did the conversation get round to pvp.
---
Bethesda made many PVP games over the years?
---
They've done 6 fallout's single player and 1 multiplayer now and are straight on the PVP train even though the games engine doesn't really lend itself all that well to PVP :(
---
People who PvP as a way to grief/troll probably won't spend much time on servers they can't troll PvE players and can always be attacked by people with more skill than shooting a TSE at point blank while standing in Sentinel. When most of the player base will be geared towards PvP the current trolls who pretend they're good because they can take out PvE geared players will get their asses handed to them pretty quickly when they meet teams of people with actual skill and cowards don't like fair fights. I don't think the new format will help reduce complaints about kills on the normal servers nor do I think you're going to see a massive amount of the people causing the complaints about on the new servers. 
---
Besides that, what you are saying now will still apply in a month or two. So even if you had to make new characters, in a month or two you'd be back in the same situation you're currently complaining about. If you make a new character day 1, how do new players that come in next month compete against you me? You'll be a gold medalist while they're still a newborn. Starting on equal footing means every month you'd need to player wipe the whole thing, if not, it's just equal footing for the day 1 people who can play everyday.
---
wish we had Holovids. make the TVs a container and place Vids in them like the ones you mentioned even adds the little shorts from other Fallout games and the occasion new one. nothing too fancy but collecting Holovids and having a library would be cool. Imagine going back to you CAMP and finding a few people just watching TV and hanging out.
---
You really should! I met Scott, he’s wonderful! 
---
This would be bullshit, you'll lose a lot of players if you have to have 2 separate characters to grind. Not everyone has time for that shit 
---
76 is a fucking joke...I’m honestly terrified of what their next games will be like...no way I’m preordering now.
---
You could loot any item out of the dev room. You could loot a TSE or Armor with legendary stats of your choice. All would look like normal gear. It is easy for beth delete “Marine Helmet” not so easy for Beth to delete “TSE Combat Shotgun”.
---
One of the community messengars posted this in a different thread:Hi everyone,
---
Thank you for all of the feedback so far on the details we posted about Survival mode earlier today! We'll make sure your thoughts about the mode here and in the future are shared with the dev team. The article mentions this already, but I wanted to restate that we're still iterating and actively working on Survival mode, so things aren't necessarily set in stone, and your continued feedback will be very important to us as we move toward beta, and eventually release.
---
This is also just the beginning of the conversation. We'll be looking to share more about the new mode with you in Inside the Vault, streams, and other means, and also talk more with you about what you'd like to see in Survival mode as we move forward.
---
**EDIT:** We’re also seeing the thoughts being shared by those of you who’d like to see more PVE content, and while I can’t spoil any details just yet, I will say that Survival mode won't be the only new content coming to Fallout 76, so stay tuned!
---
I crashed 15 times yesterday. Once the day before. After updating some mods I'm yet to crash today. Fingers crossed. It's really inconsistent. 
---
Oh yeah and people who are on the “defend everything Bethesda does” bandwagon are saying that we should just “wait to play pvp till we’re ready”. How are we supposed to prepare for a war against thousands of people with stacks upon stacks of duped items?
---
But like, it more than likely runs of the same auto system as a cargo bot. If they used it for troop transport, wouldnt they just take out the walls and chairs for the cockpit to make more room? And based off how they target things on the ground, they seem designed to be controlled from the ground, so that they can be sent to a fight without risking lives. Which just brought me back to there would be seats in it lol
---
Been that way since paid early access. 
---
So instead of focusing on content, you're focusing on pvp. This is sad. 
---
There's only so many times we can respond before we're just rude. So I'll lay out here what I think and leave it there. I understand your viewpoint but I demonstrably disagree too.
---
Having spent thousands of atoms and still having thousands left; I fundamentally disagree with anybody claiming we're made to buy atom points or that it's remotely necessary (caveat 1 at the end). I've got somewhere under 400 hours on 76 but earlier today I levelled up and got awarded atom points for 3 (I think) different challenges at the same time. They are not hard to come by. They slow down but that's the point. Has nobody played an online multiplayer game before? It takes months to level up through all the level resets on Payday 2 and reach the higher infamous levels (or whatever it's called - it's been a while). That's fine. You just play the game lots. GTAO takes weeks at best to get your apartment, complete the heists and fill a garage with the cars you want. Never mind the yachts, bunkers, bikers businesses or various crazy real estate and vehicle options. You grind like a mofo on GTA. A lot of these things above perpetuate the grind by giving you new expensive ways to grind. On Pokemon Ultra Sun I've had to wait ages to get a Tyranitar. Took days of fighting random rubbish wild Pokemon to level up my Larvitar enough. That's 1 Pokemon of my potential best 6 team. The Pokemon box fits hundreds of Pokemon in it.
---
But 76 is unfair because we can't have the 700 atom four poster bed **right now**. I want it **now**. Right now. How dare they make me play the game and get the bed later when I've randomly been given the points absolutely free. I want that very unimportant content right now and the only way I can have it is to either do all the remaining challenges available (probably taking hours) or spend real money.
---
I don't look at that and decide the bed is worth real money but maybe that's me. I'll buy it early next week when I'm around 3700 atoms (I keep a buffer of 3k atoms in case there is a genuine must-have on offer and I'm around 3400 now - caveat 2 below). Btw the cloche hat on offer right now is crap. Despite people saying how awful it is: I don't care. In 1 hour it's gone. I can manage 1 day without spending atoms. I don't expect something as damn cool as the blackbird paint every day. I'll see what there is tomorrow and if it's worth using up what I've accumulated. It doesn't matter what they put out. Somebody will be unhappy. We're all individuals.
---
Caveat 1: casuals with extremely limited time might decide it's worth their time to just buy the stuff and save themselves hassle and time. That's up to them. But they've not been forced to do it. They can just not get the four poster bed.
---
Caveat 2: I've got a few things already like the hot rodder paint you mentioned. Got that for PA and frame thing. Also camo sniper. Oh yeah the flashing lights too. Probably more, I can't remember right now.
---
Btw $450 on R6? Shit you crazy dude. I hope none of the guns of outfits were present in the previous games (  :p  ). Also, does R6 allow you to accumulate currency randomly for free?
---
PvP is a joke in a builds based system and dependent on RNG based legendary loot.  There’s a lot of games for PvP - but Fallout is not a good candidate.
---
Proper PvP requires a much more even playing field and skills should matter - not what you bought, duped or traded for to make an OP character.
---
One of the community messengars posted this in a different thread:
---
Hi everyone,
---
Let your conscience be your guide. FOMO is the enemy of fun.
---
I believe that’s how the Assaultron head works. 
---
&gt; Goddamn, Bethesda, what other items? Other items besides junk and aid are: weapon, armor, misc, holo, ammo and mods (did I miss something?). Am I gonna drop a jetpack or my main weapon or a random holotape?
---
*Who knows?!? Not even us, because when have we ever really had any idea how our own spaghetti code functions!*
---
There is a way to dupe via enclave vendors that was in beta that is still active.  Also just dropping an item (having a second character pick it up) and dashboarding the first character works sometimes as well.  The 3\* unyielding/sentinal armor sets and the \*3 Hunting rifles you see on the trader sections were duped after the last patch.  The PvP servers should have legendary effects disabled, and no bobbleheads, or it will just dominated by dupers.
---
Okay, at release.
---
What if I bought F76, and decided I wanted to play Survival later into the existence of survival?
---
You still have problems.
---
Yup, I haven’t had it happen to me yet, as I haven’t found one, but it is a reported bug that I’m pretty sure Bethesda is aware of. 
---
We may not have the same opinion, but I like how it will be implemented. By all means im not a duper at all (Too much trouble and unnecessary) nor have a tse. But we'll have to see how they'll implement it from the feedback.
---
Integrity is the most important thing in any multiplayer or online game. 
---
If you can't trust that all players are on an equal playing field, everything else is pointless.
---
I agree with you completely. Dupes, exploits, and exploitable bugs destroy the integrity of the game. They've already made good progress in fixing these, but they can't fix the integrity without starting fresh with survival. It is an absolute must that they fix these and then launch survival separated completely from adventure mode characters. 
---
I would add in a real strong effort to balance the game as well. Could you imagine many viable builds, no dupes or exploits, starting fresh, and a solid effort at balancing everything else out with this mode? It would be amazing! Truly a v2.0 type experience. 
---
I than I guess we can just fix a broken one
---
Bless you.
---
Private servers please.  I'm happy with no server transfers there (... in fact I'd prefer that).  But, for the love of God, give is the private servers you said you would!
---
I might come back and play if this is implemented correctly.
---
I won't if it isn't. I'm sure lots of people like me are watching, waiting to see which direction the game heads.
---
Restricting it to new characters is literally a no brainer and I CANNOT BELIEVE it even made it this far with it going in this direction. Does Bethesda even play their game? Do they even play ANY game?!?!
---
I fear that even with the negative feedback this has immediately drummed up, if it goes into a "beta" how the standard mode went into a "beta" it will already be a bygone conclusion. If this mode launches with adventure mode characters, it is dead on arrival. Period. 
---
Youve already removed ANY reason to reroll a new character by A. offering character creation at any time and B. offering the changing of specials and swapping of perk cards. Why are you so determined that everyone only make one character ever?
---
I truly feel like the devs couldnt be any more misguided, almost every decision seems completely backwards. 
---
Because they under the mistaken belief that PvP will expand the player base increasing profits. Hardcore PvP guys won't play game for long because the shooting mechanics suck. Its like taking a 1966 Bel-Aire Station wagon and adding a turbo charger on it and expecting Dodge Viper performance out of it
---
Well to be fair it took time to build the scoreboards and such.
---
There’s a response here for more developed events (conclave bunker event board has space..) to gain gear without “grinding” white-springs. And I have a character I can play the end game meaningfully that’s never traded on the market place, so your point about progression is limited in regards to a new server where it takes more time to progress, but that is spread out among a larger variety of possibilities than camping whitesprings 
---
I'm quite sure that nobody is playing fallout at Bethesda HQ because everything sound so fucking ridiculous 
---
I just read the inside the vault. Buying gear is pretty much mandatory now.
---
People are very vocal on this subreddit towards anti PvP.  They have every right to prefer a style of play.  Outside of reddit and most people I play with, we love PvP.  Please consider those who like it also.  
---
I'm not sure why everyone is so upset when they can literally stick to adventure mode.  PvP is getting it's own mode and should have punishing elements seen in other games.  In worried this sub will push to water it down.  Those against PvP shouldn't have a huge say in what goes into it as they won't be  playing it.   This mode is catering to those who love PvP and those wanting new characters are people who don't engage in fights.  
---
Thanks for considering new modes in general.  Not being afraid to make huge changes is refreshing to say the least.  
---
you only have to opt in because people moaned though and it was added at the last minute which is why id doesn't work well.
---
This sub *prefers* PvE, as this game was probably initially designed to be. 
---
"Rebuild America, start anew." Ron Perlman told us all the purpose of this adventure at the start!
---
But it's slowly changing to CoD with a bit of Sims3,  and that's what *this sub hates*!
---
I personally want to play for the interaction: someone using my CAMP to fix his stuff, and leave me a baggie of spare junk and drugs as payment.
---
Then I can do the same when I get a helping hand from someone 40 lvl's above me, who saves me from the bastard flying spambeasts' sonic boom wave!
---
Then we all meet again in the nuke zone to practice our baseball skills on a few glowing bastards! 
---
Because their planned implementation is easy. It's literally just changing a few settings.
---
Please please don't make us start over.  Not everyone has time to level brand new characters.  
---
Why is this called survival mode and not pvp mode? I was actually excited for some surviving :/
---
Nukacrypt is good for Silo codes
---
There are numerous SPECIAL/perk planners that are useful (nice to have a road map while developing characters)
---
This Reddit and FO76FilthyCasuals have some pretty good resources but ya just have to dig a bit.
---
We've spoken before, I not sure that you truly understand that I dont care about your opinion.
---
Very
---
Exactly. The issue is that these items were grabbed from the dev room and duped. Items that would have taken weeks to farm. Suits and builds that may have taken months to farm. They are now easily available.
---
Some of these legendary stats when stacked with perks make players unkillable.
---
Lasers are red
---
Ultricite is blue
---
200 lvls later
---
They still hit like poo
---
Or....
---
They could add a way to call and control one remotely. Possibly use it as a transport similar to riding on the side like in fo4
---
I’ve had the same happen to me. 
---
Well thank god the French-speaking players are finally OK. /s
---
Will you finally hear us and give us offline mode? I'm tired of loosing workshops because your servers are not stable enough. 
---
Yesterday I captured the extractor and started it, let it run for 25 minutes, defended it against the way too frequents attacks, all for nothing because the server crashed on me before I could retrieve anything, leaving me with almost no ammos to retry.
---
Think of it like this: If you are going to play this for hundreds of hours, you already got your money's worth, and if spending another 20-40usd will make the experience more enjoyable go for it. 
---
We have guys that spent +$200?  played for half an hour ragequit, and cried about on reddit/blogs. Atom challenges will get you everything eventually, just gotta horde them for when something nice rotates in.
---
Stolen. C'mon, downvote me now.
---
*CoD is that way, tho* 》》

March? Beta was released in November.
---
Same here.
---
It drops the a fatman that only fires teddy bears and does negative 999 damage to enemies 
---
Same deal on consoles. If you don't have any favorite wheel slots open, you can't favorite any more items. Also 12 spaces.
---
Yes. I have a lvl 45 Quad 10mm pistol, great sidearm for The Forrest or to tag enemies when others are around. I got a Two Shot 10mm lvl 35 yesterday but it had terrible accuracy and I sold it to a vendor bot.
---
Exactly!!! It is the only chance at a clean slate we will likely ever get, and they are just pissing it away. 
---
if you kneel down right in front of it, turn the screen off and put your pipboy light there is an odd pastural image always on screen. 
---
I like your idea except for when you say all plans and everything already accessible... idk if your main right now is 50+ or not but after all that stuff is just given to you, then whats the point of doing anything? Its like half the fun of the game to collect and find new things. Keep everything the same just make people start new characters imo...
---
This is my game life too pal, only I clear a different zone every login, for some.... fun? /s
---
Total letdown from last inside the vault :/
---
I wouldn't doubt that, I have tried that one but I like the paper version for some reason
---
TSE weapons... the ones getting nerfed down to at best 25% of their current strength with the next patch.  
---
And exactly how much of the player population do you think actually had access tot he dev room that this would be a widespread problem?  The dupers who got inside were already dealing in god tier gear, access to the dev room didn't open up anything new for them other than the otherwise unobtainable cosmetics.
---
See, you use personal anecdotals as to why the RNG system is fine, but I point towards the vast amount of people not as lucky or use my own and am quick to be shut down
---
I think this whole issue could have been avoided since launch day by providing dedicated PVP and PVE servers, like most MMOs do.
---
I would like to take this opportunity to insist that if they are adding a full on pvp mode, than adventure mode should become a full on pve experience... All they have to do is make pacifist mode completely disable slap damage and base damage from other players, and there's no excuse for them to ignore this option if we're getting a full pvp mode... Nobody likes wasting one of every stable flux to repair a decontamination arch only to have it immediately redestroyed by base griefers in what's apparently supposed to be the pve friendly mode moving forward... That needs fixing alongside the launch of this new mode, no excuses!!  
---
...he said "fair points on all sides" and "right decision, whatever you decide" in the post you're replying to.
---
I"m not really sure why you feel he is trying to speak for you, or thinks you're wrong...
---
Thank you so much for the info! Excited to try it out.
---
Show a picture of him doing it or just more rumors
---
That’s actually a damn good idea, any weapons or armor you transfer to the survival servers are wiped of their legendary effects, that would piss off all the dupers lugging around hundreds of TSE hardened pumps
---
He’s so nervous he’s blushing green.
---
Ha! Are you serious? Cause that's fabulous! What time zone? I'm EST
---
I'm attacking your character because you're giving me nothing else to work with.
---
Me calling you a moron is less of an attack and more of an observation. Its a discussion, its just you're covering your ears and pretending you don't hear anything.

Get in there, if the SBQ comes close to you, do your best and keep an eye on your health. If she hammers you, then retreat and deal to the adds. Just be aware of where the heavy hitters are, although they won't be aiming at you, you might get in the way of a missile or .50 cal explosive round. But dive on in, enjoy yourself in the maelstrom and madness.
---
Hit me up: ign philipoos, discord Pochi#6483
---
VATS, legendary items and unlimited healing all in one game? And it is PvP? It is a recipe for disaster.
---
The only weapon mod i have seen in 100+ lvls that adds a star is the scorched receiver
---
Exactly.  Next people here will be pushing for no rng drops and everyone gets the same stuff.
---
i like it. i use a glow sighted hunting rifle and its nice to see your irons for shooting. 
---
Im confused... didnt they tell us the DLC coming out would be out very quickly after they announce it? 2 months isnt exactly "right after announcment"... i kind of assumed we would see some type of pve dlc at the beginning of feb.
---
I guess ill just let the game sit for a couple months and come back when something new gets released. Not much to do in game when you are already high level and have done most of the quests...
---
I equip my Unyielding set and then fill up my health bar as far as I can with rads and bottom out my health as far as I can to boost my INT and LCK while crafting or scrapping.  I find ( INT for crafting and LCK when scrapping ) allows me to try and maximize my durability bar upon crafting or chance at learning new mods when scrapping. I also believe it helps raise chances of unlocking more mods when scrapping depending on how many mods are currently on the items ready for scrap. 
---
Hope this helped and wasn’t completely repetitive. GL!
---
Try storing all the mats required in your stash. Once they're all stacked it should work again. Had that happen to me as well, stupid glitch. 
---
I tried it, but didn't much care about how much ammo it was wasting, compared to harder-hitting weapons. With 10mm you're spending 3/5/15 per 24. Wotj 5.56mm you're spending 4/6/12 for 20, but doing considerably more damage each shot. Plus, with the way DR works, big infrequent hits don't get penalized nearly as much as small, frequent hits. I felt like I was burning ammo, and getting less of a benefit. 
---
Yeah I'm testing out different combinations now. Dense fireproof and dodgy seem like enough perks. Once they need explosive I might use shotgun damage perks. 
---
Each level after 50 you can choose to switch 1 perk point or choose any card. You also get a perk pack every 5 levels
---
Exactly. This isn't content. This is them saying: go kill yourselves. Make your own fun! I don't get this direction. :(
---
The magic school bus indeed. 
---
This one comment made me check out the video. 
---
I am so tired of the infomercial type of guy yelling at me for 5 min before what I want to see starts and then it’s all bull shit. 
---
THIS HOWEVER is awesome
---
You da real MVP
---
Which is fine, I want them to move there, I know people wanted it. It just shows even more that this game wasn't ready for release yet between the bugs and features like this that should have been there day one. What doesn't sit well with me is Bethesda trying to claim it as new content, hyping it as some new game mode in vault articles the last few weeks when it's just separate PVP servers that should've been there from the start.
---
In a general sense, I think this is the biggest mistake so far from Bethesda. And that's saying something, cause holy shit this game, so far, has been one mistake after another. And that's coming from someone who plays a ton and really likes the game.
---
But, thankfully, outside of lost development time/resources, this can only benefit me, regardless of how it's implemented. I hate PvP. And if this takes even just a few assholes elsewhere, I can't wait.
---
Yeah the new mode is a great idea and would be made better with a fresh start. No ruined economy or OP builds running around instantly. No duping methods to exploit and ruin the games core mechanics 
---
Blind maps, no legendary stat items, no cross server trading. Survival is survival and adventure is adventure. They should have no interaction.
---
A good middle ground would be to separate newly made characters and imported ones. As in, people transferring old chars over can only meet other transferred characters on the same server, and fresh ones meet on different servers.
---
U will recieve as much as u want. Just change filter, see below when chose a perk
---
No u
---
That community manager did their job. Went straight to the devs and told them exactly what we all wanted, no DEMANDED, a new PvP mode.
---
Show some respect.
---
Exactly - a wipe can be fine but other stuff needs attention if they do so. It will not work well in the current state of the game.
---
and

---
The cynicism is strong in this one.
---
I've got three. They are fun. My favorite is Anti-armor, explosive, and 250 damage assist while reloading. Its awesome
---
And you've missed the point that Bethesda has already made it plain as day that they're willing to nerf the shit out of Legendary gear to keep things fair.  TSE weapons are already on the chopping block and it would take no more effort to nerf Assassin/Sentinel gear as well if it becomes enough of a problem.
---
No kidding. Dang, that sucks! I'm sorry. 
---
This mode isn't targeted for you.  
---
then you should be happy about the new mode so tryhards with TSE will go bugger off and you can play with other people who dont like to pvp
---
That's it Phil? No... "Hi, I'm Phil... this is how I kill shit... call me!"
---
roflmao
---
When can we expect a patch to this patch? Your server are worst than ever. Stop trying to introduce pvp, fix your game first! It's tiring to lose workshop because your servers are not strong enough. Or better, an offline mode! Or private servers or whatever
---
The problem is that the current state of balance (or complete lack of) means that you will simply be 1shot without ever actually engaging in real PvP. 
---
They said that they'd fixed that in the last patch, but I haven't tested it. I did test some of the other things and found them the same as before.
---
Speak for yourself because this new survival mode is what I hoped 76 was gonna be like in the first place

This is my build.. Its more of a 'bloodied' setup at the moment with fairly high survivability, no power armor. I only use lever action rifles in different variations (bloodied explosive at range, bloodied/crit damage CQ). With this though rely heavily on vats/vats crits. The hunting rifle is too slow imo and the Gauss rifle is heavy (even moreso the ammo). I did use a combat rifle for CQ for a while but found I just like lever actions alot lol. I only ever carry 2 guns on me (outside of looting), so thats hard for some people. If you want to make gauss ammo weigh less you give up some other areas, so there could be a couple things to change here.... there are quite a few posts about similar builds so do a quick search and you'll find more posts about skill selection and different variations. 
---
My gear is crap, doesn’t mean it doesn’t work
---
I found a OSE 10mm in watago recently. I didn't know they existed either. 
---
Doesn't carry weight effect stealth though too? If so then a fast travel overweight card wouldn't be as good as  reduced item weight cards if you're doing a stealth character.
---
What they should do with weight perk cards is make them effect the stash, but lock the card if unequipping it will put the stash over weight (till the player manually reduces the stash weight to allow the card to be unequipped). It's so dumb that with all the weight perks I can carry more than I can fit in my stash box without going over weight.
---
Yeah I'm not even loading that up if it's existing  characters.
---
PVP bad.
---
Upvotes to the left 
---
I'm not a hardcore player and I won't play survival unless it is a fresh start server.
---
In fact, I'd wager real casual players who don't already have full armor and explosive weapons set ups would prefer a clean slate server so they actually stand a chance.
---
But maybe that's crazy.
---
I am nuclear man. It did nothing lol. 
---
I was hoping that they would rebalance defensive camp structures. 
---
Thanks. 👌👍
---
Since you are starting to turn a friendly discussion into a personal attack, I am just going to respectfully disagree with you here and move on. Take care.
---
How is it going to render it useless? Isn't it just bringing it in line with other prefixes? 
---
Bonus damage to specific creatures is 30%, so more damage but the tradeoff of needing to swap to the weapon when facing that specific creature, or having it in the first place.
---
10% extra damage while mutated is less damage than two shot will be. 
---
Assassins is 10% more dmg to players, still less than 2 shot will be.
---
Berserkers and Bloodied will do more damage now, but with the trade off of requiring low health or armor which puts you at a disadvantage.
---
Furious requires build up, Executioners needs them to be low health.
---
You do realize before this upcoming nerf, Two Shot renders ALL OTHER PREFIXES completely useless, not the other way around.
---
To be honest it seems like youre being quite dramatic, Two Shot will still be the best all around damage buff not requiring specific circumstances.
---
Never said it was a "Hardcore" survival game, but it does meet the requirements to be considered a survival game. Hardcore implies perma-death in instances like this.
---
With what you want to change, it'd basically make this FO4 easy mode multi player. I too would like to be able to play FO4 with friends, but this isn't that game, its a different one with a lot of the same elements.
---
i can see that if it didnt take so long to make a build/character. imagine having to do poseidon up to 3x every month to have a generator or grind enough mats to craft excavator armor so you can have a PA station to repair your set... or have to do the main story every time to get your x01.. etc.
---
I have never found one, but I know they exist because I've seen people with them.
---
So was the core game so par for the corse really.
---
But I’ve throughly enjoyed this game since BETA despite all the noise about dups, glitches and scandals so maybe I’ll enjoy survival mode too.
---
I'd really like to think so, bobblehead stacking is #1 issue right now beyond game stability
---
Mass confusion, WHYYY the fuck add a new game mode? Who asked for this?
---
People who complain about PvP got participation trophies growing up 
---
50 acid is enough. Are you online?
---
They don’t need to nerf adventure gear. They need to nerf pvp gear. The only reason adventure gear is even talked about is because of the pvp that exists in adventure mode. The new pvp mode makes that fairly irrelevant
---
Oh my bad friend, I’m a casual level 211 unarmed rifleman. I have two pugs and I will show them off any chance I get.
---
RNG isn't fair.  Those leaderboards will be full of whoever gets there best drops.  At least now most people have a 2SE , decent armor.  Let us carry our characters over.  
---
Low hanging fruit. Although, didn't someone find a new pvp arena type area. There might be some new stuff.
---
Gees,.. that's brutal. I don't blame you for bailing. I'm at that point myself. The only hope I see is MAYBE in time these cheaters will eventually move on to another game to ruin. 
---
Sniper/shotgun build level 85 here.
---
Snipers have the downside of never doing a great amount of damage. The one I have, modded, has 170 damage.
---
The upside is that the gauss rifle is affected by rifleman cards and it gets really op.
---
I have a legendary two shot gauss rifle with 390 damage! Its sick! And ammo as easy af to craft. Lead + steal. With ammosmith card you never run out of ammo.
---
You can later mod the gauss rifle with cool mods available at the enclave bunker, suxh as a night scope.
---
I still use my marksman sniper rifle mostly because 308 rounds are common as hell. 
---
The cards you have are cool, dont forget to add Tormentor in the luck tree. Its crippling effect is directed to rifle builds.
---
Another card you may want to level up is sneak. Very useful for sneak attacks from a distance.
---
Finally, the close range attacks. I think melee is op in this game. The All Rise sledge is probably one of the best 3 weapons in the game. Its a game changer!
---
You can also get a good combat shotgun and mod it to become really good. For me, combat shotgun is in the fact the best and most useful weapon in the game.
---
Yes, but it seems that if you aren't making them by the dozen it's not worth doing. Sometimes with armour I've made and scrapped 20 to get one plan, but I scrapped 20 handmade rifles and got about 12 plans.
---
It's a right pain.
---
Im just about to finish homework
---
ahh, gotcha.
---
The safe word is...'safe'
---
Odd, my sister's boyfriends cousins dads son said they had to move all their back stock out to the shelves. I wonder what it could mean?
---
You can at least try to balance it though, just because it's unfair by nature doesn't mean we can't try to normalize things and ensure a good experience for *every* player
---
Exactly. Is the game perfect? No. am I enjoying the hell out of it? Yes I would hate for them to just shut down the game because others don't like it
---
Id like to see community managers that can do this themselves!
---
Thanks rumple for posting it but WTF Bethesda, start training your community managers to use social media platforms, forums and reddit. 
---
If they are going to be on here hiding the info in random threads its just causing more issues and makes it look like you don't know your arse from your elbow
---
Upvoted for visibility. Had this quest stuck in my logs since launch day +1 (PC), and this is the first time I’ve seen it addressed on here.
---
Looks like this Cold Case... might freeze over. /sunglasses
---
I'm glad you at least admit that it's all about you and your play experience.
---
Nevermind the people that don't already have two maxed out characters who would join this server and get shitstomped repeatedly, then leave without a second though.
---
I am not kidding: http://imgur.com/fc9XqkW
---
I think this can be solved with a simple toggle or flag for new characters. 
---
Both modes could be available to old and new characters, but there should be an option for new characters to only be matched with Survival only characters. Call new characters created for survival only "hard core" or something similar, and they are only matched with other characters of that type. 
---
I absolutely get that folks don't want to start over and want to play the new mode. But there is another subset of players who can't stomach playing on the current playerbase because the integrity has been ruined by dupes, exploits, and bugs. I am one of those players, and would love the option to get excited about playing with only new characters that are protected from this. 
---
Best of both worlds!
---
My kind of dating site
---
Roger that, give me a shout in a little bit then 
---
I bought the game for PvP. Given that I have played TES and Fallout games previously... I don't know why I thought that was a good idea.
---
What's the point if you want to start a character more than a week into survival release? 
---
nice this is what I was looking for, would be really cool if someone had the #s and the formula for the absolute top max. When I did the quest where  you go into the bog under wotaga and into the mine i just casually snuck past every scorch beast all the way to the door!
---
lol, I am aware of the definition and meaning.
---
My point being whenever any gamer, regardless, hears "co-op game," the connotation is a team game.
---
Even as you pointed out, calling it co-op would be misleading since you would still have the option to be against or not work with other players/factions/teams/etc. It would only make sense if it was more of shared experience game-mode, not a "peaceful" game-mode. They'd likely just call it Pacifist or Peaceful.
---
The Bethesda plz list hasn't really been used much. 
---
You can still buy FO76 for $15 at Costco. They haven't removed their copies.
---
Fortnite is fun to play.  Proves PvP &gt; PVE in a popularity sense.
---
It didn't become the biggest game in the world by having just Save the world game mode.  PvP made that game.
---
Did you just yell at a bot like an angry confused child?
---
Both are the problem. Even without bobbleheads a tse can kill in one shot but only if pvp is consensual. Bobbleheads shouldn't be able to stack and tse need a nerf, simple fix but people are infuriated because they want to be one shot gods even tho this isnt the game for that
---
I think that if they aren't targeting me, someone who is *literally* building a raider group for PVP and i dont want this, and the community at large is shitting itself. do you think that MY opinion is very far out of context with the larger masses? no. it is not. So bethesda better start caring PRETTY fucking quick, or i can spend my fucking money and time, elsewhere. 
---
If everyone starts over at level one, that's about as even as it gets, no? 
---
I invested months into my character. So, how is that time invested paying off for me then? Making a pvp build for the update was all that kept some people playing so I hope they don't listen to all these posts clambering for a complete reroll. 
---
I do occasionally send crash reports but the funny thing is they don't need to take my word for it. All they have to do is play their own damn game.
---
PvP is proven to be a major factor in a games success.  
---
Who is it targeted for then? Because clearly the fans aren't having any of this shit tier idea either. 
---
Can someone tell me whats happening? Haven't played the game in a while and am curious about this.
---
even if they weren't duped or taken from the dev room, they exist. Players will acquire them legitimately or otherwise.
---
So if someone acquires them one way or another is this making a good pvp game?
---
I'm pretty sure that 5 sentinels/assasins armor + lone wanderer = a flat 95% damage mitigation while standing still and 60% while moving.  a player has at least 250 health so you'd have to deal what, 5k+ damage to kill this player?
---
Assuming bobblehead stacking gets fixed and after the TSE nerf there's going to be vanishly few ways to achieve this level of damage and keep in mind 100% melee immunity should be pretty easy to achieve so even melee builds dealing 10k per blow might be useless.
---
I'm also pretty sure that with all dense mods in every armor piece + rank 5 fireproof explosive damage is completely mitigated, there's reports of people surviving point blank TSE shotgun blasts and post nerf I suspect that will be easy to achieve.
---
PvP is a pretty different ballpark though and with open pvp who knows what's going to end up being actually meta.
---
My point is you shouldn't time gate people's progression by RNG and try and make it "competitive", because RNG and competitive ( in the sense of gaming competitive, being fair to players to reward skill over luck ) don't mix
---
I... Think those are his owners.
---
I’m EST. On break at work but I’ll be on after 10 tonight. Otherwise I’ll be on after 7 tomorrow night
---
I just love that the reason it actually exists is basically, “Because we wanted to.”
---
I asked the same question a week ago or more. I finally had my first drop last night.  exterminators with a second star of something can't remember.  I was super excited, even though as someone below said the damage is mostly weak.  fun though. especially on auto just tagging whitespring mobs. ammo is cheap too.
---
Yeah but if it takes months of farming to put together the perfect suit then the player earned it. Having someone come into pvp with duped gear for the lulz is stupid and pointless
---
The beta for survival mode
---
Well if it is a pvp server why would you wanna do quest stuff make it purely a pvp drops  would be on events like plans and stuff trying to get supply drops no fast travel there is no static drops like getting the generators from Poseidon you can get them from any event you gotta keep listening to the radio to see if there any events and if there is one you gotta be careful from other ppl make it a true survival 
---
They won’t but the least they could do is make the body set as essential as a container for 30 minutes after the fight. I watched it disappear in front of me due to the server being so laggy that no items were able to be looted
---
Apparently they're focusing on pvp. DLC may take a while.
---
I'm convinced at this point it hasn't been thought out yet seeing as they haven't announced any major meta changes for this yet.
---
more risk, more reward, more sexy time
---
Maybe a tab in the STASH that’s inter character? Sacrifice a chosen amount of storage space to be able to transfer items / caps between characters (i.e. costs 50 weight in the stash but you can trade up to 50 lbs of items) 
---
As long as its at the menu as a selected game mode and doesn't impact development on PVE / PVP content.
---
PUBG, Fortnite H1Z1 all offer Battle royal, hell even COD does now. No need for it in fallout as well!
---
I really was referring more to decorative and food related recipes. I figured with everyones focus being on leaderboards and beating eachother up that collecting everything may not be a priority. It wouldnt hurt to leave them as is, was just a suggestion. 
---
TSE's still needed to be nerfed despite Bobblehead stacking.
---
SBQ will need a nerf too, TSE's just need a nerf due to their overpowering of everything \*not\* the queen.
---
Bobblehead stacking is without a doubt unintended (Although as well, duping and the timer refreshing with reloads, both exploits, are also the centre of how stacking gets out of control)
---
Which is to say, yes, there are certainly other issues. TSE nerf was still needed.
---
You have to assume that the person you are engaging with has a TSE. I generally dont engage in PVP exactly for this reason. I shouldnt be standing there managing inventory, then be gunned down and my loot taken.
---
What system, I play on Xbox and earlier while super mutant hunting up around thunder mountain, I came across a couple entrenched in battle with a ton of robots at Dyer.  I stuck to the shadows on a small cliff and as my chameleon armor left me invisible to the untrained eye, I let loose with my Gauss, letting the couple in power armor finish them off with their hammers.  Got finger pistols and a hello, then I fell off the cliff to my demise... But I did my part.
---
Exactly, silly to see all these people whining about how it's the damn evil dupers that're gonna ruin everything like they're those meddling kids and their dog too while you can clearly see how out of whack the PvP balance is w/o even needing to consider the top of the line duped to hell and back weapons.
---
Assuming we're done with duping is a big thing, but again - what if someone wants to start a char in [arbitrary amount of time where good portion of players are fairly progressed]? There's still a huge gap between level 1 and 50 that is now even more in favor of the higher level.
---
Personally, I'd be all in for some servers that did regular wipes. 
---
They are most likely going to Sam's club and walmart.com at a discount. 
---
That's the most you can get from this post.
---
I had to leave but l’ll be on in like, 2 hours! 
---
There was mention I think a post or two ago where BGS were alluding to a content update within the early part of this year, which I guess would be within the next few months.
---
I've not seen anything to indicate that new content would be made available by the patch due within a few days.
---
Which platform? I like to have passive team mates so I can solo and log back to the same world.
---
Craft some...?
---
It doesnt matter dude. Imagine some dude starting in this new mode 6 months AFTER it was released. Crazu huh? Everyone is in a disadvantage if didn't start at the premiere of this mode and race to get the highest level and gear.
---
\*shrug\* If you tell me you saw a UFO I'm much more likely to believe you saw something you didn't understand than I am to believe you actually saw an alien spacecraft. I don't doubt you died in 6 hits. Given how buggy this game is I wouldn't even be surprised if something else bugged out and you didn't take proper slap damage. But all of my actual testing in game has max'd out at 5 damage per hit.
---
Did you charge it 5 times? It’s basically a laser musket. It seems to not happen when you charge it. At least the last time I tested one.
---
Then for both our sakes, stop talking to me. I don't want to deal with inept children.
---
I'm am very much looking foward to them for alot of reasons.
---
1. End to griefers and people you don't want around you. A server locked to invite only um yes please!.
---
2. Modders getting into the game itself for content and not just interface mods like currently.  I truly love the modding community and what they have done for us in previous games. Some of the content they create is insanely amazing.
---
3. I have pages of people on the old mates list and i would love it since the servers cap at 24 players to just have 23 mates with me. Over 23 randoms and have people sitting in ques trying to join in.
---
the millions of bugs it launched with should have been evidence enough of that
---
Not sure if I'll still be on... but send me an invite and I'll accept tomorrow when I get home from work
---
That's ludicrous. You'd at the very least require a stash increase so that people can keep backup gear.
---
Even then I just don't see this happening.
---
&gt; True but better to have a level playing field at day one then never having an even playing field at all
---
Most people won't even get to play all that much day one. What's the point of having a mode that'll only be kinda fun day 1 and then ruined due to the lopsided playing field? Either fix the elephant in the room or don't even bother with the mode at all.
---
No problem
---
Nah not the few days, but we do have vaults opening somewhat soon
---
Understood. I'm just a bit bored with the queen and I don't Perfer pvp much. So for me it's starting to fell like I may stop playing soon. 
---
Don't have the plan... 
---
Lol I play on console. You have to be trolling at this point.
---
Why do you think I'm asking🤔💭
---
Idk why that would make carrying over dupe weapon less of a problem.
---
So pretty much like with real guns?
---
I would jump over the moon currently the main method is bank alts. But it sucks to have to ask a mate to xfer your days items over to one of your banks each time.
---
I like how you assume anyone that doesn't agree with you is a carebear.
---
That's fair enough. Might be time for a break until they get that new content online.
---
While I do think they are genuinely trying here, it’s quite obvious that they are failing hard at winning hearts and minds with these decisions. 
---
I have this sneaking suspicion that they are using this brand to capture the fortnite player base or trying to mirror that highly successful business model ..dunno what Bethseda is thinking these days... this is fallout.
---
A for effort ... but, just like laser guns in this game, it’s just not effective.
---
I'm not sure how I feel about some of that, but I'm really disappointed that they're allowing existing characters in survival mode at all. With all the duping and exploits, we should have to start a new character for that mode.
---
Just give us a way to mail to our alts. There you go, infinite stash space and no server load.
---
Yessss, being able to have a “guild” and “raid” SBQ’s would be soooo fun 
---
We tried warning you guys...
---
this sub literally stuck their fingers in their ears and screamed "i'm not listening!"
---
this isn't many people's first bethesda game, the writing was on the wall
---
Well Bethesda finally responded and it looks like they are takin IMMENSE hate and backlash for this update, hopefully it becomes retroactive.  It was at that moment, they realized they fucked up.
---
It would simply kill the idea....as nobody who has ANYTHING would play it...
---
I disagree. They are banning dupers more and more now.
---
There are already 3 posts in the Hot list covering this. Why another post? Just add your comments to those ones.
---
Also make her drop good loot. 3 star lvl 45-50 gauranteed please.
---
&gt;murder fuck
---
My new favorite expression 
---
Goodbye.
---
Sigh.
---
Fallout 76 is an offshoot title.  Like ESO.
---
Multiplayer IS the focus of this title and PvP is ingrained in its mechanics.
---
I guess that may be necessary. I did like being a shop keeper and the role playing :) 
---
Seasons? :)
---
Player bases arent fragmented. Just the type of gameplay. Also it's not like you'll ever not find a server with people on it. Breaking up into different servers would not hurt this game. 
---
YES! I just hate walking through a place that's already been looted by someone else. 
---
OH and of course mods.
---
They made a fatal mistake in targeting a competitive demographic with a game that's easier to exploit than many indie games... 
---
They're just not prepared... The engine.. The mechanics... The balance issues... The constant new exploits... Not to mention actual hacks on top of it all... It's gonna be that story of the guy doomed to push a boulder up a hill forever all over again... 
---
Just separate into pvp and non pvp servers, and keep them separate.
---
Also, make the pvp flag not turn on for pvp players until level 60 or something so people have at least some chance to farm up a build before the gank fest begins.
---
I think there a solution that makes everyone happy:  
---
*Just add an additional option for "hard core" when creating a new character, and only characters with that flag set on creation are matched together.*
---
This is a best of both worlds situation: 
---
- Current characters can experience adventure and survival mode and switch between the two. 
---
- New characters can get a "fresh database" optionally with the "hard core" flag, and will only be matched with other players on servers meant for hard core survival. 
---
This lets everyone get what they want. It creates an option that players are clamoring for (myself included) to start fresh without the impact of the rocky start (bugs, exploits, XP balance / exploits) of the retail launch. 
---
I've stopped playing completely (as has my large group of friends) because the integrity of the current player servers is destroyed. So much progress has been made to stop it from getting worse, but the damage is done. For folks who aren't bothered by this, they can keep playing (adventure and survival) and would not be impacted at all by this new option. But without this new option, people like me are stuck. 
---
With the nerfs to explosive and two-shot weapons and the new system in place to catch people using 1000 bobbleheads and such it really shouldn't matter.
---
I've leveled two characters already. Making me do a third for some FOTM server would be asking too much.
---
Can... Can you read?
---
&gt;I'll still take a few weeks of enjoying a hardcore server over no weeks.
---
Yeah, I agree that ideally damage would be balanced and dupers will be banned, but we've been asking for that for months and it hasn't happened, so pretending like it's definitely going to happen in the next month is just naive. 
---
100% bro for us in clans it can be frustrating not to play together. Also really annoying that we can only have 4 in a group over the reccomend 8 for Queen kills.
---
I see tonnes of clans on the text chat mod that are even larger than ours. So i know we are very far from alone on this issue.
---
Please make survival mode a fresh start for everyone. This is the only thing I have seen since launch that makes me want to pick the game back up again. There is no way I will try to play this against people with ANOTHER huge head start.
---
By the looks of it, vaults are like WoW dungeons (aka instances), and they hopefully will drop real good loot and be a good alternative to the laggy and honestly shitty SBQ. Bethesda has said they are focusing on the map they have right now and not making new worldspace. Overall I really prefer PvE to PvP as PvP has no incentives, however once factions start up I will definently consider PvP. In the end, I'm pretty excited to see what bethesda has planned. 
---
Sidenote: The quest "Follow the Overseers Journey" can't yet be completed and is presumably the future of content until we eventually get wrapped up in new stories. Despite us seeing her presumable death, we can assume her journey is a lot longer than what we have now.
---
I have all fallouts and love the idea of PvP.  For Fallout to grow its player base and tap into causal gamers they need a PvP mode.  
---
Just about everyone I've teamed with in fallout loves it.  It's not like they are changing the game, this is separated from adventure and won't affect those who want to remain in  PVE.
---
I get people are worried.  It's not traditional fallout.  But so isn't 76.  Never has their been multiplayer.  It's uncharted territory.  This new mode isn't for diehard fallout fans, lore jockeys etc.  It's for gamers in general who want to test their wits against each other.  Sports would be boring without some element of competitiveness.
---
No problem Sir!
---
If you don't mind my asking, what exactly do you hope bringing your old character into a new mode will bring? What do you think the new mode will add to your experience?
---
Yea that is exactly what I do! Sometimes I get into the ammo hoarding mood and charge in fists-a-pumping and go ham.
---
You can keep your character, but any item you have can't be transferred to the survival server. You will spawn naked. Survival and normal mode are stash separated as i described in the post.
---
The funny thing is is you guys are posting all this hate but youve never even seen anything of mine for yourself. People these days i post up wanting to sell stuff and that instantly makes me a piece of sh*t duper.... Right come see my invintory and telp me im a duper again please or send your troll ass to another post.
---
or wright notes .keep a journal . all of the above would be nice 
---
The duper might be banned but their duped items remain. Why needlessly transfer them to this new mode? 
---
Furthermore WTF is the point of a "survival" mode if you can level/gear your character safely in adventure mode?
---
Aware? I would be VERY surprised if Bethesda wasn't aware.
---
Whether or not they'll deal with the issue in the upcoming patch...? They alluded to dealing with exploits in the next patch. We'll have to see if this is covered but it bothers me that they don't even acknowledge the issue at all. It's the not knowing that's worrisome.
---
I totally forgot to consider the Wanted System in all of this. I say for this mode, do away with flagging the person. There’s going to be so much accidental PvP going on with everyone flagged from the start that I don’t think it would balance well. Make the caps reward a nice surprise when taking someone out.
---
Sure I will join the band wagon of saying we need more space....
---
It's already dead from dupes. They'll never get them completely patched out. And even if they allow same characters for one day, they will transfer those guns and items over and dupe all over again. Not interested in returning even for survival mode.
---
£24's worth of new hair styles there if you not suing earned Atoms :(
---
Atom shop shouldn't be selling stuff like hair styles, add a few more free every few months or a way to unlock them in game.
---
At least with .50 cal you get that ammo printing bonus. I've been trying heavy weapons for a bit and it's the only thing really worth using in my opinion (and the only thing I can remotely even keep up with the ammo demands for). The LMG in particular is totally useless. 
---
This was from the top thread
---
I completely and utterly agree with this statement.
---
Will the azerty fix also include VATS?
---
Absolutely, it needs to be hardcore!
---
Word!
---
He could have legendary 50% armor penetration, but not Incisor as that is a level 34 perk. But yeah 2h melee weapons in particular can be pretty strong, especially with a power attack and some good legendary effects like Intimidating that doubles the damage, or 40% more power attack damage, etc. A lot of guns are pretty week unless you get some VATS perks and crit then they can be pretty OP.
---
Apparently any difference to crafts after +20 is negligible
---
It might actually use up the bobbleheads, especially if you drop aid too. Now broken guns need to disappear, make crafting great again.
---
I would probably come back and play this game again after quitting two weeks in if they made it a separate game mode. I have no interest otherwise. 
---
We've commented this in other threads, but I just wanted to reiterate in this one that we are absolutely listening to the feedback, suggestions, and concerns over Survival Mode. At the risk of sounding like a parrot here, this is just the start of the conversation and nothing is set in stone. We also see the concerns for PvE players, and while I can't give details yet we do also have new exciting content coming for you as well! 
---
YEEEEEEAAAAAHHHHHHHHH (DUN DUN DUN DUN)
---
Hi, I’m an unarmed/sneak/mutations. Casual player, like long walks on the beach. Im in central time but I play 4p-8p most nights. I’d like to play with you. In the game that is. :) 
---
It is? I've heard someone say the exact opposite,  but I dunno
---
My understanding was that slap damage still applies even when bobbleheads are stacked to ridiculous levels (A video was floating around awhile ago that tested the idea you could be one shoted while passive), however some griefers are using methods like contesting workshops you own for just a moment, which automatically places you in PvP with them.
---
Yeah that's how bad the problem has become because of dupers. Almost everyone immediately assumes the other person has a tse, and odds are they do have one
---
&gt; Player bases arent fragmented. Just the type of gameplay. 
---
"Hey friend, want to go engage in some team activity?"  
---
"Sure thing, join my world!"  
---
"Oh you're playing survival, I don't have a character there."
---
Ahhhh I launched nuke at Lvl 21. I did it because I can
---
I second that...
---
Or make fast travel possible when over encumbered
---
Or zero weight on ammo n scrap resources 
---
A big BIG reason I think they should be divided isn't the potential level discrepancy. That will happen within the first week of a new virgin PVP mode anyway.
---
It's because if it is separate they can be more aggressive against dupes, hacks, and imbalance.
---
They can rollback the pvp server after a dupe is found with less hate than rolling back the entire game for everyone, or wipe all of a broken weapon from just the one game mode.
---
Yeah, taking extreme measures would still get some flak, but if the entire point of the PvP is balance then I would think the community would mostly understand.
---
Can't do that with the rest of the game without major issues with the community. 
---
Weird, once I got past 40 I had to start using other guns then HR due to ammo issues.  Drops way less and takes more to get the job done.  
---
i dont care about the mode being seperated or the players or base being split. I care about the fact that you're going to allow characters from a clearly fucked server to enter into a clean server where PVP is supposed to be the entire point. THIS IS FUCKING STUPID. It has 0 to do with how much of a fan or what kind of fan you are. It IS BAD DESIGN. 
---
 Seriously stop crying.
---
You should have made a better character instead of crying.
---
This is a Safe Space, no one will judge you.
---
Thank you for the thoughts and feedback on this. We're taking everyone's ideas and concerns into account. This is still the early part of the conversation and nothing is set in stone. Please keep talking to us so we can shape this into a fun an exciting mode that you'll really enjoy!
---
You realize 5000+ people want new characters for this new PvP mode right? Specifically because of dupers with unlimited stealth boys and other various overpowered gear/items.   
---
If we dont get to start over, it has to be hardcore pvp where you loose everything on death so exploiters dont get to reap the rewards for cheating.
---
Looks like you're right, this would be down voted.
---
&gt; The problem with forcing people to make a new character, is if you are not in at the beginning, you will have a hell of a time catching up. 
---
How is this any different to people spending a bunch of time bringing across their items, duped, bought duped or otherwise?
---
The only difference is if it's new characters only, then everyone theoretically starting on equal footing as they won't come in with the advantage of past duping methods.
---
It may not do much for those that use new duping methods but at least you knock out a good chunk of these cheaters (self-made or bought).
---
That's the one! He's a special guy, never wants to get out of his pool. Little odd but keeps to himself unless you need to go ask for a cup of sugar or a legendary weapon or something, dude just flips out.
---
And sell packs, gotta get them packs hey!
---
Always wondered why Perks were in packs for us to open, guarantee we see some of them Epic (the moving ones) on the store at some point not sure why they even added animated perks into the damn game. We can't see them when we play. The only reason i can think off would be a reason to have packs on the store.
---
Many plans are helpful for pvp, such as generators to power traps for your camp or pa stations so you can repair pa if that's your build
---
Let alone the time it takes to get weapon plans for upgraded receivers, scopes, suppressors
---
Or the plans for shielded underarmor for increased SPECIAL
---
First you need to really look at your own build, is it maxed with perks like tank killer and rifleman for rifles, is it maximizing explosive damage (considering thats what you used), and is your armor rating maxed for your level? Power armor at low levels is pretty bad but still much better than regular armor all things considered. Also the current meta is melee (TSE nerf effects arent implemented but are coming) and melee is very, very powerful for a build maximizing it. Id say with the 50 perk points we have access to, melee is very worth it and you can still afford space to maximize rifles too. Overall, if you want to PvP you need to max out the best build you can, but if you just PvE, play how you want because the content isn't that difficult
---
The minority is always the loudest
---
Leaderboards made me laugh. What in Fallout combat requires skill? It's all RNG.
---
he looks like the strong silent type
---
The engine works better for single player. It was made for single player. They had to literally re-work it from the ground up for 76. That's why it's having so many problems.
---
Dang March is pretty far away.... however glad you gave us plenty of time to suggest ideas and how the gamemode will actually work.   
---
As you can tell already, much of the community is already afraid of dupers bringing over all the "goodies" and griefing players. 
---
I'm usually against it but I'm starting to just not care about the game anymore. It's so boring and monotone that I dont care if they wipe progress or not. The best method would be wipe character inventory, not the entire characters 
---
When I was in my mid-teens, you know what I did? Grief players in a pvp game. Sounds awful, but it was the funniest thing to me at the time. There is no doubt in my mind that a bunch of players will just grief any newbies that spawn.
---
Reddit represents a very small amount of the total people who play. 
---
Watoga train station I got a 3 star submachine gun exploding and junkie and 1 perception by 3 star robots and two shot ak47 at golf club white spring 
---
Then ask someone to play on your type of server. Wow has 50+ servers and didnt get a consolidation until recently. Have 2 server types is fine. Stop being a baby.
---
Pvp servers are hardcore players. 
---
Pve servers are ranged from casual to hardcore.
---
I can play as the sniper that I have been trying to play as.  
---
You on PC? 
---
I would totally play a fresh server if everyone had to start at level 1 again.
---
How would you start a new character in the survival mode if you are joining the game 2 months behind?
---
If you cant build the character in adventure and then transfer it over, low levels will get absolutely massacred while trying to farm anything decent to fight back with
---
Not all hero's wear capes sir
---
Wooooooooooooo I'm The Haunted Piperifle!!
---
Yeah I'm not saying that plans aren't gonna be removed just saying that all plans can be randomized for the drops at events or supply drops
---
Me and my 3 IRL friends who bought this game assumed there would be real pvp. There was not. We then spent a couple months being toxic griefers. Got bored quit. 
---
Good move devs! This new pvp mode will bring back 100% of the players I know personally and will lower the griefing done by players i know personally by 100%.
---
Or the nuka world commercials
---
Factions don't mean anything in Fallout 76.
---
I realllllly would like to see the digital one in full res
---
One of the community messengars posted this in a different thread check bottom :Hi everyone,
---
Yep wipe player inventory.
---
Take the dupers assets of them and punish the morons that spend real currency to cheat and get an advantage over the people that work hard at playing fair.
---
You could say the same for most online games. If it helps, i lead a 30+ member community on PS4 that is all dupe-free that is in favor of a brand new fresh start for pvp to keep things fair. Some of my members even suggested "Seasons" where your progress wipes every 1-3 months. 
---
That's the thing I don't get, cause I more or less agree with you-- why not make a PVE hardmode server? It has actual precedent and would likely appeal to a lot more players. 
---
This is why I suspect it might be a reaction to critics, cause a lot of them focused on how PVP seemed like a weird, unbalancing addition.
---
So I get people are talking about unlimited stim packs, ammo, and what not. But we forget that we do have a carry weight limit. Sure they have great if jot fantastic gear, but thay doesn't make them unkillable. It just makes them a tough boss fight. Besides if they run out, then they would have to get to their mule account to replenish. Not to mention that you would have to repair gear alot on both sides to keep up with it.
---
I get it. The exploits ruined my lil shop and people don't need one star weapons or small things like that. But I don't see a reason why we need to create a new character. As someone mentioned, dupers are getting banned slowly. It will all fall into place in time. I just want more pve content :) 
---
The problem is it's such a short game quest wise. I feel like there should have been more unique quests and more faction quests in general. 
---
Dumb idea, let people get strong in Adventure then transfer over. 
---
They seem to be pretty common in The Mire but I don't have a specific location.
---
&gt;The best method would be wipe character inventory, not the entire characters
---
That's what I was thinking. The current game is so infested with duped items, that it is not even close to resembling what was "intended" by the devs. Great legendary items should be rare and hard to come by, and thus deeply rewarding to acquire. Instead, they are everywhere. This also has the effect of making the game less challenging by letting everyone acquire super equipment way earlier than intended.
---
In one of the higher voted posted the community manager mentioned there is PVE based content in March along side the survival mode. I think this got focused on because they clearly need the communities help for balance. 
---
I absolutely will not play Survival (or any new mode like it, really) unless it *requires* clean-slate characters, and allows no sharing amongst characters from other modes.
---
I can see them allowing character transfer for the beta only, with a wipe afterwards.
---
Duping needs to be fixed is all i worry about. 
---
My character is fine. I'm thinking in terms of general beginning balance but thanks for your input regardless. 
---
It takes too long to grind for stuff for me to have time to start over.  I can imagine the same goes for a lot of others too. 
---
&gt; Then ask someone to play on your type of server
---
"Hey buddy could you just level up, complete the entire story, get all the relevant plans and gear yourself up so we can play together?"
---
&gt; Wow has 50+ servers
---
WoW had over 9 million players and "servers" had thousands of concurrent players on them.
---
FO75 has... less.
---
&gt; Have 2 server types is fine.
---
Having two server types at launch is fine. It's a valid decision in game development.
---
Segmenting the player base four months after launch is a terrible idea.
---
&gt; Stop being a baby.
---
Resorting to name calling, nice.
---
wrong
---
almost 400 hours in game, prob at about 30-40 nukes now and about 10-15 SQB's ive never once got a TSE shotgun or TSE handmade or Lever action.
---
Before the duping they were rare as rocking horse shyte.
---
You don't have to "catch up" with other players. after level 50 that base stats are the same. Hate it when people say that catch up line. Run your own race and don't worry about other people. There not cheating so they are not harming you. If your on a PVP server there is always going to be a bigger fish on the server that's fact. 
---
Allowing dupers and cheaters to carry over into the new realms just because people don't like the idea of someone else being "ahead" of them is ridiculous tbh!
---
Have you tried stacking those chems? Because I don't think it's going to work. And for crafting all you need is 20 to get the 200% durability. But if it's correct you get extra XP for intelligence then that is a reason at least to stack Intelligence up high when grinding. And perhaps for scrapping.
---
Night vision hunting rifle is my go to weapon, takes out most mobs in 2-3 shots unless it's a scorchbeast which takes awhile doable just annoying. I found if I hip fire aim then quickly scope and take the shot I hit for max damage while in stealth. Trouble is the scorchbeast bounces around a lot.
---
You actually gave me a bit of hope. If the vaults are like dungeons then it would be cool. But I think it's time to put the controller down and wait. 
---
Btw theyve already been banning people and im still here so that should be obvious that im not a duper. Secondly your so angry over something so simple. The club requires you not to be a duper or sell duped items. I wouldnt join if i did.... Also i guarentee every single tse wepon you have is a duplicate. No matter how big and tough all you guys want to try and be all of your hatemail is just invalid and irrelivent so it just makes you guys look like the idiots for posting hatemail on a users post for just simply tring to sell items. So ill make sure to let everyone know not to sell anything anymore ever again until they ban dupers or you instantly become a duping pos. 
---
Junk needs to be weightless after scrapped then the game would be better that is all that takes up my stash and then I have to drop good weapons
---
I will visit soon, looking for serums.
---
Makes sense in that way, good point. Legendary items probably won't be as easy to farm in survival mode.
---
Although I can see how that makes sense to a degree... your over looking the fact that “adventure mode” is already fucked out of whack by duping. Your hard core... do it again amigo.
---
Powering up. AI initiating. Scanning protocols and rules of engagement.  **Current Objective:** Patrol immediate area and neutralize any hostiles that pose a possible threat to Bethesda employees. **Status report:** Green. All systems within acceptable operating parameters. 
---
Alright so coming back to this to report disappointment; Hit this tonight when it had ghouls before, after it was just all level 68 scorched with ~4 Glowing ones. Not as expected. So OP it may be good sometimes but it's hella disappointing to launch a nuke and get that...
---
I disagree. This game is Fallout 4 with multiplayer and survival difficulty. The only difference between what you say I want and what this game is, is a part of a difficulty. That is it. Fallout 4 had this exact same mode. You’re honestly telling me they can change the PvP modifiers but cannot remove thirst and hunger and ammo weight? I don’t believe that for a second and would wager my suggestion is easier to implement than their “survival” mode
---
Yeah that ammonia most likely gone. Have to check if you're using an assaultron head that the ammo loadout  looks right l. If not, put all but one cell away, fire the gun (load if needed), then get SOME ammo back out and test it. May seem like a lot to do to make sure you can use the gun, but I have one that let's me load 20 shots, love saving it for crits.
---
Would you like to buy some Atoms?
---
I think alot of the push for pvp was planned way back before launch to focus on the Fortnighte or what ever it is called market.
---
Would explain the atom store setup and a few other odd choices for Fallout. Hopefully once they start to see that the majority are still over in the adventure mode all work will turn back to focus on pve side 100%.
---
My first ask would be that the camp spawn before i do... Most of the time i spawn and i have to wait a good 20 seconds for my camp to spawn and even at that it shows up in sections... sometimes getting me stuck to the point where i have to fast travel back to my own camp to get out of it. 
---
You're right.
---
And it generally represents the people *more invested in the game.*
---
Which means people here are *more likely to have finished armor sets and good weapons.*
---
Which means *chances are good that EVEN MORE people than what you see here would want a fresh start.*
---
I wish they would release this as a practice round or something. So we can tell them what works and what doesn't. 
---
r/boottoobig
---
Here's a compromise: If you don't want to start over, then don't. Nobody will be forcing you to do so. Stay on adventure servers.
---
Simply because you and a handful of other players don't want to start over to play survival isn't a good enough reason to deprive the overwhelming majority of the player base of a fair, even playing field.
---
Luckily, based on enormous feedback and recent Bethesda posts, it looks like we won't have to worry.
---
They are playing other games. Let me know when you see a dev or a bethesda employee actually tweet, instagram anything their doing in 76.
---
You wont find anything
---
While I'd love for content like this to be periodically added, I'm under no illusion that it'll happen that way. Cosmetics don't effect the game substantially, but are a nice bonus for those who care so I get it.
---
I don't mind kicking in a few bucks here and there when I'm low on atoms if something great comes out.......I just want the stuff they're putting out to be great at least!
---
The amusing one on Ark is when you're using the dire bear/rhino charge and lag over a small lip and are suddenly 100s of feet up in the air. (I've also inadvertently jumped a spinosaur (they get speed buffed by being in water) fully over an island by hitting a small sandbar)
---
People would never accept it but it's pretty much the only viable way to fix the state that dupers have left this game in. Once we are absolutely sure duping has been removed from the game for good we need a server wide legendary, aid and caps wipe and hard reset. Everything you have you keep other than caps, aid such as bobbleheads and obviously any legendary weapons or apparel. And just like that it's done. 
---
People would shit though.
---
I had the same punch in the gut reaction. 
---
At least give us the option to start a "hard core" survivial character that is only matched with other "hard core" characters. This would do exactly what we're after and create a "new" database of characters and servers, but let current characters play survival too with the "old" database.
---
I've the legs but not the arms or chest, after patch and plan nerf it seems like it's going to be impossible, another + for higher level players who got everything before all the 'improvements'.
---
I have a finished character though and I don't want to start over.   
---
Feel free to add me Mr CST   :)
---
Bitch some more duper keep on bitching....
---
Thanks for the reply though i had forgotten to place you on the ignore list as i do for all dupers.
---
Yep, #metoo. I have a routine, I follow it and then I'm done.
---
It's OK, I mean I find it quite relaxing really, but they need to address other issues like only getting the same dailies each day. I've only ever gotten the *same* ones every day since launch. 
---
I know there are others, my team gets others! 
---
for the competitive aspect and the rush of pvp like it was felt in games such as DayZ
---
You've made some fantastic points.  I see where you are coming from.  Credit to Bethesda for not having cosmetics behind RNG.  
---
Yes rainbow six was a fine example for microtransactions done right.  Renoun was earned from playing the game and being used to buy a particular outfit or skin.  After time though they introduced loot packs.  Still  earnable by playing.  
---
Eventually came the paid loot packs and so on.  It got to a stage where I didn't want to support those practices and quit playing.  Since doing the weekly and dailies I have been able to earn some atoms.  The thing I don't like is time limited items and the fact they had a sale before a set price, which is illegal in my country.
---
I've managed to get the items I like.  Blackbird, flooring x2, hot rod, camo combat armor, t51 Xmas paint.  But for the hot rod I needed to buy atoms to get before it went out of rotation.  Now I'm a bit more savvy in the fact I'm sitting on some and will wait for data mines to save up for.  I still think reused fallout 4 assets should be free in game and not in the atom store.  However with some gameplay it can be earned.  
---
Some of the items need to be reduced.  Like I see no value in a small square jpg that range from 50-250 atoms.  Or a camo gun skin for only one type of weapon.  However their sales data probably show this.   
---
I love the game regardless and thanks for writing a very good argument for the current system. 
---
Either this is horrible satire or you havent even played the game. Or maybe you're one of the people with ridiculous OP gear and know EXACTLY why new progress is needed yet refuse to give up because you that without it you wouldn't survive. The economy of this game is ruined and a fresh start with pvp (which is the most unbalanced part of the game) is desperately needed
---
But the point of the op's post is to make them meaningful :) 
---
r/iamverysmart
---
that’s because new vegas was made by Obsidian, creators of fallout. now it’s been destroyed by some money grabbers (: 
---
PvP isn't for you. It is always optional in Adventure mode though. Whining got PvP gimped the first time around. Don't ruin everyone's fun just because your pants don't fit.
---
This idea that "new characters only" will somehow fix any of the issues everyone is predicting is bunk. 
---
No duped items is about the only benefit. 
---
OP players? With tons of high end gear?  Only new characters will not fix that. 
---
Within a day or two of the mode releasing these new characters could be power leveled and farming . 
---
This level playing field will be gone in the blink an eye. Unless you can invest dozens of hours of play at the launch of the mode, you will be behind immediately. 
---
 Move along. 
---
LOL YOU LAUGHED OUT LOUD?
---
....
---
No there are a ton of people who play this game legitimately that would not be fair to them at all
---
That's still such a fucking non-answer though, it doesn't give any sort of timescale or any idea of what we can get excited for, just "More stuff is coming in an unspecified amount of time"
---
I've built a pvp character since beta and you think I should have to start all over?  Screw that. That would hurt the player base that's stuck with this game.  
---
No markers on the mini map means people will just sit at train stations because the map is huge. Trading or needing to sell or buy will be the only place you'll see anyone. 
---
There could be mulitple PvP modes. PvP that allows transfers... or Hardcore PvP where there is 0 transfers and more lost on death. Lots to discuss for sure.   
---
As someone with over 500 hours logged, i feel your pain.. i dont want to start over either but i prefer more varied, dynamic and balanced pvp compared to the sh\*t show you will see once every duper flocks to pvp with full sentinel/assassins gear, TSE weapons and unlimited stealth boys (perma-invisibility).   
---
There's pro's and con's for both sides of the coin. 
---
I want every damn stash I place to have its separate stash limit.
---
Seems like it’s going to be a clean slate.  Did they say they would allow you to bring your current character?
---
They should use their leaderboards to make ranked servers and only allow players to join friends servers that are a higher ranks and not the other way around.
---
I'd be okay with all this if survival mode disables fast travel. Make it actually take effort to travel around and gank folks. 
---
Yes I do. If your so good at pvp do it from scratch again like everyone else
---
I wouldn't think there would be that much damage difference with a TS vs a TSE. I was given that one by a friend who already had a TSE Guass prime. I did find a TSE Dragon while farming whitesprings which was awesome. Does about 1600 dmg per shot.
---
Those have been there. I haven’t tested them in 76 though
---
I set them up in fallout 4 to ring when someone walked through the main gate of the settlements. Was planning to do the same on 76.  
---
7pm eastern time. 
---
I’m on now for about 45 minutes
---
Nice target for my Two Shot Explosive FatMan.
---
yeah, I hoped to meet fallout fans were were cool but all I've met is power hungry brats or basement dwellers who act hard.
---
I just finished watching your video it was pretty good, but 1 thing caught my attention.  
---
at 37:46 you talked about Van Buren, and said it was on going to be built on an engine refereed to as "The Jefferson Engine"  
---
This reminded me that the whole actual plot of Fallout 3 takes place at the Jefferson Memorial where project purity is held.  
---
I think maybe, just maybe, setting it up in the Jefferson memorial was a nod back to what would have been Fallout 3 from Black Isle
---
You don’t imagine that would cause a lot of crashing?
---
The player sniper, I assume. So you want to snipe unsuspecting players with the guns you've already acquired. You don't happen to have a two shot or explosive weapon do you?
---
There were many XP exploits (and balance issues) in the first few weeks of launch. It has the possibility to be different now, which is what people are asking for. 
---
I think the option to segment your new character from the current playerbase and be matched with only like-minded folks makes a lot of sense. 
---
Great pic but who’s packing the Ski Sword?  Seems low key compared to the serious hardware you’re packing.
---
The majority of your data is based on opinions about a mode with almost no information available in concrete form. 
---
And doesn't take into account that people? On the internet? Their opinions? Often very wrong. 
---
The very fact that any one here thinks a start from scratch server is going to be a level playing field in just a matter of hours shows they haven't thought this through.
---
Build additional pylons! No?
---
Spawn more Overlords! No?
---
Give more stash space! Ah, that's it. 
---
Not rare? I have to say that has changed, unobtainable now, any heavy leather plans, they did something with the plan lists in the patch, must have.
---
Thank you so much. I almost feared I was stuck with it. Super relieved now.
---
&gt;and those wanting new characters are people who don't engage in fights?
---
What backwards ass logic are you basing this off of?
---
Maybe some of them *don't currently* engage in fights because *they don't enjoy being one-shot by people in BiS gear* which is exactly what this is wont to avoid.
---
Let the OP people move to survival and fight amongst each other. All that is going to happen is you’ll have OP players on both servers. Might as well make them concentrate on one server at will
---
Almost true. Except for the fact that when we become the Genera off the Enclave means we can launch a nuke. So there's a point to one faction at least. Lol
---
Oh yeah, people cheated therefore the hours of work that everyone else put in no longer matters. Sound logic
---
Nah I agree. I wouldn't ever touch the mode if I had to restart. Just did a fresh character three days ago and the tedium levelling that up is absurd. What we need is a server wide inventory wipe and that's that.
---
Because it’s more like those survival style game like Rust/Ark/Conan Exile.  PvP could just be death match games similar to Call of Duty or Battlefield.
---
r/whoooosh
---
Mothership zeta 2.0 maybe
---
We really don't, those that think that should learn to utilize resources and not hoard gear. Keep what you will use sell the rest or give it away. I'm sorry I don't believe in collections every gun in the game.
---
And if you can see everyone on the map then people would be constantly fast traveling to run up behind someone. That's stupid and worse than people camping at vendors
---
All of my gear and mats won't fit in 800 stash weight. 
---
I just want the BB gun from fallout 4.
---
Doesn't it mean the character and all its inventory is permanently dead if killed? Sounds like it would fix the problem. People sporting TSE would eventually kill themselves if not killed by another TSE wielding asshat.
---
I have played the game. This isn’t the game we played up until now. Your a shitty griefer if u want to walk around with all your high end gear and not have to work for your survival.
---
I don't.  I can even let you inspect me in game.  I have a normal hunting rifle .308, just modded.  
---
I assume it's just retail doing their thing with old/games that don't sell. Most sales are probably digital anyways.
---
Another suggestion that [someone](https://bethesda.net/community/user/prosperitypark?language%5B%5D=en) mentioned was adding an outfit that was heavy, minuses to SPECIAL stats and less rad resist.
---
raise luck and charisma. above 12 on both and thank me later. Oh yeah being below level 100 helps.
---
While I agree with that method of thinking, it doesnt exactly guarantee it will happen. It's a gamble
---
Someone who got this game at Christmas was hundreds of play hours behind someone who has played since launch.
---
It's not always a matter of not putting in the time and effort.
---
I don't think low level players getting murdered at the vault 76 will be a huge issue (though there will defs be one or two lowlifes who can't help themselves).
---
Getting farmed for junk at LVL 20 - 50 by one shot weapons though? That's gonna blow chunks
---
Since stuff like trading and large inventories can contribute to lags and crashes this right here might be his biggest problem actually.
---
Do you have a better suggestion for fixing the economy?
---
I'm excellent at managing my space and I still would like more room. 
---
At the very least, make it a "hard core" toggle when creating a new character that only matches you with other "hard core" characters and servers.
---
This effectively creates this 2nd database that clean slate folks (like me) are looking for, while letting current characters keep playing adventure and survival without being impacted. 
---
Best of both worlds! 
---
Bro everyone gets their own fucking loot lmao
---
Yup. It ate thousands of my FC’s in one shot when I went to test the firearm a few weeks ago when I reported the issue. 
---
Bethesda simply told me to go pound sand, told me again to just eat the loss of caps, trades and time it took for me to earn those cells. Virtually the same copy&amp;paste reply I’ve had support send me on each ticket I’ve created since beta.
---
is Called spinoff... God you kids are entitled
---
You do know we all get our own loot pools correct?.....
---
Only if once you bring that character to survival you can’t bring it back to adventure mode... then maybe I’d be for it
---
You can pick a card from any special each level regardless of which specific special you picked this level. It will show you cards from the selected special by default, but you can navigate left and right to the other card sets. On Xbox, this is right and left bumper. 
---
I'm confused. New players in the game will always have to fight high level players so why would making survival mode a new character fix anything? 
---
The whe point is that if PvP was actually a. enjoyable, well balanced part of the game then they wpuld already be much less of a problem to begin with. Yet that's all people are yammering on about rather than the root of the problem: that it's a horribly unbalanced mess to begin with; dupers or no dupers.
---
*disassembles my minigun*
---
Bethesda thanks you for your money (not really)
---
That's you though.  Some of us actually want to use heavy weapons in rotation with our main weapons. I can't do that since even with 3 weapons and a few pieces of gear I am overweight unless I use power armor 24/7 which is not always fun. I like hunting for crafting mats and that is also a burden. 
---
I mean that games fun if you want it to be I and a lot of others seem to enjoy it so yeah
---
So you got massive amounts of downvotes and now want some more?...
---
Happy to help lol...
---
I’m trying to advocate for more meaningful factions. I guess people don’t give a fuck because they can roleplay with their imaginations. 
---
Whatever ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  
---
Yes but how long until a new dupe is found or people have acquired God rolled loot that puts them 95% above the other players?
---
If I could I would love for Bethesda to wipe everyone weapons and armor in the current mode.  But having different characters will discourage me for wanting to play adventure mode as I want to grind for the best PvP setup.  I can one shot deathclaws and the AI is a breeze to defeat.  I get my kicks from sizing myself up against real players.
---
I get where you are coming from I really do.  Both sides have valid points.  Either way it's going to be interesting to see what happens.
---
