I played NW the first couple weeks of it. It feels like a gutted battle royle. What i mean is, it is far behind bigger battle royles in the gameplay or mechinics

---
But Todd Howard probably is gonna be like fine wish granted but there‚Äôs a 25% decrease in legendaries
---
the best part is putting it at the edge of a floor with no railing 100 feet in the air and watching people fall to their deaths when they get off of it.
---
I'll give you 1250c for a bloodied FFR or bloodied explosive. I guess ill break bank and pay you 2000 caps for a QFFR Tesla. I'm on PC :)
---
Set up a CAMP on one of the many steel ore pits in the Forrest Region and build yourself an extractor. There are 4 such locations around Camp McClintock
---
It‚Äôs the other trials as well (I managed to buy stimpak diffusers from someone‚Äôs vendor and cleared the medic fast)
---

---
Some are harder than other on certain consoles I think (I have issues taking photos of animals) ((plus I have such a low storage on my refurbished PS4 that taking them is a bitch.))
---
People often forget how much impact a small nice gesture can effect others. Hope things get better in life, and you continue to have good interactions in gaming
---
or maby because we are "the best and brightest" we could fix up one of the abandoned motorcycles and travel like that for a price of uranium
---
You will lose your photos.  Everything else should be ok.
---
This combined all the ideas I've seen posted so far beautifully
---
true true
---
I don‚Äôt usually play with a mic because I like to play while I watch tv but I can help you out if you ever need some ammo or stimpaks
---
My gamertag is anferkneekeeng
---
That's fine just make them more quality and the 3* baddies drop 3* stuff. Then, in my book, you got a deal.
---
Lol
---
Its not fair!
---
Pretty much
---
Colonel Gutsy - doesnt matter which type is OP.
---
All explosives - UP
---
Gauss Rifle - neither, its a novelty that can be OP if used right, or UP if not used right.
---
Charred Ghoul - not OP, not UP.  Just right.
---
Are you on ps4 by chance killa?
---
Woah stop right there Satan
---
Light wood Laminate Light wood Laminate Light wood Laminate!
---
Gotta love the downvotes on this. No explanation but downvote!
---
On the one hand that would be pretty friggin cool on the other it would pretty much break the trading economy in the game and also on the other other hand they would probably nerf explosive laser/plasma weapons into the ground
---
1. Loot is personal
---
2. Fuck everyone else lol
---
Don't know about ps4 but on xbox that is never the case in any game
---
Or at least if u hunt down a officer it gives you a full launch code numbers (one time use).
---
Watch oxhorns video about iguana bits.. will tell you what it actually is
---
I hate how weak missiles and fatmans are in game
---
Ah yeah was it G2A? Or similar site? I've had issues with those sites in the past as well.. I prices are nice but always a risk.. But yes the game is 100x better whole different experience but it's not perfect it still has flaws and yes it still have some game breaking stuff that happens when they fix stuff but they are getting better and better with every update.. They are starting to learn not to rush stuff for the $$ and make sure to jot break stuff so they can keep us happier
---
Pvp is just dumb in general and shouldn't have been added to the game at all
---
The gutsy with a laser ain‚Äôt bad
---
I had a gauss rifle with exploding rounds and a Gatling with a exploding rounds, and the per round hit was way worse with the gauss.
---
Provided you do enough damage to qualify for loot, the "pool" is all yours! Pee in it as much as you want.
---
I‚Äôm actually ok with this. I‚Äôd be pissed if it happened to me but I would appreciate it later.
---
that's awesome.   so basically soylent green.

It‚Äôs terrifying, but people would stoop to new lows to live in a nuclear post apocalyptic setting.
---
I sat there once with 3 diseased spawn attacking me, with the -50% resistance stacked, and I could not catch Whoopsies.
---
Move your CAMP device.
---
I was looking for a second level 50 allrise
---
this game is an inventory management sim, cupcake. They're giving you extra bonus gameplay.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
/s
---
Move your CAMP device within your build circle to adjust where you spawn in.
---
ok so yes, on one hand, you're a fucking shitty human being, and I earnestly wish bethesda would ban sacks of shit like you. 
---
On the other hand...don't be fucking idiots, because we all know bethesda has zero interest in doing ANYTHING that any decent game developer would do about soulless sacks of shit like OP.
---
You can get the benefits of the armor effects if it's broken, so you could run pieces with -15% dmg from creatures with sentinels etc, but you'd have to use PA in nuke zone. Berserkers is a pain in the ass lol. You might be able to roll some 3* at the perv on a level 1 alt that has low DR. Otherwise Dodgy, Blocker etc. I tried berserkers during the day with nocturnal armour, noct gun at night and it was neat, nothing crazy, but it's tedious
---
Is this saterical
---
I'm a solo players as well and all I did was post on Xbox lfg and reddit and was flooded with people willing to help
---
What does LFG stand for? I‚Äôve had a few offers to help drop a nuke during thanksgiving that in planning on coordinating in the morning.
---
The Grinch could be a wendigo with a Santa hat! Lol.
---
I had a lot of fun paring rifle man with a little grenaider type. Used my few strength perks to take ordnance and one grenaider.
---
I always have a high int for batteries when using plasma or fusion.. PA perks for nukes. With a little demo mixed in get more power from explosive weapons along with launchers for the luls and ordnance lets you carry 10 nades per pound. 
---
Super fun build.
---
oh, so the 250 dr is actually applied? so it just breaks the 1st effect except on quad.
---
I had a Snowglobe of Charleston, all the snow turned to water and exploded... &lt;sigh&gt;
---
Does it say it's included....? There's usually a description with bundles that lists what's included.
---
I was actually shocked at how friendly the Fallout 76 community is, nothing like other survival games.
---
took a video of a guy auto shooting infinite ammo homing bullets today killing 95% of the match and basically killing everything in range and LoS
---
AMAZING
---
Battle Royale
---
Not the person you asked but I know there's one in the kitchen of Mistress of Mystery house
---
Did you login to find them on your character, or did they show up after an event? If you logged in to find them, there is a chance someone got your password and was loading up your character to do a dupe or something. It might be a good idea to change your password if this is the case.
---
Quad/double/two shot from my testing dont get effected, and the 250dmg resist is always applied, just it getting triggered is what voids the other effects
---
copy that. still need a dang fixer plan lol
---
There is certainly another wave of new cheater's i have noticed for the past few day's .I have stopped playing yesterday because it really is unplayable at this moment . 
---
And you are right , the only few times i have been on a cleanish server ,the bugs got in the way . So ... i am done .
---
Looking for group Xbox has a lfg system that all you have to do is go to the game and choose it's social options which is official club tab to multi-player and brings up a social list of people wanted to group up and sell/trade etc
---
I hope not!  Selling disease cures for 9 caps a pop keeps the vending going! ;-)
---
saw homing bullets and infinte ammo today auto shooting scoped lever action
---
cool, thank you
---
Sack of shit? yes.
---
Sack of good loot? also yes.
---
Most people junk it. It could have a benefit if you use cripple perks with explosive weapons at close range, but most people use PA or the Anamantiam skeleton perk for this case. It doesn't hurt to have it on there, but I have never seen anyone looking for it.
---
No. Bethesda should actually do the opposite and make it not to easy to brute force hack the launch codes.
---
Idk man I have 30 bloodied weapons and keep getting medics explosive
---
Deep Kings.  FUCK those guys.
---
I kinda want one just to wear sometimes to annoy friends‚Äîespecially the one who really hates them.
---
Same happened to me last week with uranium fever.  Got so many rewards, I didn‚Äôt even see all of it til I checked my inventory.   I was pretty happy!
---
Why no t replace the bag with a cap on its back and let it hold a log as a weapon
---
Keep doing that.
---
Safest way, unless you have friends who would hop in and do the same.
---
I've been on for a while and I'm pretty sure they've just showed up now but I will definitely change my password
---
Yeah. 
---
Flooded train yard. Just bullet and grenade sponges.
---
Same!
---
Oh i thought they admitted and adjusted the limb damage drop rates, my bad. So you do work for Bethesda yes?
---
Nice to see you're a glass half full kinda guy.
---
Thanks I guess lol.
---
One violent night is a savage divide event and these drop as a whole from

Said events.  Congrats on hitting the jackpot!
---
I only do that in player‚Äôs camp üëå
---
The sheer fucking incompetence of people. The last encrypted I saw triggered was about a minute into a fucking queen run. If I have to choose between a queen run (always works, always drops flux, worth doing) with a encryped run (over rated, usually drops garbage, in the rare chance it completes).   
---
First, you have to actually have a decent group (eight plus) show up. Three-four of those people have to do nothing but try to hold down the pylons. a couple have to thin the herd of crap mobs.   
---
It's a waste of time, because about 8/10 fail, due to idiots.
---
I‚Äôm a ‚Äúglasses are meant for drinking booze‚Äù sort of guy. Let‚Äôs all just relax and have a good time and a laugh.
---
I wish I could actually run like that in game.
---
It would be way to fucking hilarious lol.
---
...you clearly don't play much. There's a limited pool, if you don't like what you're pulling out of the purveyor, hop.
---
Isnt that what fachnaut day is?
---
Aren't you the author of that article? and isn't your other article on that website another piece of Bethesda bootlicking?
---
How much do they pay you? Would you say it's worth it?
---
I want explosive legendary effect to be it's own thing. Maybe a mod. Then they can put regular explosive back on the map. Right now all launchers are pretty bad cause they have to balance around all the weapons that have that effect. Terrible design.
---
It's funny how many people violate rule one to bitch about rule six.
---
Yeah, torches set, statue set, furniture set, mothman effigy and smokemachine... I looked closely at the picture again and it shows the torches... Not the door. I'm an idgit. Lol
---
Oh I do all my bootlicking for free, sir. Because I dont have hate in my heart for other people enjoying what they enjoy
---
What about explosive ammo like New Vegas did? 
---
Does your mod idea bring explosive back to energy weapons?
---
IFFR250 Fixer.  Got some stealth going.  Happy to hear this news.
---
Much smoother on PS4. 0 problems so far with 1st. Also loadtimes seem much quicker.
---
This is why people were complaining so much about floating camps awhile back üòî it really sucks to go to someone's vendor then die when you spawn at their camp.
---
Stealing loot or dropping it for other players?
---
My end game is just running around handing off water stims and food to newbies. I love it. Some of the most rewarding experiences I've had with this game and I've been playing since beta, are traveling to someone's Camp (I like to go to their Camp because then I can see if they're actually brand new players and not just people re-rolling a new character). 
---
 One of the amazing things about this community and I watched as it's evolved over time is that all the toxic horrible people who play other extremely competitive online games have gravitated away from Fallout 76. As a consequence I think what is left is the cream of the crop. Really fun people who enjoy helping each other and just having a fun play experience. If you're on PC add me as a friend I'd love to come and pimp out your camp, and give use weapons and armor whatever you need my IGN is kepharel
---
Thats fine. Just separate the legendary effect from the intended effect of a whole weapon class. Honestly wouldn't care if they removed explosive from legendary pool entirely. It's poor design hepd over from fo4
---
&gt;a bag of fertilizer and an insult note on your bed
---
I'm stealing this idea.
---
Dude, he's not right. 
---
Flamers differ for each Fallout because Bethesda decided to change it up and not stick to original 'small gun/big gun' weapon categories.
---
Flamers are big guns in Fallout 1, 2, &amp; 3.
---
Flamers are energy weapons in Fallout New Vegas.
---
Flamers are heavy weapons in Fallout 4 &amp; 76.
---
Sorry, who's an idiot?  
---
*I'd also like to say that the best way they did it with the least amount of player confusion was probably 'small gun/big gun'.
---
I can see that it would make more scince to some people that it's more of an energy weapon. 
---
And I can see that changing the flamer from a big gun to a energy weapon in Fallout New Vegas totally screwed with the way people think what type of weapon the flamer is. 
---
And I can now see in Fallout 76 players having confusion over if it's an energy weapon or heavy weapon or heavy energy weapon.* as a result of the changing ..
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Flamer
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a2rkre/heavy_weapon_analysis/
---
I wouldnt mind a mod or ammo craft version instead of the effect but for those guns that already have it better come with the preinstalled or some ammo placed in my pocket. 
---
I'm actually quite surprised they didnt go for the ammo crafting design of NewVegas. Was a pretty cool mechanic that opened options.
---

This. I scrap just about every weapon I come across. Esp those early ish levels where I kept running out of stuff line steel
---
I think it'd make more sense to have nukes be a bit rare. As it is, people can launch in fairly rapid succession. Maybe it'd make more sense to require a certain amount of ciphers, in addition to a keycard, to be able to launch a nuke.
---
But if they did something like that they'd really need to up the loot rewards to compensate given nukes would be a bit harder to launch.
---
They already have it in ultracite. Expand that shit... 
---
Here's the problem tho. Just like explosive lasers if they do make changes they wont delete the old from the game. Thus dupers will just ruin any new system put in place.
---
Game needs changes and everyone knows it. But no matter what move they make people will complain. I say fuck em. If they are going to bitch anyways stop trying to make everyone happy. Do what we all know the game needs.
---
No. It is a random roll each dig.
---
A guy was trying to sell a Bloodied Explosive 250DR s couple days ago. After that gets fixed I don't care what people say,  that's the best possible one.
---
I would add tormentor as well it‚Äôs very helpful for crippling hordes n large creatures
---
[removed]
---
Yeah. It really would be for certain people
---
...all this post shows me is "I didn't even bother googling before I posted" and that earns you a downvote, you lazy ass.
---
but a chance for rare plans?
---
I bet that there are 2 kinds of people out there that put their showers in the doorway: (1) they don't know how bloodied builds work and why it's not always helpful to clean rads, (2) they want to piss off bloodied builds.  If I could only tell the difference, I'd go thru the former, but not the later.  Today I got locked in someone's house... Sensor floor pad outside auto door... Key pad inside.  Well-played, you.

&gt; Theres a cool little opinion piece about \[...\]

[Dude, you're promoting your own article](https://lordsofgaming.net/author/ivan-siler/)!

Look, it's one thing to hawk your own shit here but to pretend that you just came across some cool opinion piece like you're not the author is really quite sad.

My boyfriend uses one. Has all his perks for ammo and weapons weight stuff. With his excavator armor he can carry I think around 600lbs. Drives me nuts with all the crap he carries

Snood is a part of a turkey. They are continuing the puns.

He is not an shitty person, don‚Äôt be an idiot people.

I must be incredibly dense, because I‚Äôve been playing NW pretty often since the double XP weekend a few weeks back, and I honestly couldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôve seen more than *maybe* 2-3 situations where something seemed fishy. And even then, it was borderline enough that  one could argue skill or luck.
---
I‚Äôve watched people just roll over everyone in a match, and then at the end they get dusted. I‚Äôve shadowed players who killed me from ‚Äúacross the map‚Äù with a headshot, and watched them get into the same mindless bullet spray jumping parties we all do when we fight.
---
I‚Äôm not saying cheating doesn‚Äôt happen, because I‚Äôm sure it does. I‚Äôm just saying that - at least when I‚Äôm playing - it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm getting robbed of wins by hackers.
---
K
---
Whaaaat. Is this a joke I can't tell on the interwebs
---
Only rare plans from digs are dense plans and the power armor part plans but yes
---
I never pretended it wasnt mine. I said "Theres an article",  stated what it was about, then provided the link. Down there. Therefore, theres an article
---
I set myself right next to the train station just so I can sell my supplies of drugs and extra plans for good prices, I‚Äôm trying to clear room in my stash but it‚Äôs not working
---
Related rant. Don't make me get rid of my rad arch in my doorway, turn it off after you use it, you peasants.
---
I will stand 10 feet away and eat every explosive round you can muster , only explosive weapons good for pvp are lasers or gatlin plasma
---
Well of they'd change the system up, say remove explosive, they would have to replace the effect with something else. Something worth something and not bash 2.0. I really wouldnt mind going this route as long as the option is still there for explosive rounds, but all types. It just baffles me that it was there for the first couple months then oops, we didnt intend on that. Really?
---
It is the same chance per dig. Technically, you have better odds the more you dig as each dig rolls the dice. But the first dig has the same chance to get a PA plan (for instance) as the 100th dig on the same mound.

I'd recommend looking at the levels map! And definitely get an understanding of the different areas of the map.
---
It was an issue with the community when they first released it. It wasn't the first time they did something like it and it won't be the last. People were able to get refunds for it.
---
Just some fun at it all. :p
---
They should do mythical beasts scattered around the map, Christmas themed. Maybe some dude before the bombs dropped was experimenting with things on Christmas Day. It could be multiple events like Meat Weak did then one big main one.
---
i had it happen from the enclave artillery strike event, no idea what triggered it
---
Lol we all know who is going to get the most down votes in this post... Definitely not the op...what a salty boomer... Go play bingo or something..
---
&gt; they‚Äôre all completely unusable
---
Looks up from mass of enemies squirming on the ground: "Unusable?  What?"
---
I'd take bashing 2.0! Sounds epic. My blackpowder should be a force up close. Maybe tie bashing with strength? I don't mind condition loss but it should hurt getting stabbed by a gun fashioned to be a spear.
---
And thats what im talking about... People complain. They will want something to compensate for changes that are much needed. Just remove the effect and dump 100 scrip on people and wait 2 weeks for moods to calm. Lol thats what id do.
---
only on private servers if your alone ;-)
---
What platform are you on? I‚Äôd love to have a new buddy to play with! It‚Äôs hard getting back into the game after being gone a while!
---
That's fair. I definitely give the benefit of the doubt a lot of the time (Mostly cos I suck!) but because I'm trying to pick up tips, I tend to sit and spectate the rest of matches frequently.
---
I've seen all sorts, phasing through walls, bizarre accuracy incidents, someone shooting a laser straight upwards and getting 1-shot kills and people literally just standing in the nuke storm for most of match with no problems at all.
---
For the most part, I just crack on and play but times like today where there seems to only be 30~ people around, you end up in a weird loop against the same folks and once you've seen it, you can't unsee it.
---
Definitely not trying to be salty and it's not my go to response when I get shot. Cos honestly, there aren't enough cheaters in the world to explain away my death streaks. Hahaha

So many people have fallout first. It‚Äôs a very vocal minority here that doesn‚Äôt like it
---
&gt; I never pretended it wasnt mine. 
---
Of course you did. Had you not, it might have been worded like "I wrote this cool little opinion piece...". You also dodged answering the question from the other commenter about whether you were the author of this article.
---
You tried to distance yourself from the fact that it was your own piece and you got caught. Plain and simple.
---
Also, who refers to their own writing as "cool"? That's pretty weird dude.
---
I find it bizarre that my Adventure character seems to level up way faster than my NW rank even though I'm way higher level over there.
---
That said, scaling exp would account for that I guess.
---
Also, that's a win for consoles for sure!
---
Everyone knows this

Exactly. You'd believe based on the media coverage it was evil incarnate and universally hated. But if you actually ask the people that have it, its they see the value in it

Did they fix the AA?

A what?

I need you on my friends list.

okay cool. do you know the drop rate?

This guy gets it.

And if you just play the game so many people have it. Simply do the moth man dance in a group and over half the group will start dancing to the same beat

okay cool thanks!
---
Doesn‚Äôt change the fact it isn‚Äôt worth it at all.
---
I've done archer, mamollogist and hunter on two toons now (athlete should be easy but my coordination is shit).  All pretty easy.  (Trick to killing things with a syringer -- equip syringer then throw nades).

I think anything I spend time on is pretty cool. The other guy accused me of being a corporate shill over a disagreement. So I responded to that because I veiwed that as the more aggregious accusation

Luckily you only had 1k, that's not much.

I mean, I might do it every one and a while. Its worth it for the atoms alone, but I cant see myself subcribing long term
---
I have not been getting more diseases recently. I play many hours everyday. Just the usual odds of catching diseases for me.
---
I have the max rank Rejuvenated perk card always equipped and make sure to be well fed and well hydrated at all times to lower disease chances. Also instead of drinking water I drink Inert Flux. And often make Razorgrain soup. Or Vegetable Medley soup, which provides a better disease resistance. You need : (2) boiled water, (2) carrots, (2) tatos, (1) wood, (1) salt. Easy to always have those ingredients if you plant carrots and tatos at your CAMP. You'd need to look for salt when you're exploring but it's common and if you get used to spotting it you quickly end up with a nice reserve in your Stash.
---
That said, to address topic starter ... you're probably experiencing a personal bug. I see tons of bugs and glitches of all kind everyday. Hell I often team up with someone and he sees things I don't see in-game and vice versa. Different glitches for everyone... !
---
And btw I understand if you hate watching the hunger and thirst meters, my advice may not be for you... Just general advice for lowering disease odds.
---
But I do get diseases often anyway lol. Like someone already posted, getting hit by a high level diseased ghoul is almost 100% to get you diseased. In general, seems the higher the enemy level is, the higher the odds of catching a disease. The glowing Gulpers always get me.
---
I'd like to say the same type of thing happened to me during March when one of my friends unfortunately passed away. I hate to say it but the reason people are so kind is because Bethesda is not.
---
That would be awesome :)
---
I couldn't give a fuck about fallout 1st.  The number of things that exist in the world that I don't want to buy is nearly limitless, and in all but a few special cases I don't care if other people  want to buy them.

I can promise you not everyone know this.
---
I've met some high levels, as well as noobies be surprised how I get in their house.
---
Mine is pretty good against SBs and Vertibirds, does around 500-600 and locks on. But after the missile has been in the air a while, chasing a target, it does very little damage. Still a direct hit, but no fucking damage. But yeah, it's completely ineffective against the SBQ. As is my Bloodied Fat Man

I‚Äôll PM you an invite link!

Ah you forgot junkies my old friend... And ground pounder works on semi auto rifles atm as well

No, I had thousands, like over 6k. That munitions factory isn‚Äôt fast either!

Same. Believe it or not, I even crafted some once...

Poop more, I like it.
---
Not you pooping, the idea.

Why rely on the factory when you can make 180 5mm with one click
---
How do you have that little in your stash?!
---
I can imagine some people are into that...

Yeah I‚Äôve gone through some losses in these past couple of months so I‚Äôm a little overwhelmed. &amp; very true but I love the community and game either way it‚Äôs amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è

&gt; These are not entirely private servers, at least in the same manner many of us are accustomed. A server is started whenever a Fallout 1st members initiate a private server, anyone on that person‚Äôs friends list can join at any time. However, when the server owner logs off that server closes down and boots everyone out, unless there is another Fallout 1st member present. 
---
Not quite true: the "owner" of the server can boot you out by blocking you for the session.

Better yet don‚Äôt lock your damn doors

If a hazmat suit was reclassified as underarmor, bloody builds can put their uny/poison/sentinel armor on top of it and worry about absolutely nothing.
---
That is correct. The point was more designed towards how its set up differently from just a traditional server that you can hop into at anytime regardless of if the host is online
---
I disagree, but hey. Thats your opinion
---
Inconveniencing customers, who just happen to most damage of all with their bloodied build, seems to have no benefit over just moving that arch a little.

I mean I agree, not trying to sound like I'm complaining. I just feel they could change the effect instead of completely removing it. Just turn it into something else and make the explosive effect obtainable via a mod or ammo. I could get behind that. Either way this legacy thing is pretty silly to me. Just like double...why was that ever a thing if it was just getting removed? 
---
I wish I had a BP with bash, love the bayonet on those things.

Pulling the dingleberries, punching the hemorroids - it‚Äôs dirty work.

I get locking your Generator, or for Survival, but other than that what's the point? Don't you want people to admire your camp?

I like the game, I dislike the turning of suggestions into paid items.

I want more slots. Let me make more machines, let each machine have more stuff, I don't care, but I have *piles* of stuff to sell and nowhere near enough slots for it.

Reminds me. I need to fire up the Delbert Memorial Food Machine.

I'm pissed I bought the bundle last time and now it has extra shit. Not worth it for the Atoms just to get the torches and the extra statues, they should be available separately.

Some people are just like that.

I welcome anyone in, but I understand those that wanna keep strangers out.

Holidays can be a tough time for people, staying connected with people helps fight off those difficult thoughts, and gaming is a great way to accomplish that. 24/7, you have thousands of people playing right there beside you. Stay strong, and happy holidays.

Being informed and knowing what I'm talking about requires me to work for Bethesda?

There was a bug that caused only limb damage to drop, if that is what you are talking about. That's not the same as intentionally changing drop rates like you seem to be suggesting.
---
We are all iguanas on this blessed day.
---
That's not a "bug" per se, it just shows you how they layer the graphics filters ro ge the (admittedly shitty) lighting effect they want.  Think of it as watching Leonardo painting layers of paint to make the *Mona Lisa* smile at you.

Oh I‚Äôve watched just about every one. Don‚Äôt worry. Whoring is good.

So he ruined your early game by making it too easy.  Nice.

Ok all together, that's both my stash and on me, I have 33 cherry, 22 regular, 3 dark, 1 orange, 56 quantum, 1 wild, 3 grape. However I pick them up all the time so that will probs change in like 5 mins haha.

Thank you kindly.

They should just remove them entirely. A laser that explodes on impact is just fucking stupid.

---
Well, yeah - that‚Äôs definitely cheating. I‚Äôve never seen any of that happen.
---
Out of curiosity, when do you tend to play (time zone)? I wonder if it‚Äôs more prevalent in certain parts of the world. Because a lot of people have described exactly what you‚Äôve seen, and I honestly have never seen a anything that blatant. (Although it could be happening and I‚Äôm just not seeing it.)

But the satisfaction of removing chunks of health with every punch is priceless.

When I first started I wanted to be that guy in my group of friends. Not the sneak queefer or the bullet hose. Not even the beefcake melee madman. I wanted to be the master blaster. Missiles, grenades, explosive shotguns and nukes for all. My friends even stockpiled ordnance for me for a couple of weeks while they waited for me to buy the game and level up.
---
By level 50 I had so much ammo for the weapons they had found for me I walked out into the world and began blasting. Missile launcher broke after a minute of use and constantly glitched me while walking with it i my hands. AGL last 2 minutes before breaking and sent all our loot into orbit. The explosive shotgun sucked for damage but it put even mirelurk queens on their knees. My relationship with my 2 shot fatman is still unhealthy and abusive.
---
Now I'm just another bullet hose in painted T-60. Really do wish they would make some of these weapons be fun again.
---
Or put some fun rad emitters right there, and come home to free scrap bags.
---
Yeah, walking by diseased enemies or even meleeing them seems to get me afflicted every other time as well
---
Dang. I want that turkey costume but not for $9 üòÇ

You mentioning vampire and omitting Instigating should be a crime.
---
Lmao. Like the other person said.... won't be the first time or the last! I accidentally bought something in the AS by trying to "inspect" but I didnt realize there was no inspect option, only purchase.... whatever I bought was so stupid and not something I would normally buy, that I dont even remember what it was. I just remember being annoyed lol

Did you try barbed harpoon? Does it even work?

Yikes! If it is explosive, it does ballistic damage. Explosive legacy weapons do ballistic damage. 
---
Regardless of it being hitscan or projectile it still does ballistic damage.
---
Congratulations! I have tons of tse weapons too! I have a few tse. 50 cals too! I don't have BE because bloodied builds are üí©. I play high health and rip apart bloodied players with my tse ü§£ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§£ 
---
They nerfed tse because it was OP. They nerfed it to %20 because %80 was OVER POWERFUL. They nerfed it back to normal. Still does hella high damage. 
---
Tse is not crap compared to BE. TSE is on the rise and BE is going downhill. TSE pricing are raising and BE are lowering. More people making high health builds currently vs bloodied now. Making vanguards more popular. And assassins even more than both. 
---
REGARDLESS of how many hours your character sat in game you must not know the difference between the drop rates then and now because they have drastically changed from my own personal experience and asking around. 
---
I can literally join xbox parties all the time asking people if they ever get the dragon dropped on them and everyone always says "no"
---
(Some people dont even know what the dragon is)
---
Then I ask them if they ever get the tse dragon dropped on them and that's a flat "no" every single time for MONTHS now. And these players have been playing for a long time. 
---
Only ones that exist are duplicated ones.
---
Dude I'm not a crying over the fact that I havent found one hahahaha!!!! I have found some... around when the game first came out about a year ago!
---
I'm not crying over something I have multiple of.
---
Havent found one since the tse nerf tho!!!!!!!!
---
And that's what I'm crying about.
---
So it's a legacy.
---
I did it ten times this week. Too many fedoras, helmets and outfits. Always with tons of people. Check the server is crowded, etc.

And if you launch, you should assume people expect you to be the pylon.

Get them everyone! They are not one of us!

One of the reasons I carry around so much toxic goo to eat. The other of course is because I die stupidly and I need to get back to 20% lol

Also skins that transform the hunting rifle into something reminiscent of an m1 garand or kar, port some of the mods from fo4 with permission of the modders and make them into a skin. With proper compensation to said modders.

Yep.  Those really work.

I like that idea. Repairing a vehicle from scrap and a piece of Uranium to power up them nuclear roadsters for a fast travel.

I mean fast traveling for caps is fine, but...alternatives are always welcome.

A combination of superstition, placebo effect, and a belief in luck. Everyone has their rituals, like when people held A + B + Up in Pokemon as a ritual to ensure good catches. Or when you rub a bald mans head, or slap the top of the door frame when you leave the house.

Up next on My Strange Addiction...

While reloading, not while aiming, basically it's not useful even if the bug is fixed
---
Team invite PvP. I don't accept random invites because of this.
---
This is a known exploit. The guy you joined was not in pacifist, he attacks his buddy which flags your team as PvP and then they can kill you.
---
Must've been one of those drugged up meat hook users akin to Florida Man.
---
Needle in a haystack RNG.
---
With the advent of the Camp Vendor, you no longer gotta worry about getting stuck in a bugged Trade menu screen. Make up your shop, decorate it up, set up some displays. Hell, you can put a lot of things in them displays. 
---
If a man can make a Nuka Cola museum, you can make a 7-11.
---
Yeah he was using a hook.
---
Be very careful joining random invites. That is a greifer move. Look for hidden team mates waiting to attack you.
---
It‚Äôs acid and cloth you blow through. Lead is the easiest to get ha
---
I‚Äôve got more gunpowder than I know what to do with!
---
Sorry this sounds like some super niche designer drug deal lol
---
Well to be fair there is no such thing as a dignified death moan.
---
Looks like we have what the other lacks lol  gun powder and acid to melt the ore is a pain for me
---
Well yeah but reloading a heavy weapon makes you very vulnerable especially in PvP so if the DR can‚Äôt be ignored by perks or effects it essentially gets rid of a huge vulnerability in using a heavy weapon, which is why I was wondering about it
---
lol "people who steal shit are bad" is a boomer thing now? K douche.
---
PACIFIST MODE ONLY STOPS YOU FROM DAMAGING OTHER PLAYERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
You can still be killed if you are in pacifist mode, says it right in the description
---
This I'd agree with.
---
I think it‚Äôs an awesome 3rd if your out of ammo and getting attacked whether it‚Äôs pvp or a room full of ghouls having the Dr would be invaluable the only better third would be FR , unless your a sneaky sneak build and value Vats and your ability to hide

---
Is it stealing if it‚Äôs on the ground?
---
Yes I've been noticing that. It's like you don't even hit her sometimes.
---
By FR you mean Faster Road? Do you know Speed Demon and Faster Reload do not stack? Of you mean fire rate than it's not a 3rd prefix.
---
And there is 50DR When Aiming, which is always active when you have your weapon out.
---
OK boomer
---
Heavy Combat is with certian vendors (I know Graham for sure) BOS is from scrapping, it's a pain but you will learn them eventually.
---
Well it's an bout an item called scrap this in the scrap box that appeared on me all my post about have been removed
---
Yeah. I did it too.  At least I got a smoke machine now.  And the torches are pretty cool. Ugh.
---
Well if your opponent suck enough to not being able to kill you after you firing a whole clip you might as well not need the DR lmao. It shouldn't take that long to kill someone.
---
Can you recommend a good sub for coffee lovers
---
I meant FR with no context of speed demon  as thirds go , I feel your opinion of it as a third perk are way off 50 DR Auming being active without Aiming when is news to me you sure about that? I mean it dies say ‚Äúwhile aiming‚Äù
---
I try to hit the face, it does more damage
---
This is not new- it‚Äôs maybe the oldest method in the game
---
I set up my C.A.M.P. In between the Whitespring and Blackwater Mine. My stuff is pric d fairly, nothing has ever sold for more than 5000 caps except for a quad explosive railway rifle. Magazines around 10-25, bobble heads around 40-50, is my stuff priced fairly?

I have a locked power room to use for trading.

It's common sense in this game that every legendary effect that says while aiming, means when you have your gun out.
---
I took my doors off and prefer the large single windows, hop on in wherever!!
---
And who doesn't have speed demon? Noobs? Lmao.
---
Me too. :D

A stable part of the launch ceremony.

Thing to post about the scrap this at the scrap box item

A few people have posted their results on here after several hundred treasure maps.

There was a post awhile back about how to solo it, can‚Äôt find it but it involved every possible damage improvement, super stimpaks, and powerful armor.

Upvoted for the poop.

"What in the living heck is this" is not a descriptive title. It gives no context of what the post contains, so it was removed for rule 6. Feel free to repost with a better title.

I don't understand how it works. But I have also noticed with my two main characters I don't even spawn into my camp "circle". I'm plopped down on the outside of the ring. Kinda annoying for my camp near water because you are dumped into the water and I can't build a pier out to that spot.

Last time I activated it. I was running 2 pylons...  Cool no problem.  I was level 50 or so and hit like a wet gym sock....  You guys shooty bang bang, I zappy zap zap.

What pissed me off was I burned through a ton of stims until I realized that even though the event was over, and I had fast traveled, the that I was STILL taking pylons damage l.  Had to restart to get it to stop.

You can get the BOS combat armor plans from the Grafton train station iirc

During first couple days of 1st some members lost items that were placed in the scrap box. BGS sent out those" scrap at scrap box" items to some players as a replacement for the lost junk. Some 1st members got them, some didn't. Enjoy the stuff

This is unfortunately not just a Fallout 1st problem, but a life problem. It's a bell curve of happiness, which means a small group loves the game, the majority of people that neither love/hate the game, and a small group that despises the game and flame it. The group that yells the loudest is heard by the most people. Since the people who tend to hate something are the most vocal and most passionate, they dispaportionally get represented as the majority. This is a common way to get attention, albeit negative attention, if you need a further example, just ask Karen.

nope you gotta hit the pipes and boogie like hell, the second "wait for results" ends your time drops to 30 seconds and the goal is to build time up.  pump codes add the most time, there is a map floating around somewhere here, and the pipes add a tiny bit of time.
---
the main bug right now is that the pipes need to be manually hit instead of being able to be shot, running theory is that it is similar to the mainframe core silo big.

Or at least a bonus for drug use...  Maybe a longer effect...

yep my bad, its not at my shop but at my house where my crafting is. came back to the game and didnt understand why people forgot how to use radaway after i left. i shall install a switch on the outside for you and your cults kind!

this guys guide has a map of most code spawn locations if it helps.  imo this is the hardest one to run standard/expert on because of that time drop.

They've done this on a large number of packages. They either include pictures of non-package items that are otherwise in the atom shop, or include pictures of items they haven't even released yet in another bundle. They do put out a list, yes, but it *is* misleading to include a picture of an item that looks like it belongs in bundle but isnt. 
---
Halloween bundle 1 really took the cake for me, the second picture had the witch on the wall and the hanging bats or something. Problem is, witch wasnt included in the bundle. Wasn't included in *any* bundle until a week later. But if you are in charge of taking the advertising images, simply stop adding items not in the package to make it look full. If its not looking like a full enough package deal from the few pictures of actual items included that you take, then it's probably priced a bit higher than it should be.
---
It *is* misleading advertisements, done purposefully to sell more by seeming like a better deal than it is and many companies do this because it works.
---
If they go with my charity idea, sure.

I personally think 18k Atoms for skins is way over the top.

pretty much the only way to deal with those players as a passive player is to not seek revenge, block them for the instance, and server hop.

while losing the workshop does suck you could always plant veggies and craft soups to deal with water/food.  an alternative is the quite popular option is run good doggie+ dog food or cannibal + lead belly
---
Ok ,..when you can‚Äôt back your argument ,default to pvp ingame smh , honestly if your right I‚Äôll be the first to admit it , however you haven‚Äôt supported your argument with anything but name calling and ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù so unless you have something to teach this ‚Äúnoob‚Äù (your words )  then I think we‚Äôre done here , Was honestly hoping you‚Äôd teach me something new but I think you may have gotten a bit salty ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If I leave my front door open after putting $100 on my coffee table, you walk by, see it, and take it: Yes, it's stealing. Am I an idiot for leaving my door open? Sure am. It's still stealing though. If you don't use private servers/trading interface for legendary traders it's your fault. If you steal something during someone elses trade, that's also your fault.
---
Noooooooo I'm Xbox lol
---
What platform are you on?
---
thnx brotato
---
Aww. I though you knew......then again it happens all the time lol. Oh well.
---
Not the same. Don‚Äôt feel bad for people who drop stuff on the ground.
---
My god waaaaaaaahhhhh
---
Cool! I‚Äôll pm you
---
Lol I saw an idiot selling serums at 3k a piece we blew his base up
---
üêë üêë üêë
---
Well here's the clues.
---
Sun rising(or setting?) on the east so your facing south
---
Hill range in the background appear to be a fairly large hill based on the slight up hill you are at and mostly appear to be in a straight line going left to right. 
---
You have to find that mountain thats high up going left to right
---
There are no other buildings or random things so you know its off the beaten path
---
I know a few places where it could be at. Ill try looking tonight.
---
Well done!
---
Yes, clearly reporting a player for engaging in an in game mechanic is called for. It's a dick move to kill newbies, but it's a cuntbag move to try to get someone banned for playing the game.
---
Did they actually take over the workshop? They could be just initiating takeover just to fuck with you.
---
I haven't been killed by players for quite some time but I remember there are 2 revive options, one allows you to keep fighting after reviving; and one allows you to block them (like a black list thingy, doesn't show you on their maps and doesn't show them on yours) and stop the combat, until someone shoots and the other retaliates which initiates combat.
---
They can jump higher because of a mutation called Marsupial. There are mutations that your character can get in this game. These mutations gives you different abilities or stat boost for the cost of a negative effect. You can contact mutations through rads or serums and lose them by using radaways. If you have the perk Starched Genes you will not gain or lose any mutations through getring or losing rads. With the perk Class Freak the negative effects of mutations can be reduced.
---
This game sucks ass.im getting a refund now the accc has called Bethesda out to be pushing a shonky product.even got a chance of getting the refund through the ps store...that will be a first and I'm looking forward to it.after fallout 76 I will NEVER buy a Bethesda game as long as I live .A broken moral compass for a developer (stealing off children) is a death sentence for a company....know this .EA is worse but your failure record is growing.after what you did to 76 and elder scrolls there will not be a third time.
---
Just dont waste your time on workshops. Yes it is a waste of time.
---
Private world fixes that.
---
Yeah, the current weapon skin system is stupid. Prices are too high, the skins are too limited, and the skin options are questionable.
---
I finally found a use for missiles. I have an executioner's quad barrel with tracking, and I use it to finish off cargobots for keycards.
---
What is PKOA?
---
So you don't have the guts to face the truth but to be a baby and just fucking around in this thread.
---
I don't know who is the one actually looking salty here but I am not the noob who got called out and I am not the noob that replies three times in a row looking sad.

Report a player for playing the game? Soft
---
Keep crying kid I‚Äôm sure someone will care soon.
---
Won‚Äôt be me
---
It‚Äôs a game, relax and maybe get a life.
---
Ahhhhh.  Thanks.
---
Were you on xbox? Bro I came by as a level 130ish by myself and tried to team up with you to try to help your camp out and to warn off high levels because you were vulnerable. I stayed and gave you some plans to help gaurd you. I wanted to beef up your camp and I fixed your turrets for you but you didn't accept and kept building ridiculous waste of space.  Add me and join my world and I'll protect your shops BrainRot31415
---
Maybe doubling it for 25% off days would be nice.  That way I‚Äôm not playing storage control.
---
Makes sense.
---
For 100 a year. Lol. Fuck first, you are the worst!
---
Definitely some little details in this image.  Yes you ste correct.   Good luck and thanks
---
A responder said it, what do u expect?
---
Awww thank you so much. I would appreciate hugs! Would love friends to play with üòämessage me anytime :)
---
I was impressed.
---
Up voted.
---
Bwhaaaaaaaa.
---
You have yet to back your argument with facts , I‚Äôm humbly awaiting this üòò
---
I got a 90% reduction nuke launcher (I think it's even a named one) and it's the only reason I keep one around.  Even at 90% it's still heavy.
---
That's a bummer for console players. Sometimes I wonder if half the reason some of the bugs in the game are patched is more because they can't figure out a patch that works with all three systems. It seems like most of the time it's the PS4 that gets the raw deal. I assume PC runs the smoothest because that's probably what the devs use in studio.
---
Ive alerted regional manger that a miss karen? Would like to speak with him. I can also alert todd howard, the ceo, and cfo if needed. At bethesda customers are number one priority
---
Enjoy the 1500 rounds! :)
---
Lmao. Yeah ok dude. Youre the crying about the vocal minority and constantly bitching about other peoples opinions in a game. You could use to get a life as well
---
thanks!
---
good look. does rare item in vendor inventory im guessing?
---
I am GodParti on xbox. Short for God Particle. And youre welcome. Sometime i love gaming solo due to some days i just need my own bubble... But i would love another gaming partner and xbox friend for the days i feel up for it. Im home all of the time from a disability from some huge traumas... So gaming is my adventure as i was pretty nomadic before the disability. Youre ao welcome. Things get better... But it is the now that matters. Sip a hot cup of tea or hot chocolate... Take a bath... Sing your fave songs... Dance like no one is watching... And tell yourself  worth it.
---
No one cares kid- move on. Or don‚Äôt.. however you spend your time (as pathetic as it is) is up to you. 
---
Have fun bud.
---
Well not really, scrip are not used for trading but for producing Legendary, which is the End Product, so scrips are actually more like a material. You scrip bad rolls to get good rolls, eventually there will be more good rolls on the market, good rolls should become cheaper but scrips might be more expensive.
---
If they want to help with inflation, they should make caps sinks.
---
i‚Äôll make sure to kill a few legendaries with them in your honor
---
If anyone else wants to educate this poor noob feel free to corroborate this fellows claims .I‚Äôd love to learn one thing new today ü§ó
---
Nah bruh the whole game is broken.
---
You are TRULY AMAZING üòä thank you for the inspiration ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I have 90% weight reduction,30% damage Scorched Beasts.
---
 I carry 4 x 40 mm Shells,come in handy now and again..
---
Launched a few at  Glowing in the entrance at Whitespring Club House.
---
Did the trick.
---
Is the list of upcoming sales on the bethesda site?
---
Lmao keep masturbating your ego, it's sad to see player that trade as much as you do don't even know such a simple thing.
---
Seem like you care a lot about what i have to say as you continue to show just how stupid you are
---
And im not your bud
---
No need to get angry bud- once again it‚Äôs just a game. 
---
Maybe take a break from it :)
---
This is just a guess, but I believe the spot you describe has a treasure map burial spot. Maybe that prevents camp placement.
---
I'm definitely down with different types of ammo for most of the guns in game. Change out the receiver like with prime to shoot different calibers. 10mm to 50 like a DE. Or 10mm to 38. How about buck shot to slug, so we can fix these busted ass, nerfed to nothing shotguns back to something useful. Speaking of calibers, am I the only one who wants the Handmade changed to 7.62? I know there are lower caliber "handmades" or AK's, but its the most common caliber in the world. Hear me for 2020 Bethesda, "Make AK's Great Again". (Joke, satire, kidding, this is not a political post whatsoever, it just fit well)
---
Just farm 5mm from mutants, easy 100 ontop of making them
---
If you know how to craft to mod maybe just find a player to sell you screws?
---
Playtime varies massively for me because of my work but most of the time I see it is around 11pm-4am GMT (3pm-8pm for you).
---
Happy Thanksgiving.

Being depressed sucks, so hang in there.
---
Don't be afraid to call these guys: 1-800-273-8255
---
They helped a friend of mine after her divorce and father passing away. 
---
The two things happened within a few weeks, so she was in a really bad place.
---
Now she actually works with them.
---
Selling is a lot of fun.  I love the cash register sound when something sells.  If you're low level you're best bet is to sell junk and bullets.  Most bullets sell at 1 cap per.  Most junk also sells at 1 cap per but some of the high demand items like lead, plastic, etc sell for more.
---
4am GMT happens when this comment is 43 minutes old.

Wouldnt waste any screws if I knew if any vendors sold the mod.
---
Still waiting for the back to your claims sweetie
---
Is everyone here 12 or something?
---
I just leave and don‚Äôt shop. Hate those dam things. I‚Äôm a bloodied unyielding build I don‚Äôt use them.
---
Typical workshop strategy if you really want to try and have a workshop in adventure mode is always crouch, take it and get out. come back later if you want to build on it staying crouched. Never defend it when the mission comes up. Wait till the defend mission is over and then come back and do the retake mission once again crouched so no one can see you on the map.  If someone else takes it while you're not there write it off and move on to a different one. Good luck.
---
Even then, if there‚Äôs a group of three enemies, the nuke would only kill the one hit centre and I‚Äôd still end up bashing the other two. Plus given the weight of nukes, it just wasn‚Äôt worth it.
---
Officer outfits we have enough greens
---
Still waiting for you to have some guts to make a post asking people, or just Google, or just search Reddit. It's one click away baby.
---
Found out myself. They sell the mod plans but not the mods themselves. Raider vendors, Phoenix, Resin, Wallace.
---
Any decent bloodied build your can hit 10k+ with only a little more work you can get 18-20k pretty easy.
---
Pulling?
---
Ok man, you do you.
---
You know what ruins PVP for me? An invisible level 200 one-shotting me while my level 8 self tries to claim a workshop for 10 Atom Points.
---
You will lose 30 minutes of your internet bandwidth downloading it again.

Only thing you need is an m14 or m16 for vietnam

---
Just waltz through the whitespring and check all the different vendor types. If you see one selling a flamer plan go scour the other similar vendors.
---
It was helpful during the Halloween event!
---
Where is vendor bot resin. Ive never heard of that?
---
Smells like whores milk with hair and extra pulp
---
Again with the self projecting. Keep trying dude you might hit the mark eventually but it is fun to watch you keep being a fool
---
I wonder. Have you tried assigning it to a display case?
---
Nukes are end game for a lot of people. More is better. Silos are the tedious part. 
---
No need for nuke codes to be so complex. They are crowdsourced anyway. No one does it all themselves as maybe Bethesda planned. So they should just change it so we don‚Äôt rely on a group of nuke crackers or dataminers to get it each week.
---
The last few times I've initiated it, the players that turned up (all high level, mind you) just sat on the cabin roof shooting robots. None of them became pylons, even when I asked on voice chat.

Either educate me or quit trying to ‚ÄúWin‚Äù this argument with ‚Äúits common sense ‚Äú and ‚Äúnoob ‚Äú they are not very compelling arguments in your favor

Youre welcome and thank you!

I don't have to try to win nor I am trying to because I am right. I am just waiting or hoping you might actually just search it and evolve from being a baby.
---
Why? Do you like hunting code pieces? Sometimes you get 500 options for codes after you find the pieces. Then having to wait 3 days for the hints to be released. That‚Äôs crazy man.

Ahh my true home haha

I'm the worst why? I didn't attack him.

Didn't say i had it. Just that it would solve the asshole problem. Get a job and u could even get it.
---
At the Whitespring cottages, if there‚Äôs a diseased glowing one upstairs in the bathroom of the large house, I will get glowing pustules when I walk into the downstairs bar.  That‚Äôs a mighty strong affliction.
---
This isn't new. Why did you accept the team request of a griefer?
---
No. But they could get rid of the decipher so if you hunted down 5 officers, you have the code. And the code is character-based so you can‚Äôt look for it online.
---
Last word
---
 Still better than the Rolling Pins and Pool Cues she gives me.
---
I am still to see a player running around with a Rolling Pin.
---
Oh snap beat ya to it!!ü§£
---
Its sad such a cancerous community can completley ruin others experience. Imagine all the people who really needed help you ignored because of this.
---
Looking at the titles of your previous posts to this sub, I can see why rule 6 has been an issue for you. If you're asking a question, ask it in the title. Don't say for example "question about Encryptid" and then ask the actual question in the body of the post. Be as descriptive as possible. 
---
As for clickbait title, that means the body of your post doesn't match your title or is factually wrong. That one is pretty self explanatory really.
---
This is even more childish of you, might have got some answers already if you'd just make a post or search yourself, sigh, really a baby.

I must be crazy, because I think cannibalism is possibly the most disgusting activity one can engage in.
---
I have a bloodied Fatman and missile launcher and they apparently nerfed them awhile back because it says I should be outputting massive damage, even with the perk cards to help them out, but it doesn't touch a SBQ it just tickles her and that really upsets me
---
Jokes on them...you don't drop flux anymore until after you store it.
---
No you are not, it's just eating ghoulified people is waaay more disgusting.

I did not try a barbed harpoon, no.

Kindness is great. I've been in a funk too. I deal with Crohn's disease. Hope you have a happy Thanksgiving. If you ever need to talk or need a teammate I am usually on after 9pm PST 12am EST.
---
Pacifist does not make you immortal, one dude was afk at a vendor - i threw a few nuke mines, killed him and took his junk , i even left a "you have been insulted" note
---
Well... It is becoming more frequent for some great spots to be unavailable. Wastelanders might have NPCs living there. I had to move three of my camps.
---
Oh yeahh, man i havent been down there in a while
---
Wow amazing! Where can I subscribe to your amazingly pointless blog?!

when she lands i switch my heavy build from gatling to AA cryolator to keep her in place for the heavy-hitters to do damage

Not the first time I've seen Fallout 1st guuuud argument lately.
---
I bet he got sponsored and received the membership for free.
---
That's my suggestion. Request a refund.
---
Next time check to see what the bundle actually includes. Don't just trust the pictures.
---
Whoops! You're on the subreddit for Fallout 76, where PvP was an advertised feature of the game.
---
All the iguanas are afraid of being impaled cooked.

Build lots of lowest level handmades and scrap away, you will learn the mods pretty quickly.
---
Farm steel from super mutants and lead from Lucky Hole to build 5.56 with Ammosmith, superduper and scraper perks.
---
It's 13 per month or 100 a year.
---
Step 1. Level up Gunsmith to whatever level handmades can be crafted 
---
Step 2. Walk around collecting junk 
---
Step 3. Scrap junk at a bench 
---
Step 4. Craft many handmades 
---
Step 5. Scrap all those handmades you just created
---
Step 6. Mods (Profit)
---
This is what I would hope for like a relatively larger scale, so you could actually make your camp look like a winter wonderland. But unfortunately knowing Bethesda, if they do a snow machine, it'll probably just be another variant of the smoke machine, because it's easier
---
Lol, I mentioned a very closely related suggestion after they delayed Wastelanders. Good to see other players suggest random encounter human NPC's too.
---
1st is a subscription, and a relatively expensive subscription at that. Whenever you want to start playing the right time to buy. Personally, I‚Äôm on the way out but there‚Äôs still some value to be had for a first time player.  While it‚Äôs had its fair shake of controversy, the world itself is worth the price of admission.
---
Yes it is! I hope you a happy thanksgiving as well and okay thank you so much üòä
---
Oooo, or even just snowglobe miscellaneous items (because if it was junk you'd accidentally scrap it) which can then be displayed and it would make it limited time
---
Yes
---
You cant. Some players are just pathetic cancerous pieces of shit and cant be combated because they have meta gear and your not even level 50. What you could do i load up their bases with a couple nuke mines.
---
Of all the weapons that should of had an explosive option.
---
Not to mention the 3 bolt one in NW.
---
Excellent. Thank you kind sir
---
Hey man, happy Thanksgiving. Enjoy yourself in the game! What system do you play? I'll get on with ya sometime :)
---
And thanks to all the friendly 76ers, I doubt I'd still be playing if it weren't for how awesome everyone is.
---
My VE bolt action pipe rifle is the same boat for when I do rifleman instead of commando
---
To be clear lead is a junk item but it's a good junk item.
---
SHut up you!
---
Yes it's a cool display case.
---
How dare you?!
---
I drop 1 spoiled and a Propaganda flyer.
---
That's it, I'm sold. Next missile launcher I get I'm doing that.
---
It‚Äôs not original. And you can get much more imaginative.
---
Leave a single rubber and used oil.
---
Sure bud
---
You need two for when they break in long battles lol
---
Lol. Yep, I came to the same conclusion.
---
When a claw does more damage than a nuke...
---
We cant help growing older... growing up however, is totally optional. ü§™
---
Try a scan and repair through bethesda launcher yet?
---
Could also try cutting your inis from Documents\My Games\Fallout 76 and pasting them to desktop to let F76 create new ones.
---
Issues with any other games or 3D benchmark programs?
---
Yes, a set. I got them, they were only the same animations with new display pictures. They mislead on discount and description. I got a refund and got to keep the emotes. They later tried to make amends by adding snow animation to the emotes and Christmas Bells sounds
---
Are they? Seems like Bethesda has pretty much always considered them novelty weapons.
---
Lol. Yes please.
---
And add in some Christmas music while this is happening.
---
Ok dude
---
Yep, it is at [atomic shop update 15 items and sales](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1aFesqB2KkW2Nv6eUr8blG/atomic-shop-update-15-items-and-sales-november-26)

Mr. Fuzzy 50% off Nov 29 - 30
---
Give me a M1 garand and 1911a1  to go with that uniform.
---
Oh, I know. Have had this happen with a few things now...
---
I have a feeling that if they take the time to actually do this, it would be an Atom shop item.
---
Fast travel how does it work?
---
I have a PS4 :)
---
I‚Äôll try that. 
---
It happened literally right after adding this super sketchy guy so idk if somehow people can mess with your game through the friends list?
---
Agreed. I got a bunch today at whitesprings
---
I know
---
Thank you, that clears things up for me\~
---
I see\~
---
Yeah probably. But we could hope.
---
Not with the display case. You can somewhat display it by vending it for 25000 caps
---
Nah, it's just 76.
---
You should try teaming up with other players too...It shouldn't be too hard to find people willing to help, this community is SWEET. If you prefer solo better try new tactics.
---
appreciate you reply man! So youre not gonna duck back in for wastelanders and stuff or?
---
I think Final Fantasy 14 (online) was more expensive though so for me being on disability it's actually quite cheap in comparison.
---
We've seen all kinds of bugs since release, and while I wouldn't immediately dismiss it.. I'd say unlikely related, but super weird given previous lack of issues. Last time I remember hearing about a bug similiar to this was from BETA up until about Feb '19.
---
As I mentioned, start with the easy stuff. I'd even go so far as reinstalling graphics drivers just in case. Unigine Heaven is an older 3D Benchmark but fantastic for stressing a GPU; has proved invaluable when troubleshooting failing RTX cards for me.
---
Thanks for the advice! Currently scanning and repairing. It‚Äôs taking a bit but hopefully that fixes it. If not, I can try reinstalling the drivers, but all my other games work fine. I think I‚Äôll just reinstall the game if this doesn‚Äôt work.
---
Thanks!
---
I admit, I don't fully understand what you're saying but do whatever works for you, wastelanders isn't far away  , so you can start then too.
---
They absolutely need to stop using objects other than what is explicitly offered. Refund every product that does this.
---
That isn't what that said at all
---
There ok
---
I enjoy making power armors and hanging with friends. I don't mind doing the right thing but I'm no hero, so I'll be neutral. 
---
Plus npc characters are only fun for some time , after some time later, they're just repetitive bots
---
You could have gotten worse
---
Yep sounds good. Final Fantasy online (14 not 15) is like 35-45 dollars per month bought through the official moggle station store. So for me its a pretty much wasted game purchase for me. I'm hoping with Fallout 76 you are saying 13AUD not USD (but you probably are)
---
I meant British pounds. I live in the UK,  not sure what it is in dollars
---
Yes, but lead ore is not. You must refine lead ore at a chem workbench to turn it into usable "junk" lead.
---
I think so. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been selling them at and they always move.
---
Ok the tesla is op for pvp but stealthboys are ok
---
Nice
---
I would honestly love that (or something similar)! I think paying a few caps would obviously still be vital as not to abuse or break Fast Traveling, but maybe it could be at a reduced price, given that you can only travel to certain locations via railroad (or whatever other traveling system). It would definitely add something new to the game!
---
*salutes*
---
I've had the Unstoppable monster up to 1500, how is 10k even possible?
---
I just wish they would add different missile types.  Rad missile would be .... rad ;P Cryo missiles could freeze down a Hugh area. I would dig up that ts ff launcher I got in storage.
---
How precisely does one push a dingleberry?
---
Speak for yourself.
---
It depends on your build?
---
Raiders. So I don't feel bad killing the ones I hate and feel good doing a good act
---
Welcome to Fallout 76
---
Unfortunately
---
Human meat
---
Lol nice try little tadpole
---
As it should be.
---
Never said to feel bad, quite a lot of people do bad things and feel no remorse, I'm simply stating, yes, it is stealing. It is taking something that isn't yours. I recently had the same conversation with my 6 year old. As a former police officer, I've also had that same conversation with grown men who've tried to justify theft. I get it, he shouldn't have dropped it.
---
I‚Äôll probably pick back up and give it a try for sure!
---
No problem
---
It was always meant to be a community hunt for codes. The game designers probably assumed someone would make some community tool to aggregate the codes, and someone has.
---
Cards are $55 for 12 months on ps4 for ps plus which you need to play the game. 1st edition gives you a couple extra items but the game it self doesn't have a subscription on console.
---
Raider's... I'm a trapper gourmand with 3 trap bases and a steady flow of victim's , looking forward to the roleplay aspect. Rose would be so proud...
---
Children of Atom
---
Missiles need 10x the damage they have now.
---
That is why I moved it to the side of the door and have the machines outside
---
Just done a pound to AUD and its coming up - $25 roughly, damn that's expensive.
---
Fair Game... Raider's are know throughout fallout to steal and murder it wouldn't be fallout without them. In any other game we would be called trolls and griefers but this is the wasteland. Toxicity is in the role just as Rose. So be careful and thanks for your shit
---
Workshops are the pvp aspect of this game. If you want to avoid pvp stay away from workshops and turn on pacifist mode in the settings so you don't engage it by hitting or shooting another player. 
---
If you absoulty want to do workshops then store your junk before taking it. That way you won't lose anything if someone comes along and kills you. If that happens don't seek revenge, hop worlds and try again.
---
I sold one for 2000 caps I literally had it in there as a joke
---
Hey shut up man ü§´
---
I am near whitesprings but that‚Äôs because I like the nice central fast travel point. Also I have only sold one item for more than 5,000 a two shot Tesla rifle with faster fire rate and reduced weight.
---
Yea I feel you and agree completely. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs a good idea, a really good one. You just shouldn‚Äôt be able to do it every single time you want to though or else you could have like every build in one character by just having multiple pcards and stacking and unstacking then as you please. See what I‚Äôm saying? Like you should atleast have to play through your decision for a bit once you make it
---
Ok, but what does wastelanders have to deal with a request for snow globes? And like, bethesda already promised wastelanders would be free, *surely* they arent *that fucking stupid.*
---
heh... buggy
---
Of course thank you so much :)
---
I'm not really sure why people waste the budget or power to set up a decontamination arch anyhow, Rad-Away is so incredibly common, I sell extras daily and still have more than enough to get rid of all my rads many times over.
---
Ty that'd be great but I'm on PS4 :)
---
Happy thanksgiving bud! Hope everything works out on your end, stay strong, the wasteland needs heavy hitting good folk like yourself!
---
silos are still broken too. there are several ways to skip to launch prep that havent been patched.
---
Damn! Hopefuly you'll find someone!
---
No that I know of, but I'll keep looking.
---
...I was wondering why my teammate is always after Quantums, makes sense now üôÉ
---
I would love that. But i hope that they stick a santa hat onto a scorchbeast or the queen.
---
Do you play on Xbox? If so just come play on my private sever. Take whatever workshop you want
---
Bethesda has been known to block your [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) account so that you can never use it again if you do a chargeback.
---
Admittedly that was for a refund charge back of the game itself but I wouldn't be surprised if your account was blocked for doing this for Fallout 1st.
---
You're not entitled to an account with Bethesda. It's not your property. It's Bethesda's. 
---
Whether or not your lose your account is yet to be seen. Just giving you fair warning just in case.
---
I found the mountain range, Im close
---
&gt; so scrips are actually more like a material.
---
So are caps. Basically a "universal material".
---
&gt; If they want to help with inflation, they should make caps sinks.
---
It does make a sink. Legendaries get either sold to the scrip machine for less than you paid, thus a currency sink, or they get sold to a vendor (Which has a cap limit per day), or sold on a player vendor with a 10% fee, which is a caps sink. Either which way, it is a sink to some degree.
---
Suppressor. I'd say if you heard the sound of the original (Fallout 1 and 2), it was probably the loudest fucking gun in the game lol
---
Hey add me on PC and pop by, usually have 30 weapons up for grabs and roughly half tend to be bloodied of some variant or another
---
Dude you should learn proper economics...
---
It is a videogame, it doesn't follow proper economics. Nothing about what I said is wrong.
---
Not lore friendly but on a more technical note, there's a reason why there aren't a lot of driving vehicle mods - engine can't really take it. It'd only be worse on a multiplayer server.
---
Gunt. I assumed.
---
I haven't logged in since my dad died earlier this year. I miss the game but I am afraid I won't enjoy it anymore.
---
Found one : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G_G5qKE/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
https://youtu.be/egplb5j0_oM
---
This video is my favorite example of what the fallout pvp meta is: stealth boy tesla spamming while chugging quantums and complaining about god mode glitches. pvp in this game needs a big fix
---
Well basics still applies, like what causes inflation, what makes a currency.
---
You are not saying things that's really wrong, jist sort of irrelevant to what I was saying.
---
What I was saying was the limitation to gaining scrip do not really help with reducing inflation, but caps sinks do.
---
Fucking hell. Yeah my teammate doesn't use his tesla in PVP, but I always wondered why he suddenly wanted quantums. I believe I just found out why, lovely üôÉ
---
Same reason it doesn't have any sights? Would be too useful...
---
When this game launched I was stuck at home with a broken shoulder and busted knee. With me playing on PC, using a mouse was out of the question. But the way they did vats, quick auto aim, allowed me to play with a controller. I suck with those dumb thumb sticks. 
---
Just pay the kindness forward. I give PA to new players when ever I get some and fix turrets at camps, I really hope the community stays this way.
---
Fuck Col. Gutsy... and then give me his gun.
---
If only you could swap the prefixes on them. Then you would have one god roll and one total piece of trash. As of right now they are both meh. 
---
Assassin is no good, explosive and reload are great. 
---
Bloodied is great, vats crit damage and agility is good on a rifle for a vats/sneak build but no good at all on a heavy weapon that you cant use in stealth.
---
Use the explosive one if you like running at 100% hp. Bloodied one if your cool with dipping below 80% hp
---
I play in spanish and I have to say Super Mutants pretty much die in an intense orgasm... kinda fun, considering they're sterile lol
---
You can continue to use resources from it but won't be able to add any more :)
---
Thanks üòä
---
If your on xbox I can mod it for you and show you where to farm lead. Would only charge you however many screws it costs me to mod
---
Start another ticket. Thats all you can do. 
---
And make sure to continue to be patient with them even tho they are infuriating at times. If in another few days nothing changes, try and message one of community mods on this sub
---
No problem :)
---
I‚Äôm sorry... sneak queefer? I can‚Äôt get passed it.
---
The way they patch one thing &amp; break another, or have old bugs resurface that were patched previously leads me to believe that Bethesda has turned the game over to a group of interns. I just can't believe that a group of experienced professional developers would have this much trouble making this game right.
---
Look at what Hello Games has done with No Mans Sky, a complete disaster at launch, a very small team. They made huge strides &amp; fixed their product &amp; gave their players everything that was asked for....and never charged a penny for any of the work done over 2 years. All the content has been free. Bethesda &amp; many other developers should follow their example. They (Hello Games) really are a class act!
---
Yeah that‚Äôs happened to me a couple of times during Campfire tales. It‚Äôs just a thing till they fix it.
---
Nah, not skins, proper weapons with some variance in stats.
---
I hav managed to collect 28000 5mm mainly because  I dont use it, come to my camp and buy 1000 and ill give you 1000, half price. Make sure I am home and get my attention, headset would be helpfull
---
Won't work. I tried.
---
What does a scrap box do?
---
True and the weight of both the launchers and the ammo needs to be lowered.....endgame weapons? Lol more like pump-everything-in-weight-weapons
---
That came about from a friend of mine. He knocked up a silenced gauss for another friend who is a sneak rifle build. He reckoned it sounded like a queef when he fired it and the name stuck. Much to the annoyance of the guy he made it for lol
---
IKR? Most of the time I"m either writing scripts or editing videos and audio and I'm like "wait.. wasn't I supposed to actually play the game at some point?" lol. "But oh wait, I've almost cataloged every trash can in The Whitespring.."
---
I currently have exploding lever-action if you'd rather have a two-shot I can try to find one
---
No pressure, I don't mind grinding for one
---
Boggles the mind sometimes especially in PA. Most especially with ghouls. Most ghouls come at you like Wolverine on crack. If they don't kill you outright well now you have rad/bone worms enjoy.
---
You can start equip the NW cosmetics on a new character and play with them at low levels. I don't get how people get this salty over NW.
---
Reminds me of Orlando Jones in Evolution, when he got sucked up into the creature at the end and came out saying ‚Äúyou cannot imagine what I‚Äôve seen in there‚Äù
---
Hate to say it but wait it out... I have made ticket, called, put in a complaint about Bethesda CS and nothing. My tickets got automated responses and after a while they closed them without responding.
---
The CS is the worst i ever had to deal with but i hope they will refund you shortly
---
Woosh
---
Thing is, if they make it an actual gun it becomes canon so they‚Äôll have to be careful on what they implement. If its just a skin, then they can go nuts.
---
I hooked mine to a pressure plate, and put it at the back.
---
The server can barely handle me running, you think it can handle a buggy?!
---
there were vehicles in Fallout tactics. A buggy was one of them. That's Chicago BoS though.
---
So that's why she gets so pissed off
---
it feels that way... it's the can before the storm. Let's see how you feel in February. If you want fornite stole seasons or final fantasy constant content.. this game is not for you.
---
Perfect description!!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt hold it against someone if I died because I showed up before their floor did. It‚Äôs the bastards who wait for you to climb up top to the vendors before quitting and dropping you to your death that frost my ass.
---
I know that the game has its faults, but we can try to make the best of it and try to fix those issues.
---
It is a sweet spot, for sure. I like to build off the edge of the cliff above the mine. 
---
And those prices seem fair to me. 
---
The most caps I‚Äôve ever had was about 4500, or so. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had 5k to spend!
---
Hm. I‚Äôd need to buy a PC! :-D
---
I‚Äôve got to assume they have...?
---
I like more how power armor somehow fits through tiny broken windows.
---
Wow. I‚Äôve never had more than 5k caps total!!
---
But I tend to build camps and just explore. I‚Äôm not a big achiever on quests...
---
This happens so much to me with ghouls, scorched and snallygasters! And despite it happening so much, its still super creepy and freaks me out lolol x)
---
Someone doing a caps glitch must have once and the dude was like "oh, imma just keep setting exorbitant prices"
---
When i set mine im always undercutting myself tryna be reasonable lmao
---
Doesn‚Äôt SBQ have massive explosive resistances anyways?
---
Me and my collection of IEs agree completely üòÇüëçüèº
---
Sounds reasonable. I‚Äôve never had more than 5k caps, so my 3-star legendary weapons are 1800-2000, because that seems like a lot to me, relative to the number of caps I have. 
---
I also have a ‚ÄúONE CAP‚Äù machine that I load up with stuff for just one cap each. Lots of supplies and chems, but also good ammo and stuff. I like it when someone gets something for a great price and sends me a heart or a thumbs up. Feels good...
---
I think I visited your camp. On Xbox? I remember being impressed someone went through all the work to give it the ‚ÄúWhitesprings touch‚Äù!
---
Can you store low-hanging fruit in it?
---
Have you tried posting in reddit to see if anyone would be willing to just give you the items you‚Äôre looking for?
---
I rebuild my camp almost every other time I log in. So I‚Äôm always having to re-price everything in 3 or 4 vendor machines. Sometimes I second guess my pricing and drop them in one camp, then raise the prices when I move again. 
---
Personally, I‚Äôd rather be out of stock, than have my stash completely full....
---
This has happened to me several times. The only way I‚Äôve found that reliably fixes it is to go to the atom shop and buy more atoms.
---
No, if you're addicted there is no upper limits. Until death ofc
---
What platform?
---
Every time a subscription dies an Angel gets their wings.
---
I'm trying to reach 10k atoms. Haven't bought anything yet and will hold off until I get my 10k. I'm around 8500 now so soon.
---
&gt;So DR that gets added by effects or perks can't be ignored by perks or other legendary effects right?
---
Where are you getting this from? If someone has 50% armor penetration, that 250 DR should still be effectively 125 DR. Do you have a link to something that says otherwise?
---
Otherwise, there are three things to note:
---
1) People can shoot 1 shot then just reload to gain 250 DR for a whole second or two. They don't need to unload to gain this bonus. This could be problematic, but...
---
2) Most people in PvP are running explosive energy weapons that are affected by ER, not DR. So that bonus does nothing. Also...
---
3) Repeated staggers via One Gun Army / Tank Killer will murder this "tank" by interrupting the reload, removing the 250 DR in the process, and then going to town as the heavy weapons guy tries to spin up and shoot or reload again. Chain CC is a big problem in PvP in every online game, typically awarding the player who shoots first, and in FO76 it's not that different.
---
So, no, the 250 DR won't be broken, even if armor penetration effects don't reduce it. Not until PvP is rebalanced, which I hope happens once Wastelanders is released.
---
["Due to contradictions with the story and setting of those games, the creators of Fallout 3\[13\] considered Fallout Tactics non-canon".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_Tactics:_Brotherhood_of_Steel)
---
Same. Im selling because i dont need it but maybe someone else does. The only thing i price high is ultra rare plans and Legendary guns and ive never gone above 2k
---
That‚Äôs badass. I can personally guarantee that once you start purchasing atoms with real money the bug you‚Äôre experiencing with joining a private server will go sway.
---
Probably won't be tonight but I'll pop by sometime soon
---
Decent base strength + full unyielding armor, herd mentality, talons, twisted muscles, run stranger in numbers, be on a team. Meat hook benefits from gladiator and iron fist perks, run em all to max. Buff with bobble heads, food, magazines, etc. Nukashine adds 100% unarmed damage on top. Ninja to rank 3 for 3x sneak damage, sneak and escape artist to stay in caution, sneak up on em. You‚Äôll do a ton of damage, it‚Äôs fairly easy to do with the right legendaries and planning.
---
You‚Äôve got a great legendary for it, you could definitely reach those heights.
---
Bloodied weapon, radicool and ninja perks, adrenal reaction and melee boost mutation, unyielding armor, nukashine buff and possibly a chem, don't remember what stacks. Also, both one-handed and unarmed perks cards work for the meat hook,  so it's the strongest
---
Not sure if I can take these comments seriously or not.
---
You are doing God's work, thank you
---
The [Mappalachia project](https://imgur.com/a/4Js8sCY) has maps for all the fluxes so you know where the best nuke spots are to gather them. Vendor bots don't sell fluxes, but I regularly see them at player vending machines.
---
Do not take me seriously. Ever.
---
I appreciate that
---
Can‚Äôt believe I forgot nerd rage, radicool, and adrenal reaction.
---
Make sure you use the Green Thumb perk card when your collecting.
---
Definitely second this post. I‚Äôm super into ancient MRE unboxing and every time I watch one I think of fallout/how suitable they‚Äôd be in game.
---
That maps what I‚Äôm looking for but unfortunately it‚Äôs too grainy for me to read. Got another link?
---
Why‚Äôs that?
---
You get two flux instead of 1 from each plant.
---
Of course it means nothing without the high radiation fluids and hardened mass
---
I wish I could make it for you :(
---
I have a lot of plans but not the X01 ones on my new main character.
---
I don‚Äôt use power armour except the excavator armour and having that disappear would be annoying enough, let alone the better ones
---
Although this situation would be more like Cheerios picturing on the pack both a strawberry flavored cereal, and one of chocolate, but the pack only contains the strawberry one. And the description would only say "pack contains a cereal"
---
It's true.
---
The only energy weapon I've ever used extensively in a Fallout game was the Turbo Plasma Rifle in 1 and 2. So yeah, Grounded is a must for me right now, although it looks like Wastelanders might change my mind on this...
---
You can gets lots of cobalt from nuking Morgantown (mutfruits) or the mire on the river (bloodleaf) and violet from the prime fissure (mutated ferns). 
---
Use Green Thumb to double yield. Most people don't sell stable flush from what I've seen, they're easy enough to scavenge if you have power armor or a hazmat suit. I'm suprised you say nobody even nukes, my servers always have nukes.
---
Oh something else I'll never be able to place in my CAMP because of the budget limits...how about instead of adding more plans...they give us more CAMP budget for fucking Christmas.
---
The only weapon skin I‚Äôve bought that affects one weapon is the blackbird hunting rifle one...because my weapon right now is a 3* bloody hunting rifle
---
These stories always seems to end with "Then the server crashes".
---
&gt; What I was saying was the limitation to gaining scrip do not really help with reducing inflation, but caps sinks do.
---
Yeah, indirectly, when people sell legendaries on their personal vendor, there is a 10% cap fee taken from every sale. That is a cap sink.
---
Wait, do you have the mod or the plans? If you have the mod, it makes it look like you need materials, but you don't. 
---
I've seen player vendors stocking stable flux, but it's not super common. IIRC they were usually in the range 120\~ caps each.
---
I have the plan
---
Hmmm.
---
Enemies are only over powered if they can see you.
---
As it is I can have a scorchbeast headbutt me and I‚Äôm still undetected.
---
The ghouls from the clubhouse run and stop in front of me and mill about wondering why their brethren keeping falling over.
---
So...bloodied unyielding stealth is over powered against everything except the SBQ...and even then she never sees me, she just doesn‚Äôt die easy.
---
Settlers. Fuck raiders.
---
Right? I bought the pack explicitly for the door and the smoke machine. They charge qhat? 500 atoms for the doors regular? Okay, part of a bundle, knock off some... I'd be happy with 300 back. That bundle, minus the door, isnt worth the 1200 i paid. Imho.... I KNOW there are other packages that do thissuch as the halloween bundle 1. Minus the witch wall decoration. I hunted for half an hpur thinking I HAD to have missed her. I refuesed to buy set 2 on principal. 
---
I'm a small business owner. I am ALL FOR Capatalism. HOWEVER! DON'T FUCK YOUR CUSTOMERS. You do and your business wont last lontlg, no matter what product you have. I dont give a shit if It's the cure for cancer. You charge a million dollars a dose amd you'll never get out of your mom's basement! Do them roght, gove them a qualith product and stand behind it FOR A FAIR PRICE and your client base will ever grow, your value will skyrocket and you'll never lose value. Be a douche by misrepresenting and not adressing grievous errors..... Well, I'm sure we all know how that works out.

Name checks out
---
Ive got 3 heavy lasers and 2 missle launchers. Every time I allog in or ft back to camp at least 1 of them is blowing holes in my ship!
---
Thanks everyone I'm certainly not dismissing the community and people are right fortnite is free but the passes and vbucks spent in game must equate to more than ¬£150 per year for some players.
---
I picked the game up for ¬£12 in cex so appreciate perhaps I didn't acknowledge the people that paid full back so my apologies there. What I wanted to do write was something positive personally I think if wastelanders comes out I hope the game sees more players and results in a positive game.
---
If any of you felt i dismissed your initial criticism that certainly wasnt the case I'd just like to draw some positives, my example of Fortnite and FIFA was that FIFA especially you can invest more of your money into a game that you've already paid ¬£49.99 for.
---
Thanks for the comments everyone ans safe travels in Appalchia üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç

Yessir, workseverytime. But annoying as shit on a doorknob if you ask me.
---
Those are the best images I am aware of. On Firefox, right-click -&gt; View Image will allow you to look at just a single picture, and Ctrl +/-  or Ctrl Scrollwheel then allows you to zoom in and out. Not sure how other browsers handle this.
---
Also, if you're on PC, there is a [mod at Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/313) that sets one of the Mappalachia maps as your in-game map. Might me overkill as a permanent solution, though...
---
Maybe he belongs to the superior Fallout 1st-community, stash issues are for peasants XD
---
The feel of the game is becoming less and less fallout and more, idk fortnight or something. The contrast between the happy 50s and the desolate wasteland was what made fallout well fallout, its what made you feel nostalgic for no reason.
---
Oh, youre not alone over there on the Xbox my friend. Same garbage happening on the PS4 as well. Just saw a nocturnal leather arm, + int, poison rest for 12,600 caps. It was a LEVEL 20 PEICE!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ They had ALL theor mags listed for 1k+. Addictol was 500 caps. Where TF does the insanity end?!?!
---
I wish they would honestly just set PC and whatever play on the same public servers.
---
Ah, I see. I like that description.
---
you should come closer...

scraps and holds infinite amount of junk.
---
So junk weight won‚Äôt be a problem ever? I can just stack up on it forever ?
---
I love players like you. You help make a 15-20 min battle last five. God bless you!!! You rock! I'm running the bloody unyeilding with a twost amd the wife is running heavy gunner support. She and I have 2 manned that.beast in just under 7 min. With a group that knew the ropes, we finished her off in 3. One wastelander in particular was blasting her ass with cryo while I pummeled her hemorrhoids. Took us less than 3 min from touchdown to death. So, if you're on PS4 and that was you, I salute you!!! If not, well, keep up the good work.
---
I still do. Did it just a couple of days ago with a bunch of randoms.
---
Thankfully they only suggested 1.8k
---
I‚Äôve become ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù and plonked mine down beside the storage shed on the golf course.
---
4 industrial water purifiers (unlocked) operating in the stream and an adhesive farm out back.
---
I have a wide array of wares to sell as well though and my house is wide open.
---
I have turrets but people have to actively run to my base with the ghouls in pursuit for them to take kills.
---
I like my spot but it tends to be inside the nuke zone for whitesprings...but I‚Äôve only seen one nuke on n whitesprings since I started playing again a month ago.
---
I just do all three if noone else will.
---
As long as you have a subscription, and excluding the technical limit you will never reach in 5000 lifetimes, but yes, infinite junk storage that doesn't count towards stash limit.
---
They lost the war but they did win the fashion show.  I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs not the trade off the NAZI‚Äôs we‚Äôre looking for though.
---
They already confirmed they will not remove these things from the game
---
Yeah the only atom shop item I have bought is the armoured raider gas mask as it was the closest thing in game to the classic G.I helmet
---
This thread.... Dammit... You fuckers make me proud. Now, wtf can we do about getting a salute transitioning into either a bird or humping emote? I need to salute/hump the SBQ EVERY DAMN TIME I KILL HER STUPID ASS!  Shit. Sorry. Carried away. Still wanna see the emote happen though...
---
&gt; Their return implies the scorchbeasts reign would be over
---
Not necessarily. We, the players finished a cure for the plague, not a way to wipe out the scorched all together. So they could easily still be overlapping.
---
Well if we're going there the bullets should also be crafted into armor piercing like in vegas, not the magazines lol. Anybody that knows anything about guns and bullets knows that makes no sense...
---
Could be like making ultracite ammo ammo at a higher cost, but more could be used with drum magazines.  Which btw handmade rifle drum magazine is useless now they can just take it out completely.
---
Whoever opens a working Slocum's Joe gets my vote. All I want is a coffee and a donut, doesn't seem like much for a man to ask for.
---
Nothing wrong with that. I use all five characters.  Now, if they were mules....
---
THANK YOU for explaining! I've been wondering why my WR  Gatling laser suddenly weighs 12 pounds!
---
I was just wondering since the effects and perks state that it ignores your opponents armor that it would only halve  the DR of armor and not the DR of the effect, I play alone since my buddies don‚Äôt have PCs so I have no way of testing and was wondering if someone had tried it, and handmades are still pretty popular weapons alongside other ballistic weapons like fixers and such, it‚Äôs still better than nothing imo
---
I usually just try to find another way around, jump through a window, or power armor glitch myself through a wall if I‚Äôm really interested in seeing what they‚Äôre selling. But most of the time I‚Äôll just walk through it anyway if I can‚Äôt find another way in, it‚Äôs not too difficult to drink some toxic goo and get my rads back ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
To break down ore you can smelt it with acid at a chem station, this will turn it into lead scrap.
---
From a lore perspective people probably wouldn't wanna live in a region that got nuked every other day, whether people are nuking scorchbeasts or for flux
---
From a gameplay perspective though? Doubt bethesda would ever remove such a big feature just for the sake of lore. Ultimately gameplay matters a lot more than realism anyways
---
Griefing the griefers. Fair.
---
Assualt rifle is the worst auto rifle, however, you still got it way under price and it can still be a great weapon with a low health, sneak build
---
Oh cool, my build was centered entirely around shotgun and melee... Another reason not to return to the game
---
Hell yeah dude I have one a bit south of the golf course like that except I used a cooking station for it
---
Request desktop site on imgur and itll come in beautifully
---
Can we get an M60 skin for the MG32 too? I hate that the only realistic LMG option for the heavy guns is Axis. I know it's more of a Vietnam thing, but the M60 was [already in the series](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/M60_(Fallout_2)), and this is America dammit.
---
Troubleshooter armour and Vampire Miniguns IIRC
---
It is a positive development - I mean it's got to happen now. Can't be put on the back burner again.
---
Intended or not, does the "community hunt" actually add anything to the game though? The in game experience is basically just alt tabbing and googling the codes, that's not really a very thrilling community hunt imo. Especially since they just reset every week so you end up doing the same thing all over again
---
I just think there are far more engaging ways they could have gone about it
---
Yes! It should‚Äôve happened a long time ago, but they‚Äôve addressed it as one of the big bugs there going for and I‚Äôm just happy it‚Äôs finally happening!
---
Never heard about it on that side of the rhin
---
and glowing mass.
---
Xbox?  I'll have to check, but I think I've got one and I'm not one for costumes.
---
At least you have fun not like dude I play with that logs off while I'm crafting or whatever, floor disappears I fall to my death just so he gets a laugh.
---
If there are a couple of high levels you are golden, just tag each enemy and the high levels will cut them down quickly at no real danger to you.
---
The average IQ is declining, this probably warrants a downvote :P
---
At least it‚Äôs easy to find the mods! And BE is always fun
---
Honestly, I couldn't tell ya. I've never jerked woth the cryolator build so I know absolutely squat about it. I'd think it'd have to do with the perks you have selected. For instance, I do heavy damage, but if I forget to re-equip serendipity after swappint it out for, say super duper, I die 30 times while fighting lvl30 scorched. But with it equipet, I can take on a horde of lvl 60+ muties with zero probs. Might check on available perks and see what you have that might help. Otherwise, Mr. Freeze above (below) moght be aboe to help out!! Good luck out there!!!

MREs are canon:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/MRE
---
I‚Äôm on ps4
---
I don't remember diseases being this common 6 months ago, I just popping antibiotics like they are candy.
---
I like to sell plans at 1 cap, No one has bought out my entire stock yet, people just seam to buy the ones they are missing.
---
Early February ... i guess he was stacking bobble heads, but holy shit thats a lot of xp!
---
A certain CD Key site has the game for 8 GBP right now ($10).
---
next is bloody
---
as in.. incoming nerf
---
About 15k on a junkies explosive Gatling. These days all
---
My toons are close to maxed out so I don‚Äôt put valuable stuff in my vendors, or I sell it cheap.
---
25k caps on the Shielded lining raider underarmor plan.
---
yes. activated all several times and once all in one session. nothing.
---
crafting plasmagrenades for chemist seems more attainable by comparison ;)
---
Honestly if they have a lick of sense they‚Äôll nerf bloodied by giving enemies radium rifles and gamma guns. Remember how badly Children of Atom would ruin your day in Fallout 4 with their damn game guns even if you were full health? Imagine that on a bloodied build. Then it would be a true glass canon- big damage but fragile as.
---
Oh absolutely. Much better than the level 35 bloodied 1* handmade I used until I could buy a BE 25%. People think that they need a god roll weapon and armour and they under value the perk cards.
---
My 1* bloodied lever action does 1.8k damage per hit when I get a sneak headshot, and if i actually perked my dude out fully, used some chems and got revived recently, that number would jump to over 4k per hit...with a one star!
---
I'm rambling on but the point is, while the assualt rifle isn't as good as the combat rifle&lt;handmade&lt;fixer, it will still shred if used properly
---
Raiders, but I am seriously debating giving up the raiding life because of all the thrall/ slag I'll be grouped with. Im sick of everyone calling themselves a raider and showing up in nurse outfit or novelty hipster gear with an oversized mask. Fashion wise 95% of the people who can themselves raiders are out. 50% of them are all based on the same Youtube. The rest are alright and serious about the life+ rock proper colors.
---
known bug for some time unfortunately...
---
Yup. One of my toon‚Äôs main weapons is a one star bloodied handmade lvl 35, and even that shreds. I‚Äôd love to upgrade but I‚Äôve only gotten two bloody handmades in 9 months of playing, both level 35.
---
Agreed. I just did meltdown raid with my girl and got 400 acid each, each raid. Only did up to the part where you open the engineering room and I just killed the bugs until they stopped spawning. We ran it twice and now I have 1700 acid.
---
Still need gunpowder and I refuse to use acid to craft it, so I'll be doing a few runs of wes tek for gunpowder and steel.
---
Lead is definitely the second easiest resource to get right behind steel imo
---
air is sold in Saudi Arabia. Trump is President of the United States, and Attack on Titan 2 still hasn't dropped price in the ps4 store.
---
They were present in New Vegas weren‚Äôt they ?
---
wow, that's one of the rarest plans right now
---
. I got 25k plus a weapon
---
I had an executioners limb damage vats cost handmade(it still has 85 bullets in it since I havent used it since the drum nerf) then i *upgraded* to a 1* lvl 35 bloodied. Thing is an absolute beast. The BE max level version only does like 20 or 30% more damage I think
---
It sold in record time too.
---
It is in a small section on the **north** side of your build area. Maybe 20 degrees on either side of true north.
---
I've noticed where you get a few spawn points in that range or you get one spawn point with only a foot of variance.
---
&gt;Anybody that knows anything about guns and bullets knows that makes no sense...
---
What? Everyone knows that incendiary weapons are powered by the magazine having lighter fluid! Tracer bullets have glow stick liquid in the magazine. Armour piercing rounds are no exception to this. Aaandd just like in real life, a huge drum magazine holds less than a banana clip!
---
It‚Äôs what assholes call normal people. You can ignore them.
---
It is moderately good. The explosive has no practical effect on the SBQ and most scorched enemies aren't that though to warrant such gun. Zealot's + 25% Faster Firerate would be more apt. I tried to sell such ZE weapons for 1k but nobody is buying Zealot's because AA and Furious are all the full-health rage.
---
the insult note that many people sell at their vendor for hundreds or thousands o caps?
---
you might be doin them a favor ;)
---
i'd leave some rockets if i wouldnt drop them on sight so usually i just drop some freedom for watoga, empty holotape or the odd mole-miner gaubtlet or ivory grip.
---
Gattling Laser Builds also thank you, since we deal way more damage when she has landed
---
Ignoring all of the extremely cringey and unnecessary parts of this comment, the OP was not referring to the more futuristic combat helmet. There is another helmet simply called the army helmet that is the classic turtle shell design.
---
This.
---
My friend was talking about how he owns everybody in pvp and when i actualy saw him i was laughing becouse only thing everyone did was stealth boy tesla spam and jumping on the same place. When he killed one he was flaming him and telling him how unskilled he is etc. This games pvp is joke
---
Holy crap. In another thread we were discussing cap sinks and the caps limit.... Dude, what about adding an item to the atomic shop that we can use as lik a vendor station and set prices to travel from our camp to like say, 10 other points on the map? I'm based north of Whitesprings amd it costs me something like 30 caps to travel to Watoga station. What if, with the player caravan, we can set our price at say 25 caps? Incentive to visit player camps before traveling to another area, cap sinks for us (kind of, if they add plans in game that we can purchase via caps to upgrade speed or comfort ime player thirst and hunger) this would be a huge boon to the game. With some spit and polish this could be amazing!
---
Is there a way to get around it or fix it, so I can get my badge
---
Havent had any issues with this for about a month now
---
I heard it quite a few times as Ian shot me in the back with it.
---
No, it have to be fix by bethesda. You can earn badges other ways, easiest are 2 daily quests and occasional public event Campfire tales.
---
You must be new....there is bugs thats been since launch....but yeah lets add vehicles....would work really smoothly
---
If ur on now i can mod it im on ps4, auto use ammo like crazy best to get a quad tesla anywho im on now for a bit
---
Damn
---
there are some high lvl players that use playervendors as "money sinks" i guess some  ppl cater to them or maybe i just try to rationalize idiocracy :)
---
Still feel the same...awesome game idea and so on. But very shitty executed
---
I got the game at launch, a main consideration for me was, they said all updates will be free only pay for cosmetics. Feels bad man.
---
I think it would've been better if they made the game as a fallout 4 DLC, oh you don't have F4? you can buy it as a stand alone game as well.
---
The wife and I are on PS4 and tonight, we experience the first weird shit with 1st. We were vender farming and I'd log off, social, her, join. This is where it gets weird. She'd log off, right? Social, me... Kick, block or mute. Wtf? Ummm, okay? Play, private. Logs her back into the same server I'm on. It showed me as visiting private although it did not do that last week? Both of us are 1st members so in theory the server should transfer to whoever is left... Nope. It is now treating us as though we are NOT 1ST members. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I get the complexities of coding. Especially on a game this size. But holy shit, Bethesda! Come on!
---
Check your internet connection, l haven't had an issue in an event in months on xbox
---
This just happened to me ended up closing it all down and restart my ps4 and went away, really hope it doesn't happen again...
---
I'm afraid I'd be pissing people off should I purchase the turkey outfit.... I'd have to initiate pvp with EVERYONE whether or not I get my ass kicked, put my mic on area and yell "gobble gobble mother fukker!! How you like me now?!" 
---
I'm officially drunk. No more whisky for me. Night night.
---
I'm game!I would surely farm that!
---
Build a bunch and scrap them eventually u will learn all the mods, waste of resources, i think watoga sells it or have someone mod it for u, look for someone with high karma, if ur a good person join PKOA they will give u all kids of help, u can search them on here
---
Same here. I have a couple disconnects a week that's it, maybe different servers in Canada?
---
\*visible disgust\*
---
i had 3 diseased little naggers snack at me for 20minutes with radaway et al it just wouldnt whoopsie me. 
---
hoppala
---
Over inflated prices at Whitespring Station camps are pretty much standard on PC too. 
---
Does anyone ever get any business there or do their overpriced two star Hunters rifles just sit there for months on end?
---
I sell all common plans for 11 caps and end up with half a dozen plans for Ultracite Helmets and end up dropping them, I don‚Äôt know how they can get any sales when they are selling them for 500 caps or more.
---
Yeah old bug. Luckly it's avoidable. Hope they fix again soon.
---
I dont think we need it but still; a universe where flying helicopter type vehicles exist, vast robots, cars, etc
---
Yet a post apolocyptic dune buggy would break loreüëå
---
If it was skyrim it would end with "Ended up in blackreach"
---
I've never seen a single guy using fat man or missile launcher as a weapon!
---
You did mention whitespring, have you noticed the handterminal that is not connected to anything? Also all the various big rooms just sealed off?
---
same for me spawnpoint almost true north everytime.
---
moving camp-thingy in established camp does nothing to change spawnpoint for me.
---
player spawnpoint is always the same as mine. 
---
is there any consitlstency? :)
---
*Or* turn the toilet paper into a consumable item. Same taste.
---
He kills everything before the first circle closes and leaves 2 players... His alt or his friend. Then falls thru the map and dies a glorious 3rd place.
---
New Vegas is not cannon...it's a spin off
---
It soon fills up, even without junk. I'm not even sure how mine got right back up to max
---
You are absolutely correct. Seems we are in the majority, on here anyway. But in game, I've only had 3 pvp encounters since launch and survival is dead because nobody played it. The in game community is super nice, this sub is super salty.
---
M3 exists too.
---
Cause ?
---
Would make more sense to give enclave uniforms which have similarities with Nazi uniforms.
---
The "classic turtle shell design" in the game is a lot closer to todays army helmet -- it looks a lot more like a WW2 German helmet than the helmet the US were using in WW2 and Vietnam.
---
.50 Cal is under. Should be an Endgame weapon for boss killing.
---
When you're outnumbered and don't have the initiative,you're toast.  Yes someone will rush here replying he can clint eastwood through 4 enemies with a bat, but we know he's just bragging.
---
Also most people that try to engage in pvp   are geared for that. Just yesterday 3 dudes kicked my lvl 400 ass while i was helping a friend build his camp and i could't really tell them to wait till i get my pvp gear.we fought,i killed one,they turned me to goo lol.  All fun,changed server, and was back nailing that roof in my friend's camp.
---
I wouldn't hate it if we had a BOS sub-faction. Like if a group of settlers find fort defiance and like the BOS way of doing things, then decide to pick up where they left off.
---
It wouldn't be the true BOS, it would be a shadow of what they truly are. But it would be interesting and would honestly make a whole lot of sense.
---

Well, given that the M60 is just the bastard child of all the bad bits of the FG42 merged with all the bad bits of the MG42...

Why not.

(The FO2 in-game description is pretty much bullshit though...)

You just remained me of when Todd said something in the line of, the servers wont have a lot of players, its a post apocalyptic wasteland not a "theme park".

Savage eheh

Mercnos.. Man that guy is soooo good. I got wiped 3 times while in a bush on the first circle.

Man my whole team got wiped on 3 points on power plant before the could get ready.

That just means that you're not part of the community doing the hunt.

The fuck are you smoking? Of course NV is canon...
---
I wouldlove a proper Enclave faction toside with + all the nice decorations/flags the Enclave has... Some day perhaps...
---
I sell loads at 100 caps each and I  see vendors everywhere selling it. What platform are you on?
---
Only times I have issues at SBQ, is when there's a mouthbreather with strangler PA causing freezes for everyone around.
---
When I started the game back on launch, I started with melee and never stopped. I remember getting my first Grognak Axe, how happy I was! I remember killing waves of players in the first week as they did not realize the power of my fire axe with the right perks! :)
---
I remember all my friends leaving the game in annoyance of the ammo leaving them over-encumbered constantly. And, of course, I remember fighting the Queen for the first time-- slashing and hacking at that things underside, mashing R2, hand vibrating madly! 
---
I also recall not being able to destroy a single turret in that power plant in the control room because its too high :(
---
I quit the game back once Fallout 1st dropped. Thank you for posting this and making me remember the good times of my over 100 level character ^-^
---
I'm a rifle build but don't do much damage so I usually freeze her with a cryolator. I have tried a two shot cryolator but it does practically nothing compared to my furious one.
---
It's such an iconic fallout eeapon, it's a shame.
---
I really like what thry did with the BFG in DOOM. Maybe something like that can work for this game. Max 3 ammo, super rare, weightless, guaranteed destruction. Has it's own hotkey like grenades.
---
I'm the same lol avoid pvp like the plague. But other night after 1 violent night 1 or 2 dudes decided to keep shooting me so I pretended to just keep looting the ghouls for  a minute, whipped out old favorite FE stinging handmade and killed both in 2 seconds. Then all hell broke loose. 
---
Seemed they were 2 teams of 4 all together and my usual team wasn't online yet i was alone lol so I ran into the woods, jumped in stealthboy T-60 and waited... long story but another half hour of fun and embarrassing for them. 
---
Why do certain players feel the need to annoy others for no reason? I mind my own business but if I'm minding my own business and get screwed with repeatedly I'm going to annoy them a lot more üòÇ
---
You learn it from scrapping Tesla rifles. You can buy the base plan to craft them from vendor bot Phoenix at the Watoga Shopping Plaza if you are level 40+.
---
If you want easier violet nuke Grafton, with Grafton Station just outside SW of circle and just short of shooting club in the East you can get far more violet far easier..
---
I'll be siding with settlers, cause raiders suck, I like killing raiders plus I get all fuzzy inside when I help out good people. I just hope the people I play with go settlers too cause I'd really hate to have to kill them too
---
There's an incredibly lame Pimp My Ride joke in here somewhere, just waiting to be told.
---
Niether are 99.99% of the actual community
---
We have been doing 3 Queen runs a day for awhile now with that o issues yet. We play on PS4.  Would definitely check your connection
---
This haopens when you use the shortcut and miss out a chunk of the silo, i always hear some crazy stuff happening where i think the sentrybot trying to kill me from the floor below
---
I remember them doing something but it was like 6 months ago.
---
I‚Äôm currently a sneaky shotgunner but would step over if this was a sneaky option. Like the look a lot more.
---
Ps4
---
I really should have rephrased what I said. I‚Äôm mostly referring to the glitch that happens when you die near the end of an event and can‚Äôt respawn. It prompts you to press X to do so, but nothing happens.
---
But I guess you‚Äôre right, the crashes might be me connection! It makes all too much sense since I play multiple other online games and they never crash.
---
I can‚Äôt imagine it possibly being my connection when literally every single other online game that I play runs smoothly without crashing.
---
Thx missed that one cool about red wt inert flux as that is what I usually use excess for which is why don't sell often.. üòâ
---
So here's the fast travel rules as best as I can tell:
---
The owner of the CAMP spawns at a location  which is a function of the location of the actual CAMP item within the build radius + some offset, of which the offset is defined partly by the vector with which they fast travelled from. Exactly how these interact is not clear, but very broadly speaking you can control your arrival point by moving the CAMP unit around.
---
For ALL other players: they arrive almost solidly exactly in the centre of your build zone, which is where you first placed the unit when you set up the CAMP. Again there appears to be an offset to this defined by the vector to where they came from, but the effect of this is much smaller and often makes little difference to the arrival point.
---
In both cases, the rotational orientation of the CAMP (either currently, or when initially placed) may also affect the orientation of the player on arrival, but I haven't tested in depth enough.
---
Can you even do the minimum damage to get credit for the kill (I've heard ~1000 damage) as melee only? I remember folks used to run around with unarmed weapons in hazmat suits, but I haven't seen any in forever.
---
I agree it was a long shot. And I doubted that as well but figured it never hurts to check. Maybe do a speed test &amp; just reconnect it. Do you play with friends &amp; are you the only one experiencing problem?
---
iguana bits is people! it's made from people!!!
---
I don‚Äôt know how you people play in 3rd person lol. Anyway nicely done
---
Are you gatekeeping Christmas???
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
It def seems like you have enough data and looks like it starts off exponential but levels out. If you add right click, add a trend line and show formula you should be able to see xp/rank. 
---
Y=mx +b where m is rank/level. 
---
Not perfect and assumes numbers don‚Äôt level off, but better than the black box we currently have.
---
Not at all, just confused why heads want Fallout to be like an episode of Mickey Mouse? I get the impression most people on the sub never played the other games in the series...
---
Oh this won't go down good with PETA...no sir üòÇ
---
I didn't make the lore. Also bows aren't a thing in the game either.
---
Ok. I‚Äôll add you sometime today
---
remember when you change the wall paper often items attached to the wall disappear
---
i said the whole game is a spin off.SO whatever the story of the game is,it's not on the whole fallout timeline plus the items/factions/characters of the game don't actually exist.Meaning the NCR in the mojave doesn't exist.Ceasar's legion is not in the Fallout universe!MRE's are not an item that is normally used!
---
I'm not saying that i would mind if they added MRE's,but i don't see it happening
---
Although steps are taken to make MRE's more tasty, the military doesn't care about taste. They care about nutrition and cost.
---
Lmao way to kickell
---
Yep fireproof in endurance
---
What do you mean hardly anyone launches nukes? I have one go every session. 
---
Why don‚Äôt you want to launch one?
---
yes... rank 3 and their sonic blast does pretty much no damage.
---
&gt; Sure, but there's not really much of a community to be a part of.
---
Where do you think the code comes from.  There is a community of people who compete/cooperate to work out the code.
---
Also zealots helps out a lot even if it‚Äôs just 1 piece :)
---
It does... if you equip a backpack underneath
---
To much work
---
I need help too, if anyone reads this I'm on Xbox, will be online in about an hour.
---
20 minutes?
---
lol "moonlightcowboy starring in" "kill count" and then proceeds to spam kill lvl 30's as a lvl 300+ with a bloodied build.
---
&gt; I am impervious to enemies though for everything else underground
---
Really?  What about underground enemies?  Maybe one day you'll be visited by the SBQ herself, she's been known to go tunneling...
---
This, i haven't played in about 2 months or so, and came back the other day, thought they had nerfed the shit out of stuff like gunsmith and whiteknight, i never had repaired gear degrade so fast in the whole lifespan of the game, like now. Is it actually intended or a bug?
---
Great view
---
UK ration packs had these things called "biscuits brown", rumour has it they were formulated to stop you from crapping. Imagine mixing cardboard and cement powder.
---
The scorchbeast weirdly reminds me of the dragons in Skyrim
---
Use blocker in strength aswell to protect from the mobs.
---
I actually agree mate, with all the old school christmas music it'd be easy to pull off. I just think there's better ways of doing it than deathclaws dressed as santa lol
---
It was less about my level, and more about killing players trolling newbies.
---
Always giving her a Powerfist colonostopy!
---
I wouldn't complain that much, they're giving us free scrip! But yeah I wish they were a little more fun and also relevant to the story!
---
It's like they don't want to make money from the atom shop.
---
I've never heard someone calling the space under the terrain "the upside down" ü§î
---
I'm on Xbox. GT MagnumForce357. I finished all the Enclave quests, so after doing a little research I can supposedly get the armour plans at the Enclave Bunker. Going to check that out. The mods are going to be the real issue. I don't have the flux to make them &amp; they are pricey to buy when you can find them. I had calibrated legs, motion assist, recon, &amp; optimized brackets, quantum paint. It was a really nice set, the best I had.
---
I like to sell useless legendaries for 15c per scrip so for a three star weapon I don‚Äôt need, I would sell for 600 caps.
---
Edit: kick ass and take names lol I butt posted I guess
---
Change to a power fist or deathclaw gauntlet, you will see huge chunks melt off!
---
1000? Unarmed weapons regularly do 4k and up, you take huge chunks off her health bar!
---
Keep looking, never launched a nuke myself and hardly ever go in the zones....but I‚Äôve got about 50 or so of each flux stashed. I find them on vendors all the time, player vendors. The important part is the price. Just last night I found 6 cobalt and 2 violet for 50caps a piece. They weren‚Äôt there long
---
I did that a couple of times in the early days before they nerfed strange in numbers! Bird bones let you fall so slowly you could wail on her up there!
---
I always find it a little funny when these bloodied builds die. Like 1 hit from a ghoul and they‚Äôre dead.
---
Refractor, dodgey,  and serindipity
---
Fireproof a must have perk and God mode VS SB.
---
I would check which platform is used by most of your friends
---
the fact that you start the video off by some, boxer entering the ring shout, heavy techno music, kill count and spamkilling each player more than 10 times each, seems to contradict that statement
---
So you miss the days of producing  tons of alcohold, completing events while intoxicated and taking picture naked at radzone, while punching the SBQ with a chair ?
---
In Short they will ban your account if you use your bank to get a refund.
---
It will be in their terms of service you agreed to when you created the account. This is a standard term of service for online games.
---
I would take that in a heartbear if I am on guard duty and diarrhea strikes. And I am pretty sure the taste is the same as the medication used.
---
I always set my rad arch up to a floor based pressure plate, now nobody leaves it on all the time lagging out the server with particle effects! Except when server lag thinks somebody is still on the pressure plate...
---
Queens for ultracite plans, bunker for x-01. But agree completely you said you've been playing since summer at least why haven't you done the main quests??
---
Double edged argument. Do you want them harder and potentially get less atoms?  Or do you want them ultra boring and get them all everyday?
---
It's not a problem for me i did them all every day since january.
---
Star trek and fortnite do Krampus well.
---
And good luck finding those pesky high-radiation fluids! I feel like they're dropping even less that before. Hope you get what you need. I too am currently feeling the struggle.
---
You get double the amount when you harvest it. You need I think 10 to make 1 stable flux.
---
dude_mccue on PC! Ill be on again tomorrow night
---
BETHESDA ! LISTEN TO THIS ! MAKE IT SO PLEEEEEASE !
---
Thank you for the feedback! It's greatly appreciated, and through feedback, I can improve my videos!
---
Upnuked for the fun you provided.
---
I got switch connected to it and near it i got 5 radiation emmiters with switch so you can get rads back up =) those are in the section with bloodied weapons and unyielding armor. The shower is in section with vanguards and instigating weapons.
---
there was 2 that could be opened and 3 more that had the animated door (it looks slightly different as it has a small gap in the seam) but couldn't be opened 
---
my group has a R&amp;D division we call Rust Tec and we comb over stuff like this to see if they possibly will be expanding it - also looking for no build sites in the middle of no where since means they have plans for that area and checking it after larger patches to see if anything more was added
---
I solo with a vamp explosive lmg
---
Because rap,trapadabap ratatatata
---
Nice. I liked it.
---
Got mine on one character 3 months ago. Someone else was powering the plant and I was just passing through, best happy little coincidence that happened to me in FO76.
---
I'm extremely sure that you are wrong.
---
I'm not a proper raider,not with my super cozy house, but i shoot people off the cliff and eat what's left. Probably a gourmand.
---
It is? Iguana throw up...
---
Bad thing was we were launching a nuke. At the end I wanted to switch characters and couldn't rejoin.
---
................. I don't know if I wanna tell her bout this. I'm supposed to be the badass... Lmao. Shes using the explosive furious gatling gun right now. Ive got a 2 shot ultracite gatling laser in my vend machine... Might see how that works for her.
---
I‚Äôd suggest PS4 just because of NW but if you plan on playing just ADV I suppose PC would be nice.
---
Oh, so it's not just my heavy turret that's mad...it keeps making holes in my garage door lol
---
The red rocket in Morgantown is a build area. It's not that big but it's something.
---
I'll check it out, don't recall having tried there. Thanks
---
I lost it at the random lag/stuck in terrain.  Lol, Bethesda
---
So much better than a turkey outfit.
---
That sort of baffles me still.  
---
"So what do I usually use this big huge LITERAL NUKE I'm carrying around for?"  
---
"endgame bosses, annoying raiders, cowboys named Preston, that one ghoul that gooses you as you come around the corner..you know, the usual."  
---
"So... the Scorchbeast Queen. Got it."  
---
"nah brah. Her DR for that is like.. 300?"  
---
". . ."
---
Correct. I was talking about the army (can be dirty) helmet. You find it everywhere.
---
So as an explosive build.. what do you recommend? I was thinking about an explosive PA build, but if it's not all that awe-inspiring, I might pass.
---
Every single build gets better with adrenal, nerd rage, unyielding, and low health...hell even crafting builds get better 
---
Melee obviously gets the most out of it but all that extra perception and AP points mean your VATsing like a terminator even with your ranged weapons and Gunfu and its ridiculous no matter what your weapons prefix
---
If you nerf the bloodied weapons then people will just bitch about low health Junkies or AA
---
Nice one dude! Added
---
Someone's going to make a video series, I can feel it :  
---
"Can I complete MQ and get to the SBQ using ONLY missiles?" the 935 part series.

---
Something I liked about FO4 was the pre-built buildings. Did I use them? No, but they would be great for those who just want quick buildings to put down, especially for those always on the move
---
I dont even need to google that to know it's from wikipedia, it's written just like it. So problem 1 is you thinking that wikipedia is actually an official source for anything.  
---
Secondly is you apparently not understanding what spinoff means. It has nothing to do with the authenticity/canon-ness of a product. All it means is that it's a story based in a preexisting established universe that is not a direct sequel to any existing works. So yea, New Vegas is a spin off because it is not a direct sequel to FO3 or any other FO games, but it's still set in the canon FO universe and is a canon game.  
---
Sucks for you, finish high school before arguing with adults.
---
Because I'm cheap, and Bloodied means I shoot less ammo.
---
Even though I explained it above, just wanted to remind you that you have no idea what spin off means.
---
Almost a must for a bloodied build, all those pesky short critters in the grass nipping at your heels.
---
I didn't do the challenges that require thir party involvment. But I am in a mutual suicidal/revival relationship with a fellow vault dweller, so this may change.

I am leaning that way as well, but hard to say until we get more details on the advantages of the factions.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say they gave up on rifles as the Fixer &amp; Handmade are really the most sought after weapons but yes they gave up on laser rifles I think honestly they don‚Äôt wanna buff their damage or anything because explosive laser‚Äôs already have a damage bug (they do waaaay more than they should) &amp; if they buff the damage explosive laser rifles will rule the game, endgame, raids, everything lol. Unless they keep the condition the same no one would use them still cause they break after one mag (explosive laser‚Äôs)
---
I think it‚Äôs more to doo with the fact that it is the buggiest and laggiest event I have seen.
---
If you have him for that it would have been extra easy to do the photo ones,which are way funnier than craftin those three damn heal every single day.
---
Yes.
---
Paddle Ball
---
Don't think I've ever managed to get more than 2c per myself. 
---
But, I was pretty much ignoring flux for the first few months.
---
Have you heard of our lord and savior steve1989 on youtube? If not, go, go now. Just go
---
I believe you want to score a critical w/ the cryolator, that seems to be the hard freeze. Just putting a few puffs on her does slow  her down a bit.
---
I very much wish this was true, that would be an awesome end game weapon.
---
They absolutely care about taste as it helps to improve morale, especially among volunteer militaries. The US army wouldn‚Äôt of spent 20 years developing combat-ready pepperoni pizza otherwise.
---
Iguanas?
---
This turkey leg sure is tasty.
---
Serendipity, dodgey, and fireproof. At that point you could withstand sonic blast for quite awhile.
---
It's not really awe-inspiring. I run with grenades and a noobtube, and an explosive shotgun.  You need a second gun for up close or you die by your own hand.
---
Omg you are right! Then there is no reason for them not doing so other that i guess resources but yet again, there is already a plenty of mods already on fallout 4 they could port over with permission.
---
Than would be so cool... i want me some more snipers!
---
&gt; when Bethesda repurposed their hardware for F1rst-ing.
---
How many times does it have to be said?
---
Bethesda *don't have any hardware*.  The game runs on AWS (Amazon) virtual servers.  Servers are dynamically created to handle the user load.
---
They didn't get rid of survival mode because of fallout 1st, they got rid of it because they haven't worked out how it's going to fit into *Wastelanders*.
---
Lol not that anyone doubted but the fail started early and fully formed I see with the Atom Shop
---
Let‚Äôs hope after seeing the F1st ones there‚Äôll be more effort put in this year
---
If you go to captainoobs YouTube, he has a series where he tests out basically every weapon in the game with every prefix in the game and does pretty in depth guides on how to maximize damage on each one
---
Awesome :)
---
Thats what blueprints are for.
---
On top of Seneca Rocks
---
ill keep on trying, i usually shoot her with a dangerol syringer as well. not sure if it does anything but one can hope :)
---
A spin-off by nature, exists in the same universe of that which it‚Äôs spun off from. Think of any tv series that has a spinoff. They‚Äôre always in the same universe. The Walking Dead and now two spinoffs. Agents of Shield is a spin-off of the Marvel movies. The Jeffersons is a spin-off of All in the Family. Just think about it.
---
They seem to have issues accepting credit as payment too. My accounts been charged and I‚Äôve been battling with support for two days now? Last night I was told the ticket was being transferred to email format from text. No email sent. Horrible service. We‚Äôre paying customers and they‚Äôve accepted payment, so what‚Äôs up? Where‚Äôs the goods that your customers are paying for lol...
---
Thank you very much.  I am going to go watch those videos now! :)
---
Man gimme a break. It tells you right at the confirmation screen it auto renews and will also pull from your funding source.  
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/GScoelY  
---
Just accept the fact that you didnt look in the right place for subscriptions. This is a daily repost in the ps4 sub from all kinds of subscription services because people dont read the terms.
---
The Sony rep "confirming" there was no renewal doesn't mean jack either, because those reps are all outsourced third world call centers who dont have a clue as to what they are talking about half the time.  
---
Even if you were right it's your fault for bad judgement anyways. After all the crap they've pulled you still trusted them and opened your wallet to them.
---
In the armor repair bench.
---
Can u please explain it to me?
---
It definitely warned you, you just didn't read it. So it's really shame on you.
---
What's a noobtube? That could be my next build - grenades/shotty/a 2h melee weapon
---
After what I went through getting it it‚Äôs going wherever I damn well please !
---
If there was no cancellation option on PS Store, How can I cancel it? If there is a auto renewal there should be cancellation.
---
Did you take repair kits or did they buff the health of the weapon? I have a 2 shot one and it's a hoot, but needs repaired every 4 mags.
---
Noobtube is a 40mm Grenade launcher
---
It tells you in that exact same picture how to cancel it
---
Neat. Thanks for the info. Never tried them out. Sounds fun.
---
Would be awesome, a mansion with basement for power armor would also be cool as shit, or a lighthouse, or.., or..., or...
---
Act like you are modding the gear, there should be an option about paint, or material. There you go.
---
Thanks man
---
There is a cancellation option, and since you didnt see it you werent looking in the right place, as I said above.  
---
Beyond all this, your gripe wouldn't be with Bethesda either way. Sony is the payment processor for PS store purchases. They take your money, keep their cut, give Bethesda the rest. Why do you think Sony was the one to refund you instead of telling you to contact Bethesda? Because they were the ones who took your money and they know if there was a renewal screwup then it was theirs.  
---
I'm probably one of the biggest Bethesda haters on the sub right now but even I am gonna call you out for grabbing your pitchfork and immediately trying to cause another public black eye for them when it's completely unwarranted and because you're jumping to conclusions instead of reading terms of service, doing a little research, and using some common sense.
---
AND IF YOU READ THE IMAGE I POSTED YOU WILL SEE YOU WERE LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE.  
---
Seriously, how many times do I have to repeat it? Look above, the menu is in account settings, subscription management, in your ps4 system menu. Not the store. READ THE DAMN TEXT
---
You still get all the content however I have gone into a private server and certain loots were missing ie ammo bags at Fort defiance even after multiple days of being offline...I usually log into adventure mode do a run somewhere exit and go back to private to find a different server
---
I can do 3000 damage critical shot on an SBQ with a bloodied gauss and upto 2000ish with sneak perks. Even automatic weapons are great or melee weapons
---
Our group has had this discussion, I'm interested to know this as well
---
I'm gonna repeat it on every damn reply of yours.  
---
STOP SAYING YOU CHECKED THE PS STORE FOR CANCELLATION.  
---
THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT YOU DIDNT READ CLEARLY DIRECT YOU TO ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT THROUGH YOUR PS SYSTEM MENU. NOT THE PS STORE.  
---
so yea, you're right. There is no cancellation in the store.... WHICH IS WHY THEY GAVE THE CLEAR DIRECTIONS BEFORE YOU PURCHASED IT SHOWING YOU WHERE TO FIND SUBSCRIPTION MANAGEMENT
---
Look, it's no one's fault but your own that you signed up for an auto-renewing subscription. You didn't read that big ole paragraph of the terms of the service, you just put your card info in and said "just take it".
---
I also signed up, and I read the info like a sensible person, and I know without having to complain on Reddit that I can cancel at any time in your account settings.
---
There's no shady stuff going on, at least in this aspect. If you wanna blame someone for making it harder to find where to cancel, blame Sony. 
---
But mostly, blame yourself for not reading the terms of what you bought and trying to rile people up.
---
I sell power armor sets with desired mods for 5k
---
Although a little variety is always appreciated, i enjoy it even they are so monotonus tbh. At least they are doable without endless server hopping or waiting for this event, waiting for certain circumstances like it was the months before.
---
Maybe if your build circle is in it? I have my base right next to the bridge on the North side of Harper‚Äôs Ferry between the rail line and the road. There‚Äôs a treasure spot immediately on the other side of the road from me and it‚Äôs fine.
---
Knowing where the spot is can you place your camp further away but still have the build area cover where you want your house? You can the move the camp box somewhere else after it‚Äôs placed
---
On a sidenote I used this glitch to get the hunters long coat from the bot by Lady Janets...But showed up and didn‚Äôt have it so I exited and re-joined. Corpses still there, bot still there as well with new inventory. Took 4 or 5 ‚Äújumps‚Äù but bot never disappeared.
---
So... You were killing lvls 35 and 60 over and over with your bloodied PvP VATS geared build and decided to make a video of it.. ? I mean, nice editing, but maybe next time find more worthy opponents.
---
I‚Äôve never had any world loot items missing in a private session unless I had looted them from a public server within an hour or so.
---
I had one night with a roll i hoped for but since then... It's like i cheated on her hot moledaughter.
---
Tl;dr 
---
She hates me. And i hate her too. lol
---
I have repair kits but i don't think i had to use them. The size of the condition bar it drops with is based on your luck stat (i run pretty high luck) and  these things also break a lot slower when they're fired at very long range.
---
My first character was demo and my friend was a heavy gunner. I was giving him ammo and he was giving me explosives. We were an ammo inefficient mess smh. We just cleared trash and even that felt meh
---
Fort defiance is the only place ive noticed this befpre tho.
---
I haven't experienced any "recycling".  I think a lot of people didn't understand the respawn timers, random spawns, and charcter spawn timers.
---
You still play this game?
---
... and another complaint about stolen accounts will be inbound soon.
---
The theme was supposed to be geared towards killing trolls and defending new players. I honestly kinda wish they were higher level. I think the results would have been the same. 
---
I do appreciate the feedback. Hopefully I will have an opportunity to defend some new players from trolls that are my level.
---
I guess at my level, that's difficult to find. I don't typically engage in PVP unless provoked or defending lowbies.
---
Let's vote with our wallets, says the guy who subscribed to FO1st.  
---
Do you have the word irony in your native language?
---
Project paradise frustrates me. I love that event but it's near impossible with this damn event timer. Yea I can solo it with 1 habitat but it's hard to organize a group and just wait for it to randomly start.
---
Yeah the rolling pins are hilarious backup weapons but I guess it takes a really good roll to make them worth using.
---
Gobble gobble!!!
---
I‚Äôd say most of the weapons introduced with 76 are pretty light on modifications, and the 10mm SMG actually has more than most.  Why they didn‚Äôt add a suppressor or post sights is beyond me.  I‚Äôm guessing the game was rushed to market, and they cut some corners when producing new assets.  The crossbow is even worse, with nothing but a prime mod and a square notch that‚Äôs worse than the bent metal posts on a pipe rifle.
---
I have a bloody/limb damage 10mm SMG on my commando.  It‚Äôs actually a great gun, has respectable damage, a controllable rate of fire, good range, it‚Äôs very light, and the ammo is widely available.  Muzzle climb is a little harsh, but it‚Äôs excellent in bursts. If it could be suppressed, that would make the gun one of the better options for a commando.  As it is now, I tend to use it on lower level enemies that aren‚Äôt much threat, just to save on 5.56 and condition lost on my handmade.
---
I‚Äôm hoping some new mods will be added for a bunch of weapons for Wastelanders.  I did hear mention that they planned to do some work on weapons, and a drum mag was added for the 10mm SMG a couple months back.  It wouldn‚Äôt be a stretch that they‚Äôd add a bunch of new mods to go along with new weapons.
---
Cranberry Bog, convenient to SBQ event. Occasionally three Gutsy‚Äôs spawn and one shot all turrets before they can get a shot off. I have 2 missile launchers, 2 heavy lasers, 5 heavy turret and 1 shotgun for the vending machines
---
Wait, hold up, what were you grinding fuzzy tokens for?
---
I tried this out. After attempting to get a turkey for 3 hrs only to have them fall through the world, When I did kill one I could not collect it as I got a text box saying only full-year FO1st member can have this.
---
Me too.  I‚Äôm going to hold off until I get some more troubleshooter armor.  I just got a three start handmade with armor piercing so I‚Äôm getting close.  I don‚Äôt know how people breeze through this thing. Good luck to you too
---
2 missile, 2 heavy laser, 5 heavies and 1 shotgun
---
I've only launched a few and always just look them up.  Too much pain in the ars otherwise.  Having a keycard and dealing with the running the silo is enough.  They should, however, fix a couple of the silo issues.
---
This is the correct answer.  It‚Äôs probably a 15K weapon on the PC, but assault rifles are pretty bad.  That said, a BE assault rifle is going to be as good as an assault rifle gets, and you can use it until you find a BE Handmade, Fixer, Combat Rifle, or 10mm SMG.  I‚Äôd avoid the .45 SMG though.
---
Gobble gobble gobble
---
Reporting back, I watched all the captainoobs videos regarding "Queen Tested".  Appears to me, based on those videos, that Heavy Guns are the way to go.  Gatling Plasma, 50 Cal Machine Gun, Light Machine Gun, Minigun.
---
Because Fallout first wasn‚Äôt a bad enough deal already
---
I think I got scammed.  What happened was I paid someone like 100$ but I was supposed to get exclusive stuff..I didn't I had to pay atoms for it.
---
I was supposed to get a pvt server...people just came in randomly
---
I was supposed to get a modded chest that had infinite storage, deleted items.
---
I did get some new modded emotes.
---
What do?
---
ETA: I got a message telling me this was an actual official transaction :O
---
Why do you like it?
---
Legendary.
---
X to doubt
---
I call my bloodied meat hook 'The Queens Hysterectomy' for this exact reason
---
I would just buy the game without 1st subscription. Fallout isn't really a competitive game. Once you know the mechanics of how PvP is initiated, it is very easy to avoid. If I was you, I would first see if the base game is enough for your needs.   
---
So I would definitely answer "Try public worlds first". No need to decide right after buying the game.
---
It is used in water filters I think and one of the mutation serums.  That is all I am aware of.
---
Yea I probably shouldn‚Äôt do any major build tinkering before Wastelanders. Really hope we get some info on that soon. This isn‚Äôt some Pokemon game just give us a video with new weapons and new mods.
---
Yeah see that's the issue. Same will happen if you're close enough to a fissure site. I had to learn the hard way. If you like the Bog there is a spot I used to CAMP at that didnt get attacked that often and when it did the 2 heavy turrets I had would take care of it. There is a little farm between Forward Station Alpha and The Thorn. It has a house that's missing half and a little shed next to a pond that spawns cranberries. Lots of the little ponds around it are big enough to fit a few large water purifiers and you have access to fresh cranberries whenever you feel like making cobbler or relish. The spot itself spawns ghouls and mirelurks, so nothing you cant handle with basic turrets, and you're still fairly close for queen fights.
---
People Eating Tasty Animals?  Why wouldn't they support that?
---
Ssshhhh.
---
I will delete this after today but I've found spamming the trigger with a Semi-Auto Railway Rifle with a critical ready causes it to consecutively crit until you run out of AP
---
If your pc barely meets the requierments, go for ps4.
---
Cheers üçª
---
what does a 7/8 ghoul look like, headless or what?
---
Oh yeah the water filter makes total sense and ofcourse serums. Didn't think of that. Thanks.
---
Perfect marriage then? Waiting for braZzers to offer you a deal?
---
Haha! Thanks everyone! My wife and I had a blast making it.  Enjoy your Thanksgiving!!!
---
- i enjoy running events, especially public with a server where large amounts of users also run them.
---
- im in the minority(?) that actually enjoys the raids and thinks that they are very rewarding (non bloodied build)
---
- made quite a few friends that are fun to hang out with
---
- solid comminity, we disagree on things, but at the end of the day we would revive eachother no questions asked
---
I'm bored as hell by those 3 that appear every day,not gonna lie. But i would take that over the photo with behemoth and hound(which took me about an hour everytime).  We'd need a better middle ground. Some of them are already in that position.  See why it's hard to decide?
---
Yep I agree and at some point there's only so much you can spend.
---
Your name is Luke, never launched a nuke, must be a fluke.
---
I'll let myself out now.
---
I almost got a hundred now. I wonder if I can get the full suit before Wastelanders.
---
It's the same reason as putting a silencer in shotguns...it's 100% pointless!
---
It‚Äôs only way I‚Äôll ever be a home owner
---
I commented about this on a relevant post yesterday, there are two "No Paint" options available for Urban Scout armour, but apparently not forest according to another person in that post. I would assume it is an incomplete feature or due to the scout armour paints that have been found in atom shop data mines.
---
I think the whole idea for launch codes is kind of trial and error...get a general idea on how the code goes and figure out bit by bit how it actually is
---
Not op but I‚Äôm gonna guess it‚Äôs for the Mr. Fuzzy costume.
---
Nukacrypt.com
---
Well I bought 1st, which expired 4 days ago, and I can still host private worlds and use the Scrapbox, so I didn't bother renewing it lol
---
There‚Äôs a lot of guns, and a few melee weapons, that will deal some heavy damage.  I think it depends on what you like.  If you‚Äôre looking for ‚Äúthe best‚Äù, you‚Äôre likely going to have to buy a B/E ultracite gatling laser from a duper on eBay.
---
I personally like to play bloody stealth builds, and a handmade or fixer will certainly perform well.  At closer range, 150-250 damage a shot with semi auto, and around 100-150 with automatic fire.  A power fist will visibly remove chunks of her health with each hit.  A couple thousand per shot, at least, and that‚Äôs with a couple meat buffs, no double dipped perks or chems.
---
I also have a heavy guns guy with a furious LMG.  The numbers are hard to read, but you can watch her health trickle away as you fire.
---
Shotguns are awful against her, but do keep her on the ground if you attack the wings with Enforcer perk equipped.
---
Gamertag DownwindCloud73.  I usually play with a mic.
---
Shooting it from the roof is the quickest way. Grab the pylon and get on top of the roof and start shooting her with a mini or 50 cal. She would dance back and forth attempts to aim at you but won‚Äôt fire the deadly laser nor can she ram you, die within a couple of minutes. Eyebots fly close to the ground and can‚Äôt bomb you either. If you have another person handle all the gutsys it would be even easier. The real issue is many melee players would try to land a few hits to tag her then run, the imposter would chase them and eventually becomes hard to shoot from the rooftop.
---
You're right, the only judge that matters is yourself. People are going to disagree with you, that's life. No one is trying to stop you from playing or enjoying a  game you already bought.
---
I'm glad you're able to enjoy playing FO76 with friends, genuinely. I don't begrudge anyone their fun. You don't exist in a bubble though, and if you show that you're willing to pay, and keep paying for an unfinished product, then that's what companies like Bethesda will keep making. Companies will make the bare minimum effort, it's all about what you're willing to pay for. That's not opinion, that's a fact of capitalism. 
---
Other people's opinions don't matter, you're right. But that includes your opinion as well. I think Fallout 76 is a terrible game, that demonstrates how far Bethesda has fallen as a company. Giving Bethesda any money for an unfinished product encourages them to continue to make poor quality games, and will lead to worse games in the future. 
---
That's my opinion, and it doesn't and shouldn't affect your enjoyment of the game one bit. And your anecdotal enjoyment of what I know to be an objectively inferior product doesn't bother me one bit. You keep enjoying your game, and I'll keep trying to get people to stop spending money on poorly made games. When those two worlds collide, well we seem to be at an impasse. So I'll say "cheers" and wish you well.
---
Bloodied 50 cal or regular? I run a regular one, couple of them, and I don‚Äôt hit for much damage but I never do so little I don‚Äôt get loot. I think I top out around 14. That‚Äôs with all of the perks I know about but no chems, alcohol, or anything else.
---
Stabilized, tenderizer, heavy gun perks maxed, etc. This isn‚Äôt with sneak or critical but just my normal unloading on the Queen. And for 14 I have to be hitting her in the head. 5 to 7 anywhere else.
---
Lmao are you on ps4? I'll give you a Thanksgiving dense scout chest mod
---
Happy Thanksgiving to you as well. Hope you can get your stuff back!
---
Look you guys keep asking for stuff not realizing that they don care what your suggestions are. They are working on wastelanders and nothing else. They have gone quiet since the announcement of their pay to win private server bs and will probably not ‚Äúfix‚Äù or add anything until they release the next dlc. Y‚Äôall need to stop asking for basic stuff because it isn‚Äôt going to happen
---
It pisses off youtubers looking to generate rage clicks.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and haven‚Äôt yet experienced the inability to respawn. That would only come up at sheepie as I don‚Äôt die during SBQ fights. Sheepie can melt me faster than I can spam stimpacks though. Not as much of I‚Äôm in PA but I don‚Äôt find that as fun.
---
Thx for the help.
---
I'll be on in 4 hours or so if I see a friend request we'll do it. Same nameüëçüèº
---
mriv is bugged in

In enjoying my sneaky shotgun build though. Seeing enemies explode is very satisfying.
---
PS4?
---
Maybe Rose could hack the database to pit raiders against each other via contract hits.
---
Bloodied is really what makes the difference, have to build for that though.
---
I've had different experiences. 
---
In totality most loot is present but I've seen fusion generators without cores despite me never grabbing them. Normally locked doors unlocked and open.
---
The unlimited scrap box is my only reason for 1st
---
That would make the most sense, especially to be promised help only to find communication that BOS was only letting us do the legwork and never planned help.
---
I think there are a few PA mods that use it too.
---
Pc
---
Unfortunately anything that isn't a missile turret is useless outside of the low level zones. I live in the green zone, since I run a store, and want all levels to be safe at it, and run purely on heavy turrets, but I HAD to run pure missiles when I lived in the Mire, and even then, they needed to be up on a raised platform, with amazing views to be made even slightly useful. I do agree that turrets need a rebalance, especially since npcs have stupid range in comparison, but it sounds like your issue is using totally under leveled turrets for the area.
---
One of the most infuriating things I have seen with Bethesda's customer support is the fact that you get a different rep every message and they always regurgitate the same "I understand you are having a problem with X" and often miss the point by a mile. Some of the worst customer support I have ever experienced is because of Bethesda support.
---
No, my good friend. I welcome to jokes in these dark times, haha.
---
Nicely done!
---
PC player checking in
---
Just a quick following piggie backing into your post. Where is the best place to find coal?
---
I'm on PC/North America. I also have a private server. I'll be on tomorrow night. THRDStooge.
---
I could never help them past what I needed to see different dialog options in other games. They would make sense with what‚Äôs needed to run bloodied: being 80% irridated.
---
Happy Thanksgiving!  Except for him as well!  Let me know if you need some junk. I‚Äôll help out!
---
I never experienced fusion cores being a guaranteed spawn. Were the locked doors in enemy-free zones?  I‚Äôve had molemen open locked doors on rare occasions. Was the ground/shelf loot still there?
---
I did notice the gate at the SE tunnel was open the other day, but all the ammo and weapons were there.
---
You got the costume or fuzzy tokens? Either way, CONGRATS!!! :D
---
Gratz!
---
The grind is real.  I‚Äôm almost there.
---
But I LOVE the combat! The location is ripe for overwhelming waves of spawns and random scorchbeasts and their goons, and it would be nice to have some more reliable weaponry on my side when it hits the fan!
---
I don‚Äôt mind having to repair everything after each fight (though I‚Äôm currently short on circuits), I‚Äôd just like to see more hitting power from my guns
---
Yeah, usually my X with SSD loads in at least 10 seconds faster than my one, and the one is connected via Ethernet to my router.
---
I put my against a wall with a switch since I run bloodied. Praise Atom!
---
Strangler Armor and gat plasma. Expect lag but just keep holding that button down the poison melts her
---
Attempted once on day 1 of BETA, never tried since.
---
As much as I love this game I find 90% of the quests are monotonous - *especially* the dailies, but the main and side quests are rediculously bad as well. The lacklustre story and quest design is 76's biggest fault in my opinion, even worse than the constant reintroducing of bugs.
---
ah, I can imagine how bad that was on a timer, at lower level, with limited ammo.
---
Amen
---
I been waiting for this pic. Thanks!
---
Definitely a great starter weapon. Any Starter Bloody has not a perfect roll but weapon that gets them started.
---
Those fuzzy tokens sell real well at my vendor.
---
Seriously? When a lot of them use bugs to do insane damage? Some level 39 killed me in 2 hits with a death tambo, and I was in PA. I was a level 62 at the time. Like, seriously?
---
I‚Äôm a little busy today. Hindsight, probably should‚Äôve posted it on the day I can do it xD 
---
But I‚Äôll add you and we can do it soon for sure :) also, I don‚Äôt have any of the keycards, so, if you‚Äôre okay to hunt for them with me, I‚Äôm definitely down!!
---
I was just in the Whitespring bunker last night and they're listed on the menu terminal in the cafeteria.
---
PS4 checking in as well.  I think Xbox is stuck in traffic.
---
careful friend, they are banning people for even giving reasonable criticism on this page now. bethesda wants this page to be an echo chamber
---
It pisses me off people cant ask others a simple question anymore :)
---
Ah I mis-remembered you can get it for the helmet by scrapping but need plans for the others
---
damn lol
---
I am just trying to get a basic idea of the best ranged guns for the queen -- all other things being equal.  Other things meaning builds, perks, legendary effects.  I know builds, perks, legendary effects are all super important.
---
I won‚Äôt be on til later, anyway. I‚Äôll add you! I don‚Äôt have the keycards, so, if you‚Äôre up for hunting for them, I‚Äôm definitely down :)
---
Get a single star bloodied version of your weapon + a full set of just single star unyielding armor and start playing around 20-40% health.
---
That'll get you the damage you need, without perk cards, to kill enemies with the benefit that unyielding will boost your intelligence score a nice amount and increase your overall XP gain because of said INT boost.
---
Apparently Reddit glitched and posted it 3 times, even though it said error :| apologies, I even wrote a new one that said error. Pfft.
---
Wonder if it's post war, like some person stumbled into west tek and was mutated
---
Yet.
---
I have here some newspaper thirteen months old
---
I wrapped fish inside it; it's smelly and cold
---
But I wouldn't trade it for a big pot o' gold!
---
I love it because it's trash
---
Adrenaline can fix a lot of bad perk systems
---
Maybe start a new character and if you find a cool legendary for your old character, it will help focus your build. I have 3 characters; sneaky commando, gunslinger, melee.
---
That's the great thing about junk:  there's always more junk!

Aw, thanks!  PC here!

Join in any event that pops up, and take a trip to cranberry bog, to craft up cranberry juice, and cobbler. The xp buffs can help quite a bit.

I have also got the problem. How many levels would you need to adjust your build to a shotgun build?
---
I'm in the same boat, I got my atoms though, no access to scrap box or private server. Meanwhile, this is my only week off all year and i wanted to binge play with my wife. I put a ticket in, they said they'd escalate it.... *crickets*
---
The two that do the most damage (for me) so far are the AA LMG and Resolute Veteran.
---
I‚Äôll give that a try, changing everything to missiles. I thought the heavy laser would be good for the area since it takes lvl 3 Home Defense though I hate how slow it fires.
---
NPC range is ridiculously annoying especially since there‚Äôs a big open field nearby. Problem ‚Äúsolved‚Äù with defense wall and a spot to snipe them, but I have to be there when they are. I noticed that enemies spawn when people fast travel to my camp, and if they don‚Äôt clean up after themselves then I come home to a cave cricket munching clear through all my shtuff üò†
---
Thank you for your feedback. 
---
On the first video, they were able to damage me after the person who was "in my party" attacked them. I believe that makes it open season, and sought revenge after every kill. Which is why they were able to do damage to me the entire video. Also, I waited until they shot me and did damage on both attacks before I attacked back.
---
On the second video, they sought revenge after the initial brawl. Plus half of the video was shot at a workshop, which is where the altercation started (before the video).
---
As I stated in a separate response, I don't do PVP typically. I only respond to people bullying other people or defending myself or my base. Which is why I don't have many PVP videos.
---
Based on all the negative feedback, this may be my last PVP video anyway.
---
Use the strangler PA with a gat plasma and wait for the messages come in from players like these talking about how I‚Äôm a cheating and trash for making their game lag when they started to pick the fight first and instantly pop stealth boys/bring out Tesla while chugging quantum‚Äôs
---
Ah those will be the days again but not for a while yet. I fondly remember that no one left those New Vegas tents early when Mr. Fat Man paid a visit. All hail the Fat Man!
---
I‚Äôve got a Vampire‚Äôs Lever Action Rifle which I use, and another lever action with explosive rounds. Both deal about 100-109 damage. 
---
The Vampire causes her to flinch when I hit her, which is extremely satisfying!!
---
Have 10-20 cards in stash between all the guns n armor lmao wouldn't offer otherwise üòâüëçüèº

Im playing on PC, used to play on PS4 before i moved over.

You forgot the "s".

Your sentence should be "what does a 7/8 ghoul***s*** look like, headless or what?".

Hey yal I was stuck in traffic, Xbox checking in.

Thanks for the replies and votes so far. Seems like it is possible to cast multiple votes on the poll, hopefully people won't troll.

Don‚Äôt get the game lol

I'm sorry, am I taking meat from the beasts? üòÇ

Ah, fair enough. Awesome :3

Ah, fair enough. Awesome :3

(PS, sorry if this sends twice, Reddit is being meh)
---
You already have the game just fire it up and play for a little bit and if you don‚Äôt like it then stop playing
---
well technically he said that 7/8 ghouls came running out...
---
I just asked what a 7/8 ghoul looked like.
---
Don‚Äôt buy it, there‚Äôs been a golden one found in the ESM files
---
Sure, let‚Äôs tell them it‚Äôs okay to release a shit game and charge all their dedicated fans full price and if it flops then just make it f2p and keep charging everyone for more updates as the come out. I fully disagree with you.
---
Just play it.

You get it in breach an clear sometimes, or ore actually. For the possum miner badge, you have to take a pic of a deposit, so I go there to make (chameleon, ithink) serum. Water filter is so dumb, lol.
---
Fallout 1st is not required to play although looking at what you get from it, its not a bad deal.
---
The game has improved in terms of stability. Major bugs have been fixed, minor bugs still exist.
---
Although, I will say, with Fallout 1st, it's less laggy and faster load times
---
Big Bend tunnel. It‚Äôs filled with Scorched, which even at higher levels are pretty squishy. Run it, server hop, run it again and again. You‚Äôll get some levels pretty quickly. Once you can deal a little damage, do the same thing at WestTek. You‚Äôll level even faster. 
---
Take workshops and jump into any workshop defense events you see. They‚Äôre usually easy and dump some decent XP and resources on you. Make sure you‚Äôve stashed your junk before doing this, as you do risk PvP in those zones. 
---
Use a site like www.nukesdragons.com to plan out your build so you know what you‚Äôre going for. 
---
Make sure you get your sleep XP bonus. Cranberry foods also give you a little boost‚Äîbut if you want efficiency, don‚Äôt spend a lot of time gathering resources to make them. You‚Äôll pick up what you would‚Äôve gained by killing a couple of enemies. Any chems that boost INT are good too. Higher INT gives you more XP.
---
This would work if I like to use rifle and sneak about? 
---
(Tho I seen lots people with low health around. They make me panic, thinking I need to heal them. :D) 
---
I try find any bloodied rifle. What price is normal for these? So won't over pay. 
---
Thank you so so much. 
---
I was kinda hoping there be some type of set up to fix dmg before I have perk cards. Perfect answer.
---
Laughed so hard I started to cry. Imagine a squad of bloodied paddle ball and BOS power armor equiped taking down the SBQ. Wait, wait, I need to get my camera!

Yea. I have some in my misc ore section, and need some for serums, but I can not remember where I got it. You figure it is West Virginia there would be coal mines.....lol
---
It's a perk in agility that gives you a damage boost for every thing you kill in 30 seconds. It has 5 ranks but even 1 rank can boost your damage by up to 32%
---
Ooh! Berry picking. Sounds fun. I need to locate this bog.

Thank you. :)

Went to the Enclave Bunker to get the X01 plans when I checked my inventory this morning &amp; I had a Power Armour chassis I didn't have before. So I placed it &amp; low &amp; behold it was my beloved X01 suit! The name had been changed to the  default , but it was the same suit. Really strange because the only suit I had last night when it disappeared was the Ex suit. But I'm not complaining, at least I got it back and also have the plans to make another thanks to the tips here. Now just need to bulk buy some stable flux to keep in reserve "just in case".
---
The best way to farm XP is to run a nuked Whitepsrings.
---
To begin with get a set of power armour.  At level 67 you should have a set by now, but if you don't, pick some up.  Try to get all level 45 or level 50 pieces, so you're looking for T-51b or T-60.  
---
Make sure that you have Radaway and Rad-X and make the Diluted version.  You only need a few Rad-X but you'll need a lot of Diluted Radaway, about 50 should do.
---
Get the Ghoulish perk card up to max level.   The higher the better.  This will save you from having to use Stimpacks in Nuke zones.
---
Get a long range weapon, like a handmade, a LMG, assault rifle, etc.  It doesn't have to do a lot of damage, it just has to shoot long range to "tag" mobs.  If your alone, you'll need higher damage weapons, but the best way to level up is to join a group, even if you're not officially part of the team.  You're goal in the group is not to kill the mobs, but just to make sure that you tag each one before they are killed.
---
Typically, one or two groups form naturally or by design.  For example, I like to pull the mobs to me and then cripple them with an explosive shotgun.  If I see other players in the area, I'll wave them over and then we will do a circuit, with me crippling them so that they can't move and the other players tagging and bagging.
---
If you haven't already done so, do the Enclave events and become a general so that you can launch your own Nukes.
---
Finally, look for Double-XP weekends.
---
Why do people play WoW? Why do people still play SWTOR? Or CoD BlOps? Or Street Fighter 3: 2nd Impact? Presumably because they enjoy it. This is just me venting a bit rhetorically by the way.  
---
The main reason I have and continue to enjoy this is the exploration; I like wandering around to see the world. I like Bethesda's environmental storytelling and I genuinely lovely the visuals in this. It could use a bit more colour depth, but that's very much a subjective statement.  
---
Despite having played since the BETA, roughly daily, there are still things I come across that I've missed, or slipped my mind, or whatever. There are still things to hunt down and discover. I've been comparing this to an old school PC adventure game since the beginning and I stand by. The game doesn't really hold your hand outside of direct quest points and I like that. I like trying to figure out what happened at ATLAS and what Bethesda plans to do with it.  
---
Heck, I initially pushed my Lockpicking to 3 just so I could get into the Mothman cult area in Point Pleasant.  
---
I also like the ambient music and sound design. I dawned on me in the Glass Cavern that was what unsettled me the most about the place: the combat music never starts. You just have that eerie background sound, and then when something rushes you, nothing drums up to get your blood going; the familiar doesn't occur and therefore things get more and more unsettling.  
---
The combat system appeals to me. It did in 4, and it does here. While I can't do my "invincible Atom's Judgement" build like I could there, mostly because you can't just level everything, I really enjoy the feel of Heavy Guns and Power Armor. Even with Yao Guai being able to stagger me more easily than a Deathclaw, you still feel like a walking tank, wading into the thick of it and just driving death into them. Heck, I keep toying with a Pain Train build from time to time, which never appealed to me in 4.  
---
Beyond all that, a recent return to WoW drove home something I hadn't originally noticed: this is better at community and events. People are welcome to vent their frustrations all they want about the Event system, and it's still by no means perfect, but when a nuke hits the Prime Fissure? Pretty much everyone on the server shows up to party. Hell, the first time I fought her we lost, nowhere near the timer count by the end, and every single gun I had broke (I wound up trying to punch her to death for a laugh.) But it was a blast all the same.  
---
I'll chat with my team in NW, emote at people when I'm running around Appalachia, and just generally pitch in where I can when the opportunity presents itself.  
---
To loop that back around to the WoW comparison: WoW is almost a checklist for me now. Login, grind out dailies (Fuck Gnomes and double-Fuck Mechagon), queue for LFR because I don't have a guild and people don't pug shit in BfA anymore, get bored and logoff because there's more than enough DPS to fill the space I'd be vying for.  
---
I'd be somewhat willing to argue that's kind of the hitch with Raids here: they're too much like a more traditional MMO. If could spot someone in 94, wander in and give them a hand, if it was more like a standard Event, I think people would take to them better.  
---
At least here, the gameplay loop is less "grind dailies" and more "grind supplies." It's a subtle difference, but the randomness makes it intriguing.  
---
For example: right now I need some lead. Not a lot, but I'm under 3k .50 Cal rounds, and I'll go through that if I go for the raid or wind up fighting a SBQ scenario where it decides "clearly these folks need more Mirelurk Queens" until you can't see for the crab nightmares.  
---
There's about four places off the top of my head I can go to farm that, and it's all my choice, based on my mood. In the process, maybe I'll come across another player to help, or a neat Legendary'll drop that I'll toy around with, or I'll come across something that'll inspire me to mod my PA differently or redecorate my house. Even if none of that happens, I'll have a generally good time and be up some lead.  
---
Comparatively: I go to Mechagon to grind dailies. To get Rep. So I can get Flying. So I can... ... ... yeah, that's it. It allows me to get around easier, but flying doesn't actually mean shit with regards to Raiding, beyond wracking up supplies for Feasts. And even then, in any pug someone's already done it, and in any guild, someone has definitely done it, so I don't necessarily need to do it. Plus: it's not fun. Fishing is not thrilling gameplay, it requires no real strategy or clever thinking; it's not an obstacle to overcome. It's a necessary inconvenience. It's a job you don't like. That's not a good time.  
---
Now, is 76 perfect? Not a chance in a Hell. But I have played far, far worse MMOs over the years, with far, far greater problems than anything I've encountered in this, and yes, that includes the crashing. D3's Error 37, and it's various permutations, caused me far more rage than losing about 30 seconds to a drop out, jump back in on here. This has never irritated me to the point I've considered breaking my keyboard or mouse due to bullshit difficulty, but I know how to put a PS2 controller back together because of Jinpachi.  
---
Its gameplay is as enjoyable as 4's, its setting and story are intriguing both in what it tells you and what it doesn't as well as being better written than 4's (I've burned hours on a buddy's podcast going over how I'd rewrite 4|Admittedly, 76 does this by keeping its actual main story to a minimum, but that's still an improvement), its got a better group and Event system than most others MMOs, and it can be as relaxing or exciting as you want to make it.  
---
That's why I'm still playing Fallout 76 today.
---
Some loot has a chance to appear, namely outfits, magazines, bobble heads, etc.  You‚Äôre not guaranteed to get them when you enter a cell.
---
It's in the south east.
---
Beautifully written
---
ye but it doesn't make any sense...shotguns are not meant to be silent!They are meant to murder enemies loud and efficiently!
---
Exactly my point
---
Please Santa, can I have one of those for Christmas? I promise to be really, really, good!
---
If you look at it that way, every legendary effect is stupid. Hardly any aspect of this entire game makes sense from a logical/reality standpoint. But we‚Äôre drawing the line at explosive lasers?
---
Shhhhhh...... ü§´
---
it must be a curve, not straight line, i just connected knowing points with straight line but in fact its a curve
---
Do you know how a laser works?
---
[deleted]
---
I will get this. Tho what I have the now i can only kill level 1-25 enemies that fast. 
---
But once I find the gear to do dmg, going for this. 
---
Always make sure you're well rested. AaronHolt farm is a good low-level place to get cranberries for cobbler. Do the mothman lighthouse event whenever it pops up and kill things in the highest level area that your gun is actually effective until you straighten out your perks. Or if it's really bad start a new character. I screwed up my first character so bad I actually gave up trying to fix it and started over myself.
---
This is a very good inside the vault! Say what you will about 76 but Bethesdas environments are always fantastic and Wastelanders is definitely no exception! This is also a confirmation that scorchbeasts do still exist since there's a settlement under Spruce Knob specifically to hide from them.
---
This is the biggest thing for me.  I dislike going to what looks like a well stocked player vendor just to find them asking 5k caps for a mutants, +1 PER, 50% durability trapper leg.  If you wouldnt use it yourself, what makes you think someone else us going to pay that kind of caps for it? All its doing is taking up vendor and stash space for something that will never move.
---
Breach and Clear, Coal Deposits, and the Grafton Monster drops coal.  
---
I farm the Hemlock Holes Workshop for acid and then go out on to the flats to find Snallygasters.  Sometimes they spawn there along with the Grafton Monster, which always spawns.  Snallys drop acid so I pick on the Grafton Monster at the same time...
---
Try killing the lower level enemies in a group first before the higher level ones so you fight them with a damage boost.
---
Nice. Thanks for the tip. Grumps
---
In my opinion, Bloodied is the strongest, second is junkies, third is probably furious,AA, and then TSE is decent too. The strongest in terms of raw damage is the bloodied Meathook as it double dips from one handed and unarmed perks. Rifles you want a stealth crit build.
---
Fair enough. Usually I just make a new character and power through up to 50 if I want a new build.
---
It‚Äôs sad that the Fatman and Missile launcher nerf is a product of the explosive guns nerf
---
I find this annoying as well.  I would like to at least see an indicator next to the item categories on the map marker that shows how many of a weapon or armor are legendary.  Of course, then people will just put a bunch of 1* junk items to bait people to come to their camp.
---
Instigating for leveling up for sure, and for in general against pve. If you do it right its 1 shot, 1 kill most the time. AA for number 2 because nothing will ever go against that and you can have full health without any negatives. Of course ffr and fr always helps lol. Not everything has to be explosive to get the job done even tho everyone swears by it, more then one way to skin a cat lol. Bloodied is great for damage, even better if youre a stealth build but youre a sneeze away from death most the time. I have a bloodied melee, its fun dont get me wrong but one wrong choice and youre dead. I honestly always go for instigating or AA by far. My level 5 IE pipe bolt pistol will carry me on a new toon until level 30 where i then switch over to a instigating hunting to carry to level 50. Depends if you want PVE or PVP. Also stealth with any pve is awesome for those damage multipliers
---
If ur asking people if they think you should get back in the game, ur gonna get two answers. Just play it and decide for yourself.
---
Dbsw?
---
They said some time ago that scorched plague is still around during Wastelanders events
---
Ok, this looks damn cool
---
The Camden Park dailies were glitched out for me and never spawned after the initial completion so I just gave up on trying to collect tokens. Glad to know some people get to enjoy them, though!
---
For all the criticism I've made of Bethesda, I do find myself warm to them redeeming themselves. Those pictures show promise!
---
There once was a Duke named Luke, who never launched a Nuke
---
He posted on Reddit, it was no fluke
---
And now he's fighting the Queen, stepping with flair
---
with a Jive and a Juke.....
---
I admit it... mine was worse...  but it had to be done...   .grin.
---
I disagree.  In just about any multiplayer game with an in-game economy, resourse (i.e caps) sinks are necessary to fight the kind of inflation that leads to people asking 150k caps for a single item.
---
What we need are more and better options for caps sinks to make the caps in circulation more valuable.  Something like paying caps (10k?) to reroll legendary effects on existing gear or have an npc vendor station where you can use caps to repair gear instead of needing to use crafting materials.
---
I only run marsupial and grounded.. 
---
I do not run class freak there are other perks more important to me than taking 5800 mutations and 3pts of class freak
---
Class Freak. It's a luck perk that negates most of the negatives, and Starched Genes makes it so once you have the mutations you want, you don't get more, or lose the ones you have.
---
Hope there somewhere high I can jump to. Hmm... Then will do. ‚ò∫Ô∏è scorched spook me out, with their growls and mumbling. "...not us..."
---
Workshop I will avoid. I don't like PvP, so don't want to risk it. 
---
I need Google these locations, I dunno if have found them since staying left side of the map.
---
Damn wish I wasn't still at work lol
---
You‚Äôre good, just pour another 1000 hours into the game before you get decent weapons people have had since release. Shotguns fucking suck.
---
There is a spot near a power pylon west of the snake on the golf course.
---
I want to be a ghoul T\_\_\_\_T
---
Yeah but I was curious if they were still around to add gameplay or because they were still around in the lore. It's definitely the lore. I guess everyone got the vaccine we made in the story.
---
You know this won't feed the whole vault, right? You're gonna have to head on out there and get some more "turkeys" üòÜ
---
Thanks for the laughs üòÇ
---
I‚Äôve had the same experience. It tells me that most of the players are actually cool, and the bad ones are rare.
---
Gauley mine has a few ore nodes of it. It's one of the first places you discover just north of the overseers camp.  You probably picked it up there way back at the beginning.
---
Or put a level/switch/platform/brahmin/whateveryouwant to activate it.
---
Haha thanks! We had a good time making it!
---
Do scorched earth and tag every mob that you see , drink or eat cranberry foods for xp boost and get xp boost from sleep
---
Wait... You're WIFE and you? You forced her to dress up as a turkey and head out into Appalachia... Didn't you üòè
---
I see what happened here, you sly Hunter you üòÇ
---
I guess I'm with Marie Curie III. Ghouls are the evolution.
---
I think Instigating is the one Legendary Effect I've seen the least, maybe one in the entire time on my main character. Most times, I'll get an effect that's geared towards killing ghouls, Mirelurks, or insects. Occasionally a Medic effect. Instigating? It does not want to come out to play.
---
Do you still need the cannibal perk for this one? Happy turkey day ya bunch of Filthies!!
---
They already said test servers won't be around until 2020. Christmas event is confirmed for this December though then they'll start talking more about Wastelanders in ITVs.
---
If you are always in a team, Herd Mentality is nice.
---
Yeah that meathook is fun, 10k damage easy lol. The pipe pistols still double dip so you can get a decent chunk out of them too with high accuracy.
---
You say I'm paying for something unfinished.. It feels 100% what it's supposed to be. You go play Conan Exiles then maybe you'll realize the intended direction. Happy Thanksgiving my dood.
---
marsupial and speed demon are mandatory.
---
I craft more healing items that in a single day usually anyways. A quick FT to Watoga to kill 10 bots takes like maybe 5 minutes if that?
---
And pre-war food?  I just 20 Halloween Candies out of the 2500+ I have from all the Monster Mash‚Äôs I‚Äôve run to level up characters quickly. That takes like 10 seconds. 
---
Kill a Deathclaw?  FT to Deathclaw Island and one-shot the little guy. 
---
Level up?  Cool, I‚Äôm already over level 76, so I‚Äôll just throw on my Responder suit and a Fashnacht mask, take a nap and pop a Cranberry Relish and go out and kill stuff like I was going to do anyways. 
---
Drink a Nuka Cherry?  Sure, I‚Äôve got like 100 of them. 
---
Kill Fireflies?  If Path to Enlightment pops, that‚Äôs simple. Otherwise, there‚Äôs places around the map you can find a bunch if you know where to look. 
---
And so on. Most of them are quick &amp; easy and you can knock them out in a few minutes. Others you can incorporate as a part of your normal play. 
---
I‚Äôd rather they be easy than challenging, especially for the low number of Atoms they grant.
---
Events and more events.
---
I just started playing on xbox, I'm only lvl10 though
---
subway platorm. craigslist meetup
---
Effects?
---
Thanks. Going back over it, I'm noticing some typos and errors I'm prone to.
---
Really should edit my own work.
---
Removing existing ones would be a sure fire way to get even more people to quit playing
---
To keep you warm at night.
---
Most of it is junk and a few important pieces of armor. Before I dropped the missiles, there was a lot I couldn't keep because of space limitations. But now I'm starting to collect other shit. I'm up to about 280 now. Lolol
---
I'm too poor for that lol
---
At least plain colour skins.
---
You do realize someone can do something they later realize is wrong? 
---
I, for one, am pleasantly surprised to see a FO1ST subscriber admit that pay walling the scrap box is a bunch of bullshit. Every time I've told other subscribers that that scrap box and forward tent are QoL improvements and should *not* be locked behind a pay wall, they come flocking in with their downvotes. 
---
Pay walled QoL stuff is exactly why I haven't subscribed and it's also why I stopped buying Atom Shop bundles. I used to regularly spend money on FO76. I haven't spent a cent on them since the refrigerator glorified reskin came out and I'll continue not spending money until they knock it off with pay walled QoL stuff.
---
Nice man
---
I pretty much prefer those than the old ones. As monotonous as they are. Easy Atoms -&gt; More Atom Shop sellings -&gt; More chances of someone buying Atoms to refill.
---
Clearly you did.
---
that underground parking garage looks dope
---
I have tried to go to nuke zones in power armour, but if there high levels they just kill things so so fast. I stomp there and.. enemy dead.  I stomp other way, enemy dead. Hihih. It funny, also makes me dizzy. But think I need try this tag them(?) method? Hopefully fast enough. 
---
And try find group that leveling, and don't mind me, maybe join some ps4 community. Hmm... But I don't want to be bother. üòî
---
I did enclave long ago, when fallout came out, but it was when had friends playing the game. Probably why wanted so bad get any perk cards that could help them, not really realizing I would put myself in this situation of no dmg. 
---
Last double XP weekend was good. I got almost 2 levels a day. Reached 60 then.
---
i think i run all but 3 on my Bloodied melee / rifle / commando / heavygun char, lol
---
several of the mutations have no negative effects at all...
---
Or making income off of games that are run better than FO76. I'm planning on taking advantage of the sales to get FO4 for my PC.
---
Hahaha I been pining for more Wastelanders info‚ù§Ô∏è thanks BGS
---
Now how can we read way too far into these images and what premature conclusions can we come to? Personally I like how they're referring to this as an 'update', possibly meaning there will be 'expansion' content further down the line where they'll introduce new areas outside the map like The Pitt
---
To be honest, at first Speed Demon seemed like a good deal. Faster reload and increased movement speed for a little extra thirst and hunger? Yes please! Except... while it's nice to be able to ram 5 rounds into my lever action in 2 seconds, i can't go anywhere without at least 15 drinks and 5-7 edibles on me. If Class Freak worked better on it SD would totally be worth it, but alas... I had to take Carnivore and the luck perk that gives you meat when you use a stimpak (bloodied sneak rifleman build) to offset the negatives, which actually is kind of fun. I can't find cats in the game but my stimpaks will give me cat meat, sloth meat, sheepsquatch meat, and other random weird meat from creatures I've never seen! 
---
In my own experience, the mutations that hurt your SPECIAL stats are easily offset by all the unyielding armor I wear. I was wary of Marsupial myself, but now that I can jump like a kangaroo I can't go back to being normal!
---
Im not saying Bloodied Unyielding is the be-all end-all answer, but whatever mutation you want, you just have to figure out a way to compensate or play around its negative. As for me, if I could carry around a portable smoker or bbq, my wasteland brothers and sisters would be eating good!!
---
Last week of December to be exact.
---
Excellent. Thanks
---
I usually use a Junkie's Explosive railway rifle, Furious Faster Fire Rate handmade as my backup, and a Junkie's Faster Swing Speed combat knife for when I'm conserving/out of ammo. I have an arsenal in my stash for different purposes though, like a Vampire's Tesla rifle and Vampire's explosive shotgun to help keep me alive during Vault raids.
---
This looks very promising.  Thanks for showing.
---
 I run 5 mutations. Let me help you with side effects. Corn soup. I make piles of it and it is both water and food but lighter than either. I have it hotkeyed. ;)
---
I can join if you want!Add Nocturnius
---
Been joining the past few days, and it gets a bit annoying. Even though there are a bunch of players around, people don't activate the pylons. People are greedy and want part of the loot so bad, that they miss out on both the loot and the rewards.
---
Happened last night at a Violent Night too, they were in such a rush that half the people didn't get time to even tag the legendary.
---
When people started acting like that later on at Uranium Fever, even though I just draged a legendary to the others to tag, I decided to pick up the sledge and start one-shotting the miners instead.
---
Gauly mine. south-west of morgantown. Don't forget to wear your excavator suit.
---
Its a awesome effect! I can go into westek with a instigating 10mm using only crack shot, stealth, adrenaline, and gunfu and clear the place in like 9 mins lol. I use my instigating ffr, fr 10mm for farming areas since 10 mm ammo is easy to find. If the effects are nice on the ghouls, etc, keep them, you never know when they might come in handy for a event. My troubleshooters explosive fixer decimated the halloween event better then my AA ffr less vats combat. Also i forgot about furious lol, but to really make the best out of it you need concentrated fire at atleast rank 2 so you can really get those stacked numbers. Camp hop and look, weapons are way easier to find then they use to be lol. However it seems the RNG gods are on my side with this game lol, i found all my weapons by chance while playing, never off reddit. Youll pay so much more off here, so if youre looking go talk to people in the wastes at their camps, or just camp hop and hopefully through the power off attraction youll get what you want. Hasnt failed me yet üòÅ
---
Paint him green and give him a dog companion lol
---
I didnt touch them till after level 80 cause I thought it would make my experience less authentic. Dont be me. I run like all but 3 now but marsupial and speed demon are an absolute must.
---
A 10mm? One of the weakest pistols in the game? Rocking it? Color me impressed.
---
The trick is to save up the excess shleem.
---
I ran a basic all-rounder build until 50 and then respecced slowly to a more focused one, it's not that difficult, just make sure to rest and use the XP boosting foods etc. and you level pretty quickly.
---
Hah I was making wheat soup or whatever it is from my Whiskey crop supply
---
To people complaining about Speed Demon cons, it's time for you to use bubble gums. Basic bubble gums decrease hunger and thirst speed by 50%, that cancel SD 50% augmentation.
---
I can't tell if you're trolling about the shotgun bit or not. My shotguns, even without giving them perks, have absolutely wasted some of the dead deadliest creatures I've come across. That, and I know TS shotguns (especially those with explosive as well) are widely sought after by top tier players
---
I couldn't make it past the annoying intro.
---
Gamertag is same as my username, happy to help out.

---
Enjoy lol, that wasnt my best run lol. I was checking bodies every so often and was getting distracted.
---
Still a bit nervous about NPC's being added. Afraid they will get stale very soon.
---
 Get a Western Revolver and put a long Barrel and Reflex Sight on it. Hardened its real strong and with that setup not a bad sniper.
---
 Later you will have to toss pistols. ;)
---
I was actually kinda bummed when I learned the codes were the same for everyone and could be used over and over. I thought we'd have to decode one each time. I also thought the whole nuking experience would be a bit more intense.
---
I would love to see them make nuking harder to do, and also much more rewarding. I'm talking special nuked legendaries that are actually challenging to kill and who drop exclusive prefixed items which you can't get anywhere else. While we're at it, how about a scorchbeast queen that's more than just a bag of HP that drops garbage loot. Make it a challenge, and make it drop *good* stuff.
---
I thought they patched it so you can't build there anymore months ago?
---
Most of the negative effects can be balanced and erased with an unyielding build, mutation is definitely a must have for endgame.
---
THE GUNSLINGER IS ALIVE AND WELL IN THIS GAME!
---
The Scaly Skin mutation requires 3 coal.  Coal can be found at Gauley Mine (between Flatwoods and Morgantown); it‚Äôs in the deep part of the mine, but there‚Äôs an unmarked entrance to this to the north of the mine‚Äôs map marker.  Just follow the train tracks north, and then the tracks will branch off, leading you to the unmarked entrance...  I seem to recall there was a quest you could trigger at the mine that had you collect coal.
---
I like your thought better than mine, my first thought was update meaning.....they‚Äôre delaying it again!?!?
---
But they last so short.
---
Nuke WS and farm the glowing ghouls. You get 2.5 hours from nuke to farm. After each run through relog to respawn the ghouls. Rinse and repeat. Best way I‚Äôve found to get everything I need. Then when time is nearly up or I‚Äôve gotten bored, I hit the plants for the raw flux.
---
My understanding is that BE Ultracite Gatlings do not exist in the game, but rifles/pistols do.  That said, even if they did, I think the BE Gatling Plasma would do more damage.  I own both a BE GP and BE GL, as well as an B25 Ultracite Gatling.
---
Just did it to make my Urban match my other Forest pieces, you can 100% switch it back and forth with both.
---
yup :)
---
They probably have the day off they are an American company
---
Get it on a gaming platform not pc due to cheaters
---
Been waiting 4 days for a response on my scrap box issue. I'm actually just going to let it go at this point.
---
Events and most of all, daily events are your way to go. Otherwise I did the same mistake as you, and I made another character and I took care of taking only perks that I needed for my progression. Now both of my char are lvl100+ and my second character build is event better than my first.
---
A lever is definitely sub-optimal for the SBQ. I‚Äôd use something like a Furious Handmade, or along those lines.
---
Seems like the kind of place where some pre war families might have made a living when the bombs fell. Would be cool to see a settlement down there
---
Thanks lol, like i said more then one way to skin a cat. Pistols are severly underrated and really fun. If you want to test your stealth make a pistol build, itll teach ya a thing or 2 for sure. I still have mine and use her every so often. The one in the vid was my universal soldier üòÅüòÇ
---
Everytime I try to use an emote to get someone's attention about a legendary, the wheel bugs out and goes to favorites instead. But, it's still a good idea.
---
Why because there's not a ton of op weapons in the game anyway?? Whatever thanks anyway for the downvote for no reason ...
---
I didn't downvote you, 3 random people did but now that you mention it
---
In addition to the already mentioned Gauley mine, Blackwater mine also has a small amount of coal, in the area where mole rats or wolves spawn (before the passage to the left with the mole miners).
---
üëéüèª
---
I love the screenshots and I'm genuinly hyped for any cultist storyline. 
---
That being said, I hope that Bethesda doesn't overdo it with new large open underground spaces. It's a cool trick to add brand new places, but it can be used only so much until it starts to stand out.
---
Anyway, tonight I'll maybe try to pinpoint the location of the raider camp. I really like comparing before/after screenshots. In the past I spent too much time looking at screenshots of Europa Universalis 4 province updates...
---
What system?
---
Yup! Herbivore here too. Farmlands with nothing but corn. All you ever need

I have this elaborate vision in my head of recording video and setting it to the WKRP in Cincinnati audio.  If someone more creative than me wants to take a shot at it.  :)  Cargobot = helicopter.  Find a Super Duper parking lot. One person looking reporter like (don't forget the glasses) annnnd GO.
---
As God as my witness, I thought turkeys could fly.
---
EDIT: Because I can't spell reporter apparently.
---
beats molerats chewing on your buttocks while perusing vending machines...
---
Must be from that quest. I always had a bit in my stash that I kept in case. Now I know I don't really need it. Thanks.
---
Read the FAQ.
---
Handmade.
---
Nah. unless i jump off something high im good.
---
It‚Äôs a damn immortal turkey.
---
Only meant that in reference to the ‚Äúgame‚Äù that dropped on the initial release bud
---
Agreed.
---
If they fixed their stupid building tool and allow simple stacking without having to glitch, it would be awesome if they put in structural integrity
---
So for every one foundation, you can only place surrounding floors in one space around it.
---
Therefore, biggest tower you get is a 3x3 with a one base, which doesn‚Äôt look too bad
---
I think it‚Äôs called the AK-47 comrade
---
They aren‚Äôt telling you that it‚Äôs filled with top tier nasties that‚Äôll eat yer face off.
---
Just know that going in.
---
On one hand I‚Äôd say to play the game you bought. On the other hand I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt play the game you bought. 
---
Hope that helps!

Xmas and ex girlfriends.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs not the laser. My BE 50cal breaks 100/shot on the queen. That Gatling laser was hitting like... 27?
---
Decreased stash space
---
Thanks for the laugh. Have an upvote.
---
I see this a lot on uranium but in events like fasinacht or mischief night they kill it off faster then it can spawn.
---
Not the absolute worst effect I guess... what's other 2?
---
"Foundation settlers"? Capitalized F. Do i smell new faction?
---
Isn't the post picture from the first trailer before release?
---
Even at this point they already showed us stuff that isn't in the game over one year after release... 
---
Bethesda I really want those square windows!! And whats that for a sign above the door we also don't have right now? 
---
Oh and those mounted heads, which we also don't have, look great!
---
If you feel scammed you need to talk to those who buy soda at a football game üòÇ
---
Because I lack adequate long-range offensive against the Queen, I too, am often forced to break out All Rise to smack her bulbous badonkadonk while screaming like a headless Suicide Guy from Serious Sam.
---
Bethesda support is horrible in my experience.  I just got generic replies that didn't address my problem.
---
That‚Äôs a good point if we‚Äôre focused on the game not failing, which I would love a D2 version of fallout but I‚Äôm not okay with supporting poor business practices to that end. Disagree with me ‚Äúmore‚Äù if you want, it‚Äôs not a competition. It‚Äôs the degradation of the gaming community that your opinion supports ‚Äúmore‚Äù.
---
Hope it's getting nerved in the future
---
They nerfed shotgun to decoration grade long time ago, just take it as a weak melee weapon with pyro effects üëå
---
I do this when just roaming around.  If I see another player in the area I‚Äôll pop the legendary and signal the other player so they get a shot or two in.  
---
Note, I always pop first because some folks will just kill it outright.
---
It really is.
---
Yeah, fuck that guy.
---
I‚Äôve never really gotten into the Handmade weapon. I had one at like lvl25 or so, but once I got the Lever Action, I dropped it. 
---
So I‚Äôll go check out the Handmade. Always good to learn something new!
---
This. So this. This guy gets it. 
---
I run bloodied 2h which one shots alot. So I pick up a looted weapon to do less damage.
---
Armor decay is insignificant and respawn is always close.
---
According to gamstat there are still 100k monthly active players on PS.
---
It‚Äôs a joke, chill.

The mischief night event was a bit chaotic with robots everywhere.

This is really on bethesda to solve. Outside of Scorched Earth, everyone at an event shouldnt have to tag to get the drop.
---
Sorry man, there's only about 5 of us that still play the game
---
bog standard combat shot gun will do the job, just make sure its armour (superior) peircing.....and I have only 30% on shotguns, with no other cards etc in play. (dmg 147).
---
edit (if they land ! )
---
Nothing, the first one prevents the second one form attaching to you..
---
Maybe there should be a perk or something that by day you're all about the salad and at night you in the mood for steak.
---
they nerfed damage pretty hard, really the only reason to carry a shotgun anymore is 3* enforcer cripple -&gt; quickswap to primary weapon type.  
---
the cripple is still god tier at least, pretty much the only selling point.
---
Fire rate and armor penetration is a lot higher on the Lasers.
---
I have a bloodied, explosive 50 as my secondary.
---
I believe their stats are 160dmg and 225dmg respectively, but the Laser pumps out more than twice the rounds.
---
Way cheaper in ammo, too!
---
Biggest drawback to the Laser is the spindown time if you need to heal. Longest 2 seconds of my life :D
---
My 5mm Gatling Gun crits for just over 400 on her, but the fire rate and accuracy makes it inferior.
---
Don't think we've met in game but 6 with meüòÇ

I'm on a FB group and they're giving 10k for a piece of Bolstering with AP and food weight.

They ALWAYS come back for more. I run one piece of chameleon armor 24/7 just for that reason.
---
lol thanks, I still use shotty from time to time, just for the fun effects üòÇ
---
Sorry I should have said PC
---
SO very cool.  You may find that enemies spawn in the upside down now.  Watch out.  Also some people may actually report you for glitching.  I'm not sure what the rule is on building below the surface.  It looks amazing anyways and I hope it's not a problem.  It is possible to lose your on hand junk sometimes though if you fall or another player falls but usually you will just resurface above the point where you fell.  Be careful!
---
Even odds between BoS and Enclave, with that description.

I cannot wait to shoot one of those cars and watch the chain reaction

i got it from grahm, i thought they were super rare rofl

Oh ye.. south east. Think it maybe one of areas I once tried explore, but got mirelurk queen do surprise pop up from pond. I ran.. but mirelurk king served my face soon to the queen on plate. XD 
---
There was a pink/red forest tho I saw in distance.
---
It that area?
---
Turkey's been getting gear off reddit lmao
---
The fact that the game has been out for a year and people don't know this yet amazes me
---
By nature the content won't be very replayable, but it should provide a good starting base for new players and the expectation is that more quests will continue to be added for future content
---
Nah. New players like me, show up all the time.
---
I'd certainly like to get MREs as a new form of non-spoiling food ration at the cost of higher thirst. Would also be nice to be able to make salted jerky out of meats and also can up preserves made from mutfruit, cranberries, starlight berries, etc. That is another thing, why does cranberry jam spoil so damn fast? It is a jam people! It is supposed to keep for like a year! Also why do so many pastry recipes require mirelurk eggs!? Those aren't common. Swap to frog eggs if anything. I'd much prefer radchicken eggs being added along with chicken coops.
---
This is why i have a hard time turning away from fallout 76. This community is fucking lit! My favourite is seeing pictures and videos like this and reading about other vault dwellers helping out lower level people. Keep it up guys! You all are inspirations
---
That's awesome man it's good to see other people doing this as well! I know what you mean about the melee as I have a bloodied gauntlet build to,but that's mostly for queens. 
---
I love helping people and not being a dick in the game, yesterday I had so many legendaries in prep for the sale, when we started doing queens I couldn't hold anymore, I would loot any legandaries and find a player under 100 and wave em down and drop what what I had!!!
---
Did two UF in a row and difference was like night and day. First one there were players range from level 16 to 200, everyone took one shot and let others do the same, everyone got to loot a three star manager. The second one with five players range from level 150 to 400, the level 150 guy would rush to kill the manager with one shot every single time, even before they morph into legendary. It was just dumb as F. Good thing is the higher level guys didn‚Äôt care too much. Looked like they were there to farm steel like myself.
---
Yea. They could use a little love, same with pistols. I made a shotgun/pistol build, little underwhelming. Its a junkies build, been thinking about switching to bloodied just so i dont have to completely rework my build. I think a 15-20% buff would be sufficient enough to make them useful again.
---
I'd just like to get away from the endless trees, bushes and countryside. As great as the map is, it'd be swell to switch it up to something more industrial with a grittier tone and aesthetic.
---
Honestly its good info but is dude a reporter or is it like some anchorman cosplay or whats happening right now?
---
&gt;Edit: thank you for the mature and well-articulated response, though, sincerely. A pleasant change from the typical name calling that both sides of the aisle normally resorts to
---
No problem. Thank you to you as well.
---
Just prime it, prime 12 GA is beneficial to craft especially with 2 ammosmith and 3 Super Duper. Then you get a damage boost, and a damage boost to scorch. I've primed my bloodied pump and combat, and enforcer makes it slightly useful.
---
Neat, but do you mean by "*A legendary Power Armor set with a stealth buff. I want you to think about that a little.*" in Strangler section?   
---
Been using it for a while, but I certainly haven't noticed any stealth buff... And you can't put Stealthboy torso on Ultracite, so there's that.
---
Sorry, ultimate brain fart.
---
I still don't like the cost tho.
---
The M1 Garand was in New Vegas
---
I would prefer that as well.
---
But they are so clean? So pristine....so.... I like the way you think
---
Yesterday I applied Insulated mod on small backpack and it gave 90 ER, and applied Lead Lined on another small backpack and it gave 90 RR. It reduced the weight bonus from 30 to 0. I was applying it on level 50 backpacks.

It‚Äôs pretty engaging imho if you do it proper. No one wants to spend that effort tho.
---
For everyone who wants to do it proper:
---
Yup

It sounds like you dropped it and then picked it back up. This would cause the name to reset. Not saying you did, just that it could explain the situation.
---
Shielded Vault Suits
---
Half of this isn‚Äôt true. Heavy combat is by far the best armor and strangler is the only PA worth using.
---
You definitely can.
---
Take it you've probably watched some AvE as well? Love his vidjayos heh
---
Trial and error it was.  It took me about an hour or so to get it right
---
You might be too far away. The last one I was taking down looked like it was getting hit, but very low damage. Switched weapons and it came down fairly easily.
---
It is a Gatling Gun from Survival mode.
---
Were the Mothman Cultists cannibals? I thought the ones who became cannibals were from the splinter Interloper followers? 
---
Honestly I think the cultist storyline is the one I'm most intrigued by right now. Since Fallout 3 I have enjoyed the creepier, lovecraftian stuff. It's a really interesting thing to bring into the post apocalypse wasteland and broke the old Fallout and Fallout 2 routine of bands of raiders and mercenaries. It helps make the series feel unique in that regard.
---
Yup! Do you remember how scary glowing ghouls used to be before you were properly tooled up?
---
I caught that as well. Foundation has some interesting implications if it's drawing from the same themes as the Foundation Series of books. In Foundation, a group of scientists and mathematicians split off from a galactic empire to ensure their culture and history survives and endures. I'm probably over thinking things but hell, what else are we going to do until the update launches!
---
The point is I have never seen any codeword.
---
Are you sure the ‚Äú#1 spot‚Äù is still a buildable area? Isn‚Äôt that the location of Vault 79?
---
I hope so. As much as I enjoy the BoS I kind of feel their overall story is done for now. It'd be quite refreshing to have a new story in the Fallout series with them. And without the Brotherhood around, an unchecked Enclave becomes pretty fearsome again.
---
I used a primed Lever Action Rifle against SBQ many times.  It works; however, I agree it is sub-optimal.  The DPS is the issue.  I am looking for something that can do more damage than the lever action.
---
Hanukkah would work so well as a video game event. The whole premise of the holiday itself. 5 separate days of gifts, preparing food, playing games and doing like stupid stuff for fun like how Meat Week had you just play some drums for fun. I could totally see a dreidel game between 4 people go down. And you don't really do anything your character just sits there playing dreidel. I mean hell for Easter they could do an Easter egg hunt event. Make it like Monster Mash, light PVP event where you don't lose junk or anything but you collect eggs hidden and can lose them by dying? Maybe not even a PVP event but a competitive event with OP waves of enemies trying to kill everyone to make them lose their Easter eggs. Being a part of the event always should drop XP and loot but actually winning gives a rare, or having a lot of Easter eggs awards a rare loot drop. They could add a crap ton of events based off of Holidays that I think people would love.
---
One of the few times when the holiday and the Cannibalism perk overlap. OH HAPPY DAY!
---
Doesn't the Thorn armor have a stealth buff?
---
Eta: I think the author got confused on this one.
---
How do you all get rid of your old low level small backpacks. I tried to ditch mine and it just gets recalled to my stash.
---
leveling to 15 is a joke
---
and you could ahve bought it again
---
Well both are fine. Furious for boss fights, Exacutioner for everyday use.
---
Oh yeah.
---
The Power Armor guys are most likely the Enclave's Secret Service (based on the leaked Secret Service PA and earpieces) agents [start of speculation] sent from the Oil Rig to investigate what happened in the Whitespring Bunker.
---
What is your weapon like I‚Äôm a sneaky shotgunner with no issues after the SB lands I get close and only takes a couple of shots for it to be down. 
---
My main tough enemy shotgun is a furious combat shotgun with 10% more damage while aiming and (useless) faster reload.
---
I want to stand in the center and see if I'm able to endure the firestorm, again and again and again
---
Enclave armor, coupled with rad resist legendary effects, is a little better compared to heavy combat armor in terms of straight DR. It has nearly 20 points of extra DR at the cost of 20 ER. 
---
T51 with Emergency Protocols is my go-to for PA. Never had a chance to really check out Strangler.
---
But how can people play the game enough to get to the point they can one shot legendaries without noticing that you can't loot corpses you didn't shoot?
---
They should be fine with things that the game gives them at the beginning, even if they straight suck
---
Oh man that was so gross, great movie though haha.
---
Oh then u don‚Äôt know my friend..üòÇ
---
‚ÄúGive me back my friend!‚Äù
---
I just tested it after that person mentioned it - looks like Forest Scout pieces there is no option to switch once you've fixed the glitch.
---
But a couple of pieces of Urban scout I pulled out of my stash do have 2 "No Paint" options. The bottom one switches the armor itself but not in the workbench display. I noticed it when wearing an Urban scout chest and switching back and forth. Once you exit out of the workbench and put the armor on it has Forest print. Going back in to the workbench shows it as having Forest also. I only had 2 pieces of urban to test it on and 10 different Forest pieces. Both urban it works, none of the forest pieces I have give me an option.
---
TLDR; Urban pieces let you switch between forest/urban prints, forest pieces do not
---
OMG Thank you! I really needed that. I'm taking a beating today lol!
---
So did I. All of the pieces I was wearing are Forest so they dont have the option, but I just pulled out a couple Urban pieces and they do let you switch back and forth although it doesnt update in the workbench unless you exit out and go back in.
---
You are legend man thank you so much for this test because I don't have any scout pieces myself
---
I am lower level still ... Every weapon inget sucks .. I like my handmaden 5.56 mod'ed, hunting .308 mod'ed and my ledendary 10mm. Even my 50 Cal is lame cause I can't find mods. I wouldn't use shotguns if I didn't have so damn much ammo... I only craft 308 or 5.56 cause they do damage... I hope it gets better after level 30 üòÅ
---
Special bubble gums are slowing things by only 5%,that's why I avoid it. I tried to play with herbivore but I didn't liked it. Meat is more common to find to me.

What's the third effect?

Sorry... I'm that guy.  When the Queen lands, out comes the executioners or AA auto grenade launcher, friendly fire be damned, get out of the blast zone or have some good armour/perks.
---
As someone with a camp on ‚Äúthe flower‚Äù (SE of top of the world) I have to say this spot must be in the top 10 because it‚Äôs taken at least half the time.  Nice view, a stream below with an acid vent (that I didn‚Äôt know was there when I placed the camp).  Of my 5 characters this is the only camp I haven‚Äôt moved after settling in because I got it right the first time.
---
My other two perm-camps are the monorail tower as mentioned in the article and the waterfall near the crashed plane in the mire.  My other two characters are still searching for their forever home.
---
Yeah. The "army helmet" is very much more modern military. 
---
I happen to have the free states bundle and the "free states revolutionary helmet" is more like the old style helmets. 
---
It is similar if not identical to the"armored raider skull has mask" one.
---
Both are straight at the bottom as opposed to the army one having "ear flaps"
---
If you guys are both noobs just go thru the game together instead of asking to get a full set of armour. Much more fun leveling with someone with all your armour broken and your out of screws trying to figure it out
---
Very nice!
---
I did this with my other friend we still don‚Äôt have armor but we are already lvl 22 just a help for him
---
He is going to outgrow level 1 armour so quickly theres no point in crafting a set. Unless you get decent legendary armour I wouldn't even repair it and just wait till you find more
---
Shotguns are only used to cripple limbs. They dont do anything else it's basically a taser now
---
Nice idea but it'd require community managers that actually engage with its community
---
Okay thanks for your tips
---
Wingo!
---
Now if I could just glitch my heavy combat chest to look like the Forest scout while keeping the better defense :/
---
Have to check later. Out of the house for Thanksgiving.
---
The nerf of them*
---
I'm afraid there is no way I can place it in the spot I want, everywhere is red. I tried. I'll try again this evening, but I don't have my hopes high... anyway, time to find a new spot.

After that you are a wizard aveonyxüòÇ

Ive been lucky to not experience this bug. Closest to this bug i used to get was that every now and then, while in a party, one person would be muted and would have to close out the game and come back.
---
You could see them trying to talk since their name would come up on screen like they were saying something but no one would hear rhem in public or in party.
---
&gt;This year, we‚Äôre grateful for all of you who continue to play Fallout 76
---
And you should be given how you've treated your community.
---
strangler has all the mods of ultracite, so yes it has emergency protocols.
---
How much do  you sell them for?
---
No problem. Not trying to be mean or anything, but you'll find non legendary stuff all over the place and it generally isnt worth the screws and adhesive to repair or craft non legendary armour
---
I started a year ago but remember hesitantly moving south out of the vault towards the first marker, the Overseers camp. I had just a machete and the vault suit. By the time you make it to the camp, after slicing up the scorched along the way, you can make metal armor.

No it‚Äôs all good we are all noobs our biggest problem is we never have stimpacks u maybe have a tip for it too ?
---
Not remove, but change.  Nobody is decrypting them properly, but it also can't be as easy as it is.  Maybe you need 8 silo pieces, you can get them from friends, and that just becomes the code.
---
Oh I didnt know that
---
Has he gotten the card from the card packs?
---
But no stealthboy.
---
That will come with perk cards later on. At level 32 you can get perks that make you not lose mutations and make your mutations less harmful to you, so you'll be able to get one called healing factor that makes your hp go up real quick if you arent in combat. 
---
Personally I combine my stims with water to make diluted stims. 1 stim turns into 4 (sometimes 8) diluted stims if you use chemist perk and super duper 3
---
Oh the perks so many options.. I think I play to lvl 50 first and then I look up a guide for food buildsetc
---
Do you have saved level before that? I mean level that you didn't use the special point to pick perk cards?
---
Do you have points placed in luck? Cards also unlock when using their special tree.
---
Yeah, that aligns with my experience.
---
Nope
---
A friend of mine in the reserves brings me MREs quite often and sometimes they're fucking delicious not gonna lie and fill you all the way up
---
People assuming that you were showing out obviously didnt pay attention to the low level guys on your team you were helping. A griefer is a griefer, level 30 or 400.
---
Yeah he has 2 spare perk points ready to spend on the card.
---
Yeah, that's what I'm saying, they are in there, I promise, I just used them yesterday. There are 3 half walls in the red barn. There is the 1) full (no window) 2) wide window (with broken glass) and 3) small window with (with broken glass). They aren't in the large wall section, just the half wall.
---
He has 4 points in luck. Can you expand on what you mean with the tree thing?
---
Haha yep! Lets upvote this thread.
---
Why deleted?
---
What a shit article.
---
**nice hiss**
---
I'm logging in right now just to see if you're right :D
---
this is fire
---
Can't bank perks like that I'm afraid. It'll only show you the perks available at the level you started saving them.
---
Stealthboys are for losers
---
That I didn't buy this game and just had a friend share his account
---
Yeah I get that a lot when someone tries to initiate PVP but doesn‚Äôt come prepared for me to go stealth.
---
So if he spends his 2 points, the starched genes perk will appear?!
---
As u/hoonface said, you can't bank ponts and perks like that until after level 50. So he has to use the spare points until the actual level 30 comes.
---
Yes in the menu you can change your character
---
Did you forget there's 3 silos? Lol jk know triples are tough...
---
So if he just reached L30 -and- has two points to spend, he‚Äôs going to need to spend one of those points on something else first and then starched genes will appear.
---
If he wants two levels of SG, he‚Äôll then need to get to L31.
---
No I mean like keep my characters  perks and change it without making a brand new player sorry I didn‚Äôt specify
---
On his second point it should.
---
that i have the pleasure of playing this game, every day :)
---
I mean that as well my man. Log into the character, go to menu, press change character or character and you can change it üòÅ
---
I believe there's a base AP on Lasers since a few patches ago, I'll see if I can film it swapping between the two at the SBQ fight, it's quite a substantial difference.
---
Another strange thing is, I had an Ultracite Gatling Laser with almost the exact same stats, but the non-ultracite did way more damage pr. second, even though the numbers were higher on the ultracite. Same fire rate.
---
Omg why couldn‚Äôt you have done this 250 levels ago. Even now I find it quite intense and don‚Äôt launch very many. Great idea for lower levels that play solo or just want to get that mission done.
---
Our ancestors lured a bunch of natives to their slaughter so we can celebrate this glorious day.
---
thankful for not being in the US
---
For most people, they're quite tough. And even my first few times, it was tough. 
---
But now, for me and my very selective crew, we have a specific technique we use that allows us to speedrun them!
---
Thank you! 
---
In One Violent Night so many times I've had one guy go off on his own or sneak off and wait at the spawn point for the boss and just one-shot 'em. Seriously, what about everybody else??
---
Ok thank you for helping
---
No problem üòÅü§üüèº
---
Embrace them, feel the fallout experience.
---
I only experienced the fast travel bug though, it's annoying but hey, could be so much worse.
---
cant wait
---
I'm only a level 73, but me and my team's technique is flawless. We can make the job really easy!
---
Everyday.
---
Dunno, getting a bit tired of Watoga farming robot kills for challenges. Maybe a new thing will be nice.
---
I‚Äôm tempted to add you, just to get you to constantly nuke the SBQ. Well done guys absolutely love the idea.
---
In all honesty the game devs that motor on through the shitstorm of immature privelaged whiners that continue their tantrums about games they no longer play.
---
Not easy to ignore it anymore but regardless I still totally enjoy the time I spend in FO76.
---
&gt;I hope that Bethesda doesn't overdo it with new large open underground spaces.
---
I hope they do. An RPG can always use more dungeons.
---
This would be awesome for xbox
---
Stealth commando is the meta for pvp
---
Thank you! We even provide discounts to loyal customers! They get discounts of up to 50% off!
---
Really??? How so?
---
If I had an xbox, I'd definitely provide the service
---
I hate switching perks out.  For some reason it really bugs me.  I prefer FO4‚Äôs special system much better.  
---
Same with Bobbleheads and Magazines.  I got enough to for achievements and was done with them after that.
---
bloodied LMG commando. Once you try you never go back..
---
Was wondering what to do with the tokens I've been getting now that I got the Fuzzy outfit and head. What's the going rate for tokens?
---
Cheers all. I get it now lol.
---
Any railway is good!!
---
Fallout 2 had cultists in the form of hubologists.
---
OMG 250 is way to cheap as it is, don‚Äôt offer discount.
---
It's so easy for us, 250 isn't that bad. Plus, it seemed like it'd bring in more customers. The cheaper, the more people that want in!
---
Automatic Teslas get commando perks
---
I know that and I want to have a variety of ammo I.e 5.56, fusion cell, .45, and if I can plasma cartridges. Is the Tesla good for pvp?
---
I have a feeling lots of players will take you up on it.  I can‚Äôt be the only one who hates launching nukes.
---
The Railway Rifle is great. Personal fav  weapon from FO4.
---
Its what everyone uses. Like AA ffr and J ffr work really well . handmade and sentinel assassin armor.
---
And tesla for no skill kills. 
---
I use an AAE handmade plus sent assassin armor. Get yourself some stealth boys and some berry mentats and your golden ha
---
My two shot auto handmade does more damage but the AA is better
---
For whatever crazy reason, there is no actual plan for creating Wood Armor.
---
They'll be fine with anything they scavenge, though.
---
that we got raids and the only thing i need to do is kill ants now, and for solar set being strong for full hp builds.
---
In terms of the fast travel bug I used it get it a lot but haven‚Äôt got it once in several months now, so it‚Äôs weird you‚Äôre getting it again!
---
Primed Gatling lasers. They are great damage and only takes 1 violet flux and one fusion core to craft 3000-6000 rounds.
---
Plus it just looks incredibly cool seeing a bunch of dudes in power armor hammering her with streams of laser fire.
---
Yea Tesla are meta
---
You could argue this is sort of what they do with the Around Appalachia feature.  Inside the Vault really should remain a development newsletter.
---
The crowd wants it easier given how the game currently works.
---
However if they instanced the code to each character and removed the need to decipher it using outside-of-game utilities and waiting half a week before you can even get a code then I wouldn‚Äôt mind that.
---
Making a new character and leveling to 15 and going to Watoga for a chance for it to be at the vendors then server hopping was a pain. 
---
It was much easier to make 2k caps and just buy it.
---
If they want option 2, they will have to provide 30 circuitry and 40 steel. If I'm the only one, I'll open the security door by myself. Otherwise they gotta provide a little help, ya know?
---
Thank you! üòä
---
Sb and tesla is meta always have one around if u wish to be pvp bc your opponent is most likely gonna use it.
---
When you do a first play through it makes sense to find the pieces(part of the adventure) but having played the game since launch I like to cut to the chase and have the full code. I say they just leave it...
---
What update tho
---
Edit: I found it
---
i remember the handmade gun plan being crazy expensive during the tse handmade meta
---
more than 2k caps for sure
---
(SPOILERS)
---
According to datamines, ‚ÄòFoundation‚Äô is the name of the settlement that will be built on the current location of Anchor Farm, so that is very likely the name of the settler faction!
---
I love mine, most people don‚Äôt ever bother with one. My hopes are that they adjust or add support cards for the syringer to make these types of weapons worthy for more endgame use
---
This is good advice.  Thank you.
---
Bruh
---
Yeah, well, it's still an issue if you're in an event that *needs* the big guns, like Scorched Earth.
---
Yes, I feel bad about one-shotting the 3\* Legendary in those.  I don't mean to do it.  But I also really can't stop myself once the swing has been committed. :(
---
Sadness :(
---
Was easy to find on the marketplace. Especially when there was two. I sold quite a few myself.
---
I play solo and if I‚Äôd just had someone in there to show me where to go and what to do, well I‚Äôd of payed lots of caps for that.
---
They got the fanboys hooked into Todds ass again for some time üòÇ
---
Well, you've got the opportunity now! Just let me know when and if you want to do it!
---
Same here
---
Oh, of course! The "Destroy Robots with \[x\]" challenges are sending me into a loop of nightmares and stress, but the location itself is pretty nice!
---
Privileged? Has Bethesda's idea of a quality game gotten so ingrained in your head that FO76 seems like a substantial or any way polished game to you? It's a fucking mess mate, sorry if you see every hater as a whiny, privileged child just because they expected the game to be remotely fun to play and have some level of quality control. Go play the Outer Worlds and you'll realise just how terrible and lackluster FO76 actually is once you've taken off your fanboy goggles...
---
Maybe they are laying the "foundation" to rebuild the wasteland
---
You guys completely made my day.
---
If no one takes you up on the offer then I definitely will. It takes me about 30 minutes as I can never find one of those card things.
---
I agree with that guy. Some low low levels got picked on by medium levels, low asked high for help now high level kicks medium levels ass. Serves them right
---
I've believe it's both for containers.
---
I think it's 180 containers to reset previously looted ones, but I've also found loot in the same container after a 20 hour delay without having done 180 before checking it again. I have toons that just do "rounds" for specific items that never get close to hitting up 180 containers, but can get loot from the same container on a daily basis.
---
I agree.  I think the current game walked on pins and needles to incorporate the BoS as it was.  The remnants of the Secret Service, though?  That could work.  There's precedent in Frank Horrigan.
---
Technically you are correct, but people use the term interchangeably (even though it's wrong)
---
I have a dozen right now, if you don't want to take the time
---
It's been a month already, the whole hate on fallout 1st members has died out. It just gave people something to do for 2 weeks.
---
In some cases, the safest and easiest thing to do is create new space either underground in in buildings, because, silly us, we put our CAMPs all over the place.
---
It is kind of funny how often the "underground forest" trope shows up in this game, though.  It's a lovely theme, don't get me wrong.
---
The option you're looking for is "Change Appearance," which you can find in the Map screen's menu.
---
Upvoted you because you are not wrong.
---
Wouldnt mind doing a xbox branch or pc with your company name or something like that eventually, just started on xbox but this type of service sounds awesome!
---
Did you even read what Ir1shguy posted?
---
IRL turkey is gonna make ours! It's cookin' right now!
---
The furious reduced weight one is the better of the 2. Best to use on the big targets and the SBQ
---
I initially didn't realize it was from Wastelanders (Somehow I thought it was "Around Appalachia.")  
---
Saw the church and thought "How the Hell did I miss that?!"
---
This :)
---
I have a lot of keycards it‚Äôs the card you need to scan yourself. It takes me forever to find one.
---
Thx! It is. Still can't believe it.
---
Oh, I can help with that! I'll let you know where one is every time
---
The costume!! Thanks :D
---
Yeah i feel ya, keep it up!
---
Ouch, sorry to hear that!
---
Maybe i can help out... Let me know your platform.
---
Good lord!! I mean the wasteland makes lonely but not that lmao
---
It's ok, this is a safe space, we won't judge you here
---
Or we could not and let this game die already
---
Thought about that too.
---
But i guess it's sort of payback time for me now, so i might put them in my vending for free and let fate decide.
---
Could I get a link for that? I can't seem to find it anywhere
---
Also a nice catch lol saved you some grinding!
---
Furious FFR Handmade, Combat Rifle or Fixer would be pretty good for the SBQ.
---
Is the uniform itself rare? Not particularly. You usually get it from the main quest via Final Departure at Morgantown Airport. Is it rare for the uniform to drop specifically from the Back on the Beat event? I would say, yes, rare enough. Not as exceedingly rare as the Responder fireman uniform from Forest region events, though.
---
Happy genoci... eh i mean Thanksgiving!
---
Bit late but i leave you a wave and heart emote! Happy Thanksgiving :)
---
So Turkey stuffing?
---
Just go to Nexus mods and run searches using the keyword 'Fallout 76'. That will likely bring up a bunch of mods related to this game.
---
As far as making the experience feel like 76, good luck. There are probably little tweaks you can make but, at least for me, 76 is all about the world. Appalachia makes this game shine and in FO4 you'll still be stuck with the Commonwealth.
---
I will offer this advice though, if you're open to something that isn't just making 76 in FO4: Get the mod Horizon, a grass/tree overhaul that makes the world more green and overgrown, and you'll have an entirely new experience with built-in survival mechanics. I played FO4 for over 1000 hours and like 80% of that was spent playing Horizon. In many ways it makes the game what the Fallout series should be.
---
This is the page I found when searching where to get the base plan:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Tesla_rifle
---
When I went to buy it recently I had apparently already bought it and forgot about it. I just learned the automatic mod by crafting and scrapping them several days ago. I was fortunate and it didn't take that many. As far as I know this is the only way to learn it.
---
Huh, I should use some of the 200+ supply drop tapes I have.
---
I'm number 4.   All you latecomers are newbies.   .grin.
---
Unless you are running Whitesprings with Endorcer.  Then it's a choice weapon to cripple ghouls.
---
Yum yum! Enjoy!
---
How dare you use that free states flair when you so obviously hate the game and its creators.
---
--close
---
Good Work!
---
I have 80 damn tokens so far‚Ä¶
---
3 of them, "grinded" one year ago.
---
77, randomly found in vendors‚Ä¶
---
I mean, lore wise (Eddie Winter in Fallout 4) it should be possible to be a ghoul, without getting a nuke dropped near you.
---
Well i just killed the SBQ and got a 1* executioners handmade üòê
---
They might notice it, but not care about the fact that it applies to others as well.
---
It could be a technical limitation to some extent, as the new content was said to rely heavily on instancing (like in Vault 94, but hopefully better optimized by Wastelanders) to allow for implementing choices and consequences, but instanced areas might have to be of the "interior" type and separated from the rest of the world by a loading screen.
---
Or even better, scorched in power armor!
---
It could have been a ghoul slayers gamma gun or a furious Black powder weapon.
---
Thank you.
---
Or a 1* nocturnal 10mm pistol üòÇ
---
 Since when do i need your permission ?
---
Yeah. Happened last night. I grinded it for the legendarys. Another guy shows up and we both make sure that we get at least one shot on each mob. Then a few more show up, play the instruments... I was standing at one corner of the building, I didn't even make it to the other side before the boss was dead. :(
---
Yeah I normally keep for the SBQ and sheepsquash!
---
Enclave. Mmogfails leaked it a while ago.
---
Thanks for an actually useful update.
---
Keep them coming.
---
So this is how cannibalism started in the Fallout universe. Interesting.
---
Iirc one of the dataminers commented about it a while ago and I seen it mentioned since. Not sure if Riflegamimg has covered it also??
---
I kind of dig the new look, I thought FO4 was so full of gritty cities and streets that all look exactly the same
---
Players have already started a cannibal cult faction: [EATT - Establishment of Appalachian Taste Testers](https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/10/18537120/fallout-76-cannibals-eatt-guild-role-play-bethesda-perk).
---
I make them all and sell them, all. I run bird bones, marsupial, healing factor, grounded, speed demon and eagle eyes.
---
Be a cool addition to a groups circuit of events
---
Link?
---
I mostly agree with you, but there is an important caveat. In ESO, you have to pay for story DLC. In 76, that's not the case. Wastelanders looks to be the size of a 20-30 dollar DLC. 1st is how they're gonna make their money back giving that away for free.
---
I don‚Äôt have one right now, but I‚Äôll jog over to Fort Defiance and grab one for ya.
---
This is an interesting thing, I like it. I reckon we will be doing business.
---
Who taught you to shoot them with shotguns after they land? 
---
You only use the shotguns for landing the sb and then you switch to automatic weapons or melee to fuck them up.
---
Atoms should appear after your first cycle is up.  What is the next outfit?
---
And this works for strictly farming this event but a lot of people that play together like to be on the same server all the time. This method also leaves little time to clear out the robots before starting the event. Plus, idk about you but for me, the less load screens the better lol
---
I'm hyped
---
Anti Armor is another good prefix for her, and FFR is preferable because she‚Äôs very explosive resistant.
---
That bit about info in the New Year sure makes it sound like a March release or later.
---
I really hope it's gonna be worth the wait.
---
+1. This is what I expect from an ITV article. 
---
Good job and keep it coming.
---
No idea we are suppose to get 1 new outfit each month.
---
Yeah, you're right. Instead of seeing it as an 'expanding the lore on an item you bought' they're all just seeing it as 'paywall quests' which isn't the angle at all. \*facepalms\*
---
Sweet, added you!
---
Some amount of "padding" is probably needed at the edges, so that the world does not just suddenly end, and you can still see landscape outside the borders of the playable area. Which is of course not to say it cannot be expanded later.
---
I disagree with the second statement. While Strangler seems to be the best, I hear it is far too rare and buggy to use while the Ultracite armor exists.
---
I thought something was wrong with my controller. Good to know it's a universal problem.
---
they could be considered pipe weapons couldn't they?
---
I have never once gotten a possum badge from the quests. :( I keep trying....
---
Since you started acting like a conflicted baby online. Guess things aren't that hot IRL right now huh? So you take out your frustration on some people enjoying a game.. On a subreddit for that game. Heck this game is great. And if wastelanders lives up to its expectations I may even consider it the best game I have ever played. No other game have given me this much entertainment, I still haven't left the groundbreaker in OW because I keep thinking how much I would rather be in Appalachia. And I'm getting sick and tired of people coming to this subreddit just to belittle every single fan who dare share their excitement for this game. And no I'm not a shill or a brown nosing fan boy I'm just sick of you and people like you.
---
That's when i run my bloodied meat hook char and just help take down the queen and let the other less powerful players help do the queen and mob control. I really just do the queen for the legendary drops and to push my build to the limits, where I can do 30k or more Dmg to the queen and not one hit it. Only time I swing at other legendary there is if they're on me,for survivability because that build is veeery squishy
---
People have said the Skin/Paint for the Ranger Armour is this months free thing.
---
Not a clue myself, sorry.
---
Yes! I love my syringer and use it often. 
---
I would live a 2 shot one
---
That legendary effect is OP as fuck. Seriously, it does 10 damage a second for like 5 seconds I believe, with it stacking. That means you‚Äôre doing 50 extra damage per shot that doesn‚Äôt count for the damage cap. If you know someone with a set, have them shoot you a bunch and then shoot them back with the acid stacked on you if you don‚Äôt believe me.
---
Guess it was more luck than work in the end lol
---
Since 3 tokens a day is a real pain i keep my fingers crossed you'll find more soon!
---
Well just say a vendor of a guy named Zippydagain had a lvl 50 one up for sale 1500 caps on PS4
---
It needs sight options as well, if nothing else just a reflex sight.
---
15 drinks and 5-7 edible are pretty light, water is easily produced at your own camp and food is everywhere, just keep farming and don't worry about it. Or hey you can choose not to eat unless the negative effects kick off.
---
Are you using the Purveyor at all? Remember there's 25% of untill 3.dec
---
O ok well if that's true that's sad. But I still havent got my atoms.
---
Don't care if they are taking their time, as long as they get it right. This shows promise.
---
Pretty sure you can but you cant put a skin on it
---
I agree but the point is, it is a hard to get armor and apparently increases overall crashing for the people on the server.
---
I think its going to be mid to late February. I believe they want to roll it out sooner rather then later because theres already been a big gap in end game content for awhile now. Seasonal events add temporary gameplay but it needs some more permanent stuff to keep the lights on so to speak.
---
Serums are typically under 1k in my platform, what platform are you on?
---
Nuka World had hubologists as well.
---
I'm just talking about the SPECIAL stats as a tree. I know that when I reached level 30, I got lucky and got both from perk packs. Another character I had required me to put points into luck until those perks showed up.
---
I don‚Äôt think they ever said we‚Äôd get a free outfit every month, but they did mention we‚Äôd get some atom store items on sale monthly.  I do think we will likely get another variant/skin in December, but I don‚Äôt think they ever promised it,..or I missed it. ü§î
---
Nearly completely negated by poison resist armor, stacked. 
---
I digress, this is also probably unfair to you.
---
Lol IKR but he is proving my point.
---
I have yes even when I cash in my weapons for scrip I usually get something trash like a laser weapon which are still completely broken. I had a 2 shot ultrcite laser pistol and it still took 2 shots to kill a lever 2 bloodbug.
---
In terms of DR and ER, a mix of metal and leather can be better than a full set of combat armor. Although a few points of resistance does not matter much once it is already high enough.
---
I'd judge me! Nah... I keep waiting till wastelanders might send a nice girl which likes long walks in the mire or killing a scorchbeast at moonshine.
---
...guess that's called Wasteland Romantic
---
True I might be wrong about the outfit. but did anyone get there atoms yet?
---
Hmmm I like the sound of them coming to investigate from the Rig, that kinda connectivity would be cool for the story
---
You must be very inlucky guy, I've already had more than 100+ possum badges from those dailies.
---
I think the Executioner‚Äôs is better due to the FFR.  Furious is a better prefix, but not by *that* much.
---
It‚Äôs hard to get, because it‚Äôs the best power armor. Also crashing is from several people stacking acid on other people. It‚Äôs rare that it‚Äôs done non-intentionally and if it isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs usually at the queen.
---
True, unfortunately. It‚Äôs a buggy set of armor that seems to cause crashes fairly often. I have a few friends with full sets who don‚Äôt use them beyond short encounters in PVE or PVP. Large events spell doom for many players - the risk of disconnecting is large.
---
I did. Bought Blackbird paint with them.  Or I‚Äôm pretty sure I got them.
---
I am on PC; you?  It makes me sad....
---
I got my atoms on the 23rd, 30 days after I subscribed. Mid morning-ish.
---
I'd recommend you only go after 2 stars, 3 stars are overkill unless you're going after endgame weapons.
---
With 999 scrip you can almost get 30 weapons that way
---
wavy willards and blackwater mine - is it enemies in there that drop shells?  or those areas yield the mats to craft shells?  
---
Just curious, I have 2 characters that have an alternate shotgun setup I use from time to time to change it up.  I'm not starving for ammo as both characters main other weapons most of the time but I've never heard of these spots as good ammo spots.
---
The mobs drop lots of shells.
---
Make sure you do the whole mine, including inside. A couple server jumps at both and you can net plenty of shells.
---
Okay thanks, I'll try that later when I log on. I was going for 3 stars in just hope for something really good would come out of it.
---
Yes, however that effect is broken and if I remember correctly hasn‚Äôt been fixed. Even if it is though, my main point wasn‚Äôt it‚Äôs use in PvP, as well as the fact that you would have to get all the pieces of armor yourself, because 25+ poison resist pieces are thrown away for ap refresh.
---
I agree it needs to be triggerable , but that system does work to at least locate the event.
---
Which atoms when you first sign up you get atoms. And each month you get atoms?
---
I run junkies mainly for PvP and PvP tournaments. I use a JE LMG and if we are using no VATs I use the T51B if VATs is used, I use X01 with stealthboy chest. One Gun army with explosive will stagger people in chameleon and sentinel giving you the opportunity to VATs them if they are chameleon jumping.
---
I still can get 250-300 damage with a FFR Junkies .50 cal with drugs and adrenaline.
---
what are you hoping for (build), and what system are you on?
---
I hope the Secret Service are who MODUS was trying to contact. He isn't able to establish a connection with Poseidon Oil Rig or Raven Rock, but having the Secret Service in hiding certainly makes sense to me. The power armor we see briefly in the trailer looks a little chunkier than normal, the Frank Horrigan connection might be on the money there.
---
I'm on PC too, but it doesn't matter - every daily and Campfire tales has 25% chance to award you with a badge. Pure RNG.
---
thanks, been trying for hours to find a pink one but it's just not happening for me
---
If you actually used your own head and played the game instead of regurgitating other peoples bile from google you would realize it cannot be compared to The Outer Worlds, and it is not a mess "mate" it is just not the online FO4 that the real fanbois wanted and would not settle for anything less.
---
My Bethesda fanboi library consists of FO76, Doom, and ESO as well as a couple of games only published by them but not developed by their games studios. So good job, I guess, on ASSuming I am a fanboi.
---
This was the second set of atoms
---
You can. I tried Aktos Pharma and it works.
---
February is my bet as well. Fasnact could even be the last event in the lead up to it. One last regular Fasnact Parade before the world becomes populated again.
---
It seems like you need to revise your build. But also just find a legendary farming route and run it over and over, do scorched earth and encryptid events. Turn that pistol into a auto rifle and run The proper build. Even a lvl 35 what ever bloodied 1star weapon without the proper build can be very strong
---
They do have that aesthetic to it plus they had that Vox Syringer quest and Rose‚Äôs quest focus on them 
---
They most have something sneaky planed (I hope)
---
They‚Äôve fixed it. I run a mixed set of Unyielding Forest Scout Armor. Two pieces of poison resist, and two AP refresh and one rad resist. I‚Äôm only using poison resist as that‚Äôs all I have been able to encounter thus far, but the effects do stack against acid damage. 
---
Previously, armors marked ‚Äúpoison resist‚Äù before the fix were relabeled ‚Äúrad resist,‚Äù if I remember correctly. Armors that drop with poison resist function properly now. 
---
It‚Äôs extremely worth it against Mirelurks, and other players in PVP, if you can manage the slower AP refresh. The rad resist is a nice little bonus coupled with lead-lined armor as the effects are definitely noticeable when someone attempts rad damage against you.
---
No problem. It may take me a few months because it‚Äôs the second rarest asylum outfit, but I‚Äôll def hit you up once I get it.
---
Sooo what's your profit? Just helping others? 250 caps is obviosly a negligible fee.
---
Excuse my language but FUCKING YES!  This is exactly what I needed to keep my hype up!  I really look forward to seeing more screenshots and teases.  I am very curious about the sub-factions in addition to the two main factions.  Seeing cultists around definitely reminds me of those tribals from Point Lookout.  Also very eager to see all the new weapons.  I hope there are a ton of new stuff to expand my arsenal with.
---
Hmm I tried an atom shop skin for my low lvl and it didnt have the option.
---
The silos are so easy for me, i figured I'd help people out for cheap. Minor profit, large destruction!
---
Thanks for sharing the link, I would have been looking for it foreverüëçüëç
---
Soooo cuuuuute
---
Sad the amount of workarounds we need in this game (not hate, I love fo76)
---
im sure well find something for you :)
---
ill let you know when i get online and add you if you give me your psn name
---
btw if you replie to someone make sure to click the "reply" option under the comment you want to answer, otherwise i dont get a notification üëçüèº
---
i think i have an anti armor ffr combat rifle thats good for basically any build that uses rifles and i can also craft you a good suit of armor so you can rock appalachia with style üòÅ
---
I agree!  Love it and all the quirks
---
I love PvP even in only about two weeks into it, the other day right after sbq my squad got into a 3v4 hour long PvP no one used sbs or teslas. The other team were bloodied sneak builds with bffr railway rifles omg it was hard to vats them, but that's wats exp lasers are for, but soo fun. Just got a full assassin's powered set last night with a few pieces sneak. I do keep a tesla sb and berry mentors just in case the need arises.
---
I didnt get it till well after launch. Typically fanbois that have been disappointed are the ones lashing out at everyone, maybe we are both wrong lol.
---
I would be more inclined to think that insane would be expecting the rest of the world to have your opinion.
---
Isn‚Äôt the Q 25/25  handmade just as popular these days?  Seeing them go for crazy amounts lately.
---
One of the only places in the entire *series* where you can see a pre-war car in pristine condition (the other is Bradberton's Office in Fo4 Nuka-World)
---
Yet You're here expecting the world to share your same opinion that haters are just whiny kids, when clearly not everyone agrees with you...
---
I've tested it against my pal with several poison resist pieces, and yes, they do stack and mitigate it - though if you're bloodied, the poison DoT from certain weapons will eventually eat through.
---
There are some types of trees that still get in the way too. :( I have branches clipping through my home in a location I otherwise love. The bulldozer feature definitely leaves room for improvement.
---
Wish we could get rid of like trees and bushes and shit, I don't even care if we don't get junk out of it I just want things cleared up tbh
---
A downside no matter what, if you‚Äôre running a bloodied build, unfortunately. You‚Äôll always be a glass cannon, no matter how hard you are to kill.
---
I hope so.  Even just the ability to make an acid syringer op with a melting animation....yes!
---
SERVER DISCONNECTED
---
Its a juxtaposition between creation and destruction.
---
Yes, you fucking sack of shit.
---
gj w your explanations
---
Interested to know if you can get everyone in. I tried with 3 others ( 4 man team) to get through but for some reason the vault door would not open for all of us. We tried several times, different servers, private servers, changing team leads etc. but could not get it to allow all 4 of us past the vault door.
---
You are talking about the wrong issue 
---
WHY IS THERE NO 44 BULL BARREL 
---
üòÖ
---
LOL absolutely fuckng not. Like someone else suggested you read nothing about this post. It was asked what we were thankful for and I stated what I was thankful for. You just saw someone to try and rage on. But seriously dude thanks for the laughs. You made my day.
---
Maybe a bug or glitch right now ? Did all 4 of you grab the vault key ? I think everyone needs one on hand to get by the door? 
---
I‚Äôm really not sure to be honest why it won‚Äôt let all 4 of you?
---
Of course. Though you must be first player I've actually seen wearing (or mentioning) those pieces; you're prepared... Neat.
---
No problem, have a good night.
---
I've still never managed to complete it. I've only been online twice when it starts up, and both times there was maybe one other person who bothered showing up so I'd just get bodied by 6 Assaultrons and a swarm of ghouls.
---
Wow. Someone is upset. Don‚Äôt drop shit on the ground idiot.
---
Never had a problem here. Just the occasional flying mannequin and moonwalkers (scorched who just slide along).
---
Don‚Äôt know about anyone else but the purveyor is a waste of time,all I ever get served is 3 star crap I don‚Äôt use lol best legendary I‚Äôve got is an anti armour.45 rifle that I purchased lol
---
Ok... hey I'm gonna start waving flags here any second lol
---
I usually solo it and can keep 2/3 friendly animals alive. 
---
I‚Äôm down for 1-2 players to join and complete it.
---
The game really need stuff like this to bring people together.
---
Definitely some kind of bug. This was about a week ago and, I had a thought to post something about it to see if anyone else is experiencing the same sort of bug. But I didn't because I'm unsure on how to post and wanted to give it another shot on another day which, didn't happen because my crew did not want to try.
---
Lol...Im lvl 113 and haven't finished the main quest line yet. I've been too busy farming every bobble, magazine, rare plan and who's it available. Not to mention just wanderin'. In my spare time I've been cultivating the most profitable yet reasonable vendor store this side of the map. That being said, I play mostly solo but emote like crazy and help out when I can. This idea of yours for me is a no-brainer. I'll be in touch once I figure out how far in the main quest I need to be haha. Im at Belly of the Beast. Capital idea BTW. (PSN is MackDevious.) Willing to pay more than 250 'cuz as some have said, that's uber cheap.
---
Did you mean
---
"A video I made about Fallout 76 a year later"
---
I don‚Äôt even participate in that event anymore,every time I‚Äôve tried I unload absolutely everything and get zero loot from the body. I can‚Äôt physically do anymore damage than I already am ,maybe it‚Äôs bad perks or the bad weapons but either way I‚Äôve tried and bailed now lol
---
I‚Äôm not even into PVP and I do fine with a B/25/25 handmade with no sentinel/assassin armor.
---
It's going to be free to my knowledge
---
also if anyone has the forrest green/red version, hmu!
---
I agree but I still think it should have a server wide notification. I enjoy doing PP but having more people show up makes it a bit easier.
---
I need to do the same. I waste like 1000 5.56 ammo  and break all my weapons. And then I get a 1 Star legendary weapon. It‚Äôs really not worth it.
---
Cant wait for Wastelanders.
---
Thank you, i'll take a look at it. I may like Horizon too. I played FO4 at launch and the vegetation was a little turn off to me.
---
Words cannot describe how hyped i am for the spruce knob cave and watoga underground.
---
Jumbo fuzzies don‚Äôt go into the display case, so there is no reason to get them. Save for the outfit.
---
As much as i would love for this to come to fruition, sadly its not possible with the way the engine is setup.
---
Or furious black powder rifle...
---
Totally agree! The community on the game is one of the best ones imo but something like this would be awesome
---
Your right. It should operate like encrypted or scorched earth. 
---
It's one of my favorite events but theres almost no chance of completing it fully so I pretty much stopped doing it. Getting level 1 and clearing one monster is a fail in my book.
---
Petition to make the queens butt a crit spot
---
I like to try the face, but its easier to die if youre hitting her there.
---
As I said somewhere else, I‚Äôm thankful for a new game I got so I can stop playing this shitty one.
---
Thanks for this m8. Happy Thanksgiving!!
---
Donno what your build bit if you can. I am a rifleman but have a few points in str for carry weight and blocker. I remove those fir 7 in heavy gunner, I remove gunsmith for stabilized and run a Furious ultracite gatling plasma. I do 30-50 per shot and its fires fast. Full health build, it's not insane but I'm a big contributor now when there isnt some crazy bloody build in the group.
---
Would be better coupled with sentinel armor! I can think of a more perfect combination, but these sets are in such high demand.
---
Sneak bloodied build with railway rifle is crazy. I know you said ranged but I easily hit around 30k Dmg to the queens face with bloodied gauntlet build, I run a meathook but deathclaw gauntlet can do tons of Dmg as well. See if you can get into the queen killers r us discord, there's tons of info on there.
---
The consumer chooses what they pay if they pay more. I'll help you with the quests too if you want
---
(Edit) you know, this may be why I've never had more than 3.5K caps at a time, lol. I charge really cheap. I guess I just like helping people too much. I guess it's Time to change my goals
---
Honestly these cultists sound promising. Hoping they‚Äôll have something to do with that weird Cthulhu-like creature in a mine. I don‚Äôt remember what mine it was but I remember there being a laboratory like room, various cult-like decorations, a podium, and a room with the entrance covered in vines with a Cthulhu thingy inside.
---
If/when you have the cost of the subscription back charged be prepared for Bethesda to ban your account.  It's bullshit but they absolutely will do it.  Just wanted to warn you in case you weren't aware.
---
That‚Äôs not the problem. The problem is the 30-35 (I shit you not) level 60 feral ghouls that spawn inside my camp every time I join a server. (My camp is near vault 76)
---
No problem. I'm not sure exactly when they were added, I've used them on and off for a little while now. I'm still discovering new things in the game 900 plus hours in, makes it exciting to know there is always more out there to find.
---
Isn‚Äôt that a scrap heap? You should put a machine down on it and farm it.
---
Moreover the queen is fucked as hell. 5/5 last times didn't drop anything.
---
Looks unoriginal just by the background, so pass
---
Someone posted a while back, including ideas for buffs and nerfs for each faction. Something along the line of Brotherhood member get a buff in energy weapons and resistance, but can't use mutations. That way it kind of goes with that factions style and beliefs. It would be super dope.
---
I'm honestly beginning to think they'll do a NMS
---
Agree, the more new zones the better, don't care where they're placed.
---
Did you install it from your apps menu? I think you have to do that.
---
Most people haven't even gotten a full set of the 1st Raid's armor.
---
Fun fact. This has never happened to me. It doesn't make people like OP (and I'm guessing based on your views here) you any less irredeemably shitty. 
---
How morally bankrupt are you that you're defending this kind of vile behavior dude?
---
Dont envy you having to clean that turkey üòÜ
---
Thanks for insight.  I will look into the shotgun.  So true on the card thing.  I can share almost any set of cards. Real helpful for people under 20 levels.
---
I mean, if they‚Äôre anything like the 94 ‚Äúraids‚Äù, then I don‚Äôt want them.
---
This is hilarious! Love that the turkey was trying to cook the food at the end. Bwahaha!  Thanks for making this and Happy Thanksgiving!
---
Is that the Interloper from Lucky Hole Mine?
---
Yeah I am not too worried about it now but it does nothing to encourage that kind of playing in others. Plus I used to miss a lot of loot.
---
Mostly the same, might not be a lot that'll interest you. A new nuclear winter map in Morgantown which is excellent, and apart from that it may be worth coming back early in the new year to reacquaint yourself with the base game before wastelanders
---
Oh, yeah, im on Xbox, my name is StellsyFox on there, if i dont answer, its more than likely cause im on my PS4 at the time
---
Well, i understand that part of it, but c'mon. Even if most people dont have all of it, you can still have more than 1 raid. At least 2 were promised for the summer, but we only have 1 and its december.
---
This is wicked! I need to level a friend of mine so consider me a customer! I'll probably launch at least once a week, likely more. Psn is Shadow_King153 and I'll be doing one on either Sunday or Monday.
---
Bethesda is not a company you should ever say "just add it, please" to. I want them to take their time, and do things right.
---
they‚Äôre all a single pool now
---
Pretty sure I did
---
All of them.
---
If you're on Xbox can lmk and my team can come to your aid to fend off assholes, I take over workshops but I have standards, I wouldn't mess with you.
---
Aw that sucks
---
Sentinels always are, but I've seen some in vending machines with "undesirable" traits - or at least sellers tend to think of them like that - including poison res, so you might get lucky.
---
Happy Thanksgiving to you as well ü¶ÉüçÅ
---
Understandable, but literally everything for this raid is already implemented (minus the rewards themselves). Even the quest stages are added. Its not asking for a whole new raid, its asking to implement the existing raid that was promised over the summer.
---
They never announced the vault 96 raid to my knowledge, so it‚Äôs probably not coming anytime soon. Not to mention their plate is full with wastelanders. Our next content update is a Christmas event, then wastelanders, however from what I‚Äôve heard, wastelanders is almost finished and could come out early January.
---
Yep, was changed a few months ago. Cant remember exactly when.
---
Womp womp.
---
I'm more concerned about wastelanders personally but I see your point.
---
You get 1400 caps every 20 hours. No matter which vendor you use
---
When does it reset
---
I'll try to help you my username is lightningspider
---
Darn. Is there anyway to sell purified water besides waiting 24 hours for the vendors cap supply to replenish?
---
Woah! :D
---
There are some nice places around the edge of whitesprings.  Some places you can use the robots to your advantage as well.   Be careful of nukes though.
---
20 hours from first time you buy
---
This! I feel slow and crippled without these whenever I start a new toon. Other mutations get sprinkled in depending on build type.
---
20 hours after first purchase
---
Me too, but with wastelanders 3-5 months away we need something new, and this is basically already complete. I love the 94 raids, and opening up the 96 raid can do nothing but good for raid junkies and people looking for more endgame challenges.
---
In theory sure, if you setup a vending machine. The reality of a player buying purified water is probably non-existent though, so unfortunately ya gotta wait for vendor reset.
---
Yeah, they never did a spotlight like with the 94 raids, but to my knowledge almost everything is already implemented. It really wouldnt detract much manpower whatsoever, simply a matter of adding the existing content that hasnt been added yet.
---
No it is not, it's just a junk pile.
---
I heard the break for holidays early and well into early January and not to expect anything until February update going by previous years/games/releases. So of course, I've set my hopes on a March release because I doubt they'll have their shit together in January or February.
---
Me too. On in about an hour poisonblood696
---
Yep. Take a picture before it crashes.
---
B25 Prime Ultracite Gatling laser.
---
But is it 16x
---
Lmao! 
---
Well done, this is the true spirit that makes this game enjoyable, and entertaining. 
---
Keep up the great work, standing ovation. 
---
I wish you, and everyone,
---
A Happy Appalachian Thanks Giving, from my family, to yours. 
---
Cranberry Relish is on the house, this joyest of festive seasons!
---
Thats a weird lookin turkey
---
It completely is there just items placed in the world on the terrain map like trees and rocks that can be removed when the player interacts with them
---
Napalm tank can definitely be bought from vendors, I bought it from one. I can't remember which one though but if you walk through whitesprings you should find it.
---
If I had to guess I'd say it's probably either raiders or free states.
---
Will add you right away!
---
I agree. The Watoga underground looks really interesting.
---
There's a mod for that on PC now.
---
Yeah but in reality both can be suppressed and shotguns suppress really well.
---
It would be doable like fallout 4 ls settlements but they would have to decrease the number of players per server.
---
At the very top of the map where the vault for NW is there a small campsite that's flat and empty on the mountain close to the border best spot on the map imo
---
This is fucking dumb. I love it.
---
I was really hoping on a big sale in the atomic shop to be able to get all the overpriced cool items
---
I built my C.A.M.P up in a tree in the Mire.  Aside from being up in the tree, I have zero defenses, and almost never get paid a visit by any enemies.   Very peaceful.
---
Not so much for trees and vegetation. The Toxic Valley, contains several spots. My fav one there was the junk &amp; lead extractor location. It's on a hill, a few trees, but it was a very peaceful spot. 
---
Travel out there at night, stand on a hill and just look at the landscape.
---
With the music, and the glowing  ground, it's kinda Zen.
---
The entrances already exist in the base game, and have been teasing me to no end. The image makes it look like some kind of burrows-esque dungeon.
---
I love it so far! Keep it coning
---
And in fallout 3 in the Zeta DLC, when you're riding one of the elevators, it stops on a floor and you can see a pristine car though one of the windows.
---
it never crashed on me. Actually I was lucky because I never had any problems with the game or any game breaking bugs or anything else.
---
Its the small things that count. Happy Thanksgiving.
---
You know you've tanked if you're thanking people for playing your game
---
I mean it's pretty good detailed compared to fallout 4 but I don't know if it's really 16 times more details than 4. probably not, there are only more colors in it, and some better textures.
---
Zealots primed ffr handmade
---
I'm a conniving capitalist. I sell marsupial serum at about 1500 caps cause with max bargaining perk you can get it at Whitesprings for 3500. I'm on PC mind you. My bargain vendor shop sells it too but only at 150 caps. My accessible vendor store is sort of my pay wall. All my other serums are only sold at 150 caps on my other store. Doesn't bother me when players take advantage of the mark-up and start sharing. I made decent caps with this decision.
---
He'd probably killed some low level and stole their junk lol that's mean to do but not a bad photo it could've been better without the sliders and settings on
---
Bloodied builds dont like these. My machines are out in the open.
---
amen üôå
---
I agree, I'm thankful for Bethesda for making it, I'm thankful to the tireless developers who thanklessly push on, and the amazing community with members like you! Happy tanks-giving!
---
guess the game can handle someone just going around forest taking pictures.
---
But the game certainly aint bug free for you
---
Thanks!üëç
---
Hopefully they will, the game has a lot of potential to be great, the biggest thing missing is the players
---
Compared to Fallout 4 it looks decent. Compared to other AAA games that have come out in the last 5-10 years.. yeah, not so sure about that.
---
I agree ex/FFR over furious in this situation. Especially if you the auto mod.
---
Obviously you didn't watch the video.
---
The following plans are pure gold:
---
Plan: Plasma Grenade
---
Plan: The Fixer
---
I'm just finished up but add me and maybe give it a go tomorrow or at the weekend? livingisntcheap
---
I buy pure water to flip to the vendor bots on off days. i sell at 5 caps each with hard bargain 3, so I buy as high as 3 based on how far away from vendor cap I expect to be. I collect a ton but still have issues hitting the cap. And believe it or not I did sell some pure water at 2 caps each (I hold it in my vending machine for cheap in case oTh er players follow my same strategy).
---
You to!üëç
---
Great I am on PC, what's your ign, let me check out your store.
---
Lol thanks
---
I'm not only taking pictures.. it is I never encountered any bug never
---
I haven‚Äôt been following too much. Are we going to want to start a new character when Wastelanders drops, or is it all meant to be endgame content?
---
My forest scout armor mask in the inventory looks the same ( colour ) as the urban one. But when I equip it on my character it is forest colours ( as it should be ).  
---
So this is a bug?
---
ok, sure
---
bo it definitely looks way better than the games that came out in that last  5-10 years
---
Yeah, at least change your name..
---
Yes exactly
---
Ikr
---
I am certainly interested in this service at some point, not wuite ready For it yet.
---
Slow down there guy. 5 screenshots don‚Äôt validate anything. When you‚Äôre playing a smash hit expansion that brings back the player base you can start talking validation.
---
Yeah
---
Ffs. Can‚Äôt decide if lazy or stupid or both.
---
Right, but unless I‚Äôm mistaken from what we know of the datamines the 96 raid was very similar to the 94 raid in a lot of ways. Considering the negative reception and feedback 94 has since received, I feel like they delayed 96 until a much later date in order to rework it into a genuinely enjoyable experience or, possibly, to work on perfecting their instancing tech, or even both. I know it sucks, but considering how poorly 94 did I think it‚Äôs for the best that 96 gets delayed until they‚Äôre absolutely sure its ready.
---
I remove grass not for the FPS, I do it to find the corpses of my enemies, I would like to be able to do it with just a key while playing.
---
This post is kinda redundant to what the post's aim is? That has nothing to do with this post lol
---
I didn't receive my atoms as well so I sent a ticket, they told me that atoms are stored in a microwallet at the platform of where you did the purchase, and you need to launch the game through that respective launcher to get the atoms, I tried and it worked.
---
TL;DR Launch the game through the Bethesda.net Launcher
---
I've been asking the same thing. The raids are the only fun I have left in the game. Having a not her would really help bridge the gap till wastelanders
---
Hahaha
---
Don‚Äôt forget about the Brain Fungus soup. INT increases your xp gain.
---
This is a leftover from when CAMPs used to become entirely "unplaced" if your spot was contested. You had to place the *entire* thing back down again when you next found a server, so most of us (including myself originally) built these one-legged things so they could easily be re-placed if they got removed.
---
I guess so, but in all actuality 94 wasnt that bad from a performance issue, and any issues were resolved lightning fast. Ive been raiding for the last month with no big issues, and i doubt 96 would be very much worse for performance. Either way, its not here yet, sadly, but it should be eventually, and i can wait.
---
You mean loot bag as in the paper bag?  Don‚Äôt try xfer using those, try a world container tho in general sounds like you got unlucky.
---
The outer area serves only as a backdrop, without it there'd be no mountains to block the view of the void beyond, that should be common sense.
---
It's a new main quest, so not all endgame content, but they're going to rebalance things and add the legendary perk system, so high-level players will definitely have stuff to do. They talked about "renormalization" at Quakecon too, whatever that entails
---
Pistols are fine as long as you go Bloodied with a side of Sneak. üëç
---
Haha I love it man, however I noticed you have 2 first names... And you know what they say about people with two first names?
---
And? I can have my own thoughts and opinions, this is reddit and eeing the photo tells me not to waste my time with some 1k subscriber channel with lack of talent in content... I prefer popular channels with extremely high subscribers, those that have "actual" talent in their content when it comes to quality, editing and performance, if I watched this "video" you mentioned which honestly I won't just putting it out there it's a cool picture I'm not gonna lie, it's the options of photo mode in the bottom right that messed with the immersion of the photo, I'm just making a scenario of the photo that's all so there's no reason to get all defensive, I'm not sure to return to fallout 76 after playing it the 1st month it came out, the people on there could be the same and just try to kill me and steal my junk for being low leveled but regardless interesting picture üòÉüëç
---
Yes, it's beautiful and if you're smart enough to have turned off the music, sounds wonderful too.
---
Great, thanks! Will test this on an old laptop and see what happens with the fps :-)
---
Agreed, much more interested in a traditional vault exploration experience.
---
Yea I should‚Äôve, was being lazy and trying to save a few seconds by not slow walking to a container. Total backfire
---
what music?
---
I play on both xbox and pc.
---
Lost 200 circuits I was dropped.  Bag was empty within seconds in dropping.
---
What do they say?  Haha
---
I use a Bloodied .50 Cal with a +10% while aiming... Named it -GWAR- 
---
All Heavy gun perks, bullet shield, lock &amp; load, Stabilized, nerd rage, one gun army, Bloody Mess, Covert Operative, Tenderizer, Emergency protocols on my PA, Ballistic Bock Psycotats, Big Guns Bobble head, &amp; 2 Nuka grape for when things reach the post SBQ mad dash so I get to keep my loot.
---
I have on average hit SbQ in the face for 129 each bullet, 70 - 85 on  other parts &amp; that is 250 Bullets per Volley.
---
Not to forget, the One Gun Army perk  cripples the heck out of her and she either hovers in one spot, or lands &amp; doesn't move much.
---
How so
---
For me a bag never appeared. I suspect it‚Äôs because they appear when you exit the pipboy so if you get disconnected while dropping multiple things it never drops anything.
---
To be honest I've been playing fallout 4 again recently and most of the time I feel the graphics are barely any different. Infact quite often the opposite, in that sometimes fallout 4 looks better and I'm not even using texture, hd, overhaul mods

Yes. I need something else to do. I run the raids regularly, and after theyre completed, i dont have much else to do. Id love to be able to have 2 raids to do and keep myself busy. I have a routine of running all three levels of the raids, dropping three nukes and doing an imposter event. All of which takes maybe 2 hours tops.
---
Some of the most beautiful locations are; the very peak of Seneca Rocks (the highest point of the map, and overlooking everything), the large waterfall in the Mire (West of the chemical plant), the giant cliff overlooking Watoga in the cranberry bog.
---
There are plenty of lakes/bodies of water than can be built around in the forest and savage divide. All depends on what you like.
---
I've always roleplayed my character as a rogue hunter, I climbed Seneca rocks just after the beta, and didn't move for nearly a year.
---
Does Wastelanders have a set release date? I know it did but heard it got set back.
---
Give me the ability to build on a tree and to use a rope ladder and I may stop
---
"Why is this purple? Why is this purple? why is this f***** thing purple?"
---
that was too funny!
---
Yeah... I came into the ITV with expectations of disappointment. I saw "screenshots" in the name and expected some random pictures from previous week. I saw the church and went "Hell, that's a nice CAMP."
---
After zooming in I went "Wait, we can't build THAT" and then I re-read the title... I felt dumb after that.
---
Source for that decrease statement?
---
Happy Thanksgiving!
---
I meant to say ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù but that tryptophan is hitting me pretty hard. 
---
I truthfully believe that most people base their value on the first legendary trait. Sentinel often gets overlooked.
---
I won't lie, it looks promising. Here's hoping this is the shot in the arm the game needs.
---
All we know is the first quarter of 2020, so maybe March?
---
It was painful to finally realize who and how the who was running.shit from the top and crushing the people at my level with expectations that couldn't be achieved with the lack of man power so I walked lol and HR of all departments called wanted to know the reason for me leaving informed them of the overall situation and that it needed to be addressed with a 3-4 year plan of some sort and was told straight across well we run lean team's it's a waste of our resources and time to add people at this level so if that's all thank you for your feedback but there's nothing we can do.. click absolutely absent minded nonsense imo
---
Happened to me and I lost a lot of items
---
Vile? He didn‚Äôt kill anyone. I‚Äôm more mad at assholes who one shot legendaries before others can get a hit rather than some idiot leaving items in a bag and getting mad someone took it. Is it cool? No, but fucking quit yer bitching. ITS A FUCKING GAME nerd.
---
Maybe don't let anyone dictate what you want to do either way. Your goal seems fine. Besides, you can have it both ways in this case. :)
---
What mask is that btw üëÄ
---
Yea not sure why I was downvoted, just tried again dropped some random ammos and disconnected by force closing application before leaving pipboy and again, nothing ever dropped.
---
Is this r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
How to go in there?
---
I have this game on both systems. PC is running 980ti hybrid, i5 9600k and games are on am SSD.  PS4 is running an SSD too. The game runs hands down way smoother on my PC.
---
It‚Äôs ‚Äúthey‚Äôre‚Äù.
---
I‚Äôm sure they will open the one or more of several of the entrances that are on street level.
---
There's a spot just northeast of the civil war fort that I've settled into. It's up against a rock wall with a big flat rock in front that's nice to keep critters out. It's also pretty scenic, giving it a lost cabin in the woods aesthetic. The only thing about it is that fast travel to the southern part of the map gets really expensive. It's 45+ caps to travel south of Charleston Station.
---
The thing is I'm on xbox.
---
Yeah, FO76 is a concept I have been waiting for since FO3 introduced me to the universe, even if some of the stuff kind of breaks the lore. Exploring Appalachia with my friends is as fun as I imagined, and it's one of the very few games than can truly ease my mind from all my daily worries.
---
I wish that I had more time to play it, but otherwise I'm thankful for the good moments it gave in this last year which has been quite a test, and I hope I can play it for long!
---
Then idk lmao
---
Stupid and pointless video where nothing happened. Shocker...
---
I called that ever since I first saw the parking garage entrances.
---
This is by far the safer way.
---
U good lol I'll prob just submit a ticket
---
Is it open now tho? Or we gotta wait?
---
There's a spot southeast of Vault 76 with a lake with a dock, a tree with a swing, and bees.
---
Well the only reason it's missing players is because bethesda have treated their playerbase like dirt. I love the game but jfc the amount of bullshit this community has put up with from bethesda.
---
Ty for fast reply
---
If your teammates are close enough they will get the aid, junk and caps. All the plans and non legendary gear is only for whoever cashes in the map.
---
What are you 13?  You missed it  haha
---
Well 1/16 is smaller than 1/4 am i right
---
Follow the overseers quest until you have the small backpack and do the first responders training to learn camp building, then do whatever you want.  No need to rush the overseers quest or you will get into areas you are too low level for.
---
This. Made the switch after about a month. PC is hands down the best platform to play on
---
Acording to your username, notify everyone you see that a settlement needs help. 
---
Tbh just explore at your pase, don‚Äôt try to rush the game as it will wait for you. Enjoy the scenery, the little mysteries and the odd people you meet.
---
Yikes, how much coolaid did you drink?
---
Plus, its gonna be a super cool cryo vault, so even the non-raid part of it will be awesome
---
Yeah, I learned the "To low level for enemies part" when I wandered into 5 protectrons
---
It will run much better on PC; but will still have issues -- my personal experience on a few different systems I see significant framerate drops on the Whitespring's golf green and heavily built up player camps.
---
That said, if you're trying to run it on some entry level PC setup from 4-5 years ago, it's going to be rough. Girlfriend's setup had this running on a GTX 960 2GB and it was pretty lackluster performance wise.
---
Great! thanks
---
By the Root! Those are definitely Interloper Cultists. Ia, Ia, the First Born of the Wood slumbers no more.
---
Lots of that good stuffüëå
---
Wait until Wastelanders dlc
---
Thanks a bunch. As long as I can be in control of the performance then I don‚Äôt mind. 
---
It‚Äôs when it takes 5 minutes to load the entire game that‚Äôs a problem.
---
Have fun!
---
Same here!
---
Loading is 100% the hard drive; a lot of us PC folks ditched those are primary storage solutions for solid state drives some time ago. If you have the PS4 Pro, that should be SATA3 and take excellent advantage of a 2.5" Sata3 solid state drive -- at the cost that you'll lose any data saved on your PS4's hard drive as it would be swapped out.
---
Agreed. It isn‚Äôt one that a couple of randoms are likely to complete. You need to put a team together and plan it out. As long as it‚Äôs random like it is now, that‚Äôs impossible.
---
Or scorchbeast...
---
But how dose a magazine make it armor piercing? I hunt and use guns enough to know the power of a bullet is effected by three things, size/shape , amount of powder and barrel length of gun
---
Wait until wastelanders
---
The Corvegs industrial water purifier is quieter
---
on top of the camp/small pack users comment, id suggest hitting a few low level resource spots to get a baseline of repair/crafting items
---
I had the same issue. Still no resolution
---
ANOTHER settlement needs our help...
---
ü§Æ

I‚Äôd recommend you farm white springs for a while, until you hit level 50. Just find a decent melee weapon and then grind it out. You‚Äôll get killed a lot but don‚Äôt worry about it, you can respawn for free every time you die and just go back, collect your junk, and keep killing ghouls. I‚Äôd also recommend that you place a base right next to white springs so you can easily deposit any loot that you find. But all of that is just if u want to grind, get a ton of xp, and collect loot. If you don‚Äôt want to grind, I‚Äôd recommend that you just explore the open world, and enjoy the game. My favourite part is collecting and trading legendary weapons, but hey, everybody is different.
---
Agree with this in full as well
---
Watoga station vendor has them always in its inventory for sale.
---
I have a lot of mixed feelings about the game. Overall to me it‚Äôs an okay game. But one hill I will die on is that the OST of the game (the original score, not Appalachia Radio) is one of the best in any video game. The only one it competes with IMO is Oblivion.
---
Sure thing. I just hit lvl 90
---
There's some really nice views in the toxic valley. The hills between Grafton and the dry lake bed have some nice spots.
---
Also some good places along the border of the savage divide. Either side. Lots of little camp sizes ledges.
---
Whenever you're ready, just let me know!
---
I‚Äôll give it a couple more tries, thanks for the speedy reply
---
Request sent! We hope to see you soon!
---
Go to the Whitespring golf club.
---
I have a feeling marsupial will start to die once wastelanders drops. That intelligence drop will be felt hard in those int speech checks
---
Exactly. Plus the new vault armor is suppose to be awesome, freezing enemies. Hopefully they decide to put unyeilding in the drop pool this time around. Lol. Even without the armor, id just be happy with new content. This dry spell is killing me. Ive been playing since day 1 beta, and im finding it harder and harder to log in every day.
---
I enjoy the game. I‚Äôve played since beta and the bugs can be really annoying but the community is overall really good. I‚Äôve only come across one griefer which in all my gameplay is good. I like the story of fallout 76, it‚Äôs quite good if you take the time to unfold it. My only really complaint about the game is the bashing effect on guns, that really is useless and needs to be removed. Really looking forward to the story progressing in wasteland era.
---
You needed *more* dwemer ruins??
---
Dealt with a guy like this not too long ago. Got him banned while also getting banned for defending the game (apparently they‚Äôre allowed to tell you to suck Todd Howard‚Äôs dick but you can‚Äôt troll them &amp; use no curse words or anything vulgar Rule:4 Be CivilüôÉ)
---
Oh god. No new vault armor. Give us a mod that we can apply to any weapon for added energy damage +freeze chance. My armor is already set, thank you very much. Let me freeze enemies without a cryolator pls.
---
Healing factor I‚Äôve just gotten back on my PC alt, forgot how many stims I saved between bouts
---
Enclave makes the most sense.  BoS is still a new faction at this point in the timeline and probably doesn't have a ton of members or resources yet.    
---
Meanwhile Enclave is the strongest faction in America by a country mile at this point, still controlling their offshore oil rig base and substantial assets including government facilities and satellites.  But not for the chucklefuck that went down in the bunker under Whitesprings they'd be pretty well positioned to re-establish control over most of North America.
---
Attention: we are also hiring! 
---
If you wish to apply, you must agree to keep our methods secret, and to never share them with anyone other than your co-workers. Failure to do so will result in your camp being the target of our services. 
---
Even so, this service can be very profitable, and you may finally be able to solo run the silos! 
---
There are a VERY selective set of positions open. Apply today by sending me a PM!
---
Why'd ya delete? Coward.
---
Most definitely. The ammo for it is so expensive, if it was more effective at freezing enemies it wouldnt be a problem. It takes an entire clip to freeze anything just about. A mod for your weapons would be cool, no pun intended. Theyd probably implement it on an undesirable weapon though. Lol. Im just picturing a cryo syringer. XD
---
Everyone hates on fallout 76.
---
Interesting. Sounds like I‚Äôll probably just re-roll for it. I haven‚Äôt played in a year anyway.
---
Sweet thanks for the tip
---
Cars in perfect condition.
---
I've heard of reaching but this...my god...
---
I think it would be cool to equip the hazmat suits with ballistic protection mods which would give enough resistance to survival a few goul slashes but still be a down grade from armor
---
*fuck*
---
Feel free to wander to.. it's a cool map and there is a lot in it if you take the time to look.. seems like many miss out on some of the fun of the game because they just try to level up fast.  It's like Minecraft and you can just explore and scrap.. you don't have to buy your way through the game.  Have fun however you want!
---
I respect your opinion. However I still feel that this game is a cash grab. I've played over 200 hours with multiple characters but there is "NO PLAYER CHOICE" no rpg elements. Just a lazy first person shooter with way overly priced items in the atomic shop. Borderline robery. I'm coming back for wastlanders and hope it's actually good and includes actual choice.
---
The Enclave outfit already sorta does that vibe.
---
I still haven‚Äôt found my way into the Burrows .. where is it?
---
Those still drop afaik.  Quad is my favorite Tesla, but I only use it for tagging at group events.
---
You found it but didn‚Äôt link it? Dude.
---
I just collect them in hopes that there will one day be a way to display them
---
They need to install matchmaking already on certain things like this and the vault raid.
---
cool thank you! I'll see if I can find him!
