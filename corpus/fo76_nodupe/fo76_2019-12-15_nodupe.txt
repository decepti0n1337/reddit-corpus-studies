&gt;rewards are plentiful (if low level)
---

---
They're dependant on the level of the scorched that dropped them. Want higher level legendary rewards? Head to the Mire and Bog and go hunting there. Want low level stuff for alts or to give to new players? Hit all the spots in the forest.
---
---
---
Private servers are much harder to hop.  The instance stays open for about 5 minutes, popping you right back into the same world.  I'm doing all my farming on public servers.
---
I like using my spare mini nukes on mirelurk queens, and spare missiles on a AA targeting missile launcher against scorchbeasts. The 40mm grenades are okay just for general killing, but I save them for tougher things like mirelurk kings
---
I do have like 12000 syringer ammo though, would be nice to do something with that. Or, you know, make the syringer not be a broken, worthless piece of garbage
---
Was wondering the same thing about loot on mobs. If a SB spawns for example, does it spawn already with its loot, or is it essentially empty until I look in ir? Schrodingers cat type thing.
---
Fuck yeah thanks heaps what’s your gt I’ll send you a request now or send me one Cliffdog666
---
Glad you got it back
---
There are tons of locations in the forest/valley that spawn low level scorched, so this is probably the best time to start a new toon. Mine has picked up at least 20+ assorted level 1-10 legendaries in the last 2 days and is much better off than previous new characters in terms of survivability and DPS.
---
Yeah I can see that
---
Yeah it’s been going on for awhile now. Really annoying.

my guy
---
If you know the cards to get at every level, a full build can be completed by level 60. It probably involves a lot of handed down gear. Was he in power armor? I played around w pvp the other day and ran into the low level bait player w a high level hiding player. I could kill the lower level 9/10 times, but my B FFR handmade did nothing to the high level PA player. We actually talked a bit afterward. I had never seen my handmade do nothing to a player that I could catch in vats. The pa player was also using a BE Gat plasma. Killed in seconds. I offered to come back with my Bloodied Sentinel build, then I was blocked.

 I saw that too and the death with only being able to Rez at the vault is back with a vengeance. 
---
WTB just one friggin patch where they don’t screw up ten things to fix one.
---
Exactly
---
Yes,  now they are, but they weren’t before.
---
Could be a BSOD and your Windows automatically restarts. Open up the Event Viewer, find the System node and you should see error(s) or warning(s).
---
It could be also a bad PSU-Videocard interaction. Your card overdraws the power in the menu due to unlocked framerate, which crashes the driver and/or trips the PSU's failsafe.
---
Downclock your GPU and/or video RAM by 100 MHz (MSI Afterburner, EVGA Precision, etc.) and see if it still crashes.

A thanksgiving event with Graham would have been great in my opinion.

And the joy of walking out Into a nuke zone unable to fast travel and not in pa...xxx
---
I played most of the day today. On one server, I’d see no holiday variants anywhere. Then I hopped servers and did Bots on Parade. 4 holidays and a bonus legendary. I’m out of scrip for the day for that character, 5 scrip at a time. I’ll try again tonight with my higher level bloodied build. The Morgantown airport always seems to have one, but other places are empty. It’s so hit and miss.
---
My gt is capricious boi, I'm on rn
---
Oh Sony would never allow it
---
I made a run through the cavern last night and ended up with 7 small gifts, 3 medium gifts, and 2 large gifts, plus 10+ legendary pieces.
---
I made another run through it this morning and found 1 santascorched.
---
It's pure RNG, just like everything else.
---
If you’re on XB1, I can just give you a keycard. I shoot them down anytime I see the convoy.
---
Just random drops, happy hunting :p
---
I've heard about the blueprint/budget size problem before, it's an odd thing for sure. I pretty much just ignored blueprints right after launch, once I realized you have to click each item individually. xD
---
what
---
I dindnt know it was that good either i just bought it cuz i liked to watch the water splash
---
Snow. It’s snow maker time now.
---
If you plan on building up a new character for this xp weekend or any other time, this event is fantastic.  The ability to farm legendary enemies of any level you choose allows you to build up a "leveling kit" to twink a new character with.  Yesterday I got a lvl 15 Vampire/Explosive Handmade.  I was just stunned.
---
I have one character slot that's sort of a disposable farmer, because you can get some very rare outfits and (previously rare) plans while doing the main quest line.  I typically spec him into two handed weapons or semi-auto rifles, as those are the most cost efficient weapon types that do well vs enemies of all levels, and I'd been saving mid-level instigating and anti-armor rifles and slugger weapons for a while.  Add in the odd regenerating, vanguard or autostim three star armor you come across, and it makes the journey from level 1-50 very easy.  
---
You just need a friend to hold a pile of weapons and armor to give your new character as soon as you leave the vault.  Typically I ask a friend to spare ten minutes, trade him the entire inventory of my old character, make a new character, and just transfer all the guns and armor to the new one right outside Vault 76.  He's free to keep all the ammo, food, plans, aid items, etc.  I just want the dozen weapons and dozen armor pieces I'd been saving.  Stimpaks become less important when you have lvl 1 regenerating armor and an instigating pitchfork as starting gear.
---
Its most likely your box. Go download some stress tests and try to duplicate the problem.
---
Time to make a blood sacrifice and server hop then!
---
It's not a new concept, either.  The ammo press from Fallout 3 allowed you to craft ammo from either scrap or other ammo.  I don't think it would be unreasonable to allow us to scrap ammo to get gunpowder, steel and lead.
---
Then why have a shotgun when any other weapon with that perk setup will do the same job?
---
ThTs when you gotta defend home turf until it’s burnt to the ground or they’re dead and not coming back. I used to run a mutation that would shock when you got meleed. One time in my own camp I’m working on weapons and armor and I get smacked then the dude runs away. 20 seconds later I walk out onto the balcony and see 3 weasels holding fat mans across my pond.  Pointing them at my estate. I ran inside, grabbed my lmg that gained damage on consistent hits on a target and waved back at them with my bullets. Needless to say it ended 45 mins later with a couple roof pieces missing but no more weasels.
---
If its an explosive cryolator the crystalizing barrel doesn't work properly btw.
---
Have you tried setting up manual DNS settings on your router? That was a big issue for me. There is a good guide if you google it
---
Stop being a douche next time?
---
... and let us earn that ammo script by handing in ammo at said dispensers.
---
Yeah I just had a match with a hacker in it. Guy was flying around and was also naked. Reported him with screenshots.
---
| Stability: Fixed an issue that could cause the game to crash on Xbox One
---
Apparently, thereby creating an issue that would trigger additional crashes. Last night and today, both periods under 2 hours, 4 crashes. 3 during melee fights. and 1 for unknown. Hadn't had those 'buzzing' crashes in a while, but 2 of my melee crashes resulted in those; the third melee crash was a complete hangup of the game where all action on the screen just stops abruptly.
---
I thought everybody did...
---
Our women and the food out of our mouth
---
Good Lord you are clever.  Did you learn that during your time in Debbie Downer's School for Unloved Children?
---
I did this when vending first dropped put in some low level BOS rifles put a similiar sign on it and some ahole lvl 200 took em within 10 minutes of me doing this.
---
I dont maybe as an additional option but i did not like how they did the hween event ar all i like to be able jump in an out when i want
---
My issue with the continued theory that Fallout 76 will come to Steam is the lack of anything corroborating it from Bethesda themselves. Yes, they promised it would come to Steam (ten months ago); it hasn't. They promised Wastelanders; that was specifically corroborated as delayed and screenshots were posted as evidence that it was in fact coming. Steam release? Nothing. If it was going to be tied to Wastelanders, Bethesda would have stated that with their Wastelanders info dump. Assumptions are not evidence.
---
Mods? No word at all since launch. Steam? A pipedream at this point. I'd settle for the game not crashing every 2-30 minutes at this point. Beta was far more stable, at least the crashes were clearly servers; now it just crashes. (Could be the removal of the error code, but I doubt it.)
---
XB1!
---
Maybe it was contested? Like a player afked somewhere in the circle or was just being a troll
---
lol
---
they fixed it yesterday didn't they?? Don't tell me its broken again...
---
Ive run into some very unaccepting people.
---
Im also 30. There was a much bigger stigma 15+ years ago. This wave we are riding now is still new to me.  Lol
---
I mean yea? You were gonna kill their friend?
---
Fixer. But both you specified are great.
---
Yah but i still say they should make the scrip a weekly thing as opposed to a daily
---
There are no ways I have been a douche. I am a simple troll and pvper. Nothing I do is harassment

Does sound like you deserve it 🤔
---
I get why they did it. I'm just saying they shouldn't have been able to.
---
the whole team should become wanted with really high bounty
---
Sounds like the game is better off without you involved in it.
---
There is a listed loot table for the gifts, fixer is not on it.
---
I'm just asking for a increase in spawns during the event. Not making them to take out the rest of them.
---
lol underground sounds sinister. it just custom software made to accomodate multi generational machines.
---
thank you!
---
Wait, you want to be able to turn in scrip once a week, or did I read that wrong?
---
How so?
---
I have got vintage nukeshine from at least 3 small off of the "santas"
---
Why would you want to do that?
---
For what lmao
---
it very fun
---
&gt;You may not harass...this includes but is not limited to verbal attacks, unwanted messaging, personal attacks, **stalking or any other undesired behavior used to cause discomfort or disrupt  another customers experience**.
---
It was right there in the notice they sent you. I know, reading can be hard sometimes.
---
I’ll give you what you need...
---
Legendary enemies, or rather your chance of spawning them, appears to be favored on some servers while others are nearly devoid.
---
I'd suggest finding a spot, say Berkeley Springs, to behave like a test site.  Choose a high level spot, because max level enemies seem to have a better chance of being legendary.  Log in, clear the place, and if you don't run into a festive enemy just server hop.  Repeat as needed, then stay on a really great server until you either quit for the night or get disconnected.  At the very worst, it's taken me a dozen tries to find a "hot server".
---
I've been hunting legendaries as my end game since at least the end of last winter.  This event is exactly the same, in terms of patterns.  I've always found that any server will seem to favor a certain enemy type to be upgraded to legendary more often than others, and obviously this time we're all looking for Scorched.
---
Sounds very annoying
---
&gt; unless we shouldn't trust them to follow through on their promises
---
How have y'all actually not learned this by now.
---
Richard:  Am I going to prison?
---
Jared:  Don't worry, I can train you.
---
Could of been at the start but the second time there wasn’t for sure
---
Lmao yo it is, ya know what's even funnier? I do the same shit high in-game that I do in IRL. Sitting at my settlement doing nothing, waiting for people to stop by my vendor and eat food lmao
---
I sometimes use a pair of Instigating Combats with 10% aim damage for tearing through WS and Westek. True long barrel/stock, perforating mag, and a green dot (plus all related perks). Most mobs die in one hit, especially while sneaking. Yeah, the damage bug does occasionally happen and the range ain't what your used to, but they're still fun/effective enough for me. *And* I frequently find ammo dumped in containers/bags because "shotguns suck".
---
Although lately I *have* been mostly over-killing the shit outta things with the bandwagon Bloody DCG, been a month or two since I had the shotguns out for more than a few shells at a time, 5 digit damage numbers are just too much fun. Oh god...I've been converted...shotguns suck man.
---
The old Haywire Turrets at your camp bug seems to have returned as well...

&gt;horrifying monsters.

that's quite the exaggeration considering it was just a few words.

They are just out there living their best life.

all i want is your big fat seed
---
There was a hotfix on Friday, are you sure you didn't noticed It?
---
Maybe we could just scrap it .. thatnwould work 🙂
---
It's a free play time. Lots of 13 year old douchebags can jumo in whenever they want.
---
Console was off last night instead of asleep, bet that's it. But 60+ GB? Seems off.
---
But I want mini nukes and cannonballs....
---
Show me on the doll where these words hurt you
---
No scrip weapons for the scrip cap once a Week instead of daily cap
---
Dont waste points on perk cards that you do not need. Adding points to perk cards does not trigger more to open. Only add points to perk cards that you have chosen for your ranged or mele build.
---
Search for build guides to be sure which perk cards and mutations to use. Choose wisely
---
Just a big ol' stinky diarrhea that I charge a monthly fee to see and smell
---
Were there multiple that consisted of a foundation, a brick wall with the letters, and a generator?
---
It seems like Bethesda has set up the guns a bit unrealistically to force you to change weapons as you grow your character. Shotguns in the low levels but need be abandoned as you grow and level up.  Reality be damned 🙂
---
Agreed!
---
If you've got caps, it's pretty easy to find player vendors that sell a lot of 5mm for 1 cap per round. That is if you aren't wanting to craft
---
Afaik common PS4 issue, regardless If the update is 15 mb or 15GB, It still needs the whole game to be downloaded.
---
People can be so gross. Im surprised workshops stay the same after the person logs out. Just... wow. I guess some people like testing their limits and getting banned 🤷‍♀️
---
I'll try this out. I'm having wonderful luck in Helvetia.
---
This is my 3rd play through. I don’t remember being made to pick perks as I go to get to the ones I want. I REALLY want and need Martial Artist. Unfortunately I had to chose a bunch of perks that I don’t particularly want so that I could get MA to show up.
---
I would use the meds one if it had chems because raiders vendors don't carry them.
---
But yeah the wasteland just needed more urinals that's what they're really for.
---
The social media mob surrounding fallout 76 is crazy. The game is really fun and so are the players. I suspect you'll find a lot that isn't true as you play more.
---
I love when this happens, the other day I found one doing bloodied and +1str on melee, got a BSS+1 str grognak's axe out of it!
---
Yes.
---
Sorry I missed you earlier
---
No it’s not my internet it’s fallout 76, it might be only affecting a small number of people but I have literally done everything. I’m not having any issues with anything far as games online or streaming. Thanks tho
---
Oh yeah that was me
---
i wanna know what you did in-game during your last session before you received the ban
---
I have an awesome shotty collecting dust due to the nerf a long time ago. I don't even use mine, miss it. The person or persons that nerfed the shotguns are probably gone at Beth, can we get a little buff for them, just a little!?..
---
The vast, vast majority of players are friendly or at worst, indifferent to you. There are certainly toxic players out there, and those bad experiences often get talked about more, but they’re definitely the exception. 
---
Word of advice...You’d do well to avoid taking workshops until you decide you want to get into PvP. If you’re ever going to have a bad time with another player, that’s where it’ll happen.
---
i had never used a Grenade Launcher until one dropped 90% reduced [weight.Now](https://weight.Now) it is my go to for crowd control.Excellent for dispersing Ghouls coming out of the Club House.A lot of fun watching them fly.
---
That sucks, I got evicted from the other side of the stream in Flatwoods, second time I have been evicted, first was next to the church .. I still have two bunkers in the Bog and at the top of the world .. I have been contemplating opening the door ..
---
"Fallout 76 messed up again!" stories are good for clicks apparently.
---
Free scrap
---
I've went up 3 levels pretty quickly due to the emptiness of the servers. I wish Beth would leave the double XP as normal XP then double it again during special times like the holidays etc.
---
Yeah,  I get this.  So you can get the FULL scrip amount for the week, IF you actually have a job and can't play video games all day every day.
---
Schrodinger's Plan: Mounted Cat Head.
---
I can imagine.. this is when I make a new character and try something different again.  For me it's a PvE game so who's the best doesn't matter - I don't care about doing the most damage, at the moment i'm trying non-vats sniping with the long range &amp; sniper perk cards and taking all engagements slow, with a short barrel rifle for indoors.  An SMG would make more sense but an SBR works with the sniper perks.. so far it's not going too badly
---
Well they seem to do it alot probly to get people to talk about it
---
I just want rex's perk as a card or the eternal dogmeat. It would be a great way to introduce pets
---
Free wins for their alts maybe
---
Most of the ammo is garbage tbh. Like shotgun shells and .38 ammo sit forever because no one uses it and it is plentiful. I usually dont even bother. .45 ammo is good too. Lots of people need ammo because lead is uncommon and most gun builds go through a ton. Scrounger level 1 and 2 points in Ammosmith (with my excess lead) do wonders for making money. I have probably made somewhere between 10-15k in 6 months. 
---
For reference, I play a Power Armor melee build so most ammo is useless to me but it helped me saved up for Calibrated Shocks so....
---
PS.. when it comes to legendaries, I don't keep them generally. Get the scrip for them. I like to gamble with the Purveyor
---
I agree because they have no contact or connection to the west bos besides a radio in which the elder is like “yeah keep getting that power armor shit” but as far as we know they have never meat
---
It's *painfully* subtle. Honestly, if I hadn't been making runs there for springs and noticed a certain item was new, I don't think I'd have found it.
---
As in like standing by the body like hey it's over here
---
Swapped my explosive Shotgun for Ulltracite calibrated Shocks.
---
Best bit of business i have done,
---
They are now pretty much useless.
---
Can not remember the last time i saw a player using a Shotgun either.
---
Okay, the totals have been entered and I am no closer to a conclusion  than I was when I started.  Top three draws were 2 shot, bloodied, and executioner.  There were some hunter, zealot, instigating, and assassin mixed in.  It broke out around 25/20/20/10/10/10/5.  This was on about 100 ranged weapons.  I was hoping for something a little more diffentive, but this was what we got.
---
Fuck Bethesda, after what they did i exploit everything i possibly can.
---
I remember bethesda banned my account after coming into possession of a lot of TSE guns. I was lvl 10 or so at the time and was very new still, innocent and didn’t ever cheat or glitch. I thought this guy gave me all these weapons as a gesture of being friendly. W-r-o-n-g
---
 I get an email detailing my perm ban. I try to appeal but was denied as they said they have evidence of ME being the one duping stuff because i had so many guns. I can only surmise that the guy snitched or something. So i moved to PC a few months later and now i duplicate everything i can after the company wasted my 100 dollars within 2 days of playing. 
---
5 months later and i’m still not banned, ironically considering now i’m actually doing something wrong  😁 Keep downvoting me, see how many fucks i give
---
🤭☹️
---
It's very hit or miss honestly. I have better luck with traditional ammo.
---
This is great.  
---
But I would say, only farm the low level and mid level areas in PRIVATE servers, if you are a HIGH level player.  Stop screwing the low level guys by raping the low level areas in Adventure mode of ALL the fun and valuables.  
---
Farming is more fun than being given handouts by level 300 players who are killing everything and making the map a wasteland of already pillaged and razed locations.
---
I once got a level 5 attacking me for about quite a while trying to either get my mutations to kill me/ make my mutations or myself engage PvP with him. I kept moving doing my stuff trying him to leave me when I see his high level friend crouched on the nearby bushes waiting for my PvP to trigger so he could kill me.
---
Just ended up shifting maps wishing I had a private server up just so I didn't had to deal with this crappy behaviour and blocked both. 
---
I know it's the wastelands but if I wanted to engage PvP I would go Nuclear winter or workshops capture.
---
Invest in weight reduction perks. Always good to have around when  you're loaded down coming from a good Queen fight. That way it fells like less of a waste.
---
Exactly what is the point? Lolame.. It's probably an infant  neck beard in a nest with no life lol ya gotta feel for these peeps..

---
Shotguns were mediocre as it is even in the past, the only reason people loved it was the Explosive effect and how it screwed with the shotgun pellet damage to go overboard. Now people are forced to look in the mirror and see why shotguns are once again crap.
---
Long story short: There should be a buff on the shotguns, NOT legendary effects. So the major issues are:  
---
\-Lack of armor penetration
---
\-Lack of range
---
\-inconsistent damage
---
Makes sense overall. The only shotgun that has armor pen is the Combat Shotgun, and it suffers from the lack of range as well, so that needs to be worked on via shells or having some other modification to improve armor piercing (since the damage is done via pellets, should have at least something like 50-70% armor pen). The range is a huge culprit of no fun with these weapons, the pump for example has a maximum range of 72....72!   
---
 the range is far too low to be useful in most combat situations, and as soon as you go over 72, like 73, your damage plummets down into single digit territory.
---
This is a confusing post... on one hand, itd be great for people to not do these things, or at least to not go out of their way to do it. And on the other, it is a game rated M for mature, so you should kind of expect things like this i guess. 🤷‍♂️
---
Where is this event at? Is it in Adventure mode?
---
And one usually at the water treatment plant.
---
This event is the a lot of what I have wanted since day 1.
---
More Scorched Legendaries.  Check
---
More Legendaries Period.  Check
---
More low level Legendaries.  Check
---
More locations to farm Legendaries.  Check
---
Give Whitespring a break so it can be farmed without interruption from other players.  Check
---
Better Special CAMP plans that are more cheerful and less death and destruction oriented.  Check.
---
Still need a real Christmas tree, small with lights and decorations. .... Is there one?
---
Well are you on pc, ps4, or xbox?
---
Morgantown airport gives me a good handful
---
Was it a big fat black guy with white hair? Fucker was flying thru the air and killed everything this afternoon.
---
Point pleasant. Been there twice and 3 legendaries both times
---
Send em to the moon for me just like bingbong from inside out x
---
PS4
---
You have nothing to lose by downloading it.
---
Don't shoot too fast. If you're are cruzing thru an area it takes a second for one to turn.. just like legendarys.
---
Sony already does crossplay just only for highly popular ones like modern warfare and fortenite
---
😂😂😂
---
And its an optional feature
---
Brutal. Thanks for the heads-up.
---
 When i  was farming the Fissure site facing the Pumpkin House after killing a Scorched Beast a Scorched appeared in a Red Dress,i nearly pissed myself laughing,so funny.
---
Scorched dont look happy the best of times.Even less so now.
---
I didn't know about this event until then.
---
I am glad i didn't.
---
And sometimes, it’s not because they *want* to grief you... it’s just they kind of have some challenges and achievements that require killing folks.
---
Like the other guy said, you lose nothing by downloading it, and you may like it.
---
As for fixing things - not really. I mean, they just had to roll back a bugfix they introduced because it created game-breaking issues, and there are bugs that have been around since the BETA.
---
Our group of four has plenty of presents drop doing this as well.
---
Try it and make your own opinion.
---
Good tip, thanks.
---
Me too.  The Encryptid event is so rare, and the drop rate of "The Fixer" plan extremely rare within the rareness of that event.  It's probably the most valuable/rare plan in the game right now.
---
Plays like fo4 without NPCs blabbing on about Shawn. If you liked fo4 after the main quest chances are good you will like it.
---
Uh there are other people in the world so that's up to you.
---
Most of us like company.
---
Why did they even choose 1%, that’s just ridiculous. Make it 10%, it cost them nothing and makes players happy.
---
Amazing game, worth trying it .. lots of fun, depends if you a Fallout fan or not .. I play it daily.
---
Right? just roll with the punches fancy the bugs up and throw the plans in like Minecraft did
---
What drove you to do it? What was the thought process behind it?
---
Which I've seen running 3 times in the last 3 months.  Not a great chance of getting that plan when it drops maybe once every 25  Encryptid events now.  That means about 2 years waiting for it.
---
The legendary armor glitch? That was fixed I think like two days ago.
---
Ok, I’ve been avoiding playing since than thank you
---
I’ve found that it crashes less when I wait a few seconds between using multiple items,
---
No problem! I hope you enjoy the Christmas event!
---
Try the trading sub. Was around 10k a bit ago.
---
Add TheBiPolarBear25
---
makes me sad to think about. Game feels like a shell of its former self somehow, and it was already kind of a shell of a game to begin with.
---
Because I could, and to trigger people like OP
---
All Rise is a pretty easy sledge to get too
---
Those puns are offensive and make me Fuhrerious.
---
That's what quack surgeon is for roofies are best when everyone gets them
---
That's an idea.  Level 100 is the MAX.  After that, you get no more Perk cards.  You are stuck with what you have.  The level 400 guys with a field of Mules might actually play the game rather than whine about Cap and Scrip limits that keep them from getting their 9 and 10 God tier weapons and selling the others for unlimited amounts.
---
A kid trolling and trying to be edgy to get a rise out of people like you. Yep, a truly "horrifying monster". You are giving the person exactly what they want, they are probably on this sub laughing right now.
---
Its what people do to try to initiate pvp. They’re wanted on purpose.

People don’t say it has a toxic player base dude.  Most everyone out there in the media and forums say fo76 players are helpful and friendly DESPITE the game’s issues.  Where did you hear those allegations?
---
Don't worry, usernames are public domain. Otherwise, he wouldn't share it on the trading sub.
---
Why?
---
Because I think we've met on a server before, nothing more.
---
I was leaving low level handmades and fixers for free in my vending, but same thing, high level players were taking them. I try dropping them in packages when I see them, but half of the time they don't understand what I'm doing. I finally got a small letter set today, I'm going to write on my vending to see me for a free wepon.
---
They are depressingly bad.I had a level 45 Assassins explosive with 10% damage to players.
---
My first build was dedicated to a Shotgun i maxed out all Shotgun Perks,skeet Shooter,covert operative etc.Based damage was hovering around 350+
---
The reality though It was Dog Shit.
---
Needing 2,3, shots to kill a Mole Miner stood just 2 feet in front of you.
---
Changed my entire build to Sniper/Melee.
---
Base damage with a bloodied meat Hook is about 600.Mole miners are dead before they hit the Floor.
---
Anything further away one shot from a bloodied 50 Caliber.
---
I personally think it is the perfect build.Get on the Roofs pick everything visible off,then on to the Ground with chameleon and finish what is left with the Meat Hook..

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

Nah you gotta be born from the hulk's seed for that title.
---
Or maybe, let the newbie players farm for their own gear, like you know, allow them to play the game for themselves, rather than depleting and farming areas that are intended for them and are just an empty fruitless wasteland once higher level players pillage  and raze them to nothingness, and give out freebies to feel good about themselves.
---
A variety of gunpowder, lead, or steel is also acceptable.
---
Well lets see fallout 1st caused a lot of drama and people made a lot of posts about "quitting," but that was mostly karma whoring.  Scorchbeasts have a higher chance of being legendary now.  Lots of bugs...some new some old and some returned.  Theres also a new unmarked quest at the grafton pawn shop and its a tricky one for sure.
---
Did you read the rules? Do you know what rule 9 is? I'm not saying you committed a crime, you broke a sub rule.
---
Where they gather for smoke breaks between jobs.
---
Oh ok. I play on xbox dang.
---
I see you are very sensitive about it, so I will edit my comment to not hurt your feelings any further.
---
Yeet to the max XD i got my 1st tse 10mm lvl 5 lol love this
---
Private servers are a thing along with the whole "fallout 1st" premium subscription. I forget how long ago they were added, but there are vault raids now. A new NW map, Morgantown. Legendary fixers have stolen the market for most coveted items because they can now be rolled from the purveyor if you know the plan to craft it.
---
Then there's obviously a Christmas event going on right now. Double XP/ free trial weekend, and an event to hunt down holiday scorched that drop Legendaries and holiday gifts.
---
Yeah, I remember reading a lot of the same posts when the Fallout 1st hit. Thanks!
---
Yes but he was also a selfish prick.
---
Right now my friend, there's a few things. 
---
First, it's double XP! So, you can play some Nuclear Winter and accumulate 2X XP towards the Halloween challenges! Weapon skins, and at 14k XP the Glowing Skeleton costume! 
---
Farm areas that have the scorched! Christmas event spawns Holiday scorched, dressed in holiday outfits. They are dropping small, medium and large gifts, as well as legendary items! Scorched human enemies only. The gifts contain caps, aid items, booze and RARE PLANS. Like Plasma grenade rare. 
---
Welcome home and Merry Christmas!
---
No thats usually how it goes. You really only run into toxic douchebags when taking over workshops.
---
I was wondering why I've been seeing so many Fixers on the marketplace
---
If you find people in NW who are hacking make sure to report them using the in game service. Report them every time you come in contact with them even if its multiple games in a row. This gives the customer service more data to work with to get these people gone.
---
Bwhaaaaaaaa so true.
---
Everyone with an explosive Shotgun must have done this, fired it killing yourself and what ever you were aiming at is unharmed.
---
Fireproof Perk maxed out stops this.
---
Thanks! I'll definitely hit up some of the DoubleXP once I get things situated
---
My favorite place
---
It's also nice to farm areas that aren't completely picked over for once.  See areas for what they are supposed to look like, without grief, without the distraction of some guy coming and one shot-ing the \*\*\* legendary that you were trying to get into position to attack.
---
What’s your IGN?
---
XX--BATMAN19--XX
---
I would have argued against you a week ago.  Not now.  Now I totally agree.
---
Soon stay in game only cheaters if bethesda dont do nothing with them... Btw soon there will be more people running into strangler pa than excavators :) what is the funniest thing most of time is bought for 100k ammo on fb or 2 maybe 3 legacy weapons decend handmade cost more :)
---
from what I've read PC has the most jerks online too, most of the griefers and such...
---
 How would you know that? ;)
---
I still like it over all. guess I will just keep being patient and others can keep being ranty have a good day o7
---
Shotguns are superb when you're low level.  Great for those  close quarters in early quests and exploring.  But they're Weak late game, for sure.
---
It would be better to get a max level decent weapon, but that’s still valuable. It can be used to level up a new character, and the ammo it takes is easy to find early game. With it being double exp at the moment, someone might buy it for a good chunk of caps to level some new characters.
---
U can sell it for a lot
---
This 100%
---
Shotguns are Dog Shit,really Dog Shit.
---
Once i ditched mine i started having fun.
---
I carry a 50 Caliber bloodied explosive Sniper Rifle.
---
This is fun,one shotting high level Super Mutants.
---
Up near the Pumpkin House today i killed 6 of them with one shot,3 were carrying Miniguns.
---
Can you imagine tackling 6 high level Super Mutants with any type of Shotgun ?,get in close with a Shotgun = Useless,shredded by Miniguns,Shoot from a distance,good luck with that :-).
---
They should be the go to weapon for a surprise attack,sneak build.Anything 6 foot in fron of a Shotgun should be dead.Instead they are useless.
---
if you get on top of the bridge you can shoot them down if you are patient. however you cannot loot them and they respawn faster than you can kill them. maybe a solid sniper build could farm that spot for xp but as a heavy laser gat gunner it wasnt worth it for me.
---
Its the jellyfish fields of 76
---
Good point. I kinda just want to throw it at a Vault Emerger though, fuck their whole perspective on the game up with this OP thang
---
it's my recording software, haha. i get a pretty solid 60fps
---
Idk, I'm on PS4 pro with fibre 79mbp and have had very few problems. V.stable and perf is great.
---
Alot of enemies melee you in the legs. Also if you have an explosive weapon and shoot down in front of you it affects condition.
---
I like the game, too. I wouldn't have stuck around otherwise. but facts are facts.
---
these issues won't resolve themselves "with time". it's clear at this point the current developers aren't cut out for the task. it baffles me they still have a job within the company.
---
but yeah.

---
Pretty awesome took me about 2 minutes to realize this wasn’t an atom shop item. Very creative
---
I'm trying to figure out what the deal is with the wrapping paper
---
Santa?
---
The Halloween challenges are a kind of, "re-do" as they ended just a tad early for us here in the states. So they've brought them back. Any progress you had back then, carries over to the current event. The rewards, from what memory serves are:
---
Jack O' Lantern paint for the 10mm pistol, amd combat rifle. Then there is "bat paint" for the assault rifle. It looks purple, with black bats. Jack O' Lantern paint for COMBAT ARMOR. Sick pumpkin on the chest, it's basically green, orange and yellow. Then the most killer, in my opinion is the glowing skeleton costume, same as the vanilla Halloween skeleton costume, but glows obviously. 
---
I never played NW. I tried it, and stopped at LVL2. Saw the challenges and had to have the costume. So I began the grind. Spent 3 days dying, hiding naked in bushes. But the challenge ended in Aussie time, about 7 hours early for us. I was literally at 12.5k XP. Needed just a few more games. Was very excited that they reopened the challenges. 
---
Sorry, that was long winded.
---
I do that with most of my low level legendaries, but with something like this I’d probably sell it and sink the caps into gift wrappings. I’m getting greedy, I’ve spent way too much on them now lol.
---
Anything found in a guano pile
---
What?  People were getting banned all the time.  "I got banned" posts were essentially all the front page of the sub was.
---
Considering they are launched out of tube into the air from a certain location it is not surprising some would be floating from time to time.
---
helvetia hasn't given me one... avr medical and the power plant are where i've had the most luck.
---
If they are weak legendary weapons and such, that is free scrip.
---
I never use explosive weapons because I am only getting waves of them from all the Christmas scorched (which are only level 5)
---
I agree with that actually. I’ve been wondering what the most i could send one of these off with for, like- 2k-5k range for the effects/scrip value? I usually just trade mine in but this wrapping paper scheme the vendor bots is running is really running my max charisma character low! Ha.
---
Oh, what a lovely idea.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And, btw, I sell all ammo for 1 cap each.  Doesn't everyone?
---
a most well thought comment
---
I had an FO4 mod that highlighted unsearched bodies and it was amazing
---
There is a matter of mutual exclusivity. I have been called toxic a few times in this very forum because of the retorts or responses I have made to either posts of my own or on others. Perhaps my dry wit and propensity to fiercely defend my point of view even again strong opposition can lead to a casual reader deeming my responses as toxic. Or it coujd be that I end most posts with “I don’t care. It’s a friggin’ video game. Nothing to get worked up over. Shit happens.”
---
Anyway, I saw several new players today that cane by my camp. All from level 3-15. One guy I dropped 12 different free serums to play with or sell when he asked me if I’d reduce the price on my Marsupial from 267 to 150 as that was all he had. 
---
Another asked me to mod his level 5 gun. I modded it and gave him 2k ammo and some serums. 
---
Just because people can be assholes on an internet chat board (myself included) doesn’t mean we have to be dicks to new players. It’s mutually exclusive.
---
[removed]
---
My thoughts.
---
Like when you say dont touch,9/10 wont touch,the other 1 will,always.
---
Some people love fu\*\*ing with people.
---
Oh good. If that was my frame rate while playing I'd probably destroy alot of controllers
---
I just got fist and got the ranger outfit and advance ranger outfit. Where is the paint? It's nowhere in my atomic shop and both armors say they can have paint when at a workbench. Is it gone?
---
Edit: also the advance ranger is advertised as green but mine is clearly brown with no available paints.
---
Yeah. Thatd be a little more enticing. That and make power armor not trash. Ugh I cant stand the fact my character with a backpack can hold 60 more pounds than my X01 armor. I wanna have OP power armor and hold a lot than have to wear excavator to hold a lot. I agree excavator should keep the boost of extra carry weight but a fricking 205 weght limit in x01 armor is TRASH.
---
Boxes full of trash loot
---
Wait... WUT!??!?

DMV? Or something else. If something else don’t tell me what.

---
Yes, pleeease.   Always happens with the metal staircases.
---
Weird. The game is stable in my system. But yes... This game consumes a lot of RAM and you need have a lot of space assigned to the pagefile system. I needed low the graphics before increase my pagefile, now is running fine. That also help to my random CTD on others games from steam.
---
I am the strongest super mutant!
---
Tried this and mining the veins isnt respawning anything
---
Something else. I'll put it in a spoiler in case you change your mind later.
---
&gt;!There's a newspaper on the base commander's desk; give it a read, and think like a frightened conspiracy theorist that's learned too much.!&lt;
---
Thats nothing compared to my Executioners shovel
---
Dang you can kill em AND bury em with it. Dualistic tools!
---
Exactly lmao
---
Ah!  Perfecto, thanks.
---
Your welcome, happy hunting!
---
Sorry it took me song long. Getting my build rn
---
This.
---
Soon as i saw this happen i would be done.
---
Nice
---
haha, yeah. ping today is pretty bad tho
---
Yes. After a long while. Best way is to server hop and find it where it hasn't been looted yet.
---
I agree with that. I only do pve too unless I absolutely have to protect myself. If I accidentally shoot somebody I usually stop to let them take me, usually they dont. Id try to do a different build, but it's usually the game itself I get bored of. I switch between games when I do. I get stuck on one game once I start playin one. Like I used to play destiny on ps3, but now Im playin on xb1 from new and it's fun for now lol. It's another grinding game. Mainly pve, but it has a domination like mode on it that adds a pvp theme to it which is fun and cool. It's not very rage inducing either.
---
Perfect, thank you, i just server hopped 5 times and got nothing but good to know it responds
---
Each thing you made is probably worth five or six caps a piece at a robot vendor.
---
Same here!
---
I found a random package at the Herald recently...
---
I honestly think a steam release is more likely than official mod support. Since mods would interfere with their cash shop. There are already people making cosmetic/replacement mods unofficially. And there's already efforts of people trying to make their own servers, something i highly doubt will work out and I absolutely wouldn't recommend anyone joining one because they could easily steal your info. It's been done and currently being done with some of those GTA5 custom public servers.
---
I think the assumption about wastelanders and Steam has merit though. Bethesda has already proven their lack of communication prowess. With holding that information is something they'd totally do. But I wouldn't say it's a for sure thing. More like a 50/50 thing. or 70/30 thing, 70 being the conspiracy real.
---
Its *almost* if no one wanted some crappy open world pvp game.
---
There are a ton of assholes on the servers, you just haven't run into them yet.
---
I’m sorry.  He sounds like a real scumbag.

Have you played fallout online? The other fallout mmo

Please sign this waiver and I'll take care of it.
---
TNT Dome 7
---
Yes! Tired of getting useless ammo I just have to dump since I can't sell it :/
---
That's a bug in the game
---
I know. I'm just saying the whole team shouldn't be aggro because one guy has a bounty.
---
That is a huge development. Going to personally test this with a few guys I know with stranglecpu armor. Not a Ryzen user, but, it crashes me nonetheless. Thanks for all your modding work, Keretus.
---
That bad? I’ve listened to what the others have said, I’ve gotten to level 7. It seems a lot like FO4 and hasn’t yet captured my attention really. ADS seems slow is my biggest complaint besides since hitting level 5 that everyone seems to swarm to me.
---
I get about 15-20 per play session on each character. You just have to go to each of the fissure sites and start mining the ultracite veins. For me I get about 5 per vein that I mine and I get a ton of festive scorched that way. I got two plasma grenade plans in one night and I actually got those from a small holiday gift. I haven’t gotten any of the Christmas plans yet but that’s what I’m grinding for.
---
Yeah, something to identify legendary bodies would be great. I killed a legendary Gusty near a car and when it blew, the body went flying. Took me a few minutes to find it.
---
I believe it was only available for a limited time. I guess you already checked the atom shop under the "skins" section? I'm not sure, I got mine right when it became available.
---
If it's not there, they may bring it back around eventually.
---
You just need to do more damage.
---
You have to do enough damage to the SBQ before you get loot - its something Bethesda did to prevent low levels from getting easy SBQ loot unfortunately.
---
Thanks Keretus. Maybe I should send my sub money to you instead of Bethesda ;)
---
No its nothing like that, lol
---
Huh that’s weird. All my shots were to the head of the SBQ while it was on the ground. I was hitting it with a Handmade Rifle and It showed I was doing lots of damage. Thanks for letting me know
---
You mean vendor bots not player vendors right? Cause my gf pulled a bffr tesla out of a players vending machine for 400 caps a few nights ago. Those were exceptionally useful caps imo
---
What's "lots of damage"?
---
You can turn on damage numbers to see how much you're actually doing.  You need to do \~1,500 damage to qualify for loot from the Queen's corpse.
---
Someone else has to spawn into the zone before you do, that hasn't looted it recently (nearest fast travel will do).  Then you can grab out,  and this can be repeated
---
Humans we $#@&amp; up everything.
---
32gb of ddr4 and 11gb ddr5 on my video card. You're right that frequent crashes could be related to memory, GPU, or even power supply... the problem with that us that it assumes I have issues with any other software, which I don't. Even Fallout 4, heavily modded, runs dreamy.
---
Yeah my first thought was that it was limited but I just wanted to see if anyone knew for sure. But thanks for the info.
---
Took me ages to work that out. I'd be hammering the SQ with my pea shooter and wondering why I ended up with nothing.
---
Oh ok. I will turn it on. But using the health bar for the SBQ it showed me taking out Atleast a star. But maybe It’s just damage from all the players
---
Wow... so glad im not on PC. That shits ridiculous.
---
My chest as well.wouldnr surprise me if it's a bug.
---
I got banned for a month from this sub for sharing info on a hacker. Even though everyone knew him. This sub is not gonna help.
---
Definitely something Bethesda should be cracking down on and it's a bit insane that they haven't. As it stands Nuclear Winter seems utterly pointless if you're playing on PC.
---
I tried to level up a new character without any help from my other accounts no team ect. Was trying to remember how it felt the first time around. Not long into this experiment I broke down and in a dark desperate moment bought ammo from one of those things. It was sickening, wasting the last of my measly caps for another 5 minutes of survival.
---
I even have a fucking video. But I can’t post it since it’s “witch hunting.” That rule does way more harm than it prevents.
---
The drops most likely do not have equal chances, that way you have better odds of getting something good. I suspect it's from a loot pool. Maybe they insert a percentage of the more desirable rolls into each server's pool, which is accessible to every player, or its player dependant too. I've had identical 2\* weapons from the Purveyor (not in the same session), and a couple of days ago, got 2 1\* ultracite gatling laser drops with identical condition back to back.
---
Duping is everywhere, since the game was released, which is probably why people ask for such specific weapons or armor, someone has duped that roll at some point in the game's history.
---
Anyone remember the post about the location but had photos up? I'm new so if you could tell me that would be great :)
---
Awesomeness!
---
I donated some 3 star heavy weapons... And sold 1 star heavy shit to the vendors. Too many legendarys dropping now. I'm still chalka block full of scripts.
---
What do you mean?
---
I want to break down my ammo for ammo crafting
---
Kurt Cobain disagrees.
---
Winding Palace gave me 5. Yes 5.
---
This is so cute! I love it
---
having this same issue with the gf.  keeps kicking me because 'im not friends with the world owner'
---
If you believe that regularly interacting with the sort of guy who funds someone else's gaming with ulterior motivations isn't "work", why aren't you giving it a shot? ;)
---
Or “dm me for free stuff.” If I got good low level gear I normally chase the low levels around the map dropping them the good stuff I find.
---
Some people are assholes.
---
I think he meant 15 XD
---
Not gonna argue with that. Lol. Not a big fan of people myself.
---
The Bar is its health, so if it is dropping it is not based on your damage alone.
---
I mean the white part kept getting bigger after I would shoot it. I hope u know what I mean
---
Everybody shoots at it. 
---
Turn your damage numbers on.
---
It happens on ps4 to
---
Thanks mate, still waiting for Bethesda to email back. Cheers
---
I have the same problem, on PC.
---
Can't find any settings, where are you toggling this?
---
What on Tod Howard's name he want with a fake account? Just drive people nuts?
---
I just remembered when the game first came out I started playing and it kept crashing. Idk it mightve just been me though.
---
Intresting
---
When you click play and it takes you to the screen to select the mode you want. Then once I select Private it showed an option at the bottom - on Xbox it has you click x to toggle it but I’m not sure what you click on pc
---
It crashes rarely for me. Been playing since faschnact
---
I agree
---
Server hopping on private isn't a thing--they intentionally bring you back to the same server, as it's yours.  This is a good thing, however, I use it all the time to swap gear between alt characters.
---
There were a lot of dupers since then a lot have been shut down. Most of the dupe methods are patched...I play on my own server mostly so I have no lag
---
OPK is really popular now. Basically people use a script that makes it so every player and NPC can be teleported in front of them since hit boxes are client sided
---
It does have a "grow" option.  It's a little clunky, but not too bad.
---
More importantly did you use Wesley Pipes or Billy Bong Thornton
---
At this rate there shouldn't be rewards exclusive to NW if the issue isn't going to be addressed. Just doesn't make any sense.
---
Though for free xp weekend, there isn't much stopping people from making burner accounts to pull these stunts.
---
Whole thing is a crap shoot.
---
It's easier to trace people's computers than people may think.  They should have enough network logs unless the person has some more extreme network skills and has bounced their network around, it's traceable.
---
I did, and nothings happened. I still see him online. If the community would be able to share these videos, we’d have more outcry, and Bethesda would be more inclined to fix it. At the moment, it’s pointless to even record and submit.
---
Alright.  Let me know what they say.
---
Level of intoxication isn't the issue here. It's the hypocrisy of condoning one drug(A significantly more dangerous drug) and condemning another and actions of trolling while intoxicated that are questionable.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Unarmed weapons are already uber powerful. If you want it to be a sidegrade, buff attack speed by 30%, but reduce damage by 50%
---
15 is not the max
---
Edit - I’ll be polite and explain; you can buff your character beyond 15. My Stealth rifleman has 4 base Strength before buffs, but 23 after unyielding armor, minor legendary effects, Radicool, etc, are applied.
---
You mean your camp couldn't be placed?   You're not permanently 'evicted', just change servers and your camp will be back.
---
I'm glad you're trying the game and enjoying it and the community. There are very few ways to *actually* grief someone in 76. Most accusations of "griefing" come from players who don't understand the game mechanics (ie workshop PvP) or fail to remove themselves from the situation (block and server hop).
---
I love that you refer to your gaming console as your wife, I do this too. You should turn her on more frequently so you don't need to wait for so many updates before you can play with her.
---
They may indeed hate Bethesda for reasons and have found a way to get their own back (they think).
---
If it was written with the neon letters unless they're some sort of fo76 prodigy it's probably not someone new. Those freaking things are expensive.
---
Nope. Got a bunch of 40 power attack and reflect types. I don't melee but I know power attack is good.
---
I think one spawns in Berkeley springs at the building at the very end
---
It's likely a disposable account that's being used to farm the rewards and sell them for cash.
---
You need to take this down. The mods banned me for posting evidence of a hacker. It sucks but if you want to avoid a month ban, you’ve gotta delete this.
---
Edit: and literally as I was posting this. He took out an entire game of people. The subs rules need to change.
---
I feel like since they did for thanksgiving they might for Christmas so I’m saving my scrip for now
---
Saves me the cost of a paper bag
---
Congrats! Hail Mothman
---
Funnily enough both games I'm not interested in..
---
Awesome i work swing shift so most of my play time is before 2:30 pm pst!
---
Why not both!
---
Are they misc tab? I got both but only took a quick glance.
---
Its FATMANDEUCE. Im always down to play
---
I bought out all sizes from all four vendors 3 different times.
---
Its basically a skin but in order to put it down you have to remove the normal one and place the santa one. The normal collection will bring presents to you if you change it in the terminal.
---
The OP will get removed but just report him in the help website for Bethesda with evidence provided. You can upload images to the ticket.
---
That would be awesome😂😂😂😂 FAT_MAN_DEUCE my psn
---
FAT_MAN_DEUCE
---
Ban me idgaf tbh. this reddit is full of stories of the crap going on and we continue to see this BS. This reddit is as bad as the game anymore.
---
Ohh awesome, thanks!
---
So you can build one Santatron per workshop as well. I've had around 10 or so on a private server and didn't see any presents on any of them. Could just be bad luck but I've decided Santatron is not worth it. Can farm up almost a dozen in about 30 minutes if you are lucky from scortched.
---
Ive sent pics videos along with every single NW player ive played with today.
---
Dont call people out by name. 
---
Submit your evidence to Bethesda not reddit.
---
There's no Beth employees that are going to see this here.  Even the Community Managers can't help you if they happen to see this.
---
Post to the Bethesda Support Page and file a ticket.  It sounds like a broken record, I know.   But it's the only way to get the information to them.
---
since you own a collecton you can use it as a santa or a regular collecton 
---
people who dont own a collectron already can only use it in santa mode
---
Youre welcome!  Only thing that makes the santatron almost worth it is the things it says other than that its nothing special.
---
I would not have come here if I didnt think it was beyond ridiculous at this point dozens of players have. Videos pics reports twitter etc. its been all day. Nothing.
---
Thank you
---
Has a different loot pool, but can only switch to Collectron's if you bought Collectron
---
I've definitely seen a bump in legendary as well.  That's saying something because scorched normally have the lowest legendary spawn rate when I'm farming. So bad, I normally just ignore them when I get them. Now it's not uncommon for me to see one or two mixed in with additional Santa ones. Getting something like 20 an hour right now. Been dropping off lots of care packages to new freebie accounts.
---
Thx :)

Gotcha
---
I hit the limit for scrip and oh man it was a bad idea to buy more legendaries from the vendor. That's what got me into my weight issue. I bought legendaries just to use up my scrip and forgot three star legendaries are worth 40 scrip...
---
It’s so easy to mod the game and now with the free weekend it’s even easier. It lined up perfectly with the release of a script to spawn in any item you want, as well as get 5* legendaries and make custom legendaries
---
&gt; I can't trade them in since my scrip daily limit is 12 now. 
---
Wait, what? Please tell me I'm misreading this, and you mean you have 12 script left before you hit your limit, not that your daily limit is 12 script.
---
I having been crashing when I’m alone facing high leveled enemies recently, it has happened before in the past but now it seems like the crashes are starting to get more frequent this entire week. Maybe it’s the console I’m using (Xbox One) or maybe it’s just horrible game design. I’m not sure.
---
big man lol
---
Ask him for a BE15R Fixer.
---
I still use my TSE pump action for control/crippling. The biggest problem is mobs that close the gap fast like ghouls. Ended up taking 3 points of Adamantium Skeleton so I never get crippled myself.
---
I love you but we need to get you to the doctor.
---
It’s a lawless Wasteland brother
---
The Queen isn't like any other mob; you can't just tag her and get a drop. At a guess, I'd say you were under the minimum damage threshold for loot.
---
Good to know. Thanks OP!
---
Just incredible, thanks a lot 🤩💝
---
I play on PS4 and interactions I'd consider toxic or hostile have been maybe 1% of the total. The people I've encountered in this game have been friendly on the level that I went from actively avoiding interaction with other players to seeking out opportunities to say hi, drop some gifts, team up, etc.
---
 (I don't consider people attempting to murder me for a workshop to be hostile &amp; view it as a game mechanic that is just not designed well for people who want to practice building camps or other non-PvP activities.)
---
Nah I mean it gives me a message, saying your camp can't be placed because of a Fallout Update has reserved the space or something. Tried changing servers multiple times, same message. You get 1 free move. I have been evicted before, above white springs in the mountains I got evicted and near Camden park as well.
---
You may want to log onto your router as admin and check if there are any new firmware updates that need to be applied. I had an issue like yours a few months back, but updating and rebooting the router resolved it.
---
It'll crash occasionally, but nothing like it used to.
---
Thanks
---
Hm I'll definitely have to check it out when I get back. My plasmas might have just gotten a lot better lol
---
I'm on PC, I'm afraid. This game really needs cross play.
---
You can not put the skins on a small backpack. You have to complete the order of the tadpole quest line to craft a true backpack, twice the carry weight and will allow skins
---
Spend about 150 a day at the Purveyor and float the rest. I know a lot of people are doing the same.
---
There's an exploit on PC that can instantly kill the SBQ - its not even legacies, its actually worse than that.
---
2/2 matches tonight had cheaters. good times going for 3/3 now Z:
---
Bethesda's not going to do anything based on a Reddit post, but the moderators will ban you for violating rule 9. You should take this down.
---
It's... odd. If you have the Collectron already, it's just a skin. If you don't have the Collectron, however, it'll only ever collect coal, fertilizer, and the occasional toy. No scrap, no junk. So don't worry, you didn't waste you ATOMs.
---
Ok
---
Are the black and red fire breathers uniform and helmet really that rare?  I got them early on, and somehow I ended up with the fire breather helmets.
---
Bruh you better be careful fucking with a Nine Trey like that, you’ll end up in a body bag in a 6ix9ine music video
---
No you get that from a quest early in the game
---
I'd be tempted to keep responding, just to see how determined he was to get the last word. xD
---
Thank you for listing the specific items you get, I was wondering what everyone meant by Santa junk lol :)
---
12 scrip left.
---
Also Joseph_StaIin and Maln_EIement are hacking too, seems like a big hacker convention
---
The joy of PC
---
Level of the gift they drop doesn't have anything to do with the box they drop for you. Just the legendary item that they're carrying.
---
Welcome to the game and enjoy your stay! :)
---
Not weird
---
Hmm now i all I have to do is hope for a fatman skin that makes the blast red white and blue with murica comic text
---
I’ve hit 2 in Helvetia just taking the parade route. Easy pickings. My big success is one shotting those guys at Wavy Willard’s I’ve gotten up to 5 legendary Santa’s in one swoop. 
---
But all these low levels just drop the small presents. 
---
So maybe glassed caverns will drop better loot since higher levels?
---
I got served down there after one shotting all the scorched in the forest for hours.
---
No problem! :D
---
I had a grim feeling it'd be the whole empty pumpkin rack all over again. But I wanted to share to let people know it is being dropped. I was close to not doing so, because I felt as if it might come off as me "gloating" :( But I'm glad I did :D
---
I only got 1 up there earlier. But water park gave me 5.
---
I’ve had luck getting responses from twitter DMs. Hit up @Bethesda and @Fallout with a TL:DR and photos and you might get a response
---
I you haven't already bought it, how did you play survival?
---
Same here, 3 different server hops, 3 Santa’s each time on the rooftops.
---
Had my third match and no blatant cheater and more than 30 players wow
---
Brilliant :)
---
First missions have you get the virus and find a method to fix any problems with you dna caused by radiation
---
Just ended a match of a hacker couple. Both shooting at the walls and getting kills or firing in the air.One of the pair had a crossbow that kept going and was on rapid fire.  
---
Total of reported 3 hackers tonight.
---
Yeah, that's the guy that I posted about earlier.
---
Pity I can't play this game for more than 2 minutes before I get a server error and it kicks me back to the main menu.
---
I'm not kidding, the longest it's lasted so far was about 1 minute and 40 seconds.
---
There's nothing wrong with my internet, I can stream movies, play other multiplayer games, download, everything works fine, except this one game.
---
It is and I never do this. I feel bad because I love this game the community etc and Bethesda for that matter but all day. We are all trying to get the double XP rewards and enjoy the game this weekend. As I write this two more ppl did it in this game.
---
Just seen your name in my NW match (Lucius_FSD is mine) you definitely seen the two people doing what they did.
---
Just seen them just now.
---
They re probably played using someone else's system to try it out but gave up?
---
Works just fine for me but I have a mixed set with some marine.  Are you sure you aren't suppressed by a Radaway?  Also it only works when you keep still and have your weapon drawn.
---
The stalin name isnt even that funny
---
Then you shan't play FO76 again 😥
---
How much did it cost at the end and was it worth it ?
---
Thank’s for that, I didn’t really know what I was missing.
---
Take it to a more active social media (Bethesda’s Twitter, Instagram, Facebook).  I assure you corporations HATE having negativity pop up on those sites because it’s so much more damaging than on a geek page like our Reddit where it’s expected.  If you want real prompt results...go there.  You’ll see a much more efficient response because they are afraid the public will see...they don’t fear that here.
---
No problem. It's a common mistake. They should put a disclaimer in the backpack skins
---
D’oh! I have mixed feelings on that one. I have NEVER gotten anything good from her. I’d rather sell things off at a price point that someone else feels like they got a deal and I get the caps to search for exactly what I’m looking for (all the mole miner gauntlets). Great suggestion on the Ammosmith!
---
Yeah I just ended a match with them, Shooting in the air. Reported the hacker couple.
---
You do know why right?  If you need to craft the stash box is first on the preference list so if you want to keep non-loose junk items in your scrap box you must be very careful when using workbenches.  I tend to keep a small stock of the loose junk as the items I want to store - like acid to protect my bug parts.
---
I was able to trade for the icicle lights. So now I’m gonna start saving the presents for Christmas
---
No suppressed or any of some sort, i have 3 metal and 2 marine, whenever i put  either or both of the marine piece it just breaks the effect..
---
I am not going to lie to you, I don’t know who Nine Trey is, but I def don’t want to end up in as much trouble as 6ix9ine 😂
---
I'm on EST and am on usually once the daughter is off to school and the wife's at work. Only good thing about working overnight weekends, I get to be home when everybody else is at work lol. I'll be on tomorrow morning for a few as well as Monday starting around 4am your time. Usually I'll go most of the day playing and getting content together for a channel with some friends. My PSN id's are east376 (my main) and also have a content account with the PSN ChadMackGaming (also same GT on Xbox).
---
Just got off an hour session across the map. No crash for me.
---
the game uses the components in your stash first, not the scrap box. even if you haven't broken them down.
---
I was in West Tek the other day and it was haunted by an underwear-wearing supermutant that would sort of glide around and pass through walls.  Couldn't interact with it.  I didn't know what to think.   Other than to feel relief for the underwear.
---
Ok sounds good i most likely cant play tomorrow got the 8am shift but monday ill be on at about 12 your time ill add you and send you a message on psn! Thanks!!
---
Agreed im hoping it will happen sooner then later like whwn if wver we get the wastelander dlc
---
Be careful posting this stuff here, mods are always on a witch hunt for people who post names of cheaters/scammers
---
Thanks for this!!  
---
If you don't mind, curious what the "root" of the issue was, and wondering what other similar problems exist out there....
---
I was, but also they seemed like they don’t know how to have a conversation so whatever. I was waiting for a response back to “K” but never got one.
---
Could be your Xbox mine does it every now and then too my Xbox lags hard in scorch queen battles
---
SERIOUSLY !!  Well that is just shit!!
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
No text chat of any kind on PC :(
---
Also joseph_stalin and main_element were cheating
---
Congrats!  Looks awesome!
---
I will be able to make the power armor tomorrow morning if he still needs it
---
Did exactly that. I hate doing this is rather enjoy the game. And I understand how hard it is to fish these ppl out at times. But to be this obvious all damn day is sick. I posted on Twitter and Instagram.
---
Apparently.... just learning this now 😖
---
Thank You
---
Use your vendors or display cases. Junk items in those will not get touched.
---
Yea I got into a match with joseph_stalin and main_element they were hacking
---
Everything. Yes.
---
If you want to protect junk items you can put into your vendor at max caps. Unless someone wants to pay 25k for a stingwing barb
---
Oh hey, I didn't notice earlier, but that's the guy I posted about too.
---
We will never have cross platform because of this. I feel like we are the stillborn battle Royale of the community.
---
For me on ps4 crashes are a rarity.  Maybe one every 50 hours of game play.
---
That clue isn’t new. Been there quite a while. I noticed it a long time back and it stuck out because it just SEEMED out of place, considering.
---
Don't say the names or you will be banned on the reddit
---
Well shit, if any1 does .... GT is BITE 1T
---
Come on by 😎
---
I remember seeing a post here where somebody outlined how the cooldown things work.  The high-level takeaway I remember was basically picking up lots of stuff helps flush out the historical context, and make sure to mix up where you go.  The more variety of sites you visit between farming a given location, the better it is.
---
And this history is tied to your character, not necessarily the server, so server hopping doesn't actually help as much as people would like.
---
I spent many month on ps4 and I moved to pc recently, on both platforms I can confirm the community is nice. All the toxicity and BS you see here on anywhere else is mainly made by toxic people that stopped playing a long time ago, or never played at all.
---
I understand and will probably earn a temp ban but this is rediculous. I usually toe the line but when it's this long and this bad it's got to be said
---
Assholes. They’re called assholes.
---
Go to the social tab and then find the player in recents. Report them and it will create a ticket. Go then to  [https://help.bethesda.net/app/account/overview](https://help.bethesda.net/app/account/overview)  to add details or screenshots.
---
Not my proudest fap.
---
Go to Bethesda's support site and file a ticket is really only the way to report it. Add screenshots/vids as well when asked.
---
These people doing this clearly have a small brain.
---
Yes. That is why my project this weekend is to bring my total characters who are lvl 50+ to 5 and bank 1K in each. Made it from the three I already had to 4 today and level 21 on #5. Two are already maxed for scrip. By the end of next weekend I will have 5K scrip ready to go if all goes well. 3K on \*\*\* guns, 1K on \*\*\* armor and 1K on \*\* guns. I've already got unbeatable melee.
---
The bug that was canceling UNY is fixed.
---
I’m fine with it collecting basketballs and toy cars. I always need more rubber and screws.
---
Don't state the names, just report them in game. Rule 9.
---
Yeah, I had my own encounter.
---
Shall do.
---
Respawn at 76 only was never fixed.
---
Mole rats.
---
Just bad luck.  They are on both.
---
Had to read the title again to understand the joke x) take my upvote
---
Like everyone said first point gets you 20%, each point after that is only 10%. It also only effects the explosive portion of the weapon which is 20% base damage. So for example your weapon does 120 damage. 100 is base 20 is explosive. So 1 rank of demo expert is going to get you 4 extra damage. 5 ranks is 12 damage.
---
Well, shockingly, the guy is a shithead.  Who would have guessed?
---
I doubt Sony will ever do anything like that for any Bethesda title they don't seem to play nice
---
People like this dont deserve the courtesy of having their screenname blocked out. They deserved to be mocked for their laughable behavior.
---
Got one by doing the escort event at the prison.
---
Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
Max for base.  Not once you start using the right perks, equipment and food/drinks/chems
---
If I can get the plasma nade plan while the event is on, I’ll be a happy CAMPer.
---
Nope even with the free weekend.
---
It's a bug. I've had multiple pieces of weightless that didn't work, about 25%. At least a couple was marine, but there were others also.
---
I dont know what issue people seem to have with shotguns but I run an instigating explosive double barrel through west tek and I 1 hit 99% of stuff. The other 1% take the second round. I run all 3 max shotgun perks bloody mess adrenaline and demo expert maxed. But never have any issues with my shotgun.
---
Damnn apparently theres no way of knowing whether it worked or not unless we try it first
---
Works for me - 2 marine, 2 scout, 1 trapper, all weightless.  Just make sure you don't confuse any Chameleon armor as being weightless.  Its easy enough to mix up the effects - I know I once tried to sell an Executioner's grenade launcher as Bloodied (very embarrassing trade).
---
I actually have the recipe for it: “Recipe: Jet”
---
Hasn’t been implemented yet and likely won’t be, has no use either.
---
Source: I’m a collector of weird and wacky things in the wasteland (PC) and I run a museum of it all for fun.
---
I don't think so, I think it is strictly from imposter event. If your on PC send me a message I have one
---
No but a red nose radstag should be right around the bend
---
Could be quietly adding things from wastelanders?
---
Ive got over 10 recall curcuit boards to do encrypted with.
---
I see, well i guess its pretty uncertain then, i had 2 marine,2 metal and 1 combat, whenever I equipped the marines the effect just breaks
---
Definitely want a solution for this annoyance
---
Furious shotgun add 5% per pellet hit. It means if you land all pellets of your first shot, the next will benefit from the 45% (max) damage increase on the same target.
---
This on PC? If so I’d be down.
---
Haha
---
Thanks for the mention Rabid. Any vault dwellers near the area just East of Grafton Steel stop on by and feed the reindeer. They're just dressers, but feel free to throw carrots at them. (I'm not responsible for any diseases or death that may occur from feeding or sitting on the reindeer) Happy Holidays
---
Yeah, sorry, having one of those days.
---
I'm talking about the dispensers at the train station.  They want like 5 caps for a shotgun shell, and have a total inventory of about 20 shells.
---
It definitely depends. I have a quad capacity double barrel that I use for the scorched and they can be taken down easily and I use the recoil like I’m firing a real shotgun. I think they should be buffed, but taking into consideration of what a shotgun does and how it reacts when being used should be considered too.
---
The cap limit of 30k has literally cost me well over 30k in player vending. 
---
I understand why the cap is in place but at this point, it really needs to be raised to the 100k mark.
---
Kill players. Not a popular answer but it’s how I do it and it is both the most time efficient and lucrative way. 
---
You get paid caps for killing players, and you get junk if they have any, and I’d say out of 10 player kills you will get 150 ballistic fiber.
---
If you don’t have a proper PvP weapon make a gamma gun, make it automatic, and then use it in vats to kill. The radiation damage is something most people cannot handle and is the most viable non-legendary weapon relative to its cost.
---
Asking the real questions here.
---
This isn’t a “glitch” - Scorched are intended to spawn when the ore is picked. So this is just smart farming, really.
---
(Not sure what the point of the going through once and dying was though. That wasn’t necessary at all.)
---
Potato potatoe , call it what you want mate either way it’s unintentional to work this way... clearly
---
And you go through regularly first to get the most bang for your buck obviously
---
I like the sound of that.. but the only times I find FO76 rage inducing is when I can't do something I should be able to do because of a bug. I could give examples but you know what I mean, there's so many of them, it's like having favourite shoes except they are slippery in the wet, the laces keep coming undone, stones get caught in the tread and they really should be replaced but they are just so comfortable xD
---
I got radworms from Rudolph.
---
Ive gotten large presents from the low level guys as well.
---
Yeah? Well you gave Blitzen the whoopsies and sludge lung so we're even!
---
Okay, mine isn't, but thank you for the heads up!
---
This was a very sad day for FO76 and NW. Too bad Bethesda does not have a single soul monitoring this game during the free trial. I am sure this guy has been reported hundreds of times. It is becoming pointless to play, unfortunately.
---
I agree not enough roof decorations
---
I collect stuff like that. Tse pipe pistol makes leveling up up a new alt much easier. Armor too. I have some unyeilding leather armor level 5 and chameleon leather chest lvl 1. Without perks it not too impressive, but way better than than vanilla.
---
Not yet, I think we're getting those plastic trees in the next atom shop update. Also the charlie brown Christmas tree in Nuclear Winter
---
48428717
---
Blitzen got what he deserved.
---
They're updated [here](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/fallout-76-nuke-codes/) all the time :D
---
[Try this.](https://nukacrypt.com/) Has all the launch codes, updated weekly.
---
Try 48428717
---
Can't say I've had this happen, sorry.
---
What system you play on? I’ll pay good caps to get this placed ;-;
---
Nope. You can get large gifts from level 1s.
---
I'm on PC :o 
---
I have a good amount of plans unlocked, and happy to give some to you if you don't have them already! :o
---
This is true.  To expand a little - the perk point you get to spend when you achieve level 15, for example, can only be used on cards *up to level 15.*   So if you have 3 perk points to spend, you have to use them, then you'll finally see martial artist become available when you've spent the lower level points.   
---
The game doesn't bother explaining that to you so often new players think it's luck or chance and continue leveling up and not spending points and not understanding what's going on.  IE don't feel alone, this happens a lot!
---
Bethesda’s shit game, full of shit microtransactions and shitty bugs is full of shitty hackers
---
That's nuts! Oh man, it's so cool reading that people are getting some nice af drops from the jingly bois :'D
---
I told you your sense of humour is too obscure Biff xD
---
You can disregard my reply. I looked at the post more closely and realized that i really misinterpreted what it was about. Sorry about that.
---
Yea it keeps you motivated lol. You can only get so much script..so after that it sucks. But every once in a while mr. Bojingle blesses you lol
---
&gt;   I totally agree with you , but what can we do ? 
---
I don't know. I'm kind of at my wits end with Bethesda.  Their actions of late have become completely incomprehensible to me.  It's like the people running the company have lost their damn minds.
---
Despite all the negative press on this game. I have enjoyed it and keep playing it.
---
I do wish that Bugthesda would correct some of the more persistent problems but we may all have to face the fact that they won't: how many bugs are still in play on Skyrim and Fallout 4?
---
I need to find you, can you play tomorrow
---
Hes moved over to OCE nuclear winter. Wiped my whole team in 10 seconds from some AoE infinite range auto-lock on bullet.
---
Booo!!
---
I have found that I get more holiday scorched out of lower level groups of them. I got 10 out of poseidon on 2 separate runs, but only 4 out of thunder mountain and big bend tunnel together.
---
Strange. I have an SSD in literally everything I own besides my ps4 and it improved literally everything. Stutters, install/downloads, opening stuff, load times and in general performance.
---
Survival mode, atleast on PS4, was dead af. It was just the same 5 people wacking each other off over and over. The concept of what it should have been never came to be.
---
You've never made a post and here you are
---
Dang I’m sorry :(
---
I'm on xbox, I can put it up for you if you catch me on.
---
When are you on? I’m in right now and will be for a while
---
I use the Responder Fireman Uniform and Helmet.
---
Why even play!? What’s the point? You know that’s a bogus account since he’s level 25 he just started that one at the start of double xp. What a weirdo.
---
His english is terrible, that's for sure. I always keep a weak weapon on me if I'm running public events, just to make sure I don't 1 shot anything.
---
Not surprised.
---
Explorer's Outfit + Green Hood + Gask Mask with Goggles 😊
---
Tuxedo and Bowler hat, with a Bloody Walking Cane.
---
Thanks ! I’ll try and look for it
---
It's straight up embarrassing that Bethesda hasn't done anything about this. Literally all weekend just like the OP said. God what a total fail on Bethesdas part
---
With all these taxidermy drops, wish there was a Mounted Rudolph head.
---
Every update fixes problems and brings new ones. Crashes is way way less than it was the first few months. But like another commenter said.  Usually server side crashes happens when duper’s are out and about.
---
I was rocking the Travelling Leather Coat and Halloween skull mask until I accidentally scrapped the leather coat :( Called it the murder mask and ended up wearing the Hunters Long Coat with it for a while.
---
Now I'm rocking the clean spacesuit and bunny mask lol. But the most fun I've had is a hipster setup that I made. flannel shirt and jeans, grey knit cap, and black-rim glasses lol.
---
76 caps a pop my tags SHMAGMYER
---
Why do weapons and armours even have spots for 5 stars? There’s only ever max 3 and for the longest time I thought there was better legendaries than what I was finding.
---
PC communities are notorious for hackers.  Thats why I only play on consoles
---
That's what I'm guessing. I figured drops and sales would stop but I'd like to hold onto some for fun.
---
You on PS4? I have a 2 hunters long coats in my stash right now. 5k and it's yours.
---
Driveable cars... One day... 😏
---
Ouch. Why did it take so long? Do you not know where they come from?
---
Glorious! Thank you very much.
---
This bug was just sad.
---
Very nice early Christmas present :)
---
Great idea
---
Demo expert definitely does boost dmg with explosive weapons. Pretty sure grenadier does not since it's not a throwable explosive, but I could be wrong.
---
Yeah know the feeling!
---
Been vending all my "known" plans for 0 caps, but sometimes a lvl +100 comes along and clears out my shop. Even taking multiple copies of the same plan regardless of my "Take what you need, leave the rest" sign right next to the vending machines… Come on nobody "needs" seven Baked Bloatfly Recipie :(
---
Agreed. We long term players love the game despite legitimate issues with it. We muscle through because of the community.
---
I heard that the players themselves need to be of a high enough level to be eligible for certain rewards.
---
Thats freaking great!.... Wish I had that kind of selfcontrol … ;)
---
Damn if your on xbox I’ll buy that sucker off of you for sure!
---
Sadly i am not, but i know a certain mole miner that will buy it from me ay lmao
---
I bet you can get 5k for that thing EASY!
---
Damn bruh never thought of that, guess ill have to hold out on selling it to the purveyor to make a profit
---
You ErectusDeletus.
---
I hope so, I'm maxed out on script, so many legendaries...
---
Have you tried creating another character?
---
Are the Items that can be unlocked for Adventure mode account wide or only per character?
---
He had a gun in the vault!!?? How does Bethesda not ban his IP or something!?
---
I just got the Mounted Mothman plan today by making my own gifts too. I used the high quality wrapping paper. I also got the icicle lights plan today.
---
Thank god I'm not on PC. Besides, never been keen on Nuclear Winter,anyway. Only playing it during the double XP weekend to level up quick  and get 2 goals I've been aiming for the rewards. Level 10 for the Overseer Chair (done) and Level 12 for the Bronze NW Trophy. After that, proably never touch it again.
---
The high quality wrap is what I was using too! :D Oohh! I'm still yet to find those, but heres to hoping they'll pop up soon! :D
---
Pretty sure account wide; theyre listed at atom shop items when you unlock them so they shoild transfer through all characters on your account
---
Nope. There were lit ones in the atom shop
---
This guy has been playing all day and ruining the matches.  Spawning guns in the Vault, literally flying 1000 feet in the air and AOE killing people in match.  How worthless is your game if it can't even detect and ban OBVIOUS hacks like that?
---
LOL that dude was level one earlier today...
---
Oh okay thank u but do u have any advice for the floor problem?
---
For what I suggested, it’s definitely less viable, than brown, but definitely more skillful to get away with. There’s a skin tone that almost exactly matches some of the best bushes for camping. I believe it’s the darkest skin tone
---
I know demolition affected the shotgun if it had an explosive perk, but I heard somewhere that they either fixed it or nerfed it because the build was super broken. As for the grenadier perk it just says explosive weapons. Not throwables. But do you know if they nerfed it? That's what I am wondering.
---
Not script limit, the game will be flooded with all types of weapons and they will devalue
---
I am going to ask the silly question, did you already try clicking any of your floors and foundations, and cycling left/right to see if they appear in the list of options?
---
Reject the quest and try again. That's what I just did.
---
Ok, so I should still get both perks? That helps a lot. Thanks.
---
Nice! But yeah the OP is so right though. You mine a ultracite node each time AFTER you kill a horde. After you kill 1 horde after mining, mine another and repeat. I must have gotten like 5-8 holiday scorched!
---
With that in mind how does it play for morgantown? anytime the server picks morgantown i almost immediately lose faith frok lack of shrubbery
---
Oh right, I haven’t had an opportunity to play in the new depleted maps, tan is definitely more optimum in the city
---
I assume it's like wallpaper and u just go to edit am I doing it wrong?
---
Yep! I’ll be around off and on. ZforZombies2016
---
OP Literally has clips, wheres your proof?
---
Huge money maker apparently is to make a YouTube video with a title saying how shit the game is and squeak it out to atleast 10:01 and just sit back and wait for that ad revenue to start flowing
---
I’ll give it a shot! mildly annoying that you cant change your character’s appearance mid-game but oh well. just placed second doing ye ole hold a gun and look at the ground trick but that doesnt go well with my pale character!
---
Other players already mentioned his name. Go read them.
---
So it doesn't exist, alright thanks.
---
OP literally streams his games, if he was cheating you'd know.
---
he's still going, and at level 86.
---
not sure.
---
Killied a legendary level 80 sb during line in the Sand only to watch the body disappear.
---
I'm on Xbox and some of the fights have been unbearably laggy. Bots on Parade and census violence tend to suck along with surface to air.
---
Got him 4 games out of 5 just now amd quit for the night.
---
I don't think you can trade the rewards though.
---
So what? Cheaters gonna cheat.
---
I reported him five times starting at 12pm yesterday.
---
it was never a economy in this game. get use to it
---
This should be resolved in Wastelanders ,as Bethesda's just giving you a heads up that that area is going to change.
---
Just try closing out of the vendor and going back in: this normally fixes it for me
---
Where did you obtain them?
---
You think Bethesda would have a anti-cheat software like valve does that would ban someone doing stuff like this. Or after a certain number of  reports he would be banned by system.
---
I literally played with Captainoob multiple times, he doesn't and never has cheated in Nuclear Winter.
---
It's one of the possible rewards from the random encounter Mister Prizebot.  I've gotten several year's supply of Cram, caps, and a few other sundries.  But I kept the certificates for the Corvega, just because...  hope.
---
My issue was resolved mid posting this
---
So I’ve been confused on this for awhile when it says base is that base before any perks or damage buffs or is it base as in after all the buffs but not including furious or exterminator or anything situational?
---
What I've noticed...
---
I have 2 charecters that I used... Spent all my caps on large gifts. My one charecter (12k) did alright, my other charecter (which was actually my beta charecter) is lower by 80 levels and seems to be a luck box rng... So I thought... Let's see... Put of 16 large wrapping paper bought gifts I got 2 Santa crash, 3 icicles lights, guerilla head, snallygaster, glowing one, and I forget... With my reg I did get the infamous plasma grenade.
---
As far as killing Santa scorches...
---
Again, luck box charecter is just lucky. I got 3 large gifts out of 5 killed santas.  Small sample size.
---
Just go find the unmarked fissure sites (small fissures) and kill the initial scorched, then grab an ultracite deposit (one at a time) and kill the 4 or 5 scorch that spawn.  Keep doing that, go to the next one and repeat.  Sometimes you get a lot of santas sometimes you don't.  If you don't, obviously server hop.
---
Can you sell those then? I thought they were all marked as “atom” so you couldn’t do that...
---
You can actually find a tiny deathclaw in NV.
---
No.  I'm scared they will disappear.
---
No joke.
---
Sad but true!!
---
Pity it is working..
---
Well, I didn't think you could.  But if they're running hacking tools, my guess was they are getting the rewards so they have a copy, and then just extract and dupe for cash sales.
---
Well I know things that you give the skin 2 are destroyed as soon as you put them on the ground or trade them to someone that doesn't have them unlocked.
---
"Pass the beer Jonathan... PASS THE GODDAMN BEER! It's duck hunting season."
---
But aren’t they marked as atom and locked to the account. But you might be correct with the hacking part... i don’t know either way...
---
Thats what I meant I don’t think you can trade them, but at this point after seeing the 5* weapon hacks, i really have no faith in the code protection Bethesda has...
---
Subscribe to First and get 10 Ammo Scripts a month! We guarantee at least 3 will be worth a damn!
---
But there are a class of enemies ingame that self-destructs when their legs and arms (and in case of Assaultrons, head) are gone.
---
Enforcer shotguns could clear silos cheaply.
---
Blue Harvest
---
Better off with standard,  the barrel is broken.
---
Not “new”. Drop any item and then pick it up then try again and it will work for you...
---
Goes well with the invisible enemies when you load in, was nearly dead by the time they appeared and now you can't even shoot back. 🤣
---
Did they write, in neon, THIS IS MAGA COUNTRY!?
---
I know, you don't should need that. But check the filepage system. Maybe it's a engine thing. This game use it a lot. Maybe fo76 use the drive more than fo4. But that thing and a good drive helps a lot.
---
I god I wish I had enough time in the game to give all the new players nukashine
---
My vendor sales overall have fluctuated significantly based on the location of my camp &amp; the level of enthusiasm visitors had about my camp build. I really love building camps around in-game content but unfortunately some of my favorite locations are towards the edges of the map. Those don't get a steady stream of visitors but occasionally someone will come along &amp; like the camp &amp; buy out all my ammo or etc. 
---
I often buy a bunch of ammo at camps if I really like their design even though I'm mostly playing my melee alt &amp; have tons of material to craft my own ammo. I think of it more as a tip / gift.
---
Legit.
---
I always buyowe level handmades and levers that are under 200 caps, and free stuff.... If I hoard everything I see on the ground, why wouldn't I take free stuff from bags or vending machines?
---
People who put free shit out, shouldn't cry when it's gets taken.  They should be happy.  Most likely a low level player doesn't know what to do with it anyways and sells it for 2 caps.  Like, don't feed the animals.
---
You can combine the gifts????
---
Yeah, the floors are a little different in that aspect as they were introduced before wallpaper. If you are in the crafting screen under floors, scroll to the right and you'll eventually hit the Atom Shop floors. To swap them out with existing floors, go into edit mode, and when you attempt to store/scrap, pick the replace option and scroll to the desired floor design.
---
Thanks for the correction, it downloads the patch but copies the game, which requires double the space to be available.  
---

---
I use the gift icon, but previously I'd stand in front of the bag and squat-stand-squat-stand while changing into various weird outfits. New players still don't immediately understand but most walk closer to try to figure out wtf I'm doing and then run into the bag.
---
a little bc ps4 wasn't made to take full advantage of ssd
---
That's usually what I do.
---
People still play NW?
---
Once they get bored and in Nuclear Winter they’re coming to Adventure. So this definitely shouldn’t be taken lightly. But to answer your question: Yes, we had full lobbies Friday night on PC. If you read my post you know where we stand now.
---
I wouldn't think most people trying out the game would base everything on nw. That is not the main draw of this game at all
---
How long did money bags take you? I have that and reach level 100 to go. Also, congrats :)
---
Just go to the shack and use the option "upload" on the terminal. Anyway I completed it on three characters, but gotten no rewards at all. Is that normal?
---
For some it is. If one game mode is absolutely broken in a game are you likely to press play on the other...? Doubtful.
---
And again, these hacks work in Adventure too. Once they get bored there they’re coming to your front door. I’ve seen them but they’re just not as common because Adventure isn’t competitive.
---
I get around this by "selling" notes for 0 caps that most experienced players would not be interested in purchasing -- notes which are just regular parts of the game and don't have especially funny / interesting titles or content.  If one of them sells, I head back to camp and pick up things I've already crafted from my stash.   
---
(To be fair, I do share gifts with higher level visitors too... I just enjoy giving gifts. But it's rarer that a higher level player is interested in "buying" these notes, and for whatever reason the ones who do have been fun &amp; friendly.)
---
Are these in-game on pc? I need 3
---
oh, well, at this point, all who stay playing this game have to asume that the hacking/duping problem is out of control. I doubt it will be controlled ever.
---
Said this, average users can still have fun and enyoy the game, asuming some "inconveniences".
---
Ooo, exciting! I have a whole creepy-church-o'-skulls-n-mothman thing going on right now &amp; will be overjoyed if I can add this to my camp.
---
I can say that I noticed something similar on PC. Taking 3 shots rather than two on high level ghouls with my handmade, but my Fixer was just fine. Thirst seemed a bit higher as well. Thing is, I've noticed stuff like this before but sometimes it seemed to correct itself the next day. I have no idea if they made a change to these things, but I guess other posts on topic would need to pop up on the topic before I'd start to be convinced.
---
I’ve decided that my bottom price for plans is 10 caps each.  Even when I want to get rid of them.  Otherwise people will just grab them all because “Hey, free stuff!!!”  Even someone low level can pick up a few hundred caps easy, so they’ll be able to buy a copy of each of your low priced plan.  I offloaded 600 excess plans this way and I feel people got a good deal.
---
I agree that we can still have fun in a game where hackers exist. But not these kind of hackers. Me and my community on Discord have killed several aim botters (get a before them, have multiple people shoot at them, etc). These hackers on the other hand, insta-kill the whole lobby within ten seconds via console command. The game starts and ends within less than a minute. You’re physically incapable of playing the game which means there’s no fun to be had unfortunately.
---
for server stability is also good. i see when i log in my mule full with legendaries for scrip that my frames drops and is laggy
---
&gt; Adventure isn’t competitive.
---
That is your mistake, imo. Nothing is competitive in FO76, WAKE UP! If you want competition look for a solid stablished game, with hacking and duping under control. There are a lot of them...
---
Moneybags didn't take long thanks to the vendors. I farmed meat week and the Halloween event nonstop. Sell my rare outfits, household items and legendary gear for around 2500 each. They sell quick. The 2 trophies that took me the longest was the hacker and magazine trophies.
---
Tell that to Bethesda.
---
The staff is probably not working on the weekend.
---
Ah yes there, i said that. And even though i did say it, i also didn't.
---
I did that once but never again,  I seen who bought the stuff and followed them back to their camp. They sold all of it for way more than it was worth. The dude was upper level130+.
---
They know it. They pass and they will pass.
---
They know they failed (this time) at entering in the PvP scene and to reach the big audience/$.
---
My feeling is that they just keep the PvP thing open by inertia or to avoid more problems, bad press...
---
This currently-low-level lady hasn't really seen a shortage of legendary scorched &amp; I wasn't even going out of my way to farm. I've just been doing everyday things like working on my camp, workshops, quests, etc. and they appeared to bring me Santa's delights.   
---
I really like that this whole thing is designed in a way that could work for both first time players &amp; experienced grinders... well, apart from the fact that I don't ever recall encountering a tutorial which explained where gifts would end up in the inventory, how to "open" them, how to craft them beyond "go to a vendor", etc.
---
My go to outfit is elders battlecoat, field scribe hat and plague doctors mask. However, I am also fond of fasnacht beret, veil of secrets and brotherhood jacket from the early levels.
---
Sry man but I mean it doesn’t just have to Xbox
---
PS4.
---
OOOOO! If you're on PC I would LOVE to see! and I'd be more than happy to set a few in your camp for you :D
---
Ah, thanks. But I’m in PS4.
---
..and they are few and far between.  I never bother people with workshops, and only once every few weeks does someone bother me.
---
You can double to amount you make if you use the Chemist perk card! :D So instead of making just one, you'll get 2! :D
---
I server hopped th prison for the hacker one. Also hood job :)
---
Had the same experience on PC tonight. Ridiculous
---
Yeah I've become a master at farming the Charleston building. In the basement is a terminal I just kept running that while getting Legendaries hehe.
---
Maybe, you all have to decide if the "non-so-broken" areas of the game (some Adventure) are good enough to you to stay in the game or not.
---
Honestly, to try to make Bethesda to fix NW and to make it big at this point wont happen. NW it's virtual abandonaware imo.
---
The Morgan is what I wanted the most but I only get to play a few hours a day on weekends so I was resigned to not getting it. One run through Big Bend and the civic center and mothman was the first thing I got. So awesome and so massive! My other gifts were plasma grenade and tomahawk plans, a nv scope plan for a handmade (if I remember correctly), as well as cat head and antler plans. The only other plan I really want is dense combat torso, but I'm already fully satisfied with the event.
---
Ugh. I tried it today (Level 82) and I got destroyed by the first Christmas Scorched. Snuck back in to grab my loot then Nukashined my arse out of there.
---
2 Hours later he just won a game in under a minute. I found one loot box and he had won the entire BR.
---
Earlier this year the World Scout Jamboree took place in West Virginia. It's sad they didn't acknowledge the event at all, but at least now we're getting the rest of the Pioneer Scout content.
---
 Better late than never, right?
---
Imo, the Survival tent should have been a squirrel backpack.
---
You know what, I actually gifted some legendaries to other players...I picked two random people. A level 188 and a level 3 lol. They just got all the crap I couldn't sell to the exchange.
---
They do get banned but create new accounts, many of them are pretty low levels.
---
I also think this have been up before, that it takes them about 2 weeks to confirm and bann.
---
I don’t even play NW and if I have to I just afk, because of all cheaters. Probably harder now though since they implemented the smaller maps.
---
Where are you greeting this info? Not doubting, would just like to check it out myself. Any new pve content is very welcomed haha
---
I also point at the bag with my weapon and fire a shot next to the bag.  People get the idea pretty quickly.
---
They clearly knew how much damage they were doing. Some people see this gane as single player no matter who else is around.
---
Game legit crashed for me after being killed by a cheater. Restarted the whole thing, went in and found another lobby, and the exact same thing happened again, by the exact same guy. Game crashed again too lmao. I have resigned myself to not be getting that skeleton outfit at this point.
---
There was an economy?
---
This is an online game where development continues for year on end. If they’re incapable of fixing the hackers pull it and put those developers towards something more beneficial for the long-term health of the game. They failed on Survival Mode. They pulled that. PvP &amp; hackers are in Adventure Mode which is arguably a fail too. Fuck should they just pull that too or...? I fail to see your argument. They’re letting the game rot right now and the time for making excuses are over lol. 
---
There’s still a community who EXCLUSIVELY play Nuclear Winter across all platforms. This is a fact whether you like it or not and removing the mode will cause another massive exodus of players. They either should have never release it or a far more constructive solution which would be to FIX IT.
---
Thank u I'll try that
---
That's awesome. I've done that plenty of times and have had  a few like wtf am I gonna do with this exterminators bash dmg rw tire iron lol. Then other guys were thanks for the scrip. Had one guy actually drop a nocturnal powered sentinel fsa chest he rolled from the scrip I dropped by Mumbles for him. Definitely shows that karma is real :)
---
They idea is good, but it just don't work. 
---
Many of us already tried this, since camp-vendors were out...
---
This is why I don’t do this. Sometimes I drop stuff outside vault 76 but most times I find someone with the right level for the low level items and travel to them.
---
Still funny how many that just run off in fear.
---
Currently rocking the bomber jacket with green hood.
---
That level 3 is probably wondering what the hell they're going to do with 3 level 45-50 legendaries...
---
I feel lucky that I'm really into the building aspect of the game &amp; enjoy building camps around in-game content (monorails, caves, etc)... cuz if I wasn't, I'd likely be done with every other piece of content by now &amp; out of things to do beyond looking for low levels to help. :/
---
Only for the exclusive event rewards.
---
True, should have went to area and told them better hurry up because the double xp ends Monday! lol
---
Hes level 93 now.
---
In your camp look at the pioneer scout banners
---
Haaaaa! Oh dear, I had no idea. My camp is in the forest &amp; gets a lot of low level visitors, and I deliberately fill the punch bowl entirely with vintage nukashine whenever possible. It hasn't been uncommon for a single player to drain the bowl in the past when I was just using beer or whatever else I happened to have around...
---
Both large gifts give you scrip, and its supposedly between 5- 100 with a 20% chance that you get at least 5.

---
They won’t remove it because there’s an active player-base who plays NW across all platforms. They develop it but don’t fix it or ban hackers. There’s honestly no excuse for this and we could debate it all day but I’m gonna move on because your set in your opinion, and I’m set in mine. Add an anti-cheat, ban the hackers, react when players send tickets, there’s a whole selection of routes they could take but they’re sellouts. The only way things change is if we make our voice heard and vote with our wallets.
---
I think having the ability to just bulk your ammo into clips would help I've got thousands of useless ammo I tend to just drop outside the vault for the newer players. But having the ability to bulk your ammo into clips would make sale easier to
---
Give them to my alts by using peivate server, all alts are 50+. If yours aint, just make them hold them for your main.
---
^ he's right you know
---
Take the scrip limit out of the legendary exchange machines and put a reasonable cap on what we can spend daily on the Purveyor, so at least we can still keep playing and farming for legendaries when we hit both max caps and stash limit. More than often I have to log out and play another game because I can't keep grinding for legendaries because I can't exchange them on the machines, can't sell them to the normal vendors and can't keep on my stash because I've already hit all these limits, so unless I want to keep dropping all the stuff I get, there's literally no point in keep playing the game.
---
If I could at least exchange this stuff for scrip, even without being able to roll the dices with Mama Murmrgh for the day, I could at least keep playing.
---
Thanks heaps I understand now
---
thx
---
thank you
---
thanks for that :)
---
Appreciated
---
Adding, this is awesome and I'd love to check it out.
---
This happens to me at the purveyor, all I do is open my stash on the closest stash box and back straight out.... Then I can buy from the purveyor no problem
---
It might be annoying but thats not harassment lol its an online game.
---
Server performance is pretty much the same for all platforms. All 3 uses the same servers, so we are all screwed equally at least. We are just instanced to play with people using the same platform, but other than that there's really no difference as we are all sharing the same servers on Amazon cloud.
---
Just look at Twitch.
---
Sucessfull stablished PvP games consistently get five digits of viewers, while NW averages… one dozen of viewers?
---
Sure, there are still some dudes playing NW, but I bet the company is not going to burn resources to try to revive a dead horse. 
---
GL, in any case, to the NW micro-comunity, very small but tenacious and optimist, for what I see…  :-)
---
That’s good to know thanks. Only noticed as my stash is full and can’t go to the purveyor. Noticed earlier that my scrip was 1000 and I’d purposely not done my dailies so I didn’t go over.
---
For longest time it never showed up on my list either.  
---
Then one day I went I talked to the Chief in the Emergency Services and it started showing up again.  
---
This was about a month back, and it didn't actually start up the day I talked to him but the day after, so maybe just make a point of poking him every day or so and hopefully things'll work out?
---
Sounds like a regular day in the wastes
---
I had the same reaction initially. I'm not typically a "play straight through the main quest line" gamer but I hadn't encountered any of the side quests yet. I began focusing on workshops and exploration and that helped me level enough to be ready to take on some of the more difficult areas solo. You'll need to get to level 25 before you can start the quest which'll give you the excavator power armor to survive nukes &amp; other high radiation areas.
---
I'm not sure why either &amp; it's frustrating. But blueprints are also used in workshops which likely have different budgets... and some have discussed budgets changing with level, although I'm not certain whether that's still accurate.
---
I'll trade you something good for it. HMU
---
Dead mode, hands why Beth removed it.
---
My experience has been that the "grow" function doesn't reliably capture all items, but it does capture enough of them that I usually only have to click a few times to get everything else. It took me a long time to realize that trying to figure out what was selected based on whether it appeared highlighted was a stressful exercise in futility... I now only look at the blueprint bar to see whether it's growing or shrinking when I select the other items.   
---
But I also had to get in the habit of thinking about my camp builds in terms of 2-3 separate blueprints because the blueprint budget is smaller than my building budget. That's pretty easy when I'm building a few separate structures but can be trickier for larger / oddly shaped builds.

thank you for your kind response! and for your props! :D i feel really good reading this, lol!
---
and i totally agree with every point about nw (and about my nw skills :P). i hope they are going to listen to the community more. a very good way would be a player counsil. like the game eve online has. every year the playerbase can vote for their "speaker". and one of the players will be that speaker and will be invited to important meetings for important decisions. just to have the playerbase as part of their meetings and decisions.  
---
just wishes \^\^
---
so now i must hope we get into a random team, so we dont have to fight each other :)
---
we have a nice (cheater-free) discord for nw players, so if you ever looking for teammates just write me. sadly since latest changes the discord is not as full as it was before.
---
Nope annoying bug been around forever i just close and open the vendor till it lets me buy
---
To me it's not with double xp, but with special events like Meat Week, Halloween and now the Holiday. I like them on the first day or two and then get extremely bored, and as everyone is usually just doing them, there's little to no activity outside of these events, and this fact just adds to my boredom...
---
What is a platinum trophy? Is it a console thing?
---
Ya
---
I like building so I regularly create camps &amp; destroy them for no other reason than wanting something new... I'd love to be able to pass my old camps along to visitors who enjoyed them.   
---
Unfortunately, since some of my favorite builds are around in-game content (monorail cars, caves, etc) it would really only be possible to sell them if I could transfer ownership of the camp :/ But I do have others which could be placed nearly anywhere &amp; enjoyed.   
---
I think lots of people would sell them even it if required using the same intermittently buggy &amp; frustrating build system that exists today... I definitely would! There are already people who sell a version of this via tutoring other players and/or teaming up &amp; building the camp for them... and others like me who just do it for free cuz it's fun.
---
wait is there another option to get ammo besides the dispensers?!
---
PS4.  My other two characters had little problem getting the plans.  This 3rd one?  Can't get it done.
---
Because they don't want me to spend my hard-earned caps at their vendor, I assume. Or the "tips" I give out by buying things I don't truly need when I encounter awesome camp builds.\*

(\* unless the locked area is clearly part of roleplaying-related design / obviously designated for a team or crew of some kind)

I hope there's more badges to get.

Thanks I have been going to him every day or ever other day. Really frustrating. I'm trying to get the Super Stimpak Recipe
---
First time you get unlimited rewards, says a lot of how many are playing it pre event.
---
Be nice if Bethesda listed a top 20 list of top selling vendor camp items once a month?
---
you forgot harper's ferry and berkeley springs
---
I gave him mine.
---
Yep it's ridiculous. Even the most basic anti-cheat code could auto-ban several of these players. I'd never expect it to be perfect but I would expect them to make some effort to deal with this issue. Even if they can't manage to code a single line, at least during the free weeks, they should have a moderator periodically in the game to manually ban blatant cheats like this. It's not like there are many games going and everyone that played more than 30 minutes today saw it.
---
Hmm maybe a symbolic price is the way to avoid this, just kinda kills the sentiment, but if it stop high level deuces from emptying my stores its maybe worth it ...
---
since Chemist work with Super Duper when crafting chem, is it possible to have it proc too with gift ?
---
And how do you combine them ?
---
My hope is we get some additions and extensions to the Wild Appalachia content when Wastelanders drops. Hopefully Biv will have new items to chase (Looking at you, Firecracker Whiskey and Keg) and hopefully a Squirrel rank will be added with new challenges to complete/badges to earn.
---
Thank you.
---
thanks b0ss
---
After a little testing I've found that making a quick run through the entire WS farming route before relogging gets them going, otherwise you'll have to wait out the 20'ish minutes respawn counter for them to appear the first time. After that a relog gets them back every single time!

PS: Not using PA and Stabilized will gimp you a lot dps-wise, there might be other advantages to using regular armor, but straight up dps, 45% armor piercing is tough to beat!
---
I carry around a low damaging 10mm for this just so I can get the loot and someone at least gets the kill and loot aswell.
---
I try to be one of those nice players but I agree, after hundreds of hours I’ve only encountered 2 people who were just assholes. Everyone else has been nice and helpful.
---
If they get rid of the daily 1,400 limit on vendor caps...yeah sure. I'd be for paying to refresh.
---
Couple of times gotten griefed in the past 13 months. Usually just positive vibes
---
It's just best to drop the stuff you giving away when you come across some NEWBS but then again how do we know if these NEWBS are really NEWBS and not ALT's.
---
Guess you are as weird as me then lol
---
Nah you're good. I keep saving them too till christmas.
---
Thank you. :3
---
I wouldn’t worry about it not showing as it’s not completing. It’s the first thing that pops up when I log in and since the last patch it never completes. Still shows in my pip boy until I sever hop. Before the last patch it was 50/50 chance of completing.
---
I think it’s more annoying that only like 25% of the caps that you spend on a vendor actually go back into their cap pool.
---
Fo76 is an online game so you have to have Xbox Live to play
---
Yeah, a vote system crossed my mind too but I abandoned the thought for the same reason you pointed out.  A lot of people have a very hard time determining the difference between a cheat and a legit good player. I'm far less concerned about the player running ESP and no recoil hacks than the obvious flying instant kill cheats that don't get banned for weeks.
---
I like that idea
---
:)
---
I'm obsessed with it at the moment :D
---
Very nice, just be careful with that drum...they say people can get funny ideas over killing people for hysteria sake 👀
---
This seems like a great idea, best solution I’ve seen so far imo
---
I mean they ain't that bad once you get into the swing of things, got almost all of em finished without realising haha
---
It's a live-service game so that's not going to happen.
---
Oh god yes that's super annoying...there's no reason for it either :/
---
It’s a nice easy 8 scrip. I log in on a private server just to do it, on public they normally get killed before I get there.
---
NAW.... just fix the game
---
Don't know if you mentioned this, but servers are regional for one thing and we've been lobbying for text-chat for over a year now.
---
Until now we've been ignored, just like with any other suggestion that can not be exploited with the atomic shop.
---
I’ve had the same issue for quite some time now. All the daily quests except for “to cop a squatter and “someone to talk to” trigger fine for me but I have yet to see those two in many months.
---
The social media mob is not made up of not players. 
---
It's a marketing campaign being done, not done by Beth, but by Beth's competitors. You give employees and youtubers a check and have them post on Bethesda games subs as a player. They pump content that will drive players to these other companies. Internet is over run with such shady ethically bankrupt practices. There was a user exposing the other side of this, Companies paying for positive lies to help drum up curiosity or support...I tip my hat to them...this is like that and I believe it's why the OP is hearing the negativity.
---
I think they all are good but if you want legendaries:
---
Project paradise
---
Uranium fever
---
Scorched earth
---
Encryptid 
---
One violent night
---
Id run a lot more comunity events if this were true.
---
you tellin me creepy stuff m8
---
When they say "listen" makes me smile. Yes, I am listening. Where da bells at?
---
But first put on that lucky armor, slam some day tripper and eat some iguana on a stick.
---
You know there are two game modes right? Free weekends attract a lot of adventure players. Also consoles don’t have this hacking problem. 
---
I haven’t personally experienced this hacking issue, but it is something they recognized and said they are working on. Probably doesn’t mean much for those who experience the issue, um just saying you are overreacting by saying free weekends are ruining the game. They attract new players, and that is a good thing.
---
I kinda like getting random ammo as a reward. It kinda leans into the whole post apocalyptic feel, like money is useless and caps are tight but some people are paying for jobs with some spare ammo they found lying around. It would be nice it we could scrap it or trade it in though. Or maybe if we could barter for different ammo (possible future legendary or charisma perk idea)
---
Thank you... Thank you for this
---
This is a great idea!
---
Also maybe looted bodies could "decompose" (when they turn into that pile of meat/metal) so we don't have piles of meat with buzzing flies all over the place.
---
There's no real incentive to nuke other people. it takes a lot of time, effort and resources to launch nukes. When someone nukes a Scorchbeast crater everyone comes together to take down the queen. It's more beneficial to work with other people and help out. Also the amount of stimpaks and ammo drops is crazy high. Sometimes it's easier to drop it for other players than let it take up space in your stache or vendor.
---
Pffft.. I found a key around there during my first week playing. Was on the back of a jetski. Maybe both the things go together?
---
The idea of not looking at map at all is intriguing. I may need to try this later this week.
---
Rusty Pick by like "Dawg I heard you like missles"
---
Level 411, 140, and a 125 ... across all three characters that I've played for over a year.. I have NEVER looted or won a bloodied hanhmade. Never.
---
...and Wendigo. Not Wendingo.
---
Don’t they say standard backpack plan required for crafting?
---
First free play weekend I am guessing.
---
Idk probably lol I got mine before they introduced the small. So I never paid attention
---
They're called Lil' Grafton Monsters
---
Some of the presents I open don’t show what I got and I always panic that I got nothing
---
Thank you!
---
Sry i did not visit the dev room
---
Then they can set up a shop right next to yours and sell them all for 1 cap.
---
Although it's a super jerkish move, I can deny that I'd chuckle a bit if I saw someone do that.
---
Sell heavily modded pipe pistols and armor for a small amount of caps (like 20 each), that should be enough to dodge the high level players but still be more than affordable for low level players. Also it could be fun to get creative modding the guns. Then you can give away your .38 ammo for free, something no high level will ever pick up, but would be very valuable for the low level players that just bought a modified pipe pistol off you.
---
I fOrGeT tO cApItAlIzE tHe tHiRd O
---
They could even put a sign up asking low level players to take one if they want free lootz
---
I mean... Logically
---
Lots of them popping up on market reddit as people after paper... 😉
---
Happy cake day
---
This actually sounds amazing, how do you disable the compass on pc?
---
I burned thru the scrip limit in about 20 minutes yesterday.
---
I kept as much of the remainder that might possibly interest someone as I could, and then sold the rest to a robot.
---
I reiterate this idea: Let us scrap Legendaries (with a confirmation window) and give us double chance to unlock a mod for the weapon type, or some similar small benefit. 
---
Otherwise right now its "Thanks for the legendary, it's currently worth less than what a super mutant carries around for spare change"
---
Another cheater is RecoilMaster3000 (changed the number but we all know who they are)
---
Yer iam now a ranged build as bloodied was never a thing to start with, wishing I kept it now
---
Last time I went there scorch beast queens spawned and got glitched in the walls
---
Ah, you must be the lunatic from Nuka Land (FO4) 😉
---
They actually have flying animations (when they do that melee attack). Bethesda should just use this animation when they initially spawn in and call it a feature.
---
I only see that daily on the first server i'm in everyday. If i change server it disappears for the day. Also ,as,said,it not always completes
---
Don't know if someone already stated this but given the time the game has been online (1+ year) and the difficulties it have had, the playerbase that remains is very motivated to keep the game and community going.
---
Apparently it really helps. Don't know personally though.
---
I claimed it on TP page, but, how do i know if i got them. like i gotta craft the suit or something?  
---
Cant see the player icon either.
---
I ran a food bank for a while, people could leave donations and I would put the instamash or salsbury steak or whatever in a free vendor.
---
I did this as a test to see if more people would donate than would empty the vendor.
---
Although I was pleasantly surprised by how many people donated, they were outgunned by the starving level 390 players who desperately needed free instamash.
---
Hey, we should make a little after-Christmas-exchange - I can place you a deathclaw, you could place me a mothman (PC too)... but only when the hunt is over, I'm not gonna jinx my chance to get that SPECIAL schorched with the plans I'm still looking for ;)
---
If you don't run power armor and don't like dying to to explosive effect u could use a dense chest piece for no explosive dmg.
---
This PC&gt;Documents&gt;My Games&gt;Fallout76&gt;Fallout76Prefs
---
Then do Ctrl+F and type “bShowCompass”. It will find the text as long as you put it in correctly, then just go ahead and set it from 1 to 0.
---
Unknown.
---
Assume so.
---
Nuke fissure prime you'll still find plenty lol
---
Uuuh cool
---
At last I found a spotless big bend tunnel: 6 legendary scorched in less than 10 minutes.
---
I have a list of places to check out.
---
Wixon farm
---
Point pleasant 
---
Tyler county fairgrounds 
---
Lady Janets soft serve

Watoga high school
---
Gotta add:
---
 AWOL armaments
---
Any Horde event in high lvl area (bog, mire)
---
Legend! Thank you so much! this will help spice up the game if it ever gets boring.
---
I remember always doing AWOL. Did it a couple times tonight. The one with the stealth goat guy was hard
---
Have you checked you caps both before and after?
---
Because, in regards to dailies, you get caps and scrip.
---
For example, Tech Data, you get 24-25 caps for doing it, I know this because I gain 7-8 after each trip between Camp Venture and the Bunker (FT cost back is 17) and I wanted to see if it was costing me caps
---
No problem :)
---
Cheers to the drop m8. Dense modded chest and fireproof perks lets you shoot in your legs with 0 dmg
---
AWOL Armaments at robco. Can be difficult if you're not prepared, waves of major and colonel gutsys but always a max lvl 3* at the end and if you're lucky other random legendaries
---
Guided meditation in palace of the winding path. This ones all over for me, sometimes 1 but have had maybe 5 or more in 1 event! Maybe it depends on how many people are there and their levels...
---
Part of living in the wasteland is learning how to make hard choices. Budgeting and inventory management have ALWAYS been a staple of Bethesda games. 
---
If you haven't learned by now that you need a mule, you're missing something. 
---
Either get a mule, or you can leave your cool gear at my camp. :)
---
I doubt that's the case,  YouTubers just feed off the hate as much as they can, because they know a lot of people will watch and the majority will agree with them.
---
That or a couple points in fireproof
---
Hi, I think when you kill Boss enemies with the crown next to their game they have a chance to drop them
---
Nice I'll try that later thanks!
---
Yea, the Encryptid event can be a challenge if you are with a group that doesnt want to be the pylons. Not to mention dodging a ton of robots to get the imposter only for it to sneak up behind you and slump ya lol
---
And hundreds of railway spikes
---
That's what I thought, but that list shows them as uncommon/legendary. Or am I reading the rarity part wrong?
---
A mule is only good if you have a reliable way to get stuff to it...if you don't, you're fucked.
---
And Bethesda games are always better with mods :/ one of the first mods I get is one to help weight management. Also no other Bethesda game has a storage limit on what you can store in a container sooooo...yeah. This game is different, and much harder.
---
I do the exact same thing, no need to strip others of XP, especially when there is a decent amount of people in the event.
---
Don’t have any more room in Endurance for Fireproof but will definitely have to try the dense chest piece. I have other AAE guns but none that insta kill me like this thing does. Still funny when I go from mercing enemies like it’s a boss battle to spontaneously rag dolling across the room so maybe I’ll miss it a bit.
---
you also get 1 free tier 1 sub every month, fyi... use it for some streamers.
---
You have a really cute cosplay. I think that the real hard hitting question is what level of Red Menace did you get to?
---
Sure am! I became a ghoul by the events of F04 which explains how I lived that long.
---
So the shot guns are in a class of their own no other gun in game can cripple like they do don't believe me try one with plus 50% limb damage legendary effect and enforcer perk. I run an aa limb damage combat SG and it can cripple groups of Gouls at the golf club in one shot. Oh that lvl 91 glowing death claw looks so scary crawling around on the ground after one shot. Uh oh mirelurk queen coming in better shoot it in the legs once and watch it flop around uselessly while I lay down its protector kings the same way. In summary nothing short of scorch beasts survive the crippling effect makes a stroll through the wasteland seem like a walk in the park.
---
Do they?
---
Huh. 
---
That’s a lot of wrapping paper.
---
I keep a low damage 10mm on me for this exact reason. Doesn’t weigh much and let’s me tag everything without killing anything.
---
Had camp right there since launch never noticed it lol good eye!
---
And who doesn’t like five missiles as a reward?
---
Since this mode is competitive, no active player should do that. Because there is no spectator mode, unless you're killed by said cheater It cannot be done with 100% transperancy.
---
Bethesda cannot say whether or not they are banned for cheating, and the players will claim that they were in a team with cheater as we seen on a post from november.
---
I can only advice players to submit non-repetitive tickets with video proof (don't dpam the button, that's why we have automated answer).
---
And I hope support starts looking at my tickets with video proof of cheaters.
---
You're welcome any time
---
Responders paramedic with black cowboy hat :)
---
Just fully port in 4s building I don’t know why people buy AS camp objects when building is such a headache
---
Toothy Man mask and civil war dress
---
I got a 10mm prime receiver and I already had it. That was a large wrapping paper too. So pissed off.
---
I hear you. If you don't have a way to get something to your mule, that makes a big difference. I play with a friend, but I also have a second setup that I use when friends come over for "couch co-op" with an active PSN, so that makes my situation a little unique. 
---
And I still need to dump stuff once in a while. 
---
Maybe have a sale in your vendors? Like discount the prices until you free up enough space? I do that sometimes. It seems to work pretty well.
---
To my knowledge there is no guaranteed drops for them, just RNG.  Best bet my be player Vendors I see a fair amount of handmades being sold.
---
Considering some guy managed to spawn the Prydwen on Adventure, I wouldn't say this mode is safe either. At all.
---
It's just kinda rng for getting a legendary handmade. I would try buying one off another player or using a normal handmade until you get a legendary version
---
Yeah player vendors came to my mind as well, only "problem" being that they put some ridiculous prices on them
---
The "no witch-hunting" rule is enforced by Reddit, not Bethesda. If it was removed this subreddit would most likely not survive days before being deleted by Reddit. Just sayin'...
---
Not weird but your self control is impressive!!!  I made a bunch of gifts with the intent of giving them away but couldn't even hold on to them long enough to give out, I love the noise they make when they're opened...so I keep opening them myself. But I think I need to slow for a bit...I'm getting too many duplicate plans. Ooops
---
It's already on screen.
---
The random encounter Prize Bot will randomly give you a prize. Three of which are prize certificates.
---
For the backpack make sure you get the small backpack in Morgantown airport. Not sure if you can make it in atom shop skins but it's extra carry weight till you earn the "real" one.
---
There has been one player who has been consistently namedropped for around a day now. If they can't fix an issue of a single player being reported probably hundreds of times now then there's no way they even know what they're doing.
---
Freestate survivalist. Has kneepads,and slings that look like backpack slings instead of a floating backpack.
---
There is a glitch that lets you make 5 star weapons ... Beth should know this already.
---
Just tell him "Ok, boomer".
---
That sucks. Why do they have 5 stars if there are no legit 5 stars
---
One Violent Night is the best source, or my camp if I go public for 100 c per.
---
10/10, very well done...but now...hand over all of your caps!
---
Thanks for the update.
---
Area boss enemies (crown icon), scorchbeasts, legendary enemies, and loot chests(red or green steamer trunks)
---
Of course I do! My IGN is FreeWooby. We must free him from the prison Bethesda has put him in.
---
No your not playing too much, you had time to read an article
---
I don’t believe you can do this with explosive variants though.
---
Don't forget the double digit IQ admins will ban you for giving out the name of an active hacker so not the best idea.
---
This.  Early on I killed myself a lot with my TSE handmade when the mobs got to close.  Added dense to my scout armor chest and those days are far behind me.
---
Im still mad at bethesda and havent touched the game since 1st was announced (Nd now with the legendary armor bug) but damn it really has the friendliest player base ive ever seen.
---
And while you're at it, allow us to make bulk ammo so that we can sell it to players for competitive prices rather than one cap per shot!
---
You're my kind of asshole. ;)
---
Wow! Great work on the drum!
---
Yeah a few heavy gun perks and bloody mess and that thing will hit for over 1k damage. I think with my heavy gun build mine can hit almost 2k with adrenaline fully wound up. They are stupidly fun indeed :)
---
I have this same weapon and it completely changed my build! It's fantastic with the flechettes mod, but you definitely need fireproof/dense. The low durability is also a factor, but it's so fun that I don't even mind.
---
Same the other day I saw a clipboard and thought springs
---
IIRC it’s “Casual” so you’ll need the Casual underlining. 
---
You can buy the first three lvls from Freestates vendors. The 4th is an ultrarare drop from Queen of the Hunt.
---
You're not supposed to build that way! :P
---
😂😂👍🏼
---
I keep one of each and sell the rest for 55 caps a piece.
---
Depending on where you want to build, it may be difficult to build it normally. When I do floating C.A.M.P builds, I try to make them look as natural as possible.
---
With that said, I kind of agree.
---
Crap if ps4 I was going to say get them from me lol
---
Nope.
---
Spent about 1000 caps last night on someone selling them for 55.
---
There are sites out there that will show you how to find the locations.
---
Satantron
---
No
---
Sometimes they do, but sometimes you get great prices, bloodied is almost always pretty high.
---
I've gotten into the habit of backing off after her health regens and letting others finish it off, unless it starts going slowly after that.  More XP and Legendaries to be had in the mobs
---
My exception to this is if some punk shows up in Strangler Heart PA.  Then, the Queen needed to die yesterday because the giant fart cloud is bound to crash half the users in the battle.
---
With casual lining
---
Yep.
---
This is the same illusion that makes it look like the Mr. Handy Buzz Blade and Ripper are super effective against her.  The white portion of the bar is the cumulative damage done between the start and end of your attack from everyone in the battle.
---
You are on! I'll even hang up some other mounts if you've not found them! 
---
;)
---
This is awesome! It's so frustrating to have something where you want it but can't power it! Thank you!
---
I’ll check when I’m online again, but what do you offer?
---
I've seen a few people asking about it on the Reddit and got spooked, thinking it could be one of those plans that just n e v e r drop. But it's good to see more and more people are getting it!
---
50caps per map and 35caps per forrest map
---
I appreciate that. Keep it up!
---
Again, no offense meant, but it's short for too long; didn't read. Given the medium (reddit) rather than, say, a letter to the editor at the Annals of Linguistics, a brief summation is warranted at the beginning of end of the post. 
---
I do agree with you by the way. More ways to communicate or just better emotes are needed. I mean, has anyone ever used the "Let's Cook" emote? Is it for psychobuff addicts?
---
There isn't even any mannequin
---
I'm having so much probs even getting the last two diseases. The woopsies and the one u get from bees
---
You're spoiling me now! ;) Hell yeah! I'll add you right away :D
---
This is honestly one of the best suggestions I've seen. Very useful to everyone without being too overpowered, while making more separate aspects of the game feel more cohesive and symbiotic. I'd be thrilled if this was implemented.
---
No, sorry - I’m XB1
---
Nope. Not since Friday.
---
It’s nice all the salty people out there stick to social to media to complain about the game while the rest of us have fun playing it.
---
Well beth dont need your money. Lol
---
yeah the first 2 week of beta and then boom first dupe. and then what, with each update a new dupe method was inserted. and now hackers can spawn items and make them own 5* legendaries. conclusion no economy
---
Yup, the Responder Vendor Bot had a chance to spawn there, south of flatwoods on the road, just south of the ice cream shop up north, and at the crossroads south-west of Gorge Junkyard. There's a couple other places, but those are the ones I remember off the top of my head. Check the surrounding areas too, because he goes on patrol after he spawns. He can also be killed, and will die spontaneously sometimes so. Be mindful of that too.
---
I haven't gotten one and I've had three Santa tron's running at once. One in my camp and one in two different workshops all at the same time. Still nothing.
---
Yeah, I've gotten over 300 scrip just crafting large ones over and over lol
---
I only noticed when I went to scrip weapons and saw how much I had in currency, immediately booked to purveyor. Got all crap though 😭
---
Yeah I’ve made loads of gifts and that’s why I was surprised I’d hit the limit. Think I’m a bit addicted to making them. Selling everything I own.
---
Concentrate on the ones you have a large stack of. It's not worth it looking them each up, but a stack of 10 is worth doing.
---
Wait, you hit the scrip limit from this??? Holy 
---
This guys got all the plans in the Wasteland
---
Yeah, they're good money though... just making serums, selling to vendors, buy paper, rinse and repeat. Such good money lol
---
25 kills, 26 kills, 27 kills, 28 kills. all in 5 secs of flying around. during a free weekend. great job for implementing an anti cheat software. and thats lady and gentleman is how to burn the already dead game to ashes and throw that ash in the faces of the customers :)
---
Thank you for relying i actually received the help I needed already! That’s super generous of you to offer! Might I ask where you got them? Random drops?
---
Didn’t know you could build them in workshops! Going to be taking those over now haha
---
thank you, it never ever has been for me
---
Nice!!! It's good to see more Fallout cosplays...
---
You'd have to bust out a legendary and non legendary version to see I suppose. Try them both with and without perks. From what the patch notes said way back when they nerfed two shot and explosive its 20% of base weapon damage which I always assumed it before any other perks. Otherwise why specify base damage?
---
Thank you but someone did in fact help me! 
---
Standard was exactly how I like it haha! 
---
Congratulations on the new console I hope the Xbox treats you well i hear many many good things about it.
---
It’s for a possum badge. You need to craft robot armor to get one of the possum badges.
---
Tricentennial Salute turns into the Brotherhood salute whilst wearing power armour
---
That’s what I’ve been doing. Made loads of serums and with the caps back each time. Just need the Radscorpian and plasma then I’m done.
---
That's not what everybody's been saying everybody knows the Halloween is cumulative it's the christmas rewards which r not and will cost you 27k xp
---
its what the patchnotes literally say, right at the last sentence, Halloween was different 
---
Unlock Festive Cosmetics with Six New Christmas Challenges
---
&gt;We’ve added six new Challenges and themed cosmetic rewards for the holiday season that will begin appearing in the Character Challenge menu next week.
---
&gt;One new challenge will appear each day until all six are available. However, before you can begin earning progress toward any given Challenge, you must first complete the Challenges preceding it in order.
---
Same for me as well but only noticed after recent patch...hopefully they fix it
---
I had about 560 the last time I look and then it was maxed out. But love the gifts.
---
I got the plasma mine about an hour ago.  The rare plans seem to drop in large gifts.  Good luck!
---
Serious? Shit. I guess I should upgrade. I'd still like it without power armor... I thought I had a good suggestion.
---
I'm just sad there's no clothing from this
---
Yeah that would have been nice.
---
THIS LOL
---
What new vault entrance ??!??
---
Yea, I've read that, I saw people saying that it was the case for the Halloween as well so I was kinda disappointed, until I tried.
---
I don't think the holidays one are available yet though. But thank you for the heads-up.
---
http://dulfy.net/2018/12/02/fallout-76-treasure-maps-guide/
---
You do have a good suggestion, but Bethesda is 4 parallel universes ahead of you 
---
And yeah, outside of PA would be nice
---
Ya, even had a few people chase me around the map over it lol.
---
Good luck finishing your set. I just finished mine this morning, now off to Nuclear Winter lol
---
I bet that felt good and thanks
---
Anytime! Yes random drops and mama murmrgh’s dealership, and a couple from vending machines.
---
Looking at this makes me realise I really don't take advantage of how creative one can be in this game!!
---
Garage door and toggle switch. Shut it down when they approach
---
At least there is a work around!  Lol
---
Holy goodness I love this so much!! 🎅🏻
---
If you started Halloween day 1 is was like 27k.  Started day 7 it was 14k.  Christmas will not be the same, and I’ll be starting late and hiding in a bush yet again!
---
Try watching Chernobyl lol
---
Dis you see the newest hack? I'm in a discord of 1000 people with a program that can spawn any item and even 5 star legendaries on pc.
---
Good strat. I'll be doing the same but not by choice, university claiming bits of my soul.
---
Awesome War Drum!
---
I've played since release but didn't buy the tri-cen edition and i have never known that.
---
I saw a guy flash the Free States salute and it made me want more ways to rep the BOS dammit!
---
I always try to stay right at the edge of the circle and only move when the ring starts closing. Aquaboy has been my go to card as it works a treat in morgantown near the grafton damn area, and the pipes in the cooling tower of the power plant make for some good hiding spots. I have been wearing the black ops underarmor for when I have armor equipped and the raider scanner outfit and mask for when I'm being a bush wookie. I'm rubbish at battle royale type games but I'm great at hide and seek! Out of fairness though to other players I always turn off team fill, and when it gets down to the final 10 I always come out of hiding and fight.
---
Point pleasant, top of the world, any and all know static spawn locations. Enemy level do not matter in the chance of gifts

Scorch events are great like Line in the sand... had 4 Santa’s in one event
---
All my Santatron gives me is coal and fertilizer. I literally get coal and shit.  Coal and shit!
---
 I swear it must be Billy Bob Thorntom under a robot costume.
---
I’m so glad I just read those tips. I had no idea you could craft two gifts with the chemist perk. Good thing I didn’t craft too many before I saw that. I would have been wasting a lot of caps and missed opportunities.
---
I mean, they're a business, and they are here to make money, not friends.

use the search or simply browse HOT

---
There's a new un-marked quest that leads you to a mysterious door...
---
Me too. It would have been cool to get that blue suit that some of the scorched wear, but I guess I’ll have to settle for the nuclear winter rewards that are coming up.
---
Try adding more foundations...sounds counterproductive but, "It just works"
---
If you're ps4 I could help in person
---
🤫
---
Yeah I tried that. Meant I could delete what I did have but then was stuck with new foundations. I’m on Xbox but thank you for the offer!
---
amazing, now please hit me with the war drum, thanks
---
That’s two locations tho! 
---
My event record was 6 for line in the sand and location is 5 at wavy willards, you beat them both.  
---
Stop using up all your luck though!
---
Step 1: Kill legendary mob
---
Step 2: Hope
---
Step 3: Curse the gods of RNG
---
That's pretty ignorant tbh. It's one thing to make copies of items that already exist in game, but manufacturing items that don't exist probably won't end well for whoever has them.
---
I've been playing NW since the last double XP weekend in November, and I have literally run into exactly three cheaters. 
---
One of them I reported. I stopped seeing his name after that. Another I forgot to report and also haven't seen since. The last guy showed up yesterday (I think it's probably the same guy you're referencing). We'll see if he lasts more than a few days.
---
I'm sorry you've run into these types right off. I can tell you that I've honestly seen very little cheating in my ~1+ month of playing NW, so maybe your luck will turn soon. I got enough XP to unlock that costume by Friday evening, so it can be done fairly quickly if you grind at it.
---
If u still have a spare I'll buy it from you
---
I can’t wait to hunt for these I’m sure I’ll find a couple mods and if I get another Gatling I’ll break it down for plans and such!
---
Hahhah this ^
---
I'm on central time.  I'll be on this evening around 8 or 9. Gt is same as here
---
You don’t just find legendary handmades, they are RNG and the chance is significantly lower than most other weapons.
---
Santanatron
---
Dang. Sounds like a foundation you are trying to delete my night be attached to one that is properly anchored in the ground. A pic might help
---
They aren't really viable in this game. Between enemies with explosive resistance, and the inherent issues with targeting, you're better off not using it.
---
Actually i Play for Many month and I had no bug maybe  i'm lucky
---
I’ve always been dual console but I snagged a One X super cheap a few months ago and have slowly converted. It sucked starting all over again. So many more bugs and my first build was a melee build, never ran out of ammo. I can’t keep ammo now. 
---
Glad someone was able to help you out! I’m not going to use my PS4 anymore and I can gift you whatever you want. Just hit me up and I’ll try and coordinate a time.

Same guy ?
---
Just use a website and find them, like others are saying. There are some plans that only come from treasure maps.
---
I keep opening them, desperate to find a single Christmas deco plan that isn't a mounted head. I will probably start saving them when I secure the icicle lights so I can quit being anxious that I'll have to trade for them on Reddit. 😂
---
The beauty of this thing is nothing can even get close to me. I killed myself way too often with shotguns (no range) but the harpoon packs a punch over a long distance. I even have one modded with a scope and use it for sniping.
---
This is why i stay away from NW. I want the glowing skull suit but I’m not risking hackers and frustration
---
Yeah same for me, it happens with them, ghouls and scorched. They also can’t die.
---
But you do get to experience the response.
---
This post as an example.
---
Stash your junk. Try adding different wood and concrete floor to and around the unremovable item. Look at the underground camp building video  guides. 
---
https://youtu.be/inzULh3eLjM
---
~~Try adding stairs and a steel beam and maybe a bass instrument~~. You might fall and die.
---
That’s awesome!  I don’t see many Fallout cosplays so it’s nice to finally see one!👍🏻
---
Dang are you retiring your ps4 entirely? I collect playstations so it’s going to be a sad day to add 4 to the stack. Starting all over again is liberating yet somehow dreadful. Ammo has been a tough one for me even with ammosmith perks it’s never enough. I’m planning on doing a materials focused session only using melee just so I can catch up. I tend to use missiles, mini nukes and plasma cores and 40mm all of which take a lot to make so if you by chance have any of those hanging around I will gladly snatch them up haha!! 
---
Otherwise I don’t really need much but thank you for the offer!
---
YouTube has some great videos.  Usually a minute or less. VideoGameSherpa is good. Quick to the point., easy to follow.
---
The above poster forgot a few steps:
---
4:  shred the junk into scrip
---
5:  take the purveyor out to a nice dinner.  Generals Steakhouse, Big Fred’s BBQ, hell even Toxic Larry’s.  She doesn’t care about the caps you spend or quality of the meal, it’s the time together and attention you pay to her.  For the love of God don’t talk about scrip, and don’t you dare call it script!
---
6.  A few days after your date, drop by the Berkeley station, shoot the breeze but respect the fact she’s at work.  This is when you buy a few items, make it out like you’re just buying so you can spend time with her for a bit and not get her in trouble.  Casually glance at what you buy but make sure you pay more attention to her and not what you get.
---
7.  If you played your cards right, bingo!  If not head back to step 4, or be prepared for working on 2nd base and onwards.
---
I celebrated a bit too much after picking up a powered assassins sentinel piece and she still hasn’t forgiven me.
---
Holy cow this is magnificent

They will be available at some point.....behind a paywall of course 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Super lit 👍🏻 How long did it take to make that Wardrum? That’s some serious craftsmanship there.
---
Great work! Love the sunglasses, you really brought out the details.
---
Not retiring the PS4, too many good exclusives. Just 4K gaming on the one X makes my PS4 look like a ps3. lol.

I added you. I’m BuffToddHoward

Grafton pawn shop. Google it

What is happening on PC? Sorry I'm a bit behind with the news lately.
---
I’m running around in my Arktos lab coat and backpack with a Fanascht mask. It’s not rare or anything but I like the look.
---
What. The. Shit. Is this real?!
---
Why did nbn you get downvoted? There's literally a discord for PC that hands out the program that creates the 5 star legendaries.
---
I will do after work today!!!! Thank you
---
Hackers getting rid of evidence.
---
Was this on a console or PC?
---
I can confirm this. even tho both Twitch and bethesda said it worked, it didnt. I deleted the connection, then added again from bethesda and worked. You will know you got the items if you can craft clean striped suit in an armor workbench, or vaultec skin for combat shotgun at a weapons workbench or check out the other items in the atom shop.
---
Yep. It fires and is effected by all the effects
---
DRU
---
Yea everyone's been talkin about that blue suit. Very snazzy. And I agree I'm very much looking forward to the Nuclear Winter challanges
---
Yep . Allready have 20 gifts to open on Xmas
---
I would say definitely get rid of it
---
Yes they both work but keep in mind Grenadier only increases the explosion radius not direct hit damage. The shotguns have little range so you have to get very close to your target, and that increased radius will hurt you more often than your enemy. This is especially dangerous when you’re indoor facing fast moving creatures like ghouls. I’m playing with shotguns but I’m not using grenadier atm.
---
legit queen drop.  .009%
---
Holy crap. I’d get rid of that so I wouldn’t get banned
---
If your on PC players have been playing with spawning in items that showing exist. I’d probably drop it I’d imagine they have a way of tracking something that’s a 10 star
---
Jesus. I don't know how safe it is for you to keep it,but it would be tough not to.
---
Pc is sure in strange limbo right now with this and NW.
---
It's fine.
---
It's possible to have 53 STR from the following:
---
Perks: Solar Powered +3 STR, Radicool +5 STR, Party Boy/Girl +6 STR (3 x 2STR on whiskey)
---
Food +3 STR
---
Bufftats +3 STR
---
Unyielding armor +15 STR
---
Underarmor +3 STR
---
Also from Food bonuses another +75% (see  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/food](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/food) )
---
50 caps is my best offer.
---
that’s some pre-wastelanders content! pick up all the packets &amp; drop at Grafton Pawn (a new interior cell), and you can access vault 79
---
I can feel the tetanus seeping through my screen
---
Bloodied and junkies handmade are always going to be $$$ if you can even buy them for caps. Vampires too. I have a junkies, vampires ffr, and a medics handmade currently. :)
---
I would imagine it will come with an eventual BOS pack in the Atom store
---
I had an interesting experience at the glass caverns. At the bottom of the first tunnel I was attacked by 15-20 scorched at once. 5 of them were holiday scorched, however, even some of the non holiday scorched dropped gifts and legendary items. I think the game was confused because of how fast they all spawned in and how close together they all were. Total of 10 gifts from them. 
---
I am still yet to find a large gift though. Only small and medium. Do the large actually exist?
---
I'd say keep it &amp; enjoy it for the next day or so then sadly you'll have to find another game to play because magically you won't be able to log on once the Devs see that. lol
---
Das a hacked weapon, drop it or forever be banned
---
Oh okay. Do you need me to give it to you instead then?
---
Ah pc dang
---
yep. Got some, on glass cave too.
---
This is why I wouldn't bother with trading reddits or pvp for a while.
---
I would atleast hope so too though it doesn't look like it given their past actions being based on how many items one had or their inability to track somebody killing everybody in a NW match in under 5 seconds after loading in
---
slap on the flechette mod and you have a sniper shotgun that has no spread when aiming down sites. and with a QE you have probably the highest damage per shot weapon in the game. and throwing on the explosive and heavy damage perks you can get to 1000+ damage per shot
---
&gt; Das a hacked weapon, drop it or forever be banned 
---
&gt;I would say definitely get rid of it
---
&gt; Holy crap. I’d get rid of that so I wouldn’t get banned 
---
&gt; Jesus. I don't know how safe it is for you to keep it,but it would be tough not to. 
---
&gt; I'd say keep it &amp; enjoy it for the next day or so then sadly you'll  have to find another game to play because magically you won't be able to  log on once the Devs see that. lol 
---
As poorly as they handle most things, Bethesda actually doesn't ban accounts simply for possession. If you didn't take the steps necessary to create the item yourself, you're safe.
---
Well done, I really like the effort, and imagination you put into your roadtripper outfit, and War Drum, It looks amazing. 
---
I wish you, and everyone best.
---
 In addition I hope you have a very merry mutated Christmas.
---
Glassed caverns also has a tonne of scorched.
---
I do floating bases using this method. What will likely work for you is this. Attach the bottom part of the stairs to a foundation (or series of foundations) to a spot in the environment that anchors it. Do the same for three top portion of the stairs.
---
You should be able to remove the ladder at this point. 
---
The ladder isn't removing because it believes it is no attached to an anchor point. Attaching it to two anchor points usually works.
---
You’re not seeing what he’s saying. If you loot items and you’re the one to load that area on another server, those items will not spawn as they are on your “recently looted” list.
---
I’m level 10, am I supposed to have a full set of armor?
---
Ya on the only system with blatant hackers we have full lobbies on xbox this morning
---
I was walking my kids to school and passed through a back ally and there was a pile of broken dolls I immediately thought wow look at all the plastic and had a chuckle to myself lol
---
Ya, PC is rife with exploits and hacks right now. Beth really needs to crack down on that, even if that means pulling in an entire separate team for it.
---
How do you craft gifts?
---
LMFAO YEAH 😂 such a brave statement but yeah!!!
---
With so many holiday scorched, a doubling of legendary script limits would have been a wonderful gift.
---
Pretty much I did buy a 1* Bloodied for 1500 and a 3* BE15 FOR 5000 in vendors, but that is certainly uncommon.
---
I say hold onto it unless asked to do otherwise by Bethesda, though it will probably disappear from your inventory. Droppinh it would'nt be a bad idea but Do not sell it trade it or trade though. Out if curiosity how many script does the machine offer to you(dont try to profit it from it though)?
---
The war drum! The pip boy! Everything is perfect! Fabulous cosplay!
---
I totally ignore harpoon guns until the other day as well. I got a two shot version as a random drop and put it in my vendor for 2k because I thought it was trash. It didn't sell, but I ended up using it because I am doing all the challenges for killing scorched with different weapons. There was one for killing them with heavy weapons and it's the only one I had so I pulled it out and slapped the flechettes mod on it.
---
I went to Camden Park and shot it one and it ripped the scorched apart like it were a piece of paper. I also got 3 harpoons back, and only shot one. In the end, I had an absolute blast with it.
---
So, you buy gift paper from any vendor under the misc tab and then equip chemist perk, under intelligence category.  Then you walk up to a tinkering bench and craft x2 gifts with the acquired paper.
---
Wow these hackers are getting crazy
---
Cool. Thank you.
---
i offer 100 caps
---
I will definitely check this out later, just moved my camp and redid it so I got wired goin everywhere
---
Some are too dumb to read, some are too dumb to think, and some are just plain old-fashioned vanilla assholes 👌
---
You're welcome
---
Yes and I would drop the ammo because of how much space it uses. Even the Fat man is near useless
---
&gt;As poorly as they handle most things, Bethesda actually doesn't ban accounts simply for possession. If you didn't take the steps necessary to create the item yourself, you're safe.
---
potentially false, many users had account bans during the dupe era for "removing" dupe bags and grenades from various exploits in the past  weather or not you believe said claims, both sides need to be taken with a grain of salt
---
This. The improvement in load speed is quite noticeable.
---
I could agree with that. Especially since weight has been a rapidly growing problem once again simply because everyone is farming much more legendary items.
---
Zzxxzzw
---
As someone trying the game for the first time this weekend, I'm glad it's not just me. I'm just walking around with nothing going on around me and the frame rate keeps dropping like I'm in downtown Boston in FO4.  
---
  
---
Is this how the game's always ran?
---
Seems like the best bet, but Todd only knows.
---
My junkies is junkies bashing and I got it for like 800 caps. It’s amazing and I can’t wait to get a junkies explosive or ffr. I’m not even a gun build I’m melee and it’s skronk
---
Why would you post something like this when a 30 second look at your profile confirms you're a duper and hacker lol
---
This dude 100% made it himself lol
---
Yes, a boat load. Legendary but not holiday.
---
Boats and codes!
---
mk
---
Nothing the individual employees do will have any appreciable effect on what the executives and other company decision makers do.  And the rest of your comment is laughable.  
---
Short of a mass walk out, the executives don't take direction from many other people.  And I don't know if even that would make any difference in this case.
---
I disagree I lost an account awile back Bc I had too many serums. They track it if it’s hits a certain number in a certain amount of time. I’m on Xbox though so I honestly have no idea how they treat spawned in items
---
Seriously??? Oh my, I’m hoarding mini nukes 🙄
---
Raider OR Free States  (Shotgun): \[RANGE\] \[CROWD CONTROL\] \[TEAM\] \[BLOODY\] \[VATS CRIT\] \[STEALTHY\] Shotgun, no Power Armor. Uses Chems, Stealth, VATs and Enforcer perk for medium-to-short range DPS and unparalleled crowd control. Damage mitigation: Blocker, Nerd Rage, Chems, Stealth, Crowd Control.
---
This build works fine solo or in team. VATs for DPS. Also works as Bloodied or Junkie's or hybrid "Bloody Junkie" build. I have left out QoL perks. Use "Lone Wanderer" when solo.
---
If you don't like Chems, replace with per(s) of choice (I recommend Radicool and Cola Nut.)
---
Recommended gear:
---
1\* unyielding shadowed armor pieces w/ 1 sleek leg mod and 1 muffled leg mod. OR if not bloodied, vanguard pieces.
---
1\*  vampiric combat shotgun.
---
1\*  junkie's combat shotgun.
---
1\*  bloodied combat shotgun.
---
Avoid explosive weapons unless you want to AoE cripple groups. Don't fire point-blank if you're using explosive guns: you will proc cripples on yourself.
---

---
Bogged down with the 10-15 legendaries i picked up yesterday and can't sell them until later today.
---
I've been waiting 4 this what platform is this on
---
It does make some sense to save them.  Unopened, they weigh 0.1w.  A single plan weighs 0.25 and most booze weighs 1.
---
That being said, I’ll do a farming run, come home, and open them all at once.
---
that's what I just said, they track according on amount of items you have but are unable or unwilling to track any further atm even though it would probably be an easy one for them to implement something to check for amount of stars or kills in a given timeframe
---
No idea what you're talking about.
---
Honestly this update was pretty good. Kudos to bethesda on this one
---
As an electrician myself I have to say that the conduit they provide is actually decent for a game. And if used efficiently looks good.
---
I couldn't agree more!
---
More importantly it will cure all diseases at one, not just 1 disease which is nice ... too bad the found is sort of in the middle of WhiteSprings or that there weren't more scattered at key locations/towns.
---
Good question
---
Pretty sure their damage is way lower than advertised. I got an explosive one that says it's does like 400 dmg, but takes probably 10 shots to kill a super mutant?
---
Also good job!
---
Agreed
---
Yup I know, but it is frustrating your camp gets destroyed, this was happened way before wastelands, but yeah I get areas get reserved but still ..
---
Ill give you 25k :) haha
---
8 from collision corse but we were a party of 3.
---
That is a great deal.
---
My wisdom is don’t make a shotgun build bc they’re damage sucks relative to everything else but if you do I recommend bloody or instigating and focusing on perks that cripple. You could also go with a stealth shotgun build but other than that they’re not very viable late game
---
Been playing almost everyday 4 the past year in some way or another and I've had like 3 maybe 4 issues
---
9 in big bend but 5 were headless so I couldn't kill them. The number of plain legendary scorched is a bit out of whack. Not complaining but I'm dumping their one star stuff left and right.
---
Do it in a group or with some friends, yeah it's buggy for sure .. I have two characters and 1 sees the steam the other doesn't ..  did it with a friend and he was fine .. also you don't have to do every pipe, just do the minimum .. may or not work but I think you going to need at least 1 other person.
---
While i believe a big part of the is due to misinformation (for example people claiming wastelands is fallout first content even though it's not) peoole blame the game developers for literally everything when in reality the people to blame are the people suits and in charge of the big companies
---
You're a franchise owner: you own two McDonald's. One is in a great location, has a history of community outreach, and is well-respected by the locals. You want to sell the McRib only on certain months of the year, but your store manager vehemently disagrees. You notice that things change around the store: it's a little dirty inside, the parking lot hasn't been washed in a month, and employees are verging on disrespect when you visit. Worst of all, the community seems to have taken notice and *sales are down*. 
---
What do you do? Are you going to sell the store?
---
No, this performance is not Todd &amp; Company trying to get released.
---
Just curious have you gone to a script machine to see what it does like the amount It says it will give you
---
Agreed but with an increased efficiency of the Santa collectron please.
---
5.  Outside Morgantown airport.  I’ve been have extreme luck with Morgantown airport/trainyard, helvita and the water park.
---
Quad double barrel. 50 crit or limb is super fun.
---
Some servers you just have to leave due to the rubber band effect but mostly it's not too bad.
---
Do not get rid of it transfer it to an alt lmao
---
"Found".  Probably just made this post as "evidence" of innocence when they ban hammer you.
---
Exactly this, came to see if it was just us.
---
Yes same here. Or like when you glitch one part of a house into something, then you go to do it to the other side to make it even and it's like "you cant place object, intersects another object" and youre like BOI and have to redo the whole thing like 5 times till you can do it.
---
My only problem with those challenges is that you have to complete them in order before you can start earning progress towards the next reward. I thought they said they would look at ways to make earning the rewards less of a grind but it looks like they made it more of a grind.
---
Legendary items have always had five stars, but we can currently only find up to three effects legitimately.  It’s been that way since launch.
---
Obviously the devs planned on up to five, as part of looking toward the future.  Every MMO/online game does this sort of thing.  Power levels increase as time goes on.
---
Rumor has it that 5 star gear will be obtainable with Wastelanders, and there will be five star enemies.  Whether this is a unique event boss or just random enemies in the wild, I have no idea.  I’m leaning toward an event boss, likely the wendigo colossus.
---
I love my shotguns. Be advised that they are very short range weapons, so pick perks that help your damage resistance while you get whacked by groups or pick perks that allow you to run away and blast the enemies as they line up to chase you. Sneak is another option; my bloody suppressed shotgun is murder when it's within arm's length of a victim.
---
Minecraft does it as well as a few other's. There's a full list here https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/all-cross-platform-games/%3famp
---
Yea I posted about that last week. It's gunna be a hell of a grind after the first 3 challenge rewards.
---
nah
---
Too bad we can't bottle it
---
Honestly? Nothing.
---
I would keep away until Wastelanders DLC.
---
You missed all the stuff added in the last 6 months
---
They are good for crippling, because of the game being unable to read damage (you hit for 800 and the game says: "no, it can't be true" and the enemy regenerates 90 percent of the damage).
---
My advice is: contemplate a dual build. Carry the shotgun but use those 15 points in strength to punch or 2h melee enemies. You need STRONG hits, because the shotgun won't do shit to real enemies. 
---
For crippling, nothing beats the shotgun. 100 percent crippling effect with perk: enforcer, leaving enemies defenseless. Sheepsquatchs with broken legs are harmless. 
---
My shotgunner is a mixed unarmed + shotgun + explosives, and it is fun.
---
Right, the inner salesman tells me to drown the fountain, bottle it up, sell it as family water and call myself Nestle, lol.
---
Most of those come from players using the railway rifle not exactly random just kinda trolly that it lets everyone else pick them up
---
Put it back. Lol.
---
If they can take our money and our love, they have to take the hate. 
---
Maybe our criticism is misplaced, but that would mean our money and love also...
---
That sucks, she tried having a teddy bear collection back before display cases were a thing, one day she logged in and realized half of then had been scrapped. We’re playing again after a decent length hiatus and I guess I got my hopes up that a lot of these awful and unfun bugs had been dealt with.
---
Sometimes I would use a floating method to build and hang half or full walls to build into the ground to give an illusion of a foundation.
---
Are your pistols better than, say, a rifle build? Are you doing the pistol/rifle combo with the modified pipe revolver?
---
Afaik it all comes from one quite infamous RMTer, who was crying here two months ago about his "hacked" accounts (turned out he was using 3rd party script that stole his credentials), and his clique of like-minded individuals.
---
It does quite baffle me why Bethesda just won't delete all the accounts that have such items on them...
---
It is on all friends.
---
Its pretty easy to find all.of the teddy bears if she wanted to recollect
---
This exactly. I’ve been using shotguns for a week, to my surprise crippling doesn’t work much. When I’m surrounded by 20 ghouls, and i manage to hit every one of them with pellets, maybe one or two will lay flat on the floor ‘crippled’, the rest just laugh at me and my 3x Enforcer card. It’s a build for struggle and ‘near death’ experience. I’m playing with the double barrel shotguns because I want the DOOM feel.
---
Overall, I  like it.   
---
 Have been slowly but steadily getting the mounted head plans and SantaRon amuses me greatly.
---
Have found the “everything died when I walked in and doesn’t respawn” thing still exists in some areas, though.
---
Wood and rubber. You will collect tons from scrapping weapons. Gears from mole miner scrap. Glass and oil because I don’t use them at all and always have a ton for some reason.
---
If people believe this, you’re not just wrong, you’re stupid
---
I still whip out my shotguns every once I a great while they are nerfed they are still  viable , that being said crafting ammo sucks donkey balls you will need to add plastic to your farming route , get used to cleaning up cafeteria trays at Watoga high school
---
I've gotten like 5 UGL recipes from the Holiday Gifts so far.
---
Okay this is cute af 👌🏼
---
I'd keep it, but stow it away for later use. Might wanna open a support ticket questioning its legitimacy just to cover your ass since they like to mass ban rather than go case by case.
---
I think that's what everyone here figured would happen yeah. I think the steam release will probably not be the same day as Wastelanders but the first patch after
---
Nah too many little things that show poor communication and shotty work being put into the game. People are put in charge of certain divisions for a reason and if they cant manage and motivate the staff thats on them. You win as a team and fail as a team. You dont get to just blame the rich corporation or rich guy for the failures.
---
I came back (and left again) after a similar timeframe.
---
Lots of qol but content wise they haven't done much at all.  
---
The endgame loop is still repetitive and simple.  New content isn't rewarding for the effort either.
---
Dude the game has less the. 200 viewers on Twitch in total. That goes down as well as play counts across both modes. Wake up.
---
Ok, did not realize there was a finite cap, never been close yet.
---
Well I still get them so kinda hard to believe you
---
Fortunately I'm not asking you to.
---
Anything I have too much of.
---
Take it off?
---
Don’t like to call people liars but this reddit is full of trolls so which are you?
---
No ty tho
---
Thanks Bro ❤️
---
Yea my old single mule got screwed when they implemented it, was just a lvl 15 with 15 char and hard bargain for maxing caps everyday had 32k lbs on him.(was hording power armor too)
---
Well I posted because I'm having these issues. I'm pretty sure lying about it would not benefit me in any way. I just want to know if others are having these issues as well. I don't get my tokens or flux. The same thing is happening to my teammate. Other events just glitch out and wont even let me finish them. So, you can call me a liar all you want and honestly I really don't care. Enjoy your day.
---
15 at Glass Cavern with a team of 3
---
I agree on wood, oil, and gears, but disagree on glass and rubber because you can use those to make marine tactical helmets, which sell well to vendors.   I also support gold, silver, asbestos, and antiseptic as mentioned below in other posts.
---
I got one in about 16h. didn't have a collectron before.
---
Oh cool didn’t know that works thanks.
---
No because I want the legendary effects to be activate.
---
That face. You're too cute. Nice outfit. Xoxo
---
Poor fella never had a chance
---
The fastest way i found is to get a ripper and have a friend initiate pvp with you. Open your pip boy and let him go to town on your limbs. I say open your pip boy because you dont stagger when your in it, plus it allows you to spam nuka quantums or whatever healing item you want, plus you can watch your armor degrade. On a side note, this seems to have been buggy here lately. Tryed it the other night and and it seemed like my armor wouldnt degrade at all. Usually a server hop fixes this.
---
&gt;enjoying
---
same, really  enjoying it, at least this will make December pass faster in the long wait for Waslanders :)
---
And i have gotten some really nice planes the last days...
---
And you can also do the pre wastlanders unmarked quest, that will take you some long time to complete if you don't cheat, lol
---
This doesnt work. Ive tried it many times and my armor Durability never budges.
---
Christmas themed apparel would be nice to have, yes. But, this is a nice change of pace IMO. Besides, I’m enjoying getting those mounted plans.
---
I’m going to have to disagree for with you on this because I think this is kind of perfect for new players. They don’t have to join an event (like the Halloween event) that’s probably going to cause them to crash almost every time. The scorched come in all levels so anyone can participate from fresh out of the vault to those crazy people in the hundreds. This allows them to play the base game and not have to stop to join an event and then go back and pick up where they left off. They can just do the story and find scorched on the way - which there are a lot of in the beginning. Plus there’s lots of low level legendaries being dropped right now too which is perfect to give to new players. In addition - some people won’t have time to grind events since they’ll be with their families for whichever holiday they partake in. 
---
Also many of the mounted head plans dropping right now were not currently in the game with the exception of the bugs. And the other plans were rare drops so it’s nice to have a better chance at actually getting them. Looking at you plasma grenade.
---
Rubber, cloth, nuke waste, gold, silver
---
So lucky! I’ve played about 40 hours since Tuesday and haven’t got anything.
---
Each to their own. I got bored of dropping whatever I was doing once an hour for Halloween and meat Week events after the first few days so I like being able to grind this one out at my own pace.
---
More money More problems
---
Actually it’s cause me to explore more as well. Sure we’ve been fast traveling to highly populated scorched areas but yesterday a friend and I just wandered around the ash heap because I’ve never really spent any time there because there’s no real reason too outside of killing Evan and doing encryptid so it was fun to see new places there- and I’ve been playing since Beta
---
Nope. Nice try, though.
---
This looks so fucking good. I thought the war drum was edited in.....thats how accurate it looks!
---
Really? Because they all do the same stuff. If anything, Bethesda is behind the curve on predatory business practices, with FO76 atleast. There's no loot boxes, and no gear hidden behind a paywall. People like to "say stuff like this" because it's true. Take a basic business management course and you can see for yourself.
---
Just jad to delete like 10 random sets of PA and a metric shit ton of ill gotten junk and ammo from the tirst trap glitch
---
Exactly- I found myself just sitting in whitesprings the whole time and not really going out to do other things because I didn’t want to miss the event. And then more than half of the time the event crashed anyway. I think this allows new players to still keep progressing in the story or quests without having to stop to participate.
---
I'm having fun
---
I put all my ammo up at 0caps except 5.56 and plasma cores. 5.56 is currency, I've done trades for 50-100k in 5.56 because the cap limit is so, well limited.
---
I want to hear the sound it makes! Looks great.
---
The challenges that are completed apply to you overall across all your avatars. The individual scout challenges and the like are individual to each avatar.
---
Challenges have always been linked to the account not the character
---
I mostly use meelees but you don’t have to give me anything! I got my save back and I did some challenges to get like 2 legendaries. Thank you though!
---
No, there are enemies that will drop 50 at a time
---
Nope.  But I'm ready to equip a little league team when the wastelanders get here.
---
I wouldn't do it unless you just like crippling squirrels and laughing about it
---
It was a small present to nothing special. I still love the comments. It's worth every 0 atoms. The only stuff I buy from the atom shop is stuff for my camp but only so I can keep a cosy atmosphere lol.
---
Do you have a lot of light up letters at that camp?
---
Wait HoW yOu get ThaT
---
Use Google, you can find it at Google.com
---
Right but that’s not what I said, I said aren’t people a bit gutted there’s no rare apparel Christmas themed drops etc....
---
Lmao some of them. Ones with swing speed especially. The bloodied SS +1 strength is a real collectors item!
---
Again, like other posts.. my main point is the lack of Christmas/Holiday apparel and item drops and if people wanted those.
---
What about both.... Scorched that drop certain rare Christmas loot and a main event. Hardly hard for Bethesda.
---
I feel for people who pay the kind of money needed to have a good PC (and to keep it good). Just to have it be easier for toxic people to be toxic.
---
Also random thought, anyone else find it kinda funny that the thing that can bring PC master race to their knees is a "console" command?... ok no just me... k I'll leave now
---
😁
---
Bitch and moan bitch and moan
---
I'm a hoarder of lead, steel and acid.  I make tons and tons of ammo to sell.  I spend more time looting and crafting than anything.  The only mobs I kill are because they are in the way of a barbell...
---
But you can spend an hour or two looting areas in the forest and get tons of lead.  Its easy to find. Scrap the scorched weapons and boom tons of steel.
---
Are you on pc? I would give a great deal for those raider pa piece plans ^^
---
How many caps did all that cost?
---
No, seriously, thanks. I read the whole thing too, but it needed to be condensed. It's a game. This is reddit.
---
So I don’t like to call people liars but this Reddit is full of trolls, which are you?
---
Good post, thanks for sharing!
---
👍
---
I am aware of the structure and have tried to use it a number of times but there is never any water there for me, anyone else encounter this issue?
---
Yeah an additional event might have been nice too and some more in game outfits - I’ve seen a bunch of datamined outfits but I’m sure they will be atom shop. Unless they’re planning a New Years event but I doubt it at this point
---
Fortunately that's not a trophy/achievement. Just a challenge within the game.
---
Good. But that wasn’t the point. I wanted to see a flux of people agreeing that there should have been or should be Holiday/Christmas drops from the Scorched. Rather than just plans and junk.
---
Ohh ok
---
Doesn't work, at least not for me, stood on acid for about an hour, just moving a bit to stop the game timing out.
---
No damage.
---
Idiots and Assholes jump on the hate train, especially a certain youtuber who loves to call people who enjoy a game a BETHESDA FANBOY. It's incredibly easy to make these videos and the funny part is that often if they show their own gameplay, they're often like level 2. They don't try the game or even care about video games in general. The actual fans just enjoy the game. Yes, I do think that scrap/repair kits and Fallout 1st are awful, but the base game is great and (most) of the cosmetics are reasonably priced, especially considering how easy it is to earn atoms. 
---
To be clear, Fallout 76 was my first ever Bethesda Game.
---
This game's community is great, and I also think this may have to do with the heavy RP type mechanics like CAMP building and character customization.
---
I can see what you mean. There’s a datamine that has some new Christmas outfits and skins in addition to the gingerbread stuff but I’m pretty sure it’s all going to be atom shop stuff. It would have been nice to have a mid-low chance for a new outfit although I don’t particularly want themed outfits. I think the Halloween pumpkin suits are gaudy as well as the blue Christmas suits from last year in the atom shop
---
&gt;It's a game. This is reddit.
---
Reddit76 goty
---
Console pleb I'm afraid. Sorry bud
---
Did you check your inventory to see if you rcvd items and it just didn’t flash on your screen?
---
I didn't realise, call me dumb 😜
---
Thanks!
---
Maybe people dont agree with you and just want to have fun with it?  Not everyone wants the same things and it seems like you are just butt hurt that the masses arent agreeing with you
---
They recently moved bulb letters to lights which can take up considerably more budget. I would check if you have those or neon signs and letters.
---
Maths was never my strong subject but I got you.
---
75 x 1400 = a shit ton of caps.
---
Thanks, funny how I never realised this, I need to open my eyes. Cheers!
---
I maintain that, like Legendaries, it's possible to exhaust their numbers as a server gets older.  Just change servers until you find one that seems more plentiful.
---
Right so the steel part is now under control, somewhat.
---
So you don't have a certain place where you find tons of lead?
---
It literally is though LOL!!!! That’s like saying Anthems less than 100 concurrent viewers across all of Twitch doesn’t mean their game is dying.
---
The top grossing games are all the top games on Twitch. Fornite, Apex, LoL (all games with the largest concurrent player based and viewers), WoW, etc. It’s an easy way of figuring out how much interest a game is drawing which is why the industry consistently equates a communities health to Twitch viewership. There charts on Twitch just like Steam. When it goes to steam we can revisit this discussion and I’ll link a physical chart of the player-base dropping drastically so you white knights can stop riding Bethesda’s analog stick already. Online games need money to continue development and if there’s no customer watching/playing your game it’s not making enough to warrant continued development from someone as big as Beth.  Hence why Elder Scrolls: Legends now rests in its grave. 
---
I don’t know why you continue to insist that the health of one game mode doesn’t hurt the health of another. I play both and have since release and these hackers exist in BOTH game modes. There used to be three and Survival had issues so they removed it. Next it will be Nuclear Winter and then it will be the entire game and you will be sitting here asking: “Why?”
---
The game is fun and the community is not that toxic. Most of the hate comes from the low IQ sheep who follow trash like yong yea and jim sterling
---
I dunno why so many people hate on shotguns. I run 3 max shotgun perks adrenaline, bloody mess, enforcer with an instigating explosive double barrel and can run west tek one or two shotting most supers. The queen and flying stuff I switch to heavy guns. Nuke silos are easy too. I cripple assultrons legs and they take maybe a 3rd or 4th shot.
---
I just walk through a town.  Sutton.  Grafton. Ect and just go in buildings and loot items that yield lead.
---
I know that's probably not super helpful.  I never seem to run out.  But I'm a weird person who enjoys searching through houses for items...
---
Right, I guess that's one way to do it. Better than anything I've come up with. Cheers
---
Pharmafarmer is also pretty good.  It has a high proc rate and you can get lots of stick packs/med X with it.  Easier to stay alive if you can heal :)
---
The character cap limit hasn't done anything to stop inflation, or limit prices. That makes it entirely arbitrary, and it should be removed. No other online RPG has such constraints on the basic currency. 
---
It goes with my other statement though, it's there to encourage us to log in more often, thus increasing chances for atom sales.
---
Nw Dumb
---
Well looks like they tried everything on there end, I got on today and I didn’t get disconnected so maybe it worked it self out. Thanks every for giving me advice. Rather it was the game or my Internet I’m just happy to be back playing! Cheers everyone.
---
Neither of my characters has rifle expertise.  That's sort of left to the third character, whenever I say that in earnest.  On my alt, she benefits from the Pipe Revolver's duality, but the main doesn't.
---
The first day was nuts, now I seem to be finding less and less as the days go on. Suppose they nerfed them with the hotfix?
---
Except 76 isn't making more money than the average love service game. It's making much less.
---
Remind me, why images are not allowed on Fallout 76 subreddit?
---
Yes they finally fixed it, getting tons of water now
---
What console? Hahahaha
---
Nobody mentioned lucky hole mine? It's common knowledge. Especially if you have excavator armor in 1 run you'll have lead ore for days. Finding acid to smelt all that lead maybe needs another post lol...
---
PS4. It's a pro though, I'm not a total reprobate!
---
Do you think they will officially announce it? I would say just do it.
---
Darn, im on an xbox one x
---
Loot boxes are fine so long as they're earnable in-game. Gear behind a paywall, like game changing gear, is rare in any game.
---
I'm comparing Bethesda to good devs and publishers, that don't do those predatory things. You don't compare them to the worst of the worst and say at least they're better those guys. What a low standard to hold someone to.
---
'Hey that guy just robbed me, but hey it's OK, compared to a murderer he's not that bad.' How silly.
---
I had 4 in collision course. 3 outside on the airport grounds and 4 inside the airport building.
---
Love it, just want to remove scrip limit for vending machines. I have WAY TO MUCH LEGENDARIES! Take them!
---
Yes, make walls and then scrap the foundation!!
---
You know that a water fountain is a metal sink where you can drink water from, right? Not a water feature fountain?
---
The award window is bugged but I'm still getting the items.
---
Oh right the mine, I was actually on my way to build the excavator armor, ran out of oil, gave up, started making ammo, ran out of materials, made this post.
---
And I swear to god everytime I NEED acid they're all gone. Vault tec should have invented an oven to cook your stuff.
---
I’m loving this event, and I’m not disappointed in a lack of holiday apparel—I just don’t really care about that. I’m also seeing lots of players come together at the various Scorched related events around the map—Line In The Sand, Surface to Air etc.
---
My very first encounter with them netted 12 at Morgantown Airport.   Haven't even come snywhere close since (and Iran into a grand total of zero when I toured the Big Bend Tunnel last night.)
---
That's the thing. I'm pretty sure Bethesda is just selective. The moment they catch wind of mods that spoofs the game into thinking you have an active 1st subscription and lets you have unlimited stash, they're going to come cracking down on everything. Till then, it doesnt hurt them in any way shape or form. 
---
If you want to push through any changes, make them feel it.
---
Aw shame. Console plebs 4 life! Cross play one day hopefully (lol!)
---
It just didn't flash on my screen. Sometimes it has delayed before but not show up at all. 
---
It usually shows me the items I get from the quest.
---
I hope so tbh hahahaha
---
doing gods work.
---
I'll have to look at my inventory then, fuzzy token farming is annoying.
---
Of course they are going to announce a new questline...
---
It’s not like an actual quest and more of a scavenger hunt
---
Ok. So it’s not just me and I’m not crazy. 😂
---
So what solution do you propose? Cause that was exactly the point of me saying that. I’m not asking for that rule to be removed because I agree with it. I’m saying that there’s no solution to this game breaking problem being provided by developers and it’s existed for months. If customer service doesn’t respond to tickets, there’s no anti-cheat, and people are begging in Twitter and Reddit for their tickets to be answered a serious issue exists.
---
I would like this but at the same time I don’t want to have to start over to be a ghoul.
---
The code for the vault door is 6 digits.
---
Lucky Hill mine in excavator armor for lead ore, the Charleston fire department and the Lodge in Flatwoods have weights and the can traps at top of the world and Sunnyvale station are my route , I have so much lead that my focus is now acid
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lead_(Fallout_76)
---
This gives you a list of items that give lead.
---
Flatwoods gym under the motel usually has a ton of bar bells or curl bars laying there.  Gives a good yield.
---
Paints give 7 lead each.  Combination wrenches give 2.  Rat poison gives 5.  These items are all over shops and houses.
---
Wouldn't this not be the case when taking Private Servers into account?
---
Agreed, it feels like that at least.
---
Unfortunately I don’t have an Xbox or I’d be playing on that.
---
I would like the option of turning into one or starting as one. 
---
I would also love the option to be a super mutant.
---
I think it was bumped to  +35% to scorched,the last time they fiddled with it.
---
Loot boxes almost always cost real money, in almost every example in every game. CoD was notorious for locking the best equipment behind a paywall.
---
I'm comparing Bethesda to other AAA game companies, which is appropriate, because those are their competitors. It's not a good vs bad argument, none if then are inherently "evil".
---
I know you desperately want to be right on this, but you're not. You're dead wrong, and even the arguments you present are flawed. Just move on dude.
---
It's all good. Just bragging rights on console to say you "completed" the game and beat all the extra stuff.
---
You said a lot more than that lol
---
Sit on a lead extractor, 14 lead every 10 minutes or so, as for the steel do some super mutant runs grab up all the weapons they drop and scrap them with scrapper. I have 33k steel and 15k+ in lead since FO 1st came
---
Yeah I could agree with that - I’ve always wanted to be a ghoul - I just don’t really want to start over to do it. and super mutants would be cool as well. I’m low key hoping there will be some kind of  super mutant settlement of not necessarily hostile mutants with wastelanders.
---

---
oh you don't believe him?
---
Incompetent developers is what’s bringing the “PC master race” to its knees. And it sucks because I just want the game to be good. Glad to hear console players are enjoying Nuclear Winter though! :)
---
Lines right up with the free weekend, people are going rampant lmao
---
WHAT ARE YOU SMOKING? Adventure has plenty of full servers and Beth is trying.
---
I had fun. After they killed survival mode the amount of shitty players increased noticeably. When they pulled the paid membership bait and switch with wastelanders I called it quits. I can already see that being paid dlc. The end game content is boring and stale as all hell after awhile as well. Mostly good player base however. While you can find sources of entertainment in Appalachia, it's just not a good game.
---
West Tek for steel (scrap weapons)
---
Lucky Hole for lead
---
Vault Raid for acid
---
What you or I say doesn't make me right. Bethesda's actions make me right, regardless of what you think. You want think that Bethesda is some amazing company, after all they've done with 76. Or at the very least, you want to hold them to the incredibly low standard of 'at least they're not the worst.' go for it. You don't want to see what's right in front of your face? Not my problem. Enjoy your fantasy world.
---
100% agree with you. They are really dropping the ball on not cracking down hard.
---
I got one in the first 15 minutes after the event started none since.
---
Yes! Like another Broken Hills type settlement where supermutants, ghouls, and humans could coexist.
---
Thanks for the help! My fallout is having problems all together. Every time I open my stash box it changed to a new number. I tried dropping stuff, transferring, all to no avail. I was able to go to a different vendor and buy it though so at least all hope is not lost
---
How do you know it was a man
---
While I agree its the Men In Suits calling the shots at the end of the day, I think Todd, Pete et al have been made to eat a big shit sandwich by their corporate overlords. Sure, Todd's basically a meme now but I'm of the opinion he was just doing his job... unfortunately his job was to put on a swanky leather jacket and hype up a game that wasn't anywhere near ready \*AND\* double down on that rhetoric not just on  Launch Day, but on every. subsequent. fuck up. since. Pretty sure he didn't envision that being part of the job when he was working on Morrowind..  
---
Unfortunately, people need a scapegoat and a punching bag... Todd was already well known enough in the gaming community that he was always going to cop it when things inevitably went sour.
---
u/BethesdaReplied  u/BethesdaGameStudios_ Please return Fusion Cores to the generators in the open world. I'm not sure if it's only on Private Servers - but it's still BS.
---
I couldn’t agree more with this post. Then pull it and put all development towards Adventure because the game needs to get better in some way, shape, or form if it is to continue, Keeping a game mode up to get more skins sales is a sellout move.
---
Except you're wrong. So very, very wrong. Your arguments defy all logic, and all the facts. Just because you want to be right, doesn't make it so. I'm grounded in reality, you're grounded in a world where video game companies should operate like a charity, putting your wants before their profit margins. Never going to happen, nor should it.
---
Yeah, its part of their schtick, man. Just leave them be, they ain't hurtin' nobody.
---
😄 its wonderful!!! Great job!!
---
Mine come in waves. If I see one, I see ten. After I see the wave I wont see another for an hour or so. Line in the sand is a guaranteed event that I always see holiday scorched in.
---
But, that just works...!
---
Alas one of my favorite heavy weapons that was badly impacted by the last patch. My explosive flechettes version simply wears out far to quickly to be usable. It only lasts for a about two dozen shots now before breaking. Dense chest and the Fireproof Perk are the key to survival though as many have previously mentioned.
---
That's not the world I'm in. I'm in the world where there are many Triple A game devs and publishers out there, that make quality, mostly bug free games. That don't push microtransactions, that fix issues in their games. That don't lie to their players, etc. And still make a profit in their games just fine. The things Bethesda hasn't been doing. Yes there are also companies out there worse than Bethesda. Great. They don't matter, because they're worse. Bethesda already has them beat. I'm talking about how, by comparison, Bethesda can do better, but because people hold them to such a low standard, they probably never will.
---
I had this would my textures were above medium but I run everything else on Ultra.
---
That’s what i said after the hotfix. It’s way fewer now. Some would try to explain everything away with RNG, what they fail to realize is RNG is strictly based on pre set chance and won’t go above that preset. If that rate is tweaked down we’ll see fewer legendary/drop, simple as that.
---
I don’t think it’s the developers though which is why I said someone in this Reddit could run the company more efficiently. This extends beyond that. It’s gotta be the front office that’s preventing the developers from doing what they want in order to push more monetization. 
---
Sucks to see all the hate towards the developers when this was the live service part of 76 was just thrown on them but at this point who knows what’s going on :(.
---
No - I don’t doubt him in the slightest about the new hack. But this guy has been beating the “iS fO76 dEaD oN pC nOw?!” drum in like every thread I’ve seen today.
---
Bit overly dramatic.
---
I said, what what, in the butt
---
SQB has super high explosive resistance, nukes are a waste.
---
Oh right, I forgot
---
Aha! What's the best weapon to use against it? Energy?
---
I've been getting a lot of use out of it. Great for the holiday Scorched. You can always find Santa at the mall
---
Exactly, this community is no different than any other online community.
---
This. Hackers exist on Adventure as well Nuclear Winter is just OBJECTIVELY (opinion) more fun because you’re fighting other players. Once that’s dead or pull the problem will become far more prevalent and you’ll see people upset about that too.
---
There are now legendary ones, so they are more worth killing.
---
I'd pay caps to hire one to hang out at my CAMP, sweep the floor, fertilize my garden, milk the cow and collect from my extractors while I'm away blowing the heads off his / her cousins. Give him / her a line of ghoul dialog or, let us program our own line of dialog to help hark our wares for sale in the vendor. And, let us dress them in some outfits.
---
I like your positive outlook.
---
Bethesda, for real, you need to fix this shit
---
Hmm, rare plans that I've not been able to find in game for months or more garbage seasonal clothing like those halloween suits...not really even a choice for me, I'll stick with this one thanks.
---
Oh yeah it’s good for finding those Scorched but at the same time more could be done, especially with the addition of NPCs
---
Yeah I did a legendary rolling pin - so does that mean I can make some legendary cakes? 😀
---
And a ton of other BoS items please, I cannot believe we are past the year mark and still have not had any substantial BoS faction packs in the atomic shop. It's like you hate money bethesda.
---
Oh no, 100% I love my Santatron I just wish it gave me presents during the event is all. His little comments are hilarious and it really adds something to my previously lonely camp 👌🏻
---
Do you have food in storage, or any other perishables?  As they spoil they change weight.
---
THIS. This was the reason for my whole post. How can they not respond to such a massive wave of complaints about a single hacker. The hacker issue in general has gotten out of hand... I guess they’re waiting for free weekend to end?
---
That just seems like a really poor decision on their end if that’s the case.
---
You seriously believe in the war on Christmas?
---
Oh okay my bad lmao I hadn’t seen. This game is nowhere near dead. NW is pretty dead, but the base game is active as hell
---
It still has the ridiculous tricentennial picture though. Personally I wish we had a way to toggle those off, but its kinda ridiculous that raiders and free state people can make their factions obvious and the rest of the factions cannot via salute.
---
Really? Which AAA companies are those, that don't use microtransactions, never have bugs, and never have to change their plans about a game? You keep saying they exist, but all the ones I know of participate in all the same practices, because that's the way that market is right now.
---
Hint: There aren't any. Stop making things up and speaking in generalizations. It's not helping your case any.
---
I love the game but I don't expect Bugthesda to EVER help me out with any easy fixes. You just gotta play it like it's a 15 year old single player game.
---
Are you selling the lights? Or the mothman?
---
That's for Lakeside Cabins, it's always been there. Cabin 3 safe key.
---
It took me about 200 large crafted gifts to get all the mounted creatures. Roughly 60 of those were to get the last two I needed. Luckily I had enough camp budget to put them all on display. I haven't see any of the rarer creatures from dropped gifts.
---
Its a wastelanders teaser.  They did same thing for NW with the loot crates and the dead overseer.
---
Not sure and good question. I ended up putting away my zealots explosive pump shotty with Prime receiver for my AAE hand made which took 2 rounds to take out scorched at the Line in the Sand event. Shotgun took 3 or more rounds with all 3 shotgun perks at strength on.
---
Very constructive comment and I couldn’t agree more, Zak! I also thought about the developers hiring a “undercover player” to look into reports and it’s would definitely help their customer service confirm the validity of player reports. An anti-cheat was just an obvious solution but not necessarily needed for a Buy-to-Play game. IP/system bans could also be issued. Thanks for providing to the discussion! :) 
---
A few of the console players seem to misunderstand where these posts are coming from. We all love the game and just want to see it grow and improve.

Strictly chems and drinks. I keep all my food on me because it spoils less w/ good with salt perk. I've never had it happen before and it's driving me nuts. It goes from 770 to 802 to 780 to 806 and the cycle continues every time I open it!
---
I like that idea too...
---
Only real way to achieve it for you now is to start a new character and then re-explore fresh...
---
Use a JFFr 10mm pistol with can for every day waste-landing .
---
Consider me suitably envious. I still haven't pulled the bloody thing.
---
If you're going to repeat what I've said, you really should quote me correctly. I didn't say there are devs that NEVER use microtransactions. Never said their games NEVER have bugs. Never said they NEVER change their plans about a game. I'm saying that there are devs and publishers that do all these things BETTER than Bethesda. Which is absolutely true, whether you believe it or not.
---
I can give one example, one that I like using because it pisses people off on this sub: Obsidian and Outer Worlds. They made, what is essentially, a Bethesda-style single player game, with little to know bugs and the bugs that did exist are incredibly minor and we're mostly fixed in a short time span. There's no microtransactions. And they did change their plans with the game when they had to delay it to make sure it was in a good position at launch. So it was, you know, finished at launch.
---
There's your example. You might be thinking that's just one example, but I can keep going if you like.
---
Very strange.  Ammo kits from the raid?  If those break apart during crafting, they add a lot of weight.
---
I’ve heard of a few on console but A) there’s FAR less and B) you see them even less often due to a larger player base on console.
---
The ranger armor is a cosmetic, it goes over your regular armor
---
Yup. Up from 25% at launch.
---
Yeah, I can’t disagree. It would be nice to have a separate brotherhood emote. Maybe even a whole bundle!
---
Could be even bigger than the Fasnacht event.  Lots of potential as a place for the player base to congregate and interact.  I like the way you think!
---
So is he saying that if your armor is at durability 0/0,  you still get the legendary effects from it? That’s good to know if that’s true
---
Of course gaming circle jerks defend this terrible game. I really believe redditors can be the most idiotic and damage controlling people on the face of the planet.
---
To answer your question, I joined two scorched events this weekend, and one of them I got a shitty legendary (that's no surprise there) but the second one I got nothing after constant fire upon her. So not sure what the deal is there
---
I understand that some players use Cheat Engine for legitimate reasons and for other games. I’m also sympathetic towards the fact that people may not want a multi-billion dollar company snooping their their files. I’m always open to trying different routes to tackle this issue. I just want to see it solved!
---
Yeah, will probably be selling all duplicates (over on that other sub that shall not be named!)
---
Honestly not sure, I just run a bloodied Commmando right now.
---
This isn’t a “questline” though.
---
Yeah, and I know I would still miss hidden things, so a tracker would really be a great gameplay addition.
---
I would like to buy it if you sell them. Hmu :)
---
anyone know where to get plans for more power connectors? i’m level 50 and still only have 2 lol
---
Will look good with a bloody Chef hat and Apron at least.
---
True, I was just able to find about 7 in Glassed Caverns by sticking around in the final cave before the elevator.
---
It is. Doesn’t auto-de-equip unlike FO4
---
And while equipped you get the benefits. Problem is Nuke zones. You can’t deal with them.
---
Try server hopping Whitespring and the train stations. I found mine in Watoga many moons ago. I have also seen Grahm with it before, but good luck tracking him down.
---
They don’t want to offend Christians who don’t like Christmas, sorry Holiday, being about that unfortunately, so ain’t going to happen.
---
Right now I would farm scorched for the holiday event, there are a lot at the Morgan town airport and high school
---
I’ll be damned, good to know
---
Sure mate. Will be sure to let you have first dibs when I start selling
---
Helplessness is such a shitty feeling...
---
🍪
---
Saw some guy with hundreds of every size of holiday gift, level over 1000, most likely a hacker
---
Explore
---
Two shot is ok, not great. TSE breaks super fast.  If it is the best you have it could be much worse so use it until you find better.
---
That looks amazing
---
Love the cosplay! And so glad u are getting the positivity u deserve for This! Some of those A holes on imgur need a better hobby... U Kick ass, vault sister!
---
I'll have to look in to that one. I don't think i have any ammo kits but I'm going to check when I get on in a bit
---
Did you look in the Atom shop? I found the sleeping bags were in there, I got no notification when I joined
---
alright, i’ll try that out, thanks!

If I sold Acid or lead, they'd be #1 &amp; #2
---
Yes, as I said it needs to be hidden from injections. To check the state of the game and ”how they actually are doing” I read both here and on other forums. I mean, not that long ago people could teleport to dev room, lol. Now people are aiming up in they sky and killing everyone in NW.
---
Nice! 
---
I still have to get the one for being in ground 0 for a nuke. I’ve tried it a couple times but haven’t been able to get quite in the center.
---
I just finished up all the trophies for FO4 so I really want the one for 76 for my collection.
---
Anti Armor, Explosive, Faster Fire Rate, and Junkies (Need 5 addictions) are good for full health builds. Two shot not so much. 
---
Bloodied for low health builds. 
---
I'd say go junkies if you are new. 50 percent extra damage with 5 addictions and you can go full health.
---
50 percent limb damage actually doesn't do more damage it just cripples them faster.
---
Shotguns are only okay if you uses vats for headshots. You need concentrated fire perk for this.
---
I blasted through the main quest and finished it before level 48.  From that point everything is super easy in terms of the fights.  I have tried to go back and do side quests but without the challenge it’s hard for me to enjoy.  If I were to do it again I’d do all the side quests I can and slowly inch along the main.  You will end up seeing more of the map and of the game.  Many of the side quests are really great little short stories.  My two cents.
---
It's on the side of the structure, not the middle bit if that's what you're trying to use.
---
That nuke one was hard and time consuming. I just got in there and launched the nuke on my camp and fast traveled to it before it hit. Lol
---
Assuming you were selling things to recoup 25% of the cost, each gift wrap costs 1056, so you spent 79.2k
---
Fuck wiping the servers why punish the innocent.
---
Mine just did that once, and 2nd time it just sat at loading screen forever until I force closed it... About to try for a 3rd time. My guess, server issues for us atm.
---
3rd attempted worked.
---
I didn't misquote you, that precisely what you said. Until I called you on it. You just don't want to be wrong, it's sad really.
---
Outer Worlds was an over hyped, over priced, ridiculously short Borderlands/Mass Effect love child. It doesn't hold a candle to the depth if any Bethesda game, and that lack if depth is what prevents microtransactions from being relevant there. Obsidian is not a AAA company, they're a failing indie studio. The ONLY reason people are so keen to support then is because of New Vegas. They have absolutely nothing else going for them. 
---
None of this changes the fact that you're wrong though. Just own it and move on dude. You're just kicking your own dead horse at this point.
---
Yea that’s why they released Santa outfit last year and why they have crashed Santa plan this year...
---
/s
---
Your inner fanboy came out with that reply. I think you just showed your true nature, put an end to this conversation and proved me right. Have a great day, friend.
---
Saw a post about hackers like this earlier today. That post had some pics. Those people looked like obese characters.  
---
Too bad they ruin the game for everyone. Even worse Bethesda isn't doint anything about it (i don't mean giving bans, but applying an anticheat or something).
---
More people farming the various areas vs typical respawn rates that we already know about?
---
Nice! Any Wardrum build pics?
---
I personally sell all ammo 1:1 and anything else I just put it for how much I feel it’s worth, if it doesn’t sell in a couple days I lower it’s price by a couple hundred and go from there
---
I pretty much only use my Mutants FFR Combat shotty at a nuked up Whitesprings. With just the 3 shot gun perks, tenderizer and glow site on, it'll stop running glowing ones with one shot, put them on the ground at 2 and make them dead at 3.
---
I sell my ballistic ammo for a cap per round, except .38 which I give away.
---
Energy ammo is two.
---
Missiles and mini nukes are five.
---
Cores are ten.
---
And I don't care what the market price is.
---
With enforcer perk 50% limb dmg will cripple on 1 shot almost 100% of the time. So regardless of dmg that shotgun has a lot of utility as a crowd control tool.
---
I want that. B252533frEx20%dmhburncrit+1p hm.
---
I have not. I’ll check now and get back to you!
---
Wiping everyone's inventory is overkill. It's not like everyone and their dog has one of these. And its PC only.
---
Theres so many existimg anti-cheats. Try cheating in a game like overwatch. You dont last 30 minutes. Yet here is cheater galore. Im so glad I decided to buy this game on console.
---
Geezus 150 and only 1 plasma grenade...
---
Been playing since beta, never been greifed. Have had 3 pvp encounters 2 were 'misunderstandings' (accidently shot someone who i guess then thought i was attacking them) and 1 guy who really wanted my workshop and we had an epic battle. 
---
Probly the most friendly player base of any online game iv ever played. 90% of the reviews and descriptions of 76 are true, but massively exaggerated
---
insane that you don’t want seasonal themed loot. looks like all the normal people have left the game and this sub.
---
Well thanks for telling me where this comes from because I don’t ever use fb.  My perception is that the player base is the most civil I’ve seen in my many, many years of gaming.
---
Yeah, not great odds but 1 was all I needed!
---
For the life of me, I can just never get conduits to work. Takes way too long to set up, and gobbles your budget. It's too bad, because it looks nice. :/
---
BGS did something. I get a ton more freezing on my laptop and PC. Sometimes it's the pip boy menu freeze (drinking water). Other times it's not identifiable what caused the freeze. Sudden crash to desktop is also not uncommon. They definitely made the game more unstable with this patch.
---
Who is she?
---
It’s one part of the game that really has people sticking around. You just know they’ll start selling increased camp budget for cash..
---
Agree, I'm not like oh missels go for 5? I'll Never sell for less, idc but if I can get a couple more caps, cool!
---
dude
---
you are amazing
---
i have been salt mining because of this for months
---
Fat mans and missile launchers beyond useless. Do yourself a favor and dump those mini nukes a relish the freed up stash space. The only time I needed a fat man was to complete the Atomics Fan Scout badge
---
Wait... you can start a new character at level 25??
---
go stand near a fissure and let scorchbeasts damage your armor
---
hang infront of high levels.  they will give u shit
---
I must have gotten a golden server last night then cause we hit like 15 in glassed cavern
---
What do you think the tetanus is for?
---
I always wear Fashionable Sunglasses with my vault suit/default Fallout outfits.
---
There’s a cool down if someone else has milked it before. If you’re trying to do the pioneer badge I just server hopped at flatwoods because there’s a lot of Brahmin there
---
Just luck. There are 3 Brahmin in a lake due east of top of the world. I have pretty good luck from them. There is also 3 in flat woods to try
---
The bandanna and sunglasses are a nice touch.
---
PC Master Race
---
About 2 weeks timeframe. The most difficult part was getting those metal looking dents in the center using foam. Otherwise, a fun build!
---
Next one is Outer Worlds. Definitely a MoonMan helmet with some type of heavy armor.
---
I'm playing a vegetarian character who lives with a bunch of cats, and I keep getting mounted animal plans that I refuse to learn or use. Including the cat head! I can feel the cats judging me, like they can see inside my inventory.
---
Thanks! :D The rust and weathering is my favorite part.
---
Lol. They KNOW!
---
Get the Excavator power armor and head to Lucky Hole Mine for around 400 lead in 10 minutes.
---
Get the Scrapper perk and scrap every weapon dropped by the Super Mutants at West Tek (except laser rifles). You'll get somewhere between 500 to 1000 scrap per run, depending on your stats. I get 20 steel per. You'll also get 5.56 from the mutants there, which will save you some ammo.
---
As for acid, the most casual way to do it is mark it for search and loot. Abraxo cleaner and antifreeze are just about everywhere. Whitesprings has a good amount outside in the laundry area. You can also take the workshop in the toxic valley, assuming you don't mind defending it from anglers, 4 waves of rad rats, etc.. Any insect can drop acid as well, so kill those bloodbugs, bloatflies and crickets!
---
Other locations for acid: Silva Farmstead usually has four or five bags of Chlorine, which give 3 each. Bags of fertilizer at the Vault Tec Ag center, Flatwoods, Lewisburg roof, Wixon Homestead, etc.
---
Do whatever you like.  But the main quest will walk you through the main points.
---
It’s a dull thud, unfortunately. It’s not real metal; foam and a concrete tube. The cans are real, though.
---
I used to give ammo away for free but after one too many high-levels coming along and swooping up all of it at once, everything sells for 1c each. Missiles, mini nukes, and grenades are too heavy to keep and so rarely used anyway. I dump them in a drop bag or world container.
---
Weapon and armor prices are so all over the place. Where I might sell a UNY combat armor limb with +1 STR for 750c, I might well find someone else selling the same thing for 2000c, and someone else selling it for the 91c in-game "list" price. And for the most part, the really good stuff is never listed in vendors anyway, they're trade-only.
---
Nope :/ not there
---
you're playing the free weekend, but you're paying for f1 for a month?
---
Looted a Legendary Scorched. (I made the war drum, and my boyfriend custom painted the Red Rocket Pip-Boy.)
---
I don't think Private Servers are consistently "fresh."
---
Welcome to the club.
---
" And when running from a fight, *don't run in a straight line*."
---
SERPENTINE!
---
LMAOOOOO i thought the first post about this was another hoax like the trade stealing shit from the game's infancy. I want to see an alien blaster with every legendary effect in the game to see if it can become a viable weapon at that point.
---
The ranger armor isnt actually armor its just clothes you wear over your armor.
---
Id say follow the main quest and grab everything that isnt nailed down! In the beginning scrap is very valuable especially if you want to build a camp and dont forget to gather a ton of wood, lots of new players dont realize you can get wood scrap from stumps and logs laying around the forest. Dont be afraid of high level players they'll probly give you useful supplies and plans
---
Thank you! I don’t play 76 that much anymore (cause of Outer Worlds), but I still had fun playing and making the cosplay.
---
It used to work great but then they nerfed it because it was useful. Bethesda fucking hates useful things in this game.
---
I've grinded and grinded to get a piece of seasonal loot in other games.  I was so happy to get it.  Then the season is over and I could careless about it.
---
The only seasonal item i ever used for a long time was the headless horsemen's flying mount in WoW.  I did that instance hundreds of times before I won the random on that one!
---
For the weekend since it's double xp just grind levels while it's easy, save fort building and all that jam for when it's not double xp. Go kill everything in nu-tek or the golf course, do the public events (specially uranium fever and violent night) and get up high.
---
idk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
what.... like walk around broadcasting to the area while your mic is next to your speaker or something?
---
TBH I'd love a radio station/antenna for my C.A.M.P... Maybe Beth could make it a feature... you collect old records and you can add them to your own playlist that's broadcast to the wasteland. Say its only 10 songs on a loop per player, but the whole Fallout library is out there.
---
&gt;Look, I play this game everyday out of bordedom.
---
Aaaaaand, there's your problem.  Go play something else.
---
I want it! Not badly enough to hack for it though.
---
I like the little accessories that go into making it vintage-y.
---
YES!
---
I can't say I'm surprised people aren't happy with simply duping existing god-roll items, but this is just ridiculous.
---
I would prefer to be able to have a vendor CAMP that you could set up in high profile locations, so that you could sell items without making players travel to the corners of the map, spending a tonne of caps in travel, and then, only IF they do, losing 10% to the great nothing, nowhere tax, that serves no other purpose but to drain caps from the game.
---
A Great Bazar somewhere on the map where you and all the other players could maintain a personal  stall, if you were on the server and had a vending machine.
---
To be honest, I wasn’t great at playing. I got to the third level then stopped. 
---
I chose Red Menace cause my favorite Fallout cosplay (and first armor build) was the Chinese Stealth Armor from Fallout 3: Operation Anchorage.
---

---
Explosive and energy are generally not the best choices for SBQ, though some higher end energy weapons do fine (with the right perks and build).  The easiest way to mitigate her heavy damage reduction is with weapons that do high single-shot damage.  .50 cal, gatling guns, etc.
---
Using those will depend on your guild though, as an unimproved heavy weapon still doesn't do great damage.  If you can have a set of perks to swap in (like str for heavy weapon perks), that's an option.  I run commando but swap in heavy guns for my str perks just for that fight.
---
Depending on your level and perks, this may or may not be a simple option for you.
---
they also can create various NPCs, Prydwen, and other things
---
Happy Holidays from Vault Tec to you too!
---
Thank you! :D
---
mf had a laser gun and 1 shot me
---
game is broken
---
bad game
---
i had full health
---
Same here. Nothing. Checked the store and still nothing.
---
Seems pointless to cheat, get banned, make a new account and repeat. There is literally zero benefit in doing that. Im on pc iv only ran into 1 person who was 100% cheating and maybe 3 other people i suspect were cheating. Maybe iv just been lucky but I play NW pretty regularly
---
It's wonderful looks real
---
Not that many, but I have it when it was just EVA foam and PVC pipe.

No.  Move along.
---
True that it used to work every time ... The game isn't meant to be easy though

1. Enjoy the game.  Do the quests, read the stories, listen to the tapes.  If you enjoy crafting to that.  If enjoy exploring do that.  If you want to level up really fast, farm mobs you can kill really quick and easily.
---
2. No. and No. not all items have armor.
---
50 is the cap on gear, there is no level cap.  You stop getting stat points at a certain point.  If you want to kill lots of stuff, pick one weapon type and get all the perks that do +% dmg for it.  All you need to do is hit each mob once and you'll get loot and xp off it , even if other people do 99% of the damage
---
Except none of that is true, and neither is anything else you've said. The conversation died a while ago, you just can't stand to be wrong 🤷‍♂️😂
---
You lay under it and gently suckle the teet.
---
They can just wipe weapons that have 4*+ and add new 5*weapons so the duped 3* are worthless
---
Looks like all pc did was master hacking this is quite upsetting if they wipe it all
---
Nuclear winter
---
Check your icons in the store when you're in-game.  Near the bottom *should* be the 'feeling fine' one, it's a pip-boy head with bandages.  Same with the 'welcome home' frame, it's near the end.
---
If it's not there, try re-linking the accounts again.
---
If it's there, the suit needs to be crafted, so you'd look for that in the armor crafting station.  The sleeping bags will be an option in the build menu where you have other sleeping backs (they're grouped, so you have to scroll the list to see them).
---
Amazing work. It’s not real metal? The look can definitely kill though 👍🏻👍🏻
---
Chain saw pls
---
Yeah I didnt try that lmao I feel dumb but it's ok cause I got nice floor boards now
---
Exactly.
---
Yep ... As the challenges are for earning atoms and Bethesda wouldn't want you to do all the easy ones again on a new character to earn free atoms.
---
Gotta get me some boats and codes
---
Make sure it's a male, milk, then run like crazy...
---
Oh... wait, that came out wrong, oh.... wait that made it even worse...
---
what i meant was, make sure it's a female, milk, then run like crazy..
---
This is the right tip
---
You on pc?
---
Id be worried that good players would end up being band for beig good. iv ran into a few people who may have been cheating but iv played with a lot of people who accuse every guy that downs them of cheating
---
Yea it’s pretty unpredictable. It happens most for me with pip boy repairs but it happens also with just about every other action in the game! I just wish they would actually do something about the stability and quality of these servers! My frame rate drops so low during fights that it’s damn near frozen too. I know they have the capabilities I just wish they would use them. Then maybe 80 percent of the gaming community might change their minds about this game (unlikely I know lol). I’m still going to play everyday I just would enjoy these type of improvements most.
---
My guess is that they planned a more substantial holiday event, but it would have depended on Wastelanders being already released. So the event would likely have involved interaction with Wastelanders characters, human NPCs, multi-choice dialogue, and so on. Obviously, that had to be scrapped once Wastelanders was delayed, so the scorched hunt event is something that was made quickly by a small number of people (most of the studio is working on the DLC by now) to still have something for the holidays.
---
Christ, at that point why not just use /killall?
---
All of it?  No.  
---
Plenty of it?  Yes.  
---
Monetisation?  It's not just them.
---
Pffff... +1 Perception. What a piece of junk.
---
I did 3 events at Camden. No completed window ever displayed &amp; I only got tokens once. The other 2 events I got nothing.
---
yeah..dont wear power armor, even naked is better
---
Mmmm.  Morrowind.
---
Yeah those aren’t there. I’ll try relinking I suppose.
---
Funny thing I already had it on my main from Census Violence, really hoping to pull Plasma Grenade plans at some point.
---
So, we think corporate wrote the patch that came out last week?    
---
It's everyone.  Burger King decides what's in a Whopper.  If I eat one and it's shit, that's the local store, and the guys who made it.

EVA foam, which I heated in a way that makes it look dent. Then, I used chrome paint and some shading techniques to get it to look like metal.
---
Everything old is new, again.
---
It's happened to me quite a few times, but never more than once.
---
Fantastic thank you!!!
---
You're fantastic. You're welcome also
---
You need yourself some Fireproof perk.  I point blank stuff with me BE harpoon gun without issue.  Same for my VE shotgun.
---
Also a touch jealous of the quad effect--I've got a quad and the BE, but QE sounds like a nice combo.  I only run mildly bloodied anyway, so quad might be superior here.
---
I would love my bloodied build even more if I can be a ghoul
---
This plus bones and glass, you get so many of them in regular gameplay.
---
All three and you don't need dense armor!  At least that's my experience.  YMMV.
---
Not at all.
---
I meaaaaaan I can basically fly and fall really slow. That's pretty super. What makes them so "Super" anyway? The fact that they're green? They still can't read.
---
Came here to say this!  Flechette mod on explosive harpoon is fantastic.
---
Can you please send whatever you did to fix it to the Bethesda team? Man this bug sucks worse than anything else in the game right now for me.
---
All ammo goes for one, dogfood as well. Raising to 2 completely stops the cashflow right away. Plans and recipes go for about 20-30 in my vendor, the very common ones for 5-9 or so. I want my customers to be happy. If a low level character comes to my vendors and I’m nearby I just give away some stuff for free. Responders‘ duty.
---
This is a good idea. Get people more if a reason to grind.  Ause once i hit my limit on caps and script im done playing.
---
I keep forgetting about this!
---
6 during collision course at Morgantown, next best was 5 during line in the sand at assylum.
---
They should also make it clearer to what takes how many points of camp budget. Like assign a numerical value to each camp piece, and if in fact levelling up drops a percentage reduction to those pieces, make it clear by how much. They must have the values somewhere so why not just share that with it’s player base
---
I remember what a PIA it was to kill them early on. Then I got my AA and hunter's gatling plasmas. Once primed scorched don't stand a chance.
---
Now I heard it all...
---
Good to know, thx, and what a letdown. Just loved to vaporise creatures with the fatman in FO4.

Even in my bf 1942 days..

Find a quad explosive fastet reload it'll be your best friend but honestly it just not viable for much aside from pve

At least they’re not just selling them outright...

Happening to me as well on PS4. I get the items tho. Not sure about the xp as it doesn't show. Quest text just disappears after finishing.
---
Adamantium Skeleton Perk card will help with the dying
---
I'm in the same boat - I used to lose 90% of fights in NW, but after grinding for the original Haloween rewards, I got to the point where I win 40% of fights, and usually survive until the last couple of rounds. Everything you say here is great, but here's some:
---
ADDITIONAL TIPS FOR THE RUTHLESS COWARD  
---
As mentioned, survival time gets you more XP than anything but a complete victory. So staying alive is job number one.
---
I always spawn somewhere quiet, as alone as possible. I DO NOT JOIN MY TEAM AT SPAWN. If you spawn with your team, you're competing with them for guns and armor. So I try to loot as much as I can for the first few minutes, avoiding other players until I have a full kit I like. THEN I start thinking about my team.
---
If it's a random team, you have no idea how good any of them are. Are they kick-ass? Or cannon-fodder? By the time I've armed up, I should have a good sense of them: If they've been dying like flies, best to stay solo for the rest of the match. If they're all still alive after a few minutes, they probably know what they're doing and I join up. DON'T JOIN YOUR TEAMMATES IF THEY'LL JUST BE A LIABILITY AND GET YOU KILLED.
---
When fights come, and you're solo, don't be afraid to run away. Unless you're being chased by a co-ordinated team, you have a really good chance of escaping. Also, unless you're an expert sniper, don't shoot at other players until they're REALLY close. If they're distant, and they have a good team, all you're doing is giving away your position. They'll revive their buddy and take you out.
---
Finally, CHOOSE WHEN TO REVIVE A TEAMMATE. It's a pretty automatic instinct to run out and save your buddy when they cry out for help, but it can easily get YOU killed too. So I have a mental checklist whenever one of my teammates goes down:
---
1. Is the person who shot them still out there? If no, go heal! If yes, then ask:
---
2. Can I safely take down the dude that got them? If yes, do it, then go heal! If no:
---
3. Can I heal my buddy from cover? If yes, do it! If no:
---
4. Is my buddy an asset or liability? If they're a heavy hitter, take the risk! Even if you die, maybe they can take out the enemy and revive you! But if they're a weak link?
---
5. Let them die.
---
That said, reviving teammates does come with a good XP reward, so if you CAN do it without dying, it's worth it.
---
That's why I still do Census Violence; no luck as yet.
---
I pulled Plasma Grenade from my very first box, before I even knew you could use Chemist to double'em.
---
Sidebar: I need help learning the inner working of the game. I’m level 7 but I don’t want to play and mess up my character. I just need to get on my feet, I can do up to 3 hours of videos to understand. Thanks!
---
What? No bashing damage? Lol
---
That would be cool.  Even better an exchange you can use via the terminals.
---
This kind of video is amazing for advanced fallout guys! I’m going to watch after the football
---
Reading all these negative nancy posts, not gonna lie, seeing these are refreshing.
---
And the best part OP is that you’ll never want for ammo again if you add the flechette rounds mod to it. Ever enemy you kill will have 3-7 harpoons on it and boom. Infinite ammo.
---
PC? Could be cheating, but really the full rifle build is OP
---
I put all ammo at 0 caps in my vendor except, 5.56 at 1cap each. 5.56 is in game currency and doesn't have a limit like caps do
---
I think I'm getting the mr. Fuzzy tokens? I can't really tell what items I get from the quest since it's usually random shit. like I said it's the mr. Fuzzy tokens I'm after and I don't really think I'm getting them.
---
I only run 2 and take almost no damage from SQB sonic attack or exploding Cars/bots, so 3 must make you immune to explosives.
---
It took mine over an hour to show up I didnt relink or anything just figured it wasnt that big a deal if they didnt show up
---
Oblivion was so unoptimized when it came out that it caused my wifes video card to overheat and catch on fire. I daresay that it was the low point of bethesda quality for me, and the horse armor hadn't even been released yet.  
---
Fallout 76 isn't really isn't a drop in quality from my perspective, but no dude, the problems we are seeing have zilch to do with monitization and waaay more to do with a total misunderstanding of the playerbase and a lack of quality control.
---
Yes i got lucky one time and ran into three legendary leaders in snowy jacket among six scorched. But the overall spawn rate is dropped
---
Make sure your twitch account is linked with your Bethesda account. After linking both accounts it worked for me.
---
Yeah, I’ve only just started using the vendors as I haven’t played 76 in a while and I thought the same thing.
---
I thought they may implement an exchange type terminal when I first heard about player vendors when they were announced. 
---
Only problem with that would be if there are any dupers around that managed to offload their things before Bethesda stopped them.
---
I just do bloody melee and never have trouble.
---
Doubtful you got banned. I've had that issue but it always resolved itself eventually. Did you try a restart just in case? 
---
I'm getting [this annoying crash](https://i.imgur.com/rxFYtLM.jpg) a lot more since the latest patch tho. Happen mid game at random parts. Opening my stash.. Buying stuff. Etc
---
I can't go through a 3rd reinstall again..
---
Try formula p with the flechettes.mod it should shoot all the harpoons in a super tight cone lol maybe able to snipe people
---
My main is about 250, my new is about 25👍
---
These are the same hacks as always. Only now, they can use free accounts to get on due to the free weekend. Account gets banned and no loss.
---
Congrats! First one I ever killed.. landed in a tree and I didn’t get to loot it haha.
---
Makes sense really.
---
I am hoping by next Christmas it will be a hub for one of the factions :)
---
I personally don't mind if they wipe my itens that I wouldn't obtained by playing, I buy some cosmetic items that were not supposed to have like those Fasnatch masks...
---
If the wipe would improve the game and get rid of mf cheaters go on...
---
We need a solution, it's been just a P in the ass all cheaters :( 
---
NW it's been just impossible this week...
---
You think if corporate said 'sell a subscription so we can smooth out our income', that the programmers will say screw that and not do it?
---
Patches can fail, they're short handed, and inexperienced.  That has nothing to do with corporate decisions.  Likewise though, if corporate told them to roll back the patch, and the programmers refused, do you really think they'd still be working there on Monday?
---
Was this on pc
---
Yea, im confused tho, are you meaning your new character started at 25 or you got it up to 25 now?
---
Just explore. I don't see a reason you should do all the technical type stuff just trying it out. Roam and kill. I love the weapons part of the game. Plenty of awesome weapons. Games a lot of fun to mess around in. Get creative. It's what's been keeping me playing since launch.
---
That all depends what your in to ;)
---
You should be in your birthday suit in nw. IMO of course.
---
Here are the guidelines I’ve been using and been pretty successful. 
---
General rule of thumb: since I can make my 1400 vendor caps quickly with crafting and selling certain items and selling at Charisma 20 (gets you 25% of item’s base value), anything I sell in my machines I can afford to do so for less than I could get from a vendor. I start at around **20-25% of the item’s base value**, but will adjust up or down depending on the situation. I also try to end my prices in ‘9’ to save both me and my customer a cap worth of tax. 
---
All chems like Mentats, Psychos, Buffouts, Med-X &amp; Fury (including derivatives like Berry Mentats and Bufftats): 9 caps
---
Stimpacks: Diluted 4c, Standard 9c, Super 19c
---
RadAway &amp; Rad-X: Diluted 4c, Standard 9c; RadShield 19c
---
Antibiotics: 9 caps/Disease Cures: 5 caps
---
Bobbleheads: 29-49  caps, depending on the buff/rarity
---
Magazines: 9-19 caps, depending on the buff/rarity
---
Ammo: 1c per. 5mm, 5.56, .50 &amp; .308 seem to sell well. *(I also put up a sign offering bulk deals via direct sales. Example: I’ve sold 2000 rounds of .45 for 1500 caps. Buyer saved 500c, I only ‘lost’ 300c.)*. To be honest, missiles and grenades don’t seem to sell a lot, so often I just dump them. 
---
Plans &amp; Recipes: About 20% of Base Value; less if it’s a common plan (I only charge 1c for workbenches), more if it’s a high demand (I charge 499c for Marine Tactical Helmet plans since they end up being so useful to craft &amp; sell to vendors). 
---
Mutation Serums: 299c, but when overstocked I’ll lower the price. Sometimes I’ll have a themed sale. During Meat Week, all Carnivore Serums are 149c. 
---
Legendaries: Unless it’s a really good one that’s in demand, price it at 25c/scrip value.  Otherwise, start on the high side but be willing to drop price or accept reasonable offers. If it’s a decent one, 40c/scrip value is good. If it’s an amazing piece, 75c/scrip value is a solid basis point, but for certain gear I set very high prices and then look for buyers (on another sub) or let people message me directly. 
---
People tend to want max level armor/weapons, and at least 2 stars as well, so bear that in mind. Even a Bloodied VATS Crit Damage/Fill Lever Action Rifle that’s only level 15 wont go for as much as it would if it was level 45.  (But still should go for a pretty decent amount; people do buy weapons for their alts or friends)

Can i have them?
---
Eh. That’s not what it’s like at all. I heard this too and I wondered where the hell did that nonsense come from. I started playing a few weeks ago and met some of the nicest people on any game I play.
---
U actually need to do the mission for the back pack first through the scout quest line then u can put it on as a skin
---
I like the dark feel of it. I mean that feeling is all over the game but for some reason that feels more empty/dark than others.
---
Maybe it's because I don't go there much but for kill the leader quests.
---
Btw you want Christmas scorched.. hit up the big bend tunnels.. just go all the way through. Other day I got 6. 2 usually now tho.
---
How do you make present
---
They already admitted that and apologized for that, with a useless subscription system. Everyone bought into that apology and never thought they can make SO much money with that so they can afford their vacation for now. They are the one laughing right now lol.  My thoughts to that :x
---
love my double capacity .50 cal for that hehehe just stand and shoot, very zen
---
Tried this last night and did not get any spawns after picking up the ore. Will try again tonight, lol
---
How long does it take for the ores to respawn at Lucky Hole Mine? I got a decent amount of lead and am planning to run through it again.
---
I’ve tried my self through the entire thing and only once it didn’t work, but then again shortly after my game did disconnect
---
you always remember your 1st!
---
I don't know of a specific setting like that, but there are some things that can be changed and scaled and recolored.
---
I'm going to assume you're on PC, since the answer if you're on console is 'probably not'.
---
There's a mod that does some INI changes that you can take a look at, they're explained on the page (in case you don't want to run a mod):
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/464
---
There was also a post way back that I've referred to a number of times that goes over a number of options for the INI files, something in there might help (nothing specific to HUD scale that I remember though):
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wrx8g/how_to_turn_off_depth_of_field_distant_textures/
---
As far as I know, it would be fairly normal for major content to be essentially "done" a couple months before the actual release, and only need bug fixing, optimization, and possibly to finish localization in other languages.
---
You need to buy wrapping paper from one of the robot vendors (it's in the misc tab in the inventory) then take that to a tinkerers workbench to craft it. You also need 1 adhesive.  Equip the chemist perk card in intelligence first so you can craft 2 gifts for every piece of wrapping paper. Larger presents drop the rarer plans but are more expensive to craft. Happy holidays and happy crafting!
---
Aha yeah I’m hiring couple more people tonight.. I’ve also got another business we’re in paying people 2000 caps an hour to grind legendary hunting and usually in 1 hour they come out with 3-5 items that r all worth from 8-15k and the rest they script and then good weapons they give back to me which I sell them all and use the caps to pay them and then keep the profits which then go towards this new Xmas present business
---
I've had so many experiences where I try to gift something good and they run away, fast travel or log out scared.  I picked up a level 1 hunters explosive hunting rifle from a santa scorched earlier and have it on me to give to an appropriate low level of I see one later.  Somehow I have a feeling its going to go like this somehow.  Starting to wonder if it's even worth the trouble anymore lol
---
Probably photoshop
---
I’ve lived behind the pro shop within 100 yards since a year ago and literally just found that fountain last weekend. I had been looking for a large deco style fountain not a water fountain.
---
What lever, perks and/or chems are you using?
---
It was one of the lads in the group. 
---
Join the discord and have a word with him. I'm more melle based
---
Blaming the platform for a shitty developed game. 
---
l m a o
---
This is great, nice work!
---
May end up crafting some myself now.
---
3 in Helvetia
---
It's legit. Took 10 minutes to find the actual source of this, and fortunately, it isn't as simple as loading up a cheat table or a trainer.
---
Won't lie, it's actually impressive how the creator exploited existing game mechanics and wrote custom software to do so.
---
I'm gonna get it at this point. I got the F1 after I decided it wasn't buggy and I could play.
---
Dispensers, crafting (ammosmith perk in, I believe either agility or intelligence, and super duper perk in luck helps with this), corpses (scrounger perk in luck helps with this), events, station vendors, and vendors at camps. There's also an ammunition manufacturing workshop, I forget where, but it seemed to only craft ammo for me once and then no more ammo, so I don't know how lucky you'll get with there. Most other people seem to have no problems with the place, so it's probably just an issue on my end.
---
Completely worth it to me.
---
So you're telling me that you needed Twitch to tell you this game isn't the hot thing going right now? lol.
---
You're completely sidestepping the point I made in the first place, which is: NW is not FO76. Your whole post is hyperbolic and mistakenly presumes that NW having hackers or doing poorly in general means the game will die; and by extension, you imply that fixing NW means the game will not die. Both of these are incorrect.
---
You can play NW and have a blast, you can ask for Bethesda to fix NW. Those are reasonable. But pretending like NW needs to be fixed or else the game will die is laughably short-sighted. NW has never been a big interest for the playerbase and it's had lagging participation for MONTHS. The weekend trial is fine and the few people who don't have positive NW experiences are not going to undermine the overall interest it will generate, because most people (as the majority realize) are not playing a Fallout game for FOTM PVP.
---
They had this is new vegas, so it shouldn't be too difficult to add it to 76. Hell, there's mods out there that add this mechanic to Fallout 4.
---
I usually drop all my low level legendaries to low level players i come across. They would need it more than i do. 
---
I guess mostly patient and happy players are left playing this game. 
---
Ironically, all the grievance done by Bethesda has weeded out most of the toxic players and 'influencers'
---
Hmm had no problem gifting stuff in paper bags. I shoot the bag and they come running over usually.
---
Idk what that means. JFFr? Can?
---
Yeah, I found I was crippling myself a little too often with only the second tier. Actually, I still cripple myself with my double barrel shotgun at times, even with tier three. Usually that sorts itself it though, since it's also got vampire effect. I've never noticed a scratch point blank with the explosive harpoon guns though.
---
what do you mean by cashsink? you mean with the gift wrap for purchase in the vendors?
---
That was it! I didn't realize they had increased their budget. Now I can build again, thanks.
---
Yes exactly! a cash sink is an in game mechanic designed to drain the games currency and take it out the game, in our case caps in the form of gift wraps.
---
lol, that sucks.
---
One thing I want to point out though, not all players want help. While I'm sure a lot of the time they just don't get it/understand how gifting works in this game (most games have a trade window), people like myself don't want a new game to be made easier. We want to work our way up. Taking on a major upgrade from a high level player, or a buttload of stims, etc., can kind of ruin the early game experience by making it seem like a cakewalk.
---
This is part of the reason why I've wanted a hardmode for this game for so long: The multiplayer aspect is somewhat trivialized by how easy it becomes with help from others. The base game isn't really hard in the first place, and anyone looking for a tough challenge and feeling of earned progression will only be turned off by the idea of quick gifts in the early hours of the game. :/
---
If we can get just get a hardmode in 76, there will be much more reason to seek out and appreciate the assistance of others. Plus it would make player trade/vendoring much more important as well.
---
If you don't mind. I'll give you a ton of scrip and some caps if you'd like. Did you get your vault 94 mask yet?
---
I could also drop you some mounted head plans.
---
I'm just gonna say it's 100% worth it, caps are almost a joke with how easy they are to accumulate , I tossed all mine at gift wraps, me n my bud collectively spent about 80-90k openes around 170 large presents, i got all but 4 plans (mounts) and with the the excess plans I've already made a good bit of my caps back selling in my vendor. So definitely worth it imo 👌
---
Are you sure you aren't from the game? Super accurate!
---
It’s possible to spawn a Level 50 chainsaw but not a legendary one, the game just won’t have it.
---
Wanted all the mounted head plans for CAMP building in future, then other rare plans to complete my collection (armour plans and plasma grenade plan.)
---
Plus it gives me that nice Christmassy feeling!
---
Good story, but you cant get a 1* explosive pipe gun
---
It's a bunch of limited time plans for the most part, and caps are always there and easy to come by, not to mention the fact that the plasma grenade plan is in the loot pool for the gifts and that alone (for the folks who are trying to get all the plans) is enough for it to be worthwhile, I've seen people pay 150,000 caps + god roll 3* legendaries just for that plan alone
---
Only 3 Santa scorched?! That sucks! I find a lot of mine around the airport and around fissure sites. I have almost all the animal plans - trying to get the dog head plan 🤞🏻
---
We did 170 and got no plan 😢
---
The game starts with you living within Vault 76. How would you ghoulify? I could see it as a progressive disease, if you keep your rad level very high, eventually you do transform into a ghoul.
---
You can get them from any size gift, not just large, and it's close to the same drop rate for all.
---
"Favorite playlist"
---
Country roads

Country roads...
---
That would make sense if they didnt skip the bug fixing and optimization
---
Yeah exactly if I don’t get a trouble shooters 10mm with bashing DMG and + 1 charisma Fuck that
---
Same I’ve spent almost if not more thank 100k now.. I’ve opened about 120 boxes now! And I still need mothman 😭😭
---
Fashionable Sunglasses complete every look!
---
This stuffs great and all, but its like trying to thread a needle in a haystack sometimes, and trying to get that ultra precision gives me massive anxiety sometimes. No idea why.
---
This chat smells weird
---
"bullets explode for area damage" great that things useless now
---
I can sell cores for 80 caps no problem. Honestly is a fair price considering they last a good while now.
---
Who knows, I think it’s because they realized they didn’t have much content before it’s initial release date and then gave a broad “Q1”window to work on it. Those screenshots recently on ITV gives the sense they just finished those areas and now have something to show. Remember how quiet it was with Wastelanders news leading up to November?
---
I'll take the paranoia further. They're testing out paid loot boxes. "Our holiday gift boxes were so popular that they're now available for purchase in the atom store!".
---
Correct, NW is actually 50% of their game. It has a large player base on consoles and a separate team (Dallas) developing it while Bethesda Austin handles everything else. 
---
Lol... you’re going around in circles for the sake of arguing. I used Twitch as an example to further explain to you why this game is dying but you’re actually missing my point just to argue more. I’m on there everyday I don’t need it to tell me how the game is doing. It’s just fact. And again, you’re the one who is sticking to Nuclear Winter. I’ve explained how this issue exists in both modes but you feel the need to insist that I’m only talking about nuclear winter. 
---
“You can play NW and have a blast.” 
---
Really...? Read my and every other post complaining the last few days. Better yet, start it up on PC yourself before commenting. When the game takes 10 minutes to find a lobby and lasts less than a minute because hackers are wiping the whole lobby in a single command; You can’t have fun in Nuclear Winter because you CAN’T PLAY THE MODE.  Again, I’m talking about NW because you keep going back to it. But no, it’s not possible to “have a blast” right now. 
---
Wait for it to hit steam review the charts yourself which shows concurrent players on their website (steam charts).  There’s 600k followers under 76 on Twitch but 300 viewers right now because everyone’s waiting for changes like the one above (and wastelanders) to start playing. Just because YOU don’t play Nuclear Winter doesn’t mean there isn’t a dedicated player base who does. 
---
I choose to play both modes. But just like my voice doesn’t represent the community in its entirety, neither does the people who don’t play Nuclear Winter because everyone enjoys something different.
---
Need to do the thing with tokens too. I forgot to check my amount before doing the quest to see. But that's cool, patches breaking things instead of fixing them is always cool.
---
I just started a new character, and the second Scorched I killed at Wixon Homestead, the sixth thing I'd killed altogether, dropped a small gift that gave me the plasma grenade plan. So yeah.
---
I don't know if I want to learn it or save it to sell. Can you even make plasma grenades at level 3? It also dropped a super sledge, which is great because I want to go two handed melee with this character, but it's got a minimum level of 30. It's like rai-ai-ain on your wedding day up in here.
---
So small, so weak
---
with how many stars this has... would you even be able to exchange it on the scrip machine? O.o
---
Idk about testing out paid lootboxes, but I could definitely see this as a test for an in game cap/lootbox system..
---
inb4 "bethesda, hire this man"
---
I still have the photo saved from my first kill way back in beta. T51 and a black powder rifle. Talk about time consuming but worth every 10sec reload. I still feel proud when it pops up as a load screen
---
Red ant lager gives you a +50 carry weight for a bit. Well worth making.
---
As much as I hate to come into this thread full of seditionists; at least you get some decent PA paints and stuff. Enclave gets a hat and a jacket. 
---
Totally agree on the faction packs though, I mean.. free states one has been up like three times now ? And not a single atom store pack for BoS/Enclave/Responders yet. Bleh.
---
Turn pacifist mode on? Although people have tried this with me and my mutations have gone off and it hasn’t put me in pvp even tho my pacifist mode is off
---
Do you have a private server? Good spring has all those plans for sell. Also power armor station you might be able to buy it.  But I got mine for free after completing the brotherhood story.
---
I think the actual treasure is going to be some of the weapons like the Plasma Caster they announced for Wastelanders. No way is it actually Gold because what purpose would it have post Great War lol.
---
Thanks r that had my wife to txt that list to me lol
---
you're downvoted but its true
---
There's a quest over in the ash heap called "miner miracles" which gives you the power armor station plans for free!
---
Yep. That's one thing i enjoy about having my camp in the whitesprings!
---
I couldn’t find the handmade plan either. I ran into Grahm, and he had it for about 1600 caps. Bought it and done.
---
More like a fallout 2nd feature -_-
---
haha. dumbass
---
PS when nuclear winter was released, they saw the most traffic across all forms of social media (Twitch, Facebook, Twitter, etc). Fucking Shroud streamed their mode when it came out. To say that there is no interest in a Fallout Battle Royale is extremely disingenuous.
---
It’s got potential but it feels empty right now without human npcs. Wastelanders will change that but it doesn’t come out for a few months.
---
Yeah, i got a private server. I'll have to check there. Thanks for info
---
oh no..... i just came back to fo76 and got one of those and used it.....if only i knew...
---
Ok cool, I'll check there when i get on next. Thanks
---
Handmade plan is for sale at harpers ferry usually
---
Another request for the discord link?
---
uninstall
---
I live in a three layered shack near the Whitespring (already existing) and I just needed one connector attached to the roof and its all wired up. I swear it works better than in Fallout 4
---
actually blizzard had some trouble with aimbots
---
Is there a map of Grahms travels? I saw him once since i started playing again. Lol
---
Oh nice, thanks
---
dang! way ahead of me lol.
---
Yuck... That blows
---
I named my character Frank Castle...
---
Well with this event sure the price has plummeted drastically but if u get another, save it for after the event is over and if you wait a bit the price should rise again at least a bit. The  days of the 150,000k and god roll trades for the plan are over but hey I have 1800 hours and you have one of the last plans that even I dont have!! So you got that going for ya
---
Same boat, but from cap hoarding myself. Dropped 80K on medium gifts and opening them on a level 16 toon to game the loot table a bit.
---
No clue wtf I'm going to do with 8 plasma grenade plans now.
---
Your tinfoil hat is brooken, haha. But seriously you can easily get 150000 Caps in just 3 weeks.
---
Hey there, I'm Mike and this is Frank. We noticed your signs, and wondered if you were selling any of the stuff on this list...
---
Yea, the rng God's fucked me , hard, with no lube and didn't even call me back........
---
The average player certainly can’t..
---
Handmade plans can be bought from the Free States or Shopping Mall vendor in Whitesprings. Lever plans from Responder vendor in Whitespring (if he hasn't got it then the Grafton vendors sell it too). 
---
Combat rifle I am sure you get that from the quest at the Hornwright hq in Charelston? Or check the Whitesprings vendors.
---
Plasma would be the Brothrhood vendor (again Whitesprings for ease) I think, plus enclave armoury but you need to be general to get in there.
---
As to power armour stations you can buy them from enclave armoury but you can get a free set as a reward for the miner miracles quest in the ash heap.
---
I do but I meant the actual using resources to craft fermentable beer ect
---
Yeah that would work as well
---
I'd buy it right now on Xbox.😂😂 A 10 star legendary. Just make it Bethesda, it's what I need on my bloodied Fatman to make it not tickle the queen.
---
Do you only get the grenade plans from the medium ones? I have only bought the large ones and I’m yet to eat the grenade plan!
---
It really depends on what kind of build that you want to make.
---
Ah that makes more sense... I haven't been to biv since I did the quest
---
knowing bethesda its either gonna be completely useless or gonna ban everyone
---
Alright im doing a rifles/pistols cowboy build, using vats too btw so id like to focus on firing faster and putting out more damage
---
Is this a one time use crafting Mat or can I use it over and over?
---
or you can buy it from Phoenix in Watoga for $1K for the PA Station .. the quest can be challenging without friends, but not impossible. Fiends can make the station for you as well.
---
I second this, I've also never gotten another one after learning the recipe from him.
---
Ohhh that would've been an amazing reward
---
It's stupid it's a 1% chance. I like that it's free, but this is suppose to be the Christmas spirit. Up those chances after all the shit we have gone through!
---
Better chance of plans from the medium handmade. Even better if you open them on a level two if you're trying to get the plasma grenade plans since it will remove any item with a minimum level of 5 from being in the loot table at that time.
---

Damn thanks for this information!
---
Atoms make it worth it, so yes .. you can do without it, but more convenient and the missions are very easy to unlock the stations
---
Dang, PC, thank you anyway though
---
Ah, thank you so much! I couldn’t quite tell which region because of the filter I put on the photo.

Edit: This is the witch’s coven unmarked location! Thanks so much for your help - without your comment, I wouldn’t have been able to find it.  :)

I’d say BOS Combat armour or marine armour. Idk how to get the plans for bid but for marine you need to do alot of grinding at Watoga station and the vendor at Harper’s ferry

....pacifist mode

Here. This link isn’t supposed to expire.

Thanks a lot! I'll check all those places for sure
---
I've had this happens a lot too. All weekend I've been building Brotherhood Recon Rifles and handing them out along with Stimpaks, ammo, and any low level legendaries I've accumulated. Some are grateful, but some just keep running like morons. I'm showing the gift emoji, shooting toward the box, and they're clueless.
---
Where did you find the glasses? Also amazing job!
---
You could try to do a bloody commando build would be good. Get an unyielding set of armor
---
Is there a good fo76 discord where i can freshen up on current information known by the playerbase? All the new tips and tricks and what not
---
What *is* your point, anyway?
---
Let's look at the title of this thread: 'Here's why the free weekends are killing this game'. Ok so that's your position. And sure, free weekends may be a bad idea overall, or simply not working well with NW. But when you create a hyperbolic rant post all you're doing is making yourself look bad by focusing so hard on one petty thing. 
---
That's why you have such a low upvote count. Because you're being incredibly narrow with your scope and exaggerated with the consequences of that scope.
---
Or maybe you're right. Maybe the free weekend messing up NW is killing the game, and the bad code, understaffed departments, lack of communication, lack of QA, atom shop, subscription model, terrible launch, poor critical reception, bad social media vibes, and general lack of stability are mere afterthoughts. 
---
We absolutely need to stop these free weekends before they kill our game! xD 
---
Once you understand that, maybe you'll understand why I criticized your post in the first place.
---
This coming from someone who chose to have vomit in their username.
---
Im guessing you're one of the wonderful wastes of oxygen and food that I'm referring to.
---
Good luck in life, I hope you have a permanent ban from the gene pool for the sake of humanity.
---
If I come across another one, I'll definitely let you know.
---
Idk about discord really, but what system are you on? Ps4 by chance?
---
PC
---
I'll try this again, before pretty sure this happened with it on and it just kept me from being able to fight back even more.
---
It was originally going to end on December 26th, but it was extended. I forget the exact date but I think it now ends on December 30th.
---
You PC? I want the mothman but given those odds I am worried.
---
Like the ones in most schools. Inside lower wall, south side.
---
It's what, day 3?  I've already got most of the plans that I want (I'm sure there are 100's that I don't have, but don't care about).  This goes on until the end of the year, so if there's much you really want, you don't really need to spend caps at all (unless you don't play much, and I don't think BGS is targeting them).
---
I'd say there's a bigger reason to have an atom sink than anything.  They would put things out there that are desirable before something specific (like Xmas decorations), so that you spend your atoms then need a lot more urgently, which will cost you real $.
---
Another poster said it's easy to get 150K caps, and that's a bit exaggerated, but not a lot.  I typically go through about 75K caps on a weekend, though *this* weekend seems pretty darned slow.  I'm just a solo player who understands a bit what people want, and that's all it takes (and a bit of luck) to make a ton of caps.
---
If you're a ranged player. Ballistic Bock gives like 15% extra ballistic damage and high voltage hefe for 15% energy damage. Pretty badass.
---
Also, if you are someone who likes to complete Daily/weekly challenges, they often have something like brew 3 lead champagne while wearing formal wear or brew/drink 15-20 different types of alcohol for a weekly challenge, so it's important to know them for that.
---
Sell extras (they're 1 cap each), you can only do 1 turnin and then you have to find a new one before the quest will work again.
---
Mine seem to multiply in my inventory, I just periodically sell the extras.  You can't chain turnins in any way that I've ever heard about.
---
My understanding is they’re already spent ones that just pile up from being used. Or if you bought any from a vendor when they were bugged they are worthless. Just dump them because you can only use one at a time for forbidden knowledge and once used for it they stay in your inventory.
---
Haha beautiful.
---
Nothing is excusable after a year.  The issue is that there are 8942384 things that need fixing, so they have to prioritize.  They don't have the manpower to fix everything in a timely fashion, unfortunately.
---
Damn, this quest is really bugged
---
I apologize then I thought that was still bugged where they weren’t removed.
---
PS4. The event is now running till 31st so there's still time though!
---
Yeah, those were my 3 favorite. Plague walker allowed me to eat spoiled meat and drink toxic water to my hearts content, only increasing my aura more as I went.
---
But alas my "toxic avenger" build is going to be going adios :(
---
Hard to say, might be intentional on some level, but hard to say.  The duplication thing certainly is a bug though.
---
That’s awesome to get a definite answer! Thank you
---
I didn't say there's no interest in a Fallout BR. What I wrote is that it was never a big interest for the playerbase (also known as the people currently playing), and that most people are not playing a Fallout game for FOTM PVP. Which is true. Whatever the number of NW players, they are not comparable to the number of Adventure Mode players, as is evidenced in part by 3 named hackers ruining your games. If NW had a community of even hundreds of players you would not be seeing these same dudes repeatedly pooping on every match, nor would you have to go out of your way to avoid them.
---
NW is a niche, accept it or not. It's not 50% of the game, it's an off mode for people who like PVP now that survival mode is gone. It doesn't have 50% of the players or 50% of the support or 50% of the development time. It has a small portion of each of those. 
---
If the base game was better coded and much, much more polished, the BR mode ~could~ have taken off. It was received fairly well on this reddit. But that's not the case and most people are not interested in playing a janky copycat PVP mode for an IP like Fallout. 
---
Now your doomsaying claims about the free weekend and NW have been funny to read, but I'm not gonna waste anymore time on ya. :P
---
I have to post pictures of mine. It's ran on walls and ceilings, so they're not hidden but they do decently approximate EMT in a commercial setting.
---
Yikes... Read the TLDR and move on with your life, pal. My point was pretty clear. A new player who tries out the game in its current state is not likely to purchase the title after playing. Otherwise you would see an increase in interest on Fallout 76 across the board (Twitch charts, social media discussion, etc) after the free weekends end. There are actual stats that you can look at and it’s not that I don’t have a point, it’s that you’re failing to see it. Many of the people writing these posts on Reddit are new players complaining. You seriously think they’re gonna buy the game after writing a whole post to say how broken it is? Free weekends are killing the chances of them branching out to a larger audience. It’s a multi-faceted problem that you can’t wrap your mole rat sized brain around. You’re all over the place lol. Have a good day.
---
Lmao!! I literally just scrapped a freakin Mutant Slayers shovel!
---
10-Star Legendaries :  Coming Soon to the Atom Shop for Fallout 1st Members
---
THATS NOT TRUE THOUGH LOL!!! There was a massive interest and a massive increase in what I just described BOTH after the announcement and the release of Nuclear Winter. FACT. There’s less people playing because of everything I’ve been mentioning (which you claimed is failing to reach my point). You’re essentially taking your OPINION and making it that of the entire Fallout community. Disingenuous or just plain ignorant? I don’t know.
---
This might explain the plethora of players I saw at Vault  76 yesterday.
---
Acid from tangara town cave crickets, lead ore from lucky hole mine, steel from Morgantown scorched.
---
Make sure you have excavator armor when you hit up lucky hole (it doubles the ore). Have scrapper on when you break down weapons. (Get them from Morgantown Scorched since you can easily melee them and get roughly the same amount of steel and use the train station to scrap and store.) And ammosmith for obvious reasons.
---
Don’t bother with weights or junk (unless it’s for acid), which is what most are suggesting. You simply don’t get enough. Lucky hole can give you 500 lead in one go, so any players not using that aren’t using very much lead to begin with. Ditto to people saying “you’ll never run out of steel”. They obviously haven’t tried making 10k 5.56 rounds before. You easily use 1000+ steel, so you can’t rely on passively collecting it from junk.
---
Acid extractors are fine as a supplement, but don’t bother with lead or steel extractors. It’s a waste of time. You’d have to wait days of constant playing for the amount of scrap you could get in an hour.
---
Only available for those using a quantum processor
---
Raiders gotta raid. I never carry junk in workshops, events, and player camps. There is always a trick to get your loot.
---
Now you know! Seek revenge!!
---
At this point our only hope is if the hacking increase, talking down the servers.
---
Then, even people that is not part of this S2 salty sub S2 will rise their voice.
---
That video was instigating with what black powder blunderbuss or rifle? I have an instigating the dragon &gt;;D
---
Do BP weapons fall into their respective weapon categories? Ie: BP rifle = all rifle perks
---
BP blunderbuss shotgun perks?
---
Thanks !!
---
Worked for me! Thank you!
---
This is one thing I've never tried is building in an existing structure.
---
But I’m not here to talk about atoms or atomic shop.. im talking simply about how rn there is a cap sink and a needed one! So an atomic sink is kinda irrelevant to anything.. 
---
150k or even 75k is easy for us redditors here to make yes.. but what people seem to miss understand is this small reddit community of hard core hard ass traders is about 5% at most of the the games community and that’s being generous.. we are a wry small subpar of the community, this directly targets us but also targets the average player just as much, my friend who has about half the time in game as I do (I have 800hours) he is defiantly the more casual and average gamer in this game, and them players aren’t out there even earning there 1400 caps every day from a vendor.. so for them to get 75-150k it sounds absurd to them, my friend has consumed 6-7 hours of this event and in that time I had most the plans.. he has 4 (And Santa cause I gave him it) and has spent all of his caps.. if he wants all the plans or most.. this update will effect his personal economy a lot longer than it will effect ours. so this update does directly effect all players.. taking average players hard earned caps alongside us traders hordes of it.. there’s gotta be a reason for it🤷‍♂️
---
Edit: sorry fixed up some spelling typos at the end
---
Hunter’s long coat w/ Mr. Fuzzy head.
---
You can basically buy the gifts or caps.. you buy the paper and then craft the gift at a Tinkers bench.. using chemist gives you double.. idk if super duper works
---
Cowboy build you’d want lever actions and western revolvers. For your armor type if you really want to role play cowboy probably leather armor. The legendary prefix effect would vary on if you want to use bloodied weapons or a different type
---
It is photoshoped,  just take a zoom... xD
---
I disagree. The amount of capital far exceeds the ability to centralize it. 
---
While this theory is applicable in public markets, the decentralization of the fallout economy allows for a lot more free market mechanics.
---
lol, yeah :)
---
😂🤣
---
Well the way the current game is set up - there is no slap damage so players should be unable to damage you unless you fight back with the exception of a exploit with certain mines having radiation damage.
---
If you just wanna give me some scrip to cover what i used to craft it that's fine with me. GT is Jinjostar i can give it today if youre available
---
I’ve found when the event ends and there are less people shooting and running around that the game seems to catch up and you can revive ,.. it’s annoying none the less to sit and watch others have all the fun but you can at least loot the Queen with a little patience
---
I've been reporting this problem for weeks. No it's not because I didn't do enough damage. I did. I got rewards from the event. I didn't get rewards off the queen. Happens the opposite way as well..I have not gotten rewards for the event but could loot the queen. This happens all the time...and again, I am doing more than enough damage..so fuck anyone saying it's just a matter of damage.
---
Can you please explain a little more, what it is you mean with your second sentence? :)
---
Give us more storage for pete’s sake. How long do we have to ask. I try to come back and play new content, but it’s too frustrating to be always overloaded. And NO. I’m never paying you more for the privilege of ingame storage.
---
Completely agree they don't have the man power but darn it stings, only good part is when it happen the rewards given through quest that are auto deposited onto your character are still given. Really hope when they make public event not require to tag legendaries they give the rewards via quest completion so I won't have to worry about this glitch or having to find their bodies.
---
So your telling me there is a chance....... I'll get nothing.  nice!
---
Hmm waited 5mins last time but guess maybe I need to wait longer. Will give it a try and cross my fingers.
---
Praise Todd!
---
I know for a fact they use to be the strongest guns but they got merged to the point they are mostly useless compared to other weapons. I wish they got a buff tho too
---
Yes ik, i already have my guns i asked about armor bro , specifically what armor would go with a keversction and .44
---
sure thing. my GT is snipples3
---
I assumed that’s how it works, I needed it for arms so that’s what I made. I even tried the heavier variants with no luck.
---
It’d be viewed as a new meta and people will cry for a nerf even though PA is in need of love. I could see it adding buffs to ap RR PR or like you said a slight buff to weapon accuracy like last bastion. Nothing absurd but to add a balance to PA users not wanting to grind for the strangler PA.
---
Bloody hell. They need to patch that bug realy quick before 32* legendary laser muskets start to pop everywhere.
---
Theres a wendigo below me, i can hear it, i know i can take it on easily, but its still extremely horrifying
---
Depends on if ur bloodied. If you are go either bolstering or unyielding. If you like ur health go vanguards. If you never want to die go full lifesaving. I’m building a full set of weightless for my cowboy character. Weightless armor and instigating explosive and instigating faster fire rate lever actions plus anti armor explosive western revolver. Save a mr fuzzy, ride a wastelander bro
---
Lol i just use the max armor pen one only 12 rounds but hey 33% AA is better then a few more rounds
---
Ah well if you were on the 4 I'd say tag along with me n my pals☹️ but if you have any questions feel free to message me anytime and I'll give u the best answer ingot lol!
---
Yay! No more disease cures for me!
---
Wendigos are people to man goshhh!!
---
Ive been dumping them 2-3 at a time whenever I see one.
---
Advertising. It's not hard to see this is already going on. Every worked in a store that needed good reviews and your boss had you filling them out or taking the surveys? Happens all the fucking time. People giving their glowing "opinions" on a product. LOL. Tin Foil hat everything that makes you feel stupid eh? The internet has no rules or ethics, fool.
---
Not doing bloodied, you can't make me
---
What in terms of base stats no effects is the best armor though ?
---
Pistol builds are so agility centered I would have a real hard time putting 5 in adrenaline, there are just too many good agility perks for a pistoleer.  I would move to Unyielding armor as you can preferably with AP refresh, would reduce need for action boy.  I would pass on evasive you can get decent DR from quality armor, better to use that point in agility on killing things, as a Bloodied build you can use points in int and luck to help mitigate damage, or dodgy if you have agility points left over.
---
Bloody Mess is a flat 15% damage boost to all weapons!
---
Radio antennae would be cool! I’m talking about just a radio station on your Pip Boy just for the individual player. It would look for input from a streaming service and then play thru the Pip Boy, so it still sounds old-timey and you don’t have to adjust an external volume. It just matches the volume of whatever you have your Pip Boy set to. I’ve been using Spotify lately and the audio quality is too high, plus it’s hard to get the volume right
---
In pvp? Yes and no 1 shot from a shotty is 8 hits so if you're close enough to someone in shitty enough armor you could "one shot" someone but only cuase its really 8 shots
---
Coal and fertilizer seems to be his favorits /:
---
I have spoken to youtubers that have gotten all kinds of perks from bashing a competing companies games. Ever been at work at the boss asked you to fill out a survey saying something nice about the place?
---
Best overall Br/Er I want to say is Combat but best Br is scout armor
---
Probably a combination of wanting a break over the holidays, and wanting to make damn sure this update works perfectly (or as close to it as they can).
---
Did not know this but then again I haven't explored much of Whitesprings. The place gives me the creeps but that could be just old memories of my newb days...
---
And the strangler PA looks so bad
---
Why not both?
---
I agree with these prices as a baseline, some things I sell for slightly more or less, but they move easily in this range leading to steady cap flow.
---
A few times I have sold so much stuff I had nothing left to sell really but scraps. Gives me space to loot out another area.
---
I remember when I found out about this a few months ago. I've been so thankful for it because I live on the golf course and the frequent attacks make me get diseases often.
---
Wait what’s the glitch?
---
I had no idea that was even a thing
---
I don’t plan on using vats so the agility isn’t as needed, why I didn’t include action boy either. I was debating about just 1 point of adrenaline.
---
I need to buy or find the plans for the conduit
---
Yeah like crazy lol so many level 1 legendary weapons.
---
Strangler pa looks like battlefield 2 Wookiee suit
---
Or when you jump before they swing but they still kill you
---
I believe it's once every 20 hours or so, just like for other stuff you'd loot out in the wild. I'm not 100% positive, though.
---
Strangler PA looks like Bethesda artist on drugs.
---
"What legendaries does it have?"
---
Yes
---
Oh it will need balancing out of course but, like for my heavy weapons power armor build guy id like armor as a goal too you know?
---
Thank you , and for mods the Brotherhood mod is the best right ?
---
Actually i tested it after asking, atleast for me every ore was respawned after like 35 minutes when i first cleared it. I think i switched servers tho, not sure. But definitely not 20 hours in this case.
---
I play mostly public and have never had that happen.
---
6 at fissure prime
---
Probably scared it's some kind of trick. Read some bad reviews from earlier in the game about people being dickish and they're just playing it safe
---
I agree with the guy above flip the mic on speak up
---
Looks legit to me
---
I did not know this! Thanks, glad I read this when I did... only bought/used 3 pieces of wrapping paper so far.
---
Thank you :**)
---
Just had 7 spawn earlier during the "Line in the Sand" event (7 total throughout the 3 waves).  Big Bend Tunnel has been really good for me too.
---
I'm on PC. Happens all the time to me. Using any consumable at all will do it.
---
Honestly one of the best suggestions I’ve seen for While. 
---
Solves two of the most annoying problems for me: 
---
Dead servers where nobody gets involved with events 
---
AND
---
If I can only play one long stint a week I can still only earn 1400 caps. 
---
I have like, a job and stuff, unfortunately 😅
---
What about the limb damage tho?!!?
---
Thank you bb :*****)
---
She's not lying. It's happen to me 3 times now. Got Dross toss, did the event, then it just disappears from the quest list with no rewards.
---
I don't shoot at the bag cuz this sometimes confuses them &amp; they think I want PvP or etc.
---
I gift emote and then squat-stand-squat-stand while changing outfits. 
---
They often have no idea wtf I'm doing but walk closer to try to figure it out and then run into the bag.
---
I usually drop things in the overseers camp chest
---
Had 7 spawn during the Line in the Sand event.
---
Yea it’d be nice to have that goal considering most good roll armor is leaps and bounds better than PA other than the rad resistance. I’d like to see more enclave love as far as PA paint goes. Say the had something similar to the outcast or just  a rogue band that has different values that didn’t align with that of the enclave. I know most purists won’t agree but it’d be nice.
---
I’m flattered :)
---
Also - love how the person who has it spend Atoms on the black paint xD
---
Come on buddy...you don’t roll cake batter out
---
Looks like you're the one trolling mate. Just because someone is having an issue with the game that's not happening to you doesn't mean its not happening and their lying about it. Don't be so critical of others just for voicing issues their having.
---
That’s okay I know it’s not for everyone. If you wanna do high health build you could try to get a vanguard set but your not going to get the high level of damage a bloody build offers
---
I don't remember if the combat armor mods are specific to heavy/turdy/light or work on them all.
---
Wait i might have missed the hint,are they trashing nuclear winter?
---
Im so glad they didnt nerf the value of straight jackets at fort defiance, ez money right there. Any other good ways for cap gain come out yet?
---
"Select someone from this sub reddit to run this company " 
---
Make that the country.
---
I dont need to one-shot eveything , I had another build what was heavy gunner and to be frank it was shit but i still was unstoppable monster , it gets boring tbh , so i decided pistols would be fun
---
My main issue with them is that I need that glowing costume and I'm so sick of this stupid game, I've played for like 12 hours just to get it, and I'm not there yet.
---
Put them on an alternate character, so you don’t lose them.   That way, you can repeat the quest by just giving yourself one at a time
---
No but I just continue to take on a padawan learner as opportunity allows.
---
I second this.
---
This bug wasn’t in the game a year ago...
---
Click auto set and turn off basically all programs, that's what I do. Turning off grass makes minimal improvement
---
If you don't turn in before you log out it duplicate next time you log in.
---
Wanting the plasma grenade plan isn't just about trying to get all plans, there's the Possum badge that requires you to craft some plasma grenades.
---
Don't drop them because if no players are nearby it will delete them. Place them at Overseers camp in the boxes.
---
Shoot someone with a karma syringe and then set off a nuka mine by them. Its kinda funny
---
5 is nice, but if you aren't getting enough kills fast enough putting 4 in other perks is better, I mostly run 1, except SQB fights where I can kill a bunch of ads quick to ramp damage, and my sneak perks are worthless.
---
As stated, do miner miracles to get the PA station plan.  
---
Lever Action Plan can be hard to find.
---
Combat rifles themselves are around.  
---
I had stumbled acrosS several before I made L50 - and used one to take out what needs to be done to complete miner miracles, then later used it to take down my first (several) SBs.
---
It’s is awesome I love it
---
Nah ive got a bloodied faster fire rate combat shotty with 250 dr that I forgot about because ive been useing my bloodied faster fire rate handmade and can't kill players anymore due to quantum spams
---
He was only banned after getting level 100, and he's back on a second acc
---
Yep! I’ve been chasing the newbies and giving them all the neat low level stuff I’ve been picking up :)
---
Yup.  Kind of annoyed that heavy weapons armor pen is tied to power armor which is supposed to be a huge defensive boost.  Then I look at unyielding sentinel heavy armor builds and sad face.
---
I played until about 1am PST and he was still going
---
Before DR and ER. Then you factor those
---
Nukashine is great if you are overencumbered :)
---
Ah ok that helps clear things up. Thank you
---
Imagine its price with enchager — 300 scrip. With 150 max :D
---
These are the same artists who lovingly detailed the SBQ’s anus while using Fallout 4 textures for everything else.
---
Yeah his second account just killed me
---
If you have the frog and snallygaster plan? I just need those 2 to complete my collection.
---
That tool is called photoshop
---
Freddies house of feaR  is a Halloween store, and the pumpkin house is another Halloween-centric location.  Both are in the NE of the map.
---
If there were no other variables like armor rating, range of the attack, sneak attacks, concentrated fire, gun fu, etc then yes. It rarely seems to work that way though.
---
Where I'm at, they do. Not very often, but they do.
---
We have an explosive pump action that seems be underperforming
---
Example, a death claw has very high ER and takes 0 radiation damage. Decent DR as well. If a sword says 10 damage and he has 3DR then after calculating it would be 7 damage (Not the actual math but same concept and how it works.)
---
Explosive was nerfed
---
I hate to be a beggar, but I’m waiting on my new Xbox (original finally died on me). If nobody else wants them, I’d love to have them. I’m hoping I’ll have the Xbox by Friday. If not, it’s all good ☺️.
---
This is the free play weekend. Perfect time to test it out before spending a dime.
---
No problem 😉 happy holidays lol x
---
I know that but it still seems to be underperforming against low levels
---
You could try it for free right now, not sure when it ends
---
Shit isnt that the syringer you have only for roses quest?
---
This ship has been sinking but this is a new low
---
Oh really? That’s great! Unfortunately, my internet at home is really bad and the download probably wouldn’t be done by the end of the weekend. Thanks for the heads up though!
---
Yes - get it.  Definitely worth it ( especially this time of year ) -  has a lot of content.
---
Factor in bullet spread. What unit are you against? What's the bullet count on the gun?
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
I believe that you will still have to find the bodies, but you should be automatically included in the loot list, so you don't have to tag the mob to loot it.  (There will be some other requirements for that, so you can't hide in a corner necessarily and still get loot).
---
They did say that the corpses don't disappear any more, so finding them shouldn't be a huge deal, but I don't believe that that works 100% of the time right now, so time will tell.
---
I just search for the lowest levels on the map and drop stuff off in front of them.
---
Yea I’m still kinda sad Marine armor is neutered to hell and back. We will never be as good as the bloodied but we should be damn close. I know some perks don’t proxy with the PA bloodies so they’re loosing that much more to not have an unyielding sent set with weight reductions.
---
Why lie?
---
Many good ways but really , go to Uranium Fever Everytime it pops , pick up every weapon off the mole miners then take em across the street to whitesprings and sell, sell, sell.
---
You're in general just better off dipping out of the match and getting a new lobby
---
That to, I wasn't saying that's the only reason ,just giving a reason to as of why it's wanted so badly
---
Nope. There's a new glitch that allows players to spawn any entity from FO4 - someone already did it with the Prydwen.
---
CS doesn't fix anything in the game either.  They don't talk to the devs, and they aren't even techie enough to communicate issues they are presented with if they did.
---
Who hasn't been hit by a ghoul while making a marsupial jump 20 feet in the air above them. Definitely a long running problem.
---
Shotguns have an effective range of about 1 foot :P  The damage drop off is severe with those.  There are some mods and perks you can get to alleviate that, but they not really effective at all much past melee range without work.
---
We vs. Scorch and super mutants and did 11 damage to both. Seems like DR would be higher for super mutants
---
Until there aren't enough people to fill a match and you just get onto the next game with the same hacker
---
Right?!  I crafted it and it looks great.  Hope they don't remove it when they bring the "sequin dress" back!
---
I have speed demon, marsupial, and scaly skin
---
Wonder how long it'll take to ban that one
---
We have a long barrel and skeet shooter on
---
It’s definitely not for everyone. I have a love/hate relationship with the game. Even with this  added event its hard for me to put in more than an hour plus each time I play.
---
Another factor happens with certain weapons. With crossbows enemies outside the range listed will have diminished damage. 
---
At least that is what I have noticed.
---
I was able to craft it at a bench yesterday.  Give it a try?  Looks like you can craft it if you had the "sequin dress".
---
In past versions they've just had low defenses and high hp and attack but slow. Scorched are low hp low defenses high speed and numerous + ranged. Makes senss
---
Thanks for this list. Now that I know how few of the drops on that list are at all interesting, I’ll be saving a lot of caps.
---
Done in three times now, there and also at the Red Rocket in Morgantown (though mostly above it rather than in it) and the Wilson Bros garage (with a rooftop bar area)
---
Thought this was honest, but then got to the part  ”having great time with Atom Shop”. Sorry, but no.
---
You can hit it twice or more if you just server hop, ive done it a few times and gave away the lead
---
The game as good as long as you're avoiding nuclear winter on PC right now. I do enjoy the adventure mode.
---
It is on a cliff to the west of camp venture. I’ve got my camp directly next to that spot lol. If you walk west and a tiny bit north from venture you’ll find a cliff face. Follow the cliff face to the north and you’ll be able to climb up top and then just walk along the edge you’ll find your spot
---
That juicehead dude never stops talking to draw breath. It's interesting what he talks about but can't stand the constant talking.
---
It is a smaller capacity backpack for low level players no reason not to learn it if you already have the regular one from the tadpole quest, but you will never use it.  Since it can't be transferred it is worthless
---
Sadly ive also seen a few 5 star armors in a players vendor for 25k caps..
---
Im pretty sure you get the recepie after the quest
---
As far as I can see it's a pretty good reason to play the game on anything but PC.
---
Well shit. What was the point of that plan I guess.
---

---
Here, can’t say these are Photoshop. Not shown are the legendary modules that got spawned in, as well as the plans for Strangler armor, Solar armor, and a Vault 94 Scout Mask
---
I still have mine on my other character. I wound up with it from an epic battle with a Legendary Sheepsquatch and put it up on a display for laughs.
---
It adds 5% damage per card up to 15%. Also sometimes causes the target to explode. Its a good card for any build because it's not limited by weapon type.
---
Shhhh…
---
In my experience the little yellow notifications in the upper left corner are a good measure that your connection to the game is re syncing
---
If you're on PS4, I can help out sometime when I'm online. PSN: MoonlightCowboy
---
My new character is about 27 and found plan early on and learned it, this gave me the small basic (non Possum badge modifiable)  backpack with I think +10 carry weight or something. Will use this mostly for a nice cosmetic until I get the Tadpole backpack and then the Possum which I have on my main with the Atom Store Black skin.
---
And I got mine on the first one I made Thursday afternoon.
---
Yeah, things are getting out of hand.
---
Oh I saw it in a datamine - I think it’s for New Years
---
Not that I’m aware of. I just hit level 80, and I think that was the second time I saw him. The first was very early in the game and I’m pretty sure I shot at him first.
---
If you don’t care about legendary effects, are you just wanting the best damage resistance or do you mean you want our opinion on the aesthetics?
---
To be honest, since I’m never *not* wearing an outfit, I don’t care about the visual aesthetics of the armor itself. I’ve worn pieces that look horribly mismatched but for my ‘look’ I went with the Elder’s Battlecoat, a Black Cowboy Hat and Welding Goggles/Skull Bandana. 
---
Heavy Combat Armor w/ your choice of mods is a good setup. Dense for the chest, for example.
---
Free, yes. 
---
For real money, no.
---
Really? I just checked and I can’t make a karma barrel
---
Lol that just popped when i went there for a rose quest, not even a minute later, half the server teleported there
---
I've got an xbox, and I can pay/trade
---
I wonder why it’s unlearned tho
---
Handmade plans sometimes at watoga robot vendors.
---
You can continue to make better ones every 10 levels 10,20.ect to 50 gaining 5lbs per upgrade.
---
The point is for new players who haven’t done the tadpole yet so they can get some extra carry weight.
---
Check this out.

Yeah, i can't watch his videos. He's too annoying
---
Lol, thanks for the laughs
---
Thanks for this.
---
You may need to go play another game, I'd never keep doing something that doesn't bring joy and fun...
---
Life's too short 😎
---
I don't know if it always was, but would not surprise me, kind of like 90wr on guns only effecting base, not mods.
---
That owner's name though
---
Awesome. Guess I'll be busy running around the next few days. Lol
---
Me too, ugly to be honest as are many of these costumes, but that's just me, I'm just rocking a basic surveyor's outfit and in first person never see it anyway.
---
I imagine this would go over well. :facepalm
---
Your rule about shotguns needs an adjustment - combat shotguns are awesome!
---
No it should be called Highroller which includes a Pipboy 3 billion skin
---
Exactly, most players are not going to run the tadpole quests until mid level.  You can get this as soon as you can clear the airport.
---
Friends and family can just bring food and drink to your game station area and take away the soda bottles of wee and bags of number 2's to help you stay on a role of double xp and presents 😆
---
Gaming first, life is in the back seat.
---
The 11 damage you're seeing is just the aoe damage. You may not be close enough to do actual bullet damage with the shotgun.
---
I know but its slow going with the caps limit. Cant buy any of the wrapping paper
---
PC.
---
I actually don't understand why people need to actively collect food.
---
I have speed demon and I never ran out of food despite not actively searching.
---
I think the worst thing he does os talk about how much he loves the game, and then proceeds to shit all over it
---
Legendary items should be bind on player.
---
Did you click on it to learn it?  I have only grabbed it with new characters, never with one who already knew the tadpole plans.
---
At what point can we have a hacking Olympics?  I honestly kinda want to see what they can come up with at this point.  
---
A bear arm that shoots Prydwens?
---
A Gary Gun?
---
Giddy Up Buttercup Horses?
---
The entirety of Skyrim playable after waking up from Nukashine?
---
People keep saying this, but dragons weigh 7.8 and a weightless one is 2.4
---
That was brought in by a scumbag hacker/duper/loser. The Prydwyn has also been spotted. They are trying to destroy the game by using throwaway free accounts this weekend.
---
If you see them, it’s best not to interact with them.
---
No it’s still showing unlearned. Can’t transfer it to my other characters either
---
Holy SHIT
---
Just another 9 f***ing levels...
---
So why would I get it at level 200 with multiple backpacks. Just confuses me
---
Been that way as long as I can remember.
---
War drum is so impressive! Great detail.
---
Or raise the level cap on weapons and armor from 45/50 to 55/60
---
Anyone who opens overseers cache at Morgantown airport gets it. I am confused why you are confused. It was added  a couple months after pioneer scouts.
---
Ah, a fellow man of reason I see.
---
Lol you are lazy, but not enough to ensure you get heard by everyone about your....well laziness.;) At least I got your attention hehe
---
I’m confused because it’s an unlearned plan on my character even tho he can craft multiple backpacks
---
Is the XP still gainjng because i noticed i didnt get anything on screen but was only really doing it cor the XP
---
Don't forget unlimited access to the /killall, /god, and /noclip commands! Or are those locked to Fallout 3rd?
---
You wrote a novel on Reddit. I can only be on the toilet for so long before I need to get up and leave.
---
Thanks for the input commander of all pioneer scouts.
---
Well, that's before you factor in things like damage reduction and armor.
---
Yeah coming from the job like grind that was wow - 76 is a nice change of pace. I don’t feel like I HAVE to log on every single day but I can if I want.
---
Yea it’s unlearned because you never learned it... it came out after pioneer scouts were added and clearly you did pioneer scouts first before doubling back to Morgantown when they added the plan.
---
It’s not that confusing. My main character has it unlearned also because I hadn’t been to the airport since January lol
---
What do u get? I'm behind the loop for this.
---
The amazing, Aqua cura!
---
I have no clue about that since I didn’t need it
---
I guess if you're going to make the game pay2win, may as well lean in hard, right?
---
I want a Behemoth that break dances at my camp.
---
Ok?
---
Too low of a cost, by quite a bit. 
---
I’d rather see this as an option at every 50th level for free.
---
 Right it reduces the base wieght of the unmodified weapon.  If you could add mods to the dragon they would be at their full wieght.
---
As well, I did craft the pioneer backpack. Upgraded it when I could. No reasons why I shouldn’t know it.
---
I dont think ive had anyone actually swear at me over the mic at all, only ever had like 2 or 3 trouble players that were being knobs, most the time people either ignore you or just give you a wave and be on their merry way
---
I play on PS4 and haven’t had trouble with griefers.  There are some occasional bugs but I find myself able to complete quests with instance.
---
They are not transferable, just learn it or drop it which probably destroys it.
---
The only way you would know it is if you collected the plan from Morgantown airport.... it is not part of the pioneer scouts quest.
---
I've been selling most of them but I'm holding on to the best ones till after the event. I figured most people are going to level up so quick I didn't show up a level 1 and level 5 gear is going to be worthless almost immediately. Once the double XP event is over someone is going to get blessed with some worthy stuff though.
---
Fucking douchebaggins lmai
---
I came here specifically to whine about the game so I guess i'm going to do it here. There's a junk loot paywall to store things you actually want. After this paywall to be able to loot, the experience is more looting same junk with scaled up numbers so things are not as bullet spongey. Paywall for single player too which outright makes me angry. Members have a clear definite advantage and anyone that disagrees is drinking some crazy koolaid. It's bad. Really bad. So bad I don't think I will ever buy from Bethesda again. Only if new Elder Scrolls looks amazing and is twice size of Skyrim. Screw you Bethesda. I don't like you no more.
---
Yeah look, I agree, they're worth that to most.
---
I guess I'm more concerned about space than I am about caps.
---
Caps are easy to come by, my space is limited so if I sell it cheap, I get the space.
---
I slightly wish but no.
---
Thank u , ill buy the plans rn my g
---
If you DM me I'll let you in on a little secret, but you gotta keep it on the DL lol (it's not duping or any cheats to fyi)
---
Go to the Charleston fire station and read the garahan mining company poster to get the quest
---
I am in pc. (Crazymalkavian the name). Are you open to sell me the crashed santa and the lights? Pleeeease???
---
If i had some spare you could have them but alas i was trying to get plans
---
A complete Perk respec system is really not needed, a system with ways to limit number of perks that can be replaced could be in place though.
---
And we should get a complete Specials respec system asap.
---
Yeah thats def a pay to win id vote no personally
---
No RNG should be done client-side. That's how you get stuff like this to happen.
---
Exactly this. This game is honestly my favourite game of all time, and this is why. Thanks for putting it into words!
---
The Pipe Revolver can benefit from Rifleman perks as well as Gunslinger perks if you put a stock on it.  You could massively boost your damage if you use those along with all the Gunslinger perks you're already running.
---
Since they're both unmodified and 2.4 is not 10% of 7.8, it's not a sufficient explanation as to what's going on with that legendary effect
---
Sounds like something man would say. Also sounds like the issues in the world today and through history. You pay to be elite and above the other and gain advantage vs someone level 50 ,fight or trade "isn't worthy of your new 5 star weapon standard" you entitle youself to. And removing limits on everything standard and fair among players is again just paying to become exempt. Dumb. Selfish. No Class. Go gamers come from excelling and out doing people with the same stuff. Calling bluff and skill. Not cash. So if thats how you want it. Then it should be that 
---
Only Fallout 1 and 2nd can only trade between each other with subsidize loot and profit from bonus abilities . 
---
1 and 2 can only PVP between each other since players ablilites are excessive to normal. Maybe even Private server only
---
I mean. You cant just get the green light on everything. If you pay to win amd be 1 or 2 then you should be removed from certain justifiable situations that come with daily game play. You wanna pay for the clouds. Then go play in them. Dont run around like a normal wastelander , when you'd be a wolf in sheep skin. Kinda like biting your nose to feed your face. Or gluttony. Just seem unethical. Amd skilless to pay for rank. What you are explain sounds like what a couple players at lvl 1000 deserve,
---
Thanks I didn't know that or never registered the levels when I crafted it, never got it on my main, will go upgrade  👍
---
10th perk is kind of whack so I’d offer 30k lmao
---
Yes, I checked my bar before a couple of quests.
---
no fuck that noise
---
 BoS Heavy Combat is the best armour in the game.
---
Isn't that usually with the rifle though? I never have this otherwise at least it's more useful then syringer ammo.
---
Wish the rr had a pistol version though
---
Thanks, i just bought the plans for the heavy combat armor
---
 Wallace has most of that stuff.
---
Yeah this is what got me a few days ago. I knew what he was doing but wanted to record him doing it lol. Not that i can submit it to Bethez anyways since the link conveniently fails on all 3 different browsers i tried.   
---
But uhhh, server wipes? Ummm WAT!?
---
Unfortunately, my fix is more of a low-level "bandaid" workaround than a proper solution. I don't know why certain particle effects like the Strangler Heart acid cause the behavior described, I just alleviate the symptoms.
---
From testing, the cause of the freezes is a likely a concurrency issue in the code for particle shader effects: Performance profiling reveals virtually 100% of CPU time is spent waiting in a spin loop across multiple threads. This "bandaid" fix simply sets a timer and curbs execution once it gets out of hand.
---
Its getting removed?
---
You have better chance for rare mounted heads from large but better odds for other drops from medium.
---
What are we looking at here
---
This is why I enjoy console.
---
 Get the BoS mods for Torso and Limbs and you are good to go. Find a Dense Chest and ... give it to me. They are so rare. ;)
---
Dense chestpiece?
---
 Its Dense Torso for Combat Armour. Very rare but with 3 Fireproof and that, I can stand on cars and set em' off. ;)
---
Hey, your struggle is not in vein, we freed him today. He’s in a mate of mine’s camp hiding from Preston Garvey who is for some reason a white NPC
---
That’s why I got it, benefits from nerd rage, adrenaline, demo expert as well
---
Great pic. Call me crazy, but I’m kinda looking forward to the holiday grind. I shouldn’t cuz the Halloween grind burned me out and I haven’t played much NW since then.
---
Fucking weirdo
---
It's true, there's a very weird phenomenon in 76 for how griefers almost universally wear Fasnacht masks.
---
It's almost like they have zero creativity or redeeming value as human beings. 😋
---
I’m on Xbox if you’re willing to be generous and donate some plans to my cause :)
---
I'm glad I saw this before considering getting fallout 1st. Bethesda really let us down.
---
Looks legit
---
Thanks for the tip will try that. Merry Christmas!
---
I’ll buy those plasma grenade plans if you’re on PS4
---
Did you see the new xbox reveal this weekend?  The thing looks like a PC.
---
Sell it for scrip?
---
...go on
---
Sounds like PvP in Diablo 2:LoD. The bugged out items in .09 patch was insane. Hex charms, white rings, 4socket valors/stormshields 2 socket shakos, 3 socket occys, and these were all on closed servers. Open b.net waz even crazier with items with 100+ bonuses when they should only have like 4.
---
Is anyone buying weapons for scrip right now? I’m at capacity on all of my characters and I imagine most people are as well
---
Can we bottle it? Ik, Ik...no.
---
As a new player (PC) this weekend my experience of other players has been linked with their level:
---
1-15 - wants to team up and explore
---
30-50 - cautious about why I am usually exploring their camp. Occasional gestures. no combat.
---
150+  starts shooting me to goad me into combat.  No gestures, dropping items, pointing directions - just shooting me wherever I went trying to get me to shoot back - even trying to place himself between me and enemies (robotrons, feral ghouls) so I would accidentally hit him and trigger PvP.  Fortunately I had seen previous warning posts here to not shoot back so PvP isn't started - L7 with a pipe pistol vs 150+ isn't really going to go my way.  Eventually gets bored that he's not getting a rise out of me and fast travels away to find someone else to bother.
---
That said I did find a couple of very helpful high level camps - their owners were down in the SE corner playing with nukes.  Finding decontamination showers in their base made for a welcome return stop, until one evidently left the server as the camp vanished from beneath my feet!  Quite handy having access to the different stations to break down materials and make my first bits of basic leather armour.
---
These are great ideas please implement
---
Depends on what they are. I’ve purchased some for starting new characters. Some can be worth pretty good money to the right buyer.
---
Legendaries that are explosive, reduced carry weight, increased perk are great to have.
---
It's not his fault there's constantly bad news to cover. When there's good news, he covers it. There's just way too much of the bad
---
I don’t see the point in cheating in this game you just skip the gameplay
---
Yeah. That'ed do it. Consoles seem to have a lower player base to begin with.
---
Not a bug. That's how it works.
---
I'm roleplaying as an empty Nuka-Cola bottle.
---
Build the personal terminal from the miscellaneous category in the build menu. It will have a mission talking about a suspicious person. That mission will tell you where the tourist is.
---
Depends on the rolls
---
That’s it! Thank you!
---
Take your time on the main quest,if you are going to be around a while you can only do the missions once per character. It is really long and some require friends especially towards the end, so it's good to meet people along the way. Explore when you have time, do side quests when you need a break from the main story. Dont worry too much about hoarding anything you come across because all that gear will be useless once you hit lvl 50. Once at lvl 50, start deciding what you want your endgame build to be, try a few builds out, find the one that's right for you. Build an awesome camp, kill the scorch beast queen, do the public events, enjoy!
---
20$ is honestly such a small amount of cash. It's worth it.
---
Same actually. I'd they keep it clean like today it'll be fun and tolerable.
---
Got it! Thanks a lot :)
---
I always look for cheap legendary’s at vendors. Love to build up scrip on my characters.
---
Thanks :)
---
Someone needs to tell my Santatron this, because he is apparently fixated on fertilizer.
---
Do you have more than one quest active- maybe a misc quest is tripping it up? Or a daily or event?
---
thanks!
---
That's what I've been doing, I've got a character that's only a couple weeks old and had very little scrip coming into this event. My other characters don't have any either because I got robbed by the purveyor selling me all garbage during the last sale.
---
Yes that is weird,
---
This is a good idea or we could be allowed to break down ammo.
---
Completely agree, I dont understand all the bad reviews of this game at all. Been a Bethesda supporter for years and never been dissapointed once, proud subscriber of Fallout 1st since day 1.
---
Only one quest ._.  my compass just seems to not work at all for main quest
---
For once I see the benefit of console. But just once! 😂
---
I feel the same way. I go at my pace, don’t feel like I have to rush and do everything. The sounds and music while you’re exploring and the random radio music that I hear in the far distance. Monitoring my characters vitals and finding magazines, bobble heads, recipes and such in mildly hidden areas you wouldn’t notice unless you’re really scanning the entire area. 
---
Great game
---
At least with that quest you just go as deep as you can into the mine - the button is at the bottom. You’ll find a couple dead bodies there too
---
I absolutely love the Valley Galleria! The feel of getting to explore an abandoned mall-- Absolutely amazing. I wish more stuff happens there too! It's a great set-up that so underused! Fingers crossed for the future!
---
Bloodied and Junkies are definitely the most popular right now. Two Shot is ok as long as you never use VATS or hip fire since it destroys accuracy.
---
Hmm, I had no idea this existed. I wonder if this explains my mysterious death at level 5.
---
I was in build mode with the Pacifist setting turned on, working on my house, when I suddenly heard the low health heartbeat sound. I backed out of build mode, and i had just a sliver of health, slowly decreasing, until I died. No idea what happened, but there was a large blackened area where i was standing, like an explosion, and some of my crops and walls were destroyed.
---
That was 60 levels ago, and I still have no idea what happened.
---
Yeah I just noticed this. Hope it will be updated later :/
---
Unfortunately you can’t use any perks to increase shovels. But none the less I use one and have my wall filled with 9 of them.
---
If you like fallout games, I think it's worth it.
---
If you just want any random game probably other games to snag for 20 bucks. 
---
Lots of hate online, but I still like it and would buy it again for full price, personally.
---
Still.doesn't really matter. Shotguns are basically melee with ammo at this point.
---
I had a couple ie that...  Dropped the bag, I’m running area mic, told them, they still walked right by it.
---
Have  run across a few with mics that have told me they want to find/obtain stuff on their own.
---
ANd a few more when I asked if they need anything, they’ve said no...
---
I think it's less the game and more the support from the devs it's getting. I love the game, but think it's disrespectful to the game and community to released rushed updates that break the game. I've spent a lot of money on it, it should work!
---
Edit: Punctuation
---
Yeah my friends came together and got me a bloody swing speed shovel and it’s my favorite weapon in the game :)
---
I wish!
---
It isn't Photoshop a major exploit has been released that basically lets anyone spawn an item from the game files. Its how people spawned the prydwynn in morgantown. They can also create any legendary with any effects they want.
---
I am glad that my comment made you feel good , you deserve it :) 
---
Youre idea is good , but sadly i find it hard to believe that Bethesda is going to suddenly give a damn about the NW mode .
---
I dont even care about the small sized map anymore , i tried to play a little more, and the hacker problem is way more serious than anything else. What i find even more disturbing ,that some of those cheaters are actually streamers who claim to be just that good.
---
I did some digging into it and discovered that there are numerous ways to hide your cheats while live streaming and its really not difficult at all .
---
I am disgusted by this and from now on i am just gonna AFK through the christmass rewards .
---
Thank you for the invite , i dont have discord or even know how to use it lol , but feel free to add me in the game :gushishi ,and if things ever get better out there,it could be nice to be on the same side :) 
---
Sorry for the rant about cheaters ... i am just way too frustrated .
---
I was able to win ,or at least get to the final 2 ,with relatively no problem using strategy but now....it's just doesnt make any sense the insta kills and proximity damage and people shooting you while in chameleon or stealth boy , or other weird stuff. I especially enjoy it when they shoot me through walls , thats always fun .
---
I dont know , maybe i just got really bad over night .
---
Either way , its not fun anymore .
---
I wish people did that with radium rifles im going broke scrapping the things for mods
---
His RNGPU (Random Number Generating Poop Unit) is functioning properly. RobCo just decided 1% was a good number... 
---
and then 30% of 1% for medium... 
---
and then 15% of 1% for large...
---
This is so frustrating, literally, like you said, 20 feet in the air and you still get smacked by one, it’s so annoying.
---
5 at Point Pleasant, nice surprise. I'd never encountered them before and was only going to get mothman eggs to pay for the wrapping paper
---
They 'earthed' it in because people were glitching inside (or that's the best guess at this point).
---
I verified just today that I am indeed getting Mr Fuzzy tokens for the Camden Park dailies, even though I don't get the end quest notifications. I checked it explicitly because it's not worth doing if I don't get them. Fortunately, I did. Your mileage may vary.
---
Seriously what would a wipe do? All it would do is hurt legit people and allow the hackers to have the most rare things day 1... Sounds like just helping the hackers and putting them in the position they want!
---
I've had so many I broke down and sold some to vendors, even a few Bloodied, just to get them out of my inventory.
---
I thought it was 35... Did they nerf the Ammo Capacity for Drum Mags?
---
Don't think it has anything to do with RNG manipulation. This is part of the same exploit that lets people spawn the prydwynn in morgantown. Basically they can spawn anything they want into game that is in the game files, including legendaries with whatever mods they want, hell there have been reports of them even being able to spawn in atom shop items.
---
Any idea how much it's worth? I came across one from the Santa scorched :)
---
I would use it but I have a sledge already
---
2 star deathclaw tame didn't realize it wasn't going to play on post..😅
---
It's clearly photoshopped. especially the font looks wrong.
---
Are you not sneaking? If so why dodgy? And why not vats? Much faster kills in most cases for over. I'd also reconsider unyielding armor. For the XP boost alone from int and the sneak bonuses from ago even if you don't want vats.
---
Use unyielding,  then gunslinger X3x3 (9) , covert op x3 escape artist x1, sneak X2
---
Also the rifelam perks as you know.
---
Always out of touch.
---
They didn't, They can spawn atom shop skins as well as any legendary item with whatever rolls they want. It is why the 5star fixer that got posted earlier had atom skin on it as well.
---
People can spawn in anything right now
---
Oh boy, and they waited until the free weekend to mass dupe. This is gold. Imagine spending your time trying to earn things legitimately when others can create a thousand 5* god tiers at will
---
I was doing the Halloween over the weekend, on 2x exp and being able to earn everything at once it was alright.
---
I can't imagine finishing more than a few of the unlocks at 1x exp and having to earn rewards subsequently for the Christmas event &gt;\_&gt;
---
I take your point, but is this better?
---
Kinda reminds me of dead island and borderlands modded weapons this is really gettin out of hand if this is legit
---
If you’re on PS4 I’ll come kill you if you want? Or try standing at white spring station that’s what I do if I get one, always someone to kill you there
---
I'm a big Fallout fan. I paid full price for it 4-5 months ago, and play exclusively solo, and it's been worth every penny for me so far. The game has it's issues, but it's not nearly as bad as the Internet (YouTubers in particular) would have you believe. It's not Fallout 5, but I've thoroughly enjoyed it so far. I think of it as Fallout Lite, and that's fine with me.
---
The post prices here are completely reasonable.  Unfortunately, 9/10 vendors don't post here.
---
Carnivore Mutation and Cannibal Perk for me.
---
have a trusty friend kill you.
---
I used to think Bethesda was the greatest game company of all...but now i know better . After every stupid decision they have made with this game , i can say for certain that i will not be purchasing any more of their product's .
---
It may sound bitter , and i probably am , but thats how it is with regards of how i feel about them for quite some time now .
---
My main character runs a vats build with a bloodied vats-vats fixer and I just want an alternate build without the use of vats. Trying to make a tanky low health build is all that can take a hit as well. I also run an unyielding sneak build on him and I have some good bolstering pieces that I wasn’t using as well.
---
 XB1?
---
Stash your junk asap
---
It’s called constructive criticism, not “shitting all over it”
---
will try white springs
---
I figured it out after awhile it was more of a inconvenience lol
---
the first day was 3-4 per visit at collision course for me as well.  now all areas i hit seem to be 1-2.
---
...or horribly horribly wrong :)
---
Any popular game gets the YT vultures dude. Starts out as passionate fans, digresses into clickbait and sponsored reviews etc. Spreading word of an exploit fucks us all up in the long run.
---
Yes. Handmade used to be 85 now its 30 I think
---
People figured out that they could jump thru the door and out of the map.  Instead of fixing the lack of collision, bethesda removed the door.
---
If you want a specific build just for the sake of that build style you don't really have to worry about what's best. If you wanna do the most DMG consistent vats headshots are going to win the day. But if you are bored of.that I'd go with a non revolver pistol/melee/tank for something different.
---
Min/maxing for a be revolver is what it is. If you don't min/max, it's kind of.just whatever tickles your fancy. To be honest other than the queen you'll already one shot everything with even a single rank in rifelam and the gunslinger perks so it's just about what numbers you like to see. 
---
For a more balanced build I'd do 3x1 gunslingers, sneak 2, covert op3, escape artist, dodgy 3, evasive 3. I'd still gomwith unyielding but maybe a bolstering mix if you really want that extra Dr. If no vats, then the perception bonus from unyielding will tighten up the crosshairs a little.
---
Worth it even as a solo player. You can find someone on the server to play with or playing solo is actually fun. If you like finding new locations for a good view or if you like lore you can hunt down monsters! Being a low level in any game stinks but challenges make the game fun! Huge plus is the game usually levels enemies for you.
---
How do you get a level 50? At least that would be better.
---
Carnivore let's the food come to me! Anytime one of those mole rats burrow up at me I just eat them!
---
Some guy have me one
---
Did you make the war drum? It looks amazing
---
Always have a vampire's on backup.
---
Hahaha
---
I have tried mixing in bolstering a few times myself.but always hate losing the XP bonus from unyielding since I'm normally sneaking anyway. 
---
I should note I don't pvp really. Most of my friends that pvp seem to favor the uny/bolstering mix as well.
---
Lol I got scammed out of my unyielding ap refresh, harder to detect while sneaking wood chest piece the other day. It was sad.
---
That’s true, thanks for trying to understand the build. I’ll try and fine tune and possibly invest in some vats perks as well. Just trying to max a non vats play style was all
---
Except that one guy who wins the match in under a minute because he can AoE one-hit everyone through walls for half a map of range and continues to do so for multiple days on end, while wearing weapons and altering his size in the vault lobby.
---
That one, that one is 100% transparency.
---
I am getting TONS at workshop defense when scorched spawn
---
I'd be laughing, too, if it weren't for the looks of disappointment on all the good little boys' and girls' faces...
---
Wooby is back. We freed him from the dev room and now hes chilling at my camp hiding from Todd
---
They got it for me as a gift so I don’t know how much they spent!
---
Totally makes sense. Good.thing 8snthat with that weapon and a handful of perks, none of the monsters stand a chance except sheep and queen. =P
---
Agree all the way although it barely feels like an MMO. I’ve tried everything from RuneScape and WoW to ESO and GTAO and this is the only game in that kind of genre that I’ve been able to stick to. The grind in other MMOs I’ve played just never interested me because despite playing with friends they just felt way too grindy for me to play consistently. Despite 76’s problems I’ve been playing since launch and the game has only gotten better besides some of the things like the scrap box being locked behind a paywall. Player vending was the biggest change for me, being able to see other players and the work they put into their unique CAMPs made me enjoy the game even more and I haven’t stopped playing since. The community is also another thing that keeps me coming back, everyone in game is super chill and mature and are usually willing to help each other which is a nice change of pace for someone like me who plays R6 which can very toxic at times. I’m also a bit biased since I’m a Fallout fanboy but I think the game holds on its own even if you’ve never played a Fallout game before.
---
You realize that someone having this thing has no effect on your game play right? If you happen to run across someone with this weapon they could kill something faster than you... Which they could already accomplish with any decent legitimate three star weapon.
---
Pick up every rat poison you see. They are 5 lead each. They are everywhere and people don't seem to pick them up usually. Also, the wooden blocks have lead paint as well. I have more lead that I can use generally, despite my handmade going through ammo like candy, just by picking those up when I see them.
---
Have you missed the hackers in adventure mode? Like the 10 star legendaries, or the prydwynn being in morgantown?

Fair, glad you enjoy it!
---
if you love something you wont blindly follow it, you can love something and still call it bad. I love the room but its literally one of the worst movies ever made with valid criticisms attached to it. JuiceHead likes the game, but he likes it to the point that, he wants to see it get better so he talks about the issues in the small chance bethesda will listen, they probably wont but no harm done by talking about it
---
How is pointing out obvious flaws in a game Juicehead actively promotes on his channel shitting on the game. Would you like him to never point out current/ongoing issues in the game? If so people would call him a shill like they currently do Oxhorn. (Undeserved as Oxhorn criticizes the game as much as anyone).
---
Someone focuses on the lore and positives in Fallout 76 they get attacked. Someone focuses on current in game events/bugs/new content in Fallout 76 and they get attacked.
---
How could anyone live up to the impossible standards some of us gamers set? Seems like a lose lose to me if you're a Fallout YouTube Content Creator.
---
Oh I only do that for daily or weekly challenges.
---
There's a ton of weights in the Hornwright Estate as well.
---
Yep.  Found the Plan today.  4000 caps short of affording it.  I have hope now.  It might take a while, but its possible.
---
How? It's not.
---
Anyone else think its funny its level 45 not 50 😂
---
You're comparing apples to oranges here. Cheating in a game like overwatch can be monitored in specific ways. It's easy for a system to look at your 100% aimbot accuracy and flag it as suspicious, it's more complex to monitor the inventory of every single player in a game like this looking for hacked weapons in real time.
---
&gt; apples to oranges
---
But you can still compare them.
---
Strangler is that goal I just got mine!
---
Store everything under junk take off all of your armor and clothing and walk naked and unarmed into white springs.
---
*NOSE EXHALE*
---
Oh ok, nice. I'll still have to check it tomorrow when I do my dailies.
---
The guys going around this weekend are winning the entire matches in under a minute. AoE one-hit kill through walls with unlimited range.
---
I also watch where they go, and follow them around in my clown costume/fasnacht man mask.
---
It's interesting to see their reactions so far.
---
I also give them vodka and wine.
---
So it all comes down to the basics again: pick up every item you see, scrap them, store them.. Then later on figure out why 400 kg of your stash limit is being used by yao guai bones or deathclaw hands. But yeah thanks for the tip man.
---
I’m sorta prepared. I stupidly did each unlock when it came out each day.  I was at 13950, started a new match and wandered out into the ring and killed myself.
---
Or Worse, 50* Junk Jets.
---
What griefing are you referring to?  Can you explain?
---
Maybe next time you'll just hop to a different server.
---
I miss the tse days
---
I mean.....we do have radstags. Would make more since to have a mutant red nosed radstag.
---
No junkies? Worthless trash.
---
I’ve been playing this game since the beta... I’ve have never had a need or wanted to use a mic ever in any online game.... 
---
until this game.
---
I’ve met and made great online friends and now use a mic because of this.
---
Guess what I’m saying you will meet new people and enjoy the communities build within.
---
Amazing work (and costume), you should replace the background with an SBQ scene and make a poster
---
Look at Eckserah playing CM haha
---
Redbox is selling all there games and has fallout for 7 bucks
---
Look at the cap value! All them stars and it’s not even worth 400cap!!
---
E
---
Also looking to buy the Shielded Vault Suit, Thanks in advance.
---
I'm telling them what I was told whne I had a phone call with customer support about some issues including this one.
---
Mr. Howard, great to see you on Reddit. How have you been?
---
Btw not trolling I love this game too.
---
U might sell cheap at vendors so tat lower level picks them up. If scrips r not ur concern
---
Yep ive opened double this and only have seen one (consumed it). Hope i roll another so I can recoup some of the caps.
---
Somebody's totally going to see that and kill it.
---
I've yet to get the icicle lights and really want them. Tell me your on PS4 and can hook me up with some plans?
---
worked 
---
Wish people would stop with the trap camps and workshops 
---
their no longer funny their annoying
---
A free to play weekend is an exploiters wet dream. Infinite accounts to "play" with...
---
I've been leaving gift boxes around Flatwoods church and the overseers camp.
---
One  contained a full set of pocketed leather, marine wetsuit, and a modded pipe pistol.
---
Take my downvote.
---
If it's real it would have to be a form of procedural generation. People use to do it in diablo games. Bethesda needs to fix this or stop the ones doing it.
---
What are the rules for writing length on here? Also, ever wonder how in these ridiculous social applications (Instagram, Reddit, Facebook) alter the way one traditional reads a story? Different rules for each app pertain to the ordering in time of comments. Pretty fucking scary if you ask me. Basically syntax changes and you these things are skewed into all sorts of directions because of multiple comment and thoughts by different people, rather than something explained with a actual one perspective timeline. I’m guessing memes are an evolution of this and probably are the initial morphological units due to writing this way on here.
---
Awe did I hurt your feelings love bug :(
---
I'm pretty lucky n have sold a few handmades. Furious + mutated 10% addn damage etc.
---
It's a I 33 15 dragon, uses rifleman perks. It won't work with commando though, railway will do similar in 10 shots if you run that way. Ffr railway is good. Yeah if the dragon connects with the head on a sb, it's dead. Even legendary, I missed that second one cause can't vats a pacified.
---
Works good for shooting down cargo bots too [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUU6MT2tRcM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUU6MT2tRcM)
---
Some full health westek farming with a instigating fixer [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCKAUSHE\_so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCKAUSHE_so)
---
It's so ammo efficient, the queen I go heavy f ffr 50 cal. Total switch but it does a better job.
---
Power armor is already legendary, however if they made a set that didn't require cores I'd be in.
---
Yup, some of the specific brews make it worth it, plus you need it for various atom challenges.
---
It's so wholesome seeing people get excited about this a year after release. Good job pal.
---

Thing of how long you typically are on the toilet for. Don’t write something that takes longer than it takes someone to go to the bathroom.
---
Up votes doesnt give u a free macdonalds meal. Dun worry abt it.
---
I'd be into it. Also would love a ghoul apocalypse event where we have to rescue survivors in the mall. Dead Rising style!!!!
---
I guess it is a good thing he didn't explain how the exploit works :)
---
Weight reduction armor is apparently desirable for people who have mules.
---
I usually get plenty of food at flatwoods. Yeah it goes bad but it takes a while and flatwoods does resupply.
---
Plot twist, it's not MMO :F
---
Oh no his good boy points :(
---
Is just another drop in the bucket. There's a paywall for junk storage and single player servers. I tried to rationalize getting Fallout 1st couple days ago but I just can't. It all leaves a bitter taste for the whole game. The game was downgraded to make membership seem like a good deal. I expect more from Bethesda.
---
Nah just spicing this up a bit. ;)
---
Yep! I’ve been giving them the low level Legendaries as well as duplicate plans from the event! And I’ve been trying to find outfits to give them as well.
---
I haven't got a single one the entire event except the ones I made.
---
You do realize these hackers can kill people with pacifist on using, *oh I don't know,* **HACKS**. Fallout 1st is especially shitty because it lets people pay to avoid encountering *ANY* of these hackers, which I seem to encounter on a now regular basis.
---
Strip naked, collect as much fertilizer as possible run around hitting people with as comical a weapon as you can find
---
Well then you invest lots of time in each message that you write on here. I mean good ideas only take a minute to think about especially when you’re focused on taking a crap. I’m sure individuals who have contributed to some really important stuff in this game were shitting there brains out lol
---
If you're good enough to make shotguns work, you don't need my tips. ;-)
---
They can be very effective, but even kitted out with all of the supporting perks they don't have the range that casual players would want.
---
All of them are like that, poor poor coding nothing else. The 'mods' theory is garbage. I have dozens of weapons and armors with 90% WR still weigh a ton, zero mods fresh from corpses. Only one weapon that got this right is a Gamma gun, even with mods it's still less than a pound. That one guy who coded this needs to be promoted and oversee all other programmers.
---
So where is it this year? It’s not even in the datamined stuff.
---
I mean, there's still loads of aimbots in NW and they don't do jackshit about it. Literally took them weeks for the most notorious of them.
---
