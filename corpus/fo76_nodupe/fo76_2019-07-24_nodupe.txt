Yeah, for me weapons disappear from wheel just when I have two same kinds of weapons like two Combat Shotguns etc. but I never lost weapon from my inventory. I didn't mind this exploit when they could steal your stash box stuff, I don't have anything special there but if you can steal weapons from character inventory then it's pretty scary since I and many others have worked hard to get their weapons. I got my first Bloodied handmade just after 400h in so, it would have sucked if I haven't noticed the bag or if the person taking the items was purposely taking those.
---
---
---
Sweet i hope my inventory didn't get touched. Thank you
---
way to make me never go into the bathroom again.
---
I always brace for grenades, felt like I was always coming across that in fo4 but not in 76
---
Fucking snitches
---
This seems to get suggested every week or so. It does feel weird being under misc as it's an important ingredient in making ammo but it shouldn't be junk. I think it should just move to the ammo category so when you have reduced ammo weight it helps along with that. But that's just a mild suggestion and it doesn't really interfere with my flow too much.
---
Yeah, I didn’t get anything for the longest time, but I always do pretty decent damage now. And the other kills not dropping make me sure It’s not just the queen. I was hoping someone else had the problem :(
---
My bad I messed up a letter 😂 that one really stings. There’s a pandemic going on btw take ur self outside of fallout for a minute or ur head out ur ass and u’d see it. Also come back and read this all when ur older and u’ll see what a dumbass u r 😘
---
\*Ralph Wiggum Voice\* I'm a duper now.
---
Gotta pick about 10 locks to get any real attention lol
---
Found a duper
---
The game is no different  than it was a week ago.  Grow the fuck up drama queen.
---

---
In fact it's better than it was a week ago because now we're several dupers shorter and now know that bethesda is watching people and ready to bring down the ban hammer with vengeance again in the future.
---
Its not real.
---
I duped all kinds of shit, like literally over 100  legacys. Bethesda literally gave me every single one back today with a slap on a wrist (on a burner account I could give a shit less about) Good job officer Doofy, you really are making a difference lmao
---
Keep being a snitch and you won’t last long in the world
---
I'm Lycan your thinking.
---
See what i did there 😉
---
Are u slightly simple?  What has a pandemic got to do with duping?  Oh. Yourself. Bless. I’ve got older underpants than you child.
---
Any specific enemy prefix is worthless generally. 
---
Instigating, Anti-Armor &amp; Furious are non-build good prefixs. Junkies &amp; Bloodied are the two best, but come with either stat defects or a minimal health bar, both of which can be maintained or utilised to only minimal negatives. Two-Shot is fun, but not sold as seen, and no longer does a strong damage effect. It isn’t two-shot, but rather a small bonus in damage really. Explosive is fun and is manipulatable to get some nice high damage out of it, which pairs with the main prefixs nicely. Nocturnal whilst rejected by most, can be pretty nice in at night time; I have a Nocturnal side weapon which is flushed with ammo, so I can use it nilly-willy and stay away from my main weapons which I use during the day. For third prefixes, I always prefer 90% Reduced Weight as it can be helpful to have the extra space, but some focus on accuracy and criticals, so it’s not super essential to focus on the third one.
---
1) First Mothman encounter...was creeping up on me in the ash heap area. I shot him and he screeched and flew right to me!
---
2) Also Ash heap. I was like a level 27. I saw 2 Fog Crawlers in the road. I tried to sneak past but they made a straight beeline for me. One of the only times I ran from something in this game. I figured I could lead them back to some settlers I came across that were hunting Mirelurks. When I got to that area the settlers were gone but in their place was the scorched! The fog crawlers attacked the scorched I kept running for what seemed like an eternity. I looked back and saw the fog crawlers who were staring in my direction and then they turned around.
---
How big was the group? If it's like 15 people, then 100% is negligible in the playerbase
---
Craft a few *non-legendary* low level but fully modded handmades and combat rifles, and put them up for sale for cheap in your camp. There's literally no reason for high levels to buy these.
---
This is really the only way you can run a weapons shop specifically aimed at low level players.
---
I miss those days.

There's also that rock that had the blue screen of death. Like the skin of the rock was the blue screen of death patter.
---
I'll fucken do it again. As my identity remains hidden.
---
Probably just suspended people so they couldn’t continue to dupe. Bandaid fix like they generally adopt, now the exploits patched people r free to get back on. The new found supply in the markets has destroyed rmt which is also against Bethesda’s tos. Plus they don’t lose a significant player base which losing could harm their ability to continue updating supporting and devoting time to this game
---
This worked for me, just running it from the Start menu and not the Xbox App.
---
Visual bug. When someone alt F4s, that happens. They appear to be there when they're not.
---
Agreed! I've only been playing the game for like a month and on teams for maybe a week, but earlier today I had a teammate wave us over from across the map to take down a legendary scorchbeast and then we did a bunch of events together. It was really nice!
---
I'm just waiting for the game to turn into black and white
---
All good information. I may as well be new. I only recently picked the game back up recently. The game has come a long way!
---
*fOuNd De DuPeR*
---
They used some technique to find the duper’s and people who benefited from duper’s, so they did something.
---
Let's be honest, will this game be able to compete with new games coming out. I've played this nearly  3000 hours &amp; I think unless the new content is a big story driven DLC with major improvements then this game will see a declining player base.
---
So levels I have kept, weapons there is a few missing I’m pretty sure, but I don’t think we’re getting away with anything as if it happens again we lose our accounts
---
I think that since they're going to do the work anyway once Fallout 5 begins production, they'll probably try to push for a rerelease with a next gen version a la Skyrim Special Edition that runs along the current one, possibly with both players being on the same servers, to get back part of what they lost with the disastrous launch.
---
In any case, they'll definitely try to implement as much as possible of the new tech in the game to keep it relevant. This game's graphics were called outdated when Fallout 4 released, there's no way they're going to keep 76 looking the same all the way through, especially since if they don't upgrade it, it kind of defeats the purpose of using the same engine as their single player games rather than using a new one like Zenimax did for ESO.
---
Thanks!
---
Turning off the jukebox will only fail the event, unless you have enough people playing instruments. You can’t farm it for 30 minutes anymore, sadly
---
Thank you so much!
---
That conspiracy would make sense if we could put the nukes in the scrapbox
---
Unless a solid 2 other people show up, I only use it for xp.
---
There's no point getting the ore if there's nobody there to protect the people, imo.
---
Had you just joined the server? There is a exploit that if you get to someone's camp that just joined the before it fully loads in you can steal from there stash through there vendors but I thought it was patched.  Maybe he did it on accident and was nice enough to drop it?
---
That’s up to you.  If those were legacies that you bought from someone else, and those were duped, then you could run the risk of being banned/suspended in the future. 
---
If you can’t say with 100% certainty that they are legit, that’s up to you to decide what risk you want to take.
---
Not continuously, but have had a fair amount of fails lately. Servers are diluted with newer players, so just not enough dps sometimes. But they'll get there, should even out in a month or so. Just enjoy the show when the one power armor jockey there is running around with a ski sword, and everyone else is camped on the bunker with rifles. I imagine it's what it was like when the game was new.
---
Yeah, final warning is like oof lmao, but a week off was chill lmao, let me catch up on other games instead of grinding 76
---
Lol if you’ve been allowed to keep weapons and armour you duped it’s a joke. And yes you’ve got away with cheating. Well done.
---
Inspirational 1 stacks with Inspirational 3.
---
Inspirational 2 doesn't stack with either.
---

---
Imagine when we get enclave update , you will have to choice which faction join to BoS or Enclave. It would add whole new level of PvP and PvE events.
---
Hell yeah man, I’ll be looking forward to seeing you there, ima get that t65 paint real soon
---
I just finished devving a vats pistol toon, and the pipe guns having inherent faster fire rates worked better than the western/single action revolvers concerning 95% misses. The varying damage is definately more noticable with the pipe guns versus westerns and singles, which have slower fire rates. So, maybe this is all part of Beth's position that the problem is complicated.
---
Working to fix the wiki. Stay tuned.
---
It was datamined that it was a system that detected how many legacies a person has or how much a person served hopped.
---
Not when I tried. 🤷‍♀️
---
Tyvm.  I'll try that next time.  If only the gauss shotgun didn't block all interactions sometimes.  Can't wait for that bug to disappear.   I absolutely love the shotgun.
---
Hey, the eagle was an actual model change, not a skin for once. Now we need a two handed sword skin for the board, that increases damage as well
---
I completed the event 5 times. Got zero plans, just crap.
---
This.is.brilliant.
---
 Bugs fixed.
---
So what let them dupe our market does not need to crash because of it.  I am salty I get that so down vote at will.  But what weapons were duped B 25/25 fixers and be 25 legacies and the the Gatling plasma thing.  Who gives a crap lets just play and have fun.  Sorry not trying to be a dick but I have been playing since launch so I guess I have experienced a lot of dupes...fu...them. play and trade normally
---
You only need the animal friend lev 3 not wastland whisper.  And it has to be a random spawn that spawns in alone. So if theres more than one around you cant tame. And if it spawns in the same place all the time cant be tamed.
---
I heard ( from on of the youtubers ) about an idea of giving ammo points for the converter instead of actual ammo as quest rewards. So hope this is true
---
"My friends and I are destroying this game and it's Bethesda's fault for not trying harder to stop us"
---
[deleted]
---
This. 
---
Drives me crazy—so many have tunnel vision on the spawn points. I try to dip into the middle between caves just to glance to make sure there’s no ghouls slapping a scavenger. If there are a few ghouls I’ll use the Auto nade launcher to clean out the middle and hallway on my way back into the tunnels.
---
It might have been your level. He was level 43 for me when I found him, and I was higher level than him.
---
Yuuuuup
---
Has around 7k members
---
Do dont need both animal friend is all you need for animals and wastland whisper is for creatures
---
Nope, I was on the server about 2 + hours, plus the gun wasn't inside of my stash it was in my inventory and in use so probably not that one
---
Like you wouldnt throw 2k atoms at bethesda's face to be able to dress your own death claw like this, come on ... If we can get commie and junkie robots, we should be able to get french maid death claws!
---
Your a bitch plain and simple. Snitches are literally the scum of the earth.
---
Someone didn't get free legacies when the dupe was out, you poor thing.
---
I had 6 over level 100 earlier plus me. Only 2 people got ore and all scavengers died  How? I even healed three offthem 2x. Sigh. I will never get the damn hazmat suit.
---
I used to hide mine too, but my stuff gets broken so many times now due to where I live it’s easier to repair all with the module :) 
---
And the mats thing dear god yes please!
---
Lmao who doesn’t do that?
---
No, i want to kill her without EXTRA time, effort, and ammo. Also dunno why you’re so salty about this. You like wasting your time because others want to do stupid pointless shit?
---
💜
---
Lol big difference between that stuff and straight copying items lol
---
If you’re bloodied/junkies, protect the crew. 
---
If you’re not bloodied/junkies your damage is terrible what are you doing attacking things get back in the mines peon.
---
I traded my way into having legacies and aae fixers. But I see now that this reddit is full of cheaters and dupers.
---
Xbox it was just recently too, I have it recorded on live all of my clothes and power armor accidentally “fell” into someone else’s inventory “in the heat of battle sometimes you drop gear” I will probably never find those legendary again
---
Oh, I hadn’t noticed the suggestion before, oops.
---
I personally see it fitting more naturally with all the other junk/scrap, given it’s traits, but I could settle for this too.
---
I’m not I got the warning and next time an exploit comes out I’m leaving for a week
---
Most people I come across are cool unlike other online games
---
I'll fuken do it again
---
I always do the same and have had no issues, wonder if that could have anything to do with it
---
I’m the salty one? You’re the one whining here and telling other people how to play their game, lol.
---
Looks like it worked, tons of people are getting unbanned. Not only that, they are getting to keep everything they duped hahahaha
---
Found the salty duper
---
Yeah it was a level 90 3 star in a nuked zone, most of just got lucky with the no spawns I guess. I got a picture but it’s not very good and I’m on mobile so I dunno how to share it.
---
Nothing is real - Mathematical Proof :
---
1. a = b + 1
---
2. (a-b)a = (a-b)(b+1)
---
3. a2 - ab = ab + a - b2 - b
---
4. a2 - ab -a = ab + a -a - b2 - b
---
5. a(a - b - 1) = b(a - b - 1) 
---
6. a = b
---
7. b + 1 = b
---
8. Therefore, 1 = 0
---
...and your head implodes🙈🙉🙊
---
I'd love to see scorched earth instead of always giving me so many repair kits I can't use have it a random mix of repair kits, scrap kits and lunch boxes. Hell make the hardest events all mix up the rewards with even a chance of getting one, watch project paradise and radiation rumble be played for event completion not just xp
---
That's my worry
---
I can even start my daily from her for some reason so idk
---
*Members, the... steel union... is posturing once again. We need to... teach them some manners.*
---
Wow that’s deep, as deep as Todd’s wallet
---
Did you pull that number out of your ass?
---
Bethesda is so soft for unbanning cheaters. All this does is reinforce the notion that cheating is okay and has no consequences. Fuck them and the dupers.
---
Mystery Stranger and Saviour (in events like encryptid or paradise)
---
You’re being super antagonizing, “salty” was just the easier word.
---
Idc how people play so long as they aren’t making shit harder for the entire server. If you don’t have a problem with that, you’re probably part of the problem. But people like you never change, so i’ll not be here to fruitlessly try and change your outlook. Take it easy 👍
---
O man dude that is weird. Only other thing I could think is the "amazing" coders at Bethesda maybe where looking for dupped items and messed somthing up (shocker) and got into your account on accident?? Its a head scratcher for sure. But at least you got it back in the end.
---
You didn’t lose 190 bullion. You lost 19 treasury notes
---
Funny, I didn’t partake. I have items that are definitely duped. I wouldn’t have even half my end game gear if it hadn’t been for dupers. A LOT of people wouldn’t have the things they do if it wasn’t for dupers. You can call it destroying the game all you want when the truth of the matter is the majority of people play it like a single player co-op game anyway and more people have benefited from it than anything. In what way has it hurt you? Did something you have drop in value? So that means it’s affordable for other players then, right?
---
Shame on me though for trading with the guy who will almost definitely have anything I’d need in a game where my actions don’t effect you
---
Yeah, that's just unforgivable. The very least you can do is try to get to Reward Level 1 so you complete the event.
---
Surgical mask is my go to accessory in game when I’m not wearing the mothman gas mask.
---
FO1st is a time saver, sure, but I don't see it as a pay to win. I still have to manage my stash limit.
---
It should, but while the issue is not resolved, you can just keep the boxes or use 'em in a safe party where no one will accidentally make the bonus to go over 100% turning it to 0%.
---
I literally played the same way as OP did and managed to finish the season during the double xp, playing half of the time with lunchbox bonuses. I usually opened one box at a time with two of my friends opening the other two, after that we split, switched servers and joined other teams, but we literally lost only one-two boxes each out of about 10-12 used due to that bug. Since I didn't do many events and farmed all the locations solo (it's much more efficient), the possibility someone would've opened a box nearby was quite low.
---
Got about 26 lunchboxes left after the season so I guess I'll just keep them till the next one or a double/triple xp event.
---
Wow, five times.  One day they'll sing songs about your dedication and perseverance.
---
All outfits I believe are available.
---
Yeah true, also it does radiation damage so it tends to heal enemies.
---
They need something that convert radiation damage to true damage or something.
---
Isn't that a lv 98 or something reward?
---
They knew that we cheated and let us go with a warning lmao.
---
Yea a vanilla way to get them after people dupe to the fucking moon
---
Same here! Especially true if you farm solo being a part of a team just to get all these sweet xp bonuses -))
---
It's odd how how a bear is so much more of a threat. I can survive getting surprised by a deathclaw but a bear getting the jump on me and I'm surrendering myself to mothman
---
I just picked it up a couple days ago.
---
  
---
The ranger outfit and the July outfit are all that are there as far as outfits.
---
So yes, the ranger outfit is available for new FO1 as of less than a week ago.
---
What helmet are you talking about? Got a picture of it?
---
They're issuing permabans as well as final warnings so it stands to reason the people who were issued warnings were most likely innocent.
---
They can't bc it actually takes closer to 10 mins 😂
---
it's your character grunting while moving all his/her stash into the server.  :)
---
GummyRingworms explained it right.
---
So if I buy it today I can get it right?
---
I constantly run nukes. Collossus is too easy a target in the grove. And leaving the grove open is the best place to fight the Queen. Wide open a d plenty of places to land.
---
Ive got first and an infinite junk box. Loads of junk. And my own server. My server gets one time spawns so i dont get much in the way of world drops. I do get to use the workshops uninhibited but you know, shit takes time. I dont get ppl to help kill sbq. I dont magically have use for my scrap without plans and i dont magically get tons of junk. Im not trying to be a dick but im not winning more with my membership. Its convenient but its not really makin my game easier
---
8pm EST
---
Yea I think the idea that this item being under misc throws ppl off. I still find it odd. When I first started playing I never used it and would toss it. I would agree that it's weird there but being it's also used in a beer recipe I guess could make it a consumable 😂
---
They reset at 8pm EST every day. Just check your time zone and you’ll know exactly when you can head over and pick up the new daily.
---
I've been throwing atoms for much less interesting things. You bet your @$$ I'd do it 😂
---
Wow, someone sure gets salty when they get called out for having an inventory full of gear they didn't actually earn.
---
If you really cared this much about dupers you'd be contacting Bethesda to make sure you and your friends get the full on bans you all deserve.
---
Oh you right. They aren't equal in value.
---
I appreciate this.
---
In my experience you would be excluding high level players.  I don’t see many low level players try the sbq without power armor, the folks without power armor are usually high level.  Also it has been debunked repeatedly that the SBQ has scaling damage; so low level players are not making it harder.  That being said; your nuke your rules.  So if you choose to fight in the nuke zone that’s totally your call.
---
could you also make skins for the normal bow work on the compound bow?
---
ples todd :)
---
Amusingly it's one of the Nukashine wake-up points (speaking from experience).
---
They could let us play the flute and summon rad-rats. lol
---
Op , may i ask what your main weapon/weapons are ?
---
Yeah. But there’s been a few posts about the helmet not being included with the bundle of outfits. Either a bug or intentional, I’m not sure.
---
I definitely believe the people in the game including the brotherhood of steel are living in a simulation.
---
What # were you on the ban list?
---
Take your tinfoil hat off. I personally know a few people who were suspended, then unbanned today, and none of them have ever purchased even a month of FO1ST
---
&gt;*I tRaDeD mY wAy InTo HaVinG lEgAcIeS aNd AaE fIxErS. bUt I sEe NoW tHaT tHiS rEdDiT iS fUlL oF cHeAtErS aNd DuPeRs.*
---
I totally agree. It definitely needs work.
---
Do both, purchase them and have them drop from the a new nuke event.
---
Are u using the new CAMP skin from SCORE?
---
i think the basic ranger outfit is meant to be the standard 1st reward outfit for no matter when you get it. "paints" for it are what's limited time, so you womt be able to apply a desert skin to it or anything. but yeah, you can buy a single month of 1st at any time and get the ranger outfit.
---
They need a wendigo slayer rolling pin. Just so the bathrooms would be fun to use . Nocturnal ones sound to strong.
---
Yes. You’ll get that and the new bog wanderer outfit
---
Nope, they’re actually not, because you can hold (and easily obtain) thousands of treasury notes. I have almost 4000 and can only spend 20 a day. Treasure Notes become worthless real quick. I wish Bethesda gave us something else to spend them on.
---
Hunters weapons shred scorcbeasts. Also having a full set of troubleshooters makes you pretty unstoppable at encrypted so I don’t think those are worthless.
---
Was it debunked? That’s awesome news if it’s not true. I tried to find objective evidence but everything just led me to a heated reddit thread lol
---
Thank you for the info
---
thank you for this. im unbanned and so happy haha.
---
I wear my red asylum. Now I might have to stop wearing it because people will think I got banned.
---
the main reason is cuz you cant buy the same outfit twice. but yeah, they should have either had an outfit-less version, or got rid of that text.
---
Been debunked, was an old thing in the past but she runs on an algorithm, if the person she targets is in MIDAIR she doesnt land, as long as their feet are on a structure, let it be land or a roof she'll land. The only thing is if she's somehow below you. Like the stupid idiots that make a camp/tower to stand on
---
Thank you that’s what I thought it was!
---
If you're expecting intelligence here then you're looking in the wrong place.  For example they've already admitted in a reply to one of my other comments that their own gear that you're seeing there is all duped.
---
How do you do it, Holmes?
---
So you got an email?
---
You likely have a quest item in your inventory already.  I do, and haven't had to actually go do the quest for weeks.
---
It should only have been a simple SQL-style query on the backend, all the data is housed on their servers, no need to push code out to players to even be datamined.
---
I server hop like a fiend, anyone who has an unplaceable camp would be server hoping.  And people were caught up that received these items too, which some of which were not legacies and they would not have been server hoping.  
---
But whatever the case, it doesn’t matter what method they used. If the items you have were duped, they aren’t legit, no matter how long you’ve had them.  This is why I don’t buy items from players unless its the kind of thing that people wouldn’t dupe or it’s from a trustworthy source.  
---
And I’m still here.
---
Looks like I’m gonna be chugging some ‘shine, then!
---
&amp; I personally know 2 of them that were FO1st members. Clearly what I said is that it “could” be most of them were. Me &amp; you knowing a few people isn’t everyone who plays this game sir.
---
there's always a catch.   thanks again for the advice.  this character i'm currently playing is probably low enough to not register on the Queen
---
Mothman has forsaken me
---
If you think this is about the good of the game, then there’s your issue. Bethesda is inept, lazy, and greedy. Yet just last week this subreddit was up in praise about how Bethesda was saving the game from the evil dupers. And here they released them with pretty much no consequence. 
---
This post isn’t about the game. It’s about how people love to think Bethesda will do this game no harm, when the truth is they don’t care. It’s only about money, even if it has negative impacts to the game. This is about getting people to realize that they don’t care about actually taking care of this game. And if you believe they are, you’re lying to yourself
---
It is not a major pay to win but i can see some people labelling fallout 76 as pay to win :/ stash limits also makes it hard to sell mass scrap and stuff which are heavy as well! Upgrades will make it easier to manage
---
NP.
---
Happy Hunting! :)
---
i still laugh when people call the scrap box pay to win. because me having 1,000 units of wood makes me unkillable or something.
---
I want them to redo workshops so they have more waves and are much harder.
---
This way it would incentivise building a decent base and pvp to steal a decently built workshop from another public team.
---
never had stop to see that they actually eat the thing lol, or throwaway right after.
---
I tried it again today and killed it, turns out you have to fight it inside the highlighted circle area else it won't die. Not sure why, seems very silly.
---
All that effort trading and hours spent. Yet 1000's of duped legacys and God weapons were literally just handed right back to dupers today. How does that make you feel? Lmao
---
I'm always using my gas mask, I replaced it now with a more beautiful artisanal raider mask.
---
FO1 gave me like 600 pounds of stash weight back.
---
Combine that with dumping most things for a cheap price on my vendors and stash weight is never an issue for me anymore.
---
If you put things on your vendors for not insane prices (looking at you 5000 caps for a 1 star regenerating leather armor) they'll get bought pretty quick. Stuff with less desirable rolls you can purge for super cheap to let people convert caps into scrip. Honestly, not many people are going to put forth thousands of caps for anything that isn't a great 2-3 star roll.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I wouldn't complain about upgrading the stash carry space through camp objects, particularly extra kinds of vendors. Like a magazine rack that doubles both as a vendor stand for plans/magazines only, and removes their carry weight. Same with a fridge cooler, or gun racks, or ammo bins. Limited item listing in these specialty shop objects, but they remove the weight of the object as long as it is assigned to it.
---
So you don’t have any legacies like at all?
---
I think radiation resist is pretty relevant since I did the fight in a hazmat suit once and felt super tough (as long as adds didn't come near me).
---
I haven't had much of a problem with just 15 rad resist from SS under armor, I just have to remember to use a stimpack. I don't have any issue now when I wear four SS pieces because well rad resist is over 200 now.
---
I didn't know fireproof works against the scream attack? Is it classed as fire or as an explosion? There is a torso mod which makes you completely immune to fire. I wonder if that's helpful.
---
How does the event work? You need 4 people. 3 watch the scavs while one gets ore. Then the ore collector switches with someone and that person gets ore. And then again and again until all 4 got orem Then you place it in the storage bin and done!
---
If you have PA, that is a plus as you can block the entrance.
---
And having someone with a Shishkebab and Friendly Fire to heal the scava is also a plus.
---
Like wave 1, Lvl 1. Wave 2, Lvl 5? I like it.
---
Did you get an email?
---
Yes I got un-suspensed but they still claimed I duped and giving me a final warning.
---
I joined the event last night and most of the npcs were already dead so as a bloodied build instead of popping radaway and collecting ore for the first time ever I just staked a position and killed... Holy hell do you miss out on experience collecting ore and loot... I'm still gonna be collecting ore because my friend and I want rad barrel plans but if you're trying to get that level up challenge I can see why people don't like collecting. XP and rewards definitely need to be reworked for the players completing objectives as the killers already get their rewards through loot and XP
---
Vault 112 had the inhabitants in suspended animation and hooked up to virtual reality. It’s possible that vault 76 is set up similarly to test how successful rebuilding would be.
---
I cant find a picture, but it was in one of Rifle's videos about the event on PTS
---
Alright I gotcha. So that means that when you lose a note, you don't lose the ten bullion it was worth, I suppose that ten bullion is still there right without the item worth said item?
---
Literally 99% of all legacies in existence are duped. In fact the majority of top end gear anyone owns is duped. If you trade for it, there is an insanely high chance it’s duped. There’s no way everything I’ve traded for has been legit, and you should know that since you’re on the market trying to get yourself some bloodied rifles. You don’t honestly think they’ll be freshly rolled from the purveyor do you?

I can excuse the quest problem (although I don't recall ESO having this problem), but I don't quite get the loading problem. Back when I used to play ARK I would never have this problem. If I loaded into to a base built over a cliff, with nothing but air below me, I would not spawn falling to my death. And ARK's a 75 player per world multiplayer game with more dino AI than fallout has baddies, as well as bigger bases to load, so I'm leaning towards something could be done if they tried?
---
Anything as simple as welcome mat affecting only host spawn points would do even if it's pushing aside the issue. It really feels bad that I have to fast travel to my base twice every time I want to use it cause the first travel is just getting the base to load so I don't mesh through the floor.
---
This post reminds me of when I nuked Foundation on day 1 of Wastelanders and then DCd
---
The dense torso mod doesn't make you completely immune to fire, just burning.  The shout is based on explosive damage I believe.  I just laugh at them because I run fireproof all the time.  Fireproof without dense mod makes you immune to scream, dense by itself seems to do nothing against it.
---
I agree, bethesda needs to add more for fallout 1st members! But junk yeah it is ∞ but stuff like weapons, aid, ammo .etc are a pain to store mass of them for future use or vendors. 
---
With world drops i am not 100% on it, but you can server hop
---
Elder Scrolls online has instruments as a looping emote, 76 could very well do the same!
---
"Im bored because I gave Bethesda 100 dollars so I could have my season pass rewards faster."
---
Hmmmm......
---
There is another mod which is asbestos lined which makes you completely immune to fire. It doesnt do anything about explosion damage. Sounds good in theory but not sure in practice if it's better than dense torso mod.
---
Well opinions are like assholes, everyone has one.
---
I dont know the exact numbers but on private server i checked like 10-12 pa spawns and nothing
---
Hmm I wonder if they are sending them in waves
---
Apart from any unlockable stash upgrade, one thing they should do is greatly reducing the weight of scrapped junk.
---
Since the broken economy of this game has many people trading for materials like lead and acid and flux, 1st players, who can hoard infinite flux with no weight worry and free that stash space for godrolls and legacies, will always be able to make the better offer against someone for whom every single flux piece occupies a whole pound of weight space. Plus if 1st people get scammed they might not even care since they can potentially have hundreds if not thousands of flux stored safely away, while for anyone else it'd be a bid deal to be scammed even of just 10 flux.
---
"Brave sir dweller ran away.... Bravely ran away away!"
---
Depends on the area you go to. The cranberry bog (bottom right) hat level 50+ no matter your level. The forest region is the lowest. Ash heap is second and I don't know the other ranks. So it depends on the area since it's online.
---
I hate any daily that takes me through additional loading screens, especially collecting those radio tunes for Wren in the prison. If I see that's the location I'm not doing it till on a different server with a better location
---
I have a couple of stupid things, nothing anyone would actually want.
---
Edit: to be clear, they are items I picked up, I’ve been playing since beta
---
I cant argue that man. Sounds like a good idea to me!
---
Sort of like rounds, and it spawns different enemies with increasing strength the longer you stay alone.
---
If higher level enemies are there it means a high level player was around and they spawned higher levels and yes in my experience the ppl on 76 are very generous. Especially to lower levels
---
just spend bullions to not be maxed and... wait for it ... redeem more treasury notes the next day
---
GASP! Waiting a full day! Oh Noes!
---
Edit:
---
You didn’t lose bullions because it’s not like you had 5200 and it lowered to 5000
---
You had XXX treasury notes and now you have XXX-20, hence: you lost treasury notes, not bullions. 
---
And now maybe stop being passive aggressive, you already admited in your OP that this is all your own fault for not being well informed and guess what: you got that one right
---
They are.
---
But it shouldn’t justify them giving a final warning for something I didn’t do.
---
Yeah but I dont dupe and play a lot of private server. So it's worth it to me. Plus, I dont mind earning my shit.
---
That’s good dmg thanks
---
"It's okay that me and my friends cheat because everyone is doing it"
---
Source? Cause based on nothing but observation it still *seems* true
---
Only thing worse than a cheater is a fink. You child, are a dirty fink. How does someone else duping change your game play? You probably stack in PvP because you're obviously garbage. Both in game and as a human being.
---
Yeah! Maybe you are right :)
---
Or a Ghoul comes spazing out like they do when they are running! Lmao!
---
I once used a magazine and hated myself for a week.
---
Vendors always had the issue with not being able to put much of bulk due to stash upgrades! FO1 does take the weight off peoples shoulders when it comes to scrap but i think it would be cool to sell your scrap in vendors via scrapboxes as that would help as well
---
And that's exactly what I'm doing 80% of my time. I couldnt agree with you more sir...
---
Its a pain to play alone
---
As far as I know it was lol, and I know what you mean about searching for answers and just finding Redditors speculating 😂😂😂
---
As someone else said,depends on the player.
---
Melee build - I really like my ghoul slayer FSS switchblade.  Just melts the mob at WS. 
---
Suppressors is useful against those PITA L68 supermutants with miniguns...
---
Sounds good to me, I'm all for it.
---
Lol, so you have no problem receiving duped items in trade? How's BGS' boot taste?
---
Imagine one shotting a queen buy having more scrap lol
---
Guild wars even let you play the instruments with a hot keys but there where no buffs but still.
---
The forest region is the first area right?
---
Well that's sad, I earned every one. Didnt spend a penny progressing through the road.
---
Shouldn't they scale to my level when I'm in the area ?
---
SS armor by a landslide
---
You'd be wrong, the description is inaccurate. It works any time you are on a team regardless of distance. It only checks if you're in a team, not where the other players are, nor how many of them.
---
As a result, it works as the lone member of a public team.
---
Yes it is the area surrounding vault 76.
---
You could even provide a better one like the improved repair kits vs the atomic basic ones.
---
100% worth it for a good few builds. Takes time to get it to its max potential (without god rolls) but it is definitely imo worth it.
---
....maybe.
---
Nothing to worry about in the grand scheme of things. Even if all 7k members responded
---
Innocent maybe, or minor offenders. They were after the big dupers first and I bet many of those who are being reinstated had only one or a very small number of suspicious items. For these a Final Warning may work.
---
SBQ: "I have a scorched army"
---
me: "i have aluminum."
---
Not a crazy amount, actually, don’t get me wrong, there are a ton of duper’s who weren’t banned but if someone’s account was “investigated” they either got perm banned, no further notification (as of yet) or a partial account wipe (level reset to 1 and all weapons and items that were assumed to be duped removed, making it almost impossible to progress to where you were since you can’t redo quests
---
The scrap market is very under used market, i wish i could go to someone’s vendor and buy a ton of lead or acid
---
There is that tiny little red ambiguous icon in the bottom right with the other active effects that seems to show up when your gun is close to breaking for what its worth
---
Secret service armor with the buttressed mod is the most powerful armor in the game. I feel it’s worth it to me, makes me a lot more tanky.
---
Great idea, but I always assumed adding lunchboxes into the Legendary Run was just them testing the waters before they add them to the Atom Shop when it's over. Figured it was just them lowering us another inch into the P2W boiling water bucket.
---
dude i am still laughing my ass of over this reply.
---
Well... It's bugged.
---
A tip for those that might not Know this.
---
If you are just about to launch a Nuke.
---
By Launch a Nuke,i mean you have literally just completed the  process,and,you are about to enter a Key Card and another player launches.
---
Dont waste your Nuke.
---
Go and do Scorched Earth event.
---
You can return to the Silo, and walk right through to the launch area and launch after you completed scorched Earth.
---
The version I run into has a minor case of serious brain damage. I caught him standing on a chair.
---
So the source I read seems to have been deleted so I guess I am somewhat wrong. What it sounds like is you can be on the roof of tents *if* she has room to land, so probably not near the fence or v9, if you want rooftops youll have to move out. Fences sound like a no go unless she's on the outside of v9. Her whole targeting thing works on if she can land, shooting her in the air does stagger her landing so basically
---
Empty spot, placement, and shoot when she lands? Idk downvote me for my stupidity
---
Kinda depends on your "must haves." If damage resist is it then yes but it does have diminished returns after anything above 450 I think. If you're set on the legendary effects of your current armor then get the plans and roll for the same thing until you get it.
---
Hey man, you could be right? Micro transactions are worth $1000s.
---
I too been playing since beta. I’ve played over 700 hours and I’m currently level 314.
---
Killing a queen with corks would be “balanced”
---
Yup. This is it. I replaced one of my pieces of armor that had that trait. I was not aware that the whole effectiveness of my build was on a broken mechanic. This sucks because I am at level 181 and the best legendaries I’ve gotten are shotguns. I log in almost every day doing scrips and grinding for gear and I can’t get a decent rifle to fit my build.
---
Perfect thank you so I take the the DMG resistance and all is higher then metal armour ???
---
I play, too! :)

Meanwhile my legit account that has paid for a year's worth of FO1st and has never duped anything or cheated in anyway is unplayable because it's somehow linked to someone else's steam account now and has been for 3 weeks.  
---
I can't get an answer on my ticket - I get one shot answers via text.  I loved this game but no way I'm tossing more time and money starting a new account with the possibility this could happen again.
---
Like rifts in diablo 3
---
Fuck em all. But upvote for your use of ill gotten.
---
Had the same experience. Told folks I saw the Wendigo, folks took off with me to kill it, everyone chatting... and then my client crashed :(
---
Good advice. How about more?
---
Don't use Bow Before Me, Tank Killer, Enforcer, Modern Renegade(lolol), or One Gun Army on the queen while she's airborne. If the queen(or any scorchbeast) is staggered in the air, she gets Insta-Dementia and forgets what she was previously planning to do. Like landing. Either don't use a weapon that works with those perks or swap your perks while she's airborne.
---
Shooting the queen while she's airborne is mostly only good to (try to) draw her aggro, and prevent her from getting generic(non-mutation) health recovery. Scorchedbeasts move pretty fast even when just flapping their wings, and can get out of the effective ranges of guns shockingly fast.
---
Even with the best crew that knows what they're doing, the fight is still subject to RNG(or bad AI). Queenie will still randomly piss off into the blast zone around Prime whenever she feels like it(even if there's nothing to draw her attention!) and she'll still randomly dive into the ground to headbutt a random power armored guy that's abiding by all the correct procedures. We can't control everything, but we can push the odds a little bit in our favor.
---
No, who am I kidding? The best thing to do is spam explosive shotguns with Enforcer, say it's how I feel like playing, and then complain about how hard it is!
---
I was hoping they would but sadly they don't, they have hazmat gear just like their leader. Smh
---
Jesus, they still haven’t helped you? That’s literally game breaking and it should be considered a security issue
---
I’ve been having similar issues on xbox, my internet is performing fine with no more latency and good connection, but in my first world I joined, the game glitched and something in my camp disappeared when I placed something down (but it acts like that item is still there so you can place anything in its place) then I got disconnected in 15 mins from the other one, and then the camp bug happened again, so I left and tried to rejoin and my game crashed. Seriously annoying, even when I’m not crashing im lagging
---
Best Queen Fight I ever had was a week ago. Watched the nuke drop and there was a ton of players there. First time she landed me and everyone else lit her up and she died in 10 seconds. It was great, no dying over and over to BS mobs, no respawning in the Nuke Zone and dying repeatedly, no wasting thousands of rounds on one legendary enemy that’ll drop POS 1* gear. Best queen fight ever, wish they all lasted a few seconds. I was able to loot her too somehow.
---
Usually what i do with enemy farming i jump on my private kill everything i need, then jump on public and do the same process and then go back to private as by the time i finished farming the server would of reset
---
What do you mean by diminished returns ???
---
Did you read the post?
---
Like... Beyond trying to be clever with the bullion to note ratio which was wrong on your end of calculations?
---
The point of the post was we didn't know what the cap of bullion you could hold was because there was  no explicit declaration of the limit and my cousin by this lost potential bullion because nothing gave warning to the limit and it took the notes regardless.
---
Of course you'd know that if you read the entire post, what I said is just a recap.
---
wanna hurt the duper, make him not be able to trade and everything he's drop get destroyed like the backpack, when he sells things goes to the Oblivion and won't appear on the vendor list, simple easy fix.
---
If your every kill is a max level deathclaw/sentry bot/behemoth, then I agree, you get max xp with every kill considering you run with 50 int and the most common %xp buffs + lunchboxes. Other than that you'll get less than 4k per mob most of the time.
---
I play bloodied/unyielding stealth flamer build, my int goes up to 73 in a full +int team. During the double xp with 100% lunchbox buff and cranberry relish I was getting 2600xp+ (which I guess is the highest you can get without having an infinite stock of leader bobbleheads and xp magazines) from a lvl 68 supermutant, and it's the most common high xp-yielding mob in the game.
---
Turn off pacafist?
---
It's most likely just a visual glitch
---
Yeah, without a doubt. I am around or over 400 in every resistance. Plus, it’s all legendary pieces. Since you have to craft it with legendary modules. So depending on your build/roll can be even better.
---
Every point into DR above 450 reduces less damage. So like up to 450 each point reduces 1 full point of damage (just an example), at 450 1 point of dr only reduces .75 damage. and as you go higher into dr, it drops even further
---
Yeah, I have the quest item that has never been removed. I have two, actually.
---
I'm going to enjoy it while it lasts.
---
I've also seen Ward sitting backwards through his chair lately.
---
Still people should scrip legendaries that have been duped (legacy weapons mostly )
---
They may be banned again during the next wave.
---
You wouldn’t see damage numbers with pacifist on, plus the game message saying you’re not doing damage because pacifist is on is a bit of a giveaway
---
I feel like it completely defeats the ban wave to begin with tho
---
How do you know the banned and reinstated users were investigated for 'literally the same offence'?. If someone dupes once and never sells the items is that really the same as one who makes multiple thousands of caps (or even real money) off each of potentially dozens of high value items? AFAIK Bethesda have never released the exact parameters for suspension, banning or warning. Feel free to clarify if you have this info otherwise its speculation.
---
I have 600 some odd hours with a 220, 125, 110, 89, and 7
---
Fuck em all, maybe? But that doesn't address the point. Bethesda basically has just said, well..we want a ton of those dupers back in the game. So you may have said fuck em all, but Bethesda obviously feels very different than you...
---
New player to 76, vet to Fallout. Needless to say, I don’t understand the nukes. I have some issues with what Bethesda did with this iteration, but I’m nonetheless hooked, and already a lvl 34 about 2 weeks in. The grind agitates the shit out of me. My weapons always suck, but I just discovered weapons don’t rank up with you, nor does armor....I’m a stoner so, a few things clicked slower than I like to admit.
---
because $$$ people wanna be paid for there music and Bethesda is already cheap as it is....OR THEY CAN PROVE US WRONG!!
---
Completely immune to fire sounds very helpful actually.  I'll have to check that out.
---
It was a lesson, whether or not it’ll be received and obeyed will determine whether or not there will be more mass ban waves. Tho I think letting duped items stay in inventories kinda defeats the purpose
---
I use exclusively ultracite gatling laser and railway rifles so I have truly unlimited ammo and sell my acid and lead whenever I want more caps.
---
They sell as soon as I can find them. If you're on pc, I can hook you up with some of them. I know I've got at least a few in my stash.
---
Watch angry turtles video on damage resistance
---
I dont have to worry about balancing multiple in game currencies, actual income from residuals, etc. So yes, I CAN say fuck em all.
---
If you’re the 1st person in the area yes but if someone else has been there before u they’ll stay that persons level
---
I’m crossing my fingers I don’t get hit again this weekend. I grinded way to hard during double xp to get ahead again. Hopefully this is your only instance of this bug.
---
DONT DO PHYSCO KIDS !
---
Thanks for the feedback! 
---
With Stranger in Numbers, Grounded ends up providing 125. Do you think it’s a fair trade off for the damage penalty?
---
I thought Herd Mentality only worked when near a teammate? If that’s not the case, will definitely be adding it. 
---
I do play on XB but I already have a set. We should play some time though 🙂
---
GT dadsdadsdads
---
Well, wait until they implement their legendary perk system where you'll need to be about level 1600 to max all 6 legendary perks you can swap in...
---
Every level up you can move a point or pick a specific perk. And a pack every 5.
---
You have MANY cards to get.
---
They've offered me a refund on the fo1st.. I want my account back lol... I want to play the game
---
You know what else we need? A quest for our DJ.
---
It would be awesome if we could all just whip out an instrument and have a Musical hoedown after killing the SBQ. They give us fireworks to Celebrate with but no one uses them, because we never know when we will get more? They won't just give us the planes to make our own.
---
I may be alone in this but I'd like it if they'd let me stop messing with score and just go back to earning atoms for dailies.  I couldn't care less about the rest of the stuff in the grind, I already got my sheepsquatch plushie.
---
I did 3 Nukes this afternoon with a few well armed, high level players on PS4.
---
We literally had to chase her round the Fissure site on Foot for all 3 to kill her.
---
tbh I actually quite enjoyed it.
---
When she lands she is usually obliterated.
---
I have seen her killed in under 60 seconds with my own Eyes.
---
was astonishing......didn't even get any loot from her.
---
Fair enough..
---
Just a thought but you right......
---
And if this suggestion were to be implemented, that could be different! Reducing its weight would also be a good point.
---
Yes Ill tittle it, Duchess shows me her enormous booty while crafting a plan speedrun. World Record sitting in 180 seconds, by Malborn the Rat King on twich.
---
That would be fun imo.  Another good batch of enemies would be between each wave, different type of enemies would make it a very interesting Defense.
---
I.E.: Wave 1 would be Scorched.  Wave 2, Super Mutants.  Et cetera, et cetera.
---
Wondering the same
---
There’s an interesting note from the POTUS about this in game. Won’t spoil it, but it’s there
---
It's almost like all sorts of people, FO1st members and non FO1st members, who duped were suspended and then reinstated. It's almost like the FO1st aspect has no correlation with what happened with this banwave...🤔
---
Haha I definitely dont share your opinion but I definitely enjoyed your comment lol. I appreciate your opinion bro.
---
i thought the pickaxe one was already a thing? but i like the others.

Nope. Bloodied improves all the way down below 20% though it's a case of diminishing returns.
---
I'm sure they'll see this and get right on it.
---
From the start they said the game is intended to be opened up long term. Some already have but there's a lot more boarded up, locked or unused locations that may well find a use in future dlc.
---
Yej
---
Nothing really unless you get a 3 star legendary that also comes with bloodied or junkie’s. I’d say you’re very lucky where you are
---
I’ll suggest keeping count of the ore and putting it all in last 20 secs or 10 secs it’ll make it easier and you’ll be able to kill ghouls and all the deathclaws and floaters still spawn at the end of you put it in last couple secs
---
You too :)

I'm with you on that.  Hate that invisible bastard.
---
I wouldn't read too much in to this.
---
She does some weird shit all the time.Glitches out and fly off in to the Sunset.
---
Personally i think the Devs have tweaked her AI a little bit.
---
So many players have god roll weaponry these days.
---
She lands she dies.
---
So be prepared to chase her around for a while inflicting damage, earning the right for her to land,and finish her off.
---
Blueprints count towards your budget? Shit I’ve got like 3 for taking workshops that I don’t really need! If they are weighted I’ll delete them so I can buy that raider collectron!
---
The definitely like the ideas, but I feel that the damage buffs would be more appealing for most, especially since so many people play bloodied, and thus stimpacks healing faster would likely be a hazard rather than a benefit.
---
If you want to stick with the tse heavy guns, I absolutely love the Gatling gun. It really shreds. Also, 5mm is just as easy to produce as .50 with super duper and ammosmith
---
Railway spikes are cheap to make as well! Lead is used for 5.56s and i sell them in bulk of 7k each
---
Using Rocket Launchers, Fat Man's and 40mm Grenade Launchers is mostly fine tbh, not amazing damage but decent. My problem is that they break so fast and that the Broadsider just flat out does not work.
---
If the durability was not so poor I would use them more. Even with 200% repair, it lasts no time at all.
---
I cant count the number of times I hve repaired collectrons, benches, walls, and roofs for people when visiting their camps. I did take a picture of repairing a collectron and getting stuck inside though.
---
Scout Leader has had multiple recent accusations.

Lvl 267 and I still don't have them all.

But I was testing a lot of builds as well, so... 🙄
---
Yep, the one that didn't auto complete for me was 10/15 feral ghouls!
---
Do you remember the last place you logged out from as well? Were you inside a building maybe (or somewhere that needed a loading screen to get into)? If it's not the buying things from the ATOM shop maybe it has something to do with logging out while inside an interior cell, then logging in again after reset? I got no idea :(

I completed it today and we only collected 25 Ore.

I think the amount of Ore collected reflects on the end game award.
---
There was only me level 370,and a Level 112..

My experience for this event is a fast Heavy weapon is a must ,Heavy gunner,Expert heavy Gunner,Master heavy Gunner Glow site,Expert Commando,Master commando.
---
Otherwise you get overwhelmed.

You had me at wendigo colossus event. I still haven’t seen a live one, and I’ve been playing for 2 months. 
---
Now I’m excited.
---
Doesn’t Project Paradise have a chance of spawning a level 100 Deathclaw?
---
Should I also add glitters on my Gatling laser?
---
Thanks. I was wonder how I got all those when I logged in fo my second match.
---
No I didn’t
---
Thanks, I spend a lot of time collecting teddy bears instead of killing super mutants so I have pretty low bar for entertainment.
---
The good rewards are almost impossible to get. We had all of the people alive and 100 ores collected
---
Ya, they probably would need to buff every faction in some weapon type to make them appealing or just scrap the damage idea altogether.
---
I noticed everytime i go in first game, i have to change back to the bog wanderer outfit again. I showed up in two games before realising I was wearing the vault 51 outfit instead of what I had chosen.
---
I wonder if the perk that lowers scrap weight affects the extractor too?
---
This is probably what expeditions or daily ops will be. Two things in the roadmap
---
...and this is Graftoooon's Mayor!!
---
O.O  psssst! O.O  do you want to buy some ammo at a cheap price? O.O
---
I tried one but it was to slow for what I liked...but I think thats because I am use to the 50 cal speed will try my luck with 1 again
---
You have access to any card you want to use or rank up now. Some cards were level locked before 50 because they’re too strong for early game. 
---
I am level 546 and  have every card but not every yard and every rank of that card. Some aren’t needed like you may not need to spend 15 points on gunsmith to have rank 1-5, just use the ones you want. Mainly saving level ups for switching points as needed.
---
If you are on xbox and want to try out different variations. I have a troubleshooters 50, a furious 50, and a Berserkers gatling gun you could borrow and see how they feel. 
---
Ill check if I still have my garling laser, but that is less likely.
---
I was looking at a bloodied build since that seams to be what everyone does...but the low health makes me nervous lol
---
Wait, I was wearing one piece with the blocking trait, and I wasn’t doing the damage when I wrote this post, but when I put back on the second piece that a replaced is when I started doing the damage again.
---
So I did some trial and error:
---
The piece I replaced with was 
---
Bolstering Urban Scout Left Leg
---
Bolstering
---
+1 luck
---
Reduces blocking damage

I am also wearing a:

Vanguard Forest Scout Right Peg

Vanguard

Reduces Blocking

With the first piece on, I do the better damage.
---
With the second piece on I do not.

How can meat be real if our eyes aren’t real?

---
So weird! I can’t say for 100% certain because my memory is terrible, but I almost always travel back to my camp before I log out so it is doubtful I logged out from an interior cell.
---
I am on xbox...ill hit you up when I can log on...maybe not be till around 11pm est
---
Math checks out.  /s
---
Wow looks like a green light for everyone to dupe then. No reason to hesitate when the next glitch shows up.
---
I mean it depends on what you mean by "better"
---
I have a special place in my heart for Furious FFR ultracite gatling laser because just by occupying the power stations for a few hours a week I literally never have to care about ammo ever again.
---
That said your weapon has a very good roll to it. Your options to replace it and feel like you got an upgrade in damage output are going to be a very short list.
---
Junkies, Two Shot, Bloodied, Furious with Explosive or Faster Fire Rate on any max-level heavy weapon will be the only way.
---
Furious has a ramp up time on damage so slow firing weapons aren't ideal for that. That ramp up is almost instant for Gatling Lasers and when you build for those they have incredible amounts of ammo. They suffer a little compared to the other heavy guns as maximizing the available ammo on hand from them steps on the toes of having the Nerd Rage perk. You also cannot get an explosive roll from Gatling Lasers without a legacy weapon, and even then you start running into the issue where you say "if only I could have 20 intellect for perks and not 15"
---
Perfect thank you
---
Yea...oh well at least I can clean up some inventory
---
accuracy on 2 shot weapons is lacking IMO... 
---
I would probably be looking at something like Furious if I was determined to run a gun like that
---
Again, I don’t know if it does or not I have not seen a specific data on who was specifically reinstated. All I did was share an opinion &amp; I understand your opinion on this subject as well. 
---
Thank you for taking the time &amp; sharing that you know of others who don’t have subscription had duped and were reinstated.
---
Im at GMT -7, so should be around 9 my time. No issyes there. Gt is narmyknight
---
It kinda does to some extent, but some people might've bought more accounts after that so it could've been some additional momentary profit for Beth. So it might serve a purpose nevertheless.
---
As cool as it would be to have races, I highly doubt they would be introduced in this game. I don’t really understand the terminator thing so if you could elaborate that’d be cool. 
---
The shield though doesn’t make much sense since most of not all backpacks show at least some ability to store items, while a shield is just... a shield.
---
I’d rather have weapons that aren’t backpack skins, but instead holstered weapons like in previous games (however, I’ll doubt this will come to fruition since a mod showed that the weapons will constantly clip through the character + will float. 
---
I’d rather keep the cross promotion to a minimum tbh but that’s just my opinion. So far they haven’t had any cross overs which I’m quite content with since it somewhat keeps the lore in check (aside from a couple of outfits).
---
My theory is that loads of dupers dropped dupes in loot bags for people to grab, and muddy the waters. The waters are sufficiently muddied at this point and they can't permaban folks that picked up crap items. But they got a spanking, and will be more leery in the future. Some dupers got the same.
---
The major and obvious dupers got a whipping.
---
It'll slow duping down for a bit, and it'll come back. And they'll do it again.
---
Today was the first day someo rando dropped a shit load of duped plans for me since the ban came down. Used to get that a lot. Feels, dirty.
---
150 atoms x 100 levels, so 15,000.
---
strawman, ineffective.
---
No reason not to dupe now, since Beth says it’s all fine.
---
Yeah, slower shots but way more damage. Plus there are mods that up the fire rate. I would definitely give it another shot.
---
Gt jconley123
---
Jesus 😂 thanks man
---
Me and Ward should be best mates by now.
---
Instead i am always greeted with " I have got my Eye on you".
---
All that medical equipment.And ward has nothing to cure his narcolepsy.
---
Without the first piece, I do 22 single damage to a super mutant with a headshot with an Anti-Armor combat shotgun.
---
With it, it appears to have multiple ticks over 200.
---
Should an anti-armor shotgun with 146 base damage do 22 damage to a Super mutant in the first place? That seems wrong.
---
I'd not take advantage of that, it's a known exploit/bug and abusing it could have consequences.
---
Added
---
They are used to craft certain weapons like the gauss shotgun, the gauss mini gun and the secret service armor
---
Lame as hell, you all ruined the game. It's  too bad they have to rely on duppers as their main player base. Fuck all of you
---
That it effects experience
---
Extra intelligence &amp; you get 2% xp per intelligence point
---
Haha, same.
---
Do you happen to have a source on that? The only info I can find says it doesn't. 🤷
---
Here's a pro tip about the torch in Skyrim: it's got a timer that counts down when equipped, and when you unequip it, the timer resets. One torch can last forever so long as you remember to periodically unequip and reequip it.
---
Glitch. You must have something that Ward needs already existing in your inventory that’s why it’s doing that. [not sure if you can actually drop it] cause it should be marked as a quest item.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
My son is probly on now. We share an account. Ill hit you up when I get home from work. Thanx
---
My copper extractor maxes at 9.
---
That's only if you don't do any of the work at all - just leveling up will earn you some points.  And honestly, a lot of the daily and weekly challenges will get completed as you play regularly, so you'll be progressing some as long as you're playing.
---
Now, if you want all the rewards without bothering to log in...then yeah, ~$150 to get them all (minus whatever bulk discount you get for buying atoms).
---
thanks.  but for me i didnt get the dailies almost ever so im just making up for their past glitches. if they ban me then I'll just get a different game.   not my fault if they cant get anything right almost ever 🤷‍♀️
---
I have no problem with VATS on my 50 cal bloodied Sniper Rifle.
---
I Hit 9 out of 10 Shots.That is pretty consistent with 95% .
---
When i use the Gauss Shotgun i can not hit something stood right in front of me.
---
Was the same when i was a Shotgun build,It was truly awful.
---
Me too (for you that is 😉).  Not gonna lie, I had twosies of a couple things... I still have twosies of a couple things.
---
I would agree with that. I have started to do burst fire instead of all out mag empty lol
---
Its common knowledge int affects xp gain (2%~ per point). Join a building team and once the bars fill you will see your int is higher. 
---
To test, just use one of the most common chems of the wastelands - mentats. Xp off a few mobs before and after taking the chem, and become a believer!
---
But more possible than if no ore is collected
---
oh wow, i just always assumed everything had a max at 14. 9's even worse!
---
Choose addictions that have a charisma withdrawal, there's a few. I believe junkies maxes out at 5 withdrawals? Pair it with whatever your main choice of regularly used chem is going to be (I usually use psychobuff just because I like the extra hp and carry weight) and you can get through it with minimal impact. Charisma doesn't do much.
---
and no, there isn't a perk that reduces the impact of withdrawals. Only increase duration, remove addiction chance, remove food/water cost.
---
if you have a full team of 4 its plus 4 intelligence  = 
---
8 percent more experience
---
...In their tongue, he is dovahkiin: Dragonborn!!!
---
Yeah but the problem is the time I don't have for upcoming 2 weeks.how long does it last?
---
Dunno.
---
You don't need a source when this can be easily tested by yourself and has been tested already.
---
- Kill something get X amount of experience
---
- Increase your Intelligence and kill that same type of enemy and level you just killed and you will see you gain more experience.
---
You can't "apply 3". They get used during crafting, specifically when crafting bullion items.
---
2 get used when crafting weapons, and 1 gets used when crafting armor. The number of stars you get is random.
---
Or too many lost 1st subs lmaooo
---
The ban wave was for doing the duping exploit, not for the item themselves. Since the ban wave is over, there wont be any more bans, unless you breach ToS again.
---
Is that a strength stat?  If so, my strength is only 1.
---
I was just observing if it is tied to camp budget or if it can increase with level up or something.
---
effects in your pipboy doesnt show everthing going on in the game
---
well when the quest finally started working for me a good month or more after wastelanders, it always says to return stolen equipment to ward.   i dont even know what equipment he means haha
---
You have access to any perk that exists now. You won't actually have them until you choose them, but there are no perk cards that require a level above 50 to choose the card for the first time.
---
The first is the "I'm overencumbered" noise, the second is the "I'm no longer overencumbered" noise.
---
They’re probably flying by the seat of their pants. They just need a new game engine so they can tackle these issues at the source instead of hot fixing it. Bethesda hasn’t been afraid of banning players in the past and the game pass gave them a lot of new money. Seems unlikely they’ve put any extra effort in tracking players but I’d imagine the “final warning” is serious. At this point, F76 is just to keep their earnings up while they work on Starfield and ES6
---
Well, somebody certainly seems salty.  If something like this is enabled, and you follow through with your stated actions, br prepared to be endlessly trollednin game by roving bands of minstrels.
---
I think it was 10 weeks total?  I'd have to check, it's mid-September some time before it ends, if they don't extend it.
---
They ruined your game by selling you an item you would be never able to get for a ridiculously low prices.
---
People be like: Ban dupeeeers, they ruin this game and ruin everything!!!!
---
The very same people in PM/discord/whisper - heyyy so do you have some extra legacies I could have? Im willing to pay 5k caps :'D
---
Love how any comment or post calling out duppers for being trash is being downvoted
---
 Says a lot about the fo76 community.
---
At 51 atm.
---
These posts are weird. There's a vibe about them. Someone please tell me they can feel it. 
---
The OP of these types of posts straight up just says for a fact that intelligence doesn't effect xp gain. But it does. simple testing can show this. But they always seem so sure.
---
I don't know. Spidey sense is tingling.
---
That sounds seriously plausible.
---
I have done Queens when she has been getting obliterated in the Sky.And the health seemingly is not moving.
---
Then a few seconds later she is literally dead.
---
maybe... not sure.  Ive had a max of 14 from under level 100, to now, which is level 220 - that hasnt changed its output
---
Absolutely!!!
---
2% xp per intelligence point, and you get that for doing literally everything that gains xp.  Unlock a door. Kill an enemy. Craft armor. Build a lamp. Complete an event.  Complete a quest. Complete a daily.  Everything.   
---
With 4 people that is an 8% xp boost.  It adds up and doesn't restrict you to just farming extra xp from completing events.
---
Perks don't effect anything in storage, that includes the extractors.
---
No need to check bro 👍 thanks for your help🙏☺️
---
whatever level you've got to for the score you've got
---
Honestly not sure why that happens. Look for items under MISC tap that might have a quest marker next to them &amp; you’ll find what it is most likely. Until then, enjoy the reputation and all that I guess 🙂
---
Oh perfect I was way off I had no idea
---
What were the other ways before? Wasn't it given to you if you kept killing people?
---
I am only level 40 right now and put in the extractor early in the game. Maybe when I was level 20.
---
Legendary Run Season 1 lasts for 10 Weeks and and Week 4 started on July 21.
---
watch angry turtles videos   if you google it you get info from 2018 and 2019
---
You come off as smug and condescending but also very idealistic and naive.
---
There is plenty of time, and this weekend there should be like double-score event? Remember, early ranks takes much less XP, I grinded and ended up at 82 rank and I need over 3200 Exp per level. It is "more worthy" to buy atoms before the season ends, because it is not worth to spend money on low level ranks.
---
A long lasting ban isn’t sustainable for the long run of the game. I only disagree with the weapons and items not being removed as the sellers and buyers that were previously removed in the ban wave have just been reallowed in without any major repercussions aside from missing a small amount of game time. They’ve simply undercutted their message by not removing the contraband
---
Ooh then I have 5 weeks left😊 that's great
---
Not sure what's up with your game, but the activate prompt goes away on ps4 when it's playing. It shows when repaired and not playing.
---
Sometimes there is a minor lag of a few seconds.
---
This is apples and oranges. Because a copper extractor only extracts *ore*, not copper scrap.
---
Lead and steel extractors will give you the scrap directly. It doesn't need to be smelted down.
---
Lol at the yeeted scorched at her feet “mom why have you forsaken meee”
---
Yes, by murdering players without dualing, breaking their base, and I think, fighting back against any player bounty hunters also makes your bounty higher?
---
72
---
Great advice 👍 then I'll try to reach 70-80 first then buy the rest if I don't have enough time
---
Was playing this game long before duppers screwed over legacies and have many myself from legitimate means. The fact they dupped and lowered the value of equips is part of what made me quit.
---
Hope yall stay banned, ya fucks!
---
Yeah but your initial message is just subverted by allowing this black market to exist again, I want more leniency than the mass ban wave but I also want what is done to be thorough which it currently isn’t
---
Do you think it's possible that someone else may have killed them? Or is that too far fetched for ya?
---
If it wasn't for you Guys i would never have launched 100 + Nukes.
---
Many thanks.
---
Exactly, it’s like the coast guard caught a boat loaded with drugs, detained the crew a few days and set them free, with all the drugs. Why the ‘ban wave’ drama to begin with lol
---
Todd bless the white springs parking lot and its abundance of nuclear fireworks
---
When I jumped on earlier to do my dailys the server at Whitesprings was full of them. Was even able to complete my 3 Legendary enemies while I was there.
---
Okay, thanks for the tip!
---
I don’t even think they investigated most of them
---
They realised they were losing $1000s and  gave themselves more work than the 1 or 2 people they employ to deal with customer service and accounts could handle and just decided to send a mass email.
---
Nice! :)
---
Definitely couldn’t be that 😂😂😂
---
I had a bloodied broadsider... And since I'm a heavy weapons build+bloodied. I had it doing 3465 damage per shot, combine that with the mutishot canister I was killing lvl 60+ SB's with less the one clip... however the ammo weighed so much that I couldn't move fast at all.
---
5 string. :)
---
I walked through Morgantown where the back on the beat event usually is, a bunch of low level feral ghouls around
---
Always has been.
---
I've always thought that all circular camp pieces would be a better fit that squaring the space. Thoughts?
---
Ah. Makes sense. But do the limits always stay the same?
---
Go to harpers ferry burrows instead. It's less popular and more likely for you to get 15 in one go.
---
I had this happen to me a couple days ago. But I just kept attacking and eventually they got rekt. Lol just had to keep popping in and out of VATS.
---
Yes you do.
---
Thats why i leave it to the experts.
---
That feeling when you do a Nuke run,enter the Key Card,and put in the wrong code,is like losing your wallet,that bad.
---
I think it's fine. It's a lot better with inaccessible locations than Fallout 3 was
---
If you don't run junkies or bloodied, anti armor or furious would probably get you a solid damage output with much more accuracy and less weapon degradation.
---
I use the AA/FFR .50 cal you get from completing Beckett's quest (final word) and it shreds
---
Probably a bit of both. I think it’s more than Bethesda just got into game pass and needs the next gen of spenders to get their lvl up before Bethesda starts making any major bans as to not scare ppl away. I don’t think they were worried about the FO1st as much as just the large drop in high lvl players. The next offense will most likely be taken seriously for those who abused the system.
---
no problem.. 
---
I figured the only reason it matters is that its difficult to scroll through the list for it and people sometimes overlook the sorting option...
---
How dare you present logic into the equation
---
I will add that I have a guass mini gun but that thing is such an ammo pig that I only bring it out for SBQ fights since its rolled at hunters ffr
---
Exactly, 5 spikes for 7 steel. That's it. It is extremely efficient but if you're not using FO1 it does get a little weird for a bit to train yourself to actually pick up all the steel you find, especially if you trained yourself not to because "the hell do I use steel for and why do I have 300 lbs of steel scrap?"
---
You'll also find spikes on the corpses of enemies frequently. If you use a two-shot railway, you'll find (shocking I know) approximately twice as many of them. The only real downside to a railway is that you NEED bandolier perk or ammo weight on all gear as the ammo is extremely heavy otherwise. Railway also has extremely high damage per shot compared to most other rifles (iirc higher than all except Gauss). The gun also breaks pretty quickly (or at least I think it's quick, it's been a long time since I've used any other rifle) but is similarly super cheap to repair. It's an extremely efficient weapon.
---
Fun related note on railway, I dunno if it's just an xbox or latency thing but if you use the automatic receiver for railway and feather your trigger you can easily get off about 30 shots from a 10 shot magazine. It frequently partially refills itself, and is often worth cancelling your reload animation with a bash just to keep firing. The only downside is unless you're using a VATS build the weapon becomes basically unusable due to extreme recoil.
---
Gatling lasers are effectively free, by using the power station workshops. If you have a long game session take all three and do the powering up X quest; Once completed you rig them to the power node and they will stay powered forever, even if the "powering up X" quest comes back.
---
Anytime you're fast traveling a substantial distance, pop in through each of them for 9 power cores. They cap out at 3 held in the generator but will make far more than that per hour, and there is no way you will spend that many in that time. If you plan on sitting there for 6 hours or so playing you can easily rake in 30+ cores above what you spent during the session by just remembering to visit.

And every 5-10 ish waves a garunteed boss mob spawns that is 3 stars.

It's always 3-4 guys with marsupial and a Chinese stealth suit, just sat on the fence like a pack of birds on a telephone poles wiring. If not that, a crowd of guys using 1-man army and stun locking the queen mid landing, so she fly's around for another 5 minutes while she shits and screams in our faces.
---
Weird, mine won't go past 1 damage, dispite the high promised damage. Am using a bloodied heavy gunner too.
---
Ah ok. Thanks so the weapon damage calculator is off.
---
Bethesda has done a good job at pushing out the toxic community the only ones left are the guys who take workshops so they can initiate pvp without you fighting back.

How can you tell which quests are for which faction?

What's the benefits of doing the dailies? (Besides the ally dailies) I did them one during beta and never did them again.  Their rewards weren't special.
---
E: not trying to be rude, just wondering if I'm missing out on anything
---
If they dont have serendipity then thats their fault. It doesnt stack and there really arent any perks that do much when shared. I like sharing strange in numbers to make the marsupial mutation glitch out allowing you to run in the air briefly after jumping.

A fully modded weapon might give a good amount of material if you scrap it. It's would be like buying 20 steel, 2 gears, 1 spring and 2 wood for 20 caps.
---
all good suggestions so far. Patience young padawan
---
Heresy!!!!!!
---
I think we may have uncovered the culprit my good man. I guarantee it at the very least plays a part in it
---
Radiation rumble
---
Think it's a sign that it may be time to move on
---
Yup... I've missed entire clips, a lot of clips....
---
Because I find it funny that the majority of players that seek "justice" are people who beg for cheap or free legacies, including beggars from youtube.
---
"UhHH yeah, I got this super expensive legacy the legit way because I bought it for 5k caps so you should scrip your weapons and get banned right now!!!! " or "MY FRIEND GIFTED ME SO IT IS LEGIT!!!" :'D :'D
---
Well, stop being anti mask and it won't be a problem. You can't stick your fingers in your ears forever, bro.

Commando: fixer or handmade

Rifleman: Probably the lever

It does work on them, I'm carrying about 250 Ultracite Plasma and about 50 Ultracite fusion cores with me at all times and they weigh 0.1 and 0.3 each.
---
Kinda wish that the missiles would at least send enemies flying ragdoll-style, forcing them into their rising-up animation and giving you time to switch weapons and attack.  Kinda like Unrelenting Force in Skyrim.
---
You still only get to shoot 10-12 times before it breaks though....
---
Ah well the only other thing that comes to mind is that I hardly ever use my private world and I logged out for the night from it.
---
Hopefully someone works it out and it gets fixed :(
---
I’ve also played a lot of ark and I’ve had more issues falling through the map or objects on that game that fallout 76 and I’m lvl 410 with 1500 hours. I’ve had it happen on gta V and destiny more often than 76 as well..I mean lots of games have those problems and I’m sure it’s different for other people like yourself, but I’m just saying that it takes a bit more patience than most games especially singleplayer ones. It’s probably because the fallout engine was designed for singleplayer and they had to adapt it to an mmo style game which obviously didn’t go smoothly at first but they’ve been improving it slowly.
---
Thanks ill definitely look for the charisma ones then
---
I was about to log out last night and got the nuke warning. I suited up and headed to the blast zone with about 8 other players. SBQ spawned and some dude took her down in like 5 seconds.
---
They were marginally usable but then bethesda nerfed them along with the TSE shotguns for some reason....
---
Hehe but, but, but, my legacy was purchased for less than 5k caps because it wasn't a legacy when i got it and was considered a pretty trash weapon at a time before scrip was a thing xD
---
Everyone was at the white spring. I waited for One Violent Night to pop up.
---
Hahahahaha
---

---
if your not this level you most likely will not finish
---
Nah. You'd be screwing over people without Fallout 1st.
---
Just make gunpowder weigh 0 lbs.
---
I like Hunting/Sniper rifles, Levers, Handmades and Fixers for all my Rifleman and or Commando needs..
---
also.. i avoid 2 shot weapons.. the accuracy is ass...
---
You don't need a friend or private server with the new public teams update. Just join a public team (Preferably with a full team). Put the item in a chest or storage container somewhere. I usually do it near a train station. Alt tab out, open task manager and force close fallout 76. when you boot the game back up you'll still be in the public team in the same server, all you need to do is select your other character.  The only issue with this method is that there is a kick button. So I'll usually stick around for a minute or 2 to make sure they're not going to kick and then switch characters. I haven't ever been kicked from a public team so it's unlikely for it to happen.
---
It happens, at least the bugs are more limited in NW. At least on consoles.
---
Almost every time a low level shows up at my camp I give them some stuff
---
I'd be down for one and one honestly.

Highest damage I've seen was a bloodied explosive Dragon but those are rare
---
Next is a bloodied gauss. 
---
People have been using handmade and fixers as the go tos for dps. Haven't seen max damage on a lever action but heard it's good for slower combat situations. 
---
Hunting rifle is a decent one as well and one I used for a bit before switching to gauss rifle.
---
I'm sure there's someone out there that can give you more insights and stuff
---
Agreed
---
I don't have the explosive perks levelled on the character yet, so maybe that's making the difference.
---
Just went to whitespring and killed about 30... prob just an issue with your server
---
I've had a few times where enemies and containers both seem to not have anything(like my purifiers). I usually "look away" for second or two and then look back. Sometimes it works
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
Uhhhh, so is stable flux. Which is “junk.” Sorry to debunk your comment.
---
Riding shotgun always has 1 guaranteed legendary and possibly up to 4 or 5 more throughout the course of the run. It was the first event I did today and I got my 3 legendaries in there.   
---
\*EDIT\* Bonus with riding shotgun is, it takes about 10 mins to complete, maybe a bit less if you know where everything is and you can server hop to start the event again, as it is started by the user and not random.
---
Most online games have my quests ready to display the moment I'm in.  This isn't new territory.
---
I suspect issues like this stem more from using an engine that was not built with any regard for the architecture required for an online game.  There are different architectural concerns, and it's not something that can just be hacked in after the fact.
---
Might be though I wouldn't know... I'm not to much into builds.
---
I miss the scary phasing ghoul reavers from Fallout 3. Those could be the bathroom ghouls.
---
Maybe a deathclaw boss like in NV but they don’t all have to be boss tier. They just need an armor buff
---
If you are high enough level, the whitespring cottage and laundry loop usually has 3.  No event necessary.
---
bonus. The full loop puts you close to the 10k xp bonus
---
As someone who has never shared a card, today I learned about sharing cards.
---
Not sure how I missed it all this time.
---
You have no charisma perks at all? Or does everyone put three into inspirational and share something else rank 1?
---
I’m generous I guess. I share strength in numbers or one rank of inspirational? 
---
If everyone shared rank 1,2, or 3 of inspirational wouldn’t there be a net higher gain of exp?
---
Isnt that some bug with your Fallout76ini files? I remember transferring some folders and when I started the game it did not want me to log through steam, but through client (big mess).
---
Try to delete Fallout76.ini and Prefs and try to run the game. If it wont help try to complete reinstall the game.
---
I like my two shot fatman, too bad it breaks after 6 shots.
---
Have you gotten any of the silo pieces? I’m launching one out of bravo in about an hour
---
Yes
---
Tried it, but didn´t work. I'm using a  Genius HS-G500V Vibration Gaming Headset. I can hear everything right, I can "see" that my teammates are talking to each other (the 'trumpets' near their names) but I can't hear them at all. If I try hear PCs on the same are I can't hear everything but not the voice chat.
---
Every time i go.everytime.
---
Yeppers
---
They need to remove player trading as punishment.
---
For Bethesda using a singleplayer fallout engine for an mmo style game, it is, that’s part of my point. Zenimax is different because they used an engine designed for an mmo and they made an entirely new game designed for that engine. Fallout 76 is essentially fallout 4s engine but is almost an mmo which fallout 4 was never designed to be nor was that game engine.
---
Or join an SBQ event and tag everything that pops up
---
cache in the airport terminal
---
Bethesda made Deathclaws more of a joke with every game!
---
Tried it again after reading your reply (thank you by the way), even minimizing all the rest (except master, of course) doesn't have any effect.
---
You can get a lesser one from Morgantown airport
---
Well said
---
What’s the carry weight? It’s Probably the small backpack from the MoTown Airport
---
Until you find those few jerk players who only play nowadays to trap and kill people In their camp, and then rotate servers once they've tricked everyone in the current server
---
Charleston capital building is always full of high level ghouls, if that's what you want.
---
If you want low level ghouls instead, try Morgantown (not the airport though, that has scorched).
---
How long does this event go for? I stay at a hotel for work all week then come home for a day and a half so never set up my playstation except Monday morning when we get back from our first night shift
---
They are, more people should be doing them
---
Oh of course what was I thinking- puppies! In unrelated news, would anyone like to help me steal 20 illegal pugs?
---
I don't remember one shotting them so easily in New Vegas!
---
Lever does nothing like the damage the gauss does, i can craft them
---
Sure you did, buddy
---
Things that cannot be unseen
---
That post should be pinned, honestly.
---
I just started using an instigating level action with +% dmg for aiming.  Built it for every hip fire perk and it’s really fun to use.  Before I’d mix it with Fixer and Handmades.   I’d say all 3 are good depending on your builds 
---
The bolt reload on the hunting rifle is just too slow for end game imo so I avoid it - even though I have an explosive anti armor mutant one in my inventory.  Still doesn’t feel very effective
---
bloodied gauss, yeh might be the go
---
How can you build it that big? I always run out of budget, is there a way to get more budget?
---
*Rainbow six siege April fools day flashbacks*
---
Exactly.
---
My opinion is that they started from a flawed premise, that they could retrofit their single player engine to work for a multiplayer game where integrity of the gameplay and the data was important.
---
The result is they'll be forever patching individual holes as they're found, but never able to resolve the underlying issues.  Initial architecture matters.
---
I personally know people who duped dozens of legacies, got banned specifically for Duping, had their account reinstated, and still have their duped loot. The initial ban email from Bethesda states the reason as "item duplication", and the "final warning" reinstated email also states for item duplication. Good question though. I can provide proof and screenshots, it's not speculation.
---
There's something to be said about building your character around doing something really well. 
---
I can easily hit over 3k on a headshot after a mob or two
---
I don't have a build that can collect the ore, or use power armour. I do like joining to be on defense though. Would be nice to pass it once sometime :(
---
Deathclaws give 4K xp each for me if you gather enough ores to spawn them. That’s why I use a Enforcer shotgun to cripple/tag ghouls and rush ores before someone else finishes them. Then you get to spawn crazy high xp enemies. Floaters I think gives around 2-3k still higher than ghouls.
---
Beth’s message is clear, duping and duped goods are fine.
---
exactly why i’m asking as for my gauss i’ve yet to find anything that can top it
---
Sometimes normal squishy organic enemies start beeping too, the game thinking that they're a legendary robot.
---
What do you play on? I’m on xbox if you wanna play
---
My dad is a wicked banjo player. He played bluegrass. My brother plays 4 string. My brother and I had a band playing country and Irish music.
---
Buffout, psycho and mentats are pretty safe. Have a look here: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi6zPX-4eTqAhWFLn0KHZXqBKQQFjAAegQICxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw2f8DyRHb4FJZluh7v29vcd
---
Basically if you are rifleman you probably use vats, so agi and perception can't be touched because they affect AP and accuracy in vats.
---
Strength doesn't affect you apart from carry weight, endurance for a bit of hp, and neither does charisma. Int you need for xp. You might want luck for vats crits.
---
This isnt the first this has happened and bethesda didnt do anything about it then, so why would they now?
---
I play on ps4 :(
---
Making ammo is really for low level players anyway. I just buy 10k ammo whenever I’m max caps. Probably sitting on 250k 5.56 and 100k 45.
---
It shouldn’t make you nervous. Adrenal reaction, nerd rage, and emergency protocols on PA make you pretty resistant. Poison is a real pain though.
---
Many don't care about the rewards they are just there to farm the enemies. I've yet to even complete the event because everytime I go to it people just kill the enemies and not even care for the npcs. Heck a couple times people have showed up and lured enemies to the npcs causing them to die faster.
---
Clearly the servers I join are doing something wrong. I’ve never even seen that event before :(
---
It’s better than kill a sloth in the cranberry bog.  Or those wretched crickets in uncanny divide.  Or forgetting to equip sunglasses, a suit and using chems while leveling up ect.
---
As a bloodied melee build, you will fear nothing but Ghouls!
---
Don't be so dramatic 😂
---
Join us 😈
---
Once you know the shortcuts and the optimal path, they are pretty straightforward. With a solid set of Troubleshooter’s gear they are almost a walk in the park.
---
&gt; A seated super mutant would also be acceptable.
---
It'd be Grahm. "THINGS FOR SALE!"
---
As others have said, Leader of the Pack is designed for brand new players fresh out of the vault (but of course, anyone can do it if they want), so nobody has any excuse not to complete this challenge.
---
I’m always on the ground with All Rise ready to take a whack at her but she just doesn’t ever want to land
---
Doesn't hurt to try it out
---
I never noticed if this is a thing or not.
---
More people in the silo=more robots. With a sneak armor piece or perk it’s easy to buzz through it. Idk if it’s still possible to PA glitch through that one spot.
---
I always brawl that one naked with bare fists!
---
Lol!
---
Look for blood eagle camps, almost always 3 of them are legendary at different places on the map..
---
Omg every since fallout 3 I can count on one hand how many things are the bathroom stalls....as far as enemies go...bathroom stalls are fucking underutilized in the fallout world everything bad hides in a bathroom stall.
---
Yeah it is the small backpack. I guess that is where I got it from, but I looked in one of the pioneer scouts vending machines and I already have 500 badges and i’ve only completed 1 part of the quest.
---
Lmao
---
I agree. We use the chemistry bench to make the raw fertilizer junk item. Why not gunpowder as well? Fertilizer is a very similar item in that it's a finished, crafted item that can't be scrapped down into other components as far as I know. And it's a crafting input. If the item can't be scrapped and it's a crafting input, it belongs in the scrap box. And that means that it should be junk.
---
Maybe it’s time. 3100 hours in. Never launched a nuke.😮
---
Hmmm I use aligned on my Gauss for superior hip fire accuracy on every mod, and I still get that hit rate?  So what else impacts hip fire?
---
How many were ‘perma’ banned? All the ebay sellers are still there and new ones are popping up, so i guess the number is smaller than five?
---
I've seen it multiple times a day, except today I've yet to see it or Uranium Fever.
---
Spoiled kids are happy that their toys come back to them and the sad truth is more than half of this sub belong into that group. I guess it is time to move on from this shit game if this is Bethesda's response.
---
I have all of them bloodied and with all the various effects.  Gauss is terrible.  yes you can put up some high numbers, but Lever is the most versatile tbh.
---
That’s exactly what I thought.  Had to click on the picture and zoom in to make sure I wasn’t seeing what I thought I was seeing....
---
Yeah, you could even theme it.
---
Scorched waves should spawn different scorched creatures like scorched bears or deathclaws. Final boss is obviously a scorched beast. 
---
Super mutants could have different FEV mobs like the floaters or snalleygasters. Finally colossus could be final boss for Super mutant.
---
Yeah I get impatient with the gauss rifle.  I don’t go commando, either.  So my stealth build is using the best semi auto perks (.45 and 5.56 ammo) and busting out a shotgun for close range.  Use a perk load out for heavy guns during SBQ.  So kind of a hybrid 
---
I’d say whatever feels “best” just go for it.  Most of these suggestions are really dependent on your special load out, perks and the RNG from legendary items
---
You never had to open a pack. You now have access to every perk card when you level up though. You don’t have every card in your “deck” currently though.
---
No thanks. I’d rather just use a skin than grind out a new weapon. Also, is your post supposed to be funny or something? It’s pure cringe tbh
---
Ive only ever known a limit of 14 for lead
---
What happens if you nuke the event while it’s active and people are participating? 
---
I understand that people in the blast would die. But does it auto end the event because the Queen gets burnt to a crisp too?
---
I've come to just accept it as part of the game. Its only purpose now is I know if the loading screen stays black a bit longer and doesn't play the encumbered sound, it's about to crash
---
The bunker there also stops her from landing, and while it's important people bring tents for their respawn point... They do need to get off the damned things!
---
What if you make a very large dome?
---
There are some perks for pistols and automatics but outside that just weapons mods.
---
I agree with you on this completely, it’s why bugs keep resurfacing after they patch out others. It is in a much better spot than launch but it will never be close to perfect, which is why if you want to enjoy this game it takes a lot of patience imo. My original point was just that because it’s designed this way, and not very optimized, everything takes a while to load so if you just sit for a minute or two everything should load fine. It just takes patience which I can understand the frustration lol.
---
You're not the first to suggest that here. Honestly I'm surprised that this isn't one of the things on the Bethesda Plz page
---
Bold statement
---
got the correct 9 now, though the others were completed. I think i got the score though!
---
I think they fixed that. You gotta get the card now, but that only takes about 2 minutes at most.
---
There's lots of guides out there, especially on youtube you can find some good ones.  I have gtx 970, and my monitor has a 74hz refresh rate, best thing I was able to do is cap fps at 74 run in fullscreen mode and turn off vsync.
---
Why does that sound familiar? Oh wait...
---
https://youtu.be/TJf76Oz0BLs
---
Definitely do it, I got some good rewards just from launching it. Plus if you do fissure prime you get SBQ
---
Wut
---
Yeah this is super disappointing. They were going so well for a week, it seemed like they were finally stepping up...and now jk lol everybody gets unbanned. Most of them aren't even getting account or inventory wipes, just a "final warning". False alarm guys, cheating is still allowed with no consequences in this game
---
3 months later
---
Bethesda "We listened to the community and now we're replacing square walls with circular walls in building sets"
---
Where are you finding level 50+ enemies near the vault? The forest had a level cap. You should never see an enemy over like like 20 there.
---
I see both of those events quite a bit and I only play about an hr a day lol
---
False, you still need a large flat area for her to land properly, if you're ontop of V9, the fence or a tent, and you're the target? She won't land! The best place to fight her is the nearby field!
---
I’m having a hard time understanding what I’m looking at here. I’m illiterate.
---
They kinda are with the toon locked gear in wastelanders.  I expect that to be status quo moving forward with the brotherhood quests.
---
If it was a scare tactic, they would have left the accounts on suspension. This is literally just a glaring signal that all will be forgiven and they can cheat again
---
I’ve killed the queen hundreds of times. I just wait till I see someone has already nuked it.
---
Charlston capital is The way to go. Bunch of ghouls and no almost no players go there!
---
Without 1st it'd still be easier to manage as checking misc is often neglected by many
---
Exactly the same for me (except I crashed instead of taking forever to load in).
---
Right, there’s just much less room, it’s not the location of the building, it’s the pathing from not standing on the ground.  I always bring my tent but try to put it in a place no one wants to be.
---
Loyalty... does anybody in this goddamn place understand the concept?!
---
Secret Service Armor is without a doubt, the most powerful set of Armor.
---
They're automated replies, but there are multiple ones depending on what is going on. The ones last week were all permabans, seems like all the ones being sent out now are unbanned with no punishment. A few days ago there were some unbanned but inventory/account got wiped emails being sent out
---
Lots of variables to consider here.  First would be what are your PC specs. 
---
Do you use mods?
---
Have you edited any config files?
---
Yea just unbelievable, set the drug smugglers free - with all drugs intact. Good job Beth now we know what to do.
---
Is it a bug or a feature?
---
Bethesda: "Yes"
---
I too enjoy the legendary run but find it hard to level up very quickly unless it’s a double XP scenario
---
Dont worry machine gun go brrrrrr
---
I don't mind the mini nukes but goddamn do I agree with the missiles my ammo converter practically runs on them alone
---
In the Morgan town airport terminal there is a cache. And in the cache is a small backpack plan.
---
Wrong... I don't even know where to start on this.. First off, most of the eBay sellers(and ones on Gameflip) are smart enough to use a "burner" account for duping, then transfer the loot they get to another burner account for storage and one for selling. The smart/big sellers also use VPN/2nd Xboxes as well. So banning most of these accounts doesn't even really affect them. 
---
In regards to the "5" people perma banned, that's way off, there are literally hundreds of people just in certain Facebook groups alone crying about their perma ban emails. This ban wave went far and wide, and based on ticket numbers and dates, upwards of 8k players were banned(not all perma though).
---
Exactly bring your tent, keep it sprinting distance, but not close enough for people to camp on!
---
I don’t understand what these god damn symbols mean and it’s making me scared and angry.
---
Not true, stop spreading this bs
---
Honestly, duping is really not the biggest problem here, at the very worse, those items are intended to be in game and therefore, "balanced". The biggest problem is those hacked items. If you are on PC, you will know what I am talking about. Have you heard about unyielding power armor set or minigun that shoots nukes? Those are the real game breaking shit. Developer should run some kind of programs to remove them. It is a problem and truly breaks the game when I cannot do enough damage using BE guns for the queen to drop stuff when someone just kills the queen within a few seconds (on air)
---
People have no chance of getting those stuff other than doing trades or get lucky when they were dropping those items like garbage.
---
Yeah that’s the weird thing, if I run around for a few minutes sometimes it’ll show up.
---
They do, they've said they constantly tweak her behavior
---
Did uranium fever today.
---
I'm feeling good as I recently dumped all my extra meds and ammo to a mule so I have 200 pounds of carry space.
---
The 2 dead miners always in front had a missile launcher and 3 missiles each.
---
It took all 6 missiles to kill the 2 mole miners in the little room past the event room 
---
What a joke
---
That does happen, a magic weapon, I had a few bad ones where I just couldn't get the damage in before the queen died, but does seem to be in the minority of nukes.
---
You're not looking in the right place, most likely. It appears up by the Tyler county fairgrounds, north of the vault. It's not a (!) event though, so there's no notification for it.
---
I haven't paid attention to how often it procs, but it seems to be about every hour or so.
---
I like this and I have an idea about it.
---
The motherlodes tunnels underneath Appalachia. Make them a dungeon
---
Same, almost 3500 hours on two accounts, never launched a nuke, killed the Queen hundreds of times.  I will eventually, just having fun in game still. 👍
---
500 is the number of badges that the vending machine carries I believe. If you look on the menu to the left when you enter the machine it’ll show you how many badges you have at the bottom.
---
Somewhere between 1 and 100
---
Yep. And the funny thing is, they may have wiped a handful of accounts, but it ultimately doesn't matter. A series of quotes taken straight from one of the cheat tutorial youtubers' discord servers: "A moment for them fallen ones" "they shall be remembered" "and restocked when they return"
---
The devs and data miners have shown the scaling buff to be false
---
And Bethesda is insistent in not doing anything at all to help us, keep up the good work spreading the word!
---
worked about ten times for me
---
There are only a few quest for the factions that I know of and you get them from the crater, foundation, or overseers house. All the other daily’s are for random things or pioneer scouts or biv
---
Bad choice on Beth's part, maybe they will redesignate flux to aid or something. They have moved the insect parts 🤞
---
Everything is getting a bit old cus there is no end game.  Score, scrip and bullion are not endgame. They should be background to actual content. A post apocalyptic wasteland full of treasure items? No actual substance or place. No function or life. Just a big empty search for the next slot pull. It’s all old. It’s a 60 dollar mobile game with the same depth as fallout shelter.
---
Their game, their rules.  They can act, or not, as they see fit.
---
If you break the rules, then can end your account.  Or, something less.  Or nothing.  It's up to them.  "You didn't suspend Johnny, so you can't suspend me!" isn't in the ToS anywhere, so I wouldn't rely on it.
---
I have used a quad missile launcher doing 500 plus damage to greed effect if used as artillery instead of a direct fire weapon. Same with the fat man. Tho I agree that the weight issue is insane. Tho i also believe limiting the stash is dumb also. In a reality you would have virtually endless storage ability of you also have access to all the crap we do in the game.
---
I just made a light combat armor and put all 5 of the mods on it one after the other
---
Yep I looked at it wrong lol
---
there are magic prefixes in the game, legendary effects that are bugged to make them more powerful on some weapons, fast firing guns and shotguns benefit the most from them
---
Because Bethesda customer support is fielding thousands and thousands of requests and they are located all over the united states and its impossible for them to be consistent. 
---
Its not like there is one giant campus building college style called "customer service" and all the reps are sitting in one giant cubicle farm together and all final ban decisions are rolling through the same middle manager. 
---
Its kind of like how when you call your banks customer service sometimes you get a careless twit who couldn't care less about their job and sometimes you get an angel that saves your day. Same thing.
---
That being said, if it was me I would have permabanned [all you smoothbrain duping fuckos](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hwr1de/players_on_final_warning_after_duping_declare/fz1cuvz/). But thats just me.
---
Queen killers propaganda
---
They haven’t said anything to indicate that more storage is coming. Now that it’s been monetized, I find it highly unlikely.
---
If they are, it hasn't been announced. If you want to hop back into the game, you almost have to have a Buddhist mindset and let go of everything you don't need
---
This is what I use, with a Furious Ultracite Gatling Laser
---

---
I use the extra experience card because of the legendary run and using experience to get SCORE on that. If I didn't care about that I'd move those points else, probably to get something else depending on what my goal was. Traveling pharmacy or Bear arms for more carry weight, Blocker or Richochet for more survival, third rank of luck of the draw and travel agent and one point in nerd rage for more general use. (would lose the ability to share a rank 3 doing this)  Glow sight is replaced by green thumb anytime I feel like gathering plants.
---
I put emergency protocols on the armor and just let the agility perk keep me alive. Almost never need to use a stimpack manually - mostly tied to poison damage taken like from a mirelurk queen or a bloodbug horde. Realistically only carry about 30 stimpacks around and it only starts to get weird doing SBQ if it takes 20+mins and I revive a bunch of people.
---
Note the mutations. Always be in a public team, doesn't really matter if you're the only one. I'd trade strange in numbers for travel agent if alone.
---
All the general mobs get mowed down quick enough that the most dangerous things seem to be a 4-5+ of colonel gutsy or as mentioned poison damage. I'm not even sure Fireproof is worth it, I took it off yesterday for chem fiend and am deciding if I miss it. With fireproof on scorchbeast screeches and exploding cars/bots dont even move my healthbar enough to tell I got hit.  I wear T-51b on all slots except helm, where I wear X-01 because I wanted a bright headlamp. 602 damage resist with strange in numbers is pretty heinous.
---
I like the fissure site oriented to the south approach, I put my tent by the sundew grove and people can’t even see it
---
They scale when they spawn. If you aren't the character that the game spawned them for then they won't be scaled to you.
---
Thanks, Satan!
---
The grove can be hard on the system, my old gtx 750ti struggles with areas with intense effects, I have the fans ramped up to 100% constantly while playing with MSI Afterburner, does help.
---
Unfortunately that's not true.
---
The black market will exist until Beth fixes their game (and that won't happen anytime soon at the current pace).
---
Many people exploit the game since many of its mechanics just do not make it enjoyable enough. Lots of people cheating is just a symptom of a system's disease, it won't help to remove the symptoms while the disease keeps progressing anyway.
---
At the current state, the game is mostly timegated (and timegated again over said timegates) grind with no engaging repeatable content that'd really be worth grinding. This is one of the main reasons why people resort to cheating more than anything else. Applying ban waves after ban waves won't resolve that issue.
---
They need to get their shit together and start fixing core game mechanics. The entire gear/character building/progression system needs a rework as a top priority.
---
Implementation of randomized dungeons with ever-scaling difficulty and unique account-bound rewards would be a good thing to do next.
---
Before all that it'd be almost pointless to fight the symptoms of the disease I described above.
---
So yeah, as much as you hate people who cheat and want them banned, they exist and will endure for a reason, which is a mediocre core game design.
---
If someone considers cheating (getting op guns/gear out of thin air for instance), that's how they see their experience to become more enjoyable  since the core game mechanics fail to deliver just that. If they won't get that experience, they'll just move on to something else and it will be mostly the devs' fault due to failure to deliver some quality content people would want to play through again and again while feeling rewarded enough to continue.
---
Well that's a bummer.
---
It’s the numbers after the dash in the question reference #
---
So will the Stalker’s effect naturally always do more than Vampire’s?

I get 14 in my lead extractor in my camp but I set one up at a workshop and it was getting 20.

Psychopathic title, but heartwarming, just like radiation
---
I'm using a PC.
---
No loot? Sounds odd for all three, but I have had zero drops from the queen before she was empty but I think just a couple of times.
---
No need to be Shitty dude, we where just asking a simple question.
---
This is assuming that the Fixer is using unique modifications instead of being a separate weapon entirely. Which, given the fact that you can recieve the Fixer from legendary drops, one would assume its it's own entity.
---
There's a glitch bypassing that.
---
If you own something of value in riften then the thieves guild will take it

Umm... can I have my desk fan and globe back?

Ahhhhh that could be it.... The video was of a workshop I think, not his camp

It has to be at a random encounter spawn point I believe.
---
Since all user data are stored on Beth servers not user hdd, no matter how many mules they have, the data is always available to Beth and any account with more than a few same legacy items should sound the alarm.  Unless the seller has 100 mules for the 100 BE fixers he duped, he can be detected, yet nothing was done. And letting unbanned dupers keep their goods is the biggest joke. The ban in 2019 at least either deleted duped items or wiped stash clean.
---
Fixer for commandos, lever action for rifleman. Handmade’s an honorable mention
---
I dont get what’s so good about them
---
I really hope that's not the case, otherwise whoever thought of the idea should be fired. They had one week of scare tactics and then they announce that people are free to cheat again without any fear of consequences
---
That quest bugs out in a lot of places. No real fix short of relogging to do it again.
---
I haven't had it bug out in the armor room, but in three other places.
---
Why did he dupe an anti armor combat knife?
---
Out of your mom's ass
---
In that case, I was a little over 12500th place in line.
---
Hail blond Mothman!
---
Why is gauss terrible?
---
I always went and ran ore. Most events I didn’t even waste ammo on enemies. I was weak so I guess “played support” and only focused on ore. 
---
The first time I was finally useful (level 48. Finally able to use the good weapons I’ve been stacking up) I was still running ore but actually getting to kill enemies easily along the way. Super excited to pitch in on death claws and legendary enemies for their loot.... mini nukes. Mini nukes everywhere. Some level 28 was hauling off his fat man and killed all the scavengers
---
Damn its been a while. Was that introduced with wastelanders because i dont remeber that at all
---
It has no blade. It works, but it’s just a handle
---
I do have that mindset and still have issues, usually sell stuff dirt cheap to other players just to get rid of it or just drop it near new players to give them some items Lol
---
Yea well mabye when bethesda gets done adding cupholders or whatever they are doing they will fix that glitch "office space" style. But prolly not.
---
Not for me :/ soak it up lucky duck
---
[August 18](https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjynjl/summer_roadmap_looks_pretty_interesting/)
---
Ah that old glitch.
---
Make sure to rename your favourite gear so it is at the bottom of the lists.
---
I use \_UN for unyielding, \_TS for trouble shooters, \_x\_ for outfit and random apparel stuff etc.
---
I've dropped stuff before, never since renaming the best stuff.
---
Sweet I was 18000th something so I really really hope I get mine tomorrow.
---
Honestly, probably just for the sake of the legitimate players. If they did a wipe back in december 2018, there would maybe be a way of justifying it. But now that people have almost two years' worth of progression, there is no way they can do that. A rollback is the absolute best we can hope for, but based on the issues they had with vault raids and the inventory stealing hack, their backups are only made once every week or two, so they just don't have the infrastructure in place to be ready for rollbacks. And a rollback would barely fix anything since the whole thing has been so thoroughly fucked so many times at this point
---
Idk he might have. I went AFK for a while while he was doing stuff at my unfinished camp before I moved somewhere else. He was annoyed that I had but never explained why, I guess I need to ask him if he did, but you're right that I should contact bethesda support.
---
I did join a SBQ fight on the flat area next to the grove, it was a excellent fight, I may give that a go for a few.
---
They responded to my ticket with that "we can't grant score" crap, but it's funny that they CAN grant atoms. So just do the numbers. All score i lost today was equivalent to 3 ranks, so grant me 450 score. Is that hard? I really doubt it.
---
Every duper I met graciously gave away gifts to other players!
---
I can't solo, way too weak, I enjoy the hubbub of a big group running about.
---
I'd like to put forth for commando vats: railway rifle.
---
I’ll try looking out more but I usually check pretty often. Really haven’t even seen even many ! events this past week. It’s been hard to meet my scrip quota
---
Did they auto lock the ticket too? Every ticket I sent about it as everyone I asked had their ticket auto locked by the bot without a person even responding!
---
Not every horde has one in it. The horde spawned from leader of the pack doesn’t, and other times you’ll find a horde that doesn’t have any legendaries
---
I prefer the "Leroy Jenkins" technique.
---
Or just let new players have their own experience in scavenging and leveling up instead of trying to coddle and spoil them like some twisted sugar daddy.
---
Yep, I went to fissure prime today to find 1 final legendary to kill, ended up fighting 2 1* and a 3* scorchbeast all at once
---
You have access to them but you don’t actually *have* them yet
---
Once you reach level 50 everything will start to fall into place, you'll get better perks to manage mutations and better gear will start dropping, it's worth the initial grind.
---
Sometimes I don’t get back to Foundation until late at night and Ward is standing with his knees slightly bent on the bottom bunk bed. I’m worried about him.
---
Yeah, some unbans were put out today, seems like most of the banned have gotten them
---
Yep, uranium fever is the best
---
What time of night are we talking here? I'll help you on xbox.
---
It definitely can't be that. The majority of bans were on burner accounts that would have no reason to buy fallout 1st. And based on steam numbers, the proportion of accounts banned was very negligible. Average playercount barely dipped, it peaked last Sunday at almost 13000, last time that happened was a week before the ban wave
---
The best place to keep up to date on news from them is one of their social media outlets. They commonly post the update patch notes and Inside the Vault articles there.
---
You only need Animal Friend to tame. As the other poster said you have to find the creature at a random event spawn. They're static locations so you can server hop until you find something, but if you're looking for a specific pet it could take a while.
---
As far as dying in a hole goes you have Protectrons confused with Ward.
---
Too much badprr from the innocent players also caught by the banwave!
---
Not enough people join to take on a horde of death claws. Most groups have a hard time keeping the workers alive with just the glowing mobs. Well that’s been my experience
---
That happens, just be careful of those dogy cliff camps and the funny looking ones with pressure plates and inner rooms.
---
I'll only buy from vendors if the machines are out in the open and clearly signposted.
---
Well that's unique to you as I've never taken a horde without one, and leader of the pack is 3 guaranteed every time one from each pack.
---
“Seed” of their pants? That’s not right
---
Everybody in the "no further notification" group got let off with a warning today, even the blatant cheaters with dozens of hacked items. If you're on PC, you might suddenly start seeing a lot more beam splitter 10mm sniper rifles
---
Yeah, I tried taming glowing creatures such as deathclaws and mirelurks
---
Incorrect. 
---
Anyone at about 50 or so right now will likely finish. We’re on day 24 of 70 total days, only 34% complete. Even with the increase per level, it’s still *very* possible to finish in time.
---
That's good to hear -))
---
I’ve always been kinda indifferent towards the junk stuff(The designer in me is more about it popping than it blending well with the game design), but I 100% agree on the frames. The buildings look so much better if the structure makes sense.
---
It absolutely is!!! Explain to me how theese are not unique version of base weapons. I would love to see what bs you come up with
---
They were never that tough though, honestly. This is a case of people remembering how it felt to run into one in FO3/NV with a low powered gun and crappy armor. In FO1 you kill one early game (The Death Claw) with relatively early game weapons and then a nest of them later on. In Fallout 3 the mid-late game guns can pop them before they get close, and the Enclave are actively working on pacifying them. Not to mention in New Vegas you basically fight them in packs due to how they are grouped if you want to clear the Quarry.
---
As others have noted, if you want to make them dangerous, have them move in packs. Maybe add a single mid-high level Deathclaw somewhere in the Forest where new players won't be able to kite them around (like in a cave/tunnel). 
---
I will say I agree it is a shame how they feel so lacking in threat since the gunplay improvements in 4/76.
---
I had this same issue, only random encounter spots work and it has to spawn alone. In my case, I found a deathclaw random spawn after a lot of time searching and was able to tame it. However, be wary of how far your camp is from the tame spot because it has too run all the way there and it can die. Likewise if you move your camp, it has to run to the new location and can still die on the way and at your camp.
---
I was scrolling through modifications and realized paints are the cheapest materials wise lol
---
Just  to clarify, these nukes where not in real life, I don't have that kind of control on central government and the military ✌
---
'Warm.. again'
---
Don’t discriminate against fat thumbs
---
Hence me saying “so the description says”
---
Dying for a dungeon.
---
They need to fix soon for all glitch and dupes or end up like a lot other games with ruin economy.  I love fallout series.
---
scrip and treasury notes
---
Unfortunately for you, I’m prejudiced against fat thumbs..
---
The Fixer doesn't have the same appearance slot as the Combat Rifle, nor the same mods. It also has it's own loot pool in terms of legendary drops unlike other 'unique' versions of standard weapons.  
---
Would you care to explain how it is?
---
Fu..ing Ward!!
---
And how am I supposed to make it rumble with my two shot auto grenade launcher if I'm busy collecting ore?
---
You go get your ore, minion. I have to kick some green ass.
---
your comment is my next post.  Best Reply!
---
Hate crime time
---
I don’t want to carry any more shit than I already do. No thanks
---
Not really, their time wasting actions carried from 4 really makes them honestly much less of a threat. They wasted no time in 3 and NV bumrushing you. Hell even in 1 and 2 if you got into melee range with Deathclaws all it took was one good crit to send you down and getting swiped to death.
---
It's a super low lev event by the fair grounds it's a regular event not publuc
---
Same usually, today I played for 3+ hrs and only just now saw Uranium Fever lol.
---
This would be a lot easier to accomplish if everyone didnt rush to one shot the legendary enemies.
---
Ya’ll better not show your cuticles ‘round here again, boy.
---
I reckon there’ll be a reckoning if ya do!
---
This is very helpful, but this was also confusing can you sum it up for me please? In a list? Just tell me the perks I need for each Special and what weapon mods and armor you use
---
Sure, but the question was "what does it actually do" not "what does the description say"
---
Where???? That was one of my complaints in Fo4. I was always so worried to open the stall for a jump scare, and they never came. Thought it was a bit underwhelming :(
---
Yes leader of the pack is 3 guaranteed legendaries but completing that event also spawns a wolf horde event afterwards, and the alpha of that horde isn’t a legendary. And I’ve done multiple yao guai hordes that haven’t had a legendary
---
😂😂 drug smugglers!!
---
Yeah, I'm only level 70 and have only completed the SBQ event maybe 10 times, but that was the first time I saw her go down that quickly.
---
RadShield for rads. But queen pee is poison damage.
---
4 actually gave them the hardest nerf they ever got. Their shifting around when shot at only serves to slow them down and give anyone with half decent aim even more time to blast them. They lack the sheer bloodlust fueled speed they had in 3 and NV that made them such a threat. Losing that lunging deathhug also hurt them.
---
Ahh just accept the heresy
---
I figured I had to be level 20 at least, but I was surprised that the option even came up in conversation. Probably just to give him the opportunity to be snotty.
---
The fallout wiki I think has a complete list
---
The crazy damage comes from limb damage, it's been bugged for a pretty long time. It's basically applying an additional stack of f4 furious effect for every consecutive pellet you hit. Since it's a shotgun, that means your damage is going up by a very high amount every time you hit the enemy
---
You just missed the double XP event (16-20 July). No dates set for the next double XP event, but the earliest it will be is mid September. As mentioned already, Meat Week starts August 18th.
---
Some got permabanned. 
---
Some got a second chance.  It’s unlikely they will get a third. 
---
This isn’t the first time a banwave worked out this way.
---
And a 1 percent chance of there being that used toilet paper that the scav protection is always rejoicing that he found
---
Ikr, what kind of law enforcement is that lol
---
👹
---
Thanks y’all. Appreciate the answer.
---
Did you by any chance lose quite alot of junk?
---
Commenting cause I can't like more than once
---
When you die you drop junk which probably happened.
---
On anything that can hit many consecutive shots quickly. No point on something like a hunting rifle, but a stalker's shotgun is getting 8 stacks per hit if all the pellets hit. Idk the exact number, could be anywhere from 5% to 15%, but I remember reading that it's the 15% from fallout 4. Which would essentially mean your damage is doubling every time you hit the same enemy without missing
---
I'm with you, almost 3k hours and never launched a nuke but jump on every SBQ or most other nukes zones I come across. Mainly I want the repeir kits from SBQ fights. Eventually I'll do it, probably solo on a private server, but the daily grind takes up most of my play time now. I'm trying to get good SS armor on all but my PA guy. All five of my characters are above level 100 and my main is 260 or so... melee, a heavy PA, a commando, a guerilla, and a rileman that's now my mule because semi auto was boring. Any of them but the mule could solo SBQ.
---
give to him the shepsquatch(dunno how to write that is hard) from project paradise 3 stars, he 2 hits me and I'm a godam tank. when I hear him I shat my pants
---
Whether it’s *actually* true or not, it looks and feels true to most players. So just stay on the ground pls 💜 your 3 more damage from being 8 feet closer is not doing anything
---
I have an Instigating explosive railway rifle I play with on my commando/rifleman build sometimes and it's rediculus
---
they sent an automate response email to which I responded getting more in detail to what happened. Then they responded saying they can't grant score and asked me to submit a feedback ticket and closed my current ticket.
---
All these squares make a circle
---
Damn im 9,988 and still not unbanned but temp suspended
---
Each to their own obviously. Would love her to come from EVERY nuked fissure for variety.
---
Better fight of the Queen, but obviously no chance for a collossus
---
I'm more concerned about the Spirit of Jazz who haunts me with their base.
---
How do they have different mods the only way to unlock mods for the fixer is to scrap combat rifles hence they have the same mods and the fixer has a unique skin built in ( this is how they add the stealth affect without making it legendary) and the fixer literally just got added to the legendary pool fixers were out long before you could get legendary ones.
---
Plus no other unique legendarys are in any drop pool there quest rewards just like the fixer or the nailer ( unique cultist blade from one violent night) I'm done with you, you obviously have no clue what your talking about
---
Dammit when I tried that backpack with that outfit the backpack clipped through and I couldn't even see it
---
I admit I did the fence thing the first times I went to a nuke (I started playing barely a month ago). because my guns are shit, I now just go melee, kill whatever is around the guys with the big guns and wait for the queen to land lol. I think it helps, idk, correct me if I'm making things worst :-)
---
Hard pass, my not getting bulldozed by mobs is doing something
---
I would add you can also get the rare Emmett Mtn Hazmat Suit from getting the ore to 100, and you can heal the 4 main guys with a shishkebab, and keep more ghouls from spawning in for a bit by crippling them with an explosive shotgun.
---
I wish people would leave the ghouls on the ground till people have the ore ready.
---
yeah some people that use magic weapons do so with no care or empathy for other people that want to get loot. They just wield power they have no business possessing
---
They have to be in a random encounter for it to work though
---
I will not! Skinny thumb power!
---
I wanted to laugh at you at first but the last sentence is kinda stupid but cute.
---
" I feel like I need bring awareness to this glitch because if there away they will do it. " :'D
---
She only spawns loads of mobs when she lands, so maybe chill on the ground till she lands, then hop up to avoid getting mauled while you dish out damage? Seems a fair compromise in the effort of efficiency for everyone
---
Someone like myself, who *hella* grinds EXP &amp; legendary runs would take big advantage of that.
---
As I play now, I can easily get 20+ legendaries within a couple hours.
---
Or even 40mm grenades... seems like a well planned plot to make u buy the 1st subscription by weighing you down all the time... just drop these thrash ammos once you complete the quests
---
I try and get enough ore myself when I attempt this event, but having to switch to the CSS makes me over encumbered and slows me down. Making it hard to make another round to all the caves. I would love to get the plans from this event.
---
I'm pretty disappointed that they just got handed their accounts full of duped and hacked stuff back. Three nukes on three servers tonight where someone took down the queen before others got a chance. Really great to have them all back.
---
My account and 2 of my friends accounts were unbanned today.
---
However, one of my friends is still banned. And to be honest, he did a lot more stuff than any of us. So I'm guessing that if you were bad enough - you are still banned.
---
As far as keeping the items - my only guess is their method for detecting cheating it imperfect and they fear removing legit items that weren't duped.
---
I'm also guessing they didn't do account or full scale item wipes because they want us to actually play again, and I doubt many of us would if we had to start over again.
---
Scammer
---
The link I posted is exactly the build that I use.
---
S9: 3 of each heavy gunner (regular, expert, master)
---
P1: 1 of Glow Sight (trade with green thumb for plant gathering)
---
E9: 2 rejuvenated, 4 lifegiver, 3 fireproof
---
C10: 3 Inspirational, 3 Suppressor, 3 Tenderizer, 1 Strange in Numbers  (trade strange for Travel Agent when no other mutants in group, or if it's being shared by someone else)
---
I14: 5 Gunsmith, 3 Batteries Included, 3 Power user, 3 Stabilized
---
A3: 2 Thru-Hiker, 1 Born Survivor
---
L10: 3 Bloody Mess, 2 Luck of the Draw, 3 Class Freak, 2 Starched Genes
---
Mutations: Speed Demon, Scaly Skin, Marsupial, Herd Mentality, Adrenal Reaction, Electrically Charged, Unstable Isotope
---
Power Armor: T51-B or Ultracite or Strangler Heart or T-65, Emergency Protocols on Chest
---
Weapon:  Gatling Laser or if possible Ultracite Gatling Laser (UGL has better damage)
---
Legendary effect on weapon:
---
First mod: Furious/Junkies/Bloodied &gt; Two Shot/Mutants
---
Second Mod: Faster Fire Rate / 10 while aiming
---
Mods on the gatling laser: Don't DONT DONT use  any charging barrels
---
Refined beta wave tuner, True long barrel, Reflex Sight, don't use beam focuser (shortens weapon range - bad for fighting scorchbeasts and distant targets. Also your green laser turns red.) Recoil is basically nonexistant with a gatling laser to begin with so focus on accuracy boosts with weapon mods.
---
Charging barrels SUPER SUCK don't use them. Doubles the damage per shot but reduces your fire rate by like 86% which is massive DPS loss.
---
As a side note you don't technically need thru-hiker, I just have a habit of carrying a lot of food and water with me as I run around, so I use it. Food/Water weight for me compares to or exceeds chems and gun weight without thru-hiker generally, which is really excessive but that's what I do.
---
As a note on the armor, T-51b has higher energy resistance than Ultracite and is cheaper to repair, but has a lot less radiation resistance. It's still more than enough for a rad zone, especially if you use a RadShield. Strangler Heart is probably the best for your outgoing damage as it's the only one that actually gives damage, but I don't know if it still messes with people's game performance. The second choice behind strangler heart would be T-65 as it's more damage resist making your more durable. After that I would rate it as T-51b, followed by Ultracite, followed by the rest. Most damage that you take in the game is affected by damage resist and not energy resist, so that's the more important of the two stats.
---
In terms of accessiblity to the mods you need, T51-B&gt;T-65&gt;Ultracite/Strangler. Ultracite and Strangler you can only get the mod plans from other players or the SBQ. T-51B is caps from brotherhood vendors. T-65 is gold bullion, which while it takes a while you can directly choose the mods you want right away, rather than being subject to the random award of SBQ.
---
Dang, their initial reply was what was locked, so I couldn't get any further response from them!
---
Bethesda tuned enemies to match the most casual playstyle possible, and I think that was a conscious decision. If they tuned deathclaws to my Bloodied stealth build, they wouldn't be fun at all to regular players because they'd feel like giant bullet sponges. Even sheepsquatches are pretty much "wham-bam-thank you ma'am" with the right gun and don't last more than a few seconds. 
---
If they wanted to make enemies challenging, they'd need more mechanically interesting enemies. 
---
* Like, imagine a super mutant with a giant, invincible shield made out of junk that he uses to provide cover for his mates.  
---
* Or a ghoul that charges at you and explodes, covering you in entrails and irradiating the area.
---
* Or an Omega Sentry Bot with an Assaultron laser and that deploys plasma gun equipped eye bots to harass you and that's invincible unless you strategically take out the armor covering three different weak spots.  
---
* Or giant fungal beasts that live in the overgrown cranberry forests and that spawn smaller fungal beasts on death and that cover the area in sticky spit that slows you down and drains AP.  
---
* Or Scorched that use signal flares to call in baby scorchbat swarms.  
---
* Or Blood Eagles that use stimpacks to revive downed Blood Eagles and that throw concussion grenades that disorient you.  
---
Etc. But I think this engine seriously limits what they can do, which is why we have all there milquetoast enemies.
---
Ranged bloodied weapons do not require unyielding. Only adrenal reaction mutation. Unyielding buffs agility for more vats usage and perception for accuracy. Your gun doesn't even need shotgun perks as what the other guy said on it being a magic weapon.
---
Yeah I didn't know this with my entire first character. I had like 1,000 gunpowder on me and always confused why I was getting overencumbered so much.
---
Oh yeah definitely, i’m sure just about everybody that ever did a queen has sat on a fence or tent at one point in time. After countless fights with her tho it starts to become more of a chore than anything if she never lands lol. There’s no right or wrong, just play however you have fun. Just make sure to deal some damage to the queen so you get the reward! I’ve heard it’s 1000 damage minimum required but i’ve not tested it myself
---
I just actually launched my second nuke ever and I’ve played since launch other then a couple months break. First one to finish main story I had help. This last one was just this week because no one was launching any. And I did it solo and it was a cake walk. But I am level 265 and have pretty decent gear. I have 15 nuke cards I have collected but never used. But tonight I got lucky and after one server not finishing the queen because no one but me and another person where fighting here I got on a server that did two back to back.
---
It is also ammo if you run a black powder build (hi! 😁). I think I get why it's got weight and is stored differently, since it can be both a crafting item and an ammunition.
---
You mean in real life?  Of course.
---
In the game?  Nah, that would be crazy to believe.
---
Thanks I’ll go copy this and try it out hopefully it works!
---
Are you forgetting that you lose your junk upon death? Players without Fallout 1st have limited amounts of storage as it is. Forcing players to also stash gunpowder or risk losing it is bad.
---
Nope I always dump my stuff in my stash but I figured it out. It was just a player joining the team at the exact same time I died and they started sharing Traveling Pharmacy lol
---
I didnt even get the "perfect" angle I noticed after posting... Also depends a bit on your screen how much the colors stands out. On PC it doesnt clip though
---
Yeah same, I carry around my Daisycutter to just shoot off fireworks.
---
I'm seeing they have been unbanned so you should see them back on soon.
---
I don’t like we player glitch on a online game, don’t care if it just person glitch but if affects other people that were I draw line because economy already broken and I don’t want to get ruined.
---
Yeah it wasn't because I drop all of my stuff in my stash before I go out to do anything. Turns out it was just a person that joined my team the exact time that I died. They were sharing Traveling Pharmacy
---
Yeah those perks are definitely worth mentioning. Staggering sounds great of course but when you realize it’s only keeping her airborne longer, it’s clear that those perks must come off. Thanks for adding your two cents friend
---
Just need some addictions and whatever perk cards you want to use for your build, the best addictions imo are:
---
alcohol, daddy-0,daytripper,medx,and mentats. And you max out at 5 so no point getting more. 
---
Also get mutations which requires class freak and starched genes under luck.
---
He who envies others does not obtain piece if mind.
---
What do you define as *random* encounter?
---
Theres some set locations that spawn specific enemies?
---
I have two bloodied characters including a heavy gunner. A third was a bloodied rifleman but I got some junkies weapons and switched. Ironically I still run low health on the junkie to get those benefits.  Top it with unyielding armor and it’s very effective. Give it a shot.
---
lol you aren’t stupid we’re all just trying to figure out the best way to play around the buggy laggy mess that is FO76
---
Unlucky my friend, or maybe I'm lucky as I've always got one.
---
And yeah I'm only talking about the three wolf pack spawns.
---
Either way it helps the OP get his numbers.
---
Is your character like moving to the left, because that’s what’s happening with me. And sometimes my character would just walk slowly forward.
---
Well bless your heart.
---
Pretty much this, your pretty free in a junkies build to choose how you want to play perk wise, obvs get your damage perks but feel free to choose the rest as you want.
---
Turn missiles in to the ammo converter. Getting 60 points for just picking them up and holding them until you can use the machine is pretty nice ngl. Same for mini nukes, they give 100 for every 3. Not horrid for just getting them for completing the quests. 
---
It would however be nice if they detected what ammo types your currently equipped or currently in inventory weapons have, or if you could choose and ammo type to get for quest rewards.
---
I don't personally know anyone that chooses to carry gunpowder on them regardless but it just builds up. Melee builds for example get screwed by not remembering to check their misc as it's often always overlooked. When I accumulate gunpowder I'm putting it my stash because I want my carry weight when running around to be for weapons not something I'll only use in my camp.
---
I think it was a little before wastlanders but yea it was recently added
---
I did the fence mostly because i went there all weak and start getting attacked so much and i didn't know wtf lol. Yeah now I'm more comfy in the area and the queen seems "not as hard" i know is because of the team. I get more anxious when I see a wendigo when I go solo than being in a blast zone
---
*shrugs*
---
I duped like crazy using one of the player vendor exploits, and not only do I still have every last thing I duped, I didn't even get banned. So, I don't know.
---
Also ore too
---
On xbox I ended up changing the backpack as it was wasted being too hidden
---
i have an instigating 90% reduced weight bash damage fatman. imma use it. and i'm gonna try to get a great missile launcher too. i'm a huge meta hating underdog supporter in every game lol.
---
Assasins
---
In my experience people don’t realize it’s off and take a while to run over and fix it.
---
It's all still available, it's just for leveling up in nuclear winter. Not related to the legendary run at all. You'll have to Google nuclear winter rewards cause theres no way to view the rewards in  game as far as I'm aware.
---
You probably got one of the items ward is looking for outside of where he send you so It wont remove the item when you turn it in and since you still have it when you join the new server it tricks the ai into think your still doing the quest it's a glitch
---
So? When would you use it out of crafting? Also if your crafting in any workbench canp or not doesnt it still take materials from your box? Do you really never deposit junk after events?
---
Fingers crossed, man.  :)
---
Look for a tree stump where it stops.
---
This is hilariously sad. I really hope they comment on the decision to unban.
---
I just assumed my clumsy ass character was just tripping as he ran through the waste land.
---
Shhhhh
---
and no its still live

TIL Satan posts in 76’s sub Reddit

I see your point. While I think the Scrapbox shouldn't be locked behind Fallout 1st (which is an entirely different beast), if my suggestion were to be implemented, it would impact all players positively at least. As it stands, there are no weight-reduction perks for Misc. items, and  there are for Junk.
---
At this point in time, due to the weight limitations of player Stash, I carry all of  my Gunpowder on my character. Sitting at 1k lies a hefty weight penalty without many options for recourse, outside of using it now or giving it  away. It just leaves one to think, "there's gotta be a better way."  
---
And reducing the weight of Gunpowder is also a change I welcome!
---
Try the spots I use in the mire. Go north from Abbie's Bunker and look around for some trucks suspended in the trees above. They mark a trail leading to a partially fenced in shack with two ticks. A tameable can spawn there. The next spot is the very top of a hill further north from there. You'll pass a little cave with honeybeasts and bloatflies. At the top of the hill is a pond with a crashed vertibird. Another spawn for creatures.
---
Also it used to let you do it from range like pacify, but to tame now you need to get in close, melee close. Then tame will appear, and to reiterate you only need Animal Friend for all tameable creatures. WW does nothing but help pacify.
---
Today I saw Rad Rumble pop, and it was me and one other guy collecting ore. We were sitting at 79 ore until the end, not one other player decided to get more. I didn't like that, so I broke out the bloodied plasma flamer and just kept burning all the ghouls on one side before anyone else could get a tag in. By the end, the whole corridor was covered in green goo, which was kind of neat looking.
---
I’d happily pay for the bundle without the outfit.  Do the math.  5x bundle is 1500 atoms &gt; 4000 atom bundle for 4 cents less plus 25 each repair and materials kits.  So a huge boon still.
---
No perks needed
---
Chem Fiend for all the drugs you didnt get addicted to but can use in a SBQ fight
---
Junkies shines on heavy weapons there so Heavy Perks are a junkies best friend
---
Dont let the man get you down
---
I've been alt F4ing for like a year now. I haven't had the big in a while. I think it only happened a few times (one was a weekly) in the beginning. Now I'm off by 11 30(30 mins).
---
I found that lag can cause NPCs to freeze. Try it on private if you have access.
---
10mm smg actually outputs slightly more damage than a fixer, and a railway outputs roughly double that damage. unless you're sneaking of course.
---
I've had it happen and i leave the world before closing the game
---
Thats cool. I just feel like a few people have paid their way through, which really doesn't make much sense at this point in time.
---
I prefer to fight her at forward station delta
---
the suppressor for the golden (not the scabber) handmade skin is still broken.
---
Apparently they aren't implementing the fix until the next major update.
---
I've been playing since release. I have a lot of stuff that's worth a shit. I get what you're saying
---
They are keeping it live til patch 21 so you have a few weeks
---
It figures there's an explanation for that. Too funny.
---
Certain spots on the map spawn random encounters, like a group of corpses or some creatures, robots, etc. Some of those encounters are the tamable stuff, but it’s a random chance. I think map76.com has the locations on it
---
protectors are fun to watch and listen to, ward I can kill wile looking at his eye and saying "YES I HAVE THE GUTS"
---
How exactly is the economy ruined?
---
Ammo isnt worth being traded. Its plentiful just by playing and crafting w super duper
---
I've logged in like 12 hrs after reset and had it happen. There are multiple causes but the most common does seem to be being logged in over reset. Its defintely not the only cause though :( Having my weekly's autocomplete was the punch to the gut for me
---
Neat! Is that a new gate to jump over?
---
I believe you only get a certain number of dailies refresh each day. So if you've completed all of them then certain ones won't be available the following day.
---
I play it both ways.  I'm not exactly great at it, but I do enjoy fighting other players and playing the mode as intended.  But there are other times I don't reel like playing it but want to earn XP because I am level 92 and want to unlock the hellfire power armor paint.  In that case I turn off team fill, put on aqua boy and hide in Grafton lake.
---
Could anyone tell me what is a duped item?
---
Look up the random event maps. There are set locations where a number of random events will happen every time you enter the area.
---
Nah. Make that bitch procedural. Solo. And it has 2 options. Dweller and raider. Dweller is easier. You die, you keep your shit. Raider, you die and every thing you earned is forfeit. And the farther you go, the harder it gets.
---
I only did it for the ghillie skins. Had tons of atoms from fo1st and used them for the board.
---
I completely agree. I run bloodied but I try to get my health up enough so I don’t one shot everything and when I see a legendary I always try to motion for others. Just common courtesy to others.
---
You deserve to be bound to this god damned cart! The shit I been through to clear up that fucking polluted mess of a la-
---
SHUT UP BACK THERE! I’M READING A GUNS AND BULLETS MAGAZINE!
---
It's a nice compilation, saw it like... Maybe a year ago. A must if you feel like "Fallouting" without playing.
---
Dupe is short for duplicated. Meaning an item that has been copied. So a rare gun or clothing item will be duped to be able to trade multiple times, spread around, or sell for money
---
Legit scared the fuck out of me when that happened.. peaceful, walking around picking up toilet roll for cloth for something and this fucking Ghoul jumped at me, my reaction was to press and hold R2 in its general direction.. this was before I remembered I was carrying a MIRV Fatman...
---
There are three less people to fight. How do you not see the logic in that? Don’t expect ransoms to be perfect team mates. Form your own team or hope someone has and uses their mic.
---
my vats commando build uses a two shot railway and just utterly plows everything
---
That’s where Bethesda’s cost of making the product comes from the virtual shit they probably also paid employees and paid for the equipment they use  for working and making the “content” so idk. Either way it’s a huge waste of money I like fallout 76 I just started a few days ago but I have vowed to give them no money for the shit they pulled.. they knew from the start that the hate would die down and the money would come from this shit in the years to come and they’ll keep doin it cuz we keep buying it (well not me)
---
3 oil for some SCORE, done.
---
haha this is what i did last time :)
---
I use two shot with concentrated fire and just go into it, no big deal
---
It's the VATS no damage bug. It happens to me daily since last patch.
---
That’s a good idea too!
---
Tip- your camp goes as far up as it goes down, so place your camp higher up for maximum potential height 😚 ps circle camp is fine for me
---
Can you put atom ship skins on that? Wondering for an alt
---
I paid to access their service. I play the game as it is without modding. A glitch just so happens to benefit me instead of making the game unplayable. Whos fault is that? Why would i be punished?
---
private worlds are essentially free on their end, since worlds are just hubs within (mostly) the same server(s). during double exp weekends, private worlds perform noticeably worse, for example.
---
so there's that.
---
Hey.
---
Fuck your friend. He's a dick.
---
Yes, any skin can go on it
---
I run a similar build. Calibrated shocks, Targeting HUD, and jetpack on everything. I don't bother with arm mods at all. I tried reactive plates early on, but they triggered PvP.
---
I unlocked the Glowing Skeleton last weekend and was pleasantly surprised
---
Unless it's quiet I don't even go looking for the legendaries there. Too many people chasing scrip and I've got enough of that.
---
just put a new map already like eso does with the dlcs and with the one Westlands will be even easier to do it.
---
It's easier to solo than with one or two people who have no clue. If I get there alone, I just cripple the ghouls with enforcer then get 40 ore and then kill stuff making sure to keep one scavenger alive. But inevitably someone comes in guns blazing, kills the crippled ghouls and gets all the scavengers killed which makes it all a waste. So if there's even one other player I'll just guard the middle until I'm sure they'll actually keep them alive then I'll go get 40 ore.
---
Well honestly the way you worded that made it seem like your talking to me. Implying my post is about me being bored. Besides, if people pay for it, who cares? I saver the flavor. I could also be wrong.
---
I’m talking about how TSE use to be rare and worth a lot of caps, now it’s not rare and still worth a lot of caps because of dupers.
---
Can you get recipes for all of these and make them?
---
Certain locations can spawn a specific animal for you to tame, as a random event trigger. These are, by my knowledge, the only way to get tameable animals. If you take a look on here, I’m pretty sure that you can find a Random Encounter map to see where those locations are, but still, its within a category of certain events, so it’s still not a hundred percent, and the animal generated depends on the area. You can only tame an animal that is at least half the level that you are at a time. The highest level animal you can tame is a level 91 Deathclaw if I recall, but basic animals, such as Radstags &amp; Wolves, I’ve seen quite commonly at a low level in the forest spawn locations.
---
Edit: Also, the Wasteland Whisperer Perk is needed for the more monster styled animals. Whilst there might be a definitive list somewhere, I see which card does what creature debated a lot. If you’re on the hunt for a pet, putting both on at maximum is a good idea.
---
Idealistic and naive? Are you kidding me? That defines Communism. It doesn't work. Look at the mess that is China. Look at what happened to Venezuela, with NO American intervention.
---
Common sense is far from common, my friend. :)
---
To tame you need to find the animals in a random encounter. [This](https://youtu.be/SLlw9ypFgkk) video explains it’s better.
---
That’s good news
---
Boomer is the worst. You can't skip his dialogue either cause he won't give you the quest location.
---
Honestly I wasn't going to either, but I really needed junk space. And I was looking at a few atom bundles so I went ahead and did it
---
I play on xbox and I ran out of ammo on the first two got loot from them but had to use my nocturnal crossbow.
---
Mutations yes but they are expensive. People like me sell the in vendors. Each recipe is like 18k I want to say with discounts, might be wrong though bought the last one ages ago. 
---
Chems also yes but its a bit time consuming and you need recipes. Its easier to equip Pharma farma under luck and go find them or buy them from players.
---
I haven't counted mine but I no I have 98 unused leves and like 30 or so unopened perk packs
---
Idk what level you are. but i started playing recently and I find this daily annoying too. But because of my level, is hard to kill legendaries on my own and I try to do it in events but most of the times high level players don't let me even get closer to the legendaries lol, so yeah I've spend lots of times jumping servers to find the leader of the pack and do the quest alone 🙄
---
How is it such an extreme difference from a wanted player to an enemy, 200 rounds before I dropped the player and maybe 3-5 no hits on an enemy every few clips
---
&gt; I’m not made of ammo unfortunately lol.
---
I don't get why everyone doesn't just get themselves an ultracite (or even normal) gatling laser and keep it stashed away for SBQ fights. Even without a single heavy weapons perk it's a face roll to deal enough damage to her for loot and ammo is NEVER a concern. Fusion cores are ridiculously easy to get (esp with the power plants producing them) and you'll practically never use more than 2 per fight if you slot Power User during it.
---
I’m still waiting on the placeable clutter items i’ll never get
---
With each word this story got better and better.
---
Yep. The hardest part of doing silo runs is waiting for the last part to complete. That part takes forever. As long as you have all 3 lock pick and hacker skills its a cake walk.
---
I know what you mean. For me, I was playing ESO before I switched to FO76, so I gave it a try quite fast. But it was a weird feeling doing so, and my Fallout bones felt slightly uncomfortable about it, but I soon got over it!
---
Secret service armour is great. I can't see myself going back. It's a grind, but it's worth it. Work towards the buttressed mod for the limbs, pocketed for the chestpiece and the shielded underarmor and you're good to go.
---
this, got more energy defense and radiation , was a world change when I took the full set 3* that I wanted.
---
You must drink gunpowder to allow the power to flow through you and allow extra ballistic damage
---
A bash in the face with a weapon is all the is needed to tag. Not sure why that is so hard for people to understand.
---
I did mine this past week. Made me feel good seeing that last achievement unlock (was actually the hack terminals one) congratulations!
---
It’s the mark of the fucking beast You got fucked by Bethesda for virtual scrap storage now we’ll be in hell with shitty game stuff like this instead of game heaven where fallout 69 comes out 110% complete with free dlc
---
Thank you. That’s what I meant by which perk will help me with this build I definitely get that perk
---
There may be some truth to this, but all I'm trying to say here is 2 simple facts: 
---
1. Bethesda is giving dupers back their accounts, knowing they were duping, and allowing them to keep the duped items even.
---
2. Bethesda is being shady about the situation. Letting some dupers get a "free pass" and others not. I mean, isn't a duper a duper? It's the same violation. Shouldn't they ban everyone who has duped, or unban everyone who has?
---
*This is not a situation where the ones who aren't unbanned have previous violations either.
---
Today's Inside the Vault: A bunch of dupers were unbanned and given back most of their duped loot. Players are still losing SCORE points due to an unfixed bug and it's now double SCORE weekend so get off reddit and grind those levels while you can... Does that about cover it?
---
I’m sure it has; only reason I posted is because since the dark matter skin has come out, I really want that on the fixer lol
---
I normally just drop them in a special place as you walk into my camp. I do that anytime I can't sell anything.
---
I probably spent 5 minutes just facepalming, sighing and then laughing.. I wish I had the sense to record it too
---
I'm not sure that yellow would work in a nuke zone, but we do need something.
---
I have heard you can blueprint the machine after taking the ammo factory workshop and then use that blueprint at your own camp and place them. I know someone who did it at the workshop and built multiple ammo machines but didn’t want to try it at their own camp after the recent ban wave.
---
I feel like everybody uses explosive weapons
---
Sorry if it came off that way. I was actually referring to a couple comments I saw but I should've replied directly to those.
---
I dont see a problem with peoppe spending their money if they want to. I just think it's kind of dumb to do that while there's still time to earn them. So you grinded the hell out of the repeatable xp challenge I take it? That's dedication man.
---
*So?* 
---
So people without Fallout first don't have an unlimited scrapbox and would have to store their gunpowder in their stash when it's already filled with a ton of other junk, taking up valuable inventory space.
---
Barbarian is not worth maxing on a high str build as there is a cap on it so anything after like two levels is redundant. Personally, I find blocker to be enough with a good set of armor and I use those other perk points for weight reduction or heavy weapons as a backup.
---
Sorry bud they don’t care
---
I'm getting this a lot also.  I'm running a stealth bloodied build with a full unyielding armor set.  Hitting regularly for 1800+ dmg on non-crits. Ive hit a feral ghoul with multiple head shots doing over 1800 dmg per shot. You see the hp drop to 0 then immediately back to 100%. I've seen this happen on the same ghoul 2 to 3 times in a row!
---
And don't forget Talons and Twisted Muscles mutations and that sweet sweet psychobuff and booze.
---
If its a duped weapon and you are selling copies of it It may bugs and you lose it forever
---
yeah, i have it
---
Or just make them useful?
---
Nukes used to make me giddy with delight, in 76 I just feel sad at having to throw them away.
---
The game is what the game is. Don't suffer. The whole thing works on wire and good intentions. They fix a broken bulb in Watoga Train Station and suddenly your shotgun can fire panda bears if you equip leather armor during the night. 
---
It just works.
---
No worries bro. I just didnt want you to think I paid my way threw. Because I totally agree with you that's kinda silly. Just enjoy the game as long as you can. Now I have no road to grind. I couldnt agree more about the grind, it keeps the game entertaining and I'd never want to shorten it. Sorry if I came off as a dick. Cheers  buddy 🍻
---
Like I initiated the event without you... I could have killed them all myself..be quicker next time 😆
---
+karma
---
In about an hour?
---
Never knew there was a max on barbarian
---
PC?
---
I'd say the dupers are the greedy ones in this scenario. Bethesda are just spineless cunts who refuse to take any meaningful stand against cheaters.
---
Because they obviously don't want us to be able to farm legendaries. I keep waiting for them to nerf Monster Mash like they did Whitespring, West Tek and One Violent Night.
---
Chinese stealth suit and lock pick lvl3
---
PS4 thanks anyway
---
I have that Fatman legendary!
---
Yeah I like this idea. Have small and big lunchboxes for example. Big lunchboxes drop from SBQ and/or WC. Small ones for sale in the shop
---
Stacked foundations with a few removed to look like that. The foundation stacking methods of yesterday year are long since patched. Maybe there’s some new method out there.
---
People without fallout first still usually stire gunpowder in their box since it takes up soace no matter where they put it. Thats like saying all the junk items should be in the misc part of the camp box since they also take up space too.
---
Bethesda have already announced its coming but it won't be in the next patch
---
Hahahaha love the explanation, but now I want that shotgun i know it’s a working mess been that way since beta
---
No problem, good luck!
---
The perk card explains it. I can't remember what the exact number is but if you have 15 str you hit it before you max the card. Also, DR has diminishing returns after 300-350 where it doesn't make much difference due to the way the game calculates damage, so I only ever use it if I'm in something like the stealth suit where my DR is low.
---
lol
---
Interesting. I thought only one mag could be active? I tried using a handful of them just to get rid of them but I could swear when I checked my Effects tab, the only active one was the last one I read? I need to try this again to check it. I have like 60 mags I don't display or use and want to be rid of them.
---
I just hate people that show up to the dance wearing their prom dresses and don’t hit the dance floor. If you show up wearing a hazmat suit, Chinese stealth suit, or power armor you should at least make one trip down the tunnels... it’s wishful expectations I know. I don’t expect bloodied builds to go down there at all and I’m ok with that. But full health in a rad resistant gear, make one or two runs and at least get the event up to level 1.
---
Okay that you so much!! Kinda weird that they don’t have an in game way to check lol
---
The Dr doesn't really make a big difference, so I guess for most people - its not a priority
---
with one is the best? it depends from people to people, I prefer ultracite for the rad resist and was free and I already had farmed all the subplans for it with out a sweat. other may like the carry weight from the excavator and the design from it? so many variables to goes on "the best".
---
Excellent information, thanks. I gotta look into my build
---
Gulper slurry gets me every time... 🤮
---
I live in whitespring. I consider it my duty to clean the place up of unwanted vagrants 😂. Keep the lawns clean and such. Plus there's 3-4 legendary drops👍
---
Most of what he sells is shit anyway lol
---
lol this is V.A.T.S.’er talk...
---
You can also get the christmas and halloween rewards if you play right now.
---
it has better radiation resistance
---
What drives me nuts is when I'm on a team with one other person and someone else creates a team of the same type and just sits in it by themselves forever.
---
I still stick on excavator for the extra carry weight lol.
---
Watch angry turtles video on power armour and damage resistance. There is hardly any difference between excavator and t-65......
---
I saw the Map that has different locations. So I’ll try to use that. Thanks
---
You make a super valid point with gat lasers, that was my go-to weapon for when the queen was flying. It’s just getting difficult to manage all the different weapons, i’m trying to lose the number of guns i carry so i can finally be rid of the bear arms perk for the first time. When you have 1 weapon as a “daily driver” (junkie LMG), 1 weapon for ammo conservation (junkie harpoon gun), 1 weapon for all out big damage (junkie explo prime .50 cal), 1 weapon to freeze the queen (quad cryo), 1 weapon to heal shit in events with friendlies in it (junkie shishkebab), 1 weapon for melting ghouls and other crowd-like enemies (junkie flamer), 1 weapon for pure funsies (junkie gauss minigun), and then add the gat laser for ammo conservation specifically at queen fights, like this shit starts adding up 😂 i just wanna be free of weight reduction perk cards ;_;
---
Oh my... This is bad... I am a new player, about 2 weeks... But I can realize the damage that something like this have on economy of the game. This game is strange sometimes... Caps limits, quest that pop up and then disapear on other session, (no talking about the events). Im doing a quest when I have to hunt 3 kinds of animals, but the third is always been slaughtered by a horde of Radstags. Anyway, I am going off-topic here... Thank you...
---
Fair point! Also, why miss out on tons of additional xp not killing the trash mobs while waiting for her to land? It's pointless to constantly shoot at her in the sky anyway if you don't have nearly infinite ammo (and who besides cheaters actually do? Gatling laser/plasma builds with 50 fc's on them at any given time?..)
---
Your welcome
---
I use my Strangler Heart PA for the slight dps increase.
---
Because on paper certain Power Armor have better stats than other Power Armors but in practicality it's already been tested that they are all pretty much the same thing. 
---
The only real difference between Power Armor outside those numbers you see and aesthetics is that Excavator Power Armor gets you more ore from mineral deposits along with more carry weight and that Excavator Power Armor is the only Power Armor that can't use a Jetpack.
---
But Blocker 3 never gets unequipped. It's essential for melee and very useful on most other builds except maybe stealth commando.
---
I want the glass "greenhouse" walls and roofs from the "Warehouse" set in 4. ☹️
---
(Not the dome. They're walls and roofs just like the other building sets)
---
Gotta get the Fallout cookbook. I've been having a blast cooking from this thing.
---
Ya. We all can solo it easily. "Public event"
---
The dragon is a garbage weapon anyway. Move on.....
---
Oooooo I’m a WV girl and I agree-I love my bluegrass lol
---
Cool story bro
---
I think I’m at 49 not sure if I’m behind
---
Are you forreal lol
---
I’d like to see an auto fill feature, or a prompt for creating teams. Like if there’s already a build team with open slots and you want to make a build team you’d be prompted “there’s already an existing building team, are you sure you want to create a new team?” Logged into a server earlier today and there were 3 build teams with solo players in each.
---
Alternatively, I think it’d be cool if they could make teams bigger, like up to 8 players per team, even if they keep the perks maxed as if there were only 4 in the group.
---
Take my upvote
---
So should ore
---
There's also the various resources that can be obtained by smelting ore, although I do think stable flux is a better example. There are so many junk items that are obtained through crafting at a chemistry bench that the "gunpowder shouldn't be junk because you craft it" argument has never made sense to me.
---
Edit: another example I just remembered, fertilizer.
---
Gauss is dogshit compared to the lever
---
Why 3?
---
Which is best? X-01? T-65? Ultracite? I'm actually curious. I have X-01 and Ultracite, but really wanna go after T-65 as it looks super cool imo!
---
yeah? then was becouse was free and no grind needed lol, just took a look 70 more rad resist isn't a lot. I'm lazy.
---
edit: typo
---
I wish people would just realize that this event is a waste of time and there are better ways to farm legendary gear that is actually scaled to your level.
---
People with fallout first also *stire* gunpowder in their box.
---
The point, which you continue to miss is that players without fallout first also have to store massive amounts of other junk items in their box. Storing some gunpowder is fine, but having to store all of it, or lose it when you die would suck. You wouldn't have much room for things you actually want to stash, like weapons and armors.
---
I'm done trying to explain this to you.
---
I read that if you do two, it eliminates the negative side effects. The third is in case I forget to add the mutated gene perk card and accidentally get rid of it haha
---
Is your game installed on your C drive?
---
Or have all 16 shoot at once.  Mmmmmmmmm :)
---
Omg yes! I lol'ed at that one. Well first I WTF'ed then I lol'ed
---
Your's was even cooler. You're so tough I'm jealous.
---
after lvl 50 reading through Reddit.
---
Today i joined the event and everyone was giving a thumbs down emote, turns out this level 50 something killed the legendary before anyone could tag it. What a sight it was to see everyone give him/her thumbs down for the whole event.
---
Want some french cries with that wahh burger?
---
Not originally, but I saw someone else say that it won't work if it isn't, so I moved it over using the 'move' feature in the 'Apps &amp; Features' setting.    
---
The errors have been the same from both my D &amp; C drive.
---
Only thing i hate when i load in that my gun is empty and have to swap lol
---
I sell high end stuff in my vendors but no one has 15k or 20k caps lying around. I don't blame them since I don't keep many caps on hand either since of the 30k limit and what I sell in my vendor. Anything I want can't be bought with caps anyway. It is better to sell things that cost 2k or 3k. I make more caps off selling recipes and plans than I do selling 20k legendaries.
---
It doesn't fyi
---
I will take a look thanks for your help.
---
Do it! Lol
---
Well damn. Thanks for the heads up
---
T51b all day 👍
---
Not too me and no
---
Np
---
[Here's a picture of that encounter in all its glory.](https://i.gyazo.com/0d97167f0e7ba511df0515f8d2929127.jpg)
---
Try playing one.  Was the best in fo4, absolutely terrible in 76.
---
All good man. You didn't come off as a dick. I was on my lunch break when I posted my first comment so I was kind of just in auto pilot at that point, commenting away. Lol
---
See ya in the wasteland :)
---
Yea I’ve been trying to get back into it because you need to do things for the legendary run and was confused when I was getting Christmas stuff lol
---
Oh, is that what you're supposed to do? Follow it?
---
I always just killed it and took the meat, thinking it was just a Hircine easter egg from Skyrim.
---
Power armor only spawns again if you take the empty chassis as well I believe. As for enemies, they will respawn every 10 to 12 minutes. PA respawns very slowly like loose items I believe, dont quote me on it though.
---
sorry but what is ar?
---
Assualt rifle
---
I always share fireproof or glow sights. Was on a team with someone sharing the card that automatically swaps to the next target in vats, which was great for my commando, and the guys were cool so I swapped to my shotgunner and quickly found out that perk is awful for shotguns (there’s a lag between targets and some may be out of range of the shotgun), so I had to part ways with them because he refused to share a different card for some reason. Maybe it’s the only card he could share, but if that’s the case I’d rather no cards be shared than one that negatively affects the rest of the team.
---
The tried and true classic can't be beat.
---
Right on man. Cheers 🍻
---
For a commando build everybody and their grandma is going to tell you to either go for the fixer or the handmade assault rifle.
---
I'll probably be a bit late for that. I can check with you when I get home though. What's your gamertag?
---
Especially when you got those people with those darn explosive weapons. Like they think they are cool or something.
---
Ok thanks
---
Just get an armor piece with melee block on it. Just one piece of armor with that attribute turns shotguns "Magic" for some reason.
---
oh now make sense, cool gonna keep and eye over here I'm doing and alt that will be using one too
---
You can get then off the project paradise event
---
1 - Point given, I forgot, you're right. You do scrap CRs for mods.   
---
2 - Skin = Legendary is a completely unfounded assumption. xD   
---
3 - And? It's still separate in the legendary pool?   
---
4 - Exactly, no others are in the drop pool. That's my entire point. xD
---
Well, that's a mild exaggeration to say the least (I mean the "nobody uses 'em" part), I personally see people with explosive guns every day and I've been using an explosive flamer for months as well. One of the best guns imo.
---
Naturesfunk. I usually am on pretty late though. How many hours from now are you thinking?
---
I have discovered that when I do a silo run solo it’s ways easier then in a group.
---
Don't worry, friend.
---
They're gonna do the absolute same for both you and me. 
---
&gt;!Which is nothing, I suppose.!&lt;
---
How can I get the fixer
---
10-4
---
By explosive guns I mean fat man , missile launcher stuff like that.
---
Probably between 60 and 90 minutes from now. Just grabbing some stuff for the dog on the way home.
---
Absolutely
---
I just want to use a ball peen hammer as a melee weapon. Or a screwdriver as a dagger.
---
He means Explosive heavies not weapons with the explosive legendary effect.
---
Not to sound like a cunt but u took a mark of a beast lmao.
---
Are you referring to the captain cosmos power armor paint jobs? Or the captain cosmos suit bundle pack? I think you can only get the helmet from the first Captain cosmos outfit that was available in the atomic shop though I could be mistaken.
---
Also what legendary perk would I want on it?
---
That I concur with. I hope they'll make a rebalance/fix for the entire gear system eventually since there are a whole lot other issues there...
---
My main is a shotgunner...I didn’t start using blocker until after level 200 probably
---
Not really. I mean yes, but the economy was ruined ages ago. If anything, it makes it easier for a new player like you to get high end gear at a more affordable price point. As long as you have fun, none of it matters
---
Right? Hah! Noooo thanks. 
---
Jumpscares + wendigo = worst combo ever!
---
Okay will for sure be on by then.
---
Lol sorry, I’ll expand: you can get multiple mutations at once. By serum and by radiation. I’ve gotten multiple by radiation after taking a serum as well
---
to reduce the negative effects permanently, use the class freak perk in the luck special. if you run more than 2 or 3 mutations, id definitly recommend having it on level 3.   
---
to mention it: first serum gives you the mutation, negative effects are suppressed for 1 hour.   
---
every serum, of the already acquired mutation, consumed after that just suppressed the negative effects for 1 hour again. use radaway without starched genes equipped to get rid of mutations.
---
Everyone complained about the ban, and now everyone complains about unban. 🙇
---
The captain cosmos suit bundle See how he’s wearing a helmet how do you get the helmet
---
Yeah, idk why they made it a circle when almost all major building structures use a grid like fashion of snapping into square areas
---
If only they had somekinda ketchup mechanic like Warframe has that you can do on your own time. Their "battle pass" recovers/brings back old challenges that you missed once you finish all the current ones. Finishing the recovered old ones brings back more ones you missed till you're caught up.
---
It's a shame people like you who can't physically participate because life happens get screwed so hard. The xp repeatable is available but that's not a catch up mechanic, it's a required one to finish it in general and takes a lot of work. Warframe let me finish 2-3 missed months in 4 days. Was a lot of things to do but nowhere near as much work grinding all that xp here is.
---
There's a lot of people who wish they'd just make all dailies weeklies too since not everyone can be on every day. Anyways, try not to be online at all or in nuclear winter as last place character was logged in at during 11AM EST (reset time?) since I heard that has caused it. I'm never on at that time so I dunno, but hasn't happened to me so far.
---
Double S.C.O.R.E from dailies until monday.
---
Daily Challenges right now are giving x2 Score when Completed and no Weekly Challenges don't count.
---
I don't know much about him besides roflmao and some of his fallout videos. They are well produced, but his way of narrating isn't mine.
---
My post was more aimed at the epic redditor who wants to make people feel bad about not knowing some fact from a game that shares nothing with modern fallout games besides being in the same universe.
---
And has probably never played the game himself.
---
Oh, lol I didnt even notice, thank you
---
Ohhh interesting, thanks for the additional info!
---
They put the other guys ship on the track so you would not have to ask
---
You get a fixer when you complete the imposter sheepsquatch questline. to get a legendary one to start spawning you have to learn the plans for the fixer which allows you to get them from the purveyor or I think from legendary drops as well. Fix your plans are kind of expensive not many people do the imposter sheepsquatch event encripted. Alternatively you could just trade for a legendary fixer. As for what roles it mostly just depends on what sort of complete build your going for. you could go bloody junkies anti-armor furious it mostly just depends on what sort of prefixes you would want to use.
---
I didn't notice that until now, thank you, and I'm shocked they didn't 2x weeklys, that's depressing a bit
---
SS armor is much better than any other normal armor while the T-65 power armor is not as noticeable of an upgrade over the alternatives. I wager more people spend their bullion on SS armor because of that.
---
My friend is level 450+ in NW. It takes him over 35 or more wins to rank up once.
---
Are we gonna make these post every day or just accept we can’t control people
---
Oh ok thanks. Is the event hard or no
---
Great, a level 35 weapon
---
They already spawn in the mire trees randomly and will hop down right in front of you 😭
---
Same I find myself wanting to grab lightbulbs and pencils and just the scrap value of things irl lol
---
Countless dupers are now back in the game, I wouldn't worry too much about that.
---
Good for collections....about it
---
I would say so yes, especially if you're just starting to make your character build. It's also the type of event that requires team play unless you are more than powerful enough to take it solo. The event only happens when somebody triggers it, in order to be able to trigger the event you would have to complete the entire side quest line.
---
Not sure why someone downvoted you, T-65 provides only a little extra protection, it all comes down to whichever one is your favorite really
---
They have those rotating counters in the connectors section. You can possibly set a ground plate down and hook it up to three or four counters connected to each other. Once the first counter hits nine it will reset to 0 and send a pulse to the next one to move one number up.
---
I was reading this and not realize it was r/fo76. I support this in any and all context.
---
Ok how can I start it
---
I don’t know why you are having different results with different ‘reduce damage while blocking’ armor pieces.
---
&gt;!t-65               !&lt;is best, I just didn't want to spoil it in the title.
---
I’m curious why you say Junkies shines on heavy weapons?  Not a criticism, just an honest question.  I have a junkie commando and a junkie heavy gunner and I don’t feel that one is particularly stronger than the other.  Running tip top gear with both characters.
---
In my mind, just use t-65 until you're full / done with what you're doing, then use excavator to fast travel to home.
---
They should have at least did the "gain XP" one
---
So good
---
Did you used a plasma weapon?
---
First you would have to complete the imposter sheepsquatch's side quests. Once you do that you would have to buy an assaultron key card circuit board from a robot vendor, they typically run about two to three thousand cops depending on your charisma. you have to take that circuit board over to a tinker's workbench in order to craft the recall card. After that you would have to go to the event starting grounds and recall the rogue assaultron. I believe the event is on a 3 hour time limit per server.
---
77, but I agree.  If "lazy" is the answer, it's the best answer you can give.  While the defense difference is slight, it's still better.
---
Because power armor is bad in this game. I *lose* carry weight with it, even with calibrated shocks. The only upside it *used* to have was the jetpack, which isn’t even PA exclusive now.
---
Yeah, cause tbh it isn't that much worth while to keep grinding xp just for it to be only 100 score point, only to be needing to do it like 22 more times, depending on your rank
---
An acceptable answer I can get behind.  I mostly wonder why people still use ultracite.
---
Yeah I think I'm going to do that later... I'm level 30 so what ar would you recommend?
---
If ur on PC maybe i maybe can help. I think i have a TSE Lever on my mule...
---
Supposeably alot of people who appealed are getting perma bans. People who didn't appeal are getting unbanned at a higher rate.
---
I do play one, I’m wondering if you can better explain your opinion.
---
If you use regular armor, that's fine, my question is why do people use worse power armor when you could have better power armor.  Surely PA is better in terms of defense though, right?
---
How did you find this?
---
Like I said. We're there for scrip. Everyone knows the drops are useless.  It's about those legendary modules and slot machine rolls from that twat at Rusty Pick. It's common courtesy.
---
A good bit of dupers have been having said items because Beth didn't get the account they were sitting on.
---
If they can't even remove a item from my stash box back in April or May, then they can't give you your gun back.
---
Probably because it's a quest reward so no grinding involved to get it. I don't see myself using t65- it's too chunky looking- even though I play in 1st person 90% of the time.
---
Wastelanders added static spawns to a lot more of them, so not too much value. There are very few misc/junk items that aren't obtainable anymore. The only two I can think of off the top of my head are whiskey bottles with caps and scorched ashes. I think maybe the bolton greens quest stuff, but I'm not sure if there are still ways of getting them or not
---
My thought with that would be use t 65 until your inventory is full or you're done with your quest, event, etc, then switch to excavator to fast travel.
---
If you gather all the ore you get 41, i know this because i did a run recently with about 7-8 people there and only i turned in ores, then again, you get more xp farming the spawns, so unless they fix it so you get xp while gathering, people who are only there for the xp grind don't really have an incentive to bring in ore.
---
As someone who isn’t good at pvp and won’t do it unless absolutely necessary, I feel your pain when simply trying to defend your workstation. The best strategy I have for working a valuable site without losing scrap to someone else is to store often and to be aware of the workshop boundaries; if someone who may be a threat approaches I’ll grab whatever products I can hold and hang out near the boundary. If they try to initialize pvp, you can then easily hop outside of the zone. You’ll likely lose the workshop, but you’ll get to survive and still keep whatever scrap you already earned. Pvp may not be for everyone, but in adventure mode it’s pretty easy to avoid without skipping over any content. Don’t ever feel bad about taking off to fight another day!
---
No. It's been bugged since launch, it gives enemies an armor penetrating buff instead of softening them up
---
give them all to me, I run an explosives build
---
I can 2 to 4 shot a bounty with my twoshot missile launcher!
---
^^^^same ^^^^username
---
It's so thicc tho.
---
Wow..... how'd they eff That up so had? And why is it still not fixed?
---
i have to confess: happend to me some days ago. im so used to vats, couldnt stop it. as i forgot to switch to the low weapon, the 3* was down at once and the place was flooded with angry and thumb down emotes.   
---
in fact i just want to mention that it happens by accident too.
---
I'm one of those people. But I carry a forest weapon for these situations. You don't have to be god all the time
---
Plasma caster and/or Gauss Minigun
---
Best comment yet “Winnie the Pooh’s asshole” I nearly chocked to death on me brew!
---
They just unbanned a bunch of cheaters and sent a clear message they don't care. Just ask some dupers to get you one
---
Because bethesda, and idk. There are many simple bugs that have been around since launch, and many mind-numbingly simple things that were around for over a year. Like the typo that caused prime combat rifles to use ultracite .44 instead of ultracite .45
---
Can't argue with that, but I enjoy my leafy boi.
---
Because of the diminishing returns. Looking strictly just at the numbers, T-65 is the best, sure. But actually using it, it’s only *very slightly* better than T-51b and X-01. So very slightly, that you’re hardly even going to notice a difference. Which means that of all the things you can spend gold on, a lot of people would rather spend it on something that’s noticeable.
---
Call it GODZILLA
---
I always quit straight from a lobby and have not had it autocomplete a single time yet. I doubt that's the issue
---
Did we get new songs since launch ?
---
Either scrap it(rare) or look for mods at vendors.
---
The problem I have is my character is partially built to carry my scrap rather than store it and if i did try to store it my box would fill rather quick. Which is why I was thankful Bethesda made it so you wouldn't lose it if you died during events but it still feels frustrating dying even though I initially never fired a shot at the guy and was trying to focus on the event. I am thankful i never scrapped the vault tec boxes so it's not totally from nothing.
---
well, thank you for the response. Are there \*ANY\* syringer barrels REMOTELY worth the trouble? Or is it just a novelty item?
---
[https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:\_Spiked\_Walking\_Cane](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:_Spiked_Walking_Cane)
---
fly swatter and leader of the pack are your best bet, as they are fast and leader of the pack gives you 2 shots at it.
---
I just passed Zorbo today but I was playing during the double xp event, so that boosted me quite a bit. As long as you pass him up before he reaches the end you'll be fine.
---
If we had squares instead circles, I can now maximize my steel production for my USSR character.
---
I thought you could sign into your Bethesda account through their website and disconnect any Linked Account like Steam.
---
There will never be fair pvp when builds are so broken that they can just one shot almost everything
---
Cheap, easy ammo? 50cal. Can make hundreds of rounds for next to nothing/minutes of farming so don't feel bad spamming out rounds, especially on a explosive one.  
---
Got the resources/time to make smaller ammo amounts in 2mm? Gauss Minigun with the right rolls is basically peak Heavy right now.
---
No I use handmades
---
Nope but hoping we do!
---
Yes thank you. You're a natural in the fast food industry. Seems right up your alley, and intellectual level.
---
It has to be at a random spawn site and you don’t want the scorched pets anyway. They get stuck in your camp trying to fight it.
---
😂 lmao lol yea I didn’t even have anything open in my pop boy all my armor and clothes weapons disappeared right off my character before my very eyes. Good try, just way off
---
Like the band on the Titanic! 
---
Except you obliterate the iceberg and the ship has a jetpack.
---
Edit: But there still aren’t enough lifeboats.
---
since you ignore the entire thing that I wrote and are focusing only in a mistake, you justa wanna someone saying "yeah I agree with you", but no I actually not, since pa have a hidden % of damage reduction the differences between them are almost not noticable the differences are visual and how hard it is to get it and I got the ultracite one for free and had a bunch of plans already learned why should I farm for? a visual upgrade? like others stated here go see turtle vids about the subject.
---
Ok. I only had this issue with plasma weapons. They melt without loot
---
Well enjoy all the downvotes then. I guess?
---
It’s a fallout 1st exclusive
---
I wear my t51 for the looks myself and repairs
---
I like the idea of rewarding public events with a lunch box or 2 for community purposes.
---
Thats too bad (for me anyway) I feel like I need this.
---
It was luck. But you do get mostly nice people.

AngryTurtle on YouTube has a video where he compares most of the heavy guns (all of them except the explosive heavies, I think) [Video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sWkklNsa0Fw)
---
In my group I'm one of the runners, since I'm a close ranger melee player
---
I never see .45 Ammo for sale
---
Surfer Mothman?
---
You dont need to be on the tent when fighting her
---
The tents are for the adds
---
I dont understand people
---
OH! Fallput 1st is a subscription. 
---
I read that as "its fallouts first exclusive" as in it was there and gone now.
---
Thank you for this URL
---
I've seen his video.  I didn't know that there was a "hidden % damage reduction."  I assume that more armor is better.  Assuming that to be true, t-65 is better.
---
Who's trying to control people? Just asking for courtesy. But that is asking a lot. Humans are just awful all around.
---
I’d greatly prefer the Macho Man deathclaws, but they’d never pay for licensing.
---
I just rename the armour pieces that i'm actually wearing so they stay together in the list .. annoying that they're not listed together like 'left leg armour - whatever' or at least an option to sort that way.
---
My xp/legendary circuit that I run is to blitz through West Tek, then through Harpers Ferry, and finally through the tunnels under Harpers Ferry (Burrows).  A full run will get me multiple levels and several legendaries almost guaranteed.
---
Update: FINALLY found the plans at some guy’s camp and bought it for 10000 caps
---
Well, time to stop playing the game again. Fuck dupers and cheaters
---
What are you spending you're gold on?  I already have the weapon I want.  I want to use power armor, what else is there to get?
---
 Nobody cares.  
---
The plan is everywhere, who cares if you get max level drops since any god roll fixer or legacy is easily had now. 
---
I don't even wait for others to show up anymore, getting ore is not as fun as shooting the ghouls.  You want to fuck around with ore, be my guest.
---
By far the best comment I've seen in the dupers vs anti-dupers war 🤣
---
TBF, leafy boi is thicc too, she's just all natural.
---
Oh really? 👀 I didn’t know! Ty for sharing that
---
Another thing to note is that not every fallout 1st thing is available all the time.
---
For example, I've had 1st for several months now, but since I didn't have it when this tent was available, I don't have this tent. ☹️
---
Make it for the grogaxe, fuck the board
---
I just server hop white springs golf club over and over until i hit 3! Sometimes i find two in one run so that could be a option too!
---
They haven't said anything about it as far as I'm aware but considering the storage cap now is twice what it was at launch, I wouldn't be surprised if they increase it again.
---
you aren't wrong about the more armour the better but you will need bigger numbers than 70 to make a difference and the hidden % makes all of those pa just slightly not noticable different.
---
edit: directly from the wiki
---
The damage the player takes is reduced by a flat 7% per piece on the frame, while the radiation damage reduced by 15% per piece, so a full set reduces damage by 42% and incoming radiation by 90%

take a look there you gonna understand why people goes choosing for the looks or the easy one.
---
please show me on the sheepsquatch plushy where the bad man hurt you
---
Be cool to see a skin for the plas rifle that’s modeled after the fo3 version
---
Nothing. If I really wanted to use PA, I’d just use a set of T-51b. It’s cheap, I’ve had it for over a year, and I didn’t have to grind for it.  Plus it has more than what, two skins? I’ve spent my gold on the plasma caster and SS armor. I have half the T-65 known, but there’s really no reason to have a set of it. For me, it’s worthless.
---
How many weapons do you have in your stash?
---
What’s even the point of this post, are you expecting people to praise you or something?
---
I don't have much of a problem with that seeing as music popularity is based on region and all three are set on the east coast with some local favorites. Hell, 4 even had some original songs.
---
The worst one is the professor bot inside VTU when you have to do the overseer exam, I just redid this quest with my second character and it was a nightmare.
---
Did you apply the Future Tec skin to your CAMP object? I've read that can cause your camp to not show up.
---
to let people know theres some good players still, vs the bloody builder trolls.
---
Yosh
---
Good!
---
Fair enough, good on you for helping players out. Make sure that your extra items go to new players rather than old ones since they’ll be needing them the most
---
*guy sitting next to you* “Finally someone with the guts to help.”
---
Thank you for clarifying that not everyone uses bloodied or junkies like most people claim everyone does
---
May have worded it wrong
---
Im a half Junkie...5 addictions but im an omni build overall
---
Sbq? I slap on my Junkies Ultracite GatLaze/GatPlasma
---
Absolute melt...3 cores at most i use (we want the drops for the mobs in a build team)
---
But i dont have any junkies autos so im basing it off of how well it performs there
---
If theres no diff then i prefer only utilizing junkies for SBQs and
---
Sometimes I forget because it automatically defaults to auto fill team whenever I turn the game on.
---
You and about 500 other people have posted this in the last week
---
always people under 50 i help always
---
esp when i give people 1000' of random ammo
---
The chainsaw is 1 hit per second it's cool to use but horribly inefficient.. level 5 gouls take a few seconds to kill haha
---
I got the fur lined coat or whatever from Christina’s. Was the only reward I missed out on because of work
---
orwhat they ask for
---
Where’s the roadmap
---
I agree, the recoil makes it almost unusable
---
It has the best protection outside of PA but it doesn't get the shadowed mod (or the shadowed mod doesn't work on it, don't remember which) so unless you're making a stealth or PA build then you should definitely try to get it.
---
Excavator is the only power armor I keep in my inventory to use it whenever I’m overencumbered, I don’t care much about the other sets but that’s only until I get started with wastelanders and start grinding for the T-65
---
It gets easier. You learn what to do, where to be, where mobs are already spawned and where they spawn, where the turrets are, and shortcuts. I have launched over 100 nukes at least. can do the silo with a bloodied build, solo, in 15 minutes legit, or 7-8 with "shortcuts". I never die anymore and only run solo. Teammates just slow you down eventually. All 3 silos are identical. The only variation is the laser turrets. Sometimes they are there, sometimes they are gone, sometimes they shoot ballistics. Other than that, it is always identical.
---
Ohhhh I had forgotten that! You're right, my life is complete now 😁
---
Leader of the pack doesn’t pop up on your screen like the bigger events, it’s one of those smaller yellow events that doesn’t have the exclamation point on it
---
If you join the Grafton protest you can’t get infected
---
See? It only takes a minute and a half, if you're as good as the best in the world.
---
Good job, personally I always keep known plans, recipes, some food, water, and aid in my vendor for free to the ones that need it. Usually it gets taken pretty quickly
---
This made me laugh out loud 😂
---
That's exactly what I'm doing t 65 and excavator
---
Every time I hit sbq people are on fence and tents.  But we still kill her.  Not like before when she wouldn’t land and sometimes she would live past the time limit.
---
We all are
---
They make all shit square but we build in a circle.
---
I LOVE the blood eagles idea. That would make pvp actually fun and enganing since it's activated at all times :D. Now just to make the watoga underground a HUGE pvp arena and you're good to go.
---
They are the best two IMO, excavator is the best for utility and the T-65 is best (I believe) for protection. But I’m wondering if the T-65 could be equipped with a jetback or not, I don’t know a lot about it other than it have the best overall protection stats
---
Hey there! Marsupial/CSS here.  I can't speak for those other guys, but my job is to keep damage on the SBQ so she doesn't regenerate (outside of mutation) with the longest range weapons I have.  Once she lands, swap to my Mutant's Gatling Laser.  Chuck Cryogenic or Freezer grenades if I have them.
---
Stop regeneration. Stop mobility. Damage is a tertiary concern.
---
If you look at the effort to get it versus the benefit it provides, Secret Service power armor is a *gigantic* letdown. The Gauss Shotgun is absolutely nuts, Secret Service armor is outstanding due to legendary affixes, and I hear good things about the Plasma Caster. The power armor and the Gauss Pistol, however, are completely underwhelming and just not worth the grind.
---
"People would rather spend it on something else."
---
"Okay, what should I spend it on."
---
"Theres nothing you want to spend it on."
---
Great, then I'll spend it on the only thing it makes sense to.  How is ss protection though?  And fall damage, what do you do about that?
---
If that "one spot" is the boxes, that still, and has always, worked.
---
Not worth it for something that doesn’t even do anything but sit in a corner, out of sight. Stupid addition to the score rewards imo
---
The fact that you go to the "ammo" category in the Chemistry workbench to craft it seems to suggest this is the most logical way to change it. "Gunpowder" has only one function which is to craft ammo. It's a "crafted" item itself, but serves only one purpose which is to also serve as a crafting item for a single category of craftable, ammo.
---
Making it part of the ammo category makes the most sense, so then ammo weight reduction perks and armor bonuses work on it.
---
Make a post about this lol
---
Yes they are all dupers but I understand in order to minimize financial impact they attempt to draw a line somewhere. Those who duped a couple of ghoul slayers rolling pin obviously shouldn’t be punished the same as those who duped 50 fixers and put them on ebay. The big question is where they should draw the line and that’s one thing that they will likely never disclose, because if they say 100 fixer is the limit, every duper will be duping exactly 99 units next time and get away with it. The biggest mistake they made is letting dupers keep the loot, that’s a terrible precedence they set up for themselves.
---
hit the nail on the head
---
Level 4 all de wey :D
---
Wish it could be painted black though. Not a fan of the red with blue eyes personally.
---
Hellfire Ginger Armor
---
does the executable launch of you find it?
---
I opened this expecting "yes" "no" and "its energy". Then remembered the community and felt better reading only helpful and correct answers
---
Were you in power armor or using any weapon that uses a fusion core or explosive ammo?
---
I don't get any of this. I get that the system doesn't seem balanced, with everyone taking the Building or Event team...I get it. None of this sounds ok to me. The BEST public teams we have now add a stat point. You talkin' bout multiple perks and pvp bonuses. I don't see that working at all.
---
i’ve seen that i killed the chicken, he was near charleston fire station
---
Did your buddy have to move his CAMP? I’m having this issue now and reselected the old skin but my CAMP device at my CAMP still shows the new skin. I really don’t want to move my CAMP cuz this build was very difficult :/
---
Honestly the missile launcher and fat man are in dire need of a serious rework. They're literally the most useless weapons in game currently. They need to have their damage values buffed significantly because right now there's almost zero incentive to use them.
---
I have a playlist on Spotify that has a bunch of 40's country music that really fits the mood for me. I don't have much bluegrass though, so maybe I will try to add some into the mix.
---
(Edit: I just saw you're on Xbox. Spotify has great integration with xbox games. You can set up a playlist and run it in the background while the game plays. You can customize the audio too so it doesnt overpower the game volume. You can even control it from your phone once the app starts playing on your Xbox.)
---
I still run backwards every time I open up a stall just because of the fear FO4 put into me. Maybe nothing will happen, maybe a ghoul will jump out. Or worst yet, I blow up

Be sure your camp is in a safe location like the forest away from the main road( graham kills pets) or water ( they drown). Put your camp device as far away as you can from your building. Your pet will get stuck and be crushed by your building If your device too close to your foundation pieces. Mins has the entire bottom of a hill and is several months old.
---
I don't want to use a shotgun, I prefer power armor for better defense and no fall damage and I already have my mbr.  So what else is there for me to buy?
---
I got ya!  I use a junkies ffr primed gat plasma for the queen with my commando so I understand what you mean :)
---
No, it returns an error as well.
---
Just completing the quest before the Encriptid one will give you a non-legendary fixer whixh is honestly great for level 30. You can learn mods from breaking down combat rifles. A good way to do that at your level is go to Wavvy Willard’s up in Toxic valley and kill every scorched. At least a few will have some. Then break them down for the mods and server hop and repeat. Legendary ar are rare at low levels but you’ll be fine with non legendary versions at low levels. 
---
I’d also suggest going to Whitesprings to buy the plans for the handmade rifle. Building and breaking these down is the fastest way to learn all the mods you’ll need (auto receivers, stinging mag etc). My commando builds alternate between fixers and handhelds, as well as auto pipe rifles for low level mobs.
---
Apparently that's what it was.  I've have the skin applied since it was in the store weeks ago with no issues so I guess this was a new thing.  Simply changing the skin and relogging didn't seem to fix it either.  I had to change the skin and then move the camp.
---
Fall dmg what's that laughs in bird bones with full team
---
true but due to the budget that it takes in your stash and house i tend not to
---
Why are there so many posts about this all of a sudden? I’ve seen like 5 of these posts today
---
Players can't be one shot most you can do a hit to a player is 110
---
I use party boy/girl in charisma for my bloodied sneak melee build, +6 STR is nice but that's up to you.
---
I’m on the same boat as you since I’m a hoarder and like to pick up everything I see. And even with letting go of anything I don’t need, there’s still a lot of issues and I seriously hate how limited you are. 
---
The worst thing ever was Pete Hines saying that the storage is unlimited before the game released, which got me excited since I was worried about the storage when the game was announced to be online only. It sucks
---
Quite the rant for a post about something that's a non issue
---
u/rebbiess
---
Can confirm,  it works, have used it for some time now.  Problem is that as bloodied,  i don't down as often as im flat-out killed... n
---
But 50% dmg for 5 points,  pretty good for sbq, not much else though.
---
You have to move your CAMP unfortunately to fix it. Or wait for Bethesda to patch it.
---
That's funny that you think it's an "easy" fix for a dev team that takes months to fix exploits and glitches... Any kind of re-coding done to this engine that was never build for this kind of game - is far more work than just acting on a suggestion.
---
fastest way is to go ti the Charleston lvl30+ private cell, full of ghouls there.
---
It should crawl out of the toilet like the ghouls crawl out of the ceiling holes
---
lmao I forgot about the spaghetti code, you are totally right tho and it's sad.
---
Beautiful. Thanks for the quick response!
---
Listen I get it suck for player without builds and yes I know not everyone has a lot of stash space for there junk , but dont spread false info you wernt one shot you where hit by multiple bolts there are tricks to this. 
---
Sit on the edge shot enemies from a high place stealth is your friend. And my biggest advice dont take workshops it is literally faster just picking everything up just exploring
---
Bird bones decreases strength.  Also I play solo.  Is the damage resistance similar?
---
Just tested my QE15 Assaultron head, that is not true.
---
I'll pay them 500 atoms if they make it crawl out of toilets.
---
I have launched on Karen so many times I have lost count and from my experience the best spot is the open field like the other person said.  Bethesda don't want Karen glitching and getting stuck in the fence or a tent.  And it she seems to target the player doing the most damage if that person wanders off she will usually follow,. It's a good way to get her to a spot where she will land
---
There’s nothing else *I* want to spend it on. Gauss weapons are still very good, I just don’t want them. That doesn’t negate them being good, though. 
---
As for fall damage, you just don’t worry about it. Learn how to use controlled bursts with the jetpack. Plus I have two piece of -50% fall damage armor.
---
They fixed it??? Nice! Sorry hadn't checked for ages. It was totes broken for at least 6 months though.
---
lol That would be awesome! :P
---
Cool, but I haven’t seen the other 500 posts because I’m not on this subreddit nor Reddit very often 🤷‍♀️ and there’s a demand for it, understandably so. Thanks for your input tho!
---
So first it's flat percent, then comes dam res.  Ergo = more defense = less damage.  Not a lot less, but I like to min max, it's fun optimizing.
---
I have no idea....
---
This community needs more wholesome stuff like this &lt;3
---
That's what I mean.  Theres nothing else I want to spend gold on besides the t 65.  So I *think* it makes sense.
---
sometimes for me it spawns like way out of the event area, check all round even outside the event zone
---
The helmet is not included in the reward you have to have the original costume and use the helmet from it.
---
Yup. Thanks for the info.
---
Congratulations I’m very happy for you. Live well in your new home.
---
9 dailies that give 2x score
---
Yup ran around the event zone in every direction until the game told I was leaving the event, no SB in sight I'm afraid
---
So my build is sneak crits with ranged weapons with some investment into carry capacity and weight reduction. The tesla rifle absolutely melted me not one shot but thats what it feels like. The workshop wasn't owned by me i was helping my team leader with defense waves. We were both on the ground the other hostile play ran up melted us both and captured the work bench there was very little we could have done in that situation because none of us were expecting it.
---
Check behind the red rocket in the lower bit of the mire near the ferry, I usually stumble across a suit there~
---
Hello, I am on PC too. Let me know which serums you need, I will craft them for you.
---
If you’re on Xbox I can make you one
---
I'm not sure how new you are but this has been the norm for 8 months now they keep taking things from the pvpers and more players leave aside from them so your gonna see it more and more now
---
I see you like death claws and superheroes, well funnily enough my character is a “black panther-esque “ superhero, with a death claw mask plus gauntlet, running around defending Appalachia.
---
I'm not, unfortunately. But thanks for the offer!
---
Yeah that's one of the spawn locations I checked. No luck.
---
It's fine in the ash heap, it does appear in the bog but it spawns in and then gets caught on a fence and killing it far away won't count. In the mire it sometimes spawns below the cliff but can teleport to the lure...sometimes
---
Sheepsquatch is a deathclaw and the Alpha/Diseased ones are pretty nasty.
---
50k damage sure ok you must have only played a few days
---
Gatling gun only has 4? Iirc... longer barrel, sight, stock, and the bayonet. So it doesn’t take much to get them
---
Edit - 7, forgot receivers and mag.
---
Man wtf.  I straight up bought $60 atoms and blasted score as a thanks for getting rid of the dirty cheaters that get player vending shut down all the time.  Then they just let them all back in?
---
On my 2nd character I use the log cabins &amp; it's very hard to fit 3 in one place successfully, along with food, Brahmin &amp; a collectron. I like the idea of a square base. Maybe give us the option of square or circle...
---
Hey I'm having a similar problem! Yayyyyy...
---
I have literally provided every screenshot possible to show that I bought FO1 and it's not applied to my account and it's applied to the wrong account. They're at least responding to me (once every three - four days) but aren't fixing it. Like...just move it to my account? How is that so hard?
---
They didn't even offer me a refund.
---
The event at the Robco factory usually spawns a couple legendaries and the last wave usually has a guaranteed one.
---
Server hopping or just pray you stumble across one might be your best bet, aside from buying the plans at Whitesprings and farming out a set~
---
I actually just got them.But thanks for offering !
---
Common sense is so rare its a superpower.
---
Yeah this was in the Mire, didn't even hear wing flappidy flap anywhere in the event area
---
I was beaten down to basically bloodied stealth build. Luckily I had a bloodied ultracite Gatling gun with heavy build cards. Was just more effective to stay hidden.
---
Oh I didnt know the plans were for sale. I'll probably go that route. Happen to remember which vendor?
---
I do suggest getting a syringer with a mod on it that reduces targets DR by 25% for 2 minutes usually good for the bigger creatures that your not killing in a couple hits but yeah it sucks at times
---
For accessorizing! As if!
---
Someone to talk to, Cookout, and Ecological Balance are pretty equal horrible I don't do them anymore.
---
Great, no item or character wipes? So I could've taken the BEFR GP that was offered for me and gotten away with it? Humbug...
---
👍🏻
---
Finally someone with the guts to help
---
Here's a helpful guide for the locations
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_locations_(Fallout_76)
---
Almost always when joining a team the players mic is turned off (looking at the icon) once, heard a random girl talking to herself while playing- must have forgotten  her mic was on.
---
Like many things with this game im pretty sure (most likely unintentionally) runals on RNG. I know people whonhad duped ALOT and didn't receive a ban while others on did a few and got the ban hammer.
---
Nope. Bleedout and radscorp barrels are outright pathetic, 3 or 4 damage per second is nothing. It will take you 20+ syringes and a couple minutes of waiting to kill a single high level enemy. The bloatfly barrel at least sort of functions, but it's purely a novelty item. People have used it in the past for farming legendaries or nuke zone materials (high rad fluids, glowing mass, hardened mass) but I think those have been patched out by now
---
So when the amount of armor you have is equal to the damage being dealt by enemies you get "optimal" damage resistance (50%), as you climb higher the amount you gain decreases quite quickly, doubling your armor only goes from 50 to 61%, tripling goes from 50 to 66, quadrupling gets you to 70%
---
SO against a 100 damage attack 
---
100 armor reduces to 50
---
200 armor reduces to 39 
---
300 armor reduces to 34 This is where the real returns start to fall off dramatically
---
400 armor reduces to 30
---
1000 armor reduces to 22
---
The single biggest attack in this game is 250 damage coming off a level 95 glowing super mutant behemoth's melee. But that is the catch, the blocker perk reduces all damage by 45% before armor calculation, so the only attack type strong enough to make melee damage matter are wrecked by a perk, That behemoth drops to 137.5 after that perk, meaning 413 armor is the point where you really stop gaining damage mitigation against the thing that needs to most amount of armor.
---
Otherwise the biggest single hit from an attack that doesn't come from melee are 73 from gun using enemies with gatling guns, and 135 from the oil bomb grafton monsters throw if it hits you directly, as well as behemoth thrown rocks. 
---
So against guns you don't need much more than 200 armor to get most of what you can get out of armor.
---
Dude.... i dont think i can because i haven’t done the main story line quest to get in.... i was just told this
---
Uh what?
---
Ive been playing since about 1 month after launch and the community has been fantastic and my main character is nearly level 100. This is my first encounter with PvP players and with how insane the tesla rifle is. I have heard about how crazy it is but never seen it in action mostly complaints from other players and honestly if this is what the PvP community is then I absolutely want nothing to do with it.
---
I’m 3000 hours in and have several dragons. Huge damage, super terrible dps......
---
You ever see a lot of high levels fighting the queen with dragons. Nope.
---
yes but you need way too much Dr points to get pass let's say 75%(just an example I don't know the real %) damage reduction and all pa the differences with the flat+Dr = like 1-3% in difference or people would running arround only with one type of pa but with this is just for looks/carry/mod and slightly more rad resistance that gets too 1-3% of difference not noticable wile playing only on numbers since you probably will gonna be running some type of buff plus your res from special.(again this was an example I didn't make the math accurate but i test it the x01-ultra-t60 since I got ultra/x01 for free and t-60 I already had)
---
and I agree with you the min max in this game is a hell lot of fun I wish we didn't had diminish returns I would be the ultimate tank in Appalachia.
---
Whoops. Where you at in the main story?
---
The only thing I want is the level 91-something gas mask and I'm fairly certain I won't hit the mark before the run ends.
---
Hope it comes to the Atomic Shop @ some point, but I doubt they'll do that.
---
I’m pretty sure that some people actively go to Whitesprings and other places to drop their loot specifically because they want others to find it and be able to use it if they need to.
---
So while yes, in this case people aren’t actively making significant sacrifices for a random lower level player, they are actively going out of their way to give lower level players a chance to get some pretty cool free items.
---
If they didn’t care in the slightest, they wouldn’t bother dumping the stuff in a container, and they certainly wouldn’t take the time to travel to an area frequented by lower level players in order to drop said stuff off.
---
For most part I stick with excavator PA because I would immediately get over encumbered in other types of PA. Rarely when I carry less stuff, I would use X-01 since I love its design.
---
How about an event where you go in and play the organ (assuming you clear blockages or something? Cause maybe by mole miners, mole rats, or etc) and then play the organ and it causes a megasloth to spawn that must be killed. Like have it be a special megasloth which has gone berserk and you lure it there with the organ. Call the event like Pipe Dreams or something involving the organ. More events that end with killing legendaries would be nice. Especially since the Legendary Run requires so many to be killed plus it’s help with trying to get the Enclave accommodations
---
The tent is available all the time but the different tent skins are not available right now.
---
I just got Fallout 1st for a month and I had the basic survival tent for the whole time.
---
It's so weird people are complaining the perk you're sharing. I share a 1\* Crit Savvy and even that gets sh4t on.
---
I bet people who appealed were the worst offenders. People who “didn’t know they were doing anything wrong.” Or “it wasn’t me, someone else was playing on my account.” Etc.
---
Yeah cross promotion sounds like fortnite to me
---
Ps4 I can make one for you. Or T60 if you prefer.
---
Weird 3000 hours in. Most people now that play dont even have one cause they wernt around and to my understanding the only guy that was selling them on xbox was banned a long time ago also same guy who one shot the queen with said weapon
---
anyone else have a experence like this?
---
Wholesome. I didn't move because of the game, the game made me realize the value of WV.
---
Did you try using your camera? It will pop up as in the view and help you narrow down where it is. It is maddening tho
---
Some people want to spend their gold bullion on other things first, especially for builds like bloodied that rarely use pa
---
Because no one ever uses the handmade with a suppressor attached /s
---
Nice all I get over mics is some arsehole whining about how much the game sucks or someone taking a massive bong rip then spending the next 15 mins coughing up a lung
---
She can get a little jealous sometimes...
---
I'm on PC, and I'm actually trying to complete a set. But thanks for the offer!
---
I’ve got one for you. Mack012166. I’ll be on Friday afternoon around 1 eastern time.
---
don't bomb us trying to make fallout real lol
---
congrats on founding a good place to settle mate
---
It really isnt but that what people will want you to believe most us plan our fights ahead of time and we didnt really involve others
---
A good place to get gatling guns to scrap is to go to lucky hole mine, there should always be a cultist in there with one.
---
So what? Repair kits drops from the queen, and they are better than atom shop version. They would do the same with lunch boxes for sure in a future
---
Lmao... let’s just say i take my time...
---
As I said in another thread, I'm kinda bummed out because of this. I declined a free BEFR GP that I could've now traded for a B2525 Fixer which I've been looking for a year or so. 
---
Been grinding weekly to roll with Gramgram and hunting 3\* legendaries to even get something good to trade it for, but so for I've only gotten 1 good item (F2525 Handmade, and that's nowhere near enough for a B2525 Fixer)
---
Goddamit Bethesda.
---
Lol me too
---
well you went there, fine
---
I am not anti mask, i am anti-flimsy piece of cloth that does nothing dork.
---
A flimsy piece of cloth will do nothing to protect you from an air born pathogen, any mask that does not have a positive seal will do literally jack and shit. If air can get around the mask so can a  virus. All that flimsy piece of cloth does is offer people that may not be wearing a mask a minimum of protection in the event you get close enough to breathe or god forbid sneeze in their direction.
---
If you are going to wear a mask Wear a real fucking mask! It needs to be filtered, it needs to be properly ventilated, a piece of actual PPE!
---
Do the Brotherhood events, Surface to Air, Distant Thunder, and Line in the Sand, I usually wind up with T-51 pieces from those. Besides, they're fun, so do them anyway.
---
If one effect *cough* bloodied *cough* wasn’t so much blatantly better, this wouldn’t be an issue.
---
But yeah, these need upscaling, and assassins should work on humans and players equally.
---
Thanks anyways. I’ll get started on it now and we can do it some other time?
---
I've been trying to melee the SBQ, I can deal 43,000 [Damage](http://imgur.com/a/Q4VQUAq)
---
But her AoE attack after she lands kills me 🤔 need to swap some perk cards around and see what keeps me alive
---
I've done Line in the Sand a few times bc I agree it is pretty fun, but I'll give the others a shot too.
---
With Secret Service armor, I also get no fall damage (Acrobat legendary affix on two pieces), fantastic damage mitigation, and a jetpack. Just the fact that the armor is Legendary makes a massive difference. I'd highly recommend getting some. I have a full Unyielding set and it's pretty damn great.
---
Simple explanation:  
---
Diminishing Returns.
---
Long explanation:  
---
Power Armor or normal armor, after about 400 DR/ER/RR resistance, you're trying to crush water from stone. At around 350, you're already pushing the boulder up hill, and will barely notice any beneficial gain in defense.  
---
Because of this, all PA are almost identical in protection to each other. The only noticeable outliers are the Raider, T-45 and Excavator. And even then, the difference is minimal.
---
A friend dared me to use my last search result
---
I saw one that said I needed to play for 76000 hours for 20 atoms
---
Sure feel free to add me, gamertag Lietwolf
---
I can also help out some with the main quests if you want also. Doesn't hurt to finish the wastelanders line also to start getting the currency that comes with that.
---
What’s weird about 3000 hours. And it’s actually 3141. Just checked. Dragons used to drop left, right, and centre. I probably scrapped ten or more. The reload is so slow it’s fucking painful....
---
what is with all the downvotes? people dont like helpign others?&gt;
---
Log out before reset and when logging back in join public server
---
So, it's like I suspected - once you get a mutation from embracing the sweet glow of the atom, that's it, you can't get another unless you find a serum - correct?
---
Anyone else unable to sell more than 1 item through the vendor? Is that a bug or how it’s meant to be??
---
Not gonna lie, had started off this whole quarantine thing roaming the vast wastes of Appalachia for the first time since launch. I was actually having a pretty good time and impressed with the changes that had been made. I had finally gotten my trading post established just off the highway by the top of the world and decided to take the plunge and head towards the eastern edge of the map to complete the BoS missions and find the Free States. 
---
Worked my way across the Savage Divide with only one major altercation. Took a quick pit stop in the mountain pass to heal up and awoke in the back of a wagon swearing a name I have never heard before but somehow was ever prevalent. "God damnit Todd Howard" I mutter to myself as I look around at the rickety carriage and even ricketier company.
---
TLDR: I am now the leader of the Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, Companions, and something they keep bothering me about being a dragon born or some shit. Anyways, I kill people with a glance, have more money than the Imperial Treasury, smell like wet dog, and have never had more fun in my life. I love post apocalyptic America!
---
I’m so glad I saw this post, same thing has happened to me. Just bought the 2000 gold plan for T-65 jet pack and then surprise I get all these crazy listings for “Camo Secret Service Jet Pack Paint” and “Dark Matter Jet Pack”
---
The reload was bad but when I was playing the same as polar igloo build from a year ago once you shot your target it didn't matter
---
If you haven't tried them yet the regular nuka grenade is noticeably better than all the others. Recipe is one nuka cola and a frag grenade, pretty cheap ;)
---
Just realised I'm a numpty and I'm sending you off on a fairy hunt, you can get the plans from treasure maps but that's more grind but kinda cool haha, sorry about that~
---
No sneak, just a ton of practice and easily 100+ solo launches, possibly double. Power armor with an AA FFR 50 Cal. I know where all the turrets are and whats coming up, fastest ways through each section and so on.
---
I'm saving for a high end PC and I'm fairly certain the game won't even run on that without tweaking.
---
One of the best ways to improve performance is to turn grass fade way, way down.
---
Nice...very Far Side 👍🏻
---
Good. I hope you wear one!
---
All the stuff I described is happening without vats.
---
I'm glad my camp's near a random encounter, which spawns a Sheepsquatch most of the time.
---
I don't think you can start it again by server hopping, I'm pretty sure the 1 hour cooldown will follow you into any other server you join. Someone else could start it, though, so if you have friends you could knock out 4 in a row (as long as you can find 4 separate servers and don't get stuck in a loop where the game wants to keep putting you back in the same server). But yeah, it's a great event, ridiculously easy to do solo, and very easy to get the best chance at rare drops as long as you familiarize yourself with all the loot spawns. I did a run last night and got 4 legendaries including the captain, 3 of which were 3 star.
---
Sure! We can run it!
---
Normally, I don't gripe about what goes on with game mechanics on here, but this is ridiculous!  You would think there would be an algorithm that could tell what your weapon preferences were or something, I don't know.  I am just a simple caveman, you're technology frightens and confuses me.  But, I don't  need that many 40 mm grenades and launchers.  Nor do I want missiles.  Mini-nukes, I'll take.  I just like standing back and lobbing them at places until I have to "for real" go into them.
---
ALSO, OP!  I love you for correct use of bugbear!
---
I had it with normal energy weapons
---
haha seems that way
---
It does make you wonder - in my case I've played nearly 3000 hours, never duped &amp; still have a 2* be gatling gun as a main weapon. Guess that's a reason to get involved in duping.??????
---
It's cool. Thanks for letting me know.
---
u r asking to make the game more easy for u.  there is no reason to put it in the junk category at all. from another point of view in order to actually help out some players it would be nice let everyone to have scrapbox for a short period of time. it would be more faming, more workshop wars, more fun. Players will be forced to move their bodies a lot.
---
Did you re-enter its inventory after first, checking?
---
Happens to me but I know if I just go back into the inventory of it it'll be there.
---
With the right perks &amp; mutations, you can get the card damage of the Bloodied Gauss Pistol to over 1k -- add headshot + VATS criticals to that and you're hitting 4-5k a pop.
---
The level boosts for atoms are over priced af, should be a 3rd the cost per level that it currently is. At this rate, they’re valuing the entire legendary run for over $140 which is asinine
---
Edit:forgot the 1 in 140 and also this is if you were to pay for EVERY rank of the entire legendary run. Preposterous
---
Sounds like you’re reading something into my reply that i didn’t say. I’m not saying the challenges should be simpler or take less effort. I’m not complaining. All I said was based on what I’ve seen, I disagree that we’ll complete most of the challenges if we just casually play the game without deliberately working on them.
---
It may depend on how many hours you play per day. Most days I have maybe 2 hrs I can spend on FO76. The dailies plus making sure I’m making progress on the weeklies take up pretty much all of that. Maybe people who play 4-6 hrs a day can hit them with “taking a little step.” I heard you fine I just didn’t agree with your statement.
---
Thanks- wouldn’t have even known there was a different version of whiskey bottles...way beyond my attention to the game hahaha
---
Scorched ashes are a thing? I have a few on my first character from original release that I held onto, not knowing what they were for or if I’d need them down the road. I should maybe log in with that one again. What use are they?
---
Camp steel extractor max is 20
---
Lead is 14
---
I think Acid is 14 too
---
I have never needed to farm copper, silver, or gold at my camp so I can't answer that.
---
"I'm Mister Heat Miser..."
---
Yes because having the same gun twice definitely can't be traded for so everyone is a cheater
---
I do that. 
---
I think what might have got me is that I tried to log in today around 2pm EST before realizing my internet was temporarily down. I couldn't log in and didn't try again until around 11pm EST. When I got in at that time my dailies were complete.
---
Or that may just be a coincidence. Idk.
---
omg can confirm her at dent and sons, got the hat not the dress though, can confirm you can know where the pumpkin house is
---
&gt;but then make the ammo super rare
---
Scarcity is not a good balancing mechanism in a game that cannot get dupers under control. Instead, if you want to have a mega powerful launcher, give it next to zero durability. Fire it once, and it breaks. Then, make it expensive to repair, maybe by requiring unstable flux. *(Why unstable flux and not stable flux? Because unstable flux expires and is therefore not an attractive target for dupers.)* And maybe make it so you can't repair it with repair kits. Finally, make sure the launcher weighs a ton.
---
With those parameters, yeah, I could see how you could make a truly fearsome launcher work in 76.
---
You have plenty of time, if you manage properly. It isn’t going to end till mid-September, more challenges are out, and some double SCORE events are happening. I’d say, at this rate, you only need to hop on about 8-10 hrs a week to finish, since it does take about 2 hrs to grind out some of the higher end SCORE tiers.
---
Even just popping on once a day to do the easy 5/7 dailies is enough, that only takes you about 30-45 minutes. Nuclear Winter ones can be avoided, if you don’t like the gamemode, either. Doing, this, though, you may need to buy a tier or two.
---
Keep running into people having a camp/platform there. 1-2 foundations and a see thru platform a couple stories up. A big platform like 2 scorchbeasts on it and theres still tons of room. It kept landing up top.  They summoned 6-7 earlier today like that and it was a breeze
---
This. On my 3600 and 2060S I get 120fps pretty much everywhere else on the map except dense player camps and a few Blood Eagle bases. I'm lucky to average 30 in certain parts of the Whitespring, and if there's a player camp it drops to 20. And I've done a lot of config tweaking to get a good balance of performance and visuals. I don't know how the hell people can stand to camp there, especially if they're using default values for grass.
---
In the watoga one. It will be up the train tracks at the station house.  It gets loaded in there and gets stuck.

Havign gotten a heavy weapons/explosives build to 100 now, I'm honestly a little baffled by some of the complaints here. A TS auto-nade launcher is \*amazing\* at clearing just about anything. A fully demo expert built MIRV fatman can clear an entire room \*easily\* (provided you aim ABOVE the target and let the bomblets do their job) Though My missile launcher is still a bit underwhelming atm. If I find one with better mods, I'll try it again for sure. In my experience, two shot appears to be far superior for explosive weapons than even junkies. \*MAYBE\* even bloodied, for the mere fact you can damage yourself with explosive (Fire-proof in Endurance is a MUST). Defense events, like guided meditation? I can take an entire side of the building myself, and I'll be snoring half the time waiting for a new wave, cuz one MIRV, or a few shots from my grenade launcher will clear a wave of charred ghouls in a couple seconds.

&gt; **(Without purchasing)**
---
[](/kcelestiaseriously)I just want to put this here again in case Bethesda says we asked to buy them.
---
I’ve wondered about this issue all day, and as much as I hate to admit it, I think it’s likely that they lost so many 1st members that they needed to enable their accounts again for the revenue. Whether they need the income to remain profitable or are just making the decision that money&gt;integrity which IMO is just sad
---
Leader of the pack and every horde event
---
try the filters out
---
Yeah I haven't been able to do it every single day, but I do play like for hours just doing events so I imagine it's been able/going to add up soon. Glad I don't have to worry too much cause I know that was a big concern of peoples and if I can do it where I can literally only play this about 3-4 times a week then I feel like there is hope for some of the worried folk.
---
I feel like you missed out on what I said
---
You ended up with a plasma core that was low that’s why in the pip-boy you Can see the condition of you reload one it keeps that core till it’s completely drained
---
The bolton green plate can still be obtained but it no longer has a model when displayed.
---
Oh okay that makes sense, thank you
---
Yeah once you get the hang of it and learn the ropes they are quick, easy, &amp; fun.
---
What makes you think they are unbanning cheaters?
---
If it’s because of possession of duped weapons, how do you know?
---
If it’s because you figured they banned only cheaters, then wouldn’t the fact they unbanned them make them not cheaters? 
---
That is to say, don’t get mad at your own imagination on this subject.
---
Its buggy and it will leave the almost empty core in your inventory until it cycles through again. When you notice that it forces a reload but you still have shots left switch to another weapon then switch back to finish off the core. This happens with that and both ultracite and normal gatling lasers
---
There is shit load of videos about legendary farming routes, random encounters, uranium fever, horde events, leader of the pack event. But wait, you need some effort for that, like Google for 1 min. Better come to reddit and whine about non existing problem. Downvote if you want, im just tired from lazy people
---
You might have said it sarcastically, however I would not know since it’s text and I can’t see time and inflection through words.
---
Hahaha EXACTLY! We’re all here just to enjoy the game however people choose to do that
---
They chunked a lot of mechanics going from FO4 to 76.
---
Glowing Ones aren't Archviles.  
---
Ragdoll drastically reduced. Removed completely from Pain Train perk.  
---
"Grabbing" objects and corpses removed.  
---
Power Armor series model variants removed.  
---
Power Armor series set passives removed.
---
There's probably a lot more.. that's just off the top of my head.
---
Plan is a few thousand. Then you can craft/scrap until you know the mods. I think it was either the watoga train station or Phoenix in the watoga shopping area.
---
Was expecting bitching about the currency limits and was pleasantly surprised.
---
I know people seem to hate this game but I wish there was an Elder Scrolls version of it because all ESO does is remind me of a BDO-lite :(
---
Whenever I take part in large battles, or anything other than just standing all alone in camp really, there’s a chance that my Gatling plasma will do crazy things with my plasma cores. Sometimes I’ll reload numerous times without the number of total cores ever appearing to move, and then all of a sudden, as I’m in the SBQ’s face, I hit 0 and reality strikes me like a cold, unfeeling pimp slap as I’m left to switch to my melee. If I manage to make it through the fight with rounds to spare, my ammo count always seems to catch up when I’m in a nice quiet spot by myself. This is the biggest thing that keeps me from committing to a build around that weapon.
---
Ducking florida man
---
What you can do to try to prevent that is to only have enough supplies for 1 person, and refill it after each person. That way nobody can ever take more than they should. Plus your shop can stay authentic, as high level players can partake too.
---
I got a quad tesla just for tagging.
---
i would rather they fix missile launchers and fatman launchers so that i actually WANT to have the ammo.
---
As cool as it is to pretend we are in a post-apocalyptic world. I don't think I could suffer some of the emotional trauma some of the people you learn about through terminals or holo tapes and have the will to go on.
---
but mr house isn't even a year old yet!
---
wait whos mister house? :p
---
I've gotten multiple T-60 pieces running the silos. Its in the room with a tinker's workbench next to the sentrybot when you have to replace/repair mainframe cores.
---
Was it the 70s Ran Jam version or the old school Lead Belly version. Both are really good. My wife and I had a massive Wikipedia/YouTube rabbit hole the other night about that song. 
---
It ended with watching Nirvana doing the Where did you sleep last night?  on unplugged.
---
And this weekend EVERYONE has the same goal- tick that XP repeatable SCORE payout as much as humanly possible!!
---
It isn’t.
---
Cross over content could be cool like relics of the past, but I guess it wouldn't work cause of it being an alternate America.
---
I don't think you understand the situation but ok
---
It is an amazing community to say the least! 
---
I started my owen 76 community/faction over a year ago. Started with just wanting people to not feel alone, depression and anxiety can effect so many gamers. We started with 20 members and now we are 1.5 k members. All out there to help eachother and others. In game and out with anything. Its become more that a gaming community but more a family!
---
It was the ram jam one, fit the current situation quite nicely
---
And we all know fortnite is bad and invented that concept /s
---
Not sure why people dislike the game so much.
---
....You started this entire thing asking why people don’t use the T-65. And people are telling you why. And telling you why it’s not the best.
---
Plasma guns never dropped with explosive. When they were first introduced, they were locked at 1 star and by the time they fixed it, they had patched out explosive with energy weapons. Any that exist now are not legitimate.
---
Insanely LAME!
---
Was it Fo3 or 4 where there was a vault and you had to do a quest where you were in a simulation? Maybe there's something to that storyline in 76?
---
So does that mean I’m possession of a hacked weapon then? I just found it dropped outside the Overseer’s House.
---
Fix bugs.
---
Create new content that creates bugs.
---
Kind of how it goes with an ever-evolving game.
---
IMO the community in game is better than the online community, and pretty much every other games fan base out there. In my hundreds or even thousands of hours, I could count on one hand the amount of jackasses I’ve ran into. Everyone’s usually happy to lend a hand, and with the new public team system positive relationships are rewarded even more. See you out there, fellow vault dweller!
---
5? You forgot extended mag
---
You’re welcome
---
Yes 😉👉
---
corrupt files
---
Have you ever killed a monster which changed into a legendary half way through attacking?
---
That has happened to me, and it didn't drop a legendary
---
and decontamination chambers.
---
corrupt files or bad pc /laptop ram
---
So I should take the JE?
---
Oh yeah extended, totally forgot about that... but most people don’t use that from my experience as if you play in first person it blocks the sight.
---
FFS, I hope dupers are not allowed back
---
Cool! It's good to see concept chars, themes and stories. I'm a Russian Chemist turned wrestler who is always happy and friendly to everyone he meets.
---
59, I've surpassed Zorbo and plan to finish ahead of him!
---
Yeah the ol' engine could use an update. Self reviving enemies would be a bitch though. I'm hoping the one appalachia thing makes things spicy.
---
it's just a TSE 10mm. not bad, not good. average, really. I think you'd have better results with a non-legendary fixer if you're aiming for an auto/sneak build.
---
I'd say yes, take the JE but use a trusted courier or have him drop first.
---
Probably, Todd is on his way to your house to spank you
---
Yup. That's exactly what that means
---
That's happened to me multiple times so now I wait a second or two before shooting
---
hur hur hur I'm a cool bad ass capital G gamer, casuals are bad and ruining gaming hur hur hur.
---
Oh wait only you got downvoted, wonder why?
---
I use one of those as my backup.  I enjoy it but it does break fast.
---
Seriouslys theres times he'll hit me 3 or 4 times in a row and ill freak at first thinking im under attack until i see my health hasnt moved an inch lol drives me nuts
---
Easy I'll be here in a month still playing with the shitty left over from the shit heads who quit weeks ago
---
I only put my tent up because I need to stash shit quickly! Plus it's good for other people to have a way to free up weight when it's over :D
---
Bugthesda at it AGAIN
---
How does one have 3000 hours already?
---
You’re welcome🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Happy cake day.
---
The dupers are back. All of them.
---
Why were you checking bathrooms with a MIRV Fatman equipped?
---
And this is why I have a Designated Exploration Weapon even after I’ve cleared an area.  That DEW is usually always a shotgun for best panic aiming.
---
Does Double SCORE apply to Weeklies as well? I.e. repeatable XP gain?
---
This would be great for tagging things though
---
It doesn't have a server wide alert, you have to look for it. If you see the Wolf horde event near it, it means you just missed it because it starts up right after Leader of the Pack ends.
---
It's every 45-60 minutes though, as the event timer is 15 minutes.
---
And what exactly would be cringey about going to West Virginia and living a good and decent life?
---
it is and it isn't. explosive plasma rifles are exclusive to PC and are most definitely hacked as it was impossible to roll one back when explosive energy weapons still dropped.
---
but it's not the same as those energy .50 cals, freezing fixers or handmades with splitters. I doubt Bethesda is every going to do anything about yours specifically as it's impossible (or extremely counterproductive) to filter them.
---
hell, even those gamma miniguns are still around so whatever man.
---
good question
---
I play a lot &amp; been around since beta, I've got 2994 hours &amp; ill reach the 3000 today.
---
If I were you, I’d send a ticket to Bethesda for that accidental buy. They’ll refund you.
---
Yeah if you wanna invest in the addictions
---
If an event glitches I just leave.
---
The sheepsquatch event free range glitched and the brahmin wouldn't advance, even with 3 people jangling our staffs at her.
---
And then an idiot got on mic and started demanding we do our jobs..
---
I just changed events, and teams since the idont was on my public team.
---
In BDO we called those tinfoil hat theories, mainly involving the games RNG...which is terrible. 2-5% to upgrade your gear to the highest level and it delevels or takes days to get the money to buy items that make it not delevel...or use the cash shop, why I'm not even phased by FO76 because of hating myself for playing it.
---
Still, fun game with fun combat, just if you don't like the RNG in this game you're not gonna have a good time. Could take weeks to months to save up for your BiS piece.
---
Wake up Tenno...
---
I like the yellow prototype paint.
---
The weapons and armors are completely based on luck so it’s not really fun most of the time when you can’t use the weapon you enjoy using. And yes instead of TD or FFA they encourage you to get lucky in the bush (well when all you find is a hammer and wood armor what else can you do anyways). It’s a weird mode that has its uniqueness but not attractive at all to any true FPS lovers.
---
no lifers am I right...
---
heh...
---
...
---
Mmm no you either bite bullet on the caps or go to a free one and run to where you need to go. Theres a charisma card that makes traveling cheaper
---
Thas allota guns. I just use the same ol' gatling gun I got from a drop cause it's the best I've gotten so far. Want to get a bloodied heavy to see what all the fuss is about.
---
someone just got unbanned and had like a dozen of the same explosive laser rifle in their inventory.
---
reports are all the same, "I got unbanned and my inventory wasn't wiped".
---
Been here since Beta but I am honestly ok with no text chat. 
---
Think it adds to that strangers and kindness kinda thing. 
---
Happy you've been having a good time 😁
---
Saw someone use a cryo nade for the first time today, wow, that's amazing she isn't immune to it. It was like she was in slow motion the whole time.
---
So the event does spawn once for everyone on the server every play? And there's no chance a bloodied will one shot the legendaries?
---
What I find helps is that I don't fight the queen. I feel like it's Bethesda laughing in our faces as she sponges all our ammo and shits out a nocturnal rolling pin. Fuck that.
---
Let me guess... The event was in the mire.
---
I never knew you could see your damage numbers...lmao
---
thanks man
---
Your speaking my language. This is the kinda stuff I want to see.
---
Big bosses dont need countdowns they need timers. Stages maybe, some time on the legs, chop them off now it's slow and crawling. Leaderboards. Itll create an opportunity for clans to trial it out for the top spot and more casual players unlimited time to take on a huge feat with some friends. 
---
Make Fallout Great
---
You don't go to the bathroom ready to drop a bomb? Why even go?
---
good, for the scrip pile
---
Do you have a secondary character?
---
008399 here and still suspended
---
I already got plenty of 3 star berserkers wrenches tho
---
I still need the revive an ally to Plat the main game, then clean up the Wastelanders DLC, which will probably happen prior to the plat. Gonna do it!
---
You observe its grace.
---
Just to add to this: the Pip-Boy doesn't count even though paint can be applied to it on an armor workbench
---
Get a sight on it so you can tag things from afar.
---
If you're doing a pistol build I'd reccomend a western. 44 with explosive damage if you can.
---
This will be a nice little side arm, just dont expect to be one shotting whitesprings ghouls with it
---
I have an old level 30ish character from Beta/early launch that I don't play anymore. I have played my current character exclusively since I came back in April.
---
I know they perma banned a ton of ppl but I’m also seeing photos of people with 30-40 of each duped gun soooooo
---
No, the opposite lol can
---
When people leave by themselves, game still says they are kicked
---
never dropped with explosive. its not legit but i wouldn't worry about it too much.
---
Came up on this for the first time yesterday farming Reeds for sugar along the river. Love stumbling upon these little scenes
---
I just crafted a two shot guass shotgun after finally getting to ally with the settlers.
---
Not really anymore useful in general play than my instigating combat shotgun. It's powerful, but it misses all the time in VATS, where as my combat shotgun nails stuff constantly.
---
I use a furious 50 cal for the queen etc, so i'm not sure how much i'm going to use this gauss shotgun.
---
That’s what I’m wondering, even though I already completed my weekly challenges.
---
I think that's X-01, but aesthetics is a fine reason.
---
Yeah it'll lead you to an unmarked tree stump with goodies inside, so look around when it stops walking.
---
no, just dailys. They are worth 500 instead of the regular 250
---
You are correct, it comes from forest events only.  It's a PITA, along with barbed walking cane, lead lining boxing glove, sacrificial machete and a few more.  They are top 25 rarest plans in the game, just have to grind for them.  
---
The best method I can think of is to server hop at the Flatwoods Ag. Center and do Fertile Soil over and over.  Use a Tesla rifle and it takes maybe 2 minutes.  Get your rewards, server hop and trigger it again.  Best of luck; also make sure to keep any weapon mod plans you get; might get an even trade for the spiked.
---
It really showed that duping is ok and in-game market is not important. We have all been wrong. When the next glitch surface better take advantage of it.
---
Objectively, in terms of defense, it is, isn't it?
---
W O T
---
so mine is gattling ultracite laser rifle, it chews three cores i have 18 in my inventory some are low capacity but i have noticed it does huge sqb damage i mean i can solo a 95 3star queen in seconds, is this normal my firing rate is 311, i hear that causes this?
---
Unfortunately the double score doesn’t apply to the repeatable xp challenge, only daily’s. Kind of a bummer but at least we get a nice boost from those daily’s
---
I miss the executions they had especially for the deathclaws when you wore PA they would just toss you like a rag doll it was great made them very terrifying
---
Noooooooooo :-(
---
Simp
---
We want our fo3 death claws back
---
Yeah that makes sense. 
---
Spewin though I thought I might be able to grind XP for Double SCORE.
---
Nobody ever does it so nobody will ever know
---
Only cheaters and turds are, I rather enjoyed the last week there were less griefers and trash camps.
---
or a fancylads cake
---
Place wall first, apply wallpaper then change to with window
---
&gt; I don't think you can start it again by server hopping, I'm pretty sure the 1 hour cooldown will follow you into any other server you join.
---
That's not what's happening. The event cooldown is per-server. So if you arrive into a world where somebody has already recently done it, you won't be able to trigger it again yourself until it's ready again.
---
Think of it like the cooldown on the nuke silos, it works the same way as that.
---
Congrats!  Life long WV resident here.  Roughly whereabouts are you moving to?  I'm smack dab in the middle of Huntington and Charleston.
---
Cappy Hake Day!
---
I didn't know about this. Where did you find it? 🤯
---
Yay, that makes me happy!!
---
Piss off with your trolling
---
Welcome back!
---
Your a saint. I hope you have a wonderful life. I’ve spent 2 hours trying to figure this out and you blessed me
---
just read through all the perk cards and pick ones for your play style or you can aim for that build. weapons are level locked anyway. you can change a perk card every level after 50 so unless you really mess it up you should be able to salvage your build
---
Why play legitimate when we can just wait for the next exploit and cheat our way to prizes and higher levels with no threat of consequence?
---
When you know it’s ok to print money on a home printer, you might as well join the party.
---
Legacies should have been wiped anyway.
---
Out of curiousity how do I earn a Scrapbot for my camp in the game? I dont suppose they have those too over at the SBQ?
---
I use Marsupial, Speed Demon, and Healing Factor. Make sure to get Starched Genes rank 2 and Class Freak rank 3. Starched Genes rank 2 makes your mutations never wear off and completely eliminates the chance for you to mutate from rads. Class Freak rank 3 reduces the negative side effects of the mutations by 75% so they are almost unnoticeable.
---
Is there actually a cart from skyrim in fo76? It would be a damn good easter egg if they add the exact cart and a reference to "hey, your finally awake"
---
Yep I still do the panicked running backwards from opening stalls because of the trapped doors in FO4. I don't think I've seen a single door trap like that in 76, but the fear of that tick-tick-boom lives in your heart forever.
---
Eh, after setting up my house with it I actually kinda like it. The only reason I was on the page long enough to mess up was because of how long I was thinking about. Sure today wasn't when I was planning on buying it but it worked out.
---
😂😂😂😂
---
There recipe pools. Recipes you learn from crafting/scrapping and recipes you learn from vendors. Game is not very forgiving with showing you 75/100 plans learned and the other 25 learned is from a vendor.
---
I usually share Scrapper Perk, no one complains about more junk. Scrapping laser rifles for the extra 10+ plastic each one, while farming Super Mutants, etc.
---
Does not exist but dont know why, i just accepted it a long time ago and never questioned it again 😜 on my heavy pa char i just always have my strangler pa with emergency protocols and jetpack on the arm and for stealth i have my x01 for the case but usually i just pop a stealth boy while wearing the strangler pa
---
For every 3. That's 9 points of weight. I'm not short of ammo to covert into the arrows I need. That kind of weight isn't worth holding onto, especially when you get rewarded one or two.
---
Lmao holy shit you're such a salty little bitch. Why are you so mad that idc about trap camps?
---
How many times did the punji boards get you? XD
---
These were from a Nuka Cola pack of jumpsuits available in the Atomic Shop. Included different "flavors."
---
So just a sequel to Godzilla ft Matthew Broderick, gotcha.
---
Definitely not a stealth build but throw the strongest auto receiver you can make, chuck a decent sized mag on it and make sure the barrel has something to help mitigate recoil. Add a holo sight if you want.
---
Basically you have yourself an full assault enchant pistol, so do a full auto pistol with the agility pistol perks and obviously the everything damage related and then mix an match how you please.
---
Fyi, the best weapons for stealth builds usually have Instigating(double damage if target has full health)semi auto so you get more damage per shot and you get best results with some sort of chameleon enchant on armor, stability helps too since they're usually sniper builds.
---
I'm not too familiar with being able to kill her in seconds with a gatling laser, then again I don't have a dedicated build for heavy guns. What is on your gun that makes the fire rate 311? I use a mutants gatling laser with 25% fasted fire rate and its only 227
---
Please yes. Tired of discovering I've been lugging around 40lbs of gunpowder, thinking I'm going crazy.
---
It's a white rad stag that just seems to show up randomly. I've seen it a number of time while just running around.
---
What determines who the bee qeee agros on?
---
It seems to always agro on me when I join said fight or even if I'm a little late.
---
If you search post about this you will see Bethesda is tracking it as a bug and will fix it.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_cultural_references#The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Skyrim
---
Not really, you can't cash them unless you have 3 of them, so that's extra inventory space until you do. And for 9 points of weight you can store and convert a lot more ammo points for the same space.
---
No. Its fucking boring. Give us more lategame content.
---
I miss Deathclaws being the scariest beast in the game.
---
I prefer the idea of ammo point rewards. Or bulk ammo scrap.
---
honestly getting close to being the same. I’d say i attend less than half of them that pop up, and that’s including the ones i launch lmao
---
Until it dies in 10 seconds.
---
That's really rough, sorry to hear that.
---
Good news for Bethesda though is you can spend money to make up for their persistent mistakes and issues!
---
see now that sounds pretty sweet lol ammo conservation at its finest. Imagine if you had to load your turrets with ammo lmao
---
Yeah LOL
---
So this is a continuing rumor that gets posted here once a week or so.
---
[And its completely BS](https://imgur.com/VnsmzLT)
---
You absolute fucking monster. I love it!
---
The mysterious Brahmin Shamen are apparently hard to find, but may also be a myth
---
I don’t know how the agro mechanic works.  If you are getting beat up by the queen try adding the dense mod to your chest armor or using the fireproof card at level 3.  Either of these make you basically immune to her scream attack.
---
Yes, wait till 50 bud
---
I took a solid 3 weeks off and came back stronger than ever. Would highly recommend. Outer worlds is great, witcher 3, etc.
---
When life gives you lemons..
---
look at all that cake lol... and i don't mean the pastries.
---
https://imgur.com/VnsmzLT
---
false
---
yeah it’s just aggravating when what could have been a 10 minute fight is over double that ya know, even IF the theory isn’t true, like what’s the harm in being on the ground? Scared of getting bitten by a scorched mole rat or something i guess lol
---
If kind strangers are handing out tse shotguns out of the goodness of their hearts I need to be more social. Maybe someone will admire my plucky attempt at a junkies build and drop me a J2525 Fixer.
---
Damn didn’t know I wanted this until now, I’ll be waiting Bethesda
---
exactly, i see the point of hiding up there from the adds but the adds don’t even show up in mass until she lands lol
---
Lone Wanderer doesn't help at all
---
This.
---
They are only 2 pounds of weight a pop, so its 6 pounds. But I understand the issue. But if you are only holding onto them until you return to yours or someone elses camp, its very temporary, at the worst you only hold an extra 4 pounds because you are waiting for the third. 
---
Plus you can put them into the machine to just save the points instead of immediately turning them into the ammo you want. I would say it's a better use than just tossing them.
---
Huh?
---
Yeah sure, like i’ve seen her land in the bunker before, but *significantly* less often than she lands in the open field. Just hop on the ground till she lands and when she does, hop back up to avoid the adds and get your damage in. It’s so easy
---
I’m a bloodied heavy and I use a basic 1* bloodied .50 cal for my day to day killing and it shreds, for more tanky enemies like the scorch beast queen I use a bloodied gauss mini gun and it even shreds the queen. Those will be your best options for heavies, I’ve used bloodied Gatling plasma and bloodied ultracite Gatling laser and they just don’t stack up to the .50 cal and none of them do the same damage as the gauss mini
---
Wait, so you didnt spend any atoms?
---
Not worth the weight in my inventory to lug them back.
---
You do damage to her, she flies off, adds spawn, jump on tent to not get ganked by a horde of mirelurk kings, get off when safe, repeat
---
Not a single one. I'm extremely tight with my atoms 😎😅
---
Had a good chuckle over this
---
She lands in front of the highest DPS producer, we have one guy on the bunker and the rest of us go nuts with chainsaws, takes about 30 secs to kill her.
---
Holy hell man, im rank 48 rn am i good-ish?
---
“Whoa, easy there. You've been out for a couple of days now”
---
That would have been sweet if that was the case
---
I still remember the first time one did that. Feeling all safe mowing through super mutants and ghouls. Then suddenly this one monster just grabs me in 1000 lbs of power armor and toss me like a chew toy. Scared the living hell out of me.
---
Try serverhop after you arrive. The enemies will spawn at their lowest level. Mostly
---
What system do you play on?
---
10mm takes up almost no space and converts in the ammo converter for more caps on a weight to ammo points ratio. I'm good with that.
---
:(
---
Yeah ammo points we all agree would be better because everyone choose what they want, and a better ammo converter
---
You have extra ones with those arm mods?
---

---
This is (more or less) my current build. I mostly use a cheap silenced combat shotgun and go sneak with the Chinese stealth armor (do the settlers questline and you'll get it for free).
---
I clear West Tek in about 13 mins, basically untouched...
---
Of course sometimes I switch perks and equip, it's situational.
---
As far as I know two shot shotguns ain't that great, Bloodied, Junkie, Instigating are far better, maybe even Anti Armor? 🤔
---
Think I left out the game time part on my end, as I have been playing a hella lot lately. But that's my point about the method, the season runs for another 6 weeks I think 🤔 even casuals players playing this way should be fine. Just depends how much someone wants to sacrifice their play style/adopt a new one in order to finish the pass.
---
I use T60 so I can show off my brotherhood of steel elder paint
---
What kind of sad mindset is this?
---
The limit isn't 800 items, it's 800 weight units.
---
That
---
Make glowing ones scary again
---
They have no use, they're just a cool little item to hold on to. They used to spawn in the helvetia church but they got removed I think around the time of the first fasnacht parade. The whiskey bottles used to spawn in what is now foundation, so since that got a makeover, it's  no longer possible to get them
---
Some weapons are harder to get plans for As Well
---
Steve Martin can play some good bluegrass last time I checked. :)
---
G-guys. Are- are you suggesting people would... LIE ON THE INTERNET😭
---
Add more deathclaw breeds like winged deathclaw, camouflage, digging, giant, miniature, toxic, etc variations.
---
Yeah, I think aesthetics is one of the best arguments.  I actually really like the t 65 look, so it has that going for it too.
---
Well I got the barbed one from someone pretty easily, just trading 2 3* unyielding scouts that I will never use. Im holding hope to find the others.
---
So get ready for people to get banned again for having hacked items :P
---
I had this happen both times I broke one down (on xbox) and I was confused enough to google it to see if anyone else had the issue.
---
they'll put it in, when they add gorillas into the game. Then a bunch of quests parodying planet of the apes, gorillas in the mist, instinct, king kong (or that joe movie), and finally a toss off to Captain Ron's "Gorillas/Guerrillas"
---
I think Deathclaws numbers are intentionally lower because of the scorched and general area too. Theyre like beta to Scorchbeasts. You see their hands in Poo all the time.
---
“...well shit. Ha. Ha ha ha, no.”
---
That's any battle royale, including the original movie. Having to use whatever you find is part of the core concept.
---
I have not benefitted from the duper’s nor do I care if people duped things. It doesn’t affect me. I don’t like the items they were dupping and just wouldn’t do that sort of thing even if I did. 
---
What I was tired of, personally, was the people bragging about it and then complaining when they were banned. Like you didn’t know what the consequences could be. 
---
In the end it’s not like it affects anyone unless they choose to partake of it.
---
If there are no other options to actually remove the issues then yeah some might try and soften the blow by giving away money or exp but the games stability and ability to actually be played as intended comes before a couple of days of progress.
---
This is one of those ‘mad cause bad’ situations.
---
Please tell me you haven't already completely filled your stash in only 1 day...
---
Yeah I was aware it was a weekly but still a big community turnout after a ban would still make it tick over nicely.
---
I kinda hoped that they'd double it though. Makes sense to do it.
---
I vote for grafton monster in the bathroom itself. It would make his oil/gunk tossing a billion times more gross
---
I often get it after I've played Nuclear Winter. I like that bug.
---
I’ve got a bloodied auto grenade launcher, and that thing truly does do work with no explosive perks. Breaks a little fast sometimes it seems, but, fun to run around and blow stuff up with.
---
New vegas was the prime of the deathclaw, to any new player to the game (who didn't know how to cheese them with the weathered 10mm) they were unbeatable until you were basically max level. In fallout 4 they were complete pushovers and that really upset me, they looked terrifying but you could kill them with a shotgun with little difficulty fairly early on
---
Because you can sleep soundly.
---
I always equip scrapper after Line in the Sand. I go around and gather up all the loot from all the piles. I usually end up carrying 800 extra pounds of stuff. then I equip the perk and head upstairs and start scrapping. The other day I ended up with 2k steel just from that one event.
---
Sometimes just the sound of the spoon stiring the pot in the small stove compels me to make a sandwich.
---
I just recently came back to the game since release and I have these. I swear I never paid for them though. Did they ever have a promo where they gave them away?
---
The paints can be applied to leather, metal and combat armor.
---
I blame the budget % per item. Large statues and structures costing as much as a wall poster, or a small potted plant. 
---
That's why 90% of the houses you see in public sessions are gross medium/large houses at max budget with mostly empty rooms.
---
Also for anyone saying the servers can't handle a large size camp. You can make a camp 2-3 times the normal camp just in a workshop. The budget is insane in them. I sometimes go to workshops and build a dream house for fun.
---
Charleston
---
You're a little bit behind but nothing serious. Just keep going and I think you'll barely make it. If possible grind exp for a day.
---
Ya I hear a lot of people like the t51 but I like the t60s look. Also the BOS paint is exclusive for the t60 and it took me months and hundreds of technical data’s for it so I’m super attached
---
Same here! But let's not forget compared to fallout 3 and new Vegas the sentry bots man, those things are menacing to look at
---
Dude. I don't have first and I store my gunpowder in my box 'cus it's so damn heavy. If you honestly can't store any gunpowder, you may want to cut back on your junk.
---
I’ve done this....more times than I care to admit. I’ve sometimes even thought in my head “okay press A to pick that up” and I go WAIT NO! I can pick things up without buttons! 
---
Fallout 76 is the future 😂
---
Nice thank you for the info
---
Every time I've tried it in the Bog the SB appears outside the event area on the ground. I just leave, shoot at it a bit and it runs over to play ball. Definitely bugged.
---
Details please
---
I have. And have what I have because of people helping out.  Level 378 and playing since BETA and have the worst luck on drops of anyone I’ve ever met   Now have the weapons I want to keep playing.  I’m old and would not have any ideal on how to dupe anything myself
---
Your logic is entirely flawed. Your argument is the equivalent of saying the reason people steal is because things are too expensive, and until we make things less expensive people are just going to keep stealing and that's justified
---
Naw, I'd take 100 Slocum joe vendors to one Sofia aka captain headache, if you're only going to program 3 lines of dialogue maybe don't set it on a 15 second loop
---
People like you make this game a lot better. Thank you!
---
thank you, much appreciated
---
Literally??
---
In 76 you can use mutations and legendary weapons to one shot most enemies, the deathclaws are held back by their attack animations, and they are easily crippled/killed by most low level players. In NV there were no two shot explosive bloodied builds that could take the sbq out with a pipe pistol. Nv deathclaws actually made you feel nervous. I just swat 76 deathclaws like flies with my power first
---
i was so confused by this the first day too lol. i did so many damn dailies and it never moved. then i figured it out and felt dumb.
---
Yea but its fine on 3rd person since it shoots slow enough to not spread much. Also just checked and there are 7 available mods. We forgot the speedy receiver and the prime receiver.
---
"asking for a friend"  you say?
---
All respect to you man, I don’t mean you any offense, ( and I agree that Bethesda isn’t doing the best job with managing duper’s and hackers) but your friend and people like him are the root of the problem, not Bethesda’s devs. Most people that I have talked with and ever played with have never used a duplication glitch or has friends who use them. Duplicating items are not the majority of ways the people get the best legendaries or their scrip. Duplication may help people, but it is inherently a bad thing and a problem that should be removed from the game.
---
God I just threw up a little reading this
---
Laughs in scrapbox
---
eh, being able to see is overrated. Just seek out your enemies by smelling their fear!
---
I had a level 3 dog for a couple of months.
---
After they fixed the 3rd person faster fire rate glitch it had, I got rid of mine so I’ve completely forgotten what mods it had it seems.
---
Personally, I rather have Fallout 76 get rid of the S.C.O.R.E. board and replace it with a S.C.O.R.E. vendor for the next S.C.O.R.E. event.  So instead of going through 50 ranks for the Raider Tree, I can purchase it first and ignore useless items that will never be used.  The vendor would include Lunchboxes, Bullion, Fireworks, and/or Scrip. So if I want to buy 200,000 S.C.O.R.E. worth of Fireworks, then I should be able to.  I certainly don't need 8 versions of Ghillie Armor skins or 7 versions of Atomic Onslaught Power Armor skins.
---
Sadly I saw it in the PTS patch notes. At least we have until August 4th. 😔
---
Bethesda: Yep seems to be working perfectly
---
Hop away young buck
---
This is my favorite event. All the explosions and craziness is so cool and memorable fights moments can happen too. Great story friend!
---
That would be pretty badass.
---
It does suck, its happened to me twice &amp; now I won't trade with someone I don't know unless they go first. Don't mention any names here, it will get you banned -as it did me when I named a scammer.
---
Was a nice surprise to look at the photo and see the scorched flying thru the air :)
---
Oh yea I wouldn't pay much attention to it either if I didn't have one that was good for fighting the queen
---
I just fought a colossus with some other people as well.  It was pretty fun, but the loot sucked.
---
Just make sure you are searching in the right location:
---
It seems like spawn areas for the witch and skeleton costumes are now in the Savage divide. For whatever reason, the 'ski outfit plan' locations and the Halloween costume plan locations have switched places. You can no longer find the Halloween costumes in the mire.   
---
I would recommend looking up old videos on where to find the 'ski outfit plan'. These videos will show several locations in the salvage divide including: Central Mountain Lookout, Dent &amp; Sons construction, and Johnson's Acre. When you search these spawn points, you can run into one of three Halloween costumes: vampire, witch, or skeleton. The vampire does not give any plans but the other two do (although it is not guaranteed).
---
Looks about right. Bless their souls.
---
Thats 6 hours of play... almost a whole workshift...
---
Because your “best” is your opinion, period.
---
Just as not everyone uses the same weapons/armor, not everyone wants to use the same power armor. It just depends o what you are trying to do. 
---
I play 95% solo and usually run around in my near costume and use my excavator armor when over encumbered. Otherwise I don’t use it, therefore I consider my excavator armor the “best”.
---
Thanks found that out after a day at 65. I have had the best luck at sent and sons, one witch one vampire
---
Pioneer Scout Black Powder Rifle paint
---
Ill probably play for 12 hours today, nil work till Tuesday.
---
It‘s because nobody gives a shit. You want us to applaud you or something?
---
You should have waited untill the last week. Gotten as far as you could by playing, and then bought what you needed to finish the run. Would have saved you a lot of atoms
---
Yea that’s what you’d expect in this mode, but because there’s such large gap between different weapon types in FO76, luck becomes the deciding factor. It’s not like G20 vs M4 in other games, it’s often knife vs 50 cal in NW.
---
Use a courier or stop going first. Lol
---
How do you place Items in your camp? I’ve seen people talk about it but idk how
---
First thing I must mention is workshops are pvp zones.  Always have been.  Stay out of workshops if you don't like pvp.
---
Now that is out of the way I will say that Bethesda has created a lot of unnecessary issues with pvp.  Instead of some sort of mode selection/toggle/whatever to enable or disable pvp they just made the whole system lame and untactical and helped no one.  
---
How I feel it should have been : Set status off/on before entering adventure mode.  Pvp on - your name is in a different colour so you can see who you can attack, can take workshops, don't need to shoot and be shot by another team just to play how you want.  Pvp off - you cannot be attacked, cannot take workshops, if someone in your group has pvp on you are not dragged into it and can play how you want.  
---
Or bring back a better made survival mode but I guess that is too hard as well.
---
I based my build off this video - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOhE3SprXCU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOhE3SprXCU)
---
Wow great advice, thank you for your insightful input.
---
I go for the steel, easy way to get 400 to 500 minimum with bad spawns and scrapper, plus mole miners give 140ish xp
---
Yh of curse,  but i didnt buy any Atoms until yesterday and i wanted 2 finish it as early as possible 😁
---
Yesterday it sprinted the whole way to the event area, from one of the fissure. It took some time :)
---
Thank you ☺️
---
Finally... someone with the guts to help
---
By best, I mean best defense, I just didn't want to spoil "t-65" in the title.  It is the *best* in defense.  Which is what *armor* is for.
---
on second thought... I second this motion!
---
I won’t say the name but I wonder how they feel after scamming, prolly pretty crappy.
---
That's not true! I have been 'getting gud' every time I play! I have improved my skill at finding the right bush and trying to avoid fighting players. 
---
Also I got good at running. Like really good - not quite good enough to outrun a bullet or laser beam, but still.
---
It may not be the case for others, but I found that if I looted the Holotape from one of the corpses, that the corpse spawns were much less frequent thereafter, at least if I didn’t drop the Holotape before hopping server. Hope that helps.
---
I hear you .tse handmade is a good piece.i gifted the one I had a few weeks ago to a level 49 I ran across.i stopped trading w people in game unless they go 1st or what ever they want is something I dont care about.sorry to hear you got scammed it's just too easy to abuse the systems
---
I honestly reframe from trading objects in this game. There alot of good people in this game, but if you have something rare or trying to get something rare, the guys who have it are most likely fishy.
---
Bohooo cry me a river you jealous kid
---
he did you a favor, TSE is hot garbage.
---
the trick is... not to trade with things you dont want to get scammed out of lmao.
---
Doubt it, they probably do it over &amp; over again.
---
Yeah I could see that
---
I was really only there to get events done for score and also I'm going to have to do it again for more score as that's one of my weekly's. I just wish it wasn't a shoot first ask questions later situation and I wouldn't have to lose my scrap in that situation.
---
I'm at level 47 I think but have 5k atoms ima go till the last week just to see how far I can get.rather save my atoms in case they drop some thing good in the store
---
What you saw was a server cycling down, just join another one.
---
It just works
---
What is meat week?
---
its a free country, being a chump aint illegal
---
Lol nonsense. Shouldn’t profit from cheating
---
1. The tse wasn’t for me it was for my friend, he’s new and wanted a tse fun really bad 2. When trading don’t you want nothing to be scammed? You’re literally telling me to just not trade
---
ur gonna hop hop right into todds ban hammer going that illegal shit.
---
I'd rather have a shit ton of Bloodied fixers, handmades, legacies and the awful Red Asylum dress on the market than the circle-jerk it was before surrounding all these and other items, where the only way to get one was to buy for real money or trading a bunch of previously duped items. It was not uncommon to see people 'paying' 1000 or more of each stable flux or 10.000 large gifts (yes, you read that right) for a Red Asylum dress or an Explosive Fixer. 
---
The game economy was broken way before this month's dupe craze, at least more people can get them for caps now.
---
I will add to this, if you hate pvp and have a workshop daily claim the workshop in stealth and enter build mode near the edge of the boundary to do it.  No need to click on the bench. Skip the defend mission, it shows on the map for everyone.  You will eventually get a mission to retake the workshop which only shows for you, do that in stealth instead if you want an easy mission completion.  If you are just there to gather resources, you can get them much faster exploring, don't bother with the workshop.
---
Last night we had a fight and out of 10-15 people there, I was the ONLY one on the ground. All the rest were perched on the fence like a bunch of pigeons or on top of a tent. It was infuriating. She stayed airborne for most of the fight.
---
And would you believe it, when it was clear she was aggroed on me can you guess what happened??? That's right, she landed promptly and we downed her lickety-split. 
---
I know this is a hotly debated topic and opinions seem to go back and forth but to me it seems clear. Stay on the ground if you can and it will be a relatively quick fight.
---
B5025 fixer and handmade. What’s that got to do with duper’s being allowed to keep their chested weapons exactly?
---
Thanks I read that to, I'm staying away from that Holo tape like the plague
---
Very friendly ;)
---
I edited the post so there’s details of u want to see them
---
Only go threw the trading sub. If you're uncomfortable get a courier. I've done hundreds of trades and never been scammed. You just need to be smart about it.
---
Honestly they probably feel like they just hit the lottery.the system is too easy to abuse.i avoid trading unless it's someone from the trade reddit or group. Sucks but it is what it is..we have a good community but the small percentage that sucks often gets attention
---
It did this to me until I rebuilt by database, on 3 different occasions
---
This is why I don't use public toilets.
---
How you know dupers are allowed back?
---
Todd blessed the lot by the mall, if you think white springs is good try there...
---
Just bad rng I guess, because once I got that plan, I unlocked all my desired mods very quickly and ended up selling 20+ rifles I had left over once my caps reset.
---
This thru the Trade Sub?
---
Perhaps the Slocum Joe vendors are what are causing her headaches....
---
I just spent my fallout 1st atoms to level up 10 times. if it makes you happy &amp; doesn't hurt anyone else - go for it :)
---
Lol
---
what about that scribe's automated transmission during line in the sand? "you've got a HUGE and i mean HUGE wave of scorched on the way, brace for it!"
---
I don't think it should be junk because it's not.
---
It shouldn't weigh as much as it does though on the other hand
---
I agree that most of the community is good, because I’ve done around 20 trades and haven’t gotten scammed, but this one time I got unlucky.
---
👍😁
---
Nah, I would’ve reported him if it was
---
Wondering about how much a slice goes for 👀
---
Keep in mind, you can 'scrap' down all your junk items to change them into just the usable crafting materials. This will drastically reduce their weight. 
---
To do just, just go to any crafting station and it should give you the option.
---
I will post about this everyday until my last breath.
---
The Nuka cherry paint? Was a twitch prime reward
---
How's Ricochet? On paper doesn't sound better than Serendipity, what am I missing? 🤔
---
Yeah it's enough to make you jump.
---
Fucks sake... I used to try defend Bethesda. Now I just pull the ghillie over my eyes and pray they'll make it stop.
---
Bloodied faster fire rate LMG is pretty good.
---
Well, if this comes out, I will have to rename my character name to Harambe
---
Yeah, true.
---
I had this happen for me the first time today and after looking through posts about I had an idea. I got inside my power armor then got out of it again and that seemed to make the problem go away. Figured I would post here since it may work for you as well.
---
It gets even lighter as normal too
---
Have to ask I came across that same gun on a trade forum b explosive tesla not sure if the last perk is the same but how good is it if you already have a decent explosive laser.not the gatling laser but a exolosive laser rifle?are they about the same?
---
Just rng man
---
The presents.... Presents everywhere....
---
(Nah it's all over the net)
---
I want to see boss levelled a bunch of creatures. Then maybe I can witness the ultimate battle of Alpha Deathclaw VS Mega Mothman.
---
They’re both horrible the only good legacy is the   be flamer that guns a tank.
---
I quit to desktop from Ingame and never had a reset. This isn't it.
---
Lool oh okay then Idm Atleast the lobby’s won’t be flooded by low lvls anymore
---
Cards don't stack. If every single person on the team shared inspirational three everybody would have inspirational three one time and that's it. If everybody was sharing different ranks of inspirational, then everybody would have one instance of whatever the highest rank being shared was, and that's it. It makes infinitely more sense for everybody to be sharing a different card then the rest of the team to make sure that everybody gets the maximum amount of benefits
---
My friend (whose new) opened the bathroom stall and got blown up to pieces at the airport.
---
The game has come a long way in preventing bad actors from griefing. It's definitely a good place for passive playing with others. Been also playing since beta and prefer solo. Not seeing or hearing others makes it great.
---
It seems like you didn't understand completely what I was trying to say. First of all, I didn't say that absolutely everybody cheat because of that one reason. Second, I said that the game design is flawed (hence the "disease") and many (but not all) people are cheating to make the game more enjoyable, while circumventing the tedious and unfun parts using cheats. Third, I said that the devs need to make the game more interesting and rewarding (cure the disease), this way people will feel less incentive to cheat in the first place. (that's elimination of symptoms because the disease will be cured)
---
I love this one, if you kill the chicken he is so happy. He’s all like take the meat I’m a vegetarian too.
---
I tank sbq as unarmed bloody. Like as in I am the person single handedly holding agro so the rest of my squad can cryo/b gauss mini/unarm it down. If your on xbox I can screenshot my cards for you
---
Ok I had my eye on that one and the other just didnt want to jump in yet.would you still choose a be flamer over something like vampires ex flamer w reduced weight?
---
Whitespring is acknowledged as one of the best farming locations, despite many nerfs.
---
If ur a bloodied build then yeah
---
Replace the word cheating with stealing and replace the word game with world and you have just said exactly what I said you were saying
---
Quality content right there, amazing.
---
Just bad luck. I hope there will be another rifle type added with the bos updates &amp; you'll be able to craft with legendary modules. But wait &amp; see.
---
Do u know what rolls are best for the bloodied heavy? Like explosive or ffr?
---
My flamer 1 hits a lot of crap and it a rlly fun gun, I can get it to do around 500 damage
---
Yes, this is my side arm, best to have an armor penetrating mag and strongest auto receiver, chews through ammo though
---
My friend got unbanned yesterday, she sent me a message around 9pm, I'm happy for her.
---
I have recently *got* 76. It took me from beta til now to get hooked but it finally happened.
---
It should be a long &amp; epic fight. I hate the opposite where it's over in less than 1 minute because of a few people with OP gear &amp; builds.
---
My melee bloodied build sucks, yet it feels balanced. I'm often always on the brink of death, and I do a lotta damage. It has the same feel of dark souls to a degree. Deal a lot of damage, take a lot of damage.
---
That being said, a meta bloodied build where you can tank damage sounds fun, but definitely boring (not only for you, but everyone else on your team as well).
---
I can confirm. My account suspension was lifted today and everything is still there. 2 strikes and a slap on the wrist.
---
World record is 5 seconds. Most endgame teams with a proper knowledge of her flight/landing mechanics can typically clear her in less than 2 minutes. Our 4 man record is    1 minute and 21 seconds.
---
How did a weapon get stolen by an npc? Serious question I really would like to know
---
Glad I'm not the only one getting burnout.  I've only been logging in to do the daily C.H.O.R.E.S , then logging out.
---
I used to play this game to relax.  Now it's just ticking off boxes after a long shift at work and heading to sleep.  
---
I'm hoping they will consider leaving weeklies open in the next season.  I want to do this in my own time and not feel forced to do it daily.
---
My friend got unbanned yesterday, I'm happy for her.
---
Yes. I'm calling the cops on you for illegal server hopping! 
---
...but seriously no you can't. Nothing wrong with that. Although if you're after something there are probably quicker and easier ways to get it.
---
Well, let’s keep looking then
---
Also the b2525 and BE fixers are amazing
---
It can't do all of this silently &amp; without showing all the relevant alerts?
---
Seems like such a basic thing to hide.
---
The other thing
---
haha yeah that's one is interesting too!
---
just for the pipe pistol?
---
Yeah so I can scrap it and get the suppressor mod
---
Thanks mate!
---
I suggest something similar a while back but with break off points at certain spots where you can exit. Kind of like a risk-reward thing where you could go deeper for more xp &amp; loot but if you die, you lose all your loot (not just junk) &amp; have to return to the start to begin again.
---
When doing a event before the patch but it happened to me before the patch when you die a npc will loot your inventory for the most powerful weapon and you can't get it back it was a thing all the back in fallout 4
---
Try doing a run to WT or WS with a dragon ...
---
Are you on xbox?
---
Suppressor for? In any way, you could craft the lowest level of the gun you need and scrap it to get your mods. There's no need to mod them before scrapping.
---
Is your "friend" OK that you're narcing on him?
---
I’d actually be cool with it just being in the ammo category since that’s how it is listed on the chemistry work bench. It’s such an easy item to make though, just wish it was categorized differently.
---
Scrapping an item with a mod doesn’t unlock the mod.  It’s random.  Just keep scrapping you’ll unlock it soon enough
---
Or the person in your team joins them confused emote
---
it’s about realistic I guess
---
Honestly I couldn't give less of a shit about this latest money grab, I'll get what I get but it's a ridiculously thin attempt to suck more money out of people with no QOL improvements. WTF they still haven't split NW into solo quads..
---
They'd more likely be promoted. That's Bethesda management level thinking there
---
I took a break after seeing a large stack of firewood outside a gas station (IRL) and my mind immediately going to FO76.
---
It's not that I thought I should go over and harvest the wood to take back to the game or anything crazy like that - but seeing a pile of wood outside like that is just about as average a sight as it gets and my mind was conditioned to go there.
---
I’m looking gun suppressors. Do they come randomly?
---
Sorry for your loss. I got scammed last week. It didn’t feel good. But then I remembered that the scammers are pretty sad and pathetic when it comes to things. I mean really, they gotta resort to taking advantage of other people’s trust and good will. That’s bottom-feeder, scumbag tactics right there.
---
Again, sorry for your loss but don’t let a scumbag get you down. If they gotta resort to scamming to get good gear, their real lives are probably worse than their victims’s real lives.
---
It doesn't fit any of the requirements to be classified as junk.  It's neither a base scrap component nor can it be scrapped down into one.  That's why like ore it gets classified as misc.
---
You don't really learn the mod the gun have, just a random one.
---
So, as already said, craft lvl 1 pipe pistol (or loot them, not exactly rare stuff...), scrap, learn mods.
---
Megasloth that must be protected
---
Adds to list of things to try
---
think serendipity is for bloodied builds. Ricochet works at full health. the sound effect gets a little annoying though
---
EDIT: here is what I am currently running. I just rolled this char and got him to 50 on the double xp weekend, so just using vanilla gear at the moment

Oh so even if it’s not equipped with the mod that I want, it will still drop?
---
Their Nuke, their choice. They can nuke wherever the hell they want. This is America.
---
I thought they stacked and that's why everyone was sharing stranger in numbers
---
Way cool. Hopefully Bethesda will take stuff like this srly when they make future titles. Lots of beautiful history and culture in every state and a lot of ppl might not realize it’s perfect for them. Would be nice if they could start mixing some pre-war beauty back into America
---
For the love of God please don't hoard toilet paper. There is plenty to go around
---
Not exactly that. But yeah, the world as well is based on a flawed system where artificial scarcity is promoted to be a main paradigm and that people really need to work hard just to get tiniest part of the planetary resources (basically being slaves for the ones who get maximum profit from their efforts), that are available in such abundance,that if being distributed effectively would be enough for absolutely everyone. There would be no need in stealing if the majority of the resources won't be concentrated in hands of a rather small cohort of the richest people and were distributed evenly for everyone's sake.
---
Edit: I presume you base on the assumption that how the world works is totally fair and flawless, but it really is not. Hence the misunderstanding of the whole disease/symptoms concept.
---
Not even remotely close to how any event works... ever...
---
Sorry for your loss.
---
Seems like more scamming has been going on lately. 
---
My theory is that with the recent d00ping, it wrecked real money traders. So now they’re out here hustling and scamming good gear trying to recover their pathetic means of income. That’s just a theory, though. Lol.
---
The first time I was max caps I bought a serum recipe from the enclave. Whenever I noticed a nuke zone I farmed the flux and stabilized it. Then I crafted serums. Three serums sell for 1300 caps at the robot vendor. Do this for enough days and you are at max. Then I started doing this on all five characters, eventually I was max on five and started buying ammo. So today I basically always have 30k on each character and a shit ton of ammo. Totally doable, just takes time. (I now buy the stable flux from a guy I know for 150 caps, so the profit is like 300caps per)
---
 I was lucky enough to trade up to a b2525 fixer when that glitch was rampant.will try and get a be flamer next to play around with
---
Seriously?
---
Riding Shotgun is at least one guaranteed legendary (almost always a three star at that) and you're almost guaranteed to be able to trigger it within two server hops at most.
---
Exactly
---
All I do is the ore run but each time I have, you guys in the centre don't hold up you end &amp; the event fails.
---
Also, this is a Bethesda problem, not a player one. The system is at fault because the farmers are rewarded fail or succeed. You'd be a moron for doing all the work &amp; still having a high chance of not getting anything for the rad-x/radaway you spend
---
Calm down Satan
---
I'd happily send her floating in space forever... Because She's annoying.
---
Your the idiot getting scammed over and over and over.
---
Either listen to advice or you're going to keep making this mistake.
---
Complaining wont help.
---
Did you meet your scammer on this sub?
---
No?
---
You're crying and complaining to the wrong people.
---
Yes, they are random once you scrap a weapon.
---
Am I a pair of Fluffy Sooks or some Dress Sooks?
---
I love it when the tent makes them all spawn in middle just cant seem to get it to work myself
---
Only certain mods are tied to vendors.  But suppressors will always unlock. I think it takes a certain amount of scraps though as it will never be your first few unlocks (in my experience)
---
Just farm Morgantown airport and train yard.  Scrap every gun.  You’ll unlock a bunch of stuff
---
yes what kind of plebs make ammo LOL
---
*me, level 200, farming lead and steel daily to feed my bullet hungry heavy guns*
---
I believe if you unplug him he'll still sell like a regular vending machine does with power off
---
Toe sooks maybe?
---
You’ve never played NW.
---
Rainbow Toe Sooks!
---
Suggest you try duplicating language and grammar skills.
---
that would explain where I got it from. Thank you because I know I didn't spend atoms on it
---
EDIT: I am at work and could not actually see the photo as they block imgur
---
Id say it depends on what you use it against. Explosive is pretty good, but not good against the queen, as she is quite resistant against explosive damage. Personally I use explosive for mob control ( except close quater places like the whitespring golf club ) and FFR for for close quaters and Queen fights.
---
Find a less popular place, seriously. 
---
If you stay on world, it just doesn’t place your camp, then you can put down a new camp for free. If you switch worlds, it waits until you can then spawns your camp as usual.
---
its a word that means cry baby like 90% of the people in here are
---
You bet, I only knew because I collect Nuka stuff and it was a big hassle to get the paint
---
My son merged a toilet &amp; a chair, why not have a toilet you can sit on.
---
Wow! Dupers downvoting hard on this one
---
Nice thanks for the info 👍
---
Yes that is correct. Escape Artist is what i meant. :)
---
I dont really like nuclear winter, Ive had an occasional good match with good people and we win but usually just end up in a bush for xp. I wish they would stop pumping content into it like the occasional event with shit I want in it. Or the dailies, screw the dailies Ill sit in a bush for 20 minutes once a day if I must (I can do other shit during it) but why in gods name do I need to find 5 bloatflies to kill? I wish they would stop supporting it but then again I hope they don't because there is a few things I do want from the normal leveling up in it. If they ever stop supporting it they'd probably remove it and I'd never get that stuff. As of now I'm slowly ranking up because of the support it gets. So I guess I'm okay with it even though I hate it.. sigh.
---
The best pattern for feet gloves!
---
As long as u don’t move it and it remains not on the server your in. It just comes back exactly the same on the next server u join
---
Nice Todd Howard's bane... Good for script 😀
---
Best place imo.  Bad place to find cobalt though.  Under rated place is Morgantown - lots of cobalt.  Also a decent amount of ghouls spawn south near the port side pub area 
---
I think I’ve only seen 4-5 places nuked ever.  Don’t think I’ve ever seen Ash Heap nuked.  Or anywhere really in savage divide outside of Whitesprings
---
“You’re a piece of scrap. That mean I like you.”
---
Don’t feed the troll guys. He’s only got a little while before computer time is over for the day and then its back to his chores and getting beaten by his dad.
---
Me too!! That was my first merge, glad to see someone else had the same idea!
---
i love duping and the fact that i got unbanned within 24 hrs of my suspension with all of my items had 100s of be bffrs and b2525 weapons all i can say is thanks bethseda and me being able to sell them for rmt
---
You're welcome man
---
Unless you're flux farming Whitespring is mostly a waste of a nuke and there's better places for that too. Super mutants are higher xp earners and legendary spawns are RNG. It's one of the better places if you're not nuking prime but I wouldn't get this excited about it.
---
For the millionth fucking time... stash limits do not exist just to fuck with you or force you to buy 1st or any of that bullshit, they're there to provide a soft cap on the maximum number of item ids that the servers need to load every time you open up your stash.
---
The more stash space Bethesda gives us the more strain we're putting on the server and the more lag you're going to have every time you look inside your stash.
---
The stash limit increases we've already gotten were incremental based on Bethesda seeing how much they could push the limit and we're not going to see another increase in any shape without their figuring out a way to optimize how things work to reduce the load.
---
Um... Mostly different people in each group but ok
---
Mirelurk cake sound yummy
---
Dude they just fully endorsed duping. Server hopping is fine
---
someones a bit annoyed glad you fell for my troll and yea you are feeding my addiction to troll please keep going give me more fuel for the fire
---
What level? I'm 389 and still forget sometimes haha
---
The SB always appears, it just rarely appears where it's supposed to.  You'll find it glitched out stumbling around not too far outside the event area, just piss it off to get its attention and eventually it will pop out of existence and reappear at the event.
---
Completely true. In a perfect world nobody would want to steal. But I find it incredibly unlikely that if somebody stole from you that you would be trying to make hollow justifications for it. 
---
Breaking the rules is breaking the rules. There is no valid justification for it, especially in a multiplayer game. If you feel inclined to cheat in a single player game where it doesn't actually affect anybody besides yourself, that's your prerogative and I'm not going to try and tell you how to have fun if it doesn't cause anybody else problems. 
---
This is not that game. The choices a player makes has consequences that affect the entire community. The consequences of cheating can range anywhere from players being able to kill the scorchbeast queen too fast due to having hacked weapons thereby ruining the opportunity for other players to get Rewards, to in this specific instance of duping tanking in already fragile economy by flooding the market with a surplus of items devaluing everything that isn't something that should be exceedingly rare.
---
Imagine if all of a sudden the recognized currency in whatever Nation you are from was suddenly worthless because the diamond cartels that have been withholding the supply of diamonds to artificially drive up their value suddenly flooded the market causing a worldwide economic disaster. That's what dupers are doing right now to the economy in Fallout 76. Weapons that by All rights should sell for 1 or 2,000 caps can't even be sold at a hundred caps per star because the availability of valuable items like be 25/ 15 fixers is far higher than it should be
---
Edit to add: I just realized how much of a rant this became and I'm actually working right now, so it's possible it may need some proof reading and I we'll have a glance over it when I get a chance
---
"You are among the lowest life forms on earth"
---
I'm just asking people to be courteous haha
---
That's terrible. If your on PC you can edit your ini file to save your game progress every 1 minute.
---
 \[SaveGame\]  
---
Setting to 1.0 (mins) is recommended to not lose your progress. 
---
I forget what default is, but when stuff like that happens you want it saving as often as possible. This has saved my ass lengedaries more than once due to server crashes or straight crash to desktop.
---
I reported a guy for the same reason and they didn’t even answered my ticket... still “awating response” status. I’ll post a screenshot of the guy if I find it.
---
I hope the season goes on for long enough.  I just started playing fo76 again and I hope I'll actually be able to finish it in time.  I'm only rank 17 or something.
---
It's just that "18% chance to bounce back *some* damage" sounds a bit weak to me, will have to try it out eventually...
---
Don't think I could manage a serene life in the wasteland without weight reductions perks. Of course I can take them out for serious fights...but there's not many... 🙄
---
Get Fix it Good and Weapon Artisan, repairing things to 200% gives you 8 perk points to spend elsewhere imho. 😊
---
The danger of deathclaws in 4 is mostly gone because 76 removed all of the kill animations, and stun animations from enemies like bloodbugs, and deathclaws.  So, deathclaws can't grab you from behind as you're fleeing from them, or roar in your face and then proceed to slam you in the ground.  They even had a variant for that same attack if you were wearing power armor, or in third person.  The lack of stun animations from deathclaws is also why engaging in melee against them is suddenly a viable strategy since you can simply block their attacks, but previously in Fallout 4, you could only block for so long before it gets pissed and just picks you up and throws you with an animation attack.
---
If creatures had their kill animations back, a lot of bloodied players would probably be in for a world of hurt, since if I'm not mistaken, kill animations were percentage based, so provided the attack was strong enough and the enemy had low enough life, you could be stuck in one and be sentenced to death.  That would mean a lot of people would suddenly find their jugulars being bitten out by feral ghouls, or being mauled to death by a hungry yao guai.
---
Because it’s shit IMO.It takes a hella bullion to obtain,resources to build and it looks like ass.
---
I’d much rather use my T-51b or X-01 than walk around in that expensive Luis Vuitton pierce of armor.
---
Recently I was in West Tek and there was a naked bugged super mutant who kept like teleporting around the bathroom near the entrance... any time I turned my back on him he teleported into a stall, near a urinal, near the sink, etc. It was creepy and hilarious and I'm glad it happened. It was a good jump scare until I realized what was happening.
---
It looks good, I think, but you can also change it to one of the presets from the atom shop.
---
Big props to you OP.  For every 100 people that say they want to move, only 3-4 actually go through with it.
---
Enjoy Appalachia my friend
---
What he said
---
&gt;The next offense will most likely be taken seriously for those who abused the system.
---
You realise this isn't the first time Bethesda has banned anyone in this game?
---
I don't see this ever changing. Unless the cheating directly affects their revenue or opens them up to liability, I see it remaining soft well into the foreseeable future.
---
Well I signed up for Fallout 1st and the adventurer tent is a godsend. I just plunk it down and offload whatever I am carrying. To me, shotguns without gunsmith is unbearable. Just seemed like my gun was breaking too fast.
---
Like the video implies, it's a lazy build. It definitely will not outperform a bloody or junkie build
---
Slocum Joe vendor scares me sometimes
---
I know right? I am always dumbfounded to see these posts coming up about an event that I don't even bother with because I see no reason to.  I am able to clean out the scrip machine just fine without Uranium fever.
---
Goooooo get it all, I did. It was a miserable amount of bush wookieing for xp. But yeah you'll get all the halloween stuff at 14k xp earned cuz its accumulative but the xmas stuff the xp restarts after each reward so youll have to get an additional 7k xp once you get the armor skin then anothrr 14k once you get the beanie.
---
It’s a random encounter like the pied piper eye bot or the mysterious pipe. I’ve seen him in the ash heap so I  followed him until he stopped and there was a tree stump with a bunch of stuff inside. I got a bunch of caps, chems, and plans.
---
You learn mods by scrapping weapons even if they have no mods.
---
Is hip fire accuracy reflected in the accuracy number? For example my handmade has like 96 accuracy and my 10mm smg has 52 or something much lower. The 10mm smg is fairly difficult for me to use without VATS honestly while the handmade WAS better before. I was trying out a bloodied radium rifle yesterday and it was so much more accurate than either even though the accuracy is listed at 64 or something.
---
I mean if you don't want it I'll take it off your hands for yah lol
---
preach, friend
---
Well, it's official, you have done what we like to call the "Bethesda Full Circle"
---
Does it only work for drops? Or it also works with pipe pistols I can craft
---
I'm legit mad the only way to crank them UP is by turning up all effects. I love his little tune but I dont want bugs screaming in my ears. Then again I fucking love the fasnacht parade song too &gt;:-)
---
It was long and epic a year ago. It’s a chore now, let’s end this as quickly as possible please
---
Should have changed to sun kissed if they complained
---
Got most of the ideas from reddit:
---
Mounted radstag on a dart board looks cool. Anything that hides the base works well. 
---
[Resort mirror with mounted wendingo](https://imgur.com/lKXT1WL) looks like its crawling out of the mirror from hell. This one took me like an hour of fiddling to get right so the base is hidden, and I will never move it because of that.
---
[Halloween fog machine aligned behind a wall with a mounted sbq head](https://imgur.com/DH8bO4p) looks incredible.
---
[Red rocket statue attached to a flamer turret wired to a switch that can be activated](https://imgur.com/j4sBTCZ) for on demand fireworks. I also wired up a siren so when you hit the switch the siren plays. Second black fog machine while its off to give the appearance of engine activity. I love this one. 
---

Greedy mfers who want to min Max even shared perks
---
I had someone repeatedly kill me and destroy my base multiple times today for no reason, so that was fun.
---
Do you mean objects like Beer Steins? They require a Beer Stein Display Booth, and that’s for Steins found in the Wasteland. You can also craft and place down Steins in the workshop - they should be under either Floor Decor or Miscellanous.
---
There’s the shelf exploit as well, but that’s a fairly involved process.
---
Unfortunately no. I think a lot of people tend to share them in case the other people in their parties they get into don't have them, and when they get into a party they don't bother to check what everybody else is sharing and adjust accordingly
---
Oh yeah, 2 for missile, 1 for cannonball and 6 for mini nukes.
---
You obtained these weapons yourself as drops ?
---
People bitch about utility perks not being passive. Wouldn't this draw the exact same complaint?
---
I do this when I see desk fans - in another game or real life.
---
I tank sbq as unarmed bloody. Pop a Quan for overheal. Action boy + dodgy (alongside serendipity). Also if your a carnivore with speed demon (and bloodied) you can pop a cranberry meatball grinder and pretty much never die (as long as you dont stop moving). But dodgy/seren/actionboy and a quantum is easy. Subtract the quantum If your team is cryolating. Easy to time stims when shes slowed.
---
I can’t wait for this i been itching to use this so badly. The anticipation is killing me! Raider for life !
---
One day, Ward is just gonna drop a “Let me guess, someone stole your sweet roll?” and freak us all out.
---
That's odd. I have been kicked personally while not sharing anything (hey maybe that was the problem??) :)
---
I'm almost level 500 scouring the high schools for plastic plates to make shotgun shells. Plebs indeed.
---
just wow
---
Fine and dandy, but you have to be lvl 50 to use lvl 50 armor, what do you plan on doing until then?
---
One yet the other I found in a vendor a few months back. Again. What’s your point exactky?  Almost everything high end in the game has been obtained through one of the several dupes. Including flux and ammo and even caps. Allowing duper’s to dupe and then not only reinstating them but letting them keep the stuff they duped is ridiculous. I guess at least everyone can now stop bothering with trade as everything became super cheap again.
---
I usually try and stand a distance away from the fences and tents and lure her towards me, most of the time it seems to work. 
---
It’s just a pain that people don’t realise she can’t land on or near the roof squatters and just keep shooting her.
---
im at level 49 now so its not far
---
Or, "i used to be a raider like you but i took a bolt to the knee"
---
It works for crafted ones as well.  If you make enough of them, you'll get it.
---
Am lvl 380 and so far I can’t remember a single instance where scrapping a weapon gave me any amount of springs/gears lol
---
And I would never pay caps for a gun I wanna scrap (except the alien blaster for the mods I suppose). Got enough wood/steel from all the crap in West Tek/Line in the Sand.
---
Yes, I understand not holding mini nukes as they are heavy as fuck, but dont forget there are players like me who have ordinance express and carry 60+ to use for crowd control, like I have a two shot fatman that is great for SBQ or WC, because of all the additional spawns. The free ones are nice and getting the missiles as basically free rewards depending on the quest really keeps the nuke supply high. 
---
One nuke will clear anywhere from 1 to 12 off my buddies and others depending on density, I use grenedier, but am unsure if it buffs fatman.
---
With both.
---
I'm level 7 and I just got the game back and decided to go East and went to Freaky Freddy's Scare House or whatever it's called and found a legendary level 31 Wendigo and I got so scared just because  I was in the shop and I just picked up a skeleton mask and was about to put it on. And then I heard a noise. And then I saw a whoosh come from its direction. I've never hid in a survival game so fast until yesterday. I hid, fast traveled the hell outta there. Then I went there with my dad to see if maybe he could clear out the wendigo and the couple of ghouls. Nope. Worst. Idea. Ever. We both screamed, ran, and hid so we could fast travel back to his C.A.M.P.
---
Nice. Thanks mates!
---
Ah.  I would recommend excavator power armor, if possible, as it adds 100 carry capacity, it's probably easier to get over all.
---
Now I know that will keep an eye on it
---
There is a silent camp mod and a slocum mute mod if you care to install.
---
Otherwise let me and my robot servants live in peace without your judgement.
---
[here you go friend, good luck!](https://childusa.iad1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5h9FRZGfzyAEZJb)

What about an event in there that is like one violent night but it makes your I play the organ to attract waves of megasloths?
---
thanks m8 :)
---
Thought so
---
Here we go again
---
suddenly he's very quiet
---
By Flux farming you mean for glowing hardened mass, and irradiated fluids, right?
---
How late you gonna be up? I'll be getting on around 0415 Central U.S. time
---
damn. im sorry but im gonna steal that mirror/wendigo thing, absolutly great!
---
You shouldn't give names or tags, is against the rules
---
Don’t know if this fits what you’re asking but I made the UFO playground thing into a bedroom for my NPC and visitors and I find it hilarious
---
Are you actually trying to justify duping/cheating by saying people buy things via trade so they’re as guilty????  If you counterfeit money are the people you buy things from guilty because they took the money?  Really lol.
---
Same here, my friend just got his temp ban removed but still has all of the duped stuff and everything lol
---
And the actual plants.
---
Hornright industries has you covered.
---
You hit the nail on the head there. Hence why ~~we~~ they all got unbanned at the same time.
---
wow, did you come to that conclusion after the fact? gg Sherlock
---
Wait so when people solo it the queen doesn't have less health??? That's insane if so... How come they can do it in a minute but a group of ten or so take nearly 20? Are we that bad?? I guess solo can get the sneak bonus where you can't in a group but that still seems like a huge difference!
---
Shocker
---
all you, like I said most of the ideas came from other cleverer people.
---
I gather plants off of others' nukes, but it's so hard to find many enimies where most people nuke in the bog.
---
Where can I find more information about the rebuilding projects. I keep hearing about them and they sound interesting. I would love to learn more.
---
I'm usually on all the time, sleep schedule changes alot.. what's your psn?
---
Absolutely nope.
---
Ferals? Sure.
---
Wendingo? Aaaaargh
---
I'll pm you it
---
what even was that gun he used??
---
I'm really disappointed with the level of monetization in this game.
---
Yeah, I thought I would try to help low level folks, but I think I put my camp in the most popular spot of the map.  Too bad though, I love my new camp.
---
Look, I never said that cheating is good for the game's economy. I understand that it might change the way people play. But most part of the playerbase will never notice that since they play casually and couldn't care less about global game economy, they don't even have a clue how valuable are the most valuable gear pieces. Also, many of us don't care about how others play the game. We just get out fair share of fun and log off for the night.
---
But that's not the point of my posts.
---
So I:ll ask you a question: Do you agree that the game design is flawed in so many ways that it basically incentivizes people to find ways around such basic things like the grind (with no real possibility to pursue specific designated goals)/timegates?
---
No, we made this game by pre-ordering at full price, buying multiple accounts, buying 1st and in some cases atoms. Making BGS enough cash to continue making content while the game about a year ago was almost dead and even buggier and making it feasible to give it away with Gamepass.
---
Personally because I have terrible wifi and am kinda busy, I no longer have time to level to get my weekly or dailies that require a level done. Legendaries are easy enough though, I can easily nock out 6-7 in a few hours
---
What makes her instantly take off again when she does land sometimes??
---
Be cool to get some decent level 5 or lower bloodied explosive stuff though for starting new characters
---
The problem is people can use these on combination with trap camps and really screw players over.
---
I usually create a team then you can join and fast travel
---
I believe pounds is what they use, but yeah, not items for sure.
---
Here you go:

Too late, it's just a bunch of loose screws now.
---
this
---
Yea I’ve been having this issue too but there are some events you can manually start. The Blue Ridge Caravan event and I believe Power Up the Power Plants and Monster Mash. If you can’t get events to start try those
---
It doesn't actually do anything you couldn't already do though.
---
Well I certainly won’t be “tossing off” to any gorilla’s. Good day to you sir.
---
That there is the explosive oh-shits maneuver...
---
What do lunchboxes do?
---
I don't think it's fair to cal someone with 50fc a cheater. I have a build like this and I bought them easily by just vendor hopping and buying them whenever they were cheap, plus collecting my own obviously. With batteries included rank 2 and power user they last forever.
---
Are trap camps really that big of an issue? I’ve been playing since release and I only remember seeing one
---
I agree.
---
That doesn’t really solve the spawn location issue I brought up
---
Oh, that kind of organ! Phew...
---
16 time the genius!!!
---
if you don't place another camp it will be there on another server OR if you stay without placing another, when whomever is in your spot leaves world your camp will be placed.
---
I mean, just do all the things?  Like is it that hard?  Good job, it's just that it's simple.  Do you know officially when it will end?
---
I don’t know how big of a problem they are. But you know they would become an even bigger problem with this.
---
I got a bloodied fixer from one of the ally missions. Would of been an epic find, except I’m not a bloodied build haha other than that I’ve had piss poor things from anyone.
---
Fair enough
---
I was a tour guide here for a long time, such a cool place with an amazing history
---
chainsaws!? What just regular ones??
---
I absolutely agree that the game design is flawed, but if I thought for a second it was so flawed that it would incentivize me to cheat I would stop playing the game
---
Up there.
---
Or at least it will be now.
---
Ally mission? You mean Commander Daguerre and the other guy?
---
Yeah, I can do those fine their all of my map, but the events that are free to teleport to never came up once in 6 hours and it was incredibly frustrating I really want radiation rumble to come up I need the barrel plan badly haha.
---
Yes... I know this isn’t the first time, which is why they will most likely keep to their warning. They’ve banned many players, it’s just never been enough to take note of at one time or for issues other than duping. The one thing that Bethesda hasn’t taken kindly to is players using game functions to ruin other’s experience. Their primary concern now is the new players. FO1st memberships are good money, but they’re going to make a lot more off new impulse buyers who think they’re going to keep with the game. Dupers only reduce the amount of content they have to offer and increases burnout.
---
Just look up Bethesda bans\unbans dupers. It’s just lots of reddit threads from dupers complaining they had to buy a new account after getting permabanned.

Articles like this are common where Bethesda will go beyond just a temp ban. They definitely prefer to ban the associated accounts and many players aren’t getting their f76 character back.
---
Amen..
---
Yes her, I’m sure they come up as allies when you place their desk/station/bar etc?
---
Oh if that’s your issue I seriously relate, I thought you were having issues with the daily challenge
---
I swear if bethesda is going to add another ghillie skin I'm gonna nuke bethesda myself
---
I used to be an adventurer like you... but then I clipped through my bed...
---
Roaches and scorpions
---
500 atoms in atom shop, one bot with discount atm, so you can get atoms from challenges and score board

A seated super mutant reading a newspaper would be much better

Why does everybody want to turn everything into the same thing?
---
THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS.
---
This isn't even supposed to be the fucking Elder Scrolls. Can you low minded fantasy fans go crawl under one of the multitude of fantasy games that already exist. Fucking hell, you bastards got magic in Fallout thanks to bullshit legendary weapons and armor. Can you take EVERY DAMN FANTASY SUGGESTION AND SHOVE IT SO FAR UP YOUR ASS, PLEASE?
---
FOR THE LOVE OF FUCKING GOD, DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO BE REDUCED TO THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR PAP SO YOU DWEEBS CAN DIGEST IT?
---
Fucking hell.
---
\+1
---
It certainly seems that way to me.  I would recs just going rifle and respecing later.  (You can move special points and get other cards to completely rebuild you're character).
---
"16x the detail " 😂
---
I just caught up to Zorbo!  I do all the dailies except for nuclear winter, which I don’t play at all. I think it will be no problem.
---
They cannot do that. 
---
Dead things that disappear go UNDER the map.
---
Yup that's the issue :( no radiation rumble, no violent night, no uranium event. Sucks hard man. Why I was asking if their was a fix or if its just bugthesda
---
Realism
---
Does anyone else think "schutzstaffel" when people write "ss" on hear?  Is it just me?
---
Is a power armor chassis in the station?
---
Hopefully it’ll get a fix soon, it seems like a recent bug
---
And I say, HEYEYEYEYA HEYEYA!
---
I get it.

BRUH
---
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong. West Virginia, mountain mama.Take me home, country roads.
---
Some people are just tards, i dont care about other people sharing, just for the group bonus perks. I share scrapper or strength in numbers
---
I like the wendigo idea. But I think it should be a much lower %. Simply for the fact that if they make it low enough no one will ever believe that it actually happens.
---
Totally agree. If its in the nuke zone I will not join. Its just to much hassle to get rad protection up and having to deal with carry weight problems because of unequipping my full unyielding gear just for some legendaries, flux and repair kits that are already pilling up in my stash.
---
lol it's good, i understand it's mostly a hated thing, kinda dumb of me to post tbh
---
I don't know about you but any time there's a challenge for legendaries, it seems like they stop spawning.
---
Make sure you craft the lowest level gun possible so that it costs less materials.  Also try and use the super duper perk if possible so that you get extra ones when you craft.
---
Ask the newly unbanned dupers, sure they will help.
---
Schorchbeast hunting proves to be really efficient for the kill legendary challenge still rng based based but at last its fixed locations you can fast travel to ... Warning only 1-2* scrip from them ._.
---
That is bloody brilliant it comes with it's own portable hide, you know for bird watching &amp; such.......do want....muchly!
---
The problem for me is you can only sell 1400 caps of stuff a day.  Teleporting around inevitably eats into that and it really annoys me.
---
I'm genuinely curious where you're keeping a literal ton of scrap because I may be ignorant and perhaps missed an exploit that I'd rather be using.
---
There are few event that spawns 3 or more legendaries at once.
---
Like the wolf pack event in Flatwoods...
---
Or the uranium fever...
---
The wolf pack event starts at every hour or so, so if played 2 hours, you missed atleast 1.
---
Read "The Monkey's Paw by WW Jacobs. 
---
In short, a monkey's paw whose fingers curl into a fist as wishes are made. The wishes come true, but usually at a horrible cost.
---
So can dupers.
---
LOL, this was exactly why I clicked on this...I have no idea the OP meant. I was thinking "is this guy really asking for a Nazi jetpack"?
---
I'll say this: tell me how the scrapbox works, maybe I misunderstand.  Also, where do you get it?
---
Leader off the pack which spawns like ever 30 minutes, completely stopped for two days...stayed on same world for 3 hours waiting once
---
It's part of fallout 1st and it's unlimited scrap storage,  I have 1 metric ton in mine atm (2,250 pounds).
---
THANK YOU.  Like, it's "Secret service" that's what it means.  Can we call it mi5 instead?  I don't want to scream "I got the ss jacket, I'm so happy" over one in a videogame, when I already have an authentic one irl.
---
Thanks mate! I got me my suppressor now!
---
*Theme to Curb Your Enthusiasm plays*
---
On piles and piles of ammo...
---
Everyone has their vice. I just want my weekend events to be so PACKED with gunfire I get seizures.
---
If you use power armor then that may be true. However, my point still stands. You say it is the best because it handles damage resistance and that is what YOU use power armor for. I don’t use it for defense, I strictly use it for the extra carry weight...so for me, the excavator is the “best” for me. 
---
PS: adding the t-65 would help make your post easier to understand where you were  coming from.
---
That's what I thought.  I misunderstood what it does.  In that case, it's very useful.
---
You know hacking the game is against the the rules too, cancels out I guess.
---
I didn't want to spoil it.  I'm planning on intigrating a carried set of excavator.  It'll net 90 lbs, which is still good.  Do you know if the excavator set supports calibrated shocks?
---
You're not the one playing this game and everyone plays it as they see fit. But the rampant cheating on a global scale says that many people are inclined to cheat instead of legitimately farm. The grind for perfect gear itself is not even justified since you can steamroll almost all the game's content with no effort after getting 1* uny set of gear and a 1* bloodied gun.
---
Said grind is also quite uninteresting 'cause bethesda never cared to implement fun dungeons with good replayability and other game mechanics that would drive people to constantly push their limits ever further (At the very least).
---
This is the reasons why most people who know, how to cheat don't see a reason to play it fair.
---
And this is why beth needs to fix their game first. Banning people who enjoy the game, while justifiable,will not be effective, yet another wave of cheaters will reemerge from the ashes and the economy of the game (basically nonexistent by now) will continue to get ruined again and again because devs refuse to fix their game.
---
I'm sure they'll release some completely separate from the other jet pack skins.
---
Come to Portland Oregon. There've been consistent nightly riots here for 2 months straight.
---
You can turn 20 Treasure Note a day to 200 bullion. Those are rewards from Events.
---
I'll check when I'm home.i usually scrap them but might have one I think its common
---
I know there's a server cooldown, but I thought there was also a separate, player-specific cooldown specifically to prevent people from farming it by server hopping. I must've been wrong, though.
---
I mean. Better idea would be to look for friends to play with on PC and they'd probably craft it for you without asking.
---
This comes off as just begging for gear, and for those of us that have grinded for everything since launch, it's like..... Nah.
---
Yes they scale to your level. I'd only buy 2 stars while your are leveling up and even past 50 till you have a good weapon for your build or full unyielding set.  Then start getting 3 stars.  Also the max scrip is 1000 I always start spending to stay low enough that a score reward won't go to waste. A good weapon can make leveling 1000x faster.
---
Ahh, I just came back to the game. Last I played, there wasn't any secret service gear, which is why I didn't understand
---
Just checked you can lock it :)
---
Finding toilet paper for cloth, cannot remember what for
---
If you read it again you'll see that I stated "who *besides cheaters* have almost unlimited ammo?". Never called people with lots of fusion cores cheaters, it's a totally normal situation.
---
Until you find that one person who kills you a bunch and takes all your junk and harasses you.
---
When I look for legendaries I dont fast travel.the possibility of a enemie being legendary is so random but some spawns are higher for legendaries.pull up your map and try to give yourself about 5 to 10 mins if someone else is at a location your going to farm so by the time you get there enemies respawn with you being near
---
Yeah.  It's too bad there isn't any ww2 era stuff.
---
It would be more apt if there was a floater in the toilet. 🤣
---
ummm...if you are advocating for nazi jetpacks, I am going to have to walk away
---
Great story!   Thanks for sharing.
---
They do for workshops
---
Why though i wonder
---
And if you nuked it....... Glowing rioters?
---
Nobody said the contrary
---
I think the helmet is bugged and you can’t craft it right now. I’m pretty sure I read another post a few days ago and they were having the same problem
---
I chill on the fence/tents so I don’t get beat up by random scorch going around fighting people. I’m running a bloodied rifleman and it sucks when I have to use a hazmat suit because I can’t use my unyielding set and get the extra carry weight and ap for vats/running and jumping
---
Rng is so strange save up 1k scrip but wait till you get a decent drop from a enemie.the few times I have found a handmade on a enemie and been to purveyor afterwards I have had really good luck...but again it's just luck random as fu.but it def works for me. I've pulled  some decent fixers sometimes 3 at to 4 one go from buying 1k worth
---
They're already glowing from their all natural hippy face moisterizers.
---
Ahh okay thx thought I was doing something wrong
---
Its RNG.
---
I did a little math on purveyor and getting a 1star bloodied fixer is like 100 days try.
---
In my experience trading is required for getting adequate weapons. From my 1000+ looted legendary items I got 2 fixers none of them was bloodied for my build. I had to trade a lot for one.
---
Did you check the basement?
---
You can place vendors at your camp and sell things. But please for the love of atom dont go filling them with any of these plans: Mounted x, Ultracite apendages or Ultracite PA mods that are valued at 600 caps or less, and then please dont make your ammo expensive. Its a pretty common courtesy to sell ammo for 1 cap, maybe 2 for rare stuff. I mean you do you but i always appreciate it when i dont see these things in a vendor and i know others do too. But other than that just try different things and see what works for you. Themed vending can be fun like running a comic shop or a bar. Most importantly is to scope out your competition. Once you start seeing whats good you can try and buy low then sell high and before ya know it youll be making panic runs to whitesprings to go buy serum plans before you max out again.
---
Really? Never knew, I just threw this on the post because I assumed it wouldn’t since it doesn’t with camps
---
Agaaaaaaaain......
---
RNG man
---
Ive crafted about 70 gauss shotguns, but havent found a single bloodied one. While other people craft one in 10 or less.
---
No no no.  I just meant from a historical perspective.  I want to see mark I tanks or ww1 style flame throwers or other relics.  Nazi paraphernalia would be cool in a STRICTLY historical sense though.
---
great idea man!! Let's do it!
---
Karen really....... we stand on stuff all the time &amp; kill her in under 5mins
---
Instigating can be really good with a hardened receiver as a sniper.easy 500 damage at least add in sneak multipliers and might be able to pull 1k damage on that 1st shot if they are at full health.but junkies is definitely good.just need to decide on your 5 addictions to add 50 percent damage
---
I was planning on selling fusion cores, but they're too much of a hassle to farm at the power plants with lvl 300 griefers who just want to kill you.
---
Do your dailies for Crater and Foundation, do the daily photo op for Davenport at the overseer's house, and do lots of public events (marked with a ! on the map) for treasury notes to turn in for gold bullion.
---
Unarmed is underwhelming early on, you really need unyielding armor set, adrenal reaction serum, twisted muscle serum and the related perks before that its garbage. Lategame it is very good tho,
---
You keep giving justifications for why the cheating is acceptable, none of which make sense to me. You point out that I'm not the only person playing this game, while simultaneously ignoring the fact that cheaters are disregarding that fact as well and in a much more destructive manner. You insist that the burden of this is entirely on Bethesda, and while I can't say this is 100% of the time, after 23 years of online gaming experience I am comfortable making the assertion that the vast majority of people who are willing to cheat would be willing to cheat regardless if the game is broken or not. 
---
Bethesda absolutely needs to fix their game, but cheaters are cheaters and I don't believe even if Bethesda fixed this game in almost every conceivable way cheaters wouldn't still look for and Implement ways to cheat if possible.
---
 I find your justifications for cheating hollow at best, and often self defeating, but you seem really invested in the idea of cheating , so I suppose we're just going to have to agree to disagree because no amount of justifying cheating is ever going to make sense to me
---
Great advice. But I’ve decided to trade it for the JE. I’m currently trading/selling for something
---
Only owners and team can FT to them, so there’s no trap issues.
---
I feel like big Bend tunnel east typically has some easy to access power armor.
---
Nuka  Dark is great for Nuclear Winter.
---
I've heard that there are plans for that in safes at Pleasant hills cemetery.  can't confirm myself but you might want to check that out.
---
I’ve used the fire pit, placed a cooking pot on top, and then placed a chair so that the character isn’t hovering in the air while using the cooking pot. It’s lined up pretty perfectly now
---
10/10 would never open a stall again (:
---
As someone without 1st, I would welcome this change wholeheartedly and without any reservation whatsoever.  The tiny annoyance of dropping gunpowder on death is absolutely trivial and easily more than offset by it being affected by junk weight reduction, and I'm sure plenty of people will be happy to have it count for junk armour with that perk too.
---
(Obviously, zero weight would be better in most cases but I always find the concept of zero-weight items a bit weird and I think there's much less chance of Bethesda actually implementing that)
---
Solid choice.insta is nice but 50%damage out the gate no matter your health is damn good.im sure you will have some fun with it
---
Kill tough enemies 12/13. "Kill the Scorchbeast Queen". I can't kill her any more dead than she already is.
---
No, no you play like that. I'll play however I like.
---
You’ll keep it when it runs out IIRC, just won’t be able to move it.
---
Ah yeah sorry I see what you were saying now. Maybe it would have been better to say "and who besides cheaters and gatling builds with 50 fc's on them actually do?"
---
Use the Power armour glitch in the basement of Freddie’s fear house , gets you back into vault 79, legendary 3* sentry bot spawns every-time, kill...server hop repeat
---
🤷‍♂️
---
From your experience wich chace is better to farm legendary weapons the 1,2 or 3 strars chace?
---
What are ya trying to craft?
---
I have stealth commando builds, very ammo efficient.🤔
---
it spawns outside the event area ( especially in the MIRE)
---
look around, and at bottom of cliffs, tag it and it should 'teleport' nearer
---
Combat rifles, I wanna scrap them for mods so I can upgrade my guns.
---
More you know
---
another quality job there
---
Make them charge you like feral ghouls I swear there like flash sometimes but instead of them falling over like the ghouls just have them be on top of the player constantly there supposed to be fearless apex predators they should act it.
---
Dude I can probably just straight up mod em for ya cheaper homie
---
would the Cryo-Arrows/Bolts offer anything?
---
Make sure you are not playing this in borderless window mode, for some reason that completely demolishes FPS for a lot of people.
---
I wanna have the mods so I can craft them for the future guns I may have. If you have some extra scraps I can pay for them
---
I heard people drop an item as that causes the game to save. My truth to that or just player superstition?
---

Great question, I had not considered that (I often forget they exist). I will test it tomorrow and reply to you through this thread with an answer.
---
I did that twice already I'm sure as hell not gonna pull it off on my new level 10 character
---
yeah i dont get why all the people are standing on their tents and fences, while I am running around in the grass with health between 10-20% and hardly ever die except when I mess up
---
while back when playing with my buddy, he had the only tent up at the SBQ fight, and like 3 or so people we standing on the tent, and he was replacing it the whole time so people would fall to the ground, but they immediately ran back to the tent to jump on it again (often times he replaced it again while they were midair in their jump up) we were laughing like crazy, but the dumb bastards just didnt get it and got mad at my buddy ....
---
Text chat would still be good to have, people using the chat mod are a friendly bunch, calling out when launching nukes so others can join, and such. Highly recommended.
---
Two shot explosive was the thing everyone was after a time ago. You can still get some money for It. I'll put It in my vendor for 3000-5000 and as It doesn't weight too much you're not in a hurry to sell it
---
Edit: wrote "shit" instead of "shot"
---
I’d keep it, it’s a decent gun to add to your collection.
---
Sure there are much better weapons out there, but if they ever re-tweak tse weaponry you’ll have yourself a fun little plinker in your arsenal.
---
I have insti fixer and handmade so I decided to trade the old combat for a junky
---
I’ve been hit a bunch. I have never been on at reset. That isn’t the main thing causing this
---
Does gauss actually do the most dps?
---
2 accounts unbanned last night. Everything intact including glitched CAMPs, duped godrolls, duped glitched weapons.
---
Thing is, I've kind of gone off the game now after 3,000+ hours and 1,200 levels so Todd did me a favour. Could still finish Legendary Run but...why? I have all this shit to give away now.
---
Started playing Skyrim again. A game the likes of which BGS may never produce again.
---
Idk why you’re getting downvoted this is facts. I love helping people and now that my suspension is lifted you can find me out there gifting all these hypocrites.
---
I'd love to be able to control where I spawn at my camp. If I don't jump as soon as my toon loads in it gets stuck in rock and i have to fast travel to get unstuck.
---
I can't really move the camp module because I made the building kind of big so there is no where else it can go
---
They can still melt you though.
---
Exactly my point, it’s more than just convenience
---
Don't worry, I was being sarcastic. &lt;3
---
Dude probably posted this because he's sick of hearing people recommend it. When I was a lower level, hoping that it pops was a pain in the ass. And then you have to deal with all of Uranium Fever hoping that you can actually tag the legendary. Lately, I've just been going to the SBQ spawn point because i feel like the scorchbeast that spawns there has a solid chance of being a legendary.
---
Restart the game, they’ll be there.
---
So you’ll needlessly drag the game out and waste everyone’s time and ammo, nice. Only hope i play with less people like you and more people with empathy 💜
---
Goddammit I just got to work, but I have a few thousand wood and steel you could have had for free, and screws can be crafted/farmed if you know how.
---
If you can wait 9 hours I can at least drop you those. 👍🏻
---
I doubt it, bow or xbow are nowhere near the rof of a Cryolator. I'd like to be proven wrong, though, as it would bring something new into the mix.
---
Too real! :-D
---
Many events guarantee a legendary.
---
* Leader of the Pack (near the Ferris Wheel, northwest of Vault **76**)
---
* Horde events.
---
* Uranium Fever, at the Blackwater Mine
---
* One Violent Night (Sons of Dane Compound)
---
* Grafton Day (northeast of Vault 76 in Grafton) ...
---
* Monster Mash  (Watoga High School)
---
* AWOL Armaments at RobCo
---
* Free Range
---
* Riding Shotgun
---
And several others.
---
Also,  Some locations often have multiple legendaries.  Charleston DMV, Whitesprings and Fissure Site Prime will almost always yield at least one.  The DMV often produces 2-3.  Westek is tough, but most of the time has one or two.
---
Note:  Often, when a server has been running more than 4 hours, the legendaries stop randomly spawning.  If you are on a server that seems devoid of legendaries, just hop or restart if you are on a private.
---
I accidentally considered scrapping my desk fan for parts a fews days into 76 :D
---
Several times, I've had the bug where I could not activate the lure.
---
you want kuahlidy?
---
Man an end game Deathclaw event would be absolutely amazing. Instead of one massive Deathclaw give us a larger than average (x1.5-1.75) leading and empowering a hoard of Deathclaws of various types, a Deathclaw Emperor if you will
---
If it makes you feel any better I was cleaning up at my mum's home the other day and saw a bobby pin on the floor and I legit thought "Oooh a bobby pin" with genuine excitement.
---
Awesome. Than I only have to get Barbarian and Ironclad.
---
Well, you keep saying that I'm justifiying cheating but that's definitely not the case. I never said it's acceptable. My entire point was that cheating is one of the symptoms of bad game design which needs to be fixed in order to fight cheating more efficiently -)) we actually play for the same team here but you somehow refuse to acknowledge that, throwing left and right arguements about how hollow my points are.
---
Of course cheaters will cheat, but to less extent if the game would have better design and more engaging gameplay/less restrictions (such as timegated everything) for people who want to push their limits.
---
I don't think there's any reason to argue any further since I already made a point and you can disagree as much as you want (but we actually do agree on my main point as you already stated), but by the end of the day we will remain with our own opinions on the subject of cheating anyway.
---
Haha the old "people" eh? Almost as if they're more than one with different opinions isn't it? /s
---
Maybe so, yeah. Sorry, english is not my native language after all.
---
Sometimes tagging doesn't work.
---
One serum sells for 500 with a little charisma, hard bargain, and grape mentats.
---
Delightful mate! You’re a legend. I can wait
---
Tradition

Thank you, now maybe we can get a decent team together with people who share useful perks and actually run events.
---
You can always sell it.
---
Wish they would let us see what their quest line is love helping out but if I can't see what in supposed helping with.
---
Is your friend a Fallout 1st user?
---
I get unbanning, but not wiping their inventory is baffling
---
Yes please!
---
"How you holdin' out?"
---
You have to have a minimum of 3 to convert
---
Not attempting to continue an argument just acknowledging that we do agree on the main point that the game design does need to be fixed you are absolutely correct, where are opinions seem to differ unfortunately is that I don't feel that the players resorting to cheating is justified because of it and unless I'm mistaken, and please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, you feel that it is either justified or at the very least unavoidable, and that is specifically the part I disagree with
---
You're good, don't worry! I didn't read it carefully enough!
---
Or a nihilistic mindset.
---
Cool beans. I'll also teach you the ways of screw farming - are you level 50 and do you have Super Duper maxed?
---
*CURIOSITY INTENSIFIES*
---
It really depends on your build and what weapon you use.
---
Rule of thumb as a beginner I would go for 2 stars weapons until I have a good one. Then 3 stars.
---
Yes I do
---
I've got 2k+ hours and a gazillion SBQ fights under my belt.  This info is solid.  Thanks OP.
---
Sounds like you can't play the game very well and are trying to make excuses.
---
I bought my entire system For $750 and the game runs fine at around 60 fps.  I wouldn't consider that high end at all.
---
Radeon rx 580 and amd ryzen 2600 is what I have btw.
---
Yea that's cool but I'd like a functioning game first
---
It's a reason, but it's not an excuse.
---
I understand that the 18% chance also means 0 damage to you while bouncing some back. Useful for vanguard builds vs gutsy
---
But if you want to nuke somewhere else?
---
If you still need it, I can craft you a set on Friday Night.
---
Easy peasy, just have the welcome mat work for only yourself
---
just leave it. atm im 55 at the legendary run without any NW because i dont want to spend a second in a pvp mode of a game that, in my opinion, isnt made for it at all.
---
Oh that's a great idea. Well done!
---
your image looks kinda blurry but I can see a bigfoot there
---
Unsafe, unskilled and underpaid strip miners/communities still exist. Africa and south America have a lot of them. I would assume china does too. Wage slavery will likely never go away.
---
I tried cryo-arrows. It can't freeze the queen, projectile is slow, and its slow down effect only lasts for 3 seconds. Floater grenade and cryolator is my go-to.
---
Because folders were unscrappable?
---
im sorry :( im just asking in case like maybe y'all have extra junk or things to get rid of off the stash u know.
---
Wait a second..... Grafton day has never once had a legendary for me?? Am I doing it wrong?  Am I supposed to actually follow the parade instead of instantly murdering the Grafton monster?
---
what is your gmt? and my gamertag is shiniga_mi
---
Sent a chat request mate
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature
---
thanks, will check it out

In the bog it's not normally fighting the super mutants, in the train station at the top you have to shoot it for it to come running in the mire it's normally down the cliff to the left shoot it again it comes.

There is usually a legendary somewhere there during the event but TBH that is probably the worst event in my list.  The rest are guaranteed without having to search.

Exchange some claim tokens at the vending machines in front of Abandoned Mineshaft Kittery or Elaine. That'll shut her up.

1.1k hours in and I havnt had one drop for me. 2 years on the trade sub and have seen 1 come up. I don't think they're common
---
Grafton Day and Monster Mash doesnt have guarenteed legendary enemies. Although most of the time you will find at least one legendary at MM. Not all the time though

I’ve seen several people tell you that there’s not much difference between it and other power armors. **On paper, looking at the numbers**, yes, I would seem to be the best. But it isn’t. It’s just about the same as T-51b, T-60, Ultracite, and X-01. I have a friend that regretted spending all his gold getting it, because it worked just the same as T-51 did.
---
Then grandpa comes in and says Quad FFR automatic railway rifle ;)
---
you must not have met the mayor of grafton yet.
---
I never find any good plans in that cemetary.  I think that info is BS.
---
turn off volume, all the volume
---
It puts your camp back.  If you logged out inside your camp, you will spawn at the nearest spawn point.
---
Upvote on behalf of the ghost of Phil Hartman.
---
This is the best answer you could hope for. Pack it up boys. We're done here.
---
it isnt as it needs FFR not explosive to be magic
---
It gets worse. This kind of game mechanics is making its way across many many many games.
---
I often clear Harper's Ferry for weapons to sell for caps, plans to put in my vendor, and XP.  I cleared it 2 or 3 times this morning and got that challenge cleared in the process.  Won't always work but since I'm farming that area anyway it is efficient at that.
---
When you spend scrip is the only supposed to be up to level 45?
---
I have been complaining about this for months and kept hearing about the issue with Healing Factor mutation but never did anything.
---
I changed my mutations this week just an adjustment leaving out Healing Factor, not a single Fast Travel issue since. I just have to accept I need to manage my stimpak use now, on PC so have stims bound to key '1' radaway to key '2'.
---
I am bloodied as I think that was related but not sure I never test going full health build with Healing Factor.
---
Anyway, feels nice not to have that annoying bug.
---
Todd Happened
---
Also PC &amp; Xbox. We all have the same mechanics.
---
Dude, you are a legend.  I do have tokens that I haven't claimed.  That may be it.
---
Turn off the console or the PC, go outside, look at the sky.
---
I’d like to craft ammo or chems without existing annoying time wasting. Ammo crafting is another story: I should buy new PS4 DualShock because of my Raliway rifle which needs tons of ammo
---
Morgantown or Monongah can be good for enemies. Also Harper's Ferry which also gives you the option of farming xp in the burrows but that won't produce mats. The best way to farm mats at the moment is find a glitched ultracite vein and keep poking at it. Tanagra Town is especially good for this trick.
---
LOL.. Yeah I've met that blabbermouth too.  He is equally annoying.
---
It is not justified if you feel so. Other people has their own views on what's right and what's wrong. I believe to cheat or not for many people is a matter of having or not having fun from the game. It's a game and it supposed to be fun. If it isn't, people try to make it more fun for themselves or just quit.
---
I personally played the game for 1900 hours since beta and I got 4 god-rolled 3* drops (one was even a great be15 lmg right for my heavy build). FOUR. If it's not a korean-grade RNG, I dunno what it is.
---
98% of my other top-tier gear was given to me absolutely free of charge by my friends since it didn't cost them much to get all that stuff and they were eager to share. To be pretty honest, I think I'd quit long ago if it wasn't for all that stuff that made my game considerably more enjoyable. So somehow I'm glad that a ton of top gear was mass-duped and made available to the public. Otherwise the majority of the playerbase would never see such pieces of gear (and would be more inclined to quit the game rather sokner than later). What to do with the totally ruined economy is all up to bethesda now but it is completely their fault their game design allowed for such situation to happen. Of course they needed to do much better job at enforcing their own TOS, but again, they failed even at that.
---
After all that happened in this game I doubt they'll ever fix that mess they allowed to happen in the first place.
---
The assaultron head is the only one I'm aware of it gives 1 screw
---
Ghoul Slayers Gamma Gun
---
I saw mods for PC in YT where there’s such option. But tbh idk are they official or not🙄
---
If your in NW you have a 100% of me hiding in one if you see a cluster of about 20
---
My man!
---
I'd buy gift boxes if I could add stuff to them to give away.  Other games do this.  Can't believe Bethesda has missed out on this opportunity for another cash grab.
---
The only way they one shot you is if they headshot you with either a hunting rifle, gauss rifle, or lever action rifle, with the rifleman perk. If they dedicate their build to that and were able to 180 headshot you from wherever, they deserve the kill. If you unloaded half your clip into them and they were still alive to return fire, you did not deserve the kill. You not agreeing with the game mechanics does not make it unbalanced
---
This.  Make sure it is in full screen mode.
---
Awesome place to nuke that I see very rarely is the pumpkin house.  The fissure right next to the house has a ton of ultracite nodes.  Collect the ore, spawn a wave of Scorched, collect more ore, more scorched.  You can harvest a ton of flux making materials doing this and there is a lot of raw flux for picking, just don't remember which types.
---
There’s not really a way to grind bullion since there’s a daily limit at the gold machines, just do your daily’s for your settler and raider rep and do events for the treasury notes. That’s about all you can do unfortunately
---
Yep that’s the fucking dude, hilariously enough I was probably in that match.
---
Well seeing the current unwave ban I certainly can't help but agree that it seems that their lax enforcement of Their Own terms of service and their unwillingness to fix their lax enforcement of their terms of service likely isn't going to change anytime soon, unfortunately.
---
I agree. Can you fallout first idiot's not stand on your tent or on fences, like wtf. Yes. I appreciate your tents being there for cover and to drop stuff off, but  seriously. You ruined so many SBQ events for me crazy and I cant back all that ammo I spent trying to put that fatass of a bat down. Get off your tent, and were power armor like a rear man!!!!!@
---
(Todd has his assistant log into his character, screenshots his collection of panels, activation goggles and keypads, prints it out, hand delivers it to Todd)...
---
(Todd laughs without expression, has his assistant burn the print outs)
---
It’s interesting to learn the origin of the word “scrip.”
---
You know what’s kind of bizarre? My mother would sing Sixteen Tons to us growing up. (I’m 23, so it was released before her time too and she is also not from America.)
---
I try to do things like this, so please dont run away lvl 8, im not trying to murder you, im trying to give you 500 10mm bullets and some cranberry relish :/
---
I’m thinking about visiting myself. Just something about that game that draws me to that state
---
did you file a bug ticket?
---
My father was born in a coal camp outside of Harlan, Kentucky. I heard lots of stories growing up. What they were doing back then was nothing but gussied up slavery. Anybody who dared to speak out ended up fired, and sometimes dead. Being fired didn't just mean you lost your job either. It meant you and your whole family were thrown out. With nothing to eat and nowhere to go. I can't even begin to imagine how hard that must've been for them.
---
This is true, but I rarely see MM without at least one legendary.  Granted, they almost always drop crap armor, but still count.
---
So basically you're saying that unless one is a maxed out triple-digit-level player, don't even bother trying because it's a waste of time: casual players can't do 1k damage without a power build before the power gamers can.
---
Shows that fallout 76 either sticks with you or scars you
---
(bethesda reads this)
---
beth1: "We got this!"
---
(makes junk item called Blueprint, scraps for nothing, sells for nothing, can't bulk, dropping it procs the "are you sure?" response)
---
beth 2: "Nailed it brah!"
---
(beth 1+2 high five and eat live mice)

I believe they have this planned for winter time.

---
So I have 0 mutations but I have these fast travel issues (some is weeks old):
---
1, clicking on locations will not bring up fast travel options (did before). Just after like 1 minute or 20 more clicks.
---
2, sometimes I click on fast travel and nothing happens.
---
3, I click fast travel it starts counting from 15 seconds then instantly cancel it and I have to leave the area or wait minutes.
---
Why not both? :O
---
next time, dodge the bullet
---
Can confirm, WV native and my grandfather ran the company store, it was also used in various industry that dealt with mines such as smelting l, refining, all the way up to raw product such as steel mills in southwest Pennsylvania and eastern ohio. My grandfather ran the company store for a business called Sterling which produced faucets and similar hardware. Interesting side note: my GPA was paid in us cash, not because that gave a fart about him but because it "kept his hands out of the till".
---
**\*sarcasmic\*** Yay, welcome back, dupers. Good to hear people could benefit from dupe once again. Good job Beth. Can't wait next dupe.
---
Have you seen the ammo point rate for those things
---
Hey there. If you’re still looking for people to play with, let me know. 
---
I’m 29. And looking for people around my age to play FO76 with :)
---
Why are you using them if duped items are so bad ? Not defending anyone, but without people duping you probably would not have em...just saying
---
Thus the whole point of "scrip". The company pretty much owned you and made sure you had close to no way out, "checking" also being a means of retention - I imagine you were pretty much all time in debt with the company that employed you.
---
Do the cryolator and floater do damage or just freeze for others to do damage?
---
dropped that way
---
I'd rather you get improved repair kits and stable flux rewards and no drop(and sometimes the event awards legendary items), than see people waste a lot of crafted ammo. Furious weapons can help you get your dps to an acceptable level without the need for a "build".
---
I do believe too✌🏻
---
Yes, yes, yes!!! Epic. I was only thinking that there was a lack of things in stalls, recently. The Wendigo is up there with the ’ Enderman’ in Minecraft, they still freak me out, and i’m 42!!!
---
Same I'm always healing and running tunnels, it really boils my piss, when there are 4 or more players defending and they still cant keep them alive to busy moving from one to side trying to kill everything instead of just cover their area no level 4 rewards for us.
---
Also talons mutations adds another 25 or 30 percent and there’s so many melee food buffs. My unarmed build is so OP it’s a blast, totally overkill most of the time
---
If this is still a thing, I’d definitely be in. Female. 29. Level 180+
---
It is the Perk Loadout Manager on nexus.  It may not be official but it works great.  Obviously Bethesda supports the concept because they are adding this function.  Supposedly.
---
The only drawback to the PLM is that with every major game update, it breaks.  You have to wait about 12 hours for the author to update it again. It still works except for not being able to save new loadouts without updating.
---
Cant speak for the freezer grenades on damage, but the cryo  applies a negligible amount of damage. A bloodied one hits her for about 25-50 per shot. The idea is to equip your cryo and your main dps weapon for quick switch, unload a full cryo clip and then switch to your main dps. Usually takes about 5-7 seconds. The more people use them, the less you have to.
---
Our team only runs 2 cryos, no issues. 3 is ideal. 2 is fine. 1 is totally doable, but you'll need 2 full clips.
---
for anyone thinking about siding with the raiders - complete the settlers quests until you get the chinese stealth armor. it's permanent and getting it doesn't lock you out of the raiders questline.
---
have your cake and eat it.
---
Mutants already have the sitting animation. I found this hilarious when I discovered it while sneaking around.
---
Technically accurate. 
---
If a crew is dropping triple nukes on the Queen, then yeah your average casual will struggle to keep up with the time frame that they work to. 
---
But, just because a triple level(s) are there doesn’t mean that the casuals are out of luck.
---
Or how about I dont be an idiot and bring a pipe to what is clearly a machinegun fight. Man is there something wrong with people when did what amouts to shooting skeet turn into shooting fhouls and muties
---
It is sad you think a horde of bipedal monsters is a giant bat
---
it...just...works....?
---
Haha powerfist go punch
---
Bonus exp and fun effects when murdering things like confetti headshots.
---
What are u talking about. With out duper’s there’s no high end weapons?  Was the B5025 fixer actually even duped?  Anyone caught duping should have lost their inventory. Certainly at a minimum anything they duped. What Bethesda have done have said it’s fine to dupe and cheat so you might as well all do it. Where’s the punishment?  And when these same players now use the xp exploits to gain 100 on legendary road there’s literally no punishment at all.
---
You're halfway to getting your 20 atoms, of course you've done everything the game has to offer.
---
Doesn't mean they aren't dupers
---
Move it so that there is free space around
---
Thank you! Glad we came to an understanding -))
---
As someone that isn't a US citizen Appalachia and specifically the Forest area in the game is absolutely gorgeous. I have loved fallout games for too long but the change in scenery to more vibrant colors really is selling the game to me so far.
---
It used to be possible to double dip some of the pipe pistols with both rifleman and gunslinger perks.  Not sure if it still works.  Might have been only for the revolver.
---
No no no my friend, you do not use it on the queen, i have a full demo build. It is the most fun character I have. But I have a minigun for the queen fight to get my needed damage on her. Your real job is mob killer,. My TS fatman just annihilates the mobs she spawns and anything else. Allowing everyone that focus on the queen. My friend you are an unsung hero of a queen fight by eliminating all the mobs.
---
You're going to give them bad ideas.
---
But.... faster fire rate and explosive is both a secondary legendary star....
---
Do suppressor weapons have a positive effect on keeping her on the ground.  I have a sup mini.
---
I fucking hated it, too. Took me until rank 45 or so until I finally scrounged together the cards for a build that suits my playstyle.
---
By now I thoroughly enjoy it, now that I don’t have to hide anymore and am actually capable of fighting back effectively. Unless there’s a hacker around, every match I play these days has at least some merit to it.
---
+1
---
its strange to me that it isn't
---
Edit: moved my comment where I meant it to go.
---
I never said they were or weren't, that's irrelevant to the point I was making.
---
The person I was replying to said people were unbanned because they were FO1st members, and I refuted that.
---
I've found shooting your feet with an explosive weapon and triggering serendipity allows me to travel 90% of the time I get hit with the bug, the rest of the time it's run to the next galaxy over and cry.
---
Happy cake day!
---
That truly is interesting, makes me wonder how he went about his life when, while being involved in the whole scheme, yet being paid in cash. Was there a way he could also pay with cash, or was he pretty much out of the loop, living outside the "company", a more normal life? I'd imagine so - why buy in into the scrip business when you had a chance not to.
---
Ah
---
I’m jealous because I really want that white skull raider mask and the fireplace secret door. I get why you did it, I’m a sucker for camp items and cosmetics
---
That’s pretty damn interesting. It should totally be added to the game, with the additional bonus of being able to harvest copious amounts of gunpowder there.
---
Good fyi. I'll do that with my new character lol.
---
Welcome after a few (lot) issues in NW I have joined the afkwater society first then now I am a devoted bushwhacker feel free to join our growing number.
---
Absolutely!
---
Are you Satan?
---
Yes, the way the fallout franchise goes about doing things! I find myself scavenging for things in other games, looking under tables and trash cans  hoping to find something useful . But Im always disappointed when I find nothing and realize I’m not playing fallout!
---
We call that the vertibird slayer!
---
I like hazmat suits. I dont like the stealth suit and dont like power armor
---
I'll give you 30,000 caps and my first born for it.
---
I dont know, I wouldn't think so. The suppression legendary effect halves the damage that an enemy can deal for a short period of time,  and I'm not even sure If it works on her. I will test it tomorrow and let you know; I main tank for my group so I'll see exactly what kind of damage she puts out before and after the effect is applied.
---
But I'm pretty sure it would do nothing for keeping her grounded.
---
Thank you kind strangers
---
Thanks to you it was
---
Muh, EVERY PLATFORM WANTS THIS
---
Happened to me with me bloodied meat hook, changed one perk and it added a extra 450 damage per swing crazy.
---
What damage are you pulling with your death claw gauntlet with the right perks?
---
My great grandfather worked in the Coal Fields in Pennsylvania. It was  hard work and little pay. Never got as bad as a company store thank god. Still, man died of black lunge.
---
The Ash Heap in reminds me of some of the worst hit areas in PA. Its not as bad as it was, but whole mountain tops are flat grasslands due to mining
---
I always think I’m going to find a trap when I open a stall door! A grenade in the toilet ready to detonate or something.
---
I have paid my dues, I have my right to my opinion. Lol.
---
Just wait until next season when they add brown coloured ghillie suits instead
---
It used to be just a random "thing" I came by on the internet a few years ago. Then I heard the song for the first time on South Park I think last year? But didn't think too much of it.
---
Hearing it again in Fallout 76 and finally something clicked in my brain and I started connecting the dots. It was a total nerdgasm right then and there :)
---
It's exciting to find the meaning behind such things as references in video games or songs.
---
Some weapons and armours level cap is 45 others 50
---
Fake News, standing on a tent or fence has zero affect on her landing.
---
Dont listen to OP. Confirm this on youtube or Google, they are full of it.
---
Who’s still making ammo? And with the update coming to improve the ammo converter why waste your time?
---
I was a sneak commando for a while. Ended up with many heavy weapons so added bear arms.  Would get a surprising good amount of covert damage with mini gun when she landed.  Couldn't really tell if it actually suppressed though.
---
I don’t see any armour in the picture, just a bush and a satellite...?
---
TRUE. STANDING on the fence or tent will not prevent her from landing. But it WILL, a vast majority of the time, make her immediately take off again. I never once said that standing on the fence or bunker or tent prevents her from landing. Read it again.
---
I mean is it really so hard to just not do it? What's so special about camping up there? I swear some people do it out of spite.
---
It's only for bolt-actions and revolvers. And last I heard it still works.
---
Good luck, covid sucks but dealing with the scorched no way.
---
Stop right there criminal scum your spree is at an end
---
Can't speak for everyone, but I hate it because they marketed it as a semi-serious stylistic team-based zombie survival build 'em up for half a decade. We were supposed to be able to scavenge various raw resources, yank down boarded up windows and fashion those planks into a barricade, set up a base and defend it against all odds, while enjoying the likable characters and their interactions, it was gonna be like 7 Days To Die meets Left 4 Dead with a somewhat cute cartoony style.
---
I must've checked the steam page and watched the trailer dozens of times hoping for news, and then it releases and a month later they put out a poorly thought out and even more poorly balanced battle royale who's entire gimmick was the fact it used the main mode's most barebones building mechanics.
---
At first I was fine with it because you can run two different modes of a game successfully, but Epic didn't do that. They basically dropped support for Save The World and dumped all their time and money into the BR mode. The story never got even halfway to the point that was talked about in interviews and we never got all the planned features they advertised, instead we got... flossing... and jump pads. There's no cycle of scavenging during the day and slaying zombies and protecting survivors at night, there's no clever character dynamics, hell, compared to what they implied, there's barely any building - watching someone turn into a 24 story wood and brick highrise .3 seconds after you pull the trigger is a far cry from the persistent zombie-flaying death bunkers we were promised.
---
But honestly, I don't hate Fortnite because it's popular, or because it's full of cross-promotion, or because it has nothing to do with a fortnite anymore, or even because it's a buggy, poorly designed battle royale that uses RNG to decide shootouts unless you stumble across one of the dozens of no skill one-shot weapons they've since implemented, I hate Fortnite because it's not Fortnite. Not the one I was promised, at least.
---
What can I say, I had all that you describe happening constantly, running away a bit helped. Removing Healing Factor fixed it for me. But it seems this bug is deeper and more complex. As far as I know was introduced with the fast travel cool down timer... 
---
Clearly they listened to 'the community' as we were all asking for this.  /s
---
If that's the case I would think furious + sneak damage would be your best bet to maximize dps before junkies or bloodied.
---
"They can't see me if I can't see them!!"
---
Same, brother. Same.
---
I just take the fallout76custom.ini file and put it on my desktop.  Put it back when I'm done with NW
---
Just an addition - regular grenades will make her take off again prematurely. We tested this two nights ago, and in 10 landings, a grenade made her instantly take off. after sub 5 seconds on the ground.
---
So yeah, don't throw grenades at her people.
---
I’ve not seen many issues of the queen not landing tbh, although usually I get bored and jetpack lag over the queen and get stuck on the roof of the map so idk
---
I ended up with a pile of the notes doing events and the daily quest. Can only exchange 20 notes a day.  If you end up with a bunch of caps, you can buy 300 gold for 6000 caps upstairs in the Wayward.
---
I've heard/noticed on this sub PS4 is less active than  Microsoft platforms-- xb1/pc, I believe it's because Bethesda started on pc, had their first big release on console (Xbox) with morrowind, and followed it up with fallout 3...
---
Xbox, and PC will always have more players based off lineage and that original fanbase.
---
I come from a similar background, the north of my country (Czechia) from where I come from is pretty much coal mining central, strip or surface mining, not deep mines. It still goes on to this day, yet, growing up in a post-socialist country, the "coal miner" was a model worker, you know the whole "working class" thing, heavily propagandized and revered during socialism (communism). 
---
Don't get me wrong - the work was and still is hard as hell, but I think the whole approach was different. It wasn't the company that was effin you over, it was the government. 
---
Nowadays? The pay is getting better with the inclusion of "hazardous environment" pay... But still...
---
Specifically Fragmentation Grenades, yes?
---
Edit: Never mind. Just saw you said regular grenades.
---
Perk Loadouts are coming Fall 2019-Spring 2020
---
Clipboards too. I think Sugar Grove has ruined me forever.
---
Shouldn't make a difference tho. So your saying because I play on ps4 we don't get many events even though server is full of people?
---
On the critical hits in the head while flying that cause the stagger, would it be better to shoot other parts or avoid critical shots in the air?  Are the wings now fixed to not cause a crippled effect?  I am now a bloodied rifleman.
---
Responders, priority alert!
---
I did the same and don't regret it...
---
A wave attack event where you get plans and can capture a deathclaw keep it at your camp and dress it as a maid or macho man
---
Yup, we didn't test the floater ones. I might test that out tonight.
---
Honestly, I prefer Grafton’s Mayor over Melody Larkin lol. I enjoy his grandiose tone and sometimes he’s kind of funny.
---
JUST MAKE SURE YOU BRING A LOT OF BULLETS.  THAT BIG ALPHA IS A HEAP OF TROUBLE!!
---
And the slight fps decrease
---
More cosmetic customization for the older pa’s
---
Please do let me know, my group has only tried the freezer grenades.
---
Sounds like you missed 15 attempts. Keep at it, you'll get there!
---
"Here's an apple and a gun. Don't talk to strangers, shoot them".
---
Yeah - mm gauntlet, meat hook and dcg all unarmed.  So OP
---
Will do. We'll give nuka grenades a try too.
---
I wouldn't say I'm casual but I have a very easy to do full health build that lets me get drop rewards everytime I do the queen. Literally just a furious DCG with the right perks. 1000 damage is nothing if you have a slight inkling for how any build works.
---
Edit: not trying to be an ass just want anyone discouraged to know a slight amount of work when doing any build can really make a difference.
---
This^, I keep looking at the floor wondering what I hit.
---
I’m level 74 and just last week I had the courage to join the SBQ fights. On my first two, even though I did a lot of damage to her, I didn’t get any loot. Is it because I don’t have super strong weapons like high level players? It doesn’t make sense.
---
Oh.  Wow.   !!!!
---
Funny enough, back before 76, I had a concept for FEV-affected bats called Shriekers that were basically flying piranhas. The slightest sound would alert them, and once one knew where you were, the whole swarm came in, shredding you down with a life leech effect and then moving on to the next meal.
---
About a month ago I found out about the movie The Silence and now I'm twice as mad because I didn't capitalize on my idea quick enough.
---
Yh the secret Door is so genious :D 
---
And at Level 100 u get really nice camp items too
---
It's honestly better to just not shoot her at all in the air unless she isnt actively agro'd to the event population. But I can't speak to a level of expertise regarding the specifics of cripple mechanics.
---
Thanks for lmk.    I guess I need to start rolling for these.
---
I literally hunted for a playground I could camp at with a spaceship to do this for a week when I started, I'm so happy it's finally a camp item
---
Nice!
---
Well it being instigating and being a bloodied Melee strength build, I'd average between 600 and 3000 based off chems, food perks, booze, perks, and and team bonuses while depending on the enemies toughness?
---
I haven't applied the proper unarmed perks yet to test it.
---
I'm assuming the 20% alone for proper unarmed cards, and being able to max out incisor now, will really push those numbers up!
---
What about your meat hook?!?
---
Or like let us mod
---
But he did it for the nookie
---
I’m level 65 now so I’m getting pretty close, can’t wait for that level 100 package.
---
I'll get rid of Healing Factor and see if it helps. Thanks :)
---
People do it to avoid the adds mainly I think but yeah its really not necessary the adds should die quickly if everyone is actually participating.
---
Minimum of 1000 damage for a drop. But the event can sometimes reward legendary items too. Try and focus fire as much as you can on the head when shes on the ground, and dont forget to use vats crits. But yeah, if enough high level people are around it can be difficult for newer people to have enough time to qualify for a drop. I don't understand why the damage bar is quite that high. 500 would be fine in my book
---
Yea probably because it’s used in combat and lever action rifles
---
I'm a bloodied meatbook build with no chems and alcohol and food, my base damage is just over 1.2k and crit about 3.3. I don't think I'm fully utilising me perks for unarmed. I'm sure theirs only one perk card for unarmed in strength isn't their?
---
Some events require a player to kick them off... encrypted, SBQ, the escort mission for the caravan?
---
I'm saying with less players you have less people kicking them off.
---
It's not a slight or jab at PS, just a numbers fact I was stating.
---
Yh u will enjoy it :) 
---
If u wanna take a look what u get, come to my camp, my GT is SeVn I Vario
---
Turn on your damage numbers. She ignores 70% of incoming damage.
---
Mothman demands to speak to the Overseer.
---
Honestly, if you don't want PvP, I'd recommend avoiding PvP zones (workshops).
---
Yea no.I will much rather spend my hard earned atoms on better things than a skin to fix the looks of a power armor.Besides the stat bonus on it is negligible when compared to other PA sets so no thank you.
---
Congratulations and best of luck with this new chapter of your life!
---
Yeah, that's fair enough dude I wasn't having ago. Just frustrating not being able to do violent night or radtuon rumble or uranium fever. Nukes and stuff are fine. I see plenty of them. Even though is mostly me setting them off and the full server just tag along for the sbq.
---
You can get all 5 or 6 mutations at once, with or without serums.
---
Oh, geez, this is going to make me sound stupid, but I didn't realize we could assign things to specific SPOTS on the wheel.   So I've looked it up and now know, thanks to you.  :)   Thanks also for the info on HP management.  I have Healing Factor on....it's a great one.
---
I can see what you mean about it making us better players.   I know I use cover much more often, which really wasn't necessary before.   At some point, I'm going to have to train myself to manage reloads tactically.
---
Honestly, a captain cosmos themed paint for ALL armors (not just pa) instead of the ghillie would've been fine with me, not saying I don't love the ghillie, it's cool but what does it really help me hide from?
---
That is a surefire way to get me to never open a stall again.  They're barely worth it now.
---
Good to know, I also believed the other ones were 1 armed...
---
I legit thought the only unarmed weapon in the game was your bare fist or boxing glove.
---
Very glad I know now!!!!
---
I dont know if we should be giving Fallout 1st member more benefits but sure, let's go with that... I'd say give more benefits to the regular players who are new and actually wanna play the game. I'm new and could already use a storage upgrade but I'm not forking out the 100 dollars a year
---
Also please stop wandering off, if we stay huddled up the queen won’t be flying all over the map and she hovers more
---
Why did they introduce the cool down timer it's the worst, never works right no one near me start count down fail wtf over and over
---
Yeah it dose that to all windows
---
2.2k hours and I've yet to find one. Definitely not common.
---
Yay! I’ll send you my PSN :)
---
Oh, so I alone have to do 1000 damage to her to get loot. I get it now. After a couple fights, I decided to only hit her when she’s on the ground since ammo loss is very high when she’s airborne. Thank you for the great tips! I was looking for advice like this.
---
Tbf, the game kind of rewards jack of all trades gameplay early on. Many of us had to redo special points purely out of simple ignorance or because a specific build becomes more desirable, myself included. But you are 100% correct, even a half assed build with the right perks in the right place, and a half decent weapon and you can easily contribute meaningful dps.
---
This is good to know, I’ll be more prepared for my next fight. Thanks
---
I called it a night after I realized my error in my ways! But yes, after browsing strength I only noticed the one perk card maxing at 3 stars for 20%
---
I think incisor compliments unarmed as well.
---
There might be ancillary cards under other special that help?
---
That would be scary. Was fighting a bunch of scorched and Scorchbeasts yesterday and an albino Deathclaw just came running at me from out of nowhere, that was scarier than anything I was fighting
---
I must be the only person left with a legitimate legacy weapon from og rng lol
---
If you can't get leader of the pack to spawn just server hop and do Riding Shotgun three times. You just have to talk to the guy in the suit outside the tunnel on the Cranberry Bog side to start it. If he wont start it its because its been done recently on that server, server hop and try again. There is the Blood Eagle Captain that spawns everytime and is always legendary. Plus you'll usually find another legendary blood eagle or maybe two. Even if you have to do it three times its at max 30 minutes plus you can get decent rewards from the Captain legendary drop or the quest rewards.
---
Happy to help, good luck out there.
---
Strangler pa parts unfortunately can no longer be traded or dropped
---
Dark matter skin is probably why
---
What if they might be 3 star legendary Wendigo's? :)
---
You mean like as in new vegas? Because that would be horrible... I'm up for it
---
The cell probably didn't load correctly. Getting out and back in should solve it.
---
To be fair, if your going to shit your pants, might as well be there
---
Oh I wish they would do it!
---
All this led up to the citizens eventually just burning down the mines and blowing up coal transports, too. Of course, these people were demonized as violent extremists and the companies paid everyone they could to make sure that's how it stayed in as many places as possible, a lot like the Free States or the Bot Blockers (Anti-Automation Activists? Idk if they have any canon group title aside from "protesters"). A group of people will only take poor treatment for so long before they give up on trying to be reasonable about it. The West Virginia Coal Riots are such an interesting read, and it goes to show how much hasn't changed since then. A new coat of paint on an age-old system.
---
There's a locked door next to the swimming pool near whitespring with a level 68 ghoul in.. I opened it, screamed and died ahahah
---
I have this bug where I sometimes go from NW to adventure mode and I keep hearing guitar noises
---
I'm not gonna lie, I was kinda dissapointed with the choice of ghillie skins for all armours. Given the suit already did that, and honestly I think they could have gone with a simple attractive paint job ... because those would have been much more ... well ... good?
---
This isn't possible, but it's the stuff of nightmares...
---
the Slocum joes vendor to the Fasnachts Music machine, which is also a cage that holds the Raider Punk so he can comment his nonsense as lyrics to that remixed fresh hell
---
Any heavy gunner who‘s not a meta or energy guns user makes ammo. 
---
The converter gets UI improvements, the ratios will stay the same. 
---
Any more questions?
---
another one to add to the list of "cool stories that didnt happen" that reddit loves to provide.
---
Do I want to wear a Nazi armband? Hell no.
---
Do I want use a walter p38? Hell yes.
---
Always check for poopers!
---
Damn, I was hoping you could place items like in fallout 4
---
AWOL whatever it's called at RobCo has 2 or 3 legendary Mr Handys
---
The ghillie skins are awfull... I put the skin on my backback, jesus christ what a waste of cheap materials.
---
Thanks, now I'm dead from 3 heart attacks and a stroke simultaneously
---
I‘d be fine with the way it is if they‘d simply adjust the weight because right now gunpowder weighs way too much.
---
Wouldn‘t complain if they‘d classify it as junk, though.
---
I can confirm that I personally found my plans in one of the cemetery safes, but sometimes I wonder if the drop chance percentage varies from player to player for specific items
---
Chems and food work as you probably know, when I can be arsed to fetch them, base damage does go over 2.2k and crit over 5k but its work fetching chems and food all the time haha
---
Thanks for the warning.
---
1: make a ticket. This is not a Bethesda forum.
---
2: as far as I know, Bethesda never deletes single items, they sometimes make full account clear, but this is rare...
---
Are you sure you did not drop it, or did not feed it to the legendary machnie?
---
Maybe you.
---
Even if they gave me a solid 3k score points just for logging in there and put a fart into the bushes, id rather grind those points with the repeatable exp challenge. Thx, but no thx.
---
I want the plan. I want the radioactive barrels so badly. I waaaaaant itttt
---
Bethesda or meteor 2020!
---
No because you need make gun powder from to junk items it just won't work
---
The backpack skin looks incredibly bad, yeah.
---
They listened to the community... apparently.
---
Once or twice a play session I load up on all the ammo and garbage I collected on the last session and hand it out to newer players (sub level 50 or so) 
---
I don't have to worry about a bunch of stuff because of the way I play so I just give away a bunch of stuff. 
---
Then everything that might be useful I put on one of my four vendors for 50 caps each. (mostly plans) because that's how I rounded out most of the plans I was missing, from random players doing the same shit.
---
You're a shit bag
---
Sounds great! 😎
---
Have you tested explosive bait? I know it works on regular ones, unsure about the queen
---
Contacting support won't do anything. I've been doing a little back and forth with them on the issue of ghost budget and it took them 5 messages of "non answers" to come out and say that the support team couldn't do anything about it. At most they just gave a link to "leave feedback" with the development team, but if you do they don't message you back.
---
😹😹😹😹😹
---
Game seems to run fine for me? Try reinstalling?
---
Perks.... perks
---
It’s super balanced as long as you perk correctly. Do you have the automatic weapons perks?
---
K we’ll have you actually tested it out cause it was suppose to change in wastelanders update?
---
Last time I played Its a Trap the scorchbeast spawned about a mile away and got glitched in place. I had to track it down myself and it was an easy kill, but sweet Jesus 🤣
---
and it would ask for privacy, then close the door
---
We... have not, I don't think. I'll put it on the testing list :) We tend to run 3-6 SBQ a night so load up any other suggestions and I'll report back.
---
Is there anything else behind this? Like, do you need to log out and in before moving multiple times, going in and out of load zones, different areas of the map?
---
I often can get her to land right in front of me using that technique (getting out on flat open ground), usually away from other players, who are all bunched up on and around the fence and tents.    
---
Aren't they fixing the Queen so that we can cripple her again?  These long, drawn-out fights that chew up so much ammunition.....   not just as much fun.
---
It's honestly so weird, because when the game was announced the amount of vitriol being spewed about a multiplayer Fallout and talk about how everyone would just be an asshole like in Rust would make you think the community would be pretty toxic. But it's the total opposite. Yeah, you'll eventually run into a guy who just won't stop swinging at you even when you're pacifist, or a guy who goes out of his way to nuke your camp, or someone raging about someone not taking a pylon or not getting a 3 star to drop, but more often than not if you're under level 50 you'll have total strangers fast travel to you just so they can give you a supply drop and some tips, or even help you mow through a few events or quests even if they've probably got more important things to do.
---
I started out my main character planning on doing a raider boss, but just playing around with people (and not being a PVP player in general) has made it so every time I see someone leaving the vault for the first time, I fast travel there and drop a couple dozen diluted stims, some packaged food and water, about 300 .38 rounds, and - if I've had a chance to run Leader of the Pack before they exit - drop a couple of low level legendaries, as well. I'll throw in a random hat for good measure, too. I've worked it into the roleplay that by giving them a leg up at the start I can guarantee a bigger haul once they set themselves up and collect the interest through proper raiding. I've yet to collect on anything.
---
People in this sub seem to hate NW almost as much as people on r/fallout hate 76. You are entirely correct though. This mode really is balanced, people just need to learn to perk correctly and how to aim.
---
Support got back to me earlier. Big fat "can't help you at all, support doesn't have the tools but you can leave feedback"
---
I havent done it myself because id prefer to not be banned so im not totally sure, id just move it maybe 3-4 times, if it doesnt work relog and try again. If that doesnt work after a few tries then idk
---
Never thought of nuking there.  I wonder if that's reachable while also nuking Monongah Mine for the new event.  If so, might be much more common!
---
This would be nice: 15 item limit (Icebox) or 20 item limit (Magazine rack) for examples, but it removes the weight from the general stash.
---
I stopped opening doors without a shotgun pointed at them within two days of starting Fallout 4. Still do it even in games which aren't Fallout now
---
I defended this challenge but last night it took me forever to find 3. I found 2 right away at whitespring but then I couldn’t for the life of me find a 3rd until about an hour later when uranium fever finally popped.
---
This. I regularly blow through 4-5k rounds in a session and it seems that just about everyone has stopped selling ammo now which sucks
---
That explains why my raider skywalk can have walls on one side of the top floor but not the other, and no ceilings at all.
---
With you a 100% on this it's driving me nuts man..takes me 3-4 attempts almost every time to activate..plus many times I have to run out of a area to make it work at least 60% of the time it never work inside a building or sometimes from my own camp...makes getting to events in time a real bitch
---
Life is old there
---
This. A late night post at 530am EST.. very possible you stored/traded/dropped/sold it.
---
If you're on PC, let me know friday afternoon and I'll see how much I have to spare. Lamorak\_2000
---
Grafton day doesn’t guarantee a legendary... or is there some hidden legendary somewhere that I don’t know about and have been doing the event wrong?
---
Agreed. I didn't know they drop from above in the Mire when I went in for the first time so actually terror-Alt-F4ed at one point when a wendigo suddenly dropped from the sky two feet in front of me
---
Yes, I use it in my build now and can confirm it works exactly as I described.
---
Sells instantly so one reason why.
---
I should really start walking everywhere to see these new events, but Speed Demon makes it tedious
---
I did this in a mirror at work.  I tried to open it to see what was inside and then I realized I'm not actually in fallout 76.    Or am I??????......
---
same here
---
If you can't seem them, they can't see you, right..?
---
IMO there seems to be a dead zone in the events timeline, its around Lode bearing event, then teres just like an hour or more with nothing to do on the server, and if you relog, it seems like the new server your put on, is like +- a half hour back in the event rotation
---
so it seems like the events are on a semi fixed rotation, if your around the lode bearing event your f\*cked, and if you relog, your even more f\*cked
---
What the hell is this? A trick i havent seen one until now lol
---
As long as you don’t place your camp, it will be where you left it the next time you log in
---
Yes, I will open a ticket. I have been playing this game almost every day since BETA and am beyond certain I didn’t drop or grind it in a machine. It is always in my personal inventory because I never even stash it.
---
It just went POOF! while I was playing.
---
Y'all expect people to know and follow these unwritten "rules" yet people seem incapable of following them when the game actually states them. Did Radiation Rumble today. 8-12 players present and only one bothered to collect Ore. Me. Even though the objective is to collect ore and the NPCs even repeatedly say so throughout. Dont even get me started on Encryptid and some of the others.
---
It even has a very fallout appropriate name.
---
There’s lots of space to add stuff on the far west of the map, just add a bridge on the river.
---
I mean it'd be good for NW... but you can't even use them!
---
I hope the next season has better aesthetics, most people wear clothing over the armor anyways
---
Well that is certainly not as it could be. So smart of them not to include the seasons and atomic shop items to the pts /s
---
I'm a bit confused. I'm doing a rifle build, have put Perception at 15 with the hope of levelling all 3 ranks of Rifle, Expert Rifle, and Master Rifle.
---
Yet even though I've got to Level 50, I don't have access to Expert Rifle perk cards yet? I've got Rifle, and Master Rifle... Is this a bug, or do the cards you get come out in a random order?
---
I think I’ll test it now
---
Do this but be aware, %90 of the time when you log out pf the game and come back, you’ll see that the windowed walls go back to their naked state. You’ll have to convert them again and again each time you log in.
---
Was farming Reeds too haha
---
Playing Warzone causes me to try to take wood from any fallen log I find. It takes a minute to re-adjust while playing.
---
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
---
Perk Loadout manager mod already exists, a lot of people are using it  
---
on PC
---
get out there in the open on flat land, slightly away from the other players, and she'll often land right in front of you, facing you....  perfect for  melee  
---
or have you tried that already and she still doesn't?
---
Player camps should be free FT. There's no sense in not doing it and it'd promote the CAMP aspect.
---
Sure you can, you just downvote and then upvote.
---
But then what else are people going to spend them on? You're already getting caps thrown at you for doing literally anything in the game and the list of things you can buy with them gets shorter for every day you play. Unless you go out of your way to buy all your junk/ammo/aid instead of picking it up as you play, you will very quickly run out of anything to do. Even if you want to buy every single plan in the game, even all PA mod plans and serum recipes, by level 200-300 you will accomplish that and then have nothing left to buy
---
It's not like buying a god-tier legendary is going to cost you a fortune, the dupers are making sure those crash into worthlessness and bethesda's recent unbanning is making it clear they're fine with that
---
Irl they use “USSS”
---
Me, on reading the title: "Public teams are great, surely they don't need revamped already."
---
Me, after reading the post: "This needs to be done RIGHT NOW."
---
I find it more interesting than the old WoW rep grind for the racial mounts and the proto-drakes, that's for sure.
---
Yeah, people are bad. Also it highly depends on how she lands, if it would work like it should it wouldn't take 20min.
---
This. Also most high level player don't have the damage either, fucking leechers. And on top of that they don't even let the SBQ land. But for bloodied players we need to be out of the radiation if we want to do high damage. 
---
I would also like to rant about high level players with heavy guns... They do exactly 0 damage in my eyes (of course there are exceptions). "Oh, your minigun deals 3 damage per shot but your excuse is high fire rate?" "The .50 does 50 per shot but has quite high fire rate?" I fucking do 800 per shot with my handmade on rifle build and close to 8000 with melee build.  You can literally see when a good melee player joins the fight but now we can't even do that with SBQ flying around, not falling down and 20 heavy lasers and machine guns chipping it down for fucking 20 minutes.
---
Sheepsquatch, Grafton Monster, &amp; Fog Crawlers are the boss spawns. I think the only high level deathclaw that spawns in the friendly animal you need to protect.
---
Yep it should be free and by any chance you on Xbox and if so do you have a spare 50 cal machine gun plan
---
Lvl 74. Did Collision Course with a lvl 7 player. I was quite impressed, he single handedly managed to kill all the scorched with his pipe gun. I just stood on the roof and watched him run around. And he left without looting the crate as soon as the event ended.
---
The whole point of fast travel cost is to remove caps from the economy and curb inflation. We need more ways to do this, not less.
---
You're so naive. What made you think they ADD something or they FIX something?
---
In the words of God Howard "no"
---
I can save you the effort of testing.
---
https://twitter.com/i/status/1286607928510705665
---
It will do but I see many more rolls in your future
---
They should make it so we can find these around halloween
---
if it's not the placement of said station, search ps4 cache and rebuilding. it appeared to also helped server load times.
---
[edit: Also just had a Power Armor station F happen. bugged me into Slenderman mode, and the power armor frame just glided around behind me in a standing position, like it was on roller skates. Sure enough, fast travel not available, and soon i was in the "underworld". yay.
---
Lol....you mean to tell me one of the most popular spot for killing ghouls and just regular xp on a day where the daily is killing ghouls are all dead and your surprised why?
---
Oof. I'm going through the same thing and I really had hope you would make it out with some sort of fix.
---
I was moments away from moving my camp to try to delete them, and stopped when came across this post.
---
I had 3 put into my camp. I don't even need ammo! I just leave them unlocked for anyone to come and grab some 5mm and 10mm.
---
I'll eventually move my camp and just do some camp budget glitch to get it back up.
---
*Inhales*... WEST VIRGINIA!!
---
I was inconvenienced many weeks due to duping players.
---
😆😭
---
You used to not be able to fast travel at all when enemies were nearby
---
Yes Tranquility Lane (Vault 112), residents are in VR pods created by a Vault-Tec Futur-Tec scientist.
---
And in Fallout 4 you have the Memory Den with Memory Loundgers to relive past memories.
---
Edit: There was also the Operation: Anchorage doc ; where you relieved the battle of Anchorage against Chinese troops
---
I don't even like NW myself, I've only played it two or three times since the season started. But most of the negativity I see towards it here is beyond stupid. It's always the same act of people pretending that they are being forced into playing it for the 250 (I guess 500 this week) daily score, as if the other 8 challenges don't exist. Or the good ol' fortnite copy argument. You know, the kinds of things a ten-year-old would come up with. I really wish people could just flat out say "I don't like this mode, it's not for me" and leave it at that
---
Thank you but I’ll test it myself. I’ve had multiple people in my discord say different and I’d like to test it right now as the games stands
---
I check the Grove after every launch and still haven't seen one 😭
---
Keep up the good work!
---
I think a large problem with the event is who ever is farming ore misses out on alot of XP and loot. I had a friend who did it alot and nearly uninstalled the game due to him doing all the work and 8 people with power armour just sat there shooting everything and fighting over each other just to get a kill. There is no incentive to collect the ore aside from maybe slightly better rewards
---
People who have sexlabs installed ..... and thats it.
---
irl
---
It does help; thanks for killing for other things that show up while we use things like a Hunters Prime gauss minigun.   It doesn't take many of those or things like those to put her down quickly.....but only if we don't have to kill the next radroach or yao gai that shows up.   You make it better.   Thanks!
---
Because she changed her focus to a non reachable target, this game really needs a controllable aggro system so we can tank her properly!
---
Why is there no easter egg in 76 where you pass out and wake up in Skyrim then go back after Helgen
---
I disagree. Bethesda isn’t known for having the best RNG around. Think back to the first Old Man Winter mask which dropped once or twice in total for MAYBE each platform and that was it. Duped items allowed for high end and hard to acquire items to be traded on a much larger scale. Suddenly a lot of people had access to items that could’ve taken literally years to acquire. The only “negative” effect is items got cheaper. 
---
If you don’t want to touch a duped item because it feels too easy, then you’re welcome to wait for your own drop. If you ever want a legacy you’ll have to accept that if you’re trading for it, it’s an insanely high chance it was duped.
---
The thing I like about this game is that your actions don’t affect my gameplay and my actions don’t affect yours
---
Okay I mean it's up to you to not believe that clip I just made for you in the past ten minutes. After you test it I recommend telling the people in your discord that they're working off incorrect information, lol
---
Rolls? 
---
I only some what just started with bullion
---
Rifle Gaming did a series on worthwhile places to nuke. Whitesprings, Morgantown, Monongah, the Charleston DMV, West Tek, and Prime Fissure are about the only viable places. They all have a ton of enemies or great flux availability, but they're the only notable ones in the game, really.
---
Downvoted for asking a question really?
---
We don't fear them, we just jump around them!
---
Great summary. South Park did a good episode about this but with Amazon instead
---
I always collect ore, and as much as I can. But Im so over this event. Next time I'm also just farming ghouls and I am not going to collect any ore because I never get any xp for killing ghouls and I always miss out on legendaries. AND I dont even know how many times these campers let the scavengers die which means I collected ore for nothing.
---
I went to watoga because there a 3 or more spawns for power armor. With server hopping it took less than an hour to get a full t51 set
---
Well not everyone is bloodied... 
---
Dupers can't ruin my dream of making Katniss Everdeen with their silly Fixers. I need a broken-ass bow that doesn't work in VATS with outright sexual manual aim traits....
---
Im even gonna do the Mocking Jay whistle over zone/area chat before the SBQ takes an underwhelming yet satisfying hit.

It's a pain early on - until you get iron fist/martial artist/incisor and a decent weapon (modded mole miner gauntlet will work).
---
Your best bet at level 15ish is to pump points into Sneak and Ninja - the x3 dmg will help a bit.
---
Don’t be jealous like that.  It’s silly.
---
I think for most people Uny/ + AP refresh/ Sentinel or Cavalier would be ideal. I would say keep crafting for better. The grind for a good Uny SS set is rough but well worth it when you get all the pieces. :)
---
Bro, riding a bike through a field thinking 'oh look at all that razorgrain !'
---
This doesn't work. Your camp stored blueprints don't show up at claimed workshops
---
Fun fact! They didn't burn the mines down. That was the mining companies. They contacted a green movement and asked how to clean up the local air. They gave them air filters that traps the smog in the Ash heap. However,  in the same terminal, they found out there could use these filters to get more ore out of the ground by lighting the mines on fire and having the ash get collected by the filters. So, they set fire all any old mines they had once they was picked clean.
---
FT costs are a cap sink. They're in the game for a reason, and they won't be going anywhere, unfortunately.
---
It's what you call the randomness of what you will get like rolling a dice
---
I appreciate you trying to help but I like to see things for myself and Your probably right but I’m going to do this for science and then yes... if your right I will tell everyone. I have plenty of resources to craft serums over and over so why not.
---
Agreed.  
---
If you don't enjoy the mode, you don't enjoy the mod.  Nothing wrong with that.
---
But, a lot of people do enjoy the mode.  Rather than wasting time on the internet complaining that you don't enjoy something other people do, why not just spend your time on something you DO enjoy?
---
why would I be jealous of a no lifer...
---
hah...

I hear ya. It's especially bad if you're also playing any other fallout game. It's like playing 4, then going back to 3 or NV. I switch myself in and out of 1st person about 10,000 times trying to engage VATS.
---
yesterday I got  uny +1E WWR .... solar armor. fuck my life.
---
&gt;it's Gauss can't sell or trade it:(
---
I’m just waiting on food buffs to go away so I can start. Then we’ll have the results an hour from that.
---
Rule 1. Store your junk
---
You can make a horned yao guai by slipping a wendigo trophy behind it. Works with a lot of the mounts.
---
Before they revamped the CAMP system in Wild Appalachia you could stack concrete partitions and I made a dope little bunker guard post. Had it for over a year, then scrapped it because I needed the budget and I didn't need use it anymore. Never be able to get that one again.
---
Would be cool a special glowing bobblehead with an effect buff, like it!
---
Ghille power armor!
---
What makes it unplayable, might I ask? Cant you just unlink it through BGS site?
---
I'll check though.might have this and the extra claw plan confused
---
Country roads...

Welcome to the game!
---
Legendary scrip - This is basically a case of scrapping legendary weapons/armour at any railway station. Keep an eye out for events Free Range and Uranium Fever as they guarantee have legendary enemies. Aside from that, most people have a farming route for legendary enemies (Usually West Tek, Radio Array, Burrows). I'd recommend spending an hour on Youtube to see some examples :) The limit of legendary scrip you can get from this method is 150 per day.
---
EDIT - the event leader of the pack is low level but guarantees you 3 legendary enemies too.

Bullion - Public Events (The ones with a ! in the hexagon) will reward you with 2, 3 or 4 treasury notes for easy, medium and hard events respectively. You also have the daily quests which reward you with both notes and reputation. You trade these in at a Gold Press machine in either Foundation or Crater, a maximum of 20 per day.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Yeah took a friend only approx 15-20k of legendary modules to get a complete set of unyielding sentinel with a good third perk 😂
---
There are many mods adding glowing effects to world objects on *the nexus dot com*, I used them a lot on Fallout 4, love them.
---
I was talking about the IRL protests, actually haha
---
my strategy too
---
Report, report, report. I'm doing my part!
---
Especially in public 😆
---
If they put in something kind of like rifts in Diablo 3 or some sort of endless mode it might actually give more of an end game. They would have to consider how exp is going to work in those modes but I think people would want full exp (and in games like diablo 3 it actually gives more exp!) given the grind required for legendary perks.
---
The game just needs more things to do since I would argue there is no real end game.
---
Some of that people lost their hole inventory and level on their characters. It's not that bad as you think.
---
Yeah, dont get it either... once i got the backpack mod i was done with the rest of the skins..
---
If you don’t mind, I’d love that knowledge, too!
---
@SPARTYCAT22
---
Tempting.  Still a pass.
---
Martial artist benefits all melee
---
The RNG in this game is a fickle mistress of mysteries, that's for sure.
---
You need to plan a build, just like in Adventure.
---
Except for the prevalence of explosives, there aren't any unfair advantages beyond personal skill.
---
I've definitely got the extra claw plan, that was duped along with all the Xmas present drops.
---
What's a good try? Sorry you lost you stuff.
---
OK 🤷‍♂️
---
Agreed +karma
---
The best about this is that some of them are downright broken. The Secret Service skin renders the whole set unusable because you can't see shit in 1st person. No idea about the others but given Bethesdas track record of not testing shit I assume that's not the only one.
---
So many amazing places they left out, blackwater falls comes to mind as well. Also, why the hell did the settlers pick the highest point to set up? My goodness by October they would have freezing temperatures daily
---
I have a realllllly hard time not picking up old dead car batteries I see on the ground, gotta say
---
I don't want her to hover, I want her to LAND.   To do that, I have to wander off into that flat field.   And 9/10ths of the time, she lands right in front of me.   So, no.   Not going to stay bunched up with the fence dwellers.
---
Nuke the border of Ash Heap and Savage Divide. There's two Assault Nodes (the special random encounter spawn required to spawn a Colossus) within walking distance there. Just wall back and forth and clear them both out until you get one.
---
God no! 
---
My camp is purposely layed out to keep Allies away from me. If I have a double bed they will be walking in the main house area and I will be tempted to put a bullet in their head after hearing the same dialogue a million times.
---
You 100%on that? Because I'm pretty sure I've used camp blueprints at workshops, but tbh I dont claim then often.
---
Problem is that it's not so secret anymore lol
---
&gt;hella
---
What year is this, 1997?
---
Take that back.
---
Just tried it. You can do basic blueprints, sure. But not the ones that are made when you move your camp. The basic ones are just guidelines, and don't affect budget at all. I lost another 1% of my budget seeing if it would work.
---
I'm having problems with server hopping. Every time i leave and rejoin, no matter how long i wait, I get put back in the same server. Golf club is a great way to level up though.
---
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

How many people do you reckon use it? Also could you make a guide to using mods with 76?

How does that make it out of batch.

\*Fights ghouls. Glowing one comes and try to raise the ghouls. I have bloody mess. Ghouls in little bits.\*

Still wary from all the grenade bouquets from Fallout 4...
---
LoL
---
bye bye camp budget
---
I’ll just sleep in the armour.
---
Ahh.... classic.
---
For me personally i hope never or only when they finally fixed the most annoying bugs and implemented new solid content for ppl who actually want to use all the op gear they earned since beta for maga 😜
---
2 weeks of casual play (like, 30 minutes a day and not even getting all my challenges every day) and I'm over 1/4th of the way there. Even disregarding the recently added extra challenges or the double daily SCORE days, I'd have been able to hit 100 in time. Now I've got double daily challenges. I'll probably hit 100 by week 6 or 7.
---
Thats when i put the grenade launcher and fatman to    work. Tag them all or kill them all.
---
Regarding the positioning, search for images and i've heard you need to do it before starting the event (repairing or initiating pre combat check).
---
My favorite right now is the NW firepit in a whitesprings round dining table, nice conversational piece even though I can't fit it into my cave &gt;_&lt;
---
gunpowder is Misc. and flux is **JUNK** ... Bethesda logic
---
Well that's what I'm saying right? Dont try and place the whole camp blueprint.  Blue print just the ammo factory  in your camp, move your camp so it's not out at all, then use the ammo blueprint to place it at a workshop however many times you have the ghost factory THEN place your camp again, if that makes sense?
---
My crew runs two to three triple nukes every day.  My personal observations after 2500 hours are.
---
If you have a magic or hacked gun put it in your stash box. While destroying the queen in seconds is cool if you are the only one in the fight, you are taking enjoyment from everyone else. 
---
We like to draw out the fight to about 10 minutes.   The XP and legendary spawns from the mobs is what you want here, sure the queen is also a three star but you can have many more if the fight is drawn out. Normally we take her to regenerate on the first landing and switch to mobs. 
---
It is ok to be on roofs and fences as long as you do not have her agro. If you are the target of her sonic screams get down to the ground so she will land. 
---
Don't shoot her when she is in the air. An occasional pot shot is good to keep her agro active but save your ammo. 
---
Did I say to leave your bugged and or hacked guns in your stash box. If you are using them on a public server during a queen fight I hope that the fleas of 1000 camels infest your arm pits.
---
Too bad dingus, bit of research and it’s already been datamined from 76.
---
I forgot to add that I complimented his armor that was so heroic looking and we spent a good five minutes just talking about how fabulous our characters looked. We popped up a stash box and went through the whole wardrobe! I even build a "changing room" so he wouldn't see me on my tidy whites. 
---
It is still the first date!
---
is this actually a troll post or made by some kind of cave homosapiens?
---
Really high vendor prices used to get a group nuked.  Or a bunch of non legendary weapons making people waste caps to travel only to be very disappointed.  I haven’t done it but have seen it talked about.  So if you didn’t do anything else to upset someone like going to an event and one shorting legendaries that spawn in I’d guess it’s your vendors that got it nuked.
---
And that's what I'm saying. Just the blueprint doesn't count as anything in any budget. The blueprint tab in the camp is just that- a blueprint. The blueprint that's made when camps are moved isn't accessible in a workshop. 
---
And in case you did mean the just a plain Jane blueprint, it does nothing. I must have placed 50 at the airport from a regular blueprint, and it did nothing.
---
I got lucky and rolled unyielding on my second roll
---
I know for a fact, that stuff like this happens. Was playing with my friend (long time ago though) and we were just standing there because he was having a quick cigarette. He had his TSE Lever equipped (I could see it in his hands) and then all of a sudden, he had a Gatling equipped. I was asking, what he‘s doing with it since he‘s a rifle build and he was like „doing with what?“, I said „with the Gatling.“, „what Gatling?“, „the one in your hands“, „I have my TSE equipped.“, „no you have not.“, „Damn you’re right, where tf is my TSE?? It’s not in my inventory anymore!!“ We checked the surroundings – no paper bag – we both went theough his complete inventory – no TSE. It just vanished from one second to the other.
---
Those ⬆️
---
You have to do a lot of damage.  Turn on damage numbers even some decent weapons are only doing 3 or 4 damage per bullet and you have to do thousands of damage to get loot.
---
Original Fallout Deathclaws weren't a huge deal. You kill at least five of them in a row at Boneyard.
---
There is still "coal camps" now just towns. London WV is a prime example but if your getting into the heritage just look up the real meaning behind Red neck sad story there it's not what most think
---
I would love to have the ability to show off power armor in a camp. The issue is the servers have been borderline unstable from the grt-go of this game. Think of every player, their camp, their stash, all their atom shop stuff. It would just be to much on the servers. Between that and running an old used bandaid as a game engine, I just don't think it would help make the game any better.
---
I would love to have it, but I just don't see it happening.
---
Or Bethesda fix explosive weapons in this game because nobody uses them. Sometimes I wonder if anyone from Bethesda actually played this game more then 1 hour.
---
M8 its nice to see you opening up to the public as there are a lot of great ppl out there in the wasteland and you might should read the inside the vault articles from time to time as they patched nearly all ways to grief ppl.
---
But may i ask you to explain further why pvp people should be banned in your opinion?
---
. I believe this game would have crashed and burned a long time ago but it's awesome community is what keeps it going. Definitely what keeps me coming back
---
Yeah. If it isn't for sale at a vendor, don't trust the deal
---
‘Hey Bethesda, a ghillie suit would be cool.’ 
---
‘Sure thing, here’s one for Nuclear Winter.’ 
---
‘Sweet. Thanks.’ 
---
‘And here are some more!’ 
---
‘Actually, the first one was enou-‘ 
---
‘Ghillie wood armor; ghillie leather armor; ghillie metal armor!’ 
---
‘No, really, the first one was more than enou-‘ 
---
‘Ghillie combat armor; ghillie scout armor!’
---
‘Please, I beg you.’  
---
‘Ghillie marine armor; ghillie *robot* armor!’
---
‘Bethesda, stahp!’
---
Harsh like a week suspension and a final warning?
---
Yes make DC stronger.
---
Yes more character classes to RP would be great. Should also be able to play as a ghoul.
---
No, how would Terminator fit into fallout. That not 50's scifi at all, see the Mechanist. I don't know how far along the institute is atm but could possible be a synth.
---
No, how would Avenger skins fit into fallout. Besides fallout all ready has in universe comic book characters.
---
A few selfish scumbags don't represent everyone who got unsuspended last night. Some of us took that final warning seriously and we're grateful we get to play again. The first thing I did when I realized Beth hadn't deleted anything was to get rid of the large holiday gifts I had from a previous trade. I'll never deal or trade player to player again. I'll never dupe or cheat in any way.
---
It really sucks when other players ruin your Queen runs, but if you're playing on public servers, unfortunately, that's the outcome you might get from time to time.
---
If you're on Xbox and you ever want to have a clean, honest Queen run with a few nice people let me know. I play everyday now...again, and I'm itching to off that bit...
---
It’s pure RNG. You might roll Vanguard on the next one. It might take 100 rolls before you see it.
---
I grew up in WV (little town outside of Charleston called Nitro) not too far from the real world versions of Poseidon and the Nuka Cola (a coal power plant and Pepsi facility). 
---
I made the mistake while there of putting off seeing a lot of the sights... take the time to travel. Do tourist stuff. I didn’t, and wish I had.
---
I whole heatedly disagree holy shit, I can deal with most monsters on any game except those. They give me the massive heeby jeebies and I try avoid them as much as possible lmao I dunno why. I think it's their sound
---
wow, man, you got serious trust issues :D    
---
i play public only and i want to tell you, that 99% of the others wont harm you. most people just do their thing or try to find someone they can pile up bc they got too much stuff. i started just like 3 months ago but in these 300 hours, ive met 2 assholes (a lvl 11 guy constantly shooting me with his lvl 5 hunting rifle from like 3 feet and a another trying to force pvp with his laser rifle) and thats it. most of the players are nice and helpful. consider joining a public server more often, it could help you :)
---
Honestly, I hope you are seeking mental health treatment from a psychologist.
---
This post screams 'I have mental health issues'.
---
If you are not receiving help, please get it.
---
It is one thing to be introverted, but you have taken it to a whole other level, and some of your statements may indicate PTSD.
---
Yes we need more caves! The picture is ominous and would fit Appalachia lore and setting pretty well. I’m intrigued with the organ playing and having some sort of mutated cave sloth that inhabits it.
---
Harsh like a one year IP ban and account and teabagging their mum twice a week
---
Please man, this is the only thing keeping me going as a PA build.
---
Was waiting for "open the door, get on the floor, everybody walk the dinosaur" the entire time readying this, tbh.
---
 Congrats on putting your toes in the water. If you're on XB1 feel free to add me and I can be a "supplier" to find stuff you need so you dont have to stress so much. My camp/playstyle/post apocalyptic view point is communal help which is why my camp is designed to be inviting and has free food and water.
---
They just suspended a lot of accounts for a whole 5 days and a "plzzzz dont do that anymore because you buy atoms and we need money ktnxbye" note. Isn't that harsh enough?
---
"Every time you come over for a BBQ you take my propane tank"

---
Let's not get carried away
---
So equal chance for all?
---
I saw this post and then saw you in my building team, I hope the food and bobbleheads help a bit!
---
I was too, but its easier for the 76 servers to keep track of individual junk in containers vs the precise position of 1000 lawn gnomes all over the yard. FO4 kept those recorded in a file
---
on the local system on the players machine.
---
Correct
---
If you have the flamethrower trap you can make a double bed. I have one at my camp so my gf and. I can get "well rested" together.
---
It's entirely possible they dropped it but you can't be serious about the 530am EST part. Timezones are a thing, you know.
---
This brings back memories. It would be nice to have an ancient glowing one or something that had beefed up HP and this mechanic. Might even create more ghouls than radiation rumble!
---
You calling me dingus for what? I usually try to just express my opinion without telling that its bad as for other ppl it may be important... why you all get offended if someone doesnt share your opinion? I dont mind if they get implemented even today m8, just me personally has no use for it and i personally see other things more important 🙄
---
Ah. So cheating.
---
Hope you get banned.
---
Showing objects glowing in the game world is cheating.
---
I would like something along the Fractals of the Mists in Guild Wars 2. A series of daily, high end repeatable dungeons with random elements and challenges.
---
I scripped one of my favorites by accident because of the insane lag this game sometimes likes to annoy you with.
---
Double xp weekends really help leveling.  Go to every queen battle you will die so make sure you drop any junk you have collected before you go.  Try and tag as many spawning creatures as you can during the fight and you will level up faster.  This also helps as all the special legendary gear you get from the main story will be lower level and useless to you after level 50.  So try and get at least level 50 before doing all the quests.  
---
Stealthy is very op.
---
I've found that I much better when I join alone and hide the entire time. When I'm alone I almost end up in the top 10 and I've even won a few times. But when I'm with a team they all rush into everything and die, and I feel compelled to follow them for some reason.
---
I hate to be 'that guy' but some of you are using 'ban' in place of 'suspension' and they're two different things. For example, I wasn't banned last week and unbanned last night, I was temporarily suspended last week and unsuspended last night. Just saying, I didn't hear about people being unbanned, I heard about them being unsuspended. If I'm wrong and people actually went from being perma-banned to being unbanned, ok, I stand corrected, but I think it's just a few people using the wrong verbs.
---
I'm not discounting your experience but...
---
I have been playing a few times a week, so occasionally..?, since the legendary run.
---
I'm level 11.  I've made it to the final two twice, and top ten multiple times. And have watched people play after I die.
---
I have yet to run into a hacker or see one hacking after I die.
---
Maybe I'm lucky but I feel like there's n echo chamber here and the number of hackers isn't that bad..
---
I struggled with this as well, but here's the thing. Power Armor sadley isn't unique. 
---
Anyone can get any of it in the game (1 exception I can think of is the Old Man Winter Faschnadt Helmet and a few limited time paints that will come back). So to me, yeah it would be cool, but there's nothing unique about it. Add the camp space in, more bugs on top of the ones that haven't been fixed since launch, and a 18 players with all their camp stuff, a few nukes and I just don't see a server surviving.
---
The one exception that could bring having a power display stand to fruition is the addition of instanced interiors in Season 3. I believe that could work but I don't know how or if that would make a server more or less unstable. Just my opinion, I hope they add it, but today as the game is just not seeing it.
---
Congrats on your move, this is a great story. Wish you all the best in RL Appalachia. For my part, I walk into my bedroom and find myself thinking, cool, a fan, I'll scrap that... lol 
---
I did something similar to you, mate. Grew up in Massachusetts, then, as an adult, I tried living in Florida and Texas, then travelled to Australia and found my place. Got a job over here, dragged my wife along with me, been here in Sydney for 15 years now. We don't have Fallout, but it's still pretty cool.  :)
---
Ironically both games came out in what? 2 months of each other?
---
Yes it is ring, but try rolling unyielding, my character loves lifesaving &amp; nocturnal rolls 5 to 1 over any unyielding piece.
---
Well, not too many, local chat is basically dead but global can be entertaining, and it also has a trade channel, which is fairly active. You can ask for advice on global and people will usually help out. There's also whisper for 1 on 1 chat, and color indication on player names that have the mod. 
---
Using mods is really easy, most mods have a how to in description, just read the description on nexus mods. Exceptions are using chat together with reshade and using sorting mods with icons. 
---
I'm on mobile right now, sorry for not going into depth. I'll be on PC in a few hours, DM me if you need further advice and I'll respond when I'm behind keyboard.
---
Make beds the FT/Login point for your camp, if that's where you logged off. Add the Option to "lock" beds so when you FT or Login you "wakeup" in your bed already well rested
---
Awesome sauce! I love these stories... It's what keeps me coming back.
---
After all this loud and proud expression of malicious joy here i dont think anybody who got unbanned will share their god rolls with anybody anymore, there will be no flood of b2525 fixers. 
---
And the guys who use hacked items for pvp are a very small proportion of losers. No pvper i know would ever use a hacked item in a competitive situation.
---
I've had 2 Unyielding so far...
---
I just wish I knew what this fast travel bug is.
---
I keep seeing complaints but every person who complains has yet to say a single thing about what it actually is or does.
---
This and let us build that jukebox in our camps.
---
Public server totally shits on private. Ive been a 1st member for about 6 months and I barely go into private unless I'm desperate for lead and mats (and need unpicked gyms.... Or set a dozen workshops up and AFK periodically to farm them all day).
---
Beat your phobias friend as you're missing the best parts of F76 in your peanut butter fortress...
---
1 believe there's a 100% chance of getting a prefix.
---
Happened twice now and I'm level 7. I've won it twice also so far. Just totally ruins game though when you get killed like that.
---
I can’t find the comment, but I remember reading that there are many layers to the fast travel bug and they’re still trying to solve it. Hopefully that fix comes sooner than later.
---
In which fallouts was this a feature?
---
I’m calling you a ding dong as the bugs and glitches have nothing to do with this discussion. The game runs fine for me and I didn’t come to this subreddit to respond to comments about the games stability. All I wanted to do is share my thoughts with people who enjoy the game as much as I do.
---
I'm glad to hear that. Thank you.  I do know that not everyone who did this recent dupe or got caught in this ban is the worst kind of person, but it sure did snare a lot of people who are. 
---
We play on pc and run many queens. We each have private servers and could play there if we wanted.  Thank you for your offer though.
---
Well, here's the rest of the pieces, but I'm keeping the screws. I'll give you a few bottle caps for them though...
---
Cheers man
---
On one of my 3 characters, it took 90 rolls to get the first unyielding, a month later I just need 1 more , but really bad rolls :)
---
But i just rolled my final 2* piece.. :-) it will do for now.. now just need the legs &amp; chest on my third character
---
Poor one out...
---
What are the odds of that?! Thanks abunch man it did! xD
---
Rigorously tested by Vault-Tec, I assume.
---
"Middle of September", was the official statement.
---
Yesterday i read a hotfix description about enemies being named legendary when in fact they were not. Could it be that?
---
This sounds great, but with my luck, I’ll end up crashing and losing all progress. Wish the game engine had better stability. It’s so poorly optimized.
---
You're trying too hard.
---
You know when you're on the map and want to fast travel to another location? What if, instead of going to a loading screen, it just closes the map and you haven't moved. Now do this ten times in a row, every time you want to fast travel. That's the fast travel bug.
---
Weird praise/troll post combined in one?
---
Where are you getting that number? I'm curious what number I was.
---
New players? The only people I see doing all these “no-nos” are people well past level 50 usually ranging in the 2-300s.
---
Fair enough I suppose. I’d still argue that the T-65, Hellfire and cosmos power armours are hard enough to obtain that they warrant a trophy like status.
---
It would be better making a dome with a square camp space, it would be more accurate
---
Yes, OP, Bethesda and everyone thinks bugs are a big issue in the game.
---
Without joke, what's a problem there? Image kinda blurry and shitty, and somehow i cant enlarge it enough, can someone explain the joke? Using reddit on a phone
---
Thx for that, good to know i dont even need to argue with you as you have proofed yourself as a ignorant dumb person 😂
---
This explains everything. When we complain about bugs they think we mean Stingwings.
---
Nuka cola jumpsuits from the Atom shop. Came in a bundle with the nuka cola secret door
---
Mate its not technically a sphere is 3d and if you were building really high having a camp with a big height it would be a cylinder. Its also on the ground and if it were to curve up it would be a semi circle lmao
---
Yes, one. Ring of Fire.
---
Nope, Bethesda have allowed these mods for years, no one has been banned they are cosmetic mods.
---
However many of the people who duped and hacked god roll weapons and Armor, made thousands of magazines and bobbleheads have been allowed to play again and keep some of that stuff.
---
LOL!
---
Have you tried the “H” key.  Automagically uses your stimpak stockpile.  Starts with diluted and moves up.
---
But that prevents people from instantly blapping it without the mutation.
---
I really didn't miss them and don't care they're back. They'll likely find some stupid new glitch and get banned again.
---
However, If they get my vending and displays shut off I say burn them at the stake.
---
Everything in the game is random chance...random encounters, legendary crafting, 95% hit chance...could be lucky first time, could retire without ever seeing your ideal result.
---
Yikes.
---
west tek. Found 4 legendaries yesterday
---
You are right they can't tune the enemies to meta play stiles. I was playing bloodied for a while, it got boring. So I nerfed my build. Went from 2 handed to unarmed, was also OP. So I just ditched the unyielding and bloodied gear. I don't think I can complain about the game's difficulty if I play a meta build.
---
Absolutely, more enemies that force us to play tactical would be way better than bullet sponges.
---
Anyway, I've had my moneys worth from this game, if Bethesda in their wisdom remove my account life will go one and they lose my future custom and purchases.
---
I miss the days when restaurants took 3 hours to serve four courses, but it's not a competitive business model anymore. Outer Worlds seems to have the play style you're describing, though.
---
No one can resist the pepperoni rolls.
---
I get it. I prefer trying Queens publicly as well. In theory it should be communal fun had by the whole server. Unfortunately there are selfish jerks out there too. I apologize if I sounded however I probably sounded. I never seem to type things the way I'm actually thinking them and it causes miscommunications quite often. I'm working on it, though.
---
I leveled from 1-100 in about 2 months and  everytime you report a hacker it makes a support ticket. I have over 4 pages of reports.
---
I was starting to think this was a shit post but I genuinely believe this guy is a little off his meds.
---
Like, it’s a video game that revolves around war and violence. Other players are 100% allowed to PvP without being judged.
---
They can't login into any account that against the CGU but, we know they already did some change for some account especially during the inventory steal hack (they create an new "rollback" characters for each character you have) so they have backup, but the point is to investigate account, check stuff and then rollback all/or characters with duped items, i'm pretty sure the hard part is checking stuff.
---
Do a west tek run, go to harpers ferry, burrows, to name a few spots.  Just got to know where to look.
---
FYI
---
This is the only official comment I can find regarding mods for Fallout 76.
---
&gt;**CAN I USE** ***MODS*** **OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY PROGRAMS WITH FALLOUT 76?**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Fallout 76 does not support the use of any *mods*, add-ons, or other third-party programs. Please be aware that the use of such applications may result in Fallout 76 not functioning properly.
---
[Can I use mods?](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/kw/mod)
---
Also, if you give your follower a torch, ir lasts forever. Although they may not always use it exactly when you want them to, they will typically use it where its dark.
---
Nice, people don't nuke there
---
Love this idea!
---
I'm on my first chest peice. About 20 modules in... I've had no unyielding yet! 
---
Not even a 1 star.
---
I'll probably upgrade from my 3 star unyielding leather chest if I get a 1 star for the increased DR and rad resistance but God, I'm going to hate this game if it takes a few 100 roles for great chest peice :(
---
That was a great read, Todd.
---
playing an hour a day and I'm three or four levels ahead of where I need to be right now. 
---
maybe you should take your own advice, tho
---
Hey, I appreciate your offer but I'm totally fine with the anti-armor atm. I'm supposed to be a bloodied stealth/rifle guy but just the damage boost from the surenal serum, nerd rage and the other things is more than enough to take down pretty much anything that is not a scorched beast/death claw/random big stuff in one hit.
---
Maybe I was there? Thats exactly what happend, I was a player that followed the emote guy.

Did you see a madman going up to the colossus and start taking photos during the fight?

If so....guilty.

You know what they say, third times the charm!

I feel I should probably have a cooling-off period now that I feel like hoarding any bottle-caps I see.

A thousand times this, give me a nice massive range of difficulties to challenge some of my overpowered characters.

I got the item while the quest was asking to talk to ward (so he would send me sonewhere). The item is removed on conpletion but when I relog it reappears in my inventory.
---
Honestly, I'm about 20 chest peices in and have yet to get even a 1 star unyielding. So a 2 star is better than nothing!

Ah.

Happened to my 3 times in a row last week.

Figured it out almost instantaneously and haven’t had a problem since.

All I had to do was “un-crouch” and I could travel no problem.

I’ve yet to crouch when traveling and have yet to experience this bug again.

Thanks for the reply too.

I'm wandering in the cranberries bodge and killing SB, they have a good chance to be legendary but yeah it's annoying to have this daily mostly everyday

Fuck sake man, either you need to grow a pair or you've got some serious social problems

Easy way would be to set them to weapon select this weapon, select heavy weapons you heavy weapons perks equip, select shotgun your perks those perks equip. And just have a camp farming mode too
---
Todd outfit
---
Clearly not a real friend
---
And he’s saying wether it’s in misc or junk, if you don’t have fallout first you’re storing it inside your stash anyway? So how does changing it from misc to junk effect you for storing it ? If you can’t afford fallout 1st then doesn’t the gun powder still sit in your box ? So it wouldn’t make a difference right ? Ok
---
tbh by now you should be halfway in levels, which is about a third of the points needed by the end of the season. The score required increases by 50 every level, so if you haven't been clearing the adventure challenges you may have trouble completing.

Long fights are boring and a waste of time for such a shitty set of rewards from the queen. No thanks I rather have her gone once she lands in 5 seconds and move on
---
I don't know if this was fixed yet since I don't own Fallout 1st anymore but I think you can't do the full sneak damage on the SBQ if you're in a public server that has people that aren't in stealth during the fight. 
---
And the only way you can get the full damage is in a private server either by yourself or having teammates run sneak builds.

If you can do an end game levelled boss battle in seconds, it's not really an end game boss battle at all, is it.

Bethesda could make the combat more interesting &amp; challenging but that's a separate issue entirely

no no. If you are lvl 10, you need to wait 40lvls to use the weapon you bought

I think bethesda ducked up the perk card system. Do you have power user perk active?
---
Both good ideas just throwing ideas out there it would really change the game for me I hate having to change them for certain things.
---
That's really cool. I thought this would be a post where someone says that the game pulled them through a rough period (which is also cool), but this is much more wholesome. I think this is also one of the most awesome things a developer likes to hear.
---
Have fun in West Virginia. I hear life is old there. Older than the trees anyway. But younger than the mountains.

---
I thought this was the best idea until I started a playlist on youtube and got reminded of the Scottish heritage and... bagpipes.
---
That's exactly the point. If it was a well designed end game battle, several stages, challenging, fun it would be worth the invested time. It proves how shitty Beth as an level and fights designs. At least colosal proble€_⁰pa is a bit funnier but that's because they nerfed heavy guns damage on that bugger.
---
Yes I have all plans to craft the jet packs. I just don’t get why all other ones are available but not the mOthman one
---
If how they dealt with dupers recently is anything to go by, I wouldn't hold your breath.
---
Tbh I like 1st person just feels better
---
I liked them to begin with. The rifle skin looks good and the NW looks great... the rest is just lazy and kinda insane. Also most haven't been tested at all and blocks your face or clips
---
nocturnal rolling pins
---
So you say "I didn't partake" and then admit half your shit is duped.

You and the rest of normal reality has a very different definition of "partake"

At least a ghoul. I don't know that I want to be fighting wendingos that often. Definitely should have "x amount to spawn y enemy" though.

I also prefer first person. Sometimes I use third for melee or looking at my outfit, heh.
---
Add mods to power armor arms that give it "unarmed" qualities that benefit from unarmed perks. Require it be on both arms, but uts still only a single handed attack
---
Contrary to the (probably) popular opinion, I believe pretty much anything with good 2nd and 3rd stars or complimentary 2nd and 3rd stars is useful to somebody, ie collectors. It more so just depends on how much crap you want to dedicate to carry/storage via mules. 
---
IF you dont use the trading sub or dont plan to, tier your vendor sales. Make goofy prefixes with aforementioned 2nd and 3rd stars around 5k and scale from there. If they dont sell drop the price for a few days and then after a few more scrip. 
---
When the weapon/armor is good it's good. The desire on the market just swings.

Classic comedy! XD

Tell me about it. I'm still waiting after two years for a drop of a casual shielded lining

I love the option too switch &amp; wish more games would incorporate it Into there games...

I play 3rd person most times,&amp; then go 1st person when I go into a building &amp; other similar situations.

Also,if ya press &amp; hold the button that switches em,&amp; pull back on the the toggle,you can in fact zoom out in 3rd,I play that way more often then any.

I agree with this as well. Good reply. 👍
---
When they go into first person camera, the armour clips in front of their vision, effectively blocking what they see. 
---
This is especially funny because it is camouflage armour, designed to make it hard for other people to see you, not harder for you to see everything.
---
So the practice is still alive and well today in America. We still use company towns to corral humans and force them into wage slavery.
---
Hell we haven't even changed the way it looks. And America has done it ever since the country started.
---
I mean we did have actual slaves. Then we had mining towns and railroad company towns. I'm sure I'm missing a few steps, but currently we have all sorts of migrant and seasonal labor that does everything in it's power to keep people like slaves.

I live in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts IRL and back when FO4 came out and I was playing A LOT I remember walking around the woods in real life in early December. It’s what we call “stick season” where there aren’t leaves on the trees but generally there’s no snow on the ground. The terrain, the colors, the feel looks soooo much like it does in the game. I remember coming across an old rotted abandoned car in the middle of the woods and I legit could have fooled myself that I was in the game. An unbidden thought cane to my head that I should go check it out for scrap.
---
Bah. Well fine, it was free goods while it lasted.
---
I'd prefer 3rd person if it wasnt over the shoulder, I like birds eye better
---
It looks like those 2 generation houses commies were building.
---
Eyyyy it just works
---
For a split second I read that as “bestiality” and got concerned for a moment.
---
One shotting uranium fever legendaries, fixers should use combat rifle skins, what score level should I be, PA sucks and we want PA displays. 
---
One of each of these topics must be posted once a day or this sub will fall into anarchy.
---
Yeah, but I'd say about twice a play session someone visits my vendor and triggers mobs to spawn near my camp, so ive gotten into being dramatic about clearing them out lol.
---
Right arm of the combat armor is visible in first person while running.
---
To all the “dUpErS aRe DeStRoYiNg ThE gAmE” whiners here, take note. Bethesda doesn’t care. Report away. Cheer gleefully as people get banned. Just know that in the end, none of it matters. Your salt and your rage just fuels them.
---
No it doesn't
---
Oh yeah leveling up wasn’t a problem. Just doing the same freaking dailies sucked...
---
I got one yesterday, I guess its for the lols
---
I switch between the two. Was using 3rd person in normal armor with shotguns but using power armor and heavy guns is well better in 1st person. The way you run in power armor looks so ridiculous like you're trying to get your knees as high as possible. Also, stealth in first person makes your gun invisible so you can't aim down sights, so you're forced to play in 3rd.
---
I would say so. I have two characters that are charisma 4 and Charisma 5. They both regularly slot inspirational 3 unless someone in the group is sharing it, and then I change. As for what I share since I can only share one point I will usually try and find something that is useful that people don't often slot but won't hinder anybody, so I will go with something like travel agent or tenderizer, but I have also under some circumstances gone with something like Aqua boy or Leadbelly. Just don't share anything that will interfere with people's radiation levels cuz then you'll screw up bloody build players
---
Every time I do IAT the scorchbeast aggros some random mob group off in the distance. Super annoying.
---
double bed, or sex swing - either would be fine
---
Nobody responds!
---
Agreed, all helmets with lights should be "repairable" or modable to have the light be functional. I'd much prefer a combat helmet than mining helmet. Though I did just find a black mining helmet so I'm happier now that I'm not using the bright blue one I had before.
---
Just like my wife.  No sex again tonight 🙄
---
This has not been items on display that were bought,  just items that were in the stash.  Maybe stashing just a minute or two before logging out is causing it not to register that the items were stored?
---
Close the app. That should clear you off of the team.
---
I'd your in a full group your chances of getting loot from her go way up.
---
It astounds me that end game builds can’t handle ads *at all*.
---
Funny enough I always played 4 in third person. This one I switch back and forth.
---
Yeah that's fair lol
---
Those are quite expansive for really not much reward... I wish there was more bang for your buck on how much time some of them take.
---
Same, that's why i would love to have a way to despawn the tent when i finish staching my stuff
---
Just don’t get romantic with them.
---
I switch around all the time. First-person is a million times better for collecting loot and interacting with stuff. Plus a lot of the interior corridors are too narrow for the third-person camera. But against large enemies, groups, or just in an open area, I like third-person combat as a melee build. I also prefer third-person for Nuclear Winter, just for the extra peripheral vision (plus some weapons' ironsights just aren't great).
---
Congratulations to you as well! Hacking was an earlier one, but still took a while to get. I feel like there is 2.1 million lockpicks available, but only 20 terminals lol
---
Looks like someone doesn't know how to use a nocturnal rolling pin properly
---
scrap all junk, bulk and sell what you don't use, and once you hit level 50 get rid of all non-legendary weapons and armor as they're a waste. the stash limit used to be 400, so the 800 limit is more than managable if you manage your inventory. also once you get a backpack and some mods/perks, it could be better to keep certain things on you instead of in your stash.
---
As a melee build you can do it before you reach lv 50, otherwise a 1 star bloodied pipe rifle should be enough to get the 1k damage needed!
---
anyone pc got good guns for sale.  i’d be up for one of the meh dupe overkill weapons 
---
add me Rogue.Aus
---
People are pretty sure it has to do with server side lag and hit registration. They may have made the queen fight *look* like its running smoother, but I dont think it really is.
---
That's not a yes. That sounds like, I didn't because I assumed I wouldn't get a repsonse.
---
Filing a bug ticket isn't about getting a response. After all, what are they going to do at that point? 
---
Filing a bug ticket gives them data on what bugs are affecting players the most. The more tickets a bug gets, the faster it gets fixed, along with other factors.
---
Get a friend, have them get whacked by a Super Mutant using a board, revive player over and over. That’s what I ended up doing lol
---
Third person around my base or interacting with players. Otherwise 1st, the accuracy is a little dodgy in 3rd.
---
Unless one doesn't run a bloodied build.
---
Go to social tab in main menu and leave your team. This happened to me yesterday on PC
---
I've sent them videos of various bugs, it usually gets locked or ignored!
---
Absolutely. I could certainly fit in and help get Fellout 67 back on track.
---
To be honest, isn’t this the real life experience of wearing a ghille suit? I’m sure wearing all that foliage would block your own vision..
---
:ducks:
---
I’ve had the bug without crouching. Someone else mentioned healing factor mutation, but I don’t have that, either...
---
I tried that 2 Times. I keep rejoining the team.

---
That's nuts. I guess maybe restarting the ps4 completely?
---
Yeah, and so cool of them to make half of the cosmetic rewards in the season pass these dumb ugly skins. 
---
It's so obvious they're trying to attract the call of duty etc crowd with these. Couldn't be less fallout appropriate if you tried.
---
This morning on Xbox I saw a level 240 which I’m level 265 had a explosive plasma gatling. That and late last night two nukes where dropped and I know there where some duped weapons there. I haven’t seen anyone selling them in their vendors on Xbox yet. But they’re back
---
As soon as you hit lv 60, bloodied is viable for any weapon type, but if you prefer junkies, anti armor or vampires is suitable if you have the correct damage perks equipped, you just end up wasting more ammo!
---
Hmm Im not sure, I haven't tested it but I think hip fire accuracy isn't shown it just scoped accuracy maybe?
---
Again. What kind of response do you want? First, they can't do anything about something like your fast travel didn't work this time, because by that time, surely you moved on. And it doesn't stop you from actually playing the game.
---
People giving a personal response takes time, and still won't do anything for you right there and then. And if they sent an auto reply, you'd clearly complain bout that.
---
And the reason it gets locked is because they take it, file the information with the people that work on bugs, and close the ticket. Because otherwise it stays open in their system. They close it to show that it's been processed.
---
It's not about ignoring you.
---
Of course! New to teams, forgot about that.
---
It worked! Thank you so much!
---
Very true
---
I like it because it reminds of what a loonie I am for playing this game everyday when  I hear my toon sigh is a real life accurate representation of how I feel
---
When it comes to asking for help with game breaking bugs, soft locks in story quests, and the score system not paying out for auto completed dailies and weeklies, them insisting that they can't/won't do anything to help us a little insulting!
---
Yep, i don’t get it. I’m a lvl 200 full health junkie build, my good friend is a lvl 300 bloodied build, and neither of us ever die. The tools exist to deal with ads. And the tools exist to get the queen on the ground. *by being in the open and having aggro* lol
---
pre ammo converter nobody ever bought any 10mm from me, ever, at 1c each. I think I set them to 0 once to see if that helped. Nope.
---
I see, thanks!!
---
We are getting a Chally outfit?
---
You obviously took an arrow to the head and lived in a different reality during your coma..
---
I'm guessing you're ranged? Third person melee feels about as fluid as [budget toy robots fighting](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB10hLyaMFY.1VjSZFnq6AFHXXaT.jpg?width=750&amp;height=475&amp;hash=1225). It doesn't help that "block" is just a useless flinch that pretty much never works.
---
Hey guys, should we look at this thing we made even a single time in-game before we push it live?
---
Nah, I'm sure it's fine, we've never created a broken asset before, put it straight in without even bothering to fire up the client.
---
I believe Sentinel applies during jumping; several people have told me so, but since it's so hard to pull out exact numbers, it's just a tell-tale...

#ALLGHILLIEDUP, FO76 STYLE
---
3rd on my melee toon, 1st on my shotgunner
---
Y'see though, that's the thing: I'm not running any of those builds, I'm barely running a build at all. I know I'm in the minority, but I don't think maximized builds should be necessary to have a chance of surviving. 62 diseased charred ferals slaughter me, and I hate running into assaultrons or deathclaws of any level. It's frustrating that there send to only be one or two viable ways to play that offer any survivability.
---
And things never go terribly wrong and you end up having to fight 2 Legendary SBs or some Sheepsquatch action? Things are sponges.  Hell, even using a 10mm vs a ton of Ghouls that are swarming you can eat up a lot of ammo.
---
Even better you cant even favorite the armor skins for NW. Were they would actually be useful. Brilliant!
---
But you need unyielding to power level since you get 15 INT which 2% xp per. Why do you think people suggest to join building teams for a bonus 4 INT?
---
Edit: to power level since I was doing this the legendary run just run through West Tek and Whitesprings and make sure to kill the Sentry bots since they are worth a 1000 exp a pop. Use lunchboxes too up to 3 max, along with a cranberry relish if you have the Herbivore mutation.
---
Water started falling out of it and now I'm all damp.
---
Alas you're not a jack of all trades super dweller like the main games, you need to focus your build into a particular weapon type and you'll start actually surviving content, even without super legendary items you'll see a big difference!
---
I still don't 🤔
---
Look for gamertag scsiwuzzy on xbone
---
I'll set you up with plans and gear
---
Nuking isn't so much of the problem, so long as you're prepared for the mainframe cores
---
But killing the queen is a group activity unless your higher level.
---
To nuke solo is say level 50+, if only to have maxed out gear and a good spread of perks and special
---
The email juicehead showed was probably fake
---
I used to wander into nuke zones with just the hazmat suit. Then I got the Chinese stealth suit lol.
---
I don't do power armour.
---
Every fallout before this one!
---
I've been here since beta these updates is why I have quit. Hear me out.. is this what you guys and girls is what yiu pictured when they said updates and content very few months. No survival servers still... for those PvP players
---
The dupe was patched before the ban wave began.
---
So, the Mire SB spawns at the *bottom of the cliff* that you’re one, and will often aggro the enemies nearby, usually 100m away.
---
I can and have soloed rad rumble. As soon as you start it, you go make ore runs. When you run through to the other tunnels, double check the turrets, repair if necessary and kill any ghouls you see. You should end up around 40 ore which will give you one stage on completion, then you just pick your favorite camping spot and kill everything until the end. 
---
I dont think its possible to fully stage the event solo, but it is possible to complete it.
---
Had the same one with a possum. He thanked me for killing it and i think gave me a reward. Lol
---
I’ve killed a scorchbeast and wondered why I wasn’t absorbing its soul

misc should only = quest items and keys. if its a craftable item it should only be in junk
---
They need to award ammo points instead, and let players choose the ammo they want.
---
I like clipping workbenches into that steel drawer that they fit so well in. I have put a sink into some different furniture, but I will try to merge the cooking stove with the electric stove next.
---
1st person 24/7 :), 3rd just to check my outfit sometimes.
---
I don't know if you pvp beside trading, but I have met literally dozens of people past half year, who didn't hesitate to pull out a NW laser or energy 50 cal... Even posted some videos with them, which got me temp banned. So yeah, there *are* absolutely people who use them.
---
Well if you are on a team with some bloodied folks and you're sharing sun kissed, you are likely to get the boot.
---
Also Deathclaws, I feel bad insta murdering them in this game, at least glowing ones can taklnk a couple of bullet ls before going down! And it's not right that Ghouls are out tanking deathclaws!

Both are not my credits, i got them via pm. the first one got a permaban, the second one got a final warning and unlock.
---
But you do realize that you need more SCORE every level, right? I think by now you should be around 1/2 of the way or so.
---
I'm. Ok with the 20 min, with the adds tbat spawn.  Makes it fun, us what else is there to do?  Still the best fight available.
---
25
---
I killed my self so many times doing shit like this my first survival play through lol
---
Ok, you go on being buttsore and insulted. Hope that works out for you. I'm sure your life must be a never ending delight of being pissed off. Way to make the most out of it.
---
Especially shoot the dam adds!
---
We know your sitting on the fence because your terrified of getting ganked by adds, but when you fail to deal with any of the horde she drops it just leaves the real damage dealers, the bloodied melee people twisting in the wind as they are now completely surround. 
---
Also the framerate tanks due to the sudden increase in character models on screen leading to more unnecessary deaths. 
---
Leading to a lot of people winding up with ridiculously long respawn timers especially if the game forces them into the nuke zone killing your biggest damage dealers over and over.
---
If your on the ground with the melee the horde is cut down quickly and no additional lag issues are created. Your chances of getting jumped drop dramatically when you stay in range of the melee one shotting as many mobs as they can.
---
When the melee has to suddenly stop dealing damage to deal with an unchecked horde, the time to completion  just skyrockets.
---
Also in the event of a poorly placed nuke, where the fight has to be entirely in the nuke zone, stay together. 
---
Dont run off chasing the queen, stay with the group and down all possible targets that could pull agro from her off the players. Like super mutants and robots.
---
She'll come to you once their cleared and the hordes will go down much more efficiently with the cross fire of a tight nit group. 
---
And like the OP said keep at least one cryo weapon on hand even if it sucks, you'll vastly speed things up by gluing her down long enough for the Melee to slaughter here while also greatly slowing down her attacks making it so people can better block her hits.
---
Ghillie, Ghillie!
---
Yo dawg,  
---
We heard you like ghillie, so we added some ghillie for your ghillie so you can ghillie while you ghillie.  
---
Surprised they haven't added ghillie underarmor, glasses and pipboy with a light that projects ghillie pattern yet..
---
Yep. Every day. As I said.
---
Precisely this. How do I know? I'm guilty of it myself lol. I try to do at least one run through 4 chambers but after that I'll perch up. I hate wearing the hazmat suit and then to re-apply all my armor pieces. (The haz suit should go over your armor pieces imo.) Some people in PA don't even bother to one chamber.
---
I just wished Bethesda would wipe their entire inventory...
---
It's not just me, hundreds of players aren't getting score due to a bug and the official line from Bethesda is effectively "sucks to be you, we won't help"!
---
Make your own team, it’s not hard
---
First person all the way for me.  I've tried many times to adjust to third person and just can't.
---
Some players need to be at a high position to  shoot the spawns
---
Be careful with sarcasm, the internet seems to not understand it.
---
My father and I visit all the time. We're from Northern Ohio and honestly you gotta visit Spruce Knob, genuinely a wonderful place and view, if you have a car that can make it! I fell in love with Charleston too. Make sure to have something at Sheetz for me.
---
thanks man lmao next one will be for a little bit
---
Dude, I was trying to have a legit conversation about bugs and tickets, and explaining WHY you don't get a response to something like filling a bug ticket about the fast travel bug. 
---
And your side is all about anger at Bethesda because you don't get a personal response. You're the one insulted that a computer program made by humans doesn't work right all the time. 
---
Please post a screen shot of them telling you Sucks to be you, we won't help? You can't. They know it's a problem, they have stated they are working on it, they are adding things to help players affected by it, with extra dailies and double XP/Score weekends.
---
Doesn't like like a We Won't Help, kind of response.
---
So maybe you just stop playing since you are soooo insulted and offended. 
---
Naw, that's never going to happen.
---
it actually kinda does
---
Ya and the spawns don’t spawn until she lands to spawn them. Hang out on the ground and just get back to the high position after she lands, it’s so easy and makes life so much easier for everyone involved.
---
If you have any agro it counts down I think
---
I am waiting for them to do a Fallout La Boca Vista Florida so I can retire from the game.
---
Heavy is better in 3rd. Weapon takes up too much screen real estate. Otherwise prefer 1st person.
---
I have all the mutations and I never had the problem. As soon as I went bloodied I’m consistently getting the problem.
---
Does the grass still look like a Christmas tree?
---
And since the auto complete bug is still happening, those extra dailies means nothing, and the double xp weekends were always stated to happen anyway so no it isn't a response!
---
It doesn't bother me, it's fairly quiet, but what does bother me is those new venders that are really loud and won't shut up.
---
Marine Helmet as well.
---
Line of sight is far overrated.
---
I've had this a number of times. A lot of times all the security grids and doors will also be missing (along with the terminal to initiate launch prep).  Respawning and/or reloading doesn't always fix it from my experience.  
---
I'm pretty sure this bug has been in game from start, fortunately it's rare.
---
Just hit up places with mid to high level scorched, they drop a decent amount of combat rifles.  Just my opinion but I would save those materials for things like handmade and lever crafting for mods as those rarely drop from enemies.
---
I *run* through west tek and white springs with a vampires/fss boxing glove and unyielding, blocking and smashing a path through the bodies. Bloody doesn’t restrict play, the player does.
---
Yes!! Thank you for answering it! I restarted the game and rejoined and even my friend said he didn’t see anything like laser grids!
---
where’s the question?
---
People are not bad. The people that solo it, or even kill it in a group, in about a minute are the people abusing an effect that Angry Turtle just calls “magic weapons”. Look that up on youtube and you’ll find out why she dies that quick. It’s not intended nor has anything to do with anyone’s skill
---
Go fight medium-to-high level scorched and you should find plenty, anything from a zealot upwards will often be armed with a combat rifle. Especially in the mire and the bog, you'll get loads of combat rifles killing scorched there.
---
GO PLAY SOMETHING ELSE.
---
First person ftw
---
this guy is infuriating. has obviously never worked in a customer facing role lol. you’re bang on the money
---
I asked why they added the the cool down timer.?/
---
I hope you did not claim any of the rewards you bought with boosting your score. You said yoursef, you just wanted to support them. :,D
---
I get this also - just on one character. This is the game rant I dislike the most and I hear it everyday. I;d prefer Grafton mayor to this.
---
Improved game stability should be assumed to also be desirable with such content. 
---
Really hope they have a range of poses to chose from and aren't just sitting there in the base pose u usually find them in.
---
Various action poses, various salutes, more regal or intimidating static poses, and or even open and closed variants would be welcomed. 
---
I especially want the creepy mannequins that can be dressed up. could potentially kill 2 birds with one stone by combining the 2 in some way.
---
Even just static poses would be better than nothing tho.
---
Was the skeleton model they datamined a score or stom shop item?
---
I could have sworn it was a score item but havnt seen it in the bored.am I just misremembering it existing?
---
I find encryptid and other endgame events more enjoyable since it is at least something different than just shoot everything that moves. Also fingers crossed that collosal problem will be more fun than sbq.
---
When crippling sbq will work again you will see her gone down in probably 10min and less unless group is week on dps.
---
What do you mean by "harsher"?
---
They need to be punished first. Reporting does not work and cheat detection is a bad joke.
---
I used first person exclusively in FO76 as a VATS commando build until I discovered the Gauss Minigun.  Never been out of third person since lol.
---
look up “magic weapons angry turtle” on youtube. That’s how people kill her so ridiculously fast most of the time. Granted yes, with the right buffs and build some people can do insane damage to her. But your average server doesn’t have mad lads like that in most queen fights. But i bet the average player has encountered a queen being killed in a minute or so. And that’s bc of magic weapons, not bc other people are “bad”
---
What’s the rush though
---
Considering they decided you can't adjust the colour of the pipboy light on consoles, headwear with lights definitely needs attention.
---
Personally, I'm holding out hope for Eugenie's [Blue Ridge Ukshanka with torch](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcS6qvFv_atBSmBO06U33xkzUJfnCs-EATzdRg&amp;usqp=CAU) to be added.
---
There's a classical station? Had the game for well over a year and never noticed...
---
Ah that make sense. Seems to happen when there in same building as me. But it just cancels itself.
---
As a kid in the mid 50s that song, by "Pea Picking" Tennessee Ernie Ford, was popular in Eastern PA. We actually moved from Southeastern PA to the PA coal region in the late 50s. Many of the kids I met and went to school with had fathers and grandfathers lost to Black Lung Disease. Many of the mines had already shut down. The "company towns" were still there but had evolved to individual ownership or just sat empty and moldering.
---
The economy was depressed and so were most of the people. Occasionally, some of the old guys would talk about the Molly McGuires and the violence between the workers and owners during the 30s. The whole region was depressed and depressing. If you travel to that area today, you will hear the same comments from current residents about the lack of jobs and economic opportunities as I heard back in the 50s.
---
While I have only visited the parts of WVA close to MD recently it seems that a lot of the state is similar to what I experienced back then.
---
You can do it in 3 min without magic weapons. At least could when you could cripple her, now times are all over the place.

There's a pic of the butt flap man
---
Since only a very very small percentage is using perm IP, IP-banning is always a bad idea.
---
ahh you didn’t add a ?
---
so it wasn’t a question
---
i prefer encryptid, but that’s just bc i’ve perfected the way i run it and love taking all the pylons and not dying. Feels like role playing as the hulk or something lol. Also WAY less ammo usage is nice too
---
Me, irl, grabbing every bobby pin I see.
---
I use them to slow her down.
---
While it’s counting down you can even move around a little, shoot, loot, etc. I think it only cancels if you get hurt.
---
Yep, I discovered awhile and have kept it a secret. Exterminator armor prevents all game crashing, fast travel bugs, autoconpleted challenges and inventory browsing is like you're fresh out of the vault.
---
Got it sorted now. Took about 14 attempts
---
Ah a spin on the Drax method. I like it.
---
I like first person when in combat and interacting with objects, crafting, talking to npc, etc. However when ever i run, sprint, or rumage around i always use 3rd person weird I guess.
---
Yeah am aware of those. Didn't realise it worked so well on the queen also. I haven't actually fought the queen with my junkies guns in like forever as moved on to bloodied builds. Maybe I should pull out the junkie 25 25 gauss minigun I have and try that (although explosions so not sure!)
---
With a crossbow and vats it shoots fast enough to keep her under slow before it breaks.
---
How is it cheating?    
---
I don't like pvp for many reasons. This person likely has really good skills in sniping people in games. I did it when it came out to get a feel for it, stopped, and again for the Score. Otherwise, I avoid it.
---
They have kept some staff for session 2
---
I'm clearing 25,000 exp per 7 minutes.
---
Send me a DM if you want to know how.
---
I've heard that the town schools' curriculum was poor, very poor as to keep the populace uneducated. So that it was harder for them to leave, to get better jobs. And that a lot of people never left those towns?
---
It was a practice perfected here in America right after slavery called indentured servitude, they dressed it up a bit and tossed in Monopoly money to keep it going.
---
Good2know, thanks mate
---
Are you serious right now?
---
I have yet to find anyone who'll help power level a character.    
---
I've asked a few times and nothing. Every person who plays, like myself, doesn't have tons of free time.    
---
In fact, my first char I had to delete b/c it was so messed up and would take months to fix by myself. My 2nd char is now 87 while my first never got past 76. Grouping has helped with this new Legendary thing. People also have alt characters and going through the SAME quests again is BORING. If you find someone, good luck.
---
Wow. Just...just wow.
---
Seriously...
---
Crippling anxiety has become a meme... But do consider taking to a professional
---
Once, I one shotted a guy from miles away, with a crappy hunting rifle, during my bush wookie session. I am bad in NW. It was a lucky shot, nothing fancy.
---
That's fair, yeah. It's a dick move, don't get me wrong.
---
Yes please.
---
I had an idea once: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gzlqbj/horde\_beacon\_request/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gzlqbj/horde_beacon_request/)
---
No.    
---
My best character is a Stealth Sniper and 3rd person throws everything off. I can easily kill things from a distance without them knowing I'm there 95% of the time.
---
cringe
---
It was there all the time!!
---
I do it IRL!
---
You can tell the number by looking at the second part of the ticket id. The first part of ticket id is YYMMDD. 
---
My ticket were like 200714-014XXX, so there's at least 14k++ tickets that day alone (including the non ban tickets which we dont know)
---
One of the most important things to know is that faction daily quests give treasury notes, scrip and faction reputation.  You are limited to 150 scrip a day from shredding legendaries, but you can still earn scrip from daily quests.
---
Daily Quests - scrip
---
Public Events - treasury notes
---
Faction Quests - scrip and treasury notes
---
I mean, technically, you still can't. At least back then the game was honest about it.
---
So I did find it and did reproduce it... Awesome, thanks agin.
---
Looks fine to me dont know what your on about - Blind guy who tested the skin
---
That’s me, too!
---
I was damn near level 100 before I figured out you could do it at any time. Some reason I thought it would only let you do it for events just to save time. Then one day out of nowhere I thought to try it without traveling to an event and I felt like an idiot lol.
---
Ah sorry, I type quickly didn't see that my mistake.
---
I've lived in WV for 25 years now (Parkersburg), it's really a great place to be for many reasons.
---
Best reason:  The cost of living is so low here.  If you have a good job, you'll have plenty of caps to build up your RL CAMP haha.
---
It's a shame the ghillie backpack has a shovel on it, because that clips through the jetpack. Is there a ghillie secret service backpack?
---
Agreed! Been in East TN for close to 30 yrs and while bluegrass isn't my music of choice, I expected exactly that from FO76.
---
Np!!
---
Agree. As a Non-US citizen I got to know John Denver when I searched for the song after the forst FO76 trailer... Today I'm a big fan and listen to his entire discography! PS. His live shows in the very beginning of his career are the best, specially for the conversation between the songs.
---
Yes, they do have the calibrated shock modification.
---
What is this bug exactly? I don't recall it happening to me and i've been playing for almost a month. ( new player lvl 47 currently )
---
It’s most likely caused by performing an action prior to Fast Traveling.
---
Like crouching and than going to FF or right after sprinting.
---
The game might think you’re still performing that action so it cancels the FF.
---
Just in case you don't know any better, NW has cheaters on PC.  Spare us your opinion that it's just someone with skill please.
---
Easy solution could be just giving the Matt a wider sphere where trap items cant be placed next to them.
---
Ensure they are out if the range of trap items like pungi boards, mines, and flame throwers, trip wires, etc
---
Could also make them function as a flat surface to stand on so you dont fall through the ground or some such.
---
I know for sure its something I desperately need for my camp I have this elaborate silent hill experience where you think ur going into this normal house but past a certain door it becomes a freaky nightmare zone (one not intending to kill anyone)
---
But because of the locations facing direction people spawn into the middle of my camp or the back leaving them utterly confused as to what's going on and ruining the surprise. 
---
I looked every where for a suitable replacement but haven't been able to find one,  especially because the location doubles as a random assault spawn point. 
---
Is a great source of legendaries,  rep, and cryptids for challenges and such. They commonly respawn upon fast traveling back in from a location where I did any fighting. 
---
Would be so perfect to have them spawn at the front door.
---
Depending on the effects a 1 star can be as good as a 3 star.    
---
Last night I got a Troubleshooter's KNIFE. WTH?    
---
Certain effects should NOT be on melee weapons and vice versa. I have a Lv. 20 metal armor arm piece 3 Star and until I find one that duplicates it but a higher level, I'm keeping it.    
---
[https://imgur.com/5dJEbQs](https://imgur.com/5dJEbQs)    
---
It also depends on if you plan on selling it for caps or script. This char doesn't use heavy weapons. Most people want to become Fallout gazillionaires but I LOVE to make things super cheap. I'm set up near the Wayward so new players/char's have been coming to my CAMP and getting a lot of stuff for less than 50 caps that would net 4-5 digits somewhere else.    
---
Most people get their rocks off doing insane damage so they go for 'Bloodied' or something that requires low health. I'm not wasting my Stimpacks on someone that can be taken out fairly quickly b/c they have a fixation on that type of build. Another reason why rocking it solo is best.
---
He probably killed a chicken in Skyrim.
---
Right?!? He literally wants them to kiss his ass and thank him for reporting a bug.
---
Yes and no. People will bitch about anything so it kinda moot anyways. But at lest with something like this you have a choice. Use your hands and get a really low amount of resource or carry a random item for X number of minutes. I think this would be far superior than to using a perk. Way less screens and menus to open.
---
no
---
Not being funny. This is the gauss shotgun. And you will like it.
---
One shot a level 91 deathclaw. Take 3 shots to kill a level 32 ant. miss a 95% chance in front of me but kill a 0% chance behind a tree 200 metres away.
---
You get used to not killing yourself after a while. I also died several dozen times in the first few days of using it. Now it's only now and then. Mostly when idiots run in front of you at scorched earth or something like radiation rumble when there's loads of enemies getting all up in your face.
---
I assume you have marsupial. Just jump a lot before shooting.
---
Also. Use gun fu. 1 is enough to make it so much better
---
You still have i 
---
can give 20k Caps för it
---
"Alright Yogi, time to die!"

RAWR - stun - RAWR - stun - RAWR - stun - RAWR - stun - RAWR - stun.....

"Now where the heck is my corpse....?"
---
Where I have my camp set up, occasionally catches a bear spawn, odd time a legendary one - and it spawns right into parts of my camp...trying to clear them out is murder they always seem to be the worst to fight. 
---
Bears and Colonel Gutsy with the autocannon of doom.
---
I took on a lvl 80 or 90 sheepsquatch on my own last night and managed it without a stimpack but lost a good chunk of health. Against a bear or c.gutsy they kick my ass.
---
All MMOs even this 'limited' one are made to be as much of a time sink as possible.    
---
Time is something you can NOT get back and this game is yet another that proves it. In the previous Fallout games you can simply pause or stop whenever you wish. The game as it was when you left is the same as when you come back to it.    
---
The longer a came company can keep you playing the more profit (eventually) they will make. If done right it can help their rep and attract a lot of future customers.
---
I cannot stand third person shoulder cam in this game. I am always in first person.
---
Why? What is it about 3d person in F76 that changed your mind?
---
On a previous character I managed to get a full vanguards and unyielding set in about 10 days so that’s 30-40 modules
---
On another character 27 modules and neither 28th unyielding 30th vanguards 
---
It’s pure RNG
---
I get the speech from rose about her being straight with me.
---
They cant MAKE us drink!
---
Normally in the game, the mods are not meant to stack but I think there is a bug going around right now that lets you.
---
what else would SS mean lol this guy just wants a nazi jetpack for some reason
---
Thanks, marsupial and a SS jet pack so I can go all A10 on them
---
You can now, just need to wait 10 seconds.
---
Yeah, you lost all respect from me when i seen that floating base.
---
i run a bloody build, either sniper build, or bloodied fixer sometimes a bloody handmade. i always perch on a tent away from the cluttered areas. and she often lands right in front of my tent and one-shots me.  then once her argo changes and i respawn i go back to my tent and fight to get her argo back doesn't take long and guess what she lands right in front of me . if i stay on the ground her spawning in minions are often go ignored. me being on a perch i get to bypass the ticks, the melle one shot mobs. your theories while sometimes well thought out are often video game wives tales. she has a random argo system and it resets whenever she takes off or the target dies, or gets out of her argo range.  i usally only see issues with her when in gatherings of people who have the common gear and are simply running normal weapons and do not put out enough damage to keep her attention. thus she simply does her own thing. in groups who carry a cryo gun and know how to fling lead down range. its hardly ever an issue.
---
For anyone reading this post from OP also keep in mind that this is a video game and the goal is to play to enjoy the game, not play to cater to someone else's preffered method of playing. 
---
At the end of the day what you do in this game doesn't matter, because its a *video game*.
---
I’ve fished it a bit, but never been swimming in it.  When I set my name I lived in MN all my life, I’ve since moved.
---
explosions supposedly drop the fire rate required for “magic” by about half, but the only guns i’ve ever been able to get it to work with the queen are a junkie FFR LMG and a junkie FFR minigun. Can’t get it with any of my explosive guns (gauss is explosive by default)
---
I just now got this bug. The quick switch is indeed treating the hunting rifle as though it has no available ammo. The bug seems to trigger after converting the hunting rifle from .308 to .50 and reverting back to .308 fixes it immediately. My guess is the game doesn’t recognise .50 as a valid ammo type for the hunting rifle even when a .50 receiver is equipped. How to fix in the long term for use of .50 hunting rifle? Kick Bethesda ass until it’s fixed!
---
Just shoot it at the ground next to enemies..
---
Wood is SO easy to find.    
---
There's that lumber yard in the Forest which can easily net 50 per run unless you have that perk which doubles it. Steel is also easy to get.    
---
Adhesive has become increasingly easier to find.    
---
Gears, screws, and springs not so much but take more time. Always look out for those small boxes which are labeled. No one has ever given me stuff. I put in the time and scavanged while I played. I lost some but got more. Have patience. You might get lucky and find someone who's selling for a reasonable price.    
---
Being 'poor' is no excuse. I've been solo 99.99% of my gameplay. This game should also be teaching EVERYONE inventory management and that hoarding everything is bad. You can easily find all but three of these. There is a 'Tag of Search' in the crafting and repair menus in any crafting station.
---
Good to hear not all the assholes got away with it. Sucks to suck
---
Wastelanders is NOT the main story.
---
I've heard of it being inconsistant, but is'nt distance a thing with all shotguns? Close enough they can do massive damage but IF you step out of the effective range the damage goes significally down right away. I have never owned a gauss shotgun so dont know IF you are talking about something different. But IF this is The way it works it is just the way shotguns work. A good way to survive is to get a magic shotgun and use vats all The time and at The same time running and jumping around like a madman. Works wonders for me
---
Now that I think about it I don’t know I’ve ever seen a nuke there since day one.
---
I have a double bed, atomic shop purchase from long ago. 
---
Of course there is also a couple double bed plans iirc,  one with a blue blanket and one with just the mattress and frame
---
Has the jetpack on any PA piece bug come back?
---
Why the hell can no one, except for the OP actually understand that being forced to store really heavy shit in your stash box, because if you don't you'll lose it when you die limits the amount of other stuff you can put inside?
---
Stash boxes have an 800lb limit. They're not affected by perk weight reduction cards.
---
If all that changes is the tag from misc to junk, it's still gonna weigh .05 lbs.
---
Would you rather store 360 gunpowder or a nice minigun?
---
Oh, sweet, I hope we get more eventually
---
If it doesn't bugg out and the timer closes immediately. Which seems to happen to me more times than not.
---
I didn't say I couldn't store my excess gunpowder.
---
Distance on GS is wonky. You can barely damage a feral right in front of you but snipe a glowing one 60m away.
---
third person is best use for the gauss shotgun. for whatever reason, it fires faster.
---
I'm always serious.
---
I can get that is frustrating. I haven’t had that issue in a long time personally.
---
Yea gotta admit the skins look horrible imo, I quite like the outfit from NW but I haven't really used it
---
I play since release in 3rd person. I was always a Melee build and tbh the view radius  around me saved my ass more then a single time. I see more of the environment and everything around me. I only have to switch sometimes into 1st person because taking small items from the ground can be a pain lol. But you can zoom out in 3rd person. At ps4 just hold the button which you use to get into the building menu ( the touchscreen pad) and just zoom out with the right stick. Not sure on other consols/PC
---
OH, really? Thats something new then
---
I assume you've closed the game and reopened.
---
Fatal mistake
---
yeah somebody else showed a different ghillie skin a week ago and the skin parts would just actually float in front of you when running instead of sticking to the armor.
---
Lmao it takes two seconds even at like level 5
---
if you're talking about the one that lets you put the jet pack mod on limbs, then no. just lets you stack mods meant for the actually power armor piece, for example you can stack emergency protocols on the chest with the jet pack. not sure how it works, only heard about it
---
This. XP buffs using food, sleep, and team perks + insanely high intelligence is the name of the game for leveling fast. Hard to pull this off without Unyielding Armor, don't give that away so fast. That being said, happy to take it off your hands :) .
---
Maybe they intended for there to be something else but didn't get it finished in time so they threw the unfinished buggy ghillies in....which doesn't make too much sense but on the other hand it's Bethesda. Maybe the intended rewards didn't even have texture yet.
---
They do seem less frequent for sure =/ I've still been seeing them tho
---
Have you tried Monster Mash? There are usually three rounds and I’ve had times where there were at least 7+ legendaries popping up throughout the event. I’ve gotten pretty fast at grabbing the candy baskets though. But leader of the pack is my #1 go to.
---
A second dupe method was found and patched later. I saw a post on Bethesda forums about it in French or some other language
---
Oh thats pretty cool
---
Always annoyed me that you have to choose between a jetpack which has no combat function and something like protocols
---
Try to close the game and reopen, if that doesn’t work, open a workbench or something of the sort and it may show you that you can craft something (like ammo or a board) and you will see that you actually still have materials they aren’t showing up (hopefully) after you craft one item then they should reappear. That’s what happened for my cousin anyways
---
Lol. Every time someone mentions loadouts I remember that they are "coming in early 2020" as well.
---
I mainly play in 3rd person and if I'm in combat I will switch to 1st person if needed.
---
Did you buy the moth man jet pack from the atom store?
---
I think it would be cool if it was another boss fight area that opens up after a nuke and then you can activate a robot to play the organ to fight waves of megasloths and the Uber megasloth boss
---
Yesssss even if it has to be away from any other object it'd stop everyone spawning into the floor or wherever else!
---
Lets keep the downvotes rolling crybabies 💪🏻
---
I’ve tried it but she just doesn’t want to land, I’ll switch to a gun and take some shots off on her to try to get her to target me so she can land but the minute she does target me she’ll fly away off into the distance. When she comes back she goes back to targeting the people on top of things so I can’t get to her and if she does get on the ground it’s usually for about maybe ten seconds before she’s off in the air again.
---
on the ground, up in the air, talking to her friend, put a round in her if you stand there and simply wait for her to land. then 80% of the time you could be damaging her your waiting. she may only land 2-3 times. and if you cant fling enough damage downrange in those three 5-30 sec landing you wasted your time.  but you ahead and stand there for 20 minutes with your fingers up your rears. ive seen people kill her in 5 sec. hope she stayed alive long enough for you to get 1k in for loot waiting on her to land. get on the damage table and then just wait for her to land. and let the mellee player beat her up. but dont wait till she lands to get your 1k in.
---
I've always enjoyed the freedom to swap between both views. Generally outside I'm 3rd n inside go to 1st. One thing that really bugged me about the outer worlds was its lack of 3rd person view
---
There are actually multiple Fast Travel bugs that Bethesda are working on resolving, if it were a simple fix then they would have been resolved by now. No need to insult the developers.
---
Well, it just works i suppose 😁, thx for explanation
---
Awesome!!
---
I'm a bit lost. What's this about?
---
Faction related skins for all armours would be nice. Responders, Raiders , BoS l. With a slight alteration to mesh like most raider pa skins have
---
I really only want the skins so I can put ghillie pain on my helmets. Otherwise there's no point, as the NW one covers up the armor
---
Yes I bought mOthman bundle for that reason. Idk I’ll mess with it again tonight when I get off work and see what’s going on
---
Gauss Minigun hands down is the best. Ammo is not hard to make at all. It’s just in small quantities. The best thing to do is prime it and get the triple barrel. You can make about 3-5 times(forget the exact amount but it’s def more than 27 rounds) the regular ammo on one craft making ultracite 2mm then you can regular 2mm rounds. The gun shreds and looks badass when you fire it. 2nd place for me is a prime Gatling plasma for the queen and my mob killer is a junkies ffr fr Gatling gun. I just love shooting the Gauss minigun so I tend to use it all the time. I have 20k steel and 2k lead so basic rounds are easy to make. For ultracite I have 12k rounds stored now and all you need is stable crimson flux to make them. Pick plants at the queen and I use a nuke at WS to get high rad fluids, hard mass and glowing mass. A private server makes it easier if you have the option so some high level cloaked sweaty with a fixer doesn’t roll through and kill everything before you can get there.
---
Another plus the Gauss Minigun has the explosive effect by default. It scales with demo expert too.
---
I'm not sure if that's still or even at all a bug with the SBQ as I've by now repeatedly seen her 'land' in the air to charge at the birds sitting on the fence at dropsite V9 but also seen her land in the tree at Forward station Delta to attack people on the walls.
---
Now put a powered vending machine at the top with nothing in it, and an unpowered one loaded with stuff between two walls out of sight.
---
This way it'll show up on the map as a vendor and list what you have for sale, and they'll only ever see and find the empty one at the top.
---
I imagine it went like this:
---
Beth: if you do this, you'll get a ghillie suit.
---
(players do it, to get a ghillie suit)
---
Beth: Wow, that was popular. Let's do it 10 more times.
---
I just trying to get rid of my 200+ positive comments and getting my rating into - a few k asap 💪🏻 all help with downvoting my comments are appreciated
---
It was a thing at one point but of course a small group of players took advantage and ruined it for everyone else
---
Is this a cry for attention?
---
That’s funny. We were poking fun at the same thing
---
I don't like the design at all, looks like cheap Christmas decorations glued on to me ha ha
---
I lost my 3 stars Tesla rifle two weeks ago, I thought I sold it by mistake. If you can get your item back,  I will certainly open a ticket too.
---
Well. That certainly is a proper bummer. 
---
Next time you move camp btw everything automatically gets stored.
---
This would be amazing best idea I've seen on here for ages
---
It does lol. They could've done a lot better.
---
Umm... ok I suppose I'll help out with that
---
Post-COVID, I would strongly encourage anyone who hasn't been to go to the real life Beckley in WV. I actually took a road trip around WV to see the sights and see if I could recognize any of the features in-game. While in Beckley, they actually have a coal mine tour which is really incredible, and every time I go in a mine now in Fallout 76, I actually feel the weight of being in a real-life coal mine. I really wish Bethesda made the lighting much darker in these mines cause it's actually very scary down there if your lights go out which could make for some fun game elements.
---
The light does work on ss you just cant change it? I use combat helm and I'm so upset the light doesn't function
---
you have to do 1,000 damage to her to get on the loot table.
---
Maybe I worded that poorly, I try to directly nuke the bunker so there’s a nice clear field to fight, I find that most people go to the bunker anyway and that would be fine if people would stand huddled in front of the bunker(I was part of a group where everyone stood in front of the fence not shooting the queen then she would land and we would kill her in 5 seconds) but most runs a few people would stand there while 6 other people would run around in every direction drawing the queen all over the place and everyone else would stand of fences and tents
---
Well, that's something worth staring at.
---
I would like that as well, maybe the passage is blocked until a nuke comes down, giving the cave ultracite veins and etc. have the megasloth be a special variant than what we can regularly find
---
Okay Todd
---
Don't discount playing a support role.  There are so many critters around that you can get some serious experience, as well as helping those players focused on the queen.  I'm often getting attacked up close and have to refocus on those.
---
more loot from the mobs then the event rewards the player. so tehy farm the event instead of completing it correctly.
---
I had a possum pass by me last night and then a settler out of nowhere giving chase yelling "you are gonna taste so good!"
---
Thank you.
---
I'm not sure why they removed them but several of the removed  vehicles were military jeeps. I guess they thought there weren't enough military in the bunker when the nukes dropped to warrant them.
---
Thats the exact quest that made me post this.
---
Hot coffee mod for fo76 pls (not many remember that shit 😁)
---
Temperature is something that isn’t really considered by the devs or the fo community. Like in fallout 4, you are in Boston so it’s already gonna be incredibly cold come winter but the dlc also takes place in Maine which is already chilly most of the time aside from the tons of snow in the winter
---
When they do 110 every .25 seconds like the Tesla rifle then pretty much yeah
---
because you can get xp from crafting camp items.
---
Being able to delete it all in one go would make it very easy to grind xp that way.
---
The settler and Raider one can be selected from the atom shop menu. You just select the one you prefer and a little checkmark shows up on the picture.
---
I will say though, if you managed to get the Nuclear Winter ghillie skin reward when it was available, it's fantastic for bush hiding.
---
New Event: Stealing deathclaw eggs
---
New Event: Burn the nest( see aliens and xenomorphs style)
---
Both new events should be very hard and scalling with numbers of players. You should be able to blast with guns or make stealth approach ( at least to certain objective-checkpoint).
---
Deathclaw matriarch should be a big boss there.
---
This event should take place in separate cell where players would have to work together. Sth like radiation rumble. A lot of carved out tunnels some very claustrophobic. And some underwater alternative path section. Imagine swimming and you appear in the pond in the middle of their nest.
---
Or imagine trying to sneak past their "victim bone graveyard"
---
Personally I'm not a fond of killing these magnificent bastard's because I like them (talking deathclaw when?).
---
But for gameplay purposes it would be fun.
---
Some unique rewards would be nice like a very smol deathclaw pet wandering around your camp? Perhaps along the pet system.
---
If you just move your camp to the same place, it should store everything. Then from the build mode, you should be able to scrap everything (can't remember if you can do it all at once, haven't moved my camp in months).
---
And you were wrong, you made it sound like everything worked perfectly while on a team solo. Look at my results from over 2 hours of testing. There are stipulations on how this works.

FO 76 Junk Run
---
1. Whitespring Bunker
---
2. National Isolated Radio Array
---
3. Sugar Grove 
---
I haven’t played in a couple months but this junk run bets me 50-80 screws every time and everything else comes super easy because of all the materials you can pick up, fo1st helps with your traveling camp and storage for the junk, cheers!
---
Lucky Hole Mine southwest of Fort Defiance you should be able to walk out with 300 ish lead ore w/ an excavator suit should land you around 1k lead after smelting w/ super duper
---
LoL, reloads!   Yep, that took me a while as well.  My first bloodied weapon was a 1 star Handmade.  Gradually I learned to step around a corner and reload after killing three or four enemies, regardless of how many rounds were left in the mag.   It sucks to run out in the middle of a shoot out.  This eventually became muscle memory.  
---
Later, I started a power armor heavy weapons build.  Heavies have a large magazine and don’t need to reload often.  It took me WEEKS to stop reloading after only three kills, LoL!!!   It was actually frustrating.  That muscle memory was killing me.
---
Lucky hole mine
---
Tag line for the game right there (I say that having played way too many hours of it heh)
---
This latest issue includes items that can't be seen in the stored menu when the camp has been moved. 
---
They disappear and remain invisible forever, and can't be deleted from the storage menu. You're budget is effectively held hostage with no way to reclaim it
---
It’s for the Call of duty shooty shooty people.
---
Lmao I imagine plenty of us have
---
I know that leather ghillie legs will stretch and shrink as you run to keep the contacts firmly in place.  Strange to watch.
---
I legit thought this was sarcasm lol
---
What kind of things should I be looking for?
---
Camp Acid max is definitely 10
---
NW gillie suit trumps all others. the rest look like plastic wrap painted green and taped to armor. there total ass
---
I don't have it anymore, unfortunately.
---
Skins in CoD MW are much, much better; though still not worth price of battlepass imho.
---
Skins in F76 appeal to the general F76 junk and cosmetics hoarding population, nothing CoD-ish about that.
---
Yes.
---
Or what about having an aid item package you can craft, like bulk junk, that when used gives the user a set listing of aid items, with a variety of different packages being craftable. Have one that's a basic aid pack, with boiled or purified water, diluted stimpacks, and a disease cure. Then have an advanced aid pack with purified water, more diluted stimpacks, antibiotics, and diluted rad away. And then have another level of aid pack that's stimpacks, radaway, rax-x, antibiotics, and some chems. It may not include ammo with it, but it'd still be easier than digging through all the aid items to drop ones you want to drop.
---
This is just Atrocious!  Unbelievable!
---
Do we have a bloody melee complainer again? Is he the same guy complaining about just grinding xp in radiation rumble?
---
Everything, every piece you pickup will give you stuff, it won’t just help you now but in the future as well, typewriters, giddy ups, new toy vehicles, desk fans, those all net screws, maybe even clipboards don’t exactly remember but it’s a beast of a run
---
Just another thing to prove they don’t test or play their own game.
---
Are the items back from your inventory or missing entirely?
---
Not sure why you're getting so many downvotes.. that's a pretty sweet build.
---
Hell ya
---
I found a blood eagle in a porta potty once.
---
Just a question, why does solar armor suck so much? Also, +1E is worthless since it’s glitched right now and gives no bonus
---
its called stealth. enemies cant see you if you cant see them.
---
Melody Larkin has the voice of a 55 year old lesbian butch from Alabama. I hate that Charleston message.
---
lol. So we are ok with someone in a swimsuit that hides full marine gear, but the actual consequences of putting a net on your head is unfair? 🤔
---
Seerious question: is the view obstructed while aiming? If so, thats legit awful. If not, seems realistic  enough.
---
Is this wonderful feature seen with other big guns, or just the 50 cal?
---
For some reason mine would only release smoke but won’t explode ever, my friend’s would smoke then boom after a few seconds. Weird.
---
This is pretty much the problem. I went with a buddy during the double xp weekend. I was 2 levels higher than him before the event. I collected ore and he just killed stuff.
---
Not only did we end the event with him 1 level higher than me, but he also walked away with two 3-star legendaries I was too far away on the kill to be able to loot.
---
It's just not nearly as rewarding to be the ore runner.
---
It'll work, any UNY piece you can craft toward your full set is decent. It's not as if you can't ever craft another piece again.
---
It...just...works.
---
Plus there’s the technical issue where the game likes to load your character in before your C.A.M.P. This could cause issues where people could be stuck in things like foundations.
---
Is anyone else fast traveling and going to a completely different location than they selected?  Cause that has happened to me several times lately.   No Nukashine involved!
---
Ive have never seen a gauss minigun or plasma caster are they really rare? I am lvl 120
---
[People.  What a bunch of bastards.](https://media3.giphy.com/media/yidUznwbfpbq85663e/giphy-downsized-medium.gif)
---
Where’d you find it, or was someone selling
---
You can pretty much do that already by deleting foundations and storing all of the decorations on them. With how little xp that building gives (compared to other grinds) and the fact that you could delete most things quickly manually makes the potential xp gains a non issue. Even more so considering that materials still need to be gathered in the hundreds for any meaningful xp gains.
---
yep i usally avoid that event unless im running with 3 people. ill ore run while they kill then we split the take.
---
Damn, I knew I should have looked it up to make sure.
---
As someone who got unbanned imo they shouldn’t have banned 75% of people. Should have been account wipe. Since I’ve played other games for 2 weeks I came back last night I have now realized how fucking bad this game is and I no longer have the yearning to play it anymore. This is coming from someone with 2k hours and dumped a couple hundred into the atom store. They fucked up when they made me take my blinders off.
---
I usually run in first person, but when I'm on my PA Heavy weapon character, I typically run in third person because the arms and gun block like half the screen. Its fun running in third, but with speed demon and marsupial it starts looking a bit goofy when running around after awhile.
---
it doesnt suck. it’s actually amazing. but it has a bonus that makes you regenerate health, even while in combat, if your health is above 60%. 
---
and unyelding gives a bonus if your health is low. so a low health bonus in a high health armor. useless :(
---
I lost my BE railway rifle last year somehow 😁. Some mystery shit and im sure im not scripped it. Got new one BE25 at some vendor for 10k caps couple days ago, lucky
---
Thank you!!
---
Perks. It’s still not perfectly balanced with them but it’s a lot better. For example, let’s say they have a gauss shotgun and the frog legs perk on as that is possibly what your describing. Both the explosive and shotgunner perk card works on the gauss shotgun, so it can do massive damage, but will take up perk card slots. They also may have that card that makes their shotgun spray tighter and work like a sniper so as long as they get a hit off it’s massive damage. You may not have the commando perk on so your weapon was doing inferior damage
---
Farm water. I placed 10 industrial water purifiers at my camp and empty them out everytime I'm there. I then sell to vendors and quickly clean them out of caps daily. Yes, it does limit your camp location and I also have to waste a perk card for Thru Hiker, but I think it's worth it.
---
Where's the armor?
---
I've never worn a ghillie suit in real life but I don't think putting leaves on your chest somehow results in your shoulder clipping through your head.
---
I’ve been playing Fallout games since I was a kid. This has been part of my brain my whole life.
---
Do you need the whole set for that? I may need to grind more bullion to Switch to that since I’m becoming a vanguards buid
---
Yeah for the outfit but for combat 1st person is good
---
The cards come out in a randomized fashion.
---
Anything that stops you from going to the atom shop that’s the only bugs they have consistently fixed.
---
i had ONCE issue with auto-completing challenges and that time i reloged 3Mins before reset and loggin in 5mins after, 6of my 9dailies completed. Im always staying during reset (6PM for me) and its always workin normally
---
I did a non-legendary full health melee build. There's a lot of dying until you get to level 30 or so. Once you have control over your mutations and get your perks sorted things get better.
---
PS4 prices are so reasonable I recently started an Xbox character...Jesus the prices at camps are ridiculous 6k for one star legendary weapons I was selling for 400 caps on PS4
---
I wish we could craft something similar to the 'ammo crafting' packs we can buy from the travelling merchants. Those things are the real bulk value item.
---
I have experienced this many times but wasn't aware of the cause until now. Have re-created based on what I read here. Thanks for the tip. Hopefully they fix it because it's annoying AF. I keep a fixer and two handmades in my top 3 spots -- one handmade with prime receiver and one without, and I notice it happens a lot to me at queen fights. Now that makes sense.
---
Beautiful. I made it through the dupe myself, but some friends where a bit unlucky. Maybe they’ll get back in now, without a rollback of some kind.
---
It could be just a chance to happen if you are on at that time.
---
I do not know what is causing it since I have never had my challenges auto-complete ever.  But I am also working every day when the challenges reset so I cannot be online to test this.
---
Imagine adding Deathclaw claws to power armor ... yea okay i want that.
---
Almost any focused build works, any weapkn type can solo the game, no bloodied or junkies necessary. But if your build is incoherent then it may justifiably be tougher
---
I salute you.
---
Game development is just so involved, it could be being at a certain location while logging in near that time, or it could be 5 things you do before you log off, we don’t know for sure.
---
...because Fixer.
---
What will you do in the remaining time of the season? You get no reward for completing challenges now.
---
yeah, all 5 pieces. good luck on your grind!
---
What about when you WFK (Bathroom Break) and the camera is spinning around your character, and you come back and see someone launched a nuke. Then try to fast travel to the nuke zone 6 times. Does the game think the camera is still circling your character?

Are you on console?  Hacking is a pc issue AFAIK.
---
Lol believe me, it ain't. CoDers won't play F76 with asbestos gloves if they had to - I'm in both camps and there is literally zero overlap (well except me, I guess).
---
Unyielding, Vanguard, bolstering, and chameleon armor have been what I’ve been selling to players for armor. On the weapon side, I try and keep anti armor, bloodied, junkies, instigating, and even furious. Most weapons with explosive tend to sell.
---
Probably 1 hr in
---
 it was the first thing i checked and it has been a god send since previous fallouts didnt have this feature.
---
Only if it keeps them from stealing my bed.

Lol 350 gunpowder weight a bit, and giving away stimpacks and radaways to fresh players while most of them might not have traveling pharmacy  perk "evil laugh"
---
Check through [this list on the WIKI](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_junk_items), it will tell you what items yield what scrap, some of the things you list are components in fans, some in typewriters, gas cans, etc. 
---
Put some tatos, corn, and mutfruit in your camp and use your purified water to make yourself some adhesive when you need it.

Wood is all over the place.
---
I'll just use the dart gun on it
---
I think for some the game was more fun when they collected a rare outfit or item and it was actually rare or sought after. Say you've been hunting a red asylum outfit for months constantly hunting for it and you finally get one only to find out they've been duped extensively and the guy who duped the item practically gave it away to players. It loses its charm and the feeling of the item being unique I feel
---
in the title its typo mistake "first" should be fist. He should correct it so this IQ 20 trolls wont get downvoted so hard. That melee magnet hack literally fists you 10times per second and kills you instantly. Its workin from pretty far away but not on the whole map. Its common cheat on that NW mode

Also, Heart of the Swamp will spawn legendaries, but during the mob attacks (not always the final big monster-- Mirelurk Queen or Grafton Monster). Look for the glow on the mirelurks or ghouls that appear.

Really? Good to know. :)

I had the same issue. It’s actually a YouTube video that’s hilarious.

Theres a couple places that they spawn, the color is random though. I had a red one at first, then light blue, and now black. id really prefer a green one to go with my ghillie, but I'm fine with black. Dunno what other colors they come in. I believe I found them all outside the mine that hosts Uranium fever. I think I still have the blue one.

I love how the legendary run is space themed yet there's what, 6 rewards that are space themed? But then again, after seeing how every atom shop update is just reskins of the same crap, I'm not that surprised at the lack of creativity in rewards. I'm still gonna wear my hunter's long coat and cowboy hat.

We **can not** Stagger the Queen,  **Tank Killer and One Man Army  will not affect the Queen in any way period.** When she is 'strafing' us  with her guano, and doing that mid air stop it means she has acquired a target that she can't reach on the ground is all.
---
They removed our ability to cripple her wings, bethesda claimed they were going to fix this but it is starting to look like that was intended.
---
The Queen is **IMMUNE** to explosive damage, you may as well be using harsh language on her instead.
---
It looks like you are encouraging people to use hacked weapons, thats a no-no. I do know that bethesda just removed the bans from a bunch of folks and a lot of them were users of hacked weapons as well as dupers, but that does not mean that **using a hacked weapon is still not against TOS.**

Ok that is what I thought, I was trying to think of a perk that impacts shotguns on hip fire, but that would be cool if there was!

You can't really farm the bullion, but you can [farm the Treasury Notes, just go do all the public events that you see](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Treasury_note).

Having the same issue.  Also seeing alot of server instability.  Something is definitely up with the servers

I wish.

I'll test this on pc. I'm really curious. You just put the fireworks on your quick select menu and then switch to it and switch back to the weapon and it's reloaded?

Solar armor's set bonus only works if you are high health while unyielding benefits the player at low health. Its not bad its just... disappointing to get that effect on that armor type. I love my solar set.
---
Pc version of NW is full of aimbotting, wall hacking, and just blatant flying around. I block a player probably every third session. Had one person 1 shot my whole team in the first 10 seconds of the game. Head shots all.
---
All video games work on the basic principle of repeat and reward. When you learn how to beat an aspect of the game, you get rewarded. Sometimes it's the one you want, sometimes it's not, and you have to repeat that part of the game until you get what you want.
---
Fallout is trying, and struggling to be a social game. It struggles in that because it hasn't put in enough things to make it more social between players. And it struggles because it's working on a fan base used to playing alone and setting the terms of everything.
---
With duping, you remove the reward, which is the incentive for doing specific quests and events in the game. Why do the Encrypted event if you can get the plans for the fixer, or even better, a legendary fixer? Why bust your but at doing Project Paradise, when you can get the plans that drop for cash? 
---
So without having to do the content to get the reward, the only thing left is to run around and kill things. And honestly, this game isn't suited for that. There's just not enough content, even with all they have added.
---
And if you don't have any incentive to run the content, that shortens the game life for players.
---
And since this game is meant to be social, duping means people don't have to work together or help each other. Why bother making equipment to help out a new player, when all they are doing is grinding to get to level 50 to use the duped gear they got?
---
Also, legally, it affects Bethesda. It has to do with protecting their Intellectual Property and such. And I'm not going to go into that, because it's going to bring out all the "expert lawyers" who read something on the internet and disagree.
---
It's a fo76 sub -  pretty unintelligent question

It's not entirely about caps, its about the inconvenience it can be. Just providing a suggestion to make fast travel more enjoyable.

I have a low level shop for diluted chems, level 5 and 10 weapons, etc.  Armor and weapons are 5 caps each and chems are 1 or 2 depending on what they are.  Whenever I see a sale I check who is at my camp and it's usually someone over level 50 buying it out.  Whatever, I'll keep restocking it because I've seen it help some lower level players.

It's kinda funny because I always joke that I would feel so much more useful in the appocalypse. I just love to obsessively learn how to DIY everything not in the make a little drone way but like, make a ladder, sword fight, cook literally everything, apply most basic to moderated medical treatments, learn about bottany and biology, effective leadership, policy writing, how to rebuild an engine, how do you make a pully system?  Like, if I had someone who could just smelt and weld, I could make and run megaton.  Like it wouldn't matter in that would that I'm disabled or can't walk, I would be too valuable to forget about and leave behind and could actually contribute.  Also, I would bave given anything for my brother and I to have been a part of little lamplight.
---
In the real world I can't hold down a job for more than a few weeks, I am in my mid 20s with advanced dementia from the over 30 concissions I obtainted in my early childhood, and have been raped 124 times, so I'll take the appocalypse any day.  Just give me a girl with stars in her eyes and a pneumatic gauntlet on her hand and a dog to travel the wastes with and I'm set.  Hahaha
---
Imagine you bought a weapon, and it turned out to be duped. Now you're banned. As far as you know you didn't do anything. Also, the actual act of duping  affects server stability.
---
Talk to the hand
---
Because it changes every minute and it's kinda fun to play a broken game set in a broken world. If you had any idea of what's going on, you'd see that both are getting better.
---
I have seen her land on the bunker.  I am not sure that os correct
---
Not a bad spot to be in ;)
---
he forgot to mention that joining a team and being a part of a team that collectively does 1K damage to her will also get you loot.
---
I really am embarrassed that I didn't even think to try it till level 50+. But, I cant live without it now. For all the faults of 76, they've implemented several QOL improvements that I hope make it into FO5 whenever it comes out.
---
I don't understand this? Fast Travel used to work just fine with all mutations over a year ago. What happened? If they broke it, it can be fixed.
---
Nope not missing anything. Just the game.
---
Yes! To shit on people who actually play NW
---
I had this issue too. If you just need events for a daily though, cap a few workshops and 'Defend' events will start popping. You can cycle through events really fast with like 3-5 workshops.
---
Simple. Rare items should be rare. 
---
I don’t know how to explain beyond that. Everyone should be on the same playing field.
---
Pretty sure he used similar
---
Lol that's devious. But I kinda ~~need~~ want that cap influx from ever hungry 5.56 shooters...
---
Not my merge/idea, but my husband's: He clipped the settler wanderer's (aka, hippie chick) chair into the outhouse with the mole rat that pops up. If she's sitting in her chair and you activate the outhouse, the effect is hilarious.
---
Also, putting candles into the Fasnacht laterns makes for a lovely effect. There's videos on youtube that show how to use PA to pull it off.
---
I think bloodied or low health is also a factor as I ran full health with healing factor for weeks and saw the problem once out of every 20 or 30 travel attempts.  Since I switched to a low health build I see it 2 or 3 times every attempt to travel with the same mutations
---
more grinding with score is all, until some real new content comes along
---
I can empathize with that, but I also remember the feeling when I finally got the elder paint job. No amount of duping that plan will ever take away that feeling of accomplishment. To have actually found a red asylum dress...or any of the rare outfits...is an awesome accomplishment.
---
She lands other places and climbs onto it sometimes, but she rarely I'd ever lands on it directly.
---
Take a look at the Thunderpipe. The magazine blocks the front sight
---
You got it...
---
No they equip like grenades, but if you switch to them from regular grenades whatever weapon you have out gets a super buff to reload speed
---
Recently have started spawning IN rocks or under a car, or other dumb places when fast traveling.  But only just started.  Keeping the game fresh.
---
You are not wrong.    The bugs are the least surprising part of this game.   If you are truly a fallout fan and played the other games you know this.   
---
Personally I don’t care about duper’s.   Frankly they help the shitty drop rates of the game.  Having said that, if you broke the rules you deserve to be banned permanently.   
---
For me the problem is the hacking.   NW and weapons in adventure mode.   This is Bethesda’s biggest failure.   If a player is reported with video evidence with a clearly identified user ID then they should be able to copy that account to a private world and check the account.    If hacked weapons are found ban the account.     Done.
---
Im just trying do get downvoted for a negative comment rating on my profile, i actually love the game and play since first second of beta release 😂
---
That's just what this game is.  It's an MORPG without any dungeons or raids.  There is no end-game progression content for groups since they closed vault 94 which is really sad.
---
I still find enjoyment in setting goals for myself such as leveling or as you mentioned plan collecting.  I started working on collecting all the trade-able plans that are in the game and am down to 18 and it's been fun and will feel nice one I complete the list.  Don't really know what else to tell ya.  It surely isn't for everyone.
---
I usually just grab one of the hazmat suits at the entrance then run down two of the mines, drop off ore, hit the decon showers, and go for the other two.  You can snag 41 ore  during the first run of all 4 areas.  The ghouls pretty much ignore you.  There is no need for a specific build.
---
Thanks for clarifying. Will definitely test this.
---
I can get up to 450 if you’re thorough.
---
Thank you for your answer. You bring up some very good, valid points.
---
Now _that's_ good to know.
---
You can get up to 450 if you’re thorough.
---
Just in case OP or others are playing solo, Battle Bots is really hard to do without a buddy — I’ve seen folks say they can sprint to the other side in time to swipe the other card, but I can never make it work. With two people, it’s super easy.
---
The thrill of finding out what is fixed/broken/rebroken and the grind, oh man the grind. Got to get my SCORE fix...
---
actually another good point. i didnt know how black powder rifle are used. I understand that 30% of players here share funny pics and stuff, 30% for trade purpose and 30% just to complain and suggest (sometimes very stupid things).
---
Anything I should look for legendary wise as a gatling laser user? I bought the game a couple of weeks ago or so, my understanding of the new legendary system is a bit limited, and my current one is an ultracite with some weird shit. Executioners, Rapid, Rapid I think it is?
---
If you want to run an effective pistol build, Bloodied 10mm with a suppressor is the way to go, if your agility/sneak is high. Throw in at least 1 rank of all 3 Gunslinger perks, Escape Artist, Covert Operative, Bloodied Mess and Mister Sandman and you'll be killing Super Mutant Warlords in 1-2 shots. I use a Bloodied/Stealth Pistol build, alternating between BE25 and B2525, depending on the time of day. It's very effective, without making me feel OP.
---
That’s what I’m saying. The mentality they have they put things to attract everyone else from everywhere else cus it’s not enough to go off of what was good from 3, 4 and new Vegas. I would never pay 60 bucks for a battle royal mode but it’s there cus of kids younger than fallout 3
---
😂 there you can see how closed minded ppl are 😂😂😂 all i want is your downvotes
---
&gt; We like to draw out the fight to about 10 minutes
---
Bless people like you. As someone who just hit 75 but a week ago, these drawn out fights are a godsend. Xp and loot galore for the folks who need it. Keep doin gods work and a thanks from us silent lurkers.
---
`sp
---
I don't get it. I only see 2 antennas.
---
True, at level 355 I drop 1-3 nukes a day and do it for the fight. I was kind of mad a couple of weeks ago when a bunch of noobs showed up but those guys have heart, I like seeing everyone run around and get beat up, its part of the game and keeps some fun it for everyone that shows up.  Besides, I easily get the 3 "revive a player" rewards this way.
---
It depends where it spawns.  Certain spawn locations glitch the SB so it flys out of the zoned area.
---
Actually pretty smart for the cause i asked it 😂
---
It's really weird, sometimes I can destroy things soul from far away with 5% and other times I have to use a whole magazine with 95% chance AND crits. BUUUUT it is super fun
---
Rank 52, almost 53. Should be 54 by end of today
---
I earned it from the legendary vendor, so nope. If I would have copies of it, why would I care if I lost it?
---
Damn, you look like the swamp thing.
---
Would actually support your answer but im trying to get a negative comment rating m8 😂
---
Easily re-created the bug. Useful to know. Thanks.
---
Think I’ve just got the atoms after the combat rifle skin. Not sure where that is, high 50s?
---
I think the punishment should fit the crime. It would be pretty harsh to perma ban first-time offenders that only "shared" a few things with their friends. 
---
I agree that accounts with stacks of identical legacy items, or RMT trading, etc should be account wiped or banned
---
Side note: if you have a slick plasma rifle/pistol you should go buy the plan for the Plasma Caster Pulse Capacitor. It will attach to your rifle and convert it into a rapid fire barrage of flaming bolts and an ammo capacity of 300. It's tons of fun to play with.
---
Thaaaank you. 
---
Me, yelling at my screen because I don't have a headset : stoooop shooting her. Let. Her. Land.
---
Also the phys ed room at Vault Tech U. Main entrance --&gt; first hallway on the right --&gt; last door on the left (might be 2nd to last door, I can't remember).
---
Oh and why you two? Dont know who else doing the same like me m8
---
Gonna hit 81 and 82 today :) If we are getting 9 dailies again.
---
Bahahah well then, "it just works"
---
Relax your doing fine Week 4 out of 10 started 3 days ago and I'm also at Rank 50
---
Imma reccomend some reading. its not specifically about coal mining,  but it gives a good idea. 
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle
---
Start another character with a different build.
---
Then how can I place a floor (farmable dirt plot) against the border but cant place any crops because its saying its outside the buildable area?
---
Is it not still available? I still have the challenge for it.
---
I couldn't agree more. I don't really need them in adventure mode.
---
No, because that would encourage a group of nazis in game.
---
I've been checking the daily deal tab of the atom shop everyday looking for it. I need that, the cat topiary and the Thanksgiving display to make my camp what it needs to be
---
Cause you had to reply to yourself, dummy.
---
Honestly student loan debt, corrupt healthcare system, and credit cards are just the modern version of this.
---
55, have had 2 days worth auto complete but other than a few nw ones havnt misses a thing
---
You mean the stuff that people cheated into their camps that they knew damn well weren't supposed to be there? Oh poor them. I feel so bad they cheated and now their camps are screwed. Play stupid games...
---
ha ha ha. I didn't downvote you though!
---
We are getting 9 for the rest of the event
---
Makes me think of evil dead when ash had a bunch of little ash running after him.
---
The regular secret service under armor also has camo elbows for some reason.
---
Tried it on a weapon I got for 1400caps. 
---
The most bugged roll out of bugged 'magical' rolls. It's whole value depends on a bug not being fixed. Buy with caution.
---
It's probably a trade-only item, but not of the highest quality.
---
Estimated value:
---
PC's: 14000-23000
---
Some buyers could pay over 32000.
---
Ps. Kills queen too fast (seconds after landing) so I don't use it.
---
For starters, I don't consider it a bad game.
---
I actually just disconnect the power on mine, then reconnect it.
---
I know this is why they do it but its kinda rough on those who would like the rare drops for fully completing it like the rad barrel plan etc. I collect ore because of that reason. And it really does suck becaus elike you said the ore runner misses out. In between running ore Im madly waving a fucking shishkebab around healing the scavengers too because somehow despite it all,  frequently no one bothers to notice their health is going down or can pause the bloodshed to heal them. I spat the dummy today, gave everyone the angry emote and left. Real mature I know but jfc.
---
I collect ore every time but it feels like a punishment. I don't get the XP from kills, the loot, or the legendaries, and the event tends to end with one or all of the scavengers dying or us being 5 ore away from 100/100.
---
I try to collect and heal the scavengers but it's hard to try to do both :(
---
I create new characters and RP with them. I also have played sessions where I don’t fast travel and move my camp place to place as I go like I am actually wandering the wastes.
---
This was also an occurrence in Wales during the 19th century with the Crawshay family exploiting workers
---
Just perfect your gear, dial your build, get your camp all pretty. At this point it's about making your own fun since there's not much else to do
---
Funny, some camps placed on the edge of cliff it looks cool. However after a fast-travel I have a 50% to spawn at the bottom of the other end (or stuck inside the wall :D) just to fast travel again.
---
They made it official? Cool.
---
Ehhhhhhh, other than the well-warranted complaints about the game, we get tons of stuff like this posted on the subreddit.
---
.45 and 5.56 sell damn near the second I throw them in my vendor. Great for making a profit, though.
---
That is nice of you. 
---
That is not sarcasm btw!
---
Do you have speed demon?
---
Feature, not a bug. /s
---
Still the best quote ever made on that game 😂 but yeah just asking for downvotes didnt work well and thats why i have to provoke it a bit. I actually do love the game but at the same time im realistic and can discuss problems the game has without bashing it 💪🏻 at the end of the day its anyway all my friends i made in this game which makes it the most fun even if im missing endgame content like raids or other areas with bigger mobs of high lvl enemies, my friends can make the 1500th sbq to be fun
---
I've been doing this for over a year now. All you can do really is start a new character, keep grinding events/gear or start collecting items.
---
The best was when I spawned under/inside a car. There was a dog beside me growling and I was still somehow able to shoot it.
---
Hit 60 yesterday, casual play but consistent daily.
---
I can see they test their paid store content as much as they did with the game lol
---
I have a whole collection of different colours on display, red, green, blue, yellow, white, black, and the mining hat. Love those things. But yes, a combat helmet would be something I prefer over the mining helmet
---
I got your back, downvote incoming
---
Hard cosign! 
---
Furthermore, I hope they implement this and DON'T TELL ANYONE.
---
This is the very reason I am avoiding storyline missions. I'm lvl 153 or so, but have not done an actual mission in over a month. I don't even know where I am in terms of completion. Have never launched a nuke. Right now it doesn't seem like a waste of time to fuck around, building my camp and putzing around in events and scavenging, but if I didn't have the missions waiting for me, it would sure seem pointless. As flawed as that logic is, it works for me lol
---
I've seen her land directly on it. She maybe stayed on it for 8 entire seconds.
---
I had to make a first comment so ppl can start downvoting on a comment and not only my post because that was my goal, lets say we both are a bit dummies since you didnt get it on your own 😂 please dont take that post too serious since im only provoking to finally get rid of my positive comment rating as usually ppl like my sarcasm and upvote me even if i dont deserve it 😂
---
Choo choo! All aboard the Ordinance Express!!
---
This is why I would never like Cross Play with the PC version. On console the worst thing you can run into is Legacy Punji Board trap camps or people abusing the occasional dupe glitch but on PC? The amount of hacks/trainer hack/cheats possible on that platform is on a whole new level.
---
yes its bugged out and available right now till next patch.
---
Yep. And Squad Maneuvers 2. I can get to the other side with :01 left on the timer but the swipe never registers.
---
I started a few days late because I was bummed about Adrenaline being borked.. Im at 40 now
---
I had this same thing happen to me. I restarted the game and it fixed it, try that. For the future, just build simple wood walls and scrap them.
---
That’s a big no, and I think the general consensus is that a good thing. Keeps the console walled garden in place, just play NW on PC and you’ll see what I mean. :)
---
Thx m8 😜 appreciate it and i only give upvotes back to anyone
---
Yeah, some of them, for sure. Others had teammates place them without their knowledge. I'm sure others still were just told this was something meant to be in the game since you can blueprint the thing with relative ease. 
---
That's not the point. The fact that the support team can't do *anything* to help those that were griefed by others shows a complete lack of foresight on Bethesda's part. Especially when it took me maybe 5 minutes to think of a way to make the problem completely solvable by the player with no Bethesda intervention required.
---
Bethesda...
---
Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast. I will catch them.
---
Something with "checkpoints" or perhaps an "out" where you can safely exit to keep any of your progressively higher tier loot as the rounds increase/as you get deeper in, or contend with losing everything in your cockiness because you died to something more capable than you. (Bonus points if the risk is EVERYTHING you have on you.)
---
Make it have a genuinely valuable reward such as a choice of weapon or armour at certain floors or waves, solo you would get all the loot yourself but co-op you would divide the round rewards.
---
Hmm. I'm on xbone and have nothing like that happen. 
---
Only odd thing that happened to me was you know when the nightstalker screams and your screen goes all psychedelic? My screen got stuck like that. Had to restart my game to get rid of it,
---
Can I ask how much score you need per level now? At one point, someone mentioned the requirements plateaued out.
---
Dude, you head is in your shoulder, go to a doctor.
---
Mid 50s. Two nights in a row after playing, I was getting ready for bed and realized I hadn't finished all the dailies. Had to log back in to get those points 😖
---
Best answer ever!
---
This. Don’t forget to wear your Excavator Power Armor, bonus when mining comes in handy.
---
ip ban is a joke.
---
For example the safari backpack plan which I farmed for back in the day became worthless because some idiots tried to dupe it. Rare items should stay rare. Otherwise, it is a slap to people's face who rightfully earn stuff.
---
I just thought it would be a logical reward, regardless.
---
Wait, they used to give you atoms for daily events? How do you earn them reasonably now?
---
Did you summon him in less then 10 minutes? That event has a sub timer. The 30 minutes no longer applies.
---
Test your build against other players
---
Love him
---
Classic!
---
ok ok sex swing lol, defo sex swing
---
Well I was on my friends private server so it could also possibly be only effecting private worlds, that’s an interesting glitch to have though I don’t think I’ve ever experienced that.
---
In that case, I agree. Also it's much easier to copy paste these horrible looking ghillies then to make actual story content..
---
Pc problems
---
As far as I know, no one has ever been banned for simply having a duplicated item in their inventory. Bethesda has pretty good records of what’s been going on, regardless of what we may think or how they’ve come across in the past. One of my friends got permabanned from the last dupe. I warned him to stop but he wanted to be THAT GUY who gave things to his friends that they had been looking for for months. I think a lot of people were lulled in to a false sense of security because nothing had been done to players after the previous dupe methods were made public.
---
Now that I’m not sure of, I had no idea they changed it.
---
After running her hundred of times and seeing no pattern myself to her landing or not landing based on player positions, I’m going to call bullshit on this  unless someone can pull hard evidence from the games code that says otherwise, or someone does a well thought out and extensively documented study on private server. 
---
It’s really easy to fool yourself with cognitive bias.
---
I’ve heard people ragging on others over public mic about not standing on the bunker with the exact same theory about it causing her not to land, and yet, in many rounds I have seen 5-10 people standing on the bunker and she lands left and right.
---
It just ups the realism
---
This is why I'm afraid to touch any of my perks now - I'm so confused about why things work the way they do.  I run a semi-casual rifleman build, but there's this one shotgun I have that is weak as hell normally, but in vats one-shots everything but the the SBQ.  I'm so confused.... but in the end not complaining because I can switch back and forth between range and combat guns without real loss.
---
dont listen to toxic purists trying to scare you people,considering the unban wave that just went out for people who used a way more serious exploit (item and weapon duping), and the fact that bethesda didnt even wipe most accounts means you are 100% green lit to use this glitch consequence free
---
My leather armor turns to liquid when I move in 3rd person
---
In theory, the enemy scaling in One Wasteland could take into account the player's build and gear, so the same deathclaw for example may appear as higher level to someone with a meta build. I doubt it will work that way in practice, though, or make much difference to high level players in the eastern half of the map.
---
Could you please take a pic of them? Specifically the green one but I'd like to see all the different colors.
---
Just gone.  Not in the stash, not in the inventory.  They are just gone into the ether.
---
I was off work the entire first week of the race and even watched the screen as the challenges reset. They never glitched out. It has to be something else causing this.
---
And it was 11 AM for me :)
---
Waste of time. Next time before you exit match look for the players name and block and report them that way.
---
Spawn location mats existed before in the game and trap camps where the whole reason they got removed. As for are traps such a problem? Well, to put that into perspective, just recently they patched the ability to stack punji traps so they couldn't be stacked anymore since people were yet again making trap camps. 
---
The trap camps are usually easy to recognise though, 1x1 walled room with a single vendor? Chances are its a trap.
---
With Excavator, I regularly get around 600 lead ore from a lucky hole mine run.
---
Also over 100 crystal, and a few other things as well.
---
I think it was 3025 if i'm not mistaken. I can't log in right now to check. But i'm fairly certain that was it.. The amount of score needed increases by 25 per rank all the way to rank 100 as far as i know.
---
EDIT: Asked my wife to check. I'm at rank 80 and i need 3000 to hit rank 81.
---
Hey there! We've got this on our radar, but can I get your [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) name and platform you play on? u/bluekthulhu76 We'd like to get a look at your character to repro this.

But the deathclaw is not the alpha predator. At least not yet.

Ahh, shoot.  Okay, thanks for the info.  I'll let Pure now -- that's his part of things.

Just booted up my game, all but three of my dailies were auto completed, one of them was partially completed thinking I had killed 10 of the 15 ghouls....

Just hit 52 last night. Two days ahead of the baseline pace... and that's with missing 4 full days of dailies and 1500 points lost from autocomplete.
---
There's some kind of new glitch ? Please, educate me, sir.
---
You make your own fun. If you can’t find a way to do that than take a break until next season.
---
Yes because she is immune to the explosive I guess. I have got a zealots ultracite gattling plasma with 33% hit chance to try next time a nuke drops. It's rpm is 184 I think so not sure it will be enough. I'm loathe to use Junkie weapons on non-junkie characters but seems like they'd be the way to go. Someone posted a clip of a queen melt in this thread and it's definitely a laser weapon doing it though.
---
In addition to the Lucky Holes Mine with the Excavator Power Armor, here is a typical route I use to quickly get a lot of lead without needed to get acid for smelting.  This is good for people that do not have or do not use power armor.

When I played every other Fallout, all the way back to 1, I explored every nook and cranny, did every side mission, and gathered every rare or unusual item in each game. This Fallout makes that nearly impossible with the way the RNG works. Perhaps Bethesda should make some of these nearly impossible to obtain items available in the atom shop. It wouldn’t be pay to win because there is no “win” in this game. Yes, I agree that rare should be rare...but not nearly impossible to get. All of this will be a moot point anyway when the game gets mod support. Thank you for your answer.
---
Personally if Im outside I only play 3rd person, the aiming is alot better. Inside I cant really see anything when aiming, my PA takes up half the screen in hallways lmao
---
The tools they used, the clothes they wore, the house they lived in, and the food they ate were all paid for in scrip. Often, the mining company would charge obscene prices, spread along a 'payment plan' that forced miners and their families into poverty, as they could only barely afford the necessities. And if they died? Their families recieved nothing, if I remember correctly. Except maybe a bill from the company. 
---
Also, off topic but: When the unions tried coming to WV to make life better for the miners, coal companies saw their (basically free) labor being threatened, and sent in spies to sniff out the union reps. There is *still* a lingering fear of unions in some parts of WV due to the smear campaign ran against them by coal companies, paired with what would happen to early miners who associated with unions.
---
Unfortunately, theres only anecdotal evidence that says this could be true. There's nothing in the game files that indicates her landing is connected in any way to player positioning.
---
Just did the dailies and im on 53 ;)
---
It normally takes me a few tries.  What helps is to move as far away from the first card thingy and as close to the second as possible.
---
Yeah.  Hate those players.   Some think that they are doing other players a favor by ending it quickly but they  ignore all of the extra XP and possible legendary possible legendary spawns of a longer fight.  
---
Plus, I started a new character and really feel for low levels. It takes a bit of time with a minigun or super sledge to build up enough damage to loot her.
---
I got the safari backpack during the mole miner event. I was thrilled. To me, the fact that those plans are now widely available in no way diminishes what I felt when I got the plan. That event is coming back anyway, and Bethesda will probably bump the drop rate for those rare plans like they did for the rare masks in Faschnacht. But I do understand your point. Thank you for your response to my questions.
---
My experiences with the issue. 
---
I hyper focus and don’t pay attention to the clock when I play sometimes. I’ve been online and in game when the reset happens and had my challenges reset properly one time. Another time I was in game during reset because I was not watching the time and I fell victim to the bug. 
---
Another time I logged in for the first time of the day a few hours after reset and I had my challenges completed already. 
---
My spouse has had the bug happen while in game at reset and had it happen logging in well after reset as well. 
---
It seems to not have a concrete consistency as far as the what, when, where, and how goes.
---
I want ghillie paint for my ghillie suit.

It is a Pioneer Scout challenge criteria too ;)
---
Thank you, sir, interesting reading, I did not know that the currency was actually called SCRIP  :)  
---
The more I know about WV, the more I adore Bethesda people who made Appalachia, so many references all over the game.
---
I didn't even know what the title was referring to until reading this comment 😂😂😂
---
lovely grammar you have
---
19 months and still fast travel issues are not fixed.  If this disappoints you, it doesnt matter because they already have your money.
---
“If you PvP you deserve to be banned” 
---
😂 shut up mate
---
I personally don’t PvP as it isn’t fun anymore but fucken hell PvP players shouldn’t get banned
---
There was like a small patch in the middle of the screen that was clear. It was rather hard to play.
---
The reason i dont shoot her in the air is that i use shotguns. Not much i can do at that point
---
It's true. In a lot of areas of southern WV, your employment options are coal mining, joining the military, or selling dope. It's been that way for decades and unless there is a drastic change in the economy, that's exactly how it will stay.
---
Still gotta rebuild ur base tho.
---
Interesting. I’ll have to try adjusting my position a little. Thanks for the tip.
---
Rank 56, 2/3 way to rank 57. I am circa 4 days ahead of schedule.
---
Well, you can start giving out stuff like Responder Fireman Outfit, Red Asylum Dress for 5k then if you wanna make them available. Your logic is basically this.
---
Better you get a disposable account. You basically just need to go to the converted munitions factory workshop and blueprint the ammo factory. Saw the airport workshop with 3 factories working. The other day i went to a camp and saw one with locked loot but not the terminal. Put it up for .38 production lol
---
You could start a new game and try challenge yourself.
---
Example: Try beating the game as a miner (you can only use pickaxes) and that stuff
---
Well, now you don't earn them reasonably.  You still get a few here and there for challenges and there's some from the new score system but the days of getting enough to do something with are probably over.
---
Definitely get some better armor. I have round about 350 ballistic and 350 energy resi + a little bit of rad resi. Look out for your favorite legendary effect on armors and try to get the heavy armor variant of it for the best resi stats.
---
I'm 3rd person except when trying to shoot over the roof edge or through a window. 
---
However 3rd person becomes horrible when going up stairs. The camera bobs on every step and even gets hung up on some. 1st person is usually smooth.
---
dont worry, Season 2 will have BoS themed Ghillie skins for every armor
---
That video though!  Hahahaha!  Thanks for the Friday morning laugh!
---
U could block and report him but none of above can really help you avoid cheater. That\`s regular part of Bethesda Battle Royal and one of the reasons it\`s not so popular, always filled with a bunch of cheaters, some of them don\`t even try to hide they use a hack.
---
I used to run the high schools.. Nowadays I just run west tek for the laser rifles with scrapper perk. 80-100 plastic per 10 minutes-ish. Let alone the insane ammount of steel.
---
It is, and I have.
---
Just my 2 cents - I feel like that ability is earned from hundred of years of living as a ghoul, and doesn't make sense in 76.
---
I go back and forth. 3rd for travel and search 1st for precision fighting.
---
She lands on the fence and bunker and even on top of a tent, I have recently seen all of these happen
---
I though OP was talking about the *other* fast travel bug where you end up with a black screen and need to read-open the game. Seriously Bethesda needs to get their shit together. No more Atom Shop releases until they get their game to a proper working state.
---
It’ll be live eventually
---
Do you think anyone could hear them?  This isn’t a sword and board game so things like bards and wizards are out of place
---
It does if you do not let your character achive max fall speed. But it's a wee bit tricky. If you jump from somewhere, and make short jetpack bursts all the way down you will land safely. If you just try to land with holding down the JP burst, you'll die. Atleast it works for me that way. And no, i don't have any fall damage reductions effects on me.
---
One idea I was thinking of was to make Unarmed boost all "Bashing" damage, and make Pain Train also be boosted by Bashing and Unarmed boosts. That way it turns Pain Train into a potentially viable melee alternative, even if it is not as powerful as a bloodied unarmed sneak build.
---
I use 2x falling damage reduction armour pieces, I can land a safely from any height 👍🏻
---
Test things? Noone does that.  Your crazy, that's crazy talk
---
It does if you do it right. It's all about timing. I can leap off the buildings of Watoga and land safely into a run.
---
So it does keep going. Oh boy, this is going to be a journey. Thank you and your wife for looking into it! 😃
---
In addition to armor, start working in your damage resistance perk cards.
---
Damn I learned 2 things 1. I can get more lead 2. I'm not thorough
---
Any mod that can be done to the settler gauntlet should be doable to the power armor fists imho.  I also feel like the mole miner gauntlet should be a default mod for the Excavator power armor.
---
On my account, Wood and Leather variants look fine on a female character model, but the same armors on male character have the floating/clipping ghillie bits. So it's definitely a factor on more than just the 1 armor in the Legendary Run rewards.
---
4 waves of mole rats hiding underground is plenty for me. I would like to see more challenging defend events, not necessarily longer or more waves though. A legendary boss at the end would be awesome af.
---
I cheered when I got to the end of this! My husband is very introverted as well (and I'm the human pop-up ad!) so seeing you take such a HUGE step is awesome!
---
Np :) Just calculated i got roughly 2 weeks to go :) Slowly getting there..
---
I just use it when I am not fancy to jump in my PA and do rocketjumps... :)
---
Birdbones mutation solves the failing damage problem.
---
I was watching some show on Netflix and saw an old style metal desk fan in the background.
---
I thought to myself "Oh!  Steel, screws and gears!".....sad.
---
well it was kind of weird, I was only shown an imgur link and I had the same "wtf am i looking at?" moment, but when I went back, the imgur link was replaced with the youtube link.
---
I have yet to succeed with a Deathclaw using Wasteland Whisperer (i think). Pacify works, send him to camp does not pop up, even if I tick all the requirements ( think ).
---
But what was suggested to me was to chceck my camp budget (i have like 20% left so that could have not been the problem), but I'd suggest the same to you. He counts as a "defence", thus eating quite a bit of your budget.
---
you should be in third person at all times so as to admire your own majesty properly and from a distance
---
It's a setting you can turn on
---
Oh my God I have literally been laughing out loud at this whole thread....so true and so hilarious! Good stuff
---
When I get on a server that's not loading events, I just jump server (if Public) or start taking work shops (if Private).
---
This. If you just hop all the Fissure Sites you’ll almost always get your legendaries.
---
whatever lies you have to tell yourself. You are stupid. You are wasting your life attacking a game you don't like and probably don't play.
---
So have fun with your craptacular life.
---
Hey, what level are you guys on NW? Wondering how much longer I have to get the glowing skeleton outfit. And this fur lined coat....never heard of it but ofc I need it 😅
---
Plant tato, corn, and mutfruit at your camp.
---
I presume you already have a water purifier.
---
At a cooking station, those 4 items together craft to vegetable starch, which scraps to adhesive.
---
telephones, fans, giddyup buttercup parts, globes, life preservers, lanterns, gas canisters are good for everything else on you list except wood.
---
There is an oil seep at grafton steel (between the workshop bench and the vertibot pad)
---
My first colossus was pulled up to the bunker by two low levels.  They had got it to regen but were running out of ammo, meds, etc.  I helped them take it down.
---
My second one I found in the grove all by myself while farming flux.  I was low on all ammo.   Everyone had left the nuke zone and all public teams were full.
---
Ended up taking it down switching between my Zealots 50 cal, AA Handmade, grenades, AA fixer, and a minigun that I had picked up while farming flux.  it was stuck in the trees so I didn't have to deal with an open area fight.  That would be a battle...
---
Needless to say I made a ton of ammo after that.
---
sadly no Ghilie Raider Armor :(
---
Raider Chest w/ pocket is best chest piece for carrying capacity
---
It’s not too bad if you practice, and it’s worth it imo because you can basically repeat battle bots as long as you want to keep server hopping for it.
---
Edit: I normally try to jump over the stairs, if that helps.
---
It may go back to HHGTTG, even
---
I finished last Sunday, after missing the first two weeks.  Low health definitely has a leg up.  
---
Score system is perfect for me, I just kill things with xp buffs, and I loot almost nothing.  Looting is a waste of time once you have ample resources.
---
No clue I was just using a bloodied handmade but I heard a mingun and railway gun going off. There was about 10 people at it.
---
I love this idea!  Currently the only solution now is to move camp to get the phantom items back into a list to either place or delete.
---
Nope
---
3 is amateur. I saw one with 30 yesterday. 6 fusion generators to power it all
---
Imagine if they go the entire season without fixing this.
---
you can still max rep with both regardless of who you side with
---
Rank 49. Going steady. Definitely getting my stars &amp; planets wallpaper so I'm happy about that, now thinking the firefly lamps would compliment it nicely. So it goes.
---
That would explain why there aren't huge super mutant turds lying about.  Only scorchbeasts leave dung piles...every thing else uses a porta potty.
---
Yes, report while in the match and send the screen shot to Beth in your ticket. Also block and then leave and reload the game, you shouldn’t end up back in a session with them again (unless you get unlucky and there’s no other matches).
---
I would not be surprised they made that impossible after people figured out you could use the free states one on the t-65 and bypass needing gold.. That worries me for the upcoming vertiguard skin and backpack however =/
---
Actually if you have good enough eyes and you know the gun well enough despite being in a stealth field it is possible to aim effectively with a cloaked gun.
---
So I can still get my Mini Gauss and Ammo vendor even if I tell the Raiders to go suck an egg and help those poor idiots in Foundation?
---
Holy shit. That must be taxing the server quite a lot
---
Secret Service weapons, plans from Regs.
---
[This Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/589) will shut up just about everyone if you are on PC. All you hear is the beeping before they start talking and then.....silence. Blissful, SWARMIN' ALPHA VERMIN silence....
---
It can’t be built in someone else’s  camp. I hope it comes back too. Along with other options.
---
Most of the rewards are boring, uninspiring, and feel really tacked on for it to get it out fast.
---
Kind of. I’ve had a weird issue where I loaded in at one when survival was a thing and got melted.
---
Agreed, The card swipes at battlebots is tedious - but can be done.  Took me 6-8 tries yesterday before I got it.
---
Yeah I guess I didn’t think about that I could’ve saved my gold. I actually never even knew you could do that
---
the two factioms will still love you even if you screw one (or both, by keeping tje gold for yourself) over. just do both quests until you get the "raid 79 with this faction" quests and pick the one you like best. and then grind dailies.
---
I do too but mainly because of grenade clusters.  What sick prankster thought of that one?
---
Top kek, I hope there will be some consequences for those who abused it.Mostly I do not encounter these glitches because we ( 3 friends ) are playing private all the time.
---
He doesn’t spawn just there. He also sparks near the Junkyard and south of Morgan Town
---
No that's a myth. I have tamed at least 20 animals, from megasloth to mirelurk kings (the best) and my camp budget is always full. Haven't done it for 3 or 4 months so think its changed in another way
---
We've been working on this one, it's proving to be pretty tricky with a lot of different factors rolled into one. However, it is high on our list to be addressed and the team is really passionate about getting this one taken care of, it's definitely a frustrating one to experience.
---
Fallout 2 also has Mine Scrip. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Kokoweef_mine_scrip

well, till someone jumps in the way and combo breaks you.
---
or a different mob attacks and such.
---
You miss, she will be free before the next reload. (though if you had faster reload legendary, or a quad crossbow, you might not have the issue.)
---
But my max is about 9 in a row on her.
---
At standard crossbow reload speed.
---
I’m level 109ish. I stopped playing after I hit 100 until the ghillie suit reward dropped a couple months ago
---
It’s awwwwwwfulllllll

[Centralia, PA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralia,_Pennsylvania) is what happens when Coal Mining takes a terrible turn... (Gonna assume this is what the Ash Heap is based on)

As long as the blades are retractable and make a "SKNNK" noise like Wolverine when they are deployed.
---
strongly agreed. OP weapon could be used only for 100% loot while she is an air and then just go for mobs. I ve noticed that she lands to fight just one player who can engage her. As for staggering her it doesnt matter bcz she dies in the air as well. So if u r OP u can control the situation pretty well but there is no need to kill her fast at all.
---
Why give you one skin, when they can piece out that skin int 5-10 different skins and not have to make something else new?
---
almost always first person, except on the rare ocassion i put on power armor.  having a mix n match set to look like MMPR megazord, 3rd person just looks cooler in third.
---
I can't stand the extra larg mag on a gattling gun anyway, it takes up the whole screen haha. And I've never had to fire 500 rounds straight with a gattling gun, I just use the standered mag for it
---
Edit, but I do agree a lot of the rewards are meh and don't fit the theme
---
Yes, you just have to grind the daily reputation missions after the main quest. It takes two or three months I think to max it out.
---
Whichever side you go with, you can do daily quests with both sides after.
---
basically, yeah. just keep doing dailies and they'll love you again. i mean the random unnamed ones may be salty you didnt help them get the gold, but once you've gotten enough radio tubes for them they'll worship the ground you walk on.
---
it's a bit of a grind, but totally doable if you keep at it.
---
I don't understand people who rush through games like this.
---
What does he carry that's rare? I've got a level 280 and a level 95 and have never encountered him.
---
Caps mean less and less the more you level up.
---
Started the game ~2 months ago and don't know what's "the best" PA to use so I don't even fuck with it. I'm still using armor I earned during fasnacht so...yeah.
---
I used to always load up the Wolverine Mod for FO3 and FONV, so of course I'd be on board for that!
---
I'm guessing you mean the Responder Vendorbot? If you're just going to Charleston Station, expand your range of locations.
---
Lady Janets - down the road past the overturned bus, below Lady Janets. There's a second random encounter spot, if you go the opposite way, above Lady Janets, past the jeep, but the Responder Bot doesnt' show up there.
---
 
---
White Powder Ski Lodge - run down the road past the car, turn around, and run back up the road
---
You can get many of the outfits from one of the new Travelling Merchant, I've only seen her across the road from Gorge Junkyard, between the junkyard and the garage,  at a random encounter spot.
---
Add those spots to Charleston Station when you server hop, if nothing else, you'll find some weird encounters.
---
Very helpful, thank you.  Have a +1
---
37 UGH.
---
This bug started when the fast travel timer was introduced. Could yall maybe poll the community and see if we actually need that timer? Id rather go back to having to run from enemies to fast travel out if it means removing this bug sooner.
---
Totally forgot about those :D  
---
But thanks, FO2 weekend, here I come ! ( yes, but first I will have to do my chores in FO76 :D )
---
Is there a way to select what mutation you want to remove?  I'm on x-box and have never noticed that before.  I thought you roll the dice with Radaway and whatever is removed is removed.
---
No. At least from an airsoft perspective, couldnt tell you in an actual combat situation.
---
I started playing pretty recently (lvl 34), and just had my first nukashihe experience, and remembered the 2-3 times i had fast travelled to really random locations and wondered if I had accidentally drank it, if  it was a mutated condition I didn’t notice Or a Bethesda bug
---
Toxic Valley is also good for violet.  
---
Different enemy set, but be sure to get Wavy Willards in the zone.
---
It really is mind-blowing that they don't test these cosmetics at all before throwing them at us.    
---
How many of these items have had bugs or other visual issues such as being visually intrusive etc.  
---
It's quite disappointing that their quality control is so non-existent.
---
Yea I can't say I've ever emptied the 500 rounds. I think I generally reload at maybe 300. But still, it is disappointing that they fixed the sights lining up previously with the standard skin, just to mess it up with the Legendary Run skin that you get pretty significantly far into it
---
I know it's a joke but for anyone that didn't know you can just create a public team and finish the "complete event as group" and "take a photo in a group" by yourself even if no one joins.
---
No, you get to grind them both for months.  :D
---
I play bloody melee and can take the queen solo in a couple of minutes, but a fight that is drawn out longer is more enjoyable and profitable for all.  My group likes fights to last 10 minutes or so.  We bring her down to regen, than switch to adds with teslas so we can tag but not kill.  If her health is coming down then we continue farming adds, if not we take here in thirds on each landing.  The adds will spawn many 2 and 3 stars for profit.  We always try to share the 3 star ones by doing the come here emote,   So stop assuming that bloody players are the ones melting the queen.  There are many scrubs using hacked in 50 cals, and various bugged guns that do that.  I know that my crew (mostly bloody or junkies) does not like when people melt her and have nuked the offender's camp if we can determine who did it.
---
Also near Lady Janet’s Soft serve, Riverside Manor and White Powder Winter Sports. There’s a YouTube video on spawn locations.
---
Dont use wasteland whisperer. Animal friend is all you need. Camp budget is not an issue, I believe it was patched a long while ago. To TAME you have to get really close, damn near touching the beast with the muzzle of your weapon.
---
You also need to be a higher lvl than whatever you are taming, not double the lvl.
---
Exactly the same as me. I never used the 500 mag for gatlings. The 250 mag lasts like 27 minutes continuous fire with the slow firing speed gatlings have anyways (might exaggerate a little). And the reload speed is extremely fast.
---
That’s pretty close to where you should be at 50. Now it’s time to grind for better armor unless you’re a sniper.
---
HAWT DAYUM!  :D
---
You know it’s bad when you are walking outside and noting things in your head that you can “scrap” in the event you’re in a post nuclear world, IE a pile of logs next to a house and that Pickaxe and Wood axe you can break down for wood and steel. I catch myself doing that in my head while walking my route outside. Then when I go to the grocery store and see cranberries, well that’s needed for cranberry relish... Yeah fallout has consumed me too. Damn you Bethesda! At least WE will be ready for a post nuclear world. RIP everyone else. Haha
---
100% fall damage reduction baby.  I fly where and when I please, and I land where I land!
---
Forward Station Delta, Drop site v9, Survey Camp Alpha, Big Bend Tunnel East, Watoga Civi Center (Vertibird) all three bottom right corner of the map. And Camp Venture north of all that. That was my rotation for the lvl 50 power armor parts.
---
You have to learn to use it. I jump off buildings and mountains all the time and float down by tapping Y
---
It's honestly not that important.
---
I can accept bugs and issues here and there, but lately it just seems that they are constantly dropping the ball with their cosmetic items, which people are either paying for (Screaming Eagle) or earning through grind (Legendary Run/ NW)
---
Trap Camp griefing is the stealth best part of the game.
---
Can't wait for the ghillie bed and lamp set!
---
Grind score.  Wait for the events every 3-4 months.
---
Am I lucky if I successfully fast travel the second time?
---
If that was the sole reason you bought it and it doesn't work, you can request a refund btw.
---
And now we need to add an Assaultron helmet mod that gives us a Cyclops style eyebeam.
---
This is all in game assets Bethesda!  Give us the X-Men mods we need!
---
Woah there slow the fuck down. Gotta save some stuff for the atom shop.
---
it is heavy as hell...
---
Ha! That's fantastic.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL3RCTMEKOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL3RCTMEKOM) 
---
That's because you're facing the rock.
---
I mean it was but the other stuff is cool to. But yeah thanks for the info
---
If you are PS4, I have a full set of T51 plans on my vendor, along with a few mods and nuka cola paint.
---
People just don't like people cheating to get the hard to get stuff.  Makes them feel like a sucker going out there and grinding.    
---
It's true that it has no effect on anything really, it never bothered me, but I really don't care about having elite gear because every mob in this game is a joke.
---
Your the only one on here that thinks this is a bad idea lol 😂😂🤣
---
i've been seeing lv200 and 250, is that legit...?
---
I know you're just the ComManager but holy shit - does Bethesda test ANYTHING!?
---
The stuff feels a little like the discarded ideas pile. Tacked on to give the feeling of progress. Just wait until you get the captain cosmos outfit, it doesnt even include the helmet
---
At what point is it crashing?
---
Junk items are not going into the scrap box as junk items: the scrap box only store components.  
---
The gunpower is a craftable item, so it can't go directly in the scrap box either.
---
Same thing was used here in the mining towns and ironworks here in South Wales, although it was known as “truck shops”.
---
Nice!!!
---
Already met with the xbox one recently and it was such a great tool.  Been narrowing down my list and only 18 more to go myself!  Bravo to everyone involved with putting this together for the players.
---
The "magical" thing has always been possible to do, but it has become more widely known in the past weeks. And it is an exploit. While i would not be worried about participating on killing the enemies affected by the exploit, i certainly would not do/start the exploit myself.
---
Those I know that still are banned had reports previously filed against them for behavior eg the guy who was reported to BGS and PS for harassment is permabanned whereas those who merely duped a shitload did not.
---
I think it is more complex than 1st.
---
Prefab ghillie base next season
---
5 seconds is the world record.
---
I'd rather earn things than purchasing. I like a sense of self satisfaction.  You cant get that from buying everything, and frankly I think that's the easy way out. I wouldnt change it at all. But thats my opinion.
---
When the bad guy reaches the end of the board.
---
Company doctors, too. Can you imagine, having your healthcare tied to your place of employment? Good thing it ain't like that now.
---
Who needs damage resistance when you’re invisible and drop enemies before they know you’re there ;)
---
Can you expand on the "low health" thing? I'm newer to this game, though I play like a feind. I don't have a particular "build", mostly focused on maxing carry weight so I can hoard all the things.
---
I am not complaining about damage.  Not at all. I have a magic gun, and I only use it on the first health bar. I like the adds too.
---
It is the whining. No other group "complains" how others play.
---
Do you have to be a sarcastic prick?
---
Unfortunately I did. I collected a lot of stuff and I am currently 20 pounds overweight and my box is 795/800....
---
59 and I’m sure most people will finish it, some already have finished the board and just about everyone says it’s mostly a disappointment of rewards. Anyways hoping I reach at least 60 or 61 doing dailies later this afternoon
---
Where do I make bulk stuff?
---
Gonna work on that now
---
Unfortunately I never seem to get enough high radiation fluids
---
I'm just looking for a date
---
I haven't done that event since I accidentally one shotted the Wendigo at the end of it. I thought I was going to get lynched.
---
I think if a trap camp kills/injures you you should then be allowed to destroy their camp without having to resort to explosive bait. Might stop people doing it because really it is kinda lame. Or just simply make punji boards not work on people unless they're in a workshop. 
---
The other night i encountered one. Lost like 5 steel or something. Not concerned about that (i have enough junk to last me a year) but what bothered me most is that it was near flatwoods and there were a lot of lower level players around. Most of them probably haven't got in the habit of stashing their stuff frequently. I could see a few lower levels going to the camp. I stood near it and tried to warn people by shooting at them and giving them a thumbs down. But they went in and melted. 
---
Eventually i went and made as many explosive baits as i could and kept throwing them at the room with the vendors. But i only had ten or so. It damaged the walls a few times but not enough to make them server hop.
---
Just hearing the name ofthe town is going to make me do another rewatch of Justified, damnit. "You will never leave Harlan alive!"
---
Season 1 started on 30th of June, and lasts 10 weeks. So ends september 8th?
---
Hunters long coat is what most people are after but he’s got quite a few things
---
The strangler is a pretty close 2nd for the time being
---
Agreed the stars wallpaper and planets and stars wallpaper was one of my most wanted things I got
---
Sad.
---
Only way I've found to get that thing to be near consistent is in 3rd person, Charge First, then VATS. But, don't VATS too far away with too low a hit chance. 
---
I've had the same exact experience with the ants that /u/rammadeus is talking about with this gun. 
---
The thing is just too inconsistent, it's awesome, but it needs some fine tuning.
---
Oh yeah, I know right??! this is why if I go to someone's camp I usually equip power armor and stash all the junk, I almost died a few times because people put their camps high in the mountains above the abyss. also got such people quit from the server as soon as some people got in their camp so everyone would fall. could be a coincidence but happend a few times. they don't even get anything from doing that apart from making other players pissed. Sometimes people somehow make you teleport in a cage, inside a structure, put traps around vendors (lots of them), trap you inside locked buildings..someone told me they knew a person who put camps on top of the mountain and as soon as people came to his vendor he'd remove the floor.. and that wasn't even a kid.. If you're so bored of the game you need to do this just quit and don't make others' experience a pain..
---
yeah, if you do it one more time when its glitched with FO 1st tent while enemies spawning in the middle, you will get permabanned . Trust me, thats how bethesda games work , not a single glitch in their games, only this one \*wink wink\*
---
Ya that’s what I was referring too
---
They already have one in game. It's called a bunk bed and I already called top bunk.
---
Just my opinion but the plushie and the chicken coop are  smaller than i expected. The only thing i like is the tree with the hanging man. I only made it to rank 80 and already lost hype to do the rest.
---
either chemists bench or tinkerer's, cant remember amd im at work so cant check. it costs one plastic plus a set amount of what you're bulking. wont save weight but it'll make scrap sellable to npcs.
---
I never encouraged anybody to use or obtain any hacked gear. I play on console so hacked items do not exist outside of duping. The weapons mention in the video perform the way that they do because they are bugged. Not hacked. Ofc all of this goes out the window with pc. I have never encouraged that somebody violate TOS.
---
Points 2 and 3 are correct.
---
I disagree about 1. It certainly does work. In midair.
---
But but but! You get all these *items* now instead of some paltry useless *atoms*, how are you not happy for them?? Mind-boggling! :O
---
^(Forgive my ignorance, noob here I guess, but wtf) *^(is)* ^(this ghillie thing anyway and why is it so popular/prevalent??? Where's it coming from or why should I know about it?)
---
It's getting reworked in the future. If you can wait, I'd wait.
---
GTA San Andreas game of the childhood 👍
---
Of course the do. Your patience *ba dum tsss*
---
Targetting HUD for the obvious reasons (Cloaking bastard assaultrons..), Calibrated legs are standard as well. For the chest I run Emergency Protocol even though I don't run bloodied. (Though my BE 50cal is tempting me I will admit.) I like the extra security from EP and if I do need a jetpack I have a second power armor set for that. (We all know the only reason we generally use it is for the bunker wall glitch anyway..)
---
Thank you, good to know. I've only seen the clustering in the past week or so myself. To be honest I had not paid much attention to this event outside of the questline. When I started seeing the whole server migrating over there I went to see what was going on.
---
Appreciate the response!
---
When they first released this season, there were all these posts with maths showing how it would be impossible to finish on time with the amount of challenges available (at the time) and XP required to reach lvl 100. It was very discouraging tbh. And here you've finished like 6 weeks early without spending atoms? Craziness.
---
Surely not the chickens though?!
---
Really hoping they patch this exploit out soon.  Usually means only one or two people will get all the kills.  And while it doesnt effect higher level players like myself who are only there for the treasury notes it really sucks for the sub 100s that really need the xp.
---
I agree.  I still use the hellfire and like it but it does have a few issues that should be looked at..
---
Unfortunately there are like so many cosmetic issues with gear and skins right now.  Who knows if this will ever be looked at.
---
np
---
no it doesnt. u can have em all at one time.
---
Lol speaking of these, why does the pass have like 8 different ghille outfits?
---
I was on a hike with my family about a month ago when I saw a fallen tree along the path and thought "I wonder how many wood scraps I'd get from that."
---
You can have 18 if you like, just can't have carnivore &amp; herbivore together
---
While i guess this could be a nice QoL addition i find that the favorites wheel works well enough.  Although that could use some love too I think.  Hell, the whole UI could.
---
Chickens are my favorite thing. Adds character to me farming patch lol
---
Ok
---
For now just scrap the damn thing!
---
Yes, either empty it or wall it off for no access
---
I enjoy my simple sheep squatch mascot outfit honestly
---
This is why I made a post--I wanted to name and shame the dude but serious it's this kind of silly shit that ruins the experience for some peeps.
---
I ALWAYS stash before I shop, but I feel the biggest hypocritical aspect is people claiming 'oh we don't have real pvp so it justifies me being an asshole' when I was more than game to throw down and he ran off after half a mag through his windows (doing no damage obviously).
---
Real talk I feel for peeps without Fallout 1st- as between every base or tent visit I sit on zero scrap.
---
Thank you for the info, appreciate it!
---
Used, yes. Your camp just doesn't show up for anyone outside of your team.
---
Yes. Only way to stop people from using them is to store the vendors or by removing the items from them. Only thing that happens if you power down, is that your camp won't show up on map. But someone can find it by accident.
---
Ouch! thanks for the warning on being banned!
---
I also once had my rifle continue making shooting sounds long after I left the area, confusing and annoying the locals.
---
Depends, was it a cow or a bull?
---
I’ve done the grind. Over 4000 hours since the game launched. I got the plasma grenade plan from the Christmas event and I STILL do battle bots trying to get the plan to drop from an event. For all the times I’ve had people show up without actually earning the things I’ve gotten through hours and hours of grinding I never once felt like a sucker because they’re the ones that missed out on the fun and the FINALLY feeling of obtaining it. 
---
I’m a legit level 1040. It was a goal I set when I first started playing, to reach level 1000. When I finally hit it, I was so happy. Shortly after, people started using god mode and stacking aid items to get unbelievable xp and level up in to the thousands. At first, I felt robbed because I did it the right way. Then, when people that were a higher level than me needed help, advice or equipment modded they came to me because I had done the work and built my character and learned everything as I went along. So even though some of the shine might have worn off because of how many people exploited their level, I’m happy because I know I did it the right way. I never set out to be the highest level in the game. I play for me.
---
long story short: shoot her only for 100% loot and get delecious xp from all mobs around. dont go with low firerate weapon, dont use OP weapons to solo her if you are not solo. Freeze her only to help players get 1k HP out of her. 
---
corrections: she will land to fight no matter how many people are on top of their tents/fence. staggering issue does matter and it is bad for players who waste so much ammo and good for players who want to farm xp/acid/meat/etc
---
ah okay, I guess I can wait. When do you think the rework will be?
---
It's just a skin for the armors in the game. They don't mesh well, the leaf strands float, the block your view, and just look bad in general. I wasn't super into them in the first place but some people were and its just disappointing in quality.
---
I think that this is really big, and Bethesda should have a look at this. An atomic shop paint is a little bit smaller thing than this
---
Well you can press and hold B to back out
---
Wall it off no because some are using the photomode glitch thingy
---
Is now a bad time to point out that the dishcloths in Fallout are the same as in Skyrim? I keep trying to pick them up when running around Skyrim, but the game won't let me.
---
Yea im lvl 250 and I was totally unaware of the scortchbeast queen fight etiquette
---
I never knew that! That definitely helps.
---
That's a good idea that I didn't think of. Or simply make the ammo/launcher/special repair part non-tradeable like some of the new items launched with Wastelanders. They could also put a limit on the number of nukes you could carry (this would likely need new coding).
---
I would hesitate on the high weight however, I feel that is part of the reason that some people don't carry those weapons. This game already has a weight management issue, and I know I purposefully only have two heavy guns for this reason (that I switch back and forth with as they use different ammo). Too high a weight, and people may consider it too much effort to use. It would need to be a balance between difficult to acquire and takes a ridiculous amount of time/resources to use that it becomes never used. 
---
Another solution would be to introduce the nuclear briefcase (non-tradeable) into adventure mode, with the caveat that nuclear codes are non-tradeable and either expire each day or when you log out. Make it that you have a nuclear briefcase (perhaps with a repair cost with each use), and that you have to find codes each time you want to launch a nuke. Keep it simple, all you need is the codes and the briefcase to launch a mini nuke, perhaps in a limited area based on where you are. This would make it a challenge to get (but not impossible), while having a mechanic that doesn't benefit dupers.
---
IIRC the sculpture was a reward for completing some of the large community tasks. It might have been killing millions of scorched? I'd have to look it up.
---
But out of everything I don't think they'd release it on the atomic shop to buy since it was a reward for Project Clean Appalachia
---
Just never crouch.
---
Well then, sounds like you know your options
---
My turrets don't react to her until she passes the garage door, she kind of teleports for a brief second and that seems to register her as hostile. And then I can kiss my turrets goodbye :P
---
Scout ghillie armor does the same thing. Super super disappointed.
---
It’s a shame because the SS armor looks pretty damn cool in 3rd person.
---
Cool. Add those spots, I've found the Vendorbot in those places. Seen it the most at the place below Lady Janets, then Charleston, and fewest at White Powder.
---
Sweet talking about that is there a way to get a lot of veggies cus I'm dying
---
Yes and no.  While this is a more important cosmetic item on it's own, the offense really isn't as egregious as something like the gillie camouflage paints which are super bugged out and affect visibility.  As opposed to the hellfire which just makes it look not as appealing.
---
I agree with you that it should be looked at soon like so many other things but that's not how they do things over there and you and I both know it.  We will be lucky if this EVER gets looked at.  Sucks but it is what it is.
---
Also I press B off the exchange confirm page to go straight back to what I was converting.
---
Hanging man is cool but should have been a Halloween event item. What does a Hanging Man tree have to do with Space Bethesda?
---
Does work pretty well in my raider/junkie camp though
---
I do it because it’s one of the events either a chance to drop the jumpsuit set
---
If you look down with your weapon, it’s worse than crouch
---
It's not just mutations. I never use them and I've got it.
---
They didn't give a specific date, just that they were gonna rework it and they gave out some of the quantities the new ui would deal in (turn in 100s of bullets, have 100,000 ammo point capacity)
---
I doubt it'll come out with patch 21 in August but you never know
---
Thank you for the info. There are so many quirky things in the game it's sometimes hard to know what/when/where things started occurring and what is or isn't safe to do. I've seen clusters of Radstag like this before, but not recurring time after time and figured something funky might be going on.
---
Yep
---
By the way, this whole series of skin can't be favourited to play with them in Nuclear Winter. Is that going to be fixed as well?
---
This is how I found out. I wish someone had told me to start the scout quest line early, because I missed out on a lot of credits. Should be on the newbie advice list.
---
I never said that standing on the fence or tents prevents her from landing. Read it again.
---
Plant them at your camp
---
I'm on console, and I find the favourites wheel decent, but it can be difficult in the midst of a high stakes fight to be sure you are choosing the right thing. Like as a Melee, I use Bufftats during a high stakes fight (like SBQ or Wendigo Colossus), and unlike other Fallout games, you can't pause to get your chem on. I play bloodied, so pausing for a second or two when enemies around can lead to a quick death.
---
To be honest, this isn’t exactly their first fumble with bag materials 😎
---
I just want the eyes of the ranger helm to glow like they did in NV :(
---
I spend most of my time picking off scorched, dogs, bugs, etc. with a silenced sniper rifle while invisible.  Very seldom do I get spotted by the enemy and you can rack up some serious XP and great loot from the legendaries that are running amok.  And like you said, it helps the big guns focus on the queen by not wasting ammo/time on the pests.
---
Not complaining about the gunpowder. I turned it into 308 almost immediately and shotgun lol
---
Lack of quality care is a trademark for Bethesda.90% of the time when a new thing comes up, I think: Oh cool idea, I like it.
---
Then i try in game, and figure how things are in fact incredibly lazy and most of the time buggy.
---
Still I like the game, but I learned to keep my expectations very low.
---
I shoot her in the air constantly and 75% of the time that she lands she lands on the ground right in front of me. She aggros on to me because I am shooting her in the air.
---
100%.
---
I find it interesting that no sooner are dupe bans lifted then the shitty behaviour starts. I'm not saying all Dupers are trap campers by any means- but the timing is a bit suspicious.
---
Some people can't help themselves but totally fuck other peoples enjoyment. I call it small dick syndrome.
---
I have worn a head veil while hunting, and it does obstruct your view somewhat (including while aiming) but it's more like looking through a screen (or, you know, a veil) with no big, opaque chunks in your face (at least not ones that you can't move)
---
I mean, as a herbivore that meat will do nothing for me. But I also don't care if you share a card or not at all. But enjoy my level 1 bodyguard I guess? :P
---
i dont even know anymore whos more sarcastic  🤔
---
Then I don't understand what you're saying? Gunpowder already gets stuck in the stash, but if it were junk then it would at least be able to benefit from junk perks. I'm not too concerned about losing it on death because I usually come back home carrying like 3 times as much gunpowder as lead, and the one time I ever ran out I just walked over to the chemistry bench with some acid and cloth.
---
Nice one.
---
At least it's a perfect metaphor for how the entire game works. Grind grind grind and be faced with bugs, glitches, and untested cosmetics until you finally get to the underwhelming finish line. 🤷‍♂️ Meanwhile, instead of fixing said bugs they add the ability to throw money at it instead.
---
This x1000.
---
I want purple!!! I can't stand the look of the mining helmets, and they've got it better. With the cost of SS helmet, you would expect some mods atleast.
---
I've heard a rumor (somewhere on here), that the server you are on can play into this. For example, if you get one prefix a few times, likely it will appear more often on the same server. Now I haven't tested this myself, so I wouldn't go by that unless some others can confirm it or not. I didn't keep track when I was crafting my SS Armor.
---
Yeah, you can plant them once you have the seeds. A good place to get a starter bunch of seeds is either another player's camp or Aaronholdt Homestead, on the northwest bit of the map above 76. The Green Thumb perk is very helpful for this if you have it available to equip.
---
That's probably because everyone else is waiting for her to land. Since you're the one wasting ammo, you aggro because you're doing more damage.
---
For every 1 time she lands, you're probably causing her to reset 10 times.
---
Silva Homestead in the Southwestern side of the Forest. Tons of corn and razorgrain, perfect for soups and such.
---
This. So this. Was in a fight with very angry level 95 SBQ in the nuke zone the other day. Some idiot with a Gatling laser was shooting at her on top of his tent. This always happens it seems, and it is nearly always a player level 150 or above. I kept giving the thumbs down/angry emote but the tool didn’t catch on. I could tell with 16 mins left we weren’t going to kill her. Sadly, she landed with about 30 secs left. She was below 10% of her health when the timer ended and she flew off and we failed.
---
If you are close to 1000 scrip and are still grinding away to level 50. Buy modules. You'll need them at some point.
---
You would think they would. I gave up and swapped out my Red Rocket bar pieces for Slocum’s Joe bar pieces just for the snapping.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/PAaAfzN
---
For those of you wondering, that's what op is talking about
---
Thank you for this! I'm a shotgun build but I've been working on getting all the melee perks so i can switch it up every now and then and the deathclaw gauntlet is my favorite non gun weapon. I'll have to get those unarmed perks now.
---
If I don't shoot her then I watch her just fly back to the nuke zone and the event fails.
---
It's just there so you can track your time played. I don't think they expect anyone (most players anyways) to actually achive that amount. Why not 760? They don't want to give too much free atoms.
---
So here’s the scam: they do snap, but they only snap to the vendor, the vendor doesn’t snap to them. Took about 30 minutes of micro adjustments to set mine just right.
---
48, it seems I am right on track compared to everyone else that plays daily.
---
so true. I submitted a few support tickets and will continue until they think of this like "oh this one's so annoying, let's do something to just stop the tickets". I mean it's so damn easy to make traps not trigger on players why not just do it. this alone can greatly improve the experience for other people. it's doesn't even require much work.
---
Me too man me too...I also feel lonely these days.
---
I would love the nuka water pistol from nukaworld in the game. Then I probably wouldn't drink them.
---
Well I’m amongst the people who make what I need which is the most logical fix to the situation? Why can’t anyone understand that gun powder is a misc for a reason? Lmao
---
Right after pressing start to enter the game menu
---
As far as I know it is not at any vendors but there are a few places it spawns in the world that you can use to loot it. check the map [https://map76.com](https://map76.com) and search for daddyo (no space). it shoyulkd highlight all the places on the map that it spawns naturally.
---
Every country went through child labor as they got their shit together.  Some countries were a lot better at getting their shit together than others.
---
Good Lord, that's one hell of a glitch! Man, I am sorry to hear it! Holy crap! I can't believe you're not screaming into the void yet.
---
Can't agree more
---
It may have been awhile since you were low level but bear in mind if you don't do enough damage to SBQ then you do not receive the flux or repair kits. You'll only get the 2 star combat armor piece if you don't breach the damage threshold.
---
Have you tried loading a different online game and sign in to it and then close that game and relaunch fallout? 
---
That works a lot of the time when this issue occurs.
---
Pls no ban he.
---
The 50cal MG does this with tons of PA. Its a joke. Whoever tested it only plays in 3rd POV.
---
That's not how it works.
---
If you've already got the RR snapped to the vending machine, just swap out the bar pieces one at a time.
---
It's okay, there is a trophy for that.
---
It does suck, I just reached 3000 hours &amp; no reward for my stupidity
---
It's on Bethesda's FO76 website.
---
Maybe "SS helmets" isn't the best choice of words.
---
I don't, I had built the Red Rocket bar before getting the vending machine.
---
Grab a bow and use some flame arrows. 
---
Has worked for me when a duper is using his brand new explosive gatling plasma
---
Hey I live in an old coal town on top of a hill in West "By Golly" Virginia!  A lot of the houses are sears houses.
---
Y'all gotta chill. There is a small number of community mangers and every time they come here they just getting different things lobbed at them, which has been mention atlsest twice in the past 10 days. And by the way u/Ladydevann talks she has experienced and most definitely said something about it
---
Based on the way you asked even if they lost all their items they are going to say that they got to keep them just to piss you off.
---
IMO.
---
I know what you mean, I had to find a 10mm to use in events so I don’t one shot everything and look like a jerk.
---
Yea I always skipped the crystal until realized it is needed to build quite a few things, now I grab a few as I farm lead.
---
From what i've seen the inventories have been left untouched 
---
for some reason
---
AHHH! Jebus Cripes I just had secret Nazi level of Doom flashbacks....where's the Cyberdemon.....
---
Any tips on learning to aim?
---
what your post should say "dear Bethesda make helmets have stats, you did it with the quest reward mask that you updated and removed the stats and their legendary status. so we know you have the ability."
---
40mm have a better exchange rate in weight to ammo points in the converter. 
---
Cannonballs are half the weight of missiles.
---
I ended up with extra weapons
---
that "cheating duper garbage" will be the the reason why you will obtain rare items in this game when u reach high level. Otherwise RNG will be fucking you over thousands of hours
---
Jebus, which of the Fallout Gods did you anger!
---
The flux and repair kits come from completing the scorched earth event, not from reaching the damage threshold required for a drop (this is my understanding as I have been at the ass end of not getting drops before, but still get SE rewards). Do you have a source for this so I can edit the post? Otherwise I can waste a queen kill dicking off and test it, but I won't be able to for several hours.
---
This is a good point, but if they've kept them I'm done with this game
---
I refuse to play a game that allows cheaters to get away with whatever they want
---
Yeah I had a feeling that would happen. I guess wearing a clown hat with it is only fitting for how much of a joke these rewards are. I bet when it's over, they'll sell us the helmet in the atomic shop. I know people don't want to hear it but the truth is, this game is slipping more and more into mobile game territory.
---
Most likely. It's a people problem I guess. When duping got fixed I got griefed a few times when I was a low lvl by a high lvl jerk. I mean this is so sad that a high lvl person needs to engage PvP with a new player to insta kill them and get their junk (yep, on lvl 30 got killed by lvl 125 and both times by the same person and both times the junk was taken). Some people just let it out in game because they're too much of cowards to solve their problems IRL. Now this passive-aggressive shit with camps.
---
Don’t forget shielded casual under armor for +3 INT.
---
A simple solution would be to make CAMPS like public event zones, where if you die, you don't lose your junk. That way people can be creative and make trap camps, but there is no real loss for victims. People can still get the thrill of tricking others, but without all the frustration that comes as the victim. Best of both worlds IMO.
---
If that's the case I guess I'm done with this game
---
The ZAX-Men, if you will.
---
is the recorded world record for groups wanting to be remembered for doing so. ive seen her one shotted by Aholes
---
I would have liked to see it everytime you hit a 76 number.   
---
76, 176. 276, 376, 476 ........   
---
That way people would feel rewarded for their time.   
---
Also with the way it is now. I think they should offer 7600 atoms for 7600 hours of play. I have played everyday this year for 2-3 hours a day (sometimes more)  and i only have 760 something hour i think.
---
While this is a hot topic - are the wood, scout and marine ghille skins ever going to be able to be used in nuclear winter?
---
You're suggesting FO4 and 76 came out within 2 months of each other? That's off by about 34 months.
---
I'm already high level and got my shit the legit way, so yeah those people are garbage and should have had a their characters completely deleted
---
Just another 2+ years and you can have 20 atoms!!!
---
Well, if you get armor in NW, it's handy that you can have the skin for that armor and don't have to dump your Ghillie suit.
---
Well that's awful
---
during the last i encountered hordes of glowing ones while playing in well organised double group of eight. there where sometimes one glowing one with a lighter, more cold and light blueish shade of green, not that deep rich green of the others. thought this would something special, but was always some "normal" glowing one. so theres possible a modell available which could fill the role of a TRUE glowing one in my opinion...
---
Ammo converter is garbage
---
🤣🤣
---
I always find it and it doesn’t lead me anywhere, it just follows me... creepily.. idk why tho. It’s supposed to lead you to a tree stump
---
Where is it?
---
I was taking this seriously until you said that PvPers are psychopaths and deserve to be banned. 😂
---
Yeah. I have a healthy dose of disbelief towards cheaters. I mean they were literally blaming everyone but themselves. But i also think they might have kept items.
---
I also wonder if Bethesda is setting a trap. God that would be awesome.
---
yeah, I should redirect it on like 90% godroll weapons in this game, not on you
---
I cracked up when I saw first person view.  This game is worth playing just for the hilarious defects!
---
It’s just away yo track your hours played and some humor.
---
Short sighted
---
Open up the map.  Click on a point you want to fast travel to.  Instead of taking you to the fast travel point, the map closes and you're still standing in the same spot.  So you open the map back up,  pick fast travel point - map closes again.  You end up repeating this over and over again until the fast travel finally works. 
---
During the rage inducing madness that occurs while you're trying to fast travel you might also try all kinds of superstitious remedies.  You run a few feet away and try again, you look in different directions, you jump, you crouch, you try clicking slower on the map or on a different fast travel point.  
---
Nothing really works except repeating the process until it works.  
---
There's also another similar bug related to being near a hostile mob.  You know how the timer pops up and starts counting down when you're near an enemy?  Well in the other bug, the timer pops up and then immediately closes - so there's no countdown... It just goes away and you have to open up the map again, click fast travel point, the map closes,  the timer pops up and disappears immediately so you end up having to run out of the area before you can fast travel.  Oftentimes this means exiting a building before you can fast travel. Not as maddening as the first bug but still a p.i.t.a.
---
HORDES of twitching, moving, scrawling little ghoulies.....
---
- DO NOT STAND on the fences or on top of camps. If her body clips with a fence, she will almost always take off again. 
---
she will land to fight means whe will land and will fight.
---
as for "clips with fence" i saw her instant taking off at open space so maybe something else triggers that but idk how this mechanic works.
---
too much words, my friend.
---
But they got a final warning though!!!!1111!
---
I do agree that the RNG is terrible
---
But if people want it to be different they should lobby for Bethesda to change the loot systems
---
Under no circumstances should cheating be rewarded as it has been
---
I was banned for duping for a fortnight.
---
I just got unbanned, and found I'd been given a full set of Unyielding BOS Heavy Combat Armor, a Furious The Fixer FFR, and a free years' FO1st.
---
&gt;!Of course, I jest. I play PS4, have no odea how to dupe nor would even risk it. I jjst wanted a giggle.!&lt;
---
Yeah. It's a possible compromise that can even be fun for both. The real frustration is losing junk, especially for new players. but then I can already see every second camp being a death trap xD
---
Stop blaming players for Bethesda's horrendous game mechanics.
---
1. If standing on fences and tents effects the queen fight in any way, then that is a problem with Bethesda's game shitty game  design.   Telling people to avoid standing on fences is telling them to use a work around.  The fact that a work around is necessary at all means that the game is broken.  Stop blaming players for what is Bethesda's fault.
---
2. Standing on tents and fences is not  the real problem. The queen isn't landing because crippling perks don't work on her anymore and can't be used to force her to land.  Once again, this is a problem with the game design and not anything that players are doing.
---
Right? What a sack of crap
---
Should have been no warning, zero tolerance for dupers
---
Correct me if I am wrong, but I was looking forward to the combat rifle skin to use on the fixer as they are pretty much the same weapon. I believe I read that you can not use the skin on the fixer now. If so completely disheartening.....
---
I prefer invest the same time gaining XP on normal mode. Nobody is forced to do NW
---
What power armor glitch? Basement of Freddie’s? What???
---
I got the ghillie after about 15 5 minute games lol
---
They really haven’t been that difficult. 
---
Rank up 1 overseer level? Easy play a level 0 alt
---
Deploy camp 3 times? That’s a Free 250 points. 
---
Kill 1 player? Set up an ambush. Moderate difficulty. Does require active participation. 
---
Revive challenge? Spawn with teammates on top of a cliff. 
---
Kill creatures? This one takes some work and maybe a few matches. 
---
Also Blueprint some trapbase things and have fun with it. It doesn’t all have to be about combat.
---
Additional addenda to the bit about standing on tents and fences etc. If you aren't playing a build that has a lot of clout or is squishy make sure you have the escape artist perk and use it to reduce the aggro/threat on you. If the queen isn't targeting you she isn't going to try and land on you.
---
Yes it will, you just have to work on the timing of your jet bursts. I can jump from my roof on the cliffs overlooking whitesprings, and land at the station.
---
West Virginia irl is ass, just warning you. This is the very first fallout game where the post-war world is better than the pre-war one
---
Still looks tasty though !
---
Maybe it needs to prove longer, maybe the water was too hot and killed the yeast?
---
That would be perfect for an evening around the campfire, tearing off chunks of that and dipping it in a tin of dog food
---
They will actually snap, but you can only snap them to the vendors and not the vendor to the bar. Same with the actual Slocum’s bar sets. It’s very picky, and you may need to fin angle floor pieces around to get them lined up properly, but with some patience it can be done.
---
It does, though it has been some considerable time since I last used a jet pack so I'm not sure if this is now the standard jetpack or a unique variant for the T-65.
---
It looks cleaner, has additional venting and there's a hefty looking pipe instead of backplate in the centre.
---

---
Now I'm gonna fire a nuke there
---
sounds legit, the ability would be a result of an ongoing ghoulish evolution... maybe those OLD ones regain a certain part of their mind, becoming even more dangerous by being more intelligent and able to rally other weaker ghouls around them.... maybe even turn victims into new ghouls....
---
Sounds like they did keep them
---
I understand the RNG is terrible, but if they want it to change they should lobby Bethesda to change the loot systems
---
You load 16 legendaries, what do you get?
---
150 scrip.
---
Yeah I know they come from completing the quest but I wasn't getting them unless I got loot from the queen. My only source is personal experience when I was lower level. I started playing after wastelanders dropped if that makes any difference.
---
I'll go drop a nuke to test, stand around, and see what happens. I'll give it a shot right now ;)
---
Server hopping for killing infinite supermutants at west tek can be considered an exploit. Hiding in a bush for an entire game in NW can be considered an exploit. "Work smart, not hard". In-game mechanics being exploited for a specific reason. Every game has a workaround to make things a little bit easier using features of the game itself. This in no way is bannable nor considered a ToS violation. They aren't using a glitch or a bug or (not even close) a third party to take advantage from other players. 
---
On the other hand you have item duplication glitches, god mode glitches, grenade trap xp glitch (from beta), and so on.
---
It’s the same model from the FO4 Creation Club series of the armor, with an “updated” texture. Same modeling bugs apply, and it’s absolutely ridiculous.
---
Fasnacht donuts. 
---
Sunshine oil
---
This is one of the biggest problems with Fallout 76 and 4. Non-hostile NPCs talk way too fucking much
---
My problem with this is new player using punji boards not knowing better. An opportunity for griefers and the new player lose his camp and maybe interest in the game.
---
Nope still running around with all my goodies 😋
---
I forgot about the donut I think I still have one, if not i can make one. Thanks
---
She can be shoot in air to agro her but when you see you have her attention then stop then she will land
---
I think the Wendigo Colossus took the place of that
---
You’ll be able to adjust convert 10x or 100x and hold way more of the currency, the trade values were already fair it just means you’ll be able to make a couple of 1000 50.cal rounds with it in seconds rather than an hour. 
---
Any more cunty responses?
---
Your understanding is correct to my experience as well, 
---
2 Types of reward, SBQ Corpse drops, and Scorched Earth Event reward, squatting in a bush in the event area will get you the 2nd, damage threshold on the Queen the first
---
That's just ridiculous
---
People like you ruin everything lmao
---
Could not agree more. As of right now it's a 0 risk strategy. Either make hazards not harm not hostile players or give them at least the possibility to seek revenge.
---
So make it punji boards don't effect players. Simple as.
---
Red dress and nw lasers for everyone cause when everyone is super no one is
---
I love this! I originally heard about it through Angry Turtle and the news of completions for all platforms is great news!
---
The followers of Todd, the Toddites
---
Would missile launchers be a good thing to scrap?
---
You should really learn how buffs work, it'll change your ife
---
This is still true of poor american cities/towns today. Underfunded both because people don't care about the kids who attend them and because when people are stupid its easier to trick them into voting against their own interests.  Like telling them paying more taxes is bad (except for when it's going towards the military budget), even though those taxes could go towards improving their children's education. The cycle of poverty is a really depressing issue.
---
Exactly, destroying everything legitimate players have put in time and effort for, all because people are too damn lazy to do it legitimately
---
This is confirmation the devs don’t play the game. 
---
I was skeptical before, but come on
---
I'll update the thread to reflect your testing when you have your results, and attempt to corroborate it myself as well. Keep me posted please
---
Seems like the textures could use some work too. It’s not bad looking, just seems a lot flatter and fewer details than past versions. I could also just be used to looking at fan art more than the real thing by now
---
It’s because everyone is sitting on their unused ammo waiting for the converter update next month
---
Pemmican and Halloween Candy
---
Try that.
---
Thanks for saving me the trouble of grinding for the Bullion for this ! I'll wait for further reports down the line to see if it gets more consistent.
---
Edit: (freddy’s fear house)go into the basement, power armour walk though wall glitch... (YouTube it) works on console (I play PS4) alternatively you can also glitch though the vault 79 front door same outcome.
---
Pemmican? (not sure of displayable, Or if I just remember the pipboy image)
---
Lol no. How is it a bad thing? Everyone says this, but no one has a reason why. The economy is shit with currency limits, rng in this game is awful. End game content is grind for rng, or grind. 
---
I've played this game two months now and the rng grind for better gear is the definition of bullshit. If people want  to bypass that, then more power to them. It doesn't effect you or me, unless it's a gun shooting mini nukes.
---
I've been trying for a looong while.  I got one lvl4 radstag a couple months ago.  Nothing since then. NOTHING.
---
Could then be related to the 'Cannot fast travel why taking damage' i.e. from thirst or starvation.
---
Yes I do not think it is worth running as a full-time perk because of how slowly PA breaks as you mentioned.
---
Why are you even crafting solar armor with a low health build?
---
Get an auto Tesla and tag mobs. Level up.
---
I know it's soooo *hard* to get an NW Lazer legitimately :( 
---
My nuka quantum paddle ball wants to say hello too 
---
Too bad I gave out all these items to anyone that came out of the vault :p
---
You can’t use the ghillie armour skins in NW right? As far as I’m aware
---
Lemonade doesn't spoil, if you're including drinks.
---
Other than that, the only things I can think of off the top of my head are ionized meat and royal jelly.
---
Longshoreman outfit, clean spacesuit and helmet, clean straight jacket and cuckoo clock and nuka cola clock plans.
---
Only use the perk when you need to repair your PA. I think i repaired one piece of my PA like 6-7 weeks ago. And i live in it.
---
I'm on console (PS4) so I figured there was no way anything third-party was involved and it had to be game mechanics somehow. But as you mention, the game mechanics themselves can be exploited to bring things into the world that shouldn't be, or to bypass normal XP bounds and is certainly something folks have gotten in trouble for.
---
I'm certainly guilty of server hopping to find the item or enemy I'm looking for, but really hadn't considered that outside of the norm for gameplay... With the legendary run going on it's certainly tempting to take advantage of the XP boost this event can give. I guess we'll see what the next patch brings and go from there.
---
The way they bait you by having it happen infrequently enough that it catches you totally off guard.
---
Or please add damage resistance back to the helmets
---
I used to run with it for a while, but then I realized how slow PA breaks and spent the points on something else. It's really not needed. I use my PA all the time and maybe I have to repair a piece every 3-4 weeks. Then I put it on for the repair, along with Fix It Good to get it to 200%, and it's ages until next time it needs repair.
---
when I came in here I just wanted a drink
---
eh still more fallout than pristine camp walls and mascot outfits
---
The NW lasers, like legacies, should have been removed from the game in the first place
---
But the red asylum dress? You screwed everyone who put in the time searching the Asylum, because others were too lazy to do it themselves
---
A few patches ago they introduced the *Fast Travel cool down timer* if enemies are near or in combat, from that point fast travel became a real pain for me as a low health build with Healing Factor mutation.
---
Ok is this a bug or something Beth put in if you get to much exp at once? 
---
When ever someone does the clustering of scorched an I’m using my blooded Tesla the first few waves are fine. then I just stop getting exp with that weapon an have to switch to something else any one else have that happen?
---
Thanks for the idea, I just editing the original post to mention that I'll have a 2nd display for drinks. I wish lemonade had a more unique/pretty visual rendering, cuz I'd use that or hard lemonade.
---
We ended up server hopping a few times and it was never fixed, but we were able to start a public casual team and join that! We'll try again today and see if the issue has been resolved at all. Thanks for the input y'all!
---
I've been using a level 40 auto Tesla that I crafted and it seems to work just fine for tagging a bunch of them when it happens.
---
You're not wrong unfortunately, it only works on the combat rifle.
---
I'm just glad the jangles backpack is decent, even the stupid spike on it's helmet is covered by my jetpack which was a nice touch.
---
All this BUT....it must be a SCOPED GUN. I have tried with unscoped and it has never worked.
---
Only about half way done. Im overjoyed to have scrap kits ill never ever use, and some fireworks ill never ever use. Oh and armor and weapon skins ill never ever use. 
---
Who wouldnt want to give up thousands of atoms to pirchase items we really would use and want for this amazing array of utter garbage. 
---
Sorry still very salty over this change.
---
Looks good!
---
What kind of buffs? Like food and stuff? I don't like how a lot of that stuff spoils.
---
The Secret Service honestly looks better in my opinion then again I don't judge because everybody has their own personal opinion.
---
Berserker gang rise up
---
Dont forget to check out helvita! Its reaaal
---
Mostly I've been seeing them use rocket launchers grenades or grenade launchers and only occasionally using guns with the explosive legendary effect.  So unless you're Johnny on the spot with your arrow, their dead before your shot gets there. 🤷‍♂️
---
Again, it doesn't affect me one way or the other, I'm just there for the treasury notes so if you want to kill everything while I surf facebook more power to yah, yell if you need help.  I just feel bad for the low levels that show up to do the event properly and get nothing but the completion xp.
---
Edited because I cant type to save my life this morning.
---
I wouldn't mind the SCORE ghillie skins if they were as good as the NW one and in fact I was really looking forward to them but they're too damn shiny and saturated.  Don't match the NW skins and don't blend well with the world foliage.
---
it seems like an improvement from not being able to travel at all with enemies nearby
---
Yeah that’s what I was thinking. I’m doing a PA heavy/explosives and was thinking on putting the points in Demo expert (I also have some explosive legendaries)
---
No, I've gathered as much playing the game, I'm more curious about its origins. Like literally just - what *is* a ghillie? xD
---
Oh I thought I'm too nervous as it continuosly pissed me off a few times blocking my view in the middle of a tough fight. This is indeed very inconvenient, legendary items and score alerts are the worst as they're most frequent, quest ones are a bit less annoying but also could be moved somewhere else from the centre of the screen.
---
Same
---
What doom?  The only doom I've played was 2016 and I don't remember any nazi's, but they may have just not been in that game.
---
Good thanks. I can put those points somewhere else like Demo expert. (Heavy/explosive PA build)
---
They are like some nightmarish kids programme that you have nightmares about.
---
The pop up notification is the same if not close to the 'Server is not responding' pop up sound, and gives me a pause every time it occurs.
---
I'll be ok with running faster, if that's easier to implement
---
I levelled a new character pretty fast by claiming and defending workshops in the forest.
---
Edit: u can’t craft anything above your level.
---
I'm running around with an ultracite jetpack arm on my t-65, it does look like the old model jetpacks.
---
I screwed everyone? 😂 I *"shared"* mines with everyone
---
Pemmican could be a good one, thanks! Display wise it looks kinda link barfood
---
But it´s less of an accomplishment if Joe Dupe is handing them out to everyone.  It´s like if a part of society just always counterfeited money, as much as they want. And then you are there with your hard earned paycheck, and calls out the counter fitters. And they answer "Well working hard for your paycheck is great, just keep doing that, my counter fitting is my issue."
---
"everyone who put in the time"
---
Learn to read
---
didn't want to get downvoted again, clearly
---
Dam. Thank you for confirming.  Appreciate it.
---
Yeah I didn’t realize how slowly it breaks. Which is good when I was in normal armor I felt I had to repair the pieces like 3 times a session. With PA I’m lucky to repair one piece a week, Hahahaha. Then if I repair it to 200%...just don’t have to think about it.
---
NICE
---
I have a power switch on the back and lock the door. If some1 happens upon it by exploring usually its fully loaded in and they dont have access
---
I got it after grinding my eyes out back when there was a time limit. Then I just paid to win the seasons pass 😈 so done
---
So what if the sides collapsed it now looks like a mushroom cloud :)
---
With Bethesdas track record it will probably delayed
---
I just didn't want to spoil it.  If you want you can Google it.  Its best for ballistic and energy damage and second best at 94% of max for radiation, but it takes almost literally a month due to soft locks to acquire.
---

---
you have to wait until the flush finishes, try again
---
It's a good idea, definitely fits the barfood image I'm going for. Thanks!
---
Expanding on the point posted above, I think there is a misconception about the fences and tents. You’re fine there if you’re in caution or hidden but was soon as you pop to danger, get out in the field, get loud and try to draw her attention. Especially if you’re doing big damage.
---
If you’re in danger and you’re on top of something, that’s when you’re screwing up the fight.  Talking to you, level 60’s in excavator standing on top of v9 or piled onto tents firing aimlessly in the air.
---
Yeah, the quest one isn't quite so bad, although I'd prefer if it were smaller. Some of the icons are pretty big, but the text is alright.
---
Wish we had the FO4 DEF_UI mod.
---
Yeah, probably.  I'm just really into history.  But given that sort of thing it might not be the best.
---
Traps in camps should not harm players. That would solve the problem with that. I don’t see why you can hurt other players with traps, but you cannot use weapons to hurt players unless locked into PvP. I don’t go to peoples camps for the annoying traps. It’s one reason why I put on the perk to stealth through without triggering traps in case of a troll camp.
---
No, I dont.  I know they mean secret service, I just forget the exact word and schutzstaffel always pops into my head.
---
It's only worth using when repair time comes as PA degrades fairly slowly. Even without the perk active you'll only find yourself thinking of repairs once in a blue moon, especially if you've got the pieces starting at 200%.
---
Better to be running stuff like Power User and Batteries Included if you're a full time PA user.
---
Why not add in different types of missiles. For instance a pulse missile,cryogenic missile,fire missile,HalluciGen missile,plasma missile,nuclear missile 
---
Would add more versatility to the weapon system and be more powerful than their, hand grenade version. The nuclear missile one would more of in between of the nuka grenade and the mini nuke for damage. Yet it would have longer range than the fatman. Ammo weight would roughly stay the same for the most part
---
Foods chems bobbles drinks etc.   Also having your build right is key.  A bloodied melee with a meat hook can do 15k damage per hit
---
Fuck em both keep the gold for yourself, it only takes 500 rep from the one u screw over
---
I sometimes forget coal mining (or general mining) history isn't as strongly embedded in most cultures.
---
I'm not from America. I come from Wales which has a very strong history with mining. One quite different from the American one displayed here, but similar enough where the context of the song and WV culture makes natural sense.
---
But, yeah... It never occured to me that that stuff would go over a lot of people's heads.
---
and who said I have low health build?
---
&gt;*u sCreW EvErYwAn dEy pUt tImE inTo iT*
---
But yet I made it easy by just *sharing* it :p with a little cost of 0 to 500 caps since the dress wasn't much to buy back compared to legacies
---
Indeed. Or only effective while on PvP for those who cares.
---
Oh gotcha. It's a military thing. Soldiers that are going long range over watch wear them so they can blend into the area. There's several different kinds, from shirts and pants with strings to look like bushes, to cloaks with hoods. 
---
They are pretty pricey if you get a good looking one.
---
The fact you're posting this,seems to indicate you actually feel guilty or rather need some kind of approval.
---
You wouldn't have posted it ,if you didn't have any doubt.
---
Personally,do what you want with your atoms and your money.
---
Yeah, that seems insane then 200 more carry capacity!
---
Thanks for the answer and Yeah. I’m moving special points around then getting the perks after. I have full batteries included but only rank 2 of Power User.
---
Have you tried to submit a ticket/feedback? I'm gonna try to do it, if more people will talk about the same problem there's a bigger chance they'll pay attention to it.
---
Can't really say anything about FO4 UI, it's been ages since I played it.
---
Interesting. All I do is join a public team when I join a server and I always share *Strange in numbers,* then just play the game. Try and launch 3 nukes each session, join in on events, emote legendries to share if they appear.
---
Not sure what I could be doing wrong, I have no mic so can't talk to people and upset them somehow 🤷‍♂️
---
Drowning in sugar now! Tryna knock out the Tadpole Cooking badge. Wish I had been collecting Sugar/Spice/Salt/Pepper before as they don't spoil (thanks for the thing :)
---
And made every legitimate one that people already owned worthless, because you're garbage
---
i like it as a perk con for using them in NW(cant be first person with the .50 cal unless im aiming? challenge accepted otherwise i am become bush)
---
I seem to get experience on every round, but haven't tracked how much was being given at each round. I just use a regular Tesla though, not Legendary.
---
&gt; How do I reliably level up? All quest which I've found and are still active for me are in areas too high level for me. Do I do it old school mmorpg style like killing 1000 creatures? 
---
Join a public group either for int if you're gonna be killing or solo questing or join event groups to spam events for levels and extra loots.
---
Me and my friends had farmed 5.56 ammo for months before the display case dupe. 5.56 was the currency used in high end gear trades. Over night our months of trading and scavenging for 5.56 was made worthless. So we had a lot of bullets that were worthless other then for shooting.
---
I run the chinese stealth armor and the high capacity backpack and have like a 140 ballistic and 110 energy it just depends on your build but I dont have any issues unless I get surrounded but that doesnt happen much
---
A good bloodied commando can do 600+ per hit
---
You need the gunsmith perks to be able to create the weapon plans that you found / buy.
---
That's what I figured.  My plan was to nuke ws today so I can get that stuff for all the daisies I picked yesterday.
---
Your behind go read thru yesterdays post yeah they didn't delete anything
---
I’m loving my explosion build. A 40mm grenade launcher fully tricked out with all the perks and drugs almost one-shots a glowing beefy boye in Whitesprings.
---
Click, click, boom!
---
&gt; How do I reliably level up? All quest which I've found and are still active for me are in areas too high level for me. 
---
explore and discover locations in the forest and do events that proc there..
---
since youre already level 20 you can probably start sneaking north into the toxic valley to discover locations and do events there as well..
---
it shouldnt be long before youre ready to start heading south into the ash heap to discover locations and do the events there...
---
once youre comfortable in those locations, have unlocked some better perks(aka leveled up a bit more) and hopefully acquired some mediocre legendary gear..
---
then you can begin to pursue quests, events and discovering locations in the savage divide and eastward with a little confidence that youre not going to get your ass handed to you every 3 minutes..
---
I hit 78 of 79 yesterday.
---
If it's **worthless** mind donating it to me? 🤔 Or if it's trash now throw it in the trash... After I'm a *trashcan*
---
So uhhh did i miss news?
---
When did they say they would use 4th or 5th star on legendarys?
---
Cause I think I'm at like, 18, but I can pretty much do every challenge every day and all the weekly challenges.
---
I can see your point of view but from mine I play this game for my own enjoyment and gratification. It doesn’t change my game experience at all. Granted, I spend a majority of my time on my private server because I chose to get a 1st membership. I have several of the rare outfits and plans from constantly grinding events and going to the places they spawn. If I come across someone who’s been looking for something I have, if it’s not something I actually use I’m more than happy to give it to them. Why is that wrong?
---
Got no friendos that play 76. Figure I'll get it eventually through events like Encryptid and Project Paradise. Randomly got the "Revive player in water" in Paradise for Tadpole badge last week, which was nice
---
I do that too for stimpaks. The other low numbers are for weapons and explosives. I'm rolling a stealth hunter build. Boring but safe. Like my life.
---
I don’t disagree with your point about the punishment for duper’s not being enough, they should have all their items wiped, however.
---
You’re throwing a little tantrum, if your not going to play the game anymore that’s fine you’re welcome to leave but you may as well leave this reddit as well, little pointless if you’re not playing the game.
---
I have the strongest feeling you’ll have your little Winge and you won’t be leaving the game.
---
Yeah I'm seeing that now, I'm done with 76
---
Why should anyone who doesn't want to cheat play this game when people can make all of their efforts completely worthless with no punishment?
---
Because players would get offended if the devs just came out and said "Haha, f%$k you"?
---
The fact you failed is laughable. You can solo this event as a competent level 100 easily. Turn on JUKEBOX , PROTECT JUKEBOX. WIN. 
---
The hell are you doing on the drums?
---
I like the idea of having to make ammo. Makes me feel more survival like and keeps me exploring.
---
So I can't read.  It was like 1:30 am.
---
I keep chugging Nord Mead expecting to get bottle caps. And it’s also fun that the lockpicking sounds are identical in Skyrim and Fallout, not to mention the Mr. Handy/ Nick Valentine voice actor literally around every corner.
---
I still have everything, but after playing other games for 2 weeks I’m no longer blind to how completely fucked up this game is. I’m out. I’ll dump my money into stalker 2 when it comes out.
---
Yeah I was doing 1000 with bloodied unarmed... But then it's no good if it's in the air all the time!
---
Oh I wish I had a chance to visit these places as well. I live too far and even after covid madness is over there's little chance I'll ever be able to come :c But I'm glad someone can and their life got closer to their dream. Hope your life there will be what you expect it to be :)
---
They'll be so rich, I'm jealous.
---
I came here to say this. It’s like joining a nuclear winter match and complaining the rank 10s are bush wookieing the whole time. 
---
It takes a while and a little effort to find people to play with like you do.
---
You think you got it bad? I had to listen to Rose for at least a week every time I logged in before I finished her tedious questline.
---
"Why am I at Drop Site V9 in Confederate uniform armed only with black powder pistols and rifles and a Revolutionary sword?"
---
More awareness of player demand is not a bad thing. That’s actually part of business. Just because some consumers mention what they want, doesn’t mean others are not allowed to mention the same thing. Supply and demand.
---
Wait. We have to repair power armor? I dont think ive had to repair mine at all this month and I cant remember the last time I actually did.
---
The timer adjustment really screwed this event up. I played it last night, for the first time in a long time. And it was only successful because people actually knew what they were doing. Myself and another sniper covering the back door, and two others playing instruments. And a 5th player assisting between the two jobs.
---
Interesting. I'll have to give that a try. Burn through a bunch of Rad Chems/Stims doing it? Usually only keep 20 of each on me
---
Imagine the players with trap camps and they put their mat in the kill room for whenever someone spawns in, that probably why this will never happen and I think that's fair enough
---
I will be leaving this sub in 35 minutes, I already decided that
---
I'm finishing the legendary run, in case they ever do remove the dupers I want the fireplace door
---
Other than that yeah I'm done, why should anyone who doesn't want to cheat play this game when people can reduce all of their efforts to worthlessness with no punishment?
---
Then there is me with almost 2k of 10mm ammo not selling at all.
---
I do have it maxed out.
---
To get to 100 now, doing only daily/weekly, you would need to be 50-60+. If you look at some of the previous posts about TLR, there's a calendar with the recommended levels broken out by time.
---
100% my problem with them giving out this skin via the S.C.O.R.E system is that I had to grind my ASS off in a mode that not many people like for this suit. Meanwhile people can easily attain the same thing so much easier in a mode we all like.
---
Yes. https://youtu.be/TwPfgVOt3k0 the record is acutally 2 seconds now, same group. They beat their own time.
---
I don't have one lmao, and now I can't even buy one because it will be duped
---
Two thumbs the fuck up
---
yes absolutely. unless you have a good legendary one, they are dead weight. same with fatmans.
---
Why are you playing drums? Every time i do it everyone is fighting for The kills seeing a bunch of angry emotes course someone is on rhe roof oneshotting everything
---
Is that what i said??? or you didn't get it?   
---
Give stuff to people all you want, but don't dupe and give (:
---
Welp, there goes the under the map Slocum’s Joe I was building. Thanks
---
I couldn’t imagine a bigger waste of money than paying to get through the pass lol there are only like 4 things worth getting and 3 of them are in the first 30 levels, I hope the next season is better and actually has a theme.
---
Cheating/hacking/intentional bug exploitation in PvP should be a permaban in any serious MMO.
---
Yes, just before posting this.
---
Props to Bethesda's QC dept. These highly trained professionals really go the extra mile.
---
There we go, let's make it a trend.
---
Lol for me if I want to go to my CAMP for free it won't let me fast travel. But if I pay the caps to go to Charleston station (literally right next to my camp) it will fast travel. It's quite annoying.
---
That random email from a dupe community said something about removing the duped items and resetting the xp.i would have no idea if its real or not.bethesda would honestly have no incentive to unban a acct and leave all the duped items
---
A valid point. Then this last dupe came along and made that gear you were looking for a lot more obtainable. This game is very cyclical. Dupes come and go. The value of trade items always fluctuates. There’s always some hot thing that everyone has to have. Personally, I’ve never understood the draw of Fixers. I have one, and I still use my handmade most of the time. If you’re on PS4 look me up. If you still have the 5.56 I’d be willing to trade for some.
---
Seems like you answered your own question....
---
Oh, this is one of the ORIGINAL Doom's, back when it was pixelated perfection! Have a [gander!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Ni-a2dels)

---
Yes!
---
I was just thinking something similar the other day, that it would be nice if the Born Survivor perk automatically injected MedX in addition to stimpaks, like the stealth suit from NV.
---
Combine the ideas for a revamp of born survivor to be rank 1 auto stim, rank 2 auto stim + base chem of choice (medx, buffout, psycho, mentats), rank 3 auto stim + specialty drug of choice (berry mentats, psychobuff, fury, skeeto spit, etc.)
---
Aye, skulls for the skull throne!
---
*gasps* FLEE!
---
I have to agree with t_roose. The hell were you guys doing lol. I can solo this event with 5 to 6 minutes to spare. Imo it’s one of the best events due to easy notes and lots of ghouls.
---
People need to stop being paranoid about getting a hit on legendaries. There are plenty in the world to not care.
---
This is bullshit. There are zero consequences for cheating in this game, so why not just let everyone dupe/exploit to get what they want? Screw it.
---
It's still a form of milk either way ;) one just has more protein and is salty-sweet.
---
Because I learned that Building Teams aren't for building... They give an Int bonus so people use them for +exp.
---
I've only been got one time by a trap camp and it was one of the lame ones where the guy actually had to be there to set off the flame traps.   Waited in stealth for him to leave ( I believe it was uranium fever event) then I destroyed everything in his camp with explosive bait killed his tamed deathclaw and left a you have been insulted note on his door step. I pride myself on being a nice guy in this game but things like this I dont let slide
---
It's totally an hacked in weapon. Don't get mad for a potential ban if you want to keep it. It won't happen ,but you never know when they'll finally decide to cleanse those weapons and their users from the game.
---
You can tell by the downvotes you're receiving that there are quite a few cheaters here. It's why I quit playing and will never come back.
---
But do you have the plans for any weapons.
---
Cause it didnt affect me or you as player and we can still do things
---
You can find flux for a period of time after a blast zone dissipates. When you found it the area had previously been nuked.
---
The hackers are all going to be on PC, but the victims could be on any platform.
---
If you have the rifle plan you should have the option to craft the gun at all available levels lower or equal to yours (1, 5, 10 &amp; 20). 
---
My last character progressed using a lvl15 set of raider power armour with the Tesla torso mod fitted. Running around high level events (like Encrypted and SBQ) tagging mobs with the Tesla mod and generally trying not to die levels you up rapidly!
---
I’m dropping it soon as I’m on again. Don’t want it, don’t need it.
---
Make sure someone is playing instruments or juke box.  I notice a lot of times people are just waiting for others to do it.
---
Makes it tough when you have to make noise so jot one wants too 🙄
---
PA is pretty easy to use.. and people dig the way it looks
---
I must have missed your point. :)
---
Everything must have been *duped* I was duping common weapons cause my friends wanted a copy of my weapon :p 
---
Don't buy from vendors/players
---
It did effect us
---
Literally every single item we own is worthless
---
Would love to know what build you're running where you can solo this event.
---
I mute her everytime I join lol. I started playing 2 weeks ago and got to her quests but I'm only level 24. When I go to the mine shaft to get one of the holotapes everything is like level 50 or 60 and I get fucking wrecked. It's been a nightmare. She's so damn annoying.
---
Most of the screenshots I've seen, show accounts unbanned with just a TOS warning, nothing about removing duped gear, or account wipes.
---
Of course, that's what I mean... why kick someone when their presence is raising your int and if you kick them you lose the buff? I get it with Event teams if you're not helping do events, but not really with a building team where the background buff is the key??
---
TBH I’d prefer this too. Fast traveling when I’m in the same room as an enemy feels cheesy. I get why it’s there but it really tones down the challenge.
---
It's hard to say.  If you leave LITS, and go attack a random enemy somewhere else, it works fine.  But it will never work in that particular instance of LITS again.  My guess is that with so many people attacking the same group of Scorched, something about the Tesla Rifle's logic gets screwed up.  But why it should be screwed up for just that event is suspicious.
---
I only do it on my Heavy Gunner Account because of the perk.
---
Yeah, no player specific cooldown, I only mentioned this method because its what I use to farm backpack and flag plans.
---
Bruh!I solo this event all the time.for a low level I could see it being difficult. Just keep that jukebox repaired and playing..I like to use my hardest hitting rifle in sneak with the right perks I shot maybe 2 shot everything.you just need 1 person focused as long as they dont turn the music off
---
I reached 100. The double xp weekend with lunchboxes on top was nuts.
---
Not buying from vendors and players cuts out a huge part of the game, which I know because I haven't done either since the dupe glitch
---
It syncs with heavy guns pretty well.
---
1. She CAN be staggered. She has a NoStaggerSpell keyword which prevents her from being staggered by SPELLS. The only 2 stagger spells are from Pain Train and the Yao Guai's stagger effect. All other perk card staggers absolutely DO work on her. You can see it happen in the air. She will flip backwards when it happens.
---
2. She is NOT immune to explosive damage. She has a flat 70% damage mitigation spell as well as the NoLimbDamage effect. The explosive portion of explosive legendary weapons is so small compared to base damage that you often don't notice it due to the 70% mitigation. If she was immune to explosive damage, AGLs, missile launchers, and the Fatman would do no damage to her and that's just not true.
---
3. He's not talking about hacked weapons. He's talking about what angry turtle has called 'magic weapons'. There is a list of legendary effects that when on a high rate of fire weapon, cause more damage than they are supposed to due to a bug with the furious effect. For example: a minigun with a limb damage legendary effect will trigger this. Someone with a good build and one of these weapons can take down a queen in seconds if the bug triggers. Beth is aware of the issue and there's been no word on a fix yet.
---
flux stays around after a nuke for a while. Possible there was a nuke round there
---
How? I'm asking if it's true and if it's happened to anyone.
---
well like i said, im newer and since it was under main quests i said it was main
---
Yep, I can't believe how many people duped and are getting their accounts and items back
---
There's no point for a legitimate player to play this game anymore
---
I know this is quite late but is it possibly the "Pipe Gun Automatic Mod"?
---
It’s most useful in Nuclear Winter, where hiding in a bush is a viable strategy. In Adventure Mode it’s just aesthetic since you are dealing with npcs and not humans who could easily miss you hiding in the brush.
---
I don't use rad chems, there is an active decon shower right where you drop off the ore.  If I do get hit too much I'll use a couple of stims, but never more than 3 or 4 during the event unless I'm actively fighting.
---
If you look at your item you will see five stars. Currently we only have access to 3/5 leaving two grayed out.
---
If she's too good for my racecar bed then she can make her own damn CAMP.
---
I usually reload at that moment and let my APS refill.
---
I also have found on other runs that if I were only to shoot her when she landed, she would land on the other side of the building from me and by the time I got over to her she would be up in the air again and I would never get my 1000 damage. Whereas if I am shooting her in the air I can get my 1000 damage from 10 shots. I would hardly say I am wasting ammo. I use about 100 rounds in the entire fight doing about 100 damage with each round. 2-300 when she is landed. 
---
I will shoot her to get aggro. Then reload shoot her a couple times in the face while she is landed then switch to the adds when she takes off. Then once the adds are gone I will switch back to following her and shooting her to get aggro again.
---
My serums arnt and the market recover very fast so these expensive weapons that are cheap now will be expensive again. Unless your referring to your eBay account where you sell for cash then id understand they are useless
---
I figured it was one of the old ones.
---
I played FO4 after Skyrim. Took me awhile to stop internally shouting "shut up, Mercer Frey" when Nick was around.
---
My brother played John Denver ad nauseum when I was younger. I still enjoy it but his playing his albums over and over for years in a row cause PTSD if I hear more than two John Denver songs in a row.
---
A loophole is a poophole, wait, wrong conversation lol.  I laughed way too loudly at the poophole.  😂😂
---
It’s not bringing things into the would that shouldn’t be. All it’s doing is spawning the entire wave at the same spot, which makes it easier to get a hit on all of them rather than having to try and get a tag on everything. 
---
Not to mention heaps of people used the GODMODE glitch and finish the legendary run in the first week, haven’t heard anything about any of them being banned.
---
If you watch Shameless, Frank drinks Nukashine every day.
---
Goodbye
---
for example https://s3.amazonaws.com/dulfy.net/uploads/2018/11/fallout-76-legendary-weapons-guide-2.jpg
---
bethesda has repeatedly stated that we do not have the ability to stagger the queen. the visual you are referring to is from failure to be able to reach a target, basically it means she either failed to lock on or she locked on to someone that is not accessible to her.
---
I only use it during SBQ fights for the extra DR from all the trash mobs. I'm not a heavy gunner though.
---
I had a few players on my friends list I trade with that duped and got suspended. They received access to their accounts again yesterday and still had everything they duped. 
---
They received emails stating it was their final warning and any further violations would result in a permanent ban. 
---
So apparently Bethesda is ok with duping as long as you don’t dupe too much? It’s confusing.
---
Have they said that they're going to utilize those traits at all?
---
I mean, you would assume, based on the fact that there are extra slots for the fourth and fifth stars, but I wouldn't be entirely surprised if they just weren't ever used.
---
Especially since that would also significantly increase the already pretty tedious grind for that perfect legendary.
---
I had on max power armor, what else do you want me to do?
---
not me thats 1/2 my resources and i see how she looks at my collectertron. so i killed her and threw her body in the creek. ain't no law sayin i can't and nobody gonna miss her.
---
Half way through and I like the perk card packs.  
---
I have a level 50 character that holds all of my spare legendary weapons and armour that I've picked up over a year of playing and it can't move, so no XP to level up perk cards.  I switch over to that character and claim the perk packs.  
---
By the end of the season he should be able to level up a few more weight reducing perk cards and be a more viable character down the road if I decide to play on it.
---
Damn well I guess we will see then.i dont have a preference on that dupe wave I know alot of people got their hands on gear that would be nearly impossible so if true good for the ones that got their stuff back
---
Thank you
---
I have never, and would never, buy or sell an item in any game for real money.
---
They are worthless, because why would I buy a weapon from someone when for all I know they could have another 40 ready to sell
---
Ha no real tips, just practice
---
I solo this event all the time as well, only use shotguns. I can solo it with my alt as well w/a powerfist
---
That's exactly how I feel, or pistol whip someone with a Luger, yes please.
---
ah makes sense, that predates me, I started playing when wastelanders came out. Wish they would let us newer players get a crack at some of the old stuff.
---
Don't forget the 3 "specialty" flavors of Nuka Cola. Nuka Scorched, Nuka Vaccinated, and Nuka My Blood's In It. Each has their own unique labels to match, too.
---
Lmao I guess the trade forums will be restocked with legacy's
---
No i only wanted to know what others Think about it 
---
Dont need that weird Type of flex my friend :) 
---
Im just happy with it :)
---
Some community person said they would pass it along to see if they could make it so it also applies to the fixer, but no one can really tell what will come of that.
---
It’s true. If they were found to have abused the glitch, they were given a final warning.
---
Atoms?  It costs bullion.
---
well aren't you special
---
And it could be that i understand u wrong, my english is really bad
---
Points 1 through 3 are entirely irrelevant. Switch the jukebox on. Defend it. Ignore the instruments. *Switch the jukebox back on when the first song ends.* Defend it again. Continue ignoring the instruments. Kill the Wendigo. Win.
---
The instruments are red herrings. You need several people on them to get the same effect as simply keeping the jukebox running.
---
That was my point of this post. Whoever did that math never factored the many massive XP boosts you can give your character. Sure playing casualy with no buffs at all i can see it taking a long time, but why would you you want to handicap yourself.
---
The only drawback to the arrows is that the flame takes time to work, and if you've got some chump with a grenade launcher or anything else that flings the bodies, they'll escape the flame radius before catching fire.
---
Otherwise, though, yes.  If you have flame arrows, and preferably take that one wooden post so a griefer can't use it, you're pretty much set.  You'll do minimal damage to the Scorched (only 3-6 points), but enough to get credit when someone else kills them.
---
And frankly, if you find yourself in a LITS with a griefer, go and mess with them.  Get in the way of their shots.  Stick a PA frame in front of them.  Jump in front of them.  Or even get them to accidentally initiate PvP.  If you can't have the benefit, neither should they.
---
Yep.  That's understandable.
---
I didn't know you're supposed to follow it.  
---
I thought the encounter was just about a friendly radstag,just like you have that lone survey vertibird every now and then.
---
The stabilized perk for a heavy gunner requires it. It gives a greater accuracy and ignores 45% of armor whilst in power armor
---
Yeah I guess. I don’t know anymore. I’ve given up trying to understand some of Bethesda’s decisions and actions. I just play the game and move on with life.
---
They are very very rare drops. Gz!
---
Guess it's not cool now. :(
---
No not really, just saying that the event isn’t hard to solo
---
that ones probably intentional.
---
Strip clubs are totally a larger waste of money. I frequent those as well (edit) in fact there a tons of ways to blow money 🤟😅
---
Ty
---
It is not :(
---
I've heard something about a final warning email, but haven't seen one yet. Wonder what gets you a final warning and what gets you banned?
---
I don't need ultracite?  I need to make flux.
---
K thx
---
The best reward from the legendary run is the 2500 caps I got the other day to buy an insurgent outfit on my new char lol
---
Power Armor Plasma guy was stationed by the jukebox. Should not the person standing by it turn it on/ repair it?
---
I like the carry weight and the protection it gives me as a melee character.
---
I forgot anout those haha
---
I thought for sure it would be like the other complaints where the camouflage is floating in the air or something. The armor actually looks fantastic third person though.
---
The reason they removed stats from Helmets in the first place was to prevent people from just using what is best and not using whatever the player wanted to use or liked. Look at everyone who had a radical mask, it's all they were wearing.
---
What do you do in nuke zone?
---
I believe that is the case. But same as with AA effects the damage reduction % is multiplicative, not additive. So for example 50+45 is not 95, but 72,5.
---
I honestly wish I could use PA more often...cuz it really does look cool. I carry my Excavator and a few fusion cores on me just in case...but I actually lose carry weight in it....lol. I hoard too much stuff on my person! Pls don’t judge! 😂😂😂
---
I rock the CSA, too.
---
If you run Ironclad 5 and scaly skin, you can get an extra 100 dr and er, since you can't upgrade it.
---
Thanks. I'll def be displaying those too, but probably in my bedroom displays
---
I understand the difference is small but "slightly better" is not "the same."  And if it still has better defense, I want it. Plus I think it looks cool as well as theres nothing else I want to spend gold on.
---
I blew my first 10 fireworks after killing the sbq for celebration. Lasted like 10 seconds whooooweee!  It should have been an emote that throws up the fireworks.
---
I can't wait to see how fan boys bend over backwards to defend the decision to unban people with massively duped inventory.
---
I dont know why would you buy a pack of yugioh cards, magic the gathering, comic, toy , 3d pen. It is cause you want it Mostly others it is because of collecting purposes. 
---
Why would you quit just because some one elses journey is finished , havent you ever heard it isnt the goal at the end but the people you meet along the way
---
I always kind of wondered about the whole "resetting XP" thing.  Some have said that means resetting them to level 1.  My google-fu is failing me, though.  I can't find the exact ban wording.
---
I wonder about the perk cards, though.  Did they revoke all those perk cards, too?  If not, seems like they'd have a huge advantage when legendary perks come out in September, assuming they take the time to power level back to legendary levels.
---
Run 15 agility with all the perks only get detected at the queen, but that's not to often
---
I literally walk around all day pointing at things saying SCRAP SCRAP SCRAP SCRAP and then wondering what combination of building sets I would need to recreate my house.
---
Atoms for a skin,not the PA itself.Read my comment again.
---
Sure, Here you go: [mining helmet colours](http://imgur.com/gallery/VUKXdPU)
---
Edit: deleted the "bug" comment, having 10 mining helmets in my inventory with various colours but the same name messed with my head
---
If you do come, let me know. I'll give you a good fallout tour.
---
Ah thanks. I don’t know what perks are additive or multiplicative.
---
You are probably missing the semi hidden passage if you are only getting 300.  There is a locked door with a keypad with the smugglers stash behind it.  Just down the corridor heading back towards the church area is a passage hidden by hanging vines on the left.  There is a lot of lead nodes in there and a chemistry bench at the end.
---
I farm acid first, then get all of the ore, then smelt it at the chemistry bench. But I have Fallout 1st so I can dump all of the lead in my Fallout 1st box after walking outside.
---
Oh, would one be the forest camo jumpsuit? I got that one from a drop in the same session. Crazy that he got two masks and I got a jumpsuit.
---
Lol. I really was just looking around for a good 30 seconds before I had to open the map.
---
I actually throw out my scrap kits. I have first and there’s pretty much a crafting station everywhere anyway.
---
Sticky note? They would be freacking swimming in sticky note in the office if they did it for everything we tell them.
---
Who knows maybe in 10 years if the world won't end xD Thanks for the offer :)
---
\&gt;Wake up
---
\&gt;Incredibly hungover
---
\&gt;Can't remember what you did on Fallout 76 last night
---
\&gt;Get up
---
\&gt;Stumble to the couch
---
\&gt;Turn on your Xbox
---
\&gt;Load up Fallout 76
---
\&gt;Greeted with a black screen that lasts several seconds
---
\&gt;You hear the grunting of horses and the wheels of a cart
---
"Hey, you're finally awake."
---
Don’t trust people to do a simple job just  like RL. Go over there to make sure the box is on. If it’s not then turn it on. 
---
Rarely you’ll run into one of them people who believe their entitled to ghouls by turning the jukebox off then complain to you that your the one entitled because your on a public server and wanting to complete the event fast.
---
This happened to me 2 times. It’s funny how some people minds work.
---
I saw a datamines of the potential effects a while ago: it had listed the effects as things that we've seen on named weapons before, like +10 health, +fire damage, +10% damage

Grafton Steel is a major donor to my campaign... ... ^and ^cannot ^possibly ^be ^guilty ^of ^everything ^they’re ^accused ^of.
---
I don't buy any of those collectable things, while I understand that others like them, I feel that they are an unnecessary expense
---
I'm quitting because they cheated. I'm quitting because Bethesda isn't punishing them. I agree, it's the journey, but now my journey is destroyed because it's impossible for me to trade with other players and know I'm not receiving a duped item, which if I did would make me a cheater.
---
They wrecked my journey so that they could get to the destination.
---
Thanks, you're awesome. I've noticed that when I had multiple helmets in my inventory of different colors and I modded one to have the bright lamp, it would appear to change color to the other one. 
---
Side note. Its interesting. Your blue helmet seems to be a darker blue than mine is, could just be the lighting though. I'll be keeping my eye out for a green helmet niw.
---
traveling merchants like A.T.H.E.N.A.
---
You can get it from scrapping the military ammo bags, usually find them around the army camps
---
It keeps me alive especially with mobs.  My secret service buttressed armor with the under armor gets me killed way more often.
---
Aside from what has already been mentioned, it's a lot easier to get a suit of PA together compared to a full legendary outfit. It's also the iconic armour of the series as a whole.
---
I would agree that PA does need a bit of a buff, I'll give you that. I've seen a lot of attempts lately by others to run it down and declare it worthless, but it's far from useless.
---
To this, I would humbly submit that this glitch makes up for how Bethesda screwed us over with their buggy Lunchboxes that deny you their XP boost if too many are used at once, which they still haven't fixed.  Not to mention the many instances of auto-completing challenges which have never really been compensated.
---
Furthermore, it's entirely possible to get these XP totals legitimately if everyone cooperated in a normal LITS.  Tedious, but possible.  If anything, the increased number of griefers or heavy hitters at LITS ends up balancing this out.
---
I'm not going to be the one placing the TENT, but I don't really have sympathy for Bethesda's position either, if that is their position.
---
One of the devs that seldomly posts here,said it's been aknowledged ,but won't surely come before 2 or 3 patches.
---
most of the south in general gets really weird at the term union.
---
to the point where people go on long tirades of how awful unions are, etc. etc. just at the mere mention of the word.  
---
it's wild.
---
I hope children never go away!
---
Unless you're rich, or have money to spare ,you're an idiot lol, you could of finished it no problem with spending far less atoms, and why did you want to finish it as early as possible, so you can sit in your camp now and just look at it and be excited?
---
As much as I would like this, the only downside is Bloodied builds. I have Born Survivor (Rank 1), but purposefully unequip it unless I'm facing high level enemies, because when I'm at peak bloodied (which is under 20%), it keeps engaging all the time, which can run a lot of stimpaks. I only use diluted, and can craft them fairly easily), but having chems engage that often would be a turn off to likely all bloodied players.
---
Oprah came flying on sled and distributed them.

Coltan mining in the eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo is called "artisanal mining" which is a term for digging with hand tools in tunnels you dug yourself like a human mole.  Coltan is necessary for basically all computers and phones.
---
The pictures will make you angry/sad and possibly claustrophobic.
---
They're placeholders for sure and they would make the grind more tedious but I'm hoping they will be there for some upcoming reason. Possibly faction related items e.g. Raider, Enclave, BoS etc.
---
This is the main issue of the entire game in my opinion. 
---
FO76 wants to desperately be an MMO experience, but offers only the downsides + addiction of an MMO. 
---
There is literally no way to consistently farm for better gear in dungeons or certain locations. ITs all a matter of luck. 
---
I've played other looter shooters and looter RPGs and every single one of them has it. 
---
Think Borderlands series with boss drops (boss doesnt take 20 minutes to spawn also) 
---
Think Diablo games where you can run and rerun dungeons to farm. 
---
Then there is the smelting/reforming of your legendaries to avoid the need for godluck - yeah lets not implement that either. 
---
I hope they will stop hiding the legendary loot routes by timeboxes (events) or a 20 min silo run (SBQ and Earl) but i'm sure thats just wasted hope.
---
Is this the Torso or the Arms causing this?
---
Here is a Ghillie suit man in his daily life

That is a very arrogant view and very self centered I was trying to convince you to stay but you seem like one of those total justice freaks so I guess we as a community is better off
---
If you got 1 of the five, you should’ve gotten both masks, Whitesprings, white powder, and BOS jumpsuits...pretty sure all five drop together
---
Im aware of that. Wasnt it mentioned shortly after launch that it was just scrapped content?
---
CSS
---
And likely blacklisted faster than you could blink
---
You had to be in a private group to have teammates build in your CAMP, I’m sure there’s a few people that got tricked into it but most people were trying to abuse an ingame glitch to produce large amounts of ammo. Now 99% of them will cry poor me someone placed it in my camp and I can’t get rid of it.
---
Funny thing is Bethesda will probably never punish people for doing it but unluckily for you the game has managed to do it for them.
---
Also what’s this solution you worked out in 5mins for players to solve the issue themselves?
---
Stabilzed is the only reason to really use it
---
"Any more cunty responses?" is an incredibly rich reply coming from someone who tried to smug the thread up with "who's still making ammo."
---
I didn't complain about the ratios. I merely stated that the changes are to the UI only. 
---
Also, .50 is not the only ammo a heavy ballistic gunner might need.  I, for one, need .308 and, sometimes, 2EC. The only thing that will make those ammo types sustainable is priming the guns and/or the Legendary Ammo perk that's coming with patch 22 or so. The ammo converter does absolutely nothing for people who need .308 or 2EC.
---
I will add that doing this event solo is a lesson in futility.
---
Thanks for the link!
---
Well I didn't know about the update (don't really read news about games that much) and I make ammo because this ammo converter is a pain and I prefer having 10k+ with me when I roam the Wasteland and join events. If you don't make ammo, that doesn't mean nobody does. Besides with ammo Smith and super duper perks it's much more profitable to make ammo yourself. But I do hope new update will change that.
---
How am I self centered when all of these dupers want everything for no effort?
---
They're selfish, and self centered
---
It pretty much is like that sometimes. During my 20's-40's worked in the capital Wasteland (DC) and the only time I got to see tourist places was when I was showing friends and family (from out of town) around town. Work just absorbs most of your time.
---
She is NOT immune to explosive damage.  Knock her shield and she takes more damage from the explosive effects.
---
I can’t tell you how many times I’ve accidentally accumulated 15-20 weight-worth of gunpowder...
---
Yep :)
---
Hmm another blue helmet, that would be cool. Have to check that out and see if there are different blue ones. Or maybe other shades of colours
---
It seemed so from your conversation.
---
I'm not sure. That would be unfortunate if it was. It'd be a waste of great potential.
---
That's funny, because the left arm refuses to apply the skin at all.
---
I wonder if there's a Covid Queen somewhere in a fissure.
---
Yes.  Easily soloed. Just turn on the Jukebox and defend it.
---
True I remember I almost bought the beta for it but people were saying it was hardcore p2w at the time and I was broke anyways.
---
I remember laughing at them making a Battle Royale. Like who could beat the GOAT Pubg?! Now Pubg is dead and Fortnite is king. Still Apex is awesome if you don't want to have to build shit. I don't think I would make a good investor.
---
Alrighty, just finished up.
---
Launched nuke, fast travel to camp and unload junk, checked improved repair kit stock, 76 exactly. (totally made chuckle lol)
---
Fast traveled to engagement area before nuke dropped, nuke lands, quest pops.
---
On her first landing I fired an assault rifle I found at her. One clip, 20 rounds, I was averaging five damage a shot. (Simulating a player doing damage but not enough for loot) 
---
After this I just crouched and punched various trash mobs that spawned, tried to stay out of the way for the most part.
---
After she was downed the only loot on her for me was a couple of crossbow bolts. (I guess someone had a crossbow lol)
---
Scorched Earth completed and I received treasury notes, junk still empty and repair kit total unchanged. Still received the two star combat armor.
---
I honestly don't know if things were different before wastelanders. It felt weird to me early on when I'd get "quest complete" but no reward except the combat armor.
---
Did anyone wanna farm him w me? I knew about most of these places but I’ve just been quite unlucky /:
---
What i learned from this ‘ban wave’ BS:
---
1: Duping is fine, duped loots are fine, do whatever you feel like doing, total user count means everything to Beth.
---
2: In-game market means nothing 
---
3: Don’t grind for anything, wait for the next dupe wave
---
That would explain why I've only been rewarded for this once even though I've completed multiple times.
---
You guys are hilarious offering so many words of encouragement, this is such an obvious shit post like clearly YOU need a psychiatrist if this doesnt register as a joke
---
I want the next Fallout to be in Colorado now, so they can use Rocky Mountain High lol.
---
Because you literally just said because they took a short cut it ruined your experience. Why does it matter what they have if you dont have it there shouldn't be a problem yet you are going out of your way to make it your problem
---
Exactly, and for those of us who refuse to cheat by duping or accepting obviously duped items, it ruins the game
---
You are not alone! I constantly struggle with my carry weight, and I’m max strength with all deep pocketed armor. Everything I can loot I will. Takes me awhile to finish doing anything cause I’m constantly getting distracted by the sweet sweet junk everywhere
---
Thank you for testing. I will update shortly based on my own findings as well, I'm about to launch.
---
There’s nothing wrong with it but from I can see it looks pretty basic. Haven’t watched the video sorry.
---
Every time I rebuild my base I learn something new and my base improves, the only thing that really lets me down is the build limit.
---
If your talking about the one you teleport to then your gonna be disappointed.
---
Players were abusing this thing with trap camps and then Beth removed them. This was a long time ago. 
---
Ofc you can still use them at workshops.
---
I think t 65 looks good stock, if that's what you mean.
---
Interesting. I'll have him check his inventory when we jump on later. Thanks!
---
Until they fix it, I do have a workaround (assuming you remember) after you first log in, look at your Legendary SCORE rank, if it says 1, go to the board.  It will then be fixed and you don't have to worry about that bug.
---
1) I dont know where you got this from but datamining and even Bethesda have confirmed the queen CAN NOT be staggered.
---
this visual you are referring to is a glitch that occurs from a failure to lock onto a valid target. GET OFF THE FENCES and TENTS!
---
When she lands and her ads spawn they are on her team and they partly share her resistances, that can be shared but her resistance to stagger is not one of them. When heavy gunners do not have one gun army equipped their effectiveness against the ads is reduced and it takes longer to mitigate them.
---
2)She is 100% immune to all explosive damage period. That means Mini-nukes, missiles, grenades, weapons that ONLY do explosive damage will have 0 effect on her. Weapons that have the explosive effect will work on her but the explosive effect will do no additional damage to her. Again this is what has been verified by datamining as well as bethesda.
---
Still better than many,even natives.
---
To be fair, I’ve worn ghillie suits IRL...and this is kind of what you see. 
---
But still, not cool...
---
uded to be that way. but when we had PVP. it was a instant death camp guaranteed kill spawn. just to easy. so they removed it. and it was only available to work at workshops. and in the most resent update they are now useless and they now charge you to fast travel to your own workshops.
---
So, if you choose to fast travel while enemies are nearby, it will close the map, go back to your main screen, and start a timer, yes?
---
If you move, or do any actions within the duration of that timer, it will cancel the fast travel action. You have to stay still and not move, not crouch (if currently standing), not stand (if you're currently crouching), not click sticks or hit any buttons or pull any triggers.
---
I have the healing factor mutation.
---
The only times it stopped the timer, I realized, were when I moved around or did anything at all.
---
I have yet to experience the constant fails in fast travel cancelling after selecting it on the map as some have stated. But my experience sounds eerily similar to at least how this issue starts up on your end. 
---
I have, however, popped up inside of rocks or at the bottom of a cliffside when the camp is up top. That still happens to me, forgot to bring up the rest of the layers to this issue.
---
Perhaps I am just lucky and not been hit by this cancels-fast-travel bug the way y'all have been? But I'm not sure how that would be a thing, because computer bugs affect everyone accessing the same program, I'd imagine. But at the very least, I wanted to note how I experienced this a handful of times, but no longer do so just by letting go of the controller after clicking a location to travel to.
---
Edit: additional.
---
If they can fix the overall quality control issue, I actually think the spread of rewards is pretty good. Gold/atom rewards definitely need to be increased. I dig having perk cards to round out my options. I like the lunchboxes for the social aspect and the xp bonus. Having a repair kit or two isn't a bad thing. 
---
I've never cared much for most of the "advertisey" and super lore unfriendly skins in the Atom Shop (and the ones I do like never come around again), so I was excited about the more subdued styles in the Legendary Run. But a lot of them are unusable. The character's hand doesn't touch the stock IN THE PROMO PICTURE ON THE GAME BOARD for the Blood Eagle Handmade Skin. Same for others. You cannot tell me that the designers of these skins didn't notice this and raise the issue.
---
In the future, I would actually prefer more cool CAMP items instead of the weapon/armor skins (that they obviously struggle to make work). Even if it is just a pack of skins for generators/connectors or a wallpaper, that is likely to get more use from me than a buggy gun skin. And yes, I know, the Futuretech CAMP skin is bugged, but that should be something they fix relatively quick I would think (hope). 
---
And, as others have said, it'd be nice if the items did keep to the theme a bit better. A VATS Unknown skin anyone? A skin for the spacesuit? Crashed Satellite CAMP item?
---
Just my two cents.
---
I often wonder how many BE's and Legacies I sold to the Whitespring vendor during the first couple of weeks of play. 😭😭😭
---
I only get the juke up and running and wait crouched in the corner. Luckily I tag a few ghouls, as everybody now prefer killing them before they enter the building.

That is my build.  Swap rifleman for commando if you want more DPS.  I like to conserve ammo.
---
And btw, i play this game over 200 hours and never buyed Atoms:)
---
I'm not rich and i absolutely didnt want to flex with it :) in my opinion, its absolutely okay to pay 50€ for Atoms if u love the game and want something just rn :) 
---
So dont be that rude and call me an Idiot buddy :) 
---
Have a nice eve
---
It's not a "shortcut"
---
If you were playing poker and someone kept, very visibly, pulling aces from their sleeve, would you walk away or keep playing?
---
Omg! Same! Gotta love all that junk!!! 😂😂😂
---
Agreed, especially in the guaranteed legendary point. It feels like such a cop out running Leader of the Pack just to clear the “Kill 3 Legendaries” daily...
---
Oh nice, thanks.
---
That sucks, I’ve been working on a under the map build with no way out (trading hall, not a trap) and it’s gonna look terrible without being enclosed
---
I switch to power armor so I can add stabilized to my The Action Hero at SBQ fights.
---
The DMV is enough of a hell than being nuked.
---
Extra fire damage on weapons would be nice. Something other than a flamer, shishkebab or Perfect Storm.
---
Let me guess, you got yourself a nice B2525 Fixer, right? That moment when you watch a video how to dupe stuff but you have no idea about the game. This is just gross
---
The biggest dupers are pure RMT. They make a killing
---
For sure check your inventories, has a less than .02% chance to drop. Nice and rare. 👍🏼👍🏼

Whenever you mine an ultracite vein it causes a bunch of scorched to spawn. If the vein glitches an doesn't disappear you can do this repeatedly by ckicking on it. Never ending flux materials.
---
Ghillie wallpaper in the next atomic shop/s
---
Enlighten me vault dweller?
---
You can get XP and loot literally anywhere.  SBQ isn't even top 5 for events with loot/XP besides the flux.
---
Yeah, its sad that it is often easier to solo the queen than run it with a server. 
---
Fought one the other day where a lvl 450 guy with a hacked gun of some type, ( looked like a cryolator with a minigun barrel ) kept her aggro in the air, and stood on the bunker fence. The queen had no way to get to him, and no one could do enough damage to take the aggro away from him.
---
... so she just dive bombed consecutively maybe 25 - 30 times.
---
It's just frustrating, please stand in open areas where she can land, and don't shoot her in the air. I want my repair kits lol.
---
Scorched don't seem to drop glowing blood.
---
Thats true everybody kept everything and I’ve heard some people got 10000 atoms as apology for their time out.
---
I don’t know about that. If it was scrapped content, why not update the visual?
---
\- Also add more passive STR points (+15) to Power armor to compensate unyielding armor stats. 
---
u r funny. more suggestions:
---
\+ 15 INT bcz a stupid caracter cant enter to PA, + 15 AGI bcz I wanna be a real Ninja and I am ok to use only silent&amp;weightless PA , + 100 LCK bcz only the Mr. Lucker can afford a set of PA in apocalyptic world, + 15 to other stats bcz I use unyielding armor and dont want to lose my specials, ecpecially my charisma! show me some respect!!!
---
Oh thanks :D
---
Bruh 1 its a 1 star bloodied one 2 Stop being an asshole to someone just because they want to know what perks are good for this
---
Yeah it happened to me twice last week. Auto aim hackers unloading into the air and killing half the map in the first minute of the round. Its pretty frustrating when you're only there to do your dailys and you get no opportunity to do so
---
Honestly  I dont understand  your logic ,you could of had the same items you have now for spending significantly less atoms, I dont understand  why you needed to have the items right this moment, you sound light an entitled spoiled little kid
---
I see no problems with his logic. 🔥“Everything is fine” 🔥 🙃
---
That is a game where there is a singular winner. Fo76 is a multiplayer experience with no competitive field aside speed running silos. I get the comparison you are making but this isnt a game where you win or lose you just play you should find a group of friends to play with it completely changes the experience.
---
TIL
---
Here all week, try the fish.
---
public teams do not have access to your locked resources.  If someone picked the lock you need to re-lock it since the lock is broken.
---
Can i ask you what you think of when the game is marketed as a MMO experience where the main part of the game is to gather good loot (against all odds ofcourse, wouldnt want you to have it easy/fair). 
---
For me that means getting done with the game missions in a non rush manner (lvl 153 shows OP didnt rush) and then the ACTUAL game begins. You know the looting part of the MMO which is supposed to give you new stuff and keep you engaged. Which is supposed to challenge you / your team and in return give you fun new toys to test. 
---
OP is looking for said way to stay engaged and the only thing you can say is you rushed. Really? 
---
ITs not like a Dev could and should add end-game content right ? Just take 500h to go through a story line of 50h and be happy to find a halfassed weapon for your build.
---
😆😆😆😆
---
Ghillie suits work like camo, theyre designed to help you blend in with your surroundings when hunting, weather its people or animals. Its got an appeal because, like camo,  it does make you harder to spot. Some people really like the aesthetic, since its kind of a military vibe. Me....not so much.
---
I'd rather sit through 10 hours of Settler Wanderer and her guitar playing than listen to that message.
---
Anyone know how much these would sell for in a camp vendor?
---
Rad-x and radaway is as common as water in this game but you don't really even need it for the event since the mine has decon showers.
---
And military grade duct tape
---
You absolutely win or lose in PvP. If I take a workshop now, pretty much everyone who comes to take it from me will have the best weapons and armour in the game. How is there no competition?
---
How hard would it really be to have a sell all option one you pick an ammo type?
---
LoL ^^
---
I Stop talking to u now :)
---
And I thought the Raider Power Armor taking up half the screen with heavy guns was an issue. At least I had the other half of the screen, lol. This is awful and shows a complete lack of QA (shocking) from Bethesda.
---
Different playstyles. I was stealth and melee Bloodied, I was stealth Junkies, now I'm full health PA Heavy.
---
Get good and you can win a game of nw.
---
yup, they pretty much stated in the end of my support ticket, that its intended so they dont plan on fixing it, thing is, it looked fine before wastelanders.
---
Lol dude even in the base Gatling gun skin the Extra Large Mag blocks the front sight.
---
Bethesda still haven't fixed that....
---
You don't need that.
---
Really ? Those packs rip me up even at Lv. 12 lol. I'm usually solo though.
---
Ah yes, the housecat stealth program
---
I only got the forest scout mask, didn't get any jumpsuits as a reward.
---
Pro tip: the most egregious duper’s have multiple accounts. When one gets suspended they make another one and keep it rolling. You’re angry at the people who duped a few guns amongst friends who aren’t spreading it like wildfire. That’s a majority of the people who got suspended. The real big duper’s still haven’t stopped.
---
Glowing mass, sorry
---
I just end up buying it, I'll do a Grape Mentats/Hard Bargain run at Whitesprings and clear them out.
---
could u be more specific?
---
Death claw eggs don't spoil which is great if you hoard them for deathclaw wellington, but are a simple dish when you need something handy.
---
Maybe I'm just unlucky, but it sounds like you need "glowing" enemies for that
---
Was there any indication that not having them available in NW was intentional? I noticed that, too, and wasn't sure if it was a bug or intended.
---
I guess they are dropping individually now. First I’ve heard of that. Possible though
---
My thoughts exactly. I don't understand how it works, but I'm pretty sure a game of this level can easily make something like the algorithm you mentioned to award players with one of the ammo types they actually use. It always pisses me off that I never ever get 5mm or 50. caliber that I need most, but I always get some nukes, missiles or crossbow bolts that I don't need and that weigh a lot. Another solution could be just turning all the ammo rewards into ammo points so we'd choose what we want ourselves.

Dude your already wrong if your trying the PvP route in this agruement, I host regular events without legendaries and events with legendaries . I know a dozen people on here thatd kill you while naked and using a switch blade. 
---
Duping didnt kill PvP secret agent and cola nut did
---
They do. The hard mat to farm is high radiation fluid and I've walked away with over 60 doing the ultracite vein trick. If you do it in the tree at Tanagra they even spawn in the centre for easy killing.
---
I just got these tonight! Pretty sure it was from One Violent night, though there are other events and dailies that drop them too. Does anyone know if they sell for much? I doubt I will use them.  
---
I got a green asylum uniform from something too, Line in the sand maybe? Is there somewhere to get a bit more of an idea of what certain clothing items are worth?
---
And this was on my 2nd character. When I got it on my 1st character, I sold it to a vendor as I didn't realise then they were rare drops!
---
The whole "completely deleting 100% of the camp from the module" that's in the title and main post. 
---
You've got people messaging the support team, but they can't do anything. The only tools they have are to give you atoms if you don't like an atomic shop purchase. 
---
The ghost budget issue, while prevalent now from the ammo funny business, has been around since launch. There has always been something that can take up budget and not show it. We had stuff like unscrapped wires, neon lights, billboards and turrets just eating that stuff up. And each time the issue arose, support would say the same thing. 
---
"Support doesn't have the tools to help you in-game with this issue."
---
Now, if you were messing around and noticed your budget was being eaten up by something unknown, you could, as a last resort, select a hypothetical "delete all" option on your camp module that would do just that, scrap every single camp item and reset your budget to zero. 
---
No longer would you have to wait for an update 2-3 months away to fix an issue with the camp budget. You'd have the option to solve your problem yourself without needlessly involving support. 
---
And sure, the issue right now for most people is the ammo stuff. But I don't have a doubt in my mind that other forms of camp budget eatery will come. There always seems to be one or two with the big updates. 
---
As for the whole 5 minutes thing, after quickly looking to see if anyone had found a solution and not finding one, I just sat down and thought about a possible solution, and it came to me.
---
I received a no drop and no flux and repair kits. My friend did around 200 damage and got the rewards and no drop. Updating now
---
same. I don't use grenades, but I think there's a grenade that uses mini-nuke? I'm not sure tho.
---
Huh, would've never expected anything like that from Bethesda, but honestly not surprised
---
Do you have a source on this?
---
The name of this post literally says it..
---
We'll see, you may be right that they wont charge me again, but after the whole process I had to go through just to get to this point I have a hard time trusting Bethesda Austins integrity.
---
Yeah good luck!
---
No more legendary effects.
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_76_legendary_weapon_effects this has all known 4th and 5th weapon effects
---
maybe I should just stick to Steam going forward too, got Path of Exile for me and the wife on there after this, we're having a blast with that.
---
In my experience, certain dailies are region locked so to speak.
---
Noticed how the Raider daily quests work. There are two possible daily quests available (Importance of Communication and Retirement Plan).
---
While there are two possible quests, you only get one a day, chosen randomly. Either Importance of Communication or Retirement Plan, but never both on the same day.
---
It would seem certain daily quests function like this and are locked based on their region. Much like the Camden Park quests (Dross Toss, Chow Line, and Lucky Mucker) and the Raider dailies where you can only get one of the available quests a day and which one it is is chosen randomly.
---
In the Forest, Ecological Balance and Strange Brew seem to be connected this way. Only one per day chosen randomly.
---
In Cranberry Bog, Cop a Squatter and Heart of the Enemy seem to be connected this way.
---
In the Mire, Queen of the Hunt, Idle Explosives, and Waste Not seem to be connected like this.
---
In the Toxic Valley, Buried with Honor, Big Game Hunter, and Target Rich Environment all seem to be connected like this.
---
Someone to Talk to seems to reliably start every day, likely because it is the only daily in the Savage Divide region.
---
Vital Equipment and Photo Opportunity arent tied to anything and start reliably every day. Both the Scout dailies (Operation Tidy and Stings and Things) aren't tied to anything and start reliably daily. Although Stings and Things is buggy and often resets and can be completed multiple times a day for me.
---
Trick or Treat, Pass the Buck, Thrill of the Grill,  and Play Time all do not seem to be tied to anything, but sometimes seem to just not start occasionally. Thrill of the Grill and Play Time both also seem to occasionally reset and be able to be completed multiple times a day.
---
The two unmarked Raider daily quests at Ohio River Adventures also seem to occasionally reset on server hop and are able to be completed multiple times a day.
---
This is all from my experince playing since release.
---
I beg to differ I have full secret service skin and my view is blocked when sprinting with a heavy weapon!
---
Jukebox. Problem solved.
---
"get gud" doesnt apply when dealing with hackers
---
Would be cool if they could Fallout76-ify Skyrim.
---
OP is about to disappear.
---
Godd Howard takes no prisoners.
---
My mule with the 50 cal you get from the ally quest in excavator armor with 1 rank of the 3 heavy gun perks, stabilized and bloody mess has absolutely no problem doing 1k damage in under a minute.  Mule isn't even built for heavy guns, it's stealth commando.
---
I mean, I'm so damn lazy I don't even use psychotats or ballistic bock and I have no problem.
---
Yes, there are people with busted weapons or exploiting melee damage stacking that can kill it in a couple seconds, but they're by far the exception, and if they're the one that dropped the nuke, well, they're the one that dropped the nuke.
---
If the devs are having a hard time fixing it, then you can stop guessing at the cause of it.
---
For example, I've had it happen like this : can't fast travel, move around/reload/etc... until finally I get to fast travel, once it loads try to fast travel again and it doesn't work (without moving/crouching or anything).
---
I may be a bit salty, but this bug happens to me a lot over multiple characters and so far no "fix" that I've seen from dozens of people (that swear it's an easy fix) works.   
---
I was playing for a couple of hours per day and I would run into it dozens of times.  It's bad enough for me that I think I'm done with the game until it's fixed.
---
I hope you're right, its a strange way of doing it though, never had similar issues with any other MMO, including ESO.
---
And it’s fine if you want to do that. But don’t just go on Reddit and talk to people like they’re idiots just because they don’t want to use what you think is the “best”. Which is what you’ve been doing.
---
A hat that good might even replace my Ushanka I’ve had since I picked it up around 100 levels ago, even without the light it’s a better hat skin with the flaps hanging down.
---
Those are completely seperate issues, which should be fixed.
---
I have no problem with people with legacies and sent assassin armour showing up to take my workshop, if they earned it legitimately.
---
Melody Larkin has to be the worst Responder character lol. I thought it was Kesha McDermott and her accent in the early goings (Flatwoods and Morgantown airport), but once you get to Charleston here comes Melody Larkin lol.
---
Oof you overpaid. I can see the plan costing that much but usually for craftable outfits, pay no more than 500 caps. Someone made me one for 45 caps actually right after the event.
---
The games a fkn shitshow. They really have mentally given up trying but they have to keep the game running. I guess when ITT tech shut down they all got hired by bethesda. Such a passionless incompetent run game. Anyone working on this game shouldnt even be allowed to stock games at a best buy.
---
I agree. What surprises me the most is that they didn’t just wipe dupers accounts. Although they did perma ban people who went overboard with duping.
---
I'm loving the bugs in the game. Gives it character. Hate the fast travel bug though. I treat it as a bonus mini game. What can I do to get this to work? Walk 5 feet? Hide? Unhide? Pipboy? Try again?
---
Then start hacking
---
What level are you?
---
She is 100% immune to explosive damage period.
---
She does not have a shield, she does not take explosive damage she is set to take 0 damage from the explosive damage type.
---
If you want to pop off a mini nuke because for some reason there is a swarm of scorched around her and you want to help clear them that will help but she will take 0 damage from it.
---
35
---
Any word on if anyone was unbanned who used the God Mode exploit to rush through the SCORE ranks? Surely anyone who would *dare* to threaten their potential profits would be banished for all eternity 😂
---
i'm not an asshole who only gets enjoyment from ruining other's fun
---
See, this would have made me bought F1st. Just this.
---
On my Leather ones, it clips in a weird overlay on the right hand side when shooting/reloading in first person. I just took them off and will wait for a fix (if ever)
---
The secret service helmet has a functional headlight.
---
Hmm maybe there's two marks we need to hit for the two rewards. Granted I did very little damage. It's  such a bummer the on-screen damage numbers aren't entirely accurate which makes these things more challenging to nail down.
---
Also I gotta say a ton of info in here is great! I agree with pretty much everything here lol. Just wanted to let you know cause it feels like I'm focusing real hard on just one small aspect here.
---
So you were 100% right, I’m loving this gun. I went ahead and got the prime capacitor and didn’t realize how much ammo it could make with one flux. I’ve been rolling here and there and I’ve dumped the quad for more damage. Right now I got a 2* instigating 50% limb damage which did like a freaking 2700 dmg sneak headshot. Also have a 3* Zealots reduced VATS cost and aiming damage which seems like it would be useful for SBQ I’d think?  At that damage I don’t know if zealots really matters if you disregard SBQ as the instigating first shot is killer. So for now I’m keeping both and probably going to try for a better instigating roll.
---
Also in most of the US, your property taxes is what helps pay for schools. So if you are already in a poor area with low value property then your taxes aren't really properly funding the schools. Now more and more states are starting to "pool" funds rather than have it based off of area or school zone to help spread the money more evenly but this has caused middle class and rich (mostly white) folks to start talking about school vouchers which would let them take that tax money back from the pool and allow them to send their kids to private schools, therefore taking money away from those poor schools who were just starting to get help. America is pretty wack when it comes to education and helping impoverished people.

There should be a 1% chance the Wendigo pops out in a clown outfit!

Well, no, wait a minute.  Why would someone get banned for repeating this information?  You claimed that one of Bethesda's Community Managers said this.  That should be a matter of public record, either a post here, their forum, or their Discord.  Unless you're suggesting that you've been whispering the managers, or that they've redacted Discord conversations about it, because otherwise, the MODUS bot that runs in F76 Discords should have picked this up.
---
I'm level 230, approaching 1,000 hours played, and I still haven't officially "picked a side" yet. I bet there's at least 20 locations I haven't discovered. I can think of at least 5 daily events and at least 10 random events I haven't tried yet.
---
So from my perspective, where there is still quite a bit to do in the game, yeah, OP rushed through the content.
---
oh yeah.. I want an event where every wave of enemies will be more difficult. U have only 1 life and by difficult I mean 10 SheepSquatch lvl 100 all together or 30-50 SP with miniguns. It would be really awesome to be able to challenge urself with hardcore events than by degrading urself to a berserker with bow.
---
Dont sweat it dude. This is how we learn, discussion, trial and error
---
5 are supposed to show up in the workshop museun in the ash heap, seems like it would be a good place to see if there are more colors
---
1000 bullions would've been more accurate. Equals one extra end-game piece for finishing the run.
---
Did you use the Future-Tec Camp machine skin from the Legendary Run?
---
Thanks I am using that camp skin.
---
that would  be the best solution to everyone's problem with ammo :p
---
With how often random sentinal assassin pieces show up I'm surprised more people dont have sets I personally assembled 7 sets of mismatched pieces.
---
But the bigger point is there is no competitive end goal that they can affect you with at this pointing fells like your flailing for a reason with out evidence. I'm curious if there is an underlying reason youve taken umbridge with the situation
---
This event is unbelievably easy to solo, what build are you running that you *can't* solo it?
---
Because ugly.
---
Yes I will be removing it here shortly, thanks.
---
On the episode of Dragnet where the two guys shoot a cop with a sawed off shotgun and get away with it for several months, while Joe Friday is talking with one of them he mentions how the crook was born in Harlan. Pointless trivia, but trivia none the less.
---
I confirm. I had a team member who tried and he got a bounty
---
I farm this Event for legendary script!
---
Someone already mentioned fissure site hopping, but another spot that often yields legendaries is the houses southwest of welsh station, where the overseer holotape is. It will pretty frequently have a legendary sheepsquatch.
---
Because there’s no such thing as bands/musicians in fallout, or real life? I can agree with “magic” like legendaries; I mean a gun that ignores armor, sets things on fire, or explodes without ammo made to do those things is very counter-immersive. Other ones are just plain ridiculous.  
---
But traveling musicians exist in REAL LIFE. I’m sure we’re not saying have some D&amp;D type string orchestra music. But to be able to walk around playing fallout-era tunes would be sweet imo. 
---
Haven’t you seen Fury Road? Hell those sand devils have their own post apocalyptic motivational guitarist...🤷🏼‍♀️
---
and reward boss fight must be a 3\* legendary item to drop, no 1\* rolling pin.
---
a 404 error?
---
Lol it took you 5mins to think of it, that doesn’t mean it takes 5mins to implement it. Adding in a delete all camp option could cause any number of issues including people losing their current CAMPs. I would dread to think of what’s going to end up happening if something like this was added into the game. Not to mention it’s not always as easy as just putting in a “delete all” button, coding is rarely that simple.
---
For example I could say “why don’t you auto remove duped weapons, when you detect one being made remove it from the game” took me 1min to think of that, think it’s going to take 1min to code that into the game?
---
Honestly it’s probably because the support team we get through to aren’t part of the team who have access to actually make changes in game. Not sure if we can even get through to a department that can actually do more than make refunds.
---
I’m interested to know how long have you been playing, what level are you and how did you end up with the ammo machine in your CAMP?
---
Also, it could be that the power got turned off. I couldn't figure out why my Water Purifier was always empty, until I realized it wasn't getting power (wire was gone, somehow).
---
This is exactly right. Once the lock is picked, the extractor is fair game. It's easy to run up to collect and not even notice that it no longer is locked unless you think to double check.
---
This could actually be a thing.  Thanks for responding.
---
The only 2 I've seen went for 2500 so that's what I paid haha I'm not too concerned considering how easy it is to make caps
---
I'm sure this helped.
---
I no longer play this event UNLESS it is solo on my private world, which because Beth slowed down events some time ago, is pretty rare. It used to be my favorite event because you could run out the clock and farm wave after wave of ghouls that often included legendaries (it was common to score 4-6 in an event, including level 50 plus). Even then the public events were usually ruined by idiots rushing the clock.
---
Then with patch 20 Beth agreed with the idiots and cut the time from 30 to 10 minutes. Now with Idiots guaranteed to show up the public event is not worth doing unless you just want the T-bills.
---
Thanks Beth
---
Yeh no idea why they didn’t keep them banned. Hard to stay interested in the game when there’s nothing of worth anymore. The whole “ everyone is super so nobody is super” is dumb. When everybody is super who cares about the game at all??
---
She’s at the end after the scorchbeast. There’s a little raised bit before u go through the tunnel to the lift with a console. She’s there. Good luck with the SB lol
---
Let me guess, you’re a sad and angry person who finds no joy in life so you make a conscious effort to belittle other people you don’t even know with facts and info you don’t have. You’re gross.
---
Yeah. You're a bit under levelled tbh. I know you've asked for help but there's no hurry. if you struggle with this you'll still struggle after. I would recommend getting to at least 45. At least.
---
Sorry, new to imgur and deleted that post. Just changed the link, with a better pic and a short vid
---
Bit more detail than I remember, since I learned about this in regards to railroad companies, but good on the history! At least the purveyor isn’t making us live on the stuff...
---
For those who are not familiar with Pennsylvania, look up "Centralia, PA." It was a mining town, or more accurately, a cluster of towns built around a mine. The coal mine caught fire, and the towns were abandoned. If you go there today, the fires are still burning, the houses look as if the people just left without taking a thing, and toxic coal smoke billows out of cracks in the ground. Very reminiscent of "fissure sites" minus the scorchbeasts.
---
Understandable. Thanks anyway!
---
Beckett pretends to be interested but I'm pretty sure he's so not into me. "Always good to see a *friend* around". He couldn't be more subtle
---
You can get 1k in the air with the 50 cal you get from the former raider ally quest with less than 1 craft of .50 rounds.
---
If you use stealth a handmade can do 1k in the air with 1 or 2 crafts of rounds as well.
---
If you go bloodied a good gatling plasma you can get 1k with less than 10% of a core and cores are super cheap.
---
Same. My GT is the same as my Reddit name. I don't have a ton since I'm only at level 56ish, but I do have some stuff if you want to swing by my camp. I won't be on until I get off work today, though, which will be around 4:30 central time. Let me know when you do and I'll fish what I can out of my stash. Luckily, I'm a hoarder and I can't live without the extra stash from FO1, so I should have a bit of everything.
---
Very wholesome! My mother's side is from WV and I've visited numerous times, probably up to 20+ times. But I love the state. The beauty, the people and the history. It may get a lot of bad rep, but when you go there, you realize why people live there. Great post OP.
---
I consider that a feature.
---
Oh...my....fucking....God....
---
It is so fun to run in my PA past sneaking builds and smack those gouls, level 477+ and can't understand why people still go around without a PA.
---
You can use a doorway to double a wall, and its budget but you can then have wall paper on both sides. It sucks but as of now it's the only way. Plus it only works for full walls no angles or half walls.
---
Hell, we *still* have slaves.
---
I LOVE the stealth suit, but I do wish we could wear it as underarmor with some fun outfits. I've got to get going with Foundation and get that bad boy unlocked!
---
Oh
---
If you are new do events for good xp between main quests. Killing mobs gives a lot xp so if you find a place you can easily clean it, do it some more times for good xp (server hop). Mob levels ties to the first person entering the area unlike mmo zones. That is why you sometime encounter unlikely high monsters.
---
Me too
---
Yeah!
---
I don’t disagree that wizards and D&amp;D assets are out of place. But music exists everywhere, and so do traveling musicians. Even in real life. What if we want to be like Doof in fury road?? He made sure everyone heard his battle music over the roar of their engines. And you already hear combat music over all the battle sounds. If it’s that annoying to some people they could put a mute tab on it like there is for microphones.
---
We had a glowing legendary Behemoth spawn there last night. Was a first for me. Dropped a Junkies SS Grog Axe for me. Definitely took more time for us to put it down than I expected.
---
\+15 str points to power armor is  logical step , basically power armor is exoskeleton and boosting your strength. But now, tiny character with unyielding armor can have it. 
---
Dont need to by sarcastic, you see unbalance but cannot accept it, because you probably spend tons of hours to grind best unyielding armor, and it would be shame not be the best of the best...
---
Don't dupe then?
---
When everybody has the best legendaries the game ceases to be engaging. Nobody plays games to be the same.
---
If you still think Bethesda is capable of doing something right the first time, you're an idiot.
---
I just woke up most things are still blurry what happened?
---
Probably not many cause it’d be one button away from the stash like all other junk.
---
Funny bc I run pass PA user with my bloodied build killing everything before they can even get a hit in
---
Do it after a queen. Then you'll see if high levels are there to support you in the world. I do every Encryptid I can.
---
First time i went through i was a bit higher than you and i died so many times and by the end most of my armour was broken and i was using whatever weapons i had ammo for. It was a fantastic experience. 
---
Look. I can come and help you if you want. I'll straight up murder everything in there but.. you'll miss out on the experience is all i'm saying. Up to you.
---
bushes in your helmet 2.0
---
Didn't realize this until I started doing possum badges and had to kill some evemies with fat man. I was surprised how tough those Bloody Eagles are surviving a mini-nuke in the face. I mean I know I don't have any perks to enhance the damage but come on.. it was always the most deadly weapon in fallout, so what the hell..
---
“Bro....get off the tent she won’t land if you’re on a tent!!!!”
---
Queen lands next to tent.  Eats 7000 rounds.  
---
“Dude man get off the f’ing tent bro guy....you’re ruining the fight!!!!!!”
---
Queen lands next to tent, gets housed.  
---
“Listen dude F you this is bullshit get off the tent f’ing newb.”  
---
Again, queen lands next to tent as if it were her special place of all places in the world.   My tent is seemingly her Xanadu, the air there smells sweeter, she pines to spend lazy sundays in my tent with a good book and a cup of hot tea....she loves this god damn tent.   She dies draped over my tent, in death her clawed wings embracing it, with me standing on it after 7 minutes.  
---
Skippy Gat Plaz and his crew, a well oiled machine of take no prisoner, ass kickers, The Fissure Site All Stars, all thumbs down me and the rando lvl 400 guy standing on my tent.  Then they suddenly strip to their underwear and start pvp’ing eachother, forgetting about the transgressors, maybe having been placated by a juice box or some Totinos pizza rolls?  
---
That’s a detailed, factual, account of at least 1000 sbq fights.
---
I know right?
---
Tater I am sorry you got scammed, that sucks the big one. There is no excuse and people that abuse the good-will of others should be afflicted with permanent hemorrhoids.
---
Nobody is forcing you to place your tent directly within the event area.
---
It had power but always was empty and there was a dude from my team standing next to it all the time.
---
You duped, you got banned. 
---
Awwww.
---
It'd be nice to select an option of what things you desire from quest and event rewards. Make it a general check list for weapons, ammo, misc, outfits, rare items, etc. Sorta opt out of the garbage that takes up space and weighs you down until you finally notice the piece of metal right arm scrap armor in your inventory and accidentally scrap your rare outfit or legendary piece of armor and then curse out at the metal piece of armor because you're losing your mind slightly.
---
Nah it’s good. I was just lost in the mine tbh but now that I know I should prooobably do it when I’m lvl 50, I’m just gonna leave it for now
---
That’s epic! Great pic.
---
Photomode glitch is suitable for passing through the doors, not through the solid wall.
---
The underlying reason would be that they're cheaters and should be punished. Just as anyone who breaks rules and laws should be, but so many are not.
---
Funny, level 337 and can’t understand why you wouldn’t be going around in a clunky hunk of metal. I *lose* carry weight in power armor. I take zero fall damage with my normal gear. And I always put a bullet in those ghouls long before your little meat hook can get near them.
---
I hear ya! Everytime I would finish the Lode Baring event, after the computer finishes it's announcement, Larkin proceeds to say her First Friends announcement every single time. Everytime I would log on, it would play. I'm not sure if this'll work for you, but everytime that happens, I would go somewhere where a radio announcement would automatically play, like the mayor of Grafton, &amp; then when they finish theirs, I would log off afterwards. It seemed to stop her announcements everytime I would log on.
---
[Here ya go!](https://old.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/) And your camp looks awesome! Love the lanterns on the railings!
---
New public team notifications block vendor prices. Have to wait for it to go away before finishing viewing a vendor.
---
That sounds kinda creepy
---
Fort Defiance is the best place.
---
Alsop check every one of the Armoured personal carriers
---
Woah, how'd you do the spiral staircase??
---
Noice
---
oh, sorry for that,m8. 
---
I was really really unlucky. 
---
Oh dont worry about that things will be taken care of even if bethesda wont
---
Some of those tier 4 traits are pretty nice. I'd love to have the blocking traits on my brawler build IF block gets changed to being able to hold block.
---
Bro yessss. We need some type of dungeon like this. It would be super sick.
---
Sold a forest mask about a month ago for 12k. But I've seen them as low as 8k. XB1
---
That would be nice but I don't see how lol
---
Fort Defiance is where i farm it. Every couple days I go through it for military ammo bags. Level 3 has the 'most' but it is spread throughout. It is still not 'a lot' and I have to be careful repairing my armor, but since I started going semi regularly I have not had an issue with it.
---
IP bans are stupid.  Most people do not have static IPs.
---
This actually made me laugh
---
What platform?
---
If you're on Xbox, use the Looking for Group function on XBox Live. Make a post that you're triggering the Impostor Encryptid and a start time (I just do minutes so time zones aren't a factor, so like "starting at xx:15").
---
Also, use the Recall Keycard, but don't initiate the Recall process. This is another one of those missions where you can start it before you start it. Once you use the Keycard you're given like 8-10 minutes to initiate the Recall process; however at this time the server notification goes up and it's marked on the map. You can now wait for people to show up before you initiate the recall and start the ACTUAL mission timer.
---
I tried this skin on two nights ago. Once I saw that the textures resemble a really cheap fake Christmas tree I immediately took it off.
---
I'd argue it's more accurate to real life
---
I generally enjoy third person games more than first person. But this game (as well as FO4 and Skyrim etc) just seem to work better in first person.
---
Third person gets wonky for me personally. But I'm glad they have the option to change it on the fly
---
For me, there are way to much "filler" rewards. 
---
Perkcardpacks, scrip, fireworks, goldbullion, (even caps? Don't remember quite) + 10 different ghilles, that are 1. lackluster, 2. all look the same and 3. and for most: don't fit in a space themed season at all.
---
All in all, there are like 5 cool items, 10 ok, and the rest shit. I didn't even bothered to get past rank 5.
---
Bethesda really has to step up their game for the next season
---
it's as if some never played a bethesda game before
---
I'm not defending the sloppy work but I'm beyond reacting
---
it's just like ok look the ghillie has a sunshade, VATS time
---
Palace of the dead style from FFXIV would be sick. Would much prefer clearing a floor and moving down a level instead of wave after wave. Please be a set amount too. Respawning enemies sucks.
---
It's most likely because people are sick and tired of walking away with yet another White Fedora. I know I am.
---
Oh they have, but either for season 2 or for the atom shop to get that money money money!
---
&gt;Fix it you cretins FFS
---
Could you be anymore of an asshole? Dear lord, child.
---
Their not going to address it in a meaningful way. If they had any intention of that they would have at the very least wiped suspended accounts back to zero. But from what iv seen here and other fallout 76 groups Bethesda is just giving the dupers their account back in full with just a slap on the wrist. 
---
my guess is they took a look at the figures and stood to loose to much money from fallout 1st subscriptions by banning all these idiots. 
---
after my experience last night I canceled my fallout 1st subscription and sent them a message why. i had queen fight last night where someone completely melted her as soon as the bombs dropped.
---
 they walked right over to fissure prime and destroyed the queen as she spawned in. I mean before she had even fully taken to the sky. I have a decent furious ultracite Gatling laser that is primed and I can’t even do that much damage to her. i can solo the fight but not melt her in 60 seconds.
---
I always thought it was for defense. Like a higher position would give them a tactical advantage against raiders, wasteland beasties, scorched, etc.
---
A shitty one, apparently.
---
Hahahahahahahaa I had all too many chuckles. Thanks for the laugh dova
---
That instigating sounds amazing.  Glad you like them.  Yeah making the ammo isn’t a problem.   Just do more fights!
---
This. It's a poorly structured event to begin with. If it at least had good rewards I could see it being worth it but once you have a fixer plan it's a worthless event.
---
90, I think.  Should have it wrapped up in a few days, which worries me, 'cause then what?  I'm used to getting on every day for the atoms.
---
I also want to mention - there is a use in scrapping down weapons and armor you do not need - it allows you to unlock mods for that item. For example, if you scrap down a shotgun, you might learn a receiver mod for shotguns or maybe a magazine mod etc. So in the future when you get a really good shotgun, you can then modify and improve it.
---
I don't know about your situation, but I recently sent them a video of a different fast travel bug occurring, and it took a lot of persistent daily bumps over a week to break the first level filter of customer service who kept wanting to troubleshoot my cpu speed before I got this:
---
&gt; Hello there,
---
&gt; Thank you for contacting the Bethesda Customer Support Team. My name is Julio, and I'm here to discuss this matter with you.
---
&gt; We are passing feedback to the dev team daily, so we will make sure this gets to them.
---
&gt; 
---
That is all you can do. Its a giant bureaucracy and you get no points for getting upset and refusing to play.
---
I don't think they're idiots.  I'm just curious as to why people would use *the armor that's best at armoring.*
---
I did my first SBQ battle at lvl 50 with a gauss rifle and was able to do enough damage to get the drop, so it's entirely possible for lower levels to be a part of the battle and succeed.
---
You sir thank you for standing up to this asshole
---
It’s on the periphery, sport.
---
So, we hear you want to buy lunch boxes...
---
I made my first run through Arktos yesterday, thought I explored it thoroughly but didn't find any power armor.  Where did I miss it?
---
Ahh Science! Sometimes just trying to find the answer to "What the hell is going on here?" can be quite fun ;)
---
I do usually have a look to see what level players are, just dont think the events worth it to most players once you have the fixer plan and outfits.
---
I mean it depends on how you perceive it. For you to question it like that makes me wonder where your loyalties lay
---
See that's the kind of response I expect but never get from them.
---
Don't give away my spots. 
---
Also, this is a stupid daily.
---
I miss the days of destroying bases or seeing the pop up that my camp was under attack.  Not that I did it often, but if my camp  could not be placed because some ugly base had taken the spot then it was GO Time.
---
In a very similar vein, I purchased the Waster skin for my PA, and using something like the 50 cal machine gun (A skin for which is included in the pack), I lose the just over half my screen to the left arm. Are they not separating first and third person models anymore?
---
Yeah, except you cannot use the ghillie skin armor in NW. At first I thought the same until it turned into a disappointment. would be nice tho, since I don't have the outfit but have the skins.
---
Amazing shot!!!
---
Its cantered off to the left on mine with the base skin.
---
You can make it gray, try pressing or holding V while it's open.
---
On xbox and I never actually thought of making a LFG on there lol, i do always wait till the time runs out though unless there's enough players.
---
While they're at it, give us more Nuka Cola stuff!
---
Did we just become best friends?
---
I'm on PS4, shoulda specified, my bad.
---
That’s not an issue with the Gatling gun skin, that’s an issue with all Gatling guns no matter the skin, so don’t blame it on the skin.
---
Also you knew what the rewards looked like, people have made many posts about the ghillie stuff. Why complain now? If you hit 100, you definitely saw the posts complaining about the bugginess of some of the stuff
---
The lighthouse near Vault 76 has one in the window along the staircase.
---
Seriously. You don't even see it with a fucking outfit which EVERYONE wears....the half ghillie outfit half jeans with few leaves on them from NW is 10x better
---
Thank you kind sir
---
Loyalties?
---
YUP!
---
It’s in the loading bay on the 3rd floor of the building locked behind a computer you’ll need to hack. if your on Xbox I can show you where to find some PA sets
---
Well, the economy of the game is so fucked it makes sense to give new players stuff.  I do it to drop some weight.
---
I can imagine the Bethesda creative meeting
---
-so we have like a bunch of spaces without rewards in the legendary run-
---
-we could add more atoms, you know, since we took down like 75% of the free atoms that we promise we'll give to players if they complete random challenges when we announced the atomic shop? -
---
-nah, what if we add a bunch of clipping plants to every Armour and make the same fucking shity paint for every power armor?-
---
-that is genius!, there, have some bugs-
---
Add a sleeping bag to the top bunk and you can use both the bottom and top.
---
I usually do "Imposter Encryptid start at xx:15 - join off profile"
---
Change the minutes to whenever you want to start, 3-5 minutes notice is plenty. As soon as you make your post, use your Keycard to notify your server and give free fast travel to anyone joining off your LFG post.
---
Wow really? I’m on Xbox one too.  I got the masks a bit ago and didn’t know what they was so either scrapped or sold them at the train station vendor lol I’ve just got another set plus the jumpsuits too, so might put them on for sale when I’m running low. Cheers.
---
Definitely the case, wastes too much ammo/aid for a bunch of scrap and some crappy weapon/armor just too scrip, I just want the fixer plan 😭
---
It seems like they make it once and never look at it again. Couple weeks ago the Slocum’s Joe items were half named wrong (Slocum Joe’s, Slocum Joe) like nobody told that week’s temp that “joe” is a word for coffee and not a guy.
---
It would be the easiest thing in the world to add the correct phrase to their content management system spellcheck but no
---
Unfortunetly if we followed that logic you'd think everyone also washes their hands every time they use the bathroom.
---
But everyone knows that is false AF.
---
Jukebox + half decent weapon = 100% WIN even solo
---
Bluegrass, folk music, and country music would perfectly suit 76.
---
Speaking or radio stations, I was thinking the other day, if survivors managed to rebuild functional radio stations then why have tv stations gone untouched? Like what if diehard Silver Shroud fans who survived the war rebuilt a television station in order to preserve their favorite show? It’s something I’ve wondered about when playing any fallout game.
---
No, only atom shop items are used in nw, thats how you select stuff is the atom shop menu
---
FO4 made me so happy because I could 3rd person the game without it feeling like crap. I'm vastly prefer 3d person. But it has issues in this game (still use it though). Your gun aim doesn't match the crosshair (every other 3rd person shooter gets this right ffs!). Sometimes it locks into ADS but goes back to normal view and only using the pip boy or running fixes it. AND I wish it would remember my zoom amount. having to re-zoom out after every fast travel is annoying af.
---
https://youtu.be/pZc75KwfOe0
---
Like rusty knuckles?
---
I know, I’d just absolutely love to have a freezing flamer for a burning cryolater! 😂
---
But the dangerous 5th effect looks so cool
---
You can't use the ghillie armor in nuclear winter- just the outfit.
---
Season rewards are all marked as Atom Shop stuff in Adventure, they all appear in the Atom shop, and most other rewards can be used in NW.
---
No joke. Dailies that have you rely on the RNG are the definition of stupidity.
---
Definitely going to try it next time round, thankyou!!
---
Psa if you choose herbivore you get best of both worlds. There's a cannibal perk card in end. 
---
To be an omnivore. Get herb mutation. Benefit from fruit/veg, eat rad x [suppresses mutations] and equip cannibal. Now eat alllll the meat for buffs.
---
Rad x deluded doesnt stack with rad x and the deluded doesnt affect mutation. So. Rad x--&gt; meat, rad x deluded --&gt;veggies. 
---
This allows you to be both carnivore and herbivore. Hence: omnivore
---
This one is easy, just log in and it will be completed for you. 
---
Just got hit with that bug for the first time, wonderful.
---
Want me to explain it to you? Okay, I can do that. 
---
Wastelanders comes out. You play it. You have a full set of T-51b, fully modded. You get the gold bullion for the SS jetpack and chest. You like it. The jetpack was the only reason you used the T-51b anyway, because your carry weight outside of power armor is tones better than inside power armor. Now that you have a jetpack, you don’t need power armor at all. And then, you find out from several, *several* people that the T-65 is good, yes, but only as good as what’s already in the game. So why would I want to spend the time collecting gold to get something that I practically already have? 
---
All that, just for you to say “yeah well 65 is better hurr durr”
---
No it isn’t. The fact oh how much it costs just to learn a single note is reason enough not to use it, brushes the fact that, again, I can carry more stuff with my SS armor and backpack.
---
The Overseers House has an ammo bag in her office btw, respawns fairly often.
---
Oh I don't know then, does it show any option on the bottom when you open it?
---
I use 3 points in Fix It Good to fix my PA to 200% and it seems I never have to repair it. I've literally fought 4 scorchbeasts at a time, logged out, forgot I was at the fissure site, logged in, killed more, come back later for the queen and never even thought about it. At most I think it removed the secondary health bar from one piece of armor.
---
So I removed it but still dont show up do I need to reset my game you think?
---
When I've been doing this event I was jumping on the instruments, but as a bloodied build was getting killed because the other players were not providing good coverage. So now I just cover other players.
---
What do you mean
---
If the stairs are in use/connected to something there doesn’t seem to be a way to remove them
---
I just use it to fix the tin can body suit once every 2-3 weeks mabey. Repair to 200% and put the card back in the stack for something useful like stabilized.
---
I’m roughly at 28, and the Run burnt me out of the game and I haven’t turned it on since I last place maybe a week or two ago. I’m tired and bored of it. That being said I’ll probably pay up until the coop since I have the income for it but I really don’t waste time just grinding the same 5 events over and over, doing the same score objectives over and over. I feel the Run had potential but then it fell apart with bad rewards (looking at the ammo converter) and just kind dumbing repetition
---
That's a negative good buddy.
---
Sorry, I didn't make myself clear. I meant that the first ghillie suit, the outfit, was ideal for NW, but the ones we've gotten since then don't have as much purpose.
---
Any.
---
Not unless you out other stairs connecting that floor first
---
I have a personal theory that all the "Atomic Onslaught" items were originally whipped up for Nuclear Winter as well as possibly the ghillie items.
---
Then they decided to switch to Seasons to make more money by removing Atom challenges and just threw all their future NW rewards into that.
---
I realized i still needed the 3 legendary challenge to be completed so with hopes of finding at least 2 legendary enemies i nuked white springs and ended up with 5 legendary spawning there! I made out with 2 really good 3 star drops!
---
Question, what does that acronym mean?
---
Well, that's a bummer. Hope someone else can help.
---
They didn't have the hydrogen bomb in the fallout universe.
---
Because things branched, and the transistor wasn't invented until the 2030s (our timeline 1960s) they were far behind on a lot of tech.
---
The helicopter (vertibird) was a breakthru in 2050, we made the osprey by 2000.
---
The universe is stuck in the early 1950s, technology hasn't advanced much past its advent. If it works, its good enough.
---
It’s not letting me do that either
---
The camp.kinda memorizes the order you put the floors up. And you need stairs to have an upper floor. Sometime, but not always, putting up stairs somewhere else, but attached to the same floor will allow you to remove the first stairs. But ultimately,  stairs are required for an upper level.
---
I'm sure you need to actually loot it. That's the only way they count for the challenges, too.
---
Stabilized, One Gun Army and the Heavy Gunner Cards. Power User as well if you're using Gatling Lasers.
---
You can make a 2nd connect point and remove the first one but yeah there must always be a connect point.
---
*(Eliding locations in case you spoiler the parent)*
---
I found the armor in that location, the door was already open, I haven't been to the location where you find the key.
---
My question is: when you use the key to unlock the door, does it disappear, meaning I'll have to go back and get the key again to check the armor location a second time? (I'm guessing that this is the same for all non-event keys/keycards/etc)
---
Not really the solution I'm looking for as that is not a working bunkbed, it's a current bunkbed with another bed on top of it. This is putting a bandaid on a gushing wound my friend. It kinda works, but it isn't the solution I'm looking for.
---
Not in my camp, but I've seen a mounted possum or ghoul head coming out of a TV that lit up. Looked interesting.
---
This and make the excavator amour lights changeable as well as using the chest ones.  That thing should make a cave feel like your standing outside in mid day light not so pitifully and painfully awful. The thing was created for mining it should have amazing lights.
---
-15 AGI would be a logical step too. Everything should be awared of ur presence 1 km away. But wait, u will lose ur action points. 
---
Can u understand that the most important thing is the balance? 
---
I see unbalance only refering to berserk build. I have 4 sets of PA and 1 unyielding set of scout armor for XP bonus and trading purpose. So ur guess is wrong.
---
Gotcha thanks!
---
Well actually now that I read up on it I didn’t realize heads count as limbs so I think I’m getting headshot dmg + 50% limb dmg + sneak dmg + instigating dmg?
---
Didn’t know that, thanks!
---
I think all the ghillie and Atomic onslaught items were originally whipped up for NW, but released with Seasons once they decided to make a change to Atom challenges.
---
Why else would a Cosmos-themed board have almost entirely non-Cosmos rewards?
---
Camp McClintock is a fairly decent source as well.  A few ammo bags and a military duct tape in the main building, a tape and bag in the barracks and a few bags in the live fire course.  Not a single enemy to deal with either.
---
Another easy spot is Clancy manor in the north of the forest.  Upstairs shelf has 3 rolls of tape and if you look around some wonderglue.  If anything it's better for adhesive farming, you should leave with at least 24 adhesive and 6 ballistic fiber.  Only a few low level cultists in there.
---
Exit build mode and try again or server hop
---
Are you on PC by any chance?
---
Icy Hot death and Flamecicle throwers lol
---
There isn't, and you do, unfortunately. I believe (please don't quote me) that diluted radaway only removes one at a time.
---
Impressive build!
---
T-51 has the best ballistic and energy protection but it’s not great with radiation protection like the X-01
---
Can't use the meat hook in PA yes?
---
Why do you need so much carry weight, need slot of stimpaks?
---
Now read about the Battle of Blair Mountain. It will blow your mind.
---
Na dann machts dir ja sicher nichts aus, dass ich jetzt unbanned bin und alles behalten habe. :)
---
B for Bloodied.
---
I'm guessing the 25's are for 25% faster fire rate and 25 extra damage resistance while aiming or reloading or something.
---
Might be wrong about the 25's, I'm not really into the whole trading scene.
---
I do 3rd person for exploration. I’m a shotgun build and for some reason my accuracy goes way down in 3rd person.
---
Thanks for the offer!  I'm a noob- how do I find you?
---
A super mutant that stares at you, admonishes you, and then closes the door again.
---
Just stacked and twisted the lowest coffee table, there's stairs outback holding up the 2nd floor. That's also how I have the extra halfwall for hight on the 1st floor.
---
Same trick to get the little garage area, the main house is foundations. The bar area is floors held by stairs
---
There's a guaranteed one at Alpine River Cabins, just go there.
---
if u have melee weapon which gives u +1 strength it wont work with PA?
---
Whoa... so much dick swinging down here.
---
And you got Pizza Place. Which is nice.
---
You don't earn shit in this game. It's all RNG.
---
Do you earn a jackpot at the casino?
---
Pretty much, some of friends duped and they just got their accounts back with no issues. The only thing Bethesda did was delete any holiday gifts they had in their inventories.
---
A level 1 perk is pretty minuscule in the grand scheme of things.  I also think the idea is pretty lore friendly and makes sense. Strength in numbers you know!! 
---
Anyhow,  thank you for the feedback.
---
Nah Xbox
---
No worries. When trying to get Fixer plans I was doing this and getting between 8 and 15 participants. As a Bloodied Sniper I just hopped on the roof and provided cover fire by clearing all the bots away from the Conduits. Then I'd put my damage in to the Imposter when he shows, then return to cover fire. Never failed a single attempt, and usually got a level up from the cover fire kills.
---
This seems like the most bearable explanation in terms of canon, but I think there's a few glowing ones in 4 that aren't hundreds of years old, but more newly turned. I want to say there's one in the Tunnel Snakes CC, and a few others I can't remember off the top of my head.
---
Honestly it’s not hard. Use the perk under perception and just take time to explore. As you wander you will come across them. I’ve found at least 10 in the past 2 days using the perk and exploring. I recommend walking to different locations and you can find them easily
---
You keep the key.
---
I would love to see a weekly faction quest( currently have foundation done and neighborly with raiders). But that would mean the vendors would need to increase how much notes you could spend a day as most people have a lot stockpiled already
---
Hate this event. The best experience I had was the first time I did it, fast traveled to it and it completed as I loaded in. Every other attempt is a shit show. Dead every five seconds, using all my stims and ammo up for nothing. Where's all those bitches who can one shot everything when you need em? 😅
---
Just hit 80 I think after this double score daily weekend I might just buy the rest I’m tired and want a break lol
---
Excavator provides the best buffs, +100 carry weight and 4x ore yield
---
Strangler heart gives poison damage and aoe.
---
The rest are just stat blocks that only provide marginal differences compared to each other
---
Ultracite, t-51, and Secret service give the best general defense, but only really gain you a small increase over other power armors.
---
Unless you are going for the two armors that give set bonuses (Ex/Sh) then the rest is purely a matter of what you have access to mods for.
---
Beyond that, aesthetics.
---
Select and confirm the ammo type to redeem for points.
---
Than instead of hitting confirm twice, hit back once which will take you back to the ammo select screen, than hit confirm again to redeem more points.
---
It saves loading two message screens and atleast one button press vs just spamming X, and imo I found it faster because the prompt screens load faster.
---
Thank you!
---
Sorry, I just realized I totally misread your question lol. As the other person said any PA works, the difference between them is minimal. You can probably just use whatever one is the most aesthetically pleasing to you.
---
This is the truth. Dupers usually have many, many accounts.  They've invested more into this game than most.
---
Found one first try.  Thanks!
---
Any is good but the best is t65 you get from secret agents in the gold vault
---
Thanks I will check that out
---
the first time i heard it i thought i was running through like some plant that hurt you or somthn. also it could just be me but doesn’t it usually play the hurt sound of the opposite gender of whatever your character is?
---
Cool. Gotcha. 
---
Yeah. It's really unfortunate. The idea of a ghillie suit is pretty cool on paper but really, what's the point? 
---
There are far better outfits/paints even if these actually worked as intended
---
Where do you get these masks
---
Somebody rolled up at my camp this morning wearing a furry waistcoat over CSS  .. HOW?
---
Yea not gonna lie I hit 80 last weekend and had a good amount of atoms saved up so I just said fuck it. It’s been great I made a new camp and have just been doing what I want to do.
---
They all work just fine buuuuuut....
---
Best defense T65
---
Best defense you dont have to grind GB for T51
---
Best offense Strangleheart
---
Best carrying Excavator
---
Rad resist difference is negligible honestly due to diminishing returns.  IE you won't really notice a difference unless you literally live in rad zones.
---
Haha sounds familiar. My last camp was on the side of a mountain with stairs going from the ground to the top (resource extractors on high and low side). Merchants would come and just go up and down the stairs forever, stopping for a while to use my benches or play guitar. Annoying af since they don't have anything worth buying.
---
Unless these challenges are intended to encourage people to explore and learn the map...
---
Everyone should run the percptibobble perk and the ones for magazines and cap stashes for a few days you’ll get to know where things spawn .. I haven’t run them for months but still pick up bobble heads , cap stashes and magazines everyday ..
---
Reckon I’ll grab a bobble head in 5 minutes when I log on tomorrow
---
&gt;serious MMO
---
I mean, you're right. But Fallout 76 isn't a serious game. It's a clown fiesta. I don't understand why they even pretend like they care about cheaters, exploiters, and dupers, because Bethesda so clearly does not care.
---
You need to be more specific
---
Thank you for being really respectful with teaching some info than the OP from that Americana post a couple weeks ago.
---
You're not your...
---
Two possible at sons of Dane compound, one on the concert stage, one on desk upstairs in the house.
---
One on a dresser, in bedroom at doddy sods 
---
One in bathroom at teapot house behind commode.
---
Cause you ducks can't hold a pylon for the dps guys
---
Presumably they don't want advantages in NW from items that will be unavailable to people after the legendary run season ends.
---
Steel you say?
---
I'm on it. Burned through 15k .50 cal yesterday
---
How dare you want a feature that was in fo4 day 1.
---
True. So only use it when repairing?
---
??? Wish I knew. I'd take a furry waistcoat just for a little variety. 
---
Maybe it was the chameleon thing where it only works if they're sitting still rather than CSS?
---
I tend to be pretty abrasive myself so I try to use my powers for good when I get the chance
---
pepperoni rolls are a real thing? well pack my bags
---
And you sir are sodium bicarbonate
---
Only bethesda can help to adding the feature back into the game.
---
Press the motion pad button on your ps4 controller while in your pip boy. The view changes to white lettering that is not too hard on the eyes.
---
I see plenty show up but no one activates the pylons.
---
Would you rather they be incompetent enough to see the error and not fix it or just that they didn't see it all? 
---
Six in one hand, half dozen in the other
---
Very helpful thanks!
---
People with friends
---
Come to my camp
---
I save fusion cells, 556, 45 and I'll throw up an occasional core if I pick up more than 3
---
Oh and shotty ammo
---
Toxic Larry’s has three bobblehead spots, and it’s an easy location to check if you FT to it (you just have to deal with 3 snallygasters)
---
Bottom floor: On the stove. 
---
Upper floor: On the drawers to the left of the bed. 
---
Roof: On the metal shelves
---
thanks for the advice!
---
I don’t understand his issue with just asking for help with perks lol
---
FYI No one else can hear it.
---
You're literally tooting your own horn.
---
Post up in the new bro area, my 10mm flies off the shelf there
---
Dove sono i giocatori italiani? Io voglio parlare con voooooiii, ma non ho trovato nessuno :(
---
I don't know what you are saying but like the others are saying "don't dupe"
---
Vats twice to hit something is a bandaid on a gushing wound. This is a minor aesthetic?
---
Edit: come on reddit dont downvote him/her for sharing their feelings! I actually liked the description albeit melodrama. :)
---
glad you find that funny.
---
Thanks for the info and I love how detailed u where thank you
---
Mine has never went below half but I’ll repair it when it does get to half to 200% then wait like a month to repair it again. I did the SBQ basically once a day and when I checked the duration after like 2 weeks the helmet, R Arm and L Leg went down like 5% of the bar the other pieces like 2%. 
---
For some reason my arms get hit the most.
---
What's your carry weight?  How are you carrying 500+ pounds of stuff?
---
I think this 4x a day easily. The rewards are more often hassles, and the lore dissonance is palpable.
---
I kinda Noticed the same last night. I did some daily quests and other small events but other than guided meditation I don’t recall many other major events pop up
---
The thing is, when I have to play NW (or the rare occasion when i WANT to) I will regularly drop armor, even good armors, because looking like a bush is so useful, *in that unique situation.* There's never a reason for me to use it in Adventure Mode, unless I want to dress up that way. I can't imagine why I'd ever want to wear that, especially since my armor gets hidden under my outfits.
---
The one exception I came up with is, well, I can't accidentally get rid of armor that has some paint or whatever on it. So I might actually apply it to some pieces if ghillie is the only mod I have for whatever that piece is.
---
TFW the paying community puts in more work to solve an issue than Bethesda do
---
Belethor is the bane of my existence. “Do come baaack...”
---
On Xbox, sometimes I have to hit X to transfer to see the materials are hiding there. It's not really empty, just looks that way. Maybe try that?
---
I know, it's way too much to ask
---
Yeah. I’m glad PA is so durable. Be stupid if I had to repair as much as I did with normal armor. (Not to mention the fact you sometimes get improved repair kits from the SBQ)
---
Pffff, testing things would imply that Bethesda developers make mistakes; are you suggesting that their godlike developers who can do no wrong would make mistakes? You must be a hater.
---
Same. Just submitted a ticket (btw. their ticket system is straight up garbage). If I didn't knew it was Bethesda and their usual bugs I would assume that this is intentional.
---
If you can get a shot in. Sometimes they’re dead before I can get to them. Remember, people are dicks at events
---
It was 14k. But they patched being able to still get it on Tuesday, I believed.
---
You can’t have it both ways. All you people mad that dupers are getting unbanned probably have a bunch of duped items in your inventory. Then as soon as you get banned for that you’ll be complaining that it isn’t fair.
---
Yeah I do use that as well, but when I am dropping stuff, people always leave thinking I am standing around haha. But I do like the HUD feature of it and it is less strain on my eyes when I do couple hour play throughs.
---
Flaming bowed chainsaws
---
Pretty much, or pretty much any other unarmed weapon. The plans could require one of those weapons to be used as an ingredient for the arm mod
---
GO BE A DICKHEAD SOMEWHERE ELSE!
---
Its isn't time efficient to get sure.  But in terms of defense, it is better.  What else do you want me to say?  It has better stats.
---
Still very helpful appreciate it a lot!
---
I never said that the idea would translate into being coded into the game in 5 minutes. I was trying to convey that if I, a random player who's job isn't too think of the game 24/7, could put forth a possible solution for a problem that's been in the game since launch, why is it that something for the problem doesn't exist at all? This problem has been here for almost 2 years. Bethesda has a thing for treating the symptom, not the underlying problem. 
---
For your example, sounds fine to me. If they can find a way to do it with accuracy at the moment of creation, I'm all for it. But they don't seem to be interested in that, just patching the individual methods when they get leaked to the public. 
---
For the support team, you're probably right. But it's frustrating that they aren't given the tools they need to do their job when the game has those tools available. They were perfectly able to do rollbacks when the inventory steal hack was out. 
---
As for me, I'm beta my dude. I was one of those guys that bought the power armor edition 10 minutes after it was announced that it was available the day after E3. I'm somewhere between 200-250. I don't care for grinding levels for levels sake like some of the other guys. I like to build my camp in different styles. And I grabbed one of the factories after I saw it in someone else's camp. My garage is designed to be next to an extractor, and it looked like a perfect opportunity to be in my preferred spot that doesn't have an extractor spot. I built one, fiddled with its position a few times, but ultimately decided against having one after it proved impossible to position. I didn't need it for ammo, I've got thousands of rounds for my weapons.
---
One in the locked room in the Nukashine as well
---
Not entirely true. I know a duper who still had gifts he and his friends were popping, offered me 1000 but I don't need caps for anything.
---
Where?
---
Thanks! Playing forever and didn’t even know Freddie’s had a basement
---
I have a gattling plasma and it gets the job done like you said. I’ve had less than 10 fights yet, I’m learning different ways. Thanks!
---
Bless you. This is going to same my sanity.
---
Too late. You took all the dickhead soots elsewhere
---
Don’t think they patched it yet still getting Halloween and Christmas rewards. 
---
Ty for info on xp👍
---
no legendary plasmas wernt brought into the game until after they removed explosive energy weapons
---
Lol this is hilarious.  At first I was thinking okay so many this person must actually be paying a well deserved compliment.
---
Just message me your Gamer tag and I’ll invite you to the game
---
jump -&gt; vat-&gt; shoot = way less misses
---
Buggy mess got annoying before Skyrim and Fallout 4
---
Why? When you get ore, you break it down
---
Well they were but only as 1* so they never rolled with explosive
---
Only things that give the same bonus from the exact same source are additive.
---
So for example troubleshooters armor pieces add together, because they all provide the same buff (15% robot damage reduction) from the same source (Legendary effect:  armor: troubleshooters). Meaning with 5 pieces you can get 75% reduction total.
---
But with perks the sources are different (perk: dodgy vs perk: lone wanderer), meaning they do not stack. 
---
Ultimately the only damage reductions that stack with one another are armor sets, all others multiply against one another, meaning you will get less effect out of each perk.
---
In theory there is no hard cap on total reduction, meaning you can reduce damage to 0, but you would need a single effect that totally negates all damage, for example if you had 7 troubleshooters armor pieces equipped (not possible without hacked items) giving 105% damage reduction.
---
In practice there are no effects which make you totally immune, you can still get some crazy damage reduction stacking though, as the way armor works makes it stronger the more damage reductions you apply before hand. You will still take damage, even if it takes multiple hits to add up to 1.
---
I got bitched out for oneshotting all 3 of the legendaries at uranium fever last night, causing the guy doing the bitching to get no legendaries. Since I am running low health it was obviously me, damn bloodied builds.
---
I got to the event 30 seconds before it ended, had just joined the server and saw the potential for easy treasury notes.  Never even fired a shot LMAO.  Still annoying to have some whiner bitching me out though because some players like screwing others out of legendaries. 
---
I dont care one way or another if I tag anything, don't even bother at events unless it spawns directly in front of me. Some lower level players are still trying to roll good gear, so I get why it's frustrating to some of them even though they sounded like a whiny bitch :)
---
I logged at around the same time, had 0/5 dailies (?) one of which was a NW one so I went there to do it, logged back on the game and now I have 7/9.
---
And the worst is that they got the balls to ask people to pay 150 atoms to complete each step ... I'm starting to believe that this bug was intended to boost the sales.
---
I hope at some point a Mothman skin gets released that makes it look like wings.
---
If you go to overseer rank reward on the fallout wiki, it will have all the xp requirements for everything NW related
---
Upton Sinclair also wrote *Oil!* - the book There Will Be Blood was inspired by. TWBB starts off with mining but quickly moves into oil, not sure there's any mining in the actual book. Despite being about different industries I think you're right: Sinclair's socioeconomic stories fit pretty perfectly when considering the Fallout universe. 
---
TWBB gets a lot of flack for two things. One is the [dialogueless opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3O-OEem3XM) ~15 minutes in the mine - but I think the tense, lonely atmosphere is perfect (and reminds me of FO). The other is how unlikable both the protagonist and antagonist are (I think the only person you're really meant to root for without question is the son, whose book equivalent was the protagonist of *Oil!*). TWBB really works for me because Paul Thomas Anderson finds Sinclair's least favorite societal ills that were also themes of the book (capitalism and christianity), throws them in a pit, and lets us all enjoy the schadenfreude of watching them tear themselves apart in a vicious way the book doesn't - but I'll admit I never studied Sinclair/film formally and might not have the best interpretation of it. I think FO fans might also pick up on and enjoy that element so if they can't pick up one of his books maybe they could try a semirelated film?
---
Fun fact: Sinclair founded the CA chapter of the ACLU.
---
They had all these skins leftover from Survival challenge, so they tossed them into the Space Theme battlepass.
---
There are more to come. Watch and see Trapper armor and more weapon skins sneak in soon.
---
Toot toot!

If your referring to me as a "duck" majority of the time I hold down 2 pylons minimum so the dps guys can focus on the imposter, always take around 50 stims with me
---
That’s ok you get double score this weekend...even though you can’t get double score.
---
I do have hunting rifle level 1 5 and 10 available, just wondering when level 15 and 20 become available.
---
Didnt Juicehead say in a recent one that none of those people seemed to have gotten banned?
---
Makes sense since they wouldn’t want a legit way to take no damage (no god mode glitch) thanks for the great explanation.
---
What level of incompetence does the studio have to reach before people start getting fired?
---
Cool thanks
---
"I have mastered the art of standing so, perfectly still..." *chomp*
---
I genuinely chuckled. Sorry!
---
In hindsight this was incredibly obvious, I was very tired yesterday lol
---
Dude! I'm keto. What's the recipe?
---
Yup.
---
I think u/VaultBoyFrosty is the Simp lord we've been looking for
---
This is not exclusive to the coal mining industry.  The textile industry in the New England and Northeastern areas of the US had the same in the 19th Century industrial boom.
---
You lived in a "company house", purchased goods from the "company store", went to the "company doctor", all of which was deducted directly from your paycheck or you were allotted "scrip" you could use at the company store.  The industry basically owned you.
---
There are still many old "company row houses" scattered across NE, near the old textile industry centers, that have been converted to condos and such.
---
Shit I’m the same way. It’s not a fallout game if I don’t carry everything. So I just know crafter a t65 but I’ll never use it because with my excavator I can carry 575 with ribeye steak buff. Without it I can carry 580 but problem is I have weapon weight reduction on my one leg so when I get in my power armor I’m over weight by 20 now. Ugh the life of a hoarder is real
---
lol sad but true.
---
&gt; One in bathroom at teapot house behind commode.
---
Can't tell you how many times I've nabbed this one after the event!
---
You’re right. It’s just a game. Fuck it. Let everyone do whatever the fuck they want in it. It doesn’t affect me or you. Un-ban everyone who’s ever broken a rule because it’s just a game with no bearing on the real world.
---
Let me know if you have any other questions. I love big guns and feel I have the process of using them down and a good build to back it up.
---
You Flatter me!
---
What does it actually do?
---
Yes, of course. I always forget about the place.
---
I did it a few times myself to some friends. I also miss survival. I miss elements of survival but the leaderboard thing was dumb. Most of us did what we could to stay off of the top. We just wanted to wander with some anxiety.
---
yeah... well, it's called "the art of understatement" ;)
---
Well said now lets burn the heritics
---
Tried the backpack for 20 secs. I thought it looked terrible and reverted back
---
I've said it before and ill say it again the interns need to be taken off this game and actual devs should work on this game. There are so many issues its insane how this game has survived its ridiculous how many bugs and issues we all deal with on a daily bases. It seems like Bethesda doesn't even test the stuff they release. The only reason this game is even alive is because of the community. If it weren't for us they'd have lost millions at the start and dropped all support. I have nothing against Bethesda besides the fact that they don't give a flying f*** about us just the stupid atomic shop sales. We get mediocre cosmetics for stupid weapons the the fat man and dragon yet non for weapons that are actually used daily. I wish the community would set a fire under Bethesda and get them into high gear with this game i love this game i have 1600 hours on it and im losing faith in this game because of the issues it has and lack of support from the company.
---
The community is pretty divided around duping right now. The B2525 fixer was massively duped so I assume this guy thought you had one of those. Either way, he seemed unnecessarily angry.
---
Awesome will do thanks
---
Looked like CSS .. but I may be wrong .. I'd wear a scabby mole if it meant I could look a bit more unique in game 😏
---
Any that exist aren't legitimate.
---
You can PA glitch through anything so..
---
max cap'd
---
You’re missing my point. I’m not mad the people were unbanned. I’m irritated that there is no consistency. They should do one or the other to all offenders. Which one doesn’t matter to me one bit.
---
Camp building and PVP
---
It already has gone back to legacies everywhere on trade forum. I haven’t seen any in any vendors on Xbox tho but if you go over to marketplace it’s everywhere
---
US-13c Bivouac next to Wes tek can have one in some of the tents there as well
---
Yes! I took my time with it and looking back I'm glad I did. You're "setting yourself back" in regard to one grind especially but honestly friend, that shit isn't going anywhere. No need to rush toward it. 
---
Bit of advice though, if you intend to craft the new gauss weapons or secret service armor, start setting aside legendary modules now.
---
When are your mules on?  I've had the PC one in my friends list for weeks and have not seen it online.
---
Are we the same mind? 125, no nuke fired. Barely did the vault raid. Like one or two side quests. Hello fellow filthy casual :)
---
Player trading or having the luck of a Greek God.  Those are your two options.   It's all RNG.
---
On the top bunk of a bed in one of the cabins. I can't pinpoint the exact one but there are only four so its not difficult to find.
---
You mean three sources of acid?
---
Genuine question.
---
How do you play long enough to reach the 30k cap, but don't know about the 30k cap?
---
Unrelated, but what do you usually list the Nuka Paint around? I can never find consistent pricing metrics.
---
How?
---
It sucks right? It should be much more than that. 30k is so easy to make.
---
FYI. Same thing will happen if you try to script pass 1k.  You'll get the same kind of message.
---
Thanks for the reply! When it comes to spending my legendary scrip, should I just go all in on the 3 star boxes?
---
One of my prize possessions,  bought it when I thought atoms would be easier to come by, but never regretted it. 
---
Unlike the vampire outfit. Thought I was going to see a preview,  ended up buying...
---
Hey OP, neat post. Most of my Dad’s side family is from West Virginia, and let me tell you they definitely love their miner’s history. I grew up watching a couple movies about this, and I definitely recommend Matewan. It’s an awesome drama about the struggles of the miners trying to unionize to protect themselves from the mining companies. I’d give it a watch if you are ever able, it sounds like it would be right up your alley ☺️
---
You need to remove it and then move your camp again to fix it.
---
I have multiple plans and outfits, and I go to every one that pops up. Good XP and Treasury notes, and those items sell great! A lot of people just don't seem to understand the event, and end up wasting a lot of mats, so they don't bother. Any new person I play with , my team teaches them how to run it so they can save supplies and not be out too much- even if the event fails. A heads up on here is a great place, as well as if you have a mic, going up to groups and letting them know you're about to do it.
---
Market sub, vending machine, purveyor, possibly me, I’d have to check but I think I held onto a 1* for just this occasion. I’m Xbox.
---
i don't even bother to submit a ticket. I know they will do nothing.
---
buy one from another player..
---
RNG might take a while..
---
if youre determined to roll the purveyor for one.. I would suggest rolling for 2* so you get more rolls
---
Spend spend spend
---
My 4200 hours in game supports your research.
---
This is definitely a troll lol
---
thank you for letting us know.
---
If you don't run Escape Artist, you're bad at the video game.
---
Oh ok thanks I was just literally thinking about that.
---
Ive been playing Fallout ever since the first one was released on PC in 1997. Yes im old and the damn deathclaws need to stay off my lawn. Anyway, the game has evolved and gone though many changes. Im glad that Bethesda has put so much work into the series since it took ownership and made it such a great experience in todays online world. I only have one warning for those of you that never played the originals. Don't eat the iguana bits. Look around the world, there aren't any iguanas.
---
I got stuff last night on an alt. Not patched and the last rewards Ghillie suit are active again too.
---
this isn't a new bug.
---
wait, I've been getting scrap kits? I could have used those to complete dailies for atoms, back when dailies gave atoms
---
That would be extremely resource intensive, between the writing, design and testing it’s not really feasible.
---
As others have mentioned, equip the Percepti-bobble perk and google search for common bobblehead spawn locations.  FWIW, I found mine in the agriculture building near Flatwoods.
---
Lol. Hide.
---
Your comments seem to suggest you don’t hate PvP as much as you say but you deleted them so I can’t really see them, hmmmst curious
---
Eh, as far as i know it still is, Yes
---
1 quest every four weeks isnt hard with a team as big as Bethesda
---
That he did
---
Ah, so that’s what the kids are calling it these days.
---
There's 3 possible spawns in Tyler county fairgrounds. One in pumpkin shed, one near big bottle, and one near the hoop games near the token machines.
---
Just got to DM me. I am online now
---
I appreciate that but I'm on PC wompwomp
---
I would save scrip for legendary modules for crafting the SS armor and/or gold bullion weapons.
---
There are literally hundreds of possibilities so the odds of you even getting a Lever action let alone one with the stats you want is slim.
---
If you do want to roll mystery picks though I'd go 2 star until you have all good 2 star gear as you get a better bang for your buck.
---
Watoga is crawling with bobbleheads.
---
And I've just seen its double score so it really sucks
---
Here's [a map](https://map76.com/lvli/lpi_loot_bobbleheadslvli0001911d) showing spawn locations.
---
I think it's possible that it could be considered an exploit because the reason that this event occurs is that another player is putting a tent on one of the spawn points, and the game doesn't know how to deal with that so it just says fuck it and just throws them right on top of the siren
---
How in the world is it difficult to make it when you click on a function (Fast Travel) it works. Like when I open my pip boy menu it doesnt accidently NOT work. When i click crouch it doesnt accidently NOT work. When I want to go to the map so i can exit game it works EVERY. SINGLE.TIME.
---
Whatever conflicts are tied in to fast travel just remove them already. There should not be one single element that can affect when you click on fast travel, you DONT fast travel. Untie all the elements that effect this. Just make.it.happen
---
So basically, an old school dungeon crawl.
---
Yeah, I always check for it too
---
I've known people far more FU in real life, so this possibly being a legit post would NOT surprise me. Sometimes people just need a positive nudge.
---
This is just wrong. Where are they going to get the resources from? It would be nice, but completely unrealistic. Downvote me if you will but it doesn’t change reality. How many people do you think they have working on this by the way? Since you said they have a large team.
---
Welcome to the club. We got t-shirts and cake.
---
Why you need to do 3 instead of just 1 is insane.
---
Idk why this was downvoted. You're right.
---
I think I have a instigating faster fire rate lever action if you’re on Xbox.
---
Wait, what? In what way is it easy?
---
Sheepsquatch fur has ballistic fiber as well.
---
I honestly wasn't sure if they could still do it or not, so they always became priority target just in case. Good to know I don't have to immediately dump everything I've got into those glowing green turds.
---
choose the one you think looks the coolest. most people use Excavator due to the free carry weight bonus. i personally use the Strangler Heart PA due to managing to craft it before they closed down the vault raids. (even if they did nerf it, i ain't gonna give it up any time soon)
---
Awesome, I'll go see if there's a line :)
---
Are you real or just another corner bombing bot
---
I had a similar experience hiding in a bus ha
---
When I started a new character I pretty much beelined it for the scout camp. Honestly I wish there was a way to skip the tadpole too, because even trying to optimize things there's so many possum challenges that just require repeating what you already did.
---
Good luck. The lever is best.
---
Some people aren’t fans of sarcasm.
---
It sucks ass, takes 5 seconds to destroy a car
---
Have you tried placing one in a display case? I got one to compliment my pet deathclaw but I was unable to put it in the display case. I ended up looking up the location of a cracked deathclaw egg and used that instead.
---
After a certain point it is. I always try not to go above 20k now as i have some stuff in my vendor for 4-6k and it's easy to go over if the right person comes along.
---
BUT i understand why there is a cap limit.
---
I have a spending problem... Linked to a collect everything problem. 
---
I also knew of the cap limit, but thought it was higher.
---
Oh man, there was actually quite a few mining songs from the 50’s-70’s, around the same time “trucker songs” became a thing. 
---
But speaking of random songs to know here’s one of mine (hehe). [Springhill Mining Disaster by The Dubliners](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DEb9s0CR784)
---
I’m just an American listening to Irishmen sing about a Nova Scotian mining disaster.
---
I’m sure it will cost the entire yearly budget of the United States to make a 10 minute quest
---
Selling things. I sell stuff to the vendors everyday. And ammo to players, etc. You can make 30k in 7 days, 10 days. And without making much effort.
---
Adrenaline is still bugged and is supposed to be fixed in the next update.
---
Luck of the draw was supposed to be fixed in patch 19 I think, but I've never used it with heavy weapons before.  I tested it with commando weapons recently and it doesn't trigger very often...so its not worth using IMO.  I use Gunsmith rank 5 and repair my weapons to 200% with rank 3 Weapon Artisan instead.
---
You are aware that the game is supported by the Austin branch right?
---
Yea you can’t go to wv lumber yard yet. Just do events on the western side of the map. Explore the toxic valley and ash heap thoroughly.
---
Thanks for your answers everyone!
---
I lost about 40k’s worth of inventory when I realised this the first the first time. I’m now prepared to quickly log out when it reaches very near to the amount!
---
No..  I swap weapons all the time and I don't want my perks swapping with them.  That's just a recipe for  additional weapon swap bugs. 
---
I would rather have saved decks.  
---
However, they could do both with the option to turn the weapon swapping one on or off.
---
Buying from a player does not work.
---
I wish the club had score
---
Plus I have the sasquatch plushie on the bed, and its positioned so it looks like its giving us both headpats lol
---
Yeah, I was so scared! I always tag along with my husband whenever he plays, but he had to go and I was left exploring on my own that day 😂
---
As an American, the only thing I didn't know about was the Scrip. That makes legendaries way cooler.
---
I don't know what a corner bombing bot is
---
Yes, by the time I reach 20k I start spending too. Lol
---
PC here, but thank you anyway!
---
I had a lvl 399 kill me yesterday on there
---
Try to get yourself a set of power armor and do the Scorchbeast queen quest or Line in the Sand. Get a fast firing gun and as much ammo as you can and just pop them and let the big boys finish them off.  There are some events that are like lvl 30ish that'll net you some serious XP and some gear. I was personally struggling because I was doing a heavy weapons/PA build but didn't have heavy weapons or PA. Now that I have them both its just smooth sailing.
---
Only on pc cause they where spawned in. If a guy on xbox offers you one he is lying
---
If we're addressing jetpack skins, can we please have PA skins apply to their jetpacks as well? The shiny gray jetpack doesn't look great slapped on my pretty Nukashine X-01.
---
If all you want is an instigating gun just but 1 Star, but odds are not good looking for a specific gun from that slot machine
---
I remember my first day, got to level 5, went to Charleston and a group of player started shooting at me, I didn't know how pvp worked so I fired back, and got totally obliterated, then on the map they didn't appear, so I just guessed that they took off, and spawned back on Charleston, got obliterated again. Later I found out that when you block a player you don't appear on their map.
---
To this day I don't understand why they killed me, didn't even have a reward on me.
---
What?
---
Sorry I ment a undertaker rip off my b
---
Ouch, and i thought me losing 2500 score (or is it 5000? dunno if the double is displayed) was bad.
---
It's okay though because Bethesda is "logging" the issue ¬_¬
---
I ran out of bullets and hid, eventually he got bored and left 😂
---
Sunny top ski lanes. Run the obstacle course over and over again.
---
How about the heart shaped bed from Joana's Room at the Gomorrah in Fallout New Vegas? :)
---
Similarly to how people reach 700+ hours and still haven’t launched a Nuke
---
Just like that big horn from the atom shop... what a waste..
---
Only the cool club has score. Welcome to the B team!
---
Poop son, they wont even apologize to me for the bug let alone give me atoms to replace the lost rank (now passing 10k points)
---
I don't see anything
---
Ah ok. Thanks for the info. I have 4 points to put somewhere (not Str or Int) and was wondering what I should do. My Special is S: 15.   P: 2.   E: 4.   C: 4.   I:15   
---
L: 8. 
---
I’m a solo player so the only charisma perk I use really is Lone Wanderer.
---
If an ally or traveling merchant is occupying ur benches just interact with them to get them off but dont talk to em and just nab the bench real quick works everytime like a mystical charm 😉
---
What would recommend instead? I’m only 53 so looking for additional options.
---
Good to know, thank you!
---
I like Nuclear Winter. Not all the time but I usually do play at least a match a day. 
---
I actually hotkey whatever armor I have and the ghillie suit so that I can quickly switch between them on the fly
---
Ok so i jumped back on. Arms, chest, head are over 70% condition. Legs are about 30%.
---
Guess i should repair them at some point this week. And at 200% they sure do last a while.
---
It is actually.   
---
Until now, the bug occured if you were ingame during the day reset. 
---
Now it occurs no matter what.
---
After a certain point you cannot stop making caps. Assuming of course you sell stuff in your vendor or on a trade forum. 
---
I've had people come to my camp and drop 20k on asylum uniforms. or but a silly amount of serums. I then have to go and buy random shite to get rid of caps.
---
I feel like they'll be "logging" the issue forever
---
Because "well all their games are broken and have to be fixed by unpaid modders" is a good reason to be okay with the game having a ton of issues 🙄
---
Bobbleheads have dedicated spawn locations and you can get them by server hopping. I mean yeah, it's RNG if it will be there, but it's like the absolute lightest form of RNG in the game. Getting one isn't hard, but hey people will cry about anything they need to dedicate a single ounce of effort for.
---
The entirety of Bethesda isn't working on FO76. It's more like 3 guys and a dog in Austin.
---
That's fine, I just cancelled the F1st subscription. They take my dailies? I take their monthlies!
---
Is this PC exclusive?  I've never had this on Xbox.
---
This is what awaits us all. Our endgame. That's depressing.
---
Damn, I'm always on the B Team!
---
It's been happening post-reset for weeks.
---
Yeah. Basically I just do 200% and forget about them. I’ve never seen my PA break completely.
---
Thanks for the tip! Didn't know that
---
Good luck it's all RNG and very poor chances.  That ones a super popular gun for rifle builds so welcome to the grind.  Seriously, it could happen if luck grants you a wish but no before hand that the % chance you get exactly what you want is really low. I wish you the best of luck I really do,  I just want you to be prepared for the long haul.
---
Yeah I showed up to a fight last night quickly because I saw a bunch of people higher level than me (I’m 125) and I figured I miss it if I wasn’t quick. Then they all sat on the base while she flew around and I was the only one standing out in the middle of the field trying to get her to land while they all unloaded at her in the air. Except I guess none of them had anything to do a lot of damage cause her health bar remained relatively untouched. Then the event failed and she hadn’t even had the legendary reset. It was a mess
---
How have you finished it already?
---
Lol. This sentence still makes zero sense
---
Fissure Site Prime seems to spawn legendary Scorchbeasts pretty frequently, so if you've got a persistent nuke zone lingering around after an SBQ run, check it out and see if you can get some to spawn there.  WesTek usually has one either right outside the front door, or to the right as soon as you enter through the terminal-locked door.
---
you just knew a game without modder support was going to be rough   lol
---
excuse me ma'am but i believe your slip is showing.
---
I found a legendary noxious Sheepsquatch at level 12 when I was out with a friend took like 40 minutes to kill it. I got a mutants laser pistol.
---
So it's ok for bethesda to do nothing then?
---
Glad to know it’s a good choice at least! I’m having a lot of fun so I don’t mind the grind I just don’t want to feel completely useless when it comes to endgame. All of the comments have been helpful thanks for taking the time to give a newbie some insight.
---
I just had all but one of the adventure mode daily double score challenges autocomplete for me. Cba playing now!
---
Dude if you think this is bad you should see what is happening with mine, the ghillie bit of the armor just floats, totally detached, and unmoving off the armor.
---
I'd have 3 points in PER so you can pick level 3 locks.  But without seeing all of your perks, its hard to give other suggestions.
---
You can try posting your build using this website: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
Yeah man, my guns were broken or out of ammo.  I made one last stand with my cultists’ dagger to disastrous results
---
Short question, how did you guys hit 100 already?
---
It doesn't matter when you log in. Two days ago I logged in 6 hours after reset.
---
The bug will hit you no matter what. There's literally nothing you can do to avoid it completely.
---
Someone get Bethesda on the phone!😂
---
Friends will get bored and quit. No more endgame and everybody else has your special laser too.
---
Idk if it still works, but white spring resort can spawn low level ghouls which are decent for leveling. And if you take armor off and go full force with melee you will level up fast enough without breaking armor. Also probably die a lot so store junk.
---
Yeah it seems to work for a minute to get them off of the benches but I just want them to leave!
---
Last night the merchant wandered around everywhere going up stairs, into my log cabin, everywhere and the whole time the turrets are shooting furiously.
---
I would like a choice in “interact” where I can send them away.
---
My pleasure!
---
Hey dude I think I have an I/25 Lever and an I/e Lever, I'm logging on now to check if I still have them.
---
Fantastic attempt at gaslighting there.
---
Obviously I didn't say or imply anything remotely close to that, but solid try nonetheless.
---
Welcome!
---
I have a I2525 lever rifle if you're on PS4
---
Thats cool I never considered my gear special and ive played with the same 2 guys since december of 2018 so no luck in the quiting part
---
Got to find raw flux and combine it with other things
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Flux](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Flux)
---
That’s adorable. I’m a little obsessed with the Sheepsquatch plushie, not gonna lie. It’s so freakin cute haha
---
You have to craft it at the chem station once you farmed the nuked zones.
---
Isn't that a free skin on the legendary run? I don't see why you'd need to pay atoms for it lol.
---
I would even welcome a basic mission like the ones seen in train stations “My brother was eaten by a Sheepsquatch” etc. Just something to do
---
Ahhh! Okay!
---
to convert raw flux to stable flux you need Hardened Mass, Glowing Mass, and High Radiation fluid. all of them can be found from killing enemies that spawn in rad zones. stable flux is a junk item.
---
One in the low shelves behind the gift shop sales counter in Dolly Sods, if you turn right when you enter the building (past the Possum Scout robot). Warning: nasty bear out front.
---
The helmet is available in the Captain Cosmos bundle with the orange suit
---
I commend you on your bravery 😁
---
I like it. Wish it would be a little more accessible from the ground to male it a vendor camp though. Would extending the foundations on the first floor outwards be possible?
---
The battlepass is 10 bucks in CoD and gives you back 1.5× what you spent, meaning you could in theory buy one and never need to pay for one again.
---
Riiiight ok so that’s why it’s more of an endgame-y kind of ingredient
---
1. Drop from SBQ  
---
2.  Farm herbs from the nuclear zone and craft flux (u also will need some more scrap that drops from mobs in nuclear zone), like this:  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Stable\_violet\_flux](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Stable_violet_flux)  diff is only on types of raw flux  
---
stable is actually pure
---
I hate all the tactical stuff they keep adding, it's even less fallout-y than a plush sheepsquatch.
---
I had my first bugged score challenges today also. I had the same issue with atom challanges 2 times couple months ago. Luckily i only lost 4 out of 9 challenges this time. 2500 score.
---
Bethesda even doesn't want tickets about this issue. When you try to make an ticket in "in game issues - challenge" there is this comment (didn't include the whole text as it describes completely different issue) *"If you are experiencing an issue where you are not getting your S.C.O.R.E. points other than the above mentioned reasons, please submit a* *Feedback report here* *under "Quests". Make sure to include screenshot(s) or video of the S.C.O.R.E. and Challenge that you are reporting."* Following the link it takes you to feedback section, and i know they are not reading those. I made both, a ticket (even if they didn't want it) and a feedback about the "quest".
---
In a Nuked Zone, pick up various plants for Raw Flux. You'll also want to kill some enemies in there too as you'll need High Radiation Fluids, Glowing Masses, and Hardened Masses. You'll need 10 of a single colour of Raw Flux, and one each of the other items. Take them to a Chemistry Station and go to Nuked Flora and there you can Stabilize it and make it "Pure"
---
They definitely need to add other ways to earn rep.
---
I second this. Events are your best friend for getting ez XP. Just make sure you hit the enemies before they die. Line in the sand, uranium fever, and radiation rumble are the ones to keep an eye out for.
---
I tried to fight the scorchbeast queen when I was a lower level and never did enough damage to get any drops or XP when she died (I think it's 1k minimum) so that might be a bit of a pain to try.
---
I just checked and I have both I mentioned above. I'm on PC, if you add me (IGN NukeJockey) you can have the I/25 for free. Just let me know your username so I can add you back.
---
Sweet thanks, I never check there
---
Or we could have zero challenges and no way to earn atoms
---
Got it guys! Farm the nuke zones! Should be.. no problem.. I’m not worried about 50 glowing ones eating me 😅
---
I would have thought they would have atleast another S.C.O.R.E double xp weekend the last week of the event or even a triple one to get people across the finishing line
---
If you like I can make you a vid and prove it!!!
---
I have a Vampires Explosive and a Two Shot Explosive and they absolutely shred everything. I don’t even use them on regular mobs, it’s a waste of fuel.
---
Well I am trying to understand why it's relevant to answer that the bug is not new, since the main issue is \*the bug\*... new or not.  
---
(and especially when they said they hotfixed it.)
---
.
---
You cant compliment bethesda.
---
Simply you need to farm load of high rad fluids,glowing mass and hardened mass first. 
---
Nuke white springs or some other densely populated area and kill everything. Each one has a chance to drop some of the above. After you have farmed enough then start to collect the raw flux's. 
---
Make sure you have green fingers on for collecting and superduper on for crafting.
---
You can buy it as well but most people don't want to sell =0 
---
Most people want trades. Like myself. I don't need caps so if i want to sell something i ask for flux
---
We all know those legendaries are cheapos 😂 It's the bragging rights and the experience that counts 😁
---
Lol! It actually proofed goood. It looked "solid" even after baking, but taking it out of the oven makes the sides to collapse, lol.
---
You might get hosed on the queen herself (happened to me more than once) but the spawn of the Scorched, mirelurks, monsters, and other scorchbeasts make up for it. Plus if you're there you're gonna get some gear just from completing the event. Thats where I got my first laser minigun and I've yet to look back.
---
Awesome lol.
---
Gets me hyped for the Tony Hawk remake on the way.
---
Last one I went to was close to a fissure site. I just went and aggroed a SB and ran back and hid in his camp while it and the scorch it spawned destroyed his camp for me. He spawned in to me sitting in a chair giving him the thumbs up and a wrecked base.
---
You're welcome, I'm a collector of unique/specific stuff, so I've been looking for a black or green mining helmet for a while, was happy I found one. But now I need to find the green one lol. Feel free to share any collection tips of your own, and I'd love to see what else you've collected.
---
You're awesome! Username is Charlesakis
---
Rad
---
Yeah but only to a certain extent, can't reach the main roof to the main building from up there... Maybe someone can make a stairway close enough for a jump but idk
---
Thank you very much but I'm on PC!
---
I tried this one:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHJdHPKAMXg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHJdHPKAMXg) 
---
He uses like a cup of (pure) gluten so I guess it is more like dirty keto. The whole thing has like 30g net carbs but it lasts me like a week unless my spouse punishes it sooner. I dont add xanthans gum or sweetener. I like it, it does not taste like eggs or cheese. :'D
---
Lol I'll take a pic and post it later when my gf gets on. The flamethrower trap is so helpful for glitching camp items together
---
Thanks! I haven’t quite gotten my head around all the various perks yet
---
A stronzo ma che cazzò voi
---
Not to mention how quickly they break.
---
Yeah it just ideas I was having just hope they don't make some horrible loadout system that is terrible to use.
---
Depends on your build and what you are doing.  If I'm mining I use the Excavator for the extra ore you get when using it.  I'll usually throw on my X01 when grabbing flux in the nuke zone so it has its uses for sure especially early on in the game.
---
Ooo io sono italianoooo oooo
---
Killing Legendaries and finding Bobbleheads has nothing to do with effort. It depends entirely on luck, that's my point. Encouraging people to hop servers is really not a good mechanic but if you want to defend that, go ahead.
---
Kill a player is easy. The bots land in a specific spot. Land there kill them.
---
:)

Not rare but there’s something odd to note about it. The pipe rifle has 2 automatic receivers chambered in .38. The first is just “automatic receiver” and the second is “automatic .38 receiver”. The second one does LESS damage than the first one with no upsides or reason to exist. I discovered this a little while ago and haven’t been able to make any sense of it.
---
Didn't someone datamine a Ghillie Stealth Suit a whole ago? Because what a stealth suit really needs is *camouflage*
---
Cant place the CAMP module lower? I know you can usually build 5 levels up or down from where your module is I think.
---
Didn't they also have a ceiling fan light back in the day?
---
Can you buy them and have it count
---
I'm a junkies shotgunner and I'm loving it! I can one shot most enemies now. My husband gave me a Fixer as well 😁
---
4 out of 9 completed here. First time on the season, luckily. Had the auto complete 2 times in the past months on atom challenges and they rewarded the missing atoms when i made a ticket both times. Apparently they don't do that with score. Fucktards.
---
Yeah I noticed that when I finally got the rarer of the two. I was really hoping it rechambered it in 45 but no such luck. I wonder if that was the intention and they just fucked it up somehow

---
Let me rephrase now I know what the deal is: if you’re on Xbox and wanna help me farm some of this stuff, send me a PM!
---
Not true.  I was looting her at level 45.   
---
Granted, I had a  gatling laser and/or mini gun doing 2 to 3 damage (turn on damage display) per bullet on a new character.  The fire rate is good enough that you can usually get up to 1000 damage as long as you have enough ammo and enough time and only shoot her when she is on the ground.
---
For the gatling laser you can farm fusion cores by doing the power up event at the power plants, taking over the yard workshop, and powering up the fusion core generator. 
---
The guns were drops from super mutants and also found in the game.  Eventually I got a .50 cal and primed it.  
---
I have to admit though, that while i didn't give my new character any good weapons, choosing to play through the first 100 levels with just drops, i did give it a ton of plans, including the .50 cal prime automatic receiver plan.  You should be able to find it in player vending machines, though.
---
Nothing wrong here, move on.
---
I have this problem as well, and by god if it has a screw in it I'm taking it even if I have to throw out weapons I could sell for caps, lol.
---
“It just works”
---
right, and it's the same thing over and over.  non aggressive scared and running, aggressive want to eat you and attack you.
---
asylum uniforms? Why, and for how much?
---
Try your luck with purveyor. Tuesday night I had 300 scrip and rolled 3 3 star bloodied guns in a row. But it doesn’t always happen like that. Last night I got all crap I don’t want.
---
Because your thread title is misleading, so I was making sure people understood this isn't a new bug to look out for. It's the same bug many of us have been experiencing for weeks now. 
---
Also, they said they issued a fix for most cases of it, but that it had not been completely solved.
---
Bless you sir
---
Hackers are almost solely on PC, are you on console?
---
Enjoy. :)
---
Hit me for the first time today as well.
---
Well my camp is near the miners monument, I check there every now and then, just now found a grey one! Don't have any other tips for you unfortunately, I just randomly found the helmets throughout my travels. I will let you know if I find another green one, happy to share it then, when you are on pc that is
---
This is my modified build. What I would use in battles and stuff.

---
Anything you’d change? I’m a Heavy/Explosive PA build.
---
Fuck sakes :(
---
I can get on later and build them for you. But they are kinda buggy. They cant have wallpaper applied to them, and require a pressure pad or some switch, as at least 1 power connector as well. I've tried to make it look pretty but without being able to add wall paper its meh.
---
I think Communism is the closest we are getting to real world evil in FO76...
---
Any of them really the difference in resistances makes a negligible difference on the damage you take. SH games did a good video showcasing this.
---
Rad resistance makes some difference when in a rad zone. 
---
If you run bloodied then make sure you fit emergency protocols to the chest piece.
---
there's a thread below where we are discussing this.
---
I heard people can take all your stuff through a hack if you trade them
---
Lol. Yep. At this point I don’t even know why I tag certain junk items...I’m picking up everything anyway! 😂
---
You are getting double score. They're normally worth 250, now it says 500.
---
Indeed it is!! 😂
---
There are 2 Bobblehead spawns at Middle Mountain Cabins, as well as 2 Royal Jelly spawns too. 1 bobblehead is in the 1st cabin on the mantle, the 2nd in the middle cabin on the desk right by the bunk bead. Theres also a Magazine spawn in that little shack going east.
---
There's a Bobblehead spawn under the 2 dead rag stags at that body of water right by White Springs where the floaters are, as well as a magazine spawn in that shack too.
---
It's time for people to realize that waiting to log in will not prevent the bug. It will hit you no matter when you log in.
---
I’ll suggest doing nuke drops on the queen is more fun for me I can get flux as reward and then go into the sundew grove and grab the unstable flux down there and make it stable
---
This. I'm only out of mine to craft and sleep. I have to fix my legs once every week or two, and my left arm sometimes. Everything else is still going strong after at least a month.
---
Well at least your time was spent with new content, not just doing challenges with old content.
---
Thanks man!
---
Yeah MM is supposed to have 2 one helmets. And sadly I'm on XB1 otherwise I'd take you up on the offer.
---
Most of mine say 250 though
---
Oooo good shout
---
And only gave 250
---
yep.....[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=mannequins&amp;restrict\_sr=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=mannequins&amp;restrict_sr=1)
---
Im not a fan of the ghillie skins.
---
Screenshot? Would be the first I've heard of it, but I wouldn't be surprised either
---
Don't take it personally - the mid 20s-30s is a weirdly unbalanced time period.  Plow through.
---
I sold about 8k worth of crap today alone. Most stuff was priced at 300 to 500 caps each and plans between 1 and 50 caps each. I think my biggest single sale today was someone buying just over 600 gunpowder for 1 cap each.
---
Yea but sometimes you can get a visual big where u picked up the flux it’ll still show it there but you won’t be able to pick it up again
---
Are they not listed as double, or are you only getting half of what's listed?
---
Killing legendary enemies isnt luck if you do things like SBQ, Encrypted or even easier Uranium Fever, Leader of the Pack or Horde events
---
They gotta just look at other games rewards and what makes that exciting, they got the challenges stuff basically fixed with double xp stuff and 9 challenges but the rewards need work.
---
I found a 2* for like 2000 caps at a random player vendor. Well worth it. 3* usually go for a lot more
---
It's especially sickening that they have taken the stand that they won't return the missing score to you. Like they did with atom challenges. If you had the auto complete happen earlier you would get the atoms back by making a ticket. When they now say "we can't help you" they actually mean "we don't want to help you". As it is a fact they could if they wanted to. If by some wierdness they really can't reward score, they could reward atoms, which we could use to buy score/rank we missed.
---
Ah men to that they really just need to fix the targeting system for our turrets n improve them 😥 but alas theyve tried said its improved yet old bugs persist...
---
I kinda dont mind the traveling merchant but I haven't had my turrets go berserker on one of them since wastelanders update. Been very lucky it seems as I've read all types of reports of this occuring (turrets targetting anything even other "friendly" turrets) 
---
My final suggestion as a temp fix until they fix it permanently would be everytime u find a rogue turret just store it and plop it back down or let it be destroyed and get a friend to repair it (should fix it being hostile and going berserk on friendlies)
---
Hopefully this fixes it until it just doesn't occur anymore
---
That username though
---
I doubt it. You need to actually loot magazines for it to count for the challenges so I imagine it's the same way for this with bobbleheads.
---
Oh snap, thanks for the tip!  First thing Im gonna do when I get home.  Had to stay up a little later then usuall last night finding legendary stuff to kill.  Hopefully this works for me.
---
Why do so many of these posts use murder as a analogy for talking about duping digital items in a video game?
---
Ugh I'm trying to find out how to do this as I love my jet pack but want EP.  I missed the arm mod one.
---
You could be president
---
bloodied explosive is where it's at 😂
---
Man your lucky I love those Irish tenor banjos
---
Yeah I can’t imagine how much damage that one does!
---
Haha, these shots are amazing. I don't know why, they just are. Bravo good sir, have my upvote.

If she wants to show off her chassis, let her. This isn't Communist China, despite what the Liberators would like you to believe.

I'll have to try this and then I can reload my bloodied ffr railway rifle (aka Choo-Choo Pew Pew) for added train fun.
---
about 600 normal hits, 1200 sneak :)
---
I find the quest markers are a joke most of the time. Could be much better. And I hate when you in a building. Obviously doing one quest and another marker for another quest is trying to make you leave. Yes I know I can turn the other off but the game should just know which one I'm doing by where I am. I'm I in the prison looking for vacuum tube yes, no I don't want to go to the amusement park to do dross toss.
---
Hear a horn. "Hmm what's that?" Turns around to instant death...
---
Neah. There were some dodgy shenanigans back in the early days but it's been fine for a long time. 
---
Just got to pay attention to what is being sold/offered
---
It was awful like a tesla on steroids, I couldn't understand how they were were hitting from so far away
---
 Low health builds can make use of armor with the "unyielding" prefix, which you may have encountered.  Each piece adds 18 total S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points, 3 in all but endurance. So if you wear five pieces you get significant increase in intelligence, which means more xp. (Also you get 15 STR, which equals 75 lbs of carry weight, if that's your thing)
---
In order to get maximum effect, you can only use 20 percent of your health bar.  Since the penalties for dying are incredibly mild, to me there is no point in not playing low health. 
---
Also you get bloodied weapons, which damage wise are much better than everything else.
---
Thanks, ill keep server hopping.
---
Because it’s a simple analogy to compare rule breaking. But it doesn’t matter. Apparently everyone is ok with Bethesda enforcing the rules for some and letting others go. Nobody apparently agrees with me that it should be consistent.
---
I don’t recall that, but there was a window of time when I hadn’t been playing for awhile so could have been during that time
---
I just looked again it was just a visual glitch it said I only got 250 but I just looked again and it gave me another 250

What in gods name is going on?

They didnt. Its stays untill patch 21
---
Plus, if your wheel lags you've likely just accidentally suicided.
---
wtf this like the best thing ive ever seen
---
Absolutely! Whilst the Ghillie Armor skins were a good idea in theory, the amount of gaps &amp; skin breaks in them makes them a far worse choice than simply using the Ghillie Suit you obtained in N.W. I feel of these came out 6mths ago, they may have had a warmer reception. But coming out as an inferior option after the N.W. one was available makes them show their flaws in bright neon lights. (JMO, Don't hate)
---
I have the normal version off the atom shop and it doesn't, no idea about this one though.
---
Thanks for the info. Didnt know about the cryolater bit.  Just got a 3 star last night.  Guess I will be taking it with me next time.
---
They hand out atoms like candy🍬
---
Season 2 rewards need a major revamp.  Skins all the way through.... and then the grand prize is even more skins.  How much power armor can one don?  
---
Rank 100 should give stash space.
---
Or a mod that lets miniguns and 50 cals be belt fed
---
West tek with killing both the super muties outside and inside, they tend to drop a weapon and still have a weapon in the inventory, so with scrapper perk I usually end up with about 80-100 plastic and anywhere up to nearly 800 steel per run as long as you scrap everything with the scrapper perk. Just as long as the place hasn't been cleared yet. 
---
Riding shotgun is a second favorite for me for that, quite a few weapons there as well if you do it with 2 or 3 people (and a good mining source for 80+ aluminium so its a good rotation).
---
I simply got bored logging in and out over and over with the highschools so that become my normal route.
---
My favorite spot for that since it hardly takes time or effort
---
Funny, very funny.  Well played.
---
The Ghillied Armour skins are rigid, plastic, and bulky looking. The Ghillie suit offers far more camouflage in my opinion.
---
Just gotta get lucky on vendors sad to say.  I did the same and was thrilled to find another one one day so I could put it in a display rack.
---
It's not easy for the casual lvl 50 guy. But veterans should have no problem at all.
---
I found one right outside my camp,where I usually get them.
---
I’m excited for this as well but I’m confused why it seems like people forget about the hd remake a few years back. What makes this one better?
---
 It's very awkward to use in my opinion, I find it to be bad in vats, and gigantic on the screen so bad in ads. 
---
Whereas the lever is a streamlined killing machine.  Fire one empty and swap to a full lever and it even does well in crowds.
---
Well, you're not wrong (it's a bit more in EU, though); my game pals are kinda ridiculing me for not buying into it, but I just don't like cosmetics, that's all.  
---
Might make an exception for that sweet Aliens pack, though...
---
Yep, every time I get some I head right over there. My rep with the raiders has been "stuck" on the beginning on neighborly for weeks now.
---
I know you’re being sarcastic but I can see it won’t make a difference because apparently everyone is ok with Bethesda enforcing the rules upon some and letting others get away with breaking them. 
---
I feel like they should be consistent with enforcing rules one way or another. I could care less if everyone was banned or if everyone was set free. It should just be consistent. 
---
But I guess I’m the only one who feels that way. Oh well. I can see it’s a topic I’m on my own on. I’ll just forget about it and move on.
---
Todd and co. really hard-coded "can't fast travel while enemies are nearby" huh?
---
do you know which vendors sell it?
---
you could repeat the questline on a new character, and transfer it over to your main
---
and the last argument I can offer u: wearing unyielding armor i have 378 capacity, using Escavator PA i have 428 capacity so why they should add another +15 STR i have no idea. Speaking of dealing unarmed damage u can install some modules as   hydraulic bracers /  rusty knuckles  / tesla bracers.

It is under the bed, in the L shaped building.

Gotcha

My intake is going up now since I also am making ultracite .50, just found the plan for the receiver on one of the 2 sbq yesterday
---
You should be able to farm the areas around The Top Of The World. They capped the levels on those areas awhile back and they should be around your level. You can also check Huntersville and West Tek, provided a higher level player hasn't been around that area in awhile the mutants should spawn at a more appropriate level for you. In fact you should be able to server hop West Tek for a bit and you'll spawn lower levels mutants there most of the time.
---
Saves the need for all that ballistic fiber for repairs and stabilized.   Always have radiation protection
---
Yeah your title literally says NEW SCORE BUG TODAY as if this hasn't been happening since score rolled out.
---
Yeah what's the point of having so many treasury notes, then having to do the events every day to gain more but capping cashing in? Even daily players have to be building up even more of them than what I have.
---
Funny, because that's exactly the workaround for this bug.
---
The "can't fast travel while enemies are nearby" was a little more hardcoded than they anticipated 🤖

Because some of them are very rare. I spent 150+ hours looking for the red uniform. But i eventually set a target date and if i didn't find one by then i was just gonna buy one. [So i did.](https://imgur.com/FQFKhwJ) I didn't find a yellow or forest until about 130 hours in to it. And then i found 2 of each in about 10 hours.
---
The cheapest colour goes for 1k at most. And the most expensive (the red) can go for silly caps. People will pay a lot. Usually in trades as they're worth more than 30k caps (max caps). They were apparently duped recently BUT i haven't really seen an increase of them on the market. 
---
hats are worth nothing.
---
White dirty/Withered - worthless
---
White Clean - up to 500 caps
---
Brown - up to 1k
---
Blue - up to 5k
---
Green - up to 5k (tbh i find blue sells way better than green)
---
Pink - up to 12k
---
Yellow - up to 15k
---
Forest - up to 25k
---
Red - 30k+ easily. Like 5 times as much
---
You need to have done the BoS part of the quest and have access to the 3rd floor of fort defiance. You run into the asylum. Go up in the lift to floor 3. Across from the lift is a room with beds. There can be one on the bed you can see from the lift. Then at the other end is another bedroom and a shower room. There can be one in each of those as well. 
---
IF you pick up a uniform though one will not spawn there again until you have looted x amount of items (it's either 180 or 255.. tried to test and got distracted) or a certain amount of time has passed (unknown). You then log out. Log in. Rinse and repeat. You just run past the mobs outside and watch out for a randomly spawning wendigo near the lift. 
---
Also. Sometimes if there's not a single uniform try waiting a few seconds as they may not have loaded in. 
---
if you're confused just check youtube for asylum uniform farming.
---
The lowest I seen it placed was just above where the gold part curves at the top, before it goes to a point... I'm just not sure how low it can be built downwards is all sorry lol
---
yes, put an atom shop paint on it. downside is if you try to drop it the game will break it into dust and it will blow away
---
There are a couple possible spawns at Camden park also. One in the coaster/ride car between the Lucky Mucker and the spinning ride, usually in the front car next to a skeleton passenger. The other in the manager's office building, normally on top of one of the filing cabinets. Sometimes it gets knocked down next to/behind the cabinet, so make sure to look carefully.
---
One or twice I've also had one spawn in the middle of the main coaster in the abandoned raider camp, in the display case by the porta pot, next to where a stealth boy normally spawns.
---
ETA: There are a couple magazine spawns also. In the coaster car about halfway through the track (you have to jump on and run along the tracks) normally next to a stuffed bear in the middle or so car. Then also by the robot vendor, either in or next to a knocked down magazine rack.
---
You can't sell it as it has a paint job on it. 
---
favourite the weapon or armour
---
Events, join public groups to boost, and little late now, but always hit the double xp weekends really hard. Do all the dailies you can on the left side of the map. Claim workshops and do the defend quests for them as well. Power armor will help you tremendously!
---
Ohhhh so that's what's causing it! I did paint the rifle I mentioned so that makes a lot more sense. I guess I gotta buy the first atom shop paints I found now, unfortunately.
---
Just met with the plan mule to discover I don't have Standing Gorilla learned.  But I can craft it.

BUT I can't craft Sitting (which shows as Known)....AND I know for a fact that I learned both plans during the Mole Miner event.

Reel Big Fish coming to Appalachian Radio

On top of the hanger where you enter to do Uranium Fever there is almost always one there.

Agreed, it isn't that hard if you just play the game. I got all 3 of mine at Radiation Rumble.

she does have a nice firm rear hatch if you know what im sayin

You finna link mang?

You are experiencing the challenge auto complete bug. When you swap servers the missing ones will appear and they will be already complete. Welcome to the club.

I might be wrong. But they gave us an extra daily for double xp week. But now that it’s going to be double score weekend they went back to normal with only 5 dailys.

Interested in selling or trading?

Try checking Tyler county fairgrounds there's 3 spawn locations there so there'll be one around probably. I got one earlier there. Also as previously commented get a fo76 map, I've got an app on my phone that has bobblehead locations on it

They're butthurt because they got killed by a high level when they were new and now they're taking the anger on the newbies, it's just a never ending cycle.

About the only PVP left in game is workshops so people that want to PVP take advantage of it.  And if you crouch you will not show on map

It's actually called stable flux when you craft it but it's the same thing. Just to avoid any further confusion.

I usually just hold a pylon and sneak around in my stealth suit healing people. Doing a bloodied build now instead of junkie though, so it’s a little tougher to hold the pylon.

If there’s a decent amount of high level players, then I’ll join the event. Other wise it’s a waste of time and the event can be frustrating
---
Great damage but range is poor from my own experience, well apart from this guys it was nuts
---
In addition to what others wrote about ammo bags and military-grade duct tape, vendor robots sell it in bulk. Not cheap but plentyful. Just be sure to use the hard bargain perk when you buy stuff.
---
No worries, if I'm honest you will find it much easier to buy it from other players, Join a trading forum. Most people sell then from between 200-300 each.
---
These are simply idiots
---
Okay.  Whatever
---
Explosive flamers have unlimited range. I like to pull out my standered flamers indoors, events like rad rumble they are great since they will fully damage multiple enemy's as long as they are in the cone of fire

Hell, they could just take the idea straight out of Elder Scrolls Blades basically. They have the one dungeon thing where the further you go down before dying, the better your rewards and the harder the enemies get. It'd be even better if you could go into it as someone fresh out of the vault and level up using it. Give more ways to play and advance.

Trading forum?

I fel like a power armor fist and the power fist would feel similar.

I mean correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m 99% sure Nukashine is just original recipe FourLoko

He means a player sold it in their vendor or sold it to a robot vendor and he got it there.  It’s not a stocked item in robot vendors
---
.... blends you in with your surroundings .. does what it sez on the tin 😁👍
---
Stinging is 20% and perforating is 40% armor penetration. Armor penetration effects kinda stack. They are multiplicative, not additive. Meaning for example AA weapon (50%) and Stabilized perk (45%) is not 95%, but 72.5%.

Wow that's op 0_o

It's ok, just take your mind off these buggy items by sharing some lunchboxes with friends. Not 5 though.

Stupidly we are not allowed to mention the actual name on the sub,  Check my page its on there.

I always wondered about that. Bummer that no one else can hear it :(

Take a swim through the sub and you'll see that pretty much everyone doesn't agree with Bethesda's practices.

If posting new threads about it here helped, we wouldn't be where we are.

It’s also peeps that spent a lot of time making PVP builds and are still mad. Or they are just dicks haha
---
The accuracy in the explosive ones is pretty bad in then though. So it's hard to hit something outside of a normal range
---
Well I mean you can look at the health bar and see he has a mod installed so obviously PC. And it wouldn't matter if he was a steam client or bethesda client, it's an in-game armor that will/should function the same on both
---
Just be careful. Don’t “spam click”
---
Bughesda is a 2.5 BILLION DOLLAR company. They have money to hire more people if they want/care. We are experiencing the same bugs we have had since launch of the game.
---
I think you only need to complete three(?) Tadpole badges to unlock Possum challenges. I know I still have some Tadpoles left to do in addition the some Possums. The important point is that if you happened to complete a challenge before getting the quest, it doesn’t count, so start it early!
---
Big bottle for me. You rock thanks.

The terminal and collection bin lock separately on other collectrons, are you locking both?

No worries! Either way it looks awesome

You right, and that's why I'm on the fallout subreddit or as I thought I was.

Makes sense, but makes it impossible for newer players to get any use out of the workshops. Just seems toxic to me.
---
There’s actually a Skyrim Easter egg in the game, somewhere far south (I think) there is a cart with tied up prisoners in it
---
Maybe I just needed to vent. Idk. Thanks for at least stopping by lol
---
Either use Google or equip the PER perk for finding bobbleheads. Both work well.
---
Ahh would explain why he left anything way out of the way alone, usually I say leave everything in but might be a good thing these got took out
---
Is Armor penetration worth it though to have a lower ammo capacity? Or is the extra damage so small that it isn't even noticeable?
---
Is there a way to calculate the extra damage going through?
---
I know, weird questions but I'm curious.
---
maybe at the mod nexus possibly all kinds of crazy mods there , i mean heck there was randy savage as a dragon lol, but regardless have your upvote
---
Thank your father, kids.
---
I just enjoy the fireworks hahaha think theyre pretty cool. I set one off after ive killed a big enemy. A sort of little celebration for myself.
---
Oh the joys of entertaining myself
---
Is there a link to a chart on this? I have no clue what I’m doing in this game. But, I need to get going on a direction for a build. I feel like my build is haphazard at level 86.
---
So you asked what kind of build can solo the event and when someone gave you two options you gave a sarcastic reply? Weird.
---
Sure I can get on in a bit to do it. Though as an alternative look up vids of the Traincar doors. They require a little more effort and buying the Slocum Joe set, but I think they look a lot nicer.
---
😂😂😂
---
Ah yes, very immersive indeed
---
You can fire up an alt and re-run that quest line.
---
Explosive plasmas arnt any better, if anything they are 5x as strong.
---
read your post again bud
---
That would nice. But it would muck up a lot of stuff. As the pass is preset. What if someone wants the pass but I single item they want is in a path they don’t want to do. 
---
What could be done is an option to fast claim specific rewards. 
---
Hit rank 15 and it’s a currency but you don’t want it. Swap it another currency on the board of the same value but you’ll have get the same reward your swapped out later in place if that one. 
---
Give too much freedom and problems will ensue.
---
The terminal has been locked since I place it. But yeah they are both locked.
---
I always use swift since it reduces vats cost by 5 % when you combine that with all the other mods that do the same thing, you can have a zero vats cost handmade. As long as your 3rd star is LVC. Then, I use tank killer for the armor piercing/stagger
---
You can compare weapons with this tool https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html and see the differences on the chart below the calculator.
---
I personally use swift magazine as it lowers AP cost in vats, increases mag size and speeds up reloading.
---
You have to understand that people like this guy don't have time to play the game, they're too busy complaining on here.
---
You empire and your trickery
---
That looks pretty good to me.
---
I think the only thing I would change is just a personal preference thing.  I would use rank 1 Glow Sight, move that point from PER to CHA, and equip Travel Agent.  I know travel agent can be swapped in/out pretty easily, so its entirely up to you...but I like the convenience of having it equipped all the time.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 gold
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html this tool is a good starting point
---
Ugh yes. And trying to find enough lead to keep up with my .50 consumption and then sitting there and crafting ammo, waiting for the screen to unfreeze between every two animations.
---
To be honest I forgot about that perk. I do hate the raider quest because if you don’t have fallout 1st survival tent you have to sometimes pay like 50 caps to fast travel to the crater.
---
It is fairly easy mate. Google,, fo76 boblehead locations " and you will get one in few seconds.
---
I’d kinda prefer it so that we could pay for the things we want
---
Nah, you have to open and close them manually. Whats this flamethrower trap thing though? I might try it.
---
You post body is wrong in case you didn’t realize it. You put tes minigun. Tes= the elder scrolls . Your looking for tse= two shot explosive.
---
Unfortunately you’ll have to buy up to what you want. It’d be weird if I could immediately buy the Super Sledge paint if I was rank 1.
---
Never understood when people brings stuff like these to a group event and deletes everything before they even spawn in
---
I waited 3 weeks and never got a response or a fix to my issues. So good luck
---
I did this once because they had a bounty and I happened to be right there. Then I started to claim the workshop since I needed one for SCORE and he just kept coming back... so I kept killing him.
---
I realize my mistake, I appreciate the feed back and hopefully this will lead me to where I need to be
---
You can use the flamethrower trap to destroy camp items, place other things where they are, then repair the original item to do cool things. Like hide wiring/power connectors inside walls, make a double wide bed so it can sleep 2 people, or put the train car door in a normal door frame. I've also seen people use it to overlap mounted heads
---
Yeah, unless you have bad hearing :-/
---
My main character is named Mother Jones.
---
They nerfed the zero cost thing on wastelanders. Not possible anymore.
---
It's a full headwear, I can't see how it could stack
---
Thx for the reply, I was thinking the same. I'm not far from the end the grind continues.
---
I've been emailing every day almost since 2weeks ago this coming monday.  They answer and escalate but they keep stonewalling me.  I'll be emailing almost every day for the foreseeable future.
---
They keep firing. There is a bit of lag, though, from the time the enemy dies till it switches. You waste some ammo if you just keep it held down.
---
Does anyone else stop reading these things when they start talking about how long they've been a Fallout fan for? It doesn't add any validity to the diatribe.
---
Thank you for clearing that up, that is a handy tool!
---
The switch is so fast in a mob you don't really notice, you literally spin on a dime it can get dizzying, but loads of fun.
---
I'm working on setting up my weapon and build to minimize AP use during the firing sweep, the limitation I have is the handmade's 25 rounds the clip empties before AP, with my Quad Radium rifle's 80 on large mobs my AP empties before the clip. 
---
Looking for a quad bloodied handmade, that would be sweet, if such exists.
---
Post on here beforehand.
---
I'm on XB, and will always run Encryptid if I know about it. I'll usually run a 2nd or 3rd if I know people are already on.
---
I can tank pylons, or dps. I switch between bloodied/troubleshooters, depending.
---
Cool, thanks, I'll have to look into this some more.
---
Sure is, not just new players, even seasoned players who don't care for PussyVPlayer.
---
Oh is that right? Damn. I never noticed, but I do run dodgy perk which is where my AP cost was coming from I thought
---
Just completing a challenge. Easiest and cheapest way.
---
I still have mine. Is there something special you can do with it or is it just a "collecting" thing?
---
Traveled to my own CAMP last night and ended up falling through the ground and dying.  Luckily my junk bag was just sitting inside my CAMP waiting for me to respawn.
---
The dark matter combat rifle weapon skin (on *rank 59*) was what really irked me. Like, thanks for a weapon skin that looks pretty much exactly like the default gun skin? They could have at least used the glowy stars pattern like the wallpapers and even that would have been so much cooler and worthwhile. 
---
I also truly hate the hideous ghillie garbage skins that I will never use because I dont play NW.
---
I might die from laughter
---
No problem, you can also use it to embed the cooking stoves pipes in the wall so it looks like the cooking station in the white spring workshop.
---
I bet you’re a blast at parties.
---
I’m giving my background as a long time fan to explain my experience with the franchise.  I’m not some random John who picked up Fallout with 76.  
---
My first interaction in this subreddit.  I guess the rumors of it being a toxic environment are true.  Thank you for your valuable input on my post! 🥰
---
I disagree with modern firearms. Though a better modding/customization system would be amazing, the whole draw of fallout is its unique style. I remember when people (including I) threw a fit when they redesigned the missile launcher in Fallout 4. As the missile launcher in Fallout NV and 3 was not only cooler, but fit into the Fallout world better
---
We dont need to 'modernize' fallout
---
Lol I just read Reddit and spam the button. You're at 2000 before you know it.
---
wow this was what I was thinking when I was 9   
---
I WANT GAME THAT HAVE EVERYTHING   
---
But I just grow up and saw why It can't be possible
---
From the Atomic Shop right? I think I know which one you're talking about now. Did it come with the mr pebbles backpack that's basically the mr jangles backpack we're getting in the Legendary run?
---
Daily challenge for score.  Plus ammo is normal the cheapest item so best one to do it with.
---
The 14th Amendment in the US carved out one exception to the prohibition against slavery. By *sheer coincidence*, I'm sure, the same group that used to suffer under slavery pre-14th is now disproportionately affected by that exception.
---
I add an asterix to each of my items I don't want to sell scrip or scrap. This puts those items at the top
---
*Bethesda Quality*
---
I just leave it here X\_X
---
[https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/) 
---
(hide everything but bubblehead)
---
It's clearly a hacked weapon. Besides the beam splitter, level 50 is dead giveaway. Handmade only goes up to 45.
---
That and the 3 legendary prefixes are like the most sought after, extremely rare.
---
Have noticed this also, I just fast key another berry M, I make a load anyway and use traveling pharmacy 3 so not a problem.
---
The Bethesda support ticket system is so cryptic I always give up and not bother...
---
Working as intended? 🤷‍♂️
---
100 days later and the assaultron just disappears after coming out her pod, i then had to redo all of that twice, next the power armour room door doesnt open and ra ra is frozen in that room, this is the worst fallout game to exist, i wish they skipped this bullshit and went straight to single player fallout 5
---
Doing the quest gives you the plans to make one though.
---
I understand the hate with RNG challenges when it comes to "kill a sheepsquatch" which was one of the atom challenges once upon a time. You'd either have to hunt and get lucky finding one or wait for an event to pop. But this RNG just takes a bit of FTing around and research. You're bound to find at least one without hoping off of the server.
---
So far I have my choice of all the items on the level I've completed.
---
This would be amazing. As a camp decorating enthusiast, all this ghillie crap/PA stuff is wasted on me and makes the score rewards rather lackluster when out of 100 rewards, only about 5 are appealing (to me). Sigh. And still I grind.
---
No, you need one to craft one. I think this is so you can remake it at a higher level.
---
Um, unless I’m missing something, there are doors on the traincar.  It has one single entrance and it is very narrow.  The back door doesn’t open, nor does the top.  Not the best prefab imo
---
It seems like they do not have a dedicated team and just use outsourced help on everything so no one is one the same page.
---
Yea all the effects that reduce the cost still work but you can't reach zero cost. It will use small amount of AP.
---
I thought you could just craft this?
---
Also one in the lighthouse on the 2nd or 3rd window sill. One in fairground where tinker bench is on table opposite bench next to baskets.
---
Any chance you want to sell any of the jumpsuits?
---
I recorded this today kinda perfect timing https://youtu.be/DkuMHIRTLlc
---
It does not exist, or at least a legitimate version doesn't. Bloodied and quad are primary prefixes and can't be rolled on the same weapon. That said there are probably some floating around on PC.
---
You might find this interresting aswell.. https://fed76.info/a/unlisted-item-mod-effects/
---
I try to see if ppl have stuff worth buying but there rarely ever is so ya, 3 rounds daily done.
---
Thank you for sharing this very high quality armor skin photograph. I can see that there are no problems and that has much quality. 5 stars, will purchase again. All praise Bethesda.
---
If you craft a lot would you mind sharing where you farm up the berries and fungus? I get loads of mentats from my raider collectron and should probably start crafting some of my own, too.
---
That would make sense.
---
Sure you only need to do 3, but some of the tadpoles are ridiculous. The heal while swimming practically requires setting it up with a teammate, the hacking one requires launching a nuke, and the stimpack diffuser is something you get from ~~the Enclave~~ a high-level event. Really Bethesda, those are the "early" challenges?
---
This just happened to me too, thankfully it didn't do my last weekly.
---
I’ve been saying exactly this for weeks. It has hit me five times and I have never once been on at or near reset. This isn’t caused by that at all.
---
3rd P for life, unless I'm entering a building
---
I'm gonna bookmark that too!
---
Thanks again!
---
45% armor penetration and increased accuracy is a pretty good reason though.
---
To everyone who sees someone use a follow me emote because there's a legendary and you one shot it despite other people being there.
---
I hope you step on lego.
---
I highly recommend doing the "Food for the People" event at Mama Dolces Everytime it pops up. You get five cans of canned meat stew that give you 5% exp boost for an hour (and they never spoil in your inventory) and the event itself is super easy. Always stay well rested (sleep on a bed in your camp until the well rested notification pops up) and always be in a building team even if you don't plan on working with anyone as a team.
---
This makes me feel abit better about deciding to give 76 a break, oof. The way the pass essentially wants you to grind hard or play everyday was a big mood killer, and I was thoroughly enjoying Wastelanders :c
---
This place is toxic as hell. The in-game community is fantastic though.
---
Because they're cheap. Same with the atomic onslaught skins. Take something that could be just 1 or 2 rewards and stretch it to 15-20 rewards
---
Honestly, I've never been impressed with a support system for any online thing I've done. Any subscription status. They just don't care because people will play regardless of your opinion. 
---
It blows
---
Side note: etc does ghillie have to do with the space theme anyway. Zero thought.
---
Its once per hour per server. If someone already did it you cant fo it for another hour.
---
Hmm ok. I guess it doesn’t matter. I haven’t noticed, lol. I might experiment with my mods until I can notice.
---
Then someone already did it recently on the server. It has a cooldown time per server, just server hop until you get lucky
---
It is kind and i do the same thing. Dont let the team miss out on the Legendaries as they're helping with the event aswell! Everyone needs to be rewarded
---
One lego under each foot.
---
[Map 76 shows all the spawns](https://map76.com/lvli/lpi_loot_bobbleheadslvli0001911d)
---
I switch depending on what I'm doing. So if I'm melee I'm first person. If I'm 50 cal in adventure, I'm first, but in NW I'm third person (in NW the 50 in third when aiming is like a sniper rifle). When I'm sneaking with my fixer I go 3rd as the reticle is more accurate. But if I vats I do first. 
---
Really depends on the situation but I have found pros and cons to each depending on the play style and weapon.
---
It's not that hard to do I'm lucky with 75% of events players will do this or I will. And the other are one shot fluffbags
---
I always look to see if someone is around when I take a workshop.  I only do them to get plans and for challenges.  I go into stealth and pan around the whole area with my mouse, waiting for someone.  As soon as it’s claimed I bounce.  Sometimes I go back to do the retake - but I get lazy. 
---
Question though, can you engage someone first who just wanders into your workshop (and does pacifist need to be off).  Or do they have to do something pvp related to initiate it?
---
I will up vote this post every time I see it.
---
Pleasant Valley is a good place to find one. Either in the room with the raider vendor, near a radio on the second floor between the cabins, or down near the train station where the blood eagles are there is one usually on one of the converted car chairs.
---
Lost mine 😭
---
Lvl 153 here, still working on my tadpole challenges 😂
---
There is a special sliding door you can install on the entrance of the train car, its split in the middle and slides into the walls when you open it. Its the same style as the boarded up door at the back, but functional.
---
I love this comment so much!!
---
I put “..” to have them go to the top of the page.  Alternatively, you can do “zz” to have them go to the bottom.  
---
Not every item can have a paint skin on it (fixer for example, so just making an atom shop skin isn’t always possible
---
Yes, those rewards are lackluster. But they arent the important rewards. They are just fillers. And the Thunderpipe thing you are complaining about is an issue with the gatling gun in general.
---
I found that using armor penetrating mods and perks aren't necessary (for me). I use a bloodied build and with my B2525 and BE Fixers and Handmades I destroy things just as easily. Now, im sure there is a difference but I sure as hell haven't noticed it as enemies die just as quickly.
---
For a non-bloodied build these might be necessary though for optimal damage output and time to kill.
---
Are you saying you've been suspended on the same account twice? My main account is still suspeneded (second offense) and my alt was unsuspended yesterday (first offense)
---
Isn't stimpack diffuser only a rare drop from project paradise?
---
I'll keep playing with my BF on a private server with occasional visits to public until the game dies because of all the cheating and bullshit. 
---
I love all of the Fallout games too much to just walk away, and playing together with friends is alot of fun. 
---
Just like you, I'm pissed about it but nothing I can really do but wait for it to end.
---
Riding shotgun is great too
---
Theyre about to do that to Alberta Canada
---
Idk how I overlooked that lol.  It doesn’t even show as an image in the atomic shop.  
---
I think I got confused trying to place the garage door for the Red Rocket garage and was trying to place that traincar door (or I think that’s what it was).  I’ll have to go back and look now.  
---
Thanks
---
If you're trying it on private, it seems to be broken. I have not been able to get it to start on my private server, though I haven't tried it after being on the server for an hour, I just used to try it as part of my hop. If you're on public, it should be working and you just need to wait for the cooldown.
---
I'm a bloodied rifleman so I'm frail but can dish out a lot of damage, I always bash the legendary to tag it and run so everyone gets a chance to hit it.
---
Yeah I usually do that too, but these guys don't show up on the map. And usually they don't do anything to initiate, just annihilate me with a gattling laser/plasma or mini gun. 2 times today they have come up to me from behind while I was building and just mowed me down.
---
But it might as well be. I van reload like 3-5 times and then qith grim reapers sprint refilling my AP its kind of like infinite.
---
The player killer one can also be easy with a friend. Both load into NW at the same exact time and will likely get the same server. Communicate a common spawn point and just punch each other. I've done this both times we've had it
---
Wow!
---
helping people
---
Well, I run a Junkie commando. And I haven't played without Tank Killer ever since I got it. Tried it today, didn't notice that much of a difference on most enemies. They still die in 3-4 shots without stealth.
---
That's why I made the post.
---
What in teh hell
---
Hmm has the idea that maybe there are 3 or 4 different situations that cause the bug and not just one?
---
Being online during the refresh
---
Having quit the game from NW/Atomic Shop before refresh without going to adventure
---
Joining after refresh directly into NW/Atomic Shop without joining Adv first
---
 ...
---
This is easily the most infuriating bug ever. Sometimes activating fast travel 10 times before it works. I honestly doubt Bethesda has the technical expertise to mange an online game. Even their single player games were bug ridden. Nothing like the nightmare 76 is though. What a damn mess.
---
I don't know if I can handle another Legendary Run.
---
Which workshop?  There’s likely a fast travel point nearby so they can quickly come in.  Not sure how else they would not appear on the minimap.  
---
I guess if they are really being aholes about it they might block you for the session, then attack.  They won’t show up on the minimap that way I don’t believe.
---
I've spent too much money not to play it. 
---
Also I guess I like building themed camps
---
If you 100% dedicate a season to a theme youre going to piss off more people than you please. There were tons of complaints at the end start from people who didn't give a shit about the space theme and didn't think there were enough rewards that just fit the normal theme of the game.
---
Yeah i just recently took off Tank Killer and relocated my perk points because I found the extra damage is negligible when I'm hitting 1k per hit. Other than the Queen, Sheepsquatch and Colossus none of that should be necessary. Even then, why would anyone use a rifle and not a heavy weapon for those three anyway?
---
Tyler County and Red Rocket. Never saw them coming.
---
Did they change that? I swear I remember that something in the medic badge required buying stuff from the Enclave, but the wiki says the diffuser comes from Project Paradise.
---
It pointless they should take note from other mmo reputations grind and make the threshold longer but allow players to earn as much as possible.  Leaving the cap up to the player themself
---
I probably won't bother with the SBQ again after the Wendigo Colossus hits live servers, at least in that cave I don't have to worry about NPC AI/Pathing bugging out because some people are trying to cheese the fight by standing on top of floating tents or some other bs. 
---
Also the fight looks way more engaging than the snoozefest that is the SBQ.
---
[This map should help you!](https://i.imgur.com/uSp97sk.jpg) But I find the following easiest:

---
Good info, would upvote more if I could. Thanks for sharing
---
I just started replaying this game 2 weeks before the event started.
---
Totally loved how Bethesda destroyed my ability to gain Atoms in game and im not stuck earning "score" for useless junk I dont want\is broken\dont need.
---
All my challenges are now just giving me score because the life challenges take a long while to do with little payout (40 atoms really?)
---
So thanks Bethesda, really would have liked to get some cosmetics and shit but now im stuck with 5 different types of ghillie armor that ill never use cuz I wear cult armor
---
If you haven't realized it yet whatever items you grind for will be available a month or two later for atoms or gold.  Lmao blue screen Vault 94 strangler heart items
---
Plasmas break stealth.
---
Agreed. I am excited for A Colossal Problem.
---
It would be if we could build a merchant stand of some kind, then we could dictate where the merchant in question goes in our camp.
---
I had a single turret of mine target the travelling merchant and storing it and re-deploying it did not fix the problem. I had to scrap it and build a new one which did resolve the issue.
---
That will help for sure. Thank you!
---
Why?
---
It the opposite for me , every game I play 3rd person but when shooting with my heavy gun I prefer 1st person
---
PAINFUL related lesson: DO NOT DIE during the SBQ fight.   This appears to reset the minimum damage threshold(PS4) for loot.  I’ve missed out on SBQ loot more times than I care to admit because I died in the final stages of the fight and failed to return or re-deal required damage fast enough.  This is even after being in fights from the start and unloading requisite damage.
---
I’ve done none of those things. I log out of adventure and log back in to adventure. I’ve done every suggestion and none have worked so far.
---
I get fireworks, since it's the summer.
---
But the only way to have gotten them before July 4th was if you grinded the repeatable weekly experience challenge. Completing every non repeating daily and weekly wasn't going to get you fireworks in time for the holiday
---
It can take several weeks unfortunately. Fingers  crossed for you

edit:  Just realized this could refer to an in-game CAMP or an IRL home... lol  I was jokingly referring to the in-game CAMP...
---
No problem. Also when you enter an event area if you wave, it’s less likely that someone will one-shot the squishy bosses. A few dics exist but many are simply too nervous not to shoot quickly just in case there’s a one-shot dic among the crowd. Waving helps ease the tension in most cases.
---
That's a damn good show.
---
Off course it is legit, I play for a month and already reached l.35, there are so many who play from early 2018
---
Found one here to complete the challenge! thanks
---
Just use the one you currently have that provides the most DR. After that, place an atom shop skin on it and you won't notice the difference anyway.
---
So I'm not crazy after all. I get her everytime, immediately after the exit warning during Lode Baring too. None of my friends have this happen, so I was starting to question my sanity.

---
All in all this has been a cool learning experience. I guess the whole thing somehow surrounds all of heavy industry - I guess as long as it has been a secluded part of the state  with significant distance to other town/city... Still  dumbfounds me that anything like that could have happened in western countries.
---
The PvP relics of the past persist. I completely agree with ones ability to PvP a workshop but if I'm honest I don't seem to have that much trouble. I run my low level alt for the challenges and no one gives me crap.
---
I still wish there was a PvP layer you could sort of enter and leave. I want to run around with a little anxiety about being killed by my fellow wastelander. Miss survival mode.
---
It looks like a slight backtrack is happening with them unbanning and giving out final warnings instead.

---
Anyone who is interested in things like this, there is a really good book called "Behemoth" that is a history of factories and manufacturing.  There is a section that discusses very first Company Towns/Stores.
---
Just happened to me as well. I loaded up the game, went straight to adventure, and the game crashed trying to load into the server. Tried again, now I'm 8 out 9 completed. Same scenario happened last week. If I crash trying to enter adventure after a reset, I get the auto complete bug.
---
Typical
---
Create a new new character, do one game of NW, get like two to three levels. It's about as challenging as doing the same thing to cheat the level up challenge.
---
Bobbleheads are not rare, you just don't realize you are missing them. Same with magazines.
---
No, you're not crazy. It's very annoying. I honestly thought I was the only one who got this bug. Glad to see I'm not the only unfortunate.
---
Yes, that's happened to me a lot in the past several weeks. It's very annoying. Sometimes logging off and re-logging will fix it but not always.
---
There's not a cutscene to be found besides the intro that existed at launch. And PVP has existed since then too.
---
What are you on about?
---
There's a similar issue with the Waster power armour's arm pieces being too big. They cover a good portion of the screen (not nearly as bad as this ghillie) with most weapons.
---
Yep. I'll have the music super loud but my gun will be silent. Or I'll just hear a machine gun constantly shooting.

7 weeks, 280 hours, level 429, rank 100 in the legendary run, did you do all this legitimately? If so, you're probably just a bit burnt out, take a break and come back with the next update. I've played 1000 hours and I only just hit level 450, I still play every day, but its mostly dailies that keep me coming back, I also enjoy the gameplay alot, it amuses me.
---
I knows this seems confusing at times but this isn't Bethesda customer support.
---
This also isn't a new bug.
---
What’s the issue with people taking from it? It’s most likely going to be full when you go to your CAMP
---
Dragnet! I haven't watched that show in forever. Now I'm going to have to find that episode.
---
Touché
---
I like camp building and taking photos, 2 things that when I got the game I thought would be bottom of my interest list. Other than that I like messing with character creation. I'm mostly not fussed about meta builds apart from running unyielding lately for easy xp/score. I like trying the stuff no-one else would really bother with, like a nocturnal sniper ( kicks ass btw ). Gonna try making a stalker next. As in the legendary effect.
---
Cutscenes?
---
honestly the chicken koop was like my most wanted item other than the sheepsquatch plushie and im still a while away from it (im like rank 54 atm)
---
So you pick the one that has the most items you want. Simple as that. Look at this season...there are tons of items many people could care less about. I would rather have 1 item I don’t care about that 30.
---
Yep, I've noticed it the last few times I've played. Now that I think about it, I think I've also only experienced it in PA, which stands out as I don't use it often, besides lead farming Lucky Hole Mine or in Nuked Zones.
---
Are you sure?  I was able to enable one in the Atomic Shop.  I'll go back but it showed up with the little atomic bomb icon.
---
I guess it was the Ghillie paint for the rifle that I was thinking of.
---
Yeah man this is just shameful.  I don't understand.  it's not rocket science.  Computers are really good at if/then statements: 
---
* anyone with 2 or more of the EXACT same item with the EXACT same durability and legendary effects: delete the dupes leave 1 copy.  
---
* Anyone with a weapon that has a BASE damage that exceeds standard for that weapon class, delete all copies.
---
   * Hacked weapons all have higher base damage than they should, so for example there is a hacked .50 cal that has higher base ballistic damage plus energy damage per shot that a normal .50 cal doesn't have.
---
* Items that should not normally have dr, er, rr, legendary effects or damage, delete all copies
---
   * There are hacked power armor suits with legendary effects.  rings with legendary effects, binoculars that deal damage, etc.  
---
This is a complete and total disgrace.  Bethesda just simply doesn't care about the integrity of this game.
---
There's a difference between effort (spending time playing and, you know, *doing* things) and tedium (server hopping, waiting at loading screens).
---
But nerfing sneak will screw over everyone that runs sneak not just bloodied. I run a non bloodied sneak.
---
Fun fact: Silent hill was inspired by Centralia.
---
280 hours in 7 weeks is pretty damn good lol. That’s a full time job.
---
We don’t have a choice...the rewards are preset for everyone. I am talking about have a board with a theme so to speak. One that focuses on specific categories.
---
That would be the best Easter egg!
---
I think its a PA specific bug, it was happening to me heaps on my first character, who was always in PA. I main a stealth rifleman now and I don't remember the last time I had this bug.
---
I was really hoping he'd say it at some point.
---
Sneaking is already overly powerful as it is, normalizing it just fixes bloodied in the process.
---
There's a guy above in the thread saying he loves the bugs because they give the game "character."
---
This is why we can't have nice things.
---
Assuming you were standing somewhere with enough space behind you to allow you exit the PA, then yeah, its probably a bug and I would imagine it will be fixed when you log back on, can't say I've ever had it happen, but I haven't used PA in a while.
---
On Xbox I finally found power armor last night and I'm super excited to use it. So today I built a power armor station, pulled out my chassis and attached all the pieces to it and now it won't let me repair it. It just keeps saying that its waiting for servers. I've been switching servers, going to my private server, restarted the game, my console and even restarted my internet just for the hell of it. It's been 2 hours and it's all I've done today.
---
Good news is that all the dupers are back and they are all richer than everyone who plays this game normally.
---
I feel ya. It is ok as I have time to log on for an hour or so a day, but come the fall I won’t have as much time, and if they decide to charge for it next season (since they have yet to give a solid response to us), I will not be participating. The items I want/like are not worth the effort
---
I was hitting a blank on this cheers ears
---
Glad I could help!
---
I agree it’s improved but disagree with your original experience. There was always more to do than just looting and scrapping.
---
Yikes dude. You really lookin for something to get mad about lol.
---
I think it’s more confusing as to why people are confused by this. Are you not doing the legendary run?
---
Thank you! Glad it was a help for you.
---
You want to hide your loot bag?
---
Yeah, "shotgun" and "powerfist." Real helpful advice.
---
That makes sense--but wouldn't the same logic apply to the standard ghillie suit from the limited time NW rewards?
---
It’s the principle of it not staying locked. It’s one thing if some one is taking it. But it’s locked when I go to and from my camp. And I’m not getting notified if someone is picking the lock. I could care little if someone is taking the ammo. But I’m more concerned if it’s not working as it’s supposed to.
---
Right? I'm like 87% sure you can craft it, and actually craft even better ones bc you can craft a higher level than the one you may have got from the questline.
---
ETA: nvm, I just checked the wiki, and you have to \*have\* a blade of bastet to craft a blade of bastet. Essentially, you can "upgrade" it by crafting a higher level, but you have to have the base one first which can NOT be crafted.
---
Interestingly I crashed as well trying to load in as well. The microwave tripped the breaker connected to the wifi...
---
Could be evidence that it is connection related, first log in runs a script or process that could be interrupted by a client connection issue?
---
Fair enough but other than looting, scrapping and killing mobs, what else was there at release?
---
We also have a rich history around mining. I mean, we had or still have so many resources, Iron, Silver, Coal, Uranium, probably even Lithium (tbd :D) ... 
---
If you came across Kingdom Come: Deliverance, you'd even experience a part of the country famous for it's silver mining (and the counterfeiting that went on not too far from the area)....
---
Yet I don't recall any such exploitation ever occuring in our lands. I mean ... apart from being part of the Holy Roman Empire, being exploited by a certain moustached German man, and then being communist for a good part of the 20th century ... Mining is more of a "proud" tradition with it's own, rich folklore than anything else.
---
Can confirm this history horror story is true, my great grandfather apparently spent a stint living like a hobo so he could save up enough real money to get out of mining and into farming.
---
Yeah, I was pretty disappointed. But maybe they fixed it? because last time I checked I couldn't enable it
---
Same here. I can't say that any of those mentioned "causes" are valid, since I got hit and none of them applied to me.
---
if they are gonna ghillie everything, ghillie everything.
---
Oh ok ok that’s understandable. Idk i have a similar issue where I put on a lock on the shed that I store my power generators in and it always ends up unlocked. I’ve taken to just ignoring it and hoping nothing destroys it cause I got tired of constantly relocking it
---
Huh!   I haven't really seen them run all over like that.   They're usually all bunched up together on the bunker and fences.   Once in a while, they'll spread out into a nice group.   I guess there's no limit to the variety we'll see in behavior given we're dealing with real human beings.
---
You only need a chinese office sword I believe, to craft a new one.
---
Yes I was in a open field but I couldn’t let it bug me until I got home so I logged on quick and I was able to leave it but health and everything was showing to I couldn’t pick it back up I couldn’t even hit enemies with bullets. I had to wait until power armor recalled into inventory
---
googling fallout 76 rare plans or outfits or items usually brings you back to here but the info is usually spot on (even if it is a old)
---
This can give you a rough idea on prices for weapons and armour  [https://fed76.info/pricing/](https://fed76.info/pricing/) 
---
You'll soon learn what does sell and what doesn't. Nukes and missiles take up too much stash space so don't bother with those. Things like stims, radaway, and rad-x don't usually sell. The more vendors you visit the more you'll see the same stuff
---
&gt;  I like trying the stuff no-one else would really bother with, like a nocturnal sniper
---
I feel like the game wants me to try such a build aswell.
---
bravo
---
Yes all legit without bugs or exploits. During double xp event I leveled from 270 (ish) to 420 (ish) just by killing LOTS of super mutants and ghouls and doing that repeatable weekly challenge.
---
Eh. Sorta agree. But not by much. As a bloodied build, when unarmed I do a lot of damage. The only thing I have to punch 2-3 times would be the miurlurk Queen, scorchebeast or a behemot. And they tend to kill me if I miss the first punch, or if I get a stagger effect. Same applies for when I switch to my bloodied shotgun build. Almost everything is 1 shot except for them. 
---
Most of my deaths involve fall damage. Because I’m stupid and use my jet pack to fly around and I die. But there are moments where I can fight up to 10 enemies shooting me and I don’t die. Or I get killed easily. Regardless of my perks. All depends on my movement, my quick thinking with Stimpacks. Etc. 
---
Your idea of me doing a lot of damage and me receiving a lot of damage sounds good on paper. But in reality it would be stupid. Can you imagine a level 300 bloodied build going down because suddenly a leve 5 scorched can easily kill you because “you take more damage”. 
---
It would make the build completely useless. And if people really want that, all builds would need a nerf or buff. Like people who run vanguard armor. When they have full health they get a lot of damage resistance. Basically a walking tank. So that would mean to be fair, if those people have a lot of health. And armor. It’s only fair that we nerf them, and when equipping vanguard armor your weapons do 50% less damage. Because it’s unfair to have a lot of health, and do normal damage. Right? 
---
I don’t really care about the sneak stuff you said. I only use sneak and the extra damage while sneaking perk for when I fight the queen. Other than that, there’s nothing sneaky at all about my build lol.
---
Yeah I am on pc. I love playing holotape games. Anything you're looking for in return?
---
Yeah, I hate when that happens (landing for only ten seconds or so).   I really hope she gets fixed with the next patch so that we can cripple her again.   Then melee folks can go to town!
---
 Just go do karate in your red rocket garage
---
While wearing the eye of ra, the blade of bastet ignores 100%enemy armor. Not a bad melee
---
I've also seen bobbleheads spawn on the desk beside the computer on the 2nd floor of the house near that lighthouse.
---
I may try scrapping and rebuilding. Storing and redeploying did nothing.
---
Hasn't happened for a couple of months, but I have experienced it a few times. PS4, was not using PA.
---
i didn't get very far through it. after waiting months for real pvp cause of some old beth quote, me and a friend followed the main quest to a bar where we each had to wait a few minutes for the other to receive a fetch quest and promptly ditched the game
---
Maybe it’s something is up with power armor today I mean I was in excavator armor the other night and it was fine
---
Yeah and I confirmed it stacks with goat legs. It gives like a total of 98% fall damage reduction used together max perk level. I jumped off a few places to test and only Lost a small bit
---
I agree that the start was frustrating, and that it improved. It is also even more frustrating for a lifelong fallout fan. The community is only toxic if you say something that might be controversial because a lot of people can't handle that people have different views
---
you do know that sneak doesn't work if your target is in combat, right? the multiplier doesn't trigger. so you'd be nerfing a mechanic that already doesn't work in groups.
---
and people always B about bloodied being too op while I'm here getting mowed by a group of liberators or mole rats with a full sentinel set and every single damage reduction perk.
---
sorry, i meant minutes of individually instanced dialogue
---
Yeah I've been camp jumping to visit other peoples vendors looking for plans and recipies, so im slowing seeing what people are selling at what prices
---
Probably someone trying to dupe.
---
PVP has existed since launch, but not many people like it
---
I just did it a couple days ago. It pulled one out of my stash
---
I've also had this happen a few times. Sometimes the gun would be silent, other times everything other than the gun would be silent, Sometimes I hear repeating gunfire sounds when no one is firing any guns. This bug has occurred for me without me being in power armor (I rarely  use it).
---
interesting thought
---
just do the quests dont worry about the levels i mean after 50 its all down hill anyways. so enjoy the game
---
Do you think that those of us that have played the game 2000+ hours, and basically do nothing but run silos, and kill the SBQ know nothing about this fight?
---
Do you think we only want to play with streamers and others that have researched the fight because we want to spend a lot of time on each Queen fight and spend thousands of rounds of ammo when a few hundred will do?
---
Do you think we have a separate non-explosive weapon for fighting the Queen because we like carrying around an extra 15-20LBs?
---
Do you think that sometimes we have to back off the damage we are doing to her because our non-explosive weapons are not burning her down faster than a paper house in a bonfire?
---
I know how to fight the SBQ...I would like others to know as well.
---
are you talking about nuclear winter? can't believe they scrapped survival for some trash clone of fortnite
---
Exactly why does it matter if someone is OP. None of us have to engage in PvP if we don't want to. Personally I prefer to one or two shot everything because it takes farming for ammo one less grind in an already grindy game. Not trying to argue just giving my opinion. I also went through the TSE nerf where they went from OP to just about useless overnight. So Bethesdas Trac record isn't very good at nerfing things. And honestly I think I speak for a lot of us but I'd probably quit the game before I'm forced to change my build around if they don't get it right.
---
Yeah, the chicken coop is one of the two best things on there
---
I use my fancy shotgun to cripple  the legendary... and emote at the same time.
---
Work on all the enemies except the giant bad ugly scorched Bat...
---
Ohhhh...well now we know 😅
---
I'm enjoying it.   However, I don't have tens of thousands of rounds either.   I'm hoping they fix it next patch.
---
I’ve been a fan for just as long, having read a preview in pc gamer with images of Darkwater and what not and thinking holy shit. That nostalgia trip you went on was fun to read, but then the switch to 76. I don’t know, I just don’t understand why someone from that generation of gaming would dislike 76. The narrative is delivered via tapes and notes instead of NPC’s but I found it harked back to that older style with its bread crumb data collection and what not. I understand the frustration about bugs, but I found the stories in the world deep and enriching so could overlook them. Some of the saddest stories I’ve read in the fallout universe have come from this game. I’m not sure what you wanted, a hand holdy join this faction and overcome default enemy x? That’s not very true to the originals at all. Enlighten me.
---
You have....*a day* to find one.
---
in adventure mode. PVP still exists there, but only a small handful of people bother with it. Survival was dropped because of a lack of players in the servers to sustain their use (according to bethesda) those servers got reworked into the NW game mode
---
Yeah. I really don’t care too much about the ammo. It’s just one less thing to craft or buy. But I’m more concerned if it’s intended to unlock. Like the bot is trolling us. Or it’s genuinely not staying locked.
---
**FUCK HIM**
---
That's awful :-/
---
My choice has been to leave this damn scrap kits unclaimed.  Even if they are free I don't want them lol.  Didn't really want to claim the basic repair kits either since I have 400 improved ones in my stash.  Considering the occasional dailies for repairing things though, I'm hoping to use them for that soon on some scrap weapons I loot off a corpse.
---
This isn't at all common tbh.  You just got unlucky.  That said if you want resources from workshops the best way:
---
1. Stash all of your junk items before you enter the workshop.  
---
   1. If you die in pvp the only real loss is junk items you drop on death so if you have nothing on you, you lose nothing if you die.
---
2. crouch when you go in and while inside the workshop at all times.  
---
   1. People scanning the map for possible pvp look for players actively inside the workshop, and you don't show up on the map when crouched.
---
3. Take the workshop, setup whatever resources you want as well as a stash/scrap box, then immediately LEAVE.
---
   1. The resources don't fill up faster if you are present. The longer you linger inside the workshop, the more of a target you are.
---
4. Return later to gather the resources and place them immediately in the stash/scrap box in step 3 above and then immediately LEAVE.
---
5. repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have what you wanted.
---
Please note, I'm one of those evil pvp players that attacks players in workshops.  Personally I do it on lvl 20-40 or so characters as I find high lvl pvp in this game poorly implemented but I kill other players 100% of the time I play this game.  All of the above will help you avoid players like me and minimize the downside if I pop in.
---
If you want to run into players like me, ignore my advice, take workshops, hang around, and eventually one of us will come knocking ;)
---
Extra ironic considering he’s an ex-raider.
---
Are you like 9
---
That makes sense since none of those rewards have anything to do with a space-themed board game.
---
I hope Bethesda sees this tbh
---
I usually switch between the two at random. Third for exploration and mess a bout. and first for combat. I just wish the scroll wheel was still used for switching between first and third like it was for Skyrim/fallout 3, 4, NV,
---
*waves... Waits for one person to come before the rest. Kills the legendary one shot. Emotes angry face as though other person did it* jk yes I agree. It shows they understand the game and have empathy for others time.
---
I keep trying to go to the Nitro museum but it's always closed
---
no joke  
---
jerks
---
Don't let his lies fool you, he's still 100% a blood thirsty, ruthless raider at heart. He just lost his way, and now his skin.
---
You will need to post a game photo to show us where you're located based on the buildings existing in the game!  (At least when FO4 came out, I loved the posts from people who posted in-game photos of them standing in front of their homes!  lol)
---
Bad.
---
Working as intended, right Bethesda?
---
I do have some cosplay in real locations on facebook, i can send you a message with a link.
---
*One shots the spawn*
---
SUCK IT, NERDS.
---
PC bluekthulhu
---
the lvl 727. character is max muscle on the body triangle slider if thats any help
---
PvP has been in the game since launch.
---
Of course 90% of the time when I do that the first dude shows up and sprays 1000 bullets into it.  Hey, I try any way.
---
“Huh. Nothing looks wrong with it. I don’t get what the big de- Oh...”
---
Me while watching this
---
I was looking for what the game has transformed into.  The lure of Fallout is its characters and story line.  What comes to mind when I say “Myron” or “NCR Rangers” or “The Brotherhood of Steel”.  How do you make a Fallout game without characters and story arcs to choose from?
---
I’m not disagreeing with you about how the bread crumb approach is certainly interesting but I want the story presented to me with characters and factions.  Not endless walls of text via tapes and notes.
---
Worse yet... Showing up to a hoard and another creature kills them all. That deserves a nuke.
---
I have one but I don't sell to or trade with people that use spellings like "boi".
---
How are people managing to reach the end of it so soon?
---
Pvp which no one here likes and Bethesda thinks doesn't matter.
---
I've been logging off every morning directly out of NW for 2 weeks straight and the reset happens while I'm at work.  When I log back on at night I have never had a single challenge auto completed.
---
Most likely just screwed myself by posting this lol.
---
Why didn't you cancel auto-renewal on your subscription?
---
There are several possible locations, mostly in the mire and cranberry bog. There are a few videos on youtube with locations
---
oh you're talking about duels and bounties, i'm talking about no-holds-barred stealth survival on the actual map. maybe even a faction war, so the grinders can't complain about griefers. i just want the map to feel dangerous, but it's like strolling through weenie hut jr. unless you're grinding higher level bullet sponges. played a few games of NW. i've played many battle royales, and NW is definitely the worst i've played by a landslide.
---
The entire main questline, all the side quests including mistress of mysteries (one of my favorites on the series), exploring, reading through all the lore and environmental storytelling throughout the massive map
---
All the way over in the right hand column of the workshop build menu is something like “misc structures”. One of the top several items is a fast travel mat. You can build one per workshop and it’ll set your spawn point when you fast travel to the workshop. Can be helpful if you’re trying to avoid workshop PvP.
---
Yeah exactly. I might go through and get all the caps and gold bars towards the end but so far I've only claimed the skins and camp shit I want
---
Figured they would have reviewed my account pretty quick
---
It matters because the overperformance of bloodied mechanically invalidate anybody else's build who is even remotely interested in efficiency, it removes build originality and promotes pigeonholing, which directly also impacts replayability and trading economy by placing the top builds in a spotlight.
---
I did a RR event this morning and there was a guy in there waving people over to the legendary and one shotting it when they get there. Everyone was so mad when they caught on. It was a sight to see.
---
Hooooo boy, count yourself lucky you didn't play during the first year.  NIGHT AND DAY.
---
locks are useless. I put it in a room with no doors except the one I create temporarily in build mode
---
There is usually one upstairs in the house near the giant teapot
---
I honestly didn't even realize there was already a remake. Looks like its from the Xbox 360 era though so this new one will probably be a bit shinier.
---
Radiation rumble, West tek, whitesprings. I honestly dont understand the arguement about "but muh xp". You can easily get twice as much, twice as quickly in west tek.
---
Thanks!  Just found the one in the shed.
---
Don’t see where the downvotes are coming from? Someone’s salty haha
---
I just wanted them to be a plan and not a consumable. Really wanted to be able to use them as much as I wanted to like with any other craftable explosive.
---
Ahh so I forgot to add “adventuring through a desolate and dead wasteland (literally) and many walls of text.”
---
I guess I couldnt get that experience picking up a book with pictures of an empty wasteland.
---
Look this is just my experience.  I mean no disrespect to you.
---
I've put in 3k hours now, and I gotta say-  it's friends. I have 12 toons all diff builds and types. I play because I have fun hanging out with other people. We often just fuck around and see what is going on on the server. We like to launch nukes all over the place and chat. I would have dropped this game after 20 hours if it wasn't for them.
---
After all the research I've done from all the sources and mentions, there's a little bit that quite doesn't add up, but concerning Fallout this time - I know, not that this is a Fallout subreddit or anything ...
---
As the Fallout universe "diverged" from our own somewhere after WWII, how come there's so much prevalence of coal industry still in Appalachia, even after the advancements US made with splitting and ultimately fusing the atom? I mean, every single one power plant is a nuclear plant. What's the need for coal? Is it just an export at this alternate universe America?
---
I mean, I know the US wasn't so keen on sharing it's atomic secrets, even to the point that when the US cars ran on "fusion" (nah, it's still fission, a bit of marketing wankery there), the rest of the world never saw these American cars...
---
But still, why coal?
---
Some folks sell them. I’ve got one or two spares I think but I haven’t set up vending in my new camp yet.
---
Exactly my advice. I buy cards a lot and have about ten on me... I always wait for a queen to pop off and gauge server participation that way. If it takes a long time to knock her out I won't do it. If they kill the queen too fast I won't do it. It's got to be a steady fight. This way I know i can hit two pylons myself and still get a tag.
---
The plushie is way bigger than I expected. I'm newer to the game and only had the opportunity to buy the space cat plushie so far (is tiny) and having the opportunity to see all the various plushies at OG players camps (all tiny), I expected this one to be smol. But is lorg. Very lorg.
---
We need the plans to make our own Fireworks not just three or four here and there. I have a feeling they are just going to milk this one!
---
Are you on PC? I haven’t built the raider one yet, but I’d be willing to test it out to see if it’s just you or not.
---
Ok so when you can convince them to nerf hunters and rogue in wow then maybe bethesda will listen
---
That’s my point! Nobody talks about it lol. The physics were more “realistic” which IMO didn’t translate to more fun. I hope the new version maintains the same tight controls but floaty jumps from the original series with a next gen polish.
---
Or https://map76.com/lvli/lpi_loot_bobbleheadslvli0001911d, which seems to have more listed 241 vs 154 (but strangely still some from fo76 map seem to be missing on map76)
---
All ghillie in this game looks shit
---
It certainly would
---
It's a lot of fun. The night eyes perk takes a little getting used to but quite a cool effect when you do. I use things like an instigating lever during the day but nocturnal weapons with mister sandman and covert ops work really well. Obviously you could use those perks with whatever effect but at night nocturnal does a lot of damage. Like junkies without all the debuffs.
---
Ah, well this is an automatic thing that happens regardless of your status. If you're on console, Bethesda didn't even make the charge, it was Sony/Microsoft
---
Walls of text? You said you are a fan of the original games?
---
Ive seen so many of these its really making me want to play skyrim but i got too many other games to play! Lol love the comment tho
---
Forget Legos... step on an old school pointy d4 die.
---
💀
---
B-but
---
Slightly under 2000h here. Lack of other interresting games out there. While this game is a huge dumpster fire with increasing number of bugs and glitches i just have not found other game i could quit this one for. Although Red Dead Online is having a big content patch coming out in 4 days time i think.. Will most likely buy the remaining \~15 ranks of the season with the atoms i have collected over the months and put FO76 on hold until next season (atleast). And head out to wild west for awhile :)
---
That just shifts the luck to whether those events are running or not (in the case of the last two).
---
I get killed in one hit as bloodied anyway, making that one hit do more damage doesn’t make sense.
---
Why is there a toaster on top the train
---
I understand that but why do they have the right to ban legitimate players
---
I'll have a look about for them, thanks.
---
I have a bit of OCD about collecting plans, so am always looking more.
---
Nothing to do with luck, I just didn't pre-buyed it! I was as hyped as anyone else but when I saw how things were going, I just noped out. I actually browsed this sub reddit for a while now and only decided to buy this game this month but I guess it was still too early.
---
Weapons
---
Plus, the coal wars occured at the end of 19th/early 20th century, well before the universes diverged ...
---
Oh yeah from my understanding this new one will have the same play style as the original 2 so hopefully no new physics.
---
Royal Jelly Taffy and Honey don't spoil
---
The real issue is that nothing compares or even close to low health builds, even without bloodied.    
---
What really needs to happen:
---
1) Buffing other builds to make them similarly on par to low health builds.
---
2) Give us some actually strong common monsters to fight.  Right now everything that isn't a boss is like punching through a wet paper bag.  Buff cryptids and death claws, put more of them around, add more, and for fucks sake give them loot to make it feel worthwhile.
---
They will tell you they ground out the repeatable XP challenge but they really just exploited.
---
Last time I went on a rant about how the end game charge weapons were all bugged in VATS one of the top comments was that the bugs are charming and endearing.
---
5 toons all in the high 100’s. 
---
All 5 are different builds. 
---
Playing since beta. 
---
I like the open world but bored to shit with the game.  What keeps me going is playing with my friends and just BSing while we play.   Its enjoyable for now...
---
that's just rude. find you some kind of video game to vent that frustration. pvp'n-on-reddit-ass bully
---
Thank you, I will do this tonight!! Got 20 perk points waiting for allocation
---
Funny, that's how mine seems to be half the time anyway.
---
Thanks. I forgot this was a score challenge.
---
I was originally disappointed it’s only 1 and 2, but I bet they will add 3 as dlc if it does well, same as they did with Tony hawk HD
---
Here
---
No need to be rude.
---
I simply explained what happened to me.
---
Now go shove it somewhere.
---
It's not just cosmetic items. The whole damn game is bugged out! The Bugs and issues since the last update are just off the scales!
---
Does the quest actually start?
---
I don't run bloodied on either of my character's levels 195 and 270. Granted I run junkies on both but that was a recent switch. The best part was picking up non bloodied weapons dirt cheap and I never had any issues killing anything in game. People that have invested a ton of time and caps into a build do not want to respec. Since a large % of players run bloodied I honestly think if they did that they'd lose a huge amount of players. Especially considering everything else they've done that have soured the long term players.
---
Why was I never taught this in school it seems like a fantasizing topic
---
happy bugthesda day...just another entry into the so broke it just works diary
---
The intended end game had become more of a casual thing to do during gameplay. Sbqs are easy to launch (due to a certain silo glitch and googling codes). Burrows was spoke of as a dungeon but was not.
---
The end game for many is having a nice weapon rare clothing and all of the plans. Plans especially are fun and challenging as once it's consumed it's gone forever. 
---
This is a game where you find your own end game. The players like myself who are pre wastelanders understand that the most as there was barely a game let alone an end game. We carved our own things out (trading RPing etc).
---
Somehow I ended up with one of Wards items permanently in my misc section.  Now his quest auto finishes as soon as I visit him.  And you know what?   I don’t even feel guilty about it.  The hell with him.  And he keep his eye on me all he wants...pervert.
---
People who do this should have to walk a mile long path of concrete covered in legos for eternity while barefoot
---
Four upright plugs under each foot.
---
When I would only use melee in the when the game came out I ended up accumulating around 60 pounds of gunpowder.
---
It’s the one bug that’s works for them.
---
Dialogue in a game and written text are different.
---
Nothing wrong with having a shit load of holo tapes and computer consoles with wall of text.  But to only have that and no actual character dialogue?
---
Maybe you and I just like our Fallout a little different.
---
https://youtu.be/-S-PbhWhFhw
---
To everyone who follows me repeatedly doing the follow me emote because you want to share a legendary, thanks but I can't carry any more anyway.
---
yeah but it's W H A C K
---
It's a Bethesda game.  Once they patch it enough to be reasonably playable they call it good and let community modders fix the bugs.
---
The only things I was super looking forward to were the wallpapers and chicken coop. All the rest is filler garbage and could have been left out
---
She bugs out but when you server hop again, you can do the quest yes.
---
Very cool post. It's almost like game tokens you buy at an arcade...they can manipulate the cost of each game to make sure you need to buy more tokens.
---
And really, without representative police or government, we fall into the state of enslavement to whoever has the most money. Long live representational democracy.
---
I am. I guess this one just gets completed without me realizing it and I don't really look at the ones that are already checked off.   I don't start working on my daily stuff right away.
---
Might get royal jelly, honeys good but doesnt quite work for my theme. Taffy sound interesting, haven't heard of that in the game.
---
ACTIVITIES !
---
High lighted enemies have been weird lately to me.   Sometimes it’s working most times it not.
---
Forget legos. d4's.
---
Yeah I tried dropping one to  pick it back up. Also does not work. Bethesda are on to our slacker ways. Next time I have to break down 25 aluminum they’ll have probably fixed it so I can’t bulk and scrap my own.
---
I don't see a level 300 dying to a level 5 scorched as bad the same way I don't see a non bloodied not one shotting a level 10 enemy as something stupid or a problem.
---
It wouldn't make the build useless, it would give an actual risk to the reward, that reward being the highest damage output in the game.
---
Your comparison to vanguard doesn't checkout because bloodied reduces TTK so much that their damage output essentially doubles down on both offense and defense, while defensive setups don't dip into offensive capabilities.
---
Reread what you said about sneak, isn't it silly how you can press ctrl and essentially double your damage while also reducing the likelihood of getting hit, and that works throughout the entire queen fight, not just at the start.
---
That portable power pack is a real godsend.
---
Aah, I see it now. Same visual rendering
---
Oh, they technically have the right in the EULA, but I wasn't defending them on that. I was more tied up about the subscription. I hope your unjust ban gets overturned soon and you can get back in the game.
---
What I find amazing is that you can actually select the bright orange and yellow paint skin from F1st and use it in NW.
---
Go to events with higher levels running it. If you see something like line in the sand going or even radiation rumble with a bunch of people go there. Sleep first, eat your favorite XP buff food and just tag as many enemy before the higher levels kill them. My main is level 450 and my alt is now 130. The later I had gotten from 0 to that point pretty quickly riding the coat tails of others. Now I'm doing the actual quest lines and it's a breeze.
---
I'm told you can still build them, as with all other 1st cosmetics.  The tent, of course, isn't available without subscription.
---
I have an explosive combat rifle. Shooting the ground nearby does 30 damage, more than enough for a tag.
---
And here I am with 6 of yesterday's daily challenges auto completing... and 5 of this weeks weekly challenges auto completing... and yet again my support ticket gets auto locked, this time before even a response!
---
I did not realize it was a perk that enabled everyone to jump so high. I just thought all these lame fucks knew where marsupial serum spawns and ran to it every time 😂  now I gotta check my perk cards and see what I have... they're all set to tht defaults right now.
---
Todd Howard takes your flux when you die during a queen fight.
---
Seriously though it just vanishes.  They did this some time ago to address griefing.
---
They need to get stung on the inside of their throat by a mosquito
---
Been happening to me somewhat frequently for the last few months and I don't use power armor.  It's as if someone is using voice and other sound levels are being lowered... but no one is around.  Sometimes it cuts out for just a few seconds and comes back, other times it's much longer.  I think it may actually be a server instance problem.  For example - the last time it happened to me I was teamed with a friend, I quit to desktop, restarted and rejoined my friend on same server and immediately had the bug again.  Left that world, left the team and joined a new world - problem solved.
---
Some times it takes me 3 or 4 attempts running back and forth to get both to trigger, but I always get it solo.
---
I trigger one, run to the other and trigger it without waiting for the prompt, than run back to the first and keep doing that until the door opens.
---
If you wait for the prompt its like it doesnt register in time.
---
If it makes you feel any better (it probably won't) they didn't take your flux, just all your other junk.
---
The flux just vanishes when you die, even if you retrieve your bag.
---
Why? Because Bethesda.
---
It is when you know where they spawn.
---
South of the Overseer’s Camp - there’s a jumping puzzle located here, with a Bobblehead at the end.
---
Agricultural Center - upstairs, there’s a filing cabinet on the ground. In one of the drawers is a Bobblehead.
---
Savage Divide/The Mire Borders - inside Lost Home, found on the rooftop.
---
Charleston Trainyard - somewhere close to spawn, can't remember exact location, but it is there.
---
Greg's Mine Supply - you'll find a Bobblehead upstairs next to Greg's terminal
---
At Horizon's Rest - there's a crashed plane in the area, look inside the cockpit.
---
Spruce Knob - right hand side track as approaching Spruce Knob.
---
Johnson's Acre - where 3 dynamite plungers are up high on pinnacle rock.
---
North East Cemetery - top floor of building by the cemetery near top right of map, the union fort is above it.
---
Camp Adams - at the top of the watch tower, walk along the fallen tree and climb up.
---
Agricultural Center - inside a urinal in bathroom.
---
Increasing everything else to be on par with bloodied isn't the way to go, because the top 3 builds (bloodied at the very top, then junkies, then instigating) trivialize the entire game, the ideal goal shouldn't be trivialization, it should be rewarding the player but not turn it into an "I win everything" button.
---
It's pretty easy to tell this is a bug though. Under effects it will show berry mentats for 10 minutes with the INT boost and highlight living targets. After 5 minutes are up you can check under effects again and it will only show the INT boost remaining.
---
In fallout 4, shooting 1 bullet in the lever action rifle causes the reload animation to load all 5 rounds. They fixed that in 76 after like 6 months after release but it's still there in fallout 4...
---
If you are so angry at life you want to make other people feel like shit then it’s obvious.  I wish you good health and happiness
---
I thought that the captain cosmos power armor was real armor not just a skin
---
I don't mean to make an insult of it, but if you're dying in one hit as a bloodied you're doing something very wrong.
---
So you were upset about not having dialogue trees specifically?
---
There were still a lot of quests to do at launch, but it seems like you didn’t play very long to experience them 
---
I’m glad you are finally seeing them.
---
Mobile bush for NW.
---
Nice thinking, Snake.
---
The heart emote pisses me off no end tbf, i'm a grumpy 45 year old and Beth tries to make me some sort of knobby influencer, " HEY GUYS I HEART YOU, LOVE YOU ALL".....I hope they sell a sick bucket in the atom shop soon I may need it.
---
People have been complaining about this since like day one of the game. I don't think they will ever change it.
---
Lol, I thought that for a while too, but the marsupial serum is rare and you can only get it from safes, terminals or strong creatures.
---
afaik, diffuser has always been a Project Paradise drop. The recipe you need to buy from the Enclave is for Antibiotics.
---
yeah, but also you cannot select F1st ranger armor costume, but can select another exclusive costume. either they have weird logic or it's a very picky bug
---
That fair if I’m being honest I’m not the best with the lore of the fallout universe I was thinking of weapons that exist in our timeline and wasn’t entirely sure whether they were in the fallout universe. I still think bethesda could write in some other atomic weapons that we could use to do end game content.
---
I was in Radiation Rumble yesterday, down in the mines in my Chinese Stealth Suit collecting ore, and two Legendaries popped up next to me. I took a few shots and then did the 'Follow Me' emoji to let everyone else know to come down. I guess no one wanted to crazy radiation, because I just stood there for a minute, trying not to kill them. I eventually just jumped high enough on barrels so the ghouls couldn't reach me, and they ran upstairs. A second later on the stream, I hear "Hey, two Legendaries just showed up up here!"
---
What type of nukes are we dropping in the fallout universe then? If you don't mind me asking curious.
---
My problems with the ghillie skins is you can't use them in NW.  If you paid for F1st though, you can use that eyesore of orange and yellow painted armor skin in NW so you can stand out as a bright target.
---
impossible, I just got the hanging cage and I have completed every weekly, every single daily except for at most 1 daily, and repeatable only gives you a crappy 100 score, getting just a SINGLE rank would be like 20 levels for me now, and getting the rest would be about 1500 (100score*30(counting with avg 3000 score needed for a rank till rank100)*50levels),thats just impossible
---
Xbox. Sadly.
---
Anyone else think the 3 purchases I just dumb?  Why not just one?  Does Bethesda think anyone is buying BFFRWR handmades?  Everyone hits my vendor and buys the 3 items I put in there specifically for completing the challenge.  If it was buy one item they might actually look through what I am selling and buy something for more than 1 To 6 caps.
---
Id love to see them get all the way to 4 and T.H.U.G. Man I loved those 2 best of all. Awesome memories!
---
I don't know why people even do this. I started grinding on 2xp weekend and got to level 65, but once I hit 100 I'll never touch this game mode again. What do you get out of cheating at level 250+?
---
Same here. I often log on after a night of heavy drinking/gaming and my character is somewhere really weird, dying of thirst and over encumbered by like 600
---
Blueprint your camp and move it down there after the nuke is launched?
---
Or its vodka mixed with power aid.
---
That vault boy coo coo clock is dope. 
---
And is that a cage for pets!?!
---
I'm on a Xbox one x and it wasn't too bad but the last patch has really made it stutter and drop frames especially on line in the sand etc.
---
I was kidding bud. I stopped counting at 2.7k hours. I must be close to 3.5k now.
---
I'm a no lifer.
---
Is the last mode you played before the reset NW? If so, that also fucks challenges up.
---
They already have one called Fallout 1st lol.
---
These were all probably supposed to be part of a single atom shop outfit pack before being crammed into season 1 in the most awkward way possible.
---
I was a fan of this seasons thing just before it started, not so much anymore, at least not like it is now. Rather next time they just do special items (functional camp items) every 10 ranks, put all the cosmetics in the atom shop, and every rank award like 50 atoms.
---
I would use caution if you do so, or hoard materials, because there WILL be a jerk who levels your camp. I would put money on it.
---
Damn you OP, I've just done my dailies and logged off, now I gotta log back on FT across Appa just to blow a fucking train bell......but I just gotta do it.
---
Second everything
---
Go back to ur basement peasant.
---
Yes, only game restart usually helped me.  
---
But since I'm using only headphones - I've disabled all the input and output devices except the  headphones, since that time I'm not facing this issue. But this could be just a coincidence.
---
It's general fencing.
---
See those are when the games started getting a little too crazy for me! Don’t get me wrong, I played them, but original 3 are best IMO. It’s interesting also how different the ps1 and ps2 versions of thps4 were.
---
Well I was just goof around having some fun but if you're on xbox I got a few offers.
---
My bloodied QBML would like to know your location,  im currently sitting on 400 missiles (on the low end for me, I try to carry 800 max)
---
Ohhh shit! On point with the episode. Someone get this man a medal! Thanks.
---
So basically, you get griefed by BGS instead. I always make a beeline for a survival tent if there's one nearby and hit my stash immediately once the event is completed, just to be safe. I knew other players can/will take your junk, but did not know it was Bethesda that implemented this change. That just seems insane to me.
---
Fucking caltrops!
---
Are you a super mutant who wants humans to go extinct?
---
The Vault building set from FO4.  I know it's coming eventually, but people will be burnt out on the game before it arrives
---
I'm finding I can barely run 50 metres without a stutter or extreme frame drop. It's every couple of minutes and I'm on 1X too.
---
You can literally mod it onto a laser so why can’t we have it on a handmade or lmg
---
Seeing so many cool items, I wish they'd release it as DLC for Fallout 4 as well. Just pack it all up and sell it for a few bucks... easy money.
---
How? I thought camp damage from players was neutralized in adventure mode ages ago.
---
There's no official end date at this point. Bethesda just said it will last "around 10 weeks."
---
Well they seem to be implying that’s how it can be used at least
---
With double exp you could get 1,5k exp for killing a single enemy if you stacked int/exp buffs and 4k exp for doing events.
---
Line of defense event is particularly bugged. 20 scorched spawn in 1 place and you just earn mad exp. Get like 10 levels during a single event. And you need 10k exp for repeatable SCORE that grants 100 points.
---
So last night the second nuke on Xbox I got knocked down right when she was about to die no one revived me and I got in that respawn bug and had to wait 10 minutes to respawn I said great there goes my flux being I just found out about the stuff disappearing when you die. Well lucky for me when I respawned the rewards popped up and I was able to deposit it into my scrap box. Baby Jesus/Todd Howard was with me
---
I think THUG 2 and American Wasteland were when I kind of started to feel the quality drop off, for my tastes at least. Man I hope these remakes do good and we get a little Tony Hawk revival going on.
---
Glad not just me I was wondering if my new one x had a problem internally wouldn't mind but im only running it on 1080p not 4k so should be no problem.
---
I'd honestly buy this theory, but you can't use the ghillie items (except the rifle skin) in NW.
---
Definitely on board with all these suggestions. As a side note, you can use the prosnap camera to locate dead bodies, the names will appear in the corner of the screen when aiming at them (even exploded ones) but that's more of a workaround than a proper intended feature.
---
My space lady prefers the mothman bed, where as I think mothman is bogus so will only sleep in the unstoppables bed coz like super heros are real n shit....
---
That cow outfit is amazing. I must have it. I role play as a bear right now, with “do not feed the bear” signs at my camp (a rule not one person has broken yet, to my eternal chagrin). I’m ready for a change. 
---
Thank you for posting the info, friend.
---
In all other cases yes. If your camp is in the nuke zone when it hits, it’s all gone. You’ll have to repair the whole thing
---
Yes he did. Don’t know how true that one is. But I haven’t seen any post about being banned for god mode. Just posts from duper’s.
---
I hate that over a year after the change people still insist people are stealing their flux after they die at the SBQ.
---
Make friends, play Nuclear Winter, build fun camps, create your own challenges, then wait for and enjoy the scheduled events and content drops. There is a certain level of "making your own fun" here once you've done everything.
---
The only event I really notice this at is the Uranium something or other in Blackwater Mine, definetely appreciated as a noobie.
---
Damn that’s pretty evil...
---
I had it few times already. Restarting the game helps mate.
---
Geez... some people in this community are toxic. You could have said glad to hear not everyone, but you assumed and had to get vulgar.
---
People must love to be around you.
---
It's a weak move.
---
A dirty one's coming with Meat Week as a reward if that's more your speed.
---
Heroes
---
Hey, man, gotta make sure everyone gets a hit in
---
Sunk cost fallacy strikes again!
---
No, I always make sure the last thing I played was adventure because I've heard about the NW bug
---
you obviously never played bloodied extensively. it's entirely possible to get one shot even with all the relevant perks and legendaries.
---
it's misinformed people like you sharing their equivocated opinions that harm the game. because Bethesda actually listens sometimes.
---
you are rude. eat your keyboard.
---
Entitlement wise, and asset wise, it's a piece of fencing. You can put it around your pet if you want to, but there's no mechanics around it.
---
To each his own, have fun your way and I’ll do the same.
---
Lol just happened to me at a queen event died when fast traveling to nuke zone and then spawned in a scorched death hole
---
I have played for over a year and a half. And put in over 1100 hours. Took a couple of small breaks for other games but always came back. Currently over level 260 and have another level 50 character. 
---
The main reason I play it as much as I do is the people and friends I have made through the game. I also enjoy collecting things and it is just an easy game to jump on and off.
---
I've also completed every weekly and most dailies, and I'm at level sixty-seven.  The repeatables are small change, but they add up.
---
Also, the double XP weekend helped a lot.
---
I suppose so. . . But I REALLY like themed builds. So I keep buying 🤷
---
No kidding! Uranium Fever is such a great event when you have a good group of people like this working together to share the wealth. It also gets pretty funny when all of you are taking little dinky hits on legendaries because no one wants to be the one who kills them before everyone has gotten in on it so you wind up with a group of people pistol whipping a legendary mole miner over and over. Good times!
---
Cool people does it, other cool people learns It. That's why this community is so nice
---
Idk guy... I find 1-2 per hour. More if I’m trying.
---
Chance for 3 at venture
---
Chance for 2-3 dolly sods
---
Chance for 2 at tattoo parlour
---
Chance for 1 at marigold
---
All places I hit every day. Just need to look.
---
When I come back someone better have shopped some decks under their feet..... back soon.
---
You don’t even need to server hop to play the daily where you read terminal at fort defiance and kill a Scorch beast And deposit into vault tek. All you have to do is go back into fort defiance and read computer again
---
I would love more camp items honestly. And some basic skins.
---
Milestone rewards are not that bad.
---
Perhaps next time they should include unique craft plan for some new weapon. Heh space theme plenty of ideas. ""Looks at mothership zeta dlc for f3"
---
Yo event turret skins in zeta style. Or some space like interior build set as a final reward.
---
Power armor is quite cool I must say. No really much into Spandex fish globe suit , would rather see something more toned down like hazmat or space suit. (Star trek officer uniform-like)
---
Your moms a hoe
---
Well they shut that theory down pretty quickly, but it was still worth mentioning! I was actually just sitting here wondering if going straight to my homescreen last night will fuck me when I sign on today after work. Either way, I will try to leave the world before exiting the game from now on.
---
Yeah. The gun bash game is real. I love (hate) when I run up to politely bash the legendary, and Johnny One-Shot blows it away before I or anyone else get there.
---
Missiles and mini nukes take up a shitload of space as well.
---
I just want the deathclaw, not the fence...
---
The two aren't related, they just have the same name. I haven't bought any plasma caster plans and I can still put the pulse capacitor on plasma flamers.
---
No wonder they never release cool earnable camp things
---
Soooo many people treat camp building as the endgame :(
---
I blaaaame yyyyoooouuuu!
---
and also, trivializing being bad is entirely subjective. personally I still play this mess of a game to get stronger, no weaker. if you want to gimp yourself, then nothing's stopping you from playing medic.
---
but if they nerf the meta then I'll have no other option but to play with peashooters. which would drive me away from the game for good. not to mention a meta will always exist. people will just jump onto the next op bandwagon.
---
I always find a bobblehead on the desk at sal's grinders.
---
Show me on the doll where the lego touched you
---
Glad you posted this. I’ve found and dumped multiple green and clean whites because I was told they were worthless.
---
oh god please no
---
I transitioned away from it after I realized I was able to solo SBQ by staying in caution the entire way, 19% HP is more than enough to survive attacks with defensive legendaries, and even then these are just the second layer of making up for somehow managing to be detected in the first place.
---
I would say the complaints heavily outnumber the positive posts. I'm not trying to say people can't have an opinion, or there is nothing to complain about, but to say there are a lot of positive posts or it's even 50/50 is a stretch.
---
Well this one has a chance to drop the tattered field jacket though.
---
What gauss pump?
---
I agree, a group of cazadors would make me shit myself back in the New Vegas days.
---
This may be somewhat rectified by the “One Wasteland” update.
---
It is, unless they use explosive bait or a nuke.
---
Speaking of highly annoying bugs that have been around for far too long, how about fixing the damage bug and making automatic tesla rifles playable?
---
The foot &gt;:o
---
I had just started the game, and couldn't bring myself to restart in the middle of Radiation Rumble.
---
Probably the most disappointed weapon in the game
---
He had it coming
---
I think it's safe to say both of these things don't make sense in the fallout universe. Maybe I'm not a familiar with something very inherent to Appalachia and that's the reason why they've gone the route with some of these items, but a lot of times it just seems like some dude at Bethesda Austin has a thing for mascots and that's why we've got mascots. But who are we kidding. That type of shit was put in the game because fortnite.
---
Beth?
---
Don't you wish that evil on me
---
People who spawn camp events are the worst. You are level 450 with every weapon you want. Do you really need ALL the XP and 1* lead pipes? It's become a challenge to even hit anything at rad rumble or uranium fever
---
I mean. . . It kinda is. You can only kill the SBQ so many times. But the.camp items on the season pass are pretty neat. 
---
Regardless of whether people bought them often or not, Bethesda wouldn't release new stuff for free. That's not business model for 76. Been that way since launch.
---
I had a great time joining cheater discords to watch the tears last week, now it's just disappointing seeing them all patting each other on the back for getting through this traumatic experience by the big bad evil bethesda. And the ones whose mules got unbanned are sharing all the duped loot so we are exactly back where we started, just waiting for the next dupe so they can all spread their trash around again
---
Well, you can't equip armor with it, so there is a huge downside
---
No one ever seems to see my 'follow me' emote. I sometimes wonder if it even works lol. But I do it anyway
---
It didn't come with the backpack.  I don't think
---
My kid bought it but I don't use it. 
---
I think it came with the orange suit, bubble helmet, blaster skin, taser probe weapon thing, and satellite dish
---
Tenchu Z
---
Yep, got this at least once a day.
---
At least you didn't find a red and sell it for a few caps 
---
(basically if you look for info on the red asylum there's threads from the early days with people saying they sold or scrapped them)
---
It's a shame. I'm trying to get hold of a bobblehead at the moment and I see you sell them in bulk.
---
I got a bunch from a sbq before
---
Gimme perk load outs, then I will happily swap OMA for ya but until then sorry bud no can do, also so many people moan about ammo, theres sooooooo much of it in game I must throw 5-10k rounds away every day.
---
Wow. How much does it cost to hire and integrate ten staff members and then pay their salaries for, let's say, three years? You should buy more Atoms instead.
---
NW didn't come out until mid-late 2019. Even the whole game didn't come out until late 2018
---
Supereasy. Go to the lighthouse, it's in a window
---
Centaurs.... 👀👀
---
You can just buy the spots for 150 atoms... open the map, hit the button with the square shape and unlock the prize and board position.
---
They are actually upping their game with the atom shop recently. 👏
---

---
I too would love to see more space themed shit...i dont get why all this ghillie shit is on this board.
---
Trivializing being bad is indeed subjective and we can't say what the intented power level of endgame builds should be unless Bethesda says it.
---
But your comment about wanting to gimp oneself and going medic is silly and shows the importance of normalizing, why should somebody going the support route be considered gimping yourself? Should it not be that a support build is a good choice to opt into rather than the option for someone who intentionally wants to come as close to being challenged by the mechanics as possible?
---
How about instead of medic being a joke, they normalize bloodied and buff support builds like medics to incentivize said bloodied and medic builds to group up together instead of everyone doing the same build?
---
Maybe you're looking for another game. Good news, though, because there is no shortage of PvP games out there.
---
This is literally me. Started playing 2 months ago, learned of the rarity of this red dress, obv had to get it. I've searched the asylum hundreds of times hoping to be lucky, chasing that high, and still to this day have not found it. Saw a post yesterday with some scumbag duper who bragged about duping dozens of red dresses and dropping them at the vault 76 entrance for noobs. Like. I don't know why that makes it less fun for me, but it does. I don't want to trade for it or buy it, but knowing that when I finally do find it, there's really nothing special about it bc it's been duped to death and/or the assumption will be that I got it through nefarious means. Idk. It's all stupid, really.
---
OMG junk walls and other raider/wasteland themed junk. Perfect for my raider arena build.
---
Ghillie looks terrible. Like some plastic strips glued in the armor. But how did the OP spend to finish the season? I am at rank 62 I think.
---
Oh SNAP! I never thought about that! And I snap all of possum requirements on dead creatures 🤦‍♂️
---
I have to know what that jeweled staff and torch are skins for. 
---
Does that barrel planter thing have a function, or is it just decorative?
---
I'm aware, not going to waste money on lunchboxes and ghillies though
---
I knew about the red, that’s what got me looking. Found the greens and whites and asked and was told not worth the effort. Found a brown and held onto it. Your list was very helpful, thank you!
---
Toxic player complains about toxicity being thrown at him .... zzz
---
A M-80.
---
Goofy or regular?
---
Dude it’s been this way since launch. There used to be way worse duping problems before they added vendors
---
Exactly... horde bosses shouldn't be weak enough to get killed by other creatures! bosses should always enemies like a super mutant behemoth/ mirelurk queen/ scorched ghoul yao guai. Bloatfly hordes shouldn't even exist, unless somehow the boss could fly around in an eyebot helmet 😅
---
Grognax Axe and Super Sledge, respectively.
---
It's a rain barrel that collects dirty water, so it's really mostly cosmetic.
---
Image of vault boy also appears on the screen
---
No, when you said that about children it just sounded kinda pervy and nasty but that was most likely my nasty ass mind
---
just tame one :)
---
Should be power armor fist upgrade and it would be neato
---
I’ve been enjoying the game and not focusing on the legendary run, just treat it as added bonuses
---
Pretty common on the Box
---
[PLEASE tell me that this is an arena and the deathclaw is included.](https://i.imgur.com/baXF6z9.png)
---
Pain train looks Hella cool but it feels like you do nothing when you run at enemy
---
I just recently built a munitions store becuase i use a melee build, and i rarely use amunition. My most sold amunition was plasma cores, .45, and 5.56: i made over 3k caps in 3 hours.
---
You would love pub g lobbies back in the day.
---
It's just a fence.
---
Why are you the way that you are?
---
I bet super mutants also have nasty asses, plot (much like super mutant skin) thickens
---
Hold up there satan
---
Some guy did that to me in the middle of a nuke zone witha 3 star legendary. I got an instigating shotgun that i immediately scripped to buy several two star legendaries. I got some good armor out of it
---
I’m banned
---
nothing against buffing prefixes. nerfing them, though? no, never.
---
you also completely missed the point. it's not that medic's bad, that's not even a question I posed. but rather that you have the option not to output high damage if you, for some god forsaken reason, do not wish to.
---
if they nerf bloodied or even sneak, I'll not be afforded the same option. I'll *have* to play a weaker build whether I like it or not.
---
I know you think that's a testament to how op bloodied and sneak are, but you can achieve the same with a zealot's UGL and armor set. it'd be a lot easier, too.
---
it's also funny how you're ignoring the fact sneak multipliers don't trigger if your target is in combat with something else. unless you clear the entire area surrounding fissure prime, chances are the Queen is gonna latch onto some crab or even a roach. and now you're dealing half the damage a heavy gunner would.
---
Yeah
---
Yeah I would’ve loved to see more space themed items and icons not some weird blood eagle hammer and a chicken coop...? (Not hating on the chicken coop just why would it be in a space themed season??)
---
I would’ve loved a Rocket Propellor that could shoot out flames (but wouldn’t fly) to put at my airship CAMP. I would’ve loved to see alien weapon skins and UFOs or something.
---
I recently read a comment by a guy stating that he bought $50 worth of atoms to reward Bethesda for addressing the recent duping exploit.
---
I'm going to laugh when starfield comes out loaded to the brim with both microtransactions and bugs. Everyone will express moral shock at it, only to buy the game anyways and validate the garbage business practices.
---
You’re welcome!  I should point out that those are POTENTIAL spawn locations.  It’s still a random chance of one appearing at any given spot. But I just found mine after the third or fourth search.
---
Mmmmmm, super thiccy mutant
---
As much as I would love to see the Cazador in 76 it would not make sense. In the States the tarantula hawk wasp is native to the southwest desert regions. Maybe Assassin Bugs, Cow Killers, Black Widows, Brown recluse spiders, Timber Rattlesnakes and Copperheads on the other hand would be canon.
---
I'm PA user so 3rd person just feels slow and cumbersome also my aim is terrible in 3rd person, I couldn't hit a barn door with a banjo at two feet away, but 1st person I'm like laser guided pew pew.
---
I was in Uranium Fever last night, a guy killed the first legendary just by himself, despite the fact there was at least 7 people there. The second one spawned right next to me, so I threw up the come here emote, tapped it with a couple of rounds to register and I just stood there after that while others gathered up.
---
Someone got the kill shot, then the original guy has the nerve to start complaining and expressing his displeasure, but it serves him right. 
---
What's good for the goose isn't good for the gander seemed to be his attitude and he didn't like being on the receiving end of it. One Violent Night suffers from this quite commonly too.
---
Oh, ok. Mine was something like 12,000. Wow! That's a lot of tickets for one day.
---
I pretty much use 3rd person 100% of the time in NW matches, but in Adventure mode, I’ll go 3rd person when outside, and 1st person when inside/looting/shootin’
---
Punji boards.
---
Oh I'm back to being confused, so frog legs doesn't make you jump high? What does it do? Sorry I'm at work and jonsing for some FO lol
---
BruhThesda at it again
---
Playing with friends
---
Ya i went thru like 30 finally got one in ash by mount blair
---
Been happening a lot these past few days for me on PS4.
---
Don't die. Carry a rad suit.
---
You mean three encrypted?
---
No it does lol, I was just saying that getting the serum would be rare since serums are rare so you wouldn’t see everyone with it right away, but yes, frog legs does make you jump high
---
thicc mutant nasty ass
---
Commission Lego to make d4s and use that
---
Yep i have this occasionally, just feels/sounds weird a quick reload sorts it out for me, so another quick question (sorry for the hi-jack) but during Death robot sheep squatch event, sometimes the sound goes all weird, is that part of the event or dodgy audio?
---
Have you never fought a Mirelurk King?
---
This may be a dumb question, but is there any way to tell if these are going to atom shop items? Score rewards for the next season? Mix of both?
---
I was thinking more D&amp;D since, you know, polyhedral dice, but sure.
---
Level 444, thank you very much.
---
It does a little because all my other junk was still in my bag?
---
Strong skipped leg day, but we all know the Fawkes does leg day every day
---
Ooooh ok cool, that's good 😄 thank you for the info!
---
Beth made Flux disappear because there were people purposefully killing other players with certain methods after the event just to get more flux.
---
Don’t blame Beth blame the people abusing it.
---
He just checked and he got all three jumpsuits too! He thinks it was from when we did One Violent Night.
---
Still, looks good for an arena build.
---
This is the best way to go about this. You have to either have multiple buildings with small footprints blueprinted or one larger one with just a small footprints blueprinted. Test it in advance to make sure you can plop it doesn't easily and walla, bone apple teeth.
---
I just enjoy challenge. Playing all the Fallout games since 3, I miss the dread and actual danger of the wasteland. Sure, alot of it is because powerful builds and gear are easier to attain in the newer games, however the enemies have gotten softer, and less aggressive.
---
I come from games like WoW where there were world bosses that would stomp you in two hits without a proper organized team of 10+
---
I know FO76 is less players, pseudo MMO, etc. but there should be some creatures that you simply cannot solo. Whether they need to add more punishing mechanics (like poison cloud aoe, or an attack that can only be blocked by certain weapon types etc.) or more difficult creatures.
---
*An m-80
---
Nice...Yeah they drop from events that are in the savage divide region
---
I'm not against high damage, though I am indeed personally against having such an obvious outlier that effectively negates any reasons to go with anything else if you're even remotely interested in both efficiency and variety
---
Oh also I'll reply to your other post in that post so we don't have to  reply to 2 separate post to the same person if you don't mind, I'm not ignoring sneak dmg on in-combat targets because a vast majority of the time the targets are simply not busy, you sneak in, wipe the area clear and move on, clearing the SBQ area is practically the only time you may have to spend a few minutes clearing superficial adds.
---
The thing about the SBQ example is that it can be taken to any other parts of the game, whereas zealot is a very enemy-specific build and even then it's still less efficient than bloodied at its only job.
---
Make sure you include that in your ticket to Bethesda support, I'm sure they appreciate dealing with someone who's polite and reasonable.
---
Very nice I feel like I’m always getting downed or just die at the end I’ve had the respawn thing happen to me on the Queen once and I just gave up for the night lol
---
Deathclaws seem to do decent damage, I had a glowing one sneak oneshot me once because I was too stupid to turn around and see what was making the weird noises behind me in the mire.
---
The real reason they dont do any damage is that they never live long enough to even hit you considering they die in one to two hits.  The very first time I killed one in a single shot I was like level 35, that doesn't seem right at all.
---
How is a mile long path an eternity?
---
I thought it was supposed to spawn with the quest..
---
Replied in the other post so we don't have to go back and forth in 2 different posts :)
---
Well they had radscorpions in 4, which made no sense either since scorpions aren't native anywhere near Massachusetts. Unless we're to believe they all started with pet scorpions, the way they explain how deathclaws exist in so many locations where chameleons aren't remotely native to.
---
Most people to do it (me too) but there's sometimes one fucking idiot with an auto silenced explosive handmade killing them before anybody gets a hit.
---
It’s a known bug.
---
I've killed countless Mirelurk Kings, usually in one magazine from any of my weapons.
---
It was a good thing. People would go out of their way to kill others just for more flux. Now they don’t after this change.
---
This was a long time ago and I still remember people dying from players a lot once the event completed.
---
It's caused by cunning tent placement.
---
File name. They're all prefixed ATX, while Score rewards are prefixed SCORE. Nothing for Season 2 has been added yet, and I suspect we won't see any of it until the next PTS.
---
Someone placed their camp or a survival tent at the spawn point for the scorched in this event... the result? Mass of flesh spawning right in front of the sonic generator.
---
It was pretty funny imo, the first time like three people got there and we're waiting for the last person and the guy killed it. Then the next time same. Then after that everyone just tried to kill it first lol
---
Yes, they are spawned due to quest, but once one is killed - another is spawned again, I just killed like 5 of them
---
Exactly why I wanted that skin too. Really sad I could not apply it on The Fixer.
---
How I'd you beat the season already? I'm still stuck in the first part. The light blue area
---
How does one get this bug to occur
---
Glad to help. I do prefer your idea, you'd think there should be a mentats flavor for it, but at least the camera works for now.
---
I mean all the other stuff was still in my junk bag and the guy was standing over it when I died and when I got back to the bag almost to say yeah I took it. I’m sure you’re right tho I was just a little bummed but I mean if it just vanishes then I guess it does
---
I'd be happy if the stars Wallpaper could also be applied to floors and ceilings.
---
Exactly, that's tough in this game. Everything else is 4-5 rounds 😂 
---
The problem is a lack of scalability for higher level players, which will /theoretically/ be fixed with one wasteland
---
And the winner is ......... (drum roll)...........Mr Hacked Weapon ! congratulations your're an asshole. (not OP he/she's cool AFAIK I've never met them).
---
I know i had 1 bought it months ago for 5k i thought they removed them when they removed the snallygaster spit explosions ill have to check
---
There is no EULA, just the TOS.
---
While it can be used interchangeably, it's not the same. TOS is when someone offers a service, like Beth with letting us use their services.
---
Thanks!  Guess I'll have to start saving up some atoms then
---
Well seeing my hometown where I still live get brought up makes me want to dive into talking about some coal mining history. Harlan is both a city and county in Kentucky and is actually known for labor wars between miners and mine owners in the 30s that escalated to the point of shootings and bombings bringing federal troops to the area, leaving the area known as "Bloody Harlan". There is a folk song by an author whose name escapes me that is titled "Which Side Are You On?" about these strikes. The same ugly issues came up again in the 70s, but with video evidence in the form of an award winning documentary "Harlan County, USA". This time around there were assassinations in the area and miners shot while striking until one death was seen as a breaking point. The treatment of coal miners over the years has led to a unique culture in Harlan of seeing coal miners as heroes and actually causes a big political stir against any alternative energy because as the people here like to say "Coal keeps the lights on" and there are common bumper stickers that will say things like "Coal miners daughter", and with most coal plants here shut down now the region is in rough shape with practically only fast food and retail jobs along with a massive opioid crisis and aging population stuck on a fixed income. Appalachian people like from Harlan are actually somewhat considered to be an oppressed people because of the horrific treatment at the protests and the silence about their issues. This came out kinda rambling but I never get the chance to talk about the storied history of my hometown in a relevant context so  I got excited. Playing 76 and seeing all these locations that look like home and exploring mines and being reminded of these stories really is an amazing atmosphere for a Fallout game.
---
Finally, raider content!!
---
Atom bombs, like those used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
---
The A bomb was less efficient, that's why the major cities were destroyed in the Fallout great War but the outlying suburbs were only slightly damaged.
---
Its why the bombs had such small blast radiuses and why so many people survived.
---
How am I toxic talking about my friends? Just because you’re upset with their **GAMING** choices doesn’t mean they’re bad people.
---
No, you’re toxic and trying to deflect onto me to save face. Get out of here.
---
Delete the post, please.  Unless you want it nerfed
---
An interesting subject indeed.  To me it fully illustrates the bad side of unchecked Capitalism.  Most often, "big business" when left unchecked, very rarely will do what is "right" as opposed to what's best for their profits.  
---
Tactics like these during the Industrial Revolution lead directly to organized labor unions, child labor laws, workers rights, etc.  And it was a bloody battle in some cases.  
---
This is also related to pollution laws and regulation here in the US.  Again left unchecked, many big business industries, like the textile industry at one point, would happily dump all sort of harmful waste products into the lakes and rivers just to get rid of it and have absolutely zero care or concern for who might drink or be exposed to these chemicals.
---
I agree, they should definitely be alot more durable, I haven't been hit by one in awhile, but on my full HP junkie build, I remember them taking about a quarter of my health if they got a smack, but like you said, I generally gun them down as soon as they are in vats range.
---
This. The one time I broke this rule was because we had a low level doing Riding Shotgun with us and he felt overwhelmed at a couple of spots. So I told him to just kill anything that came near him. I didn't want to add the stress of only doing so much damage to a legendary so everyone could get in on it. It actually helped his confidence and the next few events he was waving us over. 😁
---
True, rank has nothing to do with WL though, poeple had started with those at launch of 76. Just saying that at my rate of playing, I could reach l.300 in 9 months, so I think these wigh ranks are legit
---
I do that just to be fair.
---
Welcome to the Wastelands. Enjoy the begining because it's, from my personal experience, the best part of the game
---
Colonel 100 approves! 
---
(For the people familiar with Battlefield Friends)
---
Robot cazodors with assaultron heads.
---
The problem with OVN is there can be so many ghouls it's quite easy to enter vats and kill it before you've realised it was a legendary.  I don't mean to do it but shit happens sometimes.
---
I am aware that they are not the same weapon. That was literally my whole point. That particular mod for the Caster will attach to a standard plasma and produce a cool effect.
---
It may not work on the Scorchbeast Queen anymore, but a regular Scorchbeast can have both of it’s hind legs crippled to render it immobile and unable to attack, even when it’s flying midair, but it’s better just to cripple it’s wings anyway.
---
It does work, but there are no legendary power armor pieces.  With unyielding or vanguard pieces, you can get a lot more strength.
---
Naked, immortal enemies tend to have no heads :D
---
The dying robots in whitespring bunker are hillarious.
---
I've made an absolute fortune from looking for the red. If you just wanna find the uniforms that's fine. 
---
BUT if you spend another 2 minutes in there you can find other stuff worth caps. There's the ballistic fiber which spawns. There's all the steel and plastic near the lift and the 4th floor. Bobblehead on the 4th. Lots of dog food (sells well). Also there's a plan that can spawn on the top floor near the power armor stations. The plans aren't super rare but i was selling them for 1k+
---
Yesterday I fought a 3 star glowing deathclaw and 2 1 star blood eagles and a bunch of regular blood eagles simultaneously and after letting them duke it out and wear each other down I swept in to mop up. A player from my public team appeared and the location fucking reset itself as I was looting and scrapping bodies. I got blindsided and killed a few times. I was annoyed but it was okay still. Then this guy goes and steals my dropped loot and I got pissed and followed him around until he died and then stole it back.
---
Never experienced that, but I will say that if one is interested in farming XP or scorchbeast brains, surface to air event is by far the best and pops up fairly frequently. Besides the scorched waves, my record for that event is 11 scorchbeasts, with a fair amount being legendary (albeit one star for the most part). 
---
With enough buffs they can give over 1500xp each plus all the little gits running about.
---
Deathclaws were genetically-engineered creatures developed by the United States military to replace humans during close-combat search-and-destroy missions. They were probably transported to military facilities all around the States. Now scorpions in Massachusetts, you got me there.
---
As a new comer to the game after watching my girlfriend play since release in the week I have played and reaching nearly level 40 the amount of times people who just 1 shot and run off and I am standing there like... I needed that for a daily Q\_Q
---
This is ridiculous. Bethesda is a large enough company that they *could* beef up the staff over at Austin if they really *really* wanted to but they choose not to. They are stuck in their ways and seem to refuse to realize running a live service game with a skeleton crew is a recipe for disaster.
---
I have no problem supporting the game through FO1st or Atom purchases, but donating to a AAA company that is in no short supply of cash is where I draw the line. If they want to hire more staff use the money from the subscription and cosmetic purchases, you know, the methods of monetization that were *supposed to* be paying for everything, which should include hiring more staff. I'm not about to just give away my money to an incompetent company for nothing in return.
---
I'm on PC and only junk tab get stored when storing all?
---
Maybe they walk up and down the mile long path for all eternity
---
It's more the nightstalker itself I was on about, there's almost always someone that just goes right ahead and greases it without waiting for anyone else. You can almost set your watch by it when you see people piling out of the door in what often ends up as a futile effort to get a hit in.
---
if you want efficiency then go with the meta build. this is how it works with every single game out there, single player or otherwise. nerfing bloodied doesn't change this.
---
your sneak multiplier breaks if there's anyone in the area. and if there's no one, well, then I don't know why we're even having this conversation. you want sneak in Fo4 nerfed as well? no matter how you put it I see little reason to nerf a mechanic that a)doesn't work when you need it most (boss events) and b)requires heavy investment to be efficient.
---
sure you can slap sneak 3 and crouch around with a silenced hunting rifle. but if you want to be as op as you're painting the mechanic to be, then you'll need absurdly high agility, excruciatingly hard to get legendary gear, etc.
---
and again, my point was that soloing the queen is not exactly a noteworthy feat, not whether zealot's is a good prefix.
---
Lmao why are you wearing that stupid helmet anyway accidental bullion purchase
---
You are Satan
---
I got like +/-400 xp per one  
---
out of those 5-7 I got 1 legendary  
---
and this spawn issue (lets call it this way) is way too rare and unpredictable
---
There is no shortage of Fallout games out there either. Only one fallout mmo and it's Weenie Hut Jr.
---
True
---
I tested crippling. Using cripple perk with no stagher and she lands every. Single. Time. My team of 3 self included took her down in a matter of minutes just coordinating strikes. Epic
---
But that’s what I’m saying. Bloodied already has the negative of almost everything killing you. God forbid you fall more than 4 feet and you die. 
---
Mr.Gutsy’s only have to shoot me for about two seconds and I die. Idk if they are overpowered or something but they kill me so easily. Same with assaultron. My HP is always between 20-30. So trust me, unless I’m fighting level 1s, they still do a decent amount of damage. 
---
Theoretically, let’s say you guys get what you want. And people with bloodied weapons get that *extra damage inflicted to player while wielding*
---
Some people with bloodied builds might not even notice the difference too much, because of serpendity (forgive my typos) and ricochet. I honestly don’t think Bethesda would be able to implement something like that tbh. And they will go from having people pissed because bloodied is too OP and ruining the fun. To pissing off customers that run a bloodied build. 
---
You go from pissing off and hurting a select group of people, to making them happy and hurting a different group. 
---
I don’t think unyielding and bloodied, or any other legendary effect or armor will ever get a buff/nerf. 
---
If anything, your best case could be one day they are gone from the spawning pool, they will become legacy armors. 
---
Sneak might work different for you, because even with 10 people shooting and punching the Queen, when I try to sneak, it only last about 10 seconds until she sees me and starts attacking me. And that’s with my sneak being level 3.
---
This has been in the game since the game released. You don’t need a tent to do this method either. 
---
It’s not a glitch or a bug. They spawn like that because if someone is standing in the spawn zone they don’t instantly die from scorch attack when they spawn.
---
I’m surprised people just found this out recently.
---
So now you know why Responders got wiped out
---
I'm sure they're sorry you don't like the FREE content added to the game...
---
That's on Xbox right? I was there a week ago and I fkng loved the experience
---
Someone kept doing that during uranium fever yesterday and it was greatly appreciated
---
You can see the logic. Look,  people actually played nuclear winter for a ghillie suit. Quick,  whip up ghillie everything for the legendary run. Don't test it, just throw it in there,  they will go nuts for it. Hence why most of it is currently garbage
---
Fuck that,  I hope they step on a dozen D4.
---
If you want karma, yes.
---
Also for tons of karma try the following high yield phrases.
---
-"It just works"
---
-"Bugthesda"
---
-"Doesn't play their own game"
---
-"I have over 1600 hours in this game and this makes me lose faith"
---
"You mean people would actually complete the SCORE system or \*gasp\* pay to unlock the skin?"  
---
&lt;Everybody runs around and screams hysterically&gt;
---
Actually wasn't aware of all that deathclaw background, so thanks for that. But yeah, Boston scorpions always bugged me. They at least work in 76 since there's one scorpion species in the southern Appalachian states that could feasibly be hanging around WV.
---
Don't know if I'd classify her as a hippie, but that's hilarious!
---
I went to about half the different spawn locations today before I found one, took me well over an hour and just bobblehead hunting, then I went and started doing my normal daily activities....and found 2. fml
---
how many more times are you willing to buy something admist claims that it will 'fund the game going forward'
---
I did that like three times and every time I did I dropped my legendary for someone because I felt so bad but now I just run up and bash it with my Gatling plasma
---
Fucking Trogdor.
---
Guess i was wrong they do still exist
---
Its their job. You chill.
---
It just works! The bushy camo covering your view in first person is a feature to make it more immersive, like how your vision can be impeded when you are actually using sniper cover or a blind!
---
It takes 2 seconds to google a list of every bobblehead in the game.
---
Personally, the only items I really gave a shit about were the chicken coop and the giant Sheepsquatch plush, and I underestimated its size when I planned to put it on my bed 😂
---
shhhh
---
It'd make sense, if the ghillies could actually be used in the battle royale mode
---
I know the ammo converter is a PITA to use now but that has really been one of the only rewards I have cared about. Hopefully they improve the UI soon like they said they would.
---
Fuck no
---
Oh baaaaaash. Why didn't I think of that. People always yell at me for killing the Legendary.
---
PC, xbox, PS4?
---
Yes, but in my case only travelling to Vault 76 and only being dropped at Vault 96 - it's happened a bunch of times now though.
---
Very nice. I do my best to make sure the raider lives so I can extort him and not have to go back to that buggy jerk.
---
Finally... I'm waiting for the same
---
Big Brother Godd Howard doesn't want us bloodied builds to auto-die when we FT to our camps.  All hail Big Bro for looking out for us.
---
"Which side are you on, boys? Which side are you on?"
---
Now you're getting me all nostalgic. I haven't been back to Harlan since my grandpa died. That was several years ago. He's buried down in Loyall next to his momma. My father was in the military so we moved around everywhere, but I spent my summers in Kentucky. Mostly over in Pineville and up in Corbin with my cousins. Man, those were the days. Running all over Pine Mountain. Eating ice cream at the Druther's. Good times.
---
Centaurs were one of my favorite enemies in FO3. I first played as a child and was terrified the first time I saw one. Went back as an older teen a few years later and they were still one of the creepiest enemies imo. They really helped set the tone that this was a twisted apocalyptic hellhole. The designs from OG games were great too.
---
I was incredibly disappointed when they were replaced by mutant hounds. A roided up green dog is nowhere near as horrifying as the twisted abominations that were centaurs. At least we have the Wendigo Colossus, which is almost like a spiritual successor in a way.
---
Very wise choice, it is an excellent gun.  I used one for at least a few months early on before switching to bloodied.  If you were ps4 I'd give you one, I save them.

You can sit on the cliff at a certain point which makes them spawn at the furthest hole in the wall or  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hf0dh7/how\_to\_make\_line\_in\_the\_sand\_quick\_and\_easy\_does/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hf0dh7/how_to_make_line_in_the_sand_quick_and_easy_does/)

*Who's laughing now?*
---
It took me 2 seconds to google a list of every one in the game and less than a minute to fast travel and pick up the first one on the list.
---
Seriously folks, if you aren't capable of putting 1 minute's effort into something then just shut the hell up.  You're a major drain on the community.
---
I spent a dollar in game I literally own them! /s
---
Woah there, that’s taking it too far
---
We don’t want to hurt the mosquito so let’s just use rusted nails instead
---
Try placing a random foundation, and drop part of the train car into it. I’ve had sporadic luck doing that, but it’s really picky.
---
Hate to see what they say when their tendies are burnt.
---
C'mon man, its made by Bethesda. You should expect it by now.
---
Bummer. Have you contacted Bethesda to make a bug report?
---
It'd be weird to see Cazadors in any title set before New Vegas. They didn't mutate from insects, they were created and genetically modified by the Think Tank a little before the courier gets a bullet to the face. It would be a canonical issue to see them in West Virginia
---
That's a troll, right? 
---
Zenimax has so much money they could hire tons of people and not even notice it in their books...
---
I recently got fallout 1st for a month (to farm junk and never worry anymore) and it's so damn good to run these events all alone, you can one shot enemies and get all legendaries without feeling bad or having these dicks around, in 3 days playing i got more legendaries than i usually did in weeks playing on normal servers, leveled up 20+ levels while before this it would be 1 level per day at max cause everytime i went to high level places most enemies were dead already, it's incredible how good an *online* game is when playing alone, sucks that it's behind an paywall, and a expensive one.
---
I shouldn't tell you that the colour change menu is still in the code just disabled should I?  
---
I had a bugged character selection a few months ago, the bottom of the screen was the "select your save" list and the top was the big PIP rectangle that would show the result of fiddling with the pipboy RGB sliders.  
---
I think it's locked out to simplify the lighting render for other players in the world. That's why we only have 4-5 variants of colour in the mining helmet.
---
Because somehow this build system is more jacked up than FO4. I'd rather try to build in Hangman's Alley!
---
Gamers are the new Karens.
---
Been trying since I noticed the problem. The site seems to be down for me. Not sure if just down for everyone.
---
That's exactly why I'm not going to move my camp again, mine was built post wastelanders, but I built it at the waterfall in the mire, and my house starts at the top of the waterfall where my front door is and ends at the bottom of the waterfall where my basement is so the waterfall is in the middle of the house
---
Wasn't the h bomb made only few years after why wouldn't they of been able to create one again not been funny just like history.
---
Stagger and cripple dont stack. This is misinformation. For SBQ use no stagger.
---
I do it but nobody responds because I’m a hermit who avoids contact outside of work and has a private server because I’m a sellout moron who licks Todd Howard’s balls
---
I did this yesterday during Uranium Fever! I hate when people one shot them so I'm trying to do my part to help my fellow wastelander!
---
Yeah I mean how long does it take to code an online game? Like a week at the latest?
---
Another day, another player complaining about something that they put in at no charge, aka free
---
 I thought it was a PA nappy/diaper.
---
It should be separate set exclusive to enclave members in the future. It should give fire/explo/stumble resistances or sth.
---
And be BLACK
---
Wahhh why doesn't Bethesda talk to us.
---
Yeah I wonder why...hmmm.
---
Right.  And FO1 Tents made it much easier.  And it is now catching on.  And it will be addressed if everyone is doing it and talking about it.  See One Violent Night.
---
It's 10 weeks for the season. Halfway *should* be achieved around week 5, regardless of the markup per level since it's a negligible 25/per. Maybe week 6 to compensate. But definitely not week 2.
---
For what it's worth, I made this for some friends.  I mainly run a Bloody Unyielding SS Gauss Shotgun build.
---
BTW add Bloody Mess for over 2k damage
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ86iUq-\_vQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ86iUq-_vQ)
---
I have a slim and a pro and run it on both.  If I get a blue screen I have found if I occasionally do a database rebuild and reboot it helps a great deal.  Over time it does seem to slowly get worse so now I do that about every other week and it helps a lot.  Sometimes it seems worse but I upgraded my internet to 1G and that helped as well.
---
And yes on other games I never do that either.
---
Jesus
---
There are good XP farming runs on youtube, also ways to boost XP like food, INT, chems etc.  Line in the Sand if someone has a Fallout 1st tent is your best option.  Guided Meditation is also good, as is Radiation Rumble,  Project Paradise and One Violent Night, although for the last 3 if you're going for XP you're not really doing the event.
---
Way less suicide
---
Agreed, I’m always in there grabbing the ballistic fiber and checking for the outfits. Yeah, I’ve had a little luck with plans that spawn on the fourth floor by the Power armor Station, that’s where I got my first fixer plan.
---
That place kinda looks creepy af. I dig it.
---
They downvote you because you're right.
---
Did I say anything about any of this no I didn't I said you do get explosive damage and I showed how to fight her and how not to kill your ammo nor fuck up everybody else from getting there damage rating and I learned how to kill her ass but trail and error tested every weapon I could.
---
...seriously?
---
I disagree, far from "almost everything" kills you in one go, your only examples are enemies that are universally dangerous to any build while still most easily dealt with by bloodied by a very large margin, not to mention it's still not a guaranteed to get killed in one or even two hits from those you mentioned if you build properly - and to top it all, this is all assuming you get spotted in the first place, which considering how easy sneaking is and the TTK of bloodied, should almost be reason enough to be killed in the first place by these enemies.
---
Those changes would affect the people who run a bloodied build "effectively" (quotes because it's not exactly a feat to put on a couple perks or run around a corner to reset aggro), and those who don't notice the difference wouldn't have a reason to complain.
---
Those who do run it "effectively" would still be at the top of the damage build so in essence their goal is still met, only the people who want a trivial experience would even consider quitting over that, and even then, who's to say it wouldn't bring in more people due to introducing more reasons to build in different ways?
---
I don't see a nerf as being pissed on, if anything it encourages trying out new styles and promotes a more varied environment for players who like efficiency and variety, besides, bethesda shits in all our mouths and people aren't quitting over being fucked financially, would they quit over their build still being at the top of the damage ladder but also being encouraged to try other builds or welcoming other builds to complement theirs?
---
The point about sneak is that even if you don't get the damage multiplier toward enemies in combat you're still highly unlikely to die or even take damage at all by simply remaining crouched and having minimal (and I mean minimal) awareness and positioning.
---
But if you're solo you get both benefits, you get the extra damage and you get the invisibility through the entire fight against SBQ, and to top it all off a single 1 point card (escape artist) lets you soft reset aggro if you somehow manage to get spotted.
---
I have only ever played fallout 4 and never had these kind of problems.  Lol
---
Well damn

You absolutely should not be halfway done 2 weeks into a 10 week season; that would ruin the entire purpose of a season. And it only goes up 25 every level, meaning it takes 10 levels to require an extra daily. Which we now have double because people think you should be able to hit 100 in the first week.
---
Wow
---
A tip for camp objects that you give you trouble and you don't want to use the rug trick on them, place the item, then blueprint it, you can then most of the time place it against walls and under stairs in areas where it says it needs support without issue (assuming it's green) this doesn't apply to stacked objects, which the prefabs fall under for some reason. No matter what you do it won't place properly.
---
I always stand at a workshop to advertise I'm there "come fight me bitches" no one ever turns up.
---
Equip the percepti-bobble perk (I think that’s what it’s called) and wander around the agricultural research centre. There’s about 4 spawns in there I believe
---
Ill take 2 please! :) can’t wait to see!
---
That’s impressive. Was the XP event for three days? Divide 150 level by three days and 24 hours (non stop play), you gained more than 2 levels per hour, that’s quite efficient. What build and weapons do you use?
---
I find them pretty reliably at the thorn inside the tent
---
I feel that lol, I literally have a poster of Todd Howard in my room that says "It Just Works"
---
also, r/gayfortodd
---
At this point I think even if an enemy is elbow deep up in your asshole waving you around like a sock puppet but you click fast travel from the map then you should fucking LOAD into a fast travel screen. This nonsense we've tolerated for this long is ridiculous. I click right on my direction pad and use a stimpak. EVERY.SINGLE.TIME but cant make it work with fast traveling.
---
Sometimes there’s one at whitesprings the building with all the ghouls and wednigo
---
T'sar bomba size then we could just nuke all of Appa.
---
Look at [Mappalachia](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Mappalachia).
---
For a second there i got scared bc i thought i were being an asshole/annoying for doing this constantly.. thank you and you're welcome
---
Had me in the first half, ngl.
---
yey for the Communist stuff.
---
The light olive green colors are way too good to pass on.
---
I literally freaked out and tried to hide. Couldn’t, was running down the ski slope by Top Of The World. Needless to say, AP bar wasn’t too helpful 😂
---
No. It isn't. 
---
But all this outrage and shock is hilarious. 
---
Everyone up in arms since launch over bugs. All the I'm never buying another Bethesda game again claims.....
---
For a game that anyone who has played 10 minutes of any other previous Bethesda game and has the smallest amount of reasonable foresight and managed expectations.... Knew was going to buggy af.....
---
For those of us who played a ton of Bethesda games? I knew. You should have too. Not one fallout game has had minimal bugs.
---
Praise geraldo
---
Sometimes ... sometimes I forget my pool cue does over 500 dmg ... I’m sorry.. I meant to bash it .. I swear

On the roof of the quonset hut at Blackwater mine, behind one of the cash registers in the whitesprings golf club downstairs, in the upstairs room of the two story building behind the whitesprings fire station with the toys, in the window on the third floor of the lighthouse.  One of those should yield a bobblehead.
---
Try wiki they usually have a listing as to their exact location.
---
Same, I got an osmosis kit in my misc and I’m not getting rid of it
---
Lol watched that a few hours ago :)
---
I personally found a lot of Cobalt around Morgantown, the other fluxes are found around Whitespring. After dropping a nuke on each location of course.
---
Remember to equip green thumb under perception to double the raw flux you collect, the problem is finding enough hardened and glowing mass and high radiation fluids to convert everything you find.
---
Arrows. Great, to use for ammo points.
---
It's a feature 😉
---
I’d love to have that
---
I'm kind of surprised there isn't more BoS-related stuff given the whole ATLAS Observatory thing coming up.
---
Not much exciting here, really.
---
Whole ass solutions.
---
More then likely not. Legendary Run items are classified as Atomic Shop items and you can't build those for other people unless they're bugged
---
Oh I understand, didn't think about that. I'll beware then if I find one to pass it over, I like my account too much 😍
---
This is the stupidest post I've ever seen on this sub.
---
After I kill the first batch I usually throw down two mines and once they drop it blows a bunch of them up.
---
It’s not showing any buildings or terrain so it looks like a barren landscape. I’ve had this bug before.
---
It is not, since the rewards are classified as atom-shop items. A shame really, but understandable.
---
It was an experiment, they wanted US to be the dialogue and stories, that’s why they had the piss poor PVP experiences at the beginning and gave us all the tools 
---
Not every game in a series has to follow the same formula, I noticed you left out Fallout Brotherhood of Steel.  Play that game and come back and tell me how bad FO76 was at the start.
---
Oh that's going to be great especially after a nice paint job. Good lord you can make yourself a bundle.
---
*All* of it is currently garbage except for the original suit. The only thing it’s good for is the mod armor challenge since it only needs 1 oil.
---
The only time I've been killed by another player was when I took the munitions factory. Whenever I take a junkyard or campground nobody seems to care.
---
Once the new update drops you can work at soloing the Colossus all by yourself. I just watched a video by "angry turtle" .
---
I understand your point, but when you find that dress you know the work you put into it. That moment will be for you and no one else. Don’t let anyone diminish your game experience. You’re not playing for them. I hope you find it.
---
Another thing that I haven't seen here is that you should try to have the luck perk super duper active when you're crafting it all into stable flux, it'll give you a chance to make 2 for the price of one
---
You had me at “raider gazebo”!
---
A game mechanic that has 'google it' as the best tactic is not a great game mechanic.  Just because it's not as hard as some people think, doesn't mean it's worth defending.
---
That perk and the magazine one are really effective. I'm down to only 3 magazines left for a complete collection now thanks to it.
---
Well that's dumb. 
---
To finish most of the dailies it takes minutes. I hit a whopping 13 minutes including fast travel time the other day to finish all but the level up. 
---
Weeklies are even easier. Don't even need to grind those. They just happen.
---
You could have just played the game. Spent 10 minutes to do some dailies, then did whatever, and if by some chance you don't hit the coop? Cost would have been smaller.
---
I've seen that twice before that player usually has their platforms about a hundred yards from the bunker. Works out very well.

Seems like a server side thing to me, Guess im not the only one with PA woes today. I had this issue for a bit but I just kept traveling between Team members CAMPS untill it worked out. Glad I put Fo76 on my SSD I'm in for the long haul.

I think they’re going to add
---
Such items to nw in the future, they just have to balance all the stuff out
---
Username checks out.

Sorry buddy just teasing :). Yes scrap EVERYthing early on. Ask a nice hogh level to craft you some pocketed armor and show you the ropes. What system ya on?
---
I just want to know if the fireplace hidden door is boss or not🤷🏼‍♂️
---
I wasn't insinuating that you thought they were the same weapon. I'm saying the pulse capacitor for the plasma flamer isn't related to the plan for the pulse capacitor on the plasma caster.
---
You think that canvas loot bag will actually be nylon?
---
No. We can't have nice things because Bethesda never made nice things. 
---
Every. Single. Fallout has been a buggy nightmare. For you to expect otherwise is unrealistic.
---
I knew exactly what I was expecting when I got 76.
---
I just wish other people could hear it. My main's CAMP is right outside Harper's and it would make it feel so neighborhoodly to be able to hear when other folks toot that horn.
---
Bethesda, pls
---
So far sheepsquatch plushy reins supreme
---
If you don't kill it, the robots will aggro on it instead of you, allowing you to more easily finish the quest.
---
ok. been doing everything but NW, sitting on 55. my wife plays the same, level 52.. halfway in levels isn't halfway in points, and btw we're in the third week. my mistake on the +50 per level, it is 25.
---
not even gonna argue, just that's what's going on over here.
---
PS I had nothing to do with it but you might consider this chart  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Nji1wR3q5hoHOKwKQWnK5p1qhtub7O64XPGZxeimpI/htmlview](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Nji1wR3q5hoHOKwKQWnK5p1qhtub7O64XPGZxeimpI/htmlview)

I don’t know the positive posts just get annoying after awhile because there’s too much negativity associated with the game and it’s like...I’m not having a good time, my buddies and their buddies aren’t having a good time, so how the hell are you having a good time? Turns out 9/10 times they’re not really invested in the game and are too casual to see the **GLARING** issues with Bethesda and the game. By the time they reach the endgame, they typically join the negativity camp of posters or just leave the game all together.
---
The cycle then repeats with another freshie noob.
---
Don't. I did it and without fail the dickheads would always find a way to include my camp in the nuke zone.  I finally just moved it.

Hey, it just works.
---
Stuff like this is the point of the post mate. We need to make it a point that if something is gonna be monetized, it should at the very least function properly.
---
About tree fiddy.
---
It would be nice to rebalance anything at this point. If only they were more forgiving about switching points around. Or being able to reset all skills we had at one point would be awesome. Sneaking is pretty op specially with the Chinese stealth suit now. Plus fixers and all those sneak works and weapons. But I feel like that applies mostly to guns. Because although possible I don’t see many people running a melee sneak build. Or none that I can see videos or read about. For me, sneaking and stealth isn’t really a concern for me. So I can’t really give my opinions or preference on it. I enjoy the sneak bonus, but in my build I like to fight things head on, not so much hide and avoid damage. I don’t mind getting killed a few times. 
---
Fallout 76 in general has been a clusterfuck the entire ride. I myself preordered and played the beta. I’ve honestly played this game since day one. Every single day. Except for whenever I left town for a few days. Was here for all the glitches. Bugs. Toxic players. Hacks. Cheats You name it. This game isn’t for everybody. I’ve had people leave the game simply because they realized you waste stamina for jumping. And people that gave up in general because the game got boring or repetitive. 
---
I like it. Flaws and all. Because it can be a fun game with friends. Or if you play solo (even with public teams) although repetitive, I find it soothing. 
---
I originally became unyielding simply because of the extra carry weight. And the obvious bonus. I didn’t even know or cared about bloodied until I was around level 200 when I got my first bloodied sledgehammer. 
---
People ask me if it gets boring killing things easily. And to me, not really. I find it normal to be. High level and killing enemies easier. Like when you restart a game with all the skills and weapons unlocked. If bloodied was taken out for good. I’d probably just remain the same. The exception being now I need a furious gauntlet instead of a bloodied. 
---
The changes you want DONT bother me actually. My strategy and stuff wouldn’t really change too much. Sure having enemies be stronger would be better. But if they are going to do that, I hope they upgrade the AI system as well. I want to right supermutants and be scared of a strong powerful enemy. Not just have it walk towards me. Stand there. Wait a few seconds and then try to hit me. 
---
Or the enemies that shoot maybe 3-4 bullets and then hide to reload.
---
King Crimson! &lt;---- yes this is a jojo reference.
---
Considering not everyone uses Bloodied or Junkie's builds.
---
No, no we don't.
---
The enemies should be balanced as though you don't have Legendary gear. Just gear that is found/crafted, like the average player has.
---
If you have game-breaking, difficulty-nullifying gear, that's on you. Others shouldn't be made to suffer for your obsessiveness.
---
You would think, but people still run right past broken equipment during Uranium Fever.
---
Because half the game is filled with Military fetishees.
---
Agreed, happens all the time.  Really doesn't bother me too much as it only drops level 40 gear iirc. Sucks for the lower levels though.
---
I try and drop them wherever I get them. Usually either from handing in daily quests so crater or the settlers place. Or else down by the bunker by the Scorch Beast event. I've seen others drop them with their spoiled meat, veg and fruit.
---
Yep.  I have the biocommesh torso and run chem fiend.  Berry mentats should last about 15 minutes, but the visual effect runs out at 10.  The effect is still listed for the full 15, but no visual highlight for the final 5.
---
The score issue is definitely something that should get fixed before next season, even if there is a mini 1.5 season with the same theme but lame prizes, just to test it out; Somethings dont get caught until they are rolled out En masse and I can understand buggy animations or Not being able to use Ammo converter in PA (at least for me I go into the ground)  but the ghillie suit being a static mess kinda proves they just did somethings up and then slap it in with little to no testing.
---
My intention for these is to make them as twitch give aways later on, need to make a bunch before I do anything like that though since they take some time to model, print and paint, also lets my channel grow a bit, still only little
---
Seriously guys c’mon this post is obviously a joke. Smoke some weed and lighten up. Who on earth would every set up a go fund me page for a multi million dollar company. Use your brains before the keyboard bashing begins.
---
You are welcome fellow dweller
---
I gave him a dolla'.
---
You seriously asking that?...
---
I sell them for 20, takes a few days before someone buys em. Seems like they are not so popular any longer.
---
It’s pretty fun especially if you have friends, after all the questing it turns into a bit of a grind and wait but still fun. New content coming in the next few weeks with brotherhood of steel coming back
---
seconded,  id love to have paint to "lock" the solar set im working on from me having a stupid moment the scrip machine.
---
I intend to give these models away on twitch streams later on when my channel grows a bit, also gives me some time to model, print and paint more of them
---
The Black Mountain Ordinance Works and the road from it south to Point Pleasant usually yields quite a few starlight berries too.  There are firecracker berries Above the NAR trainyard, Down south near the bear on the map, and up by the sign on the cliff east of whitesprings and that whole general area.  Loads of brain fungus south of sunrise field in the bog.
---
Interesting, I thought this was all stripped out. Two quick things:  
---
1. Are you in Pacifist mode? If you are, your camp should be protected. 
---
2. Did you get protested at a Workshop that carried over to your CAMP? I thought that was nerfed as well, but maybe it's still around.
---
That's about it really, as far as I knew you couldn't destroy someone's CAMP if they are in Pacifist mode, outside of nuking it. Happy being corrected.
---
Just keep a single .308 round in your inventory and you can quickswitch to your rifle regardless of receiver.
---
Scroll down the sub, we provided a ton of locations in another thread.
---
Haha only to have the first other person come up and one shot it. But atleast people know I'm not the one that screwed everyone. 😉
---
Its even worse if they sleep in your bed, interacting with them didn't make them leave like it would a workbench. I had to wait a few minutes to get my well rested ;-;
---
Welp, they got me on that Prefabed Bunker.
---
Cost isn’t the issue, my lack of enjoyment is
---
He’s trying to be funny but doesn’t realize how hard it would be to add their frankly dumb idea
---
You gave him a dolla?!
---
Yea the ghillie suits just were nit tested at all. You cant even use the damn things, because it covers up to the whole screen.
---
My dumb ass just follows and watches them kill the Legendary.
---
That was kinda my point of this post. How can a company blame the state of a game being so because of low staffing numbers.
---
Sssshhhh, delete your comment. We can't let Bethesda find out! :p
---
4 months later of turning in 6-12 technical data per week and I still only have two paints...

I got mine in Greg's mining supply, upstairs in is house by the terminal.

Firebase major can have one in one of the tents.
---
Huntsmaster Lodge is one i often see - on the table in the basement where the hunt master is.
---
I just started using my Two shot Plasma Gat  I'd pay upwards of 10 for them. I'm not sure if power user applies but if i could get big boi clips outta them they would be worth more.
---
how else are you gonna keep the doctors away?
---
Doesn't mean it was him, could've been an enemy. Generators and vending machines are usually the first things that get eaten.
---
I’m totally with you. Weak enemies take away the wasteland survival feel. It’s very unfortunate that this is the direction Beth is heading. Mirelurk kings got nerfed so weak now I can kill them with gun bashing. Many want the gutsys and assaultrons nerfed too. Very soon the wasteland will become a laid back theme park for selfies.
---
Omg. It works, I'm on ps4 😂
---
Yeah true, what would help with this event is compass icons from the start and not just a circle
---
Yo if that was me im sorry. I got a glitch in my game recently where sometimes my automatic weapons auto fire after me just pressing shoot once. Riding shotgun ?
---
Vanguards works well :)
---
Been worth it the entire time.
---
I was the same exact way, its been over a month since I got it and ive played it everyday since. Idk how this game was at launch but dont listen to what people say about this game anymore, this game is great
---
Yeah vang is really good
---
agreed
---
This drove me nuts for a while.  Finally found one in Cross Hair, sitting on a rusted cage.  I found a guide online and just stated going down the list.  Waste of caps.....
---
Most likely Vanguard.
---
That’s like saying please have a skin for my fixer. Solar armor is basically scout armor. Just like the fixer is a combat rifle.
---
If they never released a skin for fixer yet I doubt solar will have a skin.
---
Most of us should still be working on SCORE.
---
I got mine from the roof of the small "shed" on the Deathclaw island.
---
I have 100. So pass by my camp and clean me out pls 😂
---
I’m a big fan of vanguard! I’m be also added a couple pieces of chameleon because my stealth tends to break without it. I don’t feel like I’m hurting on defense, especially with full secret armor.
---
I think the ghillie skins look like someone taped a lot of cheap plastic confetti to regular armor. Make it bright colored and call it confetti armor. At least it's accurate
---
2 pieces of lvl 20 something Vanguard got me through to 50. Hard as I tried I couldnt replace em. Mix of Mutant Leather &amp; metal Gear worked out well... I could pay less attention to my HP but it was less effective I think
---
Nawww. Happened today at project paradise. 
---
And,er, It's usually me who accidentally murders the captain in riding shotgun. I have gun fu and i'll drop one of the people up there and it snaps to the captain and i automatically fire.
---
I would suggest a mixed set of 15%less damage from xx mobs since there is basically a cap on DR

There is only one way I can think of circumnavigating pacifist mode and I'm sure it's not precise enough to target things like that. Could be wrong as never tried it. Are you sure it wasn't just random enemies? They will target things like generatirs first and even a low level mole rat will wreck those in no time.
---
All my friends are on console and we all like different games lol is it still fun solo ?
---
Damn that’s shitty. Thanks for telling me though
---
That’s disappointing. Thanks though
---
Went there today with the perk active, light on and still searched, and there was nothing.
---
Thanks for the reply..
---
I didn’t realize that someone couldn’t damage a camp if you were in pacifist mode.  Yes I’m in pacifist and nope...I didn’t take over any workshops today.  I’m not sure what else it could have been, there are hardly any damaging creatures near my location.  And like I said, someone was there right before I traveled over and promptly left once I got there.
---
Drawing a weapon makes mine work.
---
I also have it on my ssd but glad it wasn’t just me
---
I didn't say anything about the plasma flamer.
---
mine is trapped in a simulation, who will one day emerge, so Todd can feed.
---
Wait so you can just bash to tag it? Or do you have to deal at least a specified amount of damage to get the loot?
---
Nah
---
*losing
---
Since I’ve been on, I’ve only had minor enemies attack my camp maybe twice.... and my ally took care of them.  And like I mentioned someone was there and promptly booked it out of there... strange
---
Agreed, though I guess someone could have kited over some mobs, it's likely a coincidence someone left just as the damage was discovered
---
Lol im trying to spend mine atm, Considering I dont get 999 per clip they last quite well.. Too bad you cant put a receiver or something on the plasma caster for bigger clips from cores.
---
I'm upset we get curtains before we get actual glass in our empty window frames.
---
At the current rate, Bethesda is going to make people pay for glass in our window frames too.
---
He posted a note on YouTube that he has access to his account
---
Why not a swing? Becketts seems like he took a walk on the wild side, if you catch my drift. The astronaut is a bit more vanilla in my opinion maybe a little nerdy RP but that's it.
---
Ok good to know.  Maybe I’m just being paranoid, just thought the timing was interesting
---
Or when they sleep w/ your wife
---
Do we want to see them as ignorant or greedy.
---
Ugh this grind if starting to get to
---
&gt;Oh baaaaaash. Why didn't I think of that. People always yell at me for killing the Legendary.
---
I carry a mutants reduced weight pipe pistol for tagging things. It weighs something like 0.3lbs, and is a good way of burning all the 38 ammo you find lying around.
---
Did mine in Alpine Cabins. SE Building on top of  a bunk bed. Find a location and server hop if needed.
---
I put the chicken coop in the upstairs of my house because I was sick of mole rat destroying things.
---
Gauss pump has been deleted thanks  for your time
---
Well in that case at least I'm not the only one who has to suffer through that.
---
Did this the other night at AWOL Armaments, had two 40 somethings spamming hearts at me for each one.  Never felt so happy to be a Responder
---
Ummmm loot is individual.
---
The charming and endearing bugs are too few and far between the bodies falling under the world, fast ravel canceling, and vats just magically not working
---
That’s not how looting works, you both get legendaries and separate loot pools for kills
---
Wow I adore lots of this. Raider walls really should be in the base game.
---
Not having english as a first language is rough I suppose.
---
Honestly, I think it's Unyielding regardless.
---
Because, especially with the Legendary Run making Intelligence a lot more valuable, it's really hard to argue with an armor set that can give you +5 to it, just for being at 60% HP.  Not to mention it's +5 to everything, including Carry Weight, AP, etc.  Unless you're diligent about clearing your Rads, a lot of players are used to running at 60% HP anyway.
---
Well I didn’t get a legendary
---
Saw a guy IRL at Costco wearing a ghilli hooded cloak and army gas mask with respirator. Was so tempted to ask what the stats were....
---
*me just being a noob and wanting help
---
When I get home I'm going to check that gun of mine out and come back with a definitive list of mods it has to make it all glitchy and slick. Seems like it isn't very well known.
---
There was some person doing this yesterday at uranium... Like dude give everyone a chance to tag it. It's not like it's gonna disappear in 5 seconds.
---
I was on the fence about this game when I heard it was multiplayer because I am not a multiplayer person at all.  I waited a long time to purchase it but glad I did.  I love the game! There is so much to do.
---
Damn, I didn’t know that! I stay in pacifist mode, so I guess it was never a problem for me because they wouldn’t be able to do it. Learn something new every day!
---
It suprises me that you got to level 80 and you don't know that loot is individualized.
---
Made up story. Please don't fill the reddit with false stories.
---
&gt; going from rank 52 to 53 requires 2300 points, which is 50 more than the  previous rank, 25 higher than the standard 25 point increase. 
---
That's remarkably arbitrary...
---
If they nerf Bloodied I'll probably put the game down for a good while if not permanently.
---
I enjoyed the TSEs before they nerfed them.  I enjoyed the Zero-AP weapons until they nerfed them.  They've partially screwed up Stealth builds and VATS builds with bugs.  Now that I've switched over to Bloodied, if they nerf that too I think I'm done.  
---
Unless they include a free and easy way to swap out all of my Bloodied weapons for other equally good weapons with a different prefix, and a free COMPLETE respec of my character, then I'm done.  They can't keep screwing up stuff on the one hand and intentionally nerfing stuff on the other hand.  When you make the grind feel like work and then you negate people's work at your own whim, it's not a fun thing for players.
---
Thank you. That’s where I got mine. Had to server hop twice
---
That is not how it works, you both got loot.
---
oh yes!  The first time I saw someone do this, they led me to a legendary ghoul, that they had crippled the legs on. It was very strange looking, but I finished off that ghoul, and we both got to loot the body!
---
Thanks random player at "powering up Poseidon"!
---
If I remember correctly, players will often spawn north of your C.A.M.P machine. You can use this to determine where players may spawn when fast travelling your camp. The spawn location isn't perfect; it can deviate by quite a fair amount at times, though the general rule still applies.
---
Molerats can die in a fire seriously
---
I live in the mire with the radtoads and a friendly neighbor the mega sloth. No one ever nukes where I live or has a camp there.
---
You’re a level 80 and think that everyone shares loot when killing an enemy... best joke of the day
---
Np glad you got one
---
Isn't that just the ugliest ever? "Look! I'm a road cone!"
---
I'm enjoying all the rewards and the season pass all around. Great idea. Great content. Stop being such whiney babies or go play another game ffs. 🤦‍♂️
---
Maybe try shooting things more and making up stories less and you might get one🤷‍♂️
---
	I thought he'd go away if I gave him a dollar.
---
It’s alright solo, with public teams now it’s easy to join random people though and most of the players are pretty nice.
---
It started yesterday actually and it was working fine for me yesterday. Haven’t been on today yet.
---
Only the queen really needs a set amount of damage, because theres typically not enough players around a random legendary for the cut off to matter.  A bash will put you in the top 10% of damagers (or whatever the number is)
---
Finally more for my raider build!
---
This is the only time I’m okay with buying something from them
---
Or the time I got the elder scrolls 25th free thing, but eh
---
&gt;It’s not a glitch or a bug. They spawn like that because if someone is standing in the spawn zone they don’t instantly die from scorch attack when they spawn.
---
I mean, there are at least 3 or 4 different places they can spawn from.  The fact that they choose to spawn in the dead center, in front of the thing they are meant to attack... which actually makes it harder to defend... really doesn't seem all that intentional.
---
If you didn't get loot, it's because you didn't do enough damage. Yet u said you got her down to her last bit of health????? Anyone else smell that?
---
There's like 6 in Watoga alone if you know where to look (Roof of the high school, Comic Book shop by BoS Vendor, 2nd floor of the Medical center in the locked room, behind the desk at the train station, inside the locked room of the train station and at the rooftop bar of the apartments) and that's on top of the high school, mining company, mayor's office and civic center interiors (which I find a little too chore-y when there's so many bobbleheads just sitting around putside. Personally I prefer this sort of hide-and-seek challenge to something as mind-numbingly easy as chewing bubblegum, buying 3 items or leveling perk cards.
---
PLus I mean there's a perk for finding bobbleheads... with all this levelling up everyone's doing, find and equip it. It's not hard.
---
I hit 51 last night.  Haven't done a single NW challenge yet.
---
It shows up on the little team menu, yeah?  We should have a little money bag emote...come get the gold.
---
God Howard logic: “The game is stable if the game isn’t running”
---
Happened to me twice. The excitement of big city life.
---
At least you got one other person.  You're doing the right thing, and that makes you a good person.
---
It must smell *terrible* when it's over.
---
The double score is already figured into the numbers given for the challenges.  The dailies show 500 instead of 250.
---
Oh, and you can't give them to someone who might actually like having 30 fireworks on hand at once.
---
Felt a lot free and fluid in 76 than previous fallout titles where it felt over the shoulder even when zoomed right out. I think Marsupial and Speed Demon serums help that feel.
---
Oh lord...that’s it sorry I’m dumb today, didn’t get much sleep heh.
---
I have been sharing that perk all day today.
---
Maybe you didn’t do enough damage and the other player did?
---
Of course he's not gonna go away! You gave him a dolla!
---
Be sure you have ammosmith card and super duper (dont craft anything without these). Then, I used to have Lead extractor in my camp. Other ways to get ammo is buying ammo machine from Raiders and/or get the ammunition factory workshop.
---
I list most items at about 1/2 whatever value is shown in the pipboy.
---
IIRC, however, the paints have a really low value.  
---
(To avoid spoilers) because its such a PITA to get access to their point of origin, IIRC, I list them at around 250.  Same for X01 nuka paint.
---
You can zoom right out and it's a bit less shoulderly.
---
Bloody guys killed legendary instantly, i kill some legend one shot, and cant do something, dont have low damage weapon.
---
They pop up through 2nd floor floors too. But I'd take them over those useless floaters. How do those even have anything to do with a post nuclear society?
---
I want a deathclaw plushie
---
Well when you exhaust all their spawn points their spawn point is at the location where they need to head to.
---
They start at point A and need to head to point B. If A is blocked then they spawn at the other spawn locations until only point B is left as that is their final destination.
---
That’s how I see the code is working.
---
If you don’t use the camp method and stand in the two middle spawn points alternating between the 2 all the scorch will spawn in a cluster at one gate at 1 random side.
---
Short answer: no 
---
It just goes through ammo so fast, and using it for the everyday grind you're gonna be expending 100+ rounds for every round you find
---
As someone who has trouble with the endgame, since I mainly invested into utility perks rather than combat ones, weapons like the Minigun and Flamer proved to be game changers for dealing with some of the tougher content.
---
The Flamer, and by extent the Plasma Gun with flamethrower nozzle, were particularly useful against enemies like ghouls who rush you, while rapid fire weapons like the Minigun work best against enemies like the scorched &amp; Super Mutant, as well as some slow enemies.
---
If you need some additional firepower, I would suggest looking for Sam Blackwell’s bunker, which will lead you to a series of quests that will give you access to better firepower.
---
Same with the pipe pistols. All you really need to do is have something to reach out and touch legendaries with.
---
Trippy
---
Yeah but for some reason people just can't seem to understand that... It's only 1500 gold super easy to get if they... Play the game instead of complain.
---
No clue - but my wife now only will claim workshops on private servers because of this. I still claim workshops on public servers, and haven't (luckily) run into this yet. Now that I'm 130+, I try to be conscious of this fear when I go for defend events. I pop in, and do a wave so they hopefully know I'm not there to be a jerk.
---
Pre d00ping the death claw mask was 40k-50k. I know the leather coat is collectable but I am not sure on the price. 
---
Now though its hard to say, ultimately they are worth what ever someone will pay for them.
---
Floaters don't attack my camp all the time so I still say they are worse
---
Do it. But the hopes of having a pet is zero to none. Jumping servers, I usually run into an already nuked server. My base is fine, but my pet is usually dead. 
---
Having a base nearby also helps other players that need to repair/scrap/chill 
---
Usually people are nice and don’t include my base. But be prepared to jump/blueprint out if someone does include your base
---
I’m far but in between the Wendigo Collosus &amp; SBQ
---
Just got to tag it once to get loot. But legendaries aren't a guaranteed drop.
---
My point exactly.
---
I just did a Uranium Fever where everyone was being nice and doing the legendaries together. We all got a lot of loot, it was great.
---
If he got to loot it at all he did enough dmg, either the whole story is fake or it was a non legendary one
---
I thought op was talking about the Queen.
---
I love when all but one is dead and you don’t realize because it is off someplace hidden chewing on the most expensive thing it can find.
---
Good point
---
And if you are the guy one shotting them with your dupped explosive gatling plasma (in triple H's voice) I got two words for ya.
---
Joined a “team” and one guy in it sent me a message for wendigo colossus
---
Looking at mire real estate now
---
You don't need to be Bloodied or Junkie to deal a lot of damage to a Deathclaw.  They simply don't have that much HP relative to other "miniboss"-type monsters, and because they have to waste so much time traveling to you to deal melee damage, they are at a big disadvantage against anyone with a gun.
---
The Sheepsquatch has a ton of HP, but its attacks are rather mediocre, which makes it into a bullet sponge more than anything else.  You just stand there, tanking it.  That's something you can't really do with a Deathclaw - if it does manage to attack you, it *hurts*.
---
The sweet spot, I would say, is a Deathclaw that preserved its lethality, but had 3/4 the HP of a Sheep.  Enough to close in on the player, take a swat, and keep going.  And have more than one at a time.  *Then,* you'd fear them.
---
I have around 600, tried at 50, tried 40, tried 30, even tried 20. They just don't sell
---
Maybe Gatling Plasma is better then? Though previously I heard that energy weapons had durability problems, is that fixed?
---
You say that till you get one then can never find it
---
Line in the Sand/Fish in the Barrel is amazing for xp. If you don't have the right weapon to tag a ton of enemies, a handfull of Molotovs accurately timed when the groups of enemies drop can get you three of the SCORE weekly xp challenges easily, as long as someone has a FO1st tent set up correctly.
---
Wait, it’s at 60% that the buffs kick in??
---
I was thinking something similar to the guy in hell who has to push a boulder up hill only to have it roll back down for them to start again so they will always make it to the finish but as soon as they get there they have to start again
---
Thrower benefits from Rifleman for some odd reason but you could put on a pulse capacitor on the plasma thrower as shown [here](https://youtu.be/_bDQBntUlkg)
---
I bought the mask for 13k caps and the leather coat from rare to rare trade
---
Yeah but you were only afraid of deathclaws to a certain level in previous games and then they too became pretty basic kills.  Cripple the leg and problem solved, no more death machine.  I would love to see a deathclaw boss though.
---
I only have ammosmith right now. I usually kill most enemies 1 - 3 shots. So I thought that was enough to not burn through your ammo reserves.
---
I’ve never thought about this before, I really like this idea
---
I still run 3 unyielding/2 bolstering even though I'm a junkie, having the extra stat boosts are great for public events,  even running the queen is easy at 25% health.
---
Nothing that complicated For me.
---
When I first started playing PS\* games, The characters in the first game I bought were prebuilt - and you could not edit them beyond (eventually) getting new outfits and perhaps some makeup.  
---
The prebuilt I liked was a scrawny red-headed female named Madelyn.  
---
Since then, if I have the option, the chars I build are always red headed females named Madelyn.
---
It was 4 days. I played for like 5-6 hours per day during this event. I don't remember exactly but I think I was able to get 7 or 8 levels per hour during this event with additional 100% XP buff from lunchboxes.
---
Build - Bloodied PA Heavy Gunner:
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f546f38&amp;d=sb2s22sq2s01st1s30sr0pe2p21ee2c72cu1id2ir2s12ip2ic2s72lu2l71lt2](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f546f38&amp;d=sb2s22sq2s01st1s30sr0pe2p21ee2c72cu1id2ir2s12ip2ic2s72lu2l71lt2)
---
It's probably not well optimized and I also prefer some QoL perks over damage perks.
---
Weapon: Just a 1-star Bloodied Gutling Gun.
---
Armor: X-01. Calibrated shocks (both legs), Emergency protocols (Torso), Targeting HUD (Helmet).
---
I've done West Tek and Whitespring gold club runs...
---
Whitesprings, make sure you get in the safe n clean disposal for cobalt
---
After also running her hundreds of times, and based on more accounts saying “it does matter” than “it doesn’t matter”, i’m gonna keep thinking it’s true until there evidence to the contrary. I’ll keep shooing goofballs off the fences, tyvm lol
---
I don't have any issues. Between uranium fever, west Tek, lucky hole mine and the various weight rooms. I keep her fed well
---
The floaters despawn right?
---
I've never used the energy heavies without the explosive effect, which makes them deteriorate fast, so I dont know. But I know they dont have the greatest durability. But are powerful, and decently ammo efficient
---
This! Yes! Thank you very much! I’ve seen it on the Uranium Fever event and this helped me complete the daily challenge!
---
That’s great news, thank you!
---
Well Rested and Cranberry Relish help.  Use Inspirational 3 in charisma.   Pop a berry mintats as radiation rumble starts (for example) to boost intelligence.   Unyeilding armor and low health to boost intelligence.  The higher your intelligence the faster you level up.  WesTek, server hop, WesTek....not what I do, but it might fit your needs.
---
The higher your intelligence the more xp you get so anything that increases that or straight xp buffs will help. Unyielding armor can give a huge stat boost. On top of that you can mix herbivore mutation with strange in numbers perk and eat cranberry relish and brain bombs or carnivore.with broiled scorchbeast brains and tasty squirrel stew. Also the inspirational perk adds up to 15% xp in a group. Lastly, if you're lucky, leader bobbleheads and one of the live and love mags ( I forget which number ).
---
That looks delicious!
---
I believe serendipity and ricochet work in tandem however i believe the effect is multiplicative so it doesn't stack but having both fecking RULES
---
This for sure.
---
I just make a new character for that challenge
---
No you arent. Your asking people for a solution to your problem. Ive provided a couple. Good luck.
---
But it’s not real man. There’s no evidence that supports this. Hundreds of player accounts that say it must be true based on observations is meaningless dude
---
/s 
---
that sucks tho man, i’ve had her get down to the last minute before but haven’t failed yet. I’d be big mad
---
Just tested it. That’s dope, glad you said that. I’ve got a really rare unyielding scout armor chest piece and was definitely going to trade it later
---
Ps4 :)))) i know i wasnt asked but good things come to those who help themselves!
---
Don't know why your getting downvoted. I'm just a bit irked that, as a heavy build, I need to get to the way later levels to get the gat gun skin. But in the end, I think to myself, am I really going to use the captain cosmos skin over the hellfire or shadow prime skins. No
---
Keeping up with ammo is no problem with the .50 cal.   You make 180 at a time plus super duper.  It’s one of the cheapest ammos in game (next to 5mm).  And with Bloodied it’s very efficient.  Don’t t worry about keeping it fed.  It’s my primary weapon.
---
yo guys this man/woman/whatever is FUCKING amazing!
---
You made a new character for the legendary run?
---
It’s the only place I’ve seen it, but then again it’s the one event where you are guaranteed to get at least 3 legendaries on each run.
---
No. For the level up challenge
---
That’s very amazing achievement bruh, my build is quite similar with fewer CHR and more in AGI. I should have played harder had I realized how useful the double XP is, especially when stacked with lunchboxes. I spent most of the time vending hopping like I normally do lol
---
I assumed you were talking in hypotheticals since that's typically the context I see people talking about how fast we should finish the season pass. Sorry about that.
---
I just checked and I'm at 42.
---
When you create a new character, your legendary progress carries over?
---
Do you regularly go around getting justice boners over video games? Sheesh. Even Kant had more moral flexibility than you.
---
Unequipped and punch it
---
It sounds like all of their problems are with sneak stacking and not with bloody builds themselves.
---
We’re all familiar with bethesda’s shitty game decisions, but calling on them to do anything is a fruitless endeavor. Putting out a friendly reminder to players that the power to make the game less shitty for everyone else is in their hands (due to bethesda’s shit design) is something achievable. 
---
Get off the fences lol
---
Not much of a backstory but all my characters are horribly disfigured. Not when they come out of Vault 76 but moreso after I get my mutations due to radiation since you can edit your charcters looks on the fly.
---
Thank you man, that’s great to hear! I just really love using it.
---
Do you need to “claim” them in the atomic shop?
---
For the backpack, do you already have a backpack you can apply the skin to?
---
I'm putting "JUST. FUCKING. RESPAWN. ME." on my gravestone.
---
Not a bug... an exploit. Thank an uknown player at the event.
---
You finished it already? You must have played non stop.
---
Gatling plasma for me has been really great for ammo usage especially the prime variant which I use for SBQ. I can make 100+ ulticite cores if I really wanted to and that’s a lot of rounds
---
Durability wise? It’s ok. I don’t use gun Smith which makes you loss dura slower as well and it’s enough to take a SBQ down. I use a repair kit as soon as SBQ dies so I have enough for the next SBQ fight.
---
Note that I use bloodied so my dps is insane with it. I do 120 dmg or so per shot on SBQ head with my drug buff and perks.
---
Eh, have you tried to delete and download again? I have tried being unable to respawn anywhere else but the starter vault, but i have never not been able to respawn at all. Don't even think i've heard of others having this problem(could be wrong), so that's seriously some next level shit.
---
Sound to me like it might be a problem with your client.
---
I agree just respawn me
---
I stumbled upon a perception bobblehead while doing the kill a legendary challenge at the whitesprings golfhouse. Inside in the display glass by the back door.
---
Harpers Ferry for steel. If it’s scorched or super mutants, you’re set. They also tend to respawn halfway between the run so you get a shit ton of weapons from them. Use scrapper and you can walk out of there with over 1k steel every time
---
Dude same, but I make it up for with my mobility, I have speed demon, marsupial, and bird bones.
---
I hate it when someone uses that emote but then some jackass decides to oneshot the thing. Like they are the only people who matter.
---
Weren't they planning on fixing this issue?
---
there is nothing to claim in the atomic shop, ive checked several times, i have also checked the available skins for my backpack and it isnt there either...
---
Well shooting her in the air is fine unless people are running the stagger perks. In fact it‘s necessary bc that’s how she aggros onto someone and rolls the AI dice to see if she lands lol
---
How many Plushies have they made?
---
I know there's the Alien, Gator, Bunny, Little Sheepsquatch, and the new Big Sheepsquatch.
---
Plus, there's the upcoming Wendigo Colossus one.
---
Have you tried restarting the game?
---
A streamer? Always enjoy finding new content within the community! I’ll have to search once I have more
---
Time and give ya a follow
---
I put it on the stone fire camp. 👌🏻
---
Thank you very very much! It took a couple of days going back and forth, but they eventually offer the unlink and it indeed works! I am however afraid of even firing up Doom64 now. I’d at least like to play Doom Eternal again, but don’t want to break my FO76 account...
---
That’s interesting.
---
Try not dieing so much!
---
This thread is talking nuclear winter
---
Yes. Progress counts for all characters but make sure u only claim the rewards on your main character
---
I once found a three star ghoul at level 10 and I had a million rounds for a pipe pistol it used all the ammunition but I killed it and got a 3 star revolver
---
I don't know why some people are saying it's impossible... It's quite easy to stay stocked up on 50 Cal... Especially with a Bloodied variant as you'll be killing with far less bullets . As everyone else says just to a lead run at Lucky hole and go farm some out some guns to scrap for your steel... With the ammo card and super duper equipped you can produce almost 10k in one session, and that will last quite awhile.
---
I'd still sleep in my own bed. Preferably even in my own room. Sleeping in the same bed with another human being is the worst thing ever. Especially if she's having nightmares about floating in space forever.
---
Good advice, thanks!
---
yeah twice now
---
It was my favorite place way back when. Recently moved to the savage divide. I have a couple settler neighbors just 20 ft down river.
---
Yeah and like Line in the Sand at the BoS fort, kinda too crazy to tag legendaries like that. Haven't done many others
---
^^^^^Must be a bethseda employee^^^^
---
oh that mg bunker looks cool
---
I feel your pain, seems like there will be 6 people who only want to kill ghouls, but they somehow still let all the npcs die while I get ore
---
And you're not horribly over encumbered how exactly? 🤔
---
I do the same thing for the rank up overseers challenge
---
Most people just farm the ghouls for XP to get more SCORE.
---
I want to say in the last 10 I have done we have only fully done 2.
---
I did mention it.  Note “Xbox and PS2”.  That was also by Interplay in mid 2000s which everything they released around then was shit.  Bethesda is not Interplay.
---
I posted about this yesterday under the bug flair, got very little response though
---
I like trading missiles in I seem to get a ton of them from mole miners every time I do breach and clear
---
Aint gonna lie, i tamed a deathclaw and it wrecks those little bitches before they can attack anything. Unlike the shitass turrets, it also runs after distant scortched and supermutants and murders them.
---
To specify, You must have Two named BRC Personnel at the location at the time to start Riding shotgun, for example Eugene and Kieran.
---
Technically I’m not *on* the face of Appalachia I’m hovering a few foundations *above* Appalachia

Mothman plushie both in game and in the merch store. 
---
I have spoken.
---
With an instigating lever from sneak you will be one shotting most things, I think it’s the best rifle for sneak sniper build.
---
I don’t know sorry. Try submitting a ticket? Or looking on the support page.

The repeatable xp plus atoms is my guess

Some events are really prone for this encrypted is a really bad one for not letting you respawn have to turn off my xbox.
---
If you just switch off the computer in the final quest you get a lot of sappy dialogue, she is a happy bean 🥰
---
I’ll have to move me camp and see if anything changes theb
---
it happens. quit the game entirely and log back in.
---
This is the pay2win
---
It's this. Only way people are farming ore is if you're all on the same page.  Most are just grinding xp for score.

Jesus Christ man... that's not really the point but what fucking ever. This subreddit is the worst sometimes.

This is the way.

the only time they got hostile with me was when I accidentally blew up a car while fighting a charred feral ghoul
---
Same. It ROF is far superior.  I love the hunting rifle though. Wish it had a bit more pop.
---
A man of culture I see.
---
It's not just my problem. It's everyone who plays this games problem. Money is not a problem for me, it's a problem for new players who actually need to buy things for themselves. You're trying to argue with "solutions" that which is more like putting a bandaid over something. I'm trying to reduce loading screens so everyone has more up time instead down time in a screen.
---
waiting for the person that will comment "im a melee build so that wont work for me, i use guns for it LOL"
---
^^^^another Bethseda employee^^^^
---
Same.
---
It appears to be the finest of canvas bags.
---
To my knowledge, it still is not possible. I think there have been several posts about people wanting to change pip-boy hud and light color too
---
I’m writing a novella....currently on Volume 2, but here is Volume 1.

---
I wish we had the companion app.
---
No worries. Also you're best xp earners for regular enemies are super mutants so Huntersville, West Tek, Isolated Relay and Abandoned Bog Town are good farming spots. If you do a full run from Huntersville to Relay without fast travel there's a couple of little detours where deathclaws and sheepsquatch can spawn too.
---
Edit: I mean Isolated Radio Array lol, not relay.
---
I believe you should be able to get +6 agility – in addition to +15 agility base stat – by obtaining armor pieces with +1 agility modifier. Maybe there’s a weapon with another +1 agility. I think the cap for each SPECIAL stat is something around +25.
---
Build a little display case underneath and put his damn saw or power supply in there.
---
Its one of the things that irked me the most with Fallout 4. Pretty sure you could do it base game with Fallout 3 and NV.
---
I don't know why I torture myself with these. Tons of cool stuff. Does this being the PTS mean it's actually all coming soon?
---
Data mines just get me excited and leave me disappointed every week when they won't release the most basic of items.
---
That's on me though.
---
And a "credit line".
---
I've had this bug for months at this point.
---
As a bloody build I’m just gonna say I cannot get ore but I feel your pain.
---
No no, the issue of reading text coming from NPC versus the random holotape and note in FO76 is the visual part of it.
---
There's a visual appeal about going into a town for the first time, eyeing the gruff looking guard with an equally gruff attitude, before walking pass that person towards the local pub and watching dialogue with interest as a bar brawl is about to start.
---
FO76 at launch made it so all those moments of scripted spontaneity was removed. You KNEW whatever had taken place was well over by the time you got there, and the reading and holotapes is all history that is out of your impact and reach.
---
Earlier Fallout games had tons to read, but that element of discovery, of choices, existed. I want to pick a side during the Enclave/MODUS massacre and be a part of it, not learn about it after. I want to try to resolve the dispute between the Sunday brothers and their less priviledged neighbours, not come across skeletons and holotapes. This was what was missing that was so properly brought back with Wastelanders. 
---
It's not just a matter of audio and text.
---
You shouldn’t have duped. Simple as that.
---
See...that's the reason...lol....they gonna be mad for awhile...good thing tho, the robots inside arent mad

---
You're around 15% into the grind...
---
How many rounds do you think a Gatling would fire between the enemy’s death and the switch-over?
---
I’m making a VATS heavy weapon build.
---
And are you going to share those results or just claim I'm wrong, as it has been working perfectly fine for me since I picked up the mutation about two weeks ago. I have it mainly as it increases my carry weight. With it, my carry weight is 240. When it's not active (and decreasing instead) it's 220. With Strange in Numbers it's 250.
---
Seeing as my inventory weight stays consistently at 240+ without str food buffs, I have not seen it de-activate while in public teams. I have not been using private teams, and it might not work the same way in a private team.
---
It's not ultimately important for the original post's question if it works differently on a private team, but for the sake of clarity - especially to report bugs - it is notable information.
---
In that regard, if you want to consolidate a bug report between our testing, you will need to share your methodology and results with me so we can see if there are additional specifics to test.
---
Lever is way better BUT more importantly it looks cooler
---
Literally had this happen twice during uranium fever about an hour ago. Same guy both times.
---
Well I ain’t complaining hahaha. Might’ve had it for a while just haven’t even noticed
---
Spot on. "Indentured servitude", as mentioned above.
---
Am I an asshole for buy 2 off a vendor for 400 caps....
---
use to always run one gun army until realizing that shooting her in the air staggers her and can prevent her from landing if the timing works out
---
Every 10k of XP is 100 SCORE or for 150 Atoms you can buy a level. I'm saving any purchased levels until the end if I need to because they are the best value that way.
---
You can buy ranks for 150 atoms each or grind XP.
---
You are behind 2 week you have till september
---
They're doing double the points on the Legendary Run now until the 27th. That's really your best chance to catch up right now.
---
The title says lv 80 and the queens higher level than that
---
You on PS4?
---
Healing salves heal when u use, no animation...use them as my primary source....
---
so much passive aggression my child, go outside some (with a mask of course).
---
Dude, that's an amazing idea. I have 4 portable power packs and am totally going to do this. Seriously thanks for the suggestion lol.
---
I went inside to try and escape them and the robots inside were just as angry haha
---
~~Tried to reproduce this, no success.~~
---
~~No ground pound equipped, but Speed Demon active.~~
---
Woa!
---
Reload first, then equip the Fireworks mine, then be amazed. Even the slow lever is reloaded in less than 2s...
---
I launch 1-3 nukes on the Queen each night.  When I land on a server first thing I do is survey the map.  I like to fight from Delta, so if your base is at V9 I’ll probably just hop servers again.  I don’t mess with people like that.  On the other hand, if I’m just finishing the silo and you show up on the server, well...you may get nuked.  Sorry.
---
Ill buy em from you if your ps4
---
they really did rocket launchers dirty in the later fallouts. 
---
in 76 a base level 50 missile launcher, no perks or anything, does 321 damager per shot, with a rate of fire stat of 2
---
the same level 50 Gatling gun does 86 damage with a rate of fire of 20.
---
so sure the missile launcher does more damage per shot, but with a 10x faster fire rate, why would you ever use a missile launcher, not even touching on the ammo weight factor or reload speeds.
---
Were you on the same server as me? (he says sarcastically). I went magazine hunting today and pulled up a list of potential spawns from Wikia, and went 1 for about 25 locations before I gave up. And that was with Pannapictagraphacist (er whatever) enabled.
---
Edit: Loaded up the Percepti-bobble card instead and went hunting for bobbles on locations from the FO76 Interactive Map. About 4 for 12 (and oddly enough one of those was a magazine in place of a bobble).
---
I'm level 191, so grinding for your next level can be tedious if you're not motivated.
---
Everything said so far helps (mutations help, be it herbivores or carnivores, just eat corresponding food  choices ;  berry mentats for intelligence; etc.)
---
 Also buy and use the leader and intelligence bobbleheads if you see them for sale at player vendors. They stack with food and drug buffs.
---
Guided meditation, uranium fever, and line in the sand are my favourite events to grind.
---
I also prefer to run on an event team, and will knock out all the super easy quest like the horde events, and even agricultural center its about 600 xp for 2 or 3 minutes of work.
---
If you're not in the mood I'd level up a second lower level character. It's easier to take a new one from level 3 to 4, and it counts towards score challenges like others states.
---
Having a second character is great for NW as well. I'm at level 11 in NW in my main, and I wont play NW fir over an hour for 250 score. I will however run my alt for 1 NW game to level them up.
---
Ooof I've died more than once because I need a stimpak immediately and can't because my gun is still spinning down.  Spin up is a fine balancing mechanic I think, but you should be able to spin up without firing.  Make it so when you aim down sights it starts spinning the barrels, and doesn't start firing until you actually pull the trigger?  Otherwise if you don't aim down sights, there's still a delay until it start firing after spin up.
---
need more info to know what's going on.
---
Ps4?
---
I use both..
---
Instigating Hunting rifle for sniping/long range and Furious Lever for when things get up close and personal and or indoors
---
That the jukebox from FO3? Gonna have to snag that.
---
Wow... I'm having this happen too... wtf bethesda
---
That’s what I was planning on doing as well. I can only purchase 7 levels but that’s better than nothing :p
---
Need details on that beautiful industrial Power Armor set. Looks like a nice rail yard maintenance kit? Loving it. Love everything about it.
---
Wait really? When exactly in September?
---
Nice. Thanks for the input.
---
yes.
---
I do full health sneak/sniper with an AA/FFR Lever and can always always put in 1k worth of damage before she dies
---
All on a secondary character
---
If you dont do this its just disrespectful honestly
---
Welp, looks like Im switching to a melee build to use that staff skin. 
---
Also those camp items look fuuuuucking sick.
---
Xbox
---
I'm on xbox sadly
---
Kind of, but Bethesda treats this game as a cash grab and not much else. The customer support this game has is almost non-existent, the developers don't actively play or test their patches. You can tell no one wants to work on this game seriously. ESO has fared much better in terms of MMOs.
---
You can't even use them in NW, which makes them absolutely pointless.
---
During the run you are given 1500 (10 level ups) atoms also. This will give you an idea of where you should be on a specific date of the run.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hm3f2d/legendary_run_score_rundown_guide/
---
I do this and run it solo as it makes it a lot easier than hunting them down, I love this lol
---
Oh I still put it on my bed, it just takes up half of it 😂 I hate that the only bed with actual pillows and blankets for caps is like, so small lol
---
Technically you can as there is a decontamination shower you can use at start of event the rad back up when event is finished. I’m bloodied build and have no trouble mining ore.
---
Where’d they say that? I didn’t see that in the newswire
---
Honestly I got used to it and it's not such a big issue anymore, what DOES get me killed however is the fact that my ultracite gatling laser in particular decides to stop firing/run out of ammo with still, for instance, 300 rounds left a hell of a lot.
---
The spin down I agree with though. Especially where poison/acid is concerned. Not being able to stim up as you are in a HP race with the gun stopping spinning whilst you spam your hotkey is rather inane.
---
Fallout76Custom.ini file in the C:\\Users\\*username*\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76
---
add
---
    [Pipboy]
---
    fPAEffectColorR=1
---
    fPAEffectColorG=1
---
    fPAEffectColorB=1
---
This will make color white but you can change numbers to whatever color you like.
---
But the question is, have you ever had ghouls on your roof. Lol
---
Idk why but the last week or two ghouls were spawning on the roof of my camp, changed the roof from a flat roof to a slanted roof, hopefully won't have the issue anymore. More interestingly until that started happening my camp never got attacked by anything other than the 2 bandits down the road when my ally went after them.
---
I have an AA fixer that I use for tagging and thought that I had it equipped when I hit the Wendigo with my bloodied lever rifle. I know how powerful it is but didn't realize how weak the wendigo was.
---
My man
---
It kills 2 birds with one stone, I can do a good deed and get rid of one of the hundreds of stimpaks I'll never use.
---
Maybe they will give it out as rewards or as bullion purchases??
---
Oh yeah I know. But I do weak ass damage. And then get bitched at for not being able to defend the NPCs. When I can defend one side by myself withy rads
---
Made from only the rarest of canvas material.
---
If you crouch with leather/metal variations of Ghillie, it just floats. The legs look like goo and all around doesn't follow the body properly. Kick in the pants for getting it lol
---
Thanks. I knew you could do that in Fallout 4, I wasn't sure if 76 had the same settings. Appreciate you!
---
I just snorted. This.
---
Backpacks are skins, apply them at the armor work bench. 
---
Lootbag needs to be selected at the atom shop. 
---
Stash box just d-pad right in the camp construction menu. 
---
I haven't constructed the PA yet but it should just be a skin to be applied at the work bench.
---
I mean you can still try to get all the gold bullion plans get through the season and explore, but if you want true MMO things like raids or repeatable dungeons that's coming on September with one wasteland and in December (maybe) with fractured steel.
---
Don't get me wrong like I'm saying you have to actually wait two months or so for that content. You can still evolve your CAMP, your build or try to go to place of the map you've never been to, but yeah, fallout 76 is an MMO that has taken two years for having actual MMO stuff like repeatable dungeons, maybe Bethesda is planning in adding more repeatable content down the line.
---
this,  
---
a fatman should be a definite grab based on the lore, it's a man portable nuclear catapult, used in war the same as an artillery strike.  
---
so why are they the most ditched weapon along side the rolling pin? damage on them needs to be tripled at least.
---
eh thats a little dramatic. It is a little suspect that such broken stuff slips through QA, but I attribute that to them being completely overwhelmed 24/7. It is getting better for sure though, as slow and frustrating as that is.
---
Customer support can dilly dally, but I have never been truly ignored even for reporting hackers.
---
I do this Everytime white springs gets nuked for everyone of all levels, not only for legendaries but for experience as well. I just cripple the creature I'm fighting and move on (if there's people also on a killing spree around me)
---
I need one. I especially like the, "Unlike the shitass turrets, it also runs after distant scortched and supermutants and murders them." part. Lol
---
Some of the communist stuff looks good and should fit in well with almost any build!!
---
Perfect reply, right here.
---
Some are exploiting, some grind the shit out of the exp repeatable. I got about 10 score ranks from grinding exp during double exp.
---
Ahhhh yeah that totally makes sense.
---
And explains why waste not is only popping up every 3 days and heart of the enemy every other day.
---
Thanks for the explanation.
---
So some also seem to be somewhat buggy also I guess.
---
I feel you.From my experience it’s either bloodied build players that can’t even go down there or people that want the xp from the ghouls.I once even asked a guy that seemed like he wanted to help collect,but he just straight up told me he isn’t going to sacrifice his OPness to collect a bunch of rock (basically his words) and stayed up there killing the ghouls.
---
OP rename  your Radsuit so it appears at the top of the list, ie AaA Hazmat Suit.  This makes it super easy to find and equip when you spawn in the nuke zone.  Bit of a pain to switch back, but much faster than dieing over and over.
---
That would be awesome!
---
The only thing I do at that event is gather ore and repair turrets. I very rarely get a chance to tag the legendaries, but I’d rather just not fail the event, so that’s just my jam. I can never seem to do a ton of damage to the ghouls anyway, so I do what I can instead
---
It stores mods too.
---
Why thank you! You get one too!
---
Keep server hopping at East mountain lookout tower.
---
PLEASE let that new jukebox come with songs from Appalachia radio. The pic of the guy doing air guitar next to it hints that may be the case.
---
Also, hell yeah @ more raider stuff.
---
Yep I bought it I think 3 days ago when I was dubbing a set of pa.
---
Not going to lie, wouldn't even bother with the old challenges, for the amount of atoms it seemed like a waste of time. A lot of the game board has crap on the spaces, but personally I found this more fun. Frankly I think I'd just like adventure mode challenges that gave items rather than atoms or score though.
---
Excellent suggestions too! I'm gonna check em out myself....
---
Yeah it's still can be done but it is in two different files. Regular pip boy color in Fallout76Prefs.ini. Quick boy (or holographic pip boy) and PA hud in Fallout76Custom.ini.
---
100% this.
---
Many of us like to play this game drunk and adding this option would be potentially catastrophic.
---
the shotgun nerf made sense as it marginalized every other weapon. but the missile and fatman being lumped in sucked. they should have re balanced the launchers to make them at least viable. 2lbs per missile is way to much for the paltry damage we get.
---
This is a silly take.  It’s not free, the game costs money as does the subscription for online for (consoles anyhow). If any product’s features don’t function as promised or as expected it is a pretty fair reaction to be disappointed with the manufacturer of that product.
---
I can typically stay stocked on ammo for my .50cal. Here's what I would suggest for farming mats:
---
Steel: Blackwater mine(both Uranium fever or just the mole miners) or WestTek. Using the scrapper perk will generally get you around 15 steel/weapon. Lasers will give you mostly plastic though from WestTek
---
Lead: Lucky hole mine. Clear out the cultists and then go through with excavator PA. It'll net you somewhere around 150 crystal ore and maybe 300-400 lead ore. 
---
Acid(for smelting and gunpowder): Tanagra town. It's a little bit of a climb but there are several cave crickets that can get you up to 35 or so acid each run. I say up to because spawn can be a little weird or someone else might be farming. 
---
Cloth(gunpowder): I don't have any set farming spot but I just grab it from wherever and usually have plenty. 
---
I generally try to keep the lead as ore until I need it(the lead ore and acid weigh as much as bulk lead in storage). Same goes for gunpowder since it weighs so much and can't have its weight reduced by anything.
---
Yes, totally worth it. Its a slow and arduous process but it is getting better.
---
But for my first sniping legendary, I have an offer for the Instigating Lever, or I can hold out for an Instigating Bolt.
---
I'm just trying to find a damn instigating hunting so I can continue using 50 cal rounds.
---
I'll sell them at 25 the same with fusion cores. For me there's a quite good flow in them, my camp is at site Alpha /PC
---
&gt;For a game that anyone who has played 10 minutes of any other previous Bethesda game and has the smallest amount of reasonable foresight and managed expectations.... Knew was going to buggy af.....
---
It wasn't an ideal solution but past Bethesda games at least had the modding community there to pick up their slack.  Without that, of course you'd have more complaining.
---
Plus, I think there's a certain point where shit just starts getting absurd and the, "oh, Bethesda, you and your wacky bugs!" routine stops being funny.  76 is a mess even by Bethesda's meme-tier standards.
---
You'd expect a developer to get better or more familiar at this sort of thing over time, but they've actually gotten worse.  Or just stopped giving a fuck altogether.  Hard to tell, really.
---
You're welcome. It's always heartwarming how people start doing it after you do it.
---
Be kind to everyone even if they're not!
---
I keep getting a flood of 40-60 condition cores in my inventory despite always firing my UGL down to zero. It's kinda weird to be honest.
---
this is another reason explosive weapons are garbage in 76. the resistance system is horribly implemented so many of the "boss" monsters double dip on explosive resists.
---
Why did I not think of this last time that daily appeared. *face-palm*
---
I don't think that's all there is to it. The worst instances I get of this bug are, without exception, every time I get inside Vault Tec University to turn in the SB DNA sample. Since terminals get you out of stealth, to use it without being killed I always kill all the ghouls, and still It's basically impossible to fast travel from that cell.
---
Everywhere else, even if there are enemies nearby or even if I'm in [DANGER], I'm always able to Fast Travel away after a couple of tries at most.
---
I'm only 48 damn
---
Damn
---
I carry as many as I do just so I can stim other people whenever they get downed.  Trying to get that number under control because I doubt I need to revive everyone on the server 4 to 5 times.
---
Thinking the same. Just did a scorched earth. Because how the animation system is set up, my gatling laser had to "spin-down" and didn't let me heal. Died just after the queen died and for some reason got stuck in the revolving camera screen and couldn't respawn. Had 150lb worth of junk looted while I had to restart the game.
---
They only said they'd remove the penalties, not the bars themselves. So you'd still get Well Fed/Well Hydrated bonuses
---
Hey did you get your account back?
---
Its useful just tedious to operate
---
I think its either going to be 21 or 22. They are not really getting rid of the bars, just the negative effects from them being low. That's how I understood it.
---
Can confirm, the larger magazine blocks the middle of the sight with a bar and appears to be similar to the magazine on the thinderpipe. The only time you see the middle of the gunner sight is if you are turning your character left or right. If they took the bars off of the drum mag it wouldn't be so bad.
---
I use the gat as my workhorse weapon, bloodied with unyielding makes for a decent combo. If you have buffs for vats it works pretty nice, but manually aiming it can be a bit of a task if the enemies aren't close. It's really a shame because the long range accuracy for the gun is pretty good for a heavy gun.
---
Yeah, I get that all too well.  I focus on getting the Ore.  Shame that the Excavator Power Armor doesn't up the count for this event but it's understandable they don't.
---
Let's not forget to mentioned that:
---
The Blood Eagle Handmade skin suffers the same issue as the gold handmade where the silencer's texture is skewed.
---
The Fireplace Secret Door's back texture is flipped (the hinges are on the side that leaves the frame).
---
The Thunderpipe suffers the same issues with the sight as normal gatling guns do.
---
And let's not even start on the Ammo Converter...
---
And like, I wear clothes so it's not like I can see my armor no matter what I wear. So for me it's extra useless :c I'm really excited for the captain cosmos power armor but idk if I'll make it
---
Friends
---
True that.
---
I fast traveled and it fixed it
---
Really one of my most anticipated items.
---
Amen
---
I do and see it often at the Meditation Event
---
Hey. I did end up getting it back thankfully! Never doing something like that again lol.
---
It depends on why you stopped playing. If you gave up because if the endless grind for little or no rewards that you weren't happy with even when something worthwhile dropped, then you won't be happy again. It's totally impossible for anyone else to tell you whether or not you'll find it worth coming back to.
---
Play the game, make up your mind yourself.
---
Being a bit of an inventory management neat freak that bothers me a lot. It used to be because I was reloading compulsively and then it made me ill seeing all the ultracite fusion cores singled out not stacked endlessly. But now even though I don't do that, it happens anyway with that reload bug. 
---
I usually carry 40-60 cores at a time, so that list gets loooong at the end.
---
only reason I ever used plasmas were for the flamer mod, it melts queen
---
I will be doing but not yet as I’m at max caps. How much we talking and which one you after? I’ll see if I’ve got it as I’ve got different ones.
---
I’m on Xbox, sorry :)
---
I gotta ask though... Does the chicken coop give you a chicken for your camp like the fertilizer does with a Brahmin?
---
Please please please say yes.
---
X2
---
Never hurts. Be well fellow Vault buddy
---
Those that one shot em deserve to step on a Power Pipes Hot Wheels
---
Honestly I think it's a bad idea to get rid of the debuffs. It'd be much better if they greatly extended the life of foods, especially cooked ones, instead. And definitely disable the spoiling for dishes outside of one's immediate inventory, this way people can actually use their Diner CAMPs to sell food with good buffs. It'd open up a whole new sector to the in-game economy.
---
Right now the best foods take way too much time to grind ingredients, especially the carnivore recipes which rely a lot on random spawns, and one cannot even do a grind run of ingredients to last all week since both the ingredients and the food spoils extremely quickly within a same play session. It's ridiculous.
---
I was lucky to craft a secret service unyielding chest with +1 agility but I don't trade so finding four more unyielding with this will probably be impossible.
---
Is that cap invisible, I have agility at 32 then I'm losing 7 points in the special? 
---
I'll do some searching and reading.
---
That's about the high end for what i see them go for now. But value is subjective.
---
Yep, me too. I was lucky enough to get a bloodied gat and use it almost exclusively with VATS. Specially since I have twisted muscles and my gun accuracy is garbage.
---
Oh great! My friends got theirs back again this morning too.. They've said the same lol. It's awesome having people to play with again!
---
We all remember the great canvas shortage of '18
---
Those were hard times...
---
If you have a friend with a high level character, you guys can help eachother even faster. A friend had me and two others come to glass caverns to keep spawning high level scorched. We would just tag everything, he would kill, and I would get probably 200 xp or so a kill.   
---
There's also glitch at the "Line in the sand" event. If someone places their tent down in a specific spot, it'll cause all the scorched each wave to spawn right over the emitter. Just throw molotovs or any explosive and you'll rack up tons of xp
---
What do you have to do to start the quest I talked to meh but nothing has happened
---
You too!
---
Leather coat is tied for thre second rarest outfit in the game with items like the camo jumpsuits and tattered field jacket. Pre doops it was probably worth 90k caps
---
So..... um.....
---
Will the new signs say 'do not milk the cows'?.....
---
Can't display quest items.
---
I have 4 characters all have head cannon to me to what they did before the war, who they are, the kind of people they are and yhat influences the weapons I picked and the choices I make for them.
---
One of them I actually made to do some light roleplaying with a friend kind of making up a story as we go.
---
I wish it would be a cleaner car version and on actual wheels and perhaps a bigger car, like the Chryslus or Corvega.  
---
I'm using the Chryslus bed in my garage now =) But I guess this one will do better since an actual car in need of fixing.
---
So demoralizing. 15k Score lost. Wasn't even on during reset.
---
If it makes you feel better, I did the same lol
---
This is the funniest post I’ve read today.  Thank you. 😃
---
Its a scale, it starts at about 60% but gets better the lower it goes.
---
Thats a pretty good idea. I don't like selling rounds for 1 cap a piece because it feels like too much but I get nothing for selling them at 0.
---
Who knows. Depends how the spirit takes me. I have had my fun with my current sign. I used the Bear costume for agesa and used to dance next to the sign. Never got any scraps, but one day a person in the same bear outfit turned up and started taking pics with the sign and me in various poses together. 
---
A few minutes later, they must've been on comms with another firend as a person in PA turned up. I waved greeted etc and as they got out the PA aI actually laughed out loud as they were wearing the outfit too. 
---
Literally 5 pics on my loading screens are the 3 of us in various poses by my sign and I've never been happier. If I can now get a herd of cattle going I am ALLLLL for it :D
---
I think it's actually a good thing it's a skin in a way. At least there isn't yet ANOTHER thing to grind/rely on RNG for.
---
You can, but don't expect to really finish the event (a race for free stuff) at this point without massive grinding time or spending real world money for atoms to complete it.
---
My go-to is the one at black water mine on top of the building where the entrance is. Just server hop til it appears.
---
My guess is they do nothing. Would be great if they were atoms, you could pay the whole thing off then effectively claim the money back.
---
Me, staring at the level 80 sheepsquatch at my bog camp, spamming the follow me emote for 15 minutes
---
That's the auto-completion bug. Bethesda patched in a bandaid fix but are still working on a true fix
---
Ill reward u with stims on ps4. Good deed soldier; ad vic
---
Oh that makes sense why I only went up one lol. Thanks!
---
Same here. Took about 5 tries and snagged one.
---
The "out of ammo" even when you still have rounds gets me too. I think the problem has been coming from crafted cores that have more than 100 charge. 
---
Yup, it was an angler that killed me this last time. Died right after the SBQ died and for some reason got stuck in the revolving camera screen and had to reset the game. Had 150lbs or so of junk looted during that time
---
Watoga Transit hub has at least two that spawn in that one building. Heck, Watoga is practically crawling with them.
---
Good to know. Fellow junkie so I like the sound of this
---
we shared a bunch of tips in an earlier thread.
---
I am der ubermelch
---
Tyler county fair grounds, next to the whack a commie
---
Just useless.
---
So they’d essentially be losing the money they gained by you “paying” for tiers and you’d be getting that money back.. what sense does this make?? Bethesda would never implement it.
---
Lmao.  You got me man
---
Damn, well thank you for the answer
---
Pleasant valley ski resort. Inside first floor underneath the ramp that leads to the vendor.  There's a small table with one in it.  Sons of Dane compound, in the bank near the shooting gallery with all the bottles lined up, there's one there.  If you don't find them, server hop.  Thera also one at Emmet valley disposal site.  Inside sitting on the forklift drivers side.
---
I guess if you get desperate you could get the perceptibobble perk running. Not recommended though. A waste of perk points.
---
2nd week
---
...not if your build involves wearing liberty prime power armor...
---
&lt;awkward liberty prime noises&gt;
---
I'd go along with that. I use power user so I get 999 from all cores overcharged, but it gets me in the weirdest times. I usually run straight fora tent etc after the SBQ because I really don't wanna die to a mirelurk king or something to that and lose my flux or whatever. 
---
It's such a small thing but it's SOO annoying, and when you stack it alongside all the other small annoyances, they begin to grate massively.
---
It’s crazy when you realize other games don’t have bugs and glitches.
---
Most people getting hit with the bug aren't on during reset. Ultimately there is no way to avoid it happening 100%.
---
They aren’t fixing this. Maybe next season but I wouldn’t hold your breath. Management does not care if you have if you lose free points for playing when you can literally buy your way to the end. Apologies for being cynical but if I were management I would absolutely back burner this issue every time dev or QA bring it up.
---
im rank 78 atm and i have not exploited to get to where i was, just a lot of playing. too much, tbh
---
Claimed them all man.
---
It fair enough to believe what you want to believe, until it causes you too harass other people over it, or encourage other people to do the same. 
---
So maybe you should re-evaluate that, and let people play how they enjoy playing until you have hard evidence that it would benefit them to do otherwise.
---
At least yours stays on your armor! My buddy had an issue where he put it on the armor, walked forward, and the gillie skin stayed in place where he equip it. Everytime shit like that happens, on our discord call we say "16 TIMES the detail." We say it at least 5 times a night. Perfect game.
---
Perk card packs are fillers????? Someone is not aware of how the legendary perks work.
---
If they always spawn at the same exact spot; you could make a fling trap or a cage or something. *spawn*-*fling!*
---
Is the Grelok staff a skin for sledgehammers?
---
Prior to going bloodied my end game was a mix of benefits, with the very best peices that complimented each other.
---
There's a beauty to not locking yourself into 1 class if you will.
---
Ideally all your peices will be 3 star--  
---
I like/reccomend the 20% less weight for food/ammo/chems as a good secondary legendary effect.
---
Poison resistant is really beneficial with two peices, but one will keep you from dying when surprise attacked by a crypted that uses it.
---
If you dont have bird bones mutation the 50% less fall damage on legs is great.
---
For primary perks, vanguard is strong like others said, but a peice of bolstering will help keep you alive. Also if you dont like dying, and dont want to use the perk for it, a peice of auto-stim ain't bad. 
---
One tip I'd reccomend is having a full set of troubleshooters (all crafted to be ultralight) if you do alot of encrypted or robot heavy events. Robots are the only enemy that ruin your day with energy and Melee attacks.  It's easier for me to switch into a full set of troubleshooters for encrypted than trying to balance my normal build to incorporate them.
---
Good one here lol
---
The spin-up makes sense and I would agree that it's fair. But that was exactly what I was thinking. It should be able to be spun up without firing. IIRC, CoD has spin up while aiming down sights. I think Doom has it too. Of course, regardless of whether it's ADS or not, a simple way to balance would just be that it slows you down. Another option that I was thinking would be to make it like fusion rifles from Destiny. You can keep tapping the trigger to keep the spin going but just without firing.
---
I always do the follow me, but then twice this week I did a one “shot” by accident. Not usually a problem as a melee player but I forget that my MMG is actually pretty strong. I felt like such a dick. We really need that I’m sorry emote.
---
That said, I also skipped a SQB fight the other day and about two seconds after the alert came up, the event was ended so some high level must have taken it out quickly. I felt like much less of a dick.
---
Super duper has 30% chance to give you DOUBLE of what you craft... It really helps with ammo and other things you craft.
---
Yes thats right. I am playing Power Armor with legendary heavy explosive weapons since the TSE nearf and iam totaly fine with it, i can kill all enemies without any problem. So you dont have to play bloodied to be good and have fun.
---
I do the same, I carry an Explosive Combat Rifle just for tagging legendary enemies even though I'm a Shotgunner.
---
Oh, thanks, never faced it before. My luck it first happened at first double-xp weekend.
---
Then they need to hire more community people and have better communication with both them and the community so everyone knows what's going on in these situations. It's been overwhelmingly apparent that the comms between the devs and community people have been spotty at best and the community correspondence team gets the short end of the stick. 
---
And don't tag someone in your comment when your whole point is to cut them some slack. Kinda counter to your point.
---
Reach out and touch fate
---
I’ve got a QE western revolver just so I can shoot the ground next to them to just tag it! No legos under my feet 😂😂
---
I wonder when they do the level scaling for everything if they will do something then and we will see a difference after 3 months when the game is playable again.
---
Thanks for the info. I think I may just stop using gatling lasers/plasmas though. Tbh, the main reason why I'm even using them is to try and burn through all my fusion/plasma/ultracite cores.
---
Damn, I know.  Hoping they at least extend the season, but not counting on it.
---
You could always move to Watoga and spend your time grinding out the kill robots with x for XP and Atom.
---
250 gold bullions for 10 weeks of grinding. While you can get 200 daily and 300 more weekly... Something doesn't add up lol
---
I have a really strong opinion on this matter that I am just going to say is strong and leave it at that for right now...
---
yeah....
---
It's on the start screen when you login to the game. If you're on console it'll be in the upper right corner of the screen.
---
Fortunately the power armor seems to pull the lowest available core so the inventory issue isn't as bad as it could be. I'm used to compulsive reloads but since running ugl ill use bashes to cancel reloads if I start and the count doesn't show 000
---
I stopped doing this event when I bought The Fixer plan. 
---
Most players don't contribute to be a conduit and the Sheepsquash body vanishes most of the time.
---
1 cap each. None.
---
Oops Im dumb, I read Legacy Meta, haha. I guess I need coffee.  
---
I agree, some of the legendary bonuses feels more like a punishment than reward lol!
---
Gives them the giggles.
---
As far as I know, most are pretty worthless. When all the gift boxes were duped(a rather ungodly amount), they're more or less just garbage that people will drop wherever.
---
It's so goddamn stupid, and of course they put it during the double SCORE weekend lmao
---
i use solely furious and i melt shit no problem. stop whining and do what you want.
---
Well, it would depend on how soon you paid off and how many atoms challenges were worth but either way I don't see them doing something to risk their bottom line like that.
---
That’s why I never die.....
---
Try to find a vampire pipe rifle. It's enough to tag a legendary and then focus on the normal mobs with out having to run. Plus .38 is super common, gives it a use beyond level 10.
---
What about the rest of the enemies. Should I tag them and let the low levels kill them for the xp? Like in uranium fever, do I equip my trusty pipe iron and smak everyone once, let the mole miners trash the excavators, wait for all the low levels to kill them all, and then repair the excavators? With bloodied gun-fu, and an auto weapon, it's really hard to not kill everything. 
---
I don't really feel like I should be there. 
---
I'm just there for the junk and the legendaries. And maybe treasure notes. And achievements. And XP. And boredom.
---
I spent $60 on atoms to rank up. I’m at level 92
---
WS towards the golf club?  
---
Just cleaned it out of 10mm and plasma carts :)
---
Yeah you don't even need a second weapon to switch to for tagging if you go give it a bash or two.
---
In NW if you’re wearing that Brahmin outfit what counts as a headshot?
---
I already have 2 of them in a display case. They're not flagged as a quest item.
---
Straight up sounds like he was doing it on purpose to troll you.  I commend your commitment though!!
---
I’m an early game player. Not everyone has been on for two years. I’ve never even seen a secret service helmet.
---
I play melee because I hate ammo. I found my way into the bloodied life not because I wanted to but because i am a hoarder and radicool gave me more STR to carry more things. Then y’all told me about serendipity and nerd rage unyielding armor et al and I was hooked. Legendary run has cemented this way of gameplay as it’s most efficient and I can play for an hour or two and still level up being in the mid 400s.
---
The only rare one is the Scorched Beast Queen. It drops at the queen fights, but you stop getting it if you learn it. The wendigo didn’t drop from the presents but you only get it from one of the Van Lowe Taxidermy Quests.
---
Why? Does them getting/giving free ammo harm the game?
---
I was very confused for a while, and then had a solid chuckle when the camera switched to first person
---
I don't understand are you saying these are the only way you can do damage or youve found than can do damage
---
No one will buy them except maybe new players, 1-5 caps
---
Also the bear one is quest only.
---
Still chasing that queen claw /s
---
Very helpful response without the link. Thank you for contributing
---
That's understandable your new, but people that have been here and just don't want to do the grind are who I'm speaking to
---
Urinal in the Agricultural Research Center
---
I dont think people should really sweat it, especially if they started on day 1, and have actively been completing dailies/weekly's, and doing the repeatable xp once or twice a day. Many documents where people did the math showed that's what was and is needed.
---
Those documents and original math didn't factor in the increase in dailies, double xp, and double score events.
---
If you're on here and grinding pretty hard, let's say getting that repeatable more than 5 times a day, your golden. 
---
Even if you miss a day, or factor in this missing 1200, you'll get it.
---
I grind about 4 to 5 hrs a day, and am at level 59, a few levels ahead of schedule. (I think you need to be at 54 before end of week). I've also skipped about half the NW challenges, missed a normal daily once or twice, and also missed last Saturday completely (which was double Xp as well).
---
I run a junkie heavy pa a junkie commando and a furious commando and I have no problems killing anything,  sure bloody is top damage but its ok to not always follow the leader blaze your own path
---
Queen claw isn’t in the game yet.
---
Looks like a settler from foundation got his hands on a power armor, and put his welding skills to use.
---
Not on pc I’m on PS4
---
What about my fridge
---
It’s marked as sarcasm.
---
More communism? *Good...*
---
how do they work?  I'm relatively low level (lvl 71) but my understanding is I should have unlocked 1 at lvl 50?
---
I’m old.
---
Didn’t they do this once already before?
---
oh yeah, i drop those and 40 mm grenades as soon as i pick them up. if only there were some sort of *working* ammo converter.
---
vault-tec agricultural research center, across the river from flatwoods. there are four spawn locations for them. server hop till you find one. that's what i did. took like 10 minutes but better than wasting caps/time hunting for one.
---
Also apparently you can’t even trade it.
---
Even worse it’s a full helmet so you can’t use glasses/mask. 
---
I’ll discard your input and stand by my suggestion.
---
You get legendary perks with perk coins, you get perk coins by scrapping perk cards. Therefore, 10 perk card packs = 50 coins = 1st legendary level for any legendary perk.
---
Wow, I didnt know that. Makes it even worse imo.
---
Oh good that your friends got their’s back! I know right, it’s definitely nice to play with your friends🙂
---
That would result in everyone using whatever becomes the “meta” helmet.
---
No worries. I’m old too.
---
My only problem with one wasteland is that like level areas should be one hit when you go back. Scale the high level stuff.
---
I know lots of people think that mutant's needs a major buff(like instead of the flat 10%, it's 5% for each mutation). Nocturnal is essentially garbage and then there's all of the enemy-type-specifics that, while useable, aren't often bothered with.
---
(fixing explosive weapons like grenades, missiles, and fatmans would be nice. Same goes for dense/fireproof against your own splash damage.)
---
That prefab bunker looks nice
---
none are worth anything. their only value is when you haven't learned them yet. 1 cap at most. better to just drop them in noob areas and be done with it.
---

---
1) You're argument is misguided.
---
2) I literally have a glitched weapon that I made myself so I know what I'm talking about.
---
3) Yes one does need to attach the flamer barrel to the plasma gun first for the glitch to work.
---
4) There is no Pulse Capacitor for the plasma gun so that "fact" was useless.
---
5) lookit the pic.
---
6) Stop trying to explain to me that I'm wrong when I literally have said weapon in my inventory.
---
In order to modify ones plasma gun in this way takes the plasma gun flamer barrel and the pulse capacitor plan from the caster that can be purchased with bullion from vault 79.  
---
Maybe this subreddit is the worst for you because you don't pay attention and try to mansplain to strangers.
---
Lol that would be hilarious actually.
---
I was just at a persons CAMP and saw a bunch of brown paper bags. There were hundreds of mounted head plans.
---
On PS4. 
---
I know I’ve taken many dozens out of my vendors and tossed them.
---
What they need to do is balance everything, whether it’s buffing some things or nerfing some things it doesn’t matter. Then make the maximum level for a weapon higher than it already is, and make the max level for enemies higher than what it currently is. This would make the game more fun
---
OR just add a personal difficulty slider with one wasteland and it effects how much xp you get, higher xp on harder difficulties and harder enemies
---
I think rude people like you are the major drain.
---
The fact is on public servers many of these have been grabbed as they aren't instanced.
---
Of course I don’t know, but it sounds like your account was hacked.  I don’t know if Bethesda will do anything to restore your items.  
---
Account name and password with weird assortment of letters, numbers and symbols is only defense we have from hacking.  The system is very weak in that reguard.
---
You can't trade it because of the grind, and dupers.
---
Obviously it's a full helmet why would you want to wear glasses and a mask
---
Ok then
---
I guess that makes three of us. :/
---
I don't disagree. If it's just blanket everything scales up to your level, it's gonna be monotonous af. I'll never do swarm of suitors again lol
---
I just hit 74 and I accepted ill just do them post 100 on accident
---
Ohhhhh. Gotcha! Do I need to be in the test server for this? I haven't seen any way to scrap perk cards (although, I haven't looked either).
---
what does that have to do with anything? duping happens on consoles too.
---
50 crashes..... so way less than average. Wow. Lucky you.
---
Lol jukebox is all you need
---
Yup, the small things matter. Then with all the lag, server delay, and so forth you're more than likely going to die.
---
you should get ten rank up's worth of atoms as rewards from the event itself, so as long as you dont spend them and get to 90 by the last day, you're golden.
---
People who have already hit 100 reported that they do nothing.
---
Thanks you for going so in depth. This will really help with creating whatever I end up with
---
lost home near watoga.
---
Yeah I just want levels to have some meaning while still have areas to fear end game
---
It is a good long range option for mele builds since you aren't really using it to kill the big enemies, more to get rid of small enemies and make scorchbeast land/get agro. And it kills most regular enemies in just a few hits even without heavy gunner.
---
I use to heavy guns personally, my bloodied gat and a bloodied minigun. The minigun is used mainly to quick kill legendaries and big enemies though... or anything that kills me quick like assaultrons or mirelurk kings... mirelurk kings, I hate them so much. Lol
---
That's outstanding man
---
I hope a scorched beast on their face.
---
I've been playing with no weapons and armor lately. Only use what I loot and dump when quest or challenge is done. I literally naked punched the deathclaw death with ease.
---
I'm doing it all for the Captain Cosmos Jetpack (although I do appreciate the Sheepsquatch plushie) any feed back on that item? It it plans for a jetpack or a skin for existing jetpacks?
---
Yes it’s only been in the PTS. It’s not a live feature for the standard game yet.
---
How much damage do you need to do to an enemy to get the goods? 10%? Any damage whatsoever?
---
Same here, lost score and Bethesda response is basically sorry your screwed and we don't care!
---
Shoot back.
---
Thank you for the knowledge sir!
---
The floaters were actually an enemy from and older Fallout title if I remember correctly it had something to do with the FEV which mutated humans into supermutants, if I remember correctly they are some sort of worm.
---
Only ones I find value in the SBQ scorchbeast &amp; Mothman(sometimes) lol
---
Bloodied is way over hyped there is no need to do that much damage in this game I run furious heavy and rifle does plenty of damage
---
Yeah same here. I use all those perks but roam with full health. Sometimes shit gets real and I get to use all those perks but I'm still beastly without tapping into low health.
---
Say what now?? As far as I can tell you are super and or over milk.
---
Holy wall of text batman...
---
😂😂😂 you just Rick Rolled me!!!
---
I lost another weapon to an actual glitch one time and they said they lacked the tools to fix it.  I let it go as a loss.  Then all of a sudden they're returning people's inventories.  Ok.  Great.  They're taking care of people.  Then this happens to me and I cant get any help again.  Hacked or not...I lost inventory through no fault of my own.  If they can restore me then they should do that.
---
By the way...the glitch was to my IE pump shotgun.   The explosive perk disappeared altogether and was replaced by a third star perk.  Agility or vats refill or something.
---
I normally just stay in the back cloaked with a Lever Action that also mastered bloodied Gun-fu.
---
When it comes to the normal Mole Miners, I just kill them, there's plenty for low levels to kill and loot.
---
Legendaries, bash with a gun then use emote.
---
Most events bring that feeling that you really shouldn't be there, they're mostly just themed loot/Xp/Notes zones.
---
Had to make it look like a discussion ;)
---
gotcha
---
It's the most painful event I've ever done. I really want the radiation barrel plan but I only ever get to the ore, only need 3 people to collect ore but no one does it. Real pain in the arse.
---
I'm on ps4 as well. And again, the gift boxes were duped so much that people would just throw them around like confetti
---
Yeah my guy jumped but I've got his PSN name. This isn't over... I'm gonna go with your idea when I see his place sitting idle.
---
Well played! I honestly busted out laughing here at work! Good one! 😬😂😬
---
edit: great. Now I’m going to be singing this for the rest of my shift!! 😭😭😭
---
I see you got one but the rng is horrible at the purveyor.  Better off trading for one.
---
Good luck !
---
Mine too, idk why🤷🏼‍♂️😂
---
Nope mine worked fine.
---
You need hundreds of perk cards for the legendary perk. Those few don't make any difference
---
Yes. In a few weeks from now, you are going to be begging to bethesda for more perk card packs. So trust me, we want them to be om all future seasons from now on.
---
They're all either quest rewards or were in Holiday Gifts which were mass duped on all systems.
---
The only exceptions are the Mounted Scorchbeast, which were released en masse when the Miner's Pails were introduced, and the Mounted Scorchbeast Queen, which only drops from Scorched Earth and doesn't drop after you've learned it.
---
Wow, that's cool. A ghillie suit for pacifist. /s But, it's on their 'radar' like adrenaline, fast travel, respawn, immovable NPCs, trade bugs, despawning corpses, blah, blah, fucking, blah.
---
Yeah very thankful for that! Thanks a lot for the well wishes.
---
I just found one on top of the little shack at the northern tip of Deathclaw Island. Good luck!
---
Yeah totally.
---
My character overslept on reclamation day and he was the last one out of the vault.
---
lol maybe a bit of an overkill
---
None of the Armor paints I have work for NW except for the Nuclear Camo ones from Fallout 1st.
---
I love how they downvoted me for trying to be helpful. Dicks...
---
Gamertag?
---
But that sound makes my brain go Brrr from the dopamine
---
The game likes to spawn mobs in when people fast travel to your base. I frequently need to return to my base when I see someone near it or my machines disappear from the map quick thanks to the scorched, scorch beasts, mirelurk kings, mirelurk queens, anglers and super mutants that spawn.
---
I run bloodied and want it to be reworked. Unyielding gives too many perks to use anything else.
---
NO WONDER HE KEEPS COMIN BACK
---
I wouldn't complain about that Gauss tbh, goes nice in a collection of Bloodied buillon Gauss weapons
---
Oh, thanks, didn't know that. I never actually tried the card because of the description.
---
The green means the workshop has those resources available and white means it will take those resources from your inventory
---
Yeah I suppose the only ones I have that work in the NW armor are those. It just feels strange since they felt inclined to put a skin for each level of armor into the game but they don’t get applied.
---
So get a low damage weapon? Or heal up before you do an event with guaranteed legendaries. I'm bloodied as well but only one-shot legendaries if I run into them in the world so I'm not prepared, or if no one else shows at events.
---
That made my but pucker
---
The green means you’re using workshop resources, yes, but they can only be used in the workshop. If you scrap something you built in the workshop, the recourses returned will stay in the workshop budget. 
---
Anything you craft (weapons, armor, food) will use your own stashed resources, even while in a workshop.
---
It's not just about damage, it's max caps at vendors, max ap, strength, xp.
---
They should hire you
---
Any idea how to make this happen? For science.
---
Full health Shotgun build and have no problems.
---
Lunchboxes not working after the fourth is opened is the hardest proof that damn near *no* testing is done.
---
Ill never understand how the people killing the ghouls can't keep a single scavenger alive. I can keep them all alive by myself but can't get ore, and when I do grab ore I'll come back to find we're down to one scavenger with almost no health and no one even covers me while im trying to heal them.
---
I want a Dr. Zorbo plushie dammit!
---
If you server hop the location might change, not 100% sure though
---
Yep. Found a three star legendary. Saw some lvl 15-20s nearby so i did  the whole follow me emote, which wasnt necessary as the scorch beast decided to follow me anyways. Only one managed to tag it before a lvl 200 came up and killed it in a few hits.   
---
we did the angry emote and he left with the confused emote.
---
Percepti-Bobble + Map76
---
ah, the good ol' crashed space station...
---
...before the weird neighbors moved in...
---
"Do I even have a team," you muttered under your last breath
---
I am like unto a GOD!!!
---
It’s probably so that it doesn’t get auto scrapped.
---
You're sure confident for someone entirely wrong. Here's an image from my level 5 mule who has done next to no quests, scrapped almost no weapons, and definitely has not done the vault raid to be able to purchase plans from Regs. If he had Science Expert he could put a pulse capacitor on a plasma rifle. 
---
So, yes, there is a fucking pulse capacitor for the plasma gun, and it's not in any way related to the pulse capacitor for the plasma caster. It's just in the fucking game.
---
To quote your dumb ass, "lookit the pic."

Oh goodie goodie, it's about to go down
---
Thanks for the share. I always appreciate the data mines. That way I can determine how many Atoms I'll be spending or saving. There are some interesting items, but almost none of them fit my style or themes. They're just like the Legendary Run rewards. I guess that's a silver lining in the world after the Atoms tightening.
---
Well the only legendary that spawns at line in the Sand is the scorchbeast. The ghoulieboiz don't ever do. At least in the many times I've done the event.
---
Reattach the stairs and start scrap/storing the floors furthest away from stairs as to not leave any floor ‘unsupported’.
---
Yeah, and that makes sense if they had nowhere else to spawn, but the thing is, people manage to pull this off with just one TENT placement, and given that I've seen multiple TENTs lined up along that road, it stands to reason that a single TENT doesn't actually block *all* the spawn points.  So, then, why doesn't it default to the others?
---
For that matter, what is actually doing the blocking?  We might surmise it's the radius of the TENT, because certainly if it's the physical TENT model, there should be several fallback spawn points.  But if it is the radius of the TENT, why does a successful block require rather specific placement?  The TENT's radius is very coarse, after all.  You would think placing it in the general area would be good enough.
---
I've actually been meaning to ask someone versed in the Creation Engine about how the spawning mechanism works, because this quirk honestly fascinates me.
---
Its worth 15k
---
If you close the game out and reload it he will be somewhere else
---
This is amazing - thank you!
---
What the hell is wrong with that?
---
As I’m currently running a explosive build I for one welcome the missiles.
---
I dig it. Btw when did we get a white wallpaper?!
---
What are you even talking about??? It’s a hacked weapon it has nothing to do with duping
---
The only other thing I can think of is that Graham (spelling?) the super mutant trader spawnd nearby and your turrets took offence and stated a fight, my defences will always target traders but he, apparently, fights back
---
This is why I love the atmosphere and lore of 76. 
---
I'm a doctoral student starting my dissertation on automation tech and the like in American political culture. Prewar Appalchia fascinates me because of all the potential to make such an automated society work for everyone, but the complete lack of political motives to do so (because Communism).
---
No problem,I must also suggest if you are going down that route that you get the adrenal reaction mutation. Helps to buff you damage a bit more.
---
bloodied/unyielding is fine because its the only build that have that long lasting progression obtaining armor set/mutations/guns and then finding the right balance of damage versus survivability and quality of life (as too much damage is overkill most players start to weight into quality of life perks). not to mention that finding that right roll of unyielding armor is a never-ending quest. 
---
make other builds have same progression/rewards and bloodied will quickly fade from "top meta". vats builds need to have amor sets/specific guns/mutations. heavy gunners need to have associated armor sets/mutations. otherwise they are just too bland and uninteresting. and to be fair due to multiple bugs in this game "damage" is just an abstract number - "magic" weapons do 2x-10x damage of what top-specced bloodied character can do. so what? nobody seems to care.
---
Standing in the fences *definitely* helps nobody. Standing on the ground *might* help everyone.
---
Which one do you choose?
---
I think the weakest archetypes like pistols need a buff, but "Buff everything else instead!" is flawed logic. That's doing more work to make the game *less* balanced instead of directly addressing the legendaries that stand out and dominate the meta.
---
Because you can use a helmet plus up to two other items. Helmets don’t have stats.
---
Dupers are cheaters, I prefer not trading with them when I’m aware.
---
And again, new players have nothing to do with your argument. Input noted, but still invalid.
---
There's a static spawn no way
---
Thank you.. while ago I think
---
I tried scrapping the floors in order from furthest away already it didn’t work I also tried picking them up in the order I put them down in (which sometimes works) but I didn’t try re attaching the stairs
---
Thats a another issue. I have a setup at the ammo factory I don't want to lose
---
I think inventories should have been wiped and characters reset. They can still play and keep their atoms and purchases but at least its a strong message. 
---
In the long run I just play and trade. All it really did was make B tier stuff less valuable. Most of the fun for me is the rush of getting legitimate loot in a drop of scrip roll. 
---
I'd imagine most of the people who got the fixers and plasmas are bored now that the chase is over.
---
Just my 2 caps....
---
I have a mutants explosive handmade and it does the job for the most part. I'm not one shotting anything above level 30 but you don't really have to it's automatic for a reason. My furious explosive fixer kills a bit better but it's the same as far as one shotting. I really don't get how everyone thinks that if you can't kill something with a single bullet then it's not any good. If you can kill everything really easily and never have to worry about dying doesn't that make the game pretty stale?
---
No I already know about the secret passage. Tbh I just couldn't remember how much I actually get and didn't want to overestimate I'm pretty sure I usually get all the lead. Outta curiosity though where do you go for acid? I farm the snallygasters at the flooded train yard then I do the bears at nuke silos and end with the 2 bears west of the mountain side bed and breakfast where my base is lands me around 60 acid (low end)
---
I actually prefer the slight shoulder look.
---
There's just one thing I would like them to do; 
---
Never change.
---
One of the pilot suit underarmor plans is in a train car near Watoga, the one that usually has a dead Mr Handy and a lurking Assaultron
---
There is a dupe method that uses vendors and server hopping. I wasnt disputing if it was hacked or not.
---
There was rumors of dupers having their items removed. Were you a duper? Kinda sounds like it if you had legacies spread across 5 characters.
---
Therefore for the sake of new players Bethesda should make this simple fix.
---
Yep.
---
You get +1 to all SPECIAL (except END) at 60%, then +2 at 40%, and +3 at 20%.
---
The reason Bloodied builds are so strong is because, at 20%, you also get things like Nerd Rage and Adrenal Reaction working at their peak, which amplifies all this.
---
But, strictly speaking, you don't need to be full-on Bloodied to receive some of Unyielding's benefits, and those benefits are pretty good even at the first tier.
---
Hmm..that’s strange. Maybe move the stairs to each floor piece to scrap it?? Idk man that would piss me off also
---
I assume food will still spoil and buffs will still work. I heard they are removing the negative effects of not eating or drinking.
---
As someone else mentioned the option to switch between is the best and I wish more games had it
---
That being said Ive first now in more recent months found third person more enjoyable (except when looting bodies that can be buggy) especially in NW, took me a lil time to get used to it but damn it gives quite an edge in pvp I believe
---
Also its cinematic af
---
Nope, I tried it.
---
Sadly nope, it was the first thing I tried. :'D
---
I’m pretty sure level scaling is just going to make the game harder for under geared players. As of now end game damage is redundant outside of three mobs (SBQ, colossus, imposter) and top tier damage builds aren’t going to bat an eyelash at buffed mobs.
---
Yes they do.
---
It’s crazy because this had also previously happened to me and I had to move my whole camp
---
Well played execution.
---
No social distancing needed if you’re on the street.
---
I have not exploited and just got to 63 but I did every challenge except two or 3 nw challenges. Repeatable is to much but if I play 3 to 4 hours every night I hit it a couple times
---
It may just be the server playing up. I'll try again in the morning, see if that makes a difference.
---
Is anything rare now?
---
This is my regular daily route to look for Bobble Heads, and I "usually" find at least one or two, just from these spots.
---
Sweetwater's place, next to Giant Teapot - second floor, on the floor beside toilet.
---
Red Rocket, next to Giant Teapot - On a shelf under far cash register (there is normally a 10mm pistol on that same shelf).
---
Shed behind Silva Homestead (with the Mr. Handy inside) - right next to computer terminal, on that table.
---
Silva Homestead - second floor, on the dresser/table to left when you enter the room.
---
Lewis &amp; Son's Farming Supply - Greenhouse, sitting next to the cash register.
---
Lewis &amp; Son's Farming Supply - Large building (garage?), first floor, sitting on top of the large engine block.
---
Lewis &amp; Son's Farming Supply - Second floor, sitting on top of a barrel.
---
I saw the tenderizer is going to drop as a plan at meat week. This will likely make it a drop from the purveyor. 
---
That aside, yes I think the other stuff needs to be reworked badly.
---
Yea wtf, contain that shit to 1 mile. You wanna risk the rest of us stepping on it?
---
Yes, please!
---
Why even ask that lol. Just take 2 seconds to try it for yourself 😂
---
WOW!  That fireplace tho!
---
Been trying for 2 hrs with Map76.
---
Aye. Spawn in at NAR Repair yard and check the shed on the table. Then run down the track towards watoga and check the train car. Rinse and repeat. This is only for underarmor plans. You can get some other plans as well which aren't common.
---
I sell literally all plans for one cap each except for like the REALLY rare ones (fixer, backpack mods, formula p, ECT) All mounted plans I drop at the overseers camp for the new players. All ammo too even cryo cells, plasma cores everything for one cap. Kinda have a dollar store come to think of it lol
---
No, that just means you're lucky?
---
Very modern. Seems the World Series trophy got bigger between now and 2103
---
How about nocturnal armor, like is anyone using this and switching it out during to day or just taking the hit during the day
---
I wouldn't do that. Big chance your pet will clip into the walls and die  while it tries to patrol the C.A.M.P. 
---
That's just in my experience though.
---
The left side looks like a cat speaking over a wall.
---
Yeah not very wasteland like :)
---
A (delusional) sense of fulfillment they'll never get from their loveless, meaningless, empty lives. So sad 😢
---
Well shit. Theres a LOT of that I want. Gonna be expensive time coming up unless maybe some of it will be for a new season. Good to see they are bring in more things with a junk like/home made aesthetic
---
She also dropped you fluxes and repair kits that no other enemy in this game does. And prime weapon receiver plans if you don't have them all already.
---
I throw on the perk that clears rads from people when you rez them to troll bloodied builds. 
---
I prefer using cannibalism but it doesn’t work half the time...
---
I always thought the number of stars on the legendary enemy would correspond to the stars on the drop, I'm painfully aware that's not the case in 76, but it worked like that in FO4 right? Or am I just going crazy
---
The skeleton body :)
---
Sorry, didn't realize you wanted all the work done by others.
---
Well yeah, the whole idea of seasons is to sell fluff. Haven't found a game that doesnt.
---
Yeah I'm aware of that but I want something other than that.
---
They can grief ur base with explosive bait and orbital strikes...or even by dragging enemies over to it
---
....that's my favorite
---
It may have been patched by now.  But if you find a spawn point for the NPCs that carry the item, you can server hop that location looking on the ground.  If it’s there you could pick it up and it goes to your misc section.  
---
However, they may have patched this so they now end up in junk section.  I honestly can’t confirm either way.
---
Haha it was flat but I wanted lights behind it
---
Do the eyes on the night vision googles light up, I wonder?
---
You mean succed from the inside of their throat meat.
---
Well, if you've got a bunch of them banked, you could do worse.  Bethesda was really sneaky about where they placed them.
---
I'm pretty sure I got my Percepti-Bobble from one of the Perk Card Packs, but it's probably legacy because they don't give out cards that only have a single rank anymore.
---
Great ideas!!
---
I think a refrigerated vendor would be a great addition as well. Opening up new avenues of gameplay for people.
---
Apart from that, whatever you think looks good OP.
---
Because the player base has been okay with it so far. Sure, people complain. But they also keep playing and buying so....
---
I have toured through Organ Cave before.  That would be a GREAT addition to FO76!  :)
---
They kind of have to with the legendary run.  Less people willing to buy things means they need to put in better things.
---
Oooh I dunno. Playing that same riff over and OVER and OVERRRRRRR!!!!! Nope, can't even think about it.
---
I almost just spit up after reading that
---
If it's a non melee weapon, pistol whip them.
---
Yes, I have had that happen a few times.
---
The awesome friends I made, and NW.
---
Ur house sux or something.
---
STRING YOUR ENTRAILS UP LIKE CHRISTMAS TINSLE!!!
---
They're kill more people a year than heart disease. Fuck those bastards.
---
This is a good post.  Thank you
---
Your rhyme made me smile and I will be singing this out over area chat from now on during the queen fight !
---
They clearly have the ability to restore your account.  And are choosing not to.  You have my sympathy.  I cross my fingers hoping this doesn’t happen to me. I’d be devastated.
---
My Supressors Tire Iron with 15% Damage Reduction on block and 50% Melee Damage Reflected would like a word.
---
Jk. It's trash, but I LOVE trolling Bloodied melee builds with it.
---
A crashed saucer or spaceship to build a home inside of would have been nice.
---
Nope, like everyone... I tried
---
Are you playing with sound? The officers make a beeping sound.  Otherwise you might be able to just randomly find another
---
Spamming events, multiple accounts, exploiting bugs. A lot of players talk about it very openly. Go watch a few streamers, they'll even explain how its done.
---
Hunters long coat would look pretty cool
---
The sooner you can return his property, the better.
---
That cell is huge. There's ghouls in most rooms and the robots in the other rooms may still be detecting you. It's not as simple as being hidden, caution or danger.
---
My bad.
---
Yes I do have sound
---
I hope they have to walk across an entire floor of d4 dice in the dark.
---
Hey u unsuspended? Im not yet
---
I think they are doing it in tiers. Myself and a mate who got suspended at the same time both got our email stating we were unsuspended at the same time. What date did you get your suspension email?
---
No ..if I remember right...it did do that in 4.
---
I believe it was that way in Fallout 4. I don’t think I’ve ever received a legendary weapon of value from the SBQ. I’ve also got consistent garbage from encryptid.
---
i agree.. good idea, bad execution.
---
Hey, is our dutty!
---
Good gawd.
---
What were you hoping for?
---
No excuse please, you can clean up all your rad if you really want to get ore
---
I just got it. Imo its pretty sweet
---
Guess I’ll just claim my 5 scrip in the morning lmao
---
barely
---
wait... is this applicable for levels under 50 still and on Steam?
---
Yeah uhh FBI, this comment right here.
---
What weapon is the staff and fakkel skin for?
---
And do no damage. Which results in not being able to defend the 4 people
---
I’m not near my console rn that’s why
---
Nifty idea! That sure would save alot of time too. This is probably overthinking it but it would be great if the gift boxes were level locked. Meaning you can craft them for certain levels and folks with higher level couldn't take it/make use of it. 
---
I'm just thinking of all those 200+ player that love to grab my low level legendaries and gear I save and craft for new players from my vendor or when I drop a loot bag in public.
---
Thank you so much for doing this!
---
Country roads, take me home...TO THE PLACE I BELONG!!!!
---
The caps and scrap/repair kits were pretty pointless tbh
---
I want to know that as well.... and if the chicken coop comes with chickens!? 🤩
---
If the board wasn't space themed I wouldn't have even known it was supposed to be a space themed event
---
Eating or drinking has worked 100%for me.
---
I hear ya there 👿
---
Oi Diamond I found my pack in ash heap on the boarding platform exit of Welch station. Those raiders didn’t know what hit em’ 😐-ward’s hired hitman soldier 097
---
Oh my God yes this is the best explanation!  😂
---
This is why you're fucking bored and burnt out... Jesus christ...
---
Mostly by exploiting the games flaws and multiple accounts. Find friends that are willing mule materials items and currency etc etc. Its not a secret. Some openly admit it and will even show how it's done. Others try to avoid the topic. It sucks when people deny it though, it raises false expectations.
---
It was 7/14 but that can't be the case though because my friend got suspended at the same time as me and he got unsuspended yesterday.
---
I can't wait for it just so I can get rid of all the cards I don't have a use for
---
I got it on 14th still not back
---
I would buy .45 at 1 cap each
---
And  I know a lot of other ppl would buy them too
---
Get the Blue Captain Cosmos Suit from the Season and you can look like that one Ghost Astronaut bad guy from Scooby Doo.
---
So did you just now get unsuspended?
---
This genuinely made my day
---
Get it!!
---
The smart way, took me a few minutes
---
This is why faster fire rate has overtaken explosive guns, explosive legendaries are good at tagging groups, but faster fire rate is an immensely larger dps!
---
Insurgent outfit, full marine armor set, ritual bindings, silver shadow outfit...
---
Got mine at the boy scout cabins near white springs, dont remember its name. Try server hopping a few times perhaps.
---
Ahhhhh explosive bait.... I remember hearing something about that..
---
That's not really solo. That just eating half the cake and leaving the rest to spoil.
---
I hadn't seen anything from this video
---
Hold on... how did you use 35 Stimpaks?  Are you saying he was downed 35 times?  You don't need to mash the Stimpak button.
---
1st offense on this account. My alt account was perma banned on the 3rd day of the witch hunt.
---
Flatwoods
---
Cunts, the lot of them 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
That, and it's also a nice spontaneous challenge sometimes.  Drop everything I'm doing, this guy is surrounded by glowing Ghouls, I have to reach him!
---
That seems like a nice shotgun skin they are holding!
---
Any farm should work - razor grain, tato, carrots, et al, as does all the glowing fungi around the wayward.
---
By the Wayward, along the creek.  or the river on the west wide, run north from the food processing plant.   Just about anywhere besides the ash heap.
---
Omg a RvB reference!
---
Honestly this would be hilarious for NW, keep people from looting your body out of spite
---
That doesn't mean anything
---
I believe one Redditor once described it as the "How do six guys in Power Armor fail to save a single scavenger?" phenomenon.
---
And it's real, and every bit as puzzling as you'd expect.
---
That’s exactly what it’s gonna do. Regular builds will struggle. Bloodied builds don’t care for level scaling yet. They will if bloodied gets nerfed.
---
The sad part is the fact that the toilet in this place looks like someone dropped a mininuke in it.... we really need a clean restroom set.
---
https://i.imgur.com/2wGV4ls.jpg Very poorly photoshopped. lol
---
Just go to the wayward and follow the river
---
Do you think they will bring atom rewards back between each of the seasons?
---
Pretty much any place with farm or homestead in the name of the location.
---
Seriously, how hard is it to share :p
---
The rollover concept for dailies is a good idea.
---
I will improve it because i hate the 2nd floor
---
AFIK, paint plans are only from the forbidden knowledge quest.
---
Many other plans can be bought from the BoS vendor inside Whitespings resort.
---
Some of us only have an hour or so to play.
---
Bloodied here.
---
You can go down there just fine with something like the Chinese Stealth Suit, or Power Armor if you must.
---
Pure laziness.  No excuses.
---
I’m inclined to agree. Oh well, not our problem😌
---
Just so murmugh can dash your hopes a second time around lol
---
Honestly it’s probably because a ghillie suit was a pretty highly requested item back before they released the initial one, so they just went “eh fuck it” and added more.
---
Also I guess it’s an option for people who want to roleplay as more stealthy characters but don’t have a Chinese Stealth Suit yet.
---
Wendigo Cave.
---
thanks man!!!
---
legos or D4 works for me
---
Cool advise..I do the opposite, I take them to see if I can get players like you to come knocking. (But I passed lvl 20-40 many, many moons ago.)
---
I got a set of metal ones if you need to borrow them.... for science reasons.....
---
I feel like at this point the legendary perk card system is just a way to see how thoroughly brainwashed they have us. It's like you know how our level progression system is really stupid because weapons and armor  level cap at level 50 but yet you can be level 700. Let's make that even more stupid.
---
Just WOW! Normally my favorite camps are immersive and thematic but this is just So Well Done!
---
If you're on PC I'd love to do a walkthrough...
---
What even are they? I know caps are 30,000 but idk about scrip
---
That would thanks
---
that statement makes me think you didn't step on one but you did...
---
1000
---
Your camp, picking stuff in your camp completes the challenge.
---
Wendigo caves then the caves just north where deathclaw spawns inside. And actually rusty pick where Murphy is has a good bunch upstairs and downstairs.
---
Oh that's garbage
---
Yeah we have the clean sink so why not the rest eh
---
BUNKER
---
Thanks. Yes on PC IGN: LoganRTX
---
Wow I am so gonna try that next time...I want someone to find my insane hut when they r running from the fire...
---
Looks to me like the next Season/Legendary Run will be Warlock-themed.
---
1k scrip, 5k gold bullion there's a Max on everything in the game.
---
I take it, for you to have put that much time into it so far, you 1. learned a lot about the game, and 2., was creative enough to think of different things along the way to keep you busy/entertained. Hat's off to what you have been able to do, but conceptually, the MMO genre is a perpetual unfinished project. There is always something else to do. But if you aren't getting the curiosity from learning of new things to do in the game, then of course anything will seem boring. If you are bored, it'll be less motivating figure out what creative things to do next...
---
The end game for this game I think is much more subtle than other MMOs. I mean, as already mentioned, working on camp related things, setting up better vending machines, doing a certain theme, and being a completionist and doing the world challenges and the boy scout shit, yeah. There is that, which you said isn't exactly in your best interests r.n.
---
Currently doing magazine runs in between other higher priority grinds/farms.
---
Well, it's a silly approach if you actually fail the event.
---
The fact is, you only need something like 20 ore to complete it and walk away with the Treasury Notes, and that's, like, only clearing two of the four chambers.  If you can't find a way to do that in 10 minutes, that's kind of sad.
---
Not to mention, you aren't going to get the higher XP creatures like Deathclaws to show up if no one puts ore in.
---
The best approach is to gather up the ore you can first thing, and then just run the clock, periodically putting some ore in to temporarily cause the higher XP creatures to show up.
---
It reminds me of the house from Beetlejuice after Delia gives it a makeover
---
Not good enough - they should stub their pinky on some sharp-edged furniture. Every day.
---
Really gotten worse with daily "kill 3 legendaries"
---
I personally believe projectile weapons like missile launcher and fat man should not have a damage drop off. Making an Instigsting Missile Launcher OP for mobs.
---
Excellent! My IGN is same as reddit: foxinsox555   I'll look for you next time I'm on!
---
The problem with raising the cap limit is, that an inflation is going to exist. When people are able to have more caps, the owners of vendors will increase the prices of the products their selling. And then the increase of the cap limit was useless
---
Ya even the ss guass shotgun skin doesnt work but the camp one does? Its gotta be glitched.
---
I've never been suspended
---
my "barely" was in response to your 'barely had any weapons'
---
it does lol
---
Almost every Lego piece becomes a D4 if you hit it at the right angle.
---
i’ll bring the picket signs, let’s turn this into a rally 😂
---
&gt;With double exp you could get 1,5k exp for killing a single enemy
---
With all my buff active I was getting almost 1k per max level support mutant, 2.5k per sentry bot, 3-4k for scorchbeasts, and up to 6k for events (which is the max).
---
They were worth something when they only dropped during Holiday Scorched event because it was a one time thing i missed. But since Treasure Miners event the value went to close to 0. Im only missing 1 mount and its the one not in game, Mirelurk Queen Claw. Sheepsquatch Head is awesome though!
---
I'm halfway and I only like two items. Fuck the seasons, just give me back my dailies and weeklies and then just add more cool stuff to the atom shop like people have been asking for since forever.
---
Oh.. well I did though. My friend had loads of legacy's and I only had a Be15 plasma on my account.
---
We were both suspended at the same time and it was lifted at the same time which is what leads me to believe there is some kind of tier system. Maybe I am wrong though
---
Where are the locations?
---
I know the file cabinet and the urinal, but not the other two?
---
You forgot "And then spawn me in the middle of the Nuke Zone, because that's a thing."
---
THIS! Had a guy give me a heads up in an event last night, promptly gave him the thumbs up!
---
Yeah, I know... and low damage weapons are so hard to find in this game.
---
The river that runs through Flatwoods
---
This would be amazing!
---
Yeah I hope so.. I'm just questioning the whole thing..
---
I promise that if I was a duper I'm not dumb enough to advertise my inventories here.  I had no copies of anything.   Every weapon was singular.   Almost every single weapon came from a player vendor or an in game trade.  I hesitate to say every single one but it might have been.  Rng has never been kind to me in this game.  
---
I farmed caps clear back with civil war hats then moved to carnivore serums after the nerf. My computer was barely able to run the game so most of my time was spent farming vendors for anything that I knew to be in demand so I could pry trade only items away from people in trades.  Had some lucky purveyor purchases too.  
---
I have never duped mostly because of the fear of being banned.  Losing all that inventory is almost as hard a pill to swallow.
---
Wonder if this works for heavy weapons like the gatling plasma
---
The easiest thing would be to keep the season up for eveyone until they finished it.  Don't have a deadline that it needs to be completed by.   If someone can't play as often as some of us because they do more things in the real world, let them complete it on their own pace.   I have played plenty of games with reward tracks that don't have a deadline and things worked out fine.
---
Dam im barely in rank 25 due to me working during the day and i barely have time during the afternoon or night.
---
I don't think a limit on the amount anyone can have of anything is a good idea to control inflation, imagine a government setting a cap on the money a citizen can have
---
Just speculation, but since there were a lot of suspensions, I assume they’ll be doing it in waves. 
---
I know of many people I have played with who were suspended and some are back and some aren’t. I only know of one with a perma ban. As long as you haven’t gotten a perma ban, I assume you’ll more than likely be unsuspended with time. Best of luck.
---
You have to find it in world
---
Can’t wait to roleplay as nipple-man
---
Which one are you talking about? The camp one works for me I’m not sure of any others.
---
Enough to eat up your entire budget.
---
Losing the negative affects breaks the immersion honestly.
---
Same. Didn't find one as quickly but didn't take long at all.
---
The fact is the majority of people posting here don't read this sub, example being post after post about the same subject even though it was answered literally a couple of posts previous. They also lack the ability to use Google, if they had used it they would have found the answer to their question way quicker than it took them to post on here.
---
I'm not sure but the sheepsquatch seems to have a minimal damage threshold, too. It could also have been lag, but I pumped some shots into one at the end of the herding event before it got one-shot and the corpse got nothing for me.
---
I've been hearing the sonic emmiter from that event outside of Fort Defiance for days now even when I'm at my camp in the forest and stuff
---
This was unexpected.  Thank you for making me chortle out loud.
---
Yeah but you need to balance the economy at the same time. Dont you think we could all use a nice 50,000 cap on max caps and maybe keep a 30,000 cap on vendor sales? Or something like that. I think just opening up the max a little bit would yes create a little bit
---
We got a wizard outfit coming to the atomic shop that will be as close as we get
---
Yeah that's what I am hoping for right now, but no I definitely did not get any permanent emails. So I know that I am good. The wave idea is the only idea that would make sense.
---
OP said these items are ATX labeled meaning these are only Atomic Shop Items. Seasons items are labeled SCORE accordingly.
---
I believe they tell you if your CAMP (or your character) spawns inside a Nuke Zone, but I'm fairly confident there's no safeguard for a nuke that just so happened to land at the same moment you appeared (or even within those three minutes of countdown).
---
Part of the problem is that the server doesn't even tell the client about nuke zone placement until well after they've loaded into the world.
---
I always assumed that if you CAMP'ed at Whitesprings, this came with the territory, unfortunately.
---
No, that 'downed' noise is actually for your own character dying. It is just about 1 minute too early....
---
At least, that is the way it is for me...
---
If I'm not remembering a parallel galaxy; Fallout 4 only had prefix legendaries. No 3 stars in the game, just 1.
---
Using PerkLoadoutMAnager?
---
I think so yes because I’m pretty sure Bethesda just tracks who has a duped item which is really stupid and unfair so I’d hold off on buying vendor items for a bit but take what I said with a grain of salt
---
Bro I just pull out my shogun and hip fire to all the enemies before my FPS takes a massive shit. Leveled up 10 times in a couple hours doing that
---
Unfortunately, even though I love my gun, Lever Action is the better choice. We really need a high powered .50 Cal Rifle like the Anti Material Rifle in game, but it would be worthless because of the RoF. It would basically be a fast BP Rifle.
---
Trading and buying from other players is part of the game, if they start banning people for owning the odd item that maybe was duped they may as well call it a day and shut down the servers.
---
if cap limits get higher then prices get higher
---
Absolutely spot on. I immediately recognized that we'd be getting less atoms and that pretty much soured the whole thing.... Sorry but jerking me around isn't gonna do anything for me after being kicked in the balls. Thank you Bethesda for ruining the one good thing I had in 2020. May they rot in hell.
---
Thanks.  Rub it in.  I've been trying for a gauss rifle for weeks and nothing.
---
I've been rocking the BOS bomber jacket with my glowing skull mask.
---
Idk what your talking about someone bought 16k 5mm ammo from me yesterday for 1 cap each. Selling all ammo for 1 cap is how I am at the limit so often
---
That's why the are lifting the bans...
---
I think it's proven that the 25% ffr doesn't work with the Gauss rifle. If only this was any other rifle.
---
I did that today in uranium fever and got stuck in the emote and missed out on the legendary.
---
Fantastic idea!
---
Also: They should increase the amount of time it takes for the Food/Water bars to decrease. Make it similar to Fallout 4. That's the only problem i have with the bar system.
---
That depends on how pissed we get
---
Everything is bigger in the wasteland.
---
I’m sure it’s a risk, how ever small, I’d bet 90% of the top weapons/armour I have were, and I haven’t lost an thing or been banned, and no you can’t tell if it has or not but I’d say the chances are if it’s a bloodied quad or junkies
---
Its because they're in PA using a melee weapon and still can't one shot the ghouls. Theyre basically useless toddlers with a learning disorder.
---
There was a bug that started pretty much exactly a year ago where if you were in the forest or toxic valley and a mole rat or Brahmin farted, Graftons mayor would start telling you about the curator at pricketts fort.  You could complete the daily to shut him up and then it would start again the very next day.
---
Got patched eventually but kinda sounding like it's back.....with more than one quest giver now.  Quality stuff!
---
Tbh sometimes I forget I'm using my explosive shotgun and I feel awful afterwards.
---
Yeah, that would be because they switched the already done content to the legendary run. I'd also fully expect them to recycle them for NW later.
---
That's smart I'm gonna do that,
---
Are you also counting the cool items that actually turned out to be shit?
---
No.
---
I always revive incapacitated players, until I get my challenge done..Just kidding tho. I like reviving people, but most of the time I'm too late, because they use call for help too late or someone else revives them or they give up almost as soon as you get there. but sometimes I get a little gratitude.
---
Top 10 things only year one players remember...
---
How do you get a glowing one?
---
Just go to his main page, then click the tab for "COMMUNITY".  He put a small note in there that simply reads "I have access to my 76 account again.﻿"
---
I'm not sure how you started it, but I'm pretty sure I stole someone else's thief item. Because I killed and looted a target that wasn't mine and, since then, I've had the same "issue"
---
Well the SS helmet has three stats underwater breathing, protection from airborne disease, and a flash light.
---
Scrip for sure bc you only get 150 a day already limiting you.
---
 caps however is not necessary. As the other comments say inflation is going to happen and all it takes is a small group of greedy people. For instance, take a perfect roll weapon. People will try to sell it for like 50k across 2 characters. But as thats a sketchy deal, more than likely people will sell them for 30k aka the limit. If the limit is bumped to infinite, you add a class system that changes the dynamic of the game. Also making it useless to sell/search vending machines.
---
Wow, good job on that one Bethesda....classic.
---
this post is what you would call a ***meme***
---
Which is why it is also sad we just can't use any armour skin for what ever armour. Who cares if my combat armour looks like wood?
---
 King Grognak is the best currently imo.
---
Fire rate is wasted on a gauss rifle
---
You are welcome. Hope you get better loot than the shitty one star pitchforks I get.
---
It's a Nuclear Winter reward.  It was available during Halloween last year, but they're available now until it's fixed in the next patch.  It comes with a glowing skeleton suit as well.
---
Yeah wasnt that supposed to have happened?
---
It’s not worth 15k. I never said it was. 
---
Was it in the player’s vending machine listed at 15k?
---
Is there a new data mine?
---
Finally someone else gets it!
---
Yes this 100%. It loses the 'Survival Lite' feeling. Nobody wants the negative effects because that defeats the purpose of surviving/Water Purifiers etc. 
---
I and many others just want Bethesda to increase the amount of time it takes for the bar to decrease. That's literally the easiest/best solution all around.
---
You mean the godawful dogshit system they devised that will punish everyone that respecced or likes to have diverse builds? Yeah I think we're all aware by now that Bethesda sucks at game design.
---
I think so, I saw it earlier today
---
I think most people just put up with this bullshit because it's fallout....Can you heist an IP? Is anyone crazy or foolish enough to try?
---
This just hit me for the first time today. On double score weekend. While I’m at rank 86.... it hurt. A lot.
---
Maybe that’s what happened to me as well.  I don’t know, but I’m not giving it up now!!
---
No post i thought you said
---
He only had himself to blame
---
I heard eating a mushroom and turning 720 degrees does the trick.
---
Cool thanks ill look for it.
---
I dont see a purpose other than aesthetic. Generally your hand is held wherever you go so it wouldnt be useful.
---
JFRM, for reals. You can wait out the end of the event dying no respawn fuck over. Takes about 5 mins, but you'll get to loot the bodies of the vanquished
---
Are you okay?  Your comments seem extremely disjointed. 
---
Was the item in a player vending machine?  Yes or no?
---
Sugar is needed for Cranberry Relish (+20% Xp with carnivore mutation)
---
And Reed is used to create disease cure forest (firecap+Reed+bloodleaf)
---
You're welcome, though I don't do it during Radiation Rumble.
---
Vault boy 2000 or what ever he’s called, mr. Pebbles (that astronaut cat),
---
I have that exact same weapon... lol
---
it's ironic how I always find them here and there and usually don't need them but here comes the daily challenge and not a single bobblehead xD I mean I know its probably because other players picked them up before me, but it happened on private server too. even in the spot where it always spawns there was none. thankfully there's that magic map we have.
---
What the fuck is a keto
---
I"m sorry ... why the fuck are we being expected to pay for more shit from fallout 4? Those junk walls are literally just from the base game of Fallout 4. Why are they showing up in the ATX shop and not for free.
---
Yeah but murder? I've heard drug running analogies and dupers being called scum of the earth. When in most cases it's more like stealing from the rich to give to the poor. It's a poor analogy and certainly not simple.
---
It does. They don't leave the coop though.
---
I guess that would mean they still matched the enemy level... so both things are true? I just don't recall anything as annoying as fighting a three star and getting a one star rolling pin so I'm thinking you're probably right lol
---
heres hoping they keep the junk walls at 250atoms or less because as much as i wanted it again its kind of insulting to put a price tag on something they not only gave you as part of the base game for fallout 4, not only did they use it for fallout 4 world building but they also use it in 76 for world building and charging a full bundles worth or just a bigger price tag would just be insulting, and thats coming from someone who has had alot of fun building with the white walls, the veriety of wall papers and floors as well as the new fences, because as they are listed. NEW.
---
selling you something that was already pre-packaged with the base previous game as well as its successor that runs on the damn same engine would just be flipping the bird at our faces
---
&gt; We really need that I’m sorry emote.
---
This 10,000%
---
What are those 2 lights in the picture without a background?
---
You get a new server every time you log in. Each server can have 24 (ish, can't remember specifically but that's the ball park) players. You only see camps that have an active vending machine on the map, and you won't see players if they're crouched. The high level events are Scorched Earth, Project Paradise and Encryptid, but for the most part high level players hang out wherever they want, usually at theirs or a friend's camp. They farm areas in the Cranberry Bog, Mire and the Savage Divide.
---
I just use the vats unknown on the enemy and then use the “follow me” emote.
---
That happend to me once and I felt bad because I thought everyone hit it and the legendary was a low lever so my shotgun just disintegrated him
---
I don't understand what you mean by recycling them for NW. Items earned in either game mode are typically able to be used in the other. For some reason the ghillie armors aren't selectable for use in NW. That could be an oversight, but there's no way for them to "recycle" them into NW. That isn't how the cosmetics work.
---
Lately Radiation Rumble has been pretty productive
---
Holding the start button and zooming out will give your 3rd person much more viewing room, fyi ☺️
---
Your horror story sounds so familiar lol.
---
I swear this happened last week, but instead it was right after the event ended and someone looted my flux and ultracite. 😭
---
As a brand new player (going on 2 weeks now), the rewards are very helpful for me. Caps and lunchboxes and such, very fun. Plus I love the cute CAMP items, like the Sheepsquatch plush and UFO playset. But I could see it being repetitive if you’re level 300 or something.
---
I’m 17 now but I unlocked it before that so it’s a level less than 17 but I can’t remember what I was specifically
---
It’s all about numbers. You got one duped weapon, great. You got 40,000 maybe you got a problem.....
---
Someone might be blocked you for hidden their location, so there's more than you thought.
---
In fact, you can always check how many people in your current world by "recent" tab of Social.
---
Sadly the VPN solution doesn't work for me I connected to germany and it doesn'0t work. Now I'm moving the game to my C drive
---
You lose your flux if you die. No one is stealing it.
---
copied from the falliut wiki:
---
On the first floor, inside the men's restroom, in a urinal.
---
In the western corner of the hydroponics room, inside one of the three refrigerators near the locker room.
---
In upstairs the office to the southeast of the back stairs, in a filing cabinet drawer on the ground, near an office desk fan.
---
In a dry section of the basement laboratory, near an empty filing cabinet, on the corner of the metal desk with the destroyed terminal.
---
Saw two level +300 players camp the "Captain" spawn in Riding Shotgun with explosive teslas and killed it instantly before anyone else in the event even saw it.
---
How can you be that thirsty for legendaries at that level when you've already got legacy teslas?
---
I wish the lego curse upon them as well.
---
Just imagine...there are people making a living producing this quality content
---
I've been dreaming of that. I'd build a love nest around that beautiful bed if only we had it.
---
TRhis is awesome. Thank you!
---
Thank you my son
---
Ah good deal.  This thread is kinda pointless then lol
---
I'm not crazy!!! I was wondering why my lvc was reloading waaaaay faster than my faster reload. This is awesome. Thank you! Guess I shouldn't have thrown all the mines to get rid of them....(they dumb....lol)
---
Very true, as all legendaries in FO4 were only 1 star, so was their loot.
---
But I agree with you, sbq should drop 3☆ loot since she's the endgame event/raidboss.
---
Bloodied here as well, I'm the only one with the nuts to take some initiative and put on a haz suit, overweight myself cause it replaces my armor, and go down to actually pick up some ore. 
---
The only times I have EVER beat the event is when I didn't do it to keep the npcs alive. Just sometimes I put a bit too much faith in whos up there to quit gathering the ore.
---
Well, they only have to make them available as rewards in NW, which will make them work in NW when you acquire them. After all, it's just a flag that says if a skin is usable in NW or not.
---
Honestly I just want more “wastelandesque” sets like the og shack set from fallout 4, or junk fences! I miss my junk fences. And don’t get me started on glowing bottles...
---
Sounds like something Virgil talked about ...and no wonder they get along with super mutants then.
---
24 other people per server? Damn. That is not much at all. Guess that’s why it feels so much like a single player game. 
---
So if I get on a new server each time I log in, then why haven’t I bumped into camps set up right next t to me. How do you form groups of friends if everyone just randomly ends up on different servers?
---
Rewards as in? Looting the queen or from the event itself. You have to make sure you join the event because some instances you’ll fast travel and it won’t register you are doing the event so you won’t get any of the event rewards for killing her. When that happens I’ll just go to the map and click on the join event from there. 
---
You have to put a minimum amount of damage on her too otherwise you’ll get nothing.
---
Hmmm you know what now that I think about it....maybe the screen was telling me I had 35 stimpacks in my inventory instead of saying it would cost me 35 stimpacks to res him lol. Geez!  Sorry, noob moment here.
---
You know what would actually be cool? A ghillie style FO 1st tent skin.
---
I agree that granting the player with perk coins instead of having to scrap perk cards would have been better.
---
Take into consideration that you can also buy 1 lvl for 150 atoms. That helps too
---
you should try low level pvp again.  it's a lot of fun and a lot easier to get fights going.  people are a lot more likely to stick around and fight a lvl 30 than a lvl 300.
---
The secret service guass shotgun  paint doesnt work  in nw. But the camo one u get from the nw challengesbjust before the gillie suit does work.
---
I'd love that, but both companions are bad for romance. Sophia's just trolling me, taking my chemistry station right when I make my way towards it. And Beckett is just.. Beckett. We have a relationship but he keeps calling me "friend". I'd launch Sophia back into space it I could and have a nice cozy cage for Beckett
---
The only good thing about the ghillie songs is that they're the only skins available for things like robot and marine. Since you can't favorite things the only way to prevent accidentally scripping or selling them is to skin them. Plus it keeps them from showing up in the face menu so randos don't twist the good pieces that you're wearing.
---
I would prefer more ways to spend caps to keeping more. Smiley was a start, but 6k caps/week is nothing at that point.
---
It's a strange phenomenon but I call it the "people double my level and playtime performing worse than Jimmy2002 fighting his heart out with a pipe pistol" phenomenon. Power armor works too considering how often I see that as well.
---
It's not fantasy, it's reality! I can walk and play a guitar at the same time! PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DOING IT SINCE CAVE-TIMES, YOU PLEBE. NOW I SHALL UPVOTE YOU FOR YOUR PASSIONATE RESPONSE!
---
Srry it was type in my first comment camo paint for the guass shotgun
---
ITS FREE DAMN IT! STOP YOUR BLOODY WHINING!!!
---
I'm a bloodied build as well, I won't pull your ear for not doing it, but I'm really not sure what to say when even I as a bloodied build end up being the only one doing the objective.
---
At the very least I'm mad at people who can't even defend the damn survivors while I'm betraying my build to spawn high reward monsters.
---
Cool, Thanks. I think I'm level 12 or so. I should be able to get it before the update.
---
Winner winner mutt chops dinner...
---
I always go as high damage as possible, but our thought processes may be different because I'm a bloodied rifleman.
---
I would prioritize damage over weight
---
When does the season end btw?
---
Lol, I wasn’t able to turn in any legendaries for scrip today.... apparently it had already reached its limit before I could even turn one in..
---
Nice get em
---
Fuccccccck!! Where can I find one easy on the pravite servwr
---
I'm talking about the Quest itself, I do damage to the queen allowing me to loot her but when the quest itself completes I do not get Flux, Repair kits, Caps, or Exp from completing the "Scorched Earth" Event quest.
---
IMHO, I'm afraid they're gone for good.
---
Different studios one is bethesda softworks the other is bethesda austin
---
Your radar has to look like an entire continual splotch.....
---
Glow in the Dark Skeleton Mask + King Grognak outfit
---
True. I have a lot of weight reduction perks already but in my mind more ammo=more damage since a gun with no ammo does nothing. Hence why I’m on the fence.
---
But the armor was already made. I’m just wondering why they removed features from it.
---
Yeah. Kind of a pisser. Feels like a place holder power armor. Not bad, just a bit pointless. Especially since they where pretty imaginative with Strangler Heart, and then went a bit off the hook with the Secret Service regular armor.  Unless they rebalance the game and get rid of the armor diminishing returns, which I could see them doing. Then the 65 would be pretty sweet.
---
Mutually exclusive... scrap kits are legendary run rewards,
---
Normally I agree but that's kind of a tough call when going with explosives which I don't really have any experience with myself.  Seems like having a lot more 40mm would trump 5 percent damage when dealing with AOE.
---
aLL riSe iS a gOoD wEaPoN
---
Lol that's a good point, but that's why you plan and resupply at your camp. A gun will never run out if you're prepared
---
Omg thank you thank you
---
Now can we please just get a plain (non green-painted) Chinese assault rifle skin like the one that’s been present in the games files forever? I really want my gun to look like it did in FO3
---
I think I leveled up twice during a single event due to the 2xp weekend.
---
As always it depends. W/o you telling us the prefixes, no one can answer you.
---
Yeah you gotta make sure that you don’t just travel to her but join the event. If you do just travel sometimes it won’t register. And you won’t get any loot, so when I travel to the queen or to that building everyone travels too that sits just outside the nukes zone. I go to my map and hit join event. Another way of know is if the kill the queen is up on your quest log while you are fighting her
---
Maybe, I have no experience with real explosive weapons either
---
True. And with all my other ammo being super light I maybe able to afford some heavier explosives. Hmmm. You maybe right. Even 5% damage may make a difference.
---
Yes. Some legendaries can go for 30+k caps plus multiple legendaries just for that single one.
---
Most first season passes I joined up on were kinda shitty and started to get better. Oh well it's not like we paid for it.
---
Depends on weapon
---
No the armor was made for creation club if they reused the assets it cost them royalties since the model was made by a third party.
---
4. best rewards
---
Well here's the thing, you can use the ugly Fallout 1st paint that basically paints a target on your team's back but armor earned through a season? Nah!
---
If your camp is in a popular spot, you wont always be able to place it.
---
And public teams are great for teaming up, I’ve had all good experiences with public teams.
---
Yeah. Don’t even need to sever hop. Just keep clicking on the dirt pile until you run out of treasure maps
---
yes
---
That's what I think honestly, you can always get adrenal for a extra few points every now and then when you're low on health, if you where to stack that couples with a few perks that 5% goes up fast
---
Need to do at least 1000 damage
---
We need some standard color skins for regular armor. I'd love to put my Scout/SS armor in a flat black/gray
---
some people do slap ludicrous prices on a weapon just because it's bloodied or junkies. 
---
 [https://fed76.info/pricing/](https://fed76.info/pricing/)  can give you a rough idea on the value of something
---
That’s what I meant it was already made. That’s what I was thinking. So basically it’s a bootleg captain cosmos power armor lol. That sucks haha
---
“this is my art, and it is DANGEROUS!”
---
Many god rolls are worth more than caps can buy.
---
For real though:
---
Drop healing factor
---
Don’t drink or eat and then try to FT
---
Don’t wear regen gear
---
These have worked wonders for me, though I miss healing factor a lot
---
I see alot of new players asking this. Some do, it just depends on the stats. I've sold 3 star bloody weapons for 23k caps before. I currently use a bloody fixer with explosive. According to Fed76s recent update it's worth 40k caps, which makes it a high value trade only item. Some weapons are worth jack crap and only good for scrip.
---
I've only recently started doing NW because I'm not a big PvP fan but I want to lvl in legendary run too. I'm on pc and I don't know the game's mechanics that well to say "oh that player is cheating!".  Mostly because the spectator mode is annoying and only 3d person view. But can you actually hit other players while being inside the vault? I once got "abused" by 5 people hitting me while I was calmly sitting on a bench. It sounded like they actually hit my character, but when I tried to hit them back nothing happens, it's like the first goes through them. Also when you chose a position on the map, your previous action cycles itself (as far as I understand), can someone use that to hit you after you're already out or the vault? knowing what some people do I expect nothing good from anyone.
---
Yeah they track it, then they suspend you for a week and unban you lol
---
True and since I have grounded (and use a Gatling Plasma) that total 60% would help offset the 12% reduction (max class freak) more so then 55%
---
Its news to me!
---
Organ Cave sounds like a secret lair for Krieg from Borderlands 2 💀
---
I'd rather have an inconspicuous cardboard box that moves around
---
Basically. This is also why so much stuff looks reused from 4 with some extra paint added
---
While I agree with all your points there's one terribly wrong: Never, I repeat, NEVER point out to them any of their bugs could lead to "people feeling pressured into spending money"! That's the keyaction that Bethesda CEO's get orgasms on reading in the forums because "spending money" is what they want and could give them the notion to let this bug keep going in hopes of people actually being pushed to spend money that they wouldn't otherwise.
---
Rather phrase it to make them scared that people WON'T spend money if they don't fix it.
---
Your camp disappears when you leave the server. Only up to 24 people on any server at a time. 10s of thousands of players are on at any given time but you will only see your server. 
---
The map is pretty massive. Have you tried actually walking across it?
---
They're gone. That's part of the point.
---
That makes sense. I wish they added something to it that still looks nice rather than nothing
---
This makes me feel limited in everyway, i can't save anything for future plans, i planned on getting all gold for SS armor then buy it, now with 5k limit i can't
---
Had this happen to me as well. No idea why.
---
The cap limit use to bother me but honestly I don’t really see the need to ever have 30k caps. 
---
Usually when I hit 20k I’ll do a vendor run and spend a good chunk of it. Rinse and repeat. The scrip would be nice if it was higher than 1000 though.
---
The lower the limits the better the chance you come back the next day and the next day to keep adding more.  And the more you come back the more you play. And the more you play the more likely you are to buy Atoms.  Classic MTX strategy.
---
Caps are already worthless and on bigger trades between players, caps are pretty much forgone as tender.  The few trades that do require them already require an obscene amount which shows you just how worthless they are.  There's basically no major reason to spend caps on things other than some blueprints and recipes so the whole inflation argument that they're going to become worthless tends to fall flat on its face when you realize how little use there is for caps in the first place. 
---
On top of that, I'm willing to bet very few people are actually regularly selling every day to get the daily limit of caps to the point that even if you were to raise the cap, you wouldn't have that much of an increase in caps being brought in. That's also not considering the fact that people who do trade often bypass the cap by muling caps on multiple accounts, which is completely defeating the purpose of having a cap on currency when you can just mule and hoard more than the average person that way. 
---
The cap on bottlecaps serves no benefit to us, and if they were to completely remove it, there would be very little to lose from it.  In fact, it might even be better because then mulling to bypass a cap and requiring extra steps to trade larger denominations would no longer be an issue.  Limiting how much currency we can hold isn't what's going to make bottlecaps a desired currency to hold on to.  Giving players a reason to spend them, and having a fixed value on certain items will. The game needs cap sinks, and ways to spend things on items players actually want, such as a cap-to-scrip conversion for example.
---
Once I reached Ally status with Foundation, the item got locked to my inventory. It's a quick daily done every day I log in, just wish it would've happened sooner.
---
Yepp! That's sounds like a solid plan my man. Idk what prefix you're running but if you went bloodied you'd be pushing out hundreds
---
High levels will sometimes drop one star legendaries since they weigh too much. The mini gun is a prime example. I've dropped a one star which weighs 20 in line of the sand before and while people check it out I've had no one pick it up. No one wants that liability.
---
used to mix it with Tang in college and call it Vang lmao
---
I try to every time I can, though sometimes I miss and hit something else in the fumble. lol
---
Apparently my mythical 3 star dragon doesnt exist
---
This is what I do. I buy and sell ammo at 1 cap always. I think it evens out overall.
---
Thanks for the awesome advice! I’m running a Furious Gatling Plasma. No luck on a bloodied one. (I’m not a bloodied build but I’d use it if I get hit down to low hp. Just pull it out and use it to get away)
---
Tanagra town, about 40 acid per run.  Server hop.
---
The train yard near watoga, about 4 to 5 snallygasters
---
Cave Cricket and Yao Gai hordes
---
Campfire Tales:  each bludbug probiscus is 2x acid.  Best done with a team on a private server because you can run out the clock.  They nerfed the time limits though.  You used to be able to run it for 90+ minutes and come out with 900 acid.
---
Faschnact.  Farming beeswax I ended up with 12K acid across two characters.  But it's a once a year event.  
---
Hemlock holes (3x acid nodes) plus other workshops with acid nodes. I like to take the one down near Dent and Sons and the middle power station.  I also noticed that bogtown? (The one north of watoga) has an acid node and there are 2 to 3 snallys near the closest pylon.
---
Mid september.
---
Welp bad news, seems on twitter a lot of people are having their tickets closed under the notion that the ticket is "duplicated," when they reported this on twitter, the response was either "the case has been reviewed and a final determination was made" or "We'll send this ticket to someone to be reviewed as soon as possible." 
---
Just checked and my ticket was also closed due to "duplication of ticket" even though I was instructed to update my ticket from twitter customer support regarding attaching my documentation.
---

EDIT [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hx4vtm/tip_for_finding_a_bobblehead_for_the_daily_today/)
---
Hmm. I’ll have to check my numbers later. Maybe they snuck in an extra 25 score somewhere along the way
---
You’re welcome 👍🏾
---
Question, do bobblehead spawns respawn 24 hours after you find that exact bobblehead, or do they all respawn at the same time on a 24-hour cycle?
---
Do you know of any that arent in the atomic shop
---
This is why lvl sync update is needed so much to fix the drop system
---
Fed76 has a great pricing tool that can give you a ballpark of value (based on PC platform, but I find it still is useful for console) for any weapon or armor. But yes, honestly anything truly "decent" that is priced correctly (AKA someone familiar with market value in game) is probably going to cost you at least 5-10k. Anything that is remarkable or very good is likely to be a trade only, as caps are mostly worthless.  Think about it in terms of rarity. You can get 1400 caps per day easily, whereas a specific legendary weapon is much more difficult to come by. However, dont be afraid to message sellers and negotiate...a lot of people mark stuff up but are willing to let it go for less if someone just asks.
---
Still there can be times when someone will and just quickly turn it in for scrip. I personally have 3star bear arms so that minigun would be no problem.
---
Maybe we wouldn’t have so much income inequality.
---
Same. I got one daily, one time and that was it. None since. That was about 2 months ago
---
Exactly. I much more enjoy walking in for two seconds to turn in the quest and start the bullion 20 hour timer lol
---
Why don't you just buy the SS armor plans as you go. It makes more sense to buy each plan when you can afford it since you can then start crafting that piece right away. You need a legendary module to craft one and they cost 50 scrip each and you can only buy up to 10 a day so you should start the SS gold grind right away.
---
This works,
---
1. Drop your legacy weapons in the river
---
2. Bite down on your tongue,
---
3. while sticking a hot needle in your eye. 
---
4.  Gift a couple nuclear key cards to the player that just nuked the Queen two or three times in a row.
---
Tbh if you're already a PA user you might as well go bloodied if you can get your hands on it of course. I use mostly PA with my bloodied character. But furious is just as good honestly
---
It’s fun, bout doubt I’ll complete the legendary grind.  I don’t have enough time in my day
---
What he means is they were already made items planned for NW but instead of putting them in they used them for rewards for this. Maybe recycled isn’t the word but they shifted focus to the run instead of NW. mainly speaking that space doesn’t have any need for a ghillie but almost every battle royal has one. I’d imagine they didn’t have enough space items so they said “well fuck it use these, were already behind schedule” and you probably can’t use them in nw for balance issues or visibility or something of that nature

Well since they unbanned the dupers, and let them keep the duped items. 
---
It seems like you can do whatever you want. 
---
Cheat mode:on
---
I'm in the same situation. I think it's just a waiting game because one of my friends go suspended 3 days after I did, but got unsuspended yesterday. Let me know if you get any updates.
---
Wow, I commend you for your efforts. I guess it is possible, mind you with my time restraints a late I am kind of thinking I might not complete it. I am at level 40 on the board at this point, but with 2 days a week with less than 5hrs total from here on in, I think I might watch it pass. And hearing how crummy the rewards seem, it makes it seem not as fundamental at the end of the day! 
---
Nonetheless I congratulate you for your efforts, I appreciate the review of the cosmetics. 
---
I wish you, and everyone all the best!
---
Yeah or they using a slow Gatling gun, so half the ghouls just run past. And they don't watch the life bars to see when a NPC are been under attack.
---
Look for anti-armor or quad with faster fire rate and faster reload.   Also, Zealots is nice as well.   These, in my opinion, are undervalued as most focus on Junkies or Bloodied.
---
drifter outfit looks. Nice
---
That's a _hit ton of farming steel though. Lead is easy to get.
---
I’m only level 65 so I have time to play around with my builds. Thanks for the idea!
---
I hate when I fight a horde only to discover that the boss is somehow 3 zip codes away.
---
Okay I definitely will. You do the same.
---
Are you on PS4? I can give you an instigating lever for free if you want so you can still get the hunting rifle later
---
Does this method work for the consoles?
---
It is a horrible designed event but great exp farm
---
The best part is player LIKE YOU!!  If you care so much about completing the events then by all means go collect the ores 
---
don’t just come to /r/fo76 and spam/complaints about it , if you were collecting them then the event would be successful
---
That isn't how the NW rewards work, though. Nothing you can earn in NW is something you've already got for Adventure mode. If they did that for the ghillie armors, that would be a dramatic change to the rewards system.
---
Where can I find such bunker? As in which area?
---
I pick them up...  but I'm always looking for 1 and 2 star as fillers to round out my script for the day.  
---
Plus level 3 bear arms and 3x weapon weight reduction armour  means that they only weigh 2 or so carry weight.
---
Thanks for adding to the conversation.
---
Lmao damn dude
---
He meant to say it's a static spawn no way it's worth 15k but he did it in two lines/posts and so everyone is down voting the second part of his sentence and are  horribly confused.
---
Also if you’re on Xbox or PC there has been a massive increase in low level players because of gamepass, so a lot might be taking up a server spot without even owning a CAMP or vendor.
---
I mostly consider this game a single player game anyway as it punishes you so much for being in a group. The fact you need to get a hit on an enemy to get XP is pretty frustrating when I one hit things, Hard to share kills with friends.
---
You have to turn around at the end of the mile, rinse and repeat.
---
Honestly? I think this whole season was a really dumb start
---
No words, well maybe except for wow.
---
From my understanding, instead of removing the good/water bars in patch 21. They plan to change it so you get better buff for fulling then and no negative effects from ignoring them.
---
Pretty much, its a good starter weapon for those who dont have a good 2 handed, but aside from that, no its garbage
---
That isn't what he said or what he meant, and he's already clarified as to his intent. He was suggesting that they'd add ghillie armors to the rewards in NW at some point in the future so you could specifically wear them in NW, but the rewards system in NW doesn't work like that and it'd be a massive change to how it does work if they did so.
---
It’s a tf2 medic reference (may be misremembering)
---
Bloodied here too, same I just put me stealth suit on, even if I'm overweight I can still get enough ore to complete the event. When I'm on my weekend team with friend we can 100% it with 3 or 4 of us no problems.
---
Very nice
---
I sell my spare legendaries for 100 per star regardless of affixes, if it's a truly good weapon I'll give it to a friend who has a play style that suits it.
---
Yea now that I realized that captain cosmos power armor is dumbed down I’m not as excited about season now lol. That was my favorite power armor in fallout 4
---
I mean my 3 star chaser costs a crap ton. Also its legacy
