does anybody go and search for codes anymore when they want to launch nukes or No

But not if I‚Äôm on the server cause its my camp location. As been for the last 50 lvls haha

I fell in love with you, when you logged out Digi.  ‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíù
---
You got robots, mini nukes, vats. I mean yeah its fallout dude. Have you played it before you came up with this opinion?
---
There‚Äôs the door üëâüèª

 Hopefully this time, they actually advertise what they show.

Those are my prized armor pieces on my bloodied build- Unyielding acrobat legs.
---
Otherwise a 1 story drop would kill me.
---
Ok but like..YESSS
---
I revived some one at a Queen fight. They weren't my teammate, but I received credit anyway.
---
Yea cuz robots and bullet time has never been in a game before
---
Look at OPs screen name. Hes nutz.

You have to have some one watching your back AT ALL TIMES!

Hey, if you didn‚Äôt like the word choice, it wasn‚Äôt my word, I was reusing yours. You do you, man.

A trick to try regarding the strangler bloom is to go to the location ( Dyer chemical ) and log out and then log back in at that location. I did this and found some strangler blooms out.

These are the images of the skin in the Atom Shop. As you can see, the one on the right has a partial heat shield on the barrel, while the one on the left doesn't.

That's hilarious dude. If you don't read your original reply as pretty much nothing but insults, you have some pretty serious issues in the communications department.
---
It's fallout as a survival game.  Marketed as a survival game. With some rpg elements. How were people surprised when they bought this?
---
As for mods, I tried different receivers and barrels, to no avail.
---
What... makes a fallout game, in your opinion?
---
The meat hook also has an extra hook mod
---
Same issue on pc for me, whole roof is fine except for one piece, even taking apart everything else didnt help.
---
LolüòÇü§£
---
Ya def try that next time. Usually server hop but I hope your trick works. Ty
---
Well nice DISCUSSION everyone
---
Snap two foundation block to the one on the right, coming toward the camera.  Snap a stairway over the closest foundation to the camera (the second block you just placed), rising up away from the camera.  There should be two foundation width spaces between the top of the new stairs and that brick wall in your pic.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Place a square 2x2 "second floor" piece at the top of the stairs.  Then snap a stairway going down and to the left, with the bottom of the stairs touching the edge of those see-through 1x2 rectangle "second floor" pieces by that stairs that goes down into the grass.  The new stairs, foundations, and second floor piece should "support" everything while you delete those grass stairs and the half wall, then the farthest 1x2 floor, and that wooden 2x2 that's highlighted green in your pic.  Finally, take out the two 1x2 rectangles at the bottom of the new "down" stairs, and scrap/store the support scaffold that you built, in reverse order.
---
To be fair its currently as effective at stopping the plague as the real masks were
---
Could be useful in survival where fast travel is death. Even then if you know your area your prob not going to need it.
---
Also, half walls are buggy \*as hell\* this patch, but I've had more problems with them not wanting to be placed than I have with not being able to remove them.
---
Sometimes if you just go to tnt 7 you will find it open and the plan has respawned.
---
I love you, I was just thinking about trying to get them all.
---
It sounds like you forced a negative opinon into your own head and want it to spread to other people. Theres everything that makes fallout, fallout here. Sure its forced online and a weird map but its a different fallout experience thats still fallout. I feel dumber for replying to you.
---
So aside from the theme, mechanics, and humor.... your right. I guess if it‚Äôs not a single player game, it‚Äôs not fallout. 
---
Seriously, it‚Äôs been out for 7 months. Get over it already. If you want what you‚Äôve always had, that‚Äôs fine. Dust off the old copy of NV or FO4 and go to town.
---
None for those two
---
Yup.  All production has a set time on it.  Whether you give it 100 power or 10, the time is the same.
---
Also, since it seems no one else has mentioned this yet. Riflemen are basically snipers. So make sure you are sneaking for bonus damage (2x up to 3.5x with perks and a silenced weapon at night) as well as aiming for their weak spot (head on most humanoid enemies; varies on others) for usually 2x damage (sentry bot fusion cores I‚Äôm pretty sure are like 8x damage)
---
I have personally had either you or Valseek comment that you were passing bug/issues on to the devs but have yet to see the Issues Thread get updated with said concerns. There are a number of repeat posts made about things that should be updated on the list to let us know you all are aware. Please ask whomever is supposed to keep that thread updated that they add all the known issues and not just stuff that is being fixed soon.
---
so got another responce from them after i msged them again worried that the issue wasn't going to even be bothered with he said it was a known issue and gave me this link to show me it's being hopefully adressed
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/46454
---
it shows that the operation tidy not triggering is now concidered a known issue so i feel more hopeful
---
I'm not sure what I want more, NPCs or core game mechanics that actually work
---
Otherwise use a t60 chest and jet pack that
---
Not really. You using the words I used, incorrectly. I said my problem was collecting too much crap.  Not how I build my characters as you suggested.
---
Oh I‚Äôd love the huge Carmen SanDiego hat. That‚Äôd be perfect.
---
I met some player today named Fraggle_Rock. I fell in love when he logged out, I didn't even need to know anything more than his username.
---
Due to the game engine being the precise one used for Fallout 4, it doesn't matter if every point you've raised is correct. This product would be compared to FO4 at every point. It feels like they added multiplayer, realised it would take a monster powered PC to begin playing it that way, knocking out possible sales on consoles completely, so had to pare down dramatically the content. It's definitely not Fallout 5, which makes a lot of folk unhappy. 
---
Just wait for Obsidian's Outworld to show up, and see how much it gets compared to Fallout:New Vegas.
---
If you were insulted, it's because you're sensitive to what I said. You reacted that way because you read it as insulting. As I said before, I nor any other have to be nice to you when you choose to complain. You're the one opening up the discussuon and you didn't like the response. 
---
All I did originally is suggest better wieght management and attempt to figure out why you die frequently enough to be bothered by the bugs so that you can rectify it. You got butt hurt. You lashed out. Just like in the game, all your suffering is by your own choices. Quit blaming Bethesda and me. You dont have to play the way you do and no one force you to make a complaint post. Reap what you sew.
---
Take the name Fallout out of Fallout 2 and what do you have? Literally nothing that's in the previous games except the BoS, the Vaults and some mutants and...ohhhhh, right you've already asked us to remove those. Was Fallout 2 ever meant to be a Fallout game? Because no other game has isometric shooting and dialogue trees, amirite?
---
1) Mid level blues are real. We all hit this point in the game.   
---
2) Make sure to install a "Perforating" magazine on your Hunting Rifle (maximum armor penetration)  
---
2a) "non-automatic" still includes the semi-automatic versions of handmade, assault and combat rifles (which mostly still suck at your level, but ammo is plentiful, and it's better than an un-perked pistol when you have rifleman). For these, start with the "short" scope til you can get some better mods.   
---
3) Keep a fire axe hotkeyed for when the nasties get close. Melee perks not required. Still hits harder than most guns. (A hardened perforating combat shotgun is also useful for short range encounters)  
---
4) Are you using VATS or a scope? If VATS, use the "Long" scope for maximum accuracy, but if just aiming, you may find short or medium scopes are easier to hit with (wider field of view, less "bounce). If using VATS, make sure to get the perk "concentrated fire", which enables you to target specific body parts (mostly heads, but varies a bit from critter to critter). If not using VATS, aim for the head or legs manually. (you still get damage bonuses/crippling firing this way)   
---
5) Don't have power armor? GET SOME. Even if you aren't planning on using it "Long term", between L25-40 or so you may find that the increased damage resistance and surviving jumping off cliffs to be crucial. You can get wearable Raider PA at level 15... if you REALLY hate PA, find a friend to craft you some leveled Heavy Leather Armor.
---
I think it was always meant to be a fallout game, but always meant to be a multi player fallout game. Maybe they got too caught up on that and focused too much on things like daily challenges and the atomic shop and building huge servers that can handle multiplayer gameplay and they forgot what really made Fallout what is has been before.
---
I really miss the decision making that affects the outcome of gameplay, and I miss the human NPCs, and I almost miss the raiders actually.
---
That's it, just keep spouting the same, deluded, insane, garbage.
---
And lone wanderer. Thanks for the info. I appreciate it.
---
So, I've been checking vendors for a western revolver plan, but can't seem to find one.  Does anyone have any tips or know which vendor might sell it? Thanks.
---
Still a lot, theyre worth maybe 100 caps at most
---
Thanks for the info.
---
No! you want to kill high level Legendary enemies and be almost guaranteed Wood Armour. 
---
 Its a joke. Its in the Mire which is a bit out of your depth. I'd cruise player vendors myself.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it counts as long as you aren‚Äôt in conflict (PVP) with them.
---
They do - but there's a trick - put two bare poles stacked on top of them, then remove the lower one, then the platform snaps right in.
---
Lol
---
So what makes a Fallout game?
---
I get level 50 legendary wood armor (chameleon and weightless mostly), so I can say definitely it does not just drop at level 5.
---
Yep some people have
---
I run with 9pts in one handed, 3 in unarmed and use meathooks almost exclusively. IIRC I tested it and both sets together worked for upping damage.
---
Agreed. This handmade chart was well put together.
---
Wood armor and Military Fatigues are fucking good Aesthetic
---
Hand in tokens to purveyor 
---
80% chance for wood armor &lt;.&lt;
---
Do you use action boy to help with ap regen from dodgy?
---
I can confirm from experience yesterday the Flatwoods Monster spawned at the southern Whitespring checkpoint. Taking a picture of a dead Mythical Flatwoods Monster counted for both take a picture of an Alien and Flatwoods Monster. So, woot.
---
Well... it was useful to keep people from coughing in your face which is how the pneumonic plague spread. It's just that this usefulness was accidental. They thought sickness spread by miasma (through foul odors) and thus smelling perfumes and flowers would prevent infection.
---
 Get Chameleon Armour and disapear completely. ;)
---
Did you check at the cemetary down the hill from the huntersville fast travel spawn?
---
I tried this at level 270. Only more level 15s spawned.
---
Poison
---
I thought about moving there once upon a time! I settled into the lived in boxcar bunker near the sunken church for a while. I had built my base raised up into the power pylon there and it was magnificent.
---
So seeing as people just want to get angry and not actually think about what I said.. let me make it more of a conversation between two Bethesda employees... then maybe someone may actually read what I wrote
---
"Hey I've been working on this new hunting game running on the Fo4 engine and its alot of fun" 
---
"That's cool, what do you do in it? "
---
"Nothing, your just hunt and survive" 
---
"Well that sounds good, but how can we get people to get into a game that has no people, story, point, or any progression in the world?"
---
"Hmmm.. I dont know, I mean I can start adding some people and flush out a world"
---
"Yea, we dont want to wait for that.. can we just do something we already own?"
---
"I suppose.. I dont know how I can really do that, wasnt really planning on making a big deal out of this"
---
"Just make it into the Fallout universe"
---
"Well then I'd have add alot, factions, the vaults, lore, etc... That's a big undertaking"
---
"No it isnt.. just dont give it to them"
---
"Wait.. what.."
---
"I mean I guess we can add it later on if we have to"
---
not showin you as online for me
---
Poison resistance.
---
What platform and name dude
---
Why the hell would you want a swarm of glowing cave crickets nearer to your level?  What are you a sadist?!
---
I hear you.  I‚Äôve been playing solo on Fallout 76 since BETA, with a couple of organic multiplayer situations.  I love taking this game at my pace, soaking in the lore of the world and the excellent environmental storytelling.  I‚Äôm fine with these light multiplayer challenges because it‚Äôs been interesting to figure out how to complete them on my own terms.
---
Awesome, thanks for the update. I‚Äôve only ran into that thing twice in 200 hours of game play, but going to try and hunt one down this week.
---
He just regurgitates reddit. The guys garbage. He is a hate monger Aswell.

Way too many commas. 
---
Oxford Comma: a comma used after the penultimate item in a list of three or more items, before ‚Äòand‚Äô or ‚Äòor‚Äô¬†
---
 I max out my knives. I don't need Barbarian and Blocker is mostly useless if its dead already. ;)
---
 Still I only go Bloodied with my Auto Grenade Launcher as its just for laughs. The Sheepsquatch goes down pretty quick. ;)
---
Arent the paints dependent on the mods equipped?
---
That's what it looks like, could be wrong.
---
Still on?
---
It was never intended to be a Fallout game.. it was a 100% different game with TIES to the Fallout universe to help it sell
---
Then the meathook is grossly underpowered as an unarmed weapon compared to the deathclaw gauntlet by like 30%.
---
Your comment this late into this thread is something extra that's nice to have
---
I run 1 point in Action Boy, 1 Adrenaline, and 3 Dodgy. I have 2 pieces of unyielding armor with AP refresh to help out as well. Unless I'm in a queen battle I can kill things without power attacking, so it seems to work out OK.
---
For me lately, it's every time someone in PA runs by.
---
Ah the days of NV where you could do sweet melee moves and awesome unarmed attacks by moving the stick on attack. Made me really appreciate a melee build. I was hoping for something like this in the game or more finisher moves. And what happened to the finisher moves from Yao goi and deathclaw??! That scared the crap out of me every time!
---
The people who solve them for nuka crypt do, but I suspect everyone else just piggybacks off their efforts.
---
Yep, that was me the other day.  Completely overwhelmed.  I could barely see the campfire for all of the blinding poison effects, and eventually I couldn't reach the campfire because of all the bugs in the way.
---
I wish I knew. I've been waiting for somebody to keel over in a pond for weeks now.
---
-slow clap- a new level of pedantic low. Good job bud.
---
I think we fixed it. Now?
---
The project Paradise event spawns most of the photo requirements for many challenges.
---
And bugs and bugs and bugs and bugs and OH GOD ALL THE BUGS
---
Yup
---
Yeah I‚Äôve done this too and it was discouraging, not a single legendary spawned in. LOTS of adhesive for my trouble though. I wish I knew when and where to do this because every time I try not a single legendary has spawned.
---
I'm low leveled so only have a few cards. Thanks for the suggestion though!
---
It's is definitely the place for people not interested in the scouts as part of their wasteland experience.
---
Just take the L and go bro
---
The water can‚Äôt be too deep otherwise you don‚Äôt go into a downed state that you can be revived from.  Too shallow and it might not register.  There are areas all over where the water is Goldilocks tho, such as at Whitesprings golf course or the Flatwoods creek.
---
Okay I added you. IGN: rosesdotwav
---
Thanks! Already had help yesterday, but maybe I‚Äôll need help with today‚Äôs challenge
---
I don't remember, I think the gyro one that lowers recoil. Since it's quad I'm running it full auto
---
Let me guess, because it's a Bethesda Game, not BIS/Obsidian, it's also not a fallout game?
---
Which fallacy are you attempting to use?
---
No True Scotsman?
---
Opinion = Facts?
---
Appeal to Emotion?
---
No, I know...
---
This is the classic Jaffa Cake question!
---
Is it a cake or a biscuit?
---
It's exactly what it says on the tin, no more, no less.
---
I was unaware of that. Ok. Solves my problem then.
---
Feels like fallout to me. I think the no NPC argument is so overblown and fanaticized. They‚Äôre are not human NPCs because everyone is dead. Easy plot device? Sure, but it makes sense with their writing. West Virginia wasn‚Äôt directly hit so these little towns had a lot of people survive. Those that did survive were killed by raiders or wiped out by the scorched virus. They wanted to make a game where the only survivors were people out of the vault and specifically the only survivors were people playing the game, not NPCs. They wanted us to be the survivors. For us to build the world. I feel like people who can‚Äôt grasp the concept have no imagination. Role play. Make the game what you want. I make missions for myself and collect junk for my needs. I made a backstory that lines up for me. It‚Äôs a different kind of fallout game but it feels the same and better in some ways. FO4 was full of NPCs and you still had little choice in actual outcome. Idk man sick of the same points all the sadsacks post on Bethesda‚Äôs Facebook page every update they send out. If you (you as in the general ‚Äúyou‚Äù) don‚Äôt like; don‚Äôt play.
---
TSE blunderbuss with faster reload would probably be the most hilarious gun to use in the game. Only die like 80% of the time from splash damage
---
I believe its 150% at the moment.
---
Doing good work here. Thank you
---
Did you find anyone yet?
---
Honestly, you don‚Äôt even need too. I‚Äôd say the first ten levels in survival are actually easier because you do more damage. Once you pick up a hunting rifle it‚Äôs pretty easy.
---
Not sure how much you know about the series but it's not your typical fallout. I'm not talking about thr lack of the npcs or choices or story. 
---
I'm talking about hoarding. Although inventory space has increased you'll still not be able to be a collector. At least in the broadest sense. 
---
And that includes all the other cool items in the game. As of right now there is no way to display any "junk" items. There supposed to be something in the future but nothing right now.
---
You get rewards and XP for the team leader completing those quests. Just have them toggle off the ones you aren't doing, reap the rewards from the ones you are.
---
Oh damn didn‚Äôt know it was that crazy lol, thx man for your reply
---
I have this happen with rifles but my heavy weapons seem immune.
---
I tried this, except no one went down and we actually killed the sheepsquanch pretty quickly, so yay? I guess
---
Thank you
---
That is correct. Different mods apply different paints.
---
Nope!
---
You‚Äôre welcome üòä
---
This right here.
---
Come to me.
---
I'm at a spot with water. IGN: Tomgato
---
Just figured it out thanks for the help!
---
Directly south of vault 76 is a lumber mill
---
Shit loads there, plus the robots hand it out for free if you speak to them
---
You can't find it because it doesn't exist.
---
Okay I'll join you. One moment!
---
Wood armor and underwear is better. Than go into character creator and add dirt to your face.
---
It's a perk in percentage gives ~30% armor pen at rank 3.
---
Just go to Helvetica and the place to the east of the Sons of Dane compound. You‚Äôll have more wood than you know what to do with.
---
It‚Äôs not bugged if you literally have to get the final shot in killing her or whatever it has listed. The challenge just needs to be more clear. 
---
Example; when the dailies roll around for ‚Äúkill a sheepsquatch‚Äù you have to be the final hit and many people know that. Same for the challenge the op listed. Not a bug.
---
This, along with Tank Killer. You're in one of the tougher areas in the game.
---
If I were you, I'd go back and discover some spaces in the map around the starting area... otherwise those areas will be \*way\* too easy later.
---
Haha. Yea. That would be great. Would definitely need marsuipal to survive. The spread on it now is insane, couldnt imagine missing your target with a two shot
---
Get a handmade with a hardened receiver and perforating mag. Take your first shot from stealth with the hunting rifle and then swap to the handmade to clean up the mess.
---
So, if bulks weight the same or more than the scrap, why bulking after all?
---
Possum.
---
Are you talking about reviving a friendly player so you can get your backpack?
---
Yeah, I hear you. I one shot anything aside from boss type mobs, but when sneak fails I like to not be too terribly glassy. I never really use ranged, so I like having a bit more defense.
---
Your SOLJWF. Get new friends, trust no one, grind it all back again, remember their names, hunt them down in PVP, show no mercy, leave no survivors. 
---
Then enjoy your game. 
---
The wasteland is cruel. Don't be a victim.
---
LOL. Its Fallout 4 online with no NPCs. I like it as I never care about the main quest and often never finish games I put hundreds of hours into. 
---
 YMMV ;)
---
I don't have a mic.
---
I cant help but notice you're avoiding commas now.
---
Thanks for informing that it does drop beyond level 5, but can someone provide a place to find natural pieces of the armor in the world, since it cannot be crafted? (Non-legendary)
---
Think it's 20mins.
---
That's alright
---
I had real trouble trying to take someone out who was hiding at the workshop with countless turrets. The turrets weren‚Äôt negligible.
---
Can‚Äôt you just message him or send a friend request on PS4? What am I missing here?
---
Wood nodes do have a delay before they refresh not sure how long but I normally can't harvest the same log near my base more than once every few hours.
---
My only advice is if you need wood use the perk Woodchuck makes harvesting wood way easier
---
I got the skull half face mask from atom shop and it protects from airborne illnesses
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs true. Except when someone is launching nukes and is bored with farming WS. 
---
My camp is near WV Lumber Company. Quiet little area with only the occasional Super Mutant. 
---
I logged in and the area was... quite toasty. 
---
Thankfully I always log out in my Excavator armor, just in case I want to do a looting run right before I start playing.
---
PS4, well there's your problem.
---
Would it have a l√§mp hanging off the side?
---
Got a Two shot from her
---
He's put everything on private :/
---
You can hang out after the event, and kill more spawns until the event procs again. Rinse, repeat...
---
 I just got a Meat Hook as I was bored and Wallace had one pretty cheap. I had stashed the mod, and put more hooks on it, and its into the 360 range.
---
 Its medium speed and not quite up to my knives for sheer DPS but damn it hits hard. ;)
---
I hate saying this but... picture or it didnt happen. Lol.
---
I added you by the way
---
I need someone too to die for me on Xbox one, gametag: RoaringAnemone6 I would be so great full üòä
---
I know three spots it spawns at the ranger station or office. Whatever it‚Äôs called in cranberry bog. I‚Äôve hunted for these and have gotten several. 
---
First place to look is behind the counter when you first walk in from the front of the ranger station on the right side if you are coming in/ or on the left side when you are behind the counter. Make sure to have your light on if your screen is too dark. 
---
Next place it might be is in the medical room right next to the counter. It will be on a stretcher. 
---
Final place if it‚Äôs not in either of those spots is outside behind the station in a barn-typish building. There will be cages. It will spawn on the metal cabinet on the top shelf. 
---
If in neither of those places, sever hop!
---
Scorchbeast Queen is a good mob to spawn for one üåü wood armor
---
Sorry. I wasn't paying attention.
---
I imagine it's like the two shot Fatman from FO4. A terrible weapon that almost certainly kills you, but looks totally amazing if it doesn't.
---
I‚Äôd like to hear why you think so. The opening of military hostilities happened on the part of the Confederacy at Fort Sumter.
---
You don't run a low health build then. Shallow water gives +10 rads with it equipped. Hitting any high rad area resulted in rad death faster than my poor diluted radaways could regen.
---
You're good!
---
If you run nuke zones regularly it might be worth shifting a couple points to PER and picking up glow sight. Otherwise, that's an interesting build.
---
You say this with such certainty. You do know they‚Äôve made other games right? This isn‚Äôt their only franchise. It was intentional and you‚Äôre wrong. Just stop dude.
---
I would get all the sneak perks. Really useful to creep around and nobody see's you. Especially if you are low health with unyielding. Also, use a nice quiet blade.
---
&lt;insert comment about how theyll use it as storage because i care so much about other people&gt;
---
No picture because I don't care if you believe me. Lol
---
I always assumed that's what fast travel was
---
You can still do the rug trick, just takes patience on getting it right.
---
I'd be find with just the big area notification. Like you know he's somewhere in this area but the exact location thing really sucks
---
I like my two shot fatman. Lol. Great for wiping mobs.
---
I've helped several people but am yet to get mine. I honestly hate all these new quests/dailies since I tend to be a loner and just want to play solo.
---
yup sure did thanks for the pic
---
There is a way to ‚Äúsend wires through walls‚Äù. Look it up on YouTube. It uses conduits and works fine.
---
Do you have stairs under the roof piece? I had this happen to me on PS4 and was able to place the roof if I moved the stairs.
---
I didn't know that, I'll stop blindly scraping them, never thought they were worth the bother.
---
Yes
---
Ah I understand. What is the major difference for the repairs?
---
To me it feels like ESO is to the Elder Scrolls games, it's like a casual multiplayer Fallout-themed game; not really part of the series, more like a spin-off. 
---
It's fun as a game in which to fuck around with friends in this universe you love from the single player series... as long as you didn't pay full price and you don't take it too seriously because it's definitely not a full price kinda game lol.
---
You seem to forget this is Fallout we are talking about.
---
Not as many as other fallout games.
---
And a one off holotape doesn't have all the myriad of voice lines that a typical interactive NPC does when you can choose what to say to it.
---
Well i mean. I wouldnt love it either, but id probably use it for the kicks. At least until the next day when my scrip reset. Lol
---
I mean the two shot Fatman with the grapeshot canister. If you used it in vats it almost always went like 50 ft, broke apart and then dropped straight down. It was always hilarious to watch, but almost impossble to actually use
---
Second this. It‚Äôs got 4 tents and upwards of 10 wood piles. Put on the woodchuck perk and you‚Äôll be gtg.
---
you! i love you! upvote.
---
They say they pretty much made the props from the show real things

Fwiw, 5 pieces of unyielding is over kill most of the time. I have a chameleon chest piece with a dense mod, 1 bolstering piece with reduced fdc weight, and 3 pieces of unyielding. It's more than enough to take down normal mobs in one swing (or stab), and bigger things like mirelurk queens and hermit crabs go down in 2-3 at most.
---
How does that work? So if you have a shotgun already painted red, and you put a different stock on it, it becomes blue?
---
Of course
---
Personally I wouldn't even want to be associated with make believe fascists.
---
We also can't attach a tambourine to a nuclear powered exoskeleton though.
---
wait really?  i didnt like the way it sat on my face so i just scrapped mine lol
---
This might actually be it, now just gotta work out how to move the stairs without having to redo everything :( Honestly the whole thing stopping you from making stuff 'inaccessible' is bullshit and should have been forgotten a long time ago, feels like you get punished for trying to be creative and not make one of those floaty camps (which I'm starting realise why people go for them).
---
Thats true. It takes a lot of practice to get it to hit your intended target.
---
I'm sure it somehow is related to the Atom Store.
---
Eh I had the dragon and a Armor piercing one they are really just not that fun or rewarding as my axe or gauntlets to use
---
Lol my two shot bloodied Fatman is garbage to I just enjoy lobbing nukes around when people are sneaking around me trying to gank my workshops
---
I got a pair on PC, what's your IGN?
---
Wait!, pounds? I thought it was in kilogrammes...
---
I'm fine if they never add elevators. I think it will add a lot of stability issues and I can't imagine how long it will take them to make those stable for multiplayer.
---
I got a nice ski sword, that's pretty much the only weapon I use unless I just have to go ranged, and for now I'm still using the fixer for that. Going to pick up a nice bloodied rifle when I come across one, no luck so far. Just needs to be something I can put a suppressor on.
---
Maybe, but I haven‚Äôt had any problems one/two hitting enemies (instigating &amp; furious hooks)
---
Don't worry.
---
Todd will start selling Plastic in the Atom Shop to "fix" the issue I'm sure.
---
Nope never played a single fallout game ever

Should we tell him?

Wow, you are way behind the times.

Well, I mean it *was* The War of Northern Aggression...

The cosmetic clean army fatigues can be obtained via technical data through the brotherhood. Dirty fatigues spawn in various places, including west tek.
---
I wore the Confederate uniform one time and went on screaming "Fetch me cotton" when I see characters with black skin, and they'd emote "angry" or "confused". Didn't really mean to offend anyone, it was just fun.
---
I'm not American by the way. My knowledge about ACW is limited to what I've read.
---
Thank you for taking time to explain this however,  considering the fact that I try to play with others but it seems like everyone I meet is just doing their own thing which is fine with me and that I bought a backpack skin, thinking it was just a backpack, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be getting this either with a lot of effort. It‚Äôs all good though the game has been fun so far. Just thought the backpack looked cool so I bought it for 5 bucks, oh well only paid 15 for the game.
---
Was it a drop sir?

Veil of Mysteries offers protection without the -2 perc.   and that thing is a piece of silk cloth.

---
The problem is that the 'raiders' were generally arseholes about it (at least in my personal experience), and rather than roleplaying a raider faction they just trolled other people who were roleplaying. 
---
Pro-tip from Elite: It's possible to walk away from a pirate/raider encounter with everyone having had a good time. But it does require good communication and the ability to read the room.
---
I once had a level 180 take all of his armor off , buck naked as a player can be, he gave me a fully modded melee weapon for my level, 40, and said that if I could bring his health down to half by the time he fully equipped his armor and gun to kill me, he'd drop me a buttload of actually useful aid items. 
---
Long story short, he tricked a full grown man into cooking toast while in a bathtub. Instantly died on the first swing. Bright side was he was laughing so fucking hard, he still gave me 50 stimpaks and 30 Psycho. 
---
Dark side was I found him later  cause he was number 2. He didn't know I was a full gunslinger build. I'm good at iron sight aiming. Guy should be a pharmacist with the amount of chems I got from him.
---
I mean it's a pathetically pedantic argument, but unlike the rest of your bullshit, technically correct.
---
I really want the scaffolding from Fallout 4
---
I found some yesterday in the buildings outside of Uncanny Caverns when I was server hopping for a cave cricket.
---
Looks and feels like Fallout to me. Same mood, same themes and aesthetic. See Fallout: Brotherhood Of Steel for what an ‚Äúun-Fallout ‚Äú Fallout game looks like. Hell, look at Fallout Tactics and whatever Van Buren was supposed to be, feels more like a Fallout than those
---
T-60 doesn't require springs to repair. Just steel, plastic, and aluminium.
---
Why shouldn't they be proud of their armor? Some sets take a long while to put together.
---
They developed the ecavator Armor to dig not fly and since they never weaponized it. Id find it strange to have one.
---
As far as Ultracite I don't even remember if they explain how or why it was created. I know you find out how ultracite is made but not why it was used for PA since at the time development costs would have been insane. Since you had to nuke a mine to harvest it and it's half-life was incredibly short.

not quite that fast but close lol. edited main post with the tale. :)

There could be a few reasons why your roof isn‚Äôt placing:
---
- Invisible roof piece
---
- Nearby wall/roof pieces are blocking you from placing it
---
- If you‚Äôre placing it above stairs, roofs can‚Äôt go directly above the top half of a staircase

Managed to fix it, thanks bud!

I fully support this idea
---
nope , twas friendship killed the Jeb. edited main post.
---
I'm level 40 with level 30 gear. ARguably a semi Gunslinger build cause I don't have MASTER Gunslinger yet.
---
I only have weight and pistol perk cards for the most part, no explosives, no rifles, no heavy, nothing like that.
---
I instantly killed a level 143 in power armor by chucking 2 fucking FRAG grenades at him, then popped him in the skull once with my .44 revolver before the nades went off.
---
Pvp in this game is NOT balanced. I should NEVER be able to kill someone that much higher level than me off GEAR ALONE, with just 2 frag grenades, no explosive perks, and a single headshot from a pistol while he's in full clad power armor and a fucking power helmet on.
---
Makes you actually fucking terrified no matter what level you are, cause almost ANYONE in the game has the potential to murder you.
---
That's just 50% of the base, and it has to hit 6 times in a row to hit 50%

2.5 hours . edited main post.

What you nuking ?
---
There are so many who don't know this still, I get a lot of people who look at my first vending machine and then just dip. So frustrating.

Still haven't found someone help.
---
Nice. My average weekly best survival score is 50k know most don't care but it's always makes me feel better about being trash in pvp
---
The other guy mentioning staircases a minute ago has got me to get it fixed, but I appreciate this a lot man I'll save this comment as I imagine the guide will deff come in handy.
---
lol - my mains name is fixer. it was always my handle for the railroad.
---
Spot on. Things like this make me wonder why I've logged almost every day since beta.
---
People dont like looking though crap.
---
Oh I must have been thinking glowing mass. Too much mass for me to remember ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
&gt; Yea, it would seem to me that survival mode is much closer to the game they wanted to make but it changed a lot after people freaked out that their precious ideas of Fallout were solo player experiences.
---
I don't think that's true... I think the problem was that they didn't really know what kind of game they were making. But they definitely had the idea it would be a 'real' Fallout with a story and not just a PvP battle royal.
---
&gt; This is a real bummer. I hate that so many fallout players are ANTI-PVP. Really upsets me. This thinking killed what would've been a fleshed out PVP in the wasteland full of tension and trust and survival. PVP paranoia is the most misguided and thoughtless shit. Ruined an aspect of this game that could've been so awesome.
---
Well now you have that mode. Go nuts.
---
 If you are on PC and get a Handmade or Lever Action I can put a suppressor on it.
---
close, 2.5 hours to level three and a friend showed up. probably going to scrub my friend list for the next attempt.
---
I'm on now on PC, same name
---
Viagra ftw
---
The problem is that you gain survival points by JUST PLAYING THE GAME. Which is a horrible system, PERIOD. I shouldn't shoot up to 3rd spot and be REVEALED by everyone cause I helped take down a scorchbeast one time. You shouldn't gain points based on shit you kill, ONLY on killing players to steal their points with a flat amount gained by killing players period AND time played during that session. 
---
Kills it when I see I'm 1st on the board cause I'm just doing quests at level 40, now I gotta go stand next to an exploding car so I can reset and not worry about being gunned the fuck down, since screws, lead, and aluminum seem to be very scarce so far, and therefore seem to be VERY valuable.
---
Thanks
---
Recently bought it for 25 dollars off amazon, it came with a cardboard circle with the code on it.
---
You my friend make sense which is hard to find
---
You can only buy the bayonet as a mod, often in Watoga. I saw it once on a vendor, wasn't too high on caps so I didn't buy it
---
&gt;I have seen an uptick in griefing in adventure mode 
---
I imagine Beth saw that too and that's why slap damage went away. There's very little you can do to grief in adventure mode now.
---
No worries, I'm on xbox
---
Im completely open to discussion
---
I tried 3 times today and never got any legendary spawn, maybe i was doing it wrong ? i dunno. 
---
I dragged the horde bosses in circles for half an hour to an hour each. And while adds were often respawning none of them where legendaries at all.
---
To sell to vendor bots
---
&gt;How do you get the backpack?
---
Become a possum scout.
---
How do you become a possum scout?
---
Find a scouting poster at any train station and read it. You can then travel to the scout camp by Lake Grafton and become a tadpole scout. Once you're a tadpole scout you have to 'demonstrate pioneer scout values' by earning tadpole badges, helping out the pioneer scout leaders and reviving any rando player with a stimpak. The tadpole badges will each require to perform a set of challenges that prove your proficiency in that subject and pass a written test with a perfect (5/5) score. YOU can find the laundry list for each tadpole badge under the Challenges&gt;World part of the map menu. There are also variuos written guides and checklists. Google them. 
---
Once you do that you will be awarded a level 20 tadpole backpack and plans to make another up to level 50.
---
To make your backpack bigger and better (add carry weight, increase armor, add refrigeration capability, etc.) you'll have to earn possum badges.
---
How do you earn possum badges? Similar to the tadpole challenges once you unlock the possum rank you'll unlock Possum world challenges which work just like the tadpole challenges. For each one you complete you get a badge. You will also get a (rare) chance at earning a badge for doing chores for the scout masters and attending the campfire tales event. Each backpack mod takes 5-8 badges to unlock.
---
Good luck.
---
Hmm, it said that he only does in the random encounters map that was recently posted here, I dunno. If you guys say so then I guess I'm wrong
---
Hell, I just wonder up and wave at people. 98% of the time that means death, but I rarely take the first shot.
---
Holy shit you are right!  I did not know this, thank you for the tip.
---
They're separated by category. People always buy stuff. They just then leave without checking out the rest. I sell things to move.
---
Camp venture normally has one or two along with fort defiance
---
if i'm not mistaken the ps4 also saves each picture to the console as well unless i heard incorrectly
---
You must be fun a parties
---
Have a melee build tuned for pvp and let me just tell you don't unless youve got more stealthbois then you know what to do with. if you can get to your target before getting gunned down they'll start jumping and you won't be able to hit then while they're free to point blank vats your face off.
---
The number of dickheads that just want to trash other people's camps is crazy to me.
---
Forgot to add this in the last one, help me tear ass through the silo and you choose the spot?
---
Pretty good man, definitely going to lay waste in one shot to pretty much everything heh
---
Eh, the lack of NPCs dont bother me terribly much, but i do miss them. I really wish thry didnt rush and took their time to fix it, but its too late for that now
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Life of it
---
You can't pick up wood of the same places until some time has passed. When the server changes, the wood respawn in these places, but you can't take it.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve heard that. Mainly like them showing up on load screens, and now it‚Äôs just back to the stock pictures.
---
Sucks, it really does, BUT I have to play devils advocate. Anyone ever see The WAlking Dead? Remember the old old episode where Eugene is taken in by Neagen because he knew how to produce ammunition? Gave him huge perks, treated him like a VIP, make sure he was ..compliant, but comfortable and respected. Why? Because that fucker produced the goods. 
---
YOu produced the goods and carried them all on you, you didn't play to match your playstyle lol. You playe din the open like someone with nothing ot lose ,while carrying Fort Knox in your pantaloons. The one thing I do like about Survival is that it DOES make it so the more and more you loot without traveling back to camp, the riskier it gets to stay out in the open. 
---
I did a Free Range event once with a group of peeps, real friendly, all in Excavator Power Armor. We got mini nuked at the end, all of us died by ONE guy, who apparently told us through mic chat while we lay dead, that he was running a full explosives build. A single BASEBALL grenade could've taken most of us out apparently. He also thought about setting up land mines around the final objective to see if we just walked ourselves into death. 
---
Sadly, I looted the Sheepsquatch before I died lol. Lost some good meat, least fo rmy level, and some stimpak supers I got from the event.
---
This is the answer, just did it myself like 5 days ago.
---
Hell make the plots 1000 atoms I'll buy most people will
---
 Assassins ... but they nerfed it so I dunno. Anything you can add some stagger to is useful. A lot of them will not care about explosive damage, I don't. ;)
---
You get extra stash space after bulking because the bulked item goes into your own inventory (instead of the stash) after it's created. The benefit is mostly illusory.
---
Thanks a lot! Will use it in the future!
---
I mean... just take the workshop and then don't defend it if someone contests. You still get the initial rewards and whatever resources you extracted.
---
I like the small amount of PvP still there... it givens those who are in 'factions' something to fight over and retains the idea that the greatest threat is other people.
---
North West of Widow's Perch. Same spot that main story sends you to. Spawns 3 low level wolves.
---
"Try to hunt me down" I went to a train station once, and got killed by a fucking .50 caliber sniper rifle on a cliff like a mile away, cause obviously it showed my marker in the train station. I heard that shot fire out, knew the sound, accepted death a second later. You will die no matter what if someone tries hard enough lol.
---
Four leaf also works wonders for multishot things like shotguns, Lazers with beam splitter and the like cause each projectile has a chance to proc it
---
Pretty sure that can't happen? They have to start contesting it from the single place... they can't ping you from miles away.
---
Lol it‚Äôs just a game bud, the Enclave have Fascist elements in the fallout lore. I don‚Äôt in any way advocate for fascism I would just like to roleplay as bad guys
---
I just think the game would feel so much more alive, imagine if you had random wanderers sitting at the bar of your camp making small talk with eachother or doing other immersive shit that's mundane for other players to do but adds to the whole experience. Even if there's still no dialogue options at least it'll feel less playgroundy and more like an actual world.
---
Hopefully come Wastelanders things might change...
---
The main flaw in your math is that 2 shot and instigating can't appear together because they're both primary effects. Also, I'm not sure how all the other perks stack, but I am pretty sure it's not additive like that.
---
Its pengun in game. Some fool took my name here. ;)
---
if you play on xbox, i can give u a hand
---
Some bozos don't use fireproof so they get destroyed by explosive, that's my only problem but, I didn't know they nerfed assassin's
---
Yeah, I just can't help but associate fascism with Nazis so I'll pass.
---
Jesus, how do you find so many 3 star enememeneies?
---
It's definitely hilarious the first time I thought it was a bug, the next time I just laughed and stood and watched
---
Survival is just PvP mode atm. It would be great if they named it that, and then had an actual Survival mode. Make it iron man, make people use a survival specific character... make it somewhere between the current two modes. Maybe reintroduce the 'slap' pvp, but with the pre-slap attacks less nerfed... just to reduce accidental friendly fire and/or stealthed-sniper trolling. 
---
I'd be down for that.
---
You only need to look at one. If level 20 Timmy is selling stimpaks for 75 per he sure as shit has crap gear for impossible prices. A waste of time.
---
On ps4 mines froze 3 times now at near end of the event. I‚Äôm done trying till next patch.
---
someone walked up to me at the whitespring train station the other day, and messaged me "die pls. for backpack". So I dropped an orbital strike beacon. 
---
Turns out that's a bad idea.
---
Understandable at low leve.s I'm level 40, and am so dried out on screws, aluminum and lead from being killed T\^T
---
I‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs just bugged. I‚Äôve been playing since launch, killed well over a hundred queens on my main alone, and my main is a HW specialist with a 50cal- high rate of fire. What‚Äôre the odds that out of 100+ kills, competing with anywhere from 4 to 15 other players, I‚Äôve never once had the kill shot? 
---
Let‚Äôs rephrase this: has ANYONE *completed* that challenge?
---
The mod is sold at Enclave bunker occasionally, don't think i've seen a plan but haven't been looking.
---
They fixed that a while back. But at the same time started scrapping Bulked junk. /sigh
---
The plasma/laser gat both have a good number, but both are also kind of sub-par weapons.
---
When you go to a store in the real world, it's also helpful to look in different isles.   
---
When you go to whitesprings, the different vendors have different stock too!
---
I literally just found my first TSE yesterday. On a hunting rifle. A level 40 one. /cry
---
 I dunno what they did to weapons but the Armour now has a % chance to proc.  Not nearly as good as it was, which I'm sure was what they intended. ;(
---
Link doesn‚Äôt work,  but I‚Äôll check the atom shop in a minute
---
Legit went up to someone and said can you kys?
---
Reminds me of me when I started.
---
Do you feel better about yourself after all this insulting? Do you feel you've come out on top of this? Do you believe that you have triumphed over me with baseless insults? 
---
Are you still having fun?
---
You are correct. I was speaking for purely defensive purposes legendary armor out performs power armor. I feel like power armor is a must have for heavy weapons as well partially because of the stabilized perk but also the jetpacks etc. I could have written that a bit more clearly.
---
Yet again. The insults started with you, dude. 
---
Why are you continuing on this track?
---
Yeah. What did they break that could be fixed in under 20mb?
---
 Yeah, Executioners is probably better now.
---
A filter still won't protect you from gas.
---
Idk but I would like to know.
---
They did announce in the official forum.
---
Apparently it was a client-side only update to address a stability issue.
---
&gt;2 different modes is dumb and separate the players. 
---
Only the players who WANT to be separated. It's the only real way to keep both groups happy.
---
Im having a good time. Running a train on this nuke zone right picking up a ton of legendaries
---
Im game if queen is the target,  psn Alien_Ian
---
Where does this event occur
---
try reloading the camera even though it says it has film
---
That‚Äôs understandable
---
Yeah? What‚Äôs the deal with the 5mm Gatling? I have a couple decent ones.
---
 LOL. I just wait by the normal spot they spawn, well just down the hall and they come to me. They can spawn outside but not as often.
---
It's not your fault.
---
I didnt launch the nuke, so no it is not :)
---
Ah Oki. I don't use the forum but I get info from Twitter.
---
Camp Adams at night starting at 9:45 pm on your Pip Boy
---
Then how do you become a possum scout because I have the backpack even the armor upgraded one and I've done the campfire at least a dozen times and still no smore's recipe.
---
That was 1050 caps, right? Not...actual dollars, right?
---
I did this in the Charleston train yard and the train yard North of Whitesprings instead.
---
They usually spawn the little robospiderthings, in Charleston they are really low lvl, and 'kill x enemies in train yard y' is an objective for Railway Enthusiast.
---
Two birds with one stone :)
---
To answer your question, I've never seen none legendary wood armor.
---
This must be a joke / troll. If you want to even play real money for it, there are plenty in Ebay.
---
I wouldn't really call it "farming". You have to wait like 45-60 seconds between "waves" of 3 or 4 enemies, which by themselves have a pretty low rate of being legendary. Sure, you'll get some, but unless you get lucky it will probably be on the slower end of the bar as far as legendary farming goes
---
I mean, the Nazis were literally called the Nationalist Party so...
---
&gt; You didn't even know how to team up and declined my team request,
---
That's me. When I first emerged from the vault, I had 2-3 team and friend requests. But the interface felt so weird that i really couldn't figure out how to team or add as friend. I use a xbox controller(PC) so as far as I can tell you have to open the pip boy go to the quest area, then go to the map, then click the RB button and then try to find the person you want to add and then click and send request. 
---
And I just got the merit badge quest. I know I won't be finishing that since I play maybe 3-4 hours a week and have literally no friends in the game.
---
Hush the fun police might catch on to this
---
Once per hour by my experience, but someone needs to enter the lab to trigger it.
---
Most times it takes forever to get another legendary to finally spawn. I've tried these a bunch of times and my best was 2 legendaries in maybe like 30 mins of dancing around the horde boss and killing the newly spawned ads as they slowly come in every couple minutes. Idk if its worth it tbh so I wouldn't blame someone for just wanting to get the legendary and move on with their life. Probably more fun and just as "efficient" to just clear locations. Good XP farm though I suppose.
---
Throwing my own name in the hat. This is the first game where I've really enjoyed just bumming around with a group and helping each other out. 
---
I'm on the Xbone: Broken Vader.

Just send me a message that says "Reddit" or something because I've been getting a lot of random requests lately and I don't want to accidentally delete any requests from you hooligans.
---
Does "The Gutter" legendary weapon qualify as an Assaultron Blade for purposes of this challenge?  I hatte to ask, because it seems obvious so, but this being Bethesda...  I felt better safe than sorry.
---
Lol think what you want, but I didnt insult you first. You just felt insulted, stems from insecurities. 
---
And you're the one who keeps responding. You said it yourself, I'm a a troll. Remember?

Bring back the Fallou 4 Pipboy App!
---
I try not to either, it is a bit of a cesspit, but when something peculiar like this unexpected update happens I don my wading wellies and head there ;)
---
I think this makes sense on the surface, however bulking is a new ‚Äúconcept-thing‚Äù to 76 that didn‚Äôt exist in FO4. 
---
Here‚Äôs my take, just an pedestrian guess/opinion/perspective, correct me if you know more/better, here to make friends:
---
TL;DR - Now that the game is ‚Äúdone‚Äù the devs and engineers will get to chose the biggest overhauls and ‚Äúmost fun‚Äù projects for the game, we should be flooding their subreddits with suggestions for the week their team has to be ‚Äúnot in panic mode‚Äù before E3. 
---
1 Argument -
---
I think at a code/schema relationship with the objects that are ‚Äújunk‚Äù, ‚Äúaid‚Äù and ‚Äúammo‚Äù all share an ‚Äúelegant‚Äù model system, it‚Äôs time to overhaul it now that the game is ‚Äúfully-baked‚Äù. 
---
2 evidence -
---
There was unexplainable non-salvageable loot in FO4 that is salvageable in 76. EG stingwing barb, folders, other stuff I‚Äôm sure. 
---
They‚Äôve never really implemented ‚Äúladders‚Äù self-admittedly even. 
---
We know that the combat system in the latest engines from BGS have had Weapon Animation ‚Äúspeeds‚Äù tied to the DPS you‚Äôre doing, also why they cap their frame rates at like 60fps. At least that‚Äôs what people found in FO4, maybe it wasn‚Äôt like that before. 
---
3 inferences/observations - 
---
The problem is that ‚Äújunk‚Äù and ‚Äúaid‚Äù i think abstractly has relationships with ‚Äúmany things‚Äù so i presume they had groups and sub groups (keys, coins, big junk, ammo, plant, chem, so on) based on cosmetics, (we‚Äôve had junk with zero purpose in fallout since forever).  
---
My suspicion is that they are going to have to ‚Äúre architect‚Äù their Schema to make these work right, but they have to invent a subsystem to match the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù Cosmetic - oriented schema. 
---
4 I‚Äôm certain devs had recommend this since the games initial development -
---
It takes time to do one of these things, I‚Äôm positive the engineers, devs and infrastructure have all pushed to do things like this since forever, but the decision makers at dev shops are rarely in that group. 
---
Crafting weapons, armor, aid, ammo, is one thing but with the ‚Äúconditions‚Äù on those, ‚Äúspoil‚Äù conditions on aid, those a newish features that add a layer of ‚Äúschema‚Äù between crafting with raw junk. 
---
A lot of craftables need a rare component that can only be harvested from flora and fauna, which can spoil, to salvage rare mats for rarer fusion cell, explosives, and more. 
---
At one point the new ambitious feature sets outgrew the ‚Äúfuture vision concept‚Äù.  The longtime veterans of the Creation Kit can steer me true here. I‚Äôve played in it but my computer has problems running it :( 
---
5 possible positives from dev cycle - 
---
The BGS engine, i don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre called ‚Äútoday‚Äù but Havok and ‚Äúnew-not-gamebryo‚Äù. I think with each game they make changes to their platform/engine which talks to the Cosmetic/Animation engine to their SDK which you can see in action in the Creation Kit, i think the app is called Mud or something specifically. 
---
I think they can eliminate exponentially growing technical debt for each product and incorporate the ‚Äúcertain improvements‚Äù from any of those games baked in Dev time, and can reasonably write out ‚Äúoverly ambitious‚Äù features as a learning experience or R&amp;D for taxes. 
---
So we‚Äôre getting at least 3 teams working on different proprietary ‚Äúengines‚Äù but eventually the technical debt overcomes even an organized/chaos dev cycle will eventually be convinced by the engineers to overhaul things. 
---
6 argument summary-
---
I think they‚Äôve got 76 at a point of balance/endgame hobbies/server stability for most of the disappointed players who said ‚Äúill play when the ‚Äòbugs are fixed‚Äô‚Äù are jumping in, maybe for a second try. 
---
After ‚Äúit‚Äôs fixed‚Äù or ‚Äúdone‚Äù they‚Äôre looking forward. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúfun‚Äù moment and E3 we‚Äôll see what they‚Äôve chosen for now. 
---
Now is the time for them to consider what first ‚Äúlarger fixes‚Äù or ‚Äúmore ambitious new features‚Äù like flying-mount-controlled-power-armors, or bulking all ammo. 
---
 7 moving forward (my ideas, for the sake of fun)
---
Maybe a vendor who will let you sell and buy public bulked goods with no limit but the ‚Äúdaily‚Äù goods sold/bought across all servers determined the buy/sell prices. For every 1 bulk ammo/aid/mat you get 90% buy/sell value. So you could only sell a handful of each type daily and the price would compare to the current daily/weekly ‚Äústock evaluated price‚Äù. 
---
What if you could just give it 10 bulk steel and get a 10 bulk steel stock/bond token instead. 
---
You could even trade these tokens or sell them at home vending for less to undermine that economy. 
---
This lends itself to the idea that players could farm/bulk junk and ammo, and ‚Äúinvest‚Äù in that stock. In game stock value. If you unlock stock trading charisma level, you can buy and trade ‚Äústock tokens‚Äù which are good for 10/100/1000 bulk ‚Äújunk/ammo‚Äù. This takes the limitations off your daily cash flow and gets you thinking about farming. Simultaneously then can keep one Auth server call for 1000 bulk units of aluminum instead of tracking auth for thousands and thousands of scrap aluminum auth.
---
I remember switching to a melee build at your level due to the same frustration.  Everywhere you go, level 68 and over player have spawned similar level Super Mutants and other baddies, and the rifles are so hopelessly underpowered with no real perks available to help until later.
---
If I had to do it again .... I'd say either play through it building like others suggest, or switch to Melee and start building rifle again at level 50 or higher ..... It's not bad to have both rifle and melee.
---
And messing with insulting trolls on my day off is something I do from time to time. 
---
Why are you sitting here, insulting me, over and over again, for no reason? What's in this for you?
---
Hes real, killed that stalking bastard for the first time since beta this week.....
---
Twin Lakes but its a random.
---
I had to buy a skin from the Atom shop to make it match my outfit T_T
---
MAYBE THAT WAS THEIR PLAN ALL ALONG?! DUN DUN DUNNNN!
---
Yeah it works.
---
Make a slingshot with a spike board trap
---
When are we doing this?
---
 Oh lord. Hardened, True Long Barrel, Perforating mag, Suppressor, a nice Precise Stock. You can hang the big mag on it and do surprisingly well against Armour, but I keep going back to Perforating.
---
?
---
I always build the floors, roof, and walls first before adding anything else for this vary reason.
---
Maybe I will peek in once in awhile
---
A Canadian would not use a common to enhance his/hers eh, I think you may be a phony

What platform?
---
Mister... will you die for me?
---
Props to anyone who gets the reference
---
What system?
---
Have I missed something? Since when is there a volcano in Berkly?
---
It would kinda b pay to win also bc you bought it to craft and some other people might not have one
---
Oh I'm just having fun playing around while I'm watching TV with my wife. You havent been messing with me lol, it's the other way around. All you've been doing is throwing out insults as much as possible. I've merely made observations of your personality based on your responses. 
---
It is quite fascinating to see someone go to such lengths just to have the last word of a discussion they so clearly lost control of.
---
As someone who plays solo and without a mic... yeah, I am still stuck on that. I am also in that HUGE gap between being over level 30, but not above level 76 so the daily level up challenge is absurd sometimes. I sorta understand wanting to get creative with challenges and quest objectives but it seems like obvious things to overlook.
---
I think you mean fo76.
---
It spawns at completely random tourist destinations, such as the Mothman Statue or Colonel Kelly monument. After about 10 minutes of server hopping, I found the guy. And once you loot his corpse you should start the quest.
---
Ah! That probably would‚Äôve been important to add. PS4 is what I‚Äôm playing on.
---
Yikes, thank you for saying that!ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
---
Yay! Glad I could help :)
---
I like the way you think.
---
The newbie took their smores!
---
I think your thinking of hunting rifle. Lever can‚Äôt have mags.
---
I can join in a few. I'm only level 51.
---
I've had to remove every block touching the stairs multiple times and that always works for me. Pain in the ass, but it works.
---
It‚Äôs was bottle caps.
---
I e noticed occasionally when I‚Äôm trying to collect various things in power armor that nothing will click. Fortunately, the simple fix was simply exiting and re-entering Power Armor, but yours might not be as simple a fix. Good luck.
---
LOL. Yup an entire horde of Ghouls and I'm snick snick ...
---
1 learned mod per slot. Sadly the Prime receiver competes with it's best mod.
---
Long Barrel, Speedy Receiver, Comfort Grip, Sight Ring (been bugged since launch, was "fixed" but still broken a few patches ago; I don't bother with it), Drum Mag (takes it from 250 rounds baseline to 500; but I don't use it, the gun fires slow enough that 500 rounds takes like 10 minutes to empty, and it blocks the view even more since it sits on TOP of the gun, and, well, every mod adds weight and reduces durability, so why add mods that don't benefit you?), Bayonet (I don't bash, so I'm not adding a mod that, again, reduces durability and adds weight)
---
It's my workhorse. Very accurate (with grip and barrel mods and Stabilized perk), and high damage per shot make it very ammo/repair efficient. Running a bloodied build, but using an instigating 25% fire rate gatling gun, after Adrenaline stacks up to 40%+, it oneshots super mutants with body shots. 
---
I still use a bloodied 50cal for big enemies, the raw DPS is unbeatable, but for everyday trash it's usually my gatling gun.
---
Maybe? Crafting is so annoying because you can't even see the add-ons you can get, I can't compare the dress to a set of any armor with stealth/muffled moves.
---
GT ShiningAnimus

I'm on right meow
---
I have a level 89?(somewhere around there) and I just started a new character.
---
I have about 5 levers. Each one tuned for a need. A big game hunting: hardened, stabilized barrel and stock with a suppressor and medium scope, give me fair range and efficiency. Assuming you have all rifle man perks maxed, with tank killer and tormentor. 
---
The second one I use mainly is a short style one classed as a mare‚Äôs leg. Modded for hip fire and firerate with glow sights. Good for a run and gun game. 
---
Really comes down to what you want out of it. 
---
For me honestly I look up a real world design and try and emulate it ingame.

You play on PS4? I‚Äôd like to check out your amazing prices

---
Given that your entire reply thread to me seems based on me "insulting" You by assuming that you were a new player due to your lack of knowledge and experience, this entire thread's been pretty amusing for me. Especially given that's the same form of insult you used against me, more or less. 
---
As for "the last word" I've got no real interest in that. But your hypocrisy and petty nature is fun to poke at.
---
saved me such a headache man can't thank you enough!
---
I had it work for me in the forest. Had 3 extra legendary show up, until someone else spawned in and went straight for the boss.

Goddamn, some people just suck ass.

Cool - thanks. Yeah I have the backpack - looking to add the mods.

Yeah this shit's annoying and dumb ass that I am I always forget about it, try to take something on and get smacked half to death.

Yea that is what I figured.

Kill things, take their loot, sell said loot.

Play lots.

Nope. It's bugged.

Hey I know this guy!

BBQ did it.  Thanks

I just started playing, and paying attention to, the game again after a 3 month break
---
I think it's called Lewisburg? There's a little campsite near a bot stop over there and there were three trees with blight on them
---
Running westek and selling all the weapons you find and player vending
---
Yeah you down bud?!?!?
---
I wasnt insulted you thought was a new player. You simply insulted me by calling me names, as though we were school children. I was never upset or offended by your insults. My feelings aren't hurt as easily as yours seem to be. 
---
And you can lie to yourself all you like, but this thread was nothing but frustrating for you. 
---
You havent "poked at" me at all, but you on the other hand were very responsive to my pokes. Your gnashing at the teeth was top show. 
---
Now it's your turn to type again.
---
LOL yep. I think where you're standing at moves the spawn in point but its just a theory I haven't scienced yet. If I go near the tent they always seem to spawn in that tent area - if I stand on the helipad that's when they run off the cliff. could just be coincidence though.
---
It's just a question of how much utility you want in your build. I personally find three of the level 1 cards sufficient and they are definitely more efficient in terms of value per perk slot
---
 I can run 2 pieces, and I am very difficult for the mobs to target. I can run 1 piece and I am still elusive, but slightly less so. 
---
 All I have is 2 bits for my Heavy Combat so that's my experience.
---
They're very expensive, 9k+ even with hard bargin iirc. You'd probably be better off trying to buy them off another player for much cheaper
---
Optional bayonet mod only

I have never seen any Mounted mole rat head plan drop from Stings and Things.

---
When's the last time you played Survival? It IS "death from behind the bushes", because the meta weapons kill so fast it's mostly about who spots who first if they both have a TSE handmade or other end-game weapon.
---
I guess thats a better way to phrase my question.  Which provides more value?  Fewer maxed out perks, or more lower perks
---
Dataminers showed the blunderbuss would not be in the loot pool even before the purveyor came out. As of yet, I have only seen weapons and armor from that datamined list, and have not seen anything NOT on the list, so I will assume it's accurate until proven otherwise
---
I know this was months ago, but I thought I'd add my $.02. I got a lvl 35 furious minigun, and tonight I used it twice against the SBQ once she landed. It's hard to tell since everyone is shooting her, but I swear it did a ton of damage. I have max heavy gun perks and stabilized, and she was under endangerol at the time. But it seemed, at max damage, to do more than my max level explosive gatling gun. Again, it's hard to test, since I tend to shred all minor enemies with either gun, and I haven't been able to test it solo against a regular SB. That would be the tell, I guess.

Anyone know where plans for the lever spawn or are sold? Especially hardened receiver?
---
It's Stimpak not Stimpack
---
Probably would, but with the stupid damage cap you can hit someone with 10, 000 damage and the filter still cuts you off at 75% of someone's health on the first shot. Everyone is running around with fast-firing weapons to get around the filter that kill a millisecond slower than a single shot, so there is no reason for the filter. All it does is prevent us from using high damage long reload/slow swing weapons competitively like Super Sledges, BP rifles and Dragons, Fatmen, etc... The filter needs to go.
---
I always get my daily cap stash started at billings homestead on the left side of the map. with green thumb perk you can get 500 ish  caps just by picking the corn and razor grain crops there. then I sell off all the extra meds I get from pharma farmer. I generally have plenty left over to stock on my vending machine . the vending machine I sell everything cheap 5 caps per med 1 cap per junk  1 c per ammo. no missiles or nukes though theyre too heavy.
---
Caps 101. Have hard bargain perk. Raise your charisma as  high as possible, using stats, chems, unyielding armor, whatever makes sense. 
---
After that you've got a few path options. Need them in a hurry? Go clear west-tek and collect all the guns. Those can go for 30+ caps a pop, I often find myself with 600+caps after selling just the guns, hammers, and grenades after a clear. Two or three clears and you're there. 
---
Another good option is to toss the chem scrounger perk from luck on and go through hotels, hospitals and the like, areas with a lot of medicine cabinets and doctors bags and scrounge. This combined with chems I get form farming ghouls tends to result in a hefty payout of easy to carry chems piling up in my inventory when I want a quick pile of cash. I always run with the chem carry weight reduction perk, so I can have hundreds of stems, med-x, radaway, rad-x, and various aid chems and not even notice. 
---
Get the cap scrounger perk and look up a map of cap stashes for a quick boost to your daily haul along the way. Just in whitesprings there are...three? Four? Which can net you a couple hundred easy. 
---
And it's worth noting that while selling chems to vendors can net you quick cash, if you're in a bit less of a hurry, players will buy most aid chems for 2-3 times what you can get for it at a vendor. 
---
Also worth listing? Dog food at about 8 caps a pop. sells like hotcakes.
---
I'll admit the marketing for this game was done really poorly, but they still got the message across quite clearly. This is a MMO with a fallout skin. It is not, will never be, and never attempted to be fallout 5. Anybody who says it is either never looked at any of the promotional material, never played the game, or is intentionally acting stupid for the sake of having something to complain about
---
Grafton Station for the plan. I‚Äôve been building and scrapping them for the mods.
---
Nope, I haven't installed any mods whatsoever
---
 Oh I'm responding to too many threads.;)  Of course not. I was confusing a Handmade set with this.
---
 I tossed the Hunting Rifle long ago, around level 40 or so. The Lever Action is just a better gun. 
---
 The mags on the Hunting Rifle are the only thing that makes the Hunting Rifle better for a pure Sniper build, but that is true. The lever Action will hit a bit harder, and more importantly more often for any other build.
---
yep even re-installing the game
---
This is very helpful thank you
---
Glad I'm not the only one. Fallout 4 in particular had a rather weak storyline, but even in 1-3 and NV I would just go off wandering to nearby towns or side quests rather than follow the main plot. The only time it bit me in the ass was when I ran out of time to get the water chip
---
Welcome! My GT is TighteyWhiteyMan, add me and I‚Äôll hook you up with some gear.
---
Nothing it‚Äôs just a bug from day 1
---
Really want some tall, rickety looking wooden stairs. I aim for lore friendly wasteland style builds and those metal stairs look really out of place.
---
You heard it here first lads, u/raznutz has exclusive insider info proving this
---
All good. I was like the lever doesn‚Äôt have mags. Unless they JUST buffed it. Imo I find the hunting rifle better a Long Range rifle and the lever to be a mid to semi long. 
---
I agree the mags make it ‚Äúbetter‚Äù if the ammo count was fixed.
---
The first level of the perk provides 10% damage, 2 and 3 provide 5%. So you're spending twice as many slots for the same effect for level 2+3
---
Since selling really good weapons and armor takes a lot of looting and can result in not having the best stock all the time I make most of my caps gathering, crafting, and selling things people use but don't feel like grinding for. Fusion cores, cheap nonperishable food and drink, ammo (5.56, .45, .308 sell the fastest), stealth boys, and rarer plans/recipes. Price things low enough and people will clean you out. Restocking feels like a minigame in itself.
---
I keep selling out of canned stew from Feed the People and perfectly preserved pie that I grab daily from West Tek. The stew has a great effect but goes for cheap yet I keep raising the price on the pie which is useless but continues to move.
---
I see it at the flatwoods vendor often.
---
Buy it from Scout vending. tadpole side,not Possum.
---
The more operant question is why are you carrying your bulk junk? Junk Shield isn't that useful in any case so...
---
 I will make you jealous. I bought my level 45 Instigating Lever Action from Wallace for about 380 caps. I could not believe it. I kept shaking my head, and went right back to my CAMP after buying it.
---
Nothing lol it just sits there XD
---
Play the legendary lottery daily for a chance at a good 3* weapon or armor piece which you can sell on the reddit market for anywhere from 5k to 20k
---
I tend to play solo all the time and I don't team up much ever except with a random friend now and then, but I like the idea of having factions.
---
Maybe something like a common place for people to join up as a member of the various factions that would give certain perks for that faction. Like a heavy gun and rifle +10% dmg boost for the Bos faction, or an energy weapon body for joining a robot faction, maybe Chem addiction resist for raider, Power armor buff and intelligence boost for enclave, etc.
---
To join a faction, you could complete quest lines for each, but you can only "equip" a various faction perk once at a time, and can change factions by completing the quest line again or something or maybe buy a faction loyalty pass for 2500 caps or something once you complete a quest line for the first time. 
---
That would be a good Canon way to explain how all the factions came about.
---
The regular one should be available from one of the vendors, I think free states. The "clean" version can be bought from a tadpole scout vending machine for 2 or 3 badges.
---
I‚Äôm beyond jealousy. I own too many so nothing I haven‚Äôt seen before. Currently have 3 instigating, an anti armour, 2 furious, a quad, a vampires, a two shot and an assassin‚Äôs.
---
Nice odd interaction in the wastes. Probably made the lil guys first few hours nice n memorable.
---
It's fun to watch, but you don't get xp or loot if they fall to their death. I stand there and try to vats snipe them as they're falling.
---
Shit you‚Äôre right.
---
 O they give you a code because they don‚Äôt want you to refund. What other stupid fucking company (and keep in mind that I‚Äôm an addicted to this fucking game) gives you only a code and has in their fine print ‚Äúyou cannot receive a refund when you ‚Äòuse a digital code‚Äô‚Äù
---
 If you want to seriously do Sniper, you need to look at the Gauss Guns as they are Rifles too. They hit like Trucks. ;)
---
Thats true, i normally look at it from the pov that all three maxed do 60% as opposed to just the 30%, but it does take 9 slots as opposed to just three ..
---
We need hardcore survival mode. You don't respawn after death, you start a new character!
---
Omw
---
Lol, ya go figure eh?
---
I had no idea! Sweet!
---
Nice! I got some doing that, but unless I missed something once I cleared them they were cleared. At Whitespring they kept coming
---
I am all about easing newbies into this harsh future.  I‚Äôm considering opening a free clinic or charity at the base of the mountain Vault 76 is on just to hand out free stuff.  Not gonna list it all at once and risk some jerk coming and cleaning it out to resell, will have to leave the machines stocked with smaller increments and restock often.
---
should be mid to end game plans so it's balanced
---
I‚Äôm good. I have bad luck with gauss. I can charge it up and do like maybe 1/8 of their health. But a non charged shot can down or nearly kill them. And I don‚Äôt know why. 
---
I run a scouts build. Dominant at range but can do work in close quarters if be.
---
Development costs. Even if it were easy, if it takes time it costs more money than they can justify for that reason. I don't know why this has to be brought up to refute the "it's not impossible" point. No one cares if it's possible at all at the end of the day. What matters is their incentive to do it.
---
This is only the second or third time I‚Äôve even plugged in my mic, and I play mostly solo myself.  The moment just seemed to organically happen, and I logged out soon after that to put my kids to bed then hopped back in later to play more solo.  In spite of this being billed as multiplayer Fallout, my experience with the game had been 99% solo.  And I‚Äôm loving it.
---
 Mine was at my favourite vendor for fuck all. But hey I hear ya. My collection is all about knives. I have converted quite a few to scrip as I only use a couple. ;)
---
Or just any monster with updated move sets, which would include them picking you up and tossing you around.
---
Like a SBQ nabbing you and dropping you from the air.
---
Would make the game slightly more challenging
---
You can sell it for 1 cap.
---
There is no "discussion" to be had with you, you fucking stupid troll. I don't have the time or energy to tell you how wrong you are, so I'll just down vote your god damned posts and move on.
---
What in your estimation is the Bethesda range unit vs a yard/meter
---
Yeah pretty much.  But I billed it more as a ‚Äòplease die and I will raise you from the dead immediately‚Äô.  Honestly if I had more time I probably could have just waited it out or lead him straight into an inescapable trap, but I was short on time and didn‚Äôt want to alienate a new player.
---
I don't know why you thought you'd convince anyone playing this smoldering dumpster fire to actually hop directly into the still-burning flames but ok. lol
---
Yup that's why it says personal opinion
---
I love clearing Glassed Cavern. I get all the meat and cook it all with superduper and can sell it all for almost 500.  Pick up all the weapons and loot all the bodies and you can easily make 1k just in one good run. There's no legendaries in there, so I never see other players, either. 
---
Neat trick is to wear your Excavator, or switch into it. Then server hop, and you gain an extra 100 lbs of carry weight. Adjust as many weight perks as you can, then scrap your junk at the workbench at the top of the elevator at the end of the cavern so you can fast travel to the vendor. 
---
Then go home and count your caps!
---
Bravo for the hilarious read!!! Since it sounds like you're relatively new yourself (or at least to the scout quests), might I suggest that you do the goo and bug gathering quests daily. Not only do you get plans, xp, and caps, but you also have a chance to earn possum badges (and you'll need 8 to get the high capacity mod, if you thought 30 was nice...try 120). Also, throw away the backpack they give you, because if you go to your armor bench and craft a new backpack, you can make it level appropriate and it adds 60 instead of the 30 from the low level default backpack they give you. And one more thing...there's an event at camp adams that you can do every in game night (has to be after 9pm) and it too gives plans and possum badges as potential rewards. There's 2 different endings for that event and the one that ends with waves has all the bug parts you need to turn in the quest at dolly sods. So when I first log in I always do the campfire story event at camp adams then I immediately go to dolly sods to turn it in. I've also got in the habbit of stocking up on the bug parts so all I need is radroach meat and there's always at least 1 radroach at that event and if not, there's one in the dolly sods cabin where you get the quest.
---
Sorry that was so long lol, hope it helps.
---
And it would give melee players a reason to move around and not just stand there and bop things.
---
Grafton, Lewisburg, Beckley for sure. And I‚Äôve seen it at the watgoa station from time to time.
---
Only drinking
---
There is usually a legendary drop (weapon or armor) and sometimes a plan, plus the usual stuff like stimpaks and non-legendary armor. I have the Formula P plan from the last event I completed.
---
But apart from the player co-ordination problem, the most annoying thing is that the animals you're trying to protect wander off towards the main lab area (on a suicide mission) for no apparent reason where the assaultrons/robots/other enemies are spawning. The ghoul and the yao guai do this frequently. Can they be herded back to safety (like brahmin) with the shepherd's crook?
---
No worries!  I love how helpful this community is, it is truly heartwarming.   I‚Äôve been playing since BETA and this is my second character, so I‚Äôve been around the block a few times.  I appreciate the tips, they are appropriate and helpful!
---
Yes.
---
I‚Äôm starting to get flashbacks of Naxx in WoW.
---
If anyone's selling it for much less then they're a duper. There's no legitimate way to acquire the plan except at vendor price.
---
 My best death in any video game was in the first Metro game. If you are not quick outside the Library, a Dragon will grab you.
---
 It grabbed me and took me up in a kind of circle then I could see a lot of the city. It then flew in a spiral and smashed me into a wll almost at ground level. I died. ;)
---
This. Also bulk excess scrap and sell often.
---
I don‚Äôt think so
---
Should say western revolver in plan
---
Athletic, archery and I forgot the third
---
But yes that‚Äôs the way
---
.44 magnum and western revolver has its own plan.
---
correction they were the national socialist german workers party. 
---
1. sold workers on fair and equal workplace rights for women.
---
2. two income houses became the standard stay home moms, and the nuclear family were stigmatized.
---
3. moved kids to government ran daycare and school systems since both parents had to work.
---
4. also gained power by advocating universal healthcare and increase medical care for all but began to collapse their own medical industry due to doctors leaving the country.
---
5. began encouraging abortions for all non aryan babies. you know like clinics, where the non aryan babys could go get murdered in the womb. cough cough planned parenthood cough cough. 
---
6. intentionally undermined the education system and focused on sports and athletics in order to more easily program the nazi youth to their nationalistic narrative.
---
7. disarmed all citizens so that a revolt was unrealistic these gun control laws were passed under the guise of reducing crime and increasing safety.
---
8. religon and all social groups outside of government control were stigmatized through the use of the government controlled media and school brainwashing. 
---
In the US we call them democrats.

Please buy my EC cartridges

Yea I didn't realize it till I was in the ash heap and all I had one was that mask and the white wolf fadora and it gave me the notification at the top... not sure if it does all the same as gas mask but it 100% working as of today
---
 No. The Western Revolver, the best pistol in the game, has it's own set of possibilities.
---
 It should say Western Revolver for the real thing, and it's mods.
---
If the offer still stands I‚Äôd love to get one. I‚Äôm having zero luck finding it at harpers ferry
---
 Verdant season 8 was a huge disappointment.
---
I did but the point is 16 times the detail shouldn‚Äôt mean 16 times harder to get rid of it

I never said it wasn't dupped. I said it would be much cheaper than in game price
---
Can't pick it up

did not know the tadpole dailies could grant possum badges. thanks for the tip.

Some of us just aren‚Äôt into farming, server hopping, finding exploits and whatever else. That shit isn‚Äôt even fun for me. I do just fine getting legendaries naturally and it‚Äôs enough for me, I‚Äôm not in some race to be a wasteland billionaire with every item in the game, when I have everything I could ever want I‚Äôll be fucking done, playing will feel pointless and I don‚Äôt want that. When I do 1VN I just want to have fun playing a quest. **You‚Äôre** the one fucking it up, not the people just trying to have fun. You need to realize **you** are the minority.
---
 You could be right. Its been so long. ;)
---
From the fissure in the south ash heap look to the northwest on the map. What looks like a mountain on it. There's probably 10 to 15 trees with blight on them in that general area. It's real common.
---
Gotcha. I got excited for a second because I love heavy weapons but hate power armor.
---
Legit having the SBQ just snacking on you mid fight would be cool.
---
Watoga mall vendor, IIRC. According to an older source it's also available at most of the raider vendors, although not Sutton.
---
&gt; (please stay out with your "It was actually the War of Northern Aggression" garbage. There are other places for that.)
---
*A C K C H Y U A L L Y*
---
I usually remember to check and reload, but of course today I forgot to check and fast traveled right into a legendary sheepsquatch with an empty gun. 
---
Spellcheck thinks sheepsquatch should be sheep squat. That makes me feel dirty that my iPad thinks I would deliberately type that.
---
eh, I'd estimate a BU as much closer to half a foot. 1/6 a meter? It's rough, because proportions are all over the place in game, but I'm mostly going off perceived size of Scorched and Ghouls, since they should be human sized.
---
Straight brutal
---
didnt death claws do this in 4?
---
Tell me it wouldn‚Äôt be cool?  Like having radscorpions just pierce your chest or super mutants finally making good on their promos to rip my arms off.
---
Come on. Its a multiplayer game, why buy it if you want a solo experiente? Just buy fallout 4 and be happy.
---
"Super mutants finally making good on their promises to rip my arms off"
---
That,
---
Yess
---
Handcars even exist already as objects.   I have seen them on railroads .   However actually I think it was motorized but still
---
Does it effect container loot? I sort of always felt like I got more stuff in containers and enemies had more and better loot during the verdant season. Also like there was more non instanced loot around too.
---
Seeing all of those quests along your screen in the thumbnail gives me so much anxiety lol
---
Mine got killed by scorched. Dumb scorched don‚Äôt even know how to farm, man.
---
With pacifist on it does zero damage so it's just funny at this point.
---
Who's the Perveyor, the Purveyor's older and hornier cousin?
---
Did you find out?  I hadn't heard about that and I'm running Adrenal with a Bloodied build.
---
Yeah, try as I might, I just can't help the urge to hit back when receiving damage... which then lands me on my ass
---
I had an idiot who clearly wanted something I had and just kept hitting me. I dropped purified water and continued on like nothing was happening. üòù
---
I‚Äôve got one pulled if you want it
---
Hahaha yeah me too. My friend (who is the lighter voice you hear) won't turn his quests off haha. But his recording had the best view
---
I've noticed it only with certain weapons. My .50 cal MG's and my Handmades. The rest seem to not do it, or not enough that I notice. I was server hopping for radscorpions the other night though and got killed more times than I want to admit because I forgot to load my MG before I got close to them.
---
lol
---
Yeah just turn on pacifist. Let em waste the bullets
---
ultracite ammo is fir guns with prime receivers. prime receivers deal bonus damage to scorched. so yes it does well against the sbq. however you need stable flux for the ammo so it can be a grind to get a stockpile.
---
All ultracite ammo does more damage to scorched and scorched beasts.  But it's very costly too make . I only have one gun I keep prime that I use exclusively for scorchedbeasts it's a aae lever action rifle.
---
I‚Äôm going to say no honestly and please tell me i am wrong, I have a 160, 80, and 60 but I still burn the queen. Take your primes elsewhere because it‚Äôs not for me.
---
That could be part of my confusion on this- +25 ad resist points not percent
---
there is also glowing blood packs and I think one of the nuka cola flavors and some kind of food- but still, nike zones are super hot
---
I could do that, but I'd rather shoot them add they're falling. Maybe I'll just chuck a couple in case I miss them.
---
Which cannot be crafted as far as I know, the weapon mod exists in the wild you can find.
---
Whatcha got friend?
---
Then why can I clip it but I can't read it. Who names this stuff.
---
I'm on atm
---
Thank you.
---
exactly what pacifist is for. dont want to fight you dont have to. if it gets annoying join a new server. Survival mode is a JOKE.
---
Its actually already in game, they have them for workshops but not campa for some reason
---
I realized this the first time I saw two vending machines at a player's camp. They each have a limit of 30 items listed for sale so players can build additional vending machines for more listings possible. I dunno how much camp space two or even three vending machines take up.
---
Are you on ps4 too? The only time I get blue screened is in nuke zones.
---
Plan is available at the Charleston and Morgantown Stations for 375caps.
---
It doesn't happen that much in nuke zones for me, it happens more often normally
---
Better than I expected. Looking forward to the details of your next attempt.
---
My machines are labeled to help clarify
---
This is not exactly bugged for me, but the last 5 attempts caused Sentry Bots to run to the friendly animals.  They'd either kill them or you'd kill the bots, they'd self destruct and instantly fail your quest.
---
I love lamp
---
Hahaha Nike zones are hot they got some sick ass sneakers. Jk tho. But yeah I feel like there‚Äôs some kinda exploit there some one mentioned about the perk that lets you breath underwater and how you get rads from water but with that perk you don‚Äôt and the way that rads effect you in water is the same as blast zones but just a higher amount.
---
If the stars align you can place a set of stairs elsewhere temporarily and then delete them.
---
I removed a half wall to try and delete a floor piece I accidentally put down that it would not let me delete. Now I am missing a wall and have an extra floor piece on my second floor. Sigh.
---
I would afk and leave the room and go make some food or a drink ...  this is the best medicine ..
---
It only works on cliffs and stuff, but you use stairs. 
---

---
This is ridiculous.... all of these workarounds so that deaf people can play the game properly... just add the feature ffs.
---
Hopefully never.
---
This also happens a lot with keys.
---
Sometimes this happens as one grows older.
---
I‚Äôll take a scotch with ice
---
Have you tried using different mods and seeing if any remove it?
---
Yea I have 3 3star.. 1 assassin explosive, 1 twoshot explosive and 1 bloodied explosive.. I still havent been able to get the suppressor plan learned it's getting real annoying, but probably my favorite gun in the game
---
What
---
# I‚Äôll take a scotch with ice
---
Sorry comments in the scotch
---
Ok
---
But yes got the boy screen several times too
---
Are you on PC? Are you running a custom ini file and forgot to update it after the patch?
---
Hardon mass scraps to ultrasite i think. If you have a heap of ultrasite then kiss that flux ingedient goodbye. Scrapping single items too quickly can be painful
---
Yeah I tried different receivers and barrels to no avail. I might need to play around with it more, I admittedly didn't try every part. But I did try to pick the parts that showed on the picture.
---
I‚Äôd rather die than use Prime Receivers. That‚Äôs too much of a grind for me.
---
I like power armor but what I truly hated was getting in and out of power armor all the time, I had to get in and out of my power armor all the time because I had to craft ammo cook food etc, sooo I built around vampire laser gat - also gave myself healing factor - this means I just save up super stims I get from time to time. I often have to sell them because they pile up. this almost entirely eliminates the need for crafting meds. when I run low and absoloutly must get more meds I slap on pharma farmer and hit up all the med supply boxes. I typically have 3 or 4 antibiotics and disease cures on me. generally speaking though disease cures antibiotics and superstims just happen through normal gameplay and I always seem to have excessive amounts of meds to sell. 
---
   I dont cook - I grow melons. I have herbivore mutation and keep green thumb perk on - melons give food and water. pick pick pick eat eat [eat. no](https://eat.no) boiling water no gathering firewood its noice. 
---
  I dont craft ammo I hunt robots at whitesprings or take workshops at power plants and farm fusion core generators. I enjoy the building process and I can do all of it without ever leaving my power armor. 
---
  essentially I only exit the power armor to sleep and play music if I think to do it, and to repair my laser gat with weapon artisian. 
---
   I need to write the lazy daves guide to playing fallout 76 my way. I have told this to a lot of people in many different ways. 
---
I do lose out on some damage and some food buffs. but I figure thats made up for because I spend more time fighting and doing and less time in crafting menues and getting in and out of my power armor. 
---
  I may not be minmaxed for damage but I can facetank the queen and the entire bog, I think I could actually solo the queen just barely in the time window but other people always show up . I know it would be really close if I did. 
---
   stabilize is realy nice and I would say that armor ignore is just to nice to pass up. I would also say I can tell a big difference in my grouping when I dont have it. I go from shooting scorchbeasts in the air with almost pinpoint accuracy to more of a shotgun affect.
---
Me and my friend have done Dolly Sods pretty much everyday since it started and neither of us have gotten a molerat. It makes little sense since it's not an insect and not encounter on the quest.
---
You‚Äôre 76?
---
I wonder why I can't ever pick mine for up.. Hmmm.
---
Lol.
---
Investigators Cabin always has wolves for me. I just did this there.
---
I feel like if they just do it once or twice it's to let you know they're there. Anything after that though is just being stupid.  Drop a nuke on their house.
---
On Xbox, pond near vault 76?
---
Is it really a bug?
---
Like a Home Depot
---
 I bought the Wolf Fedora for a reasonable sum, 15 caps. I really like. ;).
---
Demolition bumps up nuka nades.
---
Look on youtube. The fallout 76 backpack vids with atheletic course runs are the easiest. Backpack is worth a day or two. The backpack mods might take you two weeks to earn but worth it.
---
I miss the days of brahmin-tipping. What a riveting story.
---
PC, Charleston
---
I took pics I am going to update the main post with those tomporror. next attempt I am definately going after that black hat again. took note of where to find it this time.
---
Ya
---
I did those two and mammalogist. Mammalogist only took like 20 minutes for me. Might have been luck though.
---
Third one I did was Hunter.
---
The War Of Northern Egg-Rossini
---
*crucify me*
---
Dood idk.
---
Combine it with Demolition Expert &amp; Single Shot Rifle &amp; armour penetration perks for absolute maximum damage.
---
GT: Facepuncher85 I'm on most mornings.. rarely turn my mic on but on occasion I will.. I have a level 155 and a level 20
---
I just logged off :( I‚Äôll send you a DM with my username for next time though!
---
That would actually be an awesome gun for messing around in low level areas. I have a level 1 AA pipe pistol I use for that but I'd really like to find a quad ammo explosive pipe pistol because it'd be a hoot to splat level 1 scorched with.
---
I've never been able to pick it up, either. Sometimes it's really annoying cause you can't build on it so if you're rebuilding your camp you have to walk from whatever the closest FT point is until you've built that spot.
---
Yeah! Twist my nipples, I dare you! lol
---
What platform? I got 8 keycards but im on PC
---
Yes!!! This would be amazing for camps. I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve fast traveled to someone‚Äôs camp and Im suck in the foundation or underneath their entire camp.
---
These are awards for events.
---
I've seen it done with the very edge of welcome mats, but I'm not sure if that's just a way to move plants around, or a way to plant them anywhere.
---
I love cross-dressing.
---
Sorry mate I‚Äôm on Xbox forgot to write that in
---
Gang violence is way out of hand, i blame snapchat.
---
Almost every time I eat the occasional Noodle Cup.
---
I think thats a way to move them using dirt and the mat but thank you
---
I never get credit for getting the DNA no matter how many scorchbeasts I kill.
---
Nah its Fallout Book man. The teens are addicted to it
---
Lol,... durr fixing with edit :P
---
Ah well no worries. Best of luck to ya
---
Back in my day we used to shoot a mini nuke at the door and hope our mates were in, times change though dont they
---
Nice find, however cap prices are entirely based of charisma stats or the perks, so it may not show up for someone the same. Pure luck and keen eye.
---
It means you have a technical data in your misc that is associated with the brotherhood quest. Hand it in at camp venture to get rid of it.
---
Yep visual bug
---
Usedta you could put em on a camp fire but idk if that works still
---
What?
---
I had a guy doing this to someone at my weapons vending machine once. So I waited till the first guy was done and stored the machine before Mr Patience could use it. It was worth having to restock the thing.
---
I think you need to find one with the mod installed and scrap it
---
Need backbacks that are themed to the armor types too, like tanned brown leather, metal, robot, trapper etc.
---
Hmm I somehow never noticed. So they‚Äôre being tagged and released?
---
Seems at at least a few people care based on the responses to this thread. 
---
And companion apps aren‚Äôt a novel idea. Plenty of other games have them. 
---
Seems to me you just don‚Äôt like the idea of it and so you‚Äôre coming up with reasons it shouldn‚Äôt be done.
---
Back in my day we would put a firecracker in Uncle Joes toilet.
---
YouTube Miz Tracey does a tutorial on using the camp fire.
---
Who‚Äôs tagging them? O.o
---
I went into ATLAS once pacifying half of the gutsy bots. They were aggressive so they start killing one another.
---
Bot hack is very useful for silo runthrough. I once did it in under 15 mins running &amp; pacifying with just hazmat suit.
---
Oh... uncle joe used to put things in me in the toilet.
---
What's really funny, is that it's a simple keyword they had attached to all scrap like beer bottles that doesn't auto-scrap. The keyword was attached to bulk but when they went through and changed the mods auto-scrapping through crafting, they somehow also removed the prevent scrapping from bulk junk. Incompetence.
---
__Now i have seen it all...__
---
They just buffed the .50 cal to do more damage and with a perforating mag it‚Äôs definitely the higher one shot damage FYI
---
The elite do not carry their own things sa'
---
Thanks I somehow only noticed this. So does this mean someone is tagging and releasing sheepsquatch?
---
Do you not understand the problem with that? There shouldn't be a set of effects that are NEEDED to be sucsessful
---
Oh link ??
---
That‚Äôs pretty funny people found that. I want to know who‚Äôs tagging sheepsquatch!!
---
Lol @trapper
---
Can't help with underarmor, but I believe both the beam focusers are learned through scrapping and not plans
---
This would be great, however I'm not sure how you would select something if you don't already have it.  Ammo and junk would be easy, but say I'm looking for deathclaw hide and dont have it how would i post that i want to buy that item. 
---
Still, very much on board.
---
Tried 3 times today. Stuck on roof and opposite wall from keypad. Tried exiting armor and returning but it wouldnt let me place it. 
---
Very frustrating to go through all those fast travels, paying caps, and jumping through hoops and not to have anything available at end. 
---
PS Colonel Gutsy had a face ray like an Assaultron...AND was invisible. Very fun just swinging wildly until I connected.
---
 Not weight reducing as in the weightless perk, weight reducing as in they reduce a certain class of items weight in your inventory. With 5/5 weapon weight reduction pieces every single weapon (should) weigh 0.001. With 5/5 junk all your junk is weightless.
---
So basically you're the problem then. I mean yeah they caused it but all you need to do is not react.
---
This is almost step for step how I got that achievement to unlock my first backpack. Once I got on mic and spoke with the guy, he happily obliged, which I was grateful for. Found out he was from WV and just picked up the game despite being disappointed his town didn‚Äôt make it into the game. I gave him some stims, ammo and a gun or two when a level 200+ came by and we gave him some pointers. 10/10 interaction with other cool players.
---
Is the bomber jacket rare? I got it somehow and have no idea where it came from.
---
I got a disc case with a cardboard "CD" that had a key on it
---
Also why Purveyor is in caps, emphasizing my main correction.
---
I need someone to die for me too. It would probably help if I had a mic and could ask. Oh well, someone will die near me someday I hope.
---
You should have a flick through the known issues post Beth has on this sub. This issue is definitely a utility they intend to look into. Repair kits were the first utility, and they wanted to see how these impacted the world before releasing things like a fridge and ammo scrapping/bulking.
---
It depends a lot on what level you're at. I did it at quite a low level and the best options for me were archery, hunter and swimming, though mammalogist can be easy enough too.
---
You can put walls at the bottom and top of stairs using a roof to hang them 
---
Advanced power connector plan give you a thru wall and you can just build them on the ground and then put a wall over them 
---
You can use a half or single piece of floor to connect a support beam in more places
---
Possibly
---
What events?
---
Can we just pin one of these posts already? This has come up twice a week since mid beta when they pulled them from the game.
---
Oh I understand now
---
Beam focuser for both gatling lasers is a scrap mod with a 20% chance. Protective casual lining is apparently bugged and never drops. Shielded casual lining can only drop if you have Protective.
---
Low level legendaries already have their value boosted by the indiscriminating scrip exchange returns. Making them upgradable would just make the gear acquisition a tad brainless. Imagining the game becoming Uranium Fever farm 24/7.
---
upon the death of your target or completion of your quest. something that gives you 100 xp when it dies in adventure mode will pay out 120 in survival.
---
I think you nees to figure out how to pvp in the game. Bloodied builds die the most. U see them fall like flies during SBQ Events.
---
Is there a specific place to pick up a hazmat suit?
---
Yeah thats the only little problem i can see about it but maybe just like when you mark and object missing in a recipe? Something like that
---
Yup.  Luckily I'm a sneaky sniper.
---
ü§∑
---
For the love of god, allow a floor to snap to a foundation and a foundation to snap to a floor!
---
I have build ideas that just are not possible because my foundations at the edge of a cliff won't snap to a floor hanging over the edge.  I have to build a staircase up, add a floor, build another staircase down, to add a floor that lines up properly to the foundation pieces.  And then I can never delete the pointless balcony with 2 staircases.
---
Heaven forbid that I wanna build a foundation and then have stairs going down from it...
---
Wordshops have a fast travel mat and camps used to have them in the beta but they lost with the official release.
---
They really need to give them back to camps. The risk of spawning into a deathtrap or freefall is better than getting stuck in the foundation of half of the camps I FT to.
---
Ultracite is noticeably better, but the drawbacks far outweigh the benefits. Doing less damage but having a basically infinite amount of easily accessible ammo is better in the long run, vs having to find flux and make special ammo just for a few key circumstances.
---
I've seen two mq a few times before, only the 3 once.  Usually it's one and a few regular and maybe a few Kings.  Freakshow is technically lower mire so 100% their territory.
---
What you have is a prime nodded reviver. Ultracite lasers and lasers are separate weapons.
---
Yea but thats not what i mean. Two days ago when i left a survival server i had 14k xp. If i went  back into any survival server that day id still have the same amount 14k. But eventually without dying the xp resets but im not thinking that 14k xp applied because i would of ranked up again. Unless it takes more xp than im thinking to rank up another level.
---

fucking bethesda needs to get boycotted

Matchmaking!!!
---
"It's good and terrifying"
---
"Players shoot on sight"
---
I figure that's rather what makes it terrifying.
---
So I just need to make or find a lot of them. Ok. Now I just gotta figure out how to get the ultracite Gatling laser plan
---
I was a Athletic, Archery and Swimming guy...
---
you are currently sitting on a pool of xp - if you go to survival or adventure mode and do nothing that pool does not change. if you kill one thing in either mode it immediately adds xp to your pool. the survival just adds a little more. the xp only resets when you level. if you are missing 14k xp then it sounds like you had a rollback or something. 
---
the level up cost goes higher the higher your level is but I beleive it caps out at 50. I have no science or data to back that up specifically but I can say at level 248 it take a full lap around all the fissures killing all the scorchbeasts to get a level still. sometimes a little more sometimes a little less because of other spawn in the areas. it seems to have stopped getting any harder to level up. I have all the perks i want so i dont really try to level up specifically anymore so i am probably not the best person to ask on that.
---
The wants tab is a treat idea. Lol.

---
I bet I know what the secret it...
---
... It's that pre-war nail polish, ain't it?
---
I assume you didn't reinstall the game like I did.
---
It says ‚Äúported prime Gatling plasma‚Äù
---
Nope! Nothing like that. Just casual daily playing and  then suddenly yesterday they were gone.
---
There is also a single action revolver
---
LOL sounds like the best use of this annoying ass team interface for this game lol.
---
There some places in the bog. You can also find some in the second portion of any silo. You can find some in west tek. Though the former and latter are often broken and can be repaired at a workbench.
---
Hey, when I've been on for a while and seen no one around, someone coming guns ablazin' out of the clear blue is gonna startle me. I can't be the only one who does that.
---
Assassin's on weapons is weak. It's only a 10% buff. The 50% armor penetration of AA or the significant boost from Bloodied fad outclass it. Even TS does 25% extra against ALL enemies.
---
I wouldn't start a new character just for survival mode though, I don't have time for that, I will only ever run 1 character in this game before I just move on. I've spent enough time on this one character, I have zero interest in doing it all over again.
---
\+1 if they nailed it right
---
Reminds me of the hardcore perma death Multi User Dungeon text games I used to play.
---
Perma death might be too harsh for a game like Fallout 76, but certainly would be up for a harsher life in-game without the pvp
---
It's listed in the Cranberry Bog quest rewards, but I'm not sure if those are actually attached to any events.
---
I'm more so talking about extending an items usability. Like say you have a good wepon as far as it's Legendarys go, but it's only lvl 10, therefore basically garbage, it'd be nice to be able to bring it up to your level.
---
Maybe he means The North were lawbreakers and "had it coming" or something.  Slavery was law, and a major catalyst right before the war was the supreme court deciding that all Northern states had to support slavery and couldn't pass laws nullifying federal slavery law or the Constitution.  The law was immoral, but it was the law and teh south decided to secede because they wanted to follow the law and they felt that if there was no law then they'd start a new government of their own.  
---
The confederacy opened fire, that is not up for debate.
---
Hey mate, love the series!
---
I‚Äôd really like if you could have a look at my build and hopefully have it end up in one of your videos!
---
I‚Äôd also like to help out with the whole series in some way shape or form, sort of contribute anything I can to help it take off! 
---
Anyways add me up 
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 aswell, PSN: CaptainModrah
---
Sounds like Survival mode isn't for you then.
---
One of the main things not to do is go to your camp, always go to train stations for a crafting bench and stash
---
Aww, shucks! That‚Äôs my first real and/or suggested gold *blush blush blush*
---
Ever used one?  They're pretty powerful.
---
Yes. You are a marked individual at that point and you will be hunted. Returning "home" just makes it even more fun to try and get to you. And by "force closing" you are effectively cheating death and avoiding any penalty for playing pvp in the first place...
---
I would assume because rifle perks finally work with them now.
---
This is good to hear. I can never quite decide when I see a lower level if they‚Äôd like some help or if they‚Äôd prefer to keep the XP. I usually hop
---
In and help just enough to keep things off of them while they fight, but I‚Äôve always wondered.
---
My fianc√© just picked up an explosive junkies railway rifle. Any tips from anyone?
---
Do a lot of drugs.
---
You do realize the top 3 get marked on the map to encourage others to come kill you. You do know this right?
---
We‚Äôve asked for this so many times I hope they make it really special when we get it.  A whole farming quest line, greenhouses, planters, new crops.  I still like the idea of different fertilizers for different crops.   Maybe they can make the straw hat free and add hay bales to the atom shop.  Maybe a stable for our Brahmin.  Oh man I‚Äôm getting too excited.
---
Xbox here:
---
Infinite loading screen
---
Invisible enemies when respawn
---
crashing a lot
---
SBQ lag
---
and the list goes on...
---
Totally! It will allow a true trading from one camp to another, just like grahm!
---
It's Gra'ahm!
---
I'm not here to farm shit items. Get gud. I'm going to one-shot it.
---
I really dig this idea. I believe it would also allow for Bethesda to have an even easier time catching dupers this way.
---
Go to blackwater mine and hope uranium fever is going on or just hop in the mine to find out. Kill all the mole men. This one event should easily get you over the 1400k with lots of guns to scrap and repair all your stuff. If not got to the golf course and get all the cloths they sell for 27caps give or take. But this is just for your daily allowance
---
I do but I think the game, even on survival mode, shouldn't leave the players to lose that much value in exchanged. Losing some sweet aid items and junk can suck, but to lose the materials to craft half your home in a few seconds, just for not winning the exchange too?
---
That's balance?
---
I‚Äôm up for it, PSN: CaptainModrah
---
I like the idea, but would like to offer another suggestion to add to it. half the cost to upgrade that tier of script could be used for a chance to reroll that tiers trait. 150 for 2nd star reroll and 300 for 3rd star.
---
Me either. Gave up on reading any that aren't important to a quest
---
It's fun to destroy a players hard work? And like, a day or two worth of gathering divers materials?
---
I might be out of touch here, but still losing a bunch of aid items and junk vs losing a few days worth of work seems unbalanced even for pvp.
---
I 100 percent agree, the current leaderboard needs to change to kills only or not exist at all, the best work around at the moment is to suicide at camp.
---
This is both hilarious and correct. Unfortunately it‚Äôs not really worth doing all of the drugs. Captainnoob did a great video about this
---
https://youtu.be/Au6KEgDFFPM
---
A lot of these methods are for your daily cap limit. 
---
Haven‚Äôt seen any mention the market place.
---
Imo that‚Äôs where the real money is.
---
Finding legendary armor with Sentinel, Cavalier, or unyielding seem to do well. Weapons with the  Anti Armor Explosive or Bloodied explosive and a good 3rd roll grant an instant 25k or more on most market pages. 
---
Not that they have to be these god roll weapons either. There‚Äôs many combos people are looking for. 
---
I‚Äôve sold my fair share of items when in need of caps and stay close to max. 
---
Some people don‚Äôt like this method but it also allows me to not worry about lesser items such as plans, chems, lesser legendaries. Then I can just hand these out to new players in need or camp visitors etc.
---
Survival mode is a joke in this game. Don't bother with it. Just a bunch of people running around with meta builds and heavily duplicated equipment treating the game like team deathmatch even though the skill ceiling in this game is way too low for that kind of gameplay.
---
It is poorly thought out and poorly executed. Play adventure and you'll have much more fun
---
You don‚Äôt have to be a opossum scout to get the badges. I was still a tadpole and did the event and got 2 as a reward once.
---
I think the fact that they work with perks and that you have challenges that require them.
---
Jeeze thank you, that's my point exactly. It's not like my custom melee build stands a chance unless I reroll and find the same duped good roll items to paid with it.
---
Damn lucky, I can't wait til I get something good. Just mediocre at best loot for me so far
---
Trade subs?
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Since last patch, your base should be indestructible. However, if another player damages you while you are at your base, that indestructibility gets turned off and they are free to wreck havoc.
---
I recommend building a 4x4 windowless panic room at your base with necessary crafting tables/stash and locking it off. Explosive weapons should't be able to get to you as long as your walled off.
---
By the way, if anyone is selling a TSE one, DM me. Willing to buy / trade some stuff for it.
---
As long as you don't have multiple, then nothing to worry about
---
Wouldn't let me join.  What was there?
---
There was just a big post about this the other day. The guy tested it a few different ways and came to 5% increase up to 50% and you can miss a shot.
---
I have a Bloodied railway, Max level on Xbox who wants it?
---
Nah you're fine. Although I would personally dispose of or sell duped items if obtained, it ultimately isn't your fault.
---
Nothing unfortunately. I'll be nuking something else unorthodox tomorrow night. Add me if you'd like. I enjoy nuking dumb stuff.
---
If you are on ps4 ill come to you and take the items and turn them over to the proper authorities. If not keep the weapons theres no consequence and dropping the item or getting rid of its pointless. I have 1 gun thats duped and nothings happened to me. I may have other items idk, most of what i have is bought from others. A good item doesnt always mean its duped regardless of what most here say. If you were the one duping than you should worry otherwise enjoy your ill gotten items and know youll never get whats coming to you.
---
Dunno but I cant stop using it its so satisfying.
---
Yeah, prime = uses ultracite ammo, ultracite lasers = made from ultracite regular ammo and green lasers, can have prime receivers to use ultracite ammo too.
---
Thank you for clarifying how that works. I'll have to set something like that up. I wish the other players in the game didn't so overwhelming love destroying people's hard work.
---
Congrats!
---
Well you're right. In most cases, They should set the console graphics to medium, the XboneX and PS4 pros to high, and pc to ultra. In the case of fo76, consoles to low, better consoles to medium, pc to ultra.
---
I‚Äôve found several by just going to VTU. It might be easier to pick them up.
---
I will respond to people tomorrow at 3:00 PM EST.
---
start out with multiple low level cards for everything you need then expand on it later when perk points are more excessive.
---
Im lvl 270 something and I still prefer to use multiple cards with low rank for more allround build. I do have some maxed out cards but rarely use them cause when I tested it I didnt see a big enough damage increase for it to be worth losing the other stuff. bottom line is its up to you. :)
---
How about a way to scrap items that are stored?  I currently have a roof section with 3 turrets on it that cannot be placed because it always says there is something already placed/blocking.  So now instead of the max 10 turrets I can only place 7.
---
All right I‚Äôll try looking there for it but I‚Äôm still hell bent on finding the plans . It‚Äôs like getting the pie out of the vending machine . It‚Äôs hard to get but I still wanted it üòÇ
---
The strange elevator comes up from the end of Glassed Cavern. It only works one way.

Also, this is hilarious.

I wish i had seen him enough to learn his name properly :(
---
Perfectly (preserved?) understandable.
---
My mother-in-law count?
---
Yep. I got that eventually
---
I found most of them down in the vault area of VTU so that‚Äôs worth checking out.
---
Right on.  I've only dropped 3, one on Prime for the quest, Lewisburg and Charleston.  My next targets are The Palace of the Winding Path since it's technically outside and the super mutants should respawn, and then Hornwright Estate are as both the tall buildings may or may not be considered 'outdoors'. General's Steakhouse might work too.   I've seen some random ones lately; the Pumpkin House, Camp Adams, Berkley, Watoga proper and Top of the World.  Good work, we need some variety with the nukes.
---
Not on now, will try to remember to add you tomorrow, gt ThreeBicycle976.
---
TIL what TLDR was.. and the proper acronym for today I learned...forgive me
---
New to reddit. Just got it for the fallout 76 community.
---
ooh THATS what it was. I haven't been able to play for ages, and logged in over the weekend. Whilst exploring player camps I found one with stairs going up to build height and nothing but a floor placed like a diving board at the top.
---
Also I hate how I automatically thumbs up my own post.. like as if a stand up comedian applauds their own joke..
---
Found a plan on a shelf at Grafton Steel.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll check it out
---
Business is good when you sell things for reasonable rates, and make sure you only put stuff in your machines that people would want to buy (ie stuff that you yourself would want to buy).
---
Everybody wins.  Less grinding.  More enjoying.
---
On the note of Ammo .... yeah I'd like to sell bulk for less than 1 cap/round .... I tried putting half the rounds at zero and half at 1cap to see if the buyers would honour the honour system (ie. buy 1/take 1 free), but to no avail.  No honour when free ammo is up for grabs ...  l.o.l.
---
It‚Äôs probably more habit than anything. I just dropped 200 bone scraps the other day. No idea why I bother picking up bone other than by accident.
---
Unkillable mobs are a known bug. I‚Äôve had to leave a location because because I was swarmed by a mob of unkillable radroaches.

.....Where do you think the Ash comes from? (The inactive mines?)
---
Camp fire way was patched a while ago. But if you team up with someone that has them, you can blue print it.
---
This game is so weird sometimes.
---
I got a combat shotgun with AA and Exploding yesterday, but mine was level 50 :-)
---
Hahaha great minds think alike!
---
it's ok, no one else sees it, it's just sort of a visual clue to make it easy to tell which posts you made.
---
Are you American? It‚Äôs a national pastime.
---
But my name is there. I've been un-thumbing it cause I think its ridiculous.
---
It hangs sometimes, but it's never been a big issue other than that one time.
---
Unfortunately that did not. It also would not let me uninstall it, so I had to just delete the folder. I wanted it on another drive anyways so I redownloaded it and reinstalled it on another drive. Works fine now.
---
Ah okay, haven‚Äôt seen one of those yet.
---
I know. In all the history of our planet we are the worst. We are terrible. No other country out terribles us. None. Period.

Bethesda, testing your commitment - "Would you die for this backpack?!"
---
i just got lucky and was put in a server with 12   lvl 100+ people doing it and we saved all 3 and I got the diffuser plan. It's the first time i've been on one where all 3 lived.
---
Considering the benefits, it does seem like an accessory that is to die for!
---
It sort of works in the heap, they don't scale up though. If you're just doing it for scrip, or for specifically low level gear it's useful.
---
I would pay 15K for it assuming you still had it and didn‚Äôt want it.
---
Meanwhile me and 15x hunter weapon
---
Huh I didn't even think of that but yeah it would. Just have it record the info anyway, and the ledger acts as an option to view the stats.
---
its a known glitch that comes and goes with the patches.
---
Except Bethesda already has the ledger. I read awhile ago the top ten list of sales. Like what has sold the most. So they know what's going where. Otherwise yes I agree a good idea for the player
---
I did try this one. Nothing.
---
hey I know that guy.
---
Tried it
---
i am on xbox and learned it immediately lol
---
Sorry that didn't work, glad you got it going. Hopefully you dont have anymore of the same problems again.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt start
---
Oh nvm then.
---
Buy orders? Yeah I think this would be really good, like I feel like it would be great for advertising to the whole world, like if you hovered over a camp and it gave you what the player is looking for item and price wise. This would naturally attract attention to your camp and get more people buying your products, while you get the materials you need.
---
I honestly think that we just need a marketplace of sorts, like a player run full ass market place for us to barter and trade at instead of having to go to each individual camp to buy something. Like have little set up stalls that players can own that they can use to sell items from their vending machines.
---
Thanks everyone for all your suggestions. I have a few more spots to try now.
---
How much?
---
I once nuked the area north of watoga where that lookout tower and ranger outpost are, thinking I'd get hella ghouls. It was just robots. Had some super mutants and a scorchbeast spawn. Watched them kill each other, and that was it lol.
---
I‚Äôm fairly sure I tried this one. No hurt in going again I suppose. 
---
I just find it funny how the teapot ALWAYS had wolves. Always, always, always. I‚Äôve done that quest three times now looking for the wolf to attack the pipes like always before and none. So strange.
---
For goodness sake, you're right. The dev's will do as they will. Come up with new ideas, some original thoughts. That is when I see dev's respond the most.
---
This game is awesome. There are a lot of defects that could be worked on, but from what I've seen it has been non-stop updates and improvements. Like enjoy the fact that its being improved basically nonstop .. sorry y'all rant over
---
Like someone else said, it might be habit. I see the word "disarm" and I feel compelled to oblige.
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
Holy crap, THAT is why that one shop had a random staircase to heaven... I thought it was just a part of his wierd layout, his whole base was weird!
---
Its actually very powerful, if you could get every addiction possible it would be a 120% damage increase(10% for each addiction) but since its pretty easy to lose additions its not worth it.
---
All kidding aside. Nukes bad. M'erica learned. We said "nobody else do nukes after what we did"! "Nukes are bad"! Everyone else said "we won't make nukes". But they try and they do.
---
I was there for sure before looking around.
---
Don‚Äôt think I tried that one.
---
Just one at a time. It's not a marathon game. Enjoy
---
This would really be a great way for us to run our vending effectively. Like I have zero clue what prices do and don't work, if we had a ledger that showed what items were being sold and at what prices for our own vendor, we could more easily focus on certain resources and adjust prices to fit the demand.
---
There is a post about vending and stash limits at least once a day. Do these people join the sub specifically to complain about stash? Otherwise youd think they wouldve seen the exact post the day before.
---
I literally joined reddit 30 days ago just for fallout. And this seems to be the number one thing I hear
---
What the heck is a God tier?
---
They want to to get mad and shoot back so they can "own you with their sick skills" and take your junk. Had a dude who kept killing my brahmin. I smacked him with my crossbow and he mowed me down, then started messaging me calling me trash pvper.
---
Why not? Its a game about learning to increase your ability to survive in the game üò™. You want this to be mario world or something? Lets just keep everyone at lvl 1 with basic armor and pupe pistols. Thatd be really fun.
---
Well welcome young one. Id recommend r/FO76filthycasuals for low sodium Fallout content.
---
You can turn them off in the pip boy to focus one one or two at a time. Much better for me that way at least. It‚Äôs too easy to get sidetracked.
---
I am on pc and looking for partners, what is your id?
---
I can confirm I have acquired the weapon mod you can attach for a 'Blackpowder rifle large bayonet' from the Phillip Battlefield Cemetery shop.
---
what system
---
"Low sodium" ???
---
Become friends with the data tab. You can shut off all unwanted missions and focus on one. Also don't worry about completing any story missions till around lvl 50, unless you just really need access someplace.
---
Less salt. Less bitching and toxicity and more people just enjoying the game.
---
Im lvl 279 760 hours, still no raider shielded plan
---
Isn't it east of Watoga?
---
Yes but they're kind of heavy.
---
Got it.   Thanks kind sir.
---
Some weapons go 25 35 45, others 30 40 50.  Depends on the weapon type.
---
The plans are for a mod to the underarmor of BOS type
---
Might be a platform specific bug. This worked fine on PC version for me. Was using an unmodified 105mm ProSnap Deluxe camera with film. Did you make sure the enemies were in the photo for their names to display on the right hand side? Even if they fidget at the last moment to make the name disappear on taking the shot.
---
General's Steakhouse is a bust - did a nuke there along with RobCo and the only thing of note was the cornfield next to it. Not enough enemies spawn around there to get the mats needed to stabilize the raw flux you pick up though...
---
Read the Patch Notes does 9.5, Bethesda stated you HAVE to be a Opossum Scout to get Opossum Badges.
---
Okay guess it wasn‚Äôt patched yet when I did it
---
Could look into razorgrain flour. Ez 2 farm at your camp, or at any of the farms in the forest. 60 ap regen.
---
Saw a guy wearing it with the shovel back pack, and it looked really good. Personally I've thought that most of the plague rider skins looked a bit ropey compared to the pictures in the atom shop, but the coat looks really good!
---
What's your level? My alt is 22 and I need it to.
---
Ah nvm, seems it is bonus ap, not regen. Sorry
---
Didn't you know? The meetup is in the bathroom at Morgantown airport.
---
Same. PSN: morealivetndead
---
Spoilers I guess? Okay, so when the imposter sheepsquatch first popped up, it would drop plans for the salvaged assaultron head (SAH). If you already knew the plans it would say you unlocked the one you bought. So, they had to make it a separate item so they could still sell it in the shop since it unlocked on a lot of accounts.
---
Ugh, how are you going to get a weightless Tesla to sell me if you keep rolling 2 star boxes?
---
Not a bad idea actually üëç
---
I'm lvl 39, on right now if you're available :)
---
Hey, i'd be online in a few minutes, I'll send you a friend request asap.
---
Yes. Especially when they're taking their sweet $\*&amp;ing #($\*# time putting the Mothman and Megasloth backpacks in atom store. 
---
I use Wildman Outfit most of the time as well so the backpack is super glued to my back.
---
I too would like to see list of the top accepted god tier weapons. It just means good weapon, or armor, with a really good or overpowered combination of effects. Before the patch a few months ago, TSE (two shot explosive) weapons were the god tier meta weapons. Now it's bloodied explosive harpoon guns similar devastating weapons.
---
*Strong liked that*
---
Not a 3 star.  Not god tier.
---
yes.
---
This. And it's listed in the miscellaneous, not junk. Junk cameras are good to scrap crystal to turn into films. Prosnap deluxe can only be repaired to a working camera. I think some people believe they cant find them because they look at the junk section. I created an alt, got the tourist's at level 10, by level 20 I already had piled 7 deluxe (I dropped at whitespring station as I couldn't sell them and in no mood to collect cameras)
---
Is it boosted?
---
Ok awesome. Thanks a ton man. Do you need it as well?
---
For lead you should use the excavator power armor and head to Lucky Hole Mine.  With the Power Armor, you can collect so much more lead ores.  Then you need acid, to craft lead scrap.  You'll get more hundreds of lead.
---
Then, of course use Ammosmith 2 and Super Duper 3 to get the most ammo.  Use Super Duper for the lead scrap as well.
---
And some items have like a 20 hour respawn time.
---
Serendipity still kicks in for fall damage though ...
---
I wish I could add my very specific 3\* armor requests to it.
---
RAIDER THEMED CAMP ITEMS
---
Dammit. I wanted to make a milk of magnesia reference but it's pepto bismol that's pink.
---
Got an assassin's, +50% vats, 10% when aiming one yesterday, and I can't remember the exact number, but in modded it's damage was still way higher than my bloodied handmade. It's great in vats, but the ammo is heavy.
---
I heard that they will remove legacy weapons, that‚Äôs easy to do. With duped is hard, probably all of us got some without knowing.
---
... There is.
---
Take it off.
---
\*poof\* not showing any more.
---
Server hopping is a pretty good way to get stuff.
---
But for lead, I prefer to go to the Lucky Hole mine with Excavator Power Armor. The Lucky Hole mine has a lot of Lead Deposited, and when wearing a full suit of Excavator Power Armor, you get twice as much ore every time you gather ore from a deposit. You'll need Acid to turn that Lead Ore into Lead Scrap. Make sure to equip Super Duper when processing the ore, so you have a chance to get more. 
---
My favorite way to farm plastic is to kill Super Mutants, and scrap their Laser weapons with the Scrapper perk equipped. Killing Super Mutants also gives you a lot of Gunpowder, which you'll need when crafting those shotgun shells.
---
Raiders have always been cowards.
---
Also does it when reading a treasure map while in the pip boy menu. While dropping some treasure maps for a trade the schorched earth event popped up, and in my haste trying to drop all the maps i accidentally opened one and the darn thing froze. All 200+ treasure maps gone.

You might get luckier than being called a fascist or a nazi by obvious fucktards.

Yeah. Data tab has main/side/event/daily tabs to give you an idea what you have to do and what is optional.
---
Fallout 76 is a game, not a political platform, amigo.
---
30 mm?
---
The idea of it exists
---
They could just add it to the personal terminal.
---
Yes! Seen this happen at least twice. It's pretty amusing.
---
If I'm being honest, the bugs drive me to not die more than dying itself. Dying is no biggie - it's losing everything thanks to a disconnect or lock up... thus I'm a life saving, auto-stimming, rejuvenating punk.
---
Hey, it's good and no, got it done already. Starting the game right now, where do you wanna meet? üôÇ
---
Should still be on, hit me up on PSN!
---
No plans on campire or operation tidy. They all drop on Dolly Sods.
---
go to west tek and kill super mutants - youll get legendaries more xp and lots of lasers to scrap into plastic.  
---
for led i go into the gyms and each of the silos and the prison. that's usually more than enough. no need for server hopping at all for me usually.
---
Carnivore &amp; Herbivore serums require bone.
---
the Red and Black one is the Atom Cats Paintjob, unsure if it is in the game legitly yet
---
I died in Grafton going to get that pa suit. On my way back up the stairs i looted a super mutant and picked up bones... The got blasted off the railing by a missle launcher mutant on the roofs.
---
Long story short 3rd attempt i went to get my loot but it was just the bones i picked up on the second attempt. Doh.üòß
---
Seriously, bought 25 not thinking about it since they were cheap... didn't realize why the owner gave me a heart emoji till I tried fast traveling.
---
Always trying to claim it's user error as opposed to a bug lol.
---
Erm, yeah it is. It saves us/me the time of doing it.  
---
That's PvP for you, dont like it? Adventure mode exists.
---
Probably Atom store...
---
Thanks. I‚Äôll keep this in mind
---
I learned the hard way...do not use in close quarters fyi...mega oof
---
Just like the password from Ecology.
---
Just joined your world but it won't let me invite you to a team
---
4 reasons I think: they can now be explosive (added recently), they now work with rifleman perks (also recent), they have a natural stagger effect without using tank killer, and they are just cool.
---
I get the feeling its part of a future release; the interloper seems like its part of something unfinished like the Arktos Pharma building used to be. But i also would love more cult stuff. The cult outfit and mask is what I usually have my character wear
---
Junk comes and goes, but the XP you get from reclearing that area is forever.
---
That sucks man, I'm sorry.
---
Guessing you're talking about west tec ha? Yea, that's infuriating. I dont even bother going inside anymore when I farm that place... I just go around killing the ones outside. You still get plenty legendaries just by server hopping for them.
---
Yeah, but why then does it drop when I load into a game or fast travel, but then not let me pick it back up?
---
Have cannibal on 
---
Eat downed player 
---
Fell better
---
Yeah I‚Äôm still learning how to survive. Only level 48. When I loaded back in not only did I have to server jump 3 times due to my camp being in a popular area but on my last successful jump everything outside respawned level 68 from a recent player being in the area. Just fast traveled home and shut it down. Armor broken, chems deminished, junk lost, spirit broken. I‚Äôll try again tomorrow.
---
Just added you up. Plus I found the easiest spot to do it. A small stream infested by mole rats, easier than whitespring' ghouls.
---
I'll take what the hell I want! Don't worry because you'll get it all back in five minutes.
---
I just wanted to see what the secret was with the mutants in the tanks at the end lol. I got a glimpse but that was the area I died in so I‚Äôll have to clear it again. I doubt I‚Äôll ever go back in after that.
---
Shhhh... I want more vendor specific workshop items.
---
Well "your friend" will be doomed to eternal 76 bad karma. 
---
They should make survival bad sports lobby and banish all dupers there.
---
The trouble with popular locations is that they're popular. For plastic, I'd recommend finding some lesser plastic stacks and dropping in whenever you're nearby. Morgantown HS is nice when it's untouched, but usually it's been cleared out. Incidental plastic looting and laser rifle scrapping can also get you a long way.
---
Get the fireproof perk. Level 2 and my AAE .50 cal do not kill me.
---
Personally I think the only pvp that should exist in adventure mode is a duel system that plays out exactly like Borderlands 2. You "slap" a player and they get a notification that if they "slap" back then pvp will activate. A 3 second timer counts down and both players are allowed to have at it. This duel doesnt not allow aggro to extend to teammates and cannot be initiated from mutations. It can only extend to enemy teammates if you attack them directly while also on a team yourself, but non-explosive weapons with an explosive effect and mutations dont count. This prevents solo players from getting jumped by hidden teammates or grief teams and ensures that teams can still duel each other if desired. 
---
As for workshops, I think a better solution for adventure mode is to allow the first player the option to claim it. Any additional players who want ownership can opt to buy in for co-ownership at a reasonable price. This cost has a limit that wont reach more than 500 caps and is based on how much the original owner has invested in building structures. The fee is split between the original owner and whoever the 10% of vendor revenue goes to. After the first co-owner buy in, the fee is split between all owners per new buy in. Perhaps a limit on the amount of owners per workshop. 
---
The first owner will have the only power to remove items built in the workshop, but all co-owners can add defenses, crops, mineral/junk machines, etc. This change would mean all goods produced from the workshop are inaccessible without ownership, but are shared, instanced loot for owners. This encourages team work for workshops and can help stimulate the player economy on servers. If the owner scraps a structure or defense made by a co-owner then half of the mats are returned to the original builder. On the other side, the first owner will find their junk producers give slightly more mats or increase the rate in which the mats are produced. 
---
So what happens when something you need is at a workshop that is at an ownership limit? Well, I supposed a buy out system could be implemented, in which your buy in is the normal fee plus half. The half is split between remaining owners, and the full fee is given to the owner being bought out as a severance. The original owner cannot be bought out, but co-owners can opt into the buyout via a setting. This way co-owners can't just be removed unless they allow that option for themselves.
---
 I realize some would absolutely hate this idea, but I honestly believe that outside of consensual dueling between solos and teams, pvp has no place in adventure mode.
---
Literally just add a log for purchases for that session. I'm sick of missing what I sold...
---
He's not the duper? Soo? Uh ok. He bought a gun and found out it was duped
---
Good eats....if I could walk 2 steps without the laser guy going to town on me from a million miles away.

That‚Äôs a good gun? I do melee so I just sell the stuff I get like that. Oops
---
And please no, gta v is bad enough don't bring ANYTHING from that shit storm here

Yea it is tough inside if you're a low level. You're best relying on sneak crits in there and picking rm off one by one... muties are dumb ha! Just dont let them all rush you at once.

It's a joke. Lol

You used to be able to add some plants on top of the potted plants, not sure if that has been patched out too.

I guess it‚Äôs subjective.

Every good cuisine has a good dish or ten, but also abundant shitty chefs.  If you rule out an entire genre, you're the only one losing out.

Might want to try this:
---
- go to your stored items in build mode
---
- find and store the blueprint ("R" key on PC, look at the bottom of your screen to figure out)
---
- the parts of the blueprint are now stored individually and can be placed/scrapped
---
Hope that helps ;)

It's from all the nuking we have done in the last few months

Ah yeah sorry, playing with a buddy right now.  I appreciate the follow up!
---
Buy them from me lol, or make them
---
Do you use any chems and do you addict of it? This can cause - intelligence. 
---
Intelligence have impact so many thing in the game. example.: durability of crafted items; also decreases the number of words in the Hacking mini-game
---
I think I actually already have one, I‚Äôll check when I‚Äôm on later. If your not kidding I might sell it to you for a good price :)
---
i think you answered your own question...its pvp.  Its also live, and the owner loses all their materials , etc. 
---
signed,
---
captain obvious (esquire)
---
Probably taking the munitions factory
---
Make with ammocraft perk card and super duper perk card.
---
To find... maybe supermutants have a few dozens on them. Not much.
---
How much you selling them for.
---
And dependant on your SPECIAL and perk cards and Aid buffs also. Play how you want, I say
---
I have 650 I‚Äôll do for 1/2 apiece
---
It is, I still need to level up my explosive perks though. And also it‚Äôs making my x box lagging like crazy, but it‚Äôs worth it
---
I guess but fuck dude dripping n bombs cause I smoked em gimme a break it's a game. I've never reported people in my life but this was wrong. How tf do I even report em on psn for this shit. I won in game sense but verbally I've never heard something like that even in a cod 4 lobby.
---
Deal
---
I have a spare one I could sell you for 2k.
---
let it roll off your back.  you know they are prob just pissed their mom didnt buy them their daily allotment of mountain dew tonight.
---
dunno what else to say besides....its a game.  if a player can do it, it's a known action/reaction, it's a part of the game.  
---
I was super butthurt when I was level 15 and some 100+ levels striked my camp over and over and...over.
---
Plans drop from cranberry bog events and they drop from scorchbeasts rarely.
---
Saw like 2 other since release, regular ultracite laser plans are on watoga vendors though.
---
 this is one of the multiple reasons I stopped teaming up with people as much, also I am going to purge my friend list because I suspect a friend got me killed on purpose just for laughs. not sure but I am happier just people watching without being included in the group anyways. not much of a joiner. I also find the team joining and exiting mechanics annoying and I do not like the way the audio works with swapping in and out of team and groups wanting me to go into discord etc. pretty much peeps are gonna have to talk to me in area chat or not at all. to be honest 90% of my friend list we just all do our own thing and don't do things together anyway. I mean why put a tag on my character for people to possibly exploit to find me on servers ??  how useful is my friend list anyway? usually my friends just want things from me. I do have friends that like to try and gift me things but I do not like to take things. social aspect? when I get a chance to play I do not like to chit chat or socialize much. just like in real life once I get past greeting stage into the idle chit chat stage I have to go. fuck that sitting around just talking crap. I have things to do and if you aren't specifically part of my next project / agenda the talking is just a distraction I would rather live without, and its not that I dislike people. love people. people are great for the most part. I just don't idle well. brain and body both rebel. As for the guys that griefed. Always have to have that 1 % show up in any group and be a cunt.
---
Actually I do use that as a backup and though I said ‚Äúregen‚Äù in the original post I was really referring to instant AP refill, which each of the other mentioned food/drink items do.
---
Canned coffee is great because it never goes bad. I noticed it is one of a variety of about 10 loot-tabled items that will spawn when using the ‚Äúcan do‚Äù perk. I hit every garbage can I pass while doing whitesprings runs and usually end up with 3-5 per run.  Since there are only 10ish possible ‚Äúcan do‚Äù items that spawn, you see it fairly often.
---
The flour is nice too because it doesn‚Äôt expire, but the thing is 60AP is kind of a last resort level instant AP item since I‚Äôd have to use 3 or 4 to fill my bar up.  
---
Honey and sugar bombs do 60 instant AP as well, they are other backups that don‚Äôt expire too.  I use the clean rad-free sugar bombs to eat, as the dirty ones with rads are the ones used for crafting sweet rolls (+3 charisma, good when buying from vendors) and for the sunshine oil
---
So 325 will get all I got
---
What platform do u play on?
---
2 - 3 k etc was requiring one
---
Pc
---
I work my ass off play this game and take shit. I enjoy that for real I enjoy survival I enjoy adventure but if I dare take the steel yard I'm a ucking worthless igger that just gets slammed and for real fuck people that say it's not a problem it's a pvp area you lose and continue to lose get over it don't call me a igger and don't antagonize  me it's not right I could care less about it but fuck those fags. I can't believe the one time I gotta report someone I cant. The south will rise again dude and you can fuck your sister don't worry
---
Am I the only one that doesn't get a hard on for explosive weapons? I'd be selling that thing instantly.
---
Ayyy thats my camp
---
Excavator armor .. Lucky Hole Mine for lead ore &gt;&gt; Garahan Mining HQ for iron ore
---
Think it's like rape and pillage during medival times. Is it allowed? Yes, no one's stopping you. Is it a dick move? Yes. Are you an asshole? yes
---
if you were the one that cleared out the locations you are on cool down from re looting stuff again. they did that so people couldn't just hop around and have infinite junk
---
I can only laugh at this and I apologize.   I role play as a raider. Got scarecrows, bone chimes and those new bone decorations all over.  Even built a crap shack.  With that being said, if you‚Äôre playing as a raider, you can‚Äôt be complaining about things like that.  It‚Äôs not fern raider-like.
---
I got a nocturnal explosive 50 Cal yesterday
---
Wow.  You are a legit psychopath.  I was just trying to help.  Or wait, were you just wanting to force innocent people to listen to your self-induced drama?  You don't seem to want constructive critism, or any grounded, sane advice at all...
---
Speaking about reporting.....
---
I haven‚Äôt gone after the laser because I hear it‚Äôs not that great.
---
Dude report all you want I heard a racist rant I've never thought I'd hear in my life I've played games for 15+years and never reported anyone these people need a report.
---
Don't deserve to be called a igger though
---
It worked... something. I took a photo of a Radtoad, alive and dead, still, reloading before. I don't know what did the trick but thanks all!
---
you are a parasite.
---
But OH so necessary to stabilize flux. And flux is important for the best mods and serums.
---
proof?
---
Stick it in your vendor machine for around 2k and see if it sells that‚Äôs my judgment on weapons 1k for each good star
---
You're insane to think I've infected you.
---
your taking such heated offense and freaking out is just as racist...and you are a homophobe to boot.  real cool guy.
---
If my ps4 wouldn't record at 5sec a pop I'd be good to roll now I'm just hopping servers ripping workshops
---
No
---
Yeah just getting into using flux. High rad fluid is eluding me.   I cringe when I think all the rad fluid and glowing mass I didn‚Äôt loot or sold to a vendor.
---
I don't care if you're gray or purple if you call me a igger and scream it in your mic after I take your workshop screw you.
---
Make a small camp and move it between acid and lead deposits...or farm lead while aquiring gunpowder/acid.
---
I completely see where you are coming from with not joining teams, but I play with a pretty loyal and long group of people, and we tear it up pretty regular together. Also, a few of them are ones who took me in and taught me the ropes when I was a wee lad in the FO76 world, so there is no way I wouldn‚Äôt want to play with them.
---
Don't play race card to justify yourself
---
I'm getting on soon GT: TheFooly64
---
Gatling one is decent enough.
---
I have not had that problem, it‚Äôs totaling correctly for me. I sold a bunch of stuff yesterday and it was nice to see my caps total coming back up after a few large purchases :)
---
I'm on ps4
---
Do your 3* enemies actually drop 3* legendaries? Mine never do. I think I‚Äôve received two 3* legendaries out of many many killed.
---
Server hoping is the way forward, as I do it all the time going for the lead for some bullets, but you need to remember the 20 hour respawn.
---
Since lead is usually in barbell variety, they are instanced loot and visible to other players, so will need to respawn if taken.
---
Yep,  hunter too. It's much easier.
---
Good read, would probably agree with most of your points too.
---
Not sure i get the appeal of #8 or #9(your level comment specifically).
---
For me PvP is about killing everyone and proving you're the best. It's about the rivalry and competitiveness. Destroying someone's camp doesn't really serve a purpose in my opinion. You already killed them, essentially proved you were better and took their loot. Isn't destroying their camp just a waste of time? When you can instead be hunting for your next kill.
---
In #9 you mention level doesn't matter. Well that's just lame. How can you prove you're the best when you're level 100+ and killing level 5 players. Isn't that just child's play? Like shooting fish in a barrel and no fun at all. What sense of accomplishment do you even get from that?
---
Which led to this conclusion I found: script "one shot" is really a garbage mechanic after the novelty wears off. 
---
See: FO4, ME andromeda, etc.
---
The French if I recall.
---
Well!??? What did you name your new pet!???
---
i love it.  i want to come visit it!
---
What about the event, leader of the pack?
---
Steve.
---
I lack creativity
---
Someone might buy it but not for a huge fortune.  Medics is not so good on the dragon cause that thing loads so slow and has horrible rof.  Explosive on the other hand is great.  But really for a low rof gun like that instigating, 2 shot, aa, and of course bloodied are the most in demand.  A bloodied explosive the dragon will sell all day every day and twice on sundays and you can probably trade it of something that suits your build.
---
Steve is a great name
---
No, there should be a variety of end game armour sets that are viable and fun, people should not be locked to sentinel's/cavalier just because they'd be useless otherwise
---
So to start off with just do level 1 of the damage and then invest into other perks?
---
patently false. backpacks have existed as mods to bethesda games as long as bethesda have made 3d games - the idea of backpacks are nowhere close to being new, neither in the game, nor in real life.
---
I'd sell that for between 1500 and 2k. The explosive bonus is nice but that medics bonus is not really feasible with a long loading weapon like the dragon, so really you're paying for the boom bonus. If that was instigating you'd be looking at a 5k+ rifle realistically. But as is I'd figure 750 for the dragon, 1K for the explosive, 250 for the medics (2,000) but then you almost have to knock 10% off because black powder fans are few and far between and that dragon is taking up shave that you can use for bigger ticket items. So let's say 1750-1800 and if it doesn't move in a couple of days take it down to 1500.
---
With the green thumb perk.  üòâ
---
Is it just me or is it SO hard to actually come up with a weapon name that doesn‚Äôt suck/just not work?
---
I believe a lot more players would use this legit than to torment others.  I think the pros out weights the cons for sure.  I could be missing something in the argument though.
---
Maybe some players will find ways to spawn you into rad water, and you won't be able to fast travel?  Or can you fast travel in rad water, I forget. &lt;\_&lt;  
---
Just trying to think of reasons why this isn't already a feature for camps.
---
Just gotta say, whoever that new player was he or she should've tried fallout 4 first as a warm up for fallout 76. That's what I did and the 8 month experience from fallout 4 helped me level up fast in fallout 76 and become a pro.
---
That'd be funny, I guess üòÖ
---
Me and my wife used stairs and single floor tiles to build a platform to jump into a shallow pool of water then revived each other. Definitely nice to have a build in pal.
---
you asking why people get mad at being ganked is like me asking you why you would care about being n bombed. its a public online game people are going to say mean things, why are you being so sensitive, you can always block them if they're hurting your feelings, just like they can always not take shops and avoid pvp. they got mad cause you killed them you say ." its a pvp area." they say mean things and hurt your widdle feelings I say its a game. block them, server hop, move on with life its that easy. maybe try fortnite. the pvp in 76 is stupid and broken.
---
hehehehe I hate that lol.
---
Nice got my first god drop tester day a AAE 10mm Less Vats Cost Pistol
---
Let's talk about those moist knees of yours.
---
I was clearing out General's Steak House with a friend a while back. We did the roof last, and when we were blasting the mutants up there one of them shouted "Run Away! Run Away!" and the just dipped off the edge of the roof. I'm talking booked it, didn't even jump down or stop. Ran full speed off the top, landed on the lower overhang and then on the ground and kept making for RobCo.
---
Bingo
---
Yep it does. Both twisted muscles and talon also work for unarmed which is pretty sweet
---
yeah I am sure they will eventually make a no pvp at all mode and the "leet pvp" crowd will have to figure out another way to grief people. always that 1%. fn hate em.
---
Pricing suggestions are spot on.  Are you on xbox? Might be interested in it.
---
one of the possum challenges is about collecting bones.
---
It's been around for ages. It doesn't consume the ammo thankfully. Imagine losing 250 ultra 50cal rounds every relog you forgot to unequip the gun.
---
It's a pain in the ass for long reload guns (harpoon, for example)
---
This is my big ticket item frankly I'm basically like a ragtag I avoid all fighting until absolutely necessary this is literally my only legendary besides my chest plate and main weapon
---
Mine was dead when I logged in today. dunno why, saw no evidence of a struggle and I was in the log in screen so its not like a player could have killed him from me pvping yet. I dont know that I will tame anymore. they kinda suck at staying alive.
---
It's a Bethesda game, clip is a more fitting word.
---
I have some tokens if part with, but if I might ask: are you looking for the Camden mascot outfit? Because I have it and would sell it to you. You could skip the token grind....PSN: ParzAttacks
---
Currently level 180 doing a bloodied stealth commando build with vats critical a - unfortunately I didn't know that it was important to stick to one build to be a pro at the start of playing fallout 76, so I changed my build heaps of times - first wanted to be slugger, then shot gunner, then heavy weapons... It was all over the place. Finally decided to be a stealth commando with vats after watching some of captain noob's videos. 
---
All I want you to know, person who is new to fallout 76, stick to one build in fallout 76 or you will end up still swapping your perks at level 120 like I did. I recommend you to do a strength build because you will be able to effectively use melee weapons, shotguns and heavy weapons. I did a stealth commando build because I liked the build's versatility,stealth element (stealth is so good in this game!) and effectiveness in taking down powerful enemies easily. A strength build is the best endgame build though because you can conquer nuke zones and Scotch beast queen fights and obviously everything else.
---
How much for the costume
---
Scorch beast sorry
---
For the second legendary effect there are:
---
VATS critical shots do 50% more damage
---
25% increased fire rate
---
Bashing damage increased by 40%
---
10% increased damage while aiming
---
Bullets explode for area damage
---
\+33% VATS hit chance
---
50% limb damage
---
Unless you run a VATS build, 2 of those 7 effects are useless to you. Bashing damage is of course beyond negligible. 50% limb damage is not straight up more damage against limbs, but instead increases how quickly you'll cripple a limb, but perks work fine for crippling, so it's kinda pointless and way less of a benefit than additional damage. 
---
So you other options are 25% increased fire rate, 10% increased damage while aiming (and apparently you don't actually have to ADS to gain the bonus, you just have to have the weapon out), and explosive rounds, which is 20% more damage from the effect. 
---
Depending on the weapon, additional fire rate isn't ideal or worthwhile. A minigun doesn't need more fire rate, it needs more damage per round to be more efficient. If you put fire rate on a hunting rifle, the fire rate is so low to begin with that the bonus hardly has any notable effect, so it's useless. So something that's not super slow and not super fast can benefit from additional fire rate. 10% more damage is just 10% more damage and isn't bad, but explosive is simply better with 20%, so it's not the best you can get. Outside of a VATS build, having explosive rounds as your secondary effect is the best effect there is in most cases. Also, the reason why TSE weapons are decent is because the second round is dealing 25% more damage, and the explosive effect applies to both rounds, so it's an additional 20% and 20%. The effects also scale off your base damage, so if you buff the base damage, you buff the effects as well.
---
It's not about the weapon having explosive rounds, it's just the best effect you can get for that second legendary effect (in most cases).
---
Melee for example has 50% limb damage, 40% increased swing speed, 40% more attack power damage, and Reflect 50% of damage while blocking. 50% limb damage isn't worthwhile. Reflecting damage that scales with the enemies damage has clear issues, and if you have damage reducing perks, chances are that you're just going to reflect 50% of the damage that was dealt to you after is was already severely reduced from perks and blocking, so it's kinda shit if that's all true (I'm assuming that's how it works). 40% attack power damage can be good but does require AP, while 40% increased swing speed doesn't, and even the slowest melee weapons get a great benefit from swinging faster, and it's simply the best effect in most cases. 40% faster swing speed is just better.
---
N bombs are heavily nerfed, doing ZERO damage.  
---
They want to think it is hurting you because that is the only weapon they have left. 
---
As we said in the Army: ‚Äúdrive on with a hard on.‚Äù

Xbox?

**Bug**: Somebody nuked Watoga just touching my base. Soon after the server went to maintenance and I was prompted to join another world. When I did, the nuke zone audiovisual effects came with me to the new server, but not the rads. [Video](https://youtu.be/jRnj4hJgc6Y)

Fantastic post!

You must be fun at parties
---
You must become Batman of appalachia... with a 50cal
---
I know a guy who might buy it if you want to sell.
---
I have 3?
---
How much do you want for them
---
Yup. Nothing changed.
---
How much will you sell the outfit for
---
It's a bug, if it's in your inventory it seems to spawn on the ground and follow you. It can't be picked up because it's already in your inventory. Don't know why it does it.
---
Better than my other luck cards like
---
Depends, I like to name my silenced snipers "wind" or "nothing" or "rats" or "not us". It seems to work well at boosting it's reputation since the enemies seem to always know it's distinct sound and effects.
---
People actually click on a disclaimer that warns them of the possibility of PvP. You did nothing wrong regardes of what he or anyone else here says. Haters gonna hate and ain'ters gonna ain't.
---
What does "the back of my knees are moist" mean? I really want to add that to my vocabulary.
---
Been experiencing this myself.  Incredibly annoying.
---
I don't know if this is a workaround, but the reason the pets die for no reason is because the world you load into cannot place your camp.
---
I don't know if you then just turned off the power or crash the game it will 'save' the pet, but just FYI :)
---
Also, what spawn point was this? Im still looking for a pet too. Although that's a good help to tame right next to them. I usually try to stay at a distance too
---
I usually sell them in my machine for 150 caps each my box is full at the moment tho
---
I feel ya. The grind sadly isn't worth the reward. Always counting the minutes before he disappears...
---
How many level ups do u have available right now?
---
Each?!? You get 9 per daily mission
---
 I'm ps4. Currently have 3,949 on sale for 1 cap each. I'll give you the redditt deal of all for 3k caps. WhatTheHeck1978
---
Just gonna tag u/Ladydevann so the devs see this.
---
How did you get that faction tag next to your name?
---
I never need to ask, I just found a player on the map under lvl 10, fast travelled to them, followed them stealthily, and when they picked a fight that was too much and died, I ran in to revive them, challenge done!
---
This is part of the game and well within the rules, yet highly unpopular when done against you.   Yes, it sucks and possibly a dick move.  But I will never let it happen to me. 
---
I like a game that has consequences for my actions.  
---
I have no right to a workshop.  I take it knowing its ramifications.  I never take a workshop and then return to my camp.  The workshop is my priority and  the focus of my actions.  
---
I enter into what I call my ‚Äúhard routine‚Äù in which the workshop is my mission, and that mission has priority. Maybe I hunker down in an overwatch position keeping eyes on the shop.  I Embrace the Suck because I want the shop and nothing else at that moment.
---
I will add one more big reason for me is ammo. 
---
I have a Quad Ammo + Explosive + 50 DMG res while aiming  railway rifle  as my primary  that I got from the legendary scrips vendor. I love it because I don't have to worry about ammo. Just need steel for crafting, and you can usually recover the ammo. The ammo is a little heavy but you don't need to carry as much since I recover about 75% of it. 
---
The train whistle while reloading is fun as well.
---
If you save levels it stilling unlock perk cards until you're actually allocating the point from that level
---
I have the same one. A bit useless after the nerf. if I don't use vats I don't do much damage to enemies.
---
Had this happen in beta and forever more called it the Wile E. Coyote spawn.
---
You can't use a level 19 level up to unlock a level 20 perk card.
---
He will dive, from that dizzying height, NOT into a tub or water! Not into a pail of water! Not into a glass of water! But into an ordinary damp sponge!

---
Bolstering is the better choice imo
---
This'd be wonderful. The BEST way to do it would be to use the personal terminals to have a buy/sell section. Pick what you want there, how many, and at what price, it pulls that many caps into storage, and if anyone checks and sees the wnt ad in THEIR system, they can pop over and sell 'em to your machine.   
---
Don't even need new gear, just use what's already there.   
---
Everybody wins!

---
Huh. Well I think it‚Äôs always good to personalise your character‚Äôs weapon, adds some immersion.
---
I left you a message
---
Ok so once you use all of those but the last one. U will be able to see expert rifleman. The game is registering that u are still lvl 17 until u use the lvl ups.
---
I had that bug once when I was too close to an unbuildable area. I was just outside of the contest circle at monangah. maybe try moving it around a bit is all I can advise. I was able to keep the camp by miving it maybe ten or twenty feet further away. good luck with keeping your sanity and all that.
---
I've got a +50% limb damage pump action that I've called *"Stumper"*.  
---
And my auto grenade launcher is obviously called *"Thump Thump"*.

PvP isn't always to prove which players are better  ,you can get rewards from it or do it just for kicks.

Even then. It takes a group of them a good few minutes to kill her. I'm sure she'd crush them if she fought back.

This is below Garrahan headquarters

Yeah it‚Äôs been posted but I bet there‚Äôs always someone out there with a level 20 that doesn‚Äôt know.
---
I found this out by accident too. :(
---
What level is he out of interest? Just wondering if I need to take some Grape Menats for Charisma
---
hmm when i had that all of my built things were in the stored tab in blueprint form. you can delete the blueprint and get all the individual items you made back. just to make sure were on the same page you arent getting a message asking you if you want to stay on the server or move your camp for free are you? if so it means someone is built on your spot. you have to server hop till its open or find a less popular area. living near whitespring for example means having someone in your spot a lot.
---
I know and ppl buy them like i said my machines are full so I have to wait to sell
---
Yeah, No.8 doesn‚Äôt quite work for me, but each to their own.
---
Make it. Nothing drops a significant amount but you can get it from Scorched and Mutants. The ammo depot is nerfville.
---
Run melee for a while and pick up all the guns and toys you can - that's lead and steel. Run WestTek with melee for gunpowder, steel, and plastic. Get to crafting with Ammosmith + SuperDuper.

Yeh it's there don't forget to use green thumb perk.
---
It does indeed drop in order of rank, Elder is the highest.
---
you can build a new one with the better levels, and then just scrap your old one
---
This is WRONG. Those gear sets are for your typical turd yes however if you think outside the box there are many, many more options. 
---
Weightless sentinel (for standing chameleon)
---
Unyielding harder to detect (virtually unvatsable while crouching so long as the user uses a suppressor)
---
Auto stim sentinel/cavalier (probably one  of the best combinations with lots of stims)
---
Assassin harder to detect armor (for full health monster builds that crouch to avoid vats while being tanky as hell even against bloodied if the build is done right)
---
Honestly people need to realize Assass Sent/Cav are for mouth breathers
---
If you‚Äôre on pc I can give u some ammo.
---
No I‚Äôm not. I got the ‚Äúyour camp couldn‚Äôt be found want to join another world‚Äù when I did it was just the same message. I used some of the blueprint but it wasn‚Äôt all there. My spot occasionally had low level scorched and super mutants by, maybe that‚Äôs it.
---
Westek(sp?) Server farm it. Pretty much end up with more ammo than I spend using it with my instigating handmade and grenade spam. Can get around 100-200 but honestly it's so much easier to craft it with ammo/super duper perks on.
---
Contains some power armor and a synth component.
---
Did you consider the super mutant skin for it?
---
I would love this too, because I‚Äôm the guy selling the lab coats and Halloween witch costumes. I‚Äôd prefer not to get peoples hopes up with armour and only advertise clothing to people who want it.

Thanks for sharing man there's always to sides to the story.

Player vendors are the only way I can keep my LMG fed.

I had a legendary goul near watoga farm blow up after I killed it but what normally spawns there is a sentry bot .

Here's my advice grab the perk that let's you hear when magazines are near most of the pipboy games are actually inside the magazines.

Is the unarmed challenge to kill robots for atoms broke as I can't work out what I should use to do it I've try ed boxing glove,knuckles,power fist and lead pipe.
---
Players already spawn exactly where you first set down camp, so the "death trap" argument is baseless. There is no reason for us not to have the mats.
---
Yeah Bethesda put a cooldown timer of 20hrs on a world item to prevent server hopping and grabbing the same item in static spawn locations
---
You sir, are a gentlewastelander!!!
---
Select from terminal maybe?
---
'die-ving'...love it
---
If you really want some plastics, try Watoga highschool if you're high enough level,
---
I haven't farmed this spot for 3 days though. Same with other spots as well.
---
Unfortunately i am having the same issue there as well.
---
I would've assumed that was a fo4 screenshot! :-)
---
I had one of those but it was low level :(
---
I  haven't played in 3 days and I'm having the issue
---
I recently got a mutant killers submachine gun with weigh reduction and explosive bullets. Couldn't care less if my Xbox blew up and I could never play again, all I wanted was explosive bullets and this was my first after 112 levels...a good day.
---
Unfortunately I am experiencing this issue there as well
---
Damn, i think you may have outdone my power fist named "Assume The Position"
---
If you're geared for it, I say go from location to location killing mobs, especially super mutants.  Whitespring ghouls are a good farm source too but can sometimes be overwhelming if they have all spawned in at twice your level.  I'd also say to do events.  Fast travel to them no matter the cost since you'll make back what you spent to fast travel by doing the event anyway.
---
Lvl 21 and i have a charisma of 3
---
I dont think this works anymore. Ive tried with every horde boss ive seen since hearing about the trick.
---
The enemies may not always be too high in those areas though, so check back from time to time to see if maybe some lower level ones have spawned in instead.  Sometimes the high ones are there simply because a high level players had recently left the area.
---
Platform?
---
PC, sry
---
I put things unreasonably high if im not sure i want it down the road. Put it up for 5k. Then only someone who really wants it will buy. If not you can always play with it as a first shot/last shot
---
Black powder are so needed in the mid game. Medic is kinda wank on it but explosive is perfect.
---
To move it fast id 2k or trade... When your ready
---
The brotherhood building has lots of plastic utensils on the dinner tables (if you've unlocked that area yet).
---
Legendary gear too. Everyone's looking for that perfect godroll weapon, not a half-broken syringer.
---
Gratz. Now, have fun to kill same enemies over and over, on same maps, over and over :autism:
---
Too bad you can't upgrade the one with the Pioneer Scouts sticker on it. I really like the look of it better than just the plain leather one you craft.
---
Im actually the opposite of this! I took the sticker off mine upon the recraft
---
Its surprising what you miss :/ I haven't seen a post about this unless I've glazed over it, which it is possible
---
if you get bloodied explosive you are in the money. i got a bloodied explosive pipe pistol, forget the 3rd effect, sold for 16k caps.  for a pipe pistol! lol
---
I got a Nocturnal Explosive Gatling gun as my best 3\* roll so far. I don't mind the nocturnal negatives as it's basically negated by the explosive. Just at night, things go boom!
---
What platform are you on? Seems like your damage is more than adequate, but you don't have access to some important perks yet, and like others have said, you may be in higher level areas. If you're on PC, I could mod out your rifle or build you a handmade. The handmade is generally lower damage per shot, but you get two shots off faster than a hunting rifle. It was about level 20 when I switched to them.
---
Explosive perks don't affect explosive legendary effects anymore.
---
I can do it, but only at around 9pm GMT (UK time). PM me then if nobody's done it yet
---
Well, you didn't take it off so much as it just never gave you the option to put it on in the first place.  The first backpack is unique.  But I get what you mean.
---
While we're at it, the option to move the build area WITHOUT removing your structures. As soon as the ring hits your stuff it turns red, but enough to move it that SLIGHT inch so I can put my last floor piece in.
---
We need answers.
---
Well I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm the annoying guy
---
P.S if they brought it in they‚Äôd have to put in another thing so it‚Äôs even
---
thats exactly what garlandtd  just asked you,   you're supposed to join another world if you want your spot and to stop spending mats
---
I have not on this character. My issue isn't so much where to find the items but rather that the places I am checking the items keep disappearing after about 30 seconds
---
Well sure. Everyone has their own form of enjoyment. If you enjoy ruining peoples day for shits and giggles, by all means. To each their own, I'm just saying me personally.... i don't get the appeal. 
---
For me it's all about the competitive nature. I want to be the best. I want to win. I want to be the first to get that shiny new weapon reward, etc...
---
Yes please. My Camp is next to a lake, so the only logical place to spawn in IN THE GOD DAMN LAKE.
---
I‚Äôm fairly certain when you make the new backpack the tadpole backpack becomes a skin
---
Actually it is exactly equal to the lever action rifle with the .50 Cal receiver.
---
I‚Äôd take a particular ammo in lieu of caps.
---
And my reply was I‚Äôd done exactly that and it still didn‚Äôt work. Never mind sounds like you think I‚Äôm some sort of idiot.
---
Top lad!
---
can you sign in to playstation network ?. the problem may be there.
---
if youv'e just bought it. (disk ??), has it downloaded the updates ?
---
if not, problem is still most likely ps4 network. need ps4 net to get to bethesda net.
---
hope you can resolve    cheers.
---
My reply was that I‚Äôd done exactly that. Never mind you obviously think I‚Äôm some sort of idiot.
---
How much should I sell the beserkers one for
---
What random location did you use? Been trying to figure out why deathclaws I found I couldn‚Äôt tame while aiming, found many sloths but they appear to be removed from taming?
---
\#1 doesnt work with gat laser. I do use one gun army but I am usually dead before the barrel can spin up if I do manage to get shots on target I am usually dead before the stagger procs. 
---
\#2 yes please keep it going in survival mode I don't understand why peeps still gank me in adventure mode. the max payout is 50 caps - they always attack when the defend event comes up which tells me they fast travelled there. so lets say thats 20 caps. the camp is already built up by the time I am at defend event which means 30 plus caps to contest. literally a player can lose caps killing me the first time in adventure mode. they only get any caps ahead if I am dumb enough to come back. which well I know I suck at pvp and its faster to server hop and rebuild on a fresh server. so I never go back. if they're farming for salt I actually get a twinge of satisfaction knowing I just denied them profit by server hopping. I am rich so I am not worried about the 50 cap loss, and I enjoy building and defending the workshops so they're not getting any salt. they make think so because I just server hop away without taking the time to talk to them usually but yeah. I don't really get salty about it. 
---
\#3 TSE works well against loot pinatas like myself cant speak on the rest. 
---
\#4 the problem with beating pvp people is you have to dedicate specifically for pvp. I dont wanna play a sucky version of fortnite I want to play fallout. you literally have to give up all the neat and fun perks to minmax your pvp effectiveness. no treasure finder no bobblehead or magazine finder  none of the neat fun things on the side. a pvp character has to be all business or he will be facing a severe disadvantage. 
---
\#5 lol i complain about stealthboys all the time. mainly the guys that use them they don't work in power armor. 
---
\# 6 is why I dont pvp. to me power armor IS fallout. that and I dont like stealth. without stealth you can be vatsed if you can be vatsed you're dead. so all of pvp is a pointless exercise in dying for me. therefore I build the workshops under budget. I don't get attached and if a player comes along and gankes me I just server hop and rebuild. (the only reason I take workshops is because I use vamp gat laser and like 100% fusion cores from the power plants.) 
---
\#7 lol yeah. Ill add into this by saying that the stealthboy power armor mod drains your ap while you're stealthed. which means unless you're built totally around it its not worth it. and the trade off isn't worth it to me jumpjets are far better for overall mobility and even with the stealthboy mod you will still get wtf pwned in pvp in power armor. 
---
\#8 ?? why?? and no I wouldnt. theres no gain in it?? theres no caps? nothing?? you're literally burning your time to burn his time for potential salt? that makes about as much sense as topless feminist protesters. I mean I like topless feminist protesters but they are not making a dent in my pig brain politically. 
---
\#9 #10 agreed. 
---
I want to add
---
\#11 the clown suit is not creepy and its not fallout.  its just stupid, same for the mascot heads and silly outfits. you're not cool, intimidating, or being "different" you're just another cookie cutter wannabe weirdo taking advantage of broken pvp mechanics against targets unequipped for pvp. please take that crap to survival mode and try to compete against people like this poster. OR take those stupid mascot heads and clown outfits to fortnite and stay there. "oooh look at me in my creepy clown suit!!!  ooooooooh I'm so creeepy......ooooooooh creepy creeeepy clown muhahaha I am sooooooo creeepy whhhhhhhoooooo"....sigh  friggin morons.
---
Well, they‚Äôre free to price things however they‚Äôd like, don‚Äôt have to buy it, some people also aren‚Äôt aware of pricing for a lot of things.
---
oh and good read overall.
---
Haha, I've had mine since the Beta. üòÜ I know one other on the same platform as well! There's mine. 
---
https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw04JObDjBs/?igshid=avpfs4wbcywz
---
What are your addictions ? How do you get the -2 Int, from the Wiki I can only see Daddy-O for -1 Int.
---
True, but it only costs 776 caps from the Charleston vendor and at that price is too much
---
I 100% suck at pricing. No one is ever happy. Stimpaks for a cap? I get told to give them away. Stimpak for 20 caps? That's too much - they're free in-game.
---
350 caps for any serum? Too expensive, but I can sell them to a vendor for 400+..... 300? Players come to my camp to tell me they're duped.
---
RIP me. I can't anymore. :P
---
The xp and loot is really to low and bad to care about at level 100+.
---
Well I will be online i 5 or 6 hour and we can trade lives if you want. I need the water revival though.
---
However if the Encryptid event procs, go there regardless of your level. Multiple peiple get knocked down and you can help with pylons and adds.
---
The disarm option should be removed on camp items or they need to reset.
---
i dont,  but ive had a loop of it asking me to swap and i kept doing it till it stopped asking
---
So don‚Äôt buy it, they‚Äôre probably hoping to get lucky by having someone come through that doesn‚Äôt know about the vendor and to them the price is worth it because they would really like to have it or something
---
Okay
---
It's like using a better exploding shotgun
---
You can add the scouts skin to the one that you craft
---
It's also a pain to get, so if you have the caps and cant be bothered with the server hops then it's an option.
---
Yeah I think with some things people forget the value of the component pieces. Anything with flux, for me, should command a higher price because it's a lot of time to obtain the flux, especially the less common types. So my lined suits that use it will be more expensive but not excessively. I don't use ultracite ammo but I made some because I think it's something some players wouldn't mind buying to save them the hassle of crafting it themselves. However I know some will expect that to go for the same price as regular ammo. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I don't mind paying for stimpaks. They are findable for free, sure but they are an essential commodity. If I am low in those, I would rather buy them for a cheaper price than the robot vendors but certainly not for free from players.
---
I'm not going to explain why because this question gets asked around 50 times per day.
---
What is the profit at stake of the first positions?
---
And I see it logical to attack the house at the top of the list as a "trap", it may be easier to ambush, put mines, use grenades, hide with friends ... and possibly wait for the person to be distracted repairing or even killing you while loading elements of the stage.
---
The truth is that I have not played yet in that mode.
---
I have the perk that medicines do not weigh me and therefore I have literally, hundreds and hundreds over.
---
Better idea. Make lots of shotgun shells with that plastic instead and sell that in vending machines.
---
My pet peeve are the clown outfits and mascot heads. that shit belongs in fortnite. same for the colored crayon power armor. immersion gets shot to hell when I see that dumb crap.
---
Lol I'd buy stims for a cap and I'd pay 350 for a serum, good prices
---
*"Raider? RAIDER?! - you ain't no Raider - you are Steve, my neighbour from next door in vault 76, remember when we sitting next each other in the cafeteria and you complained about the cold coffee? ...Raider... lol"*
---
There are not many who don't know about the vendor
---
Yeh sure I trade my life with u :)
---
If i tame a pet and it is at my base, do i have to keep the animal friend perk equipped or can you swap it out without losing your pet?
---
yeah those are good prices just keep doing you let the complainers complain.
---
you serum vendors have been a godsend to me on multiple occasions. adjusting or tweaking my build having to lose some mutations and regain mutations bless you sir and may your loins be ever fertile.
---
Then I‚Äôd say let them leave it in there and look dumb and they‚Äôll soon realize it‚Äôs not working, I don‚Äôt see this as that big of a deal
---
I sell all junk for 1 per, legendarie weapons and armor for whatever the game auto prices them at, all meds are 5 per. and food and purified water is 1 per. anyone who doesnt like those prices can piss off .
---
I got this bro.
---
It's compatible with a backpack. I'm wearing it with the Nuka-Cola cooler backpack and a lifted hunting cap.
---

---
I got an explosive lever-action from the Purveyor and it's pretty shit if i'm honest.
---
I wear the pink asylum outfit and hat - and have a very androdygonus character. (Am female - and not at all androdygonus IRL) 
---
And I have a GT that makes everyone assume I'm male. The only thing that gives it away is that the outfit will glitch every so often, making it look as if I have no pants on - so the underwear gives it away. 
---
It's a hilarious glitch though.
---
Animal friend is only required for taming the animal, after that you don't need it
---
I was able to rank Expert Rifleman up all the way at once! Thank you!
---
Have you considered a... workaround? Say placing said mat in a workshop then storing/blueprinting it to try and force a placement in a camp? Just you know... theorycrafting.
---
Sloths can also be tamed but like dewclaws you have to literally go next to them, then the tame option appears even when you are not aiming at the creature.
---
I used the random spawn a bit below garrahan headquarters
---
I suck too with priceing...
---
Most junk for 1. Harder or wanted junks for 2-4.
---
Every single ammo for 1 (even missles and mini nukes).
---
Chems for 5.
---
Bobbleheads for 25.
---
Stimpaks for 5.
---
Super stimpaks for 15.
---
Stimpak diffuser for 10.
---
Magazines for 5.
---
Hardly anything is sold. :)
---
I have a 1 star medics and personally I like it, not viable to heal with but I usually whip out my black powder rifle for crits but when I whip that one out I get a pretty nice health boost so it's better than one without the medics bonus. Medic has no market value however on that gun
---
love it looks awesome, makes me want to repspec a tad and get some T60 myself.
---
Would not start. I went to that fair grounds a few
---
times too. 
---
But I did finally find a pack of wolves and got the badge on the edge of the mire where a pack was attacking a persons camp.
---
To do some events like Grafton Day (don't worry about getting killed; just keep spawning back and get that monster), explore all of the Ash heap, and take on Super Mutants at the lodge at the Top of the World and the train depot near Whitespring. You can snipe a lot of those duties from high ground if you're a rifle enthusiast.
---
Much worse. Get all the insect parts for the scout daily. Oh look a SBQ event. Scrap stuff and the quest updates to let me know I have to start from scratch.
---
oof, big mood
---
I have yet to finish any of those Tadpole Challenge quests for the three badges. Lemme know if you're down for more people.
---
At least they don't drop drills anymore. You used to always get _something_ and that something was a drill.
---
I've noticed recently that sometimes I have to give it a second or 15 and some legendary will be in the corpses. Like there's a big delay now while it decides if I need a drill or not.
---
PS...
---
But that‚Äôs nice of you tho. Thanks
---
Yeah I found a sloth by itself at a random spawn level 20 used both cards at once, then just animal friend tried going up to it but nothing, not sure if it‚Äôs bugged with sloths since last patch, but if someone can confirm successfully taming one in the last week then I‚Äôll keep trying
---
Thanks for commenting! 
---
This little bastard is mine today I tell you XD
---
"yo....yo would you die for me"
---
.
---
"yeah"
---
"What took you so long to answer this mf"
---
I see a lot of people selling at crazy prices, things like used fusion cores with 25% energy for the full 162 caps or more or regular clothes for 100's of caps.
---
At the moment I have recipes for 10 caps
---
Building plans around 20 to 40 caps, purified water for 4 caps and fully repaired hazmat suits for 35.
---
Then anything else I don't want for a cap.
---
Yeah explosive weapons are way overrated, I happily swap them for better weapons like firerate and 10% aim damage. (I use automatic weapons so firerate is king) And despite what Temias below says, firerate is AMAZING on the minigun, especially when you have anti-armor as the first trait, combined with stabilized you ignore almost all armor, while instantly annihilating anything in your path.
---
Thanks deata üëç
---
Thanks.
---
Lol, I bought it in December at first price drop (~30$) , been playing ever since and now bought the most expensive atom pack (~40$?) because I see now that life is about looking dope in your power armour while carrying your chrome minigun.
---
2 stars is not god tier nor is it worth it from purveyor. I suggest saving till you have 100 next time. Nice you got an explosive but those were so nerfed eh
---
All in all - fair point but debateable.
---
I think no prices are wrong and if it's your/my feeling that something is to expensive - don't buy it and roam along to others vendors.
---
As far as i see there is a desperate demand for the hunters longcoat  - i'm sure some would even pay the double to finally get it without endless server hopping and hoping for the right spawn - and thats ok. I mean if you have 25.000 caps to spend because of the Limit it's a way to get cap sink.
---
I see it from a diffrent point bout my shop prices. I only sell rare outfits for 5 to max 50 caps. Why? Because i loot a lot, explore a lot and it's not that effort if you know the right places.
---
Also plans and ammo - a few weeks ago i threw it away mainly, and i would feel kind of greedy to sell it for more than 1cps/ammo or max 5/plan.
---
But i get if some see it as a chance to get caps for high demand stuff and thats ok for me.
---
**retail gonna retail**
---
Thank you! I didn't know this. Have only dabbled in the tadpole stuff as it doesn't feel like much fun to me, but I guess I should commit to just getting it done.
---
I dont see a feature like that being Atom shop exclusive... maybe diffrent sized planters will but all of them... I dont think soo.
---
Nice! I only did one run with the RR, but the name stuck with me.
---
Stims for 20 is fair imo. Buy them from a bot vendor and you pay ~80.
---
I would sell em for way less than 20 but as long it's cheaper than ingame vendors it's not a rip off.
---
if your still farming, I forgot the best one of all for mole miners.
---
same place as the quest- miner miracles. Check the car park. If mole miners spawn, go thru the building again. you can get 20/30 mole miners, also check the tunnels,but there mostly gouls.
---
if robots spawn in the car park, run away (probably an assaultron in there), so come back another time.
---
your going to need a shit ton of springs as well.
---
cheers
---
Anyone smart don't listen to his post. He has left out some of the best legendary rolls and doesn't know what he's talking about.
---
Exactly this.
---
Not what he has
---
I stopped selling them. 5? 10? They weigh too much against my stash so I skip them now. :\ I usually just use any overflow buying junk from vendors and using the Stimpaks to get the 25% back. Not very efficient but better than dropping them...
---
It's not subjective. Yes people may "prefer" a weapon type over another but, the numbers are not subjective in any game. There is always a "god tier" weapon and a lot of times they get nerfed.
---
I'm not sure the inventory and stash weights are calculating correctly. Example - I put  3 ballistic fibre and 2 Black Titanium into my stash from my inventory. Inventory weight hardly changes (OK) but stash weight goes up about 40.  Move same items back into inventory - stash weight goes down a pound or two, inventory up a pound or two.
---
https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/warspite-1996/video/75341560 here's me just a few days ago receiving my mighty drill from a Ghoul.
---
Yes agreed!
---
At least he's honest
---
.... well, !@#$.
---
I really thought that was fixed.
---
No it isn't stick with melee till they Nerf that lol
---
That's the other side, the weight/worth - good point.
---
okey if you ask on here somebody will probably offer to help you
---
When will Todd ever get twitterüòÇ
---
I'm going down a rifle/shotgunner path so sounds perfect, thanks for the tip.
---
Me too, particularly with the handmade (with drum) as well as the gatling plasma.....
---
That river trick you pulled is exactly why I have aquaboy.  üòâ
---
Oh, care to correct him then?
---
I have gotten 4 drill drops in the past week.
---
So yeah they drop drills.
---
And for the bodies, i waited +5 minutes on some and nothing
---
Yep aquaboy saved me
---
What's the prefix effect? Explosive doesn't mean shit on it's own
---
Got you mate. It's in the guide on page 117 about CAMP attack/repair
---
"...Stealing crops, mined resources, or items any protectrons have collected. Of course, acts of vandalism instantly make you wanted;..."
---
Define old. Specs
---
A deathclaw that has definitely found the milk of human kindness
---
for what its worth - both line in the sand, and, heart of the enemy, both completed last night, with no issues.
---
whether they fixed it, or just dumb luck....................
---
Yeah, computer graphics just keep getting better and better but if you got the cash to keep updating then nbd. PS4 is sufficient in graphics and performance.
---
Just read other posts, you want things like bloodied, explosive and two shot were very nerfed to the point it's not noticable unfortunate yes because they are fun to play with but that's just the fact. I prefer melee with bloodied, swing speed, strength is god tier for me. Certainly not an explosive two star pump lol
---
You never can tell what is good or bad pricing - people buy many strange things and sell items they have no idea about value. I've sold yesterday toxic goo that you collecting during possum repeatable quest - somehow it stayed in my inventory, weights 0, so I put it on 299 caps, for giggles. And someone bought it ;)
---
Some things won't sell no matter the price - popular CAMP plans aren't selling even if you value them for 1 cap, while alcohol recipes (499 caps) or mounted bugs plans (599 caps) sold so fast, I barely keep up with delivering new ones to the machine. Same with magazines - I'm selling them for 50 caps and they barely stay in the machine longer than hour...
---
I usually sell things closely to the listed in game price, but sometimes less
---
At those prices if you don‚Äôt sell it might be a location factor. If you‚Äôre next to a fissure site for example it might drive costumers away
---
Yeah I do. I can't be on for most of today but my psn is SprocketChips
---
How do you know the 3* enemy was 3* if it didn't have any stars?
---
You don't know what YOU are talking about.
---
The above post is talking about modifier, and barely even references major prefixes. Hello?? 
---
Anti-Armor is extremely meta in PVP right now. Explosive has literally 0 to do with it besides adding extra damage.
---
Don't even try searching. its best just to server hop until you find it.
---
I just picked the water park and server hopped till he spawned. Took about 20 ish tries, but I got him at least
---
My sniper/sneak toons gun is named Zoomy Scope Snipey Gun
---
Here‚Äôs what I do. Assuming you already have the necessary gunpowder, you‚Äôll need steel and lead. Before I hope into this, you‚Äôll need 3 perk cards. Scrapped, Ammo, and Super Duper. You‚Äôll also need excavator armor. First thing to do is get your steel. You can get a ton by going to West Tek or somewhere else where you‚Äôll be able to get weapons to scrap like assault rifles which give about 20 steel per with scrapper. Once you do that you have to go to Lucky Hole Mine. Using Excavator armor start collecting the various lead ores in the mine. After clearing most of it out you should have over 200 ores. From there go to a chemistry workbench and smelt the ores into lead; make sure to use Super Duper while doing this for a 30% chance to double the 5 lead you‚Äôll be getting. Lastly, once you have the lead, steel, and gunpowder, you can start crafting the ammo. Before you do, you‚Äôll need the ammo perk card and super duper equipped to make sure you maximize the amount you‚Äôll be crafting.
---
He is talking about major effects. Bloodied and and Two-shot are Primary effects. Obviously you don't know how legendary weapons work.
---
I am in the Forest, just under the Junkyard, near the river.
---
You probably have cards that lower scrap or item weight in your inventory, they dont apply to your stash though
---
All the endings All the variations probably 4k hours. dunno the actual number of hours because I lost accounts from being deployed etc. minutemen ending is probably the best long term ending for me. 
---
I don't like the railroads ideology, brotherhood of steel end up glitching and attacking the settlements. and the institute always infiltrated my settlements afterwards. minute men were kind of "meh" but at least things ran smoothly afterwards.
---
I've got the Deathclaw gauntlet extra claw mod in my Inventory
---
If you don't mind spending the caps, find a list of all spawn locations and just fast travel to each one. Found the tourest in under 10 minutes doing this, but then again, you'll have to spend caps for fast travel.
---
I don't agree with you, that if you got something maxed, you won't need lower levels cards. Sometimes I need all three levels to swap, since I utilize different builds. And here is the problem - I'm wasting so much time changing cards back and forth. It's really help if they allow us to save some preset sets - one for regular fight, one for crafting, one for SBQ, etc. I know, there is a mod for it, but only for PC player and it's not officially legal.
---
Just to clarify, from the Top of the World train station, go up and around the right side of the lodge. You come out on small cliff overlooking the lodge. Some of the mutants will make their way up there if attacked, but a lot of them don't. There's also a cliff overlooking the tracks leading to the train depot. There are a bunch of mutants down there (sometimes one legenday) that never find a path up there. It's like fish in a barrel.
---
90% reduced weight IIRC.
---
it does
---
Lol I so do. I know enough to not call explosive or two star god tier and where was he talking about bloodied? Melee or gun it's better damage period more reliable than junkies and not shit like nocturnal or explosive or two shot now. So keep listening to bad advice. I'm one of the players who laughed at all of you for crying cause project Paradise was too hard and I completed it on my first run through with only three people. I also wouldn't waste my time on a two star from the purveyor
---
That would be nice the whole preset thing but yeah I feel we should be able to discard the ones you don't need. I don't think you need 5 different cards for say ammosmith.
---
According to "CanYouRunIt" my CPU wouldnt even suffice, suggested for minimum is a I5-6600K, and im running a I5-6400. Everything else suffices to run the minimum.
---
Useful if you're running the marsupial mutation which reduces int. By 4
---
You definitely not suck on prices good sir.
---
Would buy 11/10
---
I may be wrong, but they've already done something similar to auto-discarding. If the card has two levels and you have it maxed, when you receive that card again (by cards set every 5 levels or by manually choosing it) it will only shows once as 1* and you can't rank it up to 2*, since you've already have 2*. Same with 1* cards - you can only have one that card, no multiple copies.
---
I was also speaking of all effects not just primary but hey keep using shit weapons if this dude's was god tier by all means I love meeting players like you in survival I'm like oooh explosive shotgun user I hear???? Free stuff!!!!!!
---
Did not know that. Thanks. üëç
---
What'd we learn?
---
I think you would he fine. I use a laptop with a i7 4710hq, 16gb RAM, and a 970M and the only issue I ever have is screen tearing (48hz screen üôÉ)
---
So did I, so I was pleasantly surprised when that happened.
---
The more purifiers you have, the more storage you get, not production.  You should ditch most of those.
---
Yeah I just don't like having multiple one stars in my inventory with a 2 star and a Max rank and can't rank them up.
---
Thats a minor modifier. The prefix are things like Bloodied, TS, etc.
---
 my naming convention is less creative... 
---
1LAR 
---
1SBQ LAR 
---
2 Exp LAR
---
2 AA 10mm
---
It just orders my stuff in my inventory and I  avoid accidental sales by working from the bottom of my list..  as all good stuff is numbered at the top.
---
If we had camp trophy cabinets I would be more inventive...
---
I think you would be fine. I use a laptop with a i7 4710hq, 16gb RAM, and a 970M and the only issue I ever have is screen tearing (48hz screen üôÉ)
---
What he said.  
---
Not everybody got time to sit around, idling in a mmo game. When I get online, I just want to shoot things, raid some workshops and quickly get on with some events...
---
I believe someone actually proved production is correct, it's just when you have multiple purifiers it doesn't produce 1 every purifier, it produces 1 that's deposited into a random purifier.
---
The industrial is 60/hour so I think if you had 12 of those, after 1 hour they'd all have 5.
---
Whether or not it's counter productive to have more than 12, I don't know.
---
Is this a fanfic üòÇ
---
Oh that's good to know, I usually hoard stuff, going to have to be more selective now! Thank you!!
---
You know what it also great way to farm legendaries? Just playing the game as it was supposed to. So you keep having your fun and I will keep having mine, which involves speeding through events as fast as possible.
---
Lost my Hamlet yesterday, no idea how he died :(
---
I like to think he ran off chasing a beaver. RIP Hamlet.
---
Set your vending machines up, do your events and sell to vendors, and play you will get your caps.
---
Wish we could repair them somehow like the brahmin. I'd pay caps to do it if materials weren't enough.
---
I'm down to ply with you all, GT same as here.
---
It is +60 carry capacity :)
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
Beats my "[dont scrap] auto handmade"
---
Along with the \*farming\* update let us revive our "animal friends"/wasteland whisperer too! Nothing sucks more than grinding for 6 hours to have our pet die to a molerat.
---
The Grafton monster in the arkos event will hit you so hard it will send you flying, lol
---
Thank you :)
---
I wouldn't roll anti armor in pvp. My point was explosive or two shot are shit legendary rolls now period. Anti armor is great but go ahead with your anti armor anything in pvp against me you will not beat bloodied the damage just isn't there. A level 300 character, a level 74 and a level 54 I have 0 issues soloing any content now that I have learned it all and my main has every unlockable recipe in the game except two raider armor mods. Don't know what I'm talking about though. Keep hoping you get anti armor explosive weapons you noobs lol I'll keep waiting for you in survival. I will also keep selling shit 3 star explosive to idiots who pay 8000 caps for them lol have fun sucking at 76 people
---
Wood armor technically can only exist as 1\* armor but there's a glitch in the purveyor rng that assigns it a 3\* rating that disappears on relogging. (This also goes for assaultron heads too.) Best thing you can do is recycle it immediately for 24 scrip before you log out and it's only worth 3.
---
The farmer is.
---
Likely his explosive shot accidently tagged you as hostile so he couldn't revive you. Catches you off guard if done accidently thus causing confusion when he went to do the revive. 
---
He's still an asshole for stealing your stuff though.  Be sure to store that shit next time!
---
I feel like some people charge hundreds of caps for something worth like 30, because they don‚Äôt know that everyone can see it‚Äôs legit value lmao
---
It‚Äôs a well known bug, has been happening since the purveyor arrived.
---
like a king
---
Which is where the perforating mag comes in.
---
In response to #11, I personally love wearing outrageous outfits, it's all the fun of customization. I don't know much about Fortnite, but I love being able to dress my character in whatever I want. If I wanna wear a ritual mask with a clown costume because it's entertaining to me, it shouldn't really bother you. Just continue on your way and enjoy the game.
---
Bulk????
---
I did same, except it only took about 7 hops.  A seal is slumped by a car in the parking lot, and very obvious
---
I have one. Psn is brm138
---
This was an enjoyable read, thank you! Love hearing bout people adventures and first encounter of things
---
I got a really go Tesla 3* when I get home I will let you know what the stats are.
---
Go to trade subReddits.   I have seen prices ranging from 10k to 18k for the Mr Fuzzy costume on PS4.
---
Not sure what hurts more, hoofing it back to my loot or repairing all my armor.
---
It‚Äôs in My Games in your documents folder.
---
I saw him sprawled over a car at the very front of Whitesprings main entrance several hours ago. 
---
I would think those bots that fiercely maintain the formal gardens would have saved him from his untimely demise.
---
Um, yes they do. Where'd you here that?
---
always trust random people on the internet?
---
Harder the enemy works for me but all of the mire quest just do not anymore so please but as to the sooner you can get on this the better off everyone will be. That's a bunch of dailies right there that I haven't been able to get in months and I know I am not the only one.
---
I have Gary the Sloth.
---
Many people have tried killing him at my C.A.M.P when coming to see what I've got for sale and then get confused why he doesn't die!
---
I Already looked there i only see Fallout 4 and fallout NV :(
---
As to 6 and 7 - you can succesfully pvp in PA, you just have to know what you're doing. Stealthboy is a hard counter againts vats build, jetpack againts silly melee kits, berry mentats against stealthed folks and AAE HWs stagger the shit out of jumping sentinels...  
---
Point 8 just tells me you're insecure and douchy. You can keep telling yourself any kind of excuses, it doesn't change an iota of that fact.
---
It pops up real quick in the upper left hand corner when you get it and is gone just as fast. A usually happens when the quest completed comes up so it's understandable if you don't catch it.
---
3-5k is the going market price for selling a hunters long coat on PC. Sure it's cheaper at a vendor but do you want to server hop for 6 hours to save a few caps?
---
My AAE combat shotgun w/VATS is far from overrated.  I‚Äôve got several decent handmade rifle combos, sniper and hunting rifles, and AAE combat rifle.   Some bloodied, some furious, some vampires.  They all serve a purpose. 
---
As for the minigun, I picked up a furious AAE version.  It‚Äôs decent but most of the above mentioned weapons work much better.
---
Stagger.   Especially with automatic piston.
---
All the more reason to stick by the ones you CAN trust. I'm a high level and playing to help others is just fun in my opinion. If you are on xbox my gt: Tops Bloobie. If you know his gt we can find him and give some well deserved revenge. Revenge can be fun too.
---
I can do it
---
I named my Super Sledge "Down + B"
---
I always see more complaints by PC players than console players on system issues after patches.
---
Think this may still be a problem when attempting to place the mat on anything player-built.
---
What they need to address first is the bases loading in too late, which would mean lengthening the load screens whenever outside 
---
Maybe only having lengthened load screens when traveling to a player camp would work? But I'm no Bethesda employee so god knows what other kinks may lie deeper in the crevices
---
Now this is what I call a great job, thanks!
---
Don't be a dipshit and stadh your shit
---
He wasn‚Äôt at the workshop. Wasn‚Äôt defending and wasn‚Äôt involved. This is an oversight end of story.
---
I have 4 cameras got one from Ansel and the rest I found in various containers. Waste of time having more than one though as I thought i could repair and sell them to save people server hopping but it does not let you sell.
---
It‚Äôs a free market. Personally I feel that this is the best type of market you could ask for. 
---
No price setting. No requirements. Sellers are at will able to list something like canned dog food for 10k caps. Or the Asylum Forrest Dress for 5 caps. 
---
Those that approach it with what they feel is an ‚Äúeducated‚Äù approximation is what things are ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to cost are simply fooling themselves. 
---
Everything in this game with regards to monetary transactions or Trades is all based on perceived value. Some think that a TSE Lever Action with Reduced Weight is a god tier weapon and thus is worth 5 figures. Or that the Forrest Asylum dress is one of a kind and worth 8k. One spacebar hit in a Bethesda cubicle and Forrest Asylum is as common as Wood Armor. 
---
I sell all my serums for 367 caps. I see sellers selling them for up to 1500c and as low as 150c. 
---
I see Stimpacks listed for anything from 5 caps to 100 caps. 
---
Sure, we can mock and belittle those that list items for what we believe is too high or too low, but reality is that said mockery is in vain as it‚Äôs really none of our business whether or not it sells. Maybe it will. Maybe it won‚Äôt. 
---
Either way, it‚Äôs a free market. If you don‚Äôt like the price. Don‚Äôt buy it. 
---
Posting a thread on Reddit to complain about free market prices is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum.*
---
Of course this is just my opinion. And I could be wrong. 
---
*Thanks to Baz Luhrmann and his iconic ‚ÄúWear Sunscreen‚Äù for that line.
---
The beer keg as well. I've heard people say it's a Biv daily but let's be real, if the punch bowl is still deactivated because of dupers they're not going to introduce something that does functionally the same thing with beers.
---
Are they the WS busts? They can be purchased in the shop next to the shop with all the work benches.
---
fallout has always had a dark gritty atmosphere and a similar dark gritty humor. the outfits and crap don't match. its the wrong tone for the fallout universe that smacks of bethesda selling out to appeal to a broader branch of customers. and no they're not outrageous outfits they're just dumb. it bothers me only because its a firm yank out of the immersive landscape and environment and a blunt reminder of commercial realities that game developers face today. short attention spans and kids who have never read a book which means to sell they have to dumb down communications to emojis and appeal to their desire to be special by offering crap that makes no sense lore wise. fortnite is so successfull because it specifically targeted along those parameters. if you haven't played I have a feeling it would probably be a good match for you. I will however take your advice and continue to move on and just enjoy the game as I have been for over 1000 hours so far now. just letting people know they look like morons. consider it a psa
---
Good deathclaw! Now let me see one of those fingers!! Daddy needs an extra claw mod for his gauntlet ü§£
---
Have you taken your ID photo yet?  The standard path is ‚Äú%UserProfile%\documents\My games\Fallout 76‚Äù minus quotes, if you are looking for the ini or picture files.  The game files are in ..\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda.net launcher IIRC.
---
Try people vendors/shop at their own camps! That‚Äôs your best bet
---
It's essential for roleplaying which no one does in this game
---
Wow, had no idea about this, that‚Äôs really poor effort from Bethesda, they ought to be ashamed that so many big issues still remain.
---
Get the dense torso mod
---
They're talking about the mounted heads that we can see in the build menu. All are in the menu to see but only a few are available to unlock via quests and dailies.
---
Really?  Huh...  good thing I only had one level.  Swap time!
---
Input the stats here:
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
Seems pretty reliable thus far.
---
Bulk everything and sell it. Also sell gold, silver and other non-bulkable items.
---
Put water purifiers in your camp and sell Purified water. (note that more purifiers will only increase storage, not production).
---
Before selling to robot vendors, put the Hard Bargain 3\* perk on and eat charisma booster.
---
You can quite easily get 1500 caps per day from the vendors.
---
Sell excess ammo to players for 1 cap each.
---
If that is not enough there are lot's of bottlecap stashes and with the Caps bobblehead you can get ton of caps from them.
---
How, may I ask, do you do this
---
Gotcha I'm going to have to look into this. My end game has been mindlessly collecting every plan.
---
I could add all the other issues that i contacted support for too. But then the list would be endless.
---
For now i just want this annoying bug to be finally fixed. 
---
thanks for your empathy.
---
its my goto frustrated phrase .. although I use it in all sorts of contexts .. or just be used as a conversation starter usually works
---
I assume the camera gets tagged as a quest item and can't be scrapped?
---
Nice, I'll borrow it if you don't mind.
---
Just an example. Note: "Erreiche Aufseherrang 24" means translated "reach overseer rank 24"
---
[https://i.imgur.com/sI4p4SI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/sI4p4SI.jpg)
---
But honestly, it's the possum challenges being messed up and therefor not completable that frustrates me the most.
---
Or scrip junk low level legendaries and but 3* rolls from legendary purveyor.
---
It‚Äôs a skin.
---
Just a skin. Have to unlock the back back through tadpole challenges first. Think of it as an armor paint at an armorers bench
---
Thanks again for your work. 
---
I've been seeing enemies that slide on the ground instead of standing. Mostly ghouls but I've seen other types of enemies as well. At least I haven't seen a stretchy boy after this patch....
---
Bulk. But I also sell the purified water from my water purifiers.
---
That is actually super cheap I would of bought that in a heart beat.  Could have easily flipped it for triple the price.
---
 I found a TSE gatlin gun on somebody's vendor machine for 1500 caps.  I couldn't believe it, I bought it instantly along with a couple other very cheap weapons.
---
 I turned around went to my vendor machine and put it on for 8750 caps.   That is a lot cheaper than they sell on the market places.
---
 There are 2 types of vendors I noticed.
---
 1st type has absolutely no clue the value of what people will pay nn the reddit markets.  This type usually puts the price of an item the same as it's listed on the item itself.  If they raise the price it's not that much at all.
---
2nd type of player knows value of items and sells them accordingly on their vending machines.
---
 Man am I glad the 1st type of player exists!
---
3500 for one of the rarest jackets you can get in the game is an absolute steal. You missed out if you didn't buy it.
---
Not sure exactly how it works, but I transferred tokens from one account to my other, and the machine would not accept them. It seems like each acct has to earn their own tokens. 
---
Anyone else able to transfer them between different accts?
---
Anyone have crops on a campfire that i can blueprint? Im on xbox
---
Wait... could that mean it is a "fresh" server?  Some people argue the server has a loot table that is consumed over time.
---
Is there a way in game to tell if you are in verdant season?  I get the periodic notices, but wasn't sure if there was a way to check without the game announcing it.
---
I really hope they implement exactly this. Sick of looking at groups of pp and going ‚Äúdang, I wanted to do that‚Äù
---
mr handys.........well, their always going to be a little on the tough side.
---
go find as many shotguns as you can get, and scrap them.(along with EVERY other weapon).
---
this will unlock the mods. your looking for hardened recievers,and armour piercing.
---
even lowly pipe weapons can be made to be very effective.
---
you will notice an immediate difference.
---
cant stress this enough....ARMOUR PENETRATION.
---
Terrible idea^
---
The only pvp in adventure is trickery or workshops.
---
On my latest character I'm taking every workshop I pass, no one has RSVP'd or contested yet. Had two separate instances of people trying to rope a dope me when selling or scrapping with their team mate nearby.
---
Also had more frequent pleasant helpful moments so that's nice.
---
It should be there, if not... search for duplicates of the Documents folder in other drives.
---
Interesting. Thanks for the info. Hmmm...protectrons.
---
I'm sure he does, and that it's just a random alias or screen name.
---
How many do you run and what size? I usually only run 2 industrial because more than that for me doesn't meet the per hour count.
---
I love your prices and hope I run into your store one of these days!  You would probably come home to empty vending machines.
---
if you are on ps4 feel free to check out my account or message me im always looking to help out newcomers
---
Good idea I have like 40 legendary Weapons for sale and I never know which ones I sold.
---
I've had a few fun times with workshops and contesting. Even joined a hunt/hunted once and it was a blast to do. This on the other hand is your typical loser "raider" gang of this game. Its the only reason they stay on adventure. To abuse the system.
---
What level are your weapons?
---
At lower levels always upgrade your weapons to the max level you can use and mod them for damage/accuracy.
---
Don't bother with player vendors. 99% of weapons there are max level (meaning 45+).
---
Also don't bother trying to find legendaries, you will out level them soon and be left with something that is not good for you new level.
---
Try asking players if they can make you a weapons to your level. Many high levels have nearly all weapons and mods opened and don't even ask you anything in exchange.
---
If you are in PC I can come and make you any weapon you want.
---
I've started using one too and I've definitely killed myself at least once. Don't want to invest in the fireproof perk, and I doubt I'm going to stumble upon a dense torso mod for my armor any time soon. Going to take a bit to get used to it.
---
Well this is very true the odds of finding the vendor and then having them have that jacket on them is quite rare.
---
You're not paying for the price that the vendor sold it for. Your paying for the pains taking server hopping and trying and trying and trying again to get that stupid jacket.
---
 For some reason you people don't understand the rarity of items and the value they gets put on them. Super rare items fetch super high prices, it's just the way it is.
---
Dense seems very hard to find. Is it just a mod or can it be learned from scrapping armor?
---
6 of the small ones since my CAMP is not close to a water source. I get \~15 x purified water every time I go there... I leave one of the purifiers open for the exhausted travelers.
---
Doesn't seem to work, tried this with a Ghoul horde near the Nuka-Cola plant. Crippled the boss (3*? Idr) only spawned lvl 3 ghouls in waves of 3-5 ghouls, cleared about 10 waves not 1 legendary.
---
I found an easy strategy to find the tourist by fast travelling betweet phillippi cemetary, landview light house, Colonel Kelly Monument and Wavy Williards. 
---
If I didn't find it I server hopped by my 3rd server hop I found a tourist at the Kelly Monument.
---
All of these points are close to each other and the Tourist is close to where you spawn 
---
All of these places generally have low level enemies.
---
Wavy Williards directly ahead of the spawn point leaning on a car
---
Phillppi Cemetary amongst the Grave markers
---
Colonel Kelly Monument top of the stairs on a bench
---
Landview Light House top of light house leaning on railing.
---
As a PC player I have to agree. But also PS4 still has issues that were solved several patches ago.
---
PC also have access to Nexus mods like Perk card packs and better inventory.
---
PC player base also is very friendly and have not seen a griefer yet (400+ hours played). IMO PS4 and XBOX has serious problems in their playerbase (at least according to all the posts here in Reddit).
---
So those toxic goos from that quest that get stuck in your inventory actually count towards the quest.
---
  Somehow I have 3 of them stuck in my inventory and every day I do that quest I only have to collect two goos from the wild as the 3 in my inventory count towards the quest.  Saves a few seconds of running around which is fine by me.
---
i had planters in fo4, hell I could even use my pipboy sitting on my couch in fo4. oh wait the modders made that happen the DEVs at BETH aren't up that level of creativity.
---
Oh, my sweet summer child. The last Hunter coat I saw was going for 15,000. Other similar pricing issues too. I saw a PPP going for 5000 and a Bubblegum Bear for 20,000.
---
Some people are just fucking delusional. 
---
Or, worse, predatory, hoping someone misclicks and ruins the game for themselves.
---
Yeah.... about that Drills are still in the loot table :(
---
Yes, please! I'm one of the people focusing on both collecting and selling outfits and I would love this. People looking for outfits end up in camps with only actual armour and vice versa. It's just annoying for everyone. I also would not mind if this caused the apparel section of the inventory to be divided into armor and cosmetic stuff.
---
Odd. That s were I did my badge part
---
Exactly. Lead from lucky hole with excavator. Gunpowder and steel from west tek. That's the best i came up with in 1000 hours.
---
You mean you aren't scared of those monsters who hover over you waiting to take your junk...
---
They're absolutely terrifying.. All of Appalachia should quake in fear.
---
only thing i disagree with personally is #8, i and a friend made new characters for survival mode, with the purpose of playing more of a raider style life. we frequently are barely carrying anything and focus on sneaking into fights among stronger characters and stealing death bags/taking shots of opportunity from stealth/causing chaos etc. 
---
we don't fuck with peoples camps mostly because it doesn't seem worth the time and potential death. get in, snatch the lootz, get the fuck out. I don't make anything off blowing up someones camp, and i don't need them hunting me down for it when im trying to live that sleeze life. 
---
i get where your coming from, and maybe being a lower level scavenger i don't really have the firepower to destroy a camp like you might, but i can't see the reason why i'd bother.
---
This would be true if the daily challenges make the camera a requirement. Everyone who has seen that screen knows it exists but can't find it. Really frustrating.
---
This happened to me as well. It was surprising and funny. Saved me a few rounds. lol
---
Ah, thank you both. I wasn't aware - I am now üòÅ Next time I shall recycle that badboy pronto üòÖ
---
People claim they have quality of life mods for user-end.  Nothing like fo3, 4, or nv, but still worth checking out.
---
If you could do cross platform play, I'd have both.  Am on xbox, and no complaints.  Like the big screen.
---
Because the stars appeared after 5-10 seconds of the enemy spawning
---
I tried to roleplay as a crazed chef of sorts, and I had a rifle called "Meal Prep" with a Gatling Gun called "The Tenderizer." Probably could've done better but idk
---
So you just need the bucket list?
---
So even after the stars appeared it still dropped no legendary? I think I seent a video on this ü§î
---
Been a while since I've played so I don't have many opinions on your points. 
---
You kind of just come off as an asshole though, and use the "you'd do it too" reasoning to justify being an asshole. As everyone who responded to #8 said: 
---
No, no we wouldn't just destroy someone's base.
---
idk, i had it on xbox and ended up buying it for pc a couple days ago . inventory management seems easier with m/k. they had a sale going on though were i got it for like 30 bucks if its a price thing i dont see that sale anymore but you could probably get it fairly cheap from gamestop pre-owned or something, you can get it really cheap though if you just buy an account someone doesnt want anymore for pc from ebay ymmv but like 5-6 bucks if you just wanna try it
---
generally Ill have stuff for a few days at a time. I will sell out to robot vendor daily and put all extra stuff on the vendor. also I hit the scrip cap and all the extra legendaries start piling up on the vendor. from time to time ill be on and someone will come along and just clean me out lol.
---
It's a plan you can buy. I read you used to be able to buy it off Phoenix in Watoga (for the combat torso), but not sure myself. Maybe the BoS vendor in Whitesprings? I've been busy doing a quest line, so I haven't  had a chance to check yet.
---
I think they need to dump the team pvp thing. If someone on your team engages in pvp, it shouldn't throw you in too. And if you engage a guy in pvp, you shouldn't be surprised to see you actually engaged 4 guys. 
---
And can we just take out camp smashing completely in adventure mode? Like who wants that shit in there at all?
---
I would die 4 U........typically on around 8est. PSN: csmit69
---
can you tell me how to take the id photo ?
---
Thanks for the info I'll be checking vendors
---
Depends entirely on what Almighty Tod wants at the time. I once spent three and a half hours trying to server hop until I found the server I had a workshop on earlier that day. After hundreds of times leaving and joining servers, I only ended up seeing about 30-40 different servers. This may vary by region though, because I was in the middle East at the time, which may only be able to access certain EU and Asian servers.
---
I was able to accurately confirm how many server hops successfully moved me to a different server by dropping bags with junk in them around my spawn location. I can assure you that there was at least once that I left and returned to the same exact server more than ten times in a row.
---
In the end I never found the original server.
---
I'm thinking its the internet, plug into a friends connection and try the game
---
I would upvote this more if it could make Brahmin milking sounds when you hit things with it.
---
Heard it was in the dev room
---
Yep and every time i saw this happen the legendary never dropped anything except the standard non legendary loot
---
If i'm right this is all to do with the next 'DLC', seems to have corrupted/ replaced all the other names of items with senseless rubbish that'll be pieced together for new quests/ objectives.
---
Needs sorting ASAP as its pissing annoying.
---
pve or pvp?
---
It will happen after you create your character.
---
if pvp offense or defending workshops?
---
You're welcome!
---
Tought at first it's about the lumber protectrons but that makes no sense as for bounty reason nor camp attacks imo
---
for any melee build it‚Äôs good to have radicool in endurance, other than that it‚Äôs looking pretty good

Yeah the enemy glitches are rediculous. I hate it when I log in and caught a disease before even seeing the actual enemy. When I finally do see them they indeed often just slide around like a fakir. No clue why this suddenly happens. Could it be because of all the new features a lot of stuff has to be loaded constantly (people's camps, vendors, extra events, extra data/ perks?)

I thought it did as it allows you to aim for body parts it vats.
---
Well guess we should have had robots that collected stuff for us then. Bethesda can't lie on this.
---
Drop a bag of fertilizer on their bed and give them the message about their prices!
---
The fixer (level 50) and sheepsquatch weapons with various mods. Both sell really well and are fairly inexpensive to craft
---
Maybe they are doing the BETA in China because they got sick of the brigading that happened the last time they did a beta...
---
But people are tasty!
---
Bruh, my anti armor plus strength knuckles named "tunnel snakes rule" belongs there too!
---
Yeah wasn't sure. Thought I tried it one time but can't remember. I'd recommend adrenaline, fireproof and bloody mess max ranks.
---
So you are a raider? I'm an Enclave Officer, and I don't treat your kind kindly sir. 
---
My weapons are Northern Star and The Inheritance. Inheritance is Resolute Veteran, just with cooler name. It was left by his great grandfather. Northern Star is a two shot tesla shotgun. It was a tesla rifle in the bunker when Svartkollr found it. He modified it and gave it the name "Northern Star"
---
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS! THAT'S WHY! THE BANDWIDTH YOU NEED IS 3.5!
---
I have my own kind own unarmed build. But I redid your one to my liking without changing your special stats all that much. 
---
If you get a swing speed unarmed weapon you can remove martial artist because you swing fast enough for most stuff. Or even barbarian if you have enough defence on your armor. And swap it for traveling pharmacy so you can hold all the stimpacks and radaway only need radaway during the night if you use Sun Kissed from the endurance tab.

---
Collect weapons of killed enemies, scrap them to learn mods. Mod any weapon found at your level that is not a pipe weapon = profit.
---
Shotguns are also very inefficient unless used at very close range (ie melee range).
---
Go to Wavy Williards there's a quest there that wll get you the Perfect Storm it's a good low level weapon that's easy to get. Though I suggest you wait to do this quest because the gun spawns at your character level. However if you get a level 25 varient it will work well.
---
Also melee while boring is very effective. A machete with a serrated blade does decent damage especially with incisor and Gladiator perks.
---
Ok what would you swap in and out with
---
yeah i could use a break on new and exciting things in exchange for better perfomance for a few patches.
---
I price everything at what i would lile to get but if you ever want anything ouy of one of my machines and price is to high for you message me and im more than willing to make a deal
---
I agree, it‚Äôs as if they‚Äôre sacrificing quality from one aspect for another.. Can only hope for a decent patch fix.
---
Yes, had a friend from USA telling me that it has also something good, as it's a bit like a spoiler of future content. But doesn't help if it makes possum challenges uncompletable due to lack of understanding.
---
Not to mention those, including some of my friends, that don't speak english at all.
---
I just favourite my weapons for quick switching and it helps prevent selling it!
---
I think this was suggested a while back and Bethesda replied and passed the idea along.
---
But I really hope they incorporate this in someway. Maybe have the new computer terminal where you can choose what to show.
---
It does, is just a little different in behaviour compared to the regular ones.
---
After using it you need to crouch and then go around saying things like 'ha, ha, you cannot see me' or 'surprise motherfucker, I bet you didn't see that one coming' in area chat for it to work.
---
Drills are still on the legendary table.
---
And to answer the OP, this is a recurring bug/glitch that happens pretty often due to server latency (The most easiest place to recreate this is at AWOL armaments, for some reason)
---
Basically, the way the starred legendary mobs work is that they:
---
1. spawn
---
2. legendary script is ran 
---
3. Stars + flair appear
---
if you tag a mob during stage 1 or 2, you wont get any legendary drops because the mobs legendary script hasnt finished running, so you tag a regular mob and not a starred legendary one.

---
p.s. and yes, ASAP was what i thought might be and was a bit patient. But it's now the 2nd week already and not even not fixed, but completely ignored. Contacted Beth support and submitted a ticket, but all i got was a generated bot response.
---
Nothing official by Bethesda so far that they aknowledged this issue or that they look on it, even though there were posts by me or others reporting this bug here or on Beths official site over a week ago :/
---
i would dump the shotgun (for now) you gotta get kinda close for them to have any real effect. if you on pc i'll hook you up i'll be on for a bit this morning.
---
With Chemist buying Meds just isn't worth it anymore, unless I see some cheap Bloodbags. (Don't have the med loot perk or I'd never need to buy)
---
Damn you should rename this thing and call it Double Dragon or Billy and Bimmy. I wish I had this gun.
---
Northern Star sounds epic, I really need to invest in more energy weapons on my new character.
---
Oh, and don't worry, me and my raider pals are more interested in hunting mirelurks than causing trouble for the enclave, we'll stay out of your way...
---
I'm a PS4 player it runs well on it. I'm not trying to sway you one way or the other but it does run well on consoles.
---
As far as the PC goes post your system specs let the players who know about what works they well help you out. You don't want to buy it and find out it runs like crap on your PC. Better safe than sorry.
---
General pve.
---
Pve
---
Max out charisma and get the vendor perk card. Run through all the events; especially horde mode ones. Strip the earth of everything that isn't bolted down and sell it (mainly guns, armor, chems). Sell all of it. Sell your own mother. Sell your only child. Sell your limited-edition Power Armor edition canvas backpack.
---
I don't see doofus whiners. I see method actors staying in role. Come in yelling and talking shit, can't hit the broad side of a barn with a shotgun, get their asses handed to them and run away crying. The only thing they missed was an 'I don't wanna die' shoutout to FO3.
---
Bravo, whiny radier role players. I hope they do their performance art near me. I roleplay as a friendly merchant who served in the BOS and still has their armor in a chest in the back. You know the trope. Should be fun.
---
Add dodgy and adrenaline, drop rejuvenated, solar powered and adamantium skeleton. 
---
You want to max your agility to get the most out of the perk that adds DR for agility points, plus dodgy flat out decreases damage taken and adrenaline increases your damage.
---
I don't see this as necessary because whenever you need mats you can server hop and get them from vendors easy, when you play enough and know what it takes to build camp stuff and repair your specific weapon and gear, you're going to pick up way more than enough that you will be selling some junk anyway. I think screws are on the top ten list of items sold already with player vending so again I think this would just add unnecessary clutter to the code and even more bugs in a game that does not need more bugs. Just my opinion thoigh
---
welcome to the cool table
---
Is there a link to this post please?
---
I currently have six at my camp purely thinking that they produce water each and have noticed sometimes its very inconsistent. 
---
So if that is correct I think ill drop it down to three this evening!
---
Yep.  I am a rifle/melee build, so I find the long hallway I can encourage a few to rush down at me so I can mow them down.  
---
The real pain is you get a literal ton of loot, and the nearest vendor is a looooong walk.  I have been known to drop bags and hope to hell I don't get logged out when I fast travel to a vendor, sell stuff, then go back for the rest...
---
I love this idea!! Daily challange kill a Honey Beast while wearing a Bee Keepers uniform.
---
I dont understand why people go for mutations without class freak lvl 3...
---
In my opinion:
---
\-remove 2 points from perception and pick green thumb or whatever, place them in luck.
---
\-remove 2 points from inteligence and place one in Luck and agility.
---
\- pick lvl 3 Class freak for luck as well as lvl 3 Bloodly mess, you dont need Mysterious savior at all.
---
\-Remove Revent and Ghoulish and place Iron Clad lvl 5
---
\-In charisma find a way to place one more point in there to use Tenderizer and Supressor.
---
\-Inteligente use Makeshift warrrior lvl 3, its enough.
---
\-Agility use Adrenaline lvl 5, remove marathoner.
---
Maybe they coming a little later. Also all fasnacht masks are mentioned in the guide and at release there was no fasnacht in sight.
---
The fact that I didn't know about this until now is pretty disgusting.
---
Is that why they deactivated the punchball? I was honestly wondering what it was. How are they doing it? It's amazing to me how quickly some people can find ways to misuse items in game hahaha
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm6ms6/psa_scrap_the_backpack_you_receive_from_the_quest/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
 3 weeks ago so no big deal that it was missed!
---
 I remember seeing a couple of them actually this is the one that got the most traction.
---
They aren't hoping to "get lucky" they just know some players would rather fork over caps than spend hours server hopping &amp; praying the vendor spawns with the right item.
---
Well ghoulish can swap easily with fireproof
---
Adrenaline is a rank 5, but marathoner and white Knight seem meh. Marathoner can be easily compensated with powered armor pieces. I have 3 on my sniper and his AP of 450 refreshes without 2 seconds. White Knight is kind of good, but it's preference really. 
---
Bloody mess you can probably run a rank 4 or even rank 3 makeshift warrior to help with bloody mess and adrenaline. 
---
You'd want a 4 or 5 in makeshift warrior, I can't remember what unarmed weapons requires rank 5... Maybe dcg? ü§î But the damage to the weapon isn't too bad, not one that you cant just repair rather easily. A few queen fights and you can run improved repair kits. 
---
But I like the revival stuff, that's important for your build so those are key factors in staying in the fight. Maybe do Unyielding powered sent/cav gear with a single piece life saving. Might not be that significant.
---
I guess in canon we can assume many creatures were eradicated (through targetted killing, disease, or eventually sucumbing to the negative effects of radiation) and died out before games set later in the timeline, while deathclaws continued to evolve and get deadlier
---
Perhaps it's as simple as the mutation is multiplicative and the the perk card is additive? To me, that makes sense. But, then again I haven't finished my coffee yet so a lot of things that shouldn't make sense currently do ;)
---
I see. I usually do the same with one of my purifiers.
---
Perhaps one of the simplest improvements would be a hide toggle with a show all option. I‚Äôd prefer a scrap option but hiding would be fine.
---
Yeah it astounds how much people seem to think all their shit is worth. I've seen Fastnacht masks (the common ones) for 10k each, people selling the spacesuit for 500, random trash tier legendaries for 1000.
---
I just hope that nobody is paying that much
---
I'm so dense I thought you meant a backpack made of hide until I read the comments.
---
But yeah I would like a backpack made from a radstag, kind of a davy crockett thing.
---
If he plays videogames and blows him self up do you think his wife is like "didn't you learn your lesson the first time"
---
If you're looking to trade that in, I've got TONS of  Legendary rolling pins I can let go cheap
---
Damn, I like this.  Gonna drop a bag before I leave a server now.  I've always wondered if I was really going anywhere.
---
Thanks! It's always something to look back on and wish you could feel all over again. No matter what game I'm enjoying there will be moments when I'm at the end of it all where I wish I could go back to that feeling again.
---
In game or IRL?
---
IRL: head to any American high school.
---
In game, crafting. Lots and lots of crafting. You planning on hitting a nuke silo?
---
With Chemist and Super Duper combined it's absolute no need thats true.
---
But also there is a market for everything.
---
This thread is so full of tasty tasty salt. I've said it before, ill keep saying it. A raider character is a perfectly valid character choice. 
---
These kids with the thousand expletive area chat were exactly that. Kids. Kids that likely have very little outside of gaming or their "clan" that being stomped into the dirt got them all triggered. Boohoo go cry to mommy, you tried raiding a bigger baddass. Suck it up.  
---
The raider role players tend to put more effort and time into their character than making a bloodied unyielding build and putting on a clown suit. They also tend to be of an older bent. 
---
To put it in perspective. You just curb stomped butch and his tunnel snakes when they thought they were the baddest of the bad. Jericho would just move on from a fight he couldn't win.
---
Why?
---
That's not a *bad* CPU. GPU and RAM are very important too, can you list them?
---
Yes but do you have a flag?
---
Makes me wonder, if it is ran in that order, why the hell isn;t #3 based off of the result of #2. Boom problem solved, no more enemies dropping items with less stars than they have. 
---
It does the legendary roll. Oh it's gonna drop a 1 star. So... I'm gonna be a three star enemy.
---
It defies logic. 
---
That all said, I may be misunderstanding what you mean by 'legendary script is ran' but from that I get that it means it rolls the RNG to see what it will drop? If it does do it that way, why do different people get different tier items from the same enemy?
---
No.
---
Gold. You deserve it.
---
Balance
---
I do it, I role play as a disturbed angry guy who cusses out spawn campers that always say 'Oh that's gonna get you banned, Bethesda does not like it when you say that'
---
Maybe I am just lucky because every day I get the quest I only have to pick up 2 pieces of goo off the floor.
---
 Even when I hand in the quest the 3 pieces that were in my inventory stay in my inventory for the next day.
---
 I'm on PS4 if that matters.
---
Yeah.
---
yeah!!
---
and automatics should get an automatic armor penetration on halfway through a clip by even 25% .. sure legendary autos can be nuts but base autos need some love esp. the 10mm smg
---
\*continues chanting\*
---
"nomo buwwetpunjess!!!" - \*
---
Well, I'm on PC, maybe my game is a 'little' less bugged ;)
---
I applaud your suggestion, would like to see that, but for all the major events (like the rare Mire ones).
---
As for Free Range, you don't really need a notification for that. Just FT to the motel, and the event will start. Annoys me to no end when I just want to check if Booomerr's event is available or not.
---
I'd suggest just throttling their support ticket system with refund requests.
---
If they're gonna false advertise then it's not unwarranted
---
No, it's a perk it should stack with weapon effects.
---
Like we all do it irl when we think a store is overpriced.
---
*Complain, sh*t on the counter and leave*
---
Seems that way!
---
You are absolutely right, All Rise isn't a very good weapon. But until OP has a bloodied/instagating/AA/Furious 2h melee weapon, the All Rise will suffice due to its weight reduction :D
---
You can check this by using the awareness perk to see how enemy damage resistances are effected by various perks or item effects.
---
Then why speed demon does not stack with anything?
---
All rise is my favorite. Named it, ‚ÄúAll Rise Motherf***er‚Äù
---
Ha! Thank you! Brevity has never been my strong point. Posts like this that I type are always tongue in cheek, which doesn‚Äôt always rub people the right way (hence the ‚ÄúF*** y** messages I sometimes get), but oh well. Shit happens. ;)
---
Cheaper ammo for auto rifles, cause they burn it super fast, which is annoying and absolutly not fun to farm each few hours.
---
If anybody has a cross check for vendor prices, I would defbe more accurate and generous with my pricing.
---
Hell no.  I am bloodied everything, btw‚Äîeven my combat armor.
---
For plans too.  Saw a guy selling handmade plans for super cheap.
---
Didn't buy them, since I already know them.
---
Oh!  Speaking of plans, he should also check train stations too.
---
Wouldn't a Bee Keeper be keeping the bees alive?
---
He not.  He ded.
---
Why do you think it needs balancing if it's for PVP there are easy ways to defeat a bloodied build like executioners weapons and radiation weapons.
---
I your friend does not want visitors then Y have a vending machine to attract players
---
I got really lucky and found a level 50 all rise on a vendor for pretty cheap, don‚Äôt have to go through the hassle of actually doing the quest
---
In my opinion thats the best name you could have chosen
---
Just expecting the trailer or release of first dlc wave 2 content, possibly focusing on NW gamemode
---
Increased movement speed while aiming is noticable while you have Speed Demon it stacks. If there is another effect I'm missing let me know. I also believe Gun Runner works with speed demon
---
So not sure what I did, or connection was better, but was able to play and had stable 55 fps.
---
Pretty much closed everything affecting CPU Usage and checked it thru Resource Monitor, skype and some other Windows 10 apps were running in background.
---
I'd sell it to a legendary vendor at a trainstation (the big vending machine). Start saving up some scrip with which you can buy other legendaries later! 
---
What level are you OP? I can check my stash for a nice two-handed weapon for ya
---
Yup, it's ironic and in line with Bethesdas sense of humor.
---
help him setup spring traps on all the spawn points .. so when a player warps in .. boing boing .. off the cliff
---
welcome mats only work in workshops for now .. to adjust your CAMP spawn point you need to move your CAMP device .. it usually places the visitor directly north of it .. or south of it facing north .. one or the other .. just move the thing walk like 5 feet and teleport to your CAMP and it'll put you at one of the spawn points.
---
I got a combat shotgun with explosive and anti armor, it goes shwoo shwoo and only takes like a fifth of a mole miner health... All pellets hit... Am i missing something ?
---
Balance = dying every time you make a mistake because your health is 19%.
---
&gt; If they get a chance to start their swing, they WILL hit you,
---
What's more, I **will** pick up their disease no matter if I one-hit kill them without them getting a chance to even touch me. I get that airborne diseases are a thing, but still...
---
Of course you are, because it is meta. There is nothing likebloodied build to have egouth damage, for this game not being annoying. 
---
So i would like, if bethesda nerfed bloodied little (like they did with TSE), but on the other had they should also nerf most creatures, because they eat fucking tones of ammo for no real reason. Why you need 4k 5mm ammo for one 100lvl legendary that drops one legendary item. I can have same item from 3bullet lvl 62 ghoul. .....
---
unstable isotope and electrical charge will bite you in the ass. players can come hit you till it procs and flag you for pvp, also if you try to defend a friends workshop thats being attack it can proc and turn the whole base against you. also the unstable isotop will kill you with radiation if you get swarmed by a pack of ghouls. 
---
no room in your build for traveling pharmacy so I added healing factor. you will only have to carry a few extra super stims that way you can stash and sell all the lessers. 
---
added sunkissed level 1. it will save you from having to carry more than one or two radaways and you will not want to be taking rad Xs at all. the sun cures the rads the healfactor replaces the health. 
---
shifted points from some of your defensive stuff into rifle. just get the highest damage snipers you can so you dont have to carry much ammo. 
---

you should run for something important cause I'd vote for you!

Nice! Was curious about this. I assumed they were not included.
---
stop using login on reddit, theres no place for that here sir!
---
Because if they do successfully get to his CAMP they deserve to veiw his vending machine.
---
That will be a good idea. When you got those skill... And the armor penetrating skills. I don't have them yet so the question is does somebody know if it's worth to get them while I use my AAE Lever. Or invest the skill points in other cards
---
https://youtu.be/2UaT87fhY1Q minimum specs are still more than necessary to play a game.
---
Then get ready to be disappointed. I'd have to find my notes again but I'm pretty sure my server hop success rate was around 10-20%. Meaning that only one of every 4-5 (mean) times I left a server, then clicked Adventure, was I sent to a server I had not yet seen. Taking into account that it took ~1m30s to go from leaving server A to being fully loaded into server B. Also account for that new server discovery chance decreases consistent with the rate of subsequent server hops; I discovered the majority of servers within the first 45-60m, and mostly spent my time checking my own paper bags the remaining two hours+.
---
There is a cap on how much you can 'speed up' things; if you were allowed to exceed it things would get screwy.
---
This is a good reason for speed demon - which by itself already caps movement speed and the speeding up of some animations like reloading - not to stack with anything.
---
Thank You.
---
I didn't even see any! lol 
---
Its funny that your eyes glaze over posts when your not really 'looking' for it as it were.
---
Tbh about three weeks ago I was looking into various vendor related posts and questions for my shop, so I certainly wasn't looking for it.
---
Congrats! Maybe Steve can come by and have a playdate with my Fluffy. :D
---
And here I was secretly judging bethesda that ! sometimes attacks my workshop. I will now further lower my standards and be happy its not something like you guys are dealing with.
---
I went to someones camp today. Said they 10 armor (most likely 10 asylum skirts) but the machine was completely sealed off by all means. Its not supposed to be possible, but it is. 
---
Dude trolled us hard then logged out lol.
---
My fusion generator is in a room with no doors or windows. No way in or out.
---
Couldn't be more annoying
---
An example of the bad side of humanity
---
You do realize this is a world that was paused right before Halloween, right. Costumes and masks should be abundant in a world like this.
---
You're pricing things right.  I sell a bit higher, but not by much.
---
I think guest spawn is the centre of your camp area so placing your camp device on the cliff edge should do the trick. It's a shame you can see vendor item catagories on the map else you could just fill your machine with salt :)
---
Yeah, thats 80% more damage from one effect. Why should it stack, when speed demon don't stack with faster reload, and most other legendary effect are useless.
---
Bloodied is meta, because it is only way to actualy kill something without wasting all ammo on one boss.  I would like to see other builds being "worth" not annoying to mantain.
---
We already have avatars and screen names showing. Maybe it wouldn't be hard to add or change your map symbol to reflect 'looking for team' or whatever, like how they change the camp logo when you're a vendor. 
---
In the meantime, I'm going to start hanging out at the upstairs bar in whitesprings, waiting to meet someone and essentially reliving my early 20's.
---
I've got demolition expert, I'm gonna get single shot after level 100. (lvl 96 atm)
---
I wish bugs and balance were higher priority...
---
When they nerfed TSE
---
yeah! its the bee knees!!
---
and no cheerleader top+skirt or pom poms??!?! WTF BGS!! FAIL!!!
---
Yeah this is a bit of a problem with survival mode,   a quarter of levels is too little and so is 50 as a cap if you ask me
---
Dataminers confirmed that speed demon dont stack with any movement speed increasing effects.
---
Also it does not stack with faster reload speed legendary modifier.
---
Fisto's like a glove
---
Building is so tricky it‚Äôs not fun.
---
Needs lots of improvements, camp limit still needs increasing, so does vendor limit as I‚Äôve got 17/30 items in my vendor and it‚Äôs saying camp full..,
---
If you need a good weapon and don't have one yet 2 star is the best bang for your buck. Only 2/9 3rd star effects are worthwhile to any non vats build
---
If you want perfect weapons then obviously three star.
---
Man it was a while ago...but I currently have I think 18 and they don't each produce 1 at a time...but after I've been dicking around for a few hours, they'll all be full
---
It is a problem for 2 weeks already. There were posts on this issue here or over at Beths forum. Maybe there should be more of them. Honestly, those of us, and i know a few that did, submitted tickets on their official support, should have been enough for Beth to aknowledge it and fix this issue.
---
But all you get is generated bot responses and it's a shame that those of us affected have to beg them for a fix.
---
I love Bethesda. But there's things where you just start to doubt that they are even worth your loyalty :/
---
Just hope for a fix. And so far being very thankful for all those that supported this post here.
---
PS4 original -  max agi, speed demon, marathoner, faster AP regen = if i run for few sec, game is not able to render objects around me.
---
me! I'll be on tomorrow, what's your gamertag?
---
gt renawana
---
Huh... I always felt it did I have a faster aim combat rifle tested it switched to a non faster aim and it definitely seemed quicker to me.
---
Nothing works with speed demon. I tested everything for max move speed since the beta.
---
Max speed limit is +20%. Nothing stack, you can have death man sprint and a move while aming legendary weapon and got also only 20%.  your running animation looks like you get a little boost while equipping the weapon but trust me there is no boost.
---
I do many tests with other people contests challenges and running tests. He got Speed demon I got all move speed skills + move while aming. Same speed.
---
Youre pretty close to mine so here are my humble suggestions. Perception is a throwaway category for melee, but keep 3 points for lockpick. Glowsight is helpful for some combat. Concentrated fire won't help you much. If you're going with Evasive and Barbarian you should consider Ironclad for more DR. Ghoulish isn't that helpful. I wouldn't use Revenant and Lone Wanderer as one is meant for teamplay and the other isn't. There is one melee perk in charisma that irradiates your enemies. If you ever play in a team I'd use strange in numbers and I'd definitely put that bloody mess up a rank for 5% damage.
---
Because speding thousand ammo on bosses is annoying, i would trade meta build for being able to play with other builds too.
---
This would help with cooking. As purified water isn‚Äôt used in their recipes
---
Why would you even have a mic on if you really wanted to pvp?
---
I would prefer the weapon proficiency cards (i.e., Rifleman) be consolidated down to one card of five ranks.  Drives me nuts that if I want max benefit, I have to spend 9 perk points.  The way Fallout 4 handled those perks worked quite well.
---
Yes, very frustrating :(

thx for your empathy dude.
---
If enough people complain at Bethesda, they'll move PvP further and further away from the people who don't want it.
---
I've always played Bethesda games because I'm an introvert who finds mean people exhausting, so I'm really not looking for that in a game.
---
Interesting... I may be seeing the Placebo effect.....
---
Try to make straight run and track time. Make video, if it stack make post.
---
So you want the so called "META" build nerfed and you have trouble defeating a Legendary enemy with the "META" build sounds like you are a little salty because you can't figure out the "META" build. Also try aiming at your target instead of praying and spraying.
---
I bet you used to run around with a TSE right?
---
Wood gear is only slotted for one star, best bet is to scrap it for scripts or sell it to a vendor before you log out and it changes from 3 or 2 starts to one star.
---
yes. especially when it's gamebreaking bugs like this :( for those of us being affected.
---
Anti Armor was always good in PvE too. I was running The Blade of Bastet since Mid December last year and then y'all finally caught on around February after you stopped circlejerking over your duped explosive shotguns.
---
Check this video of low-spec gamer playing fallout 76. https://youtu.be/5KG0tRXpx5Q
---
I'm not really into Fortnite, that's why I'm not too familiar with it, BR games aren't my thing. 
---
In every fallout game I played I always tried to have fun with my character. I always play them humorously and they always come out being sarcastic and not taking the apocalypse seriously, and with that I liked to dress them in a way that's entertaining to me as an individual. 
---
Again it doesn't matter what other people wear. As long as you're having fun and playing the game your way.
---
It may be a placebo effect. I'll test I'm also willing to admit I may be wrong.
---
Amen!!
---
I freaking love this
---
Maybe fix the other effects instead of nerfing this
---
I named my Gatling Plasma ‚ÄúLil‚Äô Fuzzy‚Äù, because I get a lil‚Äô fuzzy feeling every time I hold down the trigger.
---
The 3\* on weapons is often wasted and quite useless.  I guess some people just feel better if they have a 3\* but there's usually little to be gained from it.
---
Armor though should always be a 3\* roll...  the 3rd effect defines the god tier armor unlike weapons.
---
Vampire machete or a fireaxe, furious or instigating if you can find one, will do a good job on Mr Handy.   Combine that with a perk like incisor....
---
Try to hit appendages, not the body.  That seems to take Mr Handy and its variants out a lot faster.
---
What's the point of a nerf that would result in exactly the same results as no nerf? Lol.
---
What you're saying is that as a bloodied melee player, you are OP. 
---
Nerf melee as it's way over powered? I wouldn't want that, but it's more logical than nerfing  bloodied as a whole.
---
The issue I had when we had them....falling to death because my camp loaded too slow lol
---
No, West of the Station toward NAR Repair yard, Plan is on a wooden Crate in the train car
---
See, everything is organized into tiers by the hardcore tryhard gamer "meta"
---
Fallout's hardcore tryhard gamer meta is full of fucking loser morons, so they don't know what the fuck they are talking about.
---
Uh i did have few different weapons in my 600hours gameplay. 
---
Check title, i want to trade some percentage damage which you get by stacking mutation with legendary effect (why does adrenal reaction stack, when speed demon doesn't), for **bosses to be less bulletsponges**.
---
Its a skin but you need to craft it like any other equipment, and you need to have the back pack unlocked first
---
r/iamverybadass
---
It is nerfed you're a glass cannon with it. I've switched from it because everytime WS turns on the sprinklers I die.
---
Because having many diverse effective weapons makes the game more interesting.
---
depends on the type of gas some gasses displace O2 and some don't so filters will work on them it also protects against airborne pollutants like dust and certain chemicals and even some diseases that said no gas mask is 100% effective unless your in a full hazard suit with self contained oxygen tank 
---
that said my character can build a freaking nuke catapult I'm sure he can figure what kind of filter to use for general use apocalypse travel 
---
also its a game stop trying to kill fun with realism you want realism volunteer to patch up the leaking nuclear dome full of nuke testing waste and debate filter types there glhf
---
We can't say conclusively one way or the other there is simply insufficient data. OP definitely did use (in both tests that I saw so far) weapons that did low enough damage to targets with high enough ballistic resistance to potentially produce results that would initially appear misleading to those unfamiliar with how DR works in this game. OP has not (that I've seen) yet presented the remaining factors involved to say for sure either. /u/Imentet has the right idea here. Keep it simple and don't make assumptions. Use a nice round number with a target with seemingly 0 ballistic resistance (you did not report this though, apologies if I am mistaken). To *attempt* to make a conclusive statement the tests would have to be repeated *many* more times on a *wide* variety of targets (varying resistances) and even then that's just for ballistic resistance.
---
9?  All I ever get is 3 per day.

I wanna kill a deathclaw wearing my [hotdog suit!!](https://i.imgur.com/3iJ6W6X.jpg?1)
---
Its a sking but it works just like the assultron skin, you will end up with 2 different backpacks, and you need to unlock the backpack first before you can craft the new backpack
---
Replying to myself. Fast traveling to the Golf Club has totally become hit-or-miss these days. Adding to the annoyance that has always been there, other players already crouching in there when you thought you had your free slot of ghoul carnage, you now have to stop yourself from running in immediately to be safe from not yet loaded in enemies, but at the risk of another player FTing in and stealing your slot.
---
Then, even if you have the house to yourself, you might encounter low level (lvl 9) ghouls, or regular level ones but no legendary drops at all. If you encounter diseased robots (after a series of nukes, normally), that's actually fun: the legendary lvl1 eyebots drop great starter gear, and the max lvl liberators pose a real challenge because of their sheer numbers.
---
Ghoul behaviour is now all over the place, which I kinda like: sometimes they all rush at you from all over the club, like in the old days, sometimes most of them are asleep and either passive or aggressive, but normally they have their fixed locations where they will ambush you.
---
Keepin' it filthy since 2018. :D
---
I have sold the hunter's long coat for up to 7000 caps in recent history, if you found it for 3500 you found it at its current value.
---
I usually sell junk based on rarity, plans are the same way mostly, I always sell aid items below what the game says, and weapons are mostly non legendary so those prices are cheap as well
---
That‚Äôs the point, take away the extras so everyone can have some sort of cool weapon of there own.
---
first off..... its hard to duct tape something to your hand while your in that suit... second off..... yeah I got nothing
---
If I run anywhere it takes ages for everything to render, not to mention those awful lighting glitches you get 99% of the time now.
---
I've tried what you describe before OP, but they're glitchy empty shells lol.
---
So hit them with a big stick no ammo needed
---
BE weapons have much more damage, than any other legendary effects. If you nerf bloodied this way and bosses too, you will actualy boost other builds.
---
Tea party simulator '76
---
Lol nice
---
PvP should be removed completely from adventure mode.  Introduce a different mechanism for contesting a workshop - some sort of PvE defend contest.  Victor gets the most points/kills in the workshop defense and gains ownership of the workshop.
---
Let the PvP trolls go mess with their own kind in Survival mode.
---
Maybe, but bethesda did only nerf TSE in half a year. I am giving them easier way, than improving every other effect and trying to be Thanos.
---
I don‚Äôt watch sports and had never heard of JPP or his accident before.  What a horrifying accident and what an amazing recovery.  Shame to think what could have been but for that accident.
---
That purveyor is something else. I saved up for the 3 star and finally had enough scrips, only to get a legendary fucking golfclub.
---
How does one tame? Is it didn't then pacifying it?
---
Yeah, that is why i am bloodied melee. 
---
But comeon, you think legendary effect and boss hps are right?
---
Flux, formula p,
---
Some things I have seen what most people are buying them from the trade sites and go a little lower than that, and then some things I take a guess at it. If it doesn't sell after a week or so then I start dropping the prices.
---
so you're the reason for all the lag! \*ignites pitchfork\*
---
I have noticed on occasion when I load in random other buildings appear then dissapear then mine appear .. I thought it was cause I was server hopping and those CAMPS on other servers were cached .. 
---
but yeah loading then unloading then loading would indeed increase load times
---
some are better than others..
---
at the end of the day.. people who want to move their hoarded junk will do so by having lower prices..
---
I shop...
---
Being that you're used to keyboard and mouse AND a controller, I'd say go with the control scheme you're best at.
---
Were these not in the Atom Shop last weekend? could have sworn i saw them on there on the promo bit all individually priced.
---
Definitely
---
He's an amazing player with shitty luck. He may miss the 2019 season because of a neck injury from a car crash. 
---
I may joke about his incedent but I have a crazy amount of respect for a player who can come back from that injury.
---
So I switched to bloodied from a power armor melee build I have slaughtered thousands of enemies between my Anti Armor Pole Hook and my Instigating Grog Axe and never had any difficulty defeating any enemy but when I switched to bloodied I had to learn a whole new play style I had to be sneaky and aware of my environment because a mob of mole rats can kill you. In reality my power armor build is 100x better then my "meta" bloodied build but I like the challenge of a bloodied build.
---
If you're on pc hit me up and I'll help. Also need to make the same quest so we cool
---
Bosses are to easy
---
I'd say it's the hotspot.  Which another bad thing about that is quickly hitting and/or exceeding your data cap.
---
Tagging, I have a pretty good 2 star laser gattling that I am not sure if anyone would want or if I should just put it in the machine to scrap.
---
Good idea. My camp is on a riverside, but it is tiresome pressing the collect button a hundred times then 50 times to boil then, then cook the things I carry...
---
Well thinking about it im going to take you at your word since yesterday I did notice that one of my purifieriers had 5 in one had 2 and the rest had zero. 
---
So the logic of what you are saying holds true for me. 
---
Which is good since I get my budget space and rid of some of those big cumbersome machines :)
---
hmm at that point it seems to download the atom shop data and newsfeed .. maybe check your router you might be inadvertenly be blocking some outbound connections .. I've done this before .. or try to do a repair in the launcher .. another thing run it in admin mode
---
Thank you all so much for the tips and advice made some changes what do you all think.
---

---
Well yes, but actualy no.
---
They are easy, because there is not any tactic mechanics. But they are hard because they are fucking bulletsponges and have insane damage (looking on you lvl 100fog clawler)
---
Awesome! Love it! I will share this with my friend.
---
(My CAMP is not anywhere near a cliff and is actually near a train station, so I do get some visitors)
---
Bandwidth also. As well as extra unescecary server load.
---
Hopefully never. Have you seen the state of that place when you mention this game? Lol
---
Seems these things fall to bottom of the barrel for development/ upkeep as its not 'game changing' (i'd argue it is because there's no way you can complete those challenges if all you're looking at is the UI), the games in a much better place than it was, but for this to happen without them addressing it at the very least is just whack.
---
A real shame about this outfit. I really like some of its features, like the tire shoulder armor, but the discoloured 'saggy boob' pockets and the duct tape cross(es?) below make me say thanks, but no thanks. :-(
---
Thanks for the advice I have updated it
---
\&gt;  I know this is going to turn into a "Keyboard/Mouse vs Controller" discussion 
---
I have a different spin. 
---
I only have so much free time, soit can take me (months) to complete any give game.   
---
Computers being what they are...as the manufacturer releases updates and patches, it affects a wide variety of items across the OS.  At some point, an update will break the game.
---
  Game tech support blames the OS mfr, the OS mfr blames the game, and cites progress and security of the OS.  
---
Eventually, game tech support tells you : we speced and wrote that game for 
---
OS version x, but you are running version X+2, and we don't support that version.  If you want to continue playing, /downgrade/ your OS.  Ummm...no.  
---
Never had that problem on (PSx), regardless of the age of the game, or how long it takes me to complete it...
---
That is one of them... And becuase of how collision is implemented people may or not perhaps had been able to speed through the terrain unimpeded.
---
sometimes when you enter an area it shows all the things that spawn there ... but they're not there on that server or any longer ... this aggravates the hell outta me as I usually load into an area before it's done updating .. unless you got the bobbleheads and recipe out of the safe .. then I don't know
---

Console players are more likely to be teenagers.  Most teenagers get consoles before the get a gaming PC.  PC crowd = more mature.
---
Yeah, im seeing more textual and motion glitches than during beta. And the camp building has changed dramatically downward. I have my awesome treehouse that clipped through a big tree nicely and when my bro tried to replicate...would not work, nor would many other things (floor over a staircase not settinf, floating items that are NOT floating and show green but will not place, and the newest glitch for me in camp building....lagging, jittery build mode) 
---
Im a superfan, blindly following FO games no matter what.....but even im starting to get frustrated.
---
At some point, I'll quit getting excited about camp items or new skins if the game is relatively unplayable. 
---
I would gladly wait on new atom store items or new events for some game play repair!!!!
---
They do stack but with diminishing effect.
---
Also, you can use a console controller on a PC but you can't use mouse and keyboard on a console.
---
Mods are normally 99% of these kinds of problems, and are hella hard to get out of the system. They mess with the texture loading.
---
There are a few .ini files in the Documents &gt; My Games &gt; Fallout 76 folder that control how the textures load. You can safely delete/rename them and the game will recreate on next start up.
---
Did you already do the Scan/Repair from the Bethesda Launcher?
---
Because its in the simpsons and simple minded idiots might consider it insensitive as they did with apu... even if most fans thought him a legend. :P
---
I actually like the idea and i would love to come accross a role player in such a suit.
---
Perks are mess but there are a few things in game that are a waste of our time. like server hopping. it seems to be a hole in the core design that the player cant reasonably get what they need so they end up exploiting a game mechanic. for me, I run solo and cant hold workshops. so fusion cores are a problem keeping me from using PA. I also gave up on firearms as a primary weapon cause I always ran out of ammo. maybe they should also consider allowing ammo to be bulked and broken down so it could be made into something useful.
---
I like your perk profile the best, maybe an alternate method could be a camp slot with S.P.E.C.I.A.Ls that allows you to assign perks assigned to be active in camp, but they would need to maybe make assignable camp points an third option after you max out a lvl 50.
---
Hey man, just replying to let you know it worked!
---
I disabled my Anti-Virus and ran it in admin mode, then I got a notification from Windows Defender asking if I wanted to let the program function on private/public networks, after giving that the OK it worked fine, thanks so much!
---
&gt;  that ! sometimes attacks my workshop
---
I'm seeing that a lot, it's always Radtoads in my case.
---
Being Thanos would be the Nerfing you know **snap** half the power gone. It's the easy lazy way out. Basically a knee jerk reaction to players crying on here. They worry more about PvP than PvE I never PvP it's cool if you do but it's not for me.
---
TBH If duping wasn't so easy TSE's would've never been a problem.
---
Nope.
---
So I am curious what is your bloodied build? What's your best weapon damage
---
yes, so far i know of italian, russian, german and now, also french being affected.
---
thanks for adding this and hopefully bring it to Beths attention. to hopefully get a fix on this annoying bug.
---
We used to relog in world of warcraft to get thru some locked doors, do you think i can run so fast i could do this? :D  Silo is too small for this, but i may test it somewhere. I can get in people camps before they load, but i never thought about exploting this.
---
My TSE lazer is "Shooty Shooty Bang Zap"
---
I have a camp up there, it‚Äôs an airport and I see no point in hiding in the building? Ppl are weird. Haha. Maybe ppl hide in there because they are sick of ppl blowing their shit up for no reason haha. 
---
Fallout has no PVP, pretty much all PVP footage I see is epic trash, jump around whitespring station, lasers lasers and some more lasers, cool? It takes no skill to kill people in this game. 
---
There are NO raiders in this fallout because there is nothing to raid. Sure you can trick ppl who aren‚Äôt into PVP and maybe get a tiny amount of trash but you truly can not take anything from anyone. Maybe if they didn‚Äôt shit the bed with the survival mode things would be better. 
---
My vote for PVP servers are no legendary, drop EVERYTHING on death, increase the strength of CAMPs but 50x but make stash boxes lootable. I really don‚Äôt think the ‚ÄúPVP community‚Äù would even play that because they don‚Äôt actually want PVP, they want ‚Äúwars of the best traders‚Äù lulz pew pew laser gun haha
---
Thank you, ill do that on my lunch break today!!! I love the lore and background stories of fallout so I'm looking forward to reading this!

oh shit u right

Sometimes, when I loot a second Tech Data (when I already have one in inventory), the item will appear on the ground next to where I'm standing instead of just failing to add to inventory.  I've had the same thing happen when I loot duplicate Launch Codes from a Scorched Officer.  Also, happens on rare occasions when I loot a duplicate Plan that I already know.
---
To pull this off - of course heard from a friend of a friend, I most definitely never was involved in this like totally ever - the assistance or a third party tool might have been required. Probably.
---
I had AAE assault rifle and EE double-barrel shotgun few weeks after release. On man it was doing crazy damage back then (still lower than BE weapons).
---
Idk suspect they over nerfered the damage because my double barrel double shot explosive does less damage than 1 hit with my Bowie knife.  *Shrug
---
Yea, same here. I recently started putting one of each clothing item in the machine rather than multiple copies at a time and I only sell somewhat rare or harder to find pieces.
---
yay .. welcome to the rest of your life
---
I love the evil dead so I had to name a shotgun My boomstick.
---
THIS IS MY BOOMSTICK!
---
What's your damage per hit
---
Maybe they‚Äôd just had IT reboot and it was all the rage /s
---
Nope what?
---
I don't. I sell chems, and booze.
---
I'd love to have either one of those. I've never even seen an Executioners Explosive in the game.
---
Ah the good ole days of having my 200% repaired power armor broken in 1 barrage of a TSE dragon. How I don't miss thee.
---
Ammo is very easy to make, especially if you know where to find a ton of lead. Lucky hole mine and excavator power armor will get you about 100 or so lead ore which breaks down to 5 lead each. I farm the snallygasters that are always at toxic Joe's for acid.
---
The Purveyor is the worst.  I received 2 x wood 3\* pieces earlier today only to find them in my inventory as 1\*.   Does anyone know if this is being addressed by Bethesda?
---
I try to be creative with my favorite weapons like my Instigating, SS, RW Deathclaw Gauntlet is named "Velociraptor" and my Instigating, Explosive, +PER Lever Action is named "Dead of Night" because it has a night vision Scope, but all weapons get a "1" prefix so the stay at the top of the list, and some are simple names that fit their style like "Pokey" (Combat Knife), "Wacky" (Machete), "Smacky" (Bat), My Furious Explosive Handmade is "Get-er-Done".
---
Armor gets an underscore prefix to keep it at the bottom, and simple code like "\_Van WWR LL" or "\_Sneaky WWR Chest" (Chameleon of course).
---
Nope, concentrated fire doesnt work with melee.
---
And not sleep with the fishes.
---
Revenant can be activated by mysterious savour saw I vid of it happening it epic.

---
What happens when you log out and log back in?\\
---
the place where visitors will spawn is where you first placed your camp device, if you move it afterwards (without placing camp device again and paying 40caps) you adjust where you will spawn, but others will spawn at that first place you put your camp down. 
---
the owner and visitors spawn at different places so you need someone else to test it for you
---
Ok thanks I took it off in the updated version
---
ballistic ammo should sell by 10s in player vendors...
---
 Where did I do any bragging or make outlandish claims? I made a series of observations, about how this thread is full of tasty raider salt, and about how raiders in this game tend to behave. Why not go check out a couple of the more popular subs that have popped up for them, and see that many of us are going to great lengths to meet our characters roles. 
---
Eg. I have scrounged and traded and shopped for weight reduction robot and raider pieces for my "scrap demon" that lives in the savage divide with bone charms decorating the house I've built as a raider bar. Even says barkeep out front in Greek letters. 
---
These kids with the clown costumes are likely still in the munchkin stage of rpgs. Where they want the best build, they wanna be the baddest of the bad. Not create flawed characters to play the role of. I know the meta is high damage over dps but I still run heavy guns for the satisfying roar during pve. Im no baddass, I'm just heavy weapons guy
---
I dont complain.. I mournfully wish...
---
Instructions unclear. I attempted a blind-folded staring contest with a Deathclaw by bringing an animal that I thought was my friend into survival mode.
---
This weapon is not "god tier" people like to throw that term around alot. It would have to have a third stat of damage resist or reload speed.
---
God tier is referred to as a BiS item, and since an identical roll, with the third affix added, would be even slightly better, it is not the best in slot.
---
Reading your replay a terrible thought came to mind.... perk loadouts locked behind the comming legendary players / prestige system....
---
Grinding to 50 again just to have one loadout.... *shivers*
---
In endurance I would say get rid of revanant in place of adamantium skeleton or fireproof. Those are both must haves imo. Possibly even take off ghoulish, in my expierence even 3* doesn't provide enough protection from any modded out gamma gun. 
---
In charisma I would take 2 points out of tenderizer and put them into another card like suppressor or lone wanderer. At 3* tenderizer is still only a 7% chance. Might as well keep it at 1* for a 5% chance and gain the extra percentage from another card. 
---
In agility I would say ditch evasive completley and don't run with white knight on. I run without white knight and my armor takes a decent amount of time to break, there are more useful cards. For an unarmed bloodied build I would say cards like dead man sprinting, action boy/girl, marathoner to keep moving. 
---
This is all opinon based off my own PvP bloodied unarmed build. But everyone likes to run different things :)
---
...and it only took two billions hours!
---
Yep! That and the giant crickets have been the two I've seen lol.
---
I'd stroll over to leader of the pack, one violent night and uranium fever .. and when nobody is around whitesprings golf club .. you need a bloodied weapon .. doesn't matter if it's lower level than you or not just get one .. but after level 20 you need to start replacing legendary weapons with better legendary weapons or the tediousness of this 'survival' bs is gonna kick you in the butt .. constant repairs .. constant ammo .. constant disease, hunger thirst etc
---
Accidentally started hitting one the other day at someone's camp. My bad, deathclaws still got me freaked when they were King.  New Vegas days. Taming is next on my things to do in game.
---
Tame by going rigtt up to them? Does that mean melee users can tame now?
---
No. God tier means BiS. This weapon would have to have the third stat of DR while aim, or reload speed to be considered a "god tier" shotgun for bloodied builds.
---
Well, at least it went cleanly through and it's not *in* the knee so at least Ricky bobby has that going for him.
---
While you‚Äôre in the air hit the jump button again and hold it if you want to fly higherüëå
---
Ah ok thanks. So still worth to get the skills
---
I still need to do this, if someone wants to do a suicide pact in game? :P (Im on PC) I will be on tonight....
---
same unfortunately .. I assumed that would be the issue .. maybe had the game running too long or something but nope .. although this morning I updated graphics drivers and haven't played yet though so .. iunno it sucks I want a keypad cause all the cool kids got one!!!
---
I had a similar thing yesterday but I was the one asking. Found a random guy at his base, he had built it like 5 stories tall, messaged him saying I needed to revive someone, could he help? After maybe 10 seconds, he took off his armor, climbed to the top of his base, and jumped, dying in front of me. I revived him and thanked him. He didn‚Äôt even want anything in return. 
---
People bitch about this game but it might have one of the best communities in gaming.
---
I've been tracking my results from the Purveyor, and it's not so bad with 3\* Ranged weapons (8% = great rolls, including 2 Explosive weapons so far), but armor sucks with a full 40% Wood (You got screwed again) Armor.
---
I noticed this also the camp pieces are different then anything I have ever built with. Maybe it was the previous players camp that was on the server.
---
You like a 50-50 chance to die every time you jump off a ledge?
---
Well, I spent a lot of time at the site taking out the Snallygasters and didn't get the "rotating gold arrow of lag loading" anywhere.  The Recipe and both Bobbleheads were just sitting on counters/furniture and not in the safe.  Probably should have immediately read the Recipe or used the Bobbleheads rather than trusting inventory accounting, eh?
---
Spanish version it's also affected. They fixed one or two possum entries, but other still bugged and/or broken. PC version
---
Can't tell numbers, but i can oneshot 52lvl mr.gusty without sneak. 
---
Fallout wiki have 655hps at 52lvl gusties, and i reduce only 75% of armor, so  somewhere around 700dmg per hit. 
---
I didn't max strengh and i don't have unyelding armor. I saw you can go up to 4k damage per hit.
---
Ignore down votes. Probably are bots set up to down vote everything posted here.
---
I disagree with preset sets because it would allow for the changing of build/metas mid-combat.
---
Sooner than latter, even without certain cards, the only enemies that will pose a threat are:
---
- SBQ
---
- Sheepsquatch
---
- Yao Min
---
- Mobs
---
Oh..... bugs, curse them to hell!
---
Enjoy while it lasts lol
---
Play harder play more
---
The real issue is also the lighting bugs happening on non english versions... that was a weird fix, just putting the game in english to not get full bright everything after some times....
---
&gt;you have to literally go next to them, then the tame option appears even when you are not aiming at the creature.
---
Wow, was that in the patch notes?

Didn't see it last night.. but tonight?

Nope.

L30...if you haven't already, go pick up both the mysteries quest and the excavator quest.  Then roam around in the ash heap.
---
  At this point, you should have also roamed and discovered most places in both the forest and toxic valley.  You might have already picked up roses quest, but it will take you to areas you are not quite ready for.
---
If you have a good melee weapon, you should be able to venture into whitesprings when it is not nuked..perhaps in conjunction with part of another questline.
---
If you want max benefits it is fair to have to sacrifice 9+ perk points.
---
Unlimited data, so that's fine, but have to get good connection.
---
Same. Recently I feel like players don't appreciate my fully stocked store with something in every category. If I can warn players that they won't find armors and 3-stars here, that's a win for both of us.
---
But if you need bears, bobbles, and bug parts...
---
Or have the option to hide them for example.
---
Low lvl player area, maybe they just don't have enough money or they spend it at the trainstation nearby.  You might want to try to move to an area with more circulation.  You might also want to get some plans and weapons to bring people to you.  I would totaly buy from you at those prices if i stumbled on your camp, but not stumbelling on it I wouldn't fast travel to it only seeing junk, ammo and pharma for sale.
---
Exactly, true PvP players mute the mic so you don't see their speaker in the bushes...
---
This is why we don't bring junk to events.
---
"Dont take something with you that you ain't prepared to lose"
---
I price all mags and bobbleheads at 25 caps each. The mags sell out fast. I currently have 30 plus bobbleheads in my machines but nobody buys them even for a quarter of the price. Kinda dumbfounding.
---
Yeah I agree, while it is alright they are hardly "God" tier after the nerf anymore... I love my shotty's but they arent what they used to be and I am still seriously thinking of going to a heavy build now. I have already started a new melee character and I can honestly say at level 37 that character is already more deadly than my lvl 127 with the "God tier" guns....
---
Danke!
---
I use 4 pieces of unyielding and 1 chameleon and my bloodied knuckles do 800ish and my Deathclaw Gauntlet does 1284.
---
Cool, thanks for the tip. 
---
At lvl 30 I changed to focus on melee as my build to some success. I also run a silenced gauss to soften targets. Lately at lvl 62 I‚Äôve been playing with heavy weapons and having fun, but not having any related perks they don‚Äôt have any stopping power.
---
Why is that wrong?
---
If you think it should be allowed only outside of combat, I don't see a problem - it can work same way as health regen - it starts when you're outside of combat, so card sets can work in the same way.
---
I have 2 shot automatic handmade that I lovingly refer to as my double plugger.
---
For those that don't speak Australian a double plugger is an exceptionally well made thong/jandal/flip-flop.
---
Nice
---
You're getting downvoted to hell, but you speak truth.
---
Because apparently he thinks he‚Äôs at a Bethesda board meeting
---
Oh believe me...when I first installed them in November I was like "Wow!!!  60 per hour!?"  Assumed after 5 minutes I'd check and they'd all be full - I'd collect my 25 and wait again...
---
Nope...a few had none, a few had 2 and one had a single...
---
It makes no sense but it's how it is...
---
Wonder if it was loaded with nostalgia and references to the 2040's.
---
Also, thats why i sell fusion cores at 60 caps for 100% charge. I rarely server hop so i can get a bunch of them with little effort, but i dont use PA generally. So i like to help out people that do. However i would not be suprised if prople buy them to resell, but it puts a smile on my face if i see a PA user standing at my vendor machines when the notification pops up.
---
I would also love to bulk my less valuable ammo to sell for a better price. The .38 would go for 2:1 caps or 3:1 caps.
---
thx dude! it's just that i sometimes don't understand it. i'm not out for sympathy points, in fact i rarely post on here, but do only about an issue to get hopefully a fix.
---
however, thx man!
---
Before this will work they need to make locations preload before you finish fast travelling! Otherwise the mat isn't going to help!
---
Yeah that's what I was hoping for when they said player vending was coming: a big area full of stalls like at WS or Top of the World
---
seems to be as i thought, all non-english versions being affected...thx for adding this dude!
---
The wasteland changed us man.
---
Let's hope it will help for a fix dude.
---
I would say fuck revenant and take 2 3 points from Str into End and get the ironclad lvl 5 perk
---
*deep breath*
---
**RRRRRAAAAAIIIIIDDDDEEEEERRRR**
---
Heavy weapons are extremely fun. I have been using the Gatling gun and have an anti armor as well as a vampire one. Both are great in combat I tried using melee but my character never survives against most enemies who can hit you like a truck and absorb bullets like they were nothing. That's not just mutants, all enemies seem to be tanks.
---
the light bug is only on non-english game? wow, didn't knew that lol
---
Just added my first real attempt at selling armour. Set of  B.O.S deep pocketed armour (chest/arms/legs).
---
Is that good "clothing" or not worth selling ?
---
Cool story bro.
---
I‚Äôve been doing it wrong all along after all.
---
Try using a yellow jump suit, a white cape, red gloves, and red boots.
---
Oh and be sure to change your characters head do bald.
---
My pet peeve are the spawn campers in Survival mode who sit around spawn camping each other and dying over and over and hurling stupid insults and saying shit you hear in like Black Ops 3 MP games. Boring, stupid, lazy, and makes me not want to enter survival again.
---
def. give it to the female and tell her it's a gift from me .. and yeah sounds like she hooked you up in the past show her you appreciate it and return the favor .. but def. tell her it was from me
---
Help her out, she‚Äôll appreciate it for sure ü§ô
---
I really don't know, i just found some russian guy who said to put the game in english to fix it... and he was right... I didn't have any full bright moments since !
---
One benefit for pc is that the patches are generally smaller than in consoles from what i have seen.
---
Last patch is the exception because bethesda fucked up and deployed an incorrect lighting file by accident. Then had to revert it :)
---
So if you have slower internet speeds that might be something to consider.
---
I was stuck at your name. "Why does bot have brotherhood flair?" I was thinking.
---
I see it now, you are synth! BURN!
---
Well ive actually got a lot of ideas running through my head now to alter the camp, since I had to put the fusion generators on the roof with concrete wall defences to hide them which looks ugly.
---
Now I can actually have room to put them at the back of the base in safety away from those stray scorched bullets that keep flying across the camp.
---
Plus its less time checking the purifiers lol. Clearly the point here is more doesn't always mean more!
---
Awesome damage calculator, big thx for linking it!
---
I had a clown outfit on to do the level up challenge the other day, and I forgot it was on and went around to people's camps checking their machines. Then I went back to afk in my camp and when I came back the orbital camera was showing me with my hideous costume on. I was honestly embarrassed(as dumb as it sounds) that so many people saw me in it. 
---
My general fashion goal in games is to dress as an NPC and blend in with the world I'm playing in. The clown suit sure doesn't do it for me.
---
That's not true. I tamed one last night from a distance, but it only works with weapons without a scope for some reason. 
---
Funny note, my sloths and claws never last long. All being level 21 they get destroyed if too many level 60+ enemies attack my base. Yet somehow the longest lasting pet I've ever had was a level 5 mirelurk. Citizen Snips could tank like a mofo.
---
I PvP and have had a child threaten to put a glock to my head. I have had other players threaten to ban and hack me. These threats come from more than one side of the player base (PvP and raiders)
---
Thanks to my thirst for Nukashine, I‚Äôve discovered the Skyrim intro Easter egg, the mad hatter dinner table scene from alive in wonderland and snoopy‚Äôs dog house from peanuts. I love this game.
---
as you will find in my post it says that this is a workaround ppl can do. but how does it help those that don't speak english at all? or not good enough to understand the tasks? this is a workaround for some, but by far no solution. and not the solution it needs.
---
however, thx for this add.
---
oh my god and there are no challenges for me to get those 500atoms i need.
---
The very reason my lever has never came out the box. My setup, a combat rifle will out perfom it, with a double tap, as will the handmade (all non legendary).
---
was waiting for a reply to confirm, just in case.
---
Thanks. Given her and her friend things in the past. Think this might top it ;)
---
My guy!!! üôå
---
I'll make sure to tell her you helped me decide ;)
---
If it was attacking other creatures, or had 2 dead babies with it, it's not tamable.
---
Don‚Äôt engage them, the joke is on them.
---
for next time .. in your Fallout76Custom.ini add this
---
\[HAVOK\]
---
fCharacterMaxSlope=190.000000
---
you'll be able to gentle walk down the side of the hole far enough to loot the bag
---
PC has mods - sweet sweet mods.  I don't know how I'm going to be able to play the game without at least the perk loadout manager.  The time Bethesda broke it hard in a patch, I did little in game until Keretus was able to fix the mod.
---
Me myself - I hate controllers too.
---
Sole Survivor would seem to qualify for what you have described.  Just picked one up yesterday to add to my rifle collection. 
---
Perked up properly I‚Äôm going to give it a whirl in survival mode tonight.
---
And you are noticing the poor effort by bethesda after several months, of course!
---
Same here, those pockets killed it for me.
---
In FO4 I had a baseball bat that was tricked out called Corporal Punishment that I used on Institute baddies.
---
Wasn't it though? What content have they added to PVE?
---
Switching card sets only outside of combat I am totally fine with!
---
I feel like that's bannable.
---
Snally‚Äôs. Thoses fkers take real damages from nothing.
---
I have high level visitors time to time. And I have some rare plans and nice weapons for sale.
---
I wont move the camp. I spend way too much time to find the location aswell more hours to build it. It is just a treehouse, but it would be a nightmare to build it again somewhere else.
---
Also my wife likes that place, so she will murder me if I move it away even an inch, lol :) But thats my problem, I know :)
---
I try to price things for what I wouldn't mind paying if I wanted or needed them, and must be doing OK as my sales have been great, but while trying to find things to spend my excessive amount of  Caps on, I find the craziest prices on stuff, Serums for 1000 caps or more is common, ammo &amp; Junk at vendor prices, crap 3\* weapons for 10,000 caps, but then sometimes you find stuff stupid cheap, I bought a bunch of Bobble heads last night for 20 caps each, and found 1200 rounds of Ultracite 308 for 1 cap each.
---
Yeah if animal run away, you can do it, if you are not melee and other hundred reason why i failed there, haha. Good job.
---
Because this is a fallout game. There's literally hundreds of Battle Royale games for you to play
---
I work on PC every day, love my PC.
---
For gaming I prefer console, I use XBOX, I enjoy the fact that almost everything (nowadays we‚Äôre getting more and more options) is on their end, I just turn on my machine and play.
---
Console pros:
---
- Plug &amp; play
---
- Less cheating
---
- Controlled environment
---
PC pros:
---
- Way more customization
---
- Way more hardware options
---
- If the hardware is right, better performance
---
Have fun!
---
This has happened to me before except my game crashed afterwards so I‚Äôm not sure
---
ugg Im such a fool. Okay thanks! So the jet pack doesnt work on the ground? You jump first and then it kicks in? That makes sense!
---
In FO4 I had a baseball bat that was fully upgraded called the Baseball Boio. Which I used on BOS baddies.
---
i named my shotgun \_Shotgun and my handmade rifle \_Rifle
---
It does look a little blue but the good thing is u can't accidentally drop it or sell it once u add the paint
---
Drop a new bag next to the fissure there's a 50/50 shot your junk will teleport to the new bag.
---
The problem is that bethesdas only major updates for this game have been for PVP stuff, and it looks like that's going to continue. 
---
for people who want to play this game and have absolutely no interest in PvP stuff, it sucks that we don't get any updates for pve content
---
&gt;*fetus position*
---
Fetal position. Thanks for the laugh.
---
I've lost my loot bag into the fissure before - don't worry, we all do dumb things.
---
it must be on your end cause fallout76 is a top quality product with zero glitches, bugs or outdated code ... it was probably a dream you had from all those narcotics!!!
---
I am a historian.
---
The US Civil war was fought for the same reason as all the others: money and power.
---
Just go read Lincolns 1st innaugural address, the southern states succession declaration letters, and Lincolns War Declaration. They spell it all out, and can all be found in their original form online.
---
Give it to her. Chances are you'll roll a better one in the purveyor eventually that will sell for alot more. This will make her happy right now.
---
I would suggest that Bethesda add a "PvP" icon to your HUD whenever a party member places the group in PVP mode.  That way you would have received a notice when you were vulnerable giving you an opportunity to store your loot.  
---
Alternatively, you could suggest to your party members not to take workshops and place all of you in PVP mode...
---
One of these came bouncing down past my head when I left Modus' bunker once, it really seemed like someone had thrown it at me.
---
As it looked like an actual plan (same graphic) of some description I panic-clicked like mad to try and catch it but was lucky it didnt work as I noticed just after that it had the "steal" tag.
---
Also rogue not Rouge.  Rouge is French for red.
---
Ace i'll head down this route! i have just finished and left rose (Some difficult mobs i was defo not ready for haha). after picking up the item needed to carry on and have the excavator PA and just recently finished the mysteries.
---
out of interest, is it worth me spending my time to get up the pioneer scouts ladder?
---
warp into tennagra town (sp?) and just walk str8 theres usually an albino or other rare type by giant hole
---
First just because someone PvPs in adventure mode does not mean they are griefing. Second, That is a great idea an entirely PvE server?!
---
The first type could also be just trying to free up inventory space.  I had to do a bit of that early on and sold stuff well below the market value.
---
Np and don‚Äôt feel bad I bet everyone was like ‚Äògot jet, how do I fly‚Äô at first lol. I think the design is quite clever actually because if you have mutation like marsupial you can jump to certain height then activate jetpack to go even higher. If it kicks in on the ground your marsupial will be wasted.
---
From the looks of this community in most of its comments, most people here don't really care about the solo PVE content. 
---
Seems that most people here are all about the PVP and Battle Royale stuff. 
---
Good for y'all I guess. Thank god for fallout 4 and mods
---
fuck I misremembered that. It's funny because I'm the one who just updated the (Fandom) wiki, too :P

To bad this is a multiplayer game
---
I think naming them in that game wasn‚Äôt hard because the plot helped a lot.  My fat man was called the Red Glare from the national anthem
---
Aloof... Come on... whats the diffrence between vault and wasteland?
---
On both sides are lots of robots, plenty of food - okay the food is a little bit more "tasty" then before, i agree - but even more space now than before. And between us...we know that some were as annoying as mole rats are - not looking in your direction Billy Bob *cough*
---
But nice to see you again after reclamation buddy - how is the spouse doing? Was fun playing blast radius with both of ya all night long back then, we should keep it up someday.
---
I‚Äôll remember that for (hopefully not) next time
---
Would they even be happy then?
---
 with melee you may already know, but the timing is different than firearms. the first shot needs to be a sneak attack and heavy hit (right bumper). In face to face brawling alternate blocking and quick hits. (L&amp;R triggers). A jump out and back in gives you the extra second if you can time another heavy hit. VATS is not helpful and sometimes gets you killed. 
---
Also have to make amends with jumping out and running away with the intent of dispersing the dog pile that will kill you. 
---
Like me with heavy guns, I don‚Äôt have any perks or legendarys to buff the damage. So it‚Äôs mostly just play.
---
You would think that‚Äôs common knowledge but I am surprised how many people use their mics in survival mode.  It‚Äôs like getting circled on the map without making the top 3 on the leaderboard.
---
My favorite was about a month ago I‚Äôm sneaking and scouting near the train station at WS and there‚Äôs 5-6 players in full on battle royale and I pop a couple of shots and stagger a guy who speaks up on his mic ‚Äúha ha ha ha you didn‚Äôt kill me‚Äù and then 2 seconds later someone else caps his ass.  Best part about it was the 10 year old Bart Simpson voice.
---
I JUST got one from the metal box outside the nukashine. 1st and only one thus far
---
Some developers listen to fans, so i did post for comunity to talk about what i think is problem, because i care about this game.
---
The respawn point should be either the site you were at, or if in the middle of nowhere, the already discovered location closest to the place of death.   You may or may nor be charged a small number of caps to respawn.  If you died inside a building, the respawn point is outside.  
---
Granted, when overencumbered, it can be a long slow walk back to the middle of nowhere...but if your junk bag is in the middle of nowhere, its unlikely to have been picked up by another player.
---
All gasses that aren't O2 displace O2, and there's no magic filters capable of just letting through oxygen and nitrogen while blocking everything else.
---
Also, you *really* need to start using punctuation, because holy shit that's painful to read.
---
I'd like to see a dungeon finder like WoW has. Queue up for your event and when a group is ready you server hop to that event and do it. 
---
It killed server identity on Wow, but that doesnt exist here so I think itd work well.
---
ok , I don't get it, so thought i'de ask.
---
I've picked up 5 of these gatling plasma's, and found them to be worse than shit.
---
last one kicked out 60 odd damage per shot, and a level 44 scorched took a full HALF plasma core to put down. Now I dont have any cards for energy or heavy's ok,but 1/2 a core for one scorched ????
---
how about you just ask her if she wants it,if yes, just give it to her.
---
if anyone can point out the error of my ways with energy weapons.....(add gatling laser)
---
Well played.
---
i can't say anything bout it, i don't know how it is when playing, as i dont play it on pc
---
Pick lone wanderer, serependity, nerd rage perks. And for armor pick emergency protocols. Now you are tanky like any other player.
---
ahh thanks for this .. I did not know this!
---
Yeah, but hopefully when they do balance it they do it right and not by nerfing a tiny corner of the build.
---
There is definitely a instant death on relog bug where pets just keel over and die on the spot as soon as you load in. It's probably the same bug that wipes out all ai in a area that you see all the time except now it happens to your own pet.
---
It‚Äôs the anti downvote!!   Count me in.  What you said is spot on. 
---
I don‚Äôt get the players that get killed or ganked and they lose it on the mic and start swearing and threatening and hurling epithets your way.  It‚Äôs a video games. Must be a road rage element to FO76

Got two spanking new drills yesterday from 3*** legendaries. Yes they still drop rampantly.

I always take inspiration from other series I like for weapon names.

I love the naming convention from Halo and really enjoy applying it to weapons in Fallout.

Great Schism Shotgun
---
Long Night of Solace - sniper &amp; so on.
---
This is like my 5th one but i always forget i have them and just scrap them haha
---
I looted 4 in random containers. Scrapped all of them, because they are heavy af.
---
Imo, PvP in adventure mode outside of an agreed fight or something is pathetic and attracts the worst kind of people. It doesn't help that the PvP is hilariously imbalanced. Most people who 'RP' as 'Raiders' anyway walk around in X01 armor with jet packs
---
We thought they will nerf only Explosive effect now we have right balanced two shot too. Bloodied is OP, say what you want, i am right. It is up to bethesda what they gonna do about it,  but we could give them some ideas.
---
I always find them by the whitesprings haha
---
Is this game worth buying now you can answer it 6444933 times.
---
Also yes. All the yes.
---
Really? Naming your gun is essential? How can you stay attached to a weapon that will be useless after a few hours of gaming since you'll have leveled up?
---
Plus, it tok me an aternity to find how to rename weapons in game. So obvious to put that option in the screen where you look at your weapon.
---
(Doesn't help that Bethesda done goof : in French, mowt weapons's name contain a "√†" like "fusil √† pompe".
---
When you rename your gun, "√†" is not an allowed character.)
---
Game ran "normally" after I finally landed . . . except for loot items disappearing from inventory.
---
I have a suppressor on my lever, sneak perk maxed and a chamelion piece on my armor set... they literally just walk right past you. They're fucking idiots üòÇ
---
And you're missing a trick mate. Dont vendor the weapons, equip scrapper and sell all that lovely plastic you get from the lasers on here! I make about 3k a day selling plastic alone.
---
O.o wait so you are telling me that the book tells us things from before it was released. Then that means that we can tell what should be coming out.
---
And then yours would be full
---
I'm assuming your at West Tek. Take some time to read all the terminal entries there's some nice back story about Super Mutants in there.
---
The quest to get it is crazy, man, and well -written, you should definitively give it a try!
---
I've got 2 pieces - how much it's worth and why it's sought after?
---
I swear I had a "Scorched Earth" popup last night that looked just like the Encryptid one. Maybe this is something that they're rolling out? If so I'd love for them to add free range, campfire tales, and project Paradise to the same list
---
I thank the mad hatter table for my witch hat
---
It would just need to be a simply checklist.
---
Having this checklist could also serve to inform them on which events are the most popular.
---
I agree with you, I just think you‚Äôre failing to make your point effectively. It seemed like you were making more of a demand than a suggestion.
---
Although stealing others' junk is a dick move, you could've avoided this problem by storing the junk in a stash. Very easily. Little effort, little caps. Junk barely matters anyways.
---
And, no. I haven't experienced anything like this because I store my junk, or I might have some small useless junk which I have too much of.
---
Id go with PS4 over PC for the bigger player base, less bugs and no hackers.
---
My serums are 225 caps and when someone buys in bulk I assume they are reselling to vendor's. But I make a lot of caps of serums but I also spend a lot of time picking flowers.
---
Yeah, that's much worse, God speed friend.
---
Tjere's two ways to handle the over abundance of missions.
---
1. Use the data tab and stop tracking all but one.
---
2. Look for areas with a lot of quest markers close and multi task. This gets them done quicker but the downside is if you like the story you may miss something.
---
On PC, there is an option. But even if I check that box in, sometimes, in total random times, it forgets it...
---
Huh...  i make bank, but that does sound easier...
---
I we talking about the first one (not the scout-related) it more bluish-grey. I think it's nice, totally worth to buy.
---
Worth noting that the outfit, for some reason, clips with underarmor.
---
They are annoyed with the lights, sounds that your generators make, and they want to eat your veggies.

---
As with roses questline, there's more than one level to the mysteries quest....so the question is have you finished all the levels, or just the first one?  
---
Keep collecting black titanium and screws for excavator - you can remake it for L45 when you get to that level.  I would also remake one of the mysteries rewards for L45 when you get there. 
---
Have you done Wavy Willards quest? 
---
I haven't done the pioneer scout thing, so I'll let someone else address that question.
---
That‚Äôs because how leveling works, when you start the game isn‚Äôt easy, easy mode comes latter at higher levels, normally &gt;=50.
---
The only ‚Äúfix‚Äù, one that I‚Äôm not sure I or the vast majority wants, it‚Äôs the complete removal of some perks (like bonuses to dmg, etc), removal of a ton of legendary effects (like explosive, bloodied, etc).
---
But seeing their popularity, I suspect no one wants that.
---
It is what it is, the gameplay loop is kill&gt;loot&gt;craft&gt;kill, the meta is one-shot for both PvE and PvP.
---
There's going to be a steam release? 
---
Let me guess, those of us who have already bought it wont get a steam copy
---
I have an exclusive combat shotgun in fallout 4 that i named master exploder
---
I thought they fixed this!&gt;?!??!?!?!?!?!!?
---
 i swear they addressed this that the pvp was supposed to stay in the workshop area?
---
Right... More just means more storage... And longer you can go without babysitting them...
---
But I've learned that inert Flux weighs less than half as much, covers my thirst just as well pretty much so now I just farm the hell out of nuke zones and might think of completely dismantling my Twin Lakes water farm and moving camp to another location.
---
It'd be nice to not be tied to a water source
---
It isn't your pricing as much as what you are selling.
---
Most junk is simply that... junk. Bulk it and vendor it to a robot.
---
Lead, Acid, Screws, Ballistic Fiber all sell well.
---
.45, 5.56, 5mm, .50 cal, and shotgun shells will all sell. Rest is trash.
---
The only time a magazine is going to sell if it is one that someone still needs for the achievement. There are a few more popular ones (reduced weapon costs, etc.), but no one is going to buy more tomahawk damage :-).
---
If it is easy for you to pick up/collect, it generally is easy for everyone else too. It wont sell well.
---
I sell serums every day for 499 caps each. Some are definitely more popular than others. If you see someone selling them for 250-300 caps, buy them up. Cha 20 with Hard Bargain 3 and you can sell those same serums to vendor for 500 caps each. If I remember correctly, Cha 18 will net you 460 so you can sell 3 a day to vendor. Make a mule, stick mule next to vendor, log mule in every day and make 1400 caps.
---
Cosmetic items (esp rare ones) tend to sell well. People gotta have that swag.
---
If it is a pain in the ass to get, it will generally sell.
---
Make sure your camp isn't tucked way out in the middle of nowhere. Location location location!
---
Plans are oversaturated at this point. That first week or so, it was easy to get 1k caps for a plan, but by now... 99% of them wont sell unless they are super cheap at 100 caps or so. I had over 700 plans stocked away for when player vending hit. Some I cannot even clear out at 10 caps.
---
Weapons and Armor: Is all about the effects. Some combos are way more popular than others. I generally price mine starting at 2k caps, and add another 1.5k caps for each star. Never had one sit more than a week. Am I leaving caps on the table? You betcha... but it only takes getting burned once or twice by going over the cap limit to figure out selling stuff for 10-15k caps is a quick way to get no caps.

LA/Hunting Rifles/Dragon - Instigating/Executioners/Bloodied
---
Assault/Handmade Rifles - Furious/AA/Bloodied
---
Heavy Guns - Bloodied/Furious/AA/2 Shot
---
( I dont deal with melee weapons too much, I would guess anything Bloodied or Furious would move quickly)
---
Any of the above combos are great sellers. Anything with a secondary effect of FFR or Explosive will sell especially well if combined with one of the above. Example: Furious LA rifle is meh. Anyone that uses them knows that aint the legendary you want. Now make it a Furious (FFR or Explosive) LA rifle, and it will start to have some merit, mostly for the 2ndary effect.
---
Unyielding armor of any star sells pretty quick. Fastest way to get that Cha to 20, grab a set of unyielding. Vanguard/Weightless both sell quickly. I don't mess with the PVP stuff much, but the tanky armor (reduced damage while standing still) I understand moves pretty quickly still.
---
Your 3 star auto-stim pack, +1 int, breathing underwater whatever isn't going to sell for anything beyond scrip fodder.
---
I hope this helps.
---
If that actually worked you would've seen people talking about it long ago.
---
Seriously well easier man. Plus you dont have to start hauling ass to a vendor because they come to you. Check my profile, I sold 2 lots of plastic yesterday and people buy it instantly. Seriously good money maker!
---
I had a group if Stupid tosspots Claiming a nuked white spring zone has "enclave property" and I was to leave because this was their nuke zone after telling them to get bent. I switched off my mike and turned on pacifist mode in order to not hit one by mistake.  and then I farmed the shit out of the area prob got 3 times the mats then the entire group of 6-or 7 of these momo's .  I doubt very much these group people like this read the subs but here's an idea why don't you and your bro's rep this shit on the pvp server??? Oh likely because your whole group would get your asses handed to you?? anyway if you run into a group of morons like this do the same thing stand your ground and farm away after you mute them it takes the wind out of their sails and to top it off they left after the zone was un nuked when some the best farming was to be had.... good times
---
Yep, i have a small farm of blackberries and tatos with 4 purifiers that nets me about 4-500 caps on days I don't want to do a long run thru something.
---
Man Fungus, we are doing great- how is your knee holding up out here? We had some good times back in the vault.. 
---
But look things are different out here in the wasteland... When we came out I wanted to join the responders and help out everyone we knew. But food was scarce, finding caps was worse, I was out of options. So I joined the raiders and now I want for nothing..? What could be better?!
---
There, is a way to input a command in the custom INI file that contains your username and password and it forces it to remember. Someone posted it on here awhile back.
---
Well, it is Bethesda we're talk about...
---
LOL yes yes buy the damn thing. then visit my shop . buy all my crap . I have tons of crap . buy it buy it all.
---
Lmao...  original post getting downvoted because..?
---
What? You can change the game language from Xbox settings? Holy shit fuck other languages, I‚Äôm putting mine in English.
---
I vouch for this method as well. I think only thing not mention is getting acid for the smelting, I don't know of a good way to get acid, but I built my camp on an acid extractor and empty it whenever I stop in. It will give you enough for all your ammo crafting needs :)
---
No theres a option to remember username. Not password.
---
um the hunters longcoat is extremely rare
---
you try server hopping for it!
---
its worth that much if not more

Link?
---
it's called "having potential."
---
It's not a time limited release so you'll have a while to save up.
---
Its a good weapon, but again, not "god tier"
---
Just trying to clear up the label here
---
Maximum output in whatever regard, (an explosive flamer could be a god tier HEALING weapon.) For damage it's a little more cut and dry.
---
Some guns have straight up more dps than others, for instance the handmade. A Bloodied explosive 2* handmade is NOT god tier, a Bloodied, explosive, DR while aiming IS a "god tier" because there is literally nothing that can be improved on, or rolled even slightly better. Faster reload is also a good one on certain weapons.
---
Possum challenges.

Nahh workshop pvp is actually kind of fun, I say this as I have been on both sides of the coin, at first I thought it was a dick move then I realized it's kinda true to the theme of the game, anyways the main reasons workshop pvp in my opinion is fun, a) you get to see the defenses other players make b) its exciting c) you dont lose your aid if you die d) if both parties are in area chat after words you can b/s a minute...example 1)dude and his friends was rocking me and some of my friends afterwards they help us with our build and we do some trading example 2) I was wrecking some guys at the ammo factory they where making .308 rounds so afterwards In area chat I drop them like 500 .308 rounds I'm never going to use, and show them how to get acid and lead in large amounts then we trade different types of ammo example 3) you get into funny situations like locking someone into a portapoty and surrounding with sirens
---
Woah lol. Weird.
---
Well I purposefully built my camp near a yao guai spawn to farm acid, so I beg to disagree.... but yea, they are a pain in the ass.
---
Same here. I think I'm gonna put up a note with the small letters. Probably won't lead to anything but it can't hurt to try.
---
Give it to her.
---
I agree with you about camp destroying. However, if you are on the leaderboard level doesn't matter.
---
So far the only issue I‚Äôve had is with scout under armor. BOS works fine
---
to make it a bit easier to understand:
---
1. mob spawns
---
2. legendary script is ran
---
3. monster turns into a starred legedary and gains stars + flairs
---
what happens is that you end up tagging it between stage 2 and 3, causing the game to register you tagging a REGULAR monster instead of a LEGENDARY ONE, giving you the drop pool of a standard mob, causing you to recieve no legendary item (Drills and syringers excluded)
---
I named mine ‚ÄòAmbien‚Äô
---
Yes, also very rare in my experience, I have had all of 2 people ever assault me verbally on the mic. One was unprovoked, and began PvP. The other time was when killing a fellow for the ammo plant.
---
At least we are not seeing the when will I be unbanned for picking up a bag with 100,000 ultracite rounds in it posts.
---
It's hilarious that those things don't work when they are literally a copy of the (well working) stealth boy with a different name and effect duration.
---
Then the notice that it can not connect to get game data.
---
Please. Every time i fast travel to my camp i spawn inside of a hill and have to fast travel there again to spawn in the correct place
---
I wish, been looking for the damn things for a week for the freakin badge. One, one is what I get. From some random back alley tub.
---
I feel the same way about serums, I see that a player has a butt ton of "Chems" so I get excited that they might have the serums I  am looking for. So I spend my caps only to find out they are selling 101 stimpacks or something else. Would be nice to see on the item list serums listed separately as well
---
I‚Äôve been hopping around for like a week trying to get the longcoat. At this point I would happily pay that price. It‚Äôs just wasting my time.
---
But not master blaster.
---
What kind of a rapping name is Steve?
---
also italian version
---
I thought they showed the stars n stripes bandana with the welding goggles. It was a neat little surprise for me :D
---
I named my TSE Lever Action "Billy" after Billy the Kid.
---
Pretty sure they did. That‚Äôs why I was unsure. I figured there would be some angry posts about it.
---
While I do agree that they very nearly played the role perfectly the messaging of OOC statements just ruined it for me. I've met some very good Raider role-players on multiple occasions on PC that manage to completely stay in-character. As you may or may not surmise from my flair encounters of that nature often don't end well for me...or do they?
---
this is the type of post Bethesda NEEDS to hear, we are all fans, but we all have limits, and its time for Bethesda to slow down on ATOM store stuff and fix the bugs.

You are better off figuring out if you want to be a high health or low health build and going from there.

Your Strength tree is spot on. Absolutely do not get rid of Martial Artist. That is a flat 30% damage increase. Find a gauntlet with Faster Swing Speed and you are swinging at 1.6 times per second.

currently need it on pc. im keen to help ign lunasea_

I feel you. I must admit this outfit made me buy some atoms XD

Need something that knocks you super high into the air. I wanna see it raining vault dwellers.

No, only got the first one and I'm not planning to buy stouts' one.

We can name weapons???

I find joy in killing something I know you worked so hard for &lt;3

I don‚Äôt actually. Can you elaborate on that a bit? You mean in the game or real life?

Upvote for Prince reference. Rip

Enclave underarmor clips through the arms and back, I honestly don't get how that slipped through. I'm pretty sure armor is marked as to what slots it takes up in the game files, so either BoS armor and some others are too thin to clip through (compared to the operative underarmor), or someone fucked up assigning it a proper equipment slot
---
This is A+ work!

Your density isn't the issue sir, it's your volume.

Being British I feel Smashy McSmashface would've been better.

The only way to increase the lever action rifle's capacity is "Quad" legendary effect. I would love one like that for my lawman build. /Jealousy
---
what ever gatling lazer I find, I will always name El Matador. I don't know why I do but I do.
---
Yeah... I 100% hope this becomes a thing. It makes it hard if you sell both from your vending, and the Fallout 76 Marketplace sub-reddit. I often miss what sold if I'm in the middle of tasks or AFK for a brief moment. Just like weight management at the beginning, this is now becoming a chore for me lol. I'm constantly going through my vendor inventory, to then update my Marketplace listing once things have sold.
---
Yeah, I'm very patient and compassionate but as the glitches get worse, and disrupts my experience, the more I'm becoming disillusioned. I work with developers for my company on business platform software so I know how challenging it is. But at my company, the build team would get fired if they continued to create more content over user experience. (Which I realize is most times a different team)
---
 I'm not a broad gamer. I legitimately only play Fallout. I've tried other open world games (even Skyrim) but just can't get on board with the other stories/themes. Please fix the user experience Bethesda! Sincerely...a devoted fan!

Seems we're sharing weapon names, hm?
---
I've got my wife's new 2-shot hunting rifle, modded into a .50 cal, named Full Caliber. Then, my current go-to is my faster firing, VATS boosting ultracite laser gatling, More Dakka, and my executioner Gatling Gun, The Firing Squad. Also have a cultist sword I gave my wife named The Greater Good...

üòÇ I have the same problem with my TSE pump. Its max level, hardened, everything. Takes over 10 shots for a bloated glowing one. :(
---
I think I can support this I play melee  and often let mobs come to me plus I have not spray like the shotgun to tag monsters early almost all the legs I kill drop a leg item (most are crap) but rarely if ever do I get a drill the odd one falls into the whitesprings cottage stair void but thats another issue.  I guess the take away is wait a bit before blowing the hell out of a room?
---
So the milk of human kindness does MORE damage to super mutants? It was all a ruse!
---
I haven't seen this specifically (but good on you for catching it!).  What I *have* noticed is that frequently whatever legendary drop the corpse should contain will show up after a delay.
---
It's like the trash on a mob is determined locally (which is potentially exploitable), but the legendary drop gets sent from the server, so it has to wait to populate that loot until the server responds.  And the servers are sometimes a *bit* slow :P
---
If you haven't already, hang back a minute or two and check the corpse after a time to see if eventually the item shows up.  I think the 'stars' part showing up late may be indicative of the same lag as the loot dropping.  If the mob status is delayed enough for you to see it, the loot status may be similarly delayed.
---
(Serve lag like that can be spikey, so you'd have to observe this over a number of examples to get a feel for what's going on)
---
You're right. I hope mama purveyor gives me more than nocturnal pipe pistols in the future ;)
---
Following because I have 3 right now...and would love to know if I'm wasting time and caps on 4 and 5
---
Yeah, that does suck. Sometimes the glitches in the game drive me insane but I keep coming back for more. It's especially irritating when you kill a high level monster, like a mother Deathclaw and they drop NOTHING! That's infuriating.
---
Wow, thanks!
---
I'll arrange the shop like this :)
---
I have a 3* Institating Dragon with 50% limb dmg and reduced vats cost, I try to sell it for 3000, but I'll lower then a bit.
---
And I'll drop my 4k-ish 10mm and other junk ammo here and there as a present.
---
And I'll bulk and sell the real junks.
---
Thank you again!
---
To be honest, players can set items at whatever outlandish price they wish. 
---
It's their store, just like in real life - if the products are overpriced, don't shop. To be honest, I usually just hit shops on the way to something (i.e. I want to go to Whitesprings, but there is a Player Vendor between the Fast Travel, I'll hit up on the vendor on the way and check it out.
---
If he/she doesn't have what I'm looking for, just move on - only wasted a loading screen (\~ 5 seconds on my rig).
---
Yeah but why do they destroy it instead if just eating it
---
They do. The benefit is small going from 4 to 5. I run 5 pieces plus action girl and get full ap regen in 2-3 seconds.
---
Yeah right?
---
If you think the prices suck then don't buy...
---
So there's more role-playing on Reddit than in the game. Well played, Bethesda, well played. I call it the Todd Howard's curse.
---
yes, i've also mentioned it in this post. but thx dude
---
There are "those" out there! I saw someone selling serums for 1500 each, really? While its less than the enclave vendor its still much higher than most other player vendors do and frankly none of us are going to purchase them....
---
üëç
---
Yeah... absolutely nothing else terrible and inhumane happened during WW2. Nothing just ask any German tour guide https://youtu.be/sacn_bCj8tQ nothing happened. Our Jewish friends all apparently had a blast during that time.

Humanity is prone to horrid acts of violence and oppression. From the Crusades, concentration camps, slavery Atomic Bombs, chemical warfare, the list keeps going.

They are radinfested, crazy animals. Maybe they hug like that. They want to hug your wall, but oops, it was too strong.

I just think there should be some thing that scares them away or a lure if you want to farm them
---
Just wait until you find the Breaking Bad one.
---
The grind for those badges is just crazy. Having to serverhop 20 times to kill a few rabbits (for example) is so pointless.
---
yes out of a 24 hour block I meet mostly friendly coop driven players who are nice to each other . these are fans of the fallout story and atmosphere and not driven to compete in pvp. I would guess the number of players I interact with to be 75 to 100. during a set 24 hours of play time I generally keep and control at least one workshop for fusion cores since the laser gat uses a lot of ammo. 
---
out of all the players on the map and all the players I interact with 1 or sometimes a party of 2 or 3 will attack my workshops and or gank me. somewhere around 1 to 3% of the players actually go out and gank people. 
---
the pvp mechanics are stupid. the victims are powerless unless they build completely around pvp and even then the dbag group will cheat exploit and dupe their way to having gear and damage advantages.
---
basically to pvp you have to not use a lot of the perks that make fallout... fallout. so most of us just dont. me I rock my power armor. I am obviously not a pvper, obviously not interested but players still gank me from time to time. 
---
  this is why pvpers are hated by much of the community. we want to coop and play fallout. not minmax pvp specs and stay in stealth mode at all times. and to win at pvp you can forget about any luxury perks or wearing power armor .
---
pvpers are LAME using lame mechanics against targets who cannot possibly defend themself.  PVPERs are only tolerated. just like we tolerate server disconnects and glitches in the game play. the rest of the game is fine without pvp aspect in it AT ALL. so yeah a pve only server would be perfect . if bethesda built a no pvp zone adventure mode would be as dead as survival mode. 
---
majority of normal people hate the pvp crowd. in almost any online game where its an option. this is why people got so pissed when they announced open world pvp. 
---
AND YES I know workshops were designed to be a pvp zone and it tells you that pvp is likely to happen. people want to build the shops and farm the resources. its got the whole "rebuilding america" vibe to it. me i expect to get ganked at a shop when i take it and dont really get salty i just server hop away and rebuild. statistically speaking I know it will probably be another 6 to 10 hours before i get ganked or attacked again. 
---
god yes sign me up for a pve only server. the further I can get away from moronic fools in their quest for epeen domination the better.
---
Give us hiss gamertag we know who he is.
---
It's hard to say because I don't know what kind of damage the other weapons are kicking out these days.  There was a time when Gatling Guns seemed more commonplace, but I tend to see a lot of people using Gatling Lasers and Gatling Plasma at the SBQ now.  For me, the base damage of the Gatling Plasma is something like 170, but it also fires a lot more quickly.  I don't know what the Bloodied version would be like.
---
When she's up in the air, she's clearly not taking nearly as much damage as she is on the ground, so I'm not sure there is some magic bullet.  I mean, yes, I've seen her lose large chunks of HP from time to time while flying, but I assume that's coming from a specific VATS critical build.
---
p.s. btw, i don't think they fixed them. it's just that these were not broken. it's not all, but maybe 90% being affected.
---
Public here or DM? XboxOne btw
---
To be honest, I would be fine with Nuclear Winter if there are "flowers" that come out of that fallout in another season. What I'm personally waiting for is a string of human based NPCs in PVE with more robust questlines other than "find the next holotape," like if all of the factions have a couple of people who somehow hunkered down in the madness coming out of the woodwork like daisies. It can't JUST be vault survivors. If there were people inhabiting WV sans vault.  
---
Fallout 76 has so much potential for robust questlines that can have this, but I'm not sure if its because of budget constraints due to low sales numbers/ if they are just taking repeatable actions/codebase to make PVP more robust, but the decision tree logic of human based NPCs would take a considerable effort to code in, let alone manage that for online multiplayer since we don't have speech options as players. My assumption here is that it is simply too much of a load for any server to handle with multiple players in it :\\
---
what makes it worse is that when stuff like this happens, they need way too long to fix. if they ever do.
---
Weird, I've crafted stims exactly 1 time in over 150 levels.  I farm a lot more than I fight, so my use it pretty low, but I remember vendoring extra stims before vending came out.  Even now, I've got 50 stims for sale (when I'm not cap...capped...), and I think I have 300 on my person (plus a completely uncounted number of super stims).
---
I get a decent supply from the trash cans and other containers in WS, and the occasional ones from med kits/mirrors when I'm out farming ghouls.
---
Dumb , downvoted
---
All 4 of my machines are already full from the stuff I have acquired since Beta.  I knew vendors were coming eventually so I pretty much held on to every single thing I could including over 300 recipes and plans.
---
 I am down to about 100 plans left which is great for my stash space.
---
 I would only buy the above posters items To either keep for myself or scrap the legendaries for script.
---
Your choice but DM is better. Xbox

Thanks for the additional info!
---
Certain items are timed, i.e. you grab all the weights in the gym - they won't spawn for a long period of time.
---
Basically I just do my rounds when I log on for the day: 
---
\- I hit up the VM Lumberyard with my melee weapon for some .308 rounds. 
---
\- Hit up Morgantown High School for the plastic (best spot, I get like 100 per run). 
---
\- I could go on, but you get the idea. 
---
Just do rounds when you first log on, you can keep yourself adequately stocked up.  I find it fun to make routes, the enemies tend to react in the same way every time so you'll get fast.
---
Are you making Shotgun Shells? The Scorched at the Highschool drop as much as 8 rounds. Again even if you're not a melee build, those enemies are weak - just slap em with whatever melee weapon you have. You can farm plastic and net about 30 shotgun shells.
---
to bad raiders cant ride their sausage wagon all the way to another game that does pvp better.
---
It's a bug dude. Bugs pop up all the time, for any number of reasons. This seems to be related to a directory search being messed up, and pulling names from the wrong section, but who knows where exactly the coding is bugging out. And we don't know if it's every version, or just some of that language. Chill out, bugs are not always easy to fix quickly, without screwing up something else.

When I get one I will call him Chad the Impaler

I play as a raider because thats how I enjoy Fallout 76. Now because you hate this aspect of the game I should find another game, you are fucking hilarous.

FYI - I've found that quitting completely out of the game processes (usually means killing off the launcher with task manager) and restarting will 'make' the launcher re-remember my credentials.  Only needed when something goes wrong, day to day I don't usually have that problem.

What you have is fine, but I would: 
---
* Drop tenderizer to 1. The added benefit doesn't justify the cost. 
---
* Add suppressor 1. 
---
* Add green thumb and/or glow sight for perception. 
---
* Drop White Knight; just equip it for repairs. You'll eventually be swimming in ballistic fiber, once you have White Knight and Fix it good. 
---
* Add Dodgy 3 to agility for survival
---
* Drop to Ghoulish 1, it's usually enough
---
* Add Rejuvenated 2
---
* Add Fireproof 3
---
* I think you'll want one carry perk. I would go with traveling pharmacy 2, and drop iron fist down to 1, except when you're battling huge things like the SBQ. In all other cases you'll have more damage than you need. 
---
* I'm not a fan of huge adrenaline investments as melee. You get a lot of benefit from 1 card, and unlike ranged, you're not going to tag tons of minions in the huge fights, but I'd be glad for you to prove me wrong.

I just started lvling an alt character last week because I found a good lvl 10 instigating explosive rifle for sale at a player vendor. People are starting to keep these items for lvling new chars look for something like that and when you find one keep it for future lvl of new char I have a 25 lvl instigating fire axe thats on 3 character
---
I agree it can be annoying but in the end it's just 5/10 seconds to type in a password and login and then you can take your anger out on a Super Mutant ;)
---
you playing as a raider wouldnt bother me if it were possible to actually be able to fight back in power armor and not using stealth mechanics. I have done a lot of pvp in a lot of games but the pvp in 76 is broken. I don't hate the idea of pvp I hate the implementation of it, and I hate the fact that the gank crowd has every advantage going for them VS anyone who isnt stealth or using extremely OP gear. I wouldn't even hate the pvp crowd except for the fact that they know they're running some broken one sided shit and do it anyway.I have 0 faith that bethesda can bring balance to this mess and still keep stealth viable. for me the best thing bethesda could do would just be to remove it entirely or let me go to a place with 0 pvp at all.
---
We left a vault for a radiated wasteland, yeah its been a rough fucking morning.
---
I love renaming stuff. Just adds to the game and if you're RP'ing, adds to your character, as well.
---
Is that a serious question? There is always a lot of clown outfits at Halloween
---
I completed it the other day mostly solo. A mid level player showed up halfway through protecting the friendlies but didn‚Äôt do any noticeable damage against the alpha grafton monster. I froze it repeatedly with a bloodied cryolator then attacked with my bloodied mole miner gauntlet. It went down pretty quickly and didn‚Äôt kill me once.
---
Hit me up with it if your willing, can't stand duppers
---
I do that too : drink my Inert and sell/craft with farmed Purified
---
Always pass it on.
---
I have to catch up with some really high level players later today and I'll get back to you.
---
They messed up with the internal string id in foreign files, a lot of item get the wrong strings.
---
Worse thing is that there are some tool on pc modding that let you fix the issue quite easily...
---
I have a shotgun named Buumstik.  It‚Äôs nice
---
ps4 masterrace.  we don't need passwords.  join us.
---
Prime receivers are really not worth it.
---
With a hangover too. You're right. Nevermind the last 25 years of training for entering into a nuclear apocalypse! I needs me some cannibalism!
---
Man I just lol'd so hard seeing that
---
Was it a cowardly legendary? I haven't seen one of those in awhile but they used to be everywhere.
---
I read another post here yesterday where a player said he was experiencing the same thing. Turned out his DOF setting had changed to max somehow. He said after he changed it to half instead of max, the issues went away. Maybe give that a shot?
---
My mutations make it near impossible to kill myself by jumping off somewhere. The only places I can usually kill myself are the Monorail Elevator and new River Gorge Bridge. I can usually survive pretty much every fall. It was funny when we were trying to kill ourselves to help each other. We had a lot of trouble doing it. Haha

It was around paragraph 9 that you became a toxic player yourself, my dude.
---
you can't get mods from guns you create but i could be wrong. I tried but didn't get any mods
---
Nice one. I didn't know that. Strange choice of colour.  But why not. :-)
---
...yea, I got a drill from the SBQ and a few other legendaries within the last week. :/
---
&gt; Add some way to send wires through walls. Please.
---
I use the industrial tubing looking wires, they have one that can pass through a wall, then I hook up one of the power transmitters to wirelessly power things in my house.
---
NICE!  Congrats!
---
I mean, you say you're using a Bloodied Power Fist + swing speed.  You're choosing to use one of the best weapons in the game, and then you complain that the game is too easy.
---
Challenge yourself!  Use a boxing glove instead. üòã
---
A god-tier is basically most weapons with either anti-armor or two shot + explosive. Anything bloodied seems to be top tier as well. I myself would say anti-armor plus faster fire rate is high also depending on the weapon.
---
Blade of bastet is dogshit though? You have to run that entire set to be worth it and then you're essentially a pile of fluff. 
---
Better off running bloodied or anti-armor swing speed DCG or meat, your damage output will be way higher trust
---
I named my 40% faster bloodied, +1 str deathclaw gauntlet ‚ÄòRoy‚Äô
---
For no reason other then I think it‚Äôs funny
---
Fr? I swear I‚Äôve met him before but he won the fight
---
now the real trick getting the possum badges for the carry weight increase, wow I love that bug best 1000 caps I ever spent... :)
---
That was exactly the point. Giving them a taste of their own medicine.

Real life.  So them looking deep blue is not unrealistic.

There's also a Bojack Horseman one

Ahhh the knee well you know...I used to be an adventurer but ya know - rad storms are a real pain. And indeed we did.

I see - that's for sure a tough and understandable situation, but i'm glad you two are doing great now!

anyway at this point I went down the hill to get water, friend drug crowd into general area and built a three story tall wooden structure to flag our location. pretty sure he was being mischievous and just trying to have some fun with me but I am removing him from my friend list now. if your reading this steam we had some good convos but I am done with the interruptions to my game time sir. have a good 76 life sir.
---
At first you had my curiosity, but now you have my erection
---
Pretty nice I did about as well yesterday, TSE Gatling gun (only lvl 40 tho) and Instigating +1 Str and reflect 50% blocked melee Grognak Axe.
---
You can‚Äôt just log off and on again and magic happens. You have to know how the game spawns things.
---
Items laying out on the ground won‚Äôt spawn again for you after you pick them up, until a day has passed. The same goes for plants and other resources. And if you take any item from a container, the container will be empty when you server hop. Which means you can‚Äôt repeatedly loot one location over and over and get a ton of resources. You just get the one time.
---
However, there are still a lot of ways that server hop benefits you. Enemies respawn, and many enemies drop resources. So, for example, if you know a guaranteed wendigo spawn, you can server hop it and get a ton of screws and acid. Super mutants drop a lot of laser weapons, which scrap into plastic. Etc etc.
---
You can also server hop to reset item/container spawns. An empty Nuka Cola bottle sitting on a shelf might be a Nuka Cherry after you server hop, assuming you didn‚Äôt touch the empty bottle. Same goes for plans/recipes just laying out. And you can reset containers until they have rare plans or whatever, as long as you don‚Äôt take anything. 
---
And finally, you can server hop for events. A lot of events are triggered by player proximity, but they also have downtime before they will trigger again. Server hopping skips the downtime.
---
That‚Äôs the exact opposite of his definition of fun...
---
i remember you two "discussing" this yesterday lol
---
DM
---
Just seen a new dupe method posted on You Tube today using vendor bots.  Please fix ASAP!
---
It's a fair game. Standing up for yourself against a bully is so much gratifying even it's just a game. Well played.
---
I should add:    It all relates to what treatment is used to make the gun rust-resistant.   Blueing is an older, less effective technology.    But one that can be quite beautiful when done correctly‚Äîwhich takes a lot of labor.  So fancy guns may be a deep blue, but worker guns these days are typically not.
---
Supper dupper and it ammosmith (not sure if they stack or not) also the extra search perk card (not sure if it's name but it's under luck) and hitting up pretty much any settlement.
---
Had to remember to rename my variables to not have expletives before submitting an assignment.
---
One TA was cool with it, haha.
---
Yes! I'm having to keep track of sales and prices on my phone. And it's hard when you're in the middle of an SBQ battle and that sound goes off to try to make a note of what sold and how much. And the notification needs to stay up longer. God knows the legendary pop up stays up way too long, but the sale notification is blink and you miss it.
---
but what if hackers steal your boiled water
---
Hes probably a kid...
---
Had this happen too, but there was a sign that said 'Max Caps: Store closed'
---
I love when I find 3* trash legendary weapons from 100-300 caps I always buy them for the cheap scrip.
---
After I completed it, I had enough broken cameras from scavenging that I can build like 10 of them.  I was going to try and put one in my vendor terminal, but sadly you cant.  I was gonna sell it for like 10c.
---
i buy from players, caps are easy and working is hard
---
Right from the mouth of the beast, if you have any complaints, just right them down on a piece of paper, neatly fold it up, then gently pull apart your ass cheeks and shove it up your ass.
---
 Great thank you so much
---
I got an assassins sentinel with ap refresh wood chest...
---
It downgraded to a 1 star. A bit infuriating. Hope they fix this
---
Alright who put the 20 mm in the shotgun again
---
Ahhh no surprise there Vic!
---
You were always into those fresh steaks Donnington served in the cafeteria for Dinner -  Rare prefered right?
---
I encountered 3 unkillable yao bears this past weekend. Jump on a roof and then ran as all hell away from them
---
GTFO where?!?!
---
Obviously. If I can't taste your blood type than what's the point?
---
Yeah, Revenant sounds good on paper, but in practice, the way the game decides whether or not you'll actually go into a "Help me" state versus instantly dying is so random - on top of whether or not another player can make it there in time - that it's just not worth it.
---
They might do that if their current plan to fix event player count, &gt;!previous datamining showed they were going to try and implement a type of server selection with one option was event related and details were posted on reddit and Juicehead made a video with some of the details.!&lt;
---
You get a 50% damage increase, minus whatever special stats/etc. that you lose from the withdrawal.  If you're choosy about what chems you use, it can be a fairly minor effect.
---
PITA to do, but it's a decent increase without the 80%+ health reduction from bloodied.  Sure, it's less DPS, but it's also a bit easier to live with (literally).
---
Good luck with that. I don't want to depend on 23 random strangers for me to do content.
---
To an extent i agree, for most part it's novelty, although when referring to "God" items, it kinda is a requirement as it reliably adds the most damage of any single legendary effect. But is in my opinion over rated as far as general functionality goes.
---
Ok.. Snoopy's house... is that the dog house with the periodic table on the wall?
---
And here I am thinking they were waterskins. The current way of previewing atom shop items does not often do them justice IMHO.
---
this is the most BS thing i've heard today. i've played on my pc for 3 years now and have only had a problem like this once, while having played 200+ different games total. the only major problem i've had with FO76 is that it doesn't like my monitor resolution, but if you're going to be playing on good hardware you're likely going to be using a 1080p or 1440p monitor anyway.
---
Purveyor has Legendary Scout Armor.
---
i think european versions are affacted by this glitch, even locations on the map have the name changed  
---
probably the localisation team is at fault
---
The times I have logged on to survival mode there were never more than 8 people on the servers.
---
Fuckin lul
---
Oh.
---
Is that why I can't view the SBQ's limbs when I VATS her in melee?  I don't even mean to attack them - I just wanted to see if they were crippled or not when she's flying. üòã
---
Sounds good +1
---
I just got my backpack today and it was already at level 50. I was ready to scrap it and make a new one after reading about it but was pleasantly surprised when I saw it was already level 50.
---
I don't know what game you're playing, I can sit in survival for hours and not get anyone with "overpowered" gear coming to kill me. Everyone seems to go about their business and not interfere with anyone
---
Is it still called an Easter Egg when its obviously slammed in your face like this? Is also still an Easter Egg when this has been posted 50 times already?
---
^this person has made comments quite literally identical to this over 100 times across many subreddits.
---
Absolutely!  I will spend up to 75-100 caps per 1 star. 200-250 per 2 star and 4-500 per 3*.
---
 It beats the h*** out of running all over the map tracking down 3 star opponents.
---
I usually hang around Max caps so it's really not that big a deal to me.
---
Make it. With super duper and ammosmith just 1 run through the firehouse and hotel I have plenty of lead and I can make around 1k ammo.
---
What does this entail.
---
Should be 98% reduced weight so that its a true 2% Milk of Human Kindness.
---
Well can't speak of everything because the last stuff added like backpacks for example are not in it, but all the fasnacht masks were in the Apparel already included.
---
While it has obvious utility in PvP, is Fireproof really that necessary in PvE?  It's really the Scorchbeasts that are notorious for it, and ever since their nerf, it seems like between Serendipity and Dodgy, and Padded or Dense on your chest armor, you've got most of that covered without Fireproof.  At least, that's how it is for me.
---
It‚Äôs just a military rp, I just advertised it like thatüôÑ
---
I am more the fan of a skill system like fallout 4, level 50 is to easy to archiev, I eant to improve my character further and when he gets a skill it should be for ever
---
I refer to it as legendary mule armor since everything I get has some weight reduction perk
---
Ok. I thought peculiar that they were ALL 3 star. But I guess everybody is rolling for 3.
---
Definitely there - thanks!
---
I'm literally in the same spot. Running Sentinel Assassins Powered with Chest, and Legs Powered. Need to switch out Arms, but considering doing Unyielding Sentinels Powered to get AP refresh, but stackable perks for lower health.
---
Would you know how small the incrementals are?
---
Yes, bugs happen. But if the software I wrote was half as buggy as Bethesda's releases, I'd be out of a job. The amount of bugs in their products is unacceptably high, and the severity is sometimes so bad I question if they even test this stuff internally. 
---
Bugs happen, but the quantity and quality of bugs coming out of Bethesda is shameful. They've (supposedly) been developing games for a few decades now, yet indie and small studio games are better polished than their releases. It's shameful.
---
Right?!
---
 Can we talk about how some of these vault dwellers taste? Disgusting!!
---
And this is why everyone gangs up on raiders in every game
---
Wtf.... Gz Buddy but i dont think you are playing anymore :DD
---
*Laughs in multiple graphics card*
---
Doesnt the Bethesda launcher do that anyway? I never have to type that information in
---
Nerf is always wrong.... Buff other weapons instead... why should my gamestyle be penalized by other gamestyles? Just buff the other weapons...
---
I noticed this as well.
---
Ya they've been nerfed (Thank the nine) because that shit was way too OP. It was basically own a TSE shotty or go get fucked basically. Glad Bethesda ended that nonsense.
---
Yeah true WS is a gold mine.
---
But i don't let the chance pass when a tick crosses my path with butchers bounty perk to craft blood packs and stims after.
---
Pretty sure it's the recycled water system. 
---
Just use a little extra salt.
---
Ahh rp. Thought it was like clan bashing. Going around busting greefers asses. Darn
---
Good bot.
---
Good luck my man!
---
Meele. Ranged is hard low level due to weapons doing little damage when not having perks or mutations or lack of ammo. Meele will always do more damage early on.
---
He kinda owns me 10k caps
---
Thanks!
---
This is a known issue with wood armor and assaultron heads obtained through the purveyor.  If you roll one of these, recycle it immediately.
---
Thanks to your informative post there won‚Äôt be many type 1 leftüëå
---
would sound cool, but i'm on ps4 :/ but still, that just shows even more that bethesda should get their \*\*\*\* together, as this was what was already going on ps4 with fallout 4. bugs ignored by bethesda, where pc modders did THEIR job, but us on consoles still being screwed :( i truly hope beth does fix, as it shouldnt be on others to do their job. especially as not possible when playing on ps4.
---
but thx for the insight dude.
---
We are downvoting you because the user you are saying "doesn't know what they are talking about" SPECIFICALLY was only talking about secondary effects, while you continue to mention primary effects. 
---
You are comparing Apple's and oranges AND you are being an asshole about it. You are being downvoted because you are so very very wrong.
---
idk, i just hope for a fix asap :/
---
Its a shame to loose some many adventurers to those pesky knee injuries
---
Personally, I don't see the point in farming the sqoosh...  really I truly hate Encryptid as an event and will never pop one.  I'm half tired of Scorched Earth as well...  the rewards just aren't worth it.  Project Paradise is a much better event to me.
---
Lincoln was warned if he sent supplies they would take the fort by force....... it‚Äôs not always the person who fired the first shot that started the war....
---
I‚Äôm not on the south‚Äôs side they were my ancestors and horrible to Africans...... doesn‚Äôt mean they were not forced into war by the north.
---
Yeah it would. I 100% get that the game needs to make money, but I'd rather pay for DLC or pay a subscription fee than pay to win. If it's a choice between the game crashing and burning or going pay to win, I'd choose crash and burn, and hopefully BGS learns from that mistake.
---
Shit. I forgot about this last night when I got a bloodied one as well. 
---
Well poo
---
I play it about 50% of my time. Its not full duped weapons either. But it does have vats so i can 2 shot players in there 70s when im 20ish. Did this yesterday. Killed 3 ppl in a row 2 of them with nothing but marksman rifle. No legendary. 2 shots had them incapacitated.
---
Vats give the impression op weirdness 
---
I enjoy looting a building and hearing a PA guy enter the area. Or see a pip boy light. Adds tensoins as the base game is impossible ez.
---
I like it but its not you relax and put on some mindless fallout after a day of work. With so many ppl in the game only for solo game play its not going to be nearly as popular as adventure mode.
---
Half level stairs would be glorious, especially if you could snap them to one side of a foundation instead of the middle.
---
Then, Mr.  Garvey will come to you..
---
Scrapping them is the goal of the challenge.
---
I tried the same on my previous character.
---
I've started doing this lately.
---
Last night, a player that he was quitting the game and giving away all of his God Roll gear.  "Find me on the server.  No messages.  First come first serve."  
---
I joined his server and found him on the map.  Went there and there was a line of players waiting to get into his camp.
---
When he started letting people in, it was a death trap room with flamethrowers.  Everyone was crowding each other, being in each other's way as they tried to run from the Hellfire.  Fun times.
---
Well Im sorry my power fist has no ammo :( neither does my combat knife... if you are tired of scavaging ammo goo meleee thats what I did after my .45 bullets ended...
---
It's lag.
---
The order things load when you go to a new area (not just fast travel, but any time you travel into a new 'block' of the world) is a bit...interesting. There are static items and encounters, but some of them can be used/killed/taken before you get there.
---
The server first tells your game 'hey, there's always a spawn here', then later on in the load order the game determines if anyone has already taken/killed it.
---
So from your point of view, things load in, and then later things change the state that they're in - items show up, then disappear, or they spawn in and die.  You may see them, but until the server verifies that they *actually* are still there, you can't interact with them.
---
Not much you can do about it except get a super fast (and low latency) internet connection and also get on a server that isn't overloaded. Good luck with that :P
---
I would  Say the majority of players are not on reddit.
---
Not my level 25 backpack.  Can‚Äôt craft a +60 for a while.
---
I didn't find it obvious - Was just saying I've noted that for myself to register - Thanks for the tip
---
That and the assaultron head are bugged. It'll default back to 1 star when you log off or put in stash
---
If that‚Äôs the case then I retract what I said, sounds smart to me then.
---
This was a retelling of actual events!
---
Junk legendaries for the ingame price sure, but there is no way you're selling decent 3* legendaries for 200 caps
---
I wish everyone actually ganged up on us raiders in 76 and not just the Reddit. It would make it a little more interesting
---
FWIW - That what it seems too be for me and thats how I get around it. Annoying but yeah seems to actually prevent the re-engagement
---
Sounds better than the deathclaw that hates my corn everytime I log in. Though does give me lots of gears each time.
---
Radroaches are just eating your corn. Yao guai are just scratching their backs on your wooden wall... very aggressively
---
I would like this if it also made the swarms of bees not attack u
---
Level 15 Raider, 25-45 Excavator, 50 X-01.  Gatling gun is your best bet at lower levels.  If you really want Enclave themed, the 50 Cal is probably the end game weapon of choice, the energy gatlings and minigun are more Brotherhood than Enclave.
---
that could've been called 'capital punishment' in fallout 3...
---
This is a tricky one. When the game came out, I played lots, even with bugs.  But as I started to run out of content, the bugs bothered me more, to the point that I stopped playing for a while. While I was doing other things, Bethesda made a lot of progress fixing up the game.  I started to play again, and the new content started up.  The more content, the more bugs came back.  But new content was king, complain about bugs later.  It is now "later".  They need to fix the bugs now between the expansions.  But they cant take too long....
---
Ah we can Danse if we want to, we can leave your friends behind
---
Cause your friends don't Danse and if they don't Danse
---
Well they're are no friends of mine
---
Are you sure it is a base spawn? It sounds like you are near a fissure.
---
&gt;level 3  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;ohjeezidk2 points ¬∑ 
---
Glad to be of some assistance
---
I never used strong I left him at the tower lol
---
So you want one card that takes 9 points, instead of 3 3* cards?
---
I like the secondary perk build activated at your camp idea.
---
When will Bethesda give up on this engine that is just so prone to bugs...  The whole Fallout series (and to a lesser extent, Elder Scrolls) has been plagued by it.  It's sad.
---
Really? Thats strange, I know I'm way over the level cap when I got it at 170 so weird yours was already max level and mine wasnt.
---
Well if nothing else it means you didn't have to make a new one :)
---
No it‚Äôs not. You‚Äôre being stubborn. Part of the fun of camp locations is over time discovering what‚Äôs around your camp. Sounds like you‚Äôve found that out about 5 times now but refused to move. Move! There‚Äôs tons of similar locations not near a scorchbeast spawn
---
A broke low lvl would love it
---
Umm... I'm on PC and only have to login to the Bethesda launcher every once in a great while. If I use the FO76.exe then I have to login every time.
---
Survival is essentially dead as it is
---
Maybe this is a PvP thing, but why do you consider Adamantium Skeleton a must have?
---
I've heard the explanation that max rank Adamantium Skeleton prevents staggers, which is obviously useful for Sentinel, but I haven't seen that happen in practice for me and I'm not sure if maybe I just have the wrong idea of what a "stagger" is.
---
Have you tried activating it from the Favourites Wheel?
---
Deathclaws don‚Äôt drop their own hides, though. So far the only known sources are a couple types of containers, and a couple types of monster loot (gulpers, and now apparently behemoths)
---
Word, We can't even get strangers to help keep a couple brahmin alive, or collect some kindling.
---
Do you need material?
---
I play survival only. It's thriving. We have gangs and drama and shit heads.  I am no PvP God and I have only a one star AA Handmade. But I can hold my own. 
---
Your gonna get one shotted by sparkle guns sometimes but the added tension of survival really makes it fun.
---
I have friends and enemies on these servers. I like to see them on the leaderboards. I like the ticker that tells me who is killing who.
---
I have killed the top players in the game using smarts and laying traps. Most of them are so cocky they will walk right into a trap. Thinking they will just one shot you. 
---
I can't play offensive PvP well yet but I'm practicing. 
---
And once you accept death as inevitable things chill out.
---
I second this, where?
---
Totally agree. I often scour the map to find the player to check their level beforehand. Very time consuming.
---
Try the suggestion Silkyjohnson said, go to the dome and just server hop till you find it open. If the plans aren't there, just wait a while and they will eventually respawn.
---
Examine the weapon/armor in your inventory. On the bottom is the option to rename. V on PC I believe
---
Thanks for theme part.
---
I do the same thing!  And I can never find that player so I often just give up
---
well, I was not trying to say that you should do that yourself (it would be necessary for you to have a backup of you 9.0 files, which is not common anyway).
---
I am just saying that the process is not taking more that 5mn, and we are waiting a fix from bethesda since 10 days now...
---
I think you might have better luck adding low level, fully modded weapons and armor in your shop if you're not selling legendary stuff.  End game players won't be interested in level 50 gear without legendary effects but if you set up shop near Vault 76 and offer affordable modded level 5, 10, 15, etc. weapons and armor better than what they can pick up...  You might do well with that.
---
What system. If you‚Äôre on PS4 I have an extra I could sell
---
Hope they take the time between now and the next update in a few weeks to try and actually fix things.
---
Not having any weapon perks is why. Perks make a massive difference.
---
That being said, the energy heavy weapons are still bad compared to the ballistics. The laser gat is especially bad.
---
Sorry I haven't seen it here before.
---
Believe me I checked before hand
---
what level shotgunner do you have? And shotguns can have very short effective ranges. if you‚Äôre further than that you‚Äôre only doing a fraction of the damage
---
Phoenix has it usually. Just keep checking in Watoga
---
You suck.
---
tl;dr You suck.
---
I managed it last night, mostly solo. I got all of the materials for one of the troughs myself, managed to get it up to rank 2 (man getting to rank 3 is damn near impossible), which gave me a mirelurk hunter. A guy showed up after the first wave of enemies, but I was decimating the enemy predators before he could even touch them for the most part. The Alpha predator went down so fast it was a bit hilarious, considering it's level 100 and SBQ is 95 and takes far more punishment. It's not technically "solo" but it's not like I can control who shows up you know?
---
The video is rendering and I'll be uploading today. I have commentary on it as well, because hey, I'm a youtuber with 15k subs, so why not have a little fun with it, I'm sure my viewers will enjoy it too. YT channel is here:  [https://www.youtube.com/c/thewandererplays](https://www.youtube.com/c/thewandererplays)  , will be uploading there. I'll link you to the video directly when it's up.

I saved a bunch of fluxes over the six months in game, never paid attention to how much work I put into creating them. Yesterday I saw my violet flux is down to  only a few dozens left so I decided to make some more. Started the process 11PM by collecting ingredients etc, by the time I finished creating 40 of those it was 3:40 in the morning lol üò≠
---
At the carnival place in one of the porta potties, it's a giddy up buttercup with cotton candy
---
I‚Äôve gotten 4 or 5. All from the purveyor
---
I have the same and it usually one-shots lvl 40 moleminers. 
---
What is the damage of your gun?
---
If it matters I was in The Mire and finished the daily with the bug parts as the last thing for the quest. I assume that had something to do with it.
---
I wish we could have faction wars
---
what about people running camps with low lvl mule accts?
---
PC: Mods
---
The only correct answer.
---
I AM ON PS4!! FRIEND ME IDK HOW MUCH CAPS I HAVE THOUGH
---
MY PSN: PRESTON_burritio
---
^ type exactly like here
---
For Bee Costume I was thinking more of:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80YS9wbHI10
---
My AA limb damage combat shotgun is called "Dance Instructor"
---
I have I‚Äôve been going everywhere for the past week! Server hopping all day! Nothin!
---
I'm itching to have a run at the arktos pharma event but that's too unreliable to start at the moment out of 5 attempts I got crashed to home screen 4 times, the one time I managed to stay the length of the event it was only me there, which didn't end well, I love the game and love the content but agree they should take this next month or so before nuclear winter to fix the stability and rendering.... or lack of. I think the worst bug for me is the invisible enemies when I load into an area running a bloodied build I'm easy pickings for anything i cant see or attack!
---
Claim,defend,and retake as many workshops as possible it will supply you with constant easy events. Dont build anything and if someone takes one let it go. Join any events period if there are other people doing it. Allow other people to aid you. Use peoples camps if possible to find other locations. Figure out what locations will spawn lvl'd enemies
---
It's to prevent staggers and broken bones. I use it mainly for PvP to keep from getting staggered. I don't use sentinel but getting stuck in the animation is certain death. And it is useful in PvE before Adamantium Skeleton I lived with a concussion and a broken leg. Now I'm healthy and never get crippled even by the strongest  super mutants!!
---
I‚Äôve waited for the stars to appear and have still gotten no legendaries or ended up with a drill or syringer
---
How much do you sell it for? I have a huge surplus now that I'm not a shotgunner anymore.
---
I‚Äôm at work for the next 7hrs but will be on later. You can add me and we‚Äôll negotiate something when I‚Äôm on later. I won‚Äôt take all your caps so I‚Äôm willing to go lower for sure! My psn is same as my username on here
---
HA HAH AHAHA sky rim reference HAHAHAA this is what fallout is now HAHAA
---
It‚Äôs part of the game, I agree. But that just means the problem is the game, not the players. 
---
I‚Äôm all for consequence, but fallout 76 pvp is nothing but poor design. As you say, the smart way to hold a workshop is to hide and constantly store all your junk, so that it‚Äôs not worth trying to kill you. That‚Äôs not good pvp. And the people who don‚Äôt realize or understand how it works get preyed upon, by people who don‚Äôt even care about the workshop... also not good pvp. 
---
It would be really cool if taking a workshop meant you actually had to defend it, against PvE enemies and players alike. It would be cool if the workshop actually mattered. But that‚Äôs not really how it works. Right now it‚Äôs mostly just people exploiting bad mechanics to kill people who don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing, just to steal their basically worthless piles of junk/caps. Zzz
---
You already have Encryptid event... you could have the whole server there and you will fail anyway
---
I go into survival to pick up that tasty aid and I go into adventure to farm workshops. I'd say I am so-so at pvp. I don't like spawn camping so survival isn't for me. Here's how I treat workshops... I take workshops and I often times try to let them know I don't want to fight them but I will if I have to. I offer them a team invite when I am solo. Most times they fight back, or decline the invite and it turns into some thrilling pvp. Truly gives that feel of fighting for resources. Lots of sneaking, sniping and jumping, but I have yet to come across super angry players cursing at me for it. Only when they think I took their junk, but like my original message I don't want your junk I want the workshop. 
---
Kids will be kids in videogames and often times that translates to bad insults and hilarious threats. Playing as a raider/responder/BoS/etc enriches the game for those of us that are old enough to appreciate what that means. For kids it feeds their need to be in control and be bigger than they are. 
---
I have yet to play as a raider but this post makes me want to try. üòä
---
I'm just reinforcing that serendipity, which I hope you're definitely running with your unyielding build, is a helpful aid for fall damage.
---
Thanks! Hope we become good fallout friends!
---
That would be awesome
---
Yeah, plus whenever I need the rarer flux types, it usually means launching a nuke myself to get it to areas where I know I will obtain it. Whitespring and Fissure Site Prime are not always the best for flux. üòî
---
I haven't come across one yet, I'm on PS4 and I'm not 100% certain of the frequency of mule accounts on PS.  Last night I ran into a low level CAMP and they were selling snallygaster spit for 12,500 caps among other insanely overpriced trash hence me being leery about the low level CAMPS
---
If only u had a double shot on it also. Now THATD be god tier
---
I agree but heres the thing. I use one of my mules as a trader. He is lvl 16 and he has legendaries of all levels. But i also keep his camp south of site alpha. I feel that camps close to V76 are normally low level. Not all are but most. 
---
Now im with you, i hate going to a camp and seeing a machine full of non legendary items. But there has to be a better vetting process because i see alot of players with low lvl traders. 
---
Also on a side note, i but low level legendary weapons from low level players. That dont know how to price items in their machine and make a fat profit on them. Sometimes it pays off to visit them
---
Brother !!! More Lamp!!!
---
Hi little stalker, is there are part you disagree with or are you just desperately trying pick a fight over video games again?
---
Yeah mine goes through bouts. I don't tend to tick any box for "remember my password" but it went through a stage of automatically remembering it, now it doesn't. 
---
Atleast be consistant!
---
I have a password manager (dashlane, awesome bit of kit) so with 2FA on that, I boot my PC, enter my master password, confirm my 2FA code, find my randomly generated password for the Bethesda launcher, stick that in and can finally play!
---
You can often find it at Raider vendors.  Maybe sure to check Sutton Station and the one inside Whitesprings too.  It's called "Signs and Letters."
---
Yes I know what it is called, unfortunately, I haven‚Äôt been able to find it there I‚Äôve been everywhere on the map!
---
Ok, will then rather just drop my clothing line. My camp is not close to Vault 76.
---
My whole life is a lie
---
Indie and small studio games never have anywhere NEAR the scope of a Bethesda game, dude. Think about how huge the worlds in their games are, and how much flexibility and how many variables are constantly being used. Yea, if you have a basic shooter with "go here, go there" stories or a side scrolling platformer, then no shit it's going to be easy to program and find bugs. Yet even those games have rare, massive bugs. Fuck, Stardew Valley, one very simple game, had a bug that was exploited by using *wallpapers* to stand in for one of the rarest items in the game, due to a directory bug.
---
Please, go ahead and program a game as massive as a fully open-world RPG-shooter, with all the quests and interactions as in a Bethesda game. You'll find there are a lot of bugs you find and fix, but you will never have the time to find every single one, and upon patch you'll end up with 10 new ones that will only be discoverex when you have a couple hundred thousand people playing and encountering different choices.
---
It is nowhere near as easy as you seem to think to find and fix bugs, is my point. Especially when you have an open world game that is complicated to code for, with so many variables at one time. A directory error like this may seem easy to fix, but it's finding the root cause that can take a long time to track down and fix properly, and to do so without accidentally causing a cascade of new bugs is even more time consuming. They have a team working on bug fixes, I'm sure, but they have only so many hours to put into this one game, and this one bug.
---
There is a lot of mules on Ps4
---
No I simply lack level requirements.  My character is level 26, so can only craft a level 25 backpack.  A +60 carry weight version isn't available to my character until later.
---
They introduced aktos a week ago and the sheepsquatch a month ago. Patience man... can‚Äôt have brand new stuff every week
---
So what is a "stagger" in this case?
---
Because I tried taking max rank Adamantium Skeleton in the theory that I could stand in front of the SBQ and not get hit backward by her wing attacks (i.e. I would just take the hit and keep attacking), and yet I noticed no difference.  I suppose that's something greater than a stagger.
---
/me kills self in shame
---
Quick, Stimpak!  Get your revive in!
---
Yeah, hand to hand (1H/2H and unarmed) cant use the targeting from VATS beyond this guy or that guy.
---
I don't think the targeting bonus applies? But I only see 95% tags anyway.
---
My brain runs on internet explorer so I'm always late into everything.
---
You're not telling me anything new. Have you programmed a game like theirs? 
---
It's not like Bethesda has a monopoly on open world games. There have been others with far better polish. Just excusing it with "it's hard" is a cop out. 
---
I love Bethesda games, but it's fundamentally dishonest to pretend that this is acceptable.
---
just do melee and pick QoL perks early on so you arent wasting perk cards on guns you arent using yet. around 40 you can probably switch to full guns because youll begin having access to end game damage and mutations
---
I have a favourite thing to craft for selling to vendors...
---
Very high weight to value ratio, uses just 3 types of common components and very few of them...
---
Any guesses?
---
What would fix this is if the vending item screen listed legendaries on it
---
Maybe sell the cosmetic outfits? Especially the rarer ones.   Those move pretty quickly through my shop.
---
yes he does! and you have proof he said he would
---
Sorry, but I don‚Äôt like to jump off things and have a fifty-fifty chance of dying each time. And I don‚Äôt run Serendipity- stealth VATS sniper means if I‚Äôm taking fire I‚Äôm doing something wrong. 
---
Although I‚Äôm surprised at how tanky I am anyway. I was running around Uranium Fever last night, unperked meleeing molemen with a bloody bowie knife so I wouldn‚Äôt 1hit them, and we were getting mass spawns of 5-6 at a time. Even at ~15% health, I never died. Only thing I have beyond my Unyielding armor is 1star Blocker, and a teammate with Empath.
---
Yoooooooou've never seen anything else like this in the woooooooorld!  Gasp in sheer terror and amazement as our sword swallower takes an entire Shishkebab up to the HILT!
---
Vetter get moving before shutdown.
---
You are right.
---
Oh that's friggin beautiful thank you
---
I see it often at Sutton station for 12.5k on my cap mule with zero charisma that I leave parked there.  I've lucked out and gotten it from defending workshops on all three of the characters I actually play on though.  
---
You can check the market sub and probably get it for 4-6 k
---
thank you, as it's pretty much spot on. And if you add now how bugs isn't even enough, but most of them being just completely ignored, then this is what's really truly frustrating. I mean right now we have the bug mentioned in my post, but to not even see a fix in near future, not to mention not even recognized by beth, having their support giving generated bot responses for 2 weeks is what really annoys most ppl.
---
How long is idle explosives not starting..it's actually broken for months. i can't count anymore how often i have contacted support over it, but still, today, MONTHS later no fix! not even aknowledged by Beth, stating they are aware of it. Telling us that it will be addressed.
---
Yes, that is indeed unacceptable. Thx dude for your support. I love Bethesda. But it should be both ways.
---
He was funny, just could never get 100% affinity with him.
---
I like your prices, though you're selling yourself a bit short imo
---
Um I'm not sure how to explain it... It is like an animation where your arms get thrown back. I think you might put your weapon away? You are animation locked for a good second or two. When it happens its one of those "what the fuck just happened"
---
What badge you need ?
---
Yeah I tried this a couple times.  First guy kept seeing me follow him, my Chameleon armor kept decloaking as I'm not a very stealthy build or player in this game.  He was very weirded out and I got impatient.
---
Good god people are still posting about this?
---
I would buy some too, but i needed to do few challenges anyway, and after hour server hoping to kill one fucking cave cricket at unncany cavers, with no luck in the end i chosed to never give bethesda any more money for this game.
---
He offered me $10 via paypal. I made a video as well, it's rendering / uploading now, will be released tomorrow. THat guys gonna be broke at this point.
---
That's crazy. He's always had them for me lol. I haven't bought them because of how expensive they are haha but they're there.
---
Yep launching the nuke yourself is the best guarantee. Fissure site is mostly violet and crimson but the amount really depends on the location of the nuke. For SBQ battles most people will drop it far south barely miss the glasses cavern, but that will result in very limited amount of flux since most of the nuke went beyond the map border.
---
Cool, i did same.
---
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm Scotch.
---
Will look out for that. My main idea was to be a sort of armour blacksmith.
---
‚ÄúpC mAsTeR r@Ce‚Äù
---
Sorry, just shitting on everyone that says PC is better than console. That sucks man, hopefully things get tuned better on all platforms.
---
Thanks.  Shows you how much I use VATS.  You'd think I would have noticed this earlier.
---
That might be too much for the gameboy-like servers that run this game. Loading that kind of detail takes memory. I run 4 full machines at all time. Can you imagine the lag on the map with a full lobby and there's alot of traders? 
---
I would be cool dont get me wrong. But i dont thing the current state of this game could handle that.
---
10 or less is a decent price for stims, i think.
---
350 a serum is good, low even. Especially for the violet flux serums
---
No point for that Launcher to exist then.. that is kinda the point of these things.
---
Daaaaaaaaaamn....
---
rolf i forgot about those, but no i don't think it was legendary
---
i would agree. but on the other hand i love the huge open world, how all this world is one dynamic one, unlike destiny, where each area is a closed instance. Idk, but if this is the price for the lack of graphics and stuff would be fine to me.
---
Still, i'd wish they would at least do something against the bugs and not ignore them, like they most times do.
---
However, i agree. When i imagine having all the freedom, this huge world with all its positivities and pros, all on a more modern engine, i guess i'd die, as it would be just too much for me to handle\^\^
---
Ya that bug has been around for awhile. I'm not sure why Bethesda can't change the value in game so that it can drop as 3\*. It seems like an easy fix but idk.  Wood armor is basically useless anyway, having it drop as 3\* would add to it's utility.
---
Buy it and use it yourself, or buy it and give it to me if you're on PC. I'll give you 25K caps for it lol.
---
I believe in Steve.
---
Nice info here. Curious if you swapped out different armor sets if you‚Äôd have similar results for different bosses
---
I have a quad explosive double barrel I named after a terrible country song.  It‚Äôs an implement of death and destruction.  It kills indiscriminately.....yet it‚Äôs doing it for the love of and re-establishment of humanity.    It‚Äôs hard on Appalachia for reason.....just like ‚ÄòDaddy‚Äôs Hands.‚Äô
---
Daddy‚Äôs hands were soft and kind when I was cryin....daddy‚Äôs hands were hard as steel when I done wrong.....daddy‚Äôs hands weren‚Äôt always gentle but I‚Äôve come to understand.....there was always love in Daddy‚Äôs Hands.
---
Yeah I know, just wishful thinking.  There must be a way around it though.  Like, if a tiny star showed up next to the weapons / armor listing or something
---
YES
---
ah okay, now i got exactly what you mean. sry, my english doesn't help me understand straight away sometimes :\_)
---
I was using rifles for most of my gameplay (sneak archer :D), but i was so annoyed from farming ammo, that i picked this meta build. 
---
I would rather use whatever weapon, but most of them don't kill in one shot even basic super mutants. Comeone those are group mobs with decent damage, it is not fun to die at some basic mobs....
---
Seems like the same thing she does.  Arm flail, takes a good 2 seconds to recover from it - which often has the unfortunate side effect of knocking you out of Suppressor's 2 second window, so she can actually "combo" and kill you with the next attack.
---
Weird.
---
I mean, I guess? I got 4 from the last time I found the vendor... it‚Äôs purely cosmetic, too.
---
Why nerfing TSE weapons then?
---
Exactly!
---
PvP should be survival mode only or by agreed duel.
---
But people need to take their frustrations on others by harassing and abusing much lower level players.
---
I‚Äôve gotten downvoted before for asking for a PVP  ricochet perk card or some other defensive solutions for young newbie players...
---
Getting 3* wood is a known bug. If you get it again I would just scrip it immediately to get that extra scrip before it defects to 1*.
---
Well, the volume is hard to control. I've got a little bit of hearing loss.
---
Always be prepared to battle in the wasteland son. This ain‚Äôt a pre apocalyptic liberal rainbow land lol
---
That is weird I normally never get staggered by scorched beast
---
I haven't seen any correlation between trader level and having items that interest me. I see level 250+ traders that have 10 mole man gauntlet plans for 250caps each
---
No problem! Yeah for sure. I run a shop first and foremost, you‚Äôre welcomed to shop there anytime. I‚Äôve got low prices on most things and if you want something cheaper just let me know. I‚Äôm not great to explore with as I‚Äôm over 900 hours in and only do things in game to stock my shop, but I‚Äôll help where I‚Äôm needed
---
fireproof and adamantium skeleton. A blast to the feet takes out those pesky radroaches and mirelurk spawn in the grass.
---
Do you have to tame them cold, or can I aim, pacify, then walk up to tame?
---
Just like neverwinter or something similar
---
Now theres an idea! Maybe a star could signify theres atleast one legendary in the machine. Or maybe show the number of stars for the highest starred item. Its something atleast!
---
They really need to be 100% transparent and accurate with atom shop prices and features for skins / paints / objects.  
---
There‚Äôs so many inconsistencies and misleading or missing critical pieces of info given the nature of what this is (purchased content).
---
It‚Äôs not like there are laws around misleading advertising and sales . . .
---
EG: they gave away that no trespassers sign - if you check the atom shop it seems there was an original intention to either have two or a different texture / model. 
---
EG2: The stalker outfit includes the flag bandana and glasses but that‚Äôs not listed on the page.
---
EG3: the spacesuit ‚Äúset‚Äù goes on sale this weekend - the atom shop currently says nothing about other suits (like the fireman‚Äôs axe set) or if the helmet / suit are Independent
---
but I want an Oompa Loompa NOW...
---
I remember seeing your comments yesterday, well done! Do you mind sharing your build? I‚Äôm swapping from a bloodied melee build to bloodied ranged, seems to be a lot of contention on what perks are best for the ranged setup.
---
A couple of patches ago.
---
A couple events can supplement your acid collection efforts:
---
Path to Enlightenment - kill all the Fireflies and collect their abdomens.
---
Now we have Campfire tales too - kill all the Bloodbugs and scrap their proboscises.
---
You called?
---
what level weapon?
---
I'm sorry, but this actually is a little offensive.  And before you assume anything, I'm in the 130s.  
---
Basically what you're saying is that other players are nothing more than a resource for you to exploit. You'd like to exploit that resource more efficiently with less risk of loss of any type, no matter how minimal.
---
As a player progresses in the game, it's only good game design to make improvement of gear harder and harder. Player vending short-circuits this loop. The opportunity costs for killing a legendary are time and bullets, and you still may get 1 crap. The opportunity cost for going to a camp is a few caps, easily replaced, and you have chances for up to 4x30 craps. 
---
tldr: it's about the hunt, and it has to be for a sustainable game.
---
Wow
---
Bloody mess is probably the best out of all the ones you listed
---
Okay! That sounds great!! I‚Äôm also over 900 hours but, I like it cause I‚Äôm a fan of fallout
---
Excellent advice.   I have the perk but haven‚Äôt used it since I‚Äôm a carnivore.   Great new use for it.
---
That i have no idea, I haven‚Äôt see any amazing deals (type 1) yet. Did run into some possible dupers though, selling highly questionable stuff like multiple explosive lasers and no-longer-rare rare faschnacht masks etc. A level 2 was selling lots of junks at good price outside WS station. As a player walked up to the vending machines the seller walked up and asked ‚Äòhey what‚Äôs up bud I have lots of full set sentinel assassins are you interested?‚Äô lol
---
I feel like such a noob sometimes... :)
---
Bloody Mess is almost always worth it.
---
I‚Äôve never played but every other mmo I‚Äôve played had guilds and they were important to the game and improved the experience.
---
Hunter‚Äôs long coat isn‚Äôt even close to the rarest jacket in the game. I have 5. I haven‚Äôt even *seen*, let alone obtained, the truely rare outfits, like the quest-only reward one. Finding the vendorbot is rare, but if you do, all you need is a server anchor and you can mindlessly relog and reset his inventory every time. He lives for like 3 hours, so you have a lot of time to cycle.
---
Those I have plenty of :)
---
Griefers because they kill other players in pvp?
---
Yes.  Thank you for that.  I also like a game that has consequences.  Case in point, if you take Poseidon energy to make fusion cores and DON‚ÄôT lock the extractor, I‚Äôm going to take your cores.  In fact, I‚Äôll turn invisible and crouch around the corner and keep coming back to take them till I get bored.  Yeah, I‚Äôm that guy.  Don‚Äôt be a dumb ass.
---
to me i just don't like the tires and boob pockets, but actually like the duct tape\^\^
---
I named my Bear Arm "THE RIGHT" yours may win XD
---
PVP is not meant for the game, the gamebryo is too clunky for that, it‚Äôs pretty amazing how the engine was updated and modified so hard for the whole netcode to work, but PVP its clunky, it all boils down to whoever ganks first, survival mode is a great testing ground for Beth if they wanna keep toying with PVP, but all the datamining and news about battle royale and such, it‚Äôs gonna be a shitshow
---
agreed.
---
mind you, 60 per shot, you would think this would cut a 44 scorched in half. nope. litterally half a core.
---
tried in the past against scorchbeast, acid test.
---
gatling laser - zero, gatling plasma, 2 cores,60% hit ratio - maybe 5%
---
gatling gun,mini gun - all laughable.
---
but,as you say, no perks for these. I throw them all away in digust.
---
heavy and energy and I have agreed to disagree.
---
point tho is, why do others seem to like them so much. ? each to their own, no hassle or derision. they do sound cool tho.
---
Someone nuked Morgantown last night and I died in the zone and respawned and started running in to grab my junk (gotta have that hardened mass) and almost nothing was rendering and I thought I was about to crash before I got my stuff back and was freaking out.
---
How the purveyor rolls work:
---
Goddamit!  
---
CRAP.  
---
/sigh  
---
#$@&amp;$%#  
---
hmm, not horrible....  
---
GAH!  
---
SONOFA  
---
Why is this combination even possible?? Why??  
---
Then, eventually, thousands of scrip later: WOOHOO!
---
Another mutanted build... Lame.
---
you are wrong
---
Is it Bloody Mess better than said crit perks, considering I‚Äôd have like 14/15 Luck?
---

---
So far this is what I've come up with, still got some points to spend to fill holes.
---
We had a good laugh when we found it
---
It just works.
---
I thought the "bit of the bar missing" at 100% download was unpacking and installation, at least that's how it works on my machine.  It almost sounds like the process is missing the signal "finished download; start installation."  I've had the whole process stall at installation but never for more than about 5 minutes or so and usually when some other piece of software steps in with a download/update at the same time.
---
A ricochet card that reverse scales with level sounds great, although it might mean a bunch of fresh level 1 killers that get deleted on reaching level 30. The card could be called Logan's Run.
---
really, any bloodied with the right build is top tier. A glass tank, sure, but nothing can get close enough to matter. Even melee.
---
Hell yeah love it
---
the pockets are truly awful\^\^
---
I farm the 'sqoosh' because it's a challenge. Bethesda made a mistake with the damage on the imposter making it overly difficult to play compared to other enemies in the game, ex queen. Challenge accepted. It's fun. Especially because it brings the whole server together.
---
I still formulating an opinion on Project Paradise. Right now it feels impossible to solo and the lack of server wide notification forces you to organize a group beforehand. So far not as fun, but that might change.
---
Thanx. For how long? It doesn‚Äôt say
---
Which makes them ridiculously easy to kill. Power Armor makes you a big, loud and soft target.
---
Ah yes. Sorry for sharing something I considered funny in a Fallout game. In a fallout subreddit. My mistake. Even though it's just a harmless Easter egg from another game.
---
Are you running mods?
---
If you are, have you updated your custom ini accordingly?
---
Sorry, I don‚Äôt know how people play without Marsupial.

Any way we can get more stash is a good idea.  It seems that your Deep Storage should / could work (if they are willing / capable of doing it)
---
I have suggested to them (as have others) that they implement something similar, just not accessible in the game lobby, but a "Main Menu Stash" that can ONLY be accessed when you are in the Main Menu (not in-game). 
---
I suggest anyone who also wants more stash space to submit a Ticket with your suggestions to [https://help.bethesda.net/app/...](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10) ‚Äã
---
(Category: Feedback -&gt; Suggestions -&gt; Feedback Tickets)
---
‚ÄãHere is what I copy paste in my monthly support suggestion ticket (feel free to add to your ticket):
---
**Main Menu Stash**
---
Have a Stash that you can ONLY access from the Main Menu (not in-game), which would have tremendous benefits to the players and Bethesda, such as:
---
* No negative impact on server stability (since it is not in a game lobby), just an interface in the Main Menu that would bring up trade window that allows you to exchange items between your characters in-game stash and the out-of-game stash.  All it would be doing is moving items between the main lobby stash save file and the players save game file (while you are in the main menu).
---
* Could be implemented immediately (as there is no issue with server stability) and more easily than slowly increasing the in-game stash size (which they should still continue to do)
---
* I cannot stress how much the issue of Stash limit has negatively impacted this game to me and the people I play with.  It is without a doubt one of the most requested changes I am aware of and they can easily fix it.
---
* Screening items:  When items are transferred between the in-game stash and the main menu stash, they could set up an simple filter to look for anything (duplicated weapons / items from the developer room etc) quickly and easily, so this will also help them improve the game security too!!!!
---
This is a simple solution for both Bethesda and the players who want more Stash and has ZERO negative effect on those who do NOT want more stash, in fact it will even BENEFIT those players, by allowing other players to move more items out of the in-game stashes, reducing lag etc.
---
**F.A.Q‚Äôs / Typical Comments:**
---
As I have seen many threads with players asking for ‚ÄúMore Stash‚Äù I thought I would also include the most common comments and responses to those comments (to save everyone time)
---
Typical Comment #1: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just drop a bunch of stuff (most stuff is easy to get)?‚Äù
---
Answer:  Because we don‚Äôt want to and shouldn‚Äôt have to (which should be obvious).  The things we collect (weapons / armor sets / chems / materials / clothes / collectibles) are valuable to us and we want to be able to keep them, the end.      
---
Players asking: ‚ÄúCould we get more stash space‚Äù are NOT secretly saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how to manage my inventory‚Äù so please stop offering up useless, unsolicited advice, as we all know how to ‚Äúdrop things‚Äù.  We are all aware of how to manage inventory, but when I purchased this game I did not expect or think it was an ‚ÄúInventory Management Simulator‚Äù as managing inventory is not what I want to do with my time (if you do, fill your boots, to me it‚Äôs a colossal waste of time, boring and unnecessary), and having Main Menu Storage would solve this problem.
---
Typical Comment #2:  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we need more storage / I don‚Äôt want more storage / I get along fine with the current storage etc‚Äù
---
Answer: If you don‚Äôt want more storage, then you don‚Äôt have to use it when it is available (that is your choice).  Other players having the ‚Äúoption‚Äù to have more storage does not harm or negatively affect you, in fact if we were given Main Menu Storage it would actually help you as then players could move much of their in-game stash stuff to the Main Menu Stash, thereby relieving some of the in-game load on the servers for all those items moved.   Also, I strongly suspect that many of the ‚ÄúI dont need more storage space‚Äù people would in fact use it if it became available (just like they have used the extra 200 + 200 additional space given since launch).   
---
Typical Comment #3: ‚ÄúNo other online games let you have massive amounts of stash.‚Äù
---
Answer:  that is 100% WRONG.  As there are in fact other games with unlimited/massive stash or unlimited containers to store things (examples: Elder Scrolls Online (published by Bethesda), 7 Days to Die, Conan Exiles, State of decay 1 &amp; 2, and every Fallout game prior to 76 (and we are all fully aware previous Fallout games were single player offline games, the point is they all allowed us unlimited storage).   There is no point mentioning the differences between these games, as the ONLY issue here is related to ‚Äúmore storage‚Äù.   
---
Typical Comment #4:  ‚ÄúHaving more storage breaks my immersion / goes against my personal view of how a ‚Äúsurvival game‚Äù should work / negatively affects game balance etc‚Äù
---
Answer:  You play how you want to play, and we (who want more storage space) will play how we want to play, it is that simple.  I am NOT trying to tell you how to play, I am asking the company I paid $60 for a broken Beta game (still) to make a slight change that will benefit many and harm none.  People can already use mules to have much more storage space (which is 100% absolutely allowed, so don‚Äôt bother with stupid statements like: ‚Äúmules are against the rules‚Äù as that is absolutely WRONG and you will just look like a complete idiot to say it), but using mules and alternate accounts is extremely inconvenient and wouldn't be needed if we had Main Menu Stash.
---
Typical Comment #5: ‚ÄúHaving more storage space would make the game more unstable / the servers cannot handle it‚Äù
---
Answer:  Main Menu Stash - since all the items in this stash are NOT accessible in-game, they CANNOT negatively impact the in-game server performance.    While it is unbelievably sad and disappointing that they couldn't manage to develop a game that could allow more than 800 stash weight without impacting performance, that is where we are, so it appears one of the most obvious and simplest choices to resolve the issue is to take storage OUT of the in-game environment altogether.
---
Typical Comment #6:  ‚ÄúThis is not Fallout 4 / not Fallout 4 online‚Äù  
---
Answer:  This is probably the most ignorant and pathetic statement made by anyone related to storage in this game, and if you have ever said it, I truly pity you, as Yes, we are all aware this is NOT Fallout 4 (even though Fallout 4 was clearly a massive influence to it) so thanks captain obvious‚Ä¶ but as paying customers we can ask for features that we liked / enjoyed from Fallout 4 (like massive storage)
---
Typical Comment #7:  ‚ÄúNo matter how much storage they give us, some people will always want more‚Äù
---
Answer: First, if they were to give us a significant increase in storage space in the main menu, the amount of people asking for this would go down significantly.  Second, we are paying customers asking for things we want and there is nothing wrong with that, if people want more, they can ask.  Third, accepting mediocrity is a disease, and this game has still not even reached mediocrity, so customers willing to give them advice to help improve it should be encouraged by Bethesda. 
---
If Bethesda is unwilling or incapable of giving us more storage, they could make Junk weight 0 once it is put inside our Stash, it still has weight when on our character, just nothing when put into the box.  Since junk is a stackable item, the quantity of it in your stash has the same effect on the servers if there is 1 or 1,000.  And since Junk makes up a fair amount of room in many people's Stash boxes, this would free up room for players.   This is a simple fix that could be implemented immediately and have a noticeable benefit.  In fact, they could make ANY item that is stackable weight 0 once it is in the Stash (ammo / chems etc) as a way to give us more Stash room.
---
Tried this with mole miners in the ash heap.
---
The boss was a three star legendary but none of the rest of the horde was. I still managed to mostly rank by doing this with a few friends.
---
June. Possibly.
---
They didn't say how long, but usually maintenance lasts anywhere between 2-4 hours
---
Forums seem to be undergoing maintenance too?
---
I have but I‚Äôve been hoarding that currency after missing out on a few PA skins
---
There is a post going around that the better criticals perk is actually bugged and doesn‚Äôt add any damage, with proof. Try searching for it before deciding on that one, I recently removed it from my build.
---
Noticed this too after the burrows release.
---
As best as I can tell they‚Äôve either *also* added a playtime timer per-character (so that character has be active in-game for X amount of time) or they‚Äôve *replaced* the IRL 20hr timer with a playtime timer. 
---
Because I‚Äôve noticed the same thing, specifically with cap stashes. Stashes I emptied at the end of the night yesterday will be there the next night, chiming at me, but if I check them, they‚Äôre empty. They only start to refill if I‚Äôve played for a few hours.
---
I named my Executioner's super sledge The Gallagher Special.  It fits even better when I'm running with Bloody Mess.
---
Okay :)
---
lol, its okay I'll allow it I'm more annoyed at how fallout has become a setting for just references to hold it up.
---
I tend to need it for the fast little buggers like radrats.
---
Why are radrats more of a damage sponge than a super mutant?!
---
Could you share your build? I mean mostly perks, weapon mods and gear.
---
It wasn‚Äôt announced but people have been talking about this for a few days now here on reddit
---
Hahaha, now THAT is someone playing in the spirit of the wasteland. If it‚Äôs too good to be true in Fallout, then it‚Äôs probably human meat.
---
Good luck, buddy. Beth seems to give zero fucks when it comes to hotfixes. We went weeks with broken daily/weekly challenges when they delayed the introduction of the camera, with no word at all from them that they even recognized it as an issue. Likely, you'll just have to wait until the next major update....
---
I have 2 machines one for aromor and one for clothes.
---
I immediately thought of this when you said bee suit:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qVPNONdF58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qVPNONdF58) . Yep, I'm a 90s kid. Oddly, I heard this many years later on the radio and thought it was from the 70s - totally forgot it was from the 90s. Didn't care for the song much as a kid, was far too obsessed with Green Day.
---
Same, that‚Äôs the fun part of this game üòÇ
---
Unfortunately event completed.
---
I‚Äôm not sure I agree on the gun part. Mini gun I‚Äôd definitely agree is more Brotherhood‚Äôy, but the Enclave is where you get the energy Gatling plans so it‚Äôs tough to say they don‚Äôt fit that faction.
---
50 cal is pretty darned fun (it‚Äôs my heavy gun of choice, usually) so I can‚Äôt argue with the choice, but maybe try the energy ones if you get the chance and see what you think. They‚Äôre pretty thematically OK I think.
---
If I ever get a nice SS Power Fist, I'm naming it Fisto because that's all I could think of when using SS Power Fist.  I had a AASS on another character, but it was level 40.
---
&gt; There **are** a lot of mules 
---
FTFY
---
Yeah honestly, having a clan or guild or player faction whatever you want to call it, where I could recruit new players and help them out, would keep me playing for a long time. Just being able to run SBQ event and bring in new players would be a lot of fun.
---
Which workshop dropped it during a defense? I regularly defend power stations, the junk yards and bog town on both PC and XBOX and have not gotten it as a drop.
---
I got a quad  lightweight tesla that became my main Whitesprings weapon. Blast the mob, step back and let others get their shots in.
---
For me number 1 has to be bloody mess followed by serendipity
---
Yes you do. Go fight the queen with a full zealots combat armor set. If you aren't in the nuke zone you are essentially invincible. 
---
I have sets for pretty much every situation. Ghouls, robots, super mutants, exterminators, and hunters. I rarely use the hunters and exterminators. Unyielding in my go to for everything else. The enemy specific sets are cheap to buy. People don't want them. You can probably get a ghoul slayer sentinel set for 10K. Troubleshooter is getting more popular. Run a silo with troubleshooter and you can ignore pretty much every enemy. 
---
Project Paradise is unique as there are insects, animals, robots, and ghouls. Maybe bolstering is the best option in there. Still testing.
---
I loved strong, give him a mini gun and just let him be your best friend and kill everything. Plus he‚Äôs not so judgey like the rest.
---
Thank you for posting about this. Our dev team is aware and working to implement fixes as soon as we can. Thanks for your patience on this matter.
---
Yes! Just to further confirm: Around 15 minutes from now we're going to bring 76 offline for maintenance and to address an exploit. Downtime is expected to be shorter than usual, but I don't have an exact timeframe to share at the moment.
---
The forums are undergoing maintenance as well, or we would have a post there. I'll update this reply as soon as we've brought the game back up.
---
I‚Äôve seen several posts about better critical not being so better.  In essence they are like speed demon, in that they will not get boosted additively.  The implication is better criticals is as good as you get, so eagle eyes and a weapon boost don‚Äôt stack, ergo if you have those, don‚Äôt take better criticals.  Hope that is properly stating other‚Äôs points (I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be corrected if not).
---
Grim reaper was amazing in FO4.  Without the gong here I never notice it proccing, so I‚Äôm skeptical of its worth.  I do believe bloody mess first, 4 leaf clover second is perhaps a consensus (would love to hear other tales).  
---
On my pistol character I‚Äôve taken starched, psycho lvl 1, bloody, clover, grim reaper, and have been fooling around with the last 3-slot as I‚Äôm still undecided.
---
Thanks. I noticed that too, I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôll get fixed. But yet again, bulk scrapping...

---
Watch some Captainoob videos and take notes on what sort of character you want to build. His videos helped me optimize my build (commando) and he tests all sorts of weapons with different characters. He even demonstrated how you can take down a scorchbeast with a level 1 pipe rifle.
---
If you're going the shotgunner route go max level on strength and get all the shotgunner perks early on to max out on damage. With strength builds you can choose to go the melee route or the heavy gunner route, but you can only get max damage from one weapon type at a time. Also, max out the bloody mess perk card for even more damage, which you'll need 3 luck for.
---
I thought this was fixed? Didnt they say that pvp would be contained to only inside of the workshop?
---
Show up, shoot shit. Use stimpaks. Leave junk at camp.
---
Thank you for the response!
---
Better than my nocturnal with extra bashing
---
Actually, I *have* done programming. And even a basic program will still pull up bugs all over, and even after countless hours of testing you will still miss bugs that your users will find. It's something anyone with any programming knowledge knows.
---
And we HAVE had improvements, look at this game compared to Morrowind. Shit, look at this game compared to Fallout 4. Now add a multiplayer world on top of all of that, and it's now a whole new realm of programming on top of an already vast system.
---
It isn't that "it's hard", it's that it is literally impossible for them to test for every single thing when making a patch, they just don't have the manpower or time for that. They test some core features and then whatever else they have time for, but there is no way they can test for and patch every single bug that comes up. It isn't that it's sloppy, it's that the system is complicated as hell and they have a team of a handful of programmers working on a truckload of projects. Give them some slack, and have some understanding, instead of talking shit and assuming they're just sitting around with thumbs up their asses. If it was easy to fix, it would be fixed, right? They don't want their game to be bugged out any more than you do.
---
This. I swear this was in patch notes.
---
Perked and built right, I‚Äôd claim HW is the highest DPS in the game. Bloodied HW/PA build with a Primed, BE 50cal? You‚Äôre pushing about 900 damage a shot (to Scorched) at 19% health when Adrenaline stacks up. Maybe more; I think I did that math WITHOUT explosive, since I only have bloodied so far. 
---
Sure, a DCG can hit bigger numbers. But that 50cal is pushing out 9 rounds a second, at 200 range. Airborne? Landed 100 feet away from you? No problem, keep blasting. I seriously notice when I do sheepsquatch/Imposter/Queen/Arkatos fights, the difference in health loss when I‚Äôm firing vs when I stop to clear adds- I look back and the health hasn‚Äôt moved much. I start unloading and it starts dropping noticeably.
---
I'm the guy that builds the extractors and leaves them for others to share and take as they need. I guess you think I'm a dumb ass. Nice to meet you.
---
It doesn't upset me that someone takes all the cores, that's what they're for. It makes me sad that some people get a chance to rebuild the world and want to make it a zero-sum game again.
---
Oompa loompa doopity doo,
---
Bethesda's working on content for you.
---
Oompa loompa doopity dee,
---
But you have to wait for good DLC.
---
How much total AP do you have?
---
I guess it depends on what weapons you‚Äôre focusing on using. There are people that know/have researched it, I personally haven‚Äôt so take my advice with a grain of salt. 
---
Having crit perks are from what I know are based on each projectile so with shotguns they are probably best. I have 12 luck with bloodied mess, starched genes, class freak and I forget the other stuff I have actually. With my rifle, commando, heavy gun builds with card swapping I don‚Äôt see much of a difference in how fast my crit builds up. When I switch it up to shotguns there was a little more of a difference but for me not worth to many points into it.
---
With my usual run around rifle build after like 3-5 shots my crit is built up enough again. But my advice probably isn‚Äôt the best because I haven‚Äôt researched in depth the differences. I just like the boost in damage to all weapons with blooded mess üôÉ
---
They literally gave us a terminal for this....I think.  Has anyone tried using it for more then looks?
---
Only reason I didn‚Äôt mention Serendipity is that I‚Äôm not running Bloodied.
---
Ok I‚Äôm gonna tell ‚Äòem you trained me.
---
Three dozens of carp so far, so I‚Äôm still in phase #2
---
I wish i could upvote this more than once. Its genius! Although, i am yet to fall into a fissure. Seen it happen a few times. Lol.
---
Is this the exploit that flight capable mobs are using to prevent being hit in VATS by melee attacks that is being fixed?
---
Swapping DPS perk cards for carry weight perk cards must be the worst idea I've read all day.
---
OP is making a melee build, so he'll carry very few weapons AND have boosted STR. You really don't need extra stims/radaways when you're a melee build, as almost everything drops dead before you even swing your weapon.
---
Also, the go-to melee build is bloodied, paired with the Radicool perk, Adrenal Reaction mutation and unyielding cavalier armour for maximum damage output. You'll WANT to keep your rads above 50% at all times. Put your sun-kissed perk where the sun don't shine bro. OP will probably end up carrying a gamma gun on him, incase his rads dips below 50%
---
True - though in the wild you see a ton of energy weapons from Brotherhood corpses.
---
Heavy weapons help. I prefer the humble Gatling gun but if you have the Action Hero, then now is as good as any to let rip. Provided the Queens landed, accuracy is appalling.
---
Eh? What - when was this a thing? I'm on here most days and I missed this...........
---
Make sure to cripple the wings, Enforcer can do that easily since you only need to hit your target, not necessarily deal damage. That obviously opens up DPS for everyone present.
---
Auto correct sucks ok.
---
Sit Down Son is better and what I constantly into the mic lol
---
Great points. I'm using those picks, but they may be poor general recommendations. 
---
* Fireproof may not be necessary in PvE, but I appreciate it against scorchbeasts and  exploding cars. Right now my armor is all ultra-light for carry weight and AP regen; both to run further and keep dodgy working. I haven't tested switching to dense. I should try that. 
---
* Coming down from rejuvenated is a risk, but the larger HP pool means that 20% is a slightly larger number. I died to the drop once, a long time ago, so I cannot dismiss the concern, but every other time it was fine. I really value it for the hydrated bonus, for more AP regen.
---
I get my allotted 1400 caps from the vendors every day.  I sell all my unwanted chems as well as marine tactical helmets (I've no idea where I found the plan to make them) they go for 31 caps each with hard bargain level 3 and they cost 1 plastic, 1 glass and 3 rubber.  I have all my usual spots for farming those mats too.
---
Please don‚Äôt forget to fix the broken language pointers for our European brethren.  And casual shielded underarmor while you‚Äôre at it.
---
What ever I have the junk for. Civil war outfits/hats are an easy craft with a nice value added.
---
Snallygaster spit attack is a novelty item, that's a fair price to have something to show off. It's more for players with expendable income.
---
New dupe glitch on you tube posted today maybe??
---
thx dude and i know, sadly...not to mention idle explosives being broke and doesn't start for months :/

Unfortunately, Bethesda is not likely going to give us much more "in-game" storage space (re: server instability issues that may never be resolved...) so I have suggested to them (as have others) that they implement a "Main Menu Stash" that can ONLY be accessed when you are in the Main Menu (not in-game). 
---
Sure.How can i share pics here?
---
I don't think you should find another game. I think you should keep doing what you like. If it overlaps on my enjoyment enough, Bethesda will change the rules again. Developers don't really care what we do, as long as they keep selling the products. Just keep in mind that your gameplay style is more likely to be affected by nerfing and rebalance than mine is.  :)
---
Oooof
---
It‚Äôs just blueish steel but it looks quite nice at times in the light
---
Its more mayhem than a challenge to me personally - and some people just show up for loot bags.  Its a lousy event without much thought put into it and expensive to pop too.  Paradise is the true bring the server together event but it lacks a server-wide notification - oh Bethesda, the little things you make mistakes on.
---
Whenever I replace a weapon with a similar but better weapon I just put Mk. II behind it (and obviously counting on from there).
---
But honestly, I don't replace my weapons that often anymore. I'm pretty happy with my loadout, although I am finally discovering the joys of heavy guns.
---
This. Please. I beg all of u 1shotters... please dont touch the bosses.. not yet :‚Äô(
---
I could see this happening. This would bring the players closer and add a bit more role-playing for the ones who want it. 
---
And it would be easier for the new players who just feels lost in this huge world to enjoy the game. 
---
Great idea
---
I hope so, those damn insects have been glitching the game out for far too long now!
---
Yeah, I found one in a metal box in the BoS Camp in the same room as the Technical Info drop.  The only one since the Scout quest line started.  It's so annoying as it's the only item in the Leatherworker badge quest I have to finish and can't because there's no reliable way to get them.
---
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you make like a tree and get outta here‚Äù -Biff Tannen
---
I remember Pete Hines promising private servers at some point. The map is still big enough to avoid the people you don't really like. Put your camp in BFE and don't be a vendor. I've had a couple of stealth camps that people didn't even realize were there when they passed through.
---
Laser gats are some of the worst heavy weapons (I think only the broadsider is worse).
---
VATS is bad for HW in general, especially bad for low damage/high RoF ones like laser gat. 
---
TS is nice, but adding that additionally durability loss to an energy weapon that still has poor durability kind of sucks. 
---
Reduced weight is decent on a HW; depends on the player. I run Bear Arms, so RW is very ‚Äúmeh‚Äù to me.
---
Woe be to those that curse RNGeesus
---
That Dragon will one shot a SB with the right build behind it. I do it all the time on my Rifleman.
---
If you are using Bandolier 2, then that 10mm is weightless. Hold onto it until you find a SMG you like, then go on a murder spree with free bullets.
---
The whole point is that you *don't* kill things in one shot.  Make it more interesting for yourself by trying to make do with weaker weapons or weaker armor.
---
Happened to 2 of the assault tron heads I got
---
Bold of you to assume i have any stash space
---
I still think the most broken secondary effect for shotguns is limb damage.  I have a Quad Crippling Sawn Off.  It does garbage damage to the point that i've tried tapping enemies with it, gotten the hit sound and effect, but still no loot.  What it does well, however, is crippling.  I can easily bring 2, maybe 3, deathclaws to their knees in a couple of seconds.  Then I can, at my leisure, finish them off.  It can ground Scorchbeasts immediately after they take off again(if I didn't finish them off when they landed the first time.  In short, a crippling shotgun is a melee build's best friend.
---
So, uh, not much, in my (combat) informed opinion. But some people like a light show, and a TS laser gat makes a hell of a raver weapon.
---
Thanks for the response
---
Thanks. It seems it was the right choice to post on reddit over this issue, after being unsuccesful at Bethesda's official forums with it before .
---
However, i don't hold a grudge, i usually just love your games too much lol...but just happy, when i can enjoy doing the possum challenges again!
---
So thanks for aknowledging this problem and look forward to this fix.
---
Thank you!
---
PC Master Race.  Always.
---
I tried to meelee attack a ceiling turret once, and ended up inside the ceiling. That was interesting.
---
I have a Combat Carl (combat rifle) and a Pew Pew (laser rifle). I tried to think of what Jinx would name her guns, I'm not very original.
---
Add me at psn so i can send u pics myyramakoljonen
---
been playing since release. I'm one of the people who were heavily critical of the "rank 3 weapon perks are useless, just take 3 rank 1s". but the more you play, and the more you have to juggle luck cards, the more you realize maximizing your damage output isn't always the best course of action.
---
I find psychopath useless. grim reaper's less so, but it hardly ever triggers in pvp and I personally don't like perks with random activation.
---
the rest are crit/vats build staples. if you're using autos/shotguns (as you should), I'd put better criticals at the bottom of the list, after bloody mess. with four leaf clover and critical savvy you'll be banking so many crits the extra damage won't make a difference. more crits are better than stronger ones.
---
for the last one I'd take bloody mess and rank 1 of something, maybe better crits (if it even works at all) or serendipity if you have a bloodied build or pvp often. maybe drop class freak if you can afford.
---
I know, they should at least face a suspension until they can be brought back to the game safely in a future patch.
---
That is Awesome, I  call mine brain matter. Lol.
---
Lmao I was thinking the same thing yesterday.
---
Bulk Spring for 100 caps?!?! HA!
---
"wE aLsO nEeD a mR.HaNdY tO mAnAgE oUr CaMp wHiLe wE'rE aWAy" you sound like one of these guys. The game is a grind, that's the point of it, player level has no bearing on what you may get out of their vending machines.  This is no different than the gamble you take going out and hunting wild legendaries on  your own.
---
I‚Äôd buy that, yeah. Laser for Brotherhood, Plasma for Enclave.
---
It kinda is. Which is why I like the legendary survival weapons. They've got good names. Although, I only have The Action Hero and the Resolute Veteran.
---
But for my other weapons, I have a silenced hunting rifle named "Ghost", a combat shotgun named "Boom-boom" (an homage to my similarly named exploding combat shotgun from FO4), a handmade rifle named "This Machine...", a TSE Gattling called "Devastator", an exploding LMG named "Fury" and a furious Plasma Gattling named "Green Death Machine".
---
So yeah, not the most original stuff but it works for me.
---
So, I mentioned this on a Discord and it sounds like maybe the distinction here is that Adamantium Skeleton will prevent staggers by virtue of preventing broken limbs (which, naturally, cause you to stagger), but *not* cases where you get hit by a powerful enemy attack and nothing is actually crippled, like the Scorchbeast wings or the Yao Guai claws.

I thought camp destruction was allowed in Survival

Shoot the adds for xp if you‚Äôre confident the group of people can take it down in time

I have done this many times! I use the bridge South of New Gad. Summerville Dam. I've done it for others here on reddit. I'll be on tonight after 5pm CST.

Damn, I‚Äôm on XB1. No worries, thanks for the reply!

It isn‚Äôt currently. Probably should be yeah

I thought events were on an hr-timer.

I run Blackwater Mines like every other hour.

Then make camp building material effect durability so metal buildings are almost impossible to destroy. Remove limit on turrets and allow us to fill every space we can with missiles, lasers and 5.56 rounds that we want.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt even be upset about it, but on top of glitching they‚Äôre also duping!!! I used to just have one bloodbug show up on Free Range but they‚Äôve found a way to dupe themselves! Now tons of them show up, all cheating with their anti-vats exploits. I‚Äôm ok with a permanent ban

Mole Rats, Radrats, Mirelurk Spawn - it's time to break out the Tesla Rifle and jump like a maniac.

Not a terrible thought.  Anyone want to burn through some scrips as a test?
---
You are missing the repetative visits to toxic Larry's for acid. Murder 3 snarleygasters hop servers and repeat until insanity.
---
This is genius!
---
Ha. Now I wanna watch it again.
---
Jetpack on PA. Or just play the game without mutations. Stupid addition. Id like em if they had physical attributes. But just feels like cheating cause they are WAY op when you include class freak.
---
For some reason, when I use dodgy my AP is completely drained from 230 to zero whenever an enemy melees me. Rendering me unable to sprint! Are you facing the same issue?
---
&gt; Please don‚Äôt forget to fix the broken language pointers for our European brethren.
---
We haven't forgotten and we are actively working to address these issues as soon as we can! Thanks for sticking with us on this.
---
I was harvesting lead the other day and got stuck in a tight spot and rather than fast traveling out I just server hopped. All the lead nodes had respawned. May have been a lucky hop. Haven‚Äôt tested again since then due to the fact that I have more lead than I‚Äôll need for a while.
---
PP does seem the hardest to plan around. FYI you can turn the robots off so you don‚Äôt have to worry about them during the fight.
---
As a big fan of Campfire Tales, and melee, I'm feeling this one alongside ya. We're working on a fix for a future update.

been saying this from launch. my spawn point currently is in an irradiated pond or INSIDE my fusion generator
---
I've noticed she seems to like giving out life saving or auto stim alot, out of 4 armor pieces I got yesterday 3 were auto stim and were trapper or wood
---
Which backpack?  There's the Nuka Cola one and the Black backpack.  The black one I bought requires you to craft an entirely new backpack, and then mod it.  It's not a skin to apply to an existing backpack.
---
Good points.
---
Dense, for all but Marine Armor, is stupid rare though.  Padded is a lesser variant you can actually learn through scrapping, and it's definitely better than nothing.  I run Dodgy too and can appreciate the desire to keep the AP high and flowing.  It can be quite irritating when your fate is in the hands of a fickle server that is slow to start refilling your AP.
---
I have a railway rifle (AA +10% dmg if aim), a plasma rifle with flamer mod for have some FUN and a vampiric lmg for SB(Q) fight. Atleast I use this weapons.
---
Right now I dont have any build, I am collecting perks and then I'll switch for a rifle/heavy hibrid. 
---
Maybe that time I'll use that Dragon instead the railway gun. I'll keep it if its that powerful :)
---
Ironicly, SBQ dropped it :)
---
It really thought me and my Mrs off when we started new characters
---
Persevere, Uranium Fever is your friend for scrip, and the occasional 45 3* shotgun. I finally got a TSE gatling from the Purveyor. I nearly crapped myself staring at the screen, my heavy prefers gatling.
---
The vending machines has been a great source of income since they went live.  Sell stuff people want.
---
I would like to be able to unbundle perk cards I have ranked up. I find I need one more point and can't use something because it is level 2. So, I need to get it again? So I can have one point. That's just silly.
---
That's one insane devil.
---
If you know the mods, why not offer a modding service and advertise it here?  I've outsourced modding in the past for specific mods I didn't know as well as paint jobs.  That could be pretty cool.

---
crit savvy is all you really need if you're going VATs
---
if you are going for mutations 2 in starched/3 in class 3 in savvvy and 3 in bloody mess that's already 13 .. plus you only need 1 or 2 hits from the 45% mark to get another crit
---
if you're not going mutation 3 bloody/3 savvy/3 reapers sprint and you're still golden
---
so I'd rank em
---
1. Bloody Mess
---
2. Crit Savvy
---
3. Grim Reaper's (no mutations)
---
Ill try that
---
Okay that makes more sense. Thank you
---
I heard that more agility = better sneak. Is it a drastic improvement to sneak?
---
Maybe you should realize that you posting the same exact comment over and over is extremely creepy and unhealthy.
---
Thought you could destroy camps when you're in pvp with owner.
---
I love that notice when it pops up after playing for a few hours
---
For me challenging is, when you have some hard tactic, that you must understand. Not mob with high healt and damage pool....
---
Hahahaha have people actually posted about that before?  What would a Mr. Handy do at a CAMP?  Sweep imaginary dust off the floor?
---
https://discord.gg/Vx2rSbW
---
Hahaha that explains the usernames I'm seeing recently. There's one guy on survival who is a cunt. So I logged in the other day and maybe 8 players had variations of his name mocking him. It was fucking awesome.
---
Lmao I will think of something good! Its gotta just come to me. Damn, downvoted for asking a question :p

Music to my ears... Well eyes... Nevermind, music anyway, good music.

Pretty certain it‚Äôs intended to have no restrictions

Before I switched from PA Shotgunner to PA Heavy Gunner after Patch 8 shotgunner nerf, my role was crippled.  Go to the back side of the SBQ and make a sweeping arc behind her.  Get multiple shots on her left wing, left leg, right leg and right wing.  Then stop and rotate back the way you came.  This will keep her frozen in place making melee job much easier.
---
Go to the file directory at the bottom of the screen. Go to "This PC" on the side, and then go into your drive that is holding the game directory. Click on "Fallout 76" to open the directory, and scroll down until you see the "Fallout 76" application. It'll be the one with the vault door logo next to it. Right click on the file UNDER THE APPLICATION ONE, (the .ini file) and hit open. Go all the way down, click the space after the very last thing on the notepad, and hit 'enter' twice on keyboard to put a space between the last entry and the one you are adding. Add the following, replacing the values after "=" with your info. After that...file,save,restart PC. Good to go.

Damn. It's Friday night here. I was settled in with a bunch of beer for a long run. Hopefully doesn't last too long.
---
Do people still do it? Haven‚Äôt seen one pop up in ages.
---
I agree.
---
2* = demi God tier at best
---
I second going for a melee build but I'd suggest going two-handed. I tried both and without a doubt two-handed weapons out perform anyt of the 1h(medium) is most situations. I never tried (fast) tho
---
Or just turn on pacifist mode and don't take workshops... has someone said this before? /s
---
No I'm on Xbox :(
---
I agree. I've played almost 1200 hours and I've had my base destroyed/attacked just a few times. I always had the materials I needed to instantly rebuild. 
---
If the LOCATION of your C.A.M.P. and it's items are removed, then I'd understand.
---
My unyielding rifle guy has 34ish agility and I can be face to face with a 68 super mutant and he won‚Äôt see me.  Gotta have the light off of course.  Escape artist I believe is still a must for the whole running while sneak thing.  The sneak perk cards are not essential for an unyielding build.
---
Better still - why don't we have our own bee-hive to harvest honey in CAMP
---
After that...file,save,restart PC. Good to go. After doing all this, instead of using the bethesda launcher, just launch the .exe for the FO76 application. I shortcut mine into Steam as a non steam game and never touch the Bethesda launcher unless there is a game update. You could also shortcut the .exe onto desktop for the same results, just with no Steam overlay or integration. Hope this helps.
---
I know that feeling! So far most of my best drops came from WS, sometimes aren‚Äôt even nuked. But for some reason mama murmur just hates me. Junkies broadsider, hunter‚Äôs grenade launcher, all the useless combos you can and can‚Äôt think of, she gave them to me.
---
lol ok then feel free to sell me them at this low price you think they are worth
---
I have a bloodied explosive black powder rifle and my tse the dragon still tops that by like 200 damage. I dont like bloodied builds too much but I just got serendipity so maybe I'll run one for a while.
---
Bit overkill, i think you would have had it with just 4K üëÄ
---
Don't know how efficient it is for the actual refresh, but while I'm running around overencumbered, the AP drain from running is significantly different with 1,2 or three pieces equipped
---
Actually there's two sets of tests, with one showing no effect, and the other showing it works - so the jury's still out on that one (planning to try testing under other conditions when the servers are back up)
---
that is what i thought too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Every. Damn. Time. I sit down to play.
---
OK. Yep. Definitely a glitch.
---
Don‚Äôt use legendary vendor until you get a good drop in the world. It will mostly show which loot tables you are in. If you‚Äôre getting wood... DONT BUY AGAIN! Take a break and then when you get a somewhat ok drop, then you go use the vendor.
---
Friday night? Well hello there time traveller!
---
Will the music possum badge glitch be fixed also?   I‚Äôve played every instrument and it still won‚Äôt register I‚Äôve done it
---
You have to wonder with the sheer insulation and protection that some people call for in game, as to what they're like in real life.
---
Pathological entitlement lol.
---
The would be a bug not an exploit , but I bet you it might involve using weapons beyond breaking point amirite amigos!?
---
I have a baseball bat called ‚Äúbringer of abortions‚Äù
---
Bloodied and explosive can both be on the same weapon
---
I will be whole week out, hoping i could farm some atoms today, well, lets drink vodka and dance at main menu theme.
---
*Oh, the poor raider can't destroy my camp*.
---
Well I understand some people suffer, in real life, so many humiliations during the day (at work, school, ...) that they need this kind of virtual gratification where they can safely abuse others.
---
Beethesda
---
Other than the inconvenient disconnects FO76 is running just fine for me.
---
Didn't know that, sorry :)
---
I go for 3 so that I have the greatest chance of a good effect
---
For armor you can look for unyielding to take advantage of being dam near dead
---
I named my old combat shotty Ol' Reliable cause it never deteriorated as fast as my other weapons seemed to.
---
Well are you gonna be doing a melee or ranged bloodied? Either way because you're gonna be so low on health you really need to have serendipity at 3 stars to  Have close to A5050 shot to avoid incoming damage. On top of that if you're in power armor you have a lot of options but without power armor I'd go with barbarian at 3 radicool under endurance, evasive at 3, and born survivor teamed with nerd rage.
---
Worst quest/challenge ever... someone told me they found DC hide in a quano pile. Ive been digging through shit piles for 2 weeks and haven't found one (along with my other farming methods). He wins.
---
I beg to differ, the mobs are actively (ab)using a known bug with no shame or semblance of repentance to their advantage.
---
This makes it an exploit.
---
Haha
---
*Laughs manically in customization before the inevitable, repeated instances of game start-up failure and subsequent troubleshooting cause me to pull my hair out and reset everything to default. AND THEN I DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL IT JUST FRIGGIN WORKS!*
---
Can I ask that you put firecracker whisky on the radar to be fixed also? Thanks.
---
Level 3 safes have terrible loot on them, why bother opening them? Swapping perk cards for a random leather left leg? Pointless.
---
I'd say about 75% of enemies that aren't 1-shot by bloodied melee are glowing enemies. E.g. glowing sheepsquatch/fog crawlers. So I'd definitely use rank 3 glow sights nonstop!
---
Sorry, forgot to mention in this one.  
---
Behemoth has 150 DR, but the rifle I used has 50% armor pen. I unequipped tank killer, and the rifle doesn't have an armor pen mag. So DR according to simple math ends up at 75 - and Awareness agrees. The calculations in the table in another response to this thread are based on the armor formula from FO4, which supposedly hasn't changed.  
---
I'll probably have time to go test with different weapons on different targets later tonight.

Only shows 3 specific dailies.  Nothing else.

Shit. Thursday night! Guess I've had enough beers.
---
If you pick a lock and get wanted can you then destroy camps in adventure mode just asking for a friend.
---
I prefer the 3 cards as you can drop your damage and drop in support cards when needed. 
---
I have 3 maxed out rifleman cards and have spent my last two level ups on getting the 1 point rifleman cards so I can free up 6 points to use 3 lockpick cards, butchers bounty 2, and green thumb whilst exploring. 
---
I agree there needs to be a shake up and I think we should be able switch of ranks of fully maxed cards when we want. so I can make my lvl 3 rifleman card a lvl 1 instead of having to invest again in the same card.
---
That would require a lot of deathclaw hide
---
You'd have a better time buying 8 McChickens + tax with that 9$ you have and spending the rest of the night on the toilet.
---
It's a free market! Vote with your dollars. Freeeeeedooooom.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and even I know this deserves an upvote haha
---
if you want to tag the queen, then clear the ground trash mobs, that's always very appreciated.
---
being a heavy gunner, i have perks that give me damage resistance while firing, which help. but occasionally my screen will just be flashing red constantly and i actually see my health start to drop, i back off the gatling and there are 5 scorched or a stinking radscorp attacking me. keeping that stuff out of the faces of people putting damage into the queen helps tremendously (also you get a lot of XP for the large number of kills).
---
it also helps if you're going to play both sides to build up e.g. Adrenaline perk while clearing mobs, then when clear, turn and put that extra damage into the queen. same with VATS Crits, if that's your thing - fill your meter with trash, then give the Crits to the queen.
---
as far as general advice - yeah leave your junk at home, it's pretty common to die/respawn and no big deal. i also tend to put stimpaks and disease cures on a hotkey, probably one in every 5 things that attack you on the ground is diseased. maybe even use antibiotics or foods that give you disease resistance before it starts. make/bring extra ammo, you always need more than you think.
---
double check your perks, nothing worse than realizing you left on super duper or you forgot to put Gunsmith back on and now your stuff is broken.
---
lately i've also been noticing that i have bobbleheads and magazines sitting around i haven't used, bring that stuff! extra 20% damage (or whatever the specific perk is) goes a long way!
---
oh - most importantly, have fun. it's gonna be chaotic and noisy and awesome. :D
---
I see one like, once a week... I assume people who are playing wioth new characthers try their luck with the free card
---
From what I‚Äôve been gathering, people are going for 2* mainly for 2 reasons.
---
1) You can buy more from the vendor
---
2) The third effect isn‚Äôt really worthwhile/needed
---
I doubt this will be fixed, unfortunately.
---
Awesome, thank you so much!
---
I find the sleeping ghouls funny. I call them ankle biters. The first time I saw one I didn't know what was happening. I killed it, looted it, walked away. It followed me. It took me a minute to figure out what was attacking me. Lol
---
Do you play on PC? I do and have been using the mod since its release back in Nov. 2018. Beth isnt going to ban anyone for using mods like that. Its one of the most downloaded and used mods on PC to this day.
---
Address an exploit. Most likely some new dupe method.
---
Yet somehow the vegetation is immune.  My deathclaw flora never dies.
---
I wish bugs and balance had higher priority than they seem to have now...
---
Cannibalism.....cannibalism never changes....
---
hopefully its the new vendor dupe exploit.
---
I‚Äôm thinking of ranged and thanks
---
Yea, that be fun, repairing my vendors everytime a player doesnt like the prices
---
On PVP servers, sure, go nuts, but adventure mode is fine as it is
---
Strong would be proud of human
---
Out of curiosity, how are your Special stats distributed?
---
They‚Äôre abusing anti armor rounds quite possibly unlimited ammo
---
Because they where duuped to hell breaking the whole game economy... the number of TSE still going arround is till astoneshing...
---
It would be nice to see a roadmap on fixes for these.
---
Not to be a d*ck but  why do you keep purchasing armor with your hard earned scrip when you know there is a bug?
---
So now you can change your username that displays to other players? Seems dangerous if blacklisted market traders start changing their names and whatnot
---
Sounds like you ran the companion mod that gives them unlimited ammo.
---
The only thing extremely creepy is the weird stalker like behavior...
---
I have another really good idea to solve that same issue:
---
**Make event rewards worth players' time.**
---
You know how often I see Project Paradise or Free Range pop and just go "Eh... pass" simply because there's no actual point in doing those events? Those events were fun the first couple of times, but they can't expect players to keep grinding those for the current rewards. 
---
On the other hand, Encryptid and Campfire Tales are events I always attend because Encryptid is really fast and usually drops at least something worth my while, and Campfire Tales can grant Possum Tokens which are useful for the backpack grind.
---
I can accept that such a thing is bugged for a few day.
---
But it really feels like Bethesda's communication and priorities are messed up.
---
Like, one week after those bugs happened, we got a massive 7 Go update. I though "Well, I suppose they messed up so bad or they worked quick, so we have to download  Patch 9.5 again".
---
Fair enough.
---
But, nope. It didn't fixed anything. And Bethesda didn't noted up or even made a comment about a 7 Go patch!
---
It didn't even received a number. And it didn't fixed anything - I heard that it was related to lightning issues but I didn't noticed less lightning issues. Maybe it's me, alright.
---
And then, there was a 40 Mo patch that got a number. Still nothing about the botched translation.
---
As noted before, on PC, you can download a patch that reinstall the pre-patch translations. It was made by fans in a few days.
---
And Bethesda can do a 7 Go light patch in a few day, but not correcting a translation issue?
---
I can totally accept that a translation isn't ironed out in the first go. I can work my way around the fact that the subtitles for many tadpole events (like the Atletics) were subtitled in english for starting the event, and the ending was nonsense (the subtitling said something like "Deathclaw head" ) because I had the voiceover in French.
---
I could even just play with untranslated text. At least I'd have a clue. But when my objectives says "10 mm silencer" that doesn't help.
---
Plus, this focus on a brand new part of the patch! It's not as if this text was related to a minor side quest.
---
It's the big thing that most players are gonna grind form the get go because it's the new thing.
---

Well, you are right. But the turrets are stupid as a rock. They watching as a supermutie shooting in a nice open place in bright sunlight, in close range...
---
If they get a nice boost in AI, you can try to pillage my camp. Even you can take 20% off my junks and stored ammo if you manage that.
---
*Strong* ***loved*** *that.*
---
It's probably duping. 
---
I have a friend that is involved in shady ventures, and we recently did one for one swaps on handmades, and her inventory was full of duplicates, naughty guurl.
---
Let's just say that there will be more furious, +50 vats critical handmades appearing in ps4 vending machines lol. 
---
Inb4 the Reeeeeeeeeeee

My favorite is the blocks spelling WE KNO and red hand in the station house at Mount Blair trainyard.
---
Lucien, you will be missed.
---
mostly yes or the ability to do so. What i dont want is all the cards on the screen that i know i wont use. Just something to clean it up a little.
---
Want new content switch to another game
---
True. Just be careful. I mean you still have to add them by their account. Not the ingame username. I think.
---
Don't forget about the Adrenal Reaction mutation! Huge damage increase, but you'll need the Class Freak to negate its negative effects
---
Already tried that. Accidentally sent the bug report to EA instead üò¢
---
Anytime üëç
---
I have a couple of great 3 star weapons so I mainly roll for 3 star armor. If it's good but not useful to me I sell it if crap I script it.
---
Well shotguns are the one exception, as they have always been absurdly overpowered as all hell with the explosive trait. With other weapons it's far far less impressive. Minigun went from a useless ammo waster to a solid boss killer thankfully with the patch, AA + firerate causes it to kill the lvl 100 bullet sponges in very short order faster than any other weapon in fact, but yeah miniguns are not good for much of anything else due to the windup times.
---
Dense chest armor mod with Fireproof works wonders as well; not just with explosions but Scorchbeast sonic screeches as well.
---
Seems like beth is just fixing exploits. Then they are working on shit manager told them to add. And this one guy who is working 16hours a day, does bug fixes after he is done with new content for managers.
---
Sorry, i love you beth, i love fo76 most from all games, but you are maintaining this game wrong! Which can happen, i don't have right to tell you so, but comeon focus!!!

wasn't even aware there are other language versions of fallout with (i guess) different servers.
---
This is what happens when you skip breakfast.
---
this is how it seems to me also..
---
I started doing it myself on my last couple transactions
---
Only reason for hotfix....
---
Yes all of us who PVP are moronic fools questing for epeen domination. You nailed it!
---
your doctor is a griefer...don't trust him.  He just wants to lob grenades at you
---
LMAO YES. Well I played for 5 minutes first excited to work on my possum badges, and then kicked out :(
---
Survival mode argument is valid for this. In survival mode it should 100% allow this HOWEVER... for true survival mode you also shouldn‚Äôt be able to easily switch between survival and adventure mode with the same character! 
---
Sorry but if you want to play survival you should have to get your supplies and junk in survival and all your gear. 
---
Fact that they allowed players to transfer everything to and from is a joke in itself! 
---
From the start survival mode eliminated many who wanted to try it due to trolls just waiting to troll players before they spawn in... wow... that‚Äôs fun...üôÑ
---
When you run out of supplies they come back to Adventure... pretty weak for a survivalist... and not exactly survival if you can go back to a safe place... 
---
Destroying camps should be in survival and also allowing players to take what they earn, fight or die, too easy. 
---
But a very large and overwhelming majority that play adventure mode do not want this and have spoken. 
---
It makes 0 sense to even have a camp if it‚Äôs going to get destroyed and from a business perspective the atom store wouldn‚Äôt sell a single camp item so they wouldn‚Äôt make money there at all. 
---
Higher level trolls would literally just go around destroying camps and then what? Nothing, because they have nothing else to do....
---
So what‚Äôs the point of allowing it in adventure even from a business perspective? There isn‚Äôt any. They would lose a majority of their customer base, simple business math there. 
---
Now if you push and request it through survival... yeah, I could see it happening there without a doubt! I even agree with the OP on this. 
---
Adventure mode... no, people are tired of grievers, trolls ruining their experience. They want to interact with other players like them and it‚Äôs working out.
---
With unyeilding my agility and perception is 40
---
It should be addressed as soon as it‚Äôs mentioned.  A duplication glitch shows up and within an hour they are offline. You can‚Äôt get an instrument to work for a badge and it takes over 2 weeks.
---
Not currently, not to my knowledge. I‚Äôm hoping they release a companion app. That lets you check inventory, the atom shop, maybe even active quests
---
I dated a drunk. She used a lot of euphemisms.
---
Yes it's missing the god prefix 1+agility
---
Well you should have asked lucy to shower up 1st before eating her out.... everybody knows how musty  she gets after a rough day of uhmm.... roughing up.
---
I am now truly confused... these beasties always had unlimited ammo, I mean have you done Campfire Tales lately? I haven't seen any bloodbugs running out of spit or stingwings getting their sting dulled.
---
I still do not understand the whole " I'm playing as a raider so i need to destroy your camp".  What reference is raiding destroying camps?  I would think that would be destroyers not raiders.  Maybe ya'll should start saying "quit crying when I destroy your camp, I am playing as a true destroyer". Then we can say "Um. there were not destroyers in the previous Fallouts dude".
---
They were nerfed because comunity was crying how OP they were. Which was right. And 4k damage with bloodied melee weapon is bit OP tooo.
---
awww.... now i miss Duels back in my WOW days
---
Easy fix is to just obfuscate it :) sure the ta will have a hard time following, but it will be correct
---
F that, I'd wear the craziest shit I could find just because there's nobody left to be horrified by my lack of fashion sense
---
Can you answer why exactly you post the same comment so much? I‚Äôm legitimately curious why you‚Äôre so devoted to it.

Nice man, I have a bloodied auto rifleman too, I'm gonna remove sneak and try it out. That will give me 3 free perks on my rifle build

Yea, I discovered every single location on the entire map, and somehow am missing each "discover x amount of locations in y" Challenge for ATOM points.. as well as "learn 76 recipes", plus a bunch of others that I KNOW I should have been completed and gotten ATOM credits. 525 hours into the game should have most of those covered, but I don't think I'm ever going to see those points.
---
old thread but completely relevant. Just had my x01 duplicated!! super happy but still buggy. I had exited my x01 and then proceeded to put out my excavator and then the empty chasis so i could load some other pieces on it to get my weight down... but then it wouldnt let me set it down, so i went a little bit away on a train station roof and tried to drop my armors , anyways it showed a second set of my x01 but my empty chasis was gone, but i had two x01 suits!!!! definitely a bug in my favor haha
---
praise God :)
---
oh... and the same day i tried to give someone my 2mm ammo because i was too heavy to fast travel so i gave him my 2k of 2mm ammo. then it was too heavy for him so i tried to take some back and realized that i had 4000 2mm ammo, but sadly enough when i tried to give him a lower amount the game realized what happened so i ended up with the same ammo ultimately, but still buggy
---
1. Bloody Mess - this boots your damage across all weapons and all hits. This is useful for all builds
---
2. Crit savvy - as someone said, more crits are better than stronger crits. Plus, consider that crits always hit. So you can be a 1% hit chance and fire off that critical. So quantity beats quality here.
---
3. Four leaf clover - Again, more crits is better. But if your luck is maxed, then you are getting a crit every 2 or 3 shots anyway so this can be dropped for something else.
---
4. If they fix better criticals, then this. Otherwise you're done. Psychopath isn't worth it as it doesn't seem to trigger very often and you are only using half your crit bar with crit savvy so it's just a waste.
---
I've purchased 3* weapons from player vendors that were single star once they hit my inventory. I also saw a 3* in my inventory for sale that wasn't a 3* 
---
Is that the issue you're talking about?
---
**you have reached max affinity**
---
Nice weapon (and name) homie, 
---
I want to share a quick tip for organizing favorite gear. It works for me, thought it might help someone else. 
---
I use a renaming system that helps keep my stuff organized. (Couldn‚Äôt wait for this to get added to 76 after using it in FO4) 
---
For guns, rename with the following method. 
---
-shell: vampiric shotgun 
---
-10mm: mutant bane pistol 
---
-melee: VATS hammer  etc. 
---
The ‚Äò-‚Äò at the start of the name helps keep that item at the top of your inventory list and then you can organize by type of ammo used. 
---
For armor I use a two letter abbreviation such as -LL: for left leg, -CP for chest piece, -HG: for head gear. 
---
I find this helps me know what an item does and what it needs (ammo wise) at a glance without having to scroll over it
---
Sadly, not all unique items can be renamed this way. Hope someone finds this useful though!
---
I‚Äôve seen people blaming YouTube. Not sure why.
---
A number of us have suggested exactly this. I think it's perfectly implemented into the personal computer they just added too.
---
I like their background, but the way it was protrayed for me looked just way to simple and lazy, Minutemen or BOS gets much more weight, which is really sad because the main antagonist of the game (at least half of the game) are related to the Institute. They deserved more space in the game.
---
Lol, to be honest I havent had breakfast in years, most overrated meal of the day.
---
Yep.... 4pm here in UK. Love it üëå üòÇ
---
You spawn next to it.  If I rotate and place it just right on the edge of a cliff, you die on spawn in. Every time.  It's why I try to only fast travel to camps in PA anymore.  Too many people think it's funny to ruin your play time for a few pieces of junk.
---
If they do do this they'd have to take player vending out completely.
---
Even if you set a trap no one is going to walk in. They'll just level the place.
---
There's a main storyline? I thought it was find the mystery thief that keeps stealing your best weapons and armor. The other day he left me standing in my underwear. He even took the plans to my Enclave underarmor. What trash!
---
Smells like a voodoo :)
---
Cards you want: Nerd rage= more dmg defense when life is below 20%. Serendipity= maxed out when your life is below 30% you have a 45% chance to avoid dmg altogether. Other cards are not really bloodied build required and will fit to your style of play ie more defense or more attack ect. As for armor again it will depend what manner of attack you are primary using and whether or not this build is for pvp or general use. If it is for pvp Assassin's sentinel or Assassins Cavaliers is in my opinion the best way to go. Some people will argue for Unyielding as it boosts stats through the roof but it dosnt reduce dmg from players nor does it increase dmg you deal to players (unless you are a melee player). If it is pve then Unyielding or Bolstering depending on whether you want the stat boost or the extra defense.
---
It's alright I doubt my game play style is going anywhere there. Ill be on the lookout for nerfing and rebalancing though. We could use some of that for those legacy weapons. Damn. :)
---
I just got my third yesterday, pretty pumped, the possum badges turned out to be pretty good challange so far
---
&gt; that what turrets and traps are for 
---
Turrets and traps are worthless. Give me the turrets they have in Harper's Ferry, and we'll talk. CAMP turrets are weak as hell and *barely* stop mobs; they don't bother players at all.
---
It's always going to be inconvenient to someone somewhere in the world. Stop whining.
---
Trapper armor doesnt have variants, theres only one which is sturdy.
---
Which reinforces my point of PvP being super unbalanced
---
Agreed. I think my main issue is that there are far too many cards to begin with. I do understand being able to change builds but jesus.
---
Seriously. I have so many discovery challenges that are glitched. I want my 2 atoms! (100s really).
---
I'm French but instantly switched to EN since the "Beta", mostly because of the disgusting number of translation related bugs
---
Tips: not sure if this works for everyone but it works for me (knock on wood armor...lol)
---
I use a shielded vault suit which increases luck plus either x-cell for luck bobble head and the perk card to increase charisma when on a team... 
---
So far all I‚Äôve been getting is 3* armor and I have 2 full outfitted scout armor outfits, combat armor and marine but I also have some in my stash with no wood armor. 
---
I‚Äôve received about 3 pieces of wood so far out of about 25+ pieces, not to bad but I have a few trapper and robot as well. 
---
Again, not sure if the above set up works but I‚Äôm sticking with it until it changes.
---
That is a good idea!
---
caps are easy to get, friends arent. be a better friend
---
Bethesda username is what you display as in-game to other players. If you're able to change your username for the Bethesda launcher, it will change your IGN and your display name to other players. Seems like a silly thing to do, Bethesda. Very silly.
---
Ghoul slayers, dog
---
But real, thats all. Shoot the mobs that is spawned, shoot SBQ. Use stims to survive, revive others.
---
And just in case, let your trash in your camp.
---
YouTube video about a dupe came out 3 hours ago. Hats off beth. You fuckers are on the ball over there
---
that voice with that model .. you should start your conversations with "wanna help me get wet" or "can I get you up" ... it just may work
---
I had been on for an hour or so and my friend got on. He was excited to group up and bullshit around.  Spawned in and 5 min warning came on. Boo.
---
My favorite is the mysterious doors in the maintenance building at Whitesprings.
---
You open the door and you see a vast expanse of poorly rendered landscape. Then you close it and open it again to find a bathroom or utility room.
---
That card was actually a suggestion for PvP balancing, it would be useless for non-PvP.
---
Why doesn't your story have all the upvotes, yet? lol it was a joy to read. 
---
Please add me on live, GT: diealegend 
---
You seem like a fun person to play with and I'll be sure to help avenge this wrongdoing!
---
What's your platform and id?
---
I think the learn recipes challenge was broken for a while, and only sometime during Wild Appalachia did I finally see progress on that challenge again.
---
And yeah, the discover challenges are still bugged, even if you make a new character.
---
I'd offer him some purified water to get my boiled water back... Since BW is the only water for cooking, I'd seriously miss it.
---
At least until we get bulk water gathering and bulk water boiling.
---
So thats why they never got any of my bug reports from the sims, I was just flushing them.
---
Holy shit. Since this game came out, it has been my dream to cook chems and sell them to players. I still have several chem plans to find but yeah, I want to be the Appalachian Heisenberg.
---
Beesuit is my term for those in excavator. They're always a Honeypot of scrap.
---
I have a double shot exploding pump that I thought was cool in player vending. I haven‚Äôt been that impressed it even though it shows twice as much damage as that. It just plinks off stuff. Not sure if there is currently a glitch or not having armor penetration is hurting it that bad.
---
Think his point is that its always inconvenient to us in Europe, stop going out of your way to provoke people....
---
I do my projects at night when it's cool out and get up at 11:00 (EST) hoping to play a bit. Seems like server maintenance happens way more than other games.
---
I just knew I'd regret buying those clean water filters.
---
Yeah a roadmap of bug fixes would actually be great.
---
...if only there were some sort of bethesda community manager that could take suggestions for this sort of thing....
---
I use the enforcer perk, at level three any shotgun will get your target crippled in seconds. In nuked Whitesprings you can get one of those big groups of Glowing Ones immobilized in very short order, get out the ol' super sledge and smash away.
---
I got a pretty breast Bone Club once, a weapon i've never seen anywhere else in-game.  Bloodied + Power Attack + END.  Perfect for a brute build/roleplay, sold fast.
---
To be fair, they could "raid" a camp. But at this point all of the "raiders" are too busy whining to even bother raiding anything...
---
So I was wondering this since I have a TSE handmade but during free range, I lit up a Yoa Gui who was mauling to lower level melee guys. Didn't harm them one bit or flag me as hostile.
---
It‚Äôs a red dog house with a skeleton laying on top on his back, a bird house on a nearby tree, and little teddy bears inside the dog house.
---
I kill, loot, and photograph everything these days in hopes it's a challenge and just randomly drop bags of crap to lighten my load.
---
In real life, I can shoot you in the face and you'll die. In game, you're running fifteen different legendary synergies that basically make you do god-level damage while taking none, no matter how many times I shoot you in the face. False equivalency is false.
---
To solve griefing with it is easy.  Make the spawn in a foundation piece that cannot interact with any other piece.  Means it must be on solid ground, you spawn on a big solid square, and they cant put switches or tripwires on it.  It also should spawn first before any other piece but would be quick cause it's just a colored cube essentially.
---
I've had really good luck with White Springs, not nuked. Potentially 4-6 legendaries per run.
---
Absolutely, bro.
---
I bought it for 5k @ a players vendor,he also only had one
---
I dont know where to find them but I suspect 1000 caps isnt enough, if you just want the armour I think you can find some in a train car near Morgan town station
---
true, A first step would be allowing us to tag cards, so they appeared first, that would make it easier to swap them in and out.
---
Agree. Good luck with that responder's firefighter outfit.
---
for anyone still leveling a character, finding cheap stims is a god send. i dont have the 2 perks that let me craft insane amounts of them and i dont have the stimpack recipe yet so i'm constantly out of stims and its hard finding vendors with cheap ones
---
I used arround 1800 atoms for free, still is pretty obvious most part of the atom rewards are something you will get a single time, at least they could allow to re-earn them with other character (which would help also replaying teh game) but instead once you buy a couple of things you willl be based on events and diary shit to get a dumb amount of atoms... probably the reason the worst skins were the first released, where most people spended those first atoms.
---
The system seem to be designed so people could say in forums "I did get 2000 atoms just playing the first week" but then noticing that on one month the chances to get a decent skin will require you to focus only on dull and repetitive tasks.
---
Where were you when this popped up?
---
I have weekdays off so I always get the shaft.
---
Now I get to grab some popcorn üçø and see what people are complaining about today üò¨
---
thing you seem to forget is, f03/fo4, didn't have 30 odd other humans in it. Thats 30 odd real poeple.
---
those on survival servers have, by definition, given their permission for you to do this.
---
Those on adventure have NOT. Most want to play fallout, and JUST,  fallout.
---
simples.
---
nothing in this game is as bad as another human being
---
Just go with the flow..u will develop a system we farm her sometimes 5 times a day lol
---
&lt;tugs on sleeve&gt; Sorry to pester, I‚Äôve already let the dev team know so I‚Äôm not going to ask you if it‚Äôll get fixed. But I just wanted to know if you had personally heard about a glitch that currently prevents a small number of players from completing Operation Tidy?
---
My wife and I have a similar setup for going after the Imposter.
---
Wife has full set of Troubleshooters and a Troubleshooter's DCG. These are just a mish-mash of 1-3* armor. The DCG is 1*. She tanks all pylons and runs around destroying Gutsies while I work on the Impostor with my Bloodied Build.
---
I actually resorted to using Phantom Devices during this fight to improve my survivability and they work rather well. The last fight we took down the Impostor before my first Phantom Device wore off (so about 2-3 minutes from when the pylons are usable).
---
I saw on this subreddit that Tick's Blood Tequila heals based on damage done so along with Blocker and your Troubleshooter's armor, you could probably faceroll everything the Impostor has while taking all 3 pylons.
---
Oh you're right, I misread what the wiki said. Welp that makes my job a whole lot easier.
---
Any chance you know if a pioneer scouts backpack would cover it up? I'm a fan of how the armor looks and want to use it on a stealth build so its stats don't matter as much. I really don't like that backpack though
---
One little thing tho, to be clear : while guessing the objectives  is impossible, the objectives themselves still clear like normal (except the ones that are bugged...).
---
For example even after getting my objectives all bugged, walking in all the Appalachia railroad stations and tootign the horn of the loco in Harper's ferry checked me the objectives for the Railroad enthusiasts. Same for taking the tadpole visit in Robco's factory.
---
So while it's currently impossible to see the objectives, most of them can still be achieved.
---
I‚Äôd throw in fireproof as well or you get tore up by scorchbeasts sonic scream.
---
This
---
Whitesprings is always good for a few
---
Clubhouse. parking area / maintenance building / 2 story house by the gate w/ a Glowing One upstairs...
---
easily 3-5 legendaries
---
And my neighbor looks like a clown regardless whether it be Halloween or not. So majority of her age group would look like clowns anyway.
---
Do I miss announcements about these? I'm always caught off guard, and what time I do get to play appears to be during prime maintenance time.
---
Wasn't it all you had to do was give them one round of the ammo type and they had unlimited ammo?
---
I got a chest and one leg and one arm lol. If i could get my other arm covered id feel better.
---
Ill check out that spot when the servers are back. Thx.
---
It's weird how an America-based company will do maintenance during their business hours. Huh. Unheard of. It's just like they're... real people. With lives.
---
/s
---
Wtf lol
---
The longer the server maintenance the cleaner my carpet becomes
---
Np.With unyilding my perception and agility is 40
---
Waterpark is the easiest place to check as you spawn like 10 steps from the dead tourist. 
---
I got mine after 5 server hops
---
If you have crap weapons go 2 star.  If you want to sell weapons go 2 star.   If you have good weapons and vendoing machine and caps maxed.  Go three stars.
---
For armor always 3 star.  So much value in the armors minor that it makes zero sense doing 2 star.
---
Or a legendary *Armor and *Weapons category on the menu.
---
yeah, i get that the game desperately needed content, but bugs and stability should still have the utmost priority.
---
" double check your perks, nothing worse than realizing you left on super  duper or you forgot to put Gunsmith back on and now your stuff is  broken. " 
---
Yea i forget to take of SD every freaking time ;)
---
Oh and if you got 3 available slots in Charisma, Tenderizer is always nice to have on at the queen
---
I guess the issue is that I already had all of the standard recipes learned before they fixed the challenge (5-6 months after the release of the game). I'll have to keep playing, and learn recipes from all of the DLC's as well, then hope that there will be enough.
---
Ah. Have not found that yet.
---
I have found a dog house matching my description above though... can't figure out what it's an easter egg for. Unless it's "Mr. Peabody".
---
But, most likely, it obvious, and my lack of modern pop culture knowledge is showing.
---
No you're not an evil player - just a pathetic human in real life probably.  Anyone that enjoys destroying things when it serves no purpose is just plain sadistic, not sure what else I can say about that.  You can't enjoy role playing a sadist unless you are such a person yourself.
---
Sighs - even though its a game, people forget how they reflect their own humanity and project it in the game.
---
1K scrip cap. Gotta either spend down to turn in more legendaries or burn camp storage in the hopes that it will be fixed "Soon" (TM).
---
Even just a star next to the weapons and armor category would be enough
---
Serious, emergency maitenance because of dupers? You mean I could of woke up this morning and started playing if some dick bag wasnt qasting all his time trying to break the game rather then play it good grief...
---
Yes, never ask for a change on a game you enjoy with a good community.... mostly good...
---
Up your butt goes to EA.
---
Down the toilet goes to Activision.
---
It was in the patch notes last week so I think it is fixed.
---
Bee thesda
---
Well fuck, I'd rather the fix a game breaking exploit first before they ruin the economy with dupes again over a fucking badge for the scouts.
---
The key in this build is sneak and serenpidity perks get those first
---
The wolf horde event drops 3 (at least for me) every time. 
---
WS is a good place even when it‚Äôs not nuked!
---
I think I'll go with Bloodfeast  the Extreme-inator
---
Damnit, well back to grinding
---
Nah mate. They patched that already.
---
camden vendor. be listed as raider.
---
No. Patched.
---
Except I think they should re-evaluate the damage and health levels in the game, I'd be fine without legendaries if we were always effectively at 30% health and bloodied level damage.
---
For me, bloodied plays right, and I just mean the weapons, unyielding armor etc could all go
---
I can't stand it when it takes an entire magazine or more to kill something.
---
Theres also I think I set in the nika cola bottling plant, theres a door in the middle of the two towers that will take you right close to the armor, last time I went there I think it was t60 though
---
I was talking to a Bethesda community manager and he mentioned a project they might be working on called "towns." He said it will resemble player guilds, clans or factions but he doesn't have a lot of details.
---
one violent night, uranium fever, lucky hole mine, encrypted event, free range, leader of the pack, the bot one(forget the name), any horde event, census violence, the watoga high school one and the arkos pharma event
---
for places whitesprings golf club, the burrows, tanagra town, west tek research and watoga
---
True. But they have had time to fix the bugs.   That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying.  Duping glitches need to be fixed right away.  I agree.  But also, just maybe, fix the other shit that‚Äôs broke
---
My dogs also loves maintances.
---
Another friendly reminder is action boy and Nerd Rage/Lone Wander don‚Äôt stack.  I tend to run Lone Wander for the mitigation and bonus AP and Nerd Rage.  That frees up some more points as well.  That an unyielding builds have like 400 AP so it‚Äôs not as crucial.
---
You know you want it, lol
---
Do you know what all the current requirements are?  I cant seem to get the Tame button to appear
---
sorry for your loss :-/
---
...have you just tried, not dying though? /s
---
Unyielding.  Use Nerd Rage/Serendipity. Stand in a river and eat up the rads. Watch your stats in pip boy, they will go max once Nerd Rage turns on. 
---
Find sweet spot between low health (stat bonus 2 or 3) and HP
---
Haha no Lucy for me. I prefer the taste of hearty Brotherhood flesh over punani any day.
---
Now that would be mega cool. Hope to hear something about it in the future.
---
To add to this, if you do a full run without any legendaries, just server hop. It happens quite often these days since patch 9.
---
Ok, thanks for the responses guys, I guess I'll change my perks around to better suit solo-play!
---
Well, there's lots of open issues that deserve a hotfix -- most notably the localization problems many folks are experiencing. But yes, the only thing they seem to panic over is duping issues.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought, I‚Äôm pretty sure I was doing this before they released console mods
---
There's really not much point rolling 2 stars, the 1st and 3rd effects are the best (and the rad resist effect is bugged and rarely adds any resistance).
---
Believe it or not, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúbreakfast‚Äù that starts a great day for your insides, it‚Äôs what ever you eat and drink first that can set your system up to be better or worse... some foods are harder on the digestive system while others are easier and will get the gears moving. (Yeah, has to write a paper on this...lol)
---
What I say its that I had like 2 or 3 days My PC on... surely the Bethesda Launcher was not appearing there, not only under my windows account, but looking all PC proceses and the bethesda launcher was not in there...
---
Then suddenly the mesage of the update appeared, when it was supposed to be opened.... It said "update was installed" I guess and asked for restart... so I hit "cancel" (the restart) and looked again for the process in the task manager, that still didnt appear there.
---
So I dont know why the hell or even how.... unless it gets "camoufled" randomlly as other kind of process that cannot just be identified easilly... And I dont think Bethesda launcher would be "integrated" with any windows process like could happen with the Microsoft Store.
---
It got nerfed but it also depends on your perks.  Demolition Expert for the explosive part, shotgun perks for the rest.
---
TBH even with perks maxed out, explosive shotguns aren't that great now.  I've got a Furious +limb damage that usually does better than my Explosive ones.
---
I always find a lot in Abandoned Bog towns work shop
---
*Rooty Tooty Point N Shooty*  would like a word with you
---
Is there really even any debate here? If you have a PC capable of playing 76, play on PC man. Mods. There aren't a ton, but the ones that are there add a huge amount of quality of life, like being able to swap perk sets with 1 key press.
---
I had an instigating dragon with faster reload in my shop for 2500... 20 plus hours of play over a week and nobody wanted it... scripped it.
---
Nobody appreciates the way of the dragon!!
---
Lol does your dog hate 76 as much as my cat? My cat especially hates when I build a camp. She never knows how long I be "gone"
---
They're a US based company performing maintenance during regular business hours. Seriously.
---
The bridge by Flatwoods always has a set of Raider armor behind a locked door. Once you've obtained the key from the opposite side of the bridge it becomes relatively easy to just server hop that spot till you collect all the pieces.
---
There's disconnects, and then there's crashes. The game is crashing harder for me (on PS4) since the last update: before, it would just bluescreen, take a few seconds, and then I could restart the game. Now? It bluescreens, freezes **while looking up the error**, sit there unresponsive for a few **minutes**, and then finally allow me to restart my console, but that also takes two minutes or more. 
---
I only get that once per ‚Äìsay‚Äì every eight hours of gameplay, but it's just annoying as hell.
---
Yep - I have a lever action BE rifle.  Just no third effect.
---
afaik it's 20 hours, same as other spawns around the world and vendor caps.
---
How do you re-name weapons?
---
Come to my camp on PC and buy them for 1c each, I have 9K currently in stock.
---
I suggest using symbols.  they appear before letters on the list, and work well for making subgroups
---
thats why I do anyway.
---
For a ranged build, bolstering if you don‚Äôt plan on being stealthy or using VATS. Unyielding if you plan on stealth or VATS. 
---
Adrenal reaction mutation.
---
Nerd rage perk for extra damage.
---
Good survival perks are Blocker (melee hits are some of the big damage sources; knocking those down by 45% is important when you only have 40-50 health) and Serendipity. Dodgy is much more situational, but still potentially valuable, and I wouldn‚Äôt bother with ironclad or evasive, personally. 
---
Lone wanderer is great if you play solo, useless if you don‚Äôt.
---
There's no need for PVP balancing after the last nerf to cavalier/sentinel/assassin's armor. Everyone is killable these days.
---
I do things like 'my sniper rifle and 'my automatic gun.
---
Works for me.
---
I saw in reddit there is a video on 'tube about a new dupe method. 
---
But, on the positive side, it is now known and being fixed.
---
Without that video, a new dupeing wave occured...
---
That location will never be a raider set.
---
Owners spawn at a different place to visitors. :)
---
&gt;*feels pity in EST*...^(but not enough to want maintenance times to change)
---
my quad explosive double barrel is also named Boomstick =)
---
Literally dozens of players post here on this very subject which would give you a 100% better chance than to go into a random camp and asking... 
---
Ask with a post here and I‚Äôm sure someone is doing it.
---
Enemy attacks are very different than player attacks. There‚Äôs nothing personal about those. When it‚Äôs a player, you know that another person has decided that the thing you put time and energy into creating is worth nothing more than 30-60 seconds of destruction. 
---
Getting your CAMP destroyed by another player just feels shitty. It isn‚Äôt fun. This is why so many people dislike it and why Bethesda changed it. Games are supposed to be fun for all the players. If a mechanic is decidedly not fun‚Äîor only fun for some, at the expense of others‚Äîit shouldn‚Äôt exist. 
---
Find a way to make CAMP destruction fun for both sides and we can talk. As long as it‚Äôs people destroying things just for kicks, get lost.
---
I have that one, it does over 500 damage and if I don't use vats it needs 4 or more shots to kill a scorched. I don't understand.
---
There‚Äôs no reason they can‚Äôt keep some up so other countries aren‚Äôt fucked over.
---
It LOGICALLY doesn't make sense. Imagine you're in a survival situation and you finally saw another person that you spent 25 years of your life with. You'd be thrilled and relieved.
---
Being a Raider in this game is for the lowest of the low. It's the same thing in real life as far as I'm concerned. Think about the bad things other people have done to you in your life. How that made you feel. You really want to be responsible for making other's feel that feeling. 
---
You're a coward and let's be honest here. Completely honest, without the worry of another persons reaction. The world would kind of be a better place without people like that. 
---
I hate mean people which means I hate mean people in video games. It's not like Halo where there's a sense of sportsmanship at the end of the day, You folks are just cancer.
---
You do get meaningful loot from safes, especially plans. Entire areas are locked behind doors. The point was more that he should keep 3 points in perception to be able to when needed, and to use glowsight when it isnt.
---
yeah sometimes follow the compass or look for the point in map you are interested, related to any mission can be a pain in the ass, specially when a lot of times some events or diary task "gets activated" by itself which at the end forces me to only track a single thing each time (and removing all those auto-activated tasks)

I'm sure it's just RNG, and to be honest, the best drop I had was from a 3*** roll (instigating/explosive/90% reduced weight harpoon gun) but what makes actual sense is using the scrip for 2** rolls and getting more rolls thus (theoretically) increasing your odds at a better roll. Like I said though, probably just random and it really doesn't matter what you do lol
---
They love the game. The younger one barked a deathclaw when it jumped on me...
---
The older one sleeps under the PC table, his head rest on my feet.
---
Just a word of caution - some vendors have their mule characters doing the vending.  The player's level may not be representative of their wares.
---
It‚Äôs not the smartest build.  Pretty well maxed strength and perception with rifle and shotgun perks.  Flameproof, enforcer, covert op, demo expert, and the mutation luck perks.
---
That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs still in development or beta phase. They say it‚Äôs released, but its state says otherwise.
---
Actually I am not seeing a lot of support here. And with the unlimited number of bugs I do not blame them. It is a fun game until the "BuG" attack. Then it becomes one of the most frustrating games I have ever played.
---
If you kill a legendary mob and do find a legendary reward revisit the body 20 seconds or so later and its there.  
---
Now if they would just fix the bug where non-legendary mobs drop legendary items.  /s
---
Can you hug us, instead of spreading democracy? We are just sad.....  Americans......
---
Does it give the game a new engine?
---
Just slip on a cosmetic outfit. Sadly there‚Äôs no other way. I went through the same thing.
---
I used palidan dance until they tried to make me kill him ):&lt; I didn't do I though
---
That‚Äôs a very good point. I got a couple of pieces with the ‚Äúless fall damage‚Äù and now I just around jumping off of the highest places I can find. :)
---
I have found that she sticks in groups. Doing some experimenting with scrip, if you buy several in one session there tends to be a trend. such as  
---
Hunters/x/x  
---
Hunters/x/y  
---
Hunters/y/x  
---
So if I get something I do not want, I server hop before I try again. This at least randomizes it better. For me, at least.
---
3 hours ago a dupe method came out and im pretty sure bethesda is subbed to the guy to remove dupe methods as fast as possible lmao
---
2-4hours. Hotfix may be one hour.
---
Yes, I do, need to download and check it. But still, don't you think it should be in the game already?
---
Corporate sabotage between competing honey producers!
---
I competed the 76 recipes deal but still keep discovering more recipes every week like this week was a Bunless cram burger üçî...
---
Right, but there‚Äôs no reason they can‚Äôt hold off so other countries aren‚Äôt fucked over and regardless, op‚Äôs post was more of a PSA than anything else. There were two words in the post, not counting the title. That doesn‚Äôt count as whining.
---
1 or 2 pieces of bolstering armor help too, along with DR backpack.
---
Took me ages to realise the outfit was called trappers something or other. Thought it had bugged.
---
Camden is responders. Top of the world, r&amp;g station, sutton and sunnytop I believe are the raider ones. 
---
Top of world resort vendor has raider mod plans.
---
This happened to me today. Thought I had somehow chosen the option to stay on the same world thus forcing me to relocate my camp. Took about a solid minute to swap someone else‚Äôs camp with my camp. In almost 800 hours of playing the game I had never experienced that before.
---
Ill be playing later today. But i just gotta get some ammo and i should be able to run you through a nuke run.
---
What level are you?
---
Well, only a few 3* effect worth it. Like a reduced VATS cost for a sniper.
---
Or reduced weight for a heavy.
---
They are situational.
---
i hope this is fixed soon. there are multiple bugs in game that are ignored and actually DO break aspects of the game and its awful. Also it's really terrible that instead of recognizing them and trying to get ALL of the game working for ALL of the customers that people would rather down vote it on reddit.
---
To be fair, beer is the closest thing we have to time traveling.
---
Definitely be mad at the cheaters, but it's hard to fault Bethesda for doing something about it ASAP.  I'd gladly give up play time for them to put a stop to duping (and I have, elsewhere).
---
Wanted doesn‚Äôt allow YOU free reign. It gives OTHERS free reign to kill *you*
---
Maybe if there was more buzz about it we could have one.  Right now it just stings not to have one.
---
BR√òTHER
---
Topic creator sounds like hes 10 years old with a mind set like that
---
For plastic, super mutants are a good option. Scrapping laser rifles with the Scrapper perk yields 8-12 plastic per depending on your int level. Assuming you can clear west tek quickly (takes me 5-8 minutes usually), that's a good 100 plastic or so per run, along with 400-500 steel and some rubber and other stuff.
---
Lead is a pain in the ass. the best way to farm lead would be Lucky Hole mine but that requires a lot of acid - also a pain to farm. I hit up the silos (there's a gym in each with 50-100 lead or so), flatwoods gym, and the exercise yard at the Penitentary (you can finally pick up the weights there). But honestly for how much lead i go through, that isn't enough. I buy it in bulk for 2c per lead scrap.
---
and melee has been broken for everyone in all regions for over a month now
---
I really am surprised that one wasn't immediately hotfixed, assuming of course that they have a fix for it already.
---
Or fill some troughs.
---
Nice one I'll try this üëå
---
Yep, you should never do anything to someone they don't like. Especially in a virtual world.
---
Considering they are hot fixing a new exploit, just no.
---
To add to this, I suggest using multiple symbols.  they will all be at the top of the list, but it separates them into subgroups.
---
For example, I use * for my mainstay weapons, $ for stuff to sell, + for things I'm just testing out, and = for things to move to another character.   keeps them well grouped, and theres still enough space for fun or descriptive names. ie " *Ghoul Slaying Axe "
---
Citizen Snips üòÇ
---
And you perk with Enforcer 3 and Adrenaline 5 and it does quite a bit of damage.  
---
Yes they nerfed the explosive feature on shotguns but JFC but current dmg rating on my combat AAE is still very good (300) and that‚Äôs without chems or the adrenaline perk activated.  
---
The stagger piece works pretty well against all the major critters including deathclaws and scorchbeasts when grounded.
---
How is it unbalanced? Anyone can be killed after the cavalier/sentinel/assassin's nerf.
---
Y‚Äôall gonna finally fix the challenges like discover x location or the overseers one? Hasn‚Äôt been addressed since.....well since the game came out. A lot of us are missing out on tons of atoms and can‚Äôt do anything about it.
---
Y‚Äôall also gonna fix melee that can‚Äôt vats on flying enemies or barely registers hits?
---
My guess is no....
---
I haven't died fast traveling to anyones camp yet, I got stuck a few times though.
---
Go to the Top or the World, there‚Äôs a set that always spawns there. Server hop it a few times to get the full set
---
Unless you're able to run and hide, changing loadouts isn't going to work mid combat. Besides, the preset loadouts aren't all for combat. Most only have one combat build they like and the other loadouts are for repairing, lockpicking, hacking, crafting, scrapping, or buying/selling. 
---
And if a player did have multiple combat loadouts, they'd only be able to switch fast enough on PC I bet. I'm sure that console load times for bringing up the perk menu are longer. But still, unless the enemy doesnt know where you currently are, you're just a sitting duck and can easily be killed while switching.
---
In general dopey, not when it comes to exploits. Though, there should not be any exploits to begin with. They should be testing their patches before making them live.
---
I like the idea, but the game engine just isn't made for that kind of thing.
---
Let me share this link about how Bethesda implemented the train in Fallout 3:
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/heres-whats-happening-inside-fallout-3s-metro-train/
---
Too true. Sounds like they got dealt with by ‚Äúbig iron on his hip‚Äù.  But yeah they could. But their so scattered they couldn‚Äôt raid a twitch stream.
---
couldn't agree more dude
---
if you are on XB1, its RS &gt; Select (or select, from what ever view screen youre in)
---
I'm pretty sure I gave everyone in Sanctuary a mingun and a single round.
---
*raises plastic sheets *
---
Gt: Hooded Dementer on most nights level 80 odd
---
there's still a lot of things i hope to see fixed in near future :/
---
I've found that Enclave under armor clips through a bunch of stuff.  For a while I was rocking the Bomber Jacket look and I had to switch to BoS underarmor because the enclave armor kept clipping through.
---
I was definitely not aware of that one either. Do you mind posting your rifle build?
---
Nope, nerfed. It's great as a drink though.
---
Preach!
---
Not an evil player? What purpose does destroying someone‚Äôs camp serve? Raiders raided to steal supplies. You can‚Äôt do that from someone‚Äôs camp in 76, so that‚Äôs not a raider thing.
---
The only purpose destroying a camp serves in ‚Äò76 is to hurt someone psychologically.
---
Tell me that isn‚Äôt evil.
---
They best be fixing these broken badge challenges too. Maybe even the challenges that released with the game. I hope..
---
Can't get exact number now with servers offline.  My agility is high 20s.
---
This is excellent
---
I‚Äôm saying fuck
---
Seems to be a trend from every game company as of late.
---
An understandable one, but once the exploits are fixed the bugs should be taken care of next, instead of waiting a month for another exploit and fixing that.
---
Combination of pvp in workshop and being on a team that is caught up in it ?! Allows the other team to hit the base and other members. 
---
Bethesda really need to add a hud warning so we know that we're in pvp... even if we don't know why!!
---
You can also buy ammo from them but not sell it to them.
---
PSA: this no longer works with the queen as of patch 9.5. Just a heads up.
---
No. What you saw was probably unstable raw flux (that you can sell) that degraded to inert
---
That song from Godsmack is pretty. I‚Äôm not the one who‚Äôs so far away, when I feel I the snake bit Enter my vain.
---
Yes there is, it can be difficult to find a fight in Survival. Half the time I chase down the 1, 2 and 3 to find they are below level 50. We need faction based PVP that makes it easier to find a fight.
---
As soon as the severs come back online I'll gladly help out. Psn is Fromager1nMN im level 135 but am mostly melee. I think codes are still good and I have plently of keycards.
---
Missed your posts, glad you are back!
---
With the back pack you can swap out pocketed legs for custom fitted and run across the map in like 10 bars or so lol.
---
Someone probably sold flora, and then it turned into flux. I use it for water.
---
I experienced it as well. Could't even start the mission -.-
---
I join when i see it. Im lvl 20 so admittedly im not a ton of help... But i bring lots of stims to get ppl up.
---
Well stated!
---
Yes that‚Äôs exactly my finding too, not the effects but the items though, like a nocturnal broadsider then followed by a hunter‚Äôs broadsider. This has happened four time already, two identical items in a row just different prefixes.
---
&gt; Actually, I have done programming. And even a basic program will still pull up bugs all over, and even after countless hours of testing you will still miss bugs that your users will find. It's something anyone with any programming knowledge knows.
---
I've been developing software for over a decade. And you avoided my question. 
---
You asked (or implied the question) if I had made any games like this, and I asked you the same to point out that neither of us have so it's a moot point. If anything, I'd say I know more than you as I probably have more experience and have actually _tried_ to make games multiple times over the years. I know how hard it is, yet I don't make excuses for Bethesda. Why are you? I know they can and should be doing better.
---
&gt;Shit, look at this game compared to Fallout 4.
---
I am. I noticed they had the same bugs in FO76 as they did in FO4. That's one of my main sticking points.
---
Problem is, the game crashed before I could even turn around, because of course it did.  This is also the first time I rolled an assaultron head, so I knew it would lose something, but wasn't sure which one. Sucks that it's the friggin prefix.
---
Great idea thanks
---
Well for the people who don't mindlessly server hop over and over it is a very rare jacket, it took me 150 levels before I got mine.  It's also super rare to the people who don't live on marketplace sites.
---
Right now it's the only outfit I think that actually looks good in the game. I don't really give a hoot about other outfits.
---
You're lucky.  I haven't died but I've fallen off a few cliffs on spawn in.  Again, it's why I use PA to shop.
---
Please!
---
They work fine for me but I only use them as sale items on my vending machine.
---
With all the in world boxes that players can interact with, exploits will happen. And continue to happen with people existing in this world that thrive on breaking games to exploit them. 
---
Furthermore this engine was never designed to be a multiplayer system and as such exploits will continue no matter how well they think they did at preventing it. Hell they left the dev room in the game, like all other Fallouts before because that's how little experience they have at making multiplayer games. Complaining isn't going to help any while a gaming company learns what it's like to maintain their first MMO.
---
You get them from doing Stings and Things and the one where you clean up the waste. Part of the pioneer scout quests
---
I heard the kellogs corporation started all that bullshit about breakfast being the most important meal of the day to help increase cereal sales. It's all big breakfast propaganda.
---
I always rock ghoulish3 in nuke zones, but it's become pretty common for people to draw the queen out of the rad storm to kill her, so your perk loadout for SBQ can vary somewhat depending on how the battle goes. Be prepared to swap perks on the go.
---
As an earlier poster said, people are locked to where you first put the camp down.  But you can move the camp machine around your chosen location without changing the area boundries.  Why not just keep it locked to the camp machine instead of the original location?
---
Survival needs to let us break turrets without attacking the owner first. It's total bullshit those turrets will kill us without us being able to disable them.
---
That is bad, but it's an interesting hint at future content. Anyway, I'm so glad I've been playing the game in English since the beginning (because I just hate the way **everything** (including location names) gets translated into German, and you cannot communicate about specific weapons, quests, or materials you need with the majority of other players if you don't know the English names for anything), but of course this bug is just ridiculous.
---
What I would like to ask, though, are you sure the Possum quests are bugged, and that this is not just a visual bug? Doesn't the server record any progress you make towards the badges, even if it just displays gibberish? Or are they all 0/8 or whatever after you change to English?
---
If you don't run mods then delete the \[Archive\] section in the Fallout76Custom.ini which is in This PC/Documents/My Games/Fallout76.
---
The "falling through the world" was caused by not having the updated sResouceArchive2List
---
It sound like you had a mod at sometime.
---
Just had a thought, did you every have "Ratmonkeys easy sorting and tagging? If so delete the "strings" directory in the Fallout 76 data directory
---
I price my stuff at yard sale prices. I figure  sell more stuff cheap than one or two for a higher price.
---
Nice try Bethesda but we won‚Äôt tell you where to nerf next ü§ê
---
I have tried forever to tame a cat. I can always pacify them, but never send them to my camp. My charisma is only at 5, maybe this is why.
---
Is...this?
---
Months later and you assholes still make your way out of the wood work
---
&gt;But at my company, the build team would get fired if they continued to create more content over user experience. (Which I realize is most times a different team)
---
I get the feeling that its the finance department or senior executives just hand waving any user experience concerns from the devs and pushing as hard as they can for more content/microtransactions. I also get the feeling that the dev team is severely understaffed/budgeted.
---
Problem is they keep inadvertently adding or bringing back these exploits.
---
One step forward, like 5 backwards is how its feels.
---
Bullet sponges are definitely a problem. But that is a more widespread problem with the idea of hit points vs damage in RPGs as a whole.
---
Definitely not a base spawn. I don‚Äôt think any mob is a base spawn except The Mothman, who I believe can just spawn on your original CAMP unit placement. 
---
Other than that, I don‚Äôt think any mobs spawn specially for camps. I say this because my base has never been attacked ever, but I have seen Mothmen spawn in CAMPs where no mob really should be spawning.
---
Whew fuck....how?
---
it is a visual bug. but what difference does it make to those that speak absolutely no english? or struggle to understand or read proper english?  it just needs a fix, no matter what imo.
---
I never have the launcher running, unless it's Patch-Day. I'm used to entering a password every time. &lt;shrug&gt;
---
Yesterday I found a set at the Treetops place (that spawns Anglers) over in the Mire.
---
Well it wasn't a full set. Had Helmet and two other pieces i think.
---
Would you rather have exploits go unpatched for a long time?  You know like the dupe bug from Nov to January that destroyed the economy and causes TSE to be nerfed.
---
Smart business move would be to apply maintenance at the exact moment all the servers were at the minimum amount of traffic. Not at a predetermined time. Just saying.....
---
:(
---
&gt; the solution is more programmers if the current turnaround time on critical patches is over a week.
---
Not necessarily. There is such a thing as 'too many cooks in the kitchen'. At some point, they need to start taking a holistic look at their development process and try to figure out how to work smarter and not harder. Maybe it's more automated testing tools, maybe it's a better QA department. 
---
My biggest concern was when they released a patch and _regressed_ certain fixes. I forget the details, but it was complained about in this sub. They re-broke things they had fixed. How does that happen besides gross negligence?
---
Considering that everybody's dead by the time we came out of Vault 76 (hence no NPC) and only holos and items remain of post war factions, I doubt Beth will enable an ingame guild system
---
It definitely is
---
Understood. It just seemed odd that it would be sold if it hadn't been provided to the vendor by a player.
---
There's always a raider set spawns in the center of the coaster at camden
---
The comunity cried because everyone had one... if they were rare enough there would have not been soo much outcry... I never did 4K damage, 2.5K yes... but I take one hit and I die... how is that OP? I cant even kill a player with TSE Handmade... they tore me to shreads with their high rate of fire.... destroy my Serependy...
---
Damn! You were able to tame a deathclaw with only 3 charisma?
---
4 unyielding pieces and serums.
---
Makes sense.
---
Than you have to eliminate the ability to lock and own resources at workshops. People would log on and just farm fusion cores and ammo all day without any reason to move. At least this way I can decide if it's worth the fight to control a resource point or not
---
What's wrong with better crits perk card?
---
I sell serums exclusively. It's actually categorized as a misc. item. Chems are chems, and stimpaks is its own category.
---
Just move. You're obviously camped at a spawn point, not the other way around.
---
I'm fine with loadouts for repairing, lockpicking and shit like that. It would even be alright to have other combat loadouts. I am all for it, if you can't change loadouts while in combat.
---
STOP POSTING THIS HERE FOR THE KARMA, AND POST IT ON BETHESDAS FORUM.
---
I know I'd love another double XP weekend as well.
---
Agreed. The other thing of course is that there will always be something to complain about.
---
If they add content but leave bugs, people will be pissed they didn‚Äôt patch.
---
If they fix bugs and not add content, people will be pissed there is nothing new.
---
Of course, the best idea would be to do *both* of these things, but no developer ever does so it must be too hard :/
---
Everybody's shopping at player's vending machines lately, that don't bring no xp.
---
Haha well that's good. Maybe it's a game for dogs but not so much cats
---
Roger that. I always sell the mentas chem because I never knew what it could be  used for. I loot top of the  world quite often also easy 60+ plastic.  Thanks for the tips. Off to the cave I go!
---
It is.
---
Yes please.
---
I dont know, that's a good question. I know Beth said that any costumes that have built in backpacks will make the scout one invisible, but not sure about armor.
---
So what you seem to be saying is: "They knowingly left an exploit on live servers overnight because they all went home rather than staying late to fix it"  
---
They've presumably left it on live for \~16h or more than they needed to rather than fixing it yesterday before everyone went home.   
---
I'm glad they're fixing it, I'm only mildly put out I can't play for an hour or two, but let's not pretend the fact it was an exploit necessitated the timing as an emergency. If it could wait until 8am PST having been discovered and scheduled for patching at least the day before (if not earlier, to allow coding and QA for the patch), it obviously wasn't THAT imperative
---
And what are people like in real life that constantly call for bans, nerfs and protections in a GAME? Lol.
---
Feeble minded, entitlement complex, pampered, privileged? 
---
We could go on forever with these comparisons, but in no way do I believe that someone blowing your camp up has some equivalence with sadism and evil lol.
---
camdem holds raider power armour plans/ mods.
---
camden park will spawn a chassis with raider parts on it.
---
Might be random, but for me,they are always there.
---
while were on the subject. full set, level 45,from raiders quest line.
---
going a begging.  looking for somewhere to dump it, that someone will actually want it.
---
vault 76 - no good they cant wear it.
---
TSE needed a nerf dupes or no dupes.
---
Get the wooden one. The scout one has a visual problem with the hammer being on the twice.  One in the cocked and one not. 
---
The blue barrel on the wooden is common for show guns. Makes it feel classy. Also gives off an old world vibe. 
---
Plus depending on the gun and manufacturer they may dye the barrel or parts when shipping and remove it when selling. Solely for protecting the gun when shipping.  
---
I have both skins. Go with the wooden.
---
I dont think there was an annoucement
---
&gt; Wow, had no idea about this, that‚Äôs really poor effort from Bethesda, they ought to be ashamed that so many big issues still remain.
---
Fo76 in a nutshell.
---
I know right, especially the 90% weight reduction. My three star railway rifle will weigh like a train station without it.
---
The YouTube video showing the exploit was posted like 3 hours ago.. they got to it pretty quickly this time...
---
The mid levels in this game are a special hell. As you branch out of the forest you'll occasionally find higher level enemies spawned by higher level players. 3 times I've found myself grinding the forest or other lower level areas for longer than I should. Fighting enemies above your level until you reach level 35 or 40 can be a crippling drain on your resources.
---
I would avoid several enemies unless you out level them by 5+. Gutsys, assaultrons, super mutants, gulpers, cave crickets, and others are poorly level scaled. They take an excessive amount of resources to fight compared to ghouls, scorched, wolves, etc. 
---
At one point I had almost completely depleted my resources after stumbling across a wendigo 20 levels above me in the midst of a group of ghouls of my level. I retreated to the forest to replenish my resources until my team was online.
---
Good luck and keep grinding. Maybe you'll find someone higher level who can help your grind a bit.
---
Gotta get that faster swing speed and +1 strent
---
&gt; after hour server hoping to kill one fucking cave cricket at unncany cavers, with no luck
---
Ha, same here, couldn't get the fvckers to spawn. Server-hop challenges have to go, Bethesda. They can't be good for server performance, anyway.
---
I had 3-4 absolute shit rolls (gamma gun, weapons I don‚Äôt use with crap bonuses) but my last few have been really good.
---
It gets better.
---
I mean sure for lore‚Äôs sake a guild system would be a little wonky, but also it‚Äôs an mmo and Bethesda isn‚Äôt afraid to throw lore out the window.
---
That makes sense... I wish they could say we'll be down for X hours. But that's probably not feasible since they don't know what they'll encounter. Also wish they could change up the times when they do the work... although they probably would just say they choose the time when the server is least busy.
---
Dang, this is a lot like therapy - coming up with my own answers to the problems. (If they're the wrong answers then it's exactly like therapy.)
---
Try to put your cat in your lap, pet her/him.
---
You only need 1 hand for building ;)
---
Haven't been to west tech yet.  Oh the bucket list. Thanks for the tip
---
Oh I 100% think it should be in game. It's a mod I will not stop using until it is
---
apparently right now it doesn't actually work .. here's the info
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/buav7a/better\_criticals\_perk\_card\_doesnt\_work/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/buav7a/better_criticals_perk_card_doesnt_work/)
---
So they're all angry Mc D's losers who are reacting in game to someone being rude to them in real life. Reaching a bit mate...
---
Fucking 2 pounds üòÇ
---
To be fair I'm sure it's not easy to code a game this massive and have it hold out flawlessly running on servers. 
---
Especially in a community that intrinsically mods the shit out of these games.
---
Everytime they add something they also add a possible backdoor that people in house probably can't find as fast as half a million players at least.
---
I can confirm that the italian version is affected.
---
Will the "Player Vendor inventory disappearing bug" be fixed? I've had all my sales randomly cancel, forcing me to relist every item, at least 4 times now. It gets tiresome to redo that all the time.
---
Half of challenges have to go. Most of them are not challenges but impossible annoying chores.
---
Why the hell would you get born surviver and nerd rage? You want it triggering endlessly?
---
Wish they would put that kind of effort into the disappearing items bug. Yesterday it took my Enclave underarmor. Lots of comments on how I sold or dropped it by accident. So explain how the ability to craft it also went away? I had every lvl of crafting for that item. Now nothing! And rollback does not count. It would have to roll me back 3 months.
---
Sutton has it from time to time. That's where I bought mine.  
---
When I started actively looking, the first two times I saw it there I didn't have the caps-- finally the third time I could purchase it. I had 3 sightings in Sutton and once on Grhm (didn't have the caps) in about a month's time.... checking sporadically most days. I didn't bother server hopping.  
---
I hear Watoga has it sometimes but I haven't seen it there. Good luck.
---
You obviously haven't succumbed to the insanity caused by experiencing post apocalyptic life.
---
Bless us with knowledge o wise sage.
---
I replied about that a bit upper, but to answer you, actually the translation bug is visual and most events do record if you complete them (either because you remember them or look up on a site).
---
It's still an annoyance because it's not handy, and if something doesn't register, it might be either because it's bugged for you and not due to the translation issue.
---
Also, if you have a repeatable event (like the "kill X robots with a flamer") then you can't track it because it may not have the counter.
---
Plus I think it show how poorly the game is managed, IMO.
---
For you playing in English, I can relate. It took me a bit arriving here to figure out that "Scorchbeast" was what I have in game as "Sulfurie" (I dunno for German, but I think that "Sulfurie" (Sulphury?) is a really cool name.
---
Deathclaws are "√©corcheurs" (skin rippers) which is more spine-chilling :p.
---
there are probably more questionnable translations out there tho.
---
I don't get it
---
I've been doing give quests every single day on all three of my characters since he released and I have never seen firecracker whiskey
---
More fortnite please
---
In FO4 I used full rifleman and had my fully .50 cal instigating rifle and named it ‚ÄúOl‚Äô Faithful‚Äù and that was my main weapon

Yes..... That's exactly what I want it to do to keep me alive. It has a timer you know. And generally I also have to spam stimpaks myself anyway.
---
This will never happen but theres some guys making a fallout miami mod for fallout 4 so youre dreams will kind of come true.
---
okay now you are just trying to muddy the waters, you just flipped on your earlier statement about how this is a monumental task and now you want to argue that they dont need more people, do you just like to argue?
---
I would rather they fix the drop rate to make it realistic for people to get good drops. If that happened no need to have duping. I have never gotten a good drop like be aae or faster fire rate and I have multiple characters over level 100 I should have some good weapons
---
Some random thoughts...
---
Serendipity is your best friend and is BY FAR the best perk for a bloody build. 
---
The nerd rage perk along with the Adrenal Reaction mutation are also musts. 
---
Dodgy is great if you have a lot of AP. I run 5 pieces of powered so I never run out.
---
For armor, Unyielding and Bolstering are great but I now run Weightless Sentinel/Powered with the Chameleon mutation which even after the nerf works really well. I also have a set of Assassin's Powered with a Chameleon piece that works well. 
---
I think Blocker is worthless as almost no one uses melee and those that do die before they ever get to me. I can't remember the last time a melee was an issue.
---
The 91 DR for the backpack is nice.
---
Depending on the weapon you can still one shot people so expect it to happen. I have a BE Railway that almost always is a one shot kill but I get killed the same way too.
---
I'm a much bigger fan of damage mitigation over DR boosts when it comes to perks but you can certainly use both if it fits your build.
---
I saw that ...but it's not the same game play :(
---
This isn't GTA.
---
I'll have to find that!
---
I‚Äôve been talking about this for a while. Give the barrel mod control over the ammo. Being that the lever is likely firing 40. 70 rounds your only getting 3-4 more rounds. Which ain‚Äôt gonna do all that much. 
---
Just don‚Äôt add piercing rounds. Just the ammo count. Keep it in line with the hunting and other rifles.
---
How is it silly? Pretty sure people have been asking for this since release.
---
They could vary the time to be fair to all.
---
Thank you. I‚Äôm excited now to go and get it.  üôÇ
---
I feel your pain. Not sure if its on all systems but on PC, Bugs they say they have fixed in patch notes are still happening with regularity since launch. Enemies T-Posing, enemies frozen in a pose but still moving around, invisible enemies attacking and murdering you, game and server crashes on the regular, infinite loading screens, textures not loading in, rubber banding, Legendaries not dropping any legendary loot, dissapearing or falling through the earth, and yes I've tried all the tricks for the legendary issues, they are in fact just vanishing or not spawning anything.
---
But every time you try to talk about it, your deemed a troll attempting to sabotage the game and get down voted.
---
Also duping is very good for the economy in this game an occasional free range on duping should be allowed
---
Isnt this there second mmo, first being ESO
---
as someone who has done what OP did more than once, I wish I knew this before.  Thank you.  even a 50/50 shot at recovering my junk is better than the crushing realization that your unusually productive junk run is now the plaything of hell beasts.
---
BE or AAE... I honestly don't see much of a change for either when bloodied. Obviously if you aren't bloodied go AAE.
---
This occurs with other uniforms commonly. A fix is to equip/unequip either the outfit or under armor a couple of times till it sticks. It will randomly reoccur.
---
This happens with the Hunters Long Coat and another outfit (i forget which).
---
i assume all adding +1 agility w/ Agility already maxed at 15?
---
Bethesda said no off site dlc so no new maps sadly.
---
Did you read what I wrote originally? Blacklisted players changing their names. Trolling/scamming made easier. You should not be able to change your player display name once your account is made.
---
...I know. but a miami map isn't too far off from fitting. it doesn't have to be GTA.
---
Yea Cavalier/Sentinel and Assassin's now have a 75% chance to proc.
---
r/loss
---
Make a friend or run two accounts - this is important.
---
1. Get a serum recipe. 
---
2. Farm or buy materials for said recipe
---
3. Make many of them.
---
4. Sell then to vendors for 400+ caps each with hard bargain perk / grape mentats.
---
5. Transfer excess to other characters.
---
6. Log in every day on each character and max out your vendor caps, earning 1,400 per character per day.
---
7. Within 18 days, if you do nothing else, you will have 125,000 caps. You can do this with multiple accounts if you want.
---
Double is far better. Feels like the model from FNV. Although that one was firing .357 and not 40. 70. 
---
I‚Äôm doing a big iron lawman and I just scraped my 25 double lever last night.
---
Like to add I literally only have born survivor on for the SBQ fight as you're always getting hit. Especially if you stand face to face with it like I do to get permanent headshots
---
Hmm. I may have to try it. Saves a lot of time compared to me swapping to my vampire LMG. And diluted stims are cheap. Thanks for the strat!
---
I want my camp to be swarming with cats, but I'd be too sad if they all died. :(
---
ive been waiting for another to start my next build..
---
hopefully they do it again...
---
very sad indeed. they have done such an incredible job with this map, I would be very happy to see more as I really love the game play style etc in this game. I just want more.
---
1000+ steel: That's like one Hornwright Run. Not a huge loss there.  
---
200+ plastic: Equal to one Morgantown High / Crazy Cat Lady house raid. Easily recovered.  
---
100+ acid: About half the yield of a Snallygaster/Grafton Monster/Yao Guai roundup run.
---
Now if those were fluxes, I'd be hopping mad.
---
I feel smarter. That was a great explanation
---
Thanks fox
---
I wish bugs and balance were higher priorities...
---
Enjoy it. It‚Äôs cool but I felt it need more in the first person view.
---
Ooo. Good point. First hastily constructed MMO using the Creation Kit that was never meant to be online and a dev team that's never made an MMO? There, I think I fixed it.
---
Do you still need help. I am ready now, but not online yet.
---
I had 3 just randomly show up at my camp at the same time the other day. I'm nowhere near a fissure site either. 
---
When they show up I just server hop now.  They're too annoying to kill for no real incentive. I'm melee.
---
How about all the people would have to repair their camp every time someone fast travels and gets stuck and tears their way out. Let the destruction happen in survival mode.
---
I am set for melee and ranged weapons right now and am just looking for a few more sentinel pieces.
---
Oh, no, of course you can have your own oppinion Im never going to say the opposite I was just giving reasons on why for me the game looks not good enough. For me was a bad way to promote/justify the "jump to online/service game" nothing else.
---
I always though Fallout on Multiplayer could have a really nice interesting space for games, (which for me should be kept always as something like a Spin-off, and never removing/replacing the original single player experiences) but I see it just done with not enought interest to justify the move.
---
I have been for a good amount of years looking for games that mix multiplayer (or MMO elements/enviroment) into more action- shooter (TPS or FPS) that finds a good balance on both, which its not really a very ussual kind of game today even if there are some in the market such Destiny 2 or similar (the division) however most of them looks designed close around the idea of be like a cooperative with a few things taken from the MMO ecosystem.
---
For me F76 "its not that bad" on this space (FPS/TPS with some MMO elements) however the lack on the PvP moved it again closer to the "FPS/TPS cooperative game with some MMO elements on it"... which for example could feel refreshing or interesting enough for some users that use to play clasic MMO games "non action/shooting but the ones based, lets say "on numbers" (like WoW or GW2), but F76 doesnt really look like tries to "convice classic franchise players" more looks like the game was pointing for this MMO fanbase... or people that just is happy with "half a shooter, half a multiplayer", specially on consoles where MMO genre its not that ussual...
---
For me, Still, they lost the chance to actually make people (new to the franchise or people used to it) to consider this "online experiment" as a success... And its closer to break the fanbase on 2 types, which just happened with TESO/TES.. but F76 being mechanically based on F4 (and not designed as a mostly classic MMO) had a great chance to convice both sides of the coin.
---
You can be proud of it, it took a lot of work for some people. But some people spend $8 on eBay so that they can talk to other players with a certain conceit. I‚Äôm also saying that it‚Äôs not cool in PvP. You run around with this armor you found on the private market that‚Äôs nearly inaccessible to other players to obtain in an honest way and have significant advantage over other people.  It makes sense in PvE though.
---
You wouldnt even know about it if not for the dupes.
---
How many TSE would be in the wild if there was no duping I have never had a TSE from a legendary drop. I was fine with them after all they are a 2 shot explosive they should be overpowered but dupers ruined it for everyone.
---
- Colonel gutsy (with assault rifle)
---
Those things are deadly
---
Literally anywhere, but higher populations means higher chance of finding something. It's also worth jumping on a horde event in a higher level area and leaving the boss alone. More and more mobs will spawn, get higher in level and occasionally be legendary. Provide nobody else shows up and kills the boss.
---
Another power armor build...lame.
---
I have seen this and when his friend in hiding came out I killed him too some times the tail wags the dog....
---
It would be cool, sure, but there's absolutely no reason why they would do this out of all the other possibilities
---
Hopefully fixed with today's maintenance.
---
I was able to meet someone online last night. I helped him mule some mats to an alt, then I built a tower over the river outside my camp and we took turns diving into the shallow end. We both got the revive achieve and I was able to get  the backpack. Thank you for the offer. If you need it and I'm on tonight, I'd be happy to take a header into a rock creek again.
---
in last version patch they said something about correct "location" files... related with translation to non english version. Maybe in patch 10 will see more fixes about this
---
Its only good because the economy is so borked.  Half by duping half by a company who knows shit about online economies.
---
I'm in! Psn - piggye98
---
I am in the same boat...Need to launch that nuke!
---
Thats what I was saying from the beginning and since they didn't listen I abuse it to the fullest. Every time I kill someone and steal their stuff I swap straight to adventure to deposit it then come back. If I'm ever in danger I just swap to adventure then go to a different survival server. Theres no risk the way they did it but hey ill use it to my advantage I guess.
---
Best thing to do when you wake up is drink some water.  Eat your meals and food as you please, but drinking water before anything when you wake up from sleep is legit.
---
Yeah, sure...  because it's all about you and your fun...   lets completely ignore the fact that others have fun building... The level of selfishness in this post is exactly why Bethesda made CAMPs indestructible by other players.
---
I spent three to four nights building a really nice CAMP, moving stuff around so that it finally sets down properly (don't get me started about how annoying the build bugs are), finding more concrete or other building materials, filling up my Vending machines, etc.  To have to rebuild because some idiot with a rocket launcher wants to test their new toy would make me drop this game so  fast your head would spin.
---
Here is a good question for people who continue to complain about this:  How much real money have you spent in the Atomic store?  I'm willing to bet that the vast majority have no investment in this game beyond the purchase price.  I'm not suggesting that spending extra money on this game makes anyone better than anyone else, just this is how Bethesda profits off of the game and that they do not have a vested interest in doing things that will disrupt this income stream.
---
Also, from a purely practical standpoint, assuming an unlimited defense budget, just how would you suggest the CAMP security system determine friend or foe?  After all, the purpose of selling items is to allow people into your CAMP to buy things.  How would it tell that you've decided to play Raider and launch a mini Nuke?  It's just impractical with how Vending machines work.
---
Yes, but for another reason. A lot of my sale stuff is aimed at low-levels (20 or so) who have a few caps and need a boost via eg a fully modded lvl20 lever. Guys like that need to be able to see content  too.
---
Raider vendor bot white springs
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem optimal, is there anything that says the more animals and higher level the better the drops?
---
But it can only be done once per three month period:  [https://i.postimg.cc/Xqcfw0mh/bethesda-net-en-account-manage-account.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/Xqcfw0mh/bethesda-net-en-account-manage-account.jpg)
---
aahhhhhhh.  I see
---
The recent trend I've seen is horrendous management from the higher ups in the companies. Look at what happened to anthem or call of duty. With the team that they have and the time between updates, I'm positive we could have both new content and much-needed bug fixes if they really set their minds to it
---
I don't think it's been implemented into the game properly so you can't unlock the recipies. I don't have any official word tho, just going on some comments I've seen on the sub.
---
Tried just a sec ago, it's off and still is running bad, i guess something is wrong still
---
It continues to baffle me that they didn't include a  even a simple guild system at launch. Multiplayer games are always going to have a need to accommodate groups of people.
---
Never gonna happen. New content is plannable, bugs could be ANYTHING. You can‚Äôt plan out a roadmap for defect remediation.
---
I used him until I picked a lock. 
---
Strong disliked that. 
---
Yeah bye
---
If only they chose the 80s instead of the 40s/50s in the beginning.
---
You monster.
---
The cm made a post earlier. Apparently Bethesda are concerned players are skipping the most important meal of the day out so are leaving the servers off each morning to fix this.
---
How is duping good for the economy
---
I really don't see how what I said is in anyway confusing, but if you say so.
---
Ammo is cheap
---
It's durable and cheap to repair
---
Rifleman perks work with
---
Faster firing rate than the Sniper and larger ammo cap than lever action. 
---
Choo Choo, mother fucker
---
I think right now the game has more bugs than it had at launch. Last patch was really bad in terms of bugs.
---
Yes we would, cause many people farmed so much legendaries, that it would be problem anyway.
---
There is a priority list and for sure exploits and on the top and they are right about it.
---
Thanks for the tip. I've only done the event a couple of time. Maybe i'll do a similar write-up for that.
---
As a shotgunner I agree, 2 dynamics come into play right away. Have to be close and if you are not aiming then you have aiming vs hip shot to deal with as well. Then if you are not spec'd there is that issue. Also you need to try to keep your weapons as close to your level as you can. I know at lower levels its tough to manage food, chems, staying alive and ammo. I just started a new character and I forgot how tough it is to earn and keep caps at level 35 and below vs my lvl 130 character. Legendaries at the lower levels just arent worth it so dont bother. Pick a path for your cards, stick with it and try to get and keep a good weapon.
---
Ps4 you say huh .. üòÅ
---
Does it say PA? Or anything to denote it from non PA? Im just never sure when im looking in shops lol
---
I forgot the mutations
---
well I know :( I like what it IS now, I just got to thinking this could be cool!
---
&gt;mish-mash
---
Do you mean mismatched? Lol, sorry I've never heard/saw it posted spelled like that.
---
Dont be a baby, its fun. Why do you think games like GTA are so popular? People like the escapism of going on rampages. Doing it to other players just ups the ante for some. I get it if youre not into it but calling people pathetic for it is just lame and projecting lol.
---
Yes it does. Trust me the regular armor is ALOT harder to find lol
---
the barfey face also pisses them off and then mute them--- perfect-- then go bout your business
---
Yep I do wish they'd fix some challenges
---
According to the world challenge section I should be due 120-140 atoms, it hasnt registered certain locations on the map as visited ( even tho I've been to them on numerous occations) it's annoying af
---
Todd knows memes that don't originate from skyrim! We're getting somewhere, lads!
---
Tell bubbles and julian to put down the bags and swords
---
Totally agree. Drops should be better too much grinding for something that‚Äôs required in this game imagine no duping tho. A few people wrecking everyone with BE and AAE handmades
---
Where is your base located?
---
I price all my stuff real low, 500 caps is probably the most I sell for.  I love the ding of sales when people visit my CAMP
---
I totally agree. Challenges like get this type of disease, got sludge lung but won‚Äôt clear. But the challenge of use 76 bobbleheads was completed when I used maybe 20 if that. So take those atoms back,  but give me the location challenge, disease challenge etc back.    :)
---
wanna link the tweet mentioned in the body of op?
---
Ohhhh I like I like! That would be a whole new level.

I'm going to keep an eye out for that xo-1 bcuz I really don't like mismatched PA. Thank everyone for the info offeredüëçüëçüëç

Breakfast literally means the meal that breaks your fasting, so whatever is your first meal of the day, that's your breakfast. I'm working late shifts, so lunch is my breakfast.

being taken as confusing is the least of your worries
---
Just got a TSE light machine gun off a legendary ghoul at Camp Venture not two days ago..
---
Did that once, got dropped like a fly and learned my lesson. You should to! 
---
It sucks, it's annoying but ultimately, you have complete control to not to react and cause a negative impact.
---
Definetly! Postet about it some days ago either - got the respond of a fellow dweller that they are aware already but i would be nice if they finally patch it.
---
For range weapons 2* reason is the 3rd * is very minor of an effect usually a attribute that dosen't help as much, most are after the 2nd * effect explosive.
---
For melee shoot for 3* because more attributes affect the weapon use like +1str/end/agl or 40% more p-atk dmg.
---
For armor 3* because some of the best effects for armor is only found on a 3rd * like sentinal/cavalier.
---
Lowers prices so more people can buy weapons. Ya it destroys the value of weapons for people who trade. But it makes god tier weapons easily accessible. And god tier weapons are a must in this game sadly
---
Oh, so THAT'S why servers were shitting themselves again recently.
---
I think dupers are providing a valuable service because they force Bethsoft to fix all of those bugs, but I also hope Bethesda swings the banhammer hard and fast and kicks every last one of them.
---
I never had any lag or jerky issues until the 9.0 patch. I had heard about these issues by watching the Oxhorn videos on youtube. For me it turned out to be the friends list invite issue, once I cleared out my friends list so I only had like 10 or less friends listed that all cleared up. It had nothing to do with video card or driver settings at all. My machine is a beast and has tons of memory and ran smooth since launch, many others now have reported the same success by clearing out unaccepted invites from their friends list and I believe Bethesda has acknowledged an issue there.
---
With ebay and people willing to drop stacks of real cash on the new meta gear each week, there will always be a reason to dupe.

Preston Garvey robot! Unkillable.. but he'll surely mark your map of a settlement in need of help.

---
I heard of that phenomemon and it might be true. Basically if you have a big development team; they aren't all multiskilled and knowledgeable in all details of the game. Giving a graphic developer the task of putting the translation fields back in the proper place might no be the best idea.
---
It's a common thing that most experimented development companies know how to do - when the big work is done, they prune their development team down to keep only the needed people.
---
Given that apparently the branch of Bethesda in charge of Fallout 76 is, from what I heard, less experimented, we might have a case of "too many cooks in the kitchen" as he said.

It doesn't mean that you're wrong when suggesting to hire more programmers. You just have to make sure you hire the right kind of programers.
---
Have you seen the state of everywhere, some guy on here told me that his view of 76 being a bad game was fact and not opinion like it is, in art there will always be haters and admireres, but no art piece is truley bad, just not someones taste, also i have had good interactions related to 76 infact one if those people were invited to join my and my group. üòÄ

This is no surprise, I mean after the issues at release I'm not surprised by any of this

run a nuke silo naked with a paddle ball
---
What's the exploit?
---
The larger point here is that Bethesda has a broken spot in the game that urgently needs fixed. The final goal of the Quantum Paint is secondary.
---
Not just the possum challenges broke the ones pertaining to locations are also broke too.
---
Each one is 80 atoms worth in ash heap, mire etc... and according to mine I havnt visited them all even tho I have countless times. I could visit them with an alt but it shouldn't be necessary to do that and be fixed

Camp next to a beehive then?  I have a clump of them in my camp and other players almost always go loot them before they leave and because it's an environment hive it's never empty from the last customer.

I've only got like 4 friends in 76 and no invites, it's really annoying me now because 76 is all i'm playing right now and it's become unplayable and laggy for the past few days and seemingly only in 76 because no hardware issues detected nor is fallout 4 on near maximum settings even dropping more than a few frames in boston, not even a full reinstall fixed this

Sweet I have been waiting 165 levels so far.

I'll check it out plus I noticed that some ppl sell plans for 1000 for PA pieces. Hope more fully buildable suits are intro'd tho. Thank you for your info thoü§òüëç

Yes but you‚Äôve been posting it for a VERY long time now. Like I think PC gamers can be annoying too, but I don‚Äôt obsessively post in every thread about PCs saying how much better console gaming is.
---
holding my breath for the F76: Escape From Butcher Bay Expansion
---
Blacklisted players? Do you keep a list of players that have upset you? Is someone really trolling so hard that theyd change their name to continue trolling you? Is the PC community so small that you run into the same players more than once?
---
That's funny
---
Use them mules to mod those weapons you have stashed on em, heck have em make throwing knives. They'll bank on them atoms quick.

Very true.

My favorite weapon is the "yes, I'm compensating for something." It's a tiny shooter, but causes a lot of damage.

From what I‚Äôve heard they‚Äôre only banning people that have hundreds or thousands of ‚Äúunique‚Äù items

I highly doubt that this asset flip of a game is suffering from having too many devs. We all know the dev team gets chopped down once the game is built and a smaller team keeps it running, my argument is that the results show that this team is underfunded and too small, to say its too big... thats such a reach I cant even fathom how you would consider it a valid excuse
---
But are they God tier weapons if everyone has them and they get nerfed to death.

Settlement? everyone in this game is dead.

Wait, servers are down?

The sound difference will have you wearing them everytime you play bcuz they help with immersion by cancelling all outside sound. Listen for enemy last breaths üëçüëçüëç

Still not seeing why they can‚Äôt do this for every weekend. Event if it‚Äôs lowers for fairness. Or tweaked for multipliers when teamed.

Well put üòä

I know, my first thought was profit.
---
You have really crappy luck then. I think I've gotten four in total. Would have been more but they removed TSE from the loot table for some time. Next time you're in an area, tag the boss of that area and then kill everything else. Eventually leveled enemies will begin to spawn in and your chances of a legendary become better. This is how I got my most recent TSE.

Without hazmat? Imposibruuuu

Is this a PC thing? I didn‚Äôt know we could rename our weapons

Whitespring is my go to spot when I play. Always come out with legendaries of some sort. Plus all that juicy xp.

Wrong, steel total weight unbulked is 1.6lbs while bulked it is 1.5lbs. Same goes for aluminum and oil. Someone also thought the same thing and went and checked and even came back and confirmed that is the case.

Where is this?

No, I'm spending plastic to bulk the steel to save weight.

Absolutely. If I get a WTF of any sort, its a server hop if I want to try again.

I tend to save up a few hundred before I go roll the dice again.

Did you find the cave?

Maybe that Project Paradise first naked and afraid?Too easy?

Happened to me. The worst part was bethesda's launcher wasn't prepared for the surge of downloads, so my download was constantly stuck at 500kb/s speeds.
---
Seeing as I'm a mother with children I don't "party". Nice try though.
---
I find this too as well. As a VATs Sneak Commando Build, would love to add two more pieces of viable so that adding dodgy in pvp context doesn‚Äôt drain me of precious AP and can recover quickly enough to counter. I‚Äôve solely left dodgy out of my build because even three pieces can leave me drained in a fight (provided that I can VATs lock on on stealth boy abusing people lol)

Lockpick and Hacker and those kinda cards are separated out because they are spread out across level locks also. Not saying it is elegant or a good rule of thumb for this system's design.... just saying that is likely why things like that are spread out.  
---
I do agree that some cards need better consolidating. And things added like rifle weight reduction. Pistols don't need weight reduction.

I always start at the clubhouse in Whitesprings, if I don't pick up a legendary here then I'll server hop and try again, but I'll usually get 2-3 legendaries. Then I'll follow the bungalows all the way around, usually picking up 2-3 more, then I cut over to the maintenance area where there's usually at least one more legendary in the bunch, then the last section of bungalows which leads me right back to the clubhouse, which is often times already starting to respawn ghouls.
---
According to my 5 year old we are a Monarchy with King Donald Trump and he's the boss of everyone.
---
I like your hopefulness.
---
True!!!!!
---
Both animal friend and wastland whisperer fully upgraded and equipped, MAXIMUM half your level, space in your camp and must be a lone random encounter with no other creatures in the same encounter. For instance,  a solo sloth can be tamed, a sloth fighting a yao guai cannot. I've never had a creature over level 21, and the highest I've seen is 31, so try and make sure you have enough room for both the creature and some turrets to defend it.
---
No. You're good. Say what you will about dirty water, at least it tastes better than the recycled piss water we've been dealing with. 
---
Stupid water chip always breaking...
---
Absolutely. Is this for a PC version and is it in the US?
---
Yep that‚Äôs what I do to, like a typical gambler lol
---
 Wait, levers are brown?
---
Excuse me Sir, i am not dead :)
---
Ah! xD
---
Isn't there a perk card that increases XP gain while in a team?
---
Wait, my mom has a crown?
---
ROFL, you think ESO and warframe are two of the most popular mmo's out? WoW is still active and VERY popular.
---
Your own link you shared above disproves everything you said, because from your link it lists fallout 4 as being more played than fo76 currently. With steams numbers you saw that fallout 4 is managing around 7 to 10k players daily. That means this game receives less than that.
---
So make up your mind, is your link valid and correct or you going to keep arguing against your own links? LOL
---
Yeah, Ive played since beta. This is a good recap of the scandals. This isn't a review of the game.
---
Usually I start wandering and see what catches my attention more than exploring.
---
I think it more of pillaging, thank what ever it is you do or dont believe in there not rapeing to
---
Like an idiot i lost 3 crimson 2 yellow and 1 other fluxs i moved them to free up space and was ment to put them in my vendor but forgot 
---
I got killed in whitesprings cause i didnt stimpack quick enough and lost the lot 
---
I didnt even realise what i had done untill a few days later
---
But that‚Äôs the thing they haven‚Äôt fixed cause they literally can‚Äôt figure it out. A completely different team has taken the fo4 engine and repurposed it and reused creates assets. They have to assume how they work and how they interact with things and trial and error it out.
---
Thanks!!..i need this laugh...
---
Uh, yeah sorry we just forgot to tell you that you were, anyways...
---
cool wheres your settlement? not your CAMP, your settlement?
---
I typically just pick a spot on the map and just go explore the region and read terminals. Usually pick a spot in the middle of nowhere that I haven‚Äôt explored yet.
---
This is my favorite reply yet
---
ROFL, ultracite is forged post war. You forget that the enclave bunker under the whitespring has it's own foundry. So it absolutely has fresh new alloys that weren't really even available prior to the war such as ultracite.
---
My Brother is a level 170ish and he has never got one either. Thank goodness for player vending I got 2 TSE weapons in one day so I am one of the cool kids now.
---
It has to do with vendors. No server crashes needed, just whatever you want to dupe, and caps. The server thing will just be the usual problems with the game I think.
---
Funny that no matter how many times they patch it out, it comes back in a different form. Bethesda are partially responsible for this, and I quite admire the creativity of it all anyway.
---
Inspirational. Yes. But I mean like a soft exp boost just for weekends. Maybe would have lower the boost enough to compete with the perk. But in general just a way to encourage team play. 
---
I had a team support character and rarely got teamed or added to join. Something that says ‚Äúhey join a team and get more exp‚Äù would get the sentrybot moving.
---
On my main I spam the cook button and it does 1 or 2 things and then hangs. Sometimes only a second or so and sometimes for what feels like forever. It drives me crazy... especially when I have like 75+ glowing meat I'd like to cook so they vendor for 11caps each.
---
But on my alts I can spam cook very fast and it rarely ever lags. I don't understand it.  Maybe it's because I have a ton of food stuffs already on my main that's weight reduced 90% from the perk? Maybe it's because I have all the food recipes unlocked and the check to see what can be crafted after using the raw stuff and mats takes longer with more recipes unlocked?
---
I don't know... but I feel ya. And I've been waiting for a fix for this for months.
---
The only reason I'm against that, is I often find myself forgetting to switch back to my combat loadout after leaving a camp or vendor. It would be a pain in the ass to have to run away from mobs until I'm a safe distance away and then switch loadouts and head back in. 
---
I get the worry about switching during pvp, so a restriction on switching loadouts while engaged in pvp is fine. But combat overall would cause a lot of frustrations.
---
The blacklist is news to me. Its news to most players since probably less than 1% of the player base uses those subs. Hence why those blacklists are probably useless, and this isnt really the problem you think it is.
---
Good thoughts. Although I don't see why having NPC's slowly filter back into Appalachia is a big deal. The ai is a bit different than enemies and robots but it's still just another creature in game.  The scorch queen is defeated so the story has to continue!
---
I think having factions and faction specific events and quests would be awesome.  If I join the responders I can earn ranks and special equipment.  Just add vending machine's and a mechanic similar to the way the ever upwards quests work.  For example;
---
\-Raiders--asked to destroy supply caravan.  Successful completion earns you ears you can trade for items, cosmetics, and raider specific perks.
---
\-Responders--asked to defend settlers. Successful completion earns you badges that you trade for items, cosmetics, weapons, etc.
---
These also would transform into pvp events when working to do things.  Raiders vs. Responders or Enclave vs. Brotherhood.
---
You‚Äôre right, but that doesn‚Äôt make what you do any less creepy. Also nobody is obsessed over you. Get over yourself.
---
Oh okay, I see what you're saying. That would sound fair.
---
im all for the exploit fixes but theres so many things that need to be addressed. it gets kinda frustrating,
---
I will have to try that thanks for the tip
---
Got the last one from munitions factory
---
It's because exploits are often very easily fixed whereas bugs may require "rewiring" half the code because time crunch ended up with a ton of spaghetti where some solid lasagna should be
---
It does for me. I've only had to type in my password maybe a handful of times since the game was released. Basically the standard occasional, "we need your password again just to be sure you're you". I'm only asked for it each time if I launch the game from outside the Bethesda launcher.
---
Do you perhaps have the launcher running but are launching the game directly using the FO76.exe executable, instead of from the "PLAY" button in the Bethesda launcher?
---
Gotta love or hate Bethesda huh?
---
ROFL, oh no some little boy on the internet is mad at me. What ever shall I do? If you'd have taken the time to look at my post history you'd know I retired at 30 after working at Midway games. Which I used to get into real estate and own many rental properties.
---
I'm not worried about how to make money when I myself am EXTREMELY comfortable financially, as are my children. Want to whine some more little boy?
---
Yeah, they want it to empty their extractors, harvest their crops and water, go out on scavenging missions, rebuild the camp if it gets damaged...pretty much play the game for them.
---
Shotgun with enforcer is a good weapon to bring it helps with keeping the SBQ grounded,  bring two shotguns just in case since the SBQ is a bullet sponges, your weapon may break before the fight is over unless the person dropping the nuke keeps the weapon bench outside the drop.
---
What about bloody mess?
---
Kant ewe just lern inglish? 
---
Its sue per e-z
---
Same here. Not sure why you're being downvoted.
---
nope. seems to be literally only for the exploit. all bugs will be addressed in "a future update"
---
Earlier i found player that was kind enough to die for me too.
---
Then i realized you cant revive with deluted stimpaks and i had no normal ones.
---
I got a stimpak from the other player but shortly before he was down again to be revived i took damage and reflex healed with "H". It obviously used the single stimpak i had.
---
Now i got 5 more stimpaks from that player and he was kind enough to jump into his possible death a 3rd time.
---
Just awesome
---
Ah. That makes more sense than [what I was thinking. ](https://i.imgur.com/RKaVrgW.png)
---
Yes, laws that make it illegal for companies to not accommodate the disabled. Do you bitch and moan about handicapped spots too? Maybe wheel chair ramps?
---
I always be sure to grab that horse when I'm around there and I always wonder what's the deal with it. Knew it had to be some reference to some show I've barely heard of. Guess I'm not disappointed
---
See, you're wrong. I didn't launch that nuke. I launch at least two a day.
---
It's funny how one single YouTuber can practically dictate when Bethesda is taking the game offline for maintenance. Makes me wonder why he is not going online with new dupes at, like, Saturday night...
---
It was a lovely weapon, especially with a vats commando build. I wasn't sad to see it go, because I know I'll see it again, and again, and again haha.
---
The one I'm rolling with now is technically superior, but I prefer the other because I got it naturally, and it was perfect for me.
---
i would like to have some friends to build a town our of our camps with
---
thanks! I will have to hold that place for a while and see if I can get it to drop. That 10~11k price is too high for my stingy butt.
---
Our top story of the day: being killed by other players continues to upset people!
---
Coming up at 11: That girl you have had a crush on for a year and never spoken to still won't ask you out and how you can convince yourself she's a *bitch*
---
Now your weather forecast for the year: almost daily changes to occur with long periods of high and low temperatures!
---
really Depends on gear and build I found a early weapon 25 instigating fireaxe so I crafted a entire set of lvl 25 excavator armor and transfered it to my alt, 25-50 went pretty quickly nuked white springs harpers ferry the burrows at harpers ferry.  You need to find that one low lvl weapon that will allow 1 or 2 shot ghouls and your golden.  bout close to 50 started getting the watoga map markers at 50 did the mayors quest and now you can add watoga high to your power lvl runs each of those gives you about 1/2 a way to a new lvl.
---
And you have to wonder about the shear entitlement that people have to feel to want to be able to blow up everything...  see, it cuts both ways...   
---
If you truly want better game-play, lets start with fixing the turrets first.  I've seen high-level Radrats chewing on resource extractors with the turrets barely making a dent.  
---
Wake me when this is fixed and then we can have a serious conversation.  Until then, the in-game mechanics do not support being able to effectively defend your base and the whole argument is selfish and specious.
---
Yeah. Just something to make the weekends fun. While framing grinding and whatnot.
---
Lmao very good point
---
Thats not smart business if you need to call in a bunch of ppl to work at odd ball times. "Hey dave... Can you come back to work at 8pm so we can get this sorted out for Europeans.. Thx" 
---
Going to pay ppl extra to do the same job they could be doing during normal business hrs.
---
I'm on PC not xbox. fo76 on PC has zero text function at all.
---
lately ive lost all purpose. i just put on music and aimlessly kill anything i see.
---
Go to WEST TEK, kill everything, loot everything, walk by foot (900 lbs) to the nearest train station, sell everything, do some events, tweak my camp, turn PS4 off, go to sleep.
---
It's in one of the porta potties in the big bank of like 20 of them on the...I thinks it's the south east side of the park
---
There's also a magazine in one of the others like 5% of the time
---
How are you playing right now? Says the servers are under maintenance lol
---
Are ppl buying plans ? I dumped 200 plans after having em up for 10-100 caps each 1week . Imo its better to sell at under price than to dump, ppl just not buying my shit ‚òπ
---
Serums i sold for 300 each. They moved very slowly
---
I totally agree. If I can't switch my loadout because of a random scorched stuck in a wall, I'm gonna be pissed! 
---
The restriction should only be during PvP combat.
---
I always like to try for a few rare outfit spawns and recipe/plan spawns. After that I'll do my best to run the vendor out of caps. I usually have about 1k on me at anytime so vending is a huge goal. Im lvl 135 now and mostly do this or wander around looking for new locations.
---
I agree. should just reset across the board when the daily/atomic shop does.
---
Reddit is a prickly bitch at times. :)
---
The discover locations I was missing on my beta character are popping on my new character. It seems like the discover location ones are fixed just not retroactive.
---
He looks big for his age was his mommy a behemoth?
---
Ab-so-lutely needed as well :D
---
I fast every day between lunch and dinner and dinner and lunch, does that mean I'm eating neither and having two break fasts a day
---
I would love to see Bethesda ban these people. How hard can it be for them to view the youtube video, get the gamer tag, and ban them?   Idk, maybe they already do this?
---
Ah too bad, hope it returns online soon, was planning to do some proper playing on my day off!
---
Haha thanks!
---
1000c for both?
---
Doing that myself.
---
Annoying timing on a free day...
---
New dupe found. They kinda had no choice on this one. Its a damned if do kinda thing :(
---
Yep, people don't realize, you fix 1 bug and 10 come out of it. Pretty much not worth their time YET to fix minor bugs :/
---
Shutting servers down is best. Particularly since updates often deal with server maintenance.
---
I usually end up farming for my vending machine (like last night I hopped servers till I found a nuked zone to farm Flora to craft flux because I sell it). I don't really have a bona fide way of deciding. Although, I may start narrowing it down to two things and then flipping a coin from here on out lol.
---
You are probably going to need bear arms if you want to carry multiple heavy weapons. Also bandolier comes to mind with all that ammo.  You don‚Äôt really need blocker if you are going to be shooting from a range most the time and the power armor is very strong against melee. I only use bullet shield for the boss fights and swap it out with traveling pharmacy because   my stash is full.
---
I know ;)
---
I snapped this a few days ago.  I just updated it now cause maintenance.
---
My doc character sells meds and meds only. all are priced 20% below vendor price.
---
All my characters tend to sell at or below "vendor bot" price... with some "roleplaying exceptions".
---
I was thinking of one called "Taking Back Sunday's" where players steal back and defend the stills from Super Mutants or whatever in order to make another type of Shine.
---
ahhh... good to know, i'll have to try this when i get home
---
I start with a quick lead run through lucky hole and then mosey around and sort of do whatever, if i find some nice plans its camp building, if i stumble across some events its event time or maybe a west tek run.
---
Tldr: take it as it comes really
---
One of the big reasons PC is better is the availability of mods. But using mods also requires maintenance.
---
His symptoms sound like what happens when you run mods but don‚Äôt do maintenance. 
---
So it‚Äôs not a ‚ÄúPC problem‚Äù, it‚Äôs a user problem.
---
Same. Wood armor or scout armor is about it.
---
I have no idea what karma is I just started using Reddit so whatever you think I'm doing I'm not I'm just trying to discuss this with people so you can take your little panties and unwind them
---
I enjoy posting in threads, topics and discussions that interest me. As i say i stand by all my comments 100%, for instance my comment here is 100% true and on topic, you and the other guy both know that, so instead you decide to just try and drag me into a petty little squabble.
---
Again, the only thing i find creepy is this weird stalker like behavior but like i say, if you want to obsess over me then that is your problem...
---
Yup. I went through 900 rounds of my ghoul slayers LMG with +10 aiming damage in a single Whitesprings run. It cuts them down like grass, but the stupid things kept healing back up to full instead of dying!
---
For one of the ‚ÄúTake a photo in this region‚Äù I‚Äôm at 19/20 and it won‚Äôt tell me the location. So frustrating lol. The forest one finally unlocked for me about a month ago, though.
---
Can't wait for you to milk some mutants. You can milk anything with nipples Gary.
---
I have a build video to edit tonight but I shall try to pop round tomorrow.
---
Can confirm on PS4
---
Turn in daily legendaries, sell scrap at vendor, daily events, and then roam the mire and cranberry bogs looking for legendaries.  Check out the atom quests, and grab a workshop on the way out.  Once a week or so I do a lucky hole run for lead, and do a queen if i need flux.
---
Sleep is one-way time travel!
---
Ok well look at the sub before you start posting stuff. This is posted every single day. You arent saying anything new, and posting here will do absolutely nothing.
---
All i wish is to see it fixed, so big thanks for aknowledging this issue! looking forward to this bug being addressed! thank you!
---
I think the plan dropped for "retake the munitions factory" rather than the claim or defend.
---
  
---
I know what you mean on plan costs. Same goes for a lot of power armor mod plans. Oh and heads up, the neon letters eat a fair amount of camp budget so keep that in mind.
---
Is that the one that has a locked box inside? 
---
If so, that connects to one of the hidden "quests" to get into the TNT domes- I think it has something to do with the time machine thing
---
It's 20 hours from the first item you sell not the last.
---
If you sell your first item at 6:00pm, the next day the caps will reset at 2:00pm.
---
I'm running this game at 1080p with an i5 2500k at 4.2 GHz and a gtx 970 OC. It runs pretty good at high to medium settings. There are some stutters in places like Charleston or white spring but overall it is still very enjoyable.
---
did you play them til you were well tuned?
---
Hey, I sell Teddy Bears at double vendor-pricing, and people buy 'em.
---
Keep in mind, there IS a roleplaying community in this game... players that play in "character", and to whom it's not all about buying and selling and maxing stats.
---
If that was true not saying it's not then that's weird because my spawn point is off a cliff I had to build off to be able to catch myself from falling when I spawn in
---
lol :)
---
Can do it on the PC as well. Just have to add this to an INI file:
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/articles/20
---
Also, I'll stick with my ultrawide, mods, and better graphics over the ps4.
---
Where/how in heck did you get a full weightless sentinal set? I've never even seen a full set. In months, I've managed to scrape together 4 pieces, and 2 of them are left arms.
---
An exploit is something that players can use to gain an advantage, not something that inadvertently gives NPC's an advantage.
---
Tadpole Dailies, just started Bivs nonsense so doing those as well.
---
Scrip any legendaries I have stocked from the day before.
---
Slay some mutants, collect their gear, kill off the vendor caps.
---
Then it's just kind of whatever. Usually chasing more legendaries &amp; XP. Try to get at least one level up each session if I can help it. Check any vendors with interesting stock numbers (trying to complete my armor set, always on the hunt for good weaponry).
---
Need stable flux in a bad way (damned you decon shower!) so the next few sessions will probably aim to farm nuked flora.
---
Make sure its somewhere off the beaten path. Can't tell you how many times I've had someone spawn in and kill the boss while I'm trying to force spawn legendaries. I was supremely lucky to have been the only soul to be turning in tech data on that particular server that day. 
---
The only other tip I can give is to stay crouched so you don't appear on the map once you've found your spot. 
---
I usually stick to areas with ghouls because they're the easiest to take down once they level to you. If you have an AAE, the Red Rocket mega  truck stop is a great place to farm. Yeah I know Super Mutants usually spawn there but lots of roof tops to snipe from. Also very rarely see people up that way.
---
Here OP, if you are on PC this is how you set it up so you don't have to put in password or even launch the launcher: 
---
Add these lines to your [Documents_Location]\My Games\ Fallout 76\Fallout76Custom.ini
---
[Login]
---
s76UserName=your_login
---
s76Password=your_password
---
Now you can either launch the game directly or add it to your steam library and launch it from there. All you'll have to do is press Enter few times, as your credentials will already be pre-filled for your convenience.
---
You have to put your password in whenever the Bethesda launcher patches, it's not everytime and it does have a save info option.
---
I just found this out yesterday, and at the same time found out I had an arktos backpack skin I dont recall getting.
---
Named mine "Hard Gay"
---
yes, that's a workaround that works, but nevertheless a bad solution and it needs a proper one. especially as there's surely a lot of ppl not speaking english at all. the reason they bought the game in their own language.
---
This is about a bug, not trying to trade anyone.
---
Okay, that's incredibly outlandish
---
Yeah true
---
They have been always so.
---
yes, it is. i also saw pictures of it too before.
---
Well, i guess, he is right.
---
To be fair, a lot of people claiming 'disappearing items' *are* people dropping items or other user-initiated issues.
---
I'm on PC, and I swap out my perks a lot.  Tab - T and start swapping.  Only, oops, it didn't go to perks, so try T again...there we go.  And...I'm missing an item?!?
---
R is just to the left of T...Tab - R will drop whatever your first inventory item is (All Rise maybe? :P ).  And you don't necessarily get a message when it drops.  So rushing into your perks isn't a good idea.  I've found myself doing that enough to recognize when it happens (usually) without seeing it.
---
What you're experiencing is an *actual* bug (I'd guess).  I'd definitely be reporting that, but I doubt you'll get a comforting answer based on everything I've read.
---
Yeah that happens to me from time to time is very frustrating I'm way up in a mountain
---
I log in 3 different characters after feeding my son in the morning, turn in 1 item to the lego machine to get the script rerolling for the next day asap then play later. Later in the day it's 450 script to earn.
---
I'd need to look. It's found really close to Vault 76 when travelling *roughly* towards the overseer's camp... it's beside a cabin, with a bunch of mutts in and around it.
---
That just sounds like a broken mechanic to me. Unless you are somehow some badass level 5 taking on level 100, you have no real business in leaderboards.
---
Cheers for the info and heads up, it's saved me trying it myself
---
Thank you, and the guy below me too.
---
Why? He is litterally helping them by giving info on dupe methods. Saves them time trying to fig out how it is done.
---
I would leave him as is and hope he keeps putting up new dupe methods.
---
ok, thx for info
---
That‚Äôs how it usually is except for the weekly survival challenge to take lakeside cabins workshop and now there‚Äôs teams just camping on it but not taking it to draw people into death. It‚Äôs though when none of your friends will play survival and you are stuck solo.
---
Pc too. Huzzah!
---
I was offering to buy them :)
---
More often than not my focus is legendary farming - the standard places and events. I try to farm one area and move to the next, staying in a walkable range collecting junk, visiting camps, doing events before each jump. When I'm full enough I need to switch over to the high cap backpack mod and take some bufftats, I go home - tend to my vendors, visit vendors and scrip machine.
---
Rinse and repeat until my scrip, vendorbots, and stash are capped again - then I sit idle mostly waiting for for people to buy stuff to decrease my stash for the next day.
---
Is there ANYONE with the English version who is willing to compile a list of the **possum badge Challenges**? A lot of people will be thankful to you!
---
Screenshots are enough for me, i just want to know what i have to do :(
---
no, thx ;)
---
all you mentioned i still experience a lot, and i'm on ps4. so seems it's no matter what platform.
---
and yes, you never can avoid trolls. but i'm still happy, as it seems that majority of the reddit community seems to be very cool, helpful and supportive. really thankful for it.
---
Thank you on PC too!
---
You've clearly never played the original Fallouts if you think the entire series isn't built on references to references 
---
Besides, do you get so pissed off when the guards in Skyrim mention someone stealing your sweet roll? Are Fallout references in Elder Scrolls OK? 
---
It's just a tiny inside joke for people without sticks up their ass
---
I'll never kill another random cat again...
---
yes, seems it also brought back some of the older issues :/
---
I tag the queen. Then I work on the trash mobs keeping those with high firepower as safe as possible. Revive others when needed, and when the queen lands I lay everything I have into her and repeat until event is over.
---
I use rifles and they don't help so much while she is in the air so I contribute as best I can.
---
Just don't be that guy who tags and then does nothing.
---
I've had the stupid back out issue as well. Only seems to happen the first time for me but it's first time everytime.
---
Menu lag is definitely much worse. Gotten very cautious selling items off (had some stuff disappear the other day reckon I sold it to a vendor accidentally).
---
Yes, yes, thank the nine.
---
Not up yet for EDT just tried.
---
You're right a level 5 should not be on the leaderboard. If they get up on the leaderboard anyone should be allowed to kill them without getting shit for killing a low level.
---
Nah settlers have unlimited ammo if u do that,  but if you make companions use anything other than their default weapon they don‚Äôt have unlimited ammo.
---
I've been running into instances where I'm walking along and then fall through a sidewalk or into a mountain.  I spawned in last night and was half in the ground.  I'm patient and take things in stride, but there really are just too many bugs.  One that really irritates me is not being able to use VATS with melee.
---
there's still a long way to go...however, i still hope they can sort out this bugs to make this game the great game it could be.
---
Oh no. That's totally different. I didn't know about that one and I've been through there like 50,000 times. My camp is right there pretty much next to it.
---
The undrerarmor could be accidental. But the crafting ability disappearing is definitely a problem.
---
When you go to repair it, you press Y for Xbox, and you can then press X for a workbench repair or there‚Äôs other commands, such as to rename, there
---
There was a giant post a few months back on the whole T.O.W.N.S thing.  Search the sub for it as it was a good read with some great ideas.
---
I usually sell ammo for one cap each and for anything else I cut the suggested number that comes up in about half or more.
---
Oh cool
---
You've gotta get down and look into it... easy to miss.
---
You also can't sell spoiled goods to them, yet they will often sell them. We should report them to the food safety agency! Could it be that they are happily buying food but lack proper refrigerators? ;-)
---
If you do, i will bash you with commie basher!
---
The Faschnacht seasonal event, Nukashine (quest, daily quests, brewing and fermenting systems), Lying Lowe (quests, Encryptid event/imposter sheepsquatch), the Burrows, cameras, Ever Upwards (quest, daily quests, badges/challenges, backpacks), sheepsquatches, Free Range event, player vending machines, legendary vending system, and the Arktos pharmaceuticals event. Also included in all that is a ton of new weapons, recipes, and camp plans.
---
The one I'm talking about is in Sutton. A little by the Overseer's child home
---
This one isn't a different form. It's exactly the same exploit used before patch 5-6, that was reopened with the latest patches.
---
german translation ist pretty poor. like the game inself
---
In Fallout 4, some of the mods would cause all the grass to float in the air. 
---
I get it that this creates immersion issues, but no more than seeing some guy with an exe running around wearing a civil war dress and a bobblehead vault boy hat. 
---
In the grand scheme of things, I'm gonna suggest that this be very close to last on the list of things that Bethesda needs to address, only because there are actual gameplay issues that have yet to be resolved or fully resolved.  
---
In the interim, find a flat place for a camp or don't plant razorgrain.
---
My fav part was from episode 3 when it was too hot for the miners....
---
I mean I'm a melee build in every fallout so... Ya. Melee has disadvantages which is why it is "overpowered" you must be close up in which case you face more danger than say a ranged character. The things I read about unnarmed are rediculous because there is only 1 perk for unnarmed damage which balances it out to the other melee weapons.
---
That scene made me so sad üò≠ Poor animals.

learn recipes on other characters to get 76
---
I have an explosive shotgun I‚Äôve named Honey Boom Boom
---
Ooh. Never seen that one. I've got a character in Sutton right now. Will check it out.
---
There are literal mods out on the nexus that fixes most of the client side bugs. If we had access to the server software we'd have them fixed in less than a week as well.
---
Lot of these fixes are literally a single line of code to fix. Like the scrapping issue that used to be around. It literally was 1 line of code.
---
Just realized what a good name "The Liquidator" is for my rifle though...
---
SILVER LINING!!!

There's definitely been a dupe exploit out there for the past few weeks - if they really cared, they would have patched it out sooner.  This is just a normal release cycle, Tue got delayed to Thu due to the Mon US holiday this week.

Mission: the destruction of any and all Chinese communists.
---
One thing that points to it not being a glitch is that on the STAT-EFFECTS tab it shows a timed effect called "Excavator armor bonus - +200 CW." Perhaps it's a way to give a grace period to fast travel to a stash box upon reentering the game. I know I often quit because I'm over-encumbered and too tired to sort out my inventory.
---
‚ÄúStay out of my territory‚Äù -Heisenberg
---
That momma and litter...
---
I dunno why they didn't
---
True and in order to recover from that fast it‚Äôs important to eat the right items first to start it back up.
---
Yes, same issues. My item selection jumps around in the trade window often, sometimes setting the price on the wrong thing and sometimes trade randomly ends for no reason as well. It's been like this for a long time.
---
I you see a guy in a bathrobe face tanking the queen do him a kindness and kill the trash mobs around me, err, him.
---
It was the gardener badge. Completed it by respawning behind the Whitespring Service entrance, there‚Äôs one or two rabbits most of the time. Mostly dead though ;)
---
There‚Äôs nothing random about it. It‚Äôs a 20 hour clock specific to the player. 
---
The current system allows you to max out the vendors/purveyor 8.4 times per week‚Äîof one were so dedicated. What you‚Äôre asking for would reduce that to 7.
---
It's on the west side maybe a bit northish. 
---
There's a locked box and note and some equations if I remember right.
---
That's a good theory. I always assumed there was a lag issue related to packets of data going from the console to the server more slowly than I could click on the x.
---
Ammo... sell as cheap as you can.
---
Everything else? Up to you, but "less than suggested pricing" is optimum.
---
Yeah you pretty much nailed it my group of "tough guy enclave" all sounded like 13-14 year old I pictured a group of foul smelling little 1/2 wits in their mom's basement in Utah drinking code red and dreaming of touching their first boob.........
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/adatf9/actual_junk_weight_versus_bulk_weight_comparison/
---
Even if you're correct the point is still that the lose of .1 pounds per Bulk is so inconsequential it doesn't even matter. I have maybe 30-40 bulk items in my stash max. Dude you're talking 4 pounds most. You just lost 80 plastic for good. It disappears from your inventory. So minus the weight of that plastic and how much did you really loose?
---
It's almost as if it's hard!
---
Thanks I didn‚Äôt know this I‚Äôll have to peruse.
---
Gayyyy.. haha, kidding.

 I am from country that was in soviet union and old people around me are saying, that when commies were at power, their lives were better, this is great for young generation to make opinion (ofc it is film, so it is not 100% true, but still)

Yes.  But what it the item only comes to 45 and not 50.

In pervious FO versions, I always enjoyed finding places where I could jump off the map and explore. 
---
Haven't found any in 76.
---
The game forced to use responder outfit and of course I selected Firebreathers. I hope I don't die from radiation.
---
Depends entirely what they come up with as new effects for the 4th and 5th stars
---
If you make new characters and they learn recipes for the first time it counts. So you can just keep collecting recipes from the wasteland and pass them onto your alts just to learn. I did this quite a while back. Also works for learning weapons and armors mods challenge
---
Sure. Who do you want to fleece? Noobs in the Forrest or the schlubs at Whitespring? 
---
Too bad the Raiders are all dead. 
---
They could have easily supported us both all by themselves.
---
yea, I think you did all the mysteries quest.

Find the Mr(s) Handy type bot at Wavy Willards.

It'll give you a task to complete.
---
That's a totally different thing than citing a video game is breaking the law for not having a in game text chat option explicitly for deaf people. That's just totally a strawman.
---
I was more sad when i saw 4thousand slavic people cleaing graphit (dying in few dayis) because they didnt have good egouth robots.
---
Fuck HBO did great job.
---
It's all certainly become a bit overwhelming. I try to write down things I need to do/plan to do. It helps
---
Yes. Instigating/Executioners/Anti-Armor/Explosive/250 DR Reload Double Barrel Shotgun. That or just a regular 1 Star level 50 Vampire's Chainsaw. I wouldn't cry about Bloodied, Furious, Limb Damage and Strength being on there too, though.
---
I'd have to give the actual affixes some thought before deciding, but I can tell you before I get there, hell yes I'd do it. I have a much better understanding of how I want my build to progress, now, and could get there in half the time it took me the first go-around.
---
Lol, yeah, right there on the border of the Savage Divide and the Cranberry Bog, right? There's literally a fissure right there by Lake Eloise. Easily within aggro distance of a scorchbeast.
---
Remember to drink vodka, two litres a day. Stay hydrated!
---
There's a distinction if you're inflicting the pain on inanimate objects and game code ie. PvE then go crazy.  If you need your share of destruction for fun, there's plenty of cars to blow up in the Whitesprings.
---
That you can't see the difference and why this view about CAMP destruction is just plain wrong - well, that's a problem but I can't fix that for you.
---
Turd was doing this to me at the scrip machine at WS Station. Once I was done, his turn, just spammed him with plasma grenades (pacifist on).
---
He then tried to follow me around but chameleon + bush was more powerful apparently.
---
&gt;Plans are oversaturated at this point. That first week or so, it was easy to get 1k caps for a plan, but by now... 99% of them wont sell unless they are super cheap at 100 caps or so. I had over 700 plans stocked away for when player vending hit. Some I cannot even clear out at 10 caps.
---
I disagree. There are lots of plans that fly off the shelf for me regularly at 500+. Deep pocketed, ultralight mod plans for armor, BoS underarmor, halloween or civil war costumes, shielded BoS, expensive weapon plans like lever action or gauss rifle. I barely even bother picking up camp plans unless I know they're expensive like musical instruments. If you're trying to sell chemistry benches and single action ivory grips then yeah, you're not gonna have much business.
---
I have a bloodied explosive pipe pistol that would work great I will definitely logon after work and farm that location
---
Bloodied 5 Star Deathclaw Gauntlet - Assuming we get to pick perks with this I would want Swing Speed + 1 Strength - Reduced Weight - Less AP cost for power attacks.
---
Or... a bloodied shovel with the same :U GIVE ME THE SHOVEL
---
Edit : Why downvote? lol
---
Having a full set of Unyielding or Bolstering 3\* gear like others are suggesting is nice.... but I seriously doubt you have gear like that just starting out using Bloodied.
---
Find some power armor and get the Emergency Protocol mod for the chest piece. You'll die a lot less until you can move to a non-power armor gear set.
---
And I'm going the Big Pharma route with my meth. 
---
Why hide from the cops when there arnt any?
---
I'll come for you with my shovel.
---
I understand, but the game bar is on pc. Has chat and voice chat
---
Try it, it works natively anywhere on windows 10 with no processing cost. It's already installed automaticly. Windows key + G at same time
---
Nice to see that we got down-voted... fun part of the community.
---
What about bloodied melee/unarmed?
---
And again, nobody is obsessing over you. You‚Äôre the only one with an unhealthy autistic obsession.
---
&gt;  I have scrounged and traded and shopped for weight reduction robot and raider pieces for my "scrap demon" that lives in the savage divide with bone charms decorating the house I've built as a raider bar.
---
Either im really unlucky or there's only like 20 of you actually role playing.   OP's experience and your last paragraph describe every instance of having my workshop contested within 30seconds of taking it, having my CAMP destroyed pre-changes, and getting followed around SLAPed pre-changes.  The majority of people claiming to be "RPing as raiders" are using it as an excuse be jerks.
---
Considering how upset most "raiders" get when being politely asked what they paid for their explosive gun or assassin/sent armor I'd imagine they get real upset when their precious OP gear doesn't get them the easy kill they were expecting.
---
You think there is talent at Bethesda?
---
Such a good episode.
---
Any weapon would be level 50 even if they currently don't drop that way.
---
No it isn't. Just tried it, nothing came up.
---
I think non instanced loot is gone once it's picked up and I don't know when it refreshes. I remember once I was in the forest during verdant season and found an unusually large amount of "rare" junk like vault tec alarm clocks and such.
---
It‚Äôs not you.  It‚Äôs me. I have haters.
---
When your WPM is -10.
---
Have you even heard of Fallout 2?
---
I don't really view it as proper NPCs. More like static quest givers. No dialogue options, you're told what to do and given a choice but cant negotiate it. Personally I like how players semi function as a stand in for classic NPCs. We give eachother fetch quests, help eachother out and fight amongst eachother. 
---
There are problems, and there is never going to be a way to make everyone happy. But it has an older feel to it, like morrowind, where you were given a journal entry and some vague directions and that was it. You HAVE to explore some times.
---
I also like the factions idea, maybe like an alt to survivor mode, where instead of guild you pick a faction, like the way pvp works in ESO when you're at the Emperial City. 
---
Weekly quests that pertain to an enemy faction instead of constant photo hunts. Your faction can't do accidental damage and there are safe zones, but travelling in groups or even for raiders a Zerg style swarm is incentivized, like actual societies roaming the wastes.
---
Discounts/markups at certain venderbots and faction specific building items would be interesting too, something that can be worked around with the right charisma perk or two.
---
Based on character (I have 5)
---
With a couple of them, I claim a workshop, first thing... preferably one near the location I am exploring, so I have two fast travel points. I can farm plans this way too... with every defense event that happens. One character jumps in on EVERY defense event that pops up on map no matter who owns the workshop... so many plans this way. Then? Depends on that character from that point on...
---
My Mad Doc is building his wasteland clinic, so that's priority for him. Mats, caps, junk, farming copper to sell in bulk. The rest is just CAMP building. 
---
My survivalist character? He wanders the woods near home, clearing out enemies and keeping the place safe. His exploration radius grows with every day.
---
My melee character? All I do with that guy is spend all my time trying to make him and his CAMP as creepy and freaky as I can, within game restraints. No plan other than "what do I need right now".
---
My Ghoul-Scav character... he's hardcore "house rules" role-playing character. Really tough to play. He just explores and survives. Super-mobile CAMP, moves constantly. No need to build, constantly moving, doing whatever pops up and catches interest. Explores every area he encounters.
---
No it isn't, it is the exact same as crosswalks that click so blind people can find them, or crosswalks that flash for deaf people to be able to see them. Same with numerous others. The same law that makes companies include wheelchair ramps and handicapped parking also include accommodations for the deaf and blind.
---
Bullies will be bullies - what you do in a game is a reflection of yourself.  I'm not calling for bans and nerfs - just letting people know their own mental state of affairs.  Of course these people often can't comprehend how they look to others, so continue living in denial if you want to.  It doesn't change how you look to others.
---
Well one of the first duping methods that got patched involved overloading the server with crafting requests. I presume their "fix" was to implement a throttle of sorts, preventing us from spam-crafting. Because yeah, I remember being able to cook as fast as the server could keep up, but now there seems to be a 1-2 second lag between each successful crafting attempt.
---
I am glad you got your pet!
---
Not with pack rat 3. with pack rat 3 you save much more by bulking. Dude above already went and double checked in game yesterday. Steel absolutely saves weight by bulking, same with lead, aluminum, and oil.
---
  The experience I relate predates your time frame, and applies to both Windows and Mac OS.
---
I had that problem with more than one game on both platforms, especially common with older games.
---
  Since changing to playing exclusively on console, have always been able to play, regardless of the age of the game, or how many updates were done to the console.
---
You missed a star how about 40% more power attack damage.
---
Bluing is a traditional way of preserving steel on rifles. The "blue" tint is from the thin layer of magnetite, and is authentic.
---
It's the reason I'm using that skin, atm.
---
Fuck no.
---
WHERE
---
To reach that lake not only would I need to reach a height thats above a sky scraper I would also have to go past the relay tower I'm nowhere near that lake.
---
Is it the same for Purveyor as well?
---
On explosive version (legacy), yes, it destroys durability hilariously fast because it's applying explosive affect on every piece of the hit. That's also why they are great for pvp - crazy amount of stagger.
---
pack rat? You mean it saves weight while on your person? Yeah but not in your stash?
---
You got me there. Thank you for the information! Ya learn something new every day :)
---
I did say 99% :-) and I wasn't real keen on giving away ALL my best sellers, got to hold something back.
---
I've seen bigger camps than some of the "settlements" in fallout 4.
---
RP'ing seems like the best way to play.  
---
I guess I need to give my character some more... character.
---
Nope currently a bug that lets pack rat effect bulked stuff in stash, but only with bulked stuff.

Saw one go for 25,000 and laughed and checked 30 min later and saw that someone bought it.

2k for both pieces together would be fine.

*stupid test.*
---
NIce, scrap it for 5 leather now

I agree I could level up much faster and have a better build.
---
you have windows 10 ? maybe you have disabled the bar before the update. Just click the windows icon bottom left, type game bar. You should find the option, just enable it again
---
I wouldn't call a PvP system where you can kill a player with a single shot or hit balanced (Sometimes not even having to actually land a hit at all thanks to explosive legendary effects). As for power armor, isnt this Fallout? Power armor is supposed to make you very tough, not an easy kill. The fact that being in power armor is supposed to be a viable choice but actually puts you at a severe disadvantage is the definition of unbalanced.
---
I named my deathclaw gauntlet Dr. Grant.
---
Hah I dont think I gave much away, good luck finding half of those ;) And I didnt give everything away lol.
---
I am surprised that this question has been raised at all. ;)
---
we have the same problem with the canadien french (quebec)
---
I wish workshops were extremely worth it - like if you take hemlock holes, you should be getting 600 acid per hour, not 60. Make the workshops the absolute best at getting some of these materials, and they will always be taken and contested.
---
Some bugs are easier to fix than others, and yes some bugs have priority based on how they impact the game.
---
Level 198 and I still have yet to get an AAE, TSE, Or BE weapon to drop. The only thing I‚Äôve gotten is a VE Harpoon gun. And it‚Äôs amazing, but I don‚Äôt use it.
---
Me too!!!
---
Dodgy 3 burns 30 AP per hit. Depending on your AP that is only 5-7 hits or so.
---
I mean, I think you miss my point. Most of the armor you pointed out was 1. Used for sneaking or 2. Just mentioned both Assassins and Cav/Sent in different combos. 
---
For 1, of course being stealthy keeps you from being killed. But if you‚Äôre taking blows, you‚Äôll be taking significantly more damage than if you were running an assassins set. By meat, I didn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôd be instant killed or couldn‚Äôt compete, I meant you would be being taking significantly more damage than you would otherwise. 
---
If you‚Äôre going to be PvPing and want to survive a barrage of hits, you‚Äôll want Cav/Sent Assassins Armor.
---
No, windows 7, windows 10 sucks, tries way too hard to be a mobile OS.
---
What kind of damage do you think that chainsaw would do?
---
Bullet shield and blocker are not that useful on a HW/PA build, once you get all perked up with a good gun, not much gets close enough to melee you and PA is very tough anyway. Bullet shield is utterly useless.
---
Power patcher isn‚Äôt need for daily use, just useful for repairs. PA breaks very slowly. 
---
For Enclave roleplay I‚Äôd say use a plasma gat; it‚Äôs not quite as good as a 50cal, but it fits the role and is much better than laser gat. That also means you can swap power patcher for Batteries Included (if you plan on carrying a lot of ammo; plasma cores are about 1lb each). 
---
Not sure what I‚Äôd swap the str cards for; at the very least dump bullet shield. Get a weight reduction utility card, or a fun card like pain train, or even Lock and Load for faster reloads (not majorly useful on many heavy weapons as you don‚Äôt reload all that often, but still better than bullet shield).
---
The other cards are fine; if you aren‚Äôt running a low health HW build, mutations are kind of ‚Äúeh‚Äù, so keeping or losing them isn‚Äôt game breaking, so class freak and starched genes aren‚Äôt essential.
---
I named my first legendary knife "Stabitha", but that was many levels ago. Now I hang with "Shank Sinatra".
---
that's been all handled years ago. Windows 10 is a nice os now, but I understand that you love 7.
---
5* Bloodied explosive lever action, with 33% vats hit chance, +50% vats crit damage, and 25% less vats acrion cost.
---
Unless you're also talking about losing learned plans/recipes, then F that noise.
---
All great ideas!!
---
With the right build, pretty damn good damage.
---
It's not really that funny. It almost feels more like an inside joke of knowing *that* couch...
---
Yeah, why not. Just would have everything stored on a mule anyway.
---
One hit from the glowing wendigo at the Imposter Sheepsquatch location fully drains my AP to zero for some reason, stopped using dodgy since
---
I would have shot a player like you instantly but that isn't possible if the cowards commit their acts in adventure mode.
---
Maybe 2 major modifiers like bloodied and anti armor on the same weapon.
---
First thing I do every day, is go through my dailies involving the possum repeatable quests, Biv's, scrap legendaries for scrip, sell my 1400 caps worth of junk/serums I've made to vendor bots... and then I begin wandering aimlessly to random events or hopping around player camps.
---
I do, and that doesn't alter the fact that putting junk in the stash sometimes increases the weight more than the reduction taking the same junk out. The example quoted isn't due to perk cards.
---
They are not. They want you to buy the atoms. Not earn them.
---
I did it this morning at the swimming challenge Spruce Knob lake, had the fright of my life when a queen popped out and killed me though so had to dispatch her before letting the rad roaches take me out for a proper revive.
---
Windows 10 is still far too resource intensive and has way too much bloatware. Win7 ultimate is a much better OS for a gaming system. As you don't have to deal with the shitty UI and lack of taskbar.
---
Not to mention that windows 10 is HORRIBLE for legacy gaming for any game that was released prior to 2000.
---
Me- "don't wander around whitesprings, don't wander around whitesprings"

---
You would lose everything
---
But not all of them deal with server maintenance, and they could rotate servers. They already do some server maintenance that way.
---
Works for me
---
Added to that, can you imagine the worry and excitement if you were playing responder and the next time you log in a bunch of nomadic raider camps were placed near yours. How you would have to get your friends to help defend yourself and your camp or move closer to keep eachother safe.
---
I think they're working on a new one now but I'm not sure.
---
My first PC had a whopping 128k of ram and a screaming fast 8 Mhz processor :)
---
I find it adds some "Life" to the game. Playing it on rails, heading for "best gear, best weapon, capscapscapscaps"... gets dull. 
---
This game has a *really* solid base for some cool character interaction and roleplaying... as it stands, RP'ing characters is still kind of rare it seems... so I tend to play it with the idea of being an "NPC" for other players. I try to set up CAMPs that seem "part of the world", or "tell a story", etc.
---
Excuse me, did I hear Garvey? I believe you are talking about me, Ashton Garvey. I have recently started a faction called Minutemen: protect the people at a minute's notice!
---
Oh no, they started a turf war... :)
---
But you are, you've come here by stalking my profile, made no input to the relevant topic and instead blatantly lied and dragged me into a petty little argument.
---
I like your thinking
---
Of course! It's every single developer who is wrong! Fuck them and not the market that puts a constant demand on things that leads to the consumer never being happy and makes the creators pull massive amounts of overtime to finish deadlines with little to no thanks!
---
Probably still yes. I'm unusual in that I kind of enjoy crafting/scrapping for mods, but it would hurt losing the serum recipes, knowing that they can't be farmed anymore.
---
And all I can think of is Biv, I mean uh, Bender dressed up as a bee, dancing out profane messages.
---
Also, John Dimaggio is TOTALLY the voice of Biv. There's no way it's not the original drunken party robot voicing our favorite brain in a jar.
---

You do realize that exploits are just... bugs, right?

It's stuff doing something that wasn't intended, so patching that unexpected and undesirable behavior is not at all significantly different from patching other unexpected and undesirable behavior.

---
The .50 cal is the king of heavy weapons right now. Hell, it's the king of all ranged weapons for sustained dps. Reasonable accuracy, ammo isn't too awful to craft, lasts forever (it already had good durability, but after buffs... it's just insane how long it lasts), and highest dps in game. Gatling Plasma would be slightly higher dps with a lot of other drawbacks, but as others have stated, it doesn't benefit from armor penetration. so it's just way behind.
---
Do you by chance have your doors locked and a possibility of people spawning inside?
---
I have an explosive shotgun. I named it "Collateral Damage". Theres a perk that decreases explosion damage you take by 45% I think, basically required.
---
There's a hide spawn in the little workbench nook at the ski lodge by top of the world. I found one there.

Yah, **but**, you don't have a lead-scrap jockstrap to protect your delicate, rad sensitive, jibbly bits.

to this day I still find my self looking in all the dog houses for more neat stuff.. I loved that one..
---
Don't forget to check all the Franklin stoves..
---
Exactly why I want them to fix the damn armor pen. I really enjoy using mine on queen, but it's not optimal by a long shot.
---
You realize dupes are still in the game and being used daily right? Why do you think legacy weapons are all over the place now?
---
So since they can't get rid of the dupes they might as well at least fix the bugs they can fix instead of wasting their time failing over and over to get rid of duping.
---
i still have hopes for an earlier hotfix. but that's maybe just me. i also believe in easter bunnies and santa claus lol\^\^
---
You are a super star of the wasteland. Wish I could upvote 17 times.
---
&gt;The server thing will just be the usual problems with the game I think.
---
Yeah, I don't think support for absolutely massive inventories was in scope when they built 76. It's a drawback of "**carry weight**" inventory systems where you can have an arbitrary number of wildly different items in your inventory so long as you stay below a certain total inventory weight threshold versus "**bag slot**" inventory systems where you only have a certain amount of inventory slots and item weight isn't a factor.
---
It‚Äôs nice to know players are generous.  Every single time I take that plant someone contests it and takes it from me.  Every.  Single.  Time.

---
Talking some serious caps there to replace those recipes.
---
If they do that then they really don‚Äôt care about balancing &amp; need to just buff laser weapons big &amp; get it over with.
---
They didn't until they decided that sticks and stones broke didn't break our bones but dirty words will hurt us....
---
i dont understand? is this a loose interpretation of the 5 black guys behind the tiny white woman? if so its doing a bad job
---
Not all bugs are created equal. Both from the work required to fix them, or their impact on the overall experience. Then there's balancing bug fixes with working on new content and trying not to fall too far behind. Making/fixing games is difficult and time consuming for many reasons, and unexpected issues are always hard to manage. 
---
I think it's obvious that fixing exploits is more important than fixing broken challenges. 
---
But why haven't challenges been fixed yet? Challenge issues seem to be tied to deep problem with the dynamic system that makes them, since they're pulling data from content that isn't in the game yet. I don't know why, and neither does anybody else here, but they have a huge economic incentive to fix them, as the fruits of challenges entice people to spend money on Atoms.
---
It doesn't matter if someone gets Atomic Shop items by spending money or completing challenges, they're still advertising Atomic Shop content by walking around with those items, or putting them in their camp. The less people getting Atomic Shop items from challenges, the less advertising those items get. So, you can be sure that they're working on it.

ESO is the third most popular MMO today, which is, by most metrics PRETTY POPULAR. Warframe has a smaller player count, but has an extremely dedicated and niche fanbase. And Steam charts is useless, I have only used it because you brought it up first with wrong numbers. Warframe has 60K concurrent users, but isn't as popular as ESO, which only 20K concurrent users, meanwhile Fallout 4 only has 13k. Meanwhile ESO has more concurrent players on Xbox then Warframe and Fallout 76 has more then either. There are no reliable or consistent metric by which to measure player counts except the assurance that given ESO is the third most populace MMO in the current market and it's extremely successful on consoles as well, with a thriving, healthy and growing player base, that any game above it needs to have tens of thousands of players at any given time, which amount to hundred of thousands of unique logins and on any given month.
---
So. Again. Lets sum this up. You are wrong about sales, you are wrong about player numbers, you toss away talking points on a dime when they don't suit your need. You're the one asserting Fallout 76 has a small and dying player base, the burden of proof is on you, not me, I've just been bothering to check what you've claimed to realize it's not accurate.
---
Steam charts- Not reliable
---
Statista- Not reliable
---
VGcharts- Not reliable
---
Reddit posts about Fallout for cheap- Not reliable
---
Fallout 76 having a higher player count then multiple successful online games with hundreds of thousands of monthly players- Reliable
---
can i ask you something off-topic? i see a lot of ppl here with tags next to their names, like yours showing "brotherhood"...how do you guys get that? or how do you put that on? thx in advance for an answer.
---
I'll admit that I'm guilty of this, though it's almost entirely "rare" outfits and hats. And I do have a big glowy sign on the wall behind said vendorage that sez "Costume"... I can't afford the 's' due to budgetary concerns.
---
Been every time I launch it since a patch or two ago
---
I've gotten 2 TSE's off the purveyor since she has been out. Also 2 AAE and a bunch of different Bloodied weapons as well.  So not very rare, the rarest I've found to be Quad's.
---
You know, I bet making a mod for this wouldn't be too hard.
---
man this wasteland is so fucking facked!
---
How about a 3* legendary foes drop 3* legendary items weekend. No... a week or maybe a month(s)? Todd?
---
This is 7/10 of my encounters like this.
---
One time, a four person squad decided to have one person off team follow them while playing the Halloween movie theme over area chat while announcing the battle and "how badass this is going to be when they put it on YouTube".
---
I didn't fair so well on that one.
---
You missed the part where the creation engine doesn't support more than one card :P
---
FO76 is designed very differently to others like Fortnite.
---
Server updates can be updated live. But the servers only hold/manage game data like your character metadata, inventory, events, player locations etc.
---
Things like bugs, visuals and anything gameplay related, live in the game client, which is on your local console/PC. So the only way to update that is to stop the game and download an update for it.
---
Basically it wouldn't be possible.
---
Source: I'm a server engineer.
---
In the first 5 minutes I spent logged in to survival for the challenge, I somehow ended up #3 on the leaderboard and had some guy with a TSE handmade show up outside my camp, oneshot me, and start grenading my camp. 
---
Get rid of the map markers and I will happily play Survival.
---
Oh, is there now a fucked up thing with the compass enemy indicators in PVP? I somehow ended up in PVP with a couple players at the end of a Uranium Fever event (they were a team, one had pacifist off because I kept getting ‚Äúattacked by‚Äù notices, I accidentally swiped one as the event finished and I also had pacifist off).
---
I hit revenge, they were already back at the whitesprings station, but literally as soon as I left the mine, I had 2 red markers on my compass, i was a good 500 feet away from them with absolutely 0 line of sight. I only assume they had the same because they ran over to me as I was crouched and looking at my inventory, and killed me again.
---
Is this a new thing for PVP?
---
Seeing as they are still the top dps weapons, yes they are still god tier even with the nerf.
---
OI! NEVER ENOUGH DAKKA!
---
is it you todd?\^\^
---
I wouldve done the same
---
Yes, that is still in the game. Just like numerous others.
---
If I have someone on my PC who has access to my files, I have bigger problems than my password to Bethesda
---
i also feel that stuff loading up takes longer. as now it sometimes takes close to a minute to fully load the camp lol
---
Agreed a super job on the mini series always new it was bad never new it was that bad..  The robot problem was more of the gov own making lying about the amount of actual rads only 2000 when actual amount was 12-14000 yikes I wonder if that bot can handle ------- nope .... thinking to myself how much it would suck to do that job for 90 secs knowing your pretty doomed to die of cancer after the fact..
---
I didn‚Äôt come through your profile, you‚Äôre kinda hard to miss since you‚Äôre in every thread relating to PCs talking about how you prefer consoles. 
---
You can post whatever you want, but all I‚Äôm
---
saying is you just look like a weirdo with a strange vendetta against PC gaming.
---
Just share the knowledge with other players so they know how to do it also. Still kind of sketchy to have your login and pass saved in plain text document, but what do you expect with bethesda. Pretty sure the "remember me" saved the info in plain text as well.
---
Unyielding with bloody adds 2 per piece.  Serums can add about 8-10 more with strange in numbers. My agility is 13.
---
I don't think they are planning to do this ( unless Todd is lurking around this reddit for ideas) just killing time at lunch and thought of this.
---
15 agility and 15 from unyielding puts you at 30 right away. Add in marsupial, and maybe herd mentality with strange in numbers (+3) and you get a ton. I run 34 luck on my bloodied vats build- crit every other shot, with the right perks!
---
Totally agree, all online games should have 2fa in my opinion. üëçüëçüëç
---
I will test this tonight. It doesn't really matter to me. My stuff gets bulked so that I can be organized and sell to a vendor.
---
Citizen sniiiippppppssssss!
---
fully agree. let's hope for it be done asap
---
Sneak attack. All three Rifleman cards maxed. Bloody Mess 3. You are looking at 2070 damage or so on that initial hit.
---
Build up some crit and Adrenaline on the sorched adds that always follow one around and the damage really starts to climb. Aim for the head in VATs and you are pushing almost 7k damage.
---
Where are you getting this info that fo76 is more popular than ESO? I hope you aren't talking about that first link you shared that said fallout 4 was more popular than fo76 also.
---
Where did I said it was an excuse to them? I simply pointed out it was a possible explanation, and that it's a know situation.
---
Nope, fully open camp.
---
'Tis a solid idea!
---
thanks for adding this. seems it's definitely all non-english versions of the game.
---
Just did some simple testing on my own by adding more pieces. The first 3 are really noticeable even with action girl and fine tuned. There is an older reddit post with a lot of timing details.
---
It's not weird. Everyone at the company has a pile of shit to work on. When a huge exploit is found that will ruin the game, it goes to the top of someone's pile.
---
I agree I'd love to see them fix a lot of the bugs that exist, but saying they should fix them before they fix duplication exploits is a bad take.
---
It is a minimalistic version of the age ol butt of many jokes: [loss.](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/loss)
---
Well seems like it could be repurposed easily
---
I'd also say the weight of something in your stash will appear as the weight it would be as though it was on character but it's actually weight is still the original weight without my Perks and armor. Stimpacks say they are lighter than they are in my stash. As for bulked items I will test this tonight.
---
Aye my Fallout 76 got deleted by my brother, so it‚Äôs gonna be 12 hours to downloadüòÇ oh well I‚Äôll message you on psn when it‚Äôs done!
---
a Bird?
---
i hope it will be one with only all the advantages, and without any disadvantage in terms of freedom and unique huge living world.
---
hey, relax.
---
Just got a Quad gauss rifle myself yesterday
---
I turn on the PS4 while I‚Äôm cooking dinner, check atom shop and decide on a character to play.  Sort inventory while eating and scrip what I can, then make a plan for the evening.
---
Then something shiny will distract me, and the next thing I know I‚Äôve spent 3 hours aimlessly wandering, and it‚Äôs time to close up shop for the night.
---
I received 3 max level exploding shotguns last night from another player, I'm a heavy gunner so they are not my style...
---
They are in my store
---
PC: ign FarPlace should be on tonight maybe 5pm Central
---
Resource points have been hopelessly nerfbat for a long time. Even when they weren't, the Coveted (typo intentional) Munitions Factory was surprisingly unmolested most of the time.
---
The problem there is how wonky the mechanics were. As a defender, you fill the area with garbage and concrete in the work bench to skyrocket the attacker's wanted level. Don't waste time with turrets because they're useless. On the other side, depending on which patch it was, you either PVP with an unkillable level 20 or you had someone LW+Sentinel perched on your bench staring you down.
---
Don't know what to tell you, sounds like it's your end because I'm not having any issues with it. Maybe reinstall the launcher.
---
you are using it as an excuse, and you are "pointing out" an unlikely situation as if it needed to be pointed out.
---
Keep in mind storing login credentials in a basic text file is considered pretty lousy security. 
---
Safety &gt; convenience
---
Yeah played it. couldn't get into it. 
---
Not sure why, coulda been too hard, or I didnt understand it. I didnt like it but I like games like Divinity, Pillars, Diablo Mutant and such.
---
That's part of it. Whoever wrote Eagle Eyes probably didn't realise that the initial "critical multiplier" value is 2, not 1. Hence Eagle Eyes (x1.25) raises the multiplier to 2.5, versus 2.4 for Better Crits 3 (+0.4).
---
The remaining block is that the core VATS crit mechanics are still unknown. Need some basic (no perk/mutation) tests against various DR and damage reduction values.
---
Oh...Bloodied builds...
---
It‚Äôs so unfunny and overdone and the ‚Äúexclusiveness‚Äù makes it funny
---
If you are level 191 caps should be no issue to you. I've had 20k+ caps since level 100 (185 now) and have absolutely nothing to spend em. I jump around all the camps and look what they have to sell. 95% of time they have nothing I want/need and I just move on.
---
Even if I visit all the camps in one server and go the most idiotic route (long jumps instead of going to the closest ones), I would still spend less than 1000 caps. Taking some of my junk I can sell them to robot vendors for 1500 caps.
---
Making caps is so easy in this game. After one hour of playing you get enough junk to sell for 1500 caps with Barter perk.
---
So why are you complaining about spending few dozens of caps to visit some other players camp?
---
Bloodied, Quad, explosive, faster fire rate, faster reload railway rifle.
---
Or
---
Bloodied, AA, limb damage, SS, +S buzzblade
---
Its on your local machine rather than a server. Not worth hackers' time to poke local machines when servers can give tens of thousands of logins in one go.
---
ah... man... loved that last 2
---
Yeah, I haven't seen any nukes in the last week and a 1/2 so have dropped a couple myself
---
I picked up a 3 star Bone Hammer the other day and named it Bam Bam.
---
Just rolled the dice after server maintenance. Out of the 12 ranged weapons I got, the only one that‚Äôs remotely useful is a two shot fatman. Who am I gonna stalk with that Stalker‚Äôs Black Power Rifle she gave me? Maybe mama murmur herself?
---
I'm not 100 on this, but Iirc I read somewhere that they only count if you've found them in the wild. 2 spawn at top of the world ski resort pretty frequently on the 2nd lvl outside of buildings on a table. One is the building with the vendor, and other is building you cannot enter closest to the train station. Also 1 spawns at the little raider camp closest to the train station, on the 1st table to your right.
---
By finding magazines while exploring... got my trophy by finding a spawn point for a single magazine and then serverhopping...
---
You dont need to restart your entire computer for an ini change to Fallout 76 to take effect.
---
I've done my reading in that regard, and have come to a different conclusion on the driving force of the war.
---
True. Just restart the program.
---
You're probably right.  I was a little shocked it launched with only 3 things in it.  Funny thing is there aren't a lot of people doing those 3 even after the terminal was launched.  I know this cause I make a killing on alcohol recipes and bug mounts.
---
Smart business.
---
Yeah sure you just happened to come to barely upvoted post on a sub you've probably never visted and ignored every single comment except mine and just decided to reply to me with post totally irrelevant to the actual thread, with the sole intention of picking a fight lol
---
I will if you‚Äôre on PS4. That hunters long coat is my easiest cap maker. Server hop in the same spot for 1 hour a day and I‚Äôll usually come out with at least 3 hunters long coats 1-2 longshoreman outfit, and the standard clean spacesuit clean straight jacket winter and jeans jacket etc. The guy above you is right, the Charleston cosmetics are fairly easy to get. It‚Äôs not really a big deal to server hop in this game, to be productive at a high level and farm legendaries you‚Äôre going to have to server hop. You don‚Äôt need to live on a marketplace either. I understand it took you 150 levels until you saw one. Others that will be the first vendor they walk to. Everyone‚Äôs basing it on their experience, and with how many of those coats are out there, I would go to say they aren‚Äôt rare at all. MAYBE uncommon, but they are not rare, they don‚Äôt have a .02% drop rate like other items.
---
Y‚Äôall are ruthless. Some of us are just trying to give the average players a break.
---
No doubt some people/countries had it better than others under the communists and as you age you tend to forget some of the bad stuff so I am not surprised.  I have enjoyed the show and if nothing else it shows how a large bureaucracy where many leaders are more concerned with their own power than anything else struggles to cope with difficult realities.
---
Wait encrypted like the imposter sheepsquanch event? That one takes forever.
---
I could be wrong; but am describing the initial cost of an item as-assigned to a player-vendor (or in your inventory). I do not believe that is impacted by Charisma or perks.
---
I don‚Äôt think so. I didn‚Äôt know about pets and came upon a camp with a death claw and unloaded on it. Nothing happened.
---
It's inexcusable too. Yet, I'm still going to keep buying their games, bug-ridden and all. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ^send ^help
---
I thought it was just me.....ah Bethesda how I love and equally hate you
---
Steam manages to do both. That's the bar to aim for.
---
because you asked why
---
It can't result in a reward like the other badges though, otherwise it could end up being an easier path to backpack plans, and being an asshole shouldn't pay....
---
How about being an asshole has an effect like being well rested? If you one shot a legendary during an event when other people are also there then your picture tag on the maps gets changed / rng gets worse for you / etc.....and it has a 20hr cool down like everything else...might need a three strikes rule to weed out accidents though...
---
Oh look, another PC only feature.
---
Throw on that perk that makes music chime for magazines and do a run from Whitesprings up to Top of the World stopping at each named location along the way and you should get 10-15 world magazines easy.  As for revives, run harder events like AWOL or project paradise and wait for the bloodied builds to die (I die so much).   Then revive em.  As for joining teams, if you‚Äôre not much of a team player, identify a player vendor who‚Äôs at their camp and send them a team invite.  I will usually accept because I assume they‚Äôre just wanting a free ride to view my wares.  Others accept my requests all the time.  Hope that helps!
---
Let me start by say i agree, but and this is a big but... they said with player paragon levels they will have new perk cards for the higher tier players. This means the advanced +1 playthrough perks may be completely different, including passives for all we know.
---
I agree with our first playthrough being tough (still want adjustments though), but if all the weight perks and such become just 1 special point for max level of it i don't see a huge issue. Its why they aren't replying to any of these posts. They will fix it with nuclear winter.
---
That's the part I guess I get confused at the most.
---
The mechanics are _so friggin' bad_ at any level, attacking or defending, that I will never understand the internet badassery involved in PVP.
---
Don't even look at the life bars. Just swing away and let it tell you if Serendipity, Dodgy, a turret, Sentinel, etc even procced by whether or not you died..... _if_ it isn't first-shot-wins. I don't "feel good" winning and it feels worse losing because you have no idea if RNG and bad mechanics killed you or a better build.
---
Survival is slightly better because you can engage at range, but Adventure/OG 76 PVP is just faceroll-keyboard silliness.
---
I'm in the same boat as you.
---
There are raider role players, and there are assholes, but raiders arent' inherently assholes. Unfortunately it's the assholes that leave a more lasting impression and make themselves stand out more, then hide behind the raider name when they get called out.
---
I understand the workload for them is horrible, but challenges can‚Äôt be completed 6 months after launch that‚Äôs a bit crazy you have to admit
---
EDIT: also a huge fan of this game played since launch and I do appreciate the progress they‚Äôve made with this game. It‚Äôs just irritating to see servers constantly closed for duping and never for bugs
---
&gt; purveyor
---
He was added last week?
---
the Melee vats thing is beyond irritating!
---
If you're not aware, there's a Speedy Receiver MOD/upgrade for it; REALLY makes a difference!  I don't like .50 cal machine guns at all but love the Gatling (carrying two at the moment lol - An Executioner to finish off BIG creatures and an explosive junkie to start in on them with)
---
I had my front two lamps. Oddly they were through a wall which had my vendor machine on it. So no idea it was taking their power.
---
That's a relief, thank you for answering. :)
---
I'd take 5\* Handmade Furious Anti-Armor explosive with +25% RoF, +10% damage when aiming
---
I'd take a account wipe for that item.
---
Wouldn't mind if I didn't have plans to mod it at level 1 as when I get to level 50 I would have all the mods. Know what to do now as I did not know 6 months ago.
---
The easy lower risk dupes were patched out.   If you know of more dupes I suggest you let the devs know.  If you did and they are not taking action make them public.
---
The perks will be different in the next prestige.
---
There's one bug/exploit on the Excavator I'd really like them not to fix, even though it's pretty miner.
---
Why would people down vote this?
---
Bloodied/bloodied/bloodied/explosive/faster-fire-rate ultracite gatling laser.
---
Yes - 3x bloodied damage with explosive and faster fire rate.  I'll be melting everything soon enough - no mules, no cheating, will be totally worth the while!
---
River Trick: equip a rad suit and spam collect until you run out of inventory space.
---
Hwhat
---
This would be insane plus I think you only need steel to craft the ammo.
---
I‚Äôve been noticing griefers like that lately, but it‚Äôs my own decision to engage/fight for my workshop. You can tell their level before you fast travel over to see if it‚Äôs worth your while to contest. I like PVP a whole 0%, but I don‚Äôt think it should be completely blocked because of my personal opinion, especially when it‚Äôs a players choice to enter into PVP or Survival mode.
---
You could always roll the dice and hope for a good mutation.
---
... You know exactly that, given you apparently looked at it long enough before to pull up a bunch of random games to try and prove your point. Yes, Microsoft's official website lists Fallout 76 as having a higher player count then ESO.
---
For a full set of 5* yeah.
---
Good to know, thanks for sharing.
---
...and here I am wanting more baseball/Americana themed items. I know there‚Äôs a dingy baseball uniform and hat, but I‚Äôd like more baseball themed items. I, too, would spend stupid amount of atoms for it.
---
They did a good job, lot more interesting now.
---
So I was looking through the events that happen in West Virginia IRL during the summer.  Honey Bee appreciation day occurs on August 17th, it would be cool if they did stuff for this.
---
If I was going to wear an outfit over the armor I would pick a stronger set of armor. Guess I'll either have to use a different chest piece or learn to love it
---
Dude.. it‚Äôs still the highest damage per shot major modifier on legendaries with zero investment required. You‚Äôre nuts to think it‚Äôs unusable lol.
---
You've always been able to change your username on Xbox. And I'm pretty sure PlayStation just added that feature or will be in the near future.
---
If this was anywhere near something like EVE......
---
That could be amazing. But it's not. :\
---
I left him because he was a monster lol
---
Guess I'll have to test it then. Maybe there's hope
---
That person that posted the video did everyone a favor - its far more widespread of a problem, and all the video person did is raise awareness to cause a fix to be applied.
---
I dont accept Shrek's in this house
---
3‚≠ê Armor almost exclusively ü§£ gotta get me that Scout yo!
---
I know you guys heard on the internet, that our games have bugs, that it doesn't just...work... But let me tell you... it just works.
---
If this was like Ark it could be amazing!!! But it's not I feel the pain :(
---
Had a Mr. Gutsy blow up on me last night and luckily my 65 yr old heart was OK. Lol!
---
How many have we had so far? I started playing a few days before the last one started and I made it from lvl 20ish to 55ish in one weekend.
---
Just wondering how often we get 2x exp.
---
And, why are you dressed like Indianapolis Jones?!?
---
No prob, but got new info haha. The alt that i had discovered the locations with may have done so before the issue was fixed. guess it's not retroactive. Gonna try making a fresh alt and use that n see if it works
---
It‚Äôs not my cup of tea, but I can see it being fun for people who like the challenge of being able to combat other players, don‚Äôt mind the risk of being killed at any given point, and otherwise like the added survival aspect of not everyone you meet being an ally.
---
Question will a regular found (monster drop) assaultron head revert to a one star or is it only stuff from the purveyor?
---
And you get half the ammo you use back if you loot the bodies.
---
some a-hole was punching me in the head at Watoga TS the other day as i was trying to sell 2 things,  that was allot of good junk i got from his cadaver.
---
The wave has already occurred, people knew there was something out there about 2-3 weeks ago.  The video probably gave Bethesda the clues they needed to patch it out, but the damage is done already.
---
Yes. Bloodied AA +50%crit explosive less vats cost handmade or laser rifle
---
 [**u/RFxcGinni3**](https://www.reddit.com/user/RFxcGinni3/)  \-- Could you let me know your GT, whether you on PC, Xbox or PS4, the Time zone and time you are planning to do the Encryptid event. Also can you accommodate two peeps inclusive of me for the event? (I am desperate for the Imposter Sheepsquatch Apparel)
---
I would just suggest 3* Iron Fist for an Unarmed build
---
Huzzahhhhhh Indeed :)
---
There are server bugs
---
Client Bugs
---
Engine bugs itself.
---
But then there are bugs that are fixed simply with lines in plain text such as translation or references (which send to an erroneous text, wrong rewards, prevent completing the missions correctly ..).
---
The game's database itself seems like a huge bug. The biggest and biggest problems of the game that affects everything else ... and with that we have weapons with absurd attributes, objects that can not be obtained and games of players corrupted in certain aspects that they do not know how to fix ...
---
But the worst of all is that there is no dedicated key to send error reports with explanations when it happens on a screen. Because these errors in the game accompanied with a screenshot and a small text could be solved very easily in small patches since they would not affect most of the rest of the game.
---
I also use another language and it is embarrassing to see so many references to things that are in the code of the game ... but so badly programmed that they are not accessible to the players ... and that even the intern could report and fix !! !! ... sometimes I think there are as many buildings that they put the door on the floor instead of on the wall ...
---
Unfortunately, many times you do not know if you also have a bug or that the game is really very intuitive XD.
---
Because honestly, a help page, official wiki and how things work when currently would be good ... because now is a frankenstein patch on patch difficult to understand even for them, there at the end, I think this is their biggest problem.
---
I don't think it's routine. I would like it to be.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt either just sad that laser weapons break so easily still. Nothing compared to the other ballistic weapons.. I‚Äôd love to use my explosive laser rifle if it wasn‚Äôt breaking twice as fast as my Handmade
---
You could maybe take makeshift off and only use it when you go to craft, unless you really want it for the durability. 
---
Also why not grab some ranks in lone wanderer for when you're not on a team?
---
As far as ik speed demon is broken. It never worked for me. Maybe they fixed it today? I havent been on yet
---
Wear your PA with the highest Rad Resistance, and be sure to wear a Hazmat underneath in case you accidentally exit it, or need to repair your guns mid-way through. Sometimes people draw the Queen outside of the nuke zone so it's rad-free, but that doesn't always happen, and you might wanna go flux picking right after if you're so inclined and still in good shape by the time she's dead.
---
With so many bodies to loot in the chaos, accidentally exiting PA can be a really fatal mistake ü§£
---
Dunno about that. Never found a legendary assaultron head in the wild yet.
---
The great thing about exploits versus just straight up game breaking bugs is that exploits are very well researched before you even sit down to fix them because you have communities of people who have already explored exactly how they happen and because you only want to stop one conclusion you just work to paint over that one conclusion.   
---
For a lot of bugs that don't actually change the gameplay experience severely, you end up with something random as a result of spaghetti code and the result isn't something easily trackable or patchable without a huge performance or visual hit. Like a good example is the **flickering textures**.   
---
Your goal - stop flickering textures  
---
Solutions -   
---
1. Tweak occlusion culling radius radius to lower the amount of checks your system has to do at the cost of players likely noticing the edges of their screen look off 
---
2. Have textures always loaded (super costly, bad) 
---
3. Spend 200-300 hours going into the code to analyze the pace of texture initialization and how it interacts with the camera on different quality settings to figure out if there's a way to make it run more efficiently than it already did
---
Solution 3 is the only one your team lets you do but you also have to work on adding content to the game and fixing actually important bugs sooooo it gets put on the back burner
---
Why would I make a plan? It‚Äôs a sandbox game not work. Just pick a direction and run and see what catches your attention. I will admit that sometimes I am inspired to play because for example I want to build something. But let me tell you, it rarely pans out that way when I actually do get in game.
---
Hey, really easy to do, if you're on PC go to the right of the thread there should be a box that you can drop down, I believe it is under "add flair" and there's a load of options to choose from üôå
---
Same. Wheres my money?
---
Well me too but what I meant is that Fallout has been like this From the start.
---
Ok I can probably muster up the caps. I‚Äôll try to get 2k tomorrow
---
Truth. I stopped going to that one because I was the only one holding the pylons. That's the most "not fun" I can imagine having in-game.
---
same
---
this badge last 6 hours and you can only deal 30% normal damage and you must wear a dunce hat. better go hide under a rock
---
Ya 100% agree, 15% flat bonus across the board? Fantastic.
---
I read that and pictured Vladimir Putin shirtless riding a white horse and destroying mobs and 1 shoting the SBQ. 
---
What kind of damage would this do it would have to be in the 1,000s since each bloodied would stack. Ok maybe not the 1,000s but it would tear mobs up.
---
Because I always play with my Mrs consider it a perk card called married effect always be in a party

I guess I am a western spy, because I was crafting whiskey. Thank you comrade, I will start producing vodka from now on.

Did you find the BOTW treehouse in the NE section of the map? 
---
That place trolled me hard as hell when I first stumbled on it.
---
That‚Äôs pretty much me as well
---
Or on mobile it's the three dots in top right hand corner and just tap on the "flair" option
---
I have a Anti Armor Gatling Laser and Plasma they are fun to use.
---
Nothing can really hurt you, it spends its time staggered or dead. Caveat: I have not played an unarmed bloody build. I have run a 2h and 1h build bloodied. a fast 1h like the bloodied cultist dagger does as much DPS as a 2h. 2h tends to 1-shot most things, and drop scorchbeast and similar tough mobs in 2 or 3 hits. 1h takes more hits, but drops them in almost the same timeframes while keeping them staggered most of that time.  
---
medum and slow 1h, not so much but still deadly.
---
It happens sometimes, just server hop
---
Gangstaz boogie, gangstaz don't Danse...
---
5/16 to 5/30 =/= 7 days, but go off, big dawg.
---
It's also pretty easy to get the unique ski blade weapon (black diamond) early on by following the rose/ top of the world quest line.
---
I‚Äôm level 150 and this is the first I‚Äôm hearing about it hahaha
---
Got to have Priorities man ...
---
I had the same problem i had set a foundation on half land half water i just placed another foundation
---
To the original and it let me delete the rest
---
I quit server today when someone was at my camp.  I was 1k away from max caps after he quickly bought two 3k items.  One more and I would have been busted.   Sorry bro.
---
As a coder, I can say that exploits are usually easier to fix than bugs. Exploits usually require a singular solution, bugs have multiple angles.
---
Not always the case, but that's my experience with it anyways. IMO it's much easier to make a giant monster destroy a car when it gets stuck inside of it VS making sure a specific quest updates properly. One is easier to test and change.
---
Exploit fixes are usually more exact, whereas bug fixes heavily require QA to make sure you didn't break anything else.
---
It would be totally OP for sure - just basically throw down a wall of laser fire and NOTHING survives!
---
Lol fair enough.
---
Still, you might want to consider things like strange in numbers or suppressor then unless you really like the extra XP
---
Wow you've waited years for this
---
Thats sad. I always afraid to buy weapons from others, hopefully I am safe :)
---
Yes forgot about this and Ski Swords are fun to use
---
There's seems to be the vibe they gave last thursday. That there won't be anything substantial until E3, let's hope bethesda proves me wrong
---
Make sure the next one you place is on all ground
---
Hurry da fuq up.  Dont afk in vendors
---
Really? And taking all that time and plastic and storage to make 20-30 caps per bulk is actually worth it to you?
---
How‚Äôs it weird when it‚Äôs the norm? It would be weird if they handled it the other way considering every company with a game like this is exactly the same?
---
OP isn't talking about Events, they're talking about loot / resource nodes
---
It was
---
Well I am sure when I am not worried about exp I can switch it out for other stuff.
---
I just don't see any additions being made several states away. Not to mention the VAST difference between locals. It would go from a vastly wild area, with swamps, and dense forests, to a MASSIVE metropolitan area, that would very likely have been bombed to shit, and back given how densely populated it is, and how well known it is as well. It would be like making Fallout NV a DLC for 3. The distance would be much farther than needed, and the major shift in areas just wouldn't work. It would feel forced, and wouldn't fit nearly as well as you think.
---
The more I added to it just got stuck until I moved my camp
---
awesome! im on ps4 as well id FritoZ
---
so what price do you think is reasonable since its cosmetic only and not that rare?
---
gladely nuka girl outfit autohides on mine . whick is good cause that would have screwed up that look
---
Plastic is easy to get. Plenty of places you can go to get it or just break down the laser rifles from a westek run.
---
Super fun.. until you gotta repair after every daily or SBQ fight.. Very strong weapons I‚Äôd like to not spend 3 times out of my play through teleporting back to my base to repair though. I repair my Handmade once every week lmao.. just use an improved repair kit
---
You could make a real glowing sea unlike the game one from FO4
---
Did you just keep adding floors or foundations
---
I'm level 80, and my trusty non-legendary lever action is still holding its own. There's more than one way to play this game.
---
I just looked the only crit card I put a point into it was Better Criticals just for the 20% extra damage on crits. But bloody mess all the way.. 3 points into that and wouldn‚Äôt go less
---
But the return on that investment just isn't worth it. I legitimately cannot wrap my head around selling bulk to vendors as a viable strategy.
---

---
sure, i'd do it on my middlemanning character (which has nothing on it)....
---
a TSAA25E&amp;movement gatling gun would be fantastic
---
I've redone my camp entirely now, made everything on 1 floor but it just sucks how much time and money was wasted on it
---
Weird, I'll have to check today. I've sold pretty consistantly around 8pm and it's definitely not available when I get home on days earlier around 5.
---
Hehe XD
---
That's the problem, they didn't. The lack of information and deliberate disinformation still makes me sick. And I was born year and a half after the incident. But being from Eastern Europe and my country was being under communist rule, the tone of the series is quite familiar.
---
I recommend to check the podcast in YouTube, because they talk about deleted scenes and what inspired Khomyuk.
---
Board.  Do I win? /s
---
Sure it‚Äôs hard. But Should it take 6 months for a major rpg producing game to fix a bug
---
...and I finally have a pet Deathclaw. You rock!
---
I wanna thank the dupers who dupe shit and put it on the player vendors.. I wanna chase them down and say ty I did few weeks back when I finally got a explosive laser rifle... Never gonna say anything negative about duping again lol
---
Last I checked, MS charged for that.
---
your missing the third type. I know what things sell for on the market place but I dont bother researching it because I am at or near max caps almost all the time anyways. as a result i just pitch stuff on the vendor cheap to get it out of my stash.
---
Both. I tried one of each to the concrete foundation and it just got stuck
---
There was a patch a couple days ago that was just about a lighting issue. There have been patches about duping issues. 
---
They could change how they do it. Saying things have always been one way doesn't mean it has to stay that way forever.
---
Not for a long time. At least a few years.
---
Exactly. And I actually prefer Crit Savvy instead of Better Crits. But that's because a lot of Crits are enough to kill something already, especially if the target is already hurt, so I'd rather get more of them than have stronger ones. But that's absolutely a personal preference thing haha
---
I didnt mean random as in randomly timed. I was more of the static thought of mind. I do understand the 20hr thing though and yeah 8 &gt; 7.
---
oh I don't disagree at all! it would probably feel forced. but would I play a game themed like that but with the current game play? yes!
---
I guess that's more what I'm getting at. it would be a fun map to play but all of your points are valid. I agree.
---
edit: florida wildlife etc could be turned fallout though  - they are doing a fallout 4 mod but I prefer 76 game play style.
---
I literally get all 1400 from random drugs and then excess bulk junk everyday. Literally sold nearly 200 plastic two days ago and had about 300 left. High schools are a great place to look for plastic and I certainly don‚Äôt need 30 bulk ceramic or some nonsense
---
from what someone told me reddit has about ten percent of the player population
---
It worked outside of PA for me, I was much faster.  I could also reload quicker with it.  I know it doesn‚Äôt stack with legendary reload speed effect.  Today after the patch thou, I was the same fast speed inside and outside of PA, unless I‚Äôm morning drunk again.
---
He sure is,
---
just don't let his/her cuteness all go to your head like the guy on the bench did...

found a 3 star with all shitty specs on it so a scrapped it for scrip anyway I would like to know in case something useable drops
---
double the effect of Charisma team xp perks for the weekend. promote teaming up, and get what we need. 4 people with max points in Inspirational, shared to the team. Make it stack and you have double or more XP.
---
I think just a bloodied anti armor handmade would shred enemies.
---
It wouldn't even be fair with this
---
Huh weird
---
if you're female and hot you can walk into a room of nerds and solve algebra by chewing gum.. just saying.
---
If dupers can dupe, they're going to dupe. It has nothing to do with needing the items.
---
Really? Good to know.
---
Get speed demon at least
---
Also, some two factor authentication, just for kicks.
---
Nope. I was already over-encumbered so after I hit the Northern limit I just made a straight line back down to the nearest train station, lol.
---
Nope. :(
---
That would be good. Sadly people will moan and complain because they have to take something out of their perks to make inspirational fit. And that‚Äôs not gonna work for them.  But it‚Äôs a good idea.
---
It would. Explosive is for pvp and the other 2 stars are for big stuff that I wouldn't one hit already. I already have a bloodied swing speed +1 str power fist now I just need a God roll handmade
---
Nah. They've made a lot of progress you have to admit. More like 3 steps forward and 1 back. They're improving quality and content of game but still make stupid avoidable mistakes.
---
I was told, yes, from rifleman if non automatic and from commando, if automatic.
---
Yeah I agree. Oddly these have turned into my weekly routine, along with podcasts, during my lunch hour.
---
nope I carry 3 guns each for a different situation so i have 9\*'s and i'm more the happy with my setup. its rare that i see anything i must have.
---
There‚Äôs one at the sub station north of watgoa. There‚Äôs a set spawn for a deathclaw and sometimes a wendigo or radscorpion.
---
I would probably just take rank 1 in tenderizer. The extra 2% damage and extra time doesn't seem all that worth it to me when using auto weapons and you could invest those points in something else
---
Have you tried using [guard posts](https://twitter.com/idmachina/status/1122667470081396736?s=21)? They‚Äôre pretty flexible and can be [stacked](https://twitter.com/idmachina/status/1122594698483437568?s=21) or rotated into a bunch of different configurations.
---
You sure told him.
---
Not sure I want to constantly have to deal with those but good looks
---
Thanks, I just wasn't sure because there was a bug at launch that it didn't recieve any bonuses
---
Yes they do since a few patches ago I think
---
That would suck! I just bought 20 magizines from a vendor for cheap and was hoping to knock out that achievement with them
---
The late game is having fun with friends
---
Got a handmade with supressor and vat criticial, made it into an SVD Dragonov and named it Russian Propoganda. A two shot explosive 10 mm pistol that i named Double Tap compliments a sniper well!
---
Y'know this sounds really fun. I think the biggest thing stopping me from doing it is the fear of losing a bunch of my Aid items. I've got *way* too many to fit in my Stash, and am reliant on my aid weight reduction perks.
---
Since you play there, I'm wondering if you could tell me how much it usually drops? Is it like 10% of every aid item? Or just a couple random things? Does it specifically drop healing items &amp; drugs, or also food &amp; water, or even magazines &amp; bobbleheads? D'you know if it's based on the quantities you're currently carrying, or is it more like just a small handful every time regardless?
---
*(not OP, just an FYI because people don't always notice that haha)*
---
Hope it works. Could have changed since I did it. I got the Platinum back around December iirc.
---
Sounds like you need to get all the plans and make yourself a camp to me.
---
:P
---
Oh, man. That‚Äôs a long way to go doing the fatty shuffle.
---
Interesting... Thought you couldn‚Äôt get these anymore.
---
Funny story, my CAMP is an ideal spot and gets a lot of traffic all day, every day. 
---
Now, I have work, family and a social life so I can't push pause on life just because people are hanging out in my virtual world. 
---
I never purposedly leave but if I gotta go, I gotta go!
---
I saw a camp build that was 3x3 with a center stair and beams holding up the second and their floor. Keep all the really valuable stations up on the top floor and other stuff on the second. 
---
Spawn in and kill it and your good for at least an hour. Unless you have visitors. A few good missile and laser turrets will keep your stuff safe.
---
ok, thanky ou, i'll check^^
---
Ha! Is your butt sore from the stick?
---
I pick it all up just to scrap so I don't think it's bad form lol whatever works. Make them caps.
---
They're doing forum maintenance right now. I'd assume it'll be up around the time that finishes.
---
Ok, so what's the deal with this exactly? I have a bit over 150, and I can't get the bottoms, do you need to have the 450, see both, then just make sure to get the bottoms first?
---
Are you sure that wasn't "Small Letters" rather than "Signs &amp; Letters"?

Haha! He won't learn his lesson.

Damn you are super self absorbed aren‚Äôt you?

There's a cool spot with a monorail support that you can build on top/under. I don't remember the exact location but its towards the southern end of the savage divide near another cool spot that has a lead and acid extractor. There's also a fissure site near by but its closer to the lead extractor camp and is the reason I no longer live there, but the monorail area should be a safe distance from it.
---
The reason Picklock and Hacker are separated is to level gate those higher locks and terminals.
---
For the weapon damage card, there's a trade off between getting master and expert with the leveling up versions providing less of a benefit. For instance, a Rifleman leveled up to three costs the same amount of SPECIAL but only nets 20% increase whereas getting all three different versions at level one each costs the same amount of SPECIAL but nets 30%
---
I've got the following weapons and armor names (I'll let you guess what they are)
---
-Betty White
---
-Puff The Berserker Dragon
---
-You'll Shoot Your Eye Out!
---
-Brain Control Blocker
---
-John Cena's Tit Protector
---
There was maintenance to address an exploit.
---
someplace far away from my place that has a junk extractor, unless you are NOT on PC then do what you like. try this  [https://i.imgur.com/bIViWhB.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/bIViWhB.jpg)
---
I'll test today and report back, Sir! 
---
Seriously though, wouldn't be the end of the world since I probably spent 100 caps on 20 mags. 
---
I'm secretly hoarding them in the hopes I can out them on display, soon!
---
You can get bloodied unarmed up to around 3000 damage per swing with a proper build/mutations Coupled with martial artist, incisor, and a +swing speed legendary effect, the only thing that even comes close is a bloodied explosive heavy gun.
---
Outside Point Pleasant is a power relay tower with an exposed concrete foundation with a junk pile on it. Interesting place to try out multi level architecture, the only mobs I had to worry about were a bunch of BeEeEeEeS!
---
I get an opposite bug, where I don't get the set bonus at all.... combined with my carry weight perks also not working at the same time, I've given up wearing it!
---
That sounds normal to me
---
Having guilds with the size of the servers and server design now would mean a lot of people joining on guild mates and filling a server with JUST that guild. Sounds kinda cool but you're cheating yourselves out of the random interactions we have now. 
---
The towns project sounds a little better. Up to 4 people band together to combine build amount and make a small town with shops and inns and other bonuses. 
---
Specifically for guilds and factions, I would love to eventually have a way to choose an existing faction in the game and get a buff based off it or something. Like I would choose BoS and get heavy weapon buff. Or raiders and get explosive buff. And I can get access to that factions flag for my camp so everyone knows. Could lead to cool pvp/trading interactions.
---
Same here. I've got well close to 100 at this point. If not more, lol I quit counting them.
---
"Server full" you are in queue to join....
---
...I mean, no? Go for it?
---
and got it, thx!^^
---
I'd go to way more events if our stash limit allowed me to not be permanently overencumbered, and thus unable to fast travel.
---
No, because the true legendaries are the friends we've made along the way! 
---
(Plus, is a 5\* weapon really going to make my immersion that much better? Vs all the grinding I had to do to get to my level?)
---
I only ask cause this morning a high level guy started laughing at me when i told him why i was stealing a hundred vases.
---
It does for me. Always has. Only needs to re-login after a patch.
---
do you launch by hitting "Play" in the launcher, or by clicking the "76" shortcut?
---
I imagine a Bloodied faster fire Rate explosive VATs AP redux and VATs Crit lever/Handmade/assault rifle and I immediately delete everything
---
And the petty little squabble continues, go and stalk someone else...
---
The only confirmed nerf I know of for whitesprings is a nerf on Xp, and on re-spawn rates. I often go through with 5+ legendary mobs on the rare occasions it's not already cleared out.
---
All of those things have existed for a while.  I guess you're just unlucky that they all happened together.
---
They are having enough troubles with the vendors to worry about this
---
Do you have a higher res pic? If not that‚Äôs cool imgur just sucks with keeping pics high res lol thanks
---
Let them hate yo I agree with you guys tho would be nice to have something fun to do on weekends
---
Yeah hope so, saw a new dupe method today released online
---
Good advice
---
I hope so
---
I've been using the same armor since about December. Unyielding. Also, vanguard is better than Sentinals. And bolstering us incredible. And another thing, i played against a dude last night who was completely naked and was wreaking everybody with his berderkers railway rifle. You know why he did so well? Because he's good at the game'. Simple.

Bloody Quad Explosive ReloadSpeed Weightless harpoon gun.
---
What are your 3 guns
---
I can't imagine what kind of chinese knock-off crap hardware you have been buying. Running an "Inter i7" processor, are you?
---
There are some extra bugs and keyboard inconsistencies for "no English" versions of the game. Some of them, imported from FO4.
---
I understand that it must be a nightmare to handle a game translated to seven voiced languages, but sometimes I would like they better made efforts to fix things, than to add more messed content and all that atomic shop pointless stuff.
---
the launcher does it automatically. no need to add anything.
---
Really want to see upcoming plans too, hope they don't skip this week.
---
PC:
---
Baffles me they have no way to ask a player to join that is in another world.. Like an XBox Party join.
---
XBox: you peeps have this problem licked. If I have 2 players and we say.. "Hey.. John is on too.." we have no way of getting him to join except all of us leaving world to get John, then when "Susie" comes on we have to all 3 bail and join to get her too.. If one person has a workshop claimed.. Well it's either forget Susie, or loose the workshop..argh!!! Us PC peeps have this issue every day....
---
As someone who sells clothes exclusively and likes to collect - I want this too. Nothing like trying to find a neat outfit on the cheap and you get there and it's all crap wood legendary armor.
---
Bethesda let the modders come in and fix the entire game took under 20 minutes. game runs great and we can use our pip-boys sitting down. 
---
disclaimer: the things i just said are untrue
---
Speed demon works as intended. As someone who levels a lot of new folks I'm constantly having to stop and wait for them to catch up. Once they get to the point of being able to use speed demon the constant waiting for them to catch up stops
---
This...is every build I've ever done? You're just running into this? Functionally speaking, if it's  a foundation or stair, there's a 20% chance you'll be able to get it back. It's a absolutely moronic "fairness" system that's so clunky and over-handed that it pretty much fucks over the building system completely in many ways.
---
Correct. Based on login. If you do not close the launcher completely (kill the process, close it from the widget bar, shut down the system) it never asks again unless the launcher is patched.
---
I have a feeling the complainers either run the 76 executable directly, or completely shut down the launcher every time they quit. In simpler terms, they keep shooting themselves in the foot and then complain that this game makes their foot hurt.
---
Yeah it's usually up almost 1.30 hours before now. Probably late because of the maintenance or maybe there wo't be one.
---
Your junk will fly off the shelves if you sell 1 for 1 but a simple rule that I follow is selling it at 20% of it's "listed value" 
---
This goes for everything other than legendary weapons/armor or other "rare" items. I made $5K caps yesterday alone and the best thing I sold was a full set of excavtor armor (level 35) and a 2\* Minigun.
---
Gosh, imagine that, they fix an exploit that will ruin the game in a day, but are slower to fix bugs that are just kind of annoying.  Imagine that.
---
not at all, one of my teammates does the same thing!  caps are caps!
---
I find its easier to go to huntersville which is already really close to whitesprings, kill all the super muties and take their guns, then run over to the close random event enemy vs enemy location just north past the lead resource location, then server hop-
---
then you kill the enemy vs enemy location enemies, take their stuff, then head back over to huntersville... and repeat!
---
I found 3 server hops nets more than 1400 caps worth of stuff if you use the hard bargain lvl 3 perk card
---
the whole thing takes 1/2 hour at most including the over encumbered walk back to whitesprings
---
this is how i get my 1400 caps each day!
---
It's consistently 20 hours from the first transaction you make in a day. I believe there's also a minimum transaction involved, because in the past when I tried to sell 1 Bobby Pin to force a certain timing, it didn't work.
---
Personally, I wish it was on a 10 hour reset, such as 700 Caps every 10 hours.  On the weekends, I always have to be careful not to clean vendors out too early.

Last week every single night the second I logged on I heard the nuke siren.
---
Yea LFG is a real saver for games like this, sure most are selling stuff but find enough people inviting to events so its worth checking LFG often.
---
I wish balance and bugs were a higher priority..
---
These are just suggestions I would do:
---
Drop power patcher, PA already lasts for a ridiculous amount of time.
---
Batteries included is good if you're using a fusion core or plasma core based weapon. Otherwise you only need to carry 1 or 2 extra fusion cores on you. Stash 3-5. When you get low, go grab a powerplant. Put another point into power user instead.
---
I'd also drop 2* blocker in favor of 2* bandolier if you'll be using a 50 cal. (5mm doesn't weigh too much)
---
Before this the only issue I've had was the metal stairs with beams but it let you tear down specific pieces until you could get the stairs out but this was just ridiculous, I moved my camp literally steps away each time just to get it forced into stored items
---
sorry thats not mine i took it from https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia_my_project_which_can_automatically/
---
As you've clearly done a lot of testing, is there any way to reduce the damage output of the pylons, or is it just a matter of bringing more stimpaks? As I don't normally carry many and the prep time for the event is really short, I tend to run out if I play pylon.
---
Calling you out on your bullshit isn‚Äôt stalking you, dude. Quit with the victim complex.
---
I really don't have complete control of my reactions though, I have PTSD. Didn't wanna get into that, but it's a factor. And yes, I know that's my own problem, but it ain't that simple. Thanks though.

---
TFW you‚Äôre arguing for defenses not being defensive
---
Once youre out of combat and once youve been hit. Furious isnt as sought after on melee weapons becaus egetting smackes resets it. Its still capable of good damage, but very situational
---
Seems like they need a checklist of things fixed and they need to check for those exploits and bugs again once they decide to release the patch. Seeing old bugs emerge again sucks but maybe the can catch a few more if they fine tune. Might be understaffed as well. This is a online game with no subscription fee so unless you are buying atoms or another person is buying a new copy they are not making money off you anymore but still paying a salary.
---
i'm not telling you'll lol at me.... I'm happy OK
---
My shotguns are always named Breuh, and my snipers are named Unlce Rico.... because it can shoot raiders clear over dem mountians

They took it out of the game until they added the purveyor apparantly. I was mighty surprised when I picked it up, to be sure.

I mean it's a pretty silly way to do it, but why the hell not.

We're gonna have to take you into this abandoned warehouse.
---
That's true I love my 1* Anti Armor Pole Hook I have bludgeoned so many SBQ with it.
---
The vast majority of the time for me on PC, if I put down a foundation, and I don't like it, I have to move my entire fucking camp because of this bullshit.
---
So an exploit is less important than a ‚Äúminor‚Äù bug?
---
I had the same , server hopped and nearly everything dropped a 1*
---
Fair point.
---
Yes. 
---
We got alts for a reason. ;)
---
I guess deploys can't be scheduled? Hell even Santa Claus can do the world in 24 hours...
---
What..oh, right, no Santa talk here.. kids and all..
---
Love it! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
My rifle is named "A Kind Word" and my heavy weapon is called "My Little Friend".
---
I doubt it's particularly original, but I like it. üòä
---
If you left the game because of the bugs now is not a good time to come back
---
It was for a duping exploit
---
Caps come easy enough.  Just keep selling weapons and don't buy anything. Even events award caps. And the easy ones that aren't limited by an NPC can be done relatively fast.
---
So camp building is worse on PC? That sounds crazy but it IS Bethesda so if something's gonna go wrong it will
---
I like to stay back from groups like that, and lob a molotov in to their carefully rounded up gaggle of ghouls. For some reason that pisses them off more than stealing the entire kill with a one-shot weapon.
---
Explosive was nerfed into the ground...they're still good...just not ridiculous
---
Amen.
---
Hahahaha some peoples kids
---
&gt; duping is very good for the economy
---
sure, sure‚Ä¶.
---
duping is very good for the economy‚Ä¶ of the dupers!
---
I run commando perks on mine and previously rifleman. Totally works.
---
Each piece adds 5 to the ActionPointsRate value, which looks like a raw action points per tick. Action Boy/Girl multiplies that value.
---
&gt;So it seems this isn't gross incompetence it has to be laziness or unwillingness to fix the game.
---
probably a combination of both.
---
I'd take fixing exploits over "minor" bugs all day...
---
You misunderstood. Not hard up for caps. Was just surprised the item went for 25,000
---
The LFG is a blessing and a curse. I do some trading on there myself. Quite a few trolls hanging out in there too tho.
---
Nope, all of my other mutations work
---
Yeah i've seen that first hand. Lol
---
But what about when paired with Two Shot? I know people still view Explosive as meta but i'm not sure about the Two Shot.
---
So you‚Äôre wasting the plastic by just sitting on it? Might as well pick up the plastic and the various crap and sell it off
---
Explosive is great on a lot of rolls.  Two-Shot is a reduction in accuracy with only a 25% increase in damage, people prefer Bloodied or Anti-Armor now.
---
To be fair, said video of a new dupe shows exactly what needs to be patched while even a "minor bug" might have several lines of code that could be obscurely unrelated to cause it.
---
don,t tell him that....dammit
---
No, as I originally stated. Most of my plastic goes into a much more useful, and in demand resource. Shotgun shells.
---
So, sometime before the release of Fallout 8: Canadian Warfare.
---
Outstanding.. Just like marking the challenges...
---
Hahaha. I can taste the salt from here
---
I still chuckle whenever sleeping ghouls attack me. Just these piles of ghoul speeding across the ground. Lol
---
i have a two star TSE double barrel in my store at 3000 caps that hasn't been sold for weeks
---
Nah. I do this if I‚Äôm in a pinch and need cash fast. Not my typical MO, as I usually don‚Äôt focus on caps. But I think it‚Äôs a solid play.
---
If there‚Äôs a nuke, you‚Äôll catch me greenthumb rushing flora around WS. Unrefined flux sells for a cap a piece. Picking up two at a time is tantamount to printing caps as fast as you can mash the A button.
---
Its not BS, i stand by my comment 100%, the only one who came here and posted BS was you.
---
Again you never just stumbled on a barely upvoted thread, on a sub you've probably never visited, you're here with the sole intention of picking a fight, now please leave me alone and go stalk someone else.
---
Glad to see someone else push the same issue that I did. The issue is really only for PC players since console players login through their console accounts and Microsoft and Sony have offered 2FA for many years.
---
Still outclassed by many other combinations of explosive. Bloodied, anti-armor, even quad is preferred. Two shot just isn't all that great now for end game rolled gear.
---
south of whitesprings just south south west of the snake on the map is a junk heap. big open space right next to a hole in the golf course fence. its also far enough away that most nukes wont touch it. i built here as a lvl 15 just to collect random scrap while i was playing and the most i've lost was the generator powering the extractor. most of the time if something spawns the robots on the golf course aggro it. its possible i've been lucky but it doesnt seem like its too dangerous
---
Glowing Meat Steak. Glowing Meat is literally everywhere, it heals for a ton with the Carnivore mutation, and it boosts melee damage.
---
Aren't Combat Shotguns considered better due to ammo?
---
Normally I pick a direction and walk that way and see what happens.
---
My food and chem source is solely the trash bins and other containers at Whitesprings
---
thank you sir!
---
Lmfao. "My main is a very well known..." GTFOH
---
The fact that your played your part of x/60 be a pylon is awesome!
---
Biggest problem is that most people don't know what to do except shoot at everything..
---
That‚Äôs a good one. Thanks üëçüèª
---
Yeah Rad X sometimes suppresses only some mutations and I have heard people that Marsupial gets suppressed even by dilute Rad X. So check that.
---
None of them. Dog food all day. It doesn't rot and the perk card bonus is nice.
---
But, when I did make food, mothman egg omelets were nice, simply for the selling price.
---
Pack your machines with stuff and you‚Äôll get more visitors. My camp typically has more items for sale than any other vendor on the server and I get at least a few visitors every night. I load it with everything as well, not just one type of item. My camp is far off to the east near the dolly sods. Not sure if that helps, but I always keep the machines stocked and I always get visitors
---
I don't use rad X...
---
Two Shot was nerfed too...Two Shot, as the name implies, should be double the damage...My .45 Lever Action should shoot 2 bullets, equal in damage.
---
I think the 2nd bullet adds like 20 or 25%?
---
And the vats accuracy seems to suck balls.  My AA Lever on paper shows less Damage output but actually takes down enemies just as easily...and headshotting in VATS is much easier.
---
Temple of the winding path
---
Personally, I just do one run through all of harper's ferry.  If the first half is super mutants or scorched then one run just picking up guns and meds is all you need to hit the max 1400.  If the first half is ghouls then you might need to do a second.
---
Like you have any insight into what it takes to fix a bug, what their ticketing process is like, what the codebase looks like, what their priorities are, or any of the other relevant information you'd need to make the assessment you're making. You literally have no idea what you're talking about.
---
This is like planet fitness "Judgement free zone"
---
Most i've ever sold for was a TS The Dragon for $3k, and I thought that would be too high
---
I just heard that it'll be up after they finish forum maintainance.
---
Cranberry relish
---
Probably a legit bug then.
---
Snitches get, exploitable exploding laser burn damage to the fac from outside of visible range.
---
Oh, and stitches.
---
I‚Äôve never run out of dog food, but I‚Äôm always about to. So I‚Äôm just looking for an alternative
---
it would be great if this worked for 100% of the events.  I attend uranium fever, hordes, awol armaments, sons of dane, and others 100% of the time I see them as they are a great source of legendaries for the chipper.
---
they will learn when no one buys.
---
Scrip Cap, Vendor Caps Cap, Lucky Hole Mine run, check the missile silos for lead weights. Usually throw in a West Tek run for the hell of it, then hop on an alt and work on leveling. 
---
Right now the carrot at the end of the stick is having the best build for the best legendaries available. I got a lvl 50 bloodied SS +Str sledge from my West Tek run the other day that I am currently building a character around. Can‚Äôt wait to see what this bad boy can do!
---
Hopefully you'd think they'd do one during e3 or something to create a little hype
---
These companies make billions off of us. With micro transactions to keep the games afloat it wouldn‚Äôt be that hard to expand their building and hire another set of programmers to manage bugs or help develop new content. We don‚Äôt set deadlines for the companies, management does. If they would finish the updates and then release them as opposed to setting a release date there‚Äôd be less pressure from hyped up fans.
---
Which salt? Let's play survival (PC) together and you can see it yourself. I have been around for a while, i'm not one of these ''nerf and cry'' kids
---
Whats wrong with that mate?
---
Seems like ya might be
---
It's the same as always for me, with the occasional glitched glowing ones server.  Last night I picked up around 30 legendaries in two runs.  Nothing useful, but scrip fodder none-the-less.
---
Not really surprised to hear about Bloodied builds being considering Godly (If you're going to get one tapped anyway, you might as well take them out in one shot as well.)
---
But what happened to Two Shot that made it fall off the top? Does AA do roughly less because of the explosive, and can you explain why Quad is preferred? (I'm assuming this is a specific weapon kind of thing)
---
Its been like that for months tbh. It worked at start but suddenly the effect is gone, i have the starched genes and class freak perk so yeah
---
Oh, that sucks.
---
Eastern Regional Penitentiary has a bunch of weights in the middle of the courtyard, as well as 6-7 can traps in Block A. It can be good for up to about 200 lead plus the steel scrap from the cans and the weapons of the enemies. Super mutants - which spawn outside and sometimes inside also tend to drop gunpowder so in all you get all components in one location.
---
Exactly what happens
---
(Bethesda) Hey this isn't a bug, its a secret cap sink.
---
Seriously though I feel you, lost my self so many caps especially because of phantom budget, literally moved my base and it showed I had a bunch of stuff placed despite me literally moving and had to move my base again.
---
Someone on the Market Reddit offered 2k for my 1star Bloodied Handmade /shrug
---
That being said I normally make all my caps selling apparel / plans for reasonable prices.
---
Last night I was farming flux because someone nuked Aarnolt farm (great flux location). Another nuke launch announced, SBQ fight. So I fast travelled there and joined the fight. 
---
Halfway in I realized I have run out of Radaway. The queen fight was inside the nuke zone because some people are just too stupid to function.  
---
I have been looting  gathering some flux during the fight when she's out of range and the yard trash is cleaned up. I am overburdened, and nearly dead from rads. Crap.  
---
I beeline for the nuke zone edge, and get killed by a scorched pot-shot. Auto-spawns at the fissure. By the time I get to my death location, some lovely bastard has taken all my flux.  
---
Mostly my fault, but screw that asshole too.
---
Haha! I one time farmed every piece of item and loot in Whitesprings. From the shopping area / second floor / Enclave bunker, to the golf course and the residential area to the point where i got the max limit carry weight while killing all enemies in the process. What a jammy go! Would never do it again... but I sold everything but the 200 lead and 300+ plastic that i got from that. But there was just SO.MUCH.CERAMIC. Lol!
---
Can-do perk card and hit Whitesprings.
---
Watoga, if you can get there before someone cleans it out, has a decent amount of dog food all around the cafe behind the BOS vendor and near the diner on food carts.
---
And, if you're on PS4, I can kick you 50 cans for free. :)
---
Nah, I'm good. But also you can't deny how easy to get hacks are. If you are so sure you can join me on survival. Let's see if i talk shit
---
Saw a dude selling all the teddy bears for 3K per the other day. Fucking ridiculous.
---
Radiated puke emote
---
Canned dog food but when I can I kill all the poor Brahmin at Flatwoods and make Ribeye Steak + Super Duper. Keeps me going.
---
I sell everything a little under value. 2* armor 4-500 caps if it's not awful. Weapons always reasonable- 2* explosive hunting rifle sold for 1200 caps. I'm constantly close to max caps and my stash box weight is manageable. I buy whatever I fancy but the caps keep on rolling in...
---
Keep the prices low peeps, help out your fellow adventurer=l and enjoy the profit.
---
Sorry, you want them to come in after hours or interrupt or extend their workday just to make it more convenient for Europe? You realize that we live on a planet - no matter when they do it, someone will be put out. There isn't some magical time zone where a maintenance window wouldn't effect someone. I'd rather they do it when it's convenient for them, meaning they're awake, alert, and finishing it as quickly as possible.
---
Oh you rip people off then lol. Buying shotgun shells is ludicrous
---
Totally agree, they are awesome but also rare.. Found my second lvl 95 one in whitesprings today, drops a lot of loop, but nothing special unfortunatly
---
I'm used to it at this point, haha.
---
Once I get too overweight for Grilled Radstag/Buffout/PowerArmor combo to save me, I just pick up everything I see.
---
By the time I got to the train station I was at like 574/235 carry weight, haha.
---
Maybe try getting the mutation again. I gotit recently  (after vending was introduced) and it definitely works for me.
---
What stations were the radar under armour at
---
if I had one i'd sell it
---
I didn‚Äôt mark the exact location, but there‚Äôs a small campfire and picnic table around the pumpkin house, on the way to the marked location for the event
---
Dont seem to run into these problems. When someone keeps killing they are just usually better
---
I would love this especially if placable without dirt.
---
I don't mean to "preach" nor assume the severity of your condition but please know that what I'm about to say comes from the heart. 
---
I've been through the gambit of mental illnesses/disorders over majority of my adult life and through a lot of work, I've been able to mitigate a lot of the side effects. I've battled through the ups and downs with moments in the darkest abyss. 
---
One thing you need to believe: nobody has power over your attitude but you. I truly hope you learn to tame your demons and you get the peace you deserve - it's not an easy fight but it is winnable. It digusts me that people needlessly attack others but you're stronger than you think you are and your reactions are your own. Nobody else can force you to think negatively. 
---
Lastly, it doesn't have to be your own problem. I'm just some random on the internet but I'm here. Good luck, to you!
---
Raider stations like Sutton, Pleasant Valley, etc. It only goes up to Resistant (Tier 2)
---
Across the street from the pumpkin house.
---
Top of the World is a great idea. Nobody ever in there. Clean it out and make it a marketplace and meet-up spot.
---
Money laundering 
---
It‚Äôs a way to transfer caps from one account to another
---
I saw it at watoga train station
---
Right next to spruce knob. No danger of scorch beast attacks. You get radstags, mongrels, super mutants and scorched. Really nice spot. One of my favorites
---
That would be awesome (and yes, I‚Äôm on PS4: jtrag, on now)
---
Didn‚Äôt know this was a universal bug, thanks for saving me the trouble stranger
---
No that's the one I checked. It didnt work at the nukashine atleast, that's where I tried.
---
Watoga. Alright, thanks. I'll check there when I'm on next.
---
I got a guy 5 min ago how sad bears for 25k and each comic to for 25k hahaha
---
Makes you wish you killed a few players before they left the vault.
---
I usually do a quick resource run then craft enough skeleton costumes to clothe a small militia which nets me enough wipe their stock.
---
Black Diamond is still my #1 go-to melee weapon after so many battles and level upping.
---
I guess you watched Rifle Gaming's video?
---
Another good event for acid is A Real Blast - Abandoned Bog Town.  It often has dozens of Snallygasters that will drop 5-8 acid each.
---
Oh yeah.. that‚Äôs my only problem. And the bandana and goggles are named ‚Äústalker‚Äôs‚Äù
---
This is why if I log on and the server seems slow I hop to another one. I usually spawn in at my camp or at a train station, and if I notice my camp taking forever to load or the junk at the train station is present but not lootable (and then it disappears after a short time) then I server hop. Once I get on a server where it loads in quick I stay there and this is probably why I haven't been complaining about many of the glitches that people seem to frequently experience (floor ghouls, invisible enemies, no legendary loot, constant disconnects).
---
Also I've had it where it was on my end and resetting my connection and my router helped. I run a latency and jitter test between me and my ISP if I can't seem to find a good server just to make sure it's not on my end, and sometimes it has been. It was on my end a lot more often when I was running my old linksys router, now I have a netgear running openwrt and it's been a lot more stable.
---
I think the point OP is trying to make is that we could clearly have both.
---
What is with this completely fucking insane "Don't charge for ammo" mentality that's going around? Ammo is a valued resource that takes time and energy to gather or craft. And, unlike bulk garbage like people are trying to say is a "valuable" method of cap farming, ACTUALLY nets a good return on that gathering time and energy.
---
Whats doubly funny is I get fucking SCREAMED at for bitching about people selling plans for ultracite armor, which you get for fucking _free_ but now _I'm_ the bad guy for _selling bullets_? What the fuck is wrong with you lot?
---
Yeah I'm sure it was because they didnt announce the downtime till right b4 the maintenance.
---
I just go with the flow
---
bingo. Log in. Any friends on? What are they doing? Not interested, go explore, do some junk runs. Look for events that I am interested in. 
---
really bored? Solo launch a nuke somewhere I have never nuked before. Because, that's why. Maybe I will nuke that spot in the NW that the nuke zone defaults to when you first log in. Just to confuse people.
---
Or you know... add a remember my password option.
---
You could do 2 or even 3, but in reality, it comes down to how bad you need it and how fast you want it to sell. 
---
Black titanium will go for 10 caps but will obviously go quicker at 5. One Uranium Fever event usually gives me all the black titanium I need but it's still valuable to others.  I still sell it for cheap.
---
I managed to redeem the bottoms at around 170 tokens. Yeah, it's messed up still I guess.
---
Sure thing. So someone who is ''just better'' can shoot above the normal range and see every player everywhere. Guess you are the one talking shit here lmao
---
Color me surprised.
---
Regardless of what the system is my main hope  is you get to keep your known recipes/plans and the contents of your stash.  I'd really hate to have to re level without being able to craft myself op gear along the way :P
---
Is there just an accuracy decrease, or does this include damage as well?
---
I really don't have much of a plan.  Most of the time I'm taking my sweet time finishing a quest while other times I decide I absolutely need to make a whole bunch of booze because that's what Jesus would do.
---
I see not much has changed in this regard. 
---
I uninstalled a few months ago :/
---
If the placement of the nuke is proper, WS gives you a pretty good mix of everything except violet. I usually end up making up the difference when prime gets nuked, as that whole area is covered up with violet.
---
Yes I would get a Meat Hook
---
Bloodied, Vicious, 40% Attack Speed, 40% Attack Power, +1 Strength
---
Show me
---
Two shot only adds +25% base damage, but causes a huge decrease in accuracy (not part of the damage nerf in patch 5, always been shit). Explosive throws another +40% (20% on a non-two shot). In theory, should all shots land... it can cause some damn fast time to kill. In practice... not every shot lands.
---
An anti-armor explosive weapon of the same two shot explosive weapon will, more often than TS, have all its shots land resulting in no net loss of DPS.
---
From personal experience I've used a TSE 50 cal and an anti-armor 50 cal. I sold the TSE some time ago because, even at short range, I can get all the shots from my AA 50 onto a target and kill it faster than TSE which had terrible accuracy at any range.
---
Quad is weapon specific for sure, such as the harpoon gun absolutely SHINES with it. It can be nice on rifles as well since your DPS will be higher due to not needing to reload multiple times.
---
Your just making excuses for getting worked. We have all been there. Sometimes you just have to say that player just has your number and you will never be able to touch them
---
Go on survival, you'll find they're still be used.... a lot.
---
I scrapped EVERYTHING when I started testing lol so yeah after my final build I'm a like 40% of my budget 
---
Floors and walls add up when you store instead of scrap but 1 turret is like 8% budget it's fuckin crazy
---
/r/woosh
---
I sold a TSE Handmade (2\*) for $3K thinking the buyer would scoff but he bought it before I could reconsider and thanked me for selling so cheap! 
---
It's interesting either way.
---
i agree that is big time BS
---
Interesting, possibly unrelated but I made a post a few months ago suggesting ‚ÄúCamp Towns‚Äù that got a pretty enthusiastic reply from the one of the devs...
---
Well, that's the true question...
---
Are there people who do buy at 1000% markup?
---
I was battling a scortxhbeast the last week and jet packed into the air to avoid the sonic attack. Landed in the emerald hellpit. Lost 25 violet flux.
---
We weren‚Äôt really discussing value in the eyes of other players we were just talking about getting caps but still buying ammo is simply not worth it to anyone that knows the game well. At minimum 1 cap a piece it is simply a bad deal. Worst case scenario you‚Äôre aware of that and you‚Äôre intentionally taking advantage of people
---
I'm having the same issue since last patch I have to type it in everytime.
---
I'm UK where are you two based maybe its regional?
---
I can make 10k or more each day now selling reasonably priced items AND a handful of overpriced plans (X-01 military paint for 750c, BoS combat armor plans for 500-1000c each, etc.). The cheap stuff keeps cash coming in slowly and gets players visiting often. The overpriced plans go to the occasional unaware people with deep pockets to keep the lights on and give me caps to stay stocked up. I‚Äôve got stupid stuff in my machine for the lulz (like a super mutant head for 2k and the prisoner collar for 666c) but they never sell.
---
Well when I sleep I usually dream I'm back in school not ready for something, so at that time it feels like it's more than one-way! =P
---
Same! Make a lot of money just selling cheap ammo that I can't get rid of fast enough after doing a SBQ run or two.
---
Ugh, you are in fact full of shit. I have the exact same equipment as said players. Also i would say my gamesense is much higher. Dont talk shit now, they are online on survival right now if you want to see. If not just stop talking.
---
Yao guai loot usually includes acid. There‚Äôs one that spawns reliably at site alpha (and the gym in the silo has some weights you can pick up for lead) and they‚Äôre one of the random enemies at middle cabins. Useful to check out if you‚Äôre in the area.
---
Well its just kinda funny you see people calling for 2FA and the likes, but then we can just essentially void all that by putting our password in plain text : \
---
To each their own. I considered doing this then immediately thought better of it. Password isn't a huge deal :p
---
Honestly? Spoiled meat
---
yeah I like you think they'd fix the last two possum matches so they are actually completable I'm talking about the chemist and musician badge
---
Noted. Will look into changing Tenderizer down to 1\*. Will wait a bit to see if other suggestions come in - thanks for taking the time to  reply to my post, appreciated :)
---
Wild times in appalachia! You know we're living it easy when people can afford posh teddy bears!
---
Yeah I saw that last night. I went farming for flora and when I came across prime having been nuked I ended up with almost 100 violet. Probably would have had more had I not stopped harvesting the flash ferns lol.
---
Depends on the kind of scrap you're looking for. Normally I just google "best place to farm X item in fallout 76" and there's usually a youtube video or a thread for it.
---
Look for Granmammy here in a few.
---
funk a junk hole
---
yes
---
Wait what ?
---
I like you! You're the kind of vendor that will get repeat business and the appreciation of your server mates.
---
True. Stability is much better, in game performance seems much better as well. 
---
But there are still a few things causing aches and pains that have been around since day one. Simple stuff like no distinguishing name between Scout Armor mods...that can't be hard to fix (definitely not a bug, but a huge oversight).
---
Ahh! But can't this be accomplished with 1 or 2 items? Why increase the prices for everything else?
---
Cranberry Relish taste the best after a little nap.
---
Cool very similar why good doggie is there something about dog food I don't know about?
---
platform?
---
Do 3events, scrap legendaries, wait day for legendary machine to refill scrips.
---
Maybe do daily challenges, but they are mostly fucked up.
---
Wow...they aren't even rare...
---
Is anyone running a nocturnal build? I've never seen it mentioned. I'd imagine there is a nocturnal build on N&amp;D and now I'm going to investigate.
---
That is amazingly creative and hilarious. I‚Äôm sorry for laughing, but geez that‚Äôs funny!
---
I am slowly amassing a large amount of shotgun shells to sell myself lol
---
Selling bulk is one of the worst way to farm caps I can think of. you spend more time farming plastic than you would, say, clearing out west-tek, for individual units that are worth less than those guns are. 
---
Compared to vending machine prices, the 2 caps a pop the machine defaults to is _cheap_. Compared to farming your own lead, steel, gunpowder and plastic, it's expensive. Saying selling one of the ten most in-demand items is "taking advantage" of people is fucking insane, though.
---
whatever. just wanted to clarify that i'm not a crying newbie to pvp
---
Mine is NW of the asylum; just up the road and down a small hill. Easily defended and plenty of road frontage/build space. Quick run to do "Line in the Sand" and cheap fast travel to a number of farming locations. As with anywhere in that part of the map, you have to deal with the occasional Sierra Bravo, but otherwise it's pretty quiet.
---
Was v excited to complete some of my Possum badges, but alas...
---
Xbox
---
I want that on a t-shirt.
---
I've seen you in game. Your tag cracked me up then as it does now. Why are you getting downvoted for this? This is the shittiest standard I've ever seen a game set. 
---
It's so satisfying that they got greedy with Zenimax or Whatever the fuck it is and it bit them right in the ass.
---
Yea its a real shame they don't give us more budget especially when turrets are involved but at least its a lot better then before where you could only place maybe 5 turrets before you spent all your budget.
---
See? Your strategy makes perfect sense and you throw in some variety to make it interesting. Seems like an ideal American enterprise!
---
I would go with the handmade with a drum magazine you would hold 85 rounds less reloading more destroying
---
I am Negan!
---
I keep a Perfectly Preserved Pie in mine for 1K
---
I do agree on some of your points, like chemistry station for 2k is waaaay over priced. I have those at la 0 caps. Easiest plan to find. 
---
I do have to say though, sounds like you've never spent time on the market subreddits for fo76. Depending on the legendary effect and weapon. Yes some 1* or 2* might be worth that much. 
---
The god rolls on rare weapons can sell for 50k+ caps easy.
---
Hahaha i forgot nobody is mightier than beatdownhxc. Nobody in none of the lands can stand toe to toe with thee!
---
I‚Äôm still following the overseers journey according to my quest log. Very annoying

Can you please skin some of your pet please I need 2 more hides, kk thanks.
---
I'm pricing it to move. This is my first character and I'm only level 15. This is more to make some caps to support myself. Thanks
---
Seems to be on the random side. I went through there yesterday and walked away with \~twenty legendaries -- no nuke.
---
right you are... Out right stupid..
---
Geht mir auch hart auf die Nerven -.-
---
Yes! People forget this. You don't need to get this done in one hour.
---
Plus you get to double dip on the perk cards
---
They did a fix this morning. This happened after that.
---
I‚Äôm still fairly new. Have a crop of corn and make soup, quenches thirst and hunger at the same time. Having new thoughts though, thanks to your question.
---
See? you're just a kid talking shit. gtfo troll
---
Does it count if you buy them or give them to others? For other badge stuff, you can't just give it to a friend or sell it.
---
I didn't even get a 1\*
---
Razor grain soup - tops off food and water. Add mole rat chunks for strength bump, and ribeye steak or grilled radstag for carry bonus. Glowing steak if I‚Äôm about to do some melee fighting.
---
I've sold 2 propaganda flyers for 5k each as a joke. But everything else in my shop is super reasonable. Some people want to spend money, to free up room for bigger transactions. At least that's my guess.
---
IF you left because of bugs a Bethesda game might not be for you. There's always gonna be a new bug.
---
That being said it's still an enjoyable game and if you left after only a couple of days? I would recommend just starting over and questing and actually trying out the game.
---
Does anyone have a explosive shot shot gun for ps4 lol. I‚Äôve been looking forever
---
I was thinking the other day it would be nice to be able to dedicate perk points to perks on other things, like my stash.  I could dedicate points to the perk that reduces junk weight and instead of it applying to me I could attach it to my stash, reducing the weight of all junk in there.  Remove the perk from the stash for a different one and all overflow beyond the max weight will get added to your inventory.  You could attach armor perks to the armor bench, weapon perks to the weapon bench, etc..., though you'd need to change them out if you want a different focus like going from guns to melee.  It probably wouldn't be that easy to implement though.
---
Been shopkeeping almost exclusively since the Fasnacht parade and feel like I‚Äôve got it down to a science. I‚Äôm shocked daily by how well it all works. Like I said I usually make 10k per day but I‚Äôve definitely doubled that before. All on one character too, no mule. It‚Äôs a booming business!
---
If you're on Xbox I'll give you every piece I come across...

---
Wholly agree. Emergency Protocol isn't as sexy as jet pack but FAR more useful. I can stand in the SBQ at 20-30 percent health with no problem. Blocker helps in the chaos too.
---
Corpses.
---
Go there now and let me know how that works out for you.
---
YepüòÅ
---
Someone is duping Snaptails
---
ALL FUCKIN HANDS ON DECK BOYS. 
---
Game is unstable, players spawn in foundations, enemies fall through ground, and other day one bugs.
---
We are aware of the issue.
---
Good call in regards to removing Blocker and adding Bandolier (my mistake and I don't know why I didn't add Bandolier as I have it on my current character). Will do that later no worries. In regards to Power Patcher whilst I agree P.A is ultra durable - especially with max rank Fix It Good - I want to keep it for when eventually the P.A needs repair. Batteries included was added as I will be holding a lot of Fusion Cores on my character as I won't be hoping about back to base etc. Thanks for replying amigo :)
---
No i just dont get how you walk around with such a bid dick all day man
---
Did that. Same problem.
---
That's actually why I'm posting and I apologize for not making that more clear. I don't have a problem seeing highly sought after items for enormous prices. That makes sense! It's when you see 1* nothings at $1k as if that is worth the 3-5 script
---
They also need to nuke duped items again. If they keep letting them float around, it‚Äôll kill this game because on the long timeline everyone will have god roll gear.
---
How about a decent rest xp system.  That would fill up while offline then reward double xp till it‚Äôs depleted 
---
Like every other mmo.  :)
---
Shooters shoot!
---
I sold my teddy bears for 25-30 caps and had trouble selling them. They eventually sold.
---
ja, aber bethesda diesen bug endlich anerkannt und best√§tigt, dass es daf√ºr einen fix geben soll (siehe antwort auf post von ladyD).
---
in english: just saying that i'm happy bethesda did aknowledge the issue and might be working on a fix for it.
---
Go to the munitions factory and repair it - then get really close to it until it registers. I took a picture from the front and it worked for me.
---
Do you mind coming to me? Don‚Äôt want to give up my workshop. Is there anything you want in return?
---
Many people are probably basing their prices off of the fact that it's incredibly easy for anyone to get at least 1,400 caps a day by selling non-Legendary items and unused aid items to robot vendors. Chemistry Stations for 2,000 caps is just ridiculous and probably a joke, but 5k for a good 2 star, or a god tier weapon is nothing.
---
Meant your comment. It was in the negative when I saw it.
---
I've had players follow me after I left world... (not friends) even ones I blocked (not just for session)
---
The only way this makes sense is if blocked, the ID is blocked (big int or guid) and not the textual name. Please Bethesda confirm this is correct.
---
Thanks for the reply but I won't be getting any mutations - also the side effect of more thirst and hunger doesn't appeal to me. Cheers amigo :)
---
Exactly this, and although it‚Äôs a controversial opinion, but they really didn‚Äôt need to be as ridiculous as they were.
---
As you should! Personally, I have less of a problem with lower level people price inflating because it gives more wealthy players the chance to help out but it would be rare to have a whale visit your CAMP and finance your next 20+ levels.
---
Have you tried the power plant near Charleston? If you interact with the helipad you can call one in
---
It seems like something changed with loading in general and it didn't used to take nearly as long as it does now. 
---
I'll start the game, head to Whitesprings club house, go inside, and nothing happens for a bit. Then I'll start hearing radiation ticks and see the red hit indicator and my health will start to drop. A couple minutes later I'll start actually seeing the scorched. It can take as long as 5 or 6 minutes total before I'll be able to actually kill anything. Once I've been playing a good 15 or 20 minutes, then I can fast travel anywhere and see enemies pretty quickly.
---
Corn soup, always. I treat myself to cranberry relish when I get the motivation to travel to the bog.
---
He's seeing you cause he is using berry mentats....
---
first thing fresh corn soup, cranberry relish and sweet blackberry tea, then go sell junk from the day before. after the daily chores I wonder around look for trouble and gather for more junk to sell the next day.
---
I have been doing this for 8 months what is wrong with me.
---
Alright dude guess you‚Äôre just gonna keep goin in circles so I guess I‚Äôll see ya in the next thread posting the same shit.
---
Haha. I'm sure Emil Pagliarulo wrote that one too! (He wrote the arrow to the knee line in Skyrim)
---
I'm fed up with people who are saying '' they are not hacking just better than you''. yes there is always someone better than you or me. Some things just don't have anything to do with ''being better''. you should know that. I always was the person saying to my friend ''no it's not a hack they are just good''. These two guys are the first time i'm sure they are in fact using illegal 3rd party programms
---
&gt;  to free up room for bigger transactions. At least that's my guess.
---
I get that completely! But if you have 4 fully stocked vendors at your CAMP with EVERYTHING marked up, I wonder why.
---
There are certain ‚Äúareas‚Äù near certain ‚Äútrain depots‚Äù that have quite a few enemies that drop alot of expensive stuff.
---
Combine that with all the junk they have in that area and in a few minutes you can sell it all for 1200 caps.....
---
I am not telling where , since I do not want to lose my farm, but look around those depots and it will come to you.
---
We‚Äôre all running different business models for personal reasons. 
---
I started out selling clothing, serums. And weapons at below market value. My machines cleared out so fast that it became a full time job to manage inventory. My team of mules was overloaded with caps. My next full time job was looking for places to spend them. 
---
I found a price point above average. Sales have slowed to a trickle and I can go back to playing 76 again.
---
I'd want the 15 strength for carry weight and damage. I think I'd add a utility pick there (e.g. traveling pharmacy 2) instead of upping iron fist.
---
I'd also run a higher perception. I'd go to 3 for utility picks. With a 1 you cannot even pick higher locks or hack higher terminals. Maybe you're relying on your partner for those things.
---
You don't need barbarian, evasive, and ironclad. There are diminishing returns to armor. You might swap to lifegiver, or drop evasive and direct the points over to Str.
---
Inspirational is okay, but I expect you'll transition to lone wanderer, suppressor (1), and/or tenderizer (1).
---
You also don't need bloody mess. Your damage will already be plenty high, but enjoy it if you have the points to spare.
---
All of those are minor suggestions, but this build is totally viable without changes.
---
Oh, and I'd add the speed demon mutation.
---
I just audibly groaned. Ouch. This is like watching one of those videos where you see someone on a skateboard launch themselves crotch-first into a metal railing and you flinch involuntarily because all those mirror neurons in your brain start firing, *except way worse*.
---
To echo what everyone else has said both of the effects got heavily nerfed.    
---
Explosive is still the best secondary effect for most builds, but some specialized builds might benefit more from other effects.  A luck/crit build for example might get more mileage out of 50% vats crit damage.  
---
The rationale for AA being better than 2 shot has to do with how DR works in the game.  The thing is, a lot of players don't understand how armor actually works very well so it's not always true that AA &gt; TS.    
---
Rather, if you don't  have perks and/or receivers with AP on it, then AA is the best option for most applications.  But if you have a lot of AP from other sources, you might actually be better off with 2 shot or at the least it's a close call and they are roughly equal.  
---
So anyway, TSE is still a very good combination of effects and top tier, but in the current meta bloodied explosive is god tier.
---
This guy just pm saying i better watch out he know my name and who i am. He might actually just be mad because he got out hacked
---
The pharma event has 3\* legendary creatures in it. However, I'd get at least the basic backpack if you don't use PA. It's not that hard if you do the athletic, archer and swimming tad pole challenges.
---
two shot damage took a damage nerf too, which kinda killed tse's being top dogs back when game launched. two shot was originally double damage ( the step above instigating) then add in explosive when it was 100% dmg and then doubled with exp expert a tse shotgun (combat) perked out could hit 1200 dmg base before any sneak perks kicked in or anything else. then add in like a shotguns amount of pellets, each one exploding for 1200 dmg in a radius around them, could level the whole group of ghouls in club house in 1 shot. (pre nerf i was a sneak/shotgun main using a TSE combat shotgun)  
---
thing with two shot it, horrid accuracy like a ts lever is almost useless with things at distance, even scoped in you can see bullets pass to the right and left of what your aiming at and unless its close or huge you will miss more than hit. single shots have better accuracy, alot less chance of missing, with snipers, first shot is one that matters so grail for them is instigating/explosive lever (for higher punch dmg) or instigating/explosive combat shotgun (little less dmg but less and faster reloads, larger magazines). for the 1 shot 1 kill motto of snipers, then anything that lives through first shot they usually switch to a furious, anti armor explosive, executioners, suppressors, or a group specific rifle.   
---
instigating on rifles hard to find and expensive because of 1 shot kill ability, but instigating on most anything else is relatively cheap since with your first hit the weapon loses its instigating bonus to the rest of the damage.   
---
so thats why you see the rise of thing like furious explosive, anti armor explosive, executioners or suppressors, they are more consistent in over all damage from start to finish with the exception of furious which scales up massively if you dont miss any. with anti armor coming in as the favored choice since it doesnt suffer from accuracy loss of a TS, or dmg loss from a Furious that misses, the dmg drop on a second or more shot of an instigating.  
---
now sets i have left out of this because they require specific builds are bloodied and junkies, since they are not just a general  "im gonna be a sniper/heavy gunner/machine gunner/pistol" they are situational and built into a specific play style.    
---
hope this helps some.
---
Before vendors existed, I struggled to save $1K caps but now, I spend at least $2K a day and make double that if I'm on a server for more than 4 hours. Rebuilding Appalachia through vendors!
---
Get off mah lawn you damned communist.
---
In all seriousness though, what is and isnt a good price for an item is up to the seller. The introduction of the vending machines was not the beginning of trading in FO76 and fairly stable pricing has been in this game, though we all dealt with inflation. The main issue I see is with players using the games suggested value in setting a real value for an item and not using other sources. This is ok for some items that are always sold in a vending bot as that sets a ceiling for the price. However on legendary items, the vendor bots are not selling them and the suggested value has no basis in how useful an item is. This is why a normal assault rifle is valued at more than a legendary item. With legendary items you can literally look back through actual trades on reddit trade subs for the past 6 months and see the price an item sold for.
---
I am a middle tier trader and focus mainly on 1-2\* USEFUL legendary items and curate my stock quite heavily. I have roughly 60 legendary weapons and 30 legendary armor pieces for sale and you will not find a medic or nocturnal or mutants weapon in my shop, unless it's explosive or fire rate. My goal is to sell you an item you actually want without having to jump server 50 times to find it. However, I charge for this service. 1\* legendaries start at 750 caps and go up to 3k. A 3k 1\* legendary would be something that you can definitely build a character around and not have to replace for a while. Examples would be a bloodied handmade or an instigating super sledge / DC gauntlet. 2\* items usually go for between 1.5k caps (has a good primary but secondary sucks) to 8-10k (useful primary and complimentary secondary on a popular weapon base). For this type of shop I usually pull in 10k every few days but I also only play 1-2 hours a day.
---
As far as better items go, I have higher tier weapons and armor including a furious explosive gatling gun, and AA fire rate minigun, a TSE lever action, and multiple pieces of sentinel / chavelier gear for sale. However, most of these pieces are not in my vending machine. They are worth way more than your theoretical 5k outrage price and I don't have the cap space for their sale by caps.
---
"level upping" 
---
nice.
---
yeah....just buff your rad resistance and spam the collect button on a river.
---
pop a rad-x so you only take 1 rad from drinking/collecting and i'll grab 100+ dirty water samples then boil them down at a cooking station.
---
I've done it three times, failed every time. I don't even go anymore because I got tires of going through 30 stimpaks trying to relay multiple pylons while the rest of my team does fuck all.
---
Literally the least fun event in the game.
---
Yeah. I don't get the mindset with some of these really expensive common items or mediocre legendaries. I wish I could sell ammo for less than 1 cap each, but I've seen 308 priced more than the ammo vending machines.
---
I'm not stupid. I should have included berry mentats in my text. 99% of situations were out of range of anything like that. But thanks
---
On your last point, I agree 100% but that wasn't something I was trying to refute. I'm simply perplexed as to why people inflate EVERYTHING in their CAMP. Surely you'd visit other camps and then attempt to "price check" your wares?
---
Steve the ~~pirate~~ err Deathclaw!
---
Personally....that was too high. TS is not very useful by itself and the dragon is not a great weapon, but you got away with it. Great example of why no one should be writing posts like this and telling people how to run their shop.
---
 I am thinking this is probably the case.  That kinda blows but I could see why they would do something like that.  Thanks for the response
---
Honestly, even though it‚Äôs annoying, imo it‚Äôs like 3 steps forward, one step back because they‚Äôve been making great progress progress from launch, even if some bugs and exploits do pop up from time to time.
---
I've never seen a post where the FWM isn't referred to as  an alien........
---
Yeah I'm tired of all the Nocturnal emissions from enemies.

As you should! Personally, I rarely see them for less than $5k

That's why I started out with a stupid name like.... "FarPlace" it was one of those dumb suggestions that MS gives you when you create your account/ Say yes to the un-read terms and conditions and later found out that is how the world will know you for 10+ years later... Yup.. My name stuck and .... still is my name even on the PC. My kid got something like Opaque table.. or some other dumb crap... :P but i still wear my badge proudly....

How about we can opt in for double XP...I am in no hurry to get to the 'finish line'.

I get that my main missed some quest completes for doing them in the beta bet FFS guys,  this is old now.
---
On the up side, there are at least 2 vendors on any given server at any given moment with serums for a few hundred caps.
---
that all being said from the point of view of a lvl 267 sneak/vats/rifle built character, i still use a TSE handmade set with a dot sight and AP stats for the SBQ fights and can chew her hp down pretty quickly with it. but im crouched (hidden or caution) to the side or behind her and close enough the accuracy isnt going to matter since im shooting at something the size of a barn.
---
Try deleting your fallout76.ini and fallout76prefs.ini files in the documents folder. The game will regenerate them and they'll be fixed if they got bugged out. Reinstalling the game usually doesn't fix them because the game leaves the files in the my documents section installed after you uninstall and doesn't replace them with new ones on a reinstall because they're already there.

---
its even worse if you're a console pleb. hacking on console and pc are two different things.''
---
To explain why this isn't op any more, in the past 2 shot added an additional projectile at 100% damage and demo expert went to 100% damage boost (iirc).
---
So when explosive was 100% damage as well (since nerfed to 20%) you would get 2 projectiles each with an extra 100% damage from explosive so that's a total of 4x  damage than the base weapon. 
---
A gun that normally does 100 damage would do 400.  Demolitions expert would increase that substantially 
---
They removed the 2nd projectile and dropped 2 shot to flat 25% damage boost, and also dropped explosive to 20%.  So the same example above that 100 damage weapon now only does 145.  Demo expert is nerfed to 60% but it's 60% of 20% so in the example above we are at 157 total damage.
---
One lap ws then Wes tek, Jump server. Repeat
---
Yeah I wish they had done a sweep to get the new duper accounts out of here. The items are all coded the same so it wouldn't even be that hard. Now that we're this far removed from it though it's nearly impossible.
---
Lol I was waiting for the Communist comment.

I agree with everything you said and I'm seeing a shift in the market as we've had vendors for awhile now.

This is also a possible problem solving issue. Lots of tiny issues can be fixed in a day, especially items left in a test mode or simple database entries.

Well crap looks like I'm back to taking pictures

Thank you for the nice info!!!
---
&gt;The queen fight was inside the nuke zone because some people are just too stupid to function
---
The irony would be that the guy you said was "too stupid to function" was the same guy that both dropped the nuke and took your flux.
---
That's a fair point but to play devil's advocate, why even have a vendor if you don't really care to profit? I assume you just want some passive income but you could still make a killing on just selling Serums at market price. Maybe just list 10-20 a day?
---
As far as I know, Scorched Earth has always had a pop up, but only if you're already in the Cranberry Bog
---
I had one but I traded for scrip. The exploding shots end up killing you since you need to be close to enemies to do any damage due to low range 
---
Not as food as you think it would be
---
All I asked is why you‚Äôre so obsessed with searching up threads about PC versions of games and then posting the same exact comment in every one. And your only response was to play the victim card.

i found a death claw hide from a small orange metal box. so random.

That's pretty common in games with microtransactions.

That‚Äôs too much of a hassle

Can't speak for u/dragonfyre77, but I built all of the required instruments in my camp and played until well-tuned on each, then when that didn't work, AFKed for a couple of hours on the guitar just wiggling the mouse every 20 minutes or so to keep from getting an activity disconnect. Then repeated at Watoga High School and the Nukashine. Nothing involving playing instruments registers.
---
Definitely! And that's my largest point. The market clearly favors those selling below value - although subjective in my analysis - or at least reasonable value.
---
Nocturnal Mister Sandman build for disgusting night time damage!
---
That‚Äôs a good idea

Nocturnal would be cool if it didn't debuff during the day. Then it would be like day&gt;normal, night&gt;powerful, but right now it's like day&gt;useless, night&gt;ohIleftthatcrapinmystash

In FO4 you could control when you were out and about so a nocturnal build was a thing.

EU doesn't matter for Bethesda. It is not their primary marketing area. Servers are laggy as hell in Europe and barely stay online 1-2 hour before crashing.
---
Which is crazy! I've seen every ammo type at 1 cap and it only takes a few vendor hops before I find that price and yet, people still list it at the suggested price.
---
Ahh ok, I was just going off of this part,
---
&gt; Do people actually dropp $5K for 1* or even 2* legendaries that are Bloodied, TSE, AAE, god tier?
---
But yeah, there are lot of dumb people out there. Maybe it's all that radiation? lol
---
The same site that lists fallout 4 as having more players than FO76... LOL which you just shared has roughly 10k players.
---
Same here. Couldn't play much during the last one and I could really use some extra level ups :D
---
Same, things have improved greatly since I switched from a lead to acid node as I'm swimming in lead from Lucky Hole.
---
Having invested literal hours into trying to get musical instrument playing to register, I unfortunately agree with you. Bethesda's priorities are in the right place on this.

That's so.... (‚òû Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)‚òû Rad, dude!

Try the one that spawns for collision course. It descends slow

I mostly leave it at the default.
---
That's why we got B to move them to Aid..
---
there's still bugs but way less than in December.  Just jump back in and see if it catches your interest.
---
as for builds it really depends on how you want to play.  melee, stealth, heavy weapons, power armor, etc.  You gotta have a general idea of what you want to do to get build advice.
---
If you want to just follow the meta search for bloodied builds and shop for bloodied weapons and unyielding armor at player shops. You still gotta know if you want to dip into melee, ranged, and/or stealth or PA though :P
---
Ahh! Should say "aren't" - I'll update.  Thanks for the correction!
---
I went to the power plant in the mire and fixed the helipad, I had to take at least a dozen pictures before it registered. I had to be right next to the damn thing and at a really weird angle I managed to get a shot that counted.

It's a real mess tbh.
---
They just dropped one on my server if you're on PS4 lol
---
I've done it both ways and it still randomly will ask me to login again.  It's not 100% but it feels like a 5050 chance.

Yeah if you look at my reply above I say as much about storing login info in plaintext.

Just some context: The going rate for a 1\* Bloodied max lvl handmade before vending machines was 10k. The price has gone down since the most recent duping and the intro of vending but the player probably thought they where low balling you.

Yup, realized that once I found /Fo76bazaar

I just trying to suggest ways to make the game more fun, like u and a friend on a handcar

They are old dupes that are still around. The rollback from crashing server dupe is still active and the devs know.
---
Gotcha. No problem.
---
In what world is half a month one week?
---
Rule 1 - Don't bring junk to a boss fight.
---
It's more action packed than the queen which is a "wait til she lands then wail on her" strategy. But yes very expensive. Hope Bethesda adds more events which require strategy to finish. And server wide announcements!! Bring everyone together!
---
The old dupe from patch 9 got fixed the day after. Todays was for the one that arose today
---
Not really as long as you know how to keep an animal alive and do the trough
---
&gt; you can have an arbitrary number of wildly different items in your inventory
---
And millions of NON-STACKABLE Marine Tactical Helmets and Civil War Era Top Hats in players and vendors inventories to add...
---
is that a bloodied explosive handmade?
---
And like ive told you, i enjoy reading and posting in discussions, threads and topics that interest me, i stand by all of my comments 100%, you don't get to dicate to me and if you want to obsess over me then that is your own personal problem.
---
Nice, I wanted to get a quad explosive double barrel, prior to the shotgun nerf last week.
---
100
---
it just makes the dupers rich. Sure 1-50 more people will have access to end game weapons, but also the legit farmers get screwed. No point in buying a mid level item when u can buy the end game one for 25% more.
---
That's about the time everybody else sees trade emotes when your trying to either switch weapons or wrong key for favs..
---
Yeah I know how to do it. Are you on now?
---
I didn‚Äôt give enough time at all
---
You don‚Äôt necessarily need good programmers you just need competent one
---
I don't care what they state they weigh with all the visual bugs, I know bulked steel takes up like 2/3'rd the space unbulked steel does in my stash.
---
For armor, I use 2 bolstering pieces, 2 unyielding pieces, and 1 chameleon. Unyielding makes you stronger, bolstering keeps you from dying before you can use a stimpak.
---
TL;DR is longer than the read üòÜ
---
If you can keep a secret, i can tell you about place i wander around at.
---
East of westek and south of the satallite\radio tower (?) there is a camp with tents and such and below it off the cliff is a junk extractor point
---
The side effect is neglible. But the 20 percent faster movement is huge in PA

I don‚Äôt know how to save my password; must be Bethesda‚Äôs fault.

Mine sell for 225 and I make a killing
---
Salty preteen is salty, yes
---
I‚Äôm looking for the same.. lvl 233.. it‚Äôs painful in there ha.. GT DrWattzo.. im on most afternoons.. uk time
---
I could fill up my stash with nothing but junk and it wouldn't be enough space.  Stupid is junk not being weightless in stash, since its just a list of items and everyone has them.
---
Find a niche you enjoy, wait until the bad coding and/or griefers ruin it for you, quit, go sit on Reddit instead.
---
In fact, same thing happened to me as well. he didn't 1shot me but he always knew where I was like, I was steathboied from half a mile away and he just starts shooting and first bullet lands on my face I mean wtf man. I heard of some mods highlighting stealthed users so it may be a mod rather than hacks. I really don't think allowing mods in an online game is a good idea
---
I also have a Quad Cryolator that I use just for the imposter Sheepsquatch event.
---
Previously he did not count towards taking picture of a alien - glad to see they've updated it.
---
Added you. When would you like to do a run? I have to pick my daughter up from school at 245 central us time but I‚Äôm free after 300-315.
---
Aluminium because I desperately needed it at the time lol
---
Haven't tried yet but I was also a little confused when they had both FWM and an alien. Aren't they the same damn thing now?
---
...But why are they all subtle jabs at PC gaming? And why are they all phrased exactly the same? I legit thought you were a bot at first. And it‚Äôs not like this is a recent thing. I‚Äôve seen you doing this for at least a year straight now.
---
terrible1fi
---
Good to know.  I wonder if today's was known to some before it was revealed as well...  I see enough evidence that there's been dupes in the market more recently than patch 9.  Really glad to hear that Bethesda is responding quickly at least once they know.
---
Not bad. I got a zealot's explosive weightless 10mm smg from her last night. Haven't tried it out yet.
---
Also,  any idea on how her name is supposed to be pronounced?
---
&gt;I might sound salty but I'm not. I'm sure without duping I probably wouldn't have half the items I've traded for and bought off others. This is just the ugly reality of the game
---
it's funny because it's true. yet, few people are taking on their pitchforks and asking for better rng. there's clearly an issue when you have to rely on exploits to get good gear.
---
either nerf legendaries to the ground or improve the odds of rolling them. or, better yet, buff the majority of affixes so they're not completely useless. 80% of them exist solely to worsen the rng. getting rid of creature-specific ones alone would help immensely.
---
the Fo4 legendary roll system was never good. difference is that nobody cared about legendaries, mostly because casual players weren't even aware of them, and the people who did **LOCKED** them. they never actually farmed for explosives shotguns.
---
That is awesome
---
its in the whitespings building. at one of the vendors on the bottom floor.
---
Get on the Xbox LFG and find people running the queen - the post there all day - same with other events like Arktos Pharma or just run West Tek.
---
I think I have another one. You on playstation?
---
And lots of new friend requests!
---
Maybe a fat man?
---
What‚Äôs the price-point for legendary weapons, assuming it‚Äôs to scrip?
---
My brother found his near-
---
Just wondering had a few buddies where it worked and some where it didn't.. Sucks it's bugged out :(
---
I've played one character to 125 and another to 36 and have yet to pull a decent shotgun from any legendary or machine. I've gotten ONE legendary shotgun in all my time playing and it was a one Star with two shot. Thanks for the one extra pellet guyz. 
---
The RNG gods detest me.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and as I said I check the whitesprings vendor every night including server hopping!!!
---
*Whoosh*
---
Be grateful it wasn't, God forbid, a Junkie's.

---
Its not ones fixed are back its they keep making more then they fix. Circle of Bethesda! Fun fact Lever Action Rifle reload still broken in Fallout 4.
---
On PS4 so I‚Äôm no help, but if you‚Äôre trying to get the backpack I‚Äôve got two tips. First, make sure to shut down the robots right after initializing the experiment. To do this, go through the keypad door (970930), go to the basement and to the terminal in a room down there, get the shut down code, then go back to the first terminal and select the shut down option. Now when you complete the event, you should get the backpack skin. 
---
Secondly, if you‚Äôve already done that, you may have missed the pop up saying the skin is unlocked. Apparently it appears at the top left, not under the rewards section. I didn‚Äôt think I had gotten it yet but then checked my skins at an armor bench and sure enough, I had it already. So maybe check that first.
---
Yeah what's your GT

cranberry cobbler. plus 5 XP. find cranberries in abundance at arronholt. corn soup. blackberry juice. firecracker berry juice.

Yeah, they love destroying things people actually use.

I‚Äôd love to be able to ask their therapists wtf is going on inside those heads.

The only thing ws needed was someone to turn off the ring video that‚Äôs playing in one of those locked rooms- last few weeks every other damn ghoul wants to cosplay and I‚Äôm tired of being ankle bitten to death under a pile of corpses
---
You just said it goes from 1.6 to 1.5 and now you're saying 33% decrease. That would be from 1.6 to like 1.1
---
Ferment alcohol 10 times is the current daily. Try that
---
Food never spoils, it gives you almost no rads which is good when you are trying to manage rads under 19% health and one can will give you about half a health bar.
---
Near where?
---
My man!
---
It's not tagged as a creature, probably.  I'm wondering if there's some bug that checks if a player hasn't been around in a while in an area, kills everything nearby, then reloads the area with new spawns.  That last step gets screwed up somehow but pets load in quickly enough to get caught in the second step.  I'm not a programmer so I really don't know however.
---
How are you defining the markup? There is no production cost on these items. The only thing that defines the cost of an item is 1) the rarity of getting the item (legendary drop vs common spawn vs sold by bot) and 2) How much demand there is for the item. So what is this a 1000% of?
---
Thanks!!
---
&gt;I have run out of Radaway
---
This is the primary reason to accept a team request in a blast zone..
---
I'm always offering up joins as I share Rad Sponge ALL THE TIME in a blast zone. For those that don't know, Rad Sponge level 1 or 2 are good enough to keep 2 or more people rad free the entire time in a Blast zone. BUT you have to stay with in 25 meters of another teammate.  Every time you take rads, you wash off x rads of a teammate. this exchange is crazy wonderful. 100% duty cycle in a blast zone with no Rad-Away/Rax-X!!!
---
So next time you see a team invite in a blast zone TAKE IT!
---
You can drop out of a team later or just remove friend requests etc.. so take the advantage for the time in the blast area.
---
Why the hell don't deathclaws drop their OWN hides?  How are these hides appearing in containers and inventories of other creatures if they didn't come from a deathclaw?
---
Possibly because this quest isn‚Äôt finished and their will be more added to it in later updates, but of course you‚Äôre free to make assumptions all so you have something to complain and moan about. Carry on.
---
Oh I did not know thanks is there a way to get doggie food constantly?
---
After seeing this, this made me want the quad explosive double barrel.
---
https://gfycat.com/mixedfrightenedirishwaterspaniel-fallout-76
---
its ongoing,  i imagine we wont be done with it till the 3rd season of patches comes out
---
Junkies is a desirable affix, 50% damage with 5 addictions. 2 of which can be suppressed by drinking and picking a chem. A recent patch made addictions permeate through death.
---
 Not online at the moment but launch 10 mini nukes or throw 10 nuka grenades?
---
It‚Äôs hard to come up with a weapon name that matches the perks.
---
My hunting rifle is called Dusk Firelight; because it‚Äôs increased damage at night (Dusk), explosive (fire) and 90% reduced weight (light). It gets hard to figure names out.
---
did they fix the crashing issue yet?  I tried once, and the game crashed when the 3 star legendary 'squatch appeared...
---
No, I said that is what another player checked yesterday when I told them that. That was with zero weight reduction perks.
---
Source of the player checking it and saying that: https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/buenvw/why_the_hell_does_scrap_all_scrap_all_of_your/epbn2w0/
---
Well according to a few friends of mine who have competed it, it should go away.
---
If they bring more in the future, they can reactivate it.
---
You are a charming person aren‚Äôt you?
---
tonight sure.. also anytime you see me in game I can do this too..
---
You‚Äôd make people mad, but I think they‚Äôll be more mad when the game dies because everyone is a god.
---
like he is soooo mature haha. kid i may be older than you also i wrote a serious text idk why you are hating this much but go on
---
&gt;it's funny because it's true. yet, few people are taking on their pitchforks and asking for better rng. there's clearly an issue when you have to rely on exploits to get good gear.
---
Not good gear.  Perfect gear.  You can make do with less, but too many players want the best of everything with as little effort as possible, so they can dominate others.
---
What you're actually fighting is toxic human instinct.  It hasn't been solved in 100,000 years, and it's not going to be solved anytime soon, much less in a random online game.
---
And to do what you say - to make everyone else pay the price for these people - it never works.  You punish us, but the ones who deserve it simply don't care.  They'll find another way to game the system, because it's all they know how to do.
---
nah i made sure recon scope (highlighting) couldnt be used
---
Watoga restaurants have about 15 to 25 cans daily
---
What do you want them to do to these players and how should they weed them out?
---
I‚Äôm guessing all the best weapons and armor I bought were duped, I‚Äôd be fine giving it up if I knew everyone had the same thing happen to them.
---
I think people have tried - but its fallen on deaf ears.  A lot of people wanted the ability to reroll legendary effects via the Purveyor, instead we just get another yet another RNG attempt.
---
I have gotten better rolls of late though - I'm still convinced the game has a skew system too.  If you use/keep legendary explosive weapons, you'll get more legendary explosive weapons.  Its even worse if you don't own them, you'll seldom roll those effects then in your legendary farming.
---
Level 171 and a level 162, desperately would like to run this with people who know what they're doing. Xbox, plays evenings every day
---
Agreed. Although I don‚Äôt have great stuff at my camp at the moment
---
If the topic or subject is similar then my reply and response will be similar, otherwise that would make me a hypocrite. 
---
Again i stand by my comment 100%, if you got triggered by my on topic and true response to the subject of the thread because you were salvating over my profile, then that is your problem not mine.
---
Not salty; just truth. Bethesda, whether intentionally or not, effectively rewards dupers and cheaters with its weak stance on the topic. The risk vs. reward for such activity is simply, undeniably, and ludicrously lopsided, in favor of the aberrant behavior. Nothing short of a full item/cap wipe could even come close to restoring a modicum of economic stability to the game, and I doubt seriously that Bethesda has the moral fortitude to pull that off.
---
thats a good fnnnig idea I had the same thing happen to me once no where near lost as much loot but yeah that could work....
---
How do I access it?
---
The build is around stimpak. First-Aid Perk increases their effectiveness and Field Surgeon makes them work faster. I activate all three pylons and its usually not a big deal. The Imposter Sheepsquatch's melee attack is devastating even with full troubleshooters (Bethesda accidentally overpowered its attack making it ignore all armor or something). 
---
Some people use Cola Perk and Nuka Cola Quantums. It works. Probably better. Just not as easy to farm for me. 
---
Also, I've seen where people with high sneak builds can activate the pylons then go invisible. While invisible they can regenerate health with the mutation while others kill the imposter.
---
Had it happen to me this there day too at the scrip machine at white spring. Don't think he liked the QE harpoon round that one shot him when I turned around lol
---
Glad you were able to get this worked out!  I'll get the swimming revive eventually, it's not a priority for me at the moment since I already finished the order of the tadpole.  If my buddy has issues with the other badges and wants to get swimmer, we will definitely try that place out!
---
Could you invite? I‚Äôm lvl 217 btw
---
Bro it is at whitespring resort it‚Äôs on side with the ammo benches n stash box
---
Says the dude who is whining about disabled people calling out major companies that just ignore them. Do you also find people who take issue with places not having handicap parking or wheelchair ramps as "Must be tons of fun at parties."?
---
If you use a non armor piercing gun that shoots shot to attack an enemy that has high armor...  you are going to have a bad time.
---
That said, if you dont set up your stats/perks right and also dont keep up on your mods for guns you are going to have a really tough time pre level 50 in this game.  It really is quite brutal.  Ive had to fix my gfs spec 3 times in 120 levels cause all of a sudden shes back to no damage and too many deaths.
---
Also a few guns/weaps are quite garbage even once legendary.  The assault rifle immediately comes to mind.
---
Lol no. I was there last night, I got legendary mobs. People post sky is falling nerf posts about whitesprings _all the time_ and they  generally speaking are just  "I had bad luck on one run, waaah" posts.
---
Today's was for the one that hit Youtube yesterday. It should go without saying that by the time an exploit hits Youtube, the damage is already done.
---
I'm on Xbox. US Eastern Time. Maybe sometime this weekend. I'll try to remember to post here. I've got a discord nuke group where I usually post events.
---
What finish line? 
---
This game literally doesn't even have an ending yet
---
If I see it in at vendor when I am in-game next I'll give it a go. Do you know if it works with the Charisma Perk for faster movement speed as well?
---
Nah it hit youtube 3 hours before the patch
---
If they want to never sell anything, pricing items higher is the way to go. Even if they do sell high to an unwitting buyer, the cap limit will bite them in the ass anyway. In other words, don't worry about it, the market weeds out the outliers. They will either adjust their pricing or continue to sell nothing but to the idiots.
---
/u/Valseek Howdy! Can we get some word on the hooded rags not being a cosmetic clothing item?
---
Every item in the game has a value associated to it - for instance, when I pick up a standard assault rifle at 50% cnd, it is listed at 102 caps. 
---
So, with 1000% markup, it would be listed as ~1,000.
---
Imo I can totally see a cap sink in using the Bot Stops. Yes they aren‚Äôt suppose to work until 2078,(clearly MODUS didn‚Äôt get that memo). 
---
But I can see it doing things like:
---
2000c: mark an area that will spawn food and drinks for players that‚Äôs consumed when activated
---
3000c: mark an area that starts an event ‚Äúcapture the bot‚Äù
---
500-1500c: rent a bot. Choose between a handy/nanny, protectron/assaultron or sentry bot. Which will follow you around and whatnot for few hours. 
---
Anything that can be used to trade out caps is good.
---
People will still dupe even if it's easier to get good items. They don't dupe because they need the items, they dupe because they can. Sure, some people are motivated by the ability to make money on ebay or wherever they're selling them, but the ability to dupe is the issue. 
---
The widespread availability of god-tier items is a huge contributing factor to people feeling like they need god-tier items, when in reality... they don't *need* them. Decent Legendaries are completely fine for how most people play, and RNG hurdles without the existence of duping add incentive to play the game that they enjoy.
---
Not sure. You do need starched genes perk rank 2 to not lose it with radaway or decontamination arc
---
It wasn‚Äôt a lie, just a truth untold. Go live it in full, my wasteland child.
---
&gt; In other words, don't worry about it
---
Ah! The solution to most "1st world" problems.
---
question
---
if i have the advanced hacker perk can I unequip the basic?
---
same goes for lockpick
---
maybe someone over at r/hoarding can help man.
---
Keep grinding events and you'll get enough items to profit from.
---
I love it when toxic sociopathic griefer assholes say they aren't "evil". I worry for your friends and family in fucking real life, let alone the whole "not wanting to share a server with you" dude.   
---
On top of that, when turrets can out-last a fucking level 60 molerat, let alone a fucking toxic sack of shit like yourself, that argument will have merit. Until then, turrets are fucking garbage.
---
Hahah I had that same issue with my buddy, all he had was diluted stimpaks so when I jumped off the tower in the pioneer scout camp and cratered he couldn't revive me.  Had to drop him a normal stim and jump again :D
---
Although it wasn't a TSE, I did get a TS shotgun, and when I used it it was worse than the normal shotgun I was using before, the accuracy was terrible.
---
How is that unbalanced? Also, it doesn't always work that way and I never worry about splash damage.
---
But that number is bullshit for legendary items. The main driver of item value for weapons and armor is whether it is modded and how much it weighs. It would have me believe that a totally game changing 1* bloodied handmade with no mods is worth less than a useless but fully modded up assault rifle that dropped off a super mutant in mass numbers.
---
Edit: also if you are basing your value off of a percentage of that number you are charging people less or more based on your charisma score and if you have hard bargain equipped.
---
I died 3 times (2 of them being spawn killed) and lost all my canned dog food (about 175) all my Salisbury steaks (about 150) all my radaways and rad x's included diluted for both which was about 300 in total, over 100 stimpacks, all my disease cures and about 75% of my purified water. Plus a bunch of my other stuff. Hard lesson to be learnt about Survival mode. It's like they want you to carry nothing on you.
---
did we get any notes with this update?
---
eh, not entire true. while you can certainly make do with a 1\* bloodied weapon, that's only because the bloodied mechanic itself is op- which is not to say it should be nerfed. without it and sneak we'd be fighting ghouls with peashooters.
---
sentinel and cavalier on the other hand are tier 3 mods, and they should to be paired with assassin to be effective, especially after the nerf. a zealot's sentinel piece is useless.
---
Bloodied anything seems to be worth a lot lately.
---
Just look the standard bloodied build.
---
Could you send a link?
---
Read the button prompts. They changed the way to do so.
---
Sometimes I forget to dump my junk before I start the Impostor fight (or I pick up a few screws from the Wendigo that spawns there). What I do is place my paper bag behind the open door to the cabin. Nobody ever looks there lol.
---
I don‚Äôt run it or anything. Just google/YT search you‚Äôll find it.
---
On PS4 it‚Äôs R3 (push down on toggle) to inspect the weapon, and then while in the inspection screen the command keys across the bottom of the screen change. Push down on touch pad to rename weapons.
---
Removing it from your inventory wipes out the name.
---
Ah hah! That makes sense, I was at watoga showing a buddy that just started what it looks like when a nuke drops
---
There's not a lot they can do at this point, as the damage is already done.  Just keep on patching out exploits quickly.
---
The only thing they could do better is implement detailed logging/tracking of activity in game so they can always identify which accounts used an exploit and take action in the future.  There's a cost associated to doing that level of logging though - so its highly unlikely.
---
It's not fun for your victims, douche.
---
That goddamn thing has so much potential but it is so useless atm.
---
&gt; I doubt if Bethesda will ever take a strong enough stance against duping to fix it.
---
They are ruining the product. 
---
Duping is the worst cancer and the worst publicity for a game, that makes millions of potential customers to avoid it.
---
Average game users are not going to buy a game where, paying the same, there are two groups of users:
---
* Those who need to make big efforts to get anything‚Ä¶ or to go to eBay/ali/websites to buy it with real money.
---
* Those who get infi caps and all the top stuff for free.
---
Within a minutes I found one and a friend found another. Someone else piped up on party chat that they also had a piece (all Heavy Leather and powered). I traded for the last two pieces and ended up spending about 8k for both in separate trades.
---
This does it even if you close the launcher completely, and lets you launch the game without needing the launcher. Which lets you add it to steam which means if I want I can stream it over my router to my TV if I want.
---
I agree. My main is a bloody build, so I can't do that. This one is not, and I do run rad sponge shared. No one wanted to team up though.
---
Usually, a "team up" followed by "irradiated" emotes gets the point across.
---
Ayeeeeeeeee
---
You click the home button and go left twice to where your party chat normally is and there should be a "looking for group" option and then it will make you select a game and the posts should show up from there.
---
Ok cool thx for the info.üëç
---
You read it wrong. They removed explosive from energy weapons, so those are all legacy items at this point. For ballistic guns, they cut the damage from 2 shot from +100% to +25%, and nerfed the explosive damage by a significant amount (I can't recall the exact percent).  You used to be able to grab any old TSE and steamroll mobs even without perks. Now you need to spec into the weapon type and have a few points of demo expert to make them "good" again.
---
Same with workshops. I have situations of ‚Äúdo I reaaaallly want to try and take this place?‚Äù Knowing the level would make it a tad bit easier to judge that
---
If there is say total 86 recipes in the game (I know it's just an example) and 10 mis-fires your guaranteed to never get the atoms for the 76 learned, which the others can have. Us, because we were dedicated per-order fools, can't. Yes, I per-ordered and paid the full price and now I suffer the loss of  many of those free atoms from achievements met and un-paid because the system won't detect we have pre-discovered/ already learned them.
---
The true fans are not getting the love and are being taught to never pre-order a Bethesda game.
---
From what I understand, Nocturnal is actually more likely to drop at night, which I'm not fond of as a game mechanic because it discourages Legendary hunting at night.
---
It's a junk effect.  I'll take it if it's something like Nocturnal Sentinel, but it doesn't have any value on its own.
---
People are weird some of the downvotes will be people thinking along the lines of "I speak English and it's fine they need to spend time on MY issues, not problems other people have" And that's without implying racism -.- 
---
Best practice is to just ignore them people gonna be people and people are often shit.
---
I was hoping Bethesda would use the time between DLC to balance some of the items. Sucks getting useless stuff. If they buff some of the weaker affixes we might see more build variety.
---
I'd say they absolutely are trying to make atom challenges as hard as possible. I know others will say they are doable with help, but not everyone wants to be forced to play with other people, multiplayer or not.
---
The other night I fell asleep while playing and I woke up 3k capa richer. I had no idea what I sold lol.
---
No - you go to a work bench and it should give you the option to workbench repair. You don't need repair kits at all.
---
I did the same thing last evening, almost bought atoms cause I like that outfit, did a few grinding daily challenges and managed to make enough atoms to get the outfit. I have been after that since the game came out cause they showed something in the trailers where someone was wearing a tire as armor.
---
Really?  That was a serious text?
---
I feel bad now.  Please let your special ed teacher know I apologize
---
My self-imposed limitation is that I'll only spend on atoms half the cost of whatever I want. So if I don't have half the cost in atoms I earned, I can't buy that shiny new thing they want to sell. The longer it takes me to earn atoms, the less overall money they'll make off of me.
---
Ok, seems very OP. However, do you see it being OP for much longer?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs why I still love the uranium fever event. Mole miners are easy to kill so if nobody‚Äôs there I‚Äôll just one shot them

---
Your friends are full of shit. Even if you find all 17 holotapes the quest will still show as incomplete. All you can do at this point is unselect it so it stops showing up on the screen.
---
Yeah. The mod made them use the same rules as settlers in that regard.  At one point I had every Minuteman in the castle packing a minigun.  Then I figured out that automatic plasma rifles actually have a higher DPS than the minigun.
---
that's highly subjective. like I said a couple posts above, in some cases you really do need the "best". and not everyone is greedy, I spend quite some time in the market and lots of people are desperate to get their hands on their god roll, so much they'd cheat for it.
---
but that's it. when they do, they just go back to the game and enjoy their new piece of rng. they don't keep pushing for more and more god rolls.
---
not saying people like that don't exist, just saying it depends on the person. it's not a one-size-fits-all.

For a while, it was Corn Soup because it's easy to prepare and satisfies food and drink.  But I've been on an all-day food diet for a while now and it works pretty well.  Glowing Steak is useful if I know I'm going to run the SBQ though.
---
I heard about shutting them down but never knew it would help with getting the drop. I‚Äôll try this now thanks!
---
If no one's gotten it for you in the next  3 hours I'll be on and I'll buy it for you friend.
---
Rarity and weapon balance shouldn't be connected directly. Sure make stronger weapons slightly harder to obtain, but nothing should be Godlike in a game with PVP.
---
Look I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre trolling or if you really believe this. Doesn‚Äôt matter to me. Hopefully the other players just put a little research into this.
---
15 steel (I think that‚Äôs right) weights 1.5
---
15 steel and 2 plastic bulked is 1.5
---
This is because the Plastic used literally vanishes. So to your specific example that you just linked there you go.
---
I don't destroy the camps unless they hide in it though, or it's shooting me. It's a waste of ammo and durability to me. I use a BE laser rifle so it tears up the bases, but also tears itself up just as fast lol
---
It's Insulting to your Players that you can fix a dupe glitch in a few hours but **minor** bugs linger for months!
---
OP literally said it in the title
---
Also, price gouging occurs when there is a scarcity of the item being sold and the seller retains the entire distribution network of that item to where there is little to no competition in selling said item. .45 rounds going for $5k a pop is not price gouging as the item is plentiful and anyone can sell them.
---
Same boat. I'll drop my junk somewhere near the pylon site and pick it up afterward.
---
I just try to use up my extras, turn my junk into ammo and such, but I'll never stop complaining about the stupid stash design of the game.  No reason my concrete should I want to rebuild my CAMP without a lot of material farming should be consuming my stash space.  Its just a dumb design decision.
---
The only major issue I‚Äôve had was the game crashes when entering the elevator. The suggested fix of loading in at a close location and walking there fixed this.
---
there's a spot in the toxic divide i found yesterday where the camp had both a junk AND lead extractor. that's pretty clutch
---
So you don't even know that bulking steel takes 30 steel, not 15. That link I shared is without pack rat 3. I'm saying it saves 1/3rd the weight bulking it in your stash if you run pack rat due to the bug in pack rat.
---
By close the launcher I mean terminate it completely. Kill it in the taskbar or task manager. Or shut down the computer.
---
I see it know. Sorry, was alittle hard seeing the new prompts with a 3 year old attacking me.
---
Yeah thats true. But also thats why i'm looking for a job at whitesprings... Maybe as a guard or something.
---
Ask people to join the leave half way?
---
ü§´ more like here is some credibility?
---
forgive //
---
Positive. I'm talking signs and letters, legit neon. Small letters are the little sticker looking ones.
---
I've said this many times before. Never attack a green glowing legendary before it has gained it's stars or it has passed some time.. 
---
I even got bashed by people in one other thread, even with video evidence. 
---
Like here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhhntq/psa_let_sheepsquatch_finish_spawning_in_to_get/
---
Some people just don't want you to have your rightful legendaries.
---
All month? I remember seeing that stuff in my previous two camps, so at least three months. It's even weirder when the graphics bug out and all the trees disappear; you can see little light pools all over the map.
---
I was lvl an alt using PA at a low lvl I to was thinking fusion core farming is going to be a bitch.. not so bad really with player vendoring usually buy any where for 50 nice low to 100 caps  for a fully charged 100  10 will last you well over a week of play 1000 caps maybe 1 day grind or a 1/2 so powering armor easier now for low lvls and honestly it would take me what 4 hours to get 10 cores I prob can farm a 1000 caps in that time without the hassle of getting ganked by a high lvl wanting to take over the power core production.
---
*blinks*
---
I don't get, what is it supposed to be?
---
I made a post about the backpack yesterday and learned that from a comment. They said it‚Äôs a guaranteed drop if you shut down the robots, but that was the only time I‚Äôve heard that mentioned so no idea if it‚Äôs true or not. I know I‚Äôve completed it after shutting them down and I have the backpack
---
Duct tape them to the wall with a snack :D
---
Not anymore, the second shot registers at 25% dmg.
---
Yes, which is what I do when I'm not playing the game. I don't let it run in the background because I don't like having useless programs running that aren't being used.
---
So instead I just use the INI tweak to allow me to play the game without even running the launcher at all and lets me put the game through steam.
---
Thank you for the advice.
---
I made like 14k atoms since launch so i would buy atoms just to support them, but it made ma angry, that they are doing impossible challenges for last two months. Fk of bethesda, get your shit together, then you may get moneys for food.
---
I think there's always a possibility that Bethesda will nerf it, but the "Unstoppable Monster" this month, which is essentially a Bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet, suggests they really do want it to be as the name suggests.
---
What I hope is that other builds get buffed to compete.  Particularly Berserker, because it's significantly more dangerous than Bloodied, but gives only a fraction of the benefits.
---
That‚Äôs the thing. Making a killing was killing me. Caps are a burden at this point. 
---
10-20 serums cost hours of farming rare mats and if I price them at less than 750, the first or second visitor will buy all or most of a 13 serum rack. 
---
Rare outfits are the same. If I list a hunters longcoat for less than 4000, then I have to hunt for the vendor bot every day
---
I wanted to have a shop of distinction. I dont just throw my garbage into my vendors. I found a balance that makes me happy.
---
Uh it has nothing to do with the disabled and more to do with how needlessly argumentative/ ‚Äòuppity‚Äô you are. You do yourself no favors when trying to prove a point that is already known to be correct. 
---
The Dude in Big Lebowski said it best: _**‚ÄùYou're not wrong Walter, you're just an asshole.‚Äù**_
---
need this!
---
Repair ten nuclear power plants? 
---
Shit, launching ten nukes might be faster.
---
If you want to RP a raider, RP a raider. But that isn‚Äôt the way to go. I personally feel that RPing a raider doesn‚Äôt entail blindly fighting someone for no reason or over a workshop - sure, you COULD do that, but with the state of PVP in this game, it‚Äôs just not worth your time. Better to hash out your own story in a discord server.
---
Not for the sake of this argument! /s
---
Seriously though, I routinely see legendaries marked up 100-1,000% just from hopping from vendor to vendor. 
---
This is subjective but from my experience, over the last week, I've seen 1/10 vendors with 2x-5x value increases and 9/10 with the aforementioned rates.
---
Being a griefer.
---
Yup, it's a daily routine for me now.
---
If I had to guess probably stuff like nuke mines or the fatman
---
so serious question, does she die or is she alive? or do we not know?
---
I'm fine with being an asshole. After being on this planet for over 4 decades I have learned that being nice gets you nowhere. While being an asshole gets shit done.
---
I don't like the long skirt
---
It is suppose to be coming after they complete the forum maintainance
---
That all makes perfect sense! Like I said before, I'm not trying to tell people what to do - I was just curious as to why I saw such a shift in market tactics. Thank you for sharing your perspective!
---
There's a place up north in the toxic valley where you can reach both a lead and junk extractor in the same camp, it's often occupied but extremely good for resources.
---
Theres bug fixes in literally every update
---
Trying that right now, probably that translation bug.
---
Any source for.them.taking it out of the game?  Pretty sure they only nerfed the effects.
---
Stop fucking hoarding everything.
---
I would be so down for a full camp repair. It drives me nuts
---
All challenges are too much specific. Bethesda seems to need more atom sales, but this will only lead to players anger.
---
Killable - yes. Easy to do so without similar legendaries - not really. I‚Äôm not here for an argument however, so I‚Äôll just take my leave now.
---
My build is similar but i only use Luck 10 so I can have Endurance 5. imo Grim Reaper‚Äôs sprint is useless because I can clear enemies more often before the perk kicks in.  Better crits for me is only useful in PvP and SBQ, but in PvP i generally don‚Äôt have the time or ability to bank a crit
---
and then use it before it expires. and for me, i can vats to a new enemy quicker than Gun Fu does by default.
---
IMHO. I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôll be around for at least the next 2-3 even 4 months. If the devs tweak the way it works. But even then I thing the meta is to set in stone for new stuff to bleed in. 
---
However. Being the strongest is what you make it. I‚Äôm a scout. So instigating is where my damage is. Bloodied doesn‚Äôt help if I‚Äôm swarmed and killed. 
---
So find what makes you feel OP.
---
And that‚Äôs totally fair man!
---
Personally I chase the coat outfits :D
---
Workshop resource gathering
---
Logging/tracking of what? buy/selling items from venders? So then what when they trade those items off onto an alt account? You go after accounts that have to much stuff? We saw how people handled that
---
I legitimately feel bad for your kids
---
I know that place. 
---
There‚Äôs a electric tower in the bog/mire that has a junk pile that sits under it and has a killer view of the bog. Not sure Where it is though.
---
This is why I wait till I have scrip to be claimed before I go to the vendor.  So the heads and wood armor can immediately be crushed for scrip.
---
I like to have a lead extractor and farm westek for gunpowder. I get most of my steel from whitesprings or other places with can strings. You could also take over the ammo workshop
---
The tapes in the silos imply that she was alive to see you launch it, so it's safe to assume that she's still kicking.
---
Up with you mate!
---
*You are suffering from parasites*
---
Well, I have a character that I got to 50 in the beta. But it‚Äôs really trash, as I didn‚Äôt really know what perks to get in the beta. It‚Äôs a scuffed VATS sniper that I was just gonna respec, but the respec system is so so so bad.
---
Like I said at the start, I‚Äôm not a PC gamer. I play Dota but that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve played in the past few years. So definitely not triggered, just really curious as to why you work so hard to constantly post the same stuff when it‚Äôs doing nothing except make you look like a obsessive weirdo with a hate boner for PCs.
---
Accuracy decrease, 25% increase in damage.
---
Lead: Lucky hole mine, by far best place.  acid: is at a lot of the work shops, especially in the upper part of the map. Steel: doing uranium fever or running west tek. Put on scrapper card and break down guns for like 20 steel each. You can kind of do other events to and pick up thing in between.
---
Unfortunately this would likely add to mass server migrations as players who spend a lot of time farming would just jump server to server farming spots for caps and legendary items and those who are just playing would be wondering why locations felt so empty and have trouble finding any legendary enemies.
---
Might not happen, but it very well might. Farmers would be going nuts jumping servers to get as many legendary items as they could to fill that double scrip...would make for some strange maps.
---
just find a way to exploit the bugs you want to be fixed....as soon as there's an exploit Bethesda rushes for a fix (like today) but everything else....can stay for months bugged like it is
---
I server hopped. No legendary. Talked to another player who only saw one.
---
I'd like to run this more consistently. Gt Mo0kish.
---
 Won't be on until late tonight, but am on most evenings. Lvl 195, and can solo this as well. 
---
Haven't been able to complete it yet after taking control of the experiment, because the formula Q makes the friendlies aggressive to the alpha, which melts them in 2-3 hits.
---
You shouldn't, as they are just like me. So they'd gladly tell you this as will I. No one in my family cares what you think, my kids are set up for life where they will never have to work a day in their lives unless they want to thanks to my "assholeishness" that allowed me to buy up enough rental property to clear 20k$ a month.
---
I think it‚Äôs called Lucky Hole Mine, there you can get a bunch of lead. For steel you should just go to a place with a lot of enemies, take their guns and then scrap them. You can make gunpowder at a chemist workbench.
---
There's a workshop that literally produces ammo, iirc.
---
I don't remember which things take 10, 15, and 30 weight. Not steel at least because I never bulk it. What you're saying about the bug may be true. But that's not at all what you first said. Never mind, just forget it.
---
I built a pretty godly nighttime sniper using nighttime perk cards and buffs. Just server hopped so I was always playing at night.
---
\------------------------------
---
NOT acceptable...
---
\-------------------------------
---
 per-order people are required preform the same task two times that you only had to do once.. This would be OK if it was a "title" or badge to show off.. but this is a currency item. Meaning un-fair trade. Rules surrounding anything that touches REAL $$ needs to be EQUALLY fair. What you just said is the equal of ... if your employer didn't pay you for over-time, it's OK because you could work more hours..
---
If I want that killer new power armor skin, I have to buy it if I don't have the EARNED atoms which you have. That's not fair. more so because I showed my support for Bethesda by handing over my cash before the product was released. Where is our return locality? Fallout 76 is an awesome game but I will NOT pre-order from them ever again for this.
---
Well crap good luck
---
That‚Äôs what I had in beta and launch. I F‚Äôd up the perks. Mainly because the full perk list wasn‚Äôt out. So I had to tough it for 2-3 weeks until the respec system came out. Luckily I only needed 10 perks to max it out. 
---
Honestly I‚Äôd hit up nukes and dragons and cement your build and see how much you really need to complete.
---
They are sold in the enclave bunker now, they were moved there when they removed the drops
---
 Nice!  I can dig it
---
I was like, what? Then I remembered alot of people play the PC port of this console game.
---
You might want to reread what I first said. I never said the exact weights except in response to what the other person posted. Which they checked without running pack rat.
---
Duping.
---
I can average 10-50 atoms per week depending on the challenges. Thats solo player.
---
Its free money essentially considering you need real money otherwise.
---
I mean, Bethesda could have just said no free atom challenges, pay if you want stuff, like many other games. 
---
Currently banked 1200.
---
You could stand to invest a little more into defense. Blocker and Fireproof will keep you alive when things go south. Things always go south. 
---
My biggest advice is to grab Mister Sandman and toss a silencer on your weapon. That 3.5x damage boost (3.75 if you bug it out) is incredible. I only use one rank of each weapon damage card and go full damage multipliers. It is beastly. My 72 damage auto combat rifle can deal up to 540 damage per shot (3.75x sneak + 2x head shot). That is pretty good considering the 7.5 rounds per second.
---
One issue I see is, you are using concentrated fire, which suggests a vats build, but you are using single shot rifles, which are a poor choice for vats weapons. Auto rifle receivers will give you -50% AP cost to you weapons. If you want to use a vats single shot weapon, I recommend a combat or radium rifle. They cost 26 AP per shot. A Handmade costs about 33. You can lower that slightly with a quick reload magazine and red dot sight, but you may have a difficult time. At 15 Agi, you can only get off about 8 rounds in Vats with a combat rifle, 6 with a handmade.
---
It's in the hunting store in whitesprings across from the black powder store. I believe there is a stuffed bear in the store, lots of trophies etc. The vendor usually sells common sporting clothes etc. and the plans for the bear skin rug.
---
Damn straight. I‚Äôd suggest [76Raiders](https://www.reddit.com/r/76Raiders/).
---
I want planters so bad
---
Me too, XB, and evenings. Maybe we can get a solid group together.
---
I can see a hard double scrip cap. Say 300 scrip over the normal amount. Once you reqch it your done no hoping or anything.
---
Couple reasons, duping caused an absurd amount of both mentioned items to be widely available. And nuking the right areas can allow absurd amounts of flux. There's a perk card that gives you more from plants you harvest in nuke zones.
---
I should also add flux isn't that hard to get when you have the green thumb perk on, it gives 2x plants when you collect, plus you get a few stable each time you kill the queen
---
Agreed. As I just posted. Making a hard boost that locks out after a set amount would be a good start.
---
It‚Äôs so hard to come across camps with more than 2 legendaries now because of the purveyor.
---
The recipes used to drop from the Queen every now and then.  If you kick the shit out of the Queen regularly, acquiring serum recipes and fluxes were obtainable.
---
It's not at Black Powder. It's at the Armor bot one lmao
---
Project Paradise does have something though - the plan for stimpack diffusers - which is required (for some God-forsaken reason) for the tadpole medic challenge. If you actually do those.
---
They still charge to change your username on XB1.
---
I had someone kill me through a fricken ceiling by air bursting one of those bad boys mid air. The explosion radium seemed huge, like spawned through the ceiling huge.
---
We've only been out for five hours Steve, WHAT THE FUCK?
---
This is even worse than some consumerist shopping urge.  PVP is supposed to be inherently dangerous.  You shouldn't get to know anything about your potential opponent. Choose wisely, you get rewarded. Choose poorly, you get wrecked. 
---
Don't like it, don't choose to attack another person's workshop.
---
Maybe if they didn't have to keep fixing exploits, they could move on to other things.
---
My favorite is the colossal WALL of rendering bug that sometimes appears in the distance. It's some gray texture stretched from horizon to horizon, miles tall.
---
I sold a good roll 3* Gatling laser for 5000 once, but I also think farming caps is pointless since after a degree they become useless. I don't know what people expect to do with 50,000+ caps in this game.
---
The amount of plans is from a pool of players. The amount of flux is acquired using the Green thumb, Mad Scientist and double bounty (the name of this particular part card escapes me at the moment) Perk Cards. We've known for some time that player vending was coming so it was just a matter of preparing oneself for it.
---
... Which... I shared... Has... roughly that... On steam... Which I also... shared... is unreliable... I'll spell this out for you clearer
---
There is absolutely no way to tell how many people are playing any game at any given time on Xbox, what we CAN see is a listing of the MOST played, without any data on current player amounts. Fallout 76 has. a. higher. position. then. extremely. successful. profitable and active multiplayer games. These games do *not* just 10k players on Xbox, they have ***Hundreds of thousands***. Fallout 76. Has. Higher. Numbers. Then. Them. Ergo. Fallout 76 has high enough player numbers to be successful, be profitable and have a healthy core player base, which is ***higher*** then 10k players.
---
Steam. Charts. Is. NOT. A. GOOD. METRIC. OF. PLAYER. NUMBERS. ACROSS. PLATFORMS. IT.
---
All of that is fucking POINTLESS because those numbers are ***CONCURRENT*** players anyway. Which is just people playing at any given time, which, I will say again is NOT credible, NOT reliable, NOT a good comparision and is something YOU brought up in the first place and ***I*** only brought in because you were *wrong*. I'm not using steam here, YOU are.
---
so in theory we could finally find her? (I haven't tried to work out the date of launch vs. the current date.) i.e. This isn't far-fetched to say the story is incomplete until we find her or her corpse.
---
thanks dude, and yes, agree. but still have hope, as there are also a lot that have empathy and being supportive. so yes, still hope^^ take care dude and thx for this ,)
---
Thanks mate!
---
&gt;just buff your rad resistance and spam the collect button on a river.
---
Or better yet, just have a decom shower set up in camp, then gather, boil, shower. Easy peasy üëçüòÇ
---
I see. Thanks for the advice. I‚Äôm level 30...would you mind dumbing down that auto/single shot rifle and AP cost explanation a bit? I‚Äôm not totally following since I‚Äôm fairly new.
---
Assign a unique identifier to each legendary item, and track the item's activity in game.  Dropped into a bag, put into a container, etc.  If an item gets duplicated, accounts directly associated to interactions right before/after the duplication gets perma banned.
---
Only accounts involved in the duplication activity will be impacted, but since this is just a game, such a system is likely cost prohibitive for Bethesda to implement.
---
I have maybe 40 serums for sale atm. I made a ton of money via PVP. I then spent my caps on recipes when I capped out. When doing more PVP, I would get tons of flux from hoarders. I made serums out of them to reduce the carry weight.
---
That's my story, anyway.
---
When you're obsessing over my profile and weirdly stalking me onto obscure threads, blatantly lying and desperately trying to drag me into a petty fight, then yeah i'd say you got triggered...
---
So do you think an entirely new character would be better? Or simply grinding to respec my 50? Idk which would be faster
---
Fastest way is to buy from other players
---
It's like they tried to balance power armor by making it shit for a vats build.
---
Power armor sucks balls I just need the extra carry weight from excavator to help me fast travel
---
I know this is a bit off topic but kinda relate able. I was out quading in the mountains in BC(British Columbia Canada)  and we stopped on a trail and saw a wild herd of wild horses about  200-300 yards from us and I have never seen anything more beautiful or breathtaking before or since kinda cool you had a virtual moment like that :)
---
My pleasure. There‚Äôs probably different reasons for the high prices. If it‚Äôs garbage, they‚Äôre probably doing it for yucks. If it‚Äôs something good, maybe the want it to go to someone who really wants it  
---
Not to some bargain hunter who‚Äôs just gonna mark it up in his machine.
---
Interesting about the Gun Fu. I may have to swap that if that‚Äôs the case. It‚Äôs not worth waiting a tad long for it to auto switch for the damage increase? Btw, I‚Äôm pve solely. Maybe PvP way down the line.
---
I wouldn't waste any on that cause I don't legendary farm. If they would increase the daily limit I might throw some over for the cause...lol. Be fun to find out. Good theory
---
I tried to sell the Propaganda Poster for 8000 caps. Well not tried really, but I enjoy having it in there hoping one day someone will buy it for no reason
---
So say i sell a duped item to you right after i duped it then in your theory you would get banned also?
---
Who is that guy on the right and why the fuck is he dressed up like indianapolis jones for?
---
It's less subjective than you think. A majority of combat engagements are balanced for solo players without a full set of Legendary items. Support for that claim can by be found in observation of how The Burrows launched, and how consistent that content is with everything that was in the game before it. The exception to that are some events (like Arktos) and Queen fights.  
---
Here's a subjective bit that I think most people would agree with: this game is fucking easy.
---
Tbh I‚Äôd just continue grinding. All that work and unlocking stuff is worth not re doing.
---
&gt;Steam. Charts. Is. NOT. A. GOOD. METRIC. OF. PLAYER. NUMBERS. ACROSS. PLATFORMS. IT.
---
Neither is your link which only looks at xbox, and even in your link it is being beat by fallout 4 which is a old single player game. LOL
---
For 6965 caps
---
I agree, but taking out the splash damage almost completely is still crappy. Make Explosives Great Again!!!
---
&gt;Been every time I launch it since a patch or two ago
---
Restart your launcher after it patches the game and you'll be back to synced
---
Owner spawn and others spawn seem to be seperate.  My spawn location for my camp is outside of my "build area" for my camp, but when other people fast travel there, they show up where i placed my camp the first time.
---
The only workshop you should take is hemlock holes for acid. Go to lucky Hole Mine for lead. Go to Hornwright site 3 for steel. Cloth I get naturally from Mr. Prize bot.
---
That's all you need to do. All other workshops are crap.
---
Assaultron heads are still broken anyway, you would have lost 1k fusion cells and never used it again.
---
I already have it, I didn't even want to pay 776, for it, but I new players would charge more of it, it's only super hard because every once in a while you will get a camp at the station which stops it from spawning their
---
Beads?
---
Fair enough. What do you think the best XP farm is? I‚Äôve barely played since BETA and I got all the way to 50 in BETA just by playing. So I genuinely have no idea how to grind xp
---
Damn I feel stupid. I was mis-informed.
---
lvling an alt is fun and you get so much better 2nd and third play thru
---
Sooo it's just like China duping USA goods and then selling them back to us. üòÅ
---
Get your hands on a bloodied sniper so you can level fast. I started respeccing like 2 weeks ago, level 65 or so. At 92 now and I'm pretty close to done. And I didn't learn the best xp methods till I was like lvl 80 or so, so there was a lot of wasted time.
---
... This most be what talking to an anti-vaccer on facebook is like
---
PvP players need the "best".  I don't PvP myself but getting better items sure is fun.  I remember the days in the early game when everyone had TSEs and clueless me had no idea duping was a thing and I could just buy one for cheap off someone else.  I just had a 1\* Medic's Handmade and some serious player envy!
---
No not everyone needs the "best" but it does greatly enhance the enjoyment of the game, even for more casual PvE players.
---
I frequently get "discotheque" rainbow squares all over the ground.
---
Boy I feel stupid. I was sadly misinformed. Thank you so much!!!!
---
That‚Äôs basically exactly what my understanding was.  But it literally never says ‚Äútame‚Äù. Half the time I just have two buttons for pacify
---
Yeah what's your gt
---
All month? I'm seeing that since B.E.T.A.
---
Next event? "The Gray Ooze"... eats everything. Boom. Everyone is CAMP-less, naked and unarmed. and their stash is gone.
---
I'm ALL for it.
---
Yeah it's worth it for growl lol, soon a i heard it i put it on my quick select
---
Don't scrap the weapons you pick up and you can max your daily caps really quick. You'll just be doing a slow walk back because they are heavy. Best thing is to do Uranium Fever since the train station is right there. Mole miner gauntlets for days. If you are doing all your selling in one shot, pop a grape mentats before. 
---
Some people make and sell outfits. It's tedious as they nerfed the amount of caps you get, but if you don't have a good usage for cloth, leather, bone, etc, it's a good way to get caps for that junk. Things like civil war hat, suit, and dress, skeleton costume, marine tactical helmet, etc. all are cheap to make and decent caps to sell to vendorbots.
---
Yikes
---
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs ideal but I do: Whitespring, event, west tec, event, Barrows, event, watoga, event. Repeat.
---
I‚Äôm standing right next to you lol
---
I‚Äôll try hunting some legendaries. What XP methods would you recommend?
---
Truth. I have to actively avoid the place or before I know it it's bedtime and I haven't done anything else.
---
I‚Äôll give it a try, thanks man :)
---
you got money for fake mustaches wheres my money------slap ---- slap---slap

---
If game companies would test their game longer and then put it out the exploits and bugs wouldnt become out of control issues
---
I sure hope its a bug. I bought the plans for these awhile ago hoping one day they'll be fixed. I typically use normal nuka nades and plasma and they seem to work fine, it's just the quantum
---
Np
---
Who made you police over what gets sold in the wasteland
---
I sell plans and clothes almost exclusively and I make a killing\~ Just because you think it's junk doesn't mean it's junk to someone else.
---
Nobody‚Äôs stalking you dude. But go ahead and keep dodging the question and acting like you‚Äôre more important than you really are.
---
Canibal perk.
---
ROFL, says the dude that thinks the microsoft webpage you shared is more reliable than steam just because you think it agrees with you. Keep whining kid, you can bleat on all you want, won't change the fact that this game is deader than fallout 4. LOL
---
My favorite Twitter response from a 76 post was "Stop wasting time on this game and get to work on Fallout 5."
---
Yup, random Twitter guy, sure thing.  We'll just throw away all this planning and development for you and your wants...
---
Bulk items scrapping!!!
---
NO... this is where we diverge. It's not about RNG. 
---
Fact is, the RNG is fine. God-tier weapons should be SUPER rare... that's what gives them value as "holy shit, check it out" items. It all gets fucked up when someone starts duping the stuff... because now... it becomes a "must have to remain competitive" item.
---
When 1 dude in 30 has it, it's a cool item that everyone wishes they had. When 1 dude in 30 is the only one without it? It becomes a "I'm at a massive disadvantage" situation.
---
Can't be. I left the game as I'm just taking a break for food :)
---
If your specced to unarmed with Unyielding it'll still 1 shot all the mobs including super mutants. Good substitute and it growls!
---
Ooooooorrrr you‚Äôre mad because you wasted your caps to hop to every player store on the server, expecting gear you wanted on demand.
---
Enjoy the journey, don‚Äôt curse it. Clearly good gear is scarce and they‚Äôre taking the first round for themselves.
---
Well that's just like, your opinion man...
---
Yup, I missed the last one and was pretty annoyed when I found out about it (actually I've missed everyone but idk how many there were)
---
I have started a new character that I've been enjoying and really got me back into the game (played this character for a while now) and have just reached level 30. I'm really in need of one of these events, I just want to get myself to level 50 :/
---
What system are you on? If you're on xbox I can make you a pimped out level 25 pump shotgun and a level 30 combat shotgun. I can also make you a level 30 BoS recon rifle if you want to try your hand at sniping.
---
Ack wrong person I guess...
---
yeah, not legitly. dev room items do not count
---
He said someone on Reddit had a pretty good guess on what we're already working on. I'm guessing he was talking about your post.
---
Why the hell do I have to set up twitter notifications just to get barely a warning the servers are going down? A six minute timer is bullshit, you can't finish anything in that time, and lose any Daily you had in the process.
---
Do you want communism? Because this is how you get communism.
---
I honestly can't believe they haven't fixed it yet, then again they are probably putting all their resources into the new battle royale mode they making and they want to make a big splash with it so it has to go off without a hitch. #ScrewPvpFixTheGame
---
Right you are.. Any one with enterprise level development experience is struggling and holding back from saying.. OMG that should be just one SQL script to fix this retro-issue and give the people credit for this or that.
---
A. They know where you been and discovered else it would be a "you discovered this ..." for every place you walk into every time!
---
B. They have all the awarded achievements and counts to say X of 76. They even tell us the names of the places we are "missing". (smacking head).
---
Now just do a Select \[IDs\] from A where not in (B) and you have all the items you cheated the Pre-order folks on! taa dah.. Here are your Atoms sir.
---
If that didn't work....
---
There is an audit trail because PCI compliance (laws for Credit card processing) demands it, on the money side.... I'm sure free Atoms get a record as a "free" transaction.... oh man.. 
---
I'm sure all the problems are just political and not abilities of the crews.
---
alas i have not yet unlocked them. please tell me how oh great one.
---
I saw someone selling a good tier baby rattle before for 25,000 caps, I wonder how much damage it will do
---
this seems to becoming an industry issue as well. i do really enjoy FO76 inspite of its shortcomings, but in the past few years pretty much every game i've pre-ordered has launched as a subpar product and i've had to wait for a period of time to feel like i've really gotten my monies worth out of it. Pre-Ordering as a whole is dead to me. even buying on launch day, i've been burned too many times. i'll be waiting like a month after release before i pick up any new titles
---
Is the Bomber Jacket still locked to tech data drops or can you find it out in the world?
---
Yeah you just happened to stumble upon this barely upvoted thread on a sub you've probably never visited before and completely ignored every other comment to post your desperate reply (completely unrelated to the thread btw) to me lol
---
Step 1) Go back and play when they still dropped from the queen. 
---
Step 2) Leverage the 4 extra Healing factor recipes you keep getting, to trade for 4 recipes you don't have.
---
Step 3) craft serums, and sell, to buy more recipes you don't have.
---
Step 4) make/sell more serums
---
Step 5) trade on the FB/Reddit/XB markets for more recipes you don't have.
---
Step 6) Find questionable sources for the final few recipes you haven't been able to find.
---
Step 7) profit!!!
---
Edit: Step 8) buy every stable flux you can find, or grind the queen/nuke zones for stable flux.
---
One mans garbage is another man persons good ungarbage
---
Didn't say you were stupid....
---
But you are acting like a dick.
---
Now we're talking.
---
Get some discords going.....
---
Get the PVP mechanics for Battle That Never Was in a play field like Arktos.....
---
Enclave vs BoS with adds in the form of Vertibirds, harnessed deathclaws, hacked liberators, miniature Liberty Prime....
---
Score points with adds kills or PVP.
---
If only.
---
Heh it worked!
---
I've only done it once, and technically won. I was down, and since nobody bothered to stim me I had to give up....right as it was killed. I got nothing and couldn't loot the corpse. I was one of the pylons the entire damn time too, and I'm not sure if we ever had a third pylon. Maybe briefly. It was awful. Fuck that event.
---
I can‚Äôt agree with you more. The bigger the code base, the more complex and harder it is to fix even ‚Äúminor bugs‚Äù. And software these days have massive code based.
---
Wait till the Appalachian Beaureau of Booze Chems and Guns catches up with you...
---
I bought a 2 shot Gatling gun for 500 caps before
---
That‚Äôs exactly what happened. I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre so paranoid.
---
Now I'm inspired to dump all that wood armor I get from the Purveyor into a shop.
---
Yes, so much of the basic game works way too well to say they have "no talent" It's one thing to bash them for... x but to not give credit for y just not right.
---
I really only pay attention to the workshops when they are part of the daily / weekly challenges.  I captured one the other day, set up extractors and built turrets while defending the place but then hopped servers like a dumbass and lost it all
---
The RNG and legendary grind exists in the game today because Bethesda knows that as much new content as they're able to release, people will eventually do it all and the grind is a means of extending the longevity of the game.  Duping is very damaging to the overall long term health of the game because it removes the need to grind for better gear.  Just dupe it!
---
Yeah. Just meant its likely coming if it was in there
---
I logged in the first time during the beta and have never had to re-enter my information??
---
Personally, when player vending started I picked the camps I went to by how many plans they had. Found some good stuff that way, but now I'm finding just because someone has 160 plans I probably have 158 already and the other two are like couches and tables. Now I usually look at armor and weapons and if there's a lot I'll fast travel to visit. I think the selection was real good the first week or two but has petered out now that people have sold off most of the things they were holding on to.
---
Yeah i really believe you lol
---
anyone pricing anything at 25k is doing it for show, not to sell seriously, but prolly wouldnt be mad if someone with more caps than sense bought em.  
---
cant display teddy bears or magazines around your house yet, but we have been told its coming. he is just getting an early jump allowing people to see his collection so far.
---
Any reason this wouldn't work on consoles?
---
Nope. Unpopular opinion, I am certain, but you're not meant to live in the stuff. PA should be insanely expensive to use.
---
&gt;Besides, do you get so pissed off when the guards in Skyrim mention someone stealing your sweet roll? Are Fallout references in Elder Scrolls OK? 
---
&gt;
---
Well, TIL. I know I that's from the intro to Fallout 3 but didn't realize the sweet roll comment was a reference.
---
Nice! Guess I was able to help after all!
---
Have you tried fireproof perk and/or dense/padded armor?
---
I have plans for like 9 serums right now.  All of which I bought from the Enclave bunker. I sell serums and other things to get enough caps to buy another recipe.  Then the process starts over. 
---
Getting the nuked flora itself is probably the hardest part because you have to get the flora and have the hardened mass,  high radiation fluid,  and glowing mass needed to transform it into stable flux. 
---
My general plan of attack is to nuke Whitesprings and farm it for a few hours.  The glowing ghouls drop the materials you need. 
---
Then I collect the nuked flora.
---
Whitesprings and the surrounding area has a ton of Fluorescent and Yellowcake flux.  Some cobalt and crimson,  but not as much. 
---
If you don't need fluorescent or yellowcake. Nuke Morgantown for Cobalt. And Fissure Prime for Cobalt and Violet. 
---
I use the green thumb perk card to get double flux. Then when I craft it, the Super Duper perk to get the chance to get double serums.
---
It's a grind.  But completely doable.  I only play about an hour each night during the week and a few hours each day on the weekend. 
---
I sell serums on PS4 for 300 caps each.  Easy money. Takes a few days to save up to buy another serum recipe though.
---
If it did work with alt chars.... I could see starting the max number of chars.. and doing the stupid simple tasks over and over.. and making tons of atoms.
---
Nuked whitesprings, nuked harpers ferry in the burrows, or both of those un nuked are good as well. West Tek Research is pretty simple and effective and you get tons of steel if you scrap all the weapons, or easy caps if you sell them to vendors.
---
With a high cap backpack, I have a 356 carry weight. And that's with a 13 STR (4 base).
---
Since fallout 4 is there an bug with the quantum Grenades....
---
They are and it's irritating when you wanna make sweet rolls. Wouldn't a sweet roll made with FRESH sugar bombs be a better idea than that box of irradiated and probably horrible effed up box of cereal you pulled out of the swamp
---
We used to nuke servers 10 times a day and killed armies of SBQ. We really did.
---
OG players probably bought duped recipes for 2K, but more likely newer players are easily and quickly hitting caps max plus vending - lots of cash to even buy directly at Enclave.
---
Flux is easy. Green Thumb + Good With Salt/Fridge Bag your way to victory. Lots of players sell stabilized flux in shops now, too. It's heavy and doesn't sell very well to vendors.
---
Noticed this last night.  Couldn't figure it out for several minutes why my core was draining super fast.  Basically ruins PA plus vats
---
Notice how multiple people are up voting me but down voting you? Because you're clearly not reading my messages before you type in response. I said ultracite is post-war it is simply made with pre-war materials yes ultracite is found in the scorched but the actual metal involved in the armor structure is pre-war.
---
At this point I'm literally just buying plans and recipes I don't have.
---
You are Groot.
---
That's the last thing they would ever do.  They don't want more items on servers
---
Sounds good to me, thank you.
---
I bet a lot ;) Jokes aside, if someone count on fact, that someone misclick and buy some crap accidenatlly then putting max cap price won't work, but 10000 is more probable :)
---
The only things I buy are 1* for under 100 caps to scrip, or camp plans to build a fancy house with.
---
I just use the dense mod on my chest armor, which pretty makes takes care of the need for fireproof.
---
That's a call Bethesda has to make.  The only clear bannable accounts would be the person that initiated the dupe, and the accounts that were first to interact with the duped items.  In a trade, its a 1-1 item interaction, so unless the trade itself is part of the identified exploit, it wouldn't fit into the pattern match they would use to identify which accounts were directly involved in duping activity.
---
I suggest dealing with the dupers themselves, penalizing buyers of their wares whether knowing or unknowing is a harder call to make.
---
How does that duping work anyway? How do they do it?
---
My Junkies shotgun does better than the TSE with rank five demo expert vs five addictions.
---
when I tested Gun Fu it was like ‚Äúdeath‚Äù was not established until the loot populated vs. energy was 0. also, i‚Äôm unsure how the game determines the next enemy, ie. Gun Fu would seem to only go to the next enemy laterally on one plane only, as opposed to selecting the closest enemy. in my case, selecting the closest enemy was most desirable but it rarely worked out that way.
---
Every weapon has its own base AP cost. Some rifles and pistol have the ability to change the fire mode from semi automatic to fully automatic. A fully automatic receiver applies -50% AP cost to the weapon at the expense of 10% damage. A combat rifle, for example, costs 26 AP per semi auto shot. With an automatic receiver instead, it costs only 13 AP per shot. So effectiveness in Vats doubles.
---
Some other attachments also reduce or increase AP costs without changing fire mode. Scopes typically increase AP costs while sights typically reduce them. Anti-armor magazines typically increase AP costs while quick reload magazines can reduce them. 
---
So, if you want to make a semi auto vats build work, you should use a weapon with low base costs, like the combat or radium rifles, and attach a quick reload magazine and red dot sight instead. I have seen reports that a red dot sight is a 15% reduction in AP costs. So your shots may only cost 22 AP instead of 26. 
---
Weapons like the handmade or hunting rifles cost AP well in their 30s for vats shots.
---
Thanks! Ill give this a try
---
I see people with crap in their vendor, sometimes purely non legendary with no plans outfits or even meds just lvl 10 ten mil pistol and ya like you say they're over 100.
---
 Do I blame them? Of course not, RNGesus is not fair to us all or it's name wouldn't be RNGesus.
---
 I also got a bloody explosive off a level 100 vendor so there's a good bit of variety
---
Here's what i would change and I've been running a sniper build from day one (level 106)
---

---
Biggest thing is getting level 2 Bandolier 90% reduction in ammo is HUGE I'm carrying around 4000+ rounds EACH for my .50 cal, .45 cal lever action, and combat shotgun and all told it MIGHT take up a pound of my carry weight. With my  chameleon armor piece, marsupial mutation I can find my way up to good shooting positions and have enough ammo to meticulously take out just about anything.
---
Next I'd sacrifice one star each from Rifleman (dont trade in a whole card 3 with 2 stars gives you 45% 2 cards with 3 stars only 40%) put those three stars into long shot for more range and accuracy
---
I'd have Weapon Artisan and scrapper to swap out when you craft they don't have to stay equipped when you are out in the field but 200% weapon condition is very nice.
---
Finally Professional Drinker is imho worth the 3 points because booze is freaking everywhere in this game and with this perk i down them bad boys like they were purified water and never have to worry about addiction.
---
I play exclusively solo so i have nothing in charisma
---
Im.down to run it any time people are on. We tried once before with a group and it keeps crashing so I do have others to add as well
---
You‚Äôre very easy to spot, not sure why that‚Äôs hard to believe.
---
Good luck!
---
Oo, I totally forgot about that, thanks

There‚Äôs a box of irradiated bombs in the maintenance/laundry shack at whitesprings.

Sunshine Oil is absolutely awesome!
---
You should explore them and receive the wonderous surprises each one holds.
---
Pick up all toys, pencils, etc for lead.
---
Pick up and scrap as many weapons as you can for steel and plastic.
---
Kill super mutants for gunpowder.
---
Do all 3 at WestTek or Grafton Steel.
---
A lead or steel (iron) node at your CAMP is great and the mines aren't bad, but you're going to need to go hunt down Yao Gaui and Snallygasters. Both are easy. Dolly Sods and Toxic Larry. You can also get Snallygasters to spawn as part of Census Violence. Yao Gaui are sometimes in herds at the flooded rail yard.
---
"Embaressing yourself" üòÇ

While there are a few unique rewards for PP that I really want, it really hurts to recieve a horrible reward 95% of the time. You spend 30 minutes running around clearing high level enemies, collecting food, protecting a creature, and killing a special level 100 boss. You are then blessed with 1x orange mentat, 2x purified water, and 10x .45 ammo as a reward.
---
Nope people dont buy em and thats ok just like when Im hunting for say a serum am I going to buy 1 for 1000 nope I know I can get one for 400 or maybe 250 for some other guy.  you look at some of these guys vendor prices and they don't get it and thats ok because someone else will get the business
---
But it sucks. It wasn't great before but now it's just nerfed to uselessness.
---
Hear, hear. I'm so tired of armchair developers accusing entire companies that they know nothing about of "laziness or unwillingness to fix" bugs. The idea that game companies are like malicious drug dealers who intentionally mess with their clients has to end. They are businesses that are in the business of game development. Saying they are intentionally pissing off their client base is the dumbest fucking assessment you could possibly have. And all these people who think their childish gripes represent the majority of the community and people should be "outraged" are so entitled and so far up their own asses it's astounding.
---
Ghoul Slayer is a prefix, it only shows up in the first legendary slot, the same one as anti armor, bloodied, two shot. The third slot is always something like +1 special or weightless.
---
This happened to me and the Camp Owner just watched. I ain't going to shop where I don't have protection. Luckily I had my PA in my inventory for some reason and killed him twice until he scampered off
---
I guess not.
---
We're planning to post a new Inside the Vault tomorrow! Stay tuned.
---
I'd be more sympathetic to the people defending Bethesda if it wasn't so many months after launch.
---
The fact is they've added new content while ignoring bugs. Hard to defend that.

You have to fully ferment 10 alcoholic drinks in the fermenter.

To be fair, it's probably what makes the rolls so tasty. I wouldn't want to waste my fresh cereal in hopes it would taste better - knowing my luck I'll ruin some perfectly fine Sugar Bombs.

PS4 btw. Geez. Really?

Maintainance ended 30 minutes ago so I guess not today.

I have a character started from L1 on survival only. It is pretty dead on PC, there have been times when there was only one server, and it wasn‚Äôt full. Sometimes you will get a server full of people just doing their own thing, sometimes a handful of high levels hunting others.

It can do real damage, I don't think there's a higher DPS melee weapon. The rocket/splash sound gets annoying fast, though, so I switched to a Bloodied / SS / WR Grognak's, and I'm a much happier skullsplitter now. ;-)

*fixed an exploit where explosive weapons were actually doing explosive damage as they should, this was unintended, as was the two shot prefix doing two shots worth of damage. Further to balance this issue, we have adjusted ammo dump mobs (sb,sbq,ss) to have a 150% additional health bonus*

I think more PVP is a good thing, the game gets pretty boring with PVE. Like talk about immersion killing when someone takes your loot in an event after you die, and there's nothing you can do for revenge
---
I‚Äôm accumulating all the recipes now. It‚Äôs the only thing I spend caps on and I can usually get about 2 a week. As far as flux goes, I‚Äôll make a run through whitesprings to accumulate all the mass and fluids and then craft stable in mass quantities.  Since I only use flux to make serums, I am accumulating this in bulk... I‚Äôll sell them in my machine for 600. 
---
Tl:dr farm flux, sell serums, buy recipes. Super super for crazy quantities on all
---
Awesome! Were you able to tame by aiming your gun, or did you have to run right up next to it?
---
I just waited till the next time my team did a nuke raid, they *never* bring more than a couple stimpacks. Meanwhile, loot goblin that I am, I‚Äôm running around with more than 40 all the time
---
Interesting. Alright, maybe I‚Äôll put that point elsewhere on Luck. I‚Äôm scared about moving points away from the SPECIAL slots bc of how dumb the respec is at 50
---
there is a guy on YT that almost exclusively reviews bloodied builds.
---
Yeah, buildable area is a sphere
---
I bought several crappy 3* armor pieces last night for 100 caps each, I needed to spend some caps, and that's Cheap food for the legendary Muncher (4 caps per Scrip)
---
Thanks for the trick! Now I'm done building next to rivers I guess :p
---
Doesn't look like we're getting one today. Gotta wait for E3 I guess.
---
I refer to this as F76 on LSD
---
The alcohol recipies can be frustrating to get which is why people will buy those. I just got Mountain Honey and still don't have Nuka Dark after doing the quest 2x daily, since release. :/
---
I would love that. I'm in the mood to grind!
---
Sun Kissed 1 is all you need in this game!
---
Nice, thanks for the advice.
---
Hey, thank you for the response, that's really thoughtful of you, and I may not be able to relate entirely but it gives me hope, so thanks all the same. I'm on the road to recovery now but I just started about a month ago and dear Lord is it a long one.
---
OK, that makes sense. Thanks for taking the time to explain it to me. Much appreciated. 
---
What armor should I be wearing for this build at level 35-50? There are plenty of posts I‚Äôve favorited for 50+ legendaries when I get there, but not much for leveling.
---
I prefer selling to the people that actually buy stuff when they stop.  Not somebody looking for the best legendaries only. Sorry bud.
---
You are a discrase to the free states you communist !
---
Lazy cunts should have this option there instead of us having to modify .ini files.
---
Clear to who exactly? I assume they have to deal with the triple constraint problem like everyone else and therefore cannot solve every ‚Äúgame-breaking‚Äù bug at the same time.
---
I'm over 100 and I don't think it's embarrassing to put lower quality items in vending. I keep the good stuff to use. What's really embarrassing is selling so many high end weapons or gear through vending to the point of losing caps because you are maxed when someone makes that purchase :/
---
The only other one that I know is blackwater mine has lots of uranium
---
For Pete's sake or for Hines' sake?
---
I have noticed it occurring more frequently recently along with the loading into the game and being able to move and fight before the checkpoint completes and camp buildings are spawned.  No idea if they are related.
---
yeah nothing more weird and scary looking like going to hit max caps oh well guess time to buy some ammo---- becoming a merchant could become a full time job I sorta love hate the cap maxs thing.. if we didnt have it could you imagine the inflation? and I think it would stop people from buying consumables ...... on the other hand isnt a caps max sorta like form of communism? Could you imagine a money max is the USA people would lose their shit--
---
Kinda overdid it since it's shit for just about everything else without legendary affixes.
---
Nope tested right now. Didn't count for me.

Thats because they are actually features üòÇüòÇ

One man's trash is another man's treasure.

Yup I was always doing the daily challenges. But since the Camara comes out it s*cks really. I play most of the time alone and don't really get atoms anymore.

Excellent :D

If you have specific junk in mind, it could be more efficient to go to locations with lots of screws/gears etc.
---
Had the same thing happen to an Instigating one last week, then got 2 pieces of 3\* Wood armor last night.
---
From now on I won't buy Armor from the Purveyor unless there is scrip left for me to cash in the 3\* wood garbage immediately.
---
The one near the Overseers initial camp has coal.  Other have various things and minerals, some have multiple kinds of minerals.
---
I'll give you 50 caps and the plans for the chemistry bench.
---
Thx a lot to you two :)
---
No, I don't see any downvotes, mine are sitting at 1, and yours is sitting at 2. Also, I don't give a damn about upvotes or anything of the sort.
---
The ultracite power armor was designed post war and was made by metal that was forged post war in the enclave bunker. Go look in the bunker at the "production" area, it literally has a metal foundry to melt and create the ultracite alloy in the bunker. So no it isn't made prewar, it is actively being made post war, if you read the terminals in the bunker you can follow the lore where they designed it and then found out about ultracite POST WAR and then started trying to collect it to create the ultracite power armor.
---
In real life there‚Äôs always a place to spend your money. In our little vault experiment we‚Äôre stuck.

Came here for this comment. Wasn't disapointed.

Thank you sir it's been driving me mad. :)

Clear to anyone with an IQ above room temperature. If they can squash a "game breaking" bug overnight, the OP is right that it's a little insulting that other bugs, which actually break the game, have persisted for months without even an acknowledgement from a CM, never mind a fix.
---
Ive been selling a ton of garbage legendaries cheap, and people buy them to exchange for scrip. Everyone has their reasons for selling what they do, just because you arent privy doesnt mean its trash.
---
Don't worry but thx for the laugh. I tought the same first.
---
Mine seems to drain at what I‚Äôve deemed an acceptable rate when I equip Power User. It is quick, but it seems like there should be some balance to using it. I rounded up like 50 cores a few weekends ago by taking Poseidon &amp; Monongah for a few hours. I was never attacked or contested either which surprised me!
---
Wish there was a super duper Mart that I could farm for it at
---
Compete the tadpole quests to become possum scout. First read a scout poster at a train station
---
Why would you not want to hear the whines from your victims.. weak.
---
I think one thing adding to this is that exploits complaints get upvoted on Reddit 10x more then bugs. People link exploits to cause of every other glitch in the game. 
---
When people report bugs on Reddit, the bug reports seem to get overly  down voted even when they are perfectly valid and easily recreatable. A good example is for some odd reason the foreign language  translation bug threads have been being down voted, even though its obviously broken.
---
Ugh. There is really no need to share this information. You know what will happen.
---
Some bugs are very very hard to fix. Gotta downvote these hate posts. They don't really contribute to anything. They have literally fixed hundreds of bugs. Still a ways to go but the game is incredibly improved. 
---
That said, they still have a long way to go.
---
Before i reinstalled I removed every folder and .ini for 76 but just did it again and still no change :(

Nobody asked.

Looking to protect yourself? Or deal some damage?
---
I'm right there with ya. Game has been at a pretty stable 60 fps until the last three or so patches. White springs in the worst, goes down to 30fps for me. Just been avoiding WS since I'm not about to lower my settings from Ultra when it use to run just fine before.
---
If they don't want to sell why they put it in the machine? It's doesn't have separate weight, so there is no benefits doing this?!?

The legendary vendor only adds to the grind and frustration of this game.  Don't get me wrong, I love playing it but the legendary vendor addition does not represent more value to me as a consumer.  It just adds to my hatred for RNG.  If the offerings she gave us were designed to fit with our current build...that would have been smart.  If she were able to offer us legendary effects that we can craft to our favorite items....that would have been smart and holy smokes people would have gone crazy for that...but...I think Bethesda took the path of least resistance and gave us an RNG that forces us to farm even more legendaries than before.  I quite frankly, hate the legendary vendor.  If I get one more stupid hunters gamma gun I'm going to puke.
---
They don't care, they just laughed when I told them some random was whining on the internet about me being mean. They literally laughed and said you must be a "female dog" in less words. LOL
---
I would like this too, I feel like I‚Äôm false advertising! I have mostly interesting clothing pieces and a few pieces of armor. It would be great to have to broken out like Stims vs. Meds is.
---
It would prevent burn out cause you could have multiple Alts..... that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm not burnt out two toons, but I want another but that grind sucks and to respec even worse!
---
You can make a build around staying in PA all the time, I just don't use VATS on that character. 
---
If you run batteries included and power user you can be in PA at all times, I can carry like 30 cores at once with barely any weight penalty. 
---
But I agree, there's a reason why the chassis is portable, only use it when necessary (unless your build revolves around it). On my newest character, I'm doing a full non-PA run, have my hazmat suit ready.
---
One of the best items in the game. That's the kind of item that you'd need to trade other items for in order to get full value out of it. 
---
If you've ever wanted to get into heavy weapons, that's worth changing your build for.
---
Grats on the great drop!

Same, I was running high for a very long time at a stable 40-60 but now i'm down to low since the last few updates, I hope now that Wild Appalachia has ended they'll take the time to start majorly addressing places like whitesprings, Charleston etc. As well as do some much needed optimising and stutter fixes.
---
Sorry didn't realise I was dealing with a 5000 IQ.
---
Search for "Vault" and sort by New.  The question's been answered by Bethesda already :-)
---
once u have some tight weapons and can wyickly grind a place like West Tek, you may feel more

confident reassigning special points because if you dont like the change you can earn xp and revert within a couple hours. i used to have reason for pause but eventually i enjoyed the disadvantage I felt when i moved a point that did not benefit me.

I'm pretty sure I found a death claw hide in the Asylum last night. Naturally, I didn't write anything down so I have no idea exactly WHERE in the Asylum.

I'd be cool with a paid tier that rewards a monthly stipend of atoms if it meant better stability and support -- similar to the model ESO uses.

Yes, but it's on its own 20 hour timer.

That's embarrassing.

I'm over lvl 100 and constantly sell costumes only and make about 10k every few days from that alone.

Let people sell what they want. If you don't want it move on. You spent 30 caps fast travel there so it's not a big deal.

I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted. Basically every online game that has time gated vendors has them on a global 24 hour reset, which makes a fuckload more sense than a personalized 20 hour reset. 
---
They just need to have it update every day at 10am EST or whenever the daily challenges reset and make it simpler for everyone.

---
Bethesda is located in Rockville, Maryland. Staff comes in to work, finalizes any proposed changes, compiles the executable, checks for errors, recompiles if necessary. Rollout is 11am, so they have 3 hours to get to this point.
---
Then they upload the new data to the servers, resets everything, and hopes everything boots correctly. If anyhting fails, they roll it back and try agian. If it continues to fail, they can roll back to pre-patch and let everyone back on while they work on it more.
---
If servers do update, then they roll out the updates to Xbox and PSN. Again, they may require multiple attempts to succeed.
---
And then everyone is allowed back on - usually 4 hours or so after the update starts. Puts them around 3 - 4pm local time so all the staff have an hour or so to answer emails, put in their time, and head home.
---
TL:DR - would be very foolish to update production servers without support staff on-hand for any issues.
---
Thanks! I don‚Äôt usually use a mic either.
---
Lucky Hole has a Cthulhian monstrosity. :D
---
I know you *can*‚Ä¶ I just *feel* that it's out of canon and ridiculous, personally. That's all.
---
I 100% DO NOT like the approach Bethesda has taken re: Power Armour, since they took over the franchise. 3 and NV weren't *terrible* about it, but 4 just got ridiculous with it, and no 76... it's just too much.
---
edit: this isn't a rip on anyone that wears it... It's a game mechanic, and it's foolish NOT to use it. It's merely a personal opinion about the way it's been handled by Bethesda. I feel like it was put in as an ill-thought out "Wouldn't it be super kewl idea if you could play the while game in power armour"  brainstorm session and they just ran with it, turning what COULD have been a fun, rare occurrence into a mundane "must have" game mechanic that loses everything about it that is interesting.
---
Oh, while it said I could spawn at vault 76, it wouldn't actually allow me.
---
Also check my update post.
---
Just an FYI, you don't have to stay at the water park. He's static, so as long as you don't server hop people can find him by joining your server.
---
I waited for around 5 minutes on some and no loot ever appeared on the body. Usually if a legendary was missing loot it would appear in 30 seconds or something but this was different
---
I got that one and an antiarmor explosive gatling gun back to back from the purveyor and a guy offered me 30k for the bloodied one but I won't sell it. It's very good.
---
OP doesn't understand basic economics.
---
And extremely true.
---
Yup, lots of protein and saturated fats. ;-) Stopping now because that's enough offtopic chit-chat.
---
I don't save up. If I have 100 I go gamble a weapon.

---
You dont need wasteland whispere, only animal friend.
---
And the pet doesnt take camp budget at all.
---
They definitely still charge you.
---
I gave up buying 2 &amp; 3* items because the legendary effects aren't that great. I buy 1* cheeper and getting stuff I actually want.
---
It's not that weird. It's just Bethesda. Also how they can keep adding stuff to the Atom Shop without a problem. But actually fixing the game, doesn't happen.
---
Not to mention, the backwoodsman which gives you a 50 percent chance to double yield from plants. Top that off with some super duper and you are rolling in flux.  I have friends that have no use for hardened/glowing/fluids that are also nice enough to collect flux with me so it's not uncommon to have 400-600 raw or more to process after a run. 
---
When they need something that requires flux they can just come to me.
---
It seems like a lot of people have a hard time recognizing good armor when they see it. I've experienced the same thing.
---
Are you on PC? What are you trying to sell?
---
I could be wrong but weren't the double XP weekends when they didn't have any content available or they kept pushing the content back.
---
So, I think this would be solved with a couple simple things:
---
* Display the level of the person who owns the CAMP when you highlight the CAMP.  I shouldn't have to hunt all around the map to find their blip to get this information.  Unless it's a mule, it's unlikely that a &lt; Lv. 80 would have anything I want, and the inverse is true for low-levels perusing my wares. 
---
* Separate Armor from Clothing.  If Stimpacks can be their own category, I don't know why Clothing can't.
---
I got a 2** bloodied explosive combat shotty my first go around(when I used all 1000 at once) but really nothing since. A couple unyielding here and there. But Ive also thought to start only getting 3 stars from the Purveyor because you can go to the unnuked whitesprings and pull two 2**s and probably 4 or 5 single star pieces at a time. I guess im just complaining about having to save and not play the Purveyor Lotto every single day üòÇ
---
&gt;Lots of tiny issues can be fixed in a day, especially items left in a test mode or simple database entries.
---
You don't really give off the impression that you work with program code or databases on a regular basis.
---
There's always been animals missing from the series as a whole (or at least the latest entries)
---
Birds. Radiation has done nothing to birds? Well I guess maybe wiped them out. 
---
Fish? We finally got something such as anglers but they spend more time in land. Yeah the waters of the commonwealth were woefully shallow but nothing? Well nothing alive since there were all those creepy looking dead dolphins. (Yeah I know some mods put in live ones)
---
Hmmm. Youre not wrong. Ive gotten more bloodies from 2 star rolls!
---
I sell magazines, I had a level 255 stop by and buy 12 of them last night.
---
I don't really see a need for changing the daily Cap limits on the vendors, but when it comes to Scrip I don't understand why there is a limit at all.
---
If there were no limit on Scrip then players would empty the massive inventories of their mule characters, which would in turn help stabilize the servers, right?
---
there‚Äôs a good vid on YT to farm sugar bombs. once u get a good run for Blight it becomes a bit easier to make
---
Gun.
---
Really pretty safe spot south of point pleasant. Follow the river on the eastern bank until you see the junk pile.
---
I hear the frustrating part.  The gf is stuck on a whiskey crit shot challenge that literally wont complete and there is no option to drop the quest.  
---
But people will buy the generic "beer" recipe even.  I honestly think they just dont want to do events period which is fine by me.  I actually like hunting down mats, brewing the alcohol, and doing the event.  Plus I make at least 5 drinks in case the challenge is being difficult and the extras go in my machine.  They sell very fast at 5 to 10 caps depending on the brew.
---
That makes sense. I‚Äôm afk, but good for future reference.
---
I think you had one too many, Biv.
---
I am good but ty for ur help :)
---
I collect up to around ~300 scrip, then roll for 3* armors. Since I'm looking for something specific I tend to burn everything else.
---
Well, this is the team that fixed the Lever Action Rifle reload, so I wouldn't put it past them if enough players complain about it.
---
So the question is: full auto or semi auto? I have perks for both builds.
---
They aren't raiders.
---
Got a quad ammo double shotgun with 40% bash damage level 50 never got any better. But I love it.
---
Location?
---
I actually did LOL.
---
exploding... meh :(
---
I'm camped right next to the Miner's Monument, so the first thing I do when I log in is walk over and see if he's there, and then post on reddit if I find him. I managed to stay on the same server for 4+ hours last weekend, and dozens of people came by to grab a camera and shop at my store. It was awesome.
---
I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again and I‚Äôll keep saying it. Bethesda needs to patch out the exploit methods and once that‚Äôs done they need to do a full wipe.  
---
Also, it looks they need to just make it so when you sell an item to a NPC vendor it just disappears from the game.
---
Low lvl nub here. Thx for thinking about us! Ill buy that shit all day haha.
---
Found all of mine in junk piles and at pricketts fort in containers. Try those.  Seemed like pricketts fort almost always had one.
---
Oh man i'm sorry for my utterly dreadful goods i'm selling and that they havn't a single ‚≠ê.
---
Really, really sorry for all the precious time i and others cost you with our goods. Really, deeply sorry. So sorry.
---
Man, i mean after all it's hard losing a such nice, gentle and modest customer.  I'm out of words about that...wait - did you hear that??
---
 *kaching* *kaching* *kaching*
---
No, they don't.  X-01 isn't even good.  Jetpacks aren't either.  You need to get attacked by better people lol
---
This explains so much! I used to never have problems with power in my armor and just last weekend I ran out of cores. I never thought much about them because I always had enough. I also never used to use VATS. Thanks for explaining this!
---
Thanks! Are you in one?
---
Id be a lot happier if the Vendor icon on the map said how many 1,2,3 star items are available
---
Um.. are you not using the Bethesda launcher ? I've never had to log in besides the 1st time.
---
I‚Äôm in both. I play on Xbox.
---
I don't have one yet but I already have the excavator set which bumps me up to 350, so I just keep using the PA since I only need it to fast travel.
---
That would make sense.
---
You seem to think I care if you believe me, my girls love laughing at whiny people, let me guess you were a clinton supporter huh? ROFL
---
Cheers of level 188!
---
Truth. I've made way more on costumes than I've made on legendaries.
---
Some vendors have it
---
I'm pretty sure the Enclave always had them.  There was just a period when the SBQ did as well, which accounts for some number of plans.  Duping accounts for the rest.
---
I pretty much only sell aid items (nuka cola, magazines, bobbles), clothes, and plans in my camp and I sell them really cheap.
---
The idea is for those players who have perhaps not come across an item, or just didn't know it's out there to find something neat and be able to pick it up without searching the map or spending an arm and a leg.
---
Just because you have no joy and can't see the fun in jumping around different vendors looking for something unique, don't say it's bad for everyone else. 
---
If it makes you feel better I could happily put a wildly overpriced legendary item in there for you to look at and complain about the price of.
---
I was there today and I got about a dozen legendaries at least. Sometimes I go and get none though.
---
‚Äúruin the game‚Äù 
---
Yeah okay :)
---
Life isn't fair. This game isn't fair. Low levels and Leaf-Eater builds shouldn't have an easy time against homicidal video game maniacs that set everything up to murder their fellow vault-dweller at the expense of comfort cards. 
---
No one is making you PvP.
---
Prime it as the gun fires so slow and is incredibly ammo efficient.  Heavy guns don‚Äôt have hardened receivers so the gun damage for the Gatling goes up substantially after priming it, with even more bonus damage to scorch.  Having a BE Gatling, Nerd Rage up and AR serum, you one shot super muties in WT.  you can get through 2 or 3 WT without reloading, making it an ammo positive run.  Long story short, it‚Äôs my favorite heavy gun and I have a BE Version of all of them.
---
Godsmack: the tribal tattoo you can listen to.
---
I play with no music so I can hear all the bird song in the forests, just we never see any.
---
Snakes would be awesome but I can imagine how complex the animation would be.
---
If you want a good build hmu just specify what weapon you want to specialise in, wether your in or out of PA etc
---
I am in no hurry to level my character...double XP makes me level faster...I just wanna play at regular speed.
---
Same here.
---
Very nice, My lv25 got on here first ever roll a extra dmg against ghouls, explosive and + 1 perception lv25 handmade.
---
That has now protected her up to lv37 and she was in here first SBQ fight with it at lv27 and got a nice little decom. shower  :)
---
Have you tried selling to a vendor?
---
I got plans for you for days bby~ Welcome over anytime!
---
Have you tried selling them to a vendor?
---
I love ppl who sell 1 star low lvl stuff. I dont want to wait till 50 to buy a fun weapon. Honestly the mid game can be rough and a good Legendary modifier can be the ticket! I put up a lvl20 instigate rocket launcher for 150 caps. 10 rockets for 1 cap a piece for the new explosive player who wants to take it for a spin! I hope i can find something like that for my pistol guy ‚ò∫
---
I'd pay actual money if there was more available. I really wanted the camo skin for the hunting rifle, but I refuse to buy atoms just for "flash sales", since it's all made up value anyway. If everything was in the shop I would definitely spend some money, since I could pick and choose a few items at a time to fully outfit my toon.
---
Can‚Äôt remember the last time I got a 3* drop from an enemy.
---
There should be a note when you hover over someone's camp that shows how many legendary items are in the armor or weapons category. Ive traveled to high level camps and they have all non legendaries. Which is fine but id rather save my caps if i knew there were none.
---
&gt;You seem to think I care if you believe me, my girls love laughing at whiny people, let me guess you were a clinton supporter huh? ROFL
---
You're the one writing paragraphs about shit that didn't happen. Please get some help.
---
My camp is on a lake south of vault 76 just before you get to the road that leads to the overseers camp.  I think I have 7 hives in a clump on the south shore.  Love stopping off at the teapot on my way down to Camden park to get a quick dose of xp and loot.  Robot usually wants 10 honey every day.
---
If you go to the farms just north of Janet's ice cream shop there is a farm with a junk collector next to an old barn.  On that barn is a clump of 5 or 6 hives.  This is the one I would suggest and may be moving to.  My current camp site is popular depending on the time of day it seems and I sometimes have to server hop 3 or 4 times to place my camp.
---
Try bashing them with it. Lmk if it works
---
Yeah... bash damage or nothing
---
Ohhhhh. Meh, it's always just me and doggo.
---
Awesome, thanks for putting this in!  I knew it was level locked, just wasn't sure of the exact details.
---
Yep.. tried different barrels just incase and made no difference..
---
AND THEN Bethesda decides to get rid of recipe drops and raise the vending bot value of serums, thus creating a limited market for serums and trippling the value of serums in trading overnight.
---
It was just west of the place you found the deer.
---
Ill check the spot out thank you
---
No he's just mad because too lazy grind and work for the gear himself.
---
And a tiny bit salty that no one sells their god tier stuff to this lord and savior himself.
---
Pathetic.
---
How about double XP Event Wednesdays, or like killing enemies with your fists is triple XP for the weekend, I'll take anything at this point just for some excitement. Double XP was amazing.
---
Do Uranium Fever, loot EVERYTHING, sell at Whitespring Station.  Usually clears out the full 1400 unless you get minimal spawns.
---
I should have said "all but 1" haha
---
Enjoy!
---
Why the fuck do we need to have to do this and it's not standard in the launcher?
---
Thank you so much for this by the way
---
I only get gamma guns and wood armor for 3* :(
---
One of the worst reactions from stealing a workshop. The kid cursed me out incessantly. I don't care if it's a low level or whatever. Since the updates I just go and steal workshops if I notice people are there. 
---

Seeing how probably 99.9% of Reddit has no clue what happened to you....what happened?
---
That exploding isn't to be trifled.
---
I use a 5.56 ammo normal handmade on the SBQ and don't even see the damage I do.
---
I use a same leveled, exploding and faster reload handmade on the sbq and can watch my damage melt her health away.
---
I'll take exploding over bash damage.
---
(If this was sarcastic I did not pick up on it, lol)
---
&gt;  but more likely newer players are easily and quickly hitting caps max plus vending - lots of cash to even buy directly at Enclave.
---
Exactly. I was lucky enough to get a Marsupial recipe from the SBQ. When player vending went live I started selling them for 300 each, and every time I get over 17.5k I buy a new recipe. I think I'm up to 8 or 9 now. Bought one yesterday, and I'm back up to 10k or so already.
---
How much do you normally sell yours for? I sell mine for 30 caps and they fly off my shelves!
---
Every gamer is a programming master. They know all the ins and outs of game development. Its common knowledge you have to if you want to play a game. /s
---
B-but muh economy!
---
yeah... there are groups abusing this to mock players.
---
Drama... drama never changes.
---
When I went down to do that quest I had to get right up against the tube to deploy it. 
---
The icon saying to go back up is likely showing another quest, in order to go do that quest is to go to the exit which is up.
---
I gave up on mole lady. The scrip bank per day is too low and the loot is never good. Don‚Äôt need any more Autostim wooden legs or Troubleshooter knuckles thank you very much.
---
Ok keep thinking you have fans following your profile consisting of nothing but ‚ÄúHACKERS ARE RUINING PC GAMING EVEN THOUGH I DONT PLAY ON PC. THAT IS WHY I PREFER CONSOLES‚Äù.
---
Maybe someone has a rug lying around?
---
Waiting for delete post&amp;account in 3...2...1...
---
Same
---
I sell them for 20
---
Or that
---
Yeah, sadly until they up the scrip per day she really isnt worth even stopping by :/ hope Bethesda reads reddit as much as they say they do..
---
Nocturnal melee and Troubleshooter armor for me
---
Lol the irony. Complains about provoking comments. OP's entire post is to provoke the sub.
---
Since the last update I have been getting 3* items to drop almost every time. I don't know if it is just me getting lucky or if they changed something.
---
Tomorrow they said.
---
My absolute max is 150 caps for armor or weapons, since honestly if you spend 10 minutes in flatwoods and sell everything you pick up you can make that back. I'm sure the purveyor was supposed to help clear out all the duped items in game and help reset the economy. I wish you could buy scrip for some outrageous amount of caps as well, that way dupers could sink even more of their ill-gotten gains into a hole.
---
That worked, thank you so much!
---
yeah the invisible or still sleeping ghouls thing has been happening to me too
---
#2020 baby!
---
All that matters is you scrap them, doesn't matter how you go it.
---
Can‚Äôt add you bc of your PSN settings
---
Ive never actually said that but it's clear as day you're quickly becoming my number one fan Mr stalker lol
---
Just a thought. So if there's no easy way to arrange for a fall for players helping out, what's another way for them to kill themselves? - Drop a grenade?
---
Raiders gonna raid
---
Thanks I'm going to show this at e3
---
Do you know just how much work is behind coding? 
---
You're speaking about something you seem to know nearly nothing about, claiming quality should be achieved in a specific time frame.
---
 While I agree with you on the lengthily time frame on bug fixes, I don't think you're taking into consideration just how many bugs we're talking about. And give credit where credit is due, they've come a long way since launch. 
---
Think of it this way, even if they had 10,000 players helping them, and everyone at Bethesda working on these bugs, it wouldn't make them get fixed any faster. Each one of these bugs is a mathematical equation with tons of variations that a simple miss-type of a key can implement a disastrous chain of events. 
---
People working on bug fixes have a shitload of trial and error work to do, hundreds of hours of typing and copy/pasting. Trial running, ciphering
---
Yea I only have a bunch of fluids. Its fine tho I think I‚Äôll just drop my own nuke love tap the queen and kill fodder on a busy server tonight.
---
Cool. I‚Äôll look for you online tomorrow.
---
Sure! Send me a request
---
GT: diealegend
---
Pretty much what I was thinking. Maybe trade aiming for mutants or two shot
---
Edit; would take incendiary if it's an option
---
I doubt they would do that, but I could see them doing a few things that don't undercut their investment strategies. 
---
A few ideas to go with a Double XP weekend:
---
* Bobble Boogie - Double the effects of Bobbleheads all weekend
---
* Fasting Friday - Hunger degrades 50% slower on Friday
---
* No Spoilers Saturday - Food doesn't spoil on Saturday
---
* Super Duper Sunday - Double the chance that Super Duper will proc when crafting on Sunday
---
Not the best ideas, but all of those together would make for a pretty cool weekend without being too generous.
---
They better be a rolling pins and wood armor
---
I've always advocated forcing "boss" enemies to drop 3* items  (the SBQ and Imposter Sheepsquach).  To some extent, this has happened with the Scorched Earth event dropping a guaranteed 2* item.  The reason is simple: the resource expenditure and relative difficulty of the fight justifies it.
---
But ordinary 3* enemies really aren't tougher than their non-Legendary counterparts and encountering them is often sheer luck.  So, it's not that annoying to me if they drop 1* goods.  What does annoy me, though, is stuff in the Legendary pool that fundamentally cannot have Legendary modifiers or more than one star, which ends up skewing the rate of junk from 3* enemies.
---
Are you PS4. If so, I‚Äôm a moderator for a mainly to but Everyone plays discord and we‚Äôd be happy for anyone to join if you‚Äôre interested. I‚Äôll pm it to you if you want
---
Can I borrow your luck for a few days?
---
Same thing happened to me. It fixed itself after 24hours.
---
Thank you üôè
---
Close. Knuckles/pipes and wood armor.
---
You and Tobias are some of the most eloquent fucking raiders on this sub, giving good advice, stories,  etc but I see the shit constantly downvoted and called lies etc. I don't really get it.
---
Basically there's no fucking point in the enemies being scaled like that since I seem to get 2-3 stars from one star enemies too and never from 3 star enemies, it's so fucking random. And yes I'm sure it's impossible to get them from 1-2 star enemies but they're so rare it just doesn't seem to make a difference if they do or don't. They usually don't drop period and whenever they do I'm just surprised to see one and usually have no idea where I got it.
---
The raider life just isn‚Äôt the same after not being able to demolish camp
---
It seems like they fix low priority bugs in huge piles. Last huge pile was like 3 patches ago when the patch notes were about 3 pages long. I expect we'll see another huge pile of minor bug fixes with the first patch in nuclear winter.
---
Ahhhh yes. I forgot it was scrap and not collect
---
Except this isn't an MMO. But yes, I would still like to see a feature like that.
---
No I thought it would have been way too cumbersome to change my build /perks just to suit one weapon.
---
Maybe in hindsight I should have done so! Thanks üôè
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre *grounded*‚Äù
---
I know the damage and AOE if pretty OP I just hate the sound the effects and their almost universal use, the 'must have' weapon, I just like a quieter life, silent and deadly melee. I love creeping right up to my foe with stealth, muffled and unyielding armor pieces and bloodied. It may be an age thing, I hate fireworks also irl.
---
Stop collecting things because that's majority of the premise of this game.
---
I think I'll keep mine.  It's a great immediate measure of somebody's knowledge.  It's pretty remarkable how few people, at least those playing Fallout, can sound out Quasar without sounding like they're chewing on a mouthful of crackers
---
Awesome! This is the sort of immersion I play fallout games for! 
---
Good luck out there making Appalachia the Wasteland of your dreams.
---
Yeah I feel like it's plenty balanced, there's no where near the quality of mods for PA and no legendary effects. Making the small Carry weight and 200 points of DR fair. I mean Excavator has the worst DR of of all with the most carry weight bonus. Making it little better than Marine and BOS combat armor.
---
Ya I know how hard it is to code. There‚Äôs an entire team behind the game not 1 dude with a MacBook.
---
Been over 6 months since release and there are still bugs that have been in the game since release. I‚Äôm not talking about new bugs or annoying bugs like trade menu dropping for no reason or locations spawning ash piles instead of enemies. I‚Äôm talking about events that still can‚Äôt be completed, challenges that still are broken, the fact that there are still any bugs is a bad thing I think this game has more potential than any game I‚Äôve ever played, but Bethesda puts out mediocre rushed dlc instead of good quality content or bug fixes.
---
EDIT: and yes they‚Äôve done a lot since launch but broken features 6 months in is ridiculous. Not saying they haven‚Äôt worked hard they‚Äôre just not working in the right places I have 0 blame for the people working there except for the decision makers
---
Rooftop garden! Please!
---
I gave up on her for weapons, at least.  There's so much junk in the melee Legendary pool that it's simply not worth it.  I do try for 3* armor though, because it's only 60 scrip and the odds of getting something useful - if not for you, then to resell - seem a bit better.
---
Interesting, someone told me the gun doesn't work anymore, and they had to go up next to it. I'll have to do some testing, thanks
---
Maybe they did take the munitions factory and got contested by someone else and lost and now they're butthurt about it....lol
---
I have played almost all weapons except laser and BE gatling is my favorite, even if I didn't like heavy weapons....
---
Oh, look.  Another filthy console pleb.  :P
---
Yeah the aggro decision is based on level or dps or something. You need to get more or whatever its measuring.
---
To those too lazy to search it, its coming tomorrow
---
Add marsupial, the +1 strength chest mod, and calibrated shocks and you get close to 500.
---
Raider or not I will revive you, just please don't shoot me in the face after that!
---
I never understood the appeal of role playing a bad guy.  My high school DnD group tried it a couple times, and it always left me feeling meh.  Sure we took over a castle, beheaded the nobleman that owned it and formed a pact with a local orc warlord for control of a large portion of the map, with the idea of building more power to eventually turn the world into our empire, but they all felt like empty victories.
---
I feel like the world is shitty and hopeless enough without creating another fantasy version for amusement.
---
Only if you play PvP.  It hardly matters in PvE.
---
Agreed or between now and release of nuclear winter. Just wish they prioritized bugs a little higher than some of the content they rolled out
---
I live there, this spot is awesome.
---
Wait. First you say the challenges were undoable. Then you say you went and did them...just to spite Bethesda. The post just doesn‚Äôt make sense.
---
I reread the post. I see you meant new challenges are impossible so you went back and did leftovers.
---
Actually they aren't I tested it and it worked fine. Then I messed around with a quad one, sure it chewed through ammo but I was able to use it without depleting all of my fusion cells in one go.
---
Automation is imminent. Give in, humans.
---
Pfft dream on.
---
That‚Äôs just being a smart vendor
---
My conspiracy sense is piquing.
---
Whaaaaaaat!
---
That‚Äôs good news! Thanks man.
---
I have a two shot pump action named Two Pump Chump. Been trying to come up with one for a B/SS/Limb damage Power Fist. Maybe Pfisto.
---
Try headgear, also someone mentioned bandanas are unlocked as well.
---
Will do. Anything in particular that you want to do?
---
Self appointed, I don't see no government.
---
I like them all also how bout a Casino with holdem and slots there is a cap sink I can get behind...
---
The problem with Prime and the Gatling Gun is that it replaces the Speedy receiver, cutting your fire rate by a LOT (speedy receiver is like 50% faster fire rate).
---
So your per-hit goes up, but your overall DPS goes down.
---
Primed BE 50cal is the ultimate gun.
---
Raid what you want ...but stay off my property ! I stick to myself until provoced !
---
Upvoted for good writing OP üëç
---
First, I check the daily challenges, and equip whatever attire is necessary for the level up challenge.
---
Then, I check to see if there are any events going on that I love...(AWOL Armaments, Enclave Events at the Big Red Rocket or Harper's Ferry, Horde Events, recent nuclear attacks).  If so, I'll just do those until they run out. 
---
I'll follow that with daily challenges, weekly challenges, visiting interesting looking vendors,  farming, less interesting events.
---
What's funny is that you can SEE how laughably tiny the explosion radius of it is. It's like a little baby explosion about the size of a trash can. It has to be a bug. When you look at the explosion effect of stuff like the pumpkin or bug grenade which fill up a whole room with the colored cloud... meanwhile the blue cloud from the quantum grenade is like a mouse fart.
---
I want to be able to to cycle between the ranks of a card instead of owning multiple.
---
Example I often run first aid 3 but sometimes I run first aid 1 depending on what other cards I have equipped.
---
Instead of owning rank 3 and rank 1 I would like to own rank 3 people able to select it and tell it to apply as rank 1.
---
Yeah, but by the time it has hit youtube (12 hours ago from this post), the major duping groups have already used it.
---
I run my plans for nearly anything at 25 caps each unless I know it's harder to find. Never anything over 100 caps tho. I also sell a bunch of legendaries with effects I think are good. But I also have it clearly posted prices are negotiable. Problem solved.
---
Dude, I'm speaking as someone who runs what I consider a decent shop, but also grind for all the nice gear I sell (some semi-crap admittadly) so quiet u.
---
The youtube dupe from today got fixed 2 hours after it came out, so it didnt do too much damage
---
Shh!  They'll never learn if you feed 'em.
---
Now I have a new idea for my magazine machine, thanks.
---
HAHA what? That is basically every single one of your comments. How are you even denying that now?
---
My first drop was Empath and I was really disappointed.... Until we all realized it was broken back then....
---
I think it's fixed now. No one buys it anymore.
---
VATS stealthy sniper here.  I live outside PA, but use it in nuke zones, and yes VATS is utter MURDER on cores.  It's probably even worse than a jetpack!
---
It's not rocket science.
---
The only nukes I've seen in the last couple weeks were the few that I launched as well
---
Dont think there is any hood ? I bought it but never found one .
---
Irradiated seagulls and crow are there in Fallout 4. And chicken are also birds which are in both 4 and 76. So I guess birds are there but I believe the bigger predators will have mostly hunted them to extinction.
---
Did you get Steve at Death Claw Isle?
---
lol @ mouse fart, this is a very accurate description :)
---
Not saying just legendarys. Mags, Bobbleheads, hell even abit of Nuka-Cola wouldn't hurt.
---
Not every single developer, just a couple of the big established names. We don't know if it's misallocation of funding, undertrained staff, unreasonable deadlines, lack of quality control, or garbage supervision. Could be all of them, could be a severe case of one. Whatever the mix was, it led to this mess. But either way the state of the product they put out was only accepted because people wanted it to come closer to what it is today, based on their previous experience with the company. You think a game like hollow knight or cuphead would have gotten big if it had the same horrendous management that bethesda has right now? That dark souls would ever have anywhere close to the cult following it has now if the first game had issues like the damage bug in f76 that went unsolved for months?
---
I guess it's like treating an ER patient that got into a major car accident and has an arterial tear.  Sure, he might have an oddly shaped mole on his neck or untreated hypertension, but those are things to worry about in the future after he recovers from major trauma.
---
I guess another example would be a small city's police force.  When a series of murders or drug overdoses occurs, I doubt Sheriff Taylor is going to continue prioritizing the apprehension of the Dirty Burt the butt-toucher or Spit the graffiti writer over something much more dangerous to his community.
---
it makes sense, in mmorpgs the dps have to be careful because of the same system, but without the aggro skill it's just a mess.
---
the point of being tanky is giving up on the higher damage so the mobs will always harass my dps friend. in classic games you'd be waiting for my aggro skill and then unleash your highest dps abilities, that adds to the coordination and makes the game more enjoyable
---
Uhm, I think u both misunderstand communism and my motives.
---
Great thanks
---
Apparently they do, if there are so many issues in the game that community modders fixed years ago in fallout 4. Every few weeks we have people with bug roundups, some of which include datamined information showing the exact problem and what would be needed to solve it. Even with people on this sub doing the developers' work for them they can't get it done
---
I RP a raider but I'm naturally anti-social in real life so I am in game too. I play by myself, or with my wife only. We stick together, and only together. We are extremely suspicious of any others we come across, and are quick to turn on them, and dispatch them if it benefits our survival for another day. After all, all we have left is each other.
---
It doesn't always work, pun not intended. Sometimes it just requires password again, most of the times after an update or if a rare crash happens.
---
You are assuming that the youtube video was the absolute first showing /discovery of the dupe. I don't think it was.
---
Did you try the taunt emote? /s
---
So when trying to access the key pad I need to interact with to get TNT key 7 I keep running I to the problem of getting blocked by and invisible wall. Is the keypad no longer accessible or something?
---
Circle-Jerk harder.
---
Of course exploits are top-priority, they ruin the game for everyone. Spawning inside someone's foundations is secondary to duping, and I'm surprised people are arguing otherwise.
---
Im pretty sure its damage based. I run a bloodied unarmed build and when i fight the queen she will ignore every single person down there for me as soon as I hit her once.
---
Its much more manageable if there are other unarmed builds down there because she doesnt focus on me nearly as much.
---
It did at one time. They killed that effect. But could have brought it back in a later patch. They like re-introducing things. Usually bugs.
---
Whenever people hit me during vending, I receive that as the universal signal for "Take as long as you need" and start browsing even slower.
---
Dupers dont spread their methods so that doesnt happen, so realistically very little knew before the video, hence why there hasnt been any big influx of duped stuff
---
It was a wood armor. it's bugged
---
similar =/= literally copy/paste
---
Ok thanks
---
Just as a quick PSA, mostly you just have to get stuff and scrap, but magazines only count if you pick them up in the wild. So only buy magazines if you want the effect of the magazine, not for meeting challenges.
---
MLG #1 man.
---
Yeah definitely !
---
lol, i'd be fine with something like that, i don't want it to be broken, the ability could lock me in an animation and at the same time keep the aggro only for a limited amount of time, but it would do a world of difference for tank healer builds
---
\*laughs in my reddit name in 76\*
---
I believe it's a well known bug... happens to wood armor and assaultron head.
---
you sure it was a quantum grenade and not a nuka grenade? these are 2 distinct items and only the nuka grenade has this huge explosion you describe.
---
someone should honestly just make a bot that replies to every comment of his how he's a misinformation-spreading spammer.
---
Agree with this completely. Regular three star enemies aren't really *that* rare if you go looking for them. I generally find 2-3 on a normal weeknight session and many more with longer weekend sessions.
---
Of course im denying it, it's just another of your silly comments aimed at dragging out your petty little squabble.
---
Yes hackers on PC is one of the reasons why i prefer console gaming, but ive never once said "hackers are ruining PC gaming" lol just how many more stupid comments are you going to post....
---
Yeah I'm usually down there blasting her with the zealots prime gatling gun and then she's more likely to only have eyes for me. Then once someone can claw her on the ground she maybe ignores me. If I'm lucky. But then the adds come knockin. Tbt I'm more afraid of stingwings  and cave crickets then the queen.
---
I'd do anything for you babe ‚ù§
---
Oddly enough, it counts when you kill them with a syringer for another challenge but not for chemist and just shooting them.
---
Wish they'd fix these challenges asap. A bit ridiculous.
---
If you do know how much work it is, and have an idea of what goes on behind closed doors, you'd realise there are reasons for this. 
---
It isn't as easy as "fixing the bug" finding a solution is only a single possibility to addressing a bug, but that solution can cause dozens of other bugs. So is it really a solution? 
---
They have no income on this game aside from Atom shop purchases and copies sold. They can't just focus all their reasources of fixing fallout 76's bugs as they would go broke. 
---
Have you ever considered they have tried numerous times to fix these bugs but nothing has worked, yet? Are you under the impression they don't know of these bugs, or do you think they just don't care and are focused on DLC and greed? 
---
Give me some concrete evidence on how they can fix the bugs and I'll agree to your statement. Just saying "it's been 6 month" doesn't mean anything to me as I've been following this game since it was just a teaser.
---
 Todd did state, "there's guna be problems but work with us, cause we aren't giving up on this game" not word for word, but I do have hope they will eventually iron things out. At least we get to tag along for the ride and not wait 7 years for another fallout game.
---
I agree. I have two alt characters and it‚Äôs great to switch between them and the primary.
---
not to mention the tones of bugs that have became prominent as well.
---
Every day. 
---
Leaving test data in a production database or vise versa is an easy fix (assuming they are the only issue, not the values themselves). 
---
Bugs can be as easy as a misplaced character or as complex as library conflicts. Conflicts can take months to fix because your conflict can come from a dependent function, which then has to be changed. 
---
As someone else, including OP mentioned, you triage these issues. Scope, scale &amp; quality of the repair are considered.
---
Last decision is implementation. Will you need a hotfix? Wait for an update? Or are all the changes in the database, meaning you won‚Äôt need a version update.
---
You give off the impression that most of what you say can be dismissed, with great prejudice.
---
At least you're honest!
---
A giant skunk with a flamer-like attack would be awesome.
---
naw, it pops up about 50% of the time even though i've put the correct option in. it just doesn't remember the info. have no issues with any other game
---
No problem, glad it worked for you!
---
Except for the first set up, why do people need to buy serums, I've had my mutation collection for months now with no need to change them, all except marsupial from sitting in a hot rad puddle.
---
Don't people use Starched Genes and Class Freak?
---
You also fail to realize the rampant mental problems that are probably peppered throughout. Someone with severe depression might not feel relief. What about bipolar people? Not saying everyone with a mental condition is a 'raider' type of individual, but as someone who suffers from depression, and is married to someone who shares the same ailment, sometimes you can have those feelings without needing a logical cause. Now imagine a post apocalyptic world, after being crammed together underground for 25 years.
---
Yes I definitely know I SHOULD have stashed my junk, but I was an idiot and went into the event assuming I would be alone. It really is my fault for being so naive to think I wouldn't die, but it still doesn't excuse players being assholes just to be assholes and hinder others enjoyment of the game.
---
Usually I log in, make sure my gear is in serviceable condition, harvest my crops and make food, and clear out my extractors.
---
Then, assuming I don't need anything specific, I pick a region that tickles my fancy and fast travel.  Once there, I proceed to go on walkabout.
---
I got the same drop from the purveyor the other day. I typically run a bloodied rifle build but decided to try and make a half assed heavy build of it for the queen.
---
My experience matches your theory. My lvl 255 takes forever to craft food. My lvl 110 can craft much more quickly
---
Agreed between the last update and the start of nuclear winter they should be updating and patching as many bugs as they can stuff that has been here since beta such as scraping bulk junk or the challenge bugs.
---
If I were Bethesda I'd want to fix this. Word starts getting around. Then you release some solid content/DLC and by the time Christmas rolls around you have a very solid game.
---
What frustrates me is I know the devs want to fix this but they probably aren't allocated enough resources and the people calling the shots are working on the next title.
---
It's a shame man because it's really us who got fucked, and every time I log in I see some new virtual shit pushed down my throat. Sure here's 20 bucks for 2,400 atoms. Now take my 24 dollars and stop stuffing it in your damn pocket. Fix this shit bro. For real.
---
You were bearboozled! Hope you got your rug, friend!
---
it doesn't for me. every now and then i have to rewrite my password, regardless if i use the launcher or 76 shortcut. with patch, do you mean the large patches (like patch 9), or just any patch? if it was just any patch - i.e. not planned, with no info visible - then i could see the prompt for password being connected to patching, but if it's only for the big patches then i definitely have to login way more often (a few times a week, some weeks).
---
Hi u/NIKwithoutaC,
---
We're planning to address this issue in the next update, Patch 10. 
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
its true the game has changed but we know what never changes.

 &gt;Thanks for sharing!
---
If it was over 3 days, that's only 450 extra scrip
---
True that, but XP after level 50 is kinda useless. I mean yeah continue to respec your build but meh.
---
I'd love to do Project Paradise, as I haven't done it yet but I'm just down to do some group events. I'm just getting back into FO76 (been playing regularly for the last 3 weeks) after a 3 month hiatus.
---
I feel you, I live in nerd rage territory. And as soon as I become not well fed it drops me to what must be 1hp lol
---
But I feel like that's a trade off for being so powerful. I've learnt to live with it and just never carry any valuable junk.
---
It was when Survival beta was first introduced
---
I'de like to clarify to the nit pickers and those who  clearly misunderstood what I'm saying.
---
-You CAN sell whatever u want. I just won't buy it.
---
-RARE costumes, Bobbleheads and Mags are good stock.
---
-Not only talking about God tier shit when I say something worth selling.
---
-Yes I'm bad at spelling.
---
What I mean by Garbage:
---
-The random guns every second scorch drops
---
-Common clothes 
---
-The bulk junk that literally everyone's overflowing with  (Cloth, Rubber, Glass, etc. )
---
That is all, grow up.
---
Full auto, my 1\* instigating handmade that's full auto just murders enemies before they can even properly react (If you run a stealth commando build). Since yours is also exploding, a barrage of explosions is better than a couple per secound with semi auto. Ive ran both semi and full-auto, sem is better for ammo consumption, but if you want to do the job done quick at the cost of a couple extra bullets, full auto is the way.
---
Normally if the enemy isn't at full health, I just swap to my AAE handmade since that things a beast, shame the damn thing got duped and it's value lessened.
---
I only have pictures documenting it from this month. But yeah, you're right. It's been a longer issue than that. At least it makes enemies easier to spot?
---
This outfit looks great with the welding mask BTW  worth a look.
---
As a DPS I second this omg. Please let us have tanks.
---
I'm down for a run...lvl 248 here..want to do it with people who want to complete quest and not just kill alpha
---
It worked for Big Papa Moe's Lip Smackin' Sandwich Shack.
---
&gt;‚ÄùCouldn't believe it when I saw that truck at that abandoned quarry in the bog. Radiation warning signs everywhere and it went right through. Pulling out a few hours later with a full load to take to Charlie's kitchen.
---
&gt;It was bad enough that he was driving me out of business, but to feed Beckley poisoned food is the last straw. Can't wait to see the look on his face tomorrow morning when I let him have it.‚Äù
---
There is whole goddamn armor class which is useless trash because of 1 star bug. Even purveyor 3* wooden armor becomes 1* after relog. Bug that makes 1 armor class useless. Never fixed since launch
---
üòÇ Cheeky bastard lol I'd of definitely laughed in anger at the genius of this.
---
Ohh okay thanks!
---
I enjoy "resets" in Fallout games, that force you to start from zero gear.
---
* like in the Dead Money DLC.
---
* like in the Frost (FO4 mod) final stage.
---
* like in the FO3 spaceship DLC.
---
I don't know if something similar could fit in FO76...
---
I'd be happy if they were just prevented from dropping 1* items and drills tbh.
---
Captainoob has a pretty good discord.
---
I haven't copied anything, im sorry but id definitely recommend picking up the game on PS4 due to the bigger player base, less issues and no hackers, i stand by my comment 100%
---
Get to level 50 and let me throw you a fully modded Bloodied gun for free if your on Xbox. Let's also get you adrenal reaction. 
---
You'll be bitch slapping those Super Mutants in no time. Then you can be jaded and bored like me.
---
I do the exact same thing lol. I thought it was just me. I want to ‚Äúearn‚Äù the item and no pay for it all
---
ive had to change my password so...many...times... cause im an idiot
---
I took a shot at it so it turned aggressive....it would hover very low to shoot at me and I was able to get a pic of it.
---
To give you an idea what its worth, how many do you see for sale or trade?  Not many, I known I wouldn't sell or trade my one.
---
yep, i bet it's as frustrating for the tank as it is for the dps
---
I save scrip for two days, and then I go for either three 3* ranged, six 2*, or any combination of the two I feel like that day. I agree the limits are too low, but not going every day helps me keep my sanity.
---
i a had two crap tons of legs spawn last night on a nuked zones I scrapped so much useless crap I hit my daily scrip limit in couple of hours now ask me if any of them were good------(all junk)
---
Your telling me putting an ‚Äúif‚Äù statement on the wooden armor bug wouldn‚Äôt fix it easy and fast. It‚Äôs simple, but they‚Äôre focused on the battle royal mode nobody is gonna play unless they put awesome rewards.
---
I mean that's fine. I have no friends on my console so I lone wolf it 99% of the time. Generally I leave people alone and am generally left alone since I'm level like 160something or so. There just always seems to be the ones who can't help but spam you with hits while you're at a vending machine or casually walking by. Some even follow you through the entire server constantly harassing you over and over daring you to fight back. Persistent buggers as they are. 
---
Its often funny though because I've been sought out by lower levels for help on a few Ocassions due to that which I don't mind doing. My loadout is geared to defend more than glass cannon. I rock tesla rifles to catch dumb raiders out. That arc deviates entire groups of people in a clip or 2. I've taken on 3 at once before provided they aren't on legacy lasers or I'm at lack of cover. Teslas arc around corners. Its pretty neat to watch.
---
If I need a couple of 3 scrip armor pieces I'll pay 100 or less.
---
Generally I don't buy 3* legendary weapons for scrip. But I'd happily pay 250 or lower for 40 scrip if I was short of time.
---
I made a suggestion about wild boards a while back - they'd fit right in and would be something to be feared.
---
There's actually a pond at Whitesprings that if you go underwater - there are fish in there!! I need fishing now!
---
Hard to say, I image a lot of players that were hoarding stuff, were hoarding stuff they considered good, so wouldn't want to just throw it in the wood chipper.
---
The value of legendaries has already dropped though just from the existence of the Purveyor and ability to reliably get higher starred legendaries, so who knows.
---
This happened to me as well when I completed a quest and received a quest item, it puts one in your inventory but strangely enough it also drops one on the ground that you cannot pick up.
---
I wish that like the Brahmin pen - we could have a chicken coop in our camps!!
---
Just obtained a Left Leg that was non-legendary, so can confirm you can obtain as such.
---
lost two stars due to shipping time.  Would not buy again.
---
That just pisses me off I didn't get one in my inventory i quit and played red dead 2 probably check back some other day
---
Oh 100% it has to be. Give them a taunt of some kind. Strength perk of some kind?
---
Diagnosed depressed here. Doesn't matter how bad it get's for me I never enjoy making other people feel bad. 
---
Fail to realize is a wrong assumption on your part. I know how much of a problem mental illness is. Trust me, I had this in my mind the entire time I was writing this. 
---
&gt; Now imagine a post apocalyptic world, after being crammed together underground for 25 years. 
---
Well, this didn't really happen to any of us. That's a pitiful excuse.
---
I'm on PC and I can confirm, even when I don't play for a few days I come back and often see familiar names. If I try to server hop, the game almost always puts me in the same server. I think I've even run into a few of the same people in person more than once
---
Must have been the nuka grenade then.
---
yup, traded 60 scrip for 3*wood armor only to be downgraded to 1star a few moments later the other day
---
ku-way-zar?
---
Use a pressure plate and it will only activate when the plate is pressed.
---
Oh I definitely laughed out loud.
---
Sneaky bastard haha
---
you stole that my mirelurk king is named steve :)
---
Thank you Lady!
---
I would not worry too much about armor type until you hit level 45-50.
---
Serves people right if they're too lazy to pay attention
---
Logged on to find out all the armor equipped, weapons, and caps were gone. Bethesda said I was compromised. If they had 2FA, that wouldn‚Äôt of happened
---
You have to use something else. Idk what its called but it's in the conduits and has a wheel thing on it that you can connect it and set it up for a couple seconds. The wheel has numbers on it 1-9. I didn't mess with it much in fo4 but it's basically a timer.
---
Boss enemies specifically should not be able to drop 1* items or very low tier items, especially enemies like sheepsquatch or the imposter. It‚Äôs incredibly obnoxious to do ‚ÄúFree range‚Äù for something like a 1 Star Mutants broadsider.
---

---
plus you get to feed your alts all sort of goodies you never had 1st playthru let see a lvl 10 instigating exploding hunting rifle   yes please----- full set of excavator armor at lvl 25 sure that sound fun----- and its really fun to squish someone that assumes your a weak noob when you one shot them after they poke at you at a vendor
---
Watoga will be set free.
---
maybe its just my new camp location but i have campfire/crop and rug/crop blueprints prior to patch9 and cant place. it shows green but i get the overlapping error or something. looks like they fixed it for good
---
The biggest hurdle is the stabilizing mats (the two masses and HR fluids).  Here‚Äôs how:
---
You can make, without super duper, and with a horrible uncharismatic character, 400ish caps a serum.  3 serums and you hit your let‚Äôs say 1200 caps.  5 characters a day, in 3 days (450 unstable flux) you get enough for another serum.  19 serums you‚Äôre done in ~60 days, with the rounding of caps going in your favor.  Xfering that stuff between characters requires a friend or second account, and a second account gets that done in half the time, and this isn‚Äôt mentioning super duper on flux or serums in your favor.
---
Your only limiting factor from swimming in caps via this method is having the stabilizing mats.  Nuked sbq is easily 200 violet and maybe 100 of cr/fl/ye, but the stabilizing mats tend to be pretty sparse.  WS is typically overrun as well with people.  What we need is the best place to nuke for stabilizing mats, not flux.
---
Sure the game has duper‚Äôs.  It also has people that know how to legit make money.  Conflating those two types of people is a mistake.  This is why removing the cap limit is a bad idea.  The smart people will just be at the new cap, inflating the value of god roll items moreso than they already are.
---
I'm not saying I don't enjoy when they fail to mute themselves, just that true PvP elitists will never have an un-partied mic active during battle.
---
There definitely needs to be a focus on community infrastructure in the future.  I think player vending helped a LOT, but a lot of social utility is still missing from the game.  
---
Even a simple system of sending messages or care packages to friends that may not be online, something they could grab out of their camp mailbox when they log in, would go a LONG way.  Maybe I go to someone's camp, see they have a weapon I really like, log into their terminal and write them a message asking if they'd accept a trade for a couple weapons I have in my stash.  
---
As a player that loves to sell and specialize in legendary weapons, I'd really like more options for trades.  I have haggled with players that want to buy stuff at my machine, but either don't have the caps or prefer a trade, and it usually works out great for them.  (gave away a shielded raider underarmor the other day because the lower level guy couldn't afford 2000c and I was nearly at cap limit anyways)  There's just not enough in the game to spend caps on, aside from the very rare high end gun I'll find selling for either an insane cap amount or basically given away at various player vending machines.  If it's stupidly undervalued, I'll try to get on area chat to talk to the owner and explain the value on the reddit trading market before purchase.  I hate buying bloodied/explosive guns for 500 caps unless the seller is fully aware of what they can get for them if they choose to barter online.
---
You can't damage them directly, so no grenades or mines from yourself.  There are usually environment mines in the road in front of Poseidon Energy Plant, around where the concrete barricades are.  Those might work.
---
If they were in PVP with another player, and you were on their team, then that would probably work too.  So you'd need 2 other people, one to be the PVP'er and one to be your teammate.  Your teammate and the other player would fight each other, and you'd revive your teammate once they go down.
---
I was getting hit by invisible enemies for like 15 minutes till I finally caught that the flatwoods monster was stalking me, I took its spot and it hates my camp
---
Exactly, we have to get the point across. Be ready to fight for your shit if you try to take a workshop!
---
Regardless of how difficult they make challenges, I will always spend real money on Atoms and hope that there are others like me out there.  It's people that spend money on the game that keeps the whole funding going on for all the new content.  We just finished Wild Appalachia and are looking forward to the upcoming Nuclear Winter.  If everyone's attitude is they refuse to spend money and should make daily challenges easier, well then Bethesda should just stop making any new content or start charging for it.  But then again, the community would riot.
---
Thank you for being like the only constructive person. And not just a rawr-storm.
---
They need to follow old school Halo and make EVERY weekend Fri-Sun double XP.
---
We are a minority here lol
---
It's really a shame, because you don't have to be hateful or an asshole, to play the part in a game, it is fun to be a delinquent and do the kinds of debauchery you can't if you're a goodie goodie lol
---
Isn't that exactly what formula Q is supposed to do? Immediately piss off all nearby animals?
---
In mothership zeta I went in with wjnterized power armor and shit ton of ammo, that weren‚Äôt no reset friend XD
---
I've had this situation where we all talking on team and switched to area.. then we call them out for talking smack behind our backs until we all talking to each other as we killing.. fun times. :D
---
Lol nice name. Thanks
---
I was just using vats and all the mobs around sbq had health bars... Didnt notice if the players did tho.. Kinda hectic
---
There needs to be some form of challenge in PvE. PA eliminates the threat of damage and radiation, and VATS eliminates having to aim, so you have to be challenged some other way. It's been this way since launch. Should have factored that in when deciding on your build.
---
I purchased a 3* weapon from a player vendor that somehow took on the custom name of my power armor, and my power armor name reverted to the default
---
Nope, business as usual
---
Dude. Go look at your own profile. See how many times you‚Äôve posted about hackers on PC. You‚Äôre either trolling or completely lacking self awareness.
---
Ok everyone PM each other gamertags lol.
---
I dont give a crap about the alpha, just wanna get things fed and kept alive.
---
üëç Looks like I need to get onboard.
---
I don't agree with that. [Here's a decent build that requires you to be level 200 without taking card packs into account.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=9f34a78&amp;d=pg2ph1pi1sb2c72pp2lt2l71a72pq1sv3s01ib4au2a00pe2lu2eo2ic4&amp;w=cu0ek1l20su2sd0so0sp0la0lq0lf0ls2li0s22sq0s30sr0pd2pk1pl1pr2a42eh1s12id1ce0c10c62p10at1lm2po2ss2s50si0sj0s40sm0sn0se2p72pa0p80p90ir2i44ij2if2ip2iq2ie2ih2ik0i61i30ia0i50e60el1eq1e00eg1ew1et1ep1c31c52cr0ag2as2ae2l92es2sw1&amp;n=E%20Automatic%20Rifles/SMG&amp;m=fc2) 
---
Now, not every build is like that, but many players get to level 50 with an extremely sub-optimal build. If someone picks any of the Lockpicking or Hacker perks, they basically wasted a few levels, and being able to level up past 50 is really useful.
---
Gt egaman69 .....on in early evenings
---
It's impossible for me... this quest made me stop playing the whole game.  I was level 32, and I can't kill level 65 scorchbeasts on my own. They all fly around the 4th transponder thing.   A glitch makes the percentage amount disappear,  so I can't find it,  and even if I could,  the enemies are too powerful.  
---
Fuck this game.
---
Yeah, this seemed to change as part of not being able to target players in VATS if you are in Pacifist mode.  They just removed the ability to see the health bars at all, VATS or not.
---
I dont know what else to say other than that a choice in a video game which is supposed to be viable but is not due to the game's systems, numbers, etc. and not another player's skill, is the definition of unbalanced in a multiplayer game. The fact that power armor is described IN GAME as being the most protective form of armor available but it is not, and that's not due to other player's skill or finesse, means that it is unbalanced. A balanced example of power armor would be that yes, you are tanky, but you cant sneak, use stealth boys, and you are easier to hit, as opposed to the current system of there literally being 0 upsides to wearing power armor. If you don't think that is unbalanced, then we simply have a big difference in opinion.
---
Vault dwellers are a plague. They sweep through Appalachia killing everything and stealing anything not nailed down. Think of all the poor baby yao guais they have murdered just for some springs and acid. And nobody even bats an eyelash! Despicable. 
---
You kill one vault dwellers and suddenly you are vilified by all. Kill thousands of innocent animals and you are praised. Talk about hypocrisy.
---
I made it my mission to protect Appalachia by killing every vault dweller I come across.
---
Hell of a song!
---
Fixing it by making them permanent 3* I hope and not by removing them from the 3* tables.
---
Do raiders at level 100 look for 2 level 20s to pick on? Had a doosh last night kill on me n my friend while we we hunting scortch. He came up starting stabing my friend and killed him. I bolted down some cliffs with power armour but he followed. We need some good guys to wipe raiders out of servers period!
---
I find this hilarious. Raiders are literally powerless since the past big patch and you're still acting empowered. 
---
Shoot my CAMP. No Damage.
---
Shoot me. No Damage. 
---
You guys are like the Black Knight in Monty Python at this point.
---
Meanwhile the regular nuka grenades are fantastic
---
Glad I stopped playing then lol
---
It's not just chem and food. Adrenal Reaction reduces max HP by 50, or 12 with Class Freak.
---
Well, I run a bloodied build. I normally sit around 48 hp. But I have hot-swap perk setups to switch between a travel loadout (utilizing class freak) and a combat loadout (that doesn't.)
---
If I am in travel loadout, and hot-swap to combat loadout, I am now at like 5hp. Normally, it's not a big deal, because I have healing factor, it heals up in seconds. But if I'm already in combat? And especially if I've already taken damage? I'm either at 5hp and die on the next hit, or just flat out die.
---
Nice delete on your post. Seems you are worse than a crying newbie
---
Maybe if I had better armor I would have lasted 1.5 seconds, instead of 1 second, when you killed me trying to retake my Lakeside Cabins workshop Tuesday evening.
---
I just need the calibrated shocks but I have the other things
---
Also, when launching the game directly (not from launcher), you should be able to paste your password into the login window - currently pasting is disabled for no good reason. That means if you use a password manager and strong passwords, you're fucked and have to type it.
---
I've heard people claiming that rad-x diluted suppresses mutations but I can tell you that has never been the case for me.  I had it hotkeyed on all my characters which all run mutations and never once is anything suppressed including Marsupial. Tool tip in my pip-boy will say it is but it's really not.
---
I don't need to look, i know ive never ever said that. There is a complete difference between talking about hackers on PC and stating "hackers are ruining PC gaming" lol
---
Ill join as many discussions/topics about hackers as i please, just because you choose to stalk me that doesn't mean you can dictate to me..
---
Casino would be DOPE. I'm not sure if the laws prohibiting gambling in gaming would apply to that.
---
Use the firebreathers helmet with that getup. I like my responders one but it does noooot go with the stalkers. Oh and I only care about outfits anymore, camps pretty sick though!
---
Is that common to all assaultron heads?? I had a nice three-star one drop and have been using it, I didn't think to check if it still had three stars..
---
The Stalker outfit looks like Pepe the frog from the waist down. Look again and tell me you don't see it.
---
Yeah I'm certain now vendor bought mags don't count
---
Same with me. AFAIK diluted is not supposed to suppress your mutations.
---
...Are you genuinely autistic? Because that would explain everything.
---
I'm sorry.  Does OP work at Bethesda and supervise work done on updates?  Does OP even work in software development?
---
Matches well with the Faust event beret and the shovel back pack
---
Use a keypad switch.
---
Then use the small letters to put the code on the beam.
---
Everyone can use it and it auto turns off after 5 seconds.
---
wait‚Ä¶ I remember we wake up in a room with no clothes or gear and we have to fight first aliens with our own fists‚Ä¶ do we have a chance to get our stash later? I guess I skipped it, then‚Ä¶ I started to grab laser weapons and lots of ammo and all the stuff around to advance...
---
Make sure to get Well Rested buff, cook some cranberry foods for xp (there's a farm near the northwest corner of map with a bunch of cranberries to pick). 
---
West Tek, Huntersville, non-nuked Whitesprings, and Harper's Ferry are my usual stomping grounds and I level very quickly. Plus, great for getting legendaries for scrip and steel if ya need it from muties' guns.
---
I love how everything Bethesda does or doesn't do is insulting to it's players.
---
And how everyone here is some master coder and apparently been crucial to the development of tons of online games that span three platforms....since everyone seems to "know" how easy it should be to fix these bugs. 
---
Does no one have a job here? Has no one ever worked on a long term project where there's a ton of stuff to work on, limited man power, new issues arising etc ...
---
Besides BGS can't win. They don't fix the exploit and they've insulted players. They prioritize fixing exploits.....it's an insult to players. They don't make it easier to get God tier items ....insult to players .... They take a lunch break....insult to players. 
---
I mean, I've played other online games. Bugs happen. Exploits happen. Sometimes they are persistent. Again this is a huge project spanning three different platforms ... It's not like there's a check box that says "Fix all bugs" they forgot to click
---
Yes, I'm sure there's some solid reasoning behind them sabotaging their own game.
---
Ahhh. I'm always like "why the F does she keep doing 180s and punching me!!!"
---
Oh look the typical insults are flooding out now lol another tough guy hid behind his keyboard...
---
Yes, there‚Äôs a quest marker that takes you to get your stuff back
---
It's not kind of useless? 
---
Other than respec your build or using some weird build you cited what's the purpose past 50 of XP?
---
I definitely want to get a run or 2 at project paradise too. You need at least 3 to succeed, but really 6-9 for optimal results. (3 per room) and at least one person to run the basement shutdown.
---
formula q? you have my interest, what is that? is it from the latest event? and does it only affect animal type cratures?
---
Except the duping went on for months unchecked until they figured out a fix for it.
---
She doesnt have much vertical range, with marsupial you can jump her hits......sometimes. still a whole lot of dying involved though.
---
Shhhhh!  You're making too much sense!  The downvotes will sniff us out!
---
Yeah but Responders is cool because it's rare.. lol cheers dude
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll add you!
---
we donno how to dooo thaaatt
---
Drop the perks that are crafting. And go for more damage. You always swap in the perks as needed. Especially if your binge crafting. Drop lead belly and get sun kissed. Eat at night and heal off the rads in the day time. 
---
Also don‚Äôt worry about food spoil. You can find canned food everywhere.
---
Edit: try this. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=cf54636&amp;d=sd2su2so2sp2pc2pg2po2ph2pi2es2ep1c72ic4ik0as2le2l92&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=
---
I left a few points for personal touch.
---
Always gotta respect the rares.
---
I might not be on tonight, but I'll be on during the weekend for sure.
---
Thankfully u have your invincible shields to hide behind, now u can live in reasonable safety.. for now.
---
They're rehearsing for a play at the Blandford rec center, let 'em be.
---
Since player vending I've seen more nukes. My guess was people's stock was running low and they wanted more to sell.
---
Usually I try to do at least two daily challenge, hopefully the 20 Atom one, plus whichever seems doable. Then I look at the weekly and see if I want to do any but I usually save these for a longer session on the weekend.
---
I'll see if there's anything I need resource-wise(disease cures, water/food or ammo usually) and set about getting stocked up. Then I usually just run around the area I did the resource run, visit a vendor to sell excess stuff, then maybe I'll pick a place I haven't been too in a while and clear it out. Maybe hit Whitesprings or The Barrows/Harper's Ferry to do a little legendary farming for a little scrip.
---
I also do quests kind of slowly, so I might progress I little in one or two quests if I feel like it. Otherwise, I'll try to do events I like or hit a Nuked region if that happens while I'm on.
---
If I feel like I have nothing to do I'll hit up Biv or the Scout Masters for their repeatable quests. Maybe hit Camden Park.
---
Right. I meant I could give them grenades to drop on themselves. That should do it.

Awesome! I‚Äôll start recruiting. What level are you?
---
I'm just north of there!  There's also an abundance of ticks in the small group of trees and a passive critter spawn even closer to the substation that spawns squirrels, beavers, and foxes!
---
There's also a junk node a bit further north next to a shack to the southwest of Bog Town, but I think supermutants usually spawn there.
---
Most deff, you ever managed to get one through an event? I had to trade for all of mine, gave up grinding for them after a good while farming Mire events for the Tattered Field Jacket and got bugger all
---
Not every Raiders like to dine on Big fish but some do prefer catching the easier smaller fish with their overpowered nets.  and as for wiping us out.. each day someone clues in to the fact its less time consuming to trap and catch dumb people then it is wandering around collecting stuff that might be there.
---
Honestly I'm shook
---
Damn okay. Well thanks for the heads up
---
I think it's acceptable as a negative to the many positives of wearing power armor, especially with legendary PA pieces in the datamine that are potentially coming out in the future.  (in some of the datamined purveyor threads, I forget which)
---
If you want to run a VATS full auto build, start working on a suit of conventional legendary armor with secondary effect AP refresh and a lot of points in Luck and Agility.  
---
I was messing around with some extra level up points the other day and a vampire/explosive/crit meter 10mm pistol that I got from the purveyor, modded it with a powerful auto receiver, popped on max Guerrilla, Better Crits, Psychopath and Four Leaf Clover perks, and it was surprisingly pretty rad without specifically creating a build around pistols.  I almost couldn't hit SPACE fast enough to keep up with the crits, and a full-auto 10mm doesn't burn AP nearly as much as a semi-auto handmade.  The stinging mag mod does blow through ammo really fast though.
---
Brewing station is a nuclear weapon? What are these guys smoking back at the game studios? Also how the heck is someone supposed to figure that out?
---
If not for the Deathclaw Meat, what about the Rad Ants?  You could be one of the few player vendors with an abundance of Rad Ant Lager.
---
Not meant as an insult, but pretty sure you are now so I‚Äôll leave it be.
---
They did a fix today. Last nite it spawned legendary. Today not one in three visits.
---
Well, it's part of the bloodied build, you become a glass cannon basically, but that build, in my opinion, already has a big trade off, and is the necessity to stay below 20% at all times to make it fully work, you are already giving up 80% of your HP in exchange of more damage. With the current system, if you're using any HP buff and do not pay attention, you may just oof walking in your C.A.M.P.
---
What model of power armor are you using?
---
I don't see the point of the restrooms when the pool is next to them üôÉ
---
Isn‚Äôt sneak worthless with 35+agility? I have a similar build but with semi auto rifles and unyielding, I dropped sneak as I didn‚Äôt notice a difference, mobs never found me with or without it equipped
---
Yeah of course you didn't mean it as an insult, just like you didn't stalk me onto this thread with the sole intention of dragging me into a petty little squabble...
---
Very brave calling people autustic whilst hid behind your keyboard.
---
yes that was the first thing I did but thank you any ways
---
Does that include explosive energy weapons?
---
If so yes. If not, no freaking way would I give up my BE gatling laser.
---
Reminds of me of the old wow boards in late vanilla. Everything was a slap in the face to the players or killing the game. 7 expacks later they are still getting the same complaints.
---
I just location spawned for the uncommon, hot my responder cop outfit, cap, and ff helmet through one of the early main story quests on my most recent char. I also got the white wolf fedora from the imposter sheepsquatch event. By walking on the red bridge at the Charleston station, I spawned the responder vendor bot(chance to spawn enemies instead btw) to get my longcoats, clean spacesuit, and uncommon ski suit colors. but otherwise I've bartered for the rest.
---
For sure.. oh look its a small herd of Ragstags that managed to survive.. dudes run up and massacre them all, eat for a night then move on to terrorize the what few animals left alive they can find..  keep up the good work.
---
Yeah it is! I just relocated to the mire from my toxic valley Lead+Junk camp. I haven't had an issue with my camp spot being taken in weeks. Toxic valley was a nightmare every time I'd log on.
---
But being limited to use only 20% of your HP at max is already a huge trade off, if you add the risk of randomly dying because you are a little hungry, or a radroach bites your knee, you end up trying to avoid any HP buff at all.
---
The more range of capabilities your build has, the more useful your character is, allowing for many different kinds of loot to be useful. There's a director correlation between your character's perks and the value you get out of loot. 
---
I linked the build I did because it's pretty balanced, and can make good use out of most loot. It has a rifle focus, with the ability to side spec into either heavy weapons, shotguns, or melee with decent output. Enough to make almost any good weapon I find worth considering. 
---
Level 50 will allow for 1 hyper focused build, if you pick your perks carefully as you level up. 
---
So no, it's not kind of useless. It's one of the best features in the game.
---
Worked for me last week when I couldn‚Äôt sign in
---
and here was me thinking Vault Dwellers were civilised folk
---
Haha! I knew it was only a matter of time until someone would recognize me!
---
This is survival of the fittest, friend. Kill or be killed.
---
If you want some advice for future PVP interactions: you can contest the workshop anywhere within the boundary, you don't need to stand in front of the workstation. Hold the build button to contest. Speaking of standing, don't do that. Crouch down and I am forced to shoot you once before being able to activate Vats.
---
Honestly, you would have been safe last update, but in Bethesda's infinite wisdom they decided survival should be 25% cap rewards and total cap rewards should be capped at 50. I was discerning with my targets, only going after high cap rewards. Now the only rewards are junk. Anyone at any level cap be carrying tons of junk. Pretty much anyone over level 10 is my target now. It use to be level 70+
---
Not to mention your at watoga, farm bots and have access to AMS, WEMS, and all the buildings in it.
---
yes I can sign into the psn it has also definitely downloaded all the updates and on disk, thx for the the help but still no luck :(
---
The problem is your gonna need two hits to kill a mutie when I do it in one with a prime, so it‚Äôs better Damage and dps to have a prime.  Anything larger than that, yes I use my BE 50 cal for the mire queens and SB.  As for the SBQ, the best dps gun in the game is a prime BE LMG.  Expensive to run but melts her in under two minutes.
---
That's nice, but this is a serious problem and this type of things shoud be fixed with hot fix patch, as soon as possible. I really hope devs will change their mind and start fix Big problems asap, instead of waiting weeks before next patch. This is not acceptable
---
Gotta make those shareholders happy bud
---
Okay, I get your point. Let me ask you this. Will you or do you (and everyone else) complain when that "non-legendary" ghoul (?) drops a legendary item? I doubt it. Many times that 3\* is not any more difficult that a non-legendary or a 1\* legendary. It baffles me the "DEMAND".
---
I think the decon shower drops from SBQ still or do what I did and buy it off someone!
---
thank you for this revelation
---
I second this. Drop all crafting and loot perks and go for damage and survivability to start. If anything, get the Hard Bargain perk so you can get more caps from selling to vendors, which will help you buy whatever you need from player vending. Mutation serums are also widely available now, so you'll want mutation-focused perks if you plan on using any of them.
---
I think it might be the same as the translation bug since last patch maybe. Seems like they've messed a bit.
---
From what little I know of coding... yup.
---
Bugs tend to be inconveniences, exploits tend to be issues threaten the stability of the game and/or the economy.  Being unable to finish some challenges is not equivalent to someone finding a new way to dupe shit.
---
Also some things get hotfixed like this because they only require server side tweaks, that's why all that happened today was a quick server downtime without having to update.  Client side tweaks require updates, which require console certs which means they take time and money and have to be bundled together instead of put out as things pop up or get fixed.
---
Also some bugs aren't as easy to fix as people like you always seen to think they are or are symptoms of larger fixes.  See EVERY time someone new pops up to complain that they scrapped all of their bulked junk which happens because of tweaks that were necessary to get all other junk properly breaking down into their components when repairing/crafting.
---
Vampire Tesla Shotgun. Good for this lone wanderer
---
But what im getting at is that bethesda cant tell if the duper is using a secondary account to move the duped goods off the ban-able account. Gt‚Äôs are free. They can keep creating new ones that they dont care if they get banned as long as the items are on another account
---
ill try again and let u know
---
With the personal terminal now available, this really should be a thing in the future. 
---
Just today I saw a whole mess of players at Robco while I was fast traveling out of the asylum after collecting a pile of straight jackets to sell, and knew I just missed out on AWOL and at least one max level 3-star drop by a matter of a minute.  With 4-5 players involved, it was probably more like losing out on 3-4 potentially great drops.

---
Survival is key. But hard bargain wasn‚Äôt an idea as realistically buying everything is second to just crafting which OP is going for. 
---
I left Op points in case they wanted to use starched genes.
---
You're not wrong.  I've waited quite a while for some drops (SBQ comes to mind), and came up empty.  But I've also gone back, after realizing lag was an issue, and collected legendaires a bit later.
---
Maybe for their mule, idk
---
Good for you
---
Its fine if you are dude. It would actually be a legit excuse for your posting history.
---
Thanks! I'll have a look and see what I could add. If it's all right can I run it past you, just for your opinion?
---
You thinking characters?  No - I mean account bans so its not just a character.  So if people want to keep buying copies of the game, then yeah they can do this but they'll be paying for a new copy each time one of their accounts is banned.
---
That‚Äôs his YouTube channel. He does great videos on weapons in 76. His discord is linked on his YouTube page. It has general discussions, trading, etc.
---
I prefer oh baby from new vegas cuz its still better then 4
---
What perks do you recommend for mutations?
---
Just wait a day, they said
---
They've already patched out the old ones and we have 2 new ones recently.  It will never be fully fixed, they will mess up somehow unfortunately.  So we'll be wiping the game again in the future.  Its just unfortunate.
---
Now if they followed my idea of unique identifiers for all legendary pieces, then duped stuff can be removed from the game for future dupes, just nuke all items with the same unique identifier.
---
give me nocturnal or give me death
---
Yes, 20 caps per scrip is about the right ratio for me as well. For the math challenged or lazy, that's: 
---
* 60 caps for a 1 star armor (3 scrip)
---
* 180 caps for a 2 star armor (9 scrip)
---
* 480 caps for a 3 star armor (24 scrip)
---
* 100 caps for a 1 star weapon (5 scrip)
---
* 300 caps for a 2 star weapon (15 scrip)
---
* 800 caps for a 3 star weapon (40 scrip)
---
Did you know Deathclaws mate for life? This is possible because they understand and feel the concept of love, unlike vault dwellers.
---
 Yeah but the Lever Action puts out a lot more bullets/min which is useful to me. The Scorchbeasts have to be shot quite a lot. ;)
---
If you're holding onto 1k steel you need to go seek psychiatric help immediately.  Steel is the easiest scrap you can ever obtain, a single assault rifle with Scrapper turns into 19+ steel.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bh3kl3/psa_stop_bulking_all_of_your_junk_for_the_vast/
---
Steel scrap weighs 0.05lbs, 30 of them weigh 1.5lbs which is equal to it's bulk weight.  The extra 0.1lbs you're accounting for is the weight of the plastic you're burning every time you bulk it.
---
If Star Trek: The Next Generation has taught me anything, it's that no matter how far in the future you go, every historical reference neatly fits into the 20th century.
---
Only when using Pack Rat and only when holding near ridiculous amounts of each.  At base values all unbulked junk is equal in weight to its components, minus the plastic.
---
If you're holding enough junk for the difference in weight to matter when bulked then you are holding on to way too much junk.
---
‚ÄúThis is survival of the fittest, friend. Kill or be killed.‚Äù

r/im14andthisisdeep
---
We‚Äôre even squirt. You spent more time here answering questions I already knew the answer to than it took me to loot a couple of gears/screws. Are you that insecure in your ability that you have to kill people 1/4th your level?
---
agreed but sadly it's a very niche problem so I doubt enough people care :(  
---
Oh well time to start using some other grenades :)
---
I know it would but fine but hey hide behind your keyboard with your petty little insults over some video games, whilst you continually stalk me make sure to let me know if i sink down to your level Mr tough guy.
---
I haven't even managed to get the Longcoat off the vendor bot lol, spent a couple sessions server hopping for it and it burnt me out after a while. Didn't realise he sold clean spacesuit as well though, I should get back on that.
---
Did you kill him
---
 I scraped maybe 40 to get Suppressor. Got Hardened on my second scrap. ;)
---
if you're on ps4 I can give ya coat no charge, for a fellow collector. otherwise, good luck spawning!
---
They probably used google translate
---
I think you mean fallout 76. I tried playing fallout 4 during server downtime.. I logged off after 3 settlement notifications.. can't look back.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 my man but I really do appreciate the offer.
---
also, what's the thing about NPCs? They are literally mindless talking signposts. Robots, holotapes, doesn't matter they fill the same purpose
---
No I couldn‚Äôt. Sheepsquatch did
---
Sure.
---
I've seen several posts recently from people who had their accounts hacked and their character's "robbed" of all items and caps. Maybe this was an intentional change until BGS can implement 2FA?
---
That's what I hate about PvP even more than balance.  It never ends.  I get if you want to take my resources fair-game.  But either I should kill you or you should kill me.  Just respawning and attacking over and over is not realistic at all.  After about 15 minutes of fighting the same person/people over and over I just feel like I'm babysitting someone's kids and leave the server.
---
Game have been launched 8 months ago. Still a strainer of glitches and bugs. Fanboys are laughable..always being devil's advocates. Plus dev team is slow as hell at releasing new content. And no, one new mission /month which adds 2 hours of gameplay is pitful.
---
 Try clicking on Game Options and Create Desktop Shortcut. Puts an icon for 76 on your desktop that starts it directly, well more directly. ;)
---
 The Launcher has updated its self a few times in the last couple of days, so that might be part of it.
---
Haha took me 4hrs to get that part of the challenge done. Lost a lot caps but got my highest kill streak and confidence to pounce on ppl! Black powder and switch to my AA .44 worked pretty good. Any advice on bog quest? I dont think nukes get launched too often in survival?
---
Same. So many events. No plans. üò¢
---
Itll be up in 24 hours they said
---
I am an equal opportunity murderer. Refusing to kill someone based on their level is a form of prejudice. Killing low levels and high levels alike shows how I value everyone equally. All levels matter!
---
I prefer the perspective given by the old Sally Jupiter in Watchmen:  "Every day, the future looks a little bit darker.     But the past...     ...even the grimy parts of it...     ...keep on getting brighter. "
---
just replace 99 with 4 and 117 with 76 and you've got a killer.
---
There's a junk deposit west of the monorail elevator on top of the cliff next to that first support tower thingy. Wolves spawn there but not much of an issue
---
Damn I appreciate the offer but I'm on Xbox, that's proper nice of you though cheers
---
Some notes to try to help:  
---
You can't scrap legendary items, so if the 20 hunting rifles are legendary you would only have the option to 1) Turn in to legendary machine at any train station, 2) Sell to vendor, or 3) Sell to Players
---
What are the MISC items? If they are ore, you can only "Smelt" that via the Chemistry bench i(requires Acid)
---
Anything in the MISC tab can't be scrapped, only items in the Junk tab.
---
Also, perks are important, since I use energy or melee, I used "Batteries Included", with that maxed I am well under 200 lbs. without I am over 400
---
I went to test this and you DO require whisperer. However the camp budget seems to be a bit unreliable. I got back a fair chunk when the mirelurk died, which I then filled up all the way, but was still able to tame a claw.
---

---
I added Pack Rat and Starch Genes. Pretty happy with that as a build.
---
I'm still not 100% on how leveling work, so if I build for this as I level up, how do I acquire the crafting cards?
---
You should also post on r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Ah yeah that should work.
---
What's funny is why wouldn't anyone immediately recycle wood armor anyway?
---
Survival mode is not all about PvP, it's also about survival, which is making better decisions because consequences are harsher, further travel distances in this case.
---
so?
---
If you have never taken a serum for a mutation you already have then you're _really missing out_.
---
Spoilers: You get 1 hour with no negative effects. No HP loss from Adrenal Reaction. No AP loss from Scaly Skin. No need to run Class Freak. It's a great buffer from Herd Mentality if you do some soloing between team ups. Empath is wonderful (but not nearly as nice as it used to be....).
---
Spending more caps than gaining xp going around vendors lol
---
Or give us the ability to lock switches. Especially if I'm controlling switches through a locked terminal.
---
This is about what I pay it's a good chart
---
Honestly I think shes going to be ghoulafied, that way shes not a "human" npc
---
Use the road map feature on the bottom of the page. That will show you what to get and when to get it. Keep in mind some lever you HAVE to get something. Don‚Äôt worry too much if you are 1-4 levels off the finish level at 51 and up you can move special points around to tailor the build better.
---
To be fair, when have you ever been able to see the health of your player opponent in any FPS? It's a redic that we can.
---
We forgot about patch day they said
---
5+ more items per person.  I'm all for it but I don't think they would be.
---
My understanding is that Assaultron Heads that are 3\* from the Purveyor will remain 3\* upon relog. You can still get 3\* from her as well.
---
Sorry I just got a lot of pycological shit going on
---
Thanks for confirming!
---
Yes !!   So much yes to chicken coops.
---
You're right. They had them on ultra rare rotation, though. When they did the "All Vendors All Plans" stuff everything changed.
---
SBQ even dropped a couple for me and I can't even get Plasma Grenade plans so.... there wasn't that much luck involved.
---
no worries. keep surviving.. in style!
---
That‚Äôs kind of my point. When did raiding become destroying. I can just here them. Down in there parents basement  one says I‚Äôm hungry let‚Äôs raid the refrigerator then they all say yeah grab your All Rise.
---
And you're a little wuss who doesn't want your ass kicked lol
---
If you'e going to be obtuse, you get homework!

https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/rick_schaut/2004/05/19/anatomy-of-a-software-bug/
---
Go read that.  It's long.  LONG.  You were warned.  But do read it, then think about your comments.
---
/u/Twistedfexer is absolutely correct, there is WAY more to what you're talking about than you understand.  The article above will give you a taste of that.  And that's about a much MUCH simpler piece of software MANY years ago.  It hasn't gotten easier.
---
here's how I do it. I go once a week because I usually have enough lead to make over 8k bullets for my Gatling gun ( my preferred PVE weapon) and 3-4k for my 10mm SMG. Steel and acid are easy to find. To get lead though:
---
head to lucky hole mine in your excavator. Explore and tap all those nodes that look like chocolate chip grey dough. They are either lead or Crystal. Explore the whole thing. When you get to 258 lead Ore you will have mostly all in the mine.  This takes roughly 15-30 minutes. Head to your camp/workshop and start smelting. You will be able to break that down into more lead than you have ever seen. I usually run out of acid so I take the workshops : bog town, hemlock holes or just claim an acid node and move my camp. Once you have used the acid and smelted it all down move to your tinker bench. Using the perk "SUPER DUPER" &amp; "AMMO SMITH"  you can spam whatever bullets you lack. You will probably run out of steel but that is how you make enough bullets to not have to worry about ammo for over a week of playing every day. 
---
if you use Shotguns or something requiring more than steel, gunpowder, and lead...
---
I dunno what to tell you cause I don't need anything more than that. Good luck!
---
You better not take any workshops and sleep with one eye open...
---
They just need to make something that's like the opposite of insect repellant. "Eau de Scorched - spraying this on your body will attract all nearby enemies for 10 minutes." Crafted using 2x rhododendron, vodka, and a scorched head in a jar.
---
Survival mode's clear purpose is pvp, everyone I know who plays it does it only for pvp and it was introduced with the removal of slap damage. I don't think there are many if any people who play for the challenge (people who want to not fast travel but not pvp can do that without risking PVP) or 20% xp bonus (xp making is more efficient with fast travel than +20% anyway)
---
See mate? Thats the the point. You run a shop what you consider deserve the name decent but that does not mean someone else has the same opinion. Plain and simple.
---
I get your point saying "level 100+ shall not sell plain weapons and such..." but - what about low level to mid level which are starting to get into the game? They also should have the option to buy decent weapons and gear from traders.
---
But to call them **"embarrassing"** is just short sight.
---
Thats like you were a butcher and call all baker useless because they sell no meat. 
---
Friendly reminder - and i mean really friendly - take two steps back, look at the "bigger picture" and just think about it. All in all you can have your opinion but you are not alone in this game mate.
---
We will take all you have, and there will be no resistance.
---
Just a suggestion. Try not fast traveling to it. Fast travel to a location close then run there and try to enter.
---
With the arktos event, if you fast travel to the event... Many people are experiencing crashes but if they fast travel to a town close by then run there, they have no problem entering the elevator without crashing.
---
Just an idea but may be the same thing. Travel close the run the rest of the way. See if that helps. May be an issue with the world not completely rendering before you try to open a door in that part of the world.
---
Again, just a suggestion to try.
---
We can accuse them of a lot of things, but slow updates isn't one of them. And even suggesting that there's two missions indicates you haven't sent much time with it - since there's over twenty in the 'season'. It also undersells the significance of other additions, big (vending, brewing) and small (camera, bulldozer).
---
You don't have to like it. you have lots of reasons to be upset... but ideally your ire would be focused on issues that are actually there.
---
What do you want for the mask?
---
100% my man
---
If you stick around you can save his Brahmin from the Sheepsquatch
---
Excavator. Not saying it doesn't work well, power armor is great at what it does. I just hate being slow, needing fusion cores, the enter/exit animation
---
I wouldn't recommend doing this. It may be possible for someone to release a mod that steals your unencrypted login info, your Bethesda account, and any other account that uses the same password.
---
The "new" name doesn't alter your friends list or blocked lists.  Way before this fix, I had Bethesda change my username so that it didn't include essentially my IRL name/email. Most of my friends didn't even notice. My whole list stayed intact. So if you block "spammingjackass209" and it changes it's name to "niceguyLOL", you will still have that idjut blocked...   
---
On the other hand, I see your point if it's just a personal "look out for" list, as opposed to in game blocked. I keep a little sticky note of all the names of players I've PVP'd against. It might get them closer to me than I'd prefer if they changed names...
---
Great stealth armor.
---
Normally I see deer in game and I charge them for their meat and hides, haha.
---
But this time I was already over-encumbered and loaded with food. Spotted them from a ways away and since the surrounding area was so quiet and calm and picturesque, I wanted to just keep with that.
---
that would be amazing, no, it would be super duper
---
This is what I have felt all along, the difference is I can accept when robots act repetitive and mindless because, you know, thier robots.
---
Repairing isn't too expensive, sometimes you just gotta weigh the costs
---
Hilarious! You sir...are a god!
---
True.
---
Old bonus used to be +100% damage for the rank 5 demolitionist card, now rank 5 gives +60%
---
Hey guys, I have an idea that‚Äôs been posted on a daily basis for weeks!
---
Simple. No company should cater to and butcher their own art because some people don't like it.
---
Yeah, you can get the recipe from the new event. I believe its only effect is it slightly raises your accuracy or something. But the lore of it states that a side effect is that all nearby animals will become aggressive towards whoever takes it.
---
I actually got exactly that yesterday from the purveyor, along with a quad explosive combat shotgun in the same session haha.
---
Oh I did I was getting my camera ready and in the background the sheepsqaytch shot from the ground. If only i could have more then 50 photos in my album, a bummer time to find out i was at max.
---
I enjoy running around in a more ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù mode rather than just PvP....  the killing people part is just icing on the cake.
---
Yo I hear ya, and I specified I'm not talking about beginners, I get that they only got what they can get. Also not saying don't sell any common stuff, just not ONLY common stuff.
---
you shop like i drive to work
---
Arguing for non invincible defences...
---
Just listened to your first episode and it's brilliant. :) I picked [Anchor.fm](https://Anchor.fm) for my podcast as well if you want to check it out. It's a dark humor radio drama style story.  [https://anchor.fm/fallout76podcast](https://anchor.fm/fallout76podcast)
---
Yeah, it's aight
---
Oh boy, nuclear winter spoilers - you get to launch the nukes to start off some kind of winter server-state
---
inb4 this is actually true
---
You're on your way to full dump truck RP then. The Camden park responder vendor is where I found both of mine but I've heard you can also get them in Watoga and Harper's ferry.
---
The influx of more 3* legendary items has drastically reduced the market for 1*-2* items. I have had dedicated vendor characters for quite a while and sales for other than 3* stuff is flat, so I have begun liquidating stock via the Muncher, but at 300 Scrip per day (using 2 characters) it will take a long time, specially considering you can easily gather the 150 in a couple hours of play.
---
Oh, don't take it so damn personal. Ill destroy a base and not remember 30 minutes later.
---
Awesome! Thank you so much for this.
---
Do shotgun based perks work with the Tesla shotgun? I've asked a few people but nobody could give me a solid answer since they hadn't used one before.
---
Out of all that story that's what you got?
---
Nothing for the Free States or all of the soldiers that weren't loyal to Eckhart or the shift the Brotherhood has taken in/since 4 and the holos of what remained of BoS in Appalachia.....
---
Nevermind. I see someone wants to pay Darwin a due. ;)
---
There are some bugs in past games they have found/reported early in their games releases and still have never been addressed. I don't mind honestly though, just as long as they fix the real bad ones.
---
And your argument makes it sound like you think alot of games simply should not exist, games where you absolutely wreck other peoples progress, and are encouraged to do so.
---
times like that I wish we could take i dump in there paper bag and light it on fire
---
Stop telling people what to do
---
Its so disheartening
---
How about those Owlets we can put on our walls? And yet... no living ones. :(
---
It's doing the very limited raider activity we could to begin with. It's a way to provoke someone you want to fight, there are numerous reasons, also it's Fallout and it's FUN.
---
Dang, that explains it, thought it was power attacking for awhile, but lately havn't had to as much so my chewing thru cores wasn't adding up. Very helpful.
---
It was in patch notes posted by bethesda they didnt remove them from spawning very long but they stopped them from dropping together on a weapon for a bit you could only find either or.. then brought it back on everything except for non ballistic items.
---
I just love killin'.
---
I mean you've played the game. You still have to run in fullscreen on PC or it hard-caps your fps to 31.
---
As everything with Bethesda; take your initial expectations then lower them 30%
---
I have never tried. I‚Äôll give it a shot tonight.
---
Hurt someone psychologically? Jesus, are you all a bunch of traumatized individuals, who can't distinguish fantasy and reality?
---
hoard less..
---
if they were separate people will just use them as more stash..
---
what we need is a 200lb account wide mailbox...
---
It says I still haven't discovered grafton dam. I definitely understand this post 1st hand.
---
People were arguing for CAMP destruction removal, and PvP removal all together before survival even came out.
---
The fact that it was CHANGED shows that it was intended to have PvP, and possibly hostile interaction on adventure mode.
---
Nothing is made harder in the current survival besides fast travel and pvp.
---
It even kinda irks me too that the survival mode was made for just pvp because if a survival mode with more increased difficulty and more rewards I would prefer to play that.
---
My Fallout 76 podcast has now been picked up by Spotify, iTunes and Stitcher. If you love podcasts like I do...or don't like them at all, give a listen. I wanted to make it as entertaining and engaging as possible. [https://anchor.fm/fallout76podcast](https://anchor.fm/fallout76podcast) :)
---
Two things:
---
A - That assumes that the two things are equally easy to fix. Plunging in a new quest from a tool-kit is likely a lot easier than finding and fixing something like the wood-armour bug.
---
B - It's unlikely that the content teams are the teams working on the bugs. The guys designing the new game mode likely don't have much to do with core issues like where you spawn in the main game or the system which is demoting wood armor.
---
I never have a problem having enough thing to scrip. I normally sell the crappy 1* stuff I have left over for 60 caps or so.
---
It's almost like those are two different things entirely, and the folk designing a new hat might not be much use in tracking down coding issues.
---
is that now allowed to be hugh-man?
---
The "no human NPCs" thing has to end eventually, it's a massive spoiler for every single quest where you work with someone that *might* be alive.
---
And also some people are so self conscious, and insecure that they take it personal, and say someone has mental issues for doing you harm in a GAME.
---
Since it's related, now would be a good time to remind everyone that our BGS accounts still have *zero* form of 2FA. Something which is standard even on small platforms.
---
You probably checked, but are you sure it needs repair?  Is it below 100% condition?
---
Does it show up in the modify mode?
---
I'm an asshole.
---
Honestly they could fix this by adding a star next to the player camp if they have legendary items.
---
I can see the rage induced posts now...
---
"Damb Argos are ruining my grinds/nuke zones"
---
Edit: Try turning radio/pip boy light on, it feels like it helps.
---
just one of the many stupid things in WV, found this one out last week trying to make brain bombs someone said you used to be able to keep the in your inventory till they got rads but Bethesda "FIXED'' that.....
---
"Bethesda fucked up more shit", "Water is wet", "Sky is blue"...
---
Not so much news as it is more a daily reminder.  
---
Fallout 76: the true apocalypse is Bethesda's miss-management of the game..
---
What was the comment? Root deleted
---
Yes, it doesn‚Äôt show in modify mode. It‚Äôs at about 5% durability. Even weapons with 100% durability appear, even if they can‚Äôt be modded.
---
so close, and yet so far away
---
As a sniper stealth player that plays with a Power Armor tank hubby.... I endorse this and wish there was something to make duoing or team play better and for some build diversity. Let us keep stealth even in teams, let other ppl draw aggro for being loud and big threats... something.
---
Well call me a sadist then, I enjoy it thoroughly. Its a game where you need to defend your shit. If you can't then guess what? It gets taken/destroyed. I'm a normal person in real life, and that's just it. In Fallout, you can roleplay something else, you can be whoever you want, and if I want to keep the wasteland dangerous, who's to stop me? 
---
Does enjoying GTA make you a gangster? Does playing a game like Manhunt make you a sadist?
---
While I haven‚Äôt tried to sell totally broken equipment, I don‚Äôt bother repairing items because they might not sell. Usually you can repair it yourself.
---
there are 3 boxes on top of the church in flatwoods that is not the point
---
Depends. I don‚Äôt think repair costs change, whether it‚Äôs at 0% or 99% (someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, please). 
---
I tend to full (200%) repair my weapons &amp; armor before putting them in my vendor, as a customer courtesy.
---
who needs an explosive gun? Any number of guns with no explosive affixes can be devastating if you have the right perks.
---
yep, that's why i'd like it to lock you in an animation and it would last a short time with a long cooldown, this way you can use it well for protecting players but not so well to annoy people
---
Well I'll be sure to get those thanks for the tip
---
I‚Äôve been calling people in excavator armor ‚ÄúBumblebees‚Äù affectionately since launch. To the point where I tend to go out of my way to be helpful to any bumblebees because the name is cute.
---
As I've said elsewhere, the content team and the systems/platform/tools team are likely not at all the same people. The person using a pre-packaged toolkit to make a quest or the guy designing a hat aren't going to be any help tracking down the coding issue that causes wood armour to loose a star.
---
Think of the guys making content as people making the quests as players building a CAMP. When a error message pops up the CAMP builder can work around it, but at the end of the day the fix has to come from Beth. I'n the same way, content builders can work around known bugs, but they have little control over the toolset.
---
Did the mine.. Wow.  I don't have stash space to store all this lead. I don't have the super duper card yet but still came out with 750 lead after smelting.  Glad I've been collecting acid with no idea what to do with it.  I wish there was a plastic mine. I love my 224 damage double shot shotgun with extra damage to super mutants.  Thanks dudes. üòÅüòÅüòÅ
---
I'll bet you never let your kids play GTA huh?
---
PC silly, mods
---
Just bring back the slap damage. They'll be dead in two minutes instead of three.
---
Hi, will this fix all the accidentally-reverting 3 Star gear such as wood as well?
---
I agree with you. If you are selling something for alot of caps that item better be full or almost full condition. Its not even high demand stuff either. Its crap legendarys.
---
And everything is supposed to be daisies and lollipops
---
Yeah I know that feeling all too well
---
Could balance it abit, just mire so poking fun at ppls fear of change.
---
Nah you got me wrong there. I'm not talking about beginners as a trader, i mean beginners as customers.
---
If a high level raise a shop with focus on mid to low level players that's kind of their target group and in that level range it's not neccessary to sell high level weapons/legendarys because - first there is no need at a certain level range and second - they can't afford it anyways except mules maybe.
---
To be fair i can understand when it's frustrating not get what you have in mind when visit other vendors.
---
But instead of trash folks because they don't offer what you demand/hope for think about others, which are glad about these offers and head to the next shopping destination.
---
indeed, they thought we would all be generalist but in reality most of us are very specialized and that is good for the game imo
---
We likely won't see her until the Wastelanders DLC. Or at least that's the feeling.
---
How about double stash space weekends...
---
It's not much, but a decent way to "raid" others, just melt any legendary in events etc, before anybody else gets there, we can still "steal" their legendary rolls!
---
... did I miss double xp weekend?
---
This can be really bad if the decontamination shower is in the way of the vendor machines. I‚Äôve lost mutations from accidentally going through those showers.
---
that's human nature at its worst, sadly. but i have to try your suggestion of lights and radio on, every little bit helps
---
Well i have charisma of three so its impossible for me to have both animal friend and wasteland whisperer.
---
If you want to pacify it you need wasteland whisperer, but to tame one you just need animal friend.
---
You cannot tame with wasteland whisperer
---
The EVENTS need protection from a NUKE? That's the opposite my friend, the nuke has no restrictions on who's day it's going to fuck up, that's the point of a nuke lol
---
Please throw in the MIRV Frag, too. The grenades instantly explode and never spread out like they should.
---
where did you get the head sock thing from? I want one
---
I just stress about.missing perks etc. I don't want to miss out on any crafting perks.  
---
In regards to the roadmap, what does it mean when it says '+9 from previous level'?  And at level 3 it says luck goes up by 1, and at level 4 charisma and luck increase by 1.
---
Sorry for being a pain in the ass.
---
Oh I keep the decontamination shower a safe distance from the vending.
---
Just an FYI Explosive Tesla's are terrible as the explosive effect overrides the arching effect which is where most of the damage from the weapon comes from. Unless you want it just to have it its a worthless piece of junk.
---
Edit: Explosive Cryolators aren't good either, freaking thing did zero damage even when Demolition Expert and Explosive Legendary effect weren't nerfed, I've had a FE one before they got rid of Explosive on Energy weapons and I just dropped the thing on the floor after using it for like 2 minutes.
---
Why you gotta player hate? Let us Hussle if we wanna. It sounds like you were upset because something him wanted was priced unreasonable. Hope you start whatever enough you hope to achieve and it spreads like a wave. I've got far too many caps and nothing to buy.
---
Very cool, thanks for responding!
---
Damn that fucking stinks man. Yeah I‚Äôm all in favor for 2FA.
---
It just works!
---
So I have a collection of mutations, could I then take one of each to negate the negatives or is it like most drugs one only at a time, so I would have to choose the negative I want removed for an hour?
---
Sounds like I'm missing out but looks complicated.
---
Obviously a good deal of my post is salt, but like u said, it's abit frustrating to have only found these low lvl stores over the past few days.
---
A - No, and 'if' statement wouldn't work. I am surprised they haven't just excluded wooden armour from the legendary pool though.
---
B - it's highly unlikely that the Nuclear Winter team and the system/toolset team are the same people.
---
Honestly that's precisely what I thought, like Top of the World's little trading/market place is so stupidly empty and barren. It feels like there should be something there, but nah. Just some handies and that's pretty much it.
---
My understanding, of what my friend who completed it says, is you've gotta not just find all the holo tapes. You have to go back and visit all the holo locations in order and listen to those holo tapes completely. There is info on the tapes that give additional direction to help complete it. 
---
I haven't gone back and tried it yet though. Maybe one day I'll try it. Not too important to me right now. Doing dlc stuff.
---
And they don‚Äôt even bother lowering the price. I think they hope you will just buy the item without watching.
---
I have not bought armor from the Purveyor yet for this very reason.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bigeay/meta_trading_posts_are_no_longer_allowed_on_rfo76/
---
Haha good to know
---
I can see your point, but there would need to be a cap for all the vending machines, not per machine. And unless this cap equaled the current stash limit, then those players that use multiple vendors and use almost all of their stash capacity for vending, that would impair their current playstyle.
---
It need you‚Äôll have perk cards you can get at that point. As you can normally get one card per level you‚Äôll have some saved up. Meaning some levels you‚Äôll get 2-4 extra for saving. 
---
You‚Äôll saving points and point skipping at times to get the min/max he build. That‚Äôs why I said you may be 1-4 levels off but it works pretty well to keep you on track.
---
Thanks for saving me some valuable badges.
---
Do you have a trusted friend that you an trade it to and see if they‚Äôre able to repair it?
---
Lvl35 two shot 50 cal but I‚Äôm in ps4
---
yes, it does. That rifle with an automatic piston, long barrel, and Long recon is the mother fucking truth! It really wipes out anything if you have the vats and crits.
---
Has it? I haven‚Äôt seen any of this. I‚Äôve seen the ‚ÄúPut _______ as a server wide message‚Äù post, but never one like this. I don‚Äôt search by new, however, so I could be mistaken
---
Oh dude, excavator is basically like using civilian grade equipment for war.
---
Get a suit of T-51b with reactive plates, plus three ranks of blocker and dodgy perks and tank anything you like.  I can eat 3-4 shots from the Sheepsquatch in Project Paradise with a tesla coiled torso, keep it's aggro with the zap effect of the tesla torso and normal attacks, and use stimpaks between hits with minimal "oh shit spam stims" moments.
---
I think the single greatest feature of power armor is the ability to spam yourself with healing items.  There's an animation of injecting yourself with a stim outside of power armor, but inside a suit you can eat 3-4 stims one after the other.
---
For moving quickly, I either use two ranks of Squad Maneuvers while in a team, or swap to my backup pistol with two ranks of Gun Runner when solo, then swap back to my anti-armor super sledge when I'm in melee range of future dead things.  Either way, I'm moving 20% faster and can overtake non-PA friends that aren't sprinting.
---
I use a pistol as a back-up ranged option for several reasons.  They're not premium ranged DPS, but they're light, the gun runner perk exists, the ammo is often thrown away by other players, and you can get God-roll versions for a song and dance.  I was using an instigating/FFR/reload western revolver for a long time, which I bought at a Whitespring vendor for a couple hundred caps, then recently acquired a Vampire/Explosive/Vats Crit 10mm from the purveyor.  The revolver hits a lot harder, but the vampire and explosive aspects of the 10mm make it better for shooting at scorchbeasts with hipfire and anti-armor automatic pistol mods while soaking up damage, as well as trying to land some damage on distant legendary enemies without needing to aim very well.
---
without vats that recoil is ridiculous
---
No i said accounts(gt‚Äôs). You dont have to buy a new copy for every gt. First off people do have hard copies. And second you dont have to have hard copy to play on other accounts. You can set you xbox as home for your main gt that pays for the games. So what this allows you to do is make new gts. Whatever new gts you create on that xbox now automatically get xbox gold live and they also get access to whatever games your main gt has purchased. So now say one of those gts gets banned you can just delete and boom create another one completely free able to play fallout
---
Honestly I prefer the exploits get fixed first..there are still way too many half assed players who float around lvl 70 who just had multiple god tier weapons duplicated for them and all they do now is troll when they log in..because they exploited the game early on to have all the weapons they should currently be farming for like every other normal player. I can‚Äôt stand how there is literally a black market to spend real money on these in game weapons, that‚Äôs literally pathetic imo. What is the point of even playing at that point?
---
Unfortunately not at the moment. Maybe later or tomorrow they‚Äôll be online though. Until then I suppose I can use a different weapon.
---
Why, and Survival or Adventure?
---
People have put real time, real care, real thought, into their creations. Consider their CAMP their art. I'm not sure you're "aware" enough to get this, but let's look at a real world equivalent. I make a painting. I think it's beautiful. You come along and splash paint all over it and yell "Haha this is FUN!" 
---
What would you expect my reaction to be?
---
Do you realize you're childish yet?
---
And I'm not even saying this as someone who is that type of person. My camps are mostly functional. 
---
I'm saying the ONLY point to CAMP destruction right now is to try to create an emotional response in another player. And not a positive one.
---
No problem. Glad it helped.
---
One Adrenal Reaction Serum removes the negatives of one Adrenal Reaction Mutation for one hour.
---
If you wanted to clear all the negatives of every mutation you have you need a matching serum for each one.
---
The most obvious one is probably Herd Mentality. +2 to all stats while on a team, -2 while solo. But what if you wanted to play solo for an hour or two? Down a serum (or two). No need to play RadAway Roulette. You can also see how this might work if you wanted to play with a Gauss rifle for a day or so but didn't want to wipe Grounded, etc.
---
Never noticed a problem, but I never use VATS.
---
run away from it a good distance or fast travel nearby and then approach the site from different angles. i‚Äôve had to do this with a few locations.
---
It wasn‚Äôt an insult, sorry if you took it personally.
---
They just plain cannot stop them. That is the problem
---
Interesting, sounds like an entire game all by itself.
---
Mutant 76
---
Best of luck, man. I hope it ‚Äòun-glitches‚Äô for you soon. 
---
I‚Äôd be quite annoyed if my trusty All Rose has that issue.
---
Its not a 50 cal but I do have a 1\* Two Shot Gatling, lvl 50.
---
If your interested its yours for 3K
---
Ya that's totally legit, other than snark legendary bot,  I always throw down on magazines for challenges sake. And Bobbleheads can be pretty useful when applied correctly so sometimes I buy those. I'm talking about just common "can find it free anywhere/anytime" stuff when I say garbage.
---
For sure. Events are crawling with people who might take your junk.
---
Non legendary ghouls don't drop legendary items. Diseased prefix overrides the show of the legendary prefix but they are still legendary.
---
Damn I just sold my TSE for 14k and a marsupial serum. Just out of curiosity how much would you have paid for one? Third line was just +1 agility
---
When you see people doing the exploit you can tell what's wrong because of the specific thing they do for it to work
---
Bugs are harder because they can happen randomly and it's hard to find the source
---
Give them some time they'll work it out
---
Change the challenges back to what before the camera mode was put in till they can get the bugs worked out... I dont mind 1 camera challenge everyday but not 3
---
I think I have several different ones. I think I have Flaming, electrified
---
125ish
---
Thanks. I will. Do you want to join us?
---
Have you clicked/tried to use the Charlie Silo elevator?
---
If it's intentional then it is creating a security risk, as people are more likely to choose a weak password if they are forced to enter it every time they interact with Bethesda Launcher.
---
And no 2FA (two factor authentication)... this is 2019 ?!
---
This 100%
---
I've made over 20k selling ammo, plans and clothes so your opinion doesn't matter.
---
I tried your idea but the item says cant be placed because it's floating. I will try again later though.
---
Furious, explosive, two shot, mutants +10% while aiming Gatling plasma.
---
Your idea seems to have worked out just fine. Thank you üòä.
---
It seems like alot of investment to use it I'm too lazy but I would like a nice set of t51b
---
Ps4 or I would
---
Just want to earn my possum badges. Bunch of those still wont complete.
---
.... White Wolf Fedora is rare? I have like 3.
---
but beware if whatever is broken is usable as an exploit...then Bugthesda will fix it the second somebody notices it (just like the patch today) but other (sometimes game-breaking) bugs? nnaaa....They have time....
---
What is your game tag?
---
The free states tried to do good but in the end people would rather save their own hides then fight the good fight together, plus just cause we seeing small groups of scorched here now, perhaps when the brotherhood fell they had alot more on the plate then we are lead to believe.  Maybe the brotherhood was good but they done died fighting the good fight, maybe brotherhood 2.0 will be better depending on if they can find a leader worthy
---
I laugh any time I see the word "survivors" appear. There are no survivors.
---
Yeah I launched a nuke XD.
---
You missed the other threads about it.
---
uncommon, but yes. Most folks are too soft or inexperienced to finish that event effectively. I have like 5 in my store for 100c each only things I've gotten worth a crap from that robotic dingus
---
Will do. Thanks.
---
I got the same thing. Place it on the ground outside of base first. Not on any floor or foundation. Then move where you want it.
---
I totally agree- I try to do this too! It just feels like being a good shopkeeper. :)
---
If you need concrete there's normally 4 or 5 bags in a workshed at Kanawha County Cemetary. Its near the back behind the graves. It's normally a good source now and then.
---
Nonsense. I wouldn‚Äôt play them, but if people enjoy them, they should absolutely exist. The difference is that in those games, everyone is a willing participant. That‚Äôs just not the case in Fallout 76.
---
My Dad and high school coach taught me that if I'm going to do something, do it right.  A great lesson for adulthood.  I initially use excavator armor for the carry weight, thought it felt "not acceptable" for combat, did 2 minutes of research online, started collecting a lvl 50 T-51b full suit and never looked back.  I remember the lvl 50 right leg took a LONG time to find without someone to craft it for me.  I was still tanking the entire whitespring golf club mob in the parking lot at lvl 60-70 for everyone else to shoot at will, even with a half-assed variety of lvl 30-50 pieces on the frame.  T-51b with tesla coils is outrageous during a whitespring nuke.  I've probably been using the same lvl 50 coiled torso since before last Christmas.  Walk by any enemy and it immediately hates you and can barely hurt you, unless it's a major event boss or legendary radscorpion with insane poison damage.
---
If you're on PC, I'm happy to check the spots where T series armor spawns and help you build a suit.  Trust me, I know them all while spending a month or more hunting for a lvl 50 leg.
---
Thanks, I couldn't remember if they nerfed the base damage or toned down the perk card.
---
There's an idea.
---
Will have a walk over tomorrow, thanks for the info :) just hope there are no mutants over there, seem to be getting my ass kicked by them a lot recently üòÇ
---
In uranium fever event zone, three more.
---
What is the attraction? I looked at it but why would I want one. Makes the guy look down on his luck among other things. I like the Duster I bought from the Atom Store better, but I only wear it for PvP as its good cammo.
---
 I have been rocking T-Shirt and Slacks for most of my 96 levels. Just picked up a Wolf Fedora for 15 caps at some guys place. Replaces the Trilby. ;)
---
Just leave a toilet paper roll and some fertilizer in their bag. They'll get the message. Saw a guy do that the other day, haven't laughed that hard in a while
---
Nah its usually just a few low level molerats or bloodbugs. It's an easy pick up.
---
The Tadpole quest is still broken for most people. Wish that I can tell a Bethesda Dev the exact problem instead of a bot.
---
It's always prime time somewhere and 99% of game maintenance is during Aussie Prime Time. I suppose this means you'll just have to take the advice that we have suffered from for 20 years.
---
Suck it up, go enjoy life for a while
---
But fusion cores in this game are SO easy to get.
---
Pro tip: at the start of a play session, claim any power plant. Equip the contractor perk, build a fusion generator, hook it up to a fusion core processor, hang around until the first defend event starts, kill everything that moves. By then, you'll likely have a brand new fusion core. Leave, grab the fusion core out if the dead sentry bot near RobCo, and the power generator behind WestTek. Maybe go to White Springs and shoot up some more sentry bots.  Pop back in at the power plant every 30 minutes or so. You'll have more fusion cores after an hour play session than you'll know what to do with.
---
Unless you also play with a Gatling laser, in which case, I can't help you. Nobody can help you.
---
So not like the death claw hidden underground near the nuclear waste disposal site
---
I also do heart emoji for a while at the vendor and make sure to have Miner Suit Scrap on me. Purveyor digs that.
---
Agreed!
---
Nah you'll see. This one's such an easy source. It's in a low level area afterall.
---
I'm not saying everything needs to be like God tier stuff, or even close. What your doing makes sense, because it's useful. I'm talking about shops crammed with the drops from random enemies (common guns/armor) and common clothing mostly.
---
I hear it but they don't seem to run away anymore.
---
The last thing this game needs is another inventory management component. Just increase the main stash and call it a day.
---
Seems like a lot of unnecessary work on their end when you can just rename it?
---
Or just FACTIONS.
---
Idk about you but I‚Äôd much rather their resources go towards something more important.
---
Technically every group (even Eckhart) tried to do _what they thought_ was good.
---
For Free States and Brotherhood the actual moral (as also shoehorned down your throat by the Overseer) of the story was literally the opposite of your conclusion. They could have stopped the scorched had they taken a moment to build trust with each other. Even the Enclave could have reversed the course of the scorched, and maybe MODUS might've spared a few, had they taken any time to build some trust.
---
It would not be Kumbaya Hippy Utopia by any means - humanity will never stop inventing conflict. There would still be raiders. There just wouldn't be any Scorched.... so even Raiders would have a better chance of surviving....
---
Every month needs a double xp Weekend. Like BF2
---
I know, right? Pot, meet kettle...
---
We are actually working on something like that. (Not Lib. Prime however.) Gonna do a territory control thing, like Risk. And, we will check legendaries at the door, so it‚Äôs a (mostly) level playing field.
---
The last double XP 3 day weekend I went up like 26 levels lol , I was thrashed after that lol :) I wish Beth would just leave the double XP on..
---
 There are Cave Crickets at Tanagra Town, down in the tree.
---
Heh, I know that feeling. It‚Äôs why I sold Salt at my Squatch Stop.
---
Its completely doable ark allowed you too take pics and use them as paintings so I dont see why they couldnt
---
Onepompousa55.  I'll check what I have when I get home
---
Can you tell me why T51 is better at tanking than say X-01? Is it that the tesla coils are only available for t51 or something else im missing?
---
Such a shame when redditors don't understand basic business principles.
---
They need to hire you if you can go through a dense web of code that spans a decade of work and solve the issue in one month.
---
I agree. If you don‚Äôt gear yourself for PvP, it won‚Äôt work. I just wish it didn‚Äôt require legendaries to really be able to get into it, but whatever.
---
Most days I have more than enough and end up with leftovers, but some days I only have an hour or so to play and I can't always find enough legendary items in that time to max out the scrip machine. Days like that I'll pop around to all the player vendors and a couple of popular robo vendors (whitesprings mainly) and seek out cheep legendary items to scrip.
---
I would so play whack a mole in uranium fever with that.
---
elusive\*
---
Just get the stalker outfit from atom store it‚Äôs better looking and can‚Äôt be duplicated
---
I get what your saying, and clearly I'm salty, but my shop hopping adventures have been mostly dissapointing unfortunatly.
---
I randomly got the back pack mod.  And the event didnt inform me I did.  Check the armor bench  :)
---
Best of luck?
---
I prefer to not waste my perk points on charisma tbh, unless if I‚Äôm dedicated into a charisma/medic group build.
---
Finally, naming your player can now be relevant.
---
Fireproof is kind of a solid perk for any build. I used to get absolutely wrecked by the sonic boats from scorchbeasts, which is almost entirely explosive damage. Three points in fireproof, and now they don't even scratch me. Drop a grenade too close to my feet, set off a chain reaction of cars? No worries.
---
My base is far off from the schorbeast fissure I checked, scorchbeasts only spawn if you walk right on top of the fissure or get close enough to pick that loot in the area I'm sperated by a landmark, and i'm at the bottom of a cliff. If you want to compare the distance from the pumpkin house to the fissure site I'm at least 5 times that distance
---
LoL I usually run power armor, DCG and meathooks are absolutely worthless to me. I don't run that bloodied glass cannon gimmick bullshit either.
---
Aww did the mean raider take your adhesive?
---
At least you get a respawn point so many times I had to close the game because I had no respawn point not even vault 76.
---
Any suggestions on where to check as far as vendors? I've been to a handful today and came up empty handed
---
sorry to hear you got ganked...
---
No it still falls under the rifle catagory.
---
I‚Äôve noticed that too! At least 2-3 weeks now. No more chasing down 2 and 3*** Legendary Mutants either. ‚ÄúRetreat! Retreat! Runaway Runaway!‚Äù In Mutant voice was pretty entertaining though.
---
yes.. all the yesses...
---
X01 trades physical resistance for energy resistance.
---
Guess which is currently more useful.
---
Im interested!
---
IP bans are a thing and are used as well as they could also ban the unique product code meaning they'd have to buy a new game.
---
Legendaries abound nowadays my friend, easily available on the trading subs and some in game vendors. If you make a focused effort to get good shit, you will within a week or two most likely, just have caps.
---
I think I have a vailed point wether it happened to me or not.
---
Microsoft said they would not do that because it opens them up for lawsuits on the fact that they arent breaking Microsoft rules. Just abusing bad coding
---
Oh ya I should do that too. Have you tried carrying s mole miner gauntlet with you while trading ?
---
Adventure mode already prevents you from being killed unless you return fire or take a workshop. Why do we need a cap too?
---
Adding a cap would just make players take advantage of the cap limit with an alternate character for farming.
---
I understand it's hard for sociopaths to understand this, but your enjoyment is not the only thing that matters. 
---
You enjoying killing me is not more important than my enjoyment of  the game as a whole. And if sociopathic assholes are allowed to have their fun, no one else will have ANY fun.
---
No they aren't. My first playthrough completed the quest. Second did not.
---
Small glitch that seems to make it think you don't have speed demon when exit or enter power armor. It's easily fixed(at least for more) when I swap weapons.
---
And the difference between that and real life is you can repair your camp with one button press, ignore the materials even, if you move it and place it. 
---
I'm pretty sure you're the one who's not "aware" here, as you cannot seem to distinguish video games from real life.
---
Of course it was an insult, that's the whole reason why you're here, to pick your poxy little fight over some video games whilst hidden behind your keyboard, real tough guy lmao
---
I held my own... No i didnt but i got all 3 of them with a marksmen rifle and my lowly somerset .44! You can do it friend. The sneaky boost is op. Plus i domed the first guy and he droped to maybe 10% health.
---
They were lvl 70+ I was 21. Get your revenge!
---
Pacifist mode is a thing.
---
Dont take a workshop if you cant handle being killed now and then
---
that's my point, it hardly matters *because* of the bloodied and sneak mechanics. without them, god rolls would definitely matter, even in pve.
---
it's just something to keep in mind because a)it's not good game design and b)we're screwed if they ever nerf either of them.
---
Rnd unfortunately
---
There also a whole bunch of bags of concrete at Blackwater Mine. It's been a while since I went hunting for it, but I think there's a couple bags in the big exterior building with the tinker bench, there's a couple in the area right inside the doors to the mine, and there's 3 bags on the floor near Uranium extractor Charlie.
---
I don‚Äôt believe so. I wish this game actually had little hidden RNG buffs like this, but pretty sure the devs have bigger fish to fry.
---
I just don't run bloodied at all, more a full health kind of guy
---
That's a bummer, but thanks for the reply!
---
Those unwilling participants, should not be participating in the first place lol. If you can't take the heat, don't play the game. Games are not always designed to cater to every individual. Take the Soulsborne series for instance. Try complaining to From Soft about how a "griefer" murdered you on the way to a boss fight that's taken you days to get to, try complaining that bosses are too hard to beat, or the games are unfair. 
---
That's how ridiculous this is, you argue for it simply because you like Fallout. Well maybe not so much if you can't handle an integral part of the series, RAIDERS.
---
except that makes absolutely no sense? there are several reasons why duping is bad but that's definitely not of them.
---
an op item is op regardless of duping. except without duping, that 1 dude is gonna make the other 29 miserable because he has a massive advantage.
---
after level 52 there is no gain from leveling up
---
Yeah. Exactly.
---
It breaks the game when the market gets saturated with what are supposed to be ultra-rare god-tier mythical items, which then have to be nerfed because nobody else can stand a chance against them.
---
It breaks the game when the common player is stacking a full set of Assassin's Sentinel armor and carrying shotguns that can do 200k+ DPS.
---
Just keep handing in technical data
---
Are you on PC? I'll give you 5 cards. Free.  If so, find me, my name in the game is tararynieyn also.  My camp is behind Whitesprings on the road to the fissure site. South west a little.
---
Bork sobachki!
---
Right I know they're easy to get, but I've been working on my alt build, he doesn't have Power user or any usable legendarys yet. On my main I have like 90+ core lol maybe that's why I feel like in use so many in comparison.
---
I just got in on my first scorched beast queen fight... Epic! Had to cross the blast zone I was the only one not in Power Armor. Spent a few hundred rounds and im sure i didnt do much damage lol.
---
Had to stop and take pictures of everyone running in to the mushroom cloud. Epic!
---
There's an entire empty floor that serves no purpose right now too. Hell, just let us build our camps closer together so we can actually start making little towns
---
Bogtown, Gorge Junkyard, Dabney Homestead, and Sunshine Meadows all have piles you can extract from. Claim them all, hop around collecting them, and if someone tries to contest the workshop just server hop. I think you can get 30-40/hr from each machine, so it shouldn't take long to build up enough to construct a sweet brick mansion.
---
Bethesda can do all of those things, got nothing to do with Microsoft.
---
False
---
Same thing goes for you, your enjoyment isn't the only thing that matters. Fallout has had raiders and cutthroat elements in every game, you guys are just too soft, used to mowing down npcs with shitty builds, and when an actual player puts you to the test, you crumple and whine, and cry "griefer"
---
It's two sides of a coin, if the softies have all their fun, then nobody else will.
---
My stupid ass was at site bravo putting in charlie codes...
---
Thankyou anyway my dude
---
I saw Excav calibrated shocks at the Whitespring responder bot but 5k caps... I ain't got that.
---
Kill em again
---
X01, but I'll probably switch to regular armor  now that they have Legendary scout armor. I just felt so squishy in a non PA build lol
---
You can get tesla coils on all suits, I believe.  The coils are great for tanking because the electricity field seems to piss off enemies like nothing else.  I've pulled aggro off snipers that are undoubtedly doing far more damage just by walking by the ghouls that are hating on them with a tesla coiled suit.  I think the constant AoE effect draws enemies like moths to a flame.
---
T-51b is the king for conventional damage mitigation, with ultracite being in second place.  X-01 is the best for radiation, and is kinda middling for combat DR, but unfortunately the "hidden" rad DR of power armor and hazmat suits is exponentially better than the hard numbers of chems and armor effects.  You'd need to stack dozens of rad-x to equal the effectiveness of a simple power armor frame.  Try walking into a blast zone with a full set of conventional legendary BOS combat armor with a secondary +25 rad resist (5 pieces equaling 125 resistance, on top of BOS mod boosts) and stack Rad-X, Radshield and Diluted Rad-X on top of it.  You'll be dead in seconds.  Ballistic and Energy DR doesn't seem to have the hidden properties of rad mitigation like power armor and hazmat suits.  Any way you look at it, T-51b is the clear winner in terms of overall utility.
---
Here's real numbers for power armor models.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0iq9v/all_max_level_power_armors_stats/
---
As to the downsides of T-51b with hard to acquire mods, Phoenix at Watoga now sells all the plans for T-51b mods if you have the caps.
---
Oh, rapist logic. Fun stuff. Here's a tip. If your "fun" involves intentionally making the game unplayable for others, _your fun doesn't matter_. 
---
Go play on survival. That mode exists for sociopaths like you.
---
Just laugh because I had the same thing happen to me and I didn't get banned or anything like that.
---
Nothing. Nothing will happen.
---
I hope Bethesda considered it
---
Nope. I wouldn‚Äôt ever use autism as an insult. Was just asking because it seems like you might be.
---
Ignore them and move on with your life?
---
Ok offer stands if you need them.  I don't launch nukes. Just did my first last night and I'm level 202. I'm around most nights.  Have fun :)
---
When you spend ap, you spend core charge. Vats just spends a lot ap, but i doubt anyone will change that
---
I really enjoy Emergency protocols on my bloodied build, not 100% sure it's stacking with Nerd rage but the top tip text is different so I assume that it is.
---
That sucks then, because if you try to ticket it they'll probably just say Unlock It On Another Character.
---
And don't forget to laugh at them.
---
PM me your in game id, I‚Äôll be on in 15 mins or so.
---
If you're on Xbox I can put them on for you for the materials
---
They don't fix exploit fast lol.  Duping took forever.
---
So is this bug still a thing??
---
I don't think you do. You have to actually work at getting yourself killed by other players in adventure mode.
---
What time did you want to get started?
---
The bos hood they‚Äôre pretty rare I think I just bought one through player vending
---
Build your own. Need one tub and a campfire or two.
---
Good to know. My melee uses x-01 and a jet pack but I might just craft another chest and try the Tesla coils and be on the lookout for t51b. I usually don‚Äôt seem to care about melee attacks much as I‚Äôm not a bloodied build. I usually loot while being shot at in PA to avoid walking back to loot lol.
---
Oh...if you play a melee build with an instigating weapon, tesla coils suck ass.  Once they zap enemies, your instigating effect is gone.  Anti-armor or vampire is a way better option if you go down the tank road.
---
It's kinda worth it, because you make friends very easily as an aggro shield, and that little lvl 15 guy grows up to be lvl 200 and gifts you with nice hammers and axes later on, because you took a step back to act as his personal bodyguard when he was just a little chicklet.
---
9pm est
---
Gotcha. I‚Äôll be waiting!
---
Bit extreme to compare me to a rapist. And raiding isn't about making the game unplayable for others. It's about being a variable, making players react, and having fun. There is a real difference between raiding and griefing.
---
Most don't understand that. Too soft. I'll say it again. Grow a pair and realize you're in a wasteland, with psychopaths. If you want a perfect single player "I'm the strongest thing in the land" experience, this is the wrong type of game. It has been deteriorated due to the bitching and crying.
---
Considering that fuck up they had where everyone could open other support tickets lol nah I'm good.
---
Can't trust them with any information
---
I just want clossure. My theory is that her attack from mole miner turned her into one. Then our nukes accelerated the mutation. And shes the proveyor
---
I can literally login, close the launcher, and it'll prompt me for my password again
---
Well u only need 3 in charisma and you dont have to keep the card on after you are done
---
It would make it better against scorched, yes. Worse against everything else.
---
Not true. Even small bugs can have complex solutions. Odds are it isnt as simple as we think with their weird code and this isnt fixed yet. Also every single patch has led to 100s of small bug fixes. Just shh, post a bug post about the issue and move on. If they know, they are working on it
---
Not false. Bethesda has the capability to stop an IP from connecting to the servers as well as the unique product identification code, as that's how they validate that you've got a valid copy otherwise all you need to do to run the game is download a ripped cd and mount the virtual cd.
---
I didn't say, nor did I imply that the amount of time they took to fix it was unreasonable, just that OP was incorrect in his assertion that these problems have been fixed "fast af". 
---
Also, lots of people that don't work for bethesda sorted through the code and came up with solutions for lots of the problems we've had, bethesda has simply ignored them. There was an entire subreddit dedicated to documenting and pseudo-fixing bugs and exploits for a while. I don't know if it's still around or not.
---
as in here Greikhor
---
Just because you're not having problems with the launcher, doesn't mean anyone else has a broken PC
---
So I'm just getting back into fallout 76, and I'm level 40something and am still using trash bolt action rifles and revolvers that do poop damage  :( what  do I do to get better weapons? I Max modded what I have and it still sucks lol
---
What's the full mod kit on your suit? I'm running a melee tank PA build and I may try this.
---
Report *them*.
---
Seriously, threatening to have multiple people file false reports for game play is actual harassment.
---
Oh I'll piss off, I'll piss right off the side of your CAMP, all over your machine!
---
The sheds around Tangara Town have 6 or 8. One of the highest concentrations I have seen.
---
That would make sense it's not how Bethesda is going to do it though we are piggy banks to them they have to slow us down
---
Pics or it didn't happen.
---
Too many goofy costumes already. If I could I'd ban anyone in a mascot head or furry suit from my venders.
---
What do u mean. So ur saying if I stand there and do nothing I can't get killed by them?
---
How come more important platforms, like Steam for example, do maintenance during the off hours rather than peak time then? Doing maintenance during peak time is just not very professional. And yes EU peak time is usually peak gaming time worldwide, as the steam charts indicate every single day.
---
There's tons of people who are getting paid way less to work odd hours. Where I'm from every single gas station on the highway is open and manned 24/7. And now you're telling me a studio owned by a billion dollar company can't afford to just have a bunch of people come in a few hours later 1 day every other week?
---
I can understand emergency maintenance being done whenever they discover the issues and they've got the people they need on deck. But planned maintenance and updates during peak time just shows a lake of care IMO.
---
Ignore them and carry on with your life without worrying about petty squabbles.
---
Nope that is done threw Microsofts end. That is why they dont have generic codes online for any platform. The reason why they have you enter in your email address at the beginning of the game is so they can have control over play base too
---
I mean, let me be absolutely clear here. In my 700+ hours in this game, every "raider" I've ever seen is _nothing_ but a griefer.  They abuse mechanics to kill players, destroy bases, and make the game annoying for others. Exactly what you tell yourself for a "backstory" to let do this is immaterial. 
---
And any number of people HAVE left this game because of to many interactions with people like you. 
---
And it's not an "extreme" view at all. It's the exact same mentality that because you have the ability to take something away from someone, you can, and you will. It's the same form of mental sickness. 
---
And for the last time. if you want to be a self serving sociopathic asshole, go play on survival. it was MADE for people like you.
---
Seems like you should bring in geckos from New Vegas at the very least.
---
They fixed that a couple of patches ago
---
Sent you friend request.  Taz.....  at camp.  I‚Äôm checking to make sure I can mod
---
Exactly. People who don't understand how releases work have no clue. If they deployed patches at convenient times for Europe, with a skeleton crew to keep costs down, and something goes wrong, everyone is inconvenienced since they don't have the full staff there to fix things, meaning the game would be down even longer than normal. Not only that, but if they were, let's say, to deploy at 11 AM UTC time. That's 6 AM EST (likely not the most workable time for them to deploy) meaning they'd have to be there at 3 AM EST to be ready to deploy at 6 AM. Additionally, it's also prime time for most of China, Russia, Japan, Australia, Korea. Quit whining about Bethesda doing their jobs in the most efficent manner and just deal with it, it's a couple hours downtime for maintenance.
---
I‚Äôve seen them run away the past few days. Or try to, because they usually do it after I‚Äôve shot up their legs so they‚Äôre moving at a pretty slow pace. Great fun.
---
This happened to me with one of the freestates bunkers.  It finally unlocked for me when I went inside and then came back outside again.
---
Shit, I can do treated and protective.  Not shielded :(.  Sorry to waste your time
---
Zoom and you will find what you are seeking young one ;)
---
Ok. This is a sbq schorched mob gun.  I‚Äôm gonna do it.
---
Because there is always exploits after new updates they will never have time to fix actual bugs. Most of the annoying bugs have been in game since BETA.
---
You can put the perk on tame your animal, then take it off. The animal will stay.
---
It'll split the last map tho as a different row.
---
That makes sense, forcing the launcher to forget the password, I can't find anywhere that BGS mention the change. They do seem to love introducing thinks secretly or they are all using stealth 3\*
---
and that's relative. kevduit's latest video illustrates what I'm trying to communicate, it's a sarcastic take on "auto builds are OP". he dies a lot, spends most of the time farming for materials to craft ammo and takes forever to down ghouls. why? because he's not making use of either the bloodied or sneak mechanics.
---
I mean, you *can* invest in str and slugger and spam hundreds of stimpacks per minute, that's what most casual players do. it'll definitely get them through the game. kevduit joined the Arktos event. but I wouldn't exactly call it easy, more like death has no real penalty. that's a trash "playstyle".
---
and it's exactly what all of us would be reduced to without the bloodied and sneak mechanics. the game is only "easy" when you can crit a crippled SB in the face from an inch away for 3K damage per shot. but if they nerfed those mechanics? we'd *need* the absolute best legendaries, and with the current rng we're screwed.
---
you want nocturnal?
---
Prime it.
---
Steam is a delivery platform, they have that luxury because their updates can be postponed or ignored until a more convenient time. Games that update on Steam, however, can't be played until their update is applied, and if the game manufacturer is applying server side updates, they have the same downtime based on the game manufacturer location. So your analogy is garbage.
---
The game is dying, my server only has 5 players in it and this sales figure with no credible evidence backing it up PROVES IT
---
Exactly... you will take 0000 damage unless you return fire, therefore consenting to PvP...
---
Only exception is taking a Workshop, in which case you also get a warning indicating it will turn off pacifist and leave you open to PvP. 
---
So if your'e getting killed, it's because you returned fire or took a workshop. That's basically consent.
---
Wat
---
The only thing I can take a pic of is that the challenge is checked off. I dont have that character anymore it was months ago. But you can argue with me all you want. They might have added more content to her in an update after I completed it, but I did finish it. 100% certain.
---
Kind of. The trouble is my once glorious collection of well thought out photos has been overrun by pictures of dead animals.
---
I've been having an issue with camera challenges not counting. To fix it, I got a few new cameras, fixed them, and they worked for a bit, but then they stopped. I renamed them and they started working again. Give either of those "fixes" a try.
---
Exactly.
---
‚ÄúI even tried different zoom levels‚Äù 
---
Bruh did you even read the post
---
Yes. I have 2 powered arms and my ap begins regenerating almost immediately
---
No? That wouldn't make logical sense, explain further.
---
Oh TIL, I'm almost never low on ammo since I'm a hoarder by nature so I didn't know.
---
I patch servers when the user load is low, if that means 1am my local time , then so be it. Actually, it's 1:37am here and I'm heading to bed, after patching...
---
Thanks, PC though
---
Love seeing more cool and reactive fans. Coils are great for farming, sbq, etc.
---
I got jet packs when I started, butvdont use them ever anymore....coils or servos or plates.
---
Sent a request!
---
I love corn soup cause I'm always over encumbered. Then glowing meat steaks + carnivore + good with salt is easy. I used to run irradiated meat without the salt perk.
---
Would you sell it?
---
Still need the item Moded, if anyone hase the plans please let me know.
---
Great post? Just saying never logged in more then once doesn't seem to be a Bethesda problem so much as your problem
---
Wow ok thanks for that information!
---
Where does one get a 10mm scorched receiver.   I have a zealots is do too.
---
Oh, I guess you are just shit out of luck Bruh... Too bad for you
---
Honestly, very, very simple.  Tesla coils on the torso for aggro, Recon sensors on the helmet just to mark legendaries when I pull out my back-up pistol to keep after them, Optimized Bracers for power attacking the SBQ (which I don't do anymore now that I use 3 ranks of dodgy perk for defense) and Calibrated Shocks for QoL.  I may replace the legs with Kinetic Servos to add to Dodgy perk AP regen, but I opted for a high Agility for AP and a light dip into pistol perks so AP refreshes pretty quickly anyways, while carry weight is a constant.
---
The perk loadout plays a much more important role for tanking.  Blocker, Serendipity and Dodgy are really key when I want to tank.  Nerd Rage would help, but it's so situational when running at max health that it hardly helps against enemies that hit like freight trains and can chunk me out in 3-4 hits.  I'm never really in a situation with a boss where being under 10% health helps.
---
idk i just want old winters man mask dvote me
---
Let me try to get this point across another way then. If you owned a casino, would you close it down during the evening hours to get your cleaning done? If you owned a bakery, would you only open around midday because you don't want to get up before 8 am and get your baking done?
---
The point is most businesses do not deprive their customer base of the experience/service their offering during the peak hours. That is a bad business practice. I don't really understand why you would try to argue that their personal convenience is somehow more important?
---
bUt It WiLl FuCk WiTh ThE eCoNoMy!!!
---
That's ummm... not true. I run a vats build and I can vats anyone that isnt crouching soooo.....
---
I would recommend no more than 3. Once you get 3 pieces with powered effect, you could I vest other two pieces into something else. The Regen rate is so fast with 3.
---
Oooh I've got one of those!  Minus 2 of the Bloodied, but still.  I rolled a new character and am leveling him now to be able to use it, can't wait to lay down green death!
---
a medic's anything is not exactly what I meant, though. more like a "dream weapon". like, I don't consider myself a greedy player. and I have all the LMGs I could possibly ask for, so I don't trade or farm as often any longer, even though there's a lot of room for improvement in my gear.
---
I can finally focus of exploring and killing things- for fun! and not as a part-time job. farming for the sake of farming is poor game design.
---
Yep - all assaultron heads go straight into the scrapper.
---
I guess other new players can read this so they are now aware how this works. Thanks everyone for you comments!
---
There is also the problem of them dying in the camp generation,or just vanishing,or dying chasing that rat.
---
I personally have problem with all the noobs that kite strong enemies to my base. My let can easily handle attackers but those are stronger.
---
Finally it takes too much to find one,for such high risk of losing it.
---
You didn‚Äôt have to delete them though. You can still take the pictures and complete challenges even if you‚Äôre at max :‚Äô(
---
I work in IT as well, but single (or even a small handful) IT employee maintenance periods isn't the same as these type of releases. It yang the same in the slightest.
---
There's a forklift over there for you know...forkin' around.
---
Herbivore over here!
---
The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment.
---
10mm smgs work amazingly well with a scorched killer receiver, as long as you have the ammunition to burn. With a Zealot's prefix I think it woukd do about 50 damage to scorched before any perks or armour penetration mods
---
Five months, five months and NOBODY asked this guy why he has 60-80 tabs open, which is a clear lie.
---
Sort of true, because of this the only place left is workshops so now if a raider is on the server then no one is allowed to use workshops. Lol.
---
every one makes stupid, avoidable mistakes.  it's why i have job security.
---
You gotta be closer.  Zoom doesn't tag creatures properly, you have to be damn near close enough to shake hands with them.  Good luck!
---
Yup, i know it can be daunting having some player open fire on you. You return fire without even thinking about it, i mean you have to defend yourself right? But the truth is you don't. You can ignore them, don't fall for the bait. If they continue to harass you, just block them and jump to another world. You will never see them again. 
---
To be clear, if you take a workshop it doesn't matter if you return fire or not. They can challenge your claim and attack at will. So avoid workshops and you'll be fine as long as you don't return fire.
---
Adventure is built so you can avoid confrontation if you want too. That is why they made Survival Mode, for those that want to go around killing each other.
---
I sell mine for 250c that way players can resell to in game vendors for a profit
---
It doesn't matter how easy they are to get, the drain from vats is just THAT horrible.  You don't just drain your cores by attacking in vats, just bringing vats up drains your core... just hitting the button with NOTHING in range drains the core.  I have a habit of just randomly tapping vats while I run from place to place to see what might pop up around me and when I started using power armor for a while I went through so many cores before I realized what was happening.
---
No shit, right? I can't get the achievements for visiting areas I have literally had bases in...I even started a new character just to revisit those places and still can't get the achievements to pop.
---
Great point! Also, just because it‚Äôs 3* does not mean it‚Äôs worth a thing. People seem to see the three stars and assume people will pay anything for them.
---
So when will the teleporting enemies and getting hit from 10 feet away be fixed or am I just gonna have to be at a disadvantage every time I fight something? Same day 1 issues.
---
I agree with an account storage as well as character storage, could even pay atoms to upgrade it
---
LOL, that reminds me of Jeff Goldblum stumbling across a TRex pile :)
---
I‚Äôll have to try it out. My jet pack is my insurance policy if I miss a jump. Even with marsupial I miss jumps lol.
---
Mental, 
---
I lived online that weekend Adventure was double XP.  I must have played 20 hours from Friday night to Sunday grinding my ass off.  Would love to see semi-regular events like that, and I'd be fine if they were something like MomsFav suggested, 2x or 3x for certain kill styles (3x for unarmed kills etc).
---
So far the only photo challenge i didn't do was the alien one when it was bugged. Now that is fixed so i don't know what you're talking about.
---
Sometimes you'll get a group that drags her out side the nuke zone. üòÅ
---
I second this.
---
I have been playing since launch but am still in the 50s since I cant play that often. I finally scrapped up enough caps to buy the extra carry weight mod for the excavator legs and it was the most caps I ever had.
---
Nothing wrong with a fight in the blast zone - makes it more of a challenge and sorts out the wannabes.
---
So people can paint racist, toxic signs like in Rust? Not a good idea.
---
Nada
---
I would welcome a 200lb global mailbox more than a 200lb stash increase...
---
You have been a big help today. Thanks heaps for your advice. I will let everyone no :)
---
Quad, bloodied or anti armor, explosive, faster fire, weight reduced gauss?

I said I took several and some we're "right in the deathclaw's face" and "the name was in the corner of the frame each time".
---
I'm on Xbox whatcha wanna offer
---
Some are in the back trying to destroy the mortars on the roof. Always take a lap or two when clearing the main force. The event will move on if their alive or not.
---
Where do I  get a primed receiver?
---
Thank you, I appreciate you taking a moment to type all that out!
---
Or harpoon which you obviously use flechette
---
Day 1 glitch. They said they would be fixed, but it's been about 6 months since they said that.
---
4k!? Lol at that rate, even the enclave vendor has them cheaper. I think i can get it for like 3500 with charisma and hard bargain.
---
Seeing as robot vendor usually stiffs you with the price, If robot vendor has them cheaper, you're clearly way overpriced.
---
Jesus Christ. Thank you for calling them out on this.  I don't see why people bother responding without reading the entire post.
---
That's fair.  I can build you a beautiful logo or brand identity, but I have no idea how to run a marathon or bake a pie.  I just assumed that digging through decades of a single player framework and trying to piecemeal it into a functional multiplayer utility would be hard AF.  Kinda like getting into a conference room with a start-up team of coders and trying to extract grains of their aesthetic vision from the Asberger Sea.
---
(I actually love working with start-ups, because they're truthful and the idea of bullshit never occurred to them.)
---
Just not really that kind of game I don't think.  There are perks that help with healing others but even that hardly has any practical use in the game right now.  Most things die fast enough where tanking isn't important to begin with.  If your friend is using a bloodied build he should be sneaking which should help him not aggro things to begin with too.
---
I'll try these
---
SBQ if not mistaken.
---
Please get rid of the stash limit or better yet let us have more then one container
---
Yeah I hate fire works also but I like the exploding weapons for the extra damage they do.
---
I tried to test that in a workshop and it did nothing. Actually it seems to just delay your imput.  So instead of press---&gt; effect, it is press--&gt; seconds---&gt; effect
---
Nope, just exploits. As it says above - Patch 10.
---
With the right perk set up you can get up to 600. Maybe more. I know from 6am to 6pm I have 600 carry weight. Then it drops to 545 or something after 6.
---
Take off everything and follow them around the wasteland just staring at them.  Players hate that
---
That's what I do. Keep my awesome pictures and then just take the challenge pictures without saving them
---
Dicks. Dicks everywhere.
---
Oh, sorry I must have missed that.  Just trying to be helpful!
---
It would be cool but I‚Äôd hope to see it in per item storage and not weight based. Already have 800 pounds of storage per character. And what ever each one can physically carry. Really no need to add even more. Bags just released. Make it like 15-20 items and your good
---
Yeah I have to keep my camp in BFE where no one goes and nothing spawns to keep my pet safe
---
My pleasure.  If more people opted for tanking than DPS, a Whitespring nuke would be a pleasure.  Only one person gets loot with a B/E shotgun.  Everyone has more loot than they can carry when you follow around a perked out power armor tank.
---
That be awesome if they could and would. 
---
I have a great collection of interesting teddy bears
---
Lets use xbox. Ok so Microsoft describes itself as a link. Fallout is linked on one side straight just to xbox. In order for you to link to xbox also they have to give you the key (code from online, physical disk, digitally downloaded access). In order for them to obtain info on you that you dont give them they have to go threw their link(xbox). The way they make us abide by the rules is they make us enter in info to create a bethesda account. That info immediately gets associated with our gt (info you have agreed to share). This is the only way they can disable you accessing your account without going threw the link(xbox).
---
Diagram:
---
(You)‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî(xbox)‚Äî‚Äî-(bethesda acct)‚Äî‚Äî(fo76)
---
Just go all the way and give us the robot bench the top can literally port it from fo4 to 76
---
It‚Äôs coming out tomorrow
---
Join the Responders instead. :o)
---
not as important in general gameplay, but during bosses it kinda is, and it would help making the whole fight a little bit less chaotic, it could only help if they make it so more specific builds have a purpose instead of everyone just a generic jack of all trades, people actually already specialize anyway
---
Oh I know, there's about 20 I refuse to remove even though I know they're stored on the hdd because they make great loading screens. I do have to spend a lot of time this days deleting dead animal photos though. I love the camera but it does produce some shoddy pictures at times.
---
But... she‚Äôs very clearly human in the ‚ÄúNuke Launch‚Äù holotape. Considering that holotape only appears once the player launches a nuke, it‚Äôs safe to assume that it‚Äôs her most recent documentation.
---
That's fair.  Use third person view if you're not sure.  If you're on PC, hold down V and draw the mouse back for maximum 3rd person view.
---
Another poor analogy set- casinos never really close, and they're not servicing a worldwide time zone. They would close at the times most convenient for them in their time zone... which would likely be about 8 AM. A bakery also doesn't service customers around the entire globe. So they go in at 4 AM and bake because their customers come in the early morning in THEIR TIME ZONE. 
---
But every bakery I know closes down at 4 or 5 in the evening. What about my midnight hankering for doughnuts. Those jerks should be open then with fresh baked goods! Hopefully this gets my point across. Europe isn't the center of gaming, and to think so is massively egotistical.  Additionally, sales figures show that Fallout 76 sold 2.46 million copies, much of those probably at 50%-80% off within a week of release. 
---
Someone who doesn't understand business and budgeting won't fathom that the department for Fallout 76 has its own budget and funding separate from other Bethesda departments. They don't just throw all their money into one big stack and pay everyone from the same pool. FNV, 8.42M copies, FO3, 9.94M copies, FO4, 14.91M copies, for reference. FO76 has GROSSLY underperformed on raw sales numbers, and their profitability on it has been ABYSMAL because of how badly the release was botched. Their department is honestly probably floundering, and increasing the budget for off-hours deployments for a game with arguably at best a few hundred thousand online at any given point during a 24 hour period, it's pretty simple. Do the math, and then suck it up and deal with it, or go make your own European based gaming company and release on your schedule.
