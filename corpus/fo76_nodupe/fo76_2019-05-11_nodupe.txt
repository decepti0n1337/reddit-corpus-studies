My camp is called, "Kayla's Nuka-Palace" so everyone who visits gets a tour and a free Nuka-Cola!

Then don‚Äôt read them. If you see the title referring to a returning or new player then pass it by.

Best way to combat the 10% tax is price gear higher, basically the formula is.... Price you want + 10% = Buyer's Price. Fallout 76 has become EBay.
---
I set a goal I want to accomplish in the span of about a hour to 1h 30m and go out there and do it. I'm looking to have fun when I get on the game so I only get on once or twice a week.
---
Thanks
---
Spike traps.
---
Oh, Thx! Probably duper crashes
---
Nah. You're just a limpdick troll with alt accounts.
---
Just started trying to build a new camp and I cannot remove anythinf due it not being 'accessible'. Literally a single foundation and one set of stairs and I cannot remove either of them. Quit and reloaded and problem persisted so I though oh well let's just carry on, now I cannot remove any floors I've added either. 
---

---
Since tuesday I've been thinking this patch was a real home run for the devs and the fans but stuff breaking *every single time* this game is updated is getting real boring now.
---
I plan on making more videos using photo mode. It's really fun to use
---
Tbh I thought duping was patched months ago
---
I dont think it's no big deal for that reason, just that it's kinda inevitable with an MMo and no cause for alarm. I dont play enough to care and can only game for like 8 hours a week.
---
You aren't wrong brotha :)
---
Wasteland whisperer never affected death claws it was always animal friend.
---
Ive used both now, the staircase platform and the metal stairs. Ive got it to accept the floor once by placing the floors outside of the structure and then back in but was unable to delete the outer floors. Last week I had an issue with foundations and staircases being unscrapable or storable as well.
---
Can the camp owner just put a power switch to the vendor? Guests can come and turn it off and on if there is an afk guy, and it would kick them from the menu right?
---
üëç
---
I am aware but Valseek confirmed in the latest patch update thread that Deathclaws can now be tamed with wasteland whisperer
---
I *might* be wrong, because I'm no expert with xEdit. But that's my conclusion anyway. If you can find a reliable spawn of Sugar Bombs then you'll have proved me wrong
---
&gt; We went into hiding within our camps as we pieced together what was left of this lonely world, always anticipating those dreadful wings beating against the air, and that blood curdling shriek...
---
This part is especially true. I love how nowadays we as players have the gear and skills (perks) to take out scorchbeasts when they show up, as opposed to 6 months ago. We have evolved and progressed just like our characters.
---
 do they suck how do they suck the make everything in the game cheaper ! If there's more of them out there the economy of the gamer be all f***** up and you want to have to spend 50k on a gun and a 100 K on the set of armor
---
I can do, but I'll have to get round to that tomorrow now (UK time)
---
Strange I‚Äôve had this problem before but I usually either quit the game or assume it‚Äôs the server causing issues but I did have but where the game said can‚Äôt have other object intersect with one another when placing concrete stairs
---
lol. just got into some pvp. disconnected. now I look like a lil bitch lol.
---
This has happened to 2 sets of power armor to me
---
Lol it really does!
---
Actually if gun does not kill with one boolit, is not good gun.
---
wow you are a real cocksucker. it is bethesdas fault
---
One is enough for me atm
---
Also, people just need to exercise common courtesy. If you‚Äôre going AFK, just park your carcass out of the way!
---
If only all the camps weren‚Äôt pretty much the same... It‚Äôs either a brick box or a giant monstrosity.
---
This is literally the best thing I've seen all day. Thank God you're on Xbox. I WILL be swinging by.
---
Yeah :/ finding 16 unique colors is hard! I have included the "desirable nodes" map which you may find more useful
---
Indeed. And they break so fast.
---
There is a cool mask on the floor in the basement
---
The stair platform is buggy as hell. Always has been. I never use it.
---
...You are foul. Eat shit, you fucking misogynist piece of trash. üòä
---
I haven‚Äôt played since the update (damn work travel) is lag and server stability that much worse now than a couple weeks ago? My feeling was that Bethesda was to blame for most of the instability. 
---
Either way the in-game economy was getting out of hand. I think you told me yourself once that a friend of yours paid 180k caps for a piece of armor. That‚Äôs unattainable for even someone with 5 accounts on one Xbox. 
---
Hope to see you in the wasteland.
---
I don't think theyyyy.... get it so to speak. lol
---
yeah because THIS is whats going to stop dupers from duping, some goodie two shoes calling them names lmfao. get real, the only way to fix dupes is to bring them to light. that said, if you want to dupe on xbox just ask the dupers or go to the lfg on xbx and look for lobbies where they teach you how to do it. dupers are spreading these techniques far and wide JUST to piss off people like you. you want duping to stop? start making all the dupes known otherwise how tf is bethesda gonna know which ones to patch out. watch me get downvoted by salty people who think sweeping duping under the rug is whats gonna fix it.
---
If an option to cheat exists people will cheat. It's up to the developers to make sure that option doesn't exist.
---
I think upon doing this you're starting to enter "hacks" territory. I'm afraid I wouldn't know how to anyway.
---
Yeah I guess this is a workaround for camp vendors, still leaves the others. Also, as an avid builder myself, I would resent spending the budget! Lol.

I ask because my game is stable as can be on pc. I get maybe 1-2 disconnect a month.
---
Somebody said that you don't actually need to power the vending machine to use it, powering it was just for advertising your CAMP on the map.
---
How is cocksucker misogynistic? You don't know Z's pronouns
---
There is also a computer related task for a badge that involves LAUNCHING A NUKE.
---
I feel like the scoutmaster robots updated the requirements in the last 25 years. Otherwise the Pioneer Scouts would be a legally questionable group &gt;.&gt;
---
Directly south of the federal deposit? In which case that's on the map already
---
Isn't there already a sight like this? Fo76maps.com
---
ok, i see
---
I also have a deathclaw pet, and have been wondering since they‚Äôre no longer considered ‚Äúanimals‚Äù if I‚Äôd be able to tame another. 
---
I‚Äôve not been able to tame anything new since the patch.
---
I've been looking for them forever as well. Not that I'll ever be able to afford them :/ I saw them in someone's vending machine for $5000, but wasn't able to get them sadly.
---
I want a fleet of Eyebots just yelling "COME TO SPACEZOMBIE'S REST STOP, YOU SCUMBAGS!"
---
yeah, the afks at regular vendors might need a solution anyways. might as well implement it at player vendors when the time comes(if it does)
---
"Hey little Timmy, want your badge? Go launch a fucking nuke!!"
---
You can get them from Grahm sometimes but it‚Äôs like 12k
---
Good to hear. I haven‚Äôt had too much trouble in the past and I only get to play on the weekends bc of work and kids, but the past few times ppl have been randomly showing up to my camp (which is high the heck up in the mountains out of the way) and blasting me away. It‚Äôs not gonna drive me away from the game, I think it‚Äôs great, but I just question whether or not those ppl have anything better to do.
---
Dang. It makes you just want to quit for awhile. Same day I accidentally spent 1500 atoms on a bubdle I didn't want. So it was a real bad day. Now with the legendary exchange, my feelings are balanced.
---
Thanks for the info üëç
---
Yeah I was playing the game like 20 min ago. It still says the game is offline in the news section but it's running.
---
Yes and I'm calling the police
---
Yeah, an in-game group, not a real life libertarian party in New Hampshire
---
Please tell me you‚Äôre on PS4 because I could really use a better sniper rifle!
---
I don't know what the "exploit" was but I was just playing a minute ago and was trying to find a chassis in my stash to store some armor on but accidentally duplicated my excavator armor onto an empty chassis?? I dont know how but it kinda pissed me off cause now I have more armor I dont want lol.
---
There have been many, many different ways to dupe items.
---
"What are you doing here, little tyke?"
---
"My scoutmaster said i need to shoot a nuke at the hotel down the road to get my computer science badge."
---
"......Control, this is front door security, we have a problem."
---
That's worse, haha. I've seen him a few times in the past few days but he didn't have anything good.
---
You don't need to be Bethesdas bitch,  I'm saying that it helps people who are looking for something specific like a plan or springs.
---
Are these rare ? I've vendored so many..
---
That's too bad :(
---
This is the most baseless fucking caveman logic on the planet and is roughly tantamount to, ‚ÄúwAnnA StOP cRIme? COmMiT moRe CRImE.‚Äù Gtfoh with that bullshit.
---
Nope.  Just a casual fallout 76 player who had a question.  If I hated the game, then I wouldn't be playing it.
---
Since the newest patch, has anyone tamed a Deathclaw or Mirelurk since they are no longer considered ‚Äúanimals‚Äù?
---
Also, really like this idea üëç
---
Yeah me and my buddies dropped a nuke on White Springs last night and the server crashed and it was most likely because of dupers. They suck!
---
This has been my most use post since the update apart from the stupid exam answers. üòÇ Thank you so much! So much easier to keep track of progress than checking each individual challenge each time.

Odds for a specific weapon may be low but what about odds by category? 
---
For example, 1h melee as a group? Shotgun as a group...etc.?
---
Damn. Well the more you know, thanks for the reply lol
---
*Note: If you‚Äôre going to come in here with some bullshit, you can fuck all the way off. *
---
I was playing last night and my teammate lost a second set of power armor while we were playing.  That scares the shit out of me.  My Mutant‚Äôs Explosive Gatling Plasma is quite literally irreplaceable.  If it ever vanishes, I‚Äôll cry for days.  It would make me want to quit playing.
---
Your fine then it was just a display glitch on the server.
---
You lose
---
I throw it in for free
---
Really? I lose for making a suggestion then you calling me entitled?
---
It wasn't as interesting as I anticipated it back in beta but it's alright.
---
2k 2mm isn't that much, I keep about 1500 for my main Instigating Gauss rifle. But those numbers you screenshotted are ridiculous. To the point of questioning why they would even need to sell stuff for caps in the game
---
*raises hand* 
---
As someone who just started, and is low level (prob because I am still learning how to even manage to build stuff and not die of thirst or hunger) what is this SBQ? And how can I avoid it so I don‚Äôt cause issues for you and any others o.o cuz it sounds scary
---
Sometimes at the BOS vendor.
---
How about a commercial while waiting to fast travel or respawn.....don't give them any ideas. And if Bethesda implements, I want compensation.
---
Maybe op meant irl and is talking to us from a ouiji board
---
The end game Scorched Beast Queen.
---
Wait, should we be able to see our own camp as a selling camp icon on the map? 
---
Because I don‚Äôt, just my normal yellow tent icon. Maybe that‚Äôs why no one is stopping by....
---
I wonder what I‚Äôve done wrong.
---
Yes right!  The QE works better, especially with VATS I never miss now.  And I‚Äôve already been using some melee stuff mixed in!  I do melee in low level areas and switch to SG in high.  Feel like shotty shells are now so precious haha!
---
As far as cooking ingredients go there is a lot you already covered on your other maps.  I have a list of all usable cooking ingredients just in case something was missed.  This way you can pick which ones you want to put on a map that are say harder to come by based on how much they populate... like the Royal Jelly.

Yeah, why do they do that? There's nothing we could steal up there and they're probably there about 1% of the time. 
---
I leave raw fertiliser outside of all those locked doors
---
I see that, yesterday I got 3 messages from people telling me how they liked my camp.
---
Ooooohhhhh noted üëç
---
People want the XP and don‚Äôt realize that the game thinks everyone there has some firepower which f$&amp;ks the ones that do.
---
Ive been doing the same thing
---
This!
---
I mean, the smug attitude I've encountered from cheaters is just so infuriating yet laughable at the same time.
---
You can accidentally dupe, that power armor bugs happens every now and then. That bug often dupes my armor. Happened around 5 times since beta.
---
Put ur vendor near vault or white springs and you‚Äôll see some sort of sales I made 30k
---
Nah just yesterday i start lagging like crazy. I check the map and see everyone huddled together right in the centre. I suspect they're duping. I get there and my suspicions were correct. They'd done some dope glitches. They were are strung out on meth specificly.
---
Seems like its now impossible to place walls on a second story if stairs are below it. This is incredibly frustrating.
---
She doesn't get increased resistance anymore
---
So essentially the problem is and I‚Äôm just spitballing (I‚Äôm a newb at this game but this is interesting concept) if you and 3 others are on a event/ quest to kill this beast and about to kill her and suddenly a low level just wanders in and randomly fires off a round or doesn‚Äôt even do anything, since they in event/quest area they leech xP off your work?
---
You need both Animal Friend AND Wasteland Whisperer to be able to tame anything.  And I‚Äôm pretty sure they pulled Deathclaws and Sloths from the pool no?
---
I have this exact same problem! I eventually just rebuilt my camp with the stair case leading to a balcony.
---
Thank you!
---
I made this mistake too. üôÅ
---
You know what's going on! Should we only be mad at the dupers though? Why isn't there an outcry against the whales that throw RL cash at these things? The dupers aren't the real scumbags. They're entrepreneurs simply providinga service to the other type of gamer. The game willing to throw ridiculous amount of RL money just to get whatever item or cap or whatever that floats their boat. It's not just FO76 either. This kind a RL cash being essentially laundered through video games is in games like GTA5 too. We've all had discussions about how micro transactions that give players a meaningful in-game advantage sucks ass. But for some reason we blame EA for making games like Battlefront 2. We demand that BGS doesn't do Repair Kits or any other "utility" item. But WHO should we really be mad at and calling scumbags? Not the developers. Not even the dupers. The real enemy is the bad gamers. The weak fishes with money they're not responsible with, playing a game they suck at.
---
Thank you! We really are writing a collaborative story together.
---
I saw them in Sutton earlier today but I didn't have the caps for them.. I've been spending too much at vending machines.
---
I saw Grhm with them a few days ago too. I've heard R&amp;G often has them but haven't checked because my caps balance had been low lately.
---
Stand on dark blue awning in the group of tents south of flat woods
---
Aww poor Beth. Nothing is on them right? Poor little guys. It's all on the big bad mean dupers. They should take all the blame. Let's conveniently leave out the demand for duped items driven by players who far outnumber dupers. 
---
How about you use that brain of yours and give everyone their fair share of the blame?
---
Before the update all I needed was animal friend. I tamed different things with it and never needed wasteland whisperer.
---
Many thanks ! ! ! Was trying earlier, but thought it must be the wrong spawn or something and gave up
---
It's not unattainable if you have trusted friends with 5 characters that dont care to laon you a few. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£ü§£You will see me soon, very soon. Muahaha! But first lil momma needs fed and is eyeballing me. üëÄüòÅ
---
Trying to get the kids to settle down now, I even turned down an extra work shift for tomorrow because Friday night is the one time daddy gets to have some drinks and play video games.
---
Do you have weapon artisan perk? Unable it when you make it too..I found that out after ü§£ü§£ so once I took those cards off the crossbow broke faster
---
It‚Äôs always been both from what I understand.  I needed both to tame mine that I had like months ago.  Did a recent patch say you only needed one?
---
?
---
People who want to put a flag at their settlement... how is it against Free States Philosophy
---
Yeah I spent 20k in two days and after spending all of my caps I came across someone selling a bloodied explosive laser rifle with 90% reduced weight for 25k. I guarantee whoever bought is going to resell it for alot of caps. Also thanks for the advice
---
I‚Äôm in the green cat faction. Sneak cat topiaries *everywhere*.
---
I dont know but I only have 4 point of charisma and only use animal friend and never had an issue taming Deathclaw, sloth, radtoad, mirelurk king.
---
Not true. I dumped 6500 rounds at 200 to 400 damage each into her. Account for 20% missed and that‚Äôs a million damage,  we had 10 or more people not helping. There‚Äôs no way. When I would light her up she would take off.
---
Negative on that. The new update wrecked havoc on building, constant floating/intersecting errors and stairs are broken af.
---
That happens when there's a lot of junk you're trying to buy. You usually can buy half.
---
Was this stated somewhere?
---
I haven't seen anything in any patch notes.
---
Had the same. I built two full walls next to them, tossed one a roof and attached the half wall to a roof and built from there.
---
You can remove the roof and extra walls afterward.
---
I was able too reduce the number by 1 and buy then.
---
\&gt;  You enjoy environmental storytelling, where you absorb the story through  discovering holotapes, notes, terminal entries, etc.  You like figuring  out the story on your own rather than having it fed to you.   
---
This is why I love 76 and didn't think much of Fallout 4 at all (relative to other Fallouts). I think this point is the main takeaway for "why Fallout 76 is still actually a good game, all things considered".
---
It's more than leeching, her resistance is based on the amount of people in the event.
---
Everyone who commented thanks for the adviceüòä
---
It worked! After claiming I laid a trap and I received the reward
---
How do you do dupe /s
---
Yes, redo the stings and things repeatable quest given by the dolly sods mr. Handy
---
Interesting.  Must‚Äôve been changed at some point!
---
I‚Äôd love to die for you, and vise versa. I don‚Äôt have a mic though. How would you like to croak?? I have a couple of grenades to use on myself.
---
Oh that‚Äôs terrible... so she gets stronger depending on how many attackers? So is it easier as a solo attack? (Pardon my questions I‚Äôm genuinely curious, P.S. love the cult of moth man thing) I actually got a picture of him from a distance but it‚Äôs zoomed in üòÅ
---
How did you value your game files
---
I tried half
---
Redid twice on two different servers and still nothing. Do I need to do anything special after completing the Stings and Things quest?
---
What's a reasonable price to you? I've got one I'll part with. And what system you on?
---
Yeah! Add me and I‚Äôll be at my base. I‚Äôve got a pond here too so we can get the water part.
---
I bought them and regret it. I thought oh, I have plenty of caps, might as well buy something cool. Now it will be forever before I can afford a mutation serum recipe.
---
The TSE Nerf really hurt my OSE lever action a lot :(
---
Send the camp owner a message. You can only inspect if they're near by, most will travel back
---
If the owner is in the area, then you can inspect them..once he leaves the area, you cant.
---
I went to every circle/location it gave me I didn't go anywhere else for bug parts. That's the only thing I did that completed the quest
---
Following the recent updates I've gone from 0 crashes over 2 months to 3 in one day. Two of them have been mid combat so I've re-logged to find myself dead with no hope of getting any earned loot or items dropped at death. Just had another in my camp after entering power armour.
---
Balanced and logical opinions don't belong in this subreddit. Didn't you know?
---
I‚Äôll shot my feet with my TSE!
---
Ah. Well, then it'd be nice to be able to always inspect. I was stuck thinking that I was randomly getting lucky lil
---
i‚Äôd say it‚Äôs half and half, beth needs to fix the problem too
---
Oh yeah. Do the campfire event and stock up.
---
Did not know this, thanks. Would be nice if the owner didn't need to be nearby, more convenient for everyone.
---
It's always nice to have a fight when that fight isn't so hilariously one sided that person doesn't have to try, and the other can't try hard enough.
---
Had a fight like that once, I really miss being able to battle it out and not have the battle be a forgone conclusion based on legendary gear.
---
Yes. This is an extreme case. Typically people try to help but they can‚Äôt. She‚Äôs really hard under good circumstances. People will show up and hide and it just makes her impossible unless we have one of those god-build queen killer Gatling dudes or dudettes with us.
---
Nice, I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs located where plenty of low levels would find it? Like on the highway in the forest?
---
Beware the green death claws, they don‚Äôt hide
---
It's Bethesda's fault... They simply shouldn't fuck up so bad every other patch...  Dupers are scummy but so is rng 0.2% drop rates, stealth Nerf's and Bethesda's inability to refund items missing from your inventory because of a game bug.
---
Shit happens.
---
So? If you buy a defective product you're not forced to return it or use it as intended. The law doesn't say that. You know, you can use a toothbrush to clean small crevices that are hard to reach, you aren't forced to use it to brush your teeth.
---
I remember the camp getting blueprinted if the spot is occupied.
---
And you have to build the the whole damn thing again
---
That's a good idea if they can reliably detect idle time on the server's end.  If you leave it up to the client to detect it and kick people, someone will invariably mod the PC version to prevent it.
---
I prefer the realistic ones where you can hardly tell if it's even a player camp from a distance. Undecorated &amp; empty forts, giant second-storey bases supported by one set of stairs and bizarre spots really don't seem to fit in the game
---
I dont know about that..we have a group, and we all bring out lowbie mules and alts and put.them in the bunker..we will have 7 or 8 in there..we can still drop the bitch in about a minute and a half..we time it, our record was 1 minute 18 seconds..if you are lowbies and on PC, add me ign is mitzelplik. You are more than welcome to leech off us..we make sure everyone gets their hits in before we drop her.
---
It generally is much easier when you're by yourself. Try the easier one if you're having trouble. It starts near Groves Family Cabin in the top left corner of the map. It's definitely the easiest one, I've been able to finish it multiple times on my own, and I'm usually horrible
---
I've haven't tested this and am not arguing,  but it only said can't be pacified didn't say anything about taming
---
If you contact Bethesda support around the day you bought it, they have been pretty good about returning atoms.
---
Make sure your vendor is attached to power. Check whatever wires it‚Äôs attached to.
---
If powered it will appear like the other vendor camps in the map, but yours will be yellow.
---
[deleted]
---
Request that might be easy: Technical Data potential spawns in the overworld?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Trickier request... And this may be a challenge you're wanting. Deposits closer to another deposit than the diameter of the camp area. Places where 1 camp can put down 2 extractors. Lead and junk is good, but acid and junk would be my ideal camp location I believe.
---
Just eyeballing it and looking at your deposits map, it looks like there may be only 3 locations on the entire map with what I'm suggesting. Lead and Junk north of the butterfly, Iron and Copper east of Vault 76, and Acid and Lead north of Lake Eloise and the bear. I would love to be told I'm wrong. :)
---
And lastly, yeah, these maps are incredibly useful. Thank you to you and all those assisting these efforts for their hard work and time.
---
Right near the overseer camp
---
Server already checks idle time for a general inactivity kick?
---
Dont pay more than 2k one at all, some people still think that its worth 5k+
---
Damn, I was going to say hardware. Probably still is. My stuff on PC is stable. Maybe your machine?
---
If you could keep me informed about what's happening with this bug I would greatly appreciate it
---
Been around since beta and honestly man there is nothing rare left in the game anymore except that one guys old man winter mask on Xbox but even that probably got duped during the recent wave. I think a lot of people resorted to duping because of bad rng in the game not justifying it but desperate people do desperate things.
---
Monorail! 
---
Monorail!
---
Thanks my dude!!!
---
Hmm well idk what its worth tbh i have 2k rn im on ps4
---
Ok, and this will sound dumb coming from me but, anyone know where I can find a chef hat?
---
My All Rise got shredded today.
---
+karma That went well. Thank you!
---
Report the circumstances, if you have an idea about how the dupe happened, to Bethesda. Don't continue trying to dupe. Move on with your life. Enjoy the single free dupe. 
---
Repeating it is against the ToS. Accidentally finding a bug is not.
---
Let me get in on this too
---
I‚Äôve made at least 20k from player vending, simply by selling stuff I already had. Granted, I hoarded a lot of crap (had to dump about 70 pounds of basic plans on some low levels just to make stash space), but 400k is definitely attainable.
---
Gotta earn Possum badges to buy them from vendor I think
---
Weird. Most likely a bug. Have you tried storing something to reduce your camp budget and pricing your weapon again?
---
Do u sell lotion and tissue products? Also like the name wish I could go but I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
[This](https://i.imgur.com/OJUUyUDh.jpg) is a World house and not player built right?
---
I‚Äôd swear some were at the Possum rank vending machine, but can‚Äôt confirm.
---
Oops. I don‚Äôt think we can give karma here. :)
---
Dang man gonna be hard finding 5.
---
Just have them unlockable through plans for a hard event, and make them buildable like the brahmin feeder.
---
Limit of 1 per camp, shared across the various animals. Require the relevant taming perk to build, like how turrets require home defense.
---
Have it cost resources, generate something, and repairable when your living whatever dies.
---
So for your deathclaw you get a deathclaw feeder that takes yao gai meat and stuff to build/repair. And over time it generates some item. I am thinking either gears/titanium like deathclaws normally drop, or something else like deathclaw eggs, or other random creature's meats. 
---
It feels much less complex bologna that is easy to understand. Get plans, build the thing.
---
I‚Äôll kill myself again!
---
It‚Äôs not that they‚Äôre broken, they‚Äôre just flat out bad. Why use a flamer when you can use a ranged weapon that can shoot more than two feet in front of you?
---
Yeah I really hope they fix this. Just do away with inspect all together and have the effects always show.
---
Thanks man lol
---
Yeah. Even tried switching weapons, switched in to chems. Nothing
---
It has to be a single npc spawn at a random encounter site, and the creature has to be half your level or less. Some fall under one set of cards or the other, just switch and see. If you come upon a critter that doesn't attack you, there's a good chance it's tamable. I strongly recommend loading a bowl, popping some corn, and server hopping the encounter site closest to your camp until you find something you like, or your nose bleeds (whichever comes first).
---
I do actually have a lot of tissues, but no, not selling those right now.
---
Jump from the suspension bridge at Charleston herald hq. You both need to be in the water. The drop there is perfect for going down but not dying.
---
On the locomotive....
---
They used to. Now they're in the exploding energy weapon limbo. Only two TSE weapons I've found were both flamers. They're awesome until they break after 10 seconds and you run out of ammo.
---
Yea its not even a joke, its just something that didn't happen.
---
I'm good, I'm fine waiting since I have like 16 mutton meat pie recipies
---
The mats were way easier to get in Fallout 4 with smart perk investment and it was  way less of a grind.   Strong back perk enabled you to fast travel while over encumbered. You could kill every enemy, take ever single piece of weapon and armor, and travel back to your based. Then with scrapper perk maxed out, you could get aluminum copper, springs and more by scrapping weapons and armor.  
---
In Fallout 3, you only need to find another weapon of the same kind to repair it. If your shotgun was broken, all you needed was another shotgun to repair yours.   If you wanted mods for your weapons in Fallout 4, you only needed the right perk investment. In 76, you have to keep scrapping guns to get the mod for weapons. Same goes for armor. 
---
There is no doubt that Fallout 76 is a far more tedious grind. It is objectively true and not even open to debate.
---
Just kill the handysoutside of the vault
---
Head to Colonel Kelly Monument. Near Site Bravo. It's a good spot and check the benches. Server hop until you find a body
---
Do you still have him?
---
I have a gunslinger build using a single action and take down supers with no problem.
---
how do you sort spawn location..cos i move my little camp thingy to numerous places but still spawn in random location when i travel to camp..and the fast travel welcome mats dont work in my camp..but they work at a workshop
---
Does not sound encouraging.
---
Same here except it's happening with my fermenter after putting a bunch of stuff in the vendors.
---
Exactly. Offer things that are desirable to a significant percentage of players, price them to sell, and you will have a steady inflow of caps. 
---
As opposed to offering basic plans nobody wants for hundreds of caps, or something like that... which seems to be what most people are doing.
---
i just jumped off the roof of my camp..which is pretty high..worked for me and my friends..just take a radx if you have bird bones
---
They already wrote those delete queries and can re run them at any time.
---
Which one? There are many train cars
---
I think you‚Äôre missing the point.  The people that are on here are either lurking and see everything, or avid users of the sub who come for USEFUL information.  This isn‚Äôt a useful question, it‚Äôs a question that can‚Äôt be answered by anyone unless you play it for YOURSELF.  Not to mention, Bethesda has a website that literally has every piece of new information and can simply be read by that person if they want to know what‚Äôs new.  It‚Äôs completely stupid the mods are still letting these posts be a thing.
---
Well damm how am I supposed to make it allergy season
---
Better idea: Let multiple people use the same vendor at the same time, the same way Elder Scrolls Online does.
---
I made one similar to what you requested. Check in the original post
---
another hofix needed..i guess the 2 we had in the last 3 days couldnt fix this issue..lol
---
Joining
---
yea. xb1. not an excuse though. if I can play Apex n fortnite without a crash I should be able to play this. no excuse for billion dollar game company. the only game this happens in. 
---
*sigh* still playing though, freaking love fallout.
---
There's around 20 total plans for that mission. You mostly get them for saving 3 brahmin.
---
i"m not upset I am very happy I just dunno about keeping my vendor
---
Front
---
I have another one for you.  My CAMP is just South of The Burning Mine and I tend to take the road East towards Lewisburg to visit the Legendary Machine.  Just where the roads split North and continued East, a random spawn occurs.
---
I have encountered Sheepsquatches, Sheepsquatch nests, Responder corpses, a Greaser‚Äôs corpse, Mole Miners with Aluminum deposits, and maybe a few other things.
---
There is no possible way for a vendor to plan around this because the vendor's spawn location is different from everyone else's.  This is a flaw in the game design, and not the fault of the vendor.  Bethesda needs to fix this, not the person who built the camp.   And no, I'm not talking about sneaky design choices that make you fall off a cliff when you spawn. I am talking about spawning inside the floor and getting stuck there.
---
Found something better, or not doing 2h melee?
---
2 for me. Glowing meat steaks with a side order of cranberry cobbler. Simple, yet oh so melee wondrous!
---
I imagine this is a limitation of the engine, being a bit of a Frankenstein and all that.
---
ESO has more of an MMO style engine which would allow for this kind of stuff, with the obvious trade offs in combat etc.
---
For sure
---
I hate to say it but what did they expect when they opened player vending?  Of course the sharks would come out to play.
---
I had a three star drop that‚Äôs better.
---
On top by stack
---
Also check your camp budget. Pets take up chunk of space.
---
iv had 4 endless load screens since the hotfix we had today..4 in a matter of 1.5 hrs
---
That thing is a beast too. I have a vampires one too.
---
Same. Think it may be bugged for me. Thank you for the replies.
---
That's not what's being discussed.
---
Well done on the name
---
Holy fuck! You are my hero.
---
He's here!! Just got it!!! Bout fucking time
---
Gt?
---
I keep saying this: I have never beard anyone speak in this game. I have a mic and I have tried speaking. I don't think people can hear me. The whole interface is broken. There is no mic test. Nothing that shows you it is working.
---
On the engine that is just outside the south gate.
---
Yep but no longer grabbable from what I read
---
I was in the middle of selling some loot last month and the server disconnected, when I restarted the game I had my loot and the caps from the sale. It was weird, I reported it but it didn't happen again the next time I was disconnected so hey free money once.
---
Good for you man.
---
World full
---
Pay it forward if you show up!
---
We really need that fast travel mat that‚Äôs possible in workshops. I would plop one down right in front of my vendor.
---
Basically multiply the odds by the number of items per category.  so if the odds are .5% and there's 5 items in the category the odds for the category are 2.5% in total.
---
I can craft it for you. IGN: jchamlin
---
Or take a trip to my Inventory!!!
---
Gt:shadyrebob
---
You're not wrong! Level 235 spent 17500 on a recipe I was missing. Started to get nervous as I was near max caps and had a 10.5k furious explosive handmade in my vendor. Decided I needed to sink some caps fast
---
I was in an endless loop of BGS having me contact MS and visa versa because I'm on XB1. It became not worth my time for $15.
---
I will stay here
---
Damn, sounds like hell. Sorry for your loss.
---
Awesome
---
Check your local vendors. I have healing speed and marsupial at 1000 each. I‚Äôve seen them at 500.
---
And then ammo is farmable in Saugus Iron works
---
Lastly don't forget the oppiest gun of all guns. Sgt. Ash that could make enemy legs obliterated in a few second
---
‚ÄúUseful‚Äù is subjective. A seasoned player may not find a post by someone who has only been playing a few months useful but someone else may find it useful. 
---
What it sounds like you are really trying to say is that those who have been around this subreddit the longest have some sort of right to determine what should/should not be posted. 
---
Isnt that upvoting/downvoting meant is for? 
---
If you dont like a post downvote and move on,
---
Well I have always just tinkered with mine until it sorts itself. Putting it up high seems to work. As a person has informed me below it‚Äôs a random Bethesda thing. No vendor fault as I previously stated
---
If you have a 3 star weapon (or armor) purchased chances are it may have been duped.  I‚Äôve acquired several weapons and semi decent armor through vendors and players and i can tell you that 3 star AAE handmade was likely a dupe at one point.  God knows it‚Äôs virtually impossible to get it through a legendary drop.  I have gotten a few decent 2 stars through drops but it‚Äôs few and far between.
---
Sorry.....ok so you get disconnected, a black window pop up, you need to press ok.    Load game join world.   Go to social, recent players,  what action needs to be taken now?  Thanks
---
Should be able to click a player and join world
---
iv never seen a legendary in the burrows..went there about 4 times..no legendaries so i dont go there.
---
People keep spawning in my closed of room with my generator in it. So i made them a door to get out :D
---
I will try again next time.   Looked like add friend was only action
---
Might not be worth your time meeting up with me. I can't drop a fixed camera and you can't fix a broken one until you get the quest, so..
---
Bethesda needs to fix it,  not players
---
Oh I sat down? Let me take a minute to stand up while a suicider is about to hit me with a nuke. Oh yeah I do not fear him
---
Absolutely! Can only hope
---
It's really not a big deal, if you are that worried about it, just add 10% to your prices, boom fixed. Seriously though it doesn't seem like anyone cares though.
---
Yeah or put them in a new category altogether..
---
Has anyone listed them all online somewhere yet? That‚Äôd be easier than going into the menu every time
---
Most/All games have issues that can be exploited. WoW has exploits all the time, and they've been doing it for about 15 years.
---
ikr..i dont see why the ft mats work at a workshop.but not your camp
---
There‚Äôs two daily quests (build a personal computer in your camo to easily activate them, and Bivs quest too), and there‚Äôs the event. The event spawns at Camp Adams, just north of the Nuka Cola plant on the left side of the map. 
---
It only shows up from dusk till dawn, but nights are so bright that you can hardly tell the difference. Just server hop Adams roll it pops up, which it will do as soon as you spawn in.
---
The event has a very long timer, so I recommend spending the first few minutes spamming people with invites like I do. There‚Äôs also a ton of pauses in the event where the robot talks, which you can use to continue inviting people. Sometimes a ton of people show up, and that‚Äôs cool.
---
Also, a tip. Don‚Äôt pick up the wet kindling. I‚Äôve failed a few because people just grabbed whatever kindling was in front of them.
---
Its just you
---
Any new system that allows players to interact with inventory lists is going to have to be bulletproofed because it can create these sync fails that result in item duplication.  Player vending is subject to the same problems.
---
Where is he at whitesprings?
---
I thought altogether might be one word but I wasn‚Äôt sure
---
That's awesome. Lol
---
yeah it can happen, there was a horde spawn that could lead you underneath, to an unreleased vault
---
I haven't seen a ton of complaints about it, so I'm thinking it's not exactly at the top of their list. I guess I could, ya know, talk to people or something until then
---
This is awesome. My first thought was, "when can they make a mod that presents in an in game display so you can collect your stuff without looking outside of the game". It'd be cool to even have a counter for something like, Camp plans, and each location you went to would dim out on the in game map representing you collected it, like a quest marker.
---
Something like the bandit camp in rust would be cool
---
Firecracker berry juice
---
Corn soup
---
Tato juice 
---
Soot flower tea 
---
Blight soup aren't too bad!!
---
Separate category would be perfect. Current system is a pain in the arse lol.
---
I don't know much that's been happening lately but I was playing a lot after the latest update and at some point I thought it was weird that I had some extra item that was insignificant. I thought wtf did I accidentally trigger some kind of duping or did I miss something... What happened?
---
Anyone who has fought her on a regular basis since launch can just tell.   To beat the queen you need at least three people with heavy weapons build with stabilized and one gun army perks.  One gun army has crippling effect which keeps her on the ground.  And keeping her on the ground as much as possible is key to beating her.  Also, if someone has built a camp in the area with turrets or people are standing on roof tops, she won't land as much.
---
I love the idea but, meh space. Lol. I carry too much stuff. XD
---
Ya i dont play consoles so its been over a decade since i went somewhere to buy a plastic disk.
---
Acknowledging they exist means you already knew the answer to the question. Why did you pass by them then?
---
I could always use a partner. Been outta the game for a few months, picked it back up recently. Ran a couple dozen nukes in the past, just looking to try out the new content with someone.
---
I believe so but I'm not sure how they were able to build so close to a pre-made house
---
In my opinion the pvp in this game is very unbalanced and for that reason only, i play adventure. However survival mode does offer a tense gameplay experience.
---
yes..talk to bethesda devs
---
there IS a mic test. if youre speaking (check the options to make sure youre not always in a team channel) therell be a mic icon somewhere near your HP bar.
---
Me too
---
I just wish when you tracked a challenge it showed up like your quests do.
---
See, a lot of people have said something in a similar manner, that there innocent of their ban (e.g. 900 hours guy) but when you scratch the surface you can see that their stories don't check out.
---
Let's even take it as truth you never duped, Bethesda isn't going to ban someone's account randomly for an extended period of time, especially if you've appealed. If anything, they've been a little too lax for my personal liking.
---
If you were banned to the point that you needed a new account, I'd say you earned that ban. Could be wrong of course but history has tended to trend to those that had banned accounts deserved it.
---
True.... However.. like I said I would have no problem if they deleted any illegitimate items I may have as long as it meant I didn't have to play in a world infested with other duped items.
---
Well, I don't have that issue. I know mods are allowed. I also know gaming companies are overly hesitant to ever declare any mod as OK in any regards.
---
Also, bans come in all sizes.
---
I‚Äôve tamed three animals now at the crossroads of Wavy Willard‚Äôs, Woods estate and Hemlock Holes. A Yao Guai, a cat, and a red murlok king
---
People need to know that the youtube content creators don't make as much money by saying a game is good. They need a dramatic thumbnail and since a AAA company like Bethesda had a rocky start it was easy to capitalize on. They over sensationalize the bad points of FO76 especially during its beginning. It then becomes a brainwash thing and people end up never playing or playing the game at a later time.  
---
  
---
Only reason I'm glad I started playing a month ago and not the beginning is that I wouldn't have spent any time with my family during the holidays. This game is very good and will only get better.
---
I don't have all, but I have tons of duplicates
---
I have a nuke zone on my world and I'm trying to get you some if you still need it
---
Yeah and my camp budget is only at like 60%. Not sure what the issue is
---
Just came in to say I love the title. Lol
---
I meant asking the players what the other attributes were, but that works, too
---
Thanks so much man.
---
Oh crap 5? Also I dont remember if I manually scrapped one out or if auto scrap got it. I'm pretty sure I manually did to reduce weight but id be careful either way.
---
Art imitating life, sadly.
---
They're all on me atm, sorry. I'll share in a bit
---
I found SIX legendaries while passing through harper's ferry just now. Three no-star mutants (although one regenerated health anyway), two 3* charred, and one 3* gangrenous
---
It's under "vintage nukashine" go down to v
---
Yes, but how is reclamation day bound to vault 76 only? Reclamation just means opening of a vault IMO.
---
lol..right..but there not always around
---
I have a few keycards but, I don't usually play til like 12am  or so
---
Main door on a red car
---
Tracked challenges should show up in a new pipboy tab. It would make things so so much easier. Plus it could list the components to them instead of havi ng to constantly go in the map, thru the lists and to the challenge itself
---
Legacy only... no longer drop.
---
i wish i knew the answer..
---
ive tried all the things people are about to suggest all to no avail..
---
ill be following this thread just in case.. gl
---
Im with you tbh.
---
It's obviously anecdotal, but when they changed it so that some of the ghouls are unruly golfers, I haven't seen them specifically spawn as legendaries.
---
It makes me wonder if the specific versions of mobs, like golfers or watoga protectrons, can't spawn as legendary.
---
Ill do a lot more than a few runs before assuming anything, but so far its been really bad RNG on my end since the patch.
---
I was able to put outside walls by building foundation and then the wall could be built and you could then delete the foundation. Might not work in your setup.
---
just added you. coming to browse your wares now.
---
Which brings us full circle lol
---
Agreed
---
What's a backback?
---
It's both a good and bad thing. People would exploit the shit out of that. Not to mention when something is "in a vendor" it's technically just stored in your stash. Just is available to be bought by ppl.
---
Oh crap. I never thought about that. So I guess bye bye to random plans and low level legendaries randomly showing up in train station suitcases.
---
To think that there was such a thing with the "good old days" of Fallout 76, where you could get free loot at ammo at train stations, nuke drops at SBQ and Whitesprings were plentiful and the SBQ quest was something people wanted to do over and over.
---
Whoops. The backpack!
---
Have you wired up your vending machine to the electric? I had the same issue yesterday and I think that was what fixed it.
---
Plans and stable flux, specifically cobalt and violet. Im a pistol/explosive build and am pretty much useless in nuke zones because of low strength and endurance.
---
Ahhh, well now Camps are immune to dmg from Players you aren't in active PvP with, so your Camp is safe. And if you build a Vending Machine (or 4) and power it people will be able to see you Camp, and the Visitors will start popping by üëç it's a nice change
---
As of 5/10/19 has the 50 limit been increased? I have some great ideas but would require more than 50 I think.
---
A town with lots of money is like a mule with a spinning wheel. Don't know how he got it and danged if he knows what to do with it.
---
Firearms are vats/stealth or bust unfortunately.
---
Combined barely holds a candle to melee.
---
I was surprised after being away for so long that there was no change in that balance point.
---
"Back in my day, we had to launch nukes to earn badges."
---
What if they would? Why would Ebay care about them?
---
Yeah all are wired
---
Except if its news about Metal Slug I love Metal Slug and MS developers are really silent while the gaming journalist delivers the news for them
---
Are you still there?!
---
 Strong back is one of the worst cards in the game.  Chances are you'll get much more value from travelling pharmacy or thru hiker, at a lower cost.
---
EBay wouldn't.
---
Bethesda should.
---
They can issue take down notices and eBay removes yje item.
---
Don't mind any amount of budget increase so long as it doesn't affect server performance.
---
Server performance &gt; budget/stash space always in my mind.
---
I‚Äôll probably still be around!
---
Awesome thank you!!
---
That‚Äôs what I almost did too. The carry weight is a huge increase, but I gotta have my meat for melee. I still have some from yesterday that hasn‚Äôt spoiled
---
You know, never played Metal Slug and I need too, they always looked fun, but yeah. There are some good reports out there, it just sucks having to go through them and find the good ones. To this day I still try to find an unbiased news source that just drops game news lol.
---
Imagine being this much of a dumb cunt lmao.
---
Currently I'm trying to place 2 walls and a door frame on an upper floor so as to close off the 3 story fall from the staircase. Seems like others are experiencing it as well. Glad they didnt mess up the foundation hack for greenhouses.
---
Would you rather hate the game for being laggy?
---
Developers have to draw the line somewhere on security vs performance. You can't have a maximum level  both, they're fundamentally opposed concepts when it comes to software design.
---
Dupe exploits are always made from exploiting verification things. The client makes some shortcuts or guesses that are usually left up to the server in order to reduce latency, at the expense of server-side verification not being as robust.
---
Personally I'm fine with the &lt;1% weirdo's looking for exploits than enduring horrible lag. It's not a PvP-heavy game, so yeah. As the game develops they'll slowly add more security depending on how aggressive the exploit users are.
---
Save your hate for Bethesda on the possible future - they having to put so much more fixes/security in that we get +100ms latency as a result. Like what pretty much every other MMO goes through in its lifetime.
---
Confirm
---
Lol
---
Hey man, I understand the frustration, but based off the comments, it seems you made this thread just to cause problems. Why not try to have a civil discussion about the problem instead?
---
Yep!
---
I'm offering 20k
---
Does it work in PvP?
---
I'm a bit hesitant to use it...
---
If is as good as you say I am bound to become reliant on it which usually means the next patch will have a note along this lines:
---
'Backpacks: Adjusted the fridge effect. *dev note:* we have found this feature to be overperforming and we felt compelled to hit it with a mallet until it became meh.
---
But winning is the only enjoyable part of competitive gaming. Losing isn't fun.
---
Source: bad at video games
---
Swing speed is pretty amazing for melee weapons.
---
I've had more happy conversations with people when popping by their camp than I've had the whole time I've been playing since Beta.
---
It feels so much more like a community to me now!  My friends list is growing and I'm loving seeing other players and their creativity.  It's been such a fantastic addition to the game!
---
I think our definitions of communism and capitalism are just different, I gather that you just mean a group of people voluntarily grouping their resources together, I think as long as they aren't forcibly taking other people's property away that's just fine. But if you ideologically believe that no one can own property and decide for themselves to engage in free market commerce with each other, then that is the line crossed where it has become authoritarian.
---
It times that are dire CONDUITS WILL SAVE YOU!!!
---
Let me telll you about conduits (I think they're Advance Power Connector Plan). With it you can build your power generator in the room with nothing but walls. Butttttt howw???? Easy there is a conduit that is wall pass through which makes it easy to cover and its easy for people not to notice it
---
My scout extra missions disappeared totally after a server crash
---
Similar issues but not the same. I suddenly hit my camp budget much more quickly than I did with my last one. Smaller main base, only two machine gun turrets, budget maxed. (Used to have a larger main base AND 6 missile turrets and 4 spotlights. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)
---
Made 3 and nope
---
 My shop is in the mire and I did over 20k in sales yesterday.  I see your point though.
---
I love Harpers Ferry, both thematically and loot-wise, but I'd love to see a clip or anything showing that the unruly golfers can still spawn as legendary, just for my own peace of mind.
---
Harpers is always better for me when super mutants own half of it though, sometimes they're just not there.
---
I saw a comment on it and can't recall where now (it was during the first day when I was waiting for the update to download), though after looking on the official known issues list ( https://bethesda.net/community/topic/319566/fallout-76-known-issues-and-feedback?language%5B%5D=en ), it seems that the bonuses applied by over repair may have always been a bug (which would make this not actually a nerf, but instead having things work as intended).  Evidently it was something they forgot to list in the patch notes (not sure if they have since updated them with a correction or not).  My hope is that they will address the issue of how unusable things like the chainsaw are now that they have corrected the over repair issue (as I can understand not wanting to buff them prior and suddenly have all melee focus only on these few weapons).
---
Would you like to bet a ‚Äúdime?‚Äù Because of reasons. üòà
---
That is just a dumb equivalency. If you use the toothbrush to commit a crime, it's not the manufacturer that will be penalized. If you shiv someone with a toothbrush, it's no ones responsibilty but your own.
---
You have to complete the pioneer scout quest to unlock the crafting of backpacks
---
Soooooo bad news.  They don‚Äôt drop from DC‚Äôs.  You find them in open world containers, meat bags, and occasionally they‚Äôll drop from creatures.  It took me hours to figure this out.
---
Found the salty one.
---
Got it. I figured it could have been that, but I wasn't sure. Thanks!
---
Umm, all butts and no face?
---
I made my .38 free, but a visitor suggested that I charge 1 cap. To me 38 isn't worth 1 cap. Maybe 1 cap for 10 rounds. I am glad to hear that others are doing this. Next time I log on, I'm going to change it back to zero. I just want to be a good citizen, not make a bunch of caps. I now pick up ammo that I would just leave, just so I can put in the the machine. Its worthless to me and if it can help someone else then they can have it.
---
Agree - all self -deprecating jokes about my CAMP aside, the changes are awesome.  I‚Äôve been a huge fan of 76 since launch, and these changes mean Red Dead 2 and No Man‚Äôs Sky will continue to be neglected and accumulate dust on my XBox.
---
I saw they dont drop from dc but someone said they could be found in nests is that wrong? And did you end up getting 5?
---
That's a pretty good roll, honestly. Definitely one of the best machetes for a non-bloodied build, besides maybe Instigating, but only if Instigating consistently oneshots.
---
IGN: ChemicalsCollide93
---
I am not a man. And no, I pointed out the obvious. I‚Äôm not interested in civilly discussing why it‚Äôs absurd to value (what, even? Extra caps? Real world money? What?) over the experience of every person who manages not to cheat and fuck up server stability.
---
Some places let you. One of my characters is in a rest stop. It has a working (will spawn) nuke cola machine.
---
Never found them in nests either.  And hell no it‚Äôs the bane of my existence haha!  I‚Äôve abandoned it and am just hoping to randomly find them now.
---
Sending request now. Can you join on me please?
---
My favorite mod for fallout 4 was darker nights. Along with better flash lights and true storms. These 3 made the game a much more immersive experience let alone intense. Not everyone's cup of tea though but hoping darker nights are a least an option one day.
---
Will do.
---
lol. You actually think that anyone believes every shitpost on this stupid subreddit is from someone who plays the game?
---
they are facing outward.
---
Umm did we ever in this game or you thinking fo4
---
That's my experience too. It would be nice to say thank you or hello when visiting another's camp.
---
Np
---
K
---
Having now found that it was a bug fix omitted from the patch notes, while I entirely agree it makes the weapons unusable that doesn't make this a nerf (nerfing is done with intent based on balancing etc, this is a bug fix so things are functioning as they were intended...though I completely understand that doesn't make it any better from the perspective of players).  Hopefully we can push for actual balancing to make these weapons viable now that the issue has been resolved.
---
If it's unlocked for you. It doesn't seem to show up for some people.
---
I just bought that plan the other day for the switches and saw all the conduits got unlocked as well. I got it off one of the faction vendors in Whitespring. Just gotta get the hang of the conduits now.
---
Kill -&gt; Loot -&gt; Return
---
Love the fallout 4 reference lol
---
Interesting, what would you say to a Yao Guai Roast that'll give you the healing of both of those steaks combined while also giving you +15% melee damage or a Mutant Hound Stew which will only cover 60HP but still give you the +15% melee damage?
---
And that could also be used for trivial duping. Put anything there, then another player opens the container. You log out, while the other player grabs the stuff. You keep yours and other player gets what he took, took.
---
I have 5 now if you or anyone needs it
---
Damn guess im giving up this badge until bethesda fixes this
---
Yup. It‚Äôs low cost but exceedingly low chance of the exact thing you want. That said it‚Äôs a high probability of someone in the vast community getting something good each day. Even picking your base item wouldn‚Äôt result in ‚Äúeveryone having god tier items‚Äù anytime soon but it‚Äôs easier for Bethesda to buff than nerf.... if anyone is still playing by the time they do buff.
---
Plans. Fuel and cryo cells. If there is a sweet weapon that matches my build, maybe.
---
It‚Äôs not really a ‚Äúfix‚Äù, it‚Äôs hilarious cause I‚Äôve probably scrapped SO MANY and now I can‚Äôt find any lol.
---
Cant really hate the player because the game is bad.
---
Yeah they are janky. I tend to avoid them cause I can never get them straight then I see them crooked and get frustrated. I might have a mental disorder.
---
Ptt works fine for me, I bound it to my side mouse button 
---
Before ptt I had it on open mic and just muted it when I wasn't talking
---
Fair enough! I got it on PC for Christmas. Got a case thinking it was a physical disk for installing the game.
---
Nope, cardboard circle with a download code on it. XD
---
Well I mean DC hide should drop from DC
---
This post should be a lesson for life. It's not about making money, its a second job that you love. People should seek this kind of gratification out in the real life work world too.

There were some vault dwellers who struck out on their own, leaving the desolate Appalachia behind, hoping to find a future brighter than what they found when they emerged from Vault 76: the plague-stricken remains of West Virginia.  Others took it upon themselves to clean out wave after wave of a seemingly unending tide of feral ghouls awakened by the post-war nuclear blasts.  Yet others still chose instead to build new homes, new towns, and even entertainment, ranging from bars to bizarre makeshift carnival games.
---
My furious Flamer took out a Mirelurk Qween with only 57 ammo.
---
Oh, I thought I accidentally used my atoms on those. Lol
---
Saw this couple hours ago. Hope is not lost
---
This is something I'm just gonna have to see for myself sometime, are you on Xbox?
---
I've spent last 2 days server and base hoping. Absolutely love it. I've seen so many bases from just wtf designs to lazy here is everything on some platforms and even some that felt like actual shops built on roadsides. I've even fast travel to a few that I think were supposed to be traps but failed.
---
I've sold a few thousand worth of goods, I've bought a few thousand worth as well.
---
But the base touring is the best!
---
I have a Responder base near Morgantown, offering homecooked meals and drinks for free, canned goods and chems at a very modest price.  I like to run in Survival, spending most of my time hunting and gathering.  Don't get much traffic yet, usually just folks camping my base to kill me when I get back üòÜ, but yesterday I had one such camper allow me to respawn unmolested as they checked out my base.  Got a heart emote before they went on their way; encounters like that make Responding well worth it üòÇ.
---
I spent about half an hour trying to even out the pictures on the walls in my camp. Smh
---
I‚Äôm so weak at this game my camp is located on one of the golf courses and I always get freaked out when the scorchbeast is around and I always get attacked by either ghouls or liberators twice my level and they fuck my shit up all the time
---
I will stay on the server for awhile incase anyone needs him!!! üëçüëçüëçüëç
---
This is so wholesome. Thank you!
---
Back in the BETA there are fast travel mats in camps :)
---
Ya, they do exists. I drive by one on the way to work, They just sit out there hanging out. All they have is a short regular fence and no guards outside. Some times there is an idiot that walk off but he gets caught and then put in a higher security prison with another X amount of years to serve. Only the dumb do this, kinda like dupers.
---
It's a hard life living in such a great location. Scorchbeast hasn't happened much since I started playing again. If Scorch does happen I have Nuka Grenades for it. When it lands, Demo expert 5 and just throw some on it. Works pretty well
---
Yep. I was rolling around with about 800-900 pounds, and it got to a point where it restricted my movement like with Fallout 4 over-encumbrance. That‚Äôs when I woke up and realized I had a problem. Been clean ever since.
---
Yeah that'll keep happening. You may want a spot further out from anything
---
I really wouldn't know.  My interest in this subreddit begins and ends with figuring out why the download happened.  I finally got Bethesda's attention elsewhere, but by all means, give me another vulgar response to flag before I close this.
---
I believe they've thought of this already, as ive noticed you get kicked out of the legendary grinder machine if u idle for like 20 sec... i was trying to find the right combo of items to get the full daily scrip and I got booted.  Try it yourself but it's happened to me twice.  I imagine mama murrgh will be similar
---
Hey do you possibly have any tips on getting possum badges? I really want my storage upgrade but all the possum world challenges look tough.
---
Not bad for 1k free experience with few secs of replacing the camp :)
---
Alright thanks man, I‚Äôll add you. PSN same as u/?
---
Did you get my request?
---
Same happened to me yesterday. This gives me a little hope. I'm afraid I've lost all of my progress and items. I hope that they get this fixed. Thanks for the info.
---
Which system ya in I have couple mods for it on xbox1
---
No I did not.
---
After all Fixed now ?
---
Sorry - I think my server was having issues. It just disconnected me. I‚Äôll login and send another request.
---
But how? I'm looking at the "Controls" section of the menu and I swear I'm not seeing any inputs available for PTT or anything that resembles it
---
Server hop the campfire event. I spent the better part of the day grinding the event. The badges are a random reward.
---
Nice! Good to know, makes me a lot more optimistic actually.
---
Got lucky, the rail side was held by ghouls and the church by mutants. Scorched seem to have something like a .5% chance to be legendary, and even then I have NEVER in 350+ hours of playing seen a 3* scorched
---
I'd assume, as buggy as 76 can be, that multiple people could purchase the same item at the same time and be used to dupe items. Also itd be very lame to be at a vendor, see your dream roll and some rando walks up and snatches it before you can accept.
---
I was planning on redoing the camp anyway only a couple things got damaged. Was satisfying to see that xp and the orbital come down but died after weak armor usually wear power armour for fights like that.
---
what category do serums fall under? Aid?
---
PC.
---
Neat.
---
And to think i almost scripped it.
---
Yep
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem to be going through. I sent it to ChemicalsCollide93. Is that correct? Maybe try requesting me Rytlok
---
But I like my convenience lmao. I‚Äôm getting there. I just started playing regularly so I hope it won‚Äôt be an issue for too long
---
Moot statement. Technicalities is not what I'm trying to argue. I just want the most fun weapon back. My build is going to waste
---
Nice spot man! Thanks for the armor and handmade :)
---
Yeah same here I want the high capacity next so I can swap out when my fridge pack is full.
---
It's at the bottom of the list IIRC
---
Nope.  You're going to have to wreck out your bathroom.  No poop for you.  But hey, there's always someone else's bed if you really gotta go!
---
Hey, you wanna be like rest of the consumer sheep getting shit on and wasting money on garbage regularly, knock yourself out.  I'll remain cautiously optimistic and won't believe shit until I actually see it.
---
Yeah add me: CaptainModrah
---
We just want to damage back. Make them viable again
---
Same, except with buzzblade. Entire build to waste.
---
"i don't like the game, so i'm going to ruin it for people who do" is probably not the greatest excuse tbh
---
No problem. Thanks for comin!
---
I'm on to your tricks now son
---
whats the hit you take on carry weight for it? im 3 badges away after making rng angry at me today
---
Yep. My name on PC is nmprogue. Message me so you can jump on my server and get some serums.
---
Yes. Additionally, all armor got a 1 ballistic dr bump.
---
Sorry for the late reply, but I can't find a vendor that will buy it
---
Yeah, it's kinda tedious to navigate all the way there just to check progress and next steps etc.
---
I was thinking of opening a newbie shop near the overseers camp just cheap purified water fully upgraded cheap weapons and ammo and diluted stimpacks and maybe a serum or two just for the new players to want.
---
What's a duper and what are they doing to the game? I don't really often follow what's going on
---
Awesome diorama.
---
I‚Äôd say, sold!
---
I‚Äôm on PS4, but thank you for the kind offer! üòä
---
This should be the universal thing to let someone know their prices are absurdly high.
---
It‚Äôs good.
---
Meanwhile the advanced cryonics tech enabled Notbanned_ to live and wake up 204 years later and eventually met the time traveled Notbanned_ from the past in the same timeline. The encounter created a temporal paradox that erased Notbanned_ to non-existence ;D
---
Just kidding, good job in RP with good story :)
---
I'm not so sure it's the server doing the checking there.  Does the server really need to know if you're flipping through vendor menus but not interacting otherwise?  I've never tested it.  If you're moving around, the server needs to know so it can tell other clients to move your character accordingly.  Honestly, I'm not going to set up a packet sniffer to see what changes.  My point was mostly food for thought, especially if server overhead is optimized heavily by offloading work to the client.
---
Lvl 101 and my main gun is still a 1* Instigating Lever rifle. 
---
I have an AAE Hunters for really big stuff, but it just doesn‚Äôt hit like my *Instigating Bitch* or have the Vats economy.
---
Yeah, found 1 last night in a countainer. Inside the camp venture basement where you drop off the technical documents
---
AA SS is very good and in fact best if you aren‚Äôt bloodied.
---
Really prefer it this way and glad there's no global vendor spam.
---
I got mine at camp Lewis, most of the time "swarm of suitors" event is there which should spawn them. Hope this helps :)
---
Don‚Äôt need the money! Ever Upwards my friend!
---
You get all the insects
---
I e never cooked anything other than grilled whatever I pick up lol. Not sure what the benefits are of grinding to find the stuff to create something. Following this post so I can see what interesting benefits some recipes have
---
What‚Äôs your PSN? I‚Äôd like to join sometime, mines: CaptainModrah
---
Ty sir you are a scholar and a gentleman! Take care!
---
Try the farm near the watoga train station
---
Yes it was the Snallygaster Spit Attack Explosion --- no one I've talked to had seen it before. Cool to know that others have it too. I guess I'll drop the price, lol.
---
I‚Äôm working on it. I don‚Äôt like wasting things in real life so I‚Äôm destined. Thanks üßê
---
Yup.
---
Those people don‚Äôt care about having fun, they don‚Äôt care about the experience. Hell, I waited until level 40 to enter the Mire because I didn‚Äôt want to ruin the experience for myself.
---
Bulking is necessary for selling (most of) your excess junk to vendors. There are a few exceptions to this though.
---
Just as a thought, keep your C.A.M.P. Device on ground level and as much of the structure as you can on a much higher elevation and it seems to help somewhat with folks materializing inside interior areas.
---
And brahmin, I saw someone had brahmin plans
---
I wish to see more shops without turrets in WS. I think the shops are too scattered out. Imagine we players could combine and create a big mall :)
---
Gotcha
---
You got banned brother
---
Amen to the man who just summed the whole thing up
---
Platform?
---
Yup, wish it was a combat knife but still great
---
It's been a problem. Bethesda said they will fix it
---
PS4
---
And your point exactly? That posts like these do nothing because people have and always will exploit flaws in a game? That the only actual way for these issues to be addressed is in fact not posting crap threads like this on the internet but for the developers to stand up and continue to patch exploits as they come?
---
Most shops I see in the Whitespring area. Particularly the train station it's basically the place you'll see the most players until they add more player interaction items
---
Same when I texted with bethesda support they said to try tomorrow and potentially it will work but they said ‚ÄúIn regards to your issue:¬†We are aware of an issue where a small number of characters are not able to load into the World Servers with a "Disconnected from Server" message.  If you are experiencing this issue, wait 24 hours and try again.¬†
---
While we work to resolve this issue, you also should be able to create a new character while waiting on the fix for the character that can't log into the game.  
---
If the issue persists, keep an eye on our Official Fallout 76 forums for updates.‚Äù
---
I like those ideas. I'm really enjoying the vending machines!!! I'm finally able to socialize with other players that aren't trying to kill me hah
---
But I gave up and traded for an awesome legendary Gatling Laser.
---
I don‚Äôt know what I did I just wanted to clear my stash so I can finally move after 3 months of being overcummbered
---
the way you type makes me think you have some kind of social deficiency
---
Alright thanks for the info!
---
Lake Reynolds, next to Lewisburg Station usually has one.
---
Will buy? PS4?
---
No I mean full on communism. Which only has one definition, and it isnt open for debate. If your definition is different than I described than your definition is wrong. Communism involves the abolition of private property. Not personal property. There is a difference. Personal property is your home, your car, your toothbrush. Private property is that second apartment you own that you rent out to someone else. Private property is that business you own, and make a living off of even though you are not contributing to the labor. Private property is saying that pair of boots that was made in the factory you own, by people youve never met belongs to you. Back to the whole Authoritarian thing, lets talk about Capitalism. 
---
Lets say I discover a new island never inhabited before. I decide that this is my land. I create a currency and start up a new capitalist society. In order to live on this island, you must pay for a portion of it that I sectioned off with my new currency. To get this currency you must perform labor to earn this currency. Since you are on my land that I claimed I decide just how much your labor is worth. Even though your labor is producing more currency than that. If you decide that you dont want to use this currency I created then you will be homeless, and probably starve to death, and cannot live on this piece of land that I claimed as mine. Sounds pretty damn authoritarian to me. This is what Communism aims to get rid of. Rather then one person owning the whole company, and deciding what each laborer is worth. Every laborer owns the company and each is paid depending upon the labor they put in. If you dont put in work. You dont get paid. You cannot get rich off simply owning land. Nobody owns the land. We all just live on it.
---
Much easier to earn caps, there is no guarantee you will get anything from the event, I didn't mind paying, no one shows up at the event any more ... glad I have the outfits ...
---
Have you seen the state of it lately‚ÄΩ Cleansing flame for us all!
---
Ah thanks.
---
Haaahahahaha
---
Is your friend a Beths' undercover agent? Seriously, just reset your router then try to log in. Can't really got banned for just 700 lbs of junks unless they are all duped items.
---
When the whole duping thing went around they implemented a system that tracks what is  dropped on the ground and the amount, not where it comes from, it‚Äôs possible you had an abundance of a certain item and when you dropped that it triggered the system, I could be wrong however and it could just be a bug
---
Do you have a key card?
---
Yes, I do
---
It's a bug. Reloading or joining a new server should fix it.
---
https://nukacrypt.com
---
I know him and see him at school he‚Äôs no undercover agent lol and it‚Äôs not my internet it‚Äôs the game
---
i duped in diablo 1 and if i played this shitty fo76 game i'd be duping in it right now. None of you should be supporting a bethesda game. Are you seriously all paying monthly for this? it's pay once play online forever right? ALL OF YOU are being DUPED if you pay monthly for a bethesda product or have bought the same bethesda title more than once.
---
Thanks for all that!
---
My main-issue is finding out what stuff is worth, like modded x-01 calibrated legs and stuff that you wrote as well like modded weapons.
---
there is often a queen mirelurk at the cabins when I travel there.
---
Not to sound lazy or pendantic, but tomorrow will be ideal for me.
---
Did you find someone if not ill hop on and help ya!? 
---
Psn yoraeh
---
so your saying duping is OKAY??
---
So, do I still need to find the pieces, or just use the code?
---
yes,changed with patch it seems.
---
Why is this so accurate except tgat there are the super computers and robots that also talk to us not just ghosts of the past
---
There's a few that spawn where you take the tadpole/possum computer tests.
---
Does 51 bulk of steel or 300 nuclear waste a huge abundance? Because I didn‚Äôt drop more than 51 of bulk besides steel and didn‚Äôt drop anywhere near 300 scraps besides nuclear waste
---
I'm on PS4 and hope to visit your shop eventually (PSN Onireynard =)
---
And also my friend dropped all the junk so I can pick it up on my alt character and he didn‚Äôt get any messages
---
If you have the keycard, just use the code.
---
Well alright like riding the rollercoaster backwards, i like the way you're thinking.
---
Will do. Though I won't be on tonight due to a buddies bday. I'll be on tomorrow though
---
Ahhh, excellent. Thanks a lot!
---
Another player for around 4k but I think it was a matter of lucky timing to find a good deal
---
I don‚Äôt think so, it would have to be at the least 1k
---
Keep in mind that the code changes every week. It may take a couple days but they're good about cracking the code.
---
It could just be a bug
---
Hold off the the quest for the All Rise
---
If you have an atom shop foundations  if you put that down everywhere cept for the one place you want them to spawn there you put a normal concrete foundation they will spawn there
---
I also melee my meat on occasion. ü§£
---
I'm not a duper never have done it but I love when people complain about dupers in fallout 76 as they play with their duped sentinel ,Cavalier, unyielding armor and all their tse weapons in tow and now most of the handmades that people want most of you dont realize is that most of everything in the game has been duped and sold and traded think about it all of these players with the hardest to get armor and weapons and most of the players have double and triple of everything sorry to burst your bubble to everyone in the game has at least one item that's been duped
---
I think the only reason to use it is if you are shooting the queen in the face.
---
 #fuckkipper
---
Why are you even on this sub? Go away.
---
On the other hand, if you happen to have an explosive gatling plasma, it turns it into a death ray
---
That is a mouthful of expletives :)
---
I was trying to figure out how to get the frog habitat to work. Also didnt know what the heck the stimpack diffuser.
---
Lol.  Rant of the year so far.
---
Bash enemies with it instead of shooting, seems to break a lot faster
---
Reminds me of Al's toy barn from Toy Story lol
---
Bash, bash and bash. Then bash some more.
---
Make sure you don't have any perk cards equipped that will slow down your weapon degradation.
---
the one with the robot in the water park "find the missing kid" she give you a lv10 10mm smg with fire dmg, but not sure if you'll get a better 1 if you wait it out.
---
Yeah can confirm this fixes it. Hop server and go strait to the vending machine, no more budget error.
---
The "first" holo  describes the location of the next box... Tower, river and fork are geographic descriptions of where he/you need to go to find the next box. This is supported by the fact he says "where was the other ONE again". The next holo talks about "bucket of bolts" and "unplugging it" which is probably the mayor of Grafton and/or the Grafton damn but he also said he needed to go up north and find them. Which means he could also be going to one of the farms in the northern area. Food for thought....
---
On my way to start the encryptid event yesterday, I found a 2* level 21 deathclaw that dropped a lvl 15 two shot 10mm pistol. You bet I ran around with that thing until I used up all 2700 of my 10mm ammo
---
oh duh. I didn't even think of that. thanks lol
---
why are you a sexist racist POS being duped into playing fo76
---
Nice!! After 4 days we get another Legendary Weapon if it's not fixed!!! In adventure!
---
Is this game worth buying? Yes. It's simple - Fallout 76 is being sold for less than $18 now, so even if you play it for one or two hours and then shelve it forever you will still have gotten your money's worth. Unless you have literally zero interest in Fallout, it's worth checking out at this price at least.
---
get a pc noob
---
Not 100% clear on what duping in specific means in this case, don't particularly care. But I fully agree that exploiters are the worst. It's also just sad that someone would need to cheat in this game.
---
Lol didn‚Äôt even realize! Awesome
---
I did thanks!! If you need to revive someone look me up.

It's -60 energy and radiation resistance.... kinda lame
---
Yep the other post was me I have 1100 hours on my character and now he's broken with no backpack
---
no worries, the event went great! keep your eyes on reddit, i'm gonna keep posting whenever i take a stab at this thing...
---
and if you ever want help with this event, send me a message! i'm really wanting some of the loot, and the more the merrier, right?
---
Do you sell buckets and buckets and fuckin' buckets and buckets of blood?
---
no loss to carry weight? if so hell yea, my Hleather will offset that energy nicely
---
This is the best ever!
---
Sorry I meant monster, flatwoods monster
---
No really, go away. üôÑ
---
Im only about 400 hours but yeah, ive tried with bethesda support and i got a generic response, tried replying but nothing in like 3 days now. Hoping if this gets enough attention one of the community managers will see it
---
Especially not if you keep murdering them things
---
On car right in front of main entrance where you spawn
---
Stealth sniper and sneak build ez üôå
---
Thanks guys, just found one at thunder mountain!
---
How do I get a cool colorful name next to mine?!
---
The ring came off my pudding can.
---
I know it's tedious but go fill out the support ticket at Bethesda net so they know it's happened to multiple people
---
Edit: I filled one out this morning no response yet
---
I'm not sure what it is but sometimes the vending machine weirds out when you're near your CAMP limit. It shouldn't, but it does. Delete a poster or a painting and you're all good.
---
That'll be the first thing I try when the challenge changes
---
I wanna get there. When I came back I was level 27 I‚Äôm 32 now and I‚Äôve only been playing for a few hours for 3 days trying to grind out badges
---
Xbox1
---
Oh oops are u talking about the refrigerator perk? I thought u ment for increased carry weight...
---
Not trying to be harsh mate, but perhaps yer build is not that good? üòê
---
Damn...
---
Actually not too long ago here on this reddit there is a couple that goes around looking at camps and sitting and interviewing the owners. It was as awesome. I can't find it now though.
---
Man I hope so I have barely touched the game since this bug I have just no motivation to play until this is fixed
---
The gritty Graham and Chally spin off we didn't know we needed.
---
Scout armor...  !!!!!
---
I have the lvl backpack and the mod made it -30 carry weight.
---
Mine's in the basement.  It's where I place the lotion on the skin.
---
Go through your inventory and physically look for the handmade gun model. 
---
There's a new glitch where sometimes upon buying things, items will rename themselves to something random. So your gun might still be there, just under a weird name.
---
I think you might be an hour ahead lol
---
I need those too lol
---
They might be milked out already.  Try server hopping.
---
Yeah i know what you mean, its just a pain bcs its such a small scale bug
---
You might not be able to do it on those cows. For others out in the wild, you can just press your action button on them. Don't have to be crouched, don't have to be behind them
---
Someone brought the whole Ghoul golf club to my front door....
---
i love the vending and selling stuff but i am having a hell of a time with utilizing my stash size, stuff needs to sell soon so i can have a spot to put my good junk to make more stuff to sell.
---
Can someone explain the NPC thing to me?
---
Is it the lack of human NPCs? If yes, I'd argue that such a thing is minorly frivolous. There ARE NPCs. They're mostly robots. They give you quests and rewards. Same as a human NPC. It feels nit-picky to say NPCs can only be human, that they are the sole non-playable characters of the world. The Insult Bot is something I cannot play as, and yet it is still a character with a purpose to fulfill. Maybe my definition of NPC is too broad? 
---
Is it the interactions with NPCs? I can't argue against this one as much. The interactions here are definitively one sided; I don't reply to the NPC with any kind of dialogue, nor is there any semblence of conversation. They react to your presence, but they only talk to you, not with you. 
---
Is it something I'm just missing? I don't really find this world empty. If anything, this is what I expect from a world-ending apocalypse. There's no one else but me (and a few others with whom I can interact with if I so choose). The only things left are the creatures hardy enough to survive and evolve to their current conditions, relics of the past, and whatever automated processes lucky enough to function.
---
If someone here is unhappy with the state of NPCs, tell me; I don't want to sit here and think that it's some sort of hogwash. I want to understand. If it's the lack of interaction, that I can easily understand. But if it's because they're not human...? I mean, does that make a synth... not an NPC?
---
They was banning players that didn't even dupe just cause they have a bunch of junk or some sh@#
---
I never do this. &gt;_&gt;
---
How?
---
Whoopsies is a disease?
---
Yup just about any rifle auto or semi will be dangerous if your build is legit.
---
Sell the Whitespring Station Vendor's bottles to him.  He puts them out there just so you can sell them back to him.
---
Up at the meditation event in the top of the savage divide. There is a crossbow half broken on a table.
---
Sadly, yes
---
Even though its an energy weapon it's fuel doesn't work with batteries not included on top of this. Legit only thing its used for is healing with friendly fire and even then its still sorta terrible unless your healing people or characters new to game.
---
Indeed, strong AF, my main is a sniper sneak build, melts everything
---
It's one of my main weapons. Sorry. :/
---
No worries
---
Lol thanks
---
This. I bougth one from a vendor back when they were trash, and it is such a glorious tool in mob situations like the robot adds during Encryptid.
---
I deleted 3 of those deathclaw hedges and it still wouldn‚Äôt work
---
i did mean refrigerated,  understandable though since they just came out and people are still experimenting
---
I'm having the same issue. It's the last thing for my Herpetologist badge.
---
You don‚Äôt need to fully break it. Bash an enemy to death and repair.
---
Thanks so much for letting me know, I'll go check it out!!  
---
And look at that -  it's my cake day! Woo hoo!!!
---
I would add into the ‚Äòyou might not want to come back to this game if you were expecting more QOL improvements by now.‚Äô 
---
I took a break around the beginning of January until yesterday, and it‚Äôs disheartening to see some of the problems that still remain. Stuff that just feels like a piece of meat stuck between your teeth. Most particularly, the base building system. Still hugely inflexible, and anything you build that‚Äôs not on a totally flat plain of land will look awkward. It‚Äôs unacceptable that crops are still floating off the ground, and fences can hover with two foot gaps until them. Shelves are still completely empty and useless additions. The build budget remains far too small. Not to mention the whole ‚Äòput a stairway in the wrong place and you might be forced to abandon your entire build‚Äô debacle. 
---
I guess one of my other beefs is a matter of personal preference, rather than being objectively bad, but I don‚Äôt think personal vending has been good for the game. The reason I say that, is the same reason that I think stuffing suitcases at train stations with free legendary weapons, armor, and various plans was a bad idea. You‚Äôre actively taking away things for other players to strive for, and hurting how much they get out of the game in the long run. 
---
After skipping round a few player vendors last night, it‚Äôs the same sort of thing - prices are usually way, way too generous. Any weapon that isn‚Äôt a legendary weapon goes for peanuts, and plans are available for a pittance. I mean, I found someone selling mutation serums for around 300 caps each. This is endgame tier stuff, ffs, and showing a mutation was a way to distinguish yourself. Now everyone can be special with ease, which means no-one will be. There‚Äôs no point in me even trying to get into vending, as it‚Äôs a race to the bottom, and becoming a weapon-smith/armorer/gourmet wasteland chef is unworkable with how little you‚Äôd get back in exchange for resources expended.
---
thats good to know, i appreciate it. +29 weight total and long lasting food on a level 50 pack is nothing to scoff at though
---
Build your camp on/near a water source.
---
Purified water is a great way to farm caps once you get the plans for any of the purifiers.
---
Yea! Which are the ones you have equipped?
---
With good with salt perk, the effect disappears in stats? If it stacked and we could get perma meat, that would be worth it.
---
My GF and I played Elder Scrolls Online, and I was waaaay more into it than her. Fortunately, ESO doesn't care about your levels, as everything scales.
---
Can we do that with FO76?
---
Or is it better to have two characters per person (one to play together, and one to futz around with) ?
---
Where do I find wild Brahmin?
---
Lol, people are still playing this?
---
I'd assume you get -30 carry weight just like the armored perk where u get +90 damage resistance and -30 carry weight
---
Same here.
---
Don‚Äôt know about feverclaw, but whoopsies comes from diseased Mirelurk hatchlings.
---
There are a ton of Mirelurk eggs at Highland Marsh. Let them hatch, and kill any that aren‚Äôt diseased then let the remaining ones chomp on you. Might take awhile, since it seems this disease is harder to catch, but you‚Äôll get it eventually.
---
My husband lvl 208 was almost wrecked by a vengeful Mothman earlier. Maybe they got buffed.
---
Thank you
---
I just serve hop and do WHITESPRINGS golfcourse...  Not sure if this helps
---
Really like it
---
If you're on mobile, go to the main fo76 sub feed, then click the three dots up in the right corner. It will give you the option to "change user flair" and you can pick one from the subs list.
---
thats the case, OP just ninjaed you on it. i appreciate the help though since im indecisive and more info always helps me out
---
Around point pleasant for the mushrooms, caves for the brain fungus
---
Good post.
---
Well shit, thanks anyway!
---
Yikes....
---
Thanks.
---
All my stuff in my vending machines disappeared today.. I logged off last night and then this morning I logged back on and everything was gone. No one bought it cause I wasn't online. Oh well not like they would replace anything. Thank God it wasn't any good weapons in the machine.
---
Not sure on how allowed it is to tag the community managers but if u/ladydevann could help i would appreciate it a lot
---
No problem, took me a long time to acquire this one myself.
---
Im curious to see if the vendor activity will stay at this pace, or if this is mostly just new feature hype. Ive made about 6k off just ammo and stimpaks and only played for a few hours the last two days.
---
Yet another reason why I'd love an offline mode/private server. 
---
Some folks enjoy games differently, sometimes those types of people don't mix well in an online setting.
---
Is the frog habitat actually counting for you once you make it? I ran all around got all the pics. Crafted the habitat and got no cred for doing so. I‚Äôve read I‚Äôm not alone.
---
You da best!!!!
---
Taxation is theft. FREE STATES!
---
I had given up on this one because I had assumed the recipes would be hard to find, thank you so much!
---
I'm a heavy gunner too, with the same problem. I have no problem with my 50.cal and gatling gun, but when I switch over to my quad tesla rifle, its only a matter of time before the enemies starts regenerating health again.
---
Theory: What if the voice is Wooby
---
Yea I tagged valseek in my post she is one of the community managers too
---
Lol no it's definitely still Bethesda's fault. Both are at fault, of course. But I've been gaming for a very long time and I've never experienced an mmo with this much ease in exploiting the game. It's atrocious.
---
Still there?
---
I'm expecting further tweaking as they get deeper in the Wurlitzer if life wish list. All manner of medics are pretty bad.
---
i did that, they didn't count
---
Ive had a few crazy ones so far, an AAE combat shotgun for 500 caps, a tse level 40 hunting rifle for 400 and a QE railway for 7000.
---
I‚Äôm looking for comfy pillows. Are these in stock?
---
üòÇ. Yeah, let‚Äôs not blame the ones that are actually breaking the rules right?  What a joke!
---
Morgantown Airport by the public event area has a handful of first aid and chem boxes you can rattle. Also, if you explore near Fraternity Row, there is what looks like an emergency relief camp where there are chems laying around and a couple chem boxes to rattle.
---
I know of a static spawnpoint for them. It's near Pleasant Valley station. When you fast travel there, turn left, and cross the road. Go down to the lake. There is another lake beyond that. At the second lake, near the left side of it, is a static spawn point of 3 brahmins.
---
Nice choice, MODUS is proud of you.
---
Welcome to our little Enclave.
---
Best place is flatwoods next to responders church. Theres 3 or 4
---
Also theres a lake in front of the top of the world station (pleasant something) you follow the wet mud (west i think) to another lake and theres 3 or 4 there. You can build a thing and have your own brahmin  in your camp as well
---
I‚Äôve been playing since the BETA and never been to the crashed space station. I hear I‚Äôm not missing too much though.
---
Yup. I was having an adult beverage and math hurts sometimes.
---
Yes sir!!
---
Lol, fuxk this game
---
Prob an outfit.
---
Any idea why the turret was indistructable?
---
And you got a video of this yea?
---
Cough cough vanossgaming cough cough
---
Then dilute them with chemist and super duper into 500+ diluted stimpaks, equip hard bargain, and get your max caps from the vendor bots :D
---
This is super frustrating. I've gotten lucky once or twice, where I've been able to place a blueprint. But 99.9% of the time, I have to tear down and rebuild. It's even worse now that I just want a decent place to set up shop!
---
Thanks coming
---
Found a tire iron today on a player vendor just like it for 400 caps.
---
It only has to be missing a sliver of life to repair it just bash it against an enemy and then rwpait.
---
You I was surprised to see a max lvl pack only give +60.
---
There have been various posts over the course of this reddit that point to your odds of getting a specific type primary affix if you are carrying more of that affix.
---
That is to say if you have 15 bloodied weapons, you have a higher chance of getting a bloodied weapon.
---
Don‚Äôt view this as gospel, because when your sample size in the hundreds and the odds are in the millions you may get some skewed numbers.  Sigmas and n-1‚Äôs and all that jazz :)
---
I often get nuclear waste/material from looting mole miners. Enemies turned to goo from plasma weapons also have a high chance of dropping nuclear waste. And as another redditor mentioned, dropping a nuke on Whitesprings is also a good idea if you are equipped for it.
---
Ooh, actually didnt think about that. I usually run through super mutant spawns grabbing all the assault rifles and super sledges to sell.
---
I don‚Äôt think the dry kindling spawns anything, the damp/moist/wet (I forgot) always spawns a couple ticks/radroaches. Very efficient way to get tick blood though, very helpful post!
---
The listings are broken right now.  Serums go under the AID tab, but they're listed as Misc on the map.
---
Have all my vending on top level so players can walk through and check out my entire camp :)
---
Got pacify on ?
---
Because it listens to me. What I do is what happens. Handmade, on the other hand, while being better at everything - is not as controllable as my combat rifle is. Try giving out 6 headshots in 3 second with handmade. With combat rifle? Ezpz.
---
Why? Because they exploited an issue that was in the game for so God damn long? After a certain point the blame starts to pass to Betheada. I hate supers as much as the next person, but don't act like Beth did all the could asap to stop it. They dragged their heels for MONTHS! Not days or weeks, MONTHS. 
---
If duping really has made a return, I'll be interested to see what happens and how long it takes.
---
First, wear something sexy.
---
Then, find a brahmin.
---
Next, show it a good time.
---
Lastly, try to get it all into the bucket.
---
Thanks for letting me know. I'll edit the post to change that real quick.
---
Nope. Just got my mirelurk photo, got the frog, made the habitat and nada. Ffs Beth.
---
Thanks for the downvotes, stay classy fo76
---
Sure gt: spcweapon
---
Looks like one of the datamined atomic shop outfits. It'll be available sometime in the near future, I suspect.
---
With all that rubber it should have some disease protection.
---
I can absolutely confirm that perk DOES NOT remove mutations....i used it to help farm each of my mutations to save my rad-away
---
Looks like nuclear winter special BOS outfit :))
---
I server hopped 5 times looking for that crossbow near the target range there and couldn't find it. The only reason I'm looking for it is that when I try to repair mine it doesn't give me the option. I made a level 15 crossbow and it had 150% durability when I crafted it.
---
The mode should offer game generated aid and caps and ammo for completion of kill but not from the player that was killed.
---
Whoopsies [https://youtu.be/RdoDA7l0ktY](https://youtu.be/RdoDA7l0ktY)
---
Thanks for the suggestion, that sounds fun will give it a go. :)
---
No I don't so basically I want to a camp got locked inside so was like ok ill destroy the wall and nope nothing so I picked a lock on a door to get out got wanted stepped outside got shit by turrets shot back ans nothing didnt even faze them I'm all good with no destruction in adventure mode but survival????
---
I kept getting killed and loosing the stuff I had...
---
Still here if anyone needs it
---
This happened to me with a legendary sheepsquatch, thought it was because it was legendary until it started happening with rank and file super mutants. Seems though if you can outpace the regen you should be fine, just means using more bullets
---
That too haha
---
Yep but people will down vote you for stating this. It either people too low level to so any real damage, people hiding for rewards and people that  are cheap with there bullets, they only fire 100 bullets the whole Time when I am shooting thousands.
---
Thank you!!!I found two there!
---
when u get the canvas bag will you swap them out?
---
Are you on PS4? I might have one stored on one of my characters, I would buy one every time I got capped on caps..
---
Lmao.....reminds me of that scene in Harlem Nights......pop pop
---
Yes they are useless now in PVE and its ridiculous a shotgun is supposed to shred it is a shotgun!  shorten range ok, reduce explosion splash ok, but nerf till I'm holding a wet noodle piss off.
---
find an explosive one, shit breaks like nuts
---
Power armor stops being useful once your armor is better legendaries giving you better benefits. The other day I was doing a scorchbeast queen and had to get out of my Power armor because I was overweight with it on!
---
Actually does anyone know when Cait's armor will appear? Has it even been datamined.
---
Me too?
---
Because this is the only problem with the game
---
If you listen to the scout leader, the scout badges we earn were invented since there were no scouts left. Making them for wasteland survivalists is the only honest thing to do. Good bot.
---
I've been there once and that was when I never knew i didnt need to kill officers for nuke codes.
---

---
 I dunno. All you people bringing guns to a knife fight just make me smile. ;)
---
Me too and three?  And four and five and six.
---
Each of these random encounter types is referenced by several triggers.  The XYZ coordinates are under "DATA - Position/Rotation" in each record that references the following encounter types:
---
RETriggerScene [ACTI:0002DFE5]
---
RETriggerAssault [ACTI:0002E507]
---
RETriggerTravel [ACTI:0002E503]
---
RETriggerObject [ACTI:0002E505]
---
If we could get different maps for each of these four types, it would be fantastic.
---
The bog.  I have this ditch digging business and I have made a killing here.  Expanding to the Mire and Toxic Valley next year!
---
In all seriousness i have 5 characters all 5 now reside in the divide:  the ruined pylon near the monorail elevator, clear field south of sunnytop station, curve in the road by devils backbone, the bee center map east of alpha, and a spot on a hill over a pond with a acid spot in the water.
---
Pylon and acid spot I lose out maybe 1/5 of logins lately.  Others are good but I‚Äôm debating giving up my views at the bee to move to the mire.  Saw a nice spot while roaming I‚Äôm debating checking out.
---
Love the views in the divide.  That is the selling point to me.  I don‚Äôt think Bethesda gets enough credit on how they built the world itself.  SO many great spots to build a house.
---
:( oh no
---
BTW rifles and heavy guns don't take the resources shotgun shells do to craft either. Plastic lead and steel in large qty for the shells all HG need is steel and moderate lead
---
They already told us this is how it worked.
---
This is amazing you are a legend
---
you still there?
---
Not sure- but maybe try hooking up a terminal to them and locking that?
---
No worries :)
---
What kind of comparison is that? Not even close.
---
A better comparison would be if a bank tells you they can't let you withdraw your money because they left the vault unlocked and someone came in and took all the money. The robber sucks, true, but the bank sucks more for not securing their product.
---
Im glad im not alone
---
Yes
---
She looks tyred...
---
No dummy it's to live the libertarian powerfantasy
---
me too. I think you'll be able to display them on a magazine rack soon, so I'm collecting them all to open up a comic book shop in the future with nerdy shit like the Grognak axe, and mistress of mystery items. I'm not sure if the name is taken yet, but I'm thinking "Atomic Comics"
---
51x30=1530
---
Nah you can still click them.
---
This is sweet! Give this man views!!
---
Big oof
---
Dang, just a thought. That does stink. :(
---
Interesting. But no. I did check. I'll have to keep that in mind.
---
The daily quest at dolly sods rewards them I have gotten firefly,tick,and blood bug so far.
---
I wish more people could have fun pvp dights like this instead of every time i claim a workshop that someone else wants the workshop gets nuked so that im forced to get into my power armor where im overencumbered and cant exactly fight back due to not having the +1 strength and +1 endurance buffs from my armor
---
The hashtag didn't work by the looks. Just make it bold.
---
Perks scrounger, pharma farmer (both luck) butcher's bounty (perception) really helped with my last play through. Kept me in ammo, chems (stimpacs) and food respectively. 
---
Make a friend. Makes everything better. 
---
Don't hoard. You only need a lot of resources for your camp. Focus on adhesive and screws primarily, secondarily gears, springs, lead, aluminum. 
---
Don't get attached. That weapon or armor, if it isn't a 3* God roll level 45-50 it isn't long for this world. In fact you learn mods by breaking them down. They come and go. 
---
Camping by water is good but still get a land or water based purifier. That with mutfruit, corn and tato plants and you have an adhesive farm. 
---
Learn all the plans you can, at least for free anyways. 
---
Do workshops for plans and resources, however it opens you to pvp so be vigilant of others.
---
God, if there a way to be a dick in games, people will do it.
---
 Never understood people like this
---
Dang! That is still terrible! But look at the stash space you have now.
---
We can scrap legendaries now?
---
Just the one

I know dupers who weren't banned, and I have a friend that's still banned to this day, even though he's never had 100k of anything, never duped.. doesn't even know anyone who did.
---
That's the thing, unless they cast a very careful net, they're going to catch some of the wrong fish. Period, full stop. I've seen plenty of stories of other developers in other games that made similar mistakes..
---
My friend, his life was fallout honestly. I played over 600 hours with him, I know him well.. he didn't cheat in any way. But Bethesda just ignores and closes any ticket he opens, no response.. nothing. He's given up. I almost don't want to play because I lost one of the people I play with. Haven't played for months until recently, and just have little desire to play by myself.
---
Well, wouldn't you know it! The game didn't like that I rebound my controls before the PTT was introduced and decided to hide it. It was at the bottom of the list after all. Thanks so much!
---
 He killed me at about level 26 or so and I was pissed. I have prevailed since then, in about 10 encounters, but he is kinda tough with his insane regen. 
---
 If you can get a melee stealth attack in and keep pounding, stabbing in my case, he goes down pretty good.
---
 I have used many different weapons on him, probably the Auto Grenade Launcher was the most fun, but its always good.
---
I've never seen this icon. The mic is default and it works in other things like Discord.
---
Ok
---
I didn't have enough CAMP budget to add in a terminal, as they take up a lot. So, I went to a workshop to test it out and unfortunately, attaching a terminal and locking *that*... does absolutely nothing. I even got my friend to help, and other players can still freely change the light box.
---
Hey! I hope you read this: 
---
If you bound your controls before PTT was introduced, you might want to reset them to default and then rebind them. The option should be at the bottom of the list. Hope it works for you too!
---
There's a walkway thing with a latter attached to it that they can be placed on the sides

Joining your server now gt : spcweapon
---
If memory serves me right, there are roughly eight locations the Purveyor will appear at.
---
Wack
---
If it was just to level up it would be nice. But it requires 3 parts. The level up over level 76 is easy but having to keep track of the other two suck.
---
Thinking on it, those were reflectors that concentrated heat to the tower in the center.
---
The towers water would heat up and turn a turbine.
---
Not quite as effective as a hydroelectric dam but eh..
---
Haha oh god
---
I liked the paranoid feeling when you never knew if someone would attack your camp or stuff. Felt like the we actually fighting for survival. Now its just a bunch of ppl wawing at each other lol
---
I have a set of PA but rarely use it. PA and fusion core spawns are everywhere.
---
I carry 2 cores, one at 100%, the other at 83%...if I find another fullbone, I drop the lower one. 
---
I haven't kept any armor nor cores for awhile 
---
BTW, I sneak in a hazmat suit in nuke zones.

Xbox1 Facepuncher85, just north of Camden park,  "The Dirty Wastelander bar and grill" I have 4 vending machines with outfits, chems, plans, also have lots of legendary weapons for sale thru me.. 3star anti armor fatman, 3star tse gause, 3star bloodied explosive gause, just to name a few.. come check me out or message me here or on xbox..

Not my lucky few weeks I guess.

I've tried this but after 9 times I still don't have a single damn badge

As a fellow responder I salute your commitment, even going so far as to respond to raider types
---
Same but people seem to get very very lost at my camp.
---
Fun for those who choose to hide behind a bug?
---
Wrong. I do not have any duped items.
---
No thr game is just boring now, i miss tbe chaos and the unpredictability
---
Yea that's true!! I had a bunch of mods that I had found, all gone. :-(
---
I think there are more peeps back in game and farming.
---
People complain about not much to do in fallout 76 but want free handouts instead of doing relatively easy quests
---
That's been going on for me for the last two weeks on xb1. It's like it's buffering it will take some dmg give some back then recalculates and gives some more dmg.
---
Say hello to my little friend...the radroach I used to trick you into PvP?
---
If we‚Äôve earned the rewards, we should be able to do what we want with them.  You can‚Äôt even *scrap* a backpack, much less sell it.
---
You could... hear me out.... go into survival..üòê
---
It would be, which is why Bethesda would need to have measures in place to prevent both duping and shared vendor inventory.
---
Im not a pvp player . I dont know why i enjoyed it actually
---
Well there‚Äôs a possum badge for collecting. You have to get all 5 unstoppables. So far I‚Äôve found one, and about 3 of every other mag series and version. I‚Äôve been hunting mags for hours.
---
Scraping it would just guve a few cloth. Not worth it. Considering its not legendary. It would just give less then 20 caps
---
Well you're in the bottom 10% then
---
So infuriating. Theres no challenge, why play a game just to cheat and ruin the mechanics? Wheres the fun? 
---
Then when they get banned they bitch n moan and act all innocent.
---
Next time fast travel away from the camp.  No need to become wanted üòâ
---
This is true. However, game design needs to plan and prepare for this, and Bethesda did not. These dupes are from Fallout 4. That means they knew they existed BEFORE developing 76.
---
*cue Fix it Felix voice*
---
Why do I fix everything I touch!?
---
Omg what a great idea lol. Its like they made it for a reason. One casual mode and 1 hardcore mode
---
You don't get fusion cores about 25% from PA frames since 2-3 patches back. I get plenty of good cores from other sources, but if you're running PA regularly then you may need to take a power plant.
---
Thanks for clearing it up for people how it works. Personally i have 800 ionized meat &amp; 1600 dog food i have bought since game launch so no need for it but , nice to know if it works
---
The more accurate analogy is: You go to chick-fil-a, everyone is getting two sauce packets for their nuggets, and some guy asks for 40 packets, and because the employee at the counter is new and doesn't know the rules, they give it to him. 
---
Nobody else is actually affected (unless they have to sit next to the guy and watch him eat 40 packets of sauce, I suppose). All that's really happening is some guy got more than everyone else by breaking the rules.
---
I‚Äôve got an extra from completing the challenges needed to become a Possum.  I‚Äôd rather get some cloth than nothing at all.  And I‚Äôm referring to selling it using player-vending.  It‚Äôs time-consuming to earn the mods for it, no doubt others would buy modded or leveled backpacks.
---
True that and no passive modes always off for me and well thats should he the point of survival dude I should be able to get my grief on
---
I hope we can just inspect stuff without all that hassle. All the items are in the games database
---
I know what ur says. We should be able to at least mod them for people
---
You rock
---
If you can't programm a game that prevents this it very much is your fault.
---
They nerfed them awhile ago. I used to live in PA 24/7 but once they nerfed them I run out. I only use PA in Nuke Zones, Encryptid, and sometimes the SBQ.
---
I made sure i got it, since i dont play survival lol
---
Never work. People would always be logging in without their camps on the world. I‚Äôm sure people around WS is having a tough time logging in to place their camp.
---
It's a tier of armor. Three different kinds exist, regular, sturdy, and heavy. It's mostly leveled (i.e most level 50 armor will spawn as heavy, most level 1 will be light if that variant exists) but you have to learn plans and mods for each separately. You also can't change it as of now, so whatever kind it is, you're stuck with it. It counts as a "mod", so a weightless heavy armor will still weigh the same amount more than a regular one would. That additional weight is not affected by the 90% less weight.
---
It was before but I think they patched it
---
I‚Äôd love to see it but the link doesn‚Äôt work. :(
---
It's usually not hard to get though. I am the filthiest of filthy casuals, and I get it most days. I just check the requirements as soon as I log on, and you can usually get it in one hit by wearing a certain item of clothing and simply being in a certain area. So I put on a nice frock, amble over to Watoga (or wherever) and do some stuff, the challenge procs and it get on with my play.
---
Yo you still on?
---
Been looking for them also
---
You don't know what you're talking about.
---
By any chance any one of y'all got silver ore I'm about to cry over here can't find enough boohoo

Wouldn't be so bad? There are a lot of people who think at all is too much.

No, its horrible! You should give it to me instead.
---
Real life Trading.

what system? I too need to collect for my badges, but my comic shop comes first, so I might be willing to do business with you as long as the prices are reasonable
---
Fuck that. Someone get this man a Puppers.
---
Can't speak to some 'resistance' thing.  People used to say that her health was based on the number of people.  Datamining disproved that.  So now maybe they're blaming things on DR or something increasing with people to discourage leeching.
---
Do a complete circuit of whitesprings with pharmafarmer and you'll be rolling in chems
---
Yup. Almost daily since Fay one of FO76. But about every hour since patch 9
---
I believe it's 30 more pounds for level 50, but there's supposedly resistance debuffs (damage and rad resists at -60).  I haven't verified yet, I literally just got the basic one before I logged out a few minutes ago (not enough mats to make the level 50 one)
---
Love it

‚ÄúDuping‚Äù is short for _duplicating_, and refers to when players utilise an exploit to double or otherwise increase the amount of a particular item in their inventory.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, that was my bad haha. It works now

sexist and racist? where did you get that from, what are you on

So the line you made up has moved? Imagine that.

Yes I am!

oddly enough not on deathclaws, but they can be found in random containers ..you can cut that randomness down by checking the "meat sacks "that you find at mutant camps these tend to have more "creature parts" than other containers

Its fucking annoying , i stopped going to the queen since a lot of players left this game that actually did dmg to her. Feels like there is mostly these adventuring casuals left. Few months back it was almost thrilling for a lvl 307 solo player like me to jump into the fight.
---
You're a life saver!
---
Can't FT. Where is your camp so I can join next time I'm in the area.
---
In the gulper's bellies.
---
They do live up to their name.
---
Might be those mail boxes.

Vanossgaming was a Garry‚Äôs mod YouTuber back in 2012 and his mascot was an owl mask

---
I found a TSE Harpoon Gun a long time ago - but, because of some bugs (the damage was "too high" I guess) it always did ZERO damage, so, I just dropped it (threw it away essentially).
---
And today I found a 2 Star Bloodied Fire Axe.  Also, earlier on in the game I didn't get what the big deal about Unyeilding armor was so I always just sold it to the vendor or sometimes even dropped some when I was overloaded - I basically never kept any "wood" armor, in fact, I got annoyed every time I found Legendary Wood Armor ü§£ü§£ü§£  Doh!!!
---
this as well as the meat sacks i forgot about the gulpers

---
Sound familiar?
---
At least it was a ghoul. I was ran out of defiance by an ant.
---
...Why would you ask about that specifically if you hadn't seen that it was in the most recent datamine?
---
Haven't had this bug for ages, happened again for me tonight. Also heavy guns (50 cal). Relog fixed it though..
---
this sounds awesome.  I'm in, z3r0d4z3 on PC camps at East Harper's ferry under the bridge.  willing to move though.
---
It‚Äôs also a good event to do before the bug daily since you get a bunch of bits without having to roam the map.
---
I actually hope the mail boxes let us transfer gear to alts. But this would be nice as well
---
I haven‚Äôt been able to play in a while but before this update I had like 5 people wander into my camp in a row and it was one of my best experience with this game!
---
Perhaps a good old fashioned ‚Äúthumbs up‚Äù will suffice?
---
Bear arms is a must imo, stabilized,power user (1k rounds per core), glow sight, gun Smith, bloody mess, luck of the draw
---
I put .38, 10mm, and .45 in the machine for free. It will help another player so why not and it‚Äôs abundant
---
By time limit I mean before starting another quest
---
I did it twice this evening and it was okay. I try to do it whenever I see it, and I‚Äôve only had it be empty once. I think you just got unlucky to have it bugged the first time.
---
PC. I usually sell them for 25-35 caps unless it‚Äôs one that I think has real impact, and this go for 50-75 but there‚Äôs only 2 or 3.
---
I had to remove a floor and have a gap in my house but it's worth it.  I hated seeing buyers floating in my foundation and after messing around that was my only resolution.
---
Not sure right now. Away from PC. But working on that quest for Rose from Top of the world. Shoot me a invite. I'll get on on Sunday üëç
---
How do you feel about the change? Positive, negative? Indifferent?
---
Shoot me a invite! I'll get back on on Sunday. (Family stuff). Gives you some time to level upüëçüèª
---
Im off now, but its in the bottom of the map in the Savage Divide, southwest of the vault down there (Vault 96 I think)
---
Janky balcony railings.
---
If it‚Äôs useless to me, I sell it for no more than 10c. Let someone else get enjoyment from it. I‚Äôm not here for profit since I didn‚Äôt pay for the item I inherited or found
---
I am so sick of running around as a nurse or a paramedic owl and don't get me started on the beer hat. So glad those disappeared, I felt like a house wife with red curlers.
---
If they are there yeah. But most of the time they are not.
---
Seriously?  Reading comprehension for fuck sake, "not because it's too hard" is literally the first sentence.
---
I'm wondering how you got up there.
---
A mixture of marsupial and X01 JetPack is how
---
I had a guy punch me while I was standing at a vendor machine, but I‚Äôd been there less than a minute and there were two other free machines right there. This guy had his own base just a short distance away and I figured he wanted me to shop there instead.
---
If it suits you, get into trading. My, and a couple of my friends, ‚ÄúEndgame‚Äù is playing the market to upgrade my arsenal. Aside from that this new scout update is a huge time sink, and a quite enjoyable one at that.
---
Or get a hobby like mine, which is farming for and stockpiling Nukashine.
---
Yeah, you're looking at some of the same stuff I am. I'm focusing on a single known location to help guide me: the responderbot spawn east of Charleston Station. I know where the NPCs spawn and where at least one of the trigger points is located (in the world) so I'm trying to find them in xyz coordinates in the files. This is a Travel type of random encounter (RE). Here's what I've found:
---
The frat party poster hanging in Charleston Station has the following coordinates (XY): -115043, -34940.
---
So I'm using that for a reference point. The spawn point will be higher in X and lower in Y (so slightly south-east). I've found node 0038005D which is related to that exact RE instance. It is located at -113657, -39501. This 'object' has bounds of 2574x366 so this is maybe the area that has to be crossed in order to trigger the encounter?
---
If you search for 0038005D in fo76edit and look at the records above and below, you'll see 6 invisible spawn markers (3 above and below) that all reference this travel trigger. This is where the NPCs will spawn. On a mole rat encounter, you'll get 6 to spawn in and they will use the coordinates of those invisible spawn markers. So, the question becomes, is that trigger object the bounds of where items spawn in or the bounds that the player has to cross to make the encounter spawn in.
---
If you look further down you'll see an object id 00380064 that's maybe the encounter itself or a parent object. It's name is OB\_RETravel04 and doesn't say Trigger in the name. It's coord are -113014, -41968 which puts it a just slightly further south east of the other object. This object doesn't have bounds so it's a single point. Maybe this is what we use to map the RE location. Problem is, this object has no parent references. The triggers, on the other hand, are all referenced by some parent object: 0002dfe5 for Scene, 0002E503 for Travel, 0002E505 for Object, and 0002E507 for Assault. So we have a way to get a list of all the triggers, but not that other object.
---
I'm sure my terminology here is garbage as I'm figuring all this out on the fly. /u/aheroicllama can you take a look at this? Maybe map these coordinates and the bounds of that object on a map and see if it looks right for this random encounter?
---
Uh let‚Äôs see...

Grind plastic for shot gun shells

Grind events for xp

Are you serious? There‚Äôs so much to do always...

well this kinda defeats the purpose... &gt;.&gt; anyway if people see this and need wood try Gilman lumber mill right next to the vault or  Sylvie and Sons Logging Camp  right next to the sons of dane compound

I'm waiting for them to start playing 76. They're on XB1 so I'd never see them, but I'm sure they would come up with some  funny stuff.
---
Did you find someone? I can help
---
Feeling the need to profit off of something that is meant for enjoyment is purely an ego thing.
---
I‚Äôve been told that I have a way with words. A poetic soul, if you will.
---
No stealth buff, there was a well documented damage buff to all heavy weapons a few patches ago.
---
I strongly disagree but to each their own.
---
I love the challenges. I‚Äôve always loved try to 100% games so those keep me going. I also play with my boyfriend so it‚Äôs a social thing which is enjoyable.

Basement of Rusty Pick
---
I actually had this today, the Whitespring gold club was full of Protectrons, most of them were legendary and diseased, the disease they had was Rad worms.
---
Terrible and I definitely dont want that mod. Thank you for sharing this
---
It followed me even after I was at the main menu. Had to restart the game completely.
---
Finishing the brotherhood quest line gets you a suit of ultracite armor, and you can use the computer at their former HQ to learn to make a set of it. Finishing Rose's raider quest line gets you a suit of raider power armor. Finishing the enclave quest line will get you either plans for x-01 and maybe a suit, I don't remember. 
---
The rest are found as plans for individual parts through looting treasure map spots. Sadly, it is a very low chance to get it
---
Well originally I was grinding for legendarys to get some scrip.
---
But now I realised I can't use the backpack with the fridge mid with power armor I've got to go farm a whole bung of xp to swap around special points and perk cards as well as farm legendarys for gear as I'm butt naked in my power armor.
---
I haven‚Äôt played in months, I assume duping is still a thing? That‚Äôs really a bummer if so.
---
yes and those prior numbers were with the buff given. However, those numbers have gone up even more. I'm trying to understand why.
---
there is one around the 87A area
---
it starts by reading a note on a bulletin board. all four of the case quests are on the 3rd floor of the lewisberg taxidermy place (also on bulletin boards) but you can also find some in train stations.
---
Yet you say you miss it most days. I was simply pointing out that it is quite easy to not miss it. Calm down, love.
---
The survival mode is hot garbage
---
No I don't see that happening, got a sling they will leave the nightkin in Vegas and on that coast
---
Yo, could you tell me how to dupe my dude?
---
I was taken aback by that as well. Then I killed him.
---
Yeah, they definitely got less frequent after the patch yesterday. It felt like I stalled when I got to 6 I went and completed one challenge and went back and it gave me my eighth
---
Hahah that‚Äôs a new low.  Usually fixes it for me when I log to main.
---
I'm getting this also.
---
Agreed this must be an annoying bug, but would it kill you to carry some power armor just until this is sorted?
---
I just want to adjust the saturation levels. Can this be done yet? Everything looks all faded on my monitor. Adjusting my monitor settings both doesnt help and makes my other games look bad. Once they let me do this, I'm coming back.
---
They wouldn't have been created yet
---
Haven‚Äôt seen Fallout: Sarah plains front yard...... yet.
---
This is been happening to me as well. It is reset itself four times now. Once my generator was dead and I thought it might have been that, but it is happened three more times and my generator has been fine.
---
However my machines are on bare ground, not on a foundation. Question to the others having this problem are your machines on the ground or on a floor?
---
wait is duping really a thing still? I stopped playing a while back when it was crazy bad and everyone had a 3\* TSE, I thought they fixed it shortly after and wiped a ton of accounts.
---
The wet kindling just spawns bugs where it was. If you‚Äôre expecting it, it‚Äôs not a problem.
---
Two of mine on ground, two on foundation.  So if that‚Äôs what it is that‚Äôs triggering it I‚Äôm gonna move mine all to foundation if that‚Äôs the case.
---
It‚Äôs a daily
---
Honestly alot of high end gear bought on the market is probably duped. Without glichers we would have so many legacy weapons and matching meta armor sets.  I'm not condoning it, but I got some dime a dozen gear that obviously duped myself lol  Only sucked when they abuse the glitch get the game shut down and overcharge for a gun they have 500 of lol
---
I'm doing an unarmed roleplay, so no power armor for me.
---
Site Alpha is another awesome Yao Guai spawn.
---
The wander into stuff as u please is really true because I just completed the responders quest where you vaccinate yourself for the scorched plague, and I'm level 63
---
I always feel quite honoured when the 'big names' in PvP drop by to kill me and check out my stuff üòõ
---
I get that, I meant just to get out of the nuke zone etc? Or to use whenever you're desperate?
---
I think you're talking to Mr 900 right above you...
---
You have to land shots on the owner of the camp before you can destroy it in survival
---
Because if you're buying from here it's as easy as checking their post history to see how many TSE weapons they've tried to sell. Here's another hint if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.
---
You have to land shots on the owner before you can destroy the camp
---
Hahaha I had a similar thing happen to me playing Wastelad. I‚Äôm surprised dying while play pipboy games isn‚Äôt a challenge or achievement evenent.
---
I wish we could access and play the Pipboy games from the main dashboard screen, like you can the Atomic shop.
---
I'm generally never desperate, and generally don't have problems with the nuke zone. Today is just kind of a weird case. I don't have power armor at all, not sure if I'm interested in having any honestly.
---
And again... reading comprehension.  Yes, I said I miss it most days but not because I needed you to explain how to open the challenge up or how to put on an outfit but because if I'm only 10% of my way into a level when I log in I'm not rushing out to grind out all of that exp, I'm just playing the game and the next thing I know a few hours later I'm leveling up without even realizing I was getting close.
---
I‚Äôm behind a bit, what does BE stand for?
---
Stupid monkeys!
---
Would do my head in to tbh, maybe for now just build a super simple camp that ticks all the functional boxes. As I've seen others complaining like you so I feel it's a bug that will be looked at soon.... Especially seeing as a large part of the last patch (the vending machines) was camp based content.
---
Thank you! I found one in a train station by chance today
---
I've just been using cannibal with the prevent rads from food and water to satisfy my needs
---
It's kind of pointless tbh, on fallout 4 made you feel invincible. All it does on 76 is remind you how fast fusion cores expire.
---
I'm still her for a bit longer!! Come get your camera!!! üëçüëçüëçüëç
---
That was only for Helios-I. Nellis had solar panels.
---
But you‚Äôre right, the dam was the most valuable thing in the whole damn Mojave.
---
If you just got back into it, have you done the new content? There's a bunch of new stuff to do in the last month or so.
---
Be amazed if we see anything from new Vegas unfortunately, which is a shame because some of the unique weapons on that game were  fantastic.
---
My best hobby is farming for materials to make ultracite 50.cal ammo... Then spraying that into the queen's head. Rinse and repeat
---
No one would be complaining about dumpers if it was single-player. These are basic growing pains of a first foray into multiplayer stuff. And honestly, when mods like Syrim Together are better than the final product, it's absolutely Bethesda's fault.
---
They don't think they're better. They're having more fun getting kills and winning. You know, just like in any video game? It's more fun to win.
---
Your OP: I often miss this challenge. 
---
My reply: Here is how to not miss the challenge. 
---
You keep banging on about reading comprehension, but you seem to be struggling with this basic exchange. Just check the challenge requirements asked soon as you log on, put the outfit on immediately, then even if you forget it doesn't matter. I have just logged on, so here I am mincing around with my responder gear and fasnacht max. When will I level up? Who knows, but I'll be getting that challenge.
---
Yeah, hope it gets fixed. I use my camp a lot in survival mode
---
Bloodied Explosive
---
The last thing I did before leaving to play Mortal Kombat 11 and Days Gone was the Nukashine Quest and the Scorched Earth Event. So yea I am going to do the Lying Lowe and Pioneer Scounts Questline. My question is mainly geared to the downtime moments when there aren't quests frequently popping up.
---
I'm selling my vault 76 outfit for 24,000. Just in case.
---
No debate that's true, you also have to remember  the FO  3, 4 and nv where not online  this one is, only reason 76 is more off a grind. 
---
And also don't matter if easy or hard it still I grind.
---
You are right about that. But things like the "equip/unequip pocketed armor" issue together with the fact that the multiplayer aspect was retrofitted into the engine make me think that maybe Bethesda is particularly bad in their design choices/implementation.
---
Just imagine accidentally buying that
---
You realize ppl with jobs cant always afford even 30 video games........ foolish
---
Huh. I don't know if this is considered ironic but certainly feels like it.
---
Now I'm not the least bit surprised with how this conversation has played out.
---
Hey, I heard theres some very friendly redditors buying junk at a high price. I'm only level 6, its worth a try.
---
Ootl: what‚Äôs that?
---
Asking the important questions
---
Yeh allgood got it done thanks for offering though
---
you should since a power armor adds like 600 i think u mean radshield
---
For me: canned dog food, mutation serums, drugs and fasnacht masks. It varies based on the type of ppl playing. Today i only sold those, yesterday i couldnt keep my vendor stocks with weapons lol
---
I'm guessing that all the so called "best and brightest" weren't from Appalachia. Most likely a bunch of connected party hacks and lobbyists. No wonder there are so many cannibals.
---
i can confirm, after i brought neon signs and letters the credits rolled with that classic fallout 'war never changes' vibe
---
That right there sounds like bad mechanics.
---
There's a older post about it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/awol74/i_think_i_kinda_know_how_spawning_in_camp_works/
---
It seems to spawn everyone but the owner at the position they were originally standing when they first placed down their camp unit. The owner can manipulate his own spawn point by moving the camp unit afterwards, but all visitors will still spawn at the original location.
---
I would think legendaries, but even with 50+ descent legendaries, end game plans I barely get any customers. I guess I'll have to go grind and only sell stuff with aae or be or bss weapons and only Unyielding armor
---
TSE weapons
---
I just get visited  from a gang of cats so far 4 different groups
---
Plans, higher tier legendaries, rare outfits, mutation serums, maybe some valuable junk like ballistic fiber etc. In my experience those sell very quickly
---
&gt;Its prety much outclassed in every way by...
---
See, I have a problem with such a statement as it implies that all weapons should be equally viable. I have no problem at all that the plasma flamer is better than just a flamer in much the same way that some guns are just overall worse than others.
---
There should be tiers of weapons and the flamer is just in a lower tier. Perhaps even to the point of being unusable but so long as there are other options, so what.
---
I cannot second the need to fix the Shishkebab more enthusiasticly. 
---
It‚Äôs a KATANA... and it‚Äôs ON FIRE. Katana on Fire! Best thing ever, now make it fucking work! I just love mine so much. 
---
The ratio of enemies with absurd energy resistance needs fixing, too. Nearly every enemy type shouldn‚Äôt realistically have resistance to being immolated.
---
oh bugger never thought of your bloodied types. i had one at my entry point but now I've moved it to a nice little 'facilities area'
---
For me it has been plans, sure I don't get much per plan but I would rather sell a lot of smaller things over a few more expensive things.
---
Everyone has to earn their own way, Webelo.
---
imagine being ungrateful that they're fixing the game.
---
Yeah theres a YouTuber named, ‚Äúrage chronicles‚Äù his most recent video about half way through has evidence of it
---
Jeez and I thought I was doing well jumping around the roof of WS sniping ghouls....
---
It doesn't work as of patch 9. They SAID it should work, but it doesn't. [More here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blra0h/fallout_76_wild_appalachia_patch_9_notes_may_7/en0mqav/?context=3)
---
From what I've seen,  most people are buying plans (either rare ones or cheap ones they don't have), cheap serums, stable flux,  commonly used ammo, and junk that they need. 
---
As far as weapons and armor,  people are usually only buying it if it's 2* or 3* with good rolls. However, they are only buying it if it's priced fairly. Or if it's low priced and they can flip it in their own machine.
---
Definitely just let me know when you'll be on the Xbox tomorrow sometime I guess.
---
It was fun, could even have been slightly bigger, but the foundations and walls ate up so much budget. If we ever get a camp budget increase I might re-do it.
---
Treasure maps sell well and reasonably priced 1* weapons are selling well too. 
---
Had a guy come and buy a instigating fire axe, added my bloodied one he bought that another just bought about 7 maps straight up.
---
I also went to a vendor and they were selling ballistic fibre for 7 caps each great price so bought all 62 for bout 580 caps which is not bad at all
---
It's basically giving me a height restriction that isn't very high
---
I definitely can use it. My gamertag is:  sleepy4792
---
Barely any customers or barely any buyers? 
---
If it's customers in general,  your base might be too out of the way.  If it's buyers,  you're either charging too much or have bad gear.
---
How much does the backpack capacity mod increase your limit by?
---
Really though 
---
We‚Äôre already paying taxes. I‚Äôm taking my paperwork to Biv so he can submit it.
---
Imagine still playing the game lol
---
This and the fact it's just annoying being Lv 200+ having to get 3 levels just for a challenge. I'd much prefer kill x amount of y enemies in some location or something.   
---
"Kill 50 Ghouls in the Burrows."   
---
"Kill 10 Scorchbeasts."   
---
"Kill 3 Sheepsquatch."   
---
There are so many challenges on here that just makes you wonder who comes up with them.
---
Appreciate it!
---
Same here, can‚Äôt even find one
---
Nah, the engine handled some pretty intense settelements in Fallout 4, and it has had (minor) upgrades since. Sure, we can't make HUGE settlements, but a humble beginning.
---
I don‚Äôt farm much so I buy
---
ammo, chems, dog food, purified water, lots of junk, leggos, armor, plans, mods
---
So was adventure mode when griefers could be absolute dick bags
---
Thank you so much. :) I really appreciate it.
---
This is likely related to at least one part of the explosive shotgun "fix". TSEs are now being reported as though there were two +20% explosions rather than one. 
---
In reality that's probably how it already worked and for TSEs this is just a display fix, but until someone tests it properly, no-one really knows.
---
imagine not playing it but complaining it's being fixed for people who still play.üò¨
---
Pretty sure deathclaw taming was broken as of patch 9, non intended. [Info here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blra0h/fallout_76_wild_appalachia_patch_9_notes_may_7/en0mqav/?context=3)
---
Plans, bobbleheads, and clothing here
---
Well, the quest could start with us realizing fow frakked up much of the world and water is, and then go looking for how to fix it in Vault-Tec data-files and learning about the GECKs ourselves, going hunting for one. Vault-Tec might not have thought we needed one, but the current situation warrants us looking into alternatives.
---
All I have left is 2 more badges and reviving an ally.... Hopefully i can finish it soon
---
Nice try.
---
Just do the quest and suffer through it like everybody else.
---
I think it's partially caused by fast-travelling into the area when someone is firing. Show up earlier and you reduce the chance.
---
1.) thanks for stereotyping a cultural region
---
2.) In the lore, VTU is actually an extremely well sought after school, and the area had a lot of the more elite, obvious by the presence of mining elites, Whitesprings, the rapid expansion of Watoga, and the presence of Nuka Cola, Arktos Pharma, Numerous Vault-Tec Facilities, and West-Tec
---
I have put my venders in a spot that basically forces people to look through my house ahah
---
PVP
---
Nah, it's exactly how I feel.  I set up way north near the space station because there's not really a convenient hub up there, with the possible exception of the hunting lodge.  And scorched/ghouls/stingwings get irritating.
---
I'm providing a much needed service for players who need somewhere relatively safe to repair and rearm. So I love it when I see the same face pop back in multiple times. I only rarely server hop, and tend to stay on a single server for at least two or more hours at a time. 
---
My c.a.m.p. is designed with that in mind.  Its a three story design, with the upper two floors overhanging an open "workshop" on the first floor.  The Generator room is behind a locked security door in the shop to keep out the vermin. 
---
 Second level has seating, and a guitar with an adjoining bedroom/kitchenette. (two beds and storage!) 
---
Third floor is my private apartment with my personal crafting needs, a nice bedroom/office and private balcony access. 
---
Outside there's free water and crops. 
---
I was gonna redesign to more of a fort/bunker build, but I decided to do that on an alt instead. The current build just feels "right" for my main.
---
They said in an interview that they tried and it wasn't feasible. That's why there is such a low base budget and stash limit.
---
 Fallout 4 was also a single player game. It only had to keep track of one player's actions.
---
Seems like a known bug, been seeing it around the forums
---
No it wasn‚Äôt lol,
---
&gt;As people also mentioned in another thread, if the purveyor behaves like all the other vendors, we could have some pretty long waits.
---
In survival you won't.
---
Those born in the vault (it has been 25 years or so since the great war) wouldn't be on file.
---
Two things, 1. While I‚Äôm sure a good chunk was Native like the overseer, normally the best and brightest of a generation aren‚Äôt regulated to one region so I‚Äôm sure they came from all over the country and 2. In surprised the robots even function after the Christmas flood so a glitch or two here is still impressive
---
*shoots face with gamma gun*
---
Where can I read about that? Hadn‚Äôt heard about mailboxes.
---
I did the quest. Just an interesting question.
---
You joke, but a lot of players are doing this. I saw a guy selling one star legendaries for between 10-20k caps. Another guy was selling a broken grenade launcher for 400 caps.
---
Well that's pretty nice.
---
And for a reasonable price - say 30 caps.
---
I dont play because its really boring now dumb nut
---
Very nice.
---
lol I've been trying to get the 8th token for like 3 hours, I think this server maintenance may have made it stop dropping
---
F
---
I got 3 from the dailies + the event the campfire one, still working on all my possum badges
---
Any Strange in Numbers?
---
Nice I‚Äôll be sure to visit tomorrow
---
&gt;I will remain in my base...I heard if the seller stays in their bases, you can inspect items, so that is what I will do.
---
Thats' right. Sometimes theres a delay but it should eventually work.
---
The overseers states that a good chunk was from Appalachia. It would have been neat if there was a terminal entry that mentioned lost data regarding addresses, which is why you have to fetch a piece of mail.
---
What is reasonably priced for one stars. I'm so confused about how to price them.
---
It‚Äôs Fallout. Everyone has exploited everything in Fallout games since the beginning of the franchise. Yet again, another reason it shouldn‚Äôt have been online anyway. No offense.
---

---
You can get X01 plans from the Enclave bunker from one of the terminals.  I think it might in the science area.
---
You download from the terminal and craft yourself.
---
Because you prob have deep pocketed mod on
---
Good bot
---
Lol... although, to be fair he did say the new legendary exchange balanced things out...  so more like heck-a-doole-roo
---
üòÇ
---
..."Dumb nut" that quite LITERALLY made me burst out laughing. Are you even old enough to play this game? LMAO
---
I have no idea if that's the cause, I just had a hunch. I also crash a lot, so it could be something tied to that as well
---
Damn kk guess I just gotta keep trying
---
Thanks! Are you available from about 6 this evening UK time? My network card broke and I have to go out and get an Ethernet cable until the one I ordered arrives.
---
Excavator? If so you need the full suit equipped/not broken to get +100
---
I am sure the vault since it was known about had an actual address.
---
Im 19 im one strike away from a ban on this subreddit so i have to be carefull you smooth brain
---
Fluxes, junk, serums, rare outfits like fasnacht mask and event outfits. Decent three star weapons like bloodied swing speed or anti armor faster fire rate/ explosive. Maps sell for 50-85. I‚Äôve sold a lot of my magazines and bobble heads to people looking to compete the challenge.
---
Not on that part. Or any part
---
There is no deep pocketed on power armor
---
This
---
yeah okay buddy üòÇ
---
I will have to have a look. Cheers.
---
And that's why thank you
---
Aren‚Äôt we all lol
---
It does not. You can use them to get a new one however once you've done the quest.
---
I know it‚Äôs based on the Scottish flag, but it reminds me a bit of the Maryland flag. Which is pretty fitting as Maryland is the ‚Äúfree state‚Äù and the Free States in game are located in or near where Maryland would be.
---
For anyone not familiar with the RL Mire, Harpers Ferry is located where the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers converge. The Shenandoah is the border between West Virginia and Virginia. The Potomac is one of the borders between Maryland and Virginia, and also separates parts of Maryland from West Virginia. Which puts Harpers Ferry smack dab in between all three states.
---
Because of its location, Harpers Ferry had a pretty crazy history. It was located between the North and South during the American Civil War and because of its nearby canals, proximity to DC and location on the Potomac made it a fairly significant and in-turn, fortified position. 
---
The armory featured in the game actually predates the Civil War and was notable for being raided by the abolitionist John Brown, who was looking to steal weapons from the US Army weapons to arm a slave rebellion. The US Army Colonel responsible for taking back the armory was no other than Robert E. Lee, who would later go on to command the CSA Army (and continue killing abolitionists) during the Civil War. 
---

use the bleeder barrel, and you'll also get DoT, which can help kill it much faster

---
I made this exact mistake, because I had the thought "oh hey I'll just use my legendary crossbow for this." 
---
I'm still tryin to get it below 100%, a day and a half later. Crossbows are durable as hell :/
---
+120 total on the level 50 pack, but with -60 energy and rad resist
---
It should stay, it's the best one and one of the few "pervasive" challenges that is readily obtainable everyday AND doesn't really matter if you miss it (you'll get a chance the next day). It's cumulative, only the pre-requisites rotate out every other day or so. 
---
Those requisites are very easy to achieve with the right planning. For me, it comes down to simply wearing an outfit with mask b/c one requisite is usually passive "Level up +76 or higher" coupled with + Fasnacht Mask + Responder Gear" and it's so easy to wear that outfit when Leveling up. 
---
Next day, I might not be even close to leveling up b/c I am farming Nukashine and not questing. The following day, x2 nuke zones, tons of xp and gotta break out that clown outfit...and there's the challenge ready and waiting for me. I love it. 
---
Compare the relative simplicity of the "Level Up" challenge to other's like, "Take a photo of another player doing x or y..." or "Take a photo of an Assaultron WITH an Eyebot" or "Craft 10 Alcohol Drinks" which are vastly more complex in comparison and won't carry over your progress into the next day.
---
When I build a crossbow, it starts with 150% durability. I think the damaged one that spawns at the Palace is a much better idea than just building and using it for the rest of the challenges.
---
Honestly you don't need to worry about anything past friends sounds fruity but still the game is borderline unplayable alone and also try to get mutations they are a lot of fun
---
Rare plans like civil era clothes or event only/just rare plans can have decent chance that your customers wants it, recipes can also be sold if you sell it cheaper slightly, people that lazy to collect recipes will buy it by the chance just to unlock even they don't interest to your gears(also it just feel better and looks nice when your shop not only have high price items right?)
---
And for legendary/rare gears, it is important that good combination of two or three stars legendary are most wanted, I think some weird legendary should become scrips xD(Things like +str/lower ___'s weight/auto stim or sneaks, it maybe seems not ok, but are will also increase the carry weight, auto stim or sneaks are QoL stuff to match play style, which surely will attract some very certain customers to buy it, I mean, me, because I have full set just like that LOL)
---
Treasure maps seems nice as well, but people usually over prices it for hundreds for somehow, I think it only worth less than 100 though, like 80 maybe
---
Junks that rarely see might be interested by customers as well, like protetron model, space monkey, teddy bears, people might wants to put it inside the display csses when it's out, things like teddy bears, nuka cola, miners outfit, pickaxes can also be items for the possum badge progress, they can sell at low prices as well, at least it worth more than you just scrap it, just take sometime to check what items people need, they might will buy it by the chance they browsing it
---
&gt; I love how nowadays we as players have the gear and skills (know-how and perks) to take out scorchbeasts when they show up
---
Speak for yourself, I nearly died several times today to heavy boy ghouls and ran for five minutes yesterday trying to escape a mole rat. I'm level 160 ffs...
---
That's alot of shells taking up space that could be better used for other stuff.
---
Where do you farm plastic?  The 2 schools and cat lady's house ... but anywhere else?
---
That‚Äôs pretty awesome üëè
---
Good guideline, if I were to change anything though, I'd change liking the feeling of "previous Fallout games" to a more specific previous "*Bethesda* Fallout games".  Particularly Fallout 4.
---
Not trying to knock any of the games down, but I think the distinction is very important, since Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 both kind of loosely tie into Fallout 76 in some manner, and the gameplay loop is still sort of familiar, especially Fallout 4.
---
This.  I remember a few months ago, I went to register on the forum for a piece of software that I've been using for years, only discover I was IP-banned.  From a forum I'd never even registered on.  Such are the perils of IP-banning in a dynamic IP world.
---
Thankfully a quick email explaining the situation was all it took to get me unblocked.
---
Never duped and I‚Äôm banned yet these fuckwits are still roaming around the game making alt accounts and duping without consequences
---
I would love to tame the SBQ, saddle her up and ride her into battle over Appalachia Game of Thrones style.
---
Is that the ‚Äúnew‚Äù god roll type effect?
---
I'm stealing that "Look at tree" idea
---
And there are items you can‚Äôt bulk but can sell individually! I had hundreds of things like fiber optics and asbestos before I realized they don‚Äôt show up in the bulk menu.
---
I have a switch on mine.  If i ever get the chance i will test this
---
So simply remove the map limit and make map limits instead offer to spawn you into much smaller and easier to handle instances created by players for living. Kind of like the villages in FFIV but more Fallout settelemnt-ish. These instanced can each be the size they need to be for the engine to make it work, still seing a simplyfied version of the game world in the distance.
---
By offering different instanced depending on which direction you go you can still keep the feeling of keep wandering in the game world beyond our current limit. Northeast (forest), east/norteast (mire), Southeast (bog), south (mire/forest), west (forest) and North (mountains). The instances dont have to be big, making it much easier on the engine, but still increasing the feeling of the game world and offering a place off-map for players to build together. 
---
If each player lot if, as an example, roughly 6x6 foundations large and an instance is made for maximum of 25 lots (5x5) the instance dont have to be much larger than 30x30 foundations big. Easy peasy.
---
Pretty sure they're just going to be at Berkeley Springs station.
---
I remember that when I started the game, it was just "level up" and that's it. Not sure why they changed it when I got back to the game, maybe they already decided that it's too easy...
---
Those were simpler times... üòÖ
---
Considering I get 500 from scraping guns at uranium fever definitely not 1000

Here's the pics I took from your guys' notes since this is still the top google hit.

Definitely a lot more had like 2k steel a few days ago
---
I don't pvp so I dont know about that.
---
But for pve. Up until the latest patch I've just been running a super sledge in power armor. 
---
Up until the last patch I've been running in power armor butt naked 24/7 never needed armor. And when I heard that I can't have a fridge in my power armor I've been  doing the boy scout quests and everything else in random pieces of armor I've found and a 1 handed melee weapon. because I didn't ever use armor before
---
Aliens confirmed.
---
You‚Äôre not wanting to do the pioneer scout stuff?
---
Lame
---
Could be an enclave thing. Perhaps our unnamed man is trying to unplug MODUS
---
It is listed under resources in your camp menu. Or someone can build you one. you will need to keep some razorgrain and steel handy in case you have to repair it.
---
What p2p items?
---
It could be argued that since pre-war civilization programmed and designed these robots, that we are dealing with the expression of ghosts.
---
It's the apocalypse, nobody's going to have an address on file, especially if they came from the vault. Vault wouldn't be their home address just because they were born there anyways.
---
Do you happen to know when they'll be adding more? The concept art looked pretty cool.
---
It's not necessarily p2p but repair kits should just be random drops, or a buff to the perk for random chance for your gun to repair itself every time you shoot it.
---
Everything. Everybody wants a little something different and it always surprises me.
---
well thanks for telling me, i can stop wasting 10 minutes everyday now...
---
Yes, I should be online then. What's your IGN?
---
It is one of them.  Very popular right now.
---
TheElderRosen. Thanks again!
---
Happened to me too.
---
"Any response" - not happening by Bethesda
---
Great stuff here, I'm loving all this new content!
---
Are you guys still looking into some location challanges, and the Overseer holotape questline not completing properly?
---
Again, keep up the great work guys!
---
That's not p2p... your'e clearly not properly informed. The ones sold in atom shop are basic repair kits. You get FREE improved repair kits in game as loot drops. They repair your items to 150% condition. The ones in atom shop only do 100%. Why would anyone pay for that?
---
Server hop the parking lot of the watwrpark up north. On a body next to a car

Commenting use later, awesome

I haven't left but I still haven't found one. It's a random encounter.
---
Or they can increase the caps we can carry, that'd be even better. üòî
---
Cheaters suck. But so does Bethesda. If Bethesda had made the game they promised this wouldn't have happened.  They've done it to themselves for releasing a broken mess.

---
Every ‚Äúbig‚Äù update that has been added to this game has brought me back and honestly it is still not doing it for me. It may just be the sour feeling this game has left me with but I am still optimistic for the future. Honestly if you can get it at a discount you should give it a shot if you are interested
---
Does he attack you or just wanders looking for his friends?
---
Tried to make friends, followed them around for a bit then got called a nerd and to get lost.

I would expect more from data mining it shows a lot

I have a Vampire's Ripper. Holy god is it junk.
---
Seems legit what platform you on?
---
So do I!
---
Are you still looking for people? I'm level 31 and looking to join a group of players.
---
Just running a normal sniper stealth build can two shot most things but not a sb that is until I‚Äôm spotted then I waste ammo
---
It seems people are either selling stuff at the default price or they are just flicking the pics 1 tab to the right which is around 6k caps.
---
That was something I considered but I'm still leaning towards he was looking for a group of people up north based on him saying he had to go north and find THEM. When he was talking about the "bucket-of-bolts" he was speaking in the singular form.
---
Yeah, if you can place it at the new location. Always a gamble, in my experience.
---
Ps4
---
I wonder if that's the same spot I saw one in a while back is it close to the power plant?
---
I'm on Xbox does PS4 have a looking for groups?
---
Ah poop. Well it has been a verified glitch on you tube. Yours however keeps popping up seemingly every other patch... but I haven't seen any videos on it, just word of mouth "hey my X is gone!!". May Atom's glow be with you.
---
I've found that sometimes I accidentally sell stuff, or I sell something intentionally, then I'll forget about it (because life/work). Then when I get a perk or a mutation that makes that thing useful, I'm like "where tf did that vampires increased fire rate assault rifle go!!!?". 
---
Granted you probably wouldn't sell a TSE handmade, but still. This is one of those glitches that has yet to be verified... and unfortunately its really hard to verify. You wouldn't know it occurred until it was too late. 
---
Maybe someone out there could write a database system for PC's, and spit out a continually updating log file of everything that goes in/out of your inventory, and how (trade, death, quest reward, etc.). It'd make a bug like this easier to prove, and likely easier to fix if proven.
---
But until I see hard evidence... I'm treating it like the alleged "people can steal stuff during trade" glitch that was ultimately proven to just be a bunch of trolls butt-hurt over the direction of the franchise.
---
Not accusing you, just approaching with cautious skepticism, since the community has been burned before.
---
It's not worth it if you use power armor :/
---
Eh, it's enough to keep me coming back. I'm never going to be a top of any leaderboard type of player. I'm more the 'let's see if I survive this' type.
---
We have community's. I'll join one of those
---
No your definition of communism is definitely authoritarian then, I was trying to give you the benefit of the doubt. 
---
Capitalism is freedom of choice. All governments are flawed because humans are flawed and have varying degrees of authoritarianism, on that I agree, but by all available metrics, capitalism has brought more people out of poverty in the last 100 years than anything else, you just need to look at real world statistics and let go of ideological trappings.
---
What you fail to understand is that wealth is developed by people with ambition and initiative, you can't just tranfer everything to communism and keep that same wealth, it always drops when people don't have incentive to put in the extra effort, build a business and hire people grow it.
---
Holy shit, amazing work!
---
Never was
---
Meh, the Boston/ WV area was also scaled down by something like 100 times right? Such is le gamez.
---
I‚Äôve seen some in Wendigo Cave pretty reliably
---
I saw a guys camp built on into a damn cave. Didn't have anything worth buying, but checking out his camo, it was pretty sweet
---
You're level 200 and you haven't figured it out yet... It's not level up three times in a single day, it's level up once under three of the listed conditions.
---
Alright good luck
---
what happened now?
---
Wait Skyrim got a survival? Are you telling me I have an excuse to buy a Nintendo switch (besides the obvious zelda)??!
---
Yes I know. Which is why I don't bother with them, don't have time or patience to watch my exp bar until it gets just barely over the next level just to finish the challenge.
---
Crits can be a viable way to make non stealth ranged characters better.
---
You can't just start shooting up somebody's camp, that doesn't make sense
---
&gt; having to get 3 levels
---
You can do it all in one go. If any level up meets three separate requirements from the list, you're good.
---
In survival mode? I understand adventure mode, but I‚Äôm referring to survival
---
its what happens when a game gets boring.  people find interesting ways to mess with it.  thats the fun in it.  testing methods to exploit can be fun
---
Bashing seems to wear it down faster in my limited xp
---
I had someone get stuck between my stove and a wall yesterday, under stairs so they couldn't jump out.
---
I moved the stove and now I can't place it back :/
---
I had to replace it with that dinky little pot-on-a-grate to put it back. Fast travel mats cannot come soon enough
---
I could see this working.
---
Except that it goes down onto the lower deck and across planks over a several hundred foot drop.
---
Me too rex_insanity
---
Bloodied two hand melee build;  
---
40% faster swing speed super sledge with unyielding, mutants and chameleon armour.  
---
Mutations that benefit me, such as twisted muscles for better melee attacks, marsupial to jump higher to dodge bullets and speed demon to run in quickly to get the hits in.  
---
Plus the perk Radicool which increases my melee damage the more rads I have, which since I am bloodied and my attacks increase the lower my health I can jump from 340 damage per swing to 1000 damage per swing. Also Strange in Numbers so when on a team with other mutated players my mutations get stronger.  
---
Total glass cannon but it works out 9 out of 10 times
---
Yup I have a be lever and grabbed up a be hunting rifle. With the refined .50 receiver (I think that‚Äôs the one) the damage matches the lever. I went ahead and primed mine which passes up the lever primed or not.  My lever is doing 490 something and the hunting rifle is doing 550.
---
You still have that extra plan?
---
You don‚Äôt happen to recall where that house is, do you?
---
Ty mate!
---
Some of these are pretty cool, some are the giant eyesore boxes and floating abominations that I loathe stumbling across. 
---
...maybe I‚Äôm a bit of a Camp snob...
---
Yeah, sometimes you get extra unlucky and you dont get badge in several hours. Some dataminer told there is 25% chance for badge so this is strange....
---
Could be cool, seeing as how they based sheepsquatch off of the deathclaw models. Maybe the yeti's could be based on Super Mutants and Behemoths!? 
---
I'd pump in some money to the atom shop if it turns out to be... cool lol.
---
I'm also hoping for space aliens ü§û. Wouldn't it be crazy if it were another alien race in addition to the Zetans!!?
---
If you can find another broken one, you can craft a new one and just cart around two cameras. Not ideal at all but possible. I agree with your idea though, that would be the best way to go.
---
Sun -kissed is mutation friendly. I've shared it across 3 low level characters with my high level medic to no ill effect.
---
Yeah wouldn't have known you could just do all 3 levels in one level if you didn't tell me. Challenges only get completed if they so happen to complete while I'm doing whatever it is I'm doing sadly. :(
---
I found a guy that had a shop set up right next to the whitespring station and he had the most decked out base that was designed like a shop that I have ever seen. He even had a little window with a chair set up right on the other side so he could sit and talk to people. Best part was he had a switch set up in the back to turn on alarms. Didn‚Äôt hurt that he had a little bit of everything in his vending machines.
---
Between 100 and 250 caps depending on prefix
---
Lever has a much much higher rate of fire though, the hunting rifle is now better for high oneshots but the lever rifle is more effective at taking down groups
---
Repair kits are bad and while that battle was lost (and I didn‚Äôt expect to win it especially when we have gamers that still refuse to understand why microtransactions help encourage shitty game design) I still won‚Äôt give bethesda any money now for atoms over it. 
---
But, what‚Äôs particularly insulting is you assuming everyone upset about it is just wanting to cry over everything. For example I don‚Äôt care about the 10 percent tax and totally understand why they are doing it. And note very few people on this sub are upset about this tax like they were about repair kits (yes there were several of us upset. Where as now most people here don‚Äôt care about the 10 percent  tax aside from a few libertarians who can‚Äôt separate game from real life and have a chip on their shoulder about anyone taxing them irl or in a game). So maybe stop trying to use this as an excuse to ignore other complaints that people have made. Especially when it‚Äôs very obvious that most of those people aren‚Äôt even the ones complaining about this.
---
I'm having similar issues.  My CAMP is split into 2 blueprints, the main house and the roof/porch/decorations which snap into the house.  The main house blueprint, which I haven't edited at all, tells me it cant be placed because it "needs support".  After moving CAMP locations twice and restarting the game twice I turned it off.  Very frustrating.
---
I'd rather get mutation recipes instead.
---
sure, enjoy the duping then!
---
You need the Brahmin plan too!
---
My camp is on a highly radioactive pond southeast of Whitespring. In the middle of my pond is my Behemoth. I call him Dave. He protects my stuff.
---
yea it sucks but just google what each thing does
---
I got mine from pleasant valley station.
---
God, yes, please.
---
Wow, that gave me a real big smile!
---
So cute, creative and clever. Well done!
---
In response you ducked a pertinent question, resulted to ad hominem, and repeated yourself within two short sentence. 
---
You fail to defend your argument; you lose.
---
It wouldnt be an issue if bethesda would have made a product that wasnt broken.
---
A locomotive is just the engine that pulls the cars. It does not include the whole train.
---
That marine dive suit they teased in the burrows pictures.  It looked awesome.  I also want some planters for crops!
---
Everyday I sign in mostly to complete as many daily challenges as possible. It keeps me busy for a few hours and I get distracted gathering things I need, shopping at peoples  bases, or gathering stuff to sell to get all my daily caps. Caps and atoms are motivator for me.
---
Based on my own testing, no, you don't have to reassign your wares if you simply relocate your CAMP.
---
However if you store your vending machines, then you'll have to reassign them. For example, I was putting 2 machines next to each other, then moved my CAMP to another spot. Upon placing down the machines, I noticed that the machines are grouped up and unable to be separated without storing them.
---
üòÑüòÄ thanks location worked perfectly
---
I would love the diving suit that was teased in the burrows promotion art, new camp items, a skin for the chemistry workbench, maybe some new op syringer mods because arktos would probably use then to tranq animals
---
Outside abbys bunker or inside nuka cola plant
---
Each Machine has different items in it so I guess he wanted to check the one you were using
---
I love exploring and finding new places, and getting lost in old buildings, trying to figure out who could have lived there and why. You get some interesting encounters or find funny things, like two Teddy Bears ‚Äúfilming‚Äù a cooking show.
---
Reminds me of Brian Froud's Trolls, Goblins, and Fairy books.
---
It‚Äôs in the military wing computers. Just past the vendor machines.
---
Maybe so in your case. other machines don't mean much to me.  I can check four machines in about 30 seconds if they don't have a slew of high-level gear.

He just walks
---
&gt;Capitalism is freedom of choice.
---
&gt; capitalism has brought more people out of poverty in the last 100 years than anything else,
---
&gt;keep that same wealth
---
&gt;wealth
---
Notice how you mentioned freedom, and then just instantly began talking about wealth? Freedoms are granted to those who work within the system. To those who control the wealth. When a small group of people control the wealth in a capitalist society. Which is what happens everytime. They decide your freedoms. I mean, I dont think it can get more authoritarian than the fact that this entire planet is dying and there is literally nothing we can do about it because what is killing the planet is the same thing lining the pockets of the global elite. 
---
&gt;All governments are flawed because humans are flawed and have varying degrees of authoritarianism
---
So then at the very least you would say that just because a government is authoritarian it doesnt make it the same as other authoritarian governments? Hmmmm
---
Everything aside I enjoy civil debate and I do hope you are considering this to be civil as well.
---
Where do i get that plan?never seen it...
---
I know the struggle, man. These camera photos are driving me up a wall with how finicky they are. I wish the zoom lens actually registered photo subjects from further away :(
---
I heard that if you initiate trade with them it breaks them from the vendor. Haven't verified.
---
The delicious clicks.

vault 76 has been sealed for 25 years, if you where born during that time you would have no home address.. but yes, the elderly would have had a past home

I mean honestly they must've had the Stalker legendary prefix on that thing. Hell of a shot.
---
Kipper meme incoming? Seriously though take wood armor off the table too. It can't even roll with more than one mod afaik.

I mean it deflates the currency which is absurdly useful.  We're all able to print money, we have to burn some too.
---
I still can‚Äôt find the fucker :(
---
go to bunker vendor at the "production" area i think he may
---
Keep in mind he has probably eaten people.
---
That's what I've been doing, I have the whole set except the mask.
---
Thanks, fellas!
---
Two things 
---
1.you cant put your link in the title you have to put it in the text space underneath 
---
2.you used imgur which is the best photo sharing site to post to reddit with good job
---
:'(
---
Hadn't even thought of that, there were so many people complaining that they had dropped their camera and couldn't make a new one I didn't think it was possible.  Even already had three broken cameras I never realized I'd picked up waiting in my inventory.
---
If you still need someone I can help, IGN Vicarious+
---
If it's an x01 and a helmetod then it has NOT been fixed yet.

I know of no other issues with PA and mods. I have modded try t51 t60 and ultra fully on all locations and various mods no prob. Hope this helps
---
I shot him. He has eaten human flesh in the past.

I know lore is keeping them from us but super mutant overhaul is one of my favorite mods for fallout 4 (here)[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11853] that mod added nightkin and they were really scary to fight because they would constantly pop in and out of invisibility and get around you

Legendary Abominable Sheepsquatch.
---
thank a ton, if you need help with the swmming one lmk
---
There‚Äôs only ONE spot in the whole game it spawns for crafting.  It only spawns once every 24 hours at Middle Mountain Cabins behind the east cabin in a basket.  Someone wrote a blog on it.  It‚Äôs crazy rare haha.
---
I‚Äôm good to go! Just going up to Wavy Willard‚Äôs for the pics now. Thank you too!
---
Hmmm... So by the sounds of it, you were placing the "courtesy Blueprinted" CAMP that becomes available to you after moving? And *that* one "keeps" what you have listed?
---
I'm looking to build-anew, so I'm not sure how viable this would be for me &lt;_&gt; 
---
However..... I suppose I ***could*** completely scrap my current build *before* moving, and just leave the Vending Machines.
---
\*strokes beard\* That just may be a viable solution in my case. 
---
Either way, thank you for responding as all information is valuable information! :)
---
Is wood armor a thing I shouldn't be throwing away? Lol
---
I will admit I came to this reddit for just this reason. I was wondering if I should come back or not. I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôve added a bunch of stuff. Main reason I left was cause it felt like my character just wasn‚Äôt doing good. My build was horrible. Felt like I was going nowhere. But I do think I‚Äôm going to give it another try. Is respec still at lvl 30? I was like 23 or something.
---
That is just so fucking awesome. You are truly a hero to this community.
---
ah okay I still need the world challenge for reviving a downed player in the water if you are willing to help me out with that. Thank you so much for what youve done already
---
Well it's not just the dupers...I mean people just need to BREAK things. It's human nature. We find the loop holes, the cheats, the easy way out. No game is going to be 100% safe from these types of people. However...Bugthesda needs to realize that the best way to fix this? To have people break the game for them. Test servers. Let us break your game for you! Then you can fix it!
---
They obviously don't have the manpower to fix all the problems, so they need to rely on fans. Let us help you. Modders have been fixing your games since day one guys...get with the program.
---
Ended up buying faschat masks I didn't have
---
I like wv civil war pendant style flags. Id rather have than than a square flag.
---
Oh duh. What body of water?
---
Buyers, my camp is a 5 cap fast travel south east of ws station. all weapon and armor legendaries are less that 1500 caps. It's got God tier stuff, but a shit load of descent primaries and secondary effects. Good amount of aa, insitgating, and executioners stuff
---
Well I'm hoping it goes well for me next time. I tried this evening to find one and it wasn't available.
---
Aha thank you! I will be searching for that. I just need 2 more to craft this dang blackberry honey crisp.
---
one near the waterpark if there is one. knock out two birds
---
If you are on PC you could use a mod to change the weapon sounds to something like this so is more realistic and less intrusive:
---

---
Just search it on Reddit.
---
Yep, the pre-grouped "blueprint" one, but the funny thing is that even when they're placed down, I still couldn't separate them, leading to me storing them to relocate the machine and redoing all the listing...
---
Your plan might work, but if you're not lucky, it might group up your machines, so make sure to scrap all the wires and separate them first.
---
right here near your camp is good too
---
Jetpack, calibrated shocks, targeting hud, optimized bracers.
---
every other PA mod is either trash, or only sometimes useful
---
Shhhhh
---
Thanks for the info, looks like the restaurant will have to wait until fridges come.
---
There's be a million camps lol. I'd like it if people could buy my stuff from an app or something though.
---
I farm the the cores and just leave the PA so if you see a set but no core that's what happened. Easyiest way for me is farm the sentry bots at white springs. Loot them before they blow up and loot them again after, their cores are usually 60% full I can get a good 4 or 7 cores with one walk through
---
Is it too late to join in on the reviving?
---
This so many fucking times i dinged without noticing and had to grind whole level to get that challenge done
---
Updated. Also a wiki indicates the Chrystalizing mod removes 25% speed.
---
I forgot about those bots.  Good call.
---
How is this not the top post (after Mapallachia, that shit is so helpful)?
---
Yup this is all true.
---
Off topic, when you buy the backpack/camera mods with your badges, do you get a mod or a plan? Just wondering how I should plan this out.
---
Mods, please sticky this
---
Make it like the enclave. 5 machines tending the store while the purveyor sits back in his chair laughing and collecting all that scripts.
---
Do not be surprised by the figure of 100%, I will explain it easily for you, for example.
---
Ex = Huntingrifle
---
Base damage(200 when you have rifleman perks)
---
When effect BE, Adrenaline mutate, nerd rage, bloody mess = 658(wide area effect, can applied in vats,and let you know this time no demolition expert perks.)
---
When effect B10, Adrenaline, nerd rage, Bloody mess= 480~510(only aiming, cant applied in vats.)
---
If B10 is up to B100= Adrenaline, nerd rage, Bloody mess = 680
---
I hear those things are awfully loud
---
I mean, that is your choice, but literally all you have to do is look at the challenge to see what you need to do.
---
Damn right you do!
---
It‚Äôs been 3 days I‚Äôm still looking for number 3 lol
---
Do you have Robot Arms and Legs plans?  I‚Äôm dying here.
---
You act like 12 year olds care what you say on Reddit...If you want things to change it is Bethesda's fault.
---
Players: "We want the game to be balanced!"
---
Bethesda: "Hold my beer."
---
Bloodied combat shotguns, no VATS unless it's poison bugs. I tend to swap perks around a lot, so I play the SBQ in PA with Dodgy, Bloody Mess and Nerd Rage, but more typically Stealth, Escape Artist, Serendipity and max Gunsmith in my garbage non-PA. I also do some secondary lever rifle to save shells.
---
Even when playing with weaker perks, it one-shots level 68 supermutants without stealth when I can land most of the pellets on their head. Landed Scorchbeasts usually drop within a clip. It's not tough without the PA, but I survive dumb mistakes as long as I have Serendipity. I don't like dying, even though the cost is minimal.
---
I still need to do a water revive as well if you don‚Äôt mind
---
Same thing is happening to me.
---
Yep. Did you already post something? I should have checked. Such a strange bug.
---
We're all done now. But if someone should your comment they should probably reply to it or dm you
---
I think the write up in the OP is pretty well balanced for \[i\]returning players\[/i\]. I do find it lacking for \[i\]new players\[/i\] however so I will add two important caveats. Bear with me, these will be cons.
---
Cons:
---
4. You dislike multiplayer games in your Fallout experience; areas will be looted before you get there in commonly visited areas; monsters (not loot) respawn on top of you when someone else enters your zone; 
---
5. (PVE) Extremely easy insofar as damage taken and difficulty goes. For anyone that has played survival modes on any of the past three games (FO3, FNV, FO4), Fallout 76 suffers from an embarrassingly low damage curve, both incoming and outgoing.
---
I've found that with my instigating deathclaw gauntlet, I can often hit something with absolutely no damage at all, and then a second hit kills them. The same kind of enemies that have been otherwise taking two hits to kill. So there's definitely something weird going on the last few weeks.
---
damn that one didn't count. i'm just gonna go drown if you want to fast travel to me
---
I'm a poo flinger too.
---
Yeah, I mean I check all the dailies anyway, why not the probably easiest one to get? I have most of the commonly required outfits in storage. Toss it in my go back, and run around doing my other dailies, events, whatnot. See I'm about to level, put on my leveling gear, boom Atoms. 
---
It's almost always easier than drinking 50 beers or whatever.
---
Hmm, first base mod requrements?
---
Wow that sucks. I‚Äôll go wherever you go
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and had the same problem for about ten or so min. I reset my Xbox completely then I was able to join a world on my main without disconnecting. Hopefully this helps some what.
---
Pool table, poker, slot machines, chess and other minigames would make the game more awesome!
---
Duping is cloning an item by exploiting server-sided delays, and duping has been around since launch.
---
Dupers do nothing but cause inflation
---
Is that happening any and everywhere you try to place it or just in a certain area? Maybe moving your camp will help but make sure you blueprint your current camp so you can save it. Thats all i got. Weird bug.
---
Lol I agree with ‚òùüèæ‚òùüèæ‚òùüèæ. Same thing happened to me though ü§êü§êü§ê
---
Read it's an atom shop outfit
---
son of a bitch this is annoiying.
---
You don't need a plan.
---
I mean if that was the case, my ammo giveaways would have gotten me banned by now. I regularly drop 3000x rounds for people as gifts.  I've probably dropped over 10k rounds in one bag a couple times.
---
either leather armor skin.. or Rubber armor, made of car tires. im guessing it would provide more energy resist then leather, but maybe weigh more
---
I keeps mobs from getting in, too. Otherwise, they can just open the door and trash the inside. Usually not a problem, though.
---
I think you need to be deep enough to be swimming but maybe not completely underwater
---
i normally price plans at half the base value, since no one wants to buy plans for very much
---
I tried that, but not for ten minutes. Il try that! Thank you
---
Yeah I figured it might be but I couldnt find it at least on the XB1 version. You think it may be released the 16th or later?
---
Did anyone find the 3rd one?
---
Not sure i understand the question.. but i have the MIRV Mod on standby in my stash, just need the skill, which is a level 5 gunsmith.
---
It might be a skin for the deathclaw gauntlet or death tambo that they put in the atom shop later
---
Im very interested. Its neat looking. May be a good change of pace to my Marine Armor!
---
Its rare to see that happen but it happens.  Someone dropping the bomb in a terrible spot
---
I have absolutely no problem with this bug, Survival kinda sucks
---
Thanks for you reply. It is happening in every area. I'll try on another character because I spent so much time with building this CAMP
---
This would be a very helpful tool for people who would like to play in a group to help knock out a quest.
---
I got mine in Whitespring from one of the faction vendor bots. For a little under 10k caps with the Hard Bargain perk maxed and a grape mentat.
---
The ending tho xD
---
I'm sure as heck hoping so. I'm losing my marbles trying to get my hands on this darn thing.
---
Letters sell for more, maybe even around 1000 caps. Most camp items sell for 75-150 caps, along with crafting recipes. Armor and weapon modifications and plans vary but tend to sell for a bit more, depending on the modification itself. Probably 250-500 for armor and weapons.
---
i got radiation emmiters conntected to switch, if you want rads you just stand here and it gives you enough rads so you can have 15 % hp
---
Nah I don't.
---
Same, I got a survival achievement as well and I‚Äôve never gone in once
---
Fuckin‚Äô eh!
---
I know exactly what happened with the leather worker one. Some guy who doesnt play the game designed this challenge and because he didnt know that deathclaws drop their hands occasionally but not a deathclaw hide item he didnt know that he made a challenge significantly harder than he realized. Simple mistake since all the other animal types drop their respective hide.
---
Can do perk is only 1 point and dog food, each can fills half the bar. I never cook anything and lasts forever and a tonne of cans through the world.
---
Sure you miss some buffs but not too fussed
---
So thanks for the info but don't think I'll use it
---
idk why it keeps killing me. i'm not in deep water
---
I can put mirv mod, then you able to craft standart mod without gunsmith. How about that?
---
Yeah, I made the image to help noobs from creating this problem.  It's a common issue if you drop a nuke over lapping the border of the game.  It bugs the SBQ out and she never comes back.  Hopefully this helps launch nukes so that everyone doesn't waste thier time, nuke cards and hard earned ammo.
---
Oh that never occurred to me! That might work.. ill look and see if it needs any requirements! (Finally understand  hahaha )
---
I can‚Äôt see it. I have no idea what‚Äôs attacking us
---
Cool think it might work! Psn?
---
I think i had queen fly away with nuke inside map, is this 100% thing?
---
oh its a deathclaw
---
Yes and yes
---
Still need one?
---
you still need the water revive right?
---
Some dude was using a automatic Tesla rifle and it had the sound bug that when ever he would hit the Queen it made a punching sound. But then the sound kept going, and going, and going.... sounded like aggressive fapping the whole fight
---
I just killed it. It was completely invisible to me. I had to wait for it to hit me and hammer it in the face
---
You'll get that anytime a Bloodied Build drops a nuke they'll sit on the shed and avoid radiation while doing serious damage against the queen.
---
The risk is worth it.
---
I got the water revive? did you not get it yet?
---
When I kill the bots at WS, I see an inventory flash really quick and then disappear well before I can grab anything. Is there a trick to farming WS bots?
---
Any random kitchen/diner might have one. An easy one to get might be in that little diner in Watoga.
---
I had no idea you could click them to change them... thanks for the info ;)
---
Nope
---
I keep everything around its game price. And it keeps selling, cause people will eventualy choose from 200+ plans :D
---
Talked to Bethesda today. I've had this issue since yesterday. They said they were aware of a small number of accounts that are instant disconnects. They're investigating it. No clue when itll get fixed.
---
&gt;from here
---
You know you‚Äôre on /r/fo76 and not a trading sub right?
---
And I‚Äôm talking about trading via the vendor systems, not one on one. Obviously a TSE for 200 caps would be a dupe, but maybe 6k when it‚Äôs ‚Äúnormally‚Äù 10k, I mean, you‚Äôd probably bite on that too.
---
I haven't got any improved repair kits from any of the scorchbeast yet. I'm sure mine will come.
---
You never died in the water where I could revive you. Yup kept get it g instakilled
---
okay lets try another spot then i guess
---
It could also be argued that since some of them have adapted they arent really ghosts
---
I usually have 10-15 fusion cores. I'm not usually in power armor unless I anticipate a big fight or I'm soloing a silo. I do pick up every fusion core I see though, and I'm seeing less than I usually do. 
---
Best way to get them, I think, is still to do the workshop. I usually play around 2-3am US time, and I haven't had a workshop contested recently.
---
I‚Äôm going to the water park
---
Technicaly it is balanced. Every mod have some positive and negative stats. You can keep original backpack and have only positive, or boost one stat to suit your build at price of loosing another stat.
---
It doea look badass I hope its a weapon ans not just a skin but that's probably what it will be
---
I'm not sure it's related. I've done around 100 SBQ kills, of which 90 were placed over the border and one single SBQ got stuck way off to the northeast. The only notable feature of that game was that almost everyone died to a single legendary radscorpion, so I thought it might be a target-memory glitch.

Thanks!
---
Fallout 4 had a working door mat that set the spawn location.  Why not in 76?
---
I‚Äôm working myself into that position.  But I can‚Äôt understand what they would need them.  Sell more atoms and thus more skins. I would think they‚Äôd want everyone in PA.
---
I just want boss, that is hard because tactic mechanics, not fucking bulletsponge, or onehitting bitch with trilion exploding adds.
---
If he have 100% chance to drop 3* item max level and like 10% to drop mutation serum recipe. I would let my soul be there forever.
---
Well not just that as I did free range solo yesterday with two cows there wasn't another one,so I completed it killing the legendary lvl 80 and I got zero legendary loot from it was gutted.
---
I have 19 cores on my main/stash.  I‚Äôm just saying lately they seem more scarce.  I‚Äôve power user which helps a lot.
---
Well then what's it mean when you say....awwww fuuuck I've been duped!
---
Could you take a photo of this "Sign", it is hard to find something you do not know what it looks like, please
---
I started a new play through recently and missed my Owl mask- came across someone selling them for 1000 caps! Luckily I held off, and got one for 200. I‚Äôve sold a lot of magazines, and level 1 1 Star legendaries I had prices for new people straight out of the vault. I guess they‚Äôre scrip now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I got lucky with this quest as I got a bloodied crossbow with 35% vats last week off a milurk  so this is a keeper.
---
Toxic? Go on gaming subreddit lool.
---
And yeah i may be aggresive on you, because you got my atention, but because i am on mobile i cant copy fucking link from title! So i will never see your damn picture!!!
---
I am on the Xbox platform. I can sell you a full set of t60 power armor with a jetpack 5600 caps.
---
That's pretty much what I had, when I completed one of badges the quest came back. Good luck!
---
Can confirm other users, check your local player vendors. I stumbled on a guy selling some for around 200 caps and grabbed marsupial myself. Best of luck to you friend.
---
This was horrible and painful. Thank you for your help.
---
Just don't. Nobody want's a player like you. Go play Mario Kart or some shit. Leave us alone.
---
Definitely not a ban. I had the same thing happen to me randomly while server hopping. My secondary and fresh build character still work fine. Lol
---
Same to you. Happy trails
---
I killed a big bot at whitesprings as I was doing the kill robots with a black powder weapon for atoms and that thing glitches and all I heard was it's machine guns for about a hour round the back as I done this,it was driving me mad.
---
Legendary 42-62 golfer ghouls do spawn, even 2 and 3\*s; I got a few of them but only dropped 1\* items.
---
It usually takes a minute but that screen you see comes back.
---
As far as I know Grenadier doesn't affect TSE. I've seen people saying otherwise.
---
So?
---
You‚Äôre problem is your mother fuckering the wrong guy.  Kipper makes sure charred ghouls have adequate cotton yarn.  Skippy is the drill guy.   Skippy is the mother fucker you seek.
---
Good to know.
---
The camp building is not working properly. It gives me a very short height limit, won't let me build past two stories high. Two days ago I couldn't remove any floors, ended up breaking down half of my camp I worked on for a long time. Then decided to move it nearby. Tried to build it all day but would keep saying out of build area when I'd try to add a third story. So I spent hours trying then gave up, hope it gets fixed so I can keep playing fallout
---
does buying them add to this badge though ? since it is a challenge also
---
Are you on PS4? If yes, do you have carry capacity plan still in inventory? (Due to bug)
---
I've never been a part of that kind of community, so I don't know how common it is... but I had a couple friends that did this kind of thing back in the day.  Some people out there get more of a kick out of breaking games than playing them the way they're intended. It's not about beating anyone or anything, and it's not about playing the game on easy mode. Their account would get banned and they'd just make a new one further down the road when they circled back around.
---
I imagine it's harder to do now with things like VAC and the way launchers are structured. Donno, though. I haven't talked to either of them in ages. One of them ended up working in QA for a software company while he was going through college so it paid off.
---
In your quest log, you can hit R1, assuming you're on PS4, and it will pull up your map directly on the quest location.
---
I will never understand this subs idea that there is some YouTube conspiracy about Fallout 76. Like it‚Äôs not even popular to hate on the game any more. The game is an afterthought now. Where it belongs.
---
Ok lol
---
helpful info though, thankyou
---
Then- and stay with me on this- just use the flamer and accept lower dps and more grind. I just use it sparingly, but if I want to use it I use it and its fine, doesn't run out in an actual 12 seconds. Just nice short bursts lmao
---
I need to revive someone also.  GT is Bodhin101
---
They sometimes hide under map icons. A trick is to hit your melee button on your quest in pipboy, itll take you to the map spot.
---
Yeah fuck‚Äôem.   If his buddies were around he‚Äôd talk that condescending bullshit.  No sympathy.  9 pellets right to his fucking eye.
---
any reason why you say that?

From earlier today...

Me too!
---
Kreankorm, I make camp in the northwest portion of the Cranberry Bog, east of the Fort
---
Do you have one?
---
The .308 hardened receiver does higher damage than the standard .50 ones. Until I find the hardened .50 one I'm sticking to .308.
---
Something changed the camp building. Won let me build higher than two to three stories without saying I'm out of build area.
---
yeah I read that, just really seeing others opinions here and to see if I can use the vpn for the launcher thing. Probably jsut gonna delete the post now though.
---
Really?? I thought they did that to dissuade people from killing WS bots. like.. "no loot here, go kill something else."
---
Ounce of prevention quest had a reliable spawn South of Charleston capital building marker.
---
So much pvp, haven't seen in dayz
---
We don't know if the same loot picking logic will be applied to these Purveyor leveled lists. By best biased regular drop was a series of Gatling Guns with 3 times the uniform chance. Unfortunately, the loot drop amount might just have been lowered around and now it becomes even more difficult to measure.
---
I bumped into this encounter too, he was kneeling on the ground surrounded by dead super mutants, now that I know he isn't hostile, I feel bad for killing him :(
---
I dunno. On logging in tonight I had to tru seven different times before my camp would load. People might abuse afk'inf to do just that, only without a cap sink.
---
Prolly not feasible, but I'd love it.
---
i wasnt aware of the buff. i just saw it did more damage
---
Thanks! I never knew this. Solves everything
---
Would you like some help with your build? Seriously. There's no reason you should fear anything at that level.
---
Give him some milk of human kindness.
---
It was the second-to-last update. It's in the patchnotes. something like "completely redid interior of morgantown airport and created new appropriate encounters". I ran through it last night and I don't recall any of the basement stuff nor the location of the key. I think all that is new, but the upstairs seemed largely the same.
---
JS chops here too. We can do a lot with that blob of JSON, yes we can.
---
sure, im still online
---
I haven't played that much since P9 but so far, [nothing promising](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=2122967287). 
---
Unfortunately, we don't know the actual legendary spawn chances as it is most likely decided on the server (otherwise, you could just patch a few bytes in the client and have 100% spawns).
---
The Swarm of Suitors event near the Scout camp always spawns some for me.
---
If you are trying to complete the world challenge for a picture of a Mirelurk Hunter, you can go to Glassed Caverns to the first large room with buildings. On the left side of the room is a dead Mirelurk Queen and Hunter.   
---
If you need them alive, well there is a pond in the north part of mire or the cranberry patch south west of Watoga Station. Problem is, I think their spawning is related to the level of the person generating the cell, so a higher level person might not see the often, atleast that has been my experience.
---
In case you missed this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia\_my\_project\_which\_can\_automatically/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia_my_project_which_can_automatically/)
---
He's got a map that shows the 3 places to get royal jelly.
---
Is it really a good thing though? 76 is a shitshow
---
There is a farm just south east of the watoga train station. Tons of mirelurks of different variety, including a queen most of the time.
---
How much better?
---
I've been serving hoping at that location. Maybe I'm just having bad luck but no hunter.
---
Breaking the world map down into tiles and porting to something like Mapbox could help improve resolution and allow for moar zoom.
---
Nuce, but um sure theyd use some variation of the US or dixie flag.
---
I just need a picture. Thanks!
---
I enjoy seeing people appreciate my camp, and seeing some of the cool stuff others have built, at the same time, as I shop around I see so many horrible eye sore camps.
---
The only time I've ever had her fly off the map was when Delta was left out.   It's all situational.
---
How many people use it in this game?
---
Should have stopped at one. Its a known bug. Archery, Athletics, and Swimming are mentioned by people often but swimming requires a friend.
---
Supposedly you can but it's rare
---
Corn soup for AP regen. It‚Äôs great....
---
Ooh! Thank you!!
---
I know this may be a long shot, but how about fauna? Despite all of my hours, never have I ever seen a rabbit. Also, need those pictures. The mammalogist challenge feels like slogging through mud.
---
Expect my custom
---
Imagine bitching online about a game you don‚Äôt even play. What a loser
---
Yes. I'm up to 7 now.
---
The hunter is on the metal ramp that leads into the water in front of the queen in the back left of the room from your view as you enter the room.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
I've gotten 5 so far, smores recipe,and campfire tales tent plans. Done it atleast 20 times on different characters.  If you get one at the end when you get caps it will show a possum icon instead of a cap. It wont actually say you gor one in rewards recieved text.
---
This was already an exploit they had to address in a patch, it was happening at the MODUS vendors. A player would sell an item to MODUS and then it could be bought back at all 4 terminals at once making 4 copies of that item. If you remember for some time only one terminal was available to use for each department in the Enclave bunker, it would also seem that is the exploit that had to be fixed again as only one of each MODUS can be used after the patch yesterday.

13 badges from day and half.

That's how I understood it as well, the Berkeley Springs station is the Purveyors station.

I had my extra masks at that price for that reason! People are crazy with somethings lol Actually had someone buy my owl mask when i was online a few hours ago. Ill have to drop weapon prices when i get on tm bc nobody's biting and i need that stash space
---
Queen only bro

Trading vendor would then work as a fridge and that can't be allowed. Bethesda purposely increased spoil rate because they are planning to sell fridges as microtransactions on atomic shop. That's good tactic but shameful. First we all thought it's a bug but Bethesda has not reacted to it in any ways nor tried to fix it meaning they do it on purpose. Otherwise they would have at least mentioned they know the issue and are trying to solve it. But if food would spoil the normal rate, we wouldn't need to buy fridges. So no, you just can't sell food on vendor :(
---
I like this idea! but I have a feeling how a lot of messages will go... lol
---
I just got the cooking tonight after a difficult grind for scorchbeast meat for that meatball grinder and I have the mammalian I think it‚Äôs called for mostly taking pictures of animals. I‚Äôm close on the entomologist. I just need a moth man wing and to do the lighthouse event.
---
Thanks everyone for the response. I just got a badge from it myself. Adventure is out there!
---
Bet you a dollar that support would be all over it if you emailed them saying "I'm trying to buy Atom Caps with real money but it won't work."
---
In addition to what the other person said, they don't drop from her. You get 3 as a reward for completing the scorched earth event.
---
What platform are you on?
---
When you first sell items it gives you a suggested price to sell said item. I ignore that and just sell it for about 200% cheaper. You can set whatever price you want.
---
If it‚Äôs junk to me who cares if I gain a profit from it. Just let someone else have fun and explore your base you took hours to make most likely
---
Whaaaa. Lol. PS4. RNG and I have never been on good terms really.
---
Yooooo! BETH lmao
---
There's no hardened .50 cal. The best one is called refined .50 cal and does more damage than a hardened .308
---
&gt; the "mystery" behind the "sometimes there, sometimes not" camp icon on the map. Walk up to it, machine turns on, walk away... turns off.
---
ooh, that's a good idea. rewards people for adventuring.
---
Mistiqe hits it on the head. Suppose we have the regular backpack at 60, then a mod with no drawbacks for 120. No one will ever use the 60 unless they're currently in the process of earning the 120. To keep the default viable (I know this sounds odd), they add a drawback to something else because they're adding more capacity.  
---
Personally, I would have preferred the 120 capacity to incur a movement speed penalty of say 15% and you are still able to fast travel when not over encumbered but not modify your resistances. You are giving up a little speed which can be dangerous in some situations to carry far more junk. Seems logical.
---
You know...often after patches, I will spawn near my camp, but in the river and below the game world.  I have to "swim" under the terrain and eventually I get to the surface of the water and I can climb up on land...
---
I wonder if that represents "the center" of my little CAMP.  It usually only happens after patches, as I said; usually when I log in, it doesn't happen.
---
Ew, gross!!!
---
Did you acquire a mod for backpack even if you had not gotten the backpack yet?
---
I keep getting told this. I love your positivity!!!
---
I have no idea, I didnt notice any new mods in my mods tab. Last thing I did was throw on my .50 receiver I think.
---
Every time someone gets a syringe or drill from a legendary, the bat-signal lights up at developer headquarters. They all laugh and congrat each other on trolling another player.
---
Craft one at a tinker bench if you‚Äôve unlocked it.
---
I'm the same, half the base value for most and face value for rare and hard to find ones, Ultracite I set at 100 caps each as they are dropped like candy from the SBQ fights.
---
I can‚Äôt, it says I require a broken prosnap deluxe camera, but the only place I could get one was the tourists, it‚Äôs like once it‚Äôs gone it‚Äôs gone forever
---
I cant believe you've done this!
---
Oh crap, I thought it just took a regular broken prosnap.
---
I thought the same, still on the hunt i guess
---
You can but it‚Äôs very uncommon. I‚Äôve done it 12 times &amp; got 2. I could just be unlucky thoughü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The broken prosnap can be found in random containers and appears in your misc tab. I have 6 of them currently but not sure if it can be traded. Are you on PC, if so I can log on and give you one
---
Ummm, no...
---
no upvote or downvote, don't want Beth to get wind of this bug, getting that Gat in adventure was a wonderful bonus.
---
I love the name of your shop. I only had the Greek letter set to work with so I called mine Boobz Booz n Boomz.
---
Wait you had 10 possum badges alrdy? How is that possible?
---
Jesus it just doesn‚Äôt get any more unfunny than you. Have you ever even made a person laugh before? you know, not AT you, that doesn‚Äôt count.
---
It's easy to find out if you visit any camp with them, the prompt comes up as soon as you mouse over them, so it's hardly a secret. It's a very slow process to change them, though. I suppose it's just the most boring form of griefing that could possibly be done.
---
Oh dude you‚Äôre a legend, Yeah I‚Äôm on PC, my IGN is Maximus4153. Are you sure it‚Äôs a broken Prosnap Deluxe and not just a regular broken prosnap? I‚Äôve been teased by the game with them before
---
They have been showing up randomly in toolboxes and safes.  Read that on here earlier today and then noticed I had five in my inventory in the Misc section.  If you are on XBox, I'll give you one.
---
welcome :D
---
I‚Äôm on in PS4 so most fixes I know are for that. But did come across somebody who told me when I met them in the game. Their game become unplayable. Turns out they had too many friends and after removing more than 300 they could play again. That‚Äôs what they said and I can‚Äôt verify that for you. So do that at your own risk.
---
I‚Äôm sure you may have done this but have you deleted the game entirely from the XBOX including all save files and then reloaded it again? Is there a database rebuild feature on XBOX like PS4 maybe do that? Feel your pain and hope there‚Äôs a fix
---
The only dupe I do is 'Super Duper' üëç
---
I‚Äôm on PC, but thanks for the offer. And it‚Äôs good to know that you‚Äôre able to get them after doing the quest, thanks a lot!
---
no balloons.
---
Directly South if the Charleston capital building map marker there's the reliable spawn used in the ounce of prevention quest.
---
The moment you make an attempt call someone unfunny (for a statement that wast attempting to be funny i might add) is the moment you should probably realise you arent funny. Whats got your panties in such a big bunch? Did i insult your favorite game? You gunna cry. Jesus dude you want to find the looser just look in the fucking mirror
---
I logged in to double check, it is the broken prosnap deluxe but I tried to drop one and it gives me the same message as the backpacks, item can't be dropped and will be deleted instead. Couldn't put it in the vendor either.
---
So i guess I'm stuck with them, sorry for getting your hopes up. I did find two tonight in Burrows if that helps any.
---
You can do the queen fight there's always a few of everything that spawns there
---
No worries man, thanks for trying! Guess i‚Äôll have to keep looking, thanks again!
---
What other effects/perks do you have? My [weapon calculator](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) was tuned to P8.5 and I can get 141 damage with Adrenaline 5 and 1 kill. I can get 175 damage with Adrenaline 5 and 4 kills.
---
This has happened to me a couple times now. Sleepy scooting ghouls is really unsettling. They seem to die easy enough though.
---
All I had on was 60%, demo rank 5 and bloody mess rank 3
---
Still do. Found one today along the path to free range farm in the mire.
---
i found it, but i don‚Äôt seem to be able to tame it.
---
Power armor mods like jetpacks. Stable flux. Bulk junk.
---
Yeah I can see I really pushed your button with the not funny thing. That‚Äôs all you can seem to talk about. The only funny thing about you is that you‚Äôre so delusional you think that someone who whines and cries about games he doesn‚Äôt even play is actually in a position to call OTHER people losers LMAO. Or ‚Äúloosers‚Äù lmao
---
Or plans?
---
Plans for a backpack or mods for one? Not sure I seen those either.
---
The spawn points moved I believe.
---
No amount of health regeneration can outpace DPS of an AA Minigun (or even a regular one, those things are crazy good), unless it's the Free Range event legendary sheepsquash or some other event boss. The guy put 500 bullets into a supermutant and had to stop shooting and start shooting again to kill it. And it's not the fluid regeneration, it's snapping back hp chunks by a big amount when you stop shooting. That's a bug.
---
Happens to me too, for example on my bloodied char when I use something that's not one shotting... After each bullet the hp snaps back up significantly and I have to shoot the mob more than each shot would suggest is needed.
---
Now I think I'm done and the frog habitat is bugged. Fuck
---
Upstairs at Camp McClintock
---
So no mutations and no chems?
---
Plan. but its a theory i had
---
I didn't want to kill him either, I genuinely felt bad. Justice for the injured mutant!
---
You fear what you dont understand, and like many before the war you persecute what you fear.
---
What survivour of the vault isn't at the very least a genocidal murder hobo?
---
I think you can trade it, I sold a repaired camera for 2.5k to some kid desperate to do the quest.
---
I want to love fallout 76, i WANT to. But despite all the love i have for survival games, this doesn't tickle that sweet spot between survival and fallout I was hoping for, and that is okay. The game has come a long way, and i am gladder than I can express to know people are happy with the game.
---
Plastic / Adhesive / Acid / steel
---
Oooo where's that?
---
Its all about placement of the nuke my team and I get fissure site prime on the border of the nuke ring so that forward alpha is out of the nuke zone. Which 85% of the time we can fight her outside of the nuke zone
---
what did, uh, pressing e to go, do?
---
Okay and what's a reasonable price for each?
---
The green hood also spawns at the Pleasant Valley Train Station.  Right outside the entrance is a skeleton laying on some suitcases and it will spawn under his head.  Location also spawns the plain sack hood.
---
Honestly I'm  not sure, this one has worked pretty well so far, I might just keep using it and keep the canvas one in a box till the nylon gives out.
---
I may be wrong, but I don't \*\*think\*\* you can trade them?
---
Had the same issue until I realized that i can bash it with syringer for more damage. Took the health down enough with a assault rifle.
---
Beeing quite low on caps, wanting plans and items that cost a lot (like whitespring plans and serums) , I would like to sell a few of the items I know people go bananas over on the marketplace. I wouldn't charge the 40 000 caps I've seen some items go for, but it's still a supply/demand market for a few items so I'd like a fair tradeoff between cheap price and insane. So I think the other advice I got where I should think about what I would be willing to pay is a better one. The prices they suggest are ridiculous compared to the "real" vendors on some items. On others I agree with your suggestion.
---
Synths are the product of dupers.
---
Interesting. With the calculator, I get only 130 dmg for a TSE 50 Cal with 60% Heavy Gunner, Bloody Mess 3 and Demo Expert 5. A non-legendary 50 cal will give me 79 damage.
---
Yea i killed like 200 creatures and not even a dent in the dame thing now i have to scavenge the waste for 1 to use
---
It does, I‚Äôve fixed several ProSnaps already
---
After defeating the scorchbeast queen, the wander returned to his camp. The safe haven, was safe once more. At leat for now. The scorchbeast queen's presence gave every resident of Appalachia a purpose. Finding allies trough mutual cause. Now that the threat is gone, how long will the forged bonds remain. Rumors are already emerging about independent factions. Dangerous wanderers, armed with explosive, calling themselves The Boomers. Reports are coming in about  Wanderers who took hiding in the mountains, creating and consuming self made chems. Groups of thughs roaming Appalachia, robbing other vault dwellers.
---
The people of Appalachia who survived the bombs and the scorched, did so by utilizing the best trait humans have. The ability to adapt... This war isn't over. It has just begun.   
---
Because war... War never changes.
---
I encountered the sheepsquatch first in the middle of the road with a herd of albino deer nearby. Terrible time to be out of stimpacks, but plenty of lead put it down.
---
Considering sa lot of the products need a workbench every three minutes I feel like he's got it covered üòÇ
---
It's the sentry bots you want that have fusion cores. The big 3 wheeled one with big guns. You have to be pretty close to it to be able to get two cores from one bot. Also near the monument below whitesprings they have tracked protectrons that some times caries cores.
---
I work all day on this stupid badge thing and for the last step to be bugged. That's stupid.
---
Just keep building until the patch the bug, then the first one you build after the patch will work
---
It did :( I took a few lol
---
yeah, i know which bots. it's just that ALL the bots at WS seem to disappear their loot within microseconds of dying. i see the loot flash into the box and then immediately it disappears. someone else said if i wait a minute it'll come back, so i'll give that a shot tomorrow
---
Sadly nothing, or at least I didn't notice anything. Could have been running a Deathclaw in circles, who knows
---
yeah i'm probably never going to get a backpack if this is the only way to get them.
---
There's one is lucky hole mine
---
Damn. I wish I'd known that earlier.
---
It's still useful information for anyone yet to complete it yet though.
---
the only way to turn vending off is to either remove everything from the machines, or remove the machine itself.
---
attaching power only makes it show up on the map, it doesn't need it to actually function.
---
The customer who defrauds the company would still be guilty of theft in your example.
---
I was smart and used my perk cards when crafting my crossbow; 200% condition and I barely had enough stuff to make it in first place. It took me like 200 enemies before it was broken enough to be fixed...
---
... Yes. Yes you would.
---
You have to build your whole camp out of frogs.
---
Yeah I‚Äôd also love to know where this buildable house is located!
---
That white church though üëèüëèüëè
---
yea a way not to show it would be fair since costumes that already have a backpack don't show the new ones
---
Check out what a vendor sells them for and price lower. Except screws you can sell for what a vendor charges
---
What are you talking about, Fallout 76 is a one-time purchase.
---
I'm currently meleeing my way through the wasteland with my instigating deathclaw gauntlet. it murders everything sufficiently. 
---
however, I had to pull a switchblade and shank a wolf for a merit badge, and was amazed how well it worked.
---
Yeah, right
---
Hi do you still need to do this water reviving?
---
If so i can jump online in about an hour &amp; we cam help each other
---
It's Beth's fault that they left so many duped items in game. That was such a bad decision - now people dupe again to get even with the ones that duped in the past and have all that awesome stuff that Beth didn't take from them. It's a f*cked up circle... They should've deleted all duped items and still delete them period in addition to working on making duping impossible in the first place. 
---
I mean I don't get how it would work anyway, wouldn't an item have a Unique ID and if it gets duped that ID would be in the world twice? then just delete the newer one and done. 
---
Or they would need to have the loot drop twice to be able to dupe which can be prevented too I assume. Just talking out of my behind but I think there should be possibilities like this no?
---
This is what I like to see :)
---
Just found something else out too that i didnt know.  I repaired them all already, but if I go to drop them, they will be destroyed, so those are a no go.  When I find more Im just keeping them as is for when this happens to others.
---
This is what I plan to do, just need 10 radscorpion stingers, which might take a while. Do you know of any good spawn points for radscorpions? I'm currently wandering near Grafton Station and some do occasionally spawn there, but not often, maybe I should just server hop?
---
Nope. Unless they borked something in yesterday's maintenance backpacks are non transferable.
---
Moreover we cannot 'make' mods... removing/replacing the existing mod on an object does not create a mod 'crate' out of the existing one like in FO4, it destroys it (that behaviour is meh if you ask me, but w/e, another thing to change for the better once private servers are out).
---
So unless OP is asking to suggest a price for the plan itself I don't understand the question.
---
$$$
---
Find a higher cliff. Bird bones isn't going to protect you as much as you think
---
I feel the same. I put a lot of effort into making it look homely - unlike thise utility shacks with the bare necessities. Just yesterday someone stopped by while I was there and gave me the heart emote. They didn't buy anything but that's okay ^^ (although I should probably reconsider the prices of my wares...)
---
Don't drink toxic water to quickly or your game crashes
---
I thought the classical music from the Juke just plays automatically when you come back to CAMP. It's annoying when you arrive to have it playing while trying to hear where the Scorched groaning is coming from before they start shooting your place. Is there a way to turn it off until you want it?
---
Yup! And that damn syringer!
---
What I have done with all my toons is:
---
\- Get down to undies.
---
\- Walk into shallow body of water of your choice.
---
\- Let rads build up until health is in the 5-10% mark.
---
\- Shoot at one's feet with explosive shottie.
---
I have had a very high success rate using this method. Helps having camp on the shores of such body of water.
---
It still counts if you use another weapon then the last few shots are the syringer.
---
That's really sad, I'd be gutted if my account was banned I almost feel like, given this current resurfacing of the subject, completly deleting my stash and only keep one basic weapon just incase something I recently bought from a player vendor was the result of dupping. And starting over.
---
i built 4 levels of stairs in camp and then jumped, this worked for me
---
10 times and no badge here ;/
---
I find, if you center the diamond on the compass, the map arrow then points towards the diamond as well. Easy enough to follow a line, even if its across the map.
---
To seneca rocks it is. lol
---
Sounds perfect for my camp, thanks! will try it out soon.
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
Dark brown instead of light brown. Soooo yeah totally not worth it
---
You know the gazebo at WS? The one with the fountain that cures all diseases? Occasionally there will be a bunch of radscorpions that spawn there. Lately though it seems it's been mostly Yao Guais. I donno if they alternate which enemy spawns there on a weekly basis but a while ago I killed several Grafton Monsters there too.
---
Awesome. Sounds totally worth it haha
---
Yeah I built one outside as well but it just looks so naff.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing, without this trick I‚Äôd never find it at all lol
---
I plowed my one with a bowie knife till it was almost dead than I shot it a few times with the modded version that deals 30 rad damage over a few seconds.
---
Really don't need that much overkill. Plenty of cliffs in the Savage divide, might as well try them out and see for yourself just how good bird bones works- for future reference, of course.
---
Well I sell plans 50-200$ / treasure maps 30$ / 1 star legendaries 50$ / 2 star legendaries 100$ / Some clothes like Brotherhood fatigues for 10-50$ / random items like hallucinogen gas canisters ect. 10$... But still I have gotten nothing solf because people either hunt half free *** legendaries, super rare stuff that no one would never sell or just casually hoping to see anything new. And when you go to other players camps, they have like "lvl 5 pocket knife 10000$" so that's why not many wants to visit camps.
---
= 24,000 lbs of stimpacks.
---
try the pink vendor at whitesprings (the one that sells gold and silver items) everytime i have checked her inventory she has one, she is in the same shop as the mall vendor
---
Jesus Christ, they're still duping in this game?! Glad I stopped playing in early January.
---
Bethesda, just throw in the towel. Drop any and everything you are working on and work on modding support. Modders will have it fixed in one or two weeks.
---
add private servers on top of that, and you have yet another title that will be a cash cow for many years to come.
---
Just the badges are enough to keep you busy for weeks and weeks, either that or go for the platinum
---
He hasn‚Äôt even started the intro mission he says lol

This duping has made everything impossible to trade for unless you already have duper tier gear. Look at my post history, I was about to trade for my 4th piece of sent assassin gear, but the guy who offered the piece was swayed by someone with 7 trade karma, and an imgur album full of aae/tse guns, including a legacy laser. Seven fucking karma. He has been away from the game and is coming back, and has a page of all the god-tier guns, ready to trade for a full set I've been trying to trade for for months. That is the fucking problem with duping. And now it looks like we get a full weekend of it. Economy that was just recovering is now fucked again.
---
It's been data mined it should be coming with one of this months content
---
Perfect, thank you. Makes my decision not to get it easier
---
These are the ones left playing 76. They're complete whales dude.
---
Hey thats my name, been running it in GTA since the offices were a thing.
---
As is for me
---
None of us have them haha
---
Better yet an arcade cabinet! That would be an instant purchase for me
---
Of course plan, cause it is bugged and you keep plan even after learning it.
---
If you get a black popup with numbers and some message about not having credentials or some such then that means that the server is still offline. 
---
This week has been exceptional in that there was the patch update, then the hot fix because of all the issues found and then yesterday an urgent fix for an exploit.
---
Better than Pro Jared‚Äôs tbh
---
Not wrong at all. I used to love when out exploring coming across a CAMP at random and seeing how they did it. Always respectful, never pinched their resources and made sure to wave a friendly hello if they showed up just in case they were worried i was going to wreck it. If anyone is on PS4, drop by mine. Haven't set up vending yet, but I'm just at the top of the nature trail leading from Flatwoods, or side of the main road near the New River bridge opposite the New River Gorge Resort. Feel free to look around, use the crafting stations and Public Stash box.
---
Well see it might have been a mass server disconnect
---
It happened to me once during the scorchbeast queen raide everyone got disconnected then we where sent to new server and people rage quite
---
Ps4?
---
Mama dolce‚Äôs food processing plant has one too
---
It‚Äôs bugged for everyone yes.
---
Wait...a quick follow up. Before I go a climbin' up to find some of the "correct" Royal Jelly, since it is in Aid and not Junk, does that mean it can spoil? If so, that is some Grade A Bovine Excrement.
---
Brahmin Pen is the plan for the fertilizers thing. Even though it's not a pen, she just wanders around your camp and fills the wheelbarrow with fertilizer (well trained!)
---
The patch from like 3 months back fixed a lot of issues with moving camp. Even bases with a 2x3 or 3x3 foundations are fairly easy to move. I have a 3x2 blueprint I made for workshops with crafting, turrets, bed, etc I can put down in seconds. Also a trick for main camps is don't try to blueprint everything in one go do separate blueprints, lot easier to move then.
---
They are next level painful to craft fyi
---
How do you even start that event
---
I've been rocking the asylum outfit and hat since for a while now and it pairs nicely with the standard backpack skin. I'm your friendly wasteland medic. ‚ô°
---
I wanted to do same but problem would seem to be that Good With Salt perk slows spoilage when food is in your inventory but the bending machine is your stash so it doesn't work there. 
---
It would seem reasonable for the vending machine to be refrigerated really ... its massive enough after all!
---
I have 10 broken ProSnaps. In 2 hours from now I will be able to login. Could trade one for a revivaL if you wish.
---
Objective response to a subjective question? Uuuh I don't think it works like that.
---
can you show us that video?
---
Awesome, how did I miss that?? Thanks!
---
What console are you on?
---
Scorch beast is not unrealistic at all. In many cultures in mythology they had some sort of lore about dragons. Scorchbeast is basically a dragon, some giant beast with huge wingspans with some sort of breath attack.
---
It has a possum logo on it too
---
Tomorrow around this time ill nuke
---
Is it still bugged? I thought they rushed to fix that.
---
Same
---
New favorite insult.
---
Are you sure they‚Äôre the deluxe version though? I‚Äôve had a few people try to drop them or trade them and it‚Äôs said they‚Äôll be destroyed.
---
I KNEW IT!
---
Google where Camp Adams is, hop servers until you find one where it's nighttime, complete the event that pops up. 25 - 50% chance of reveiving the recipe, as well as possum badges/points.
---
But there's no way to know unless you try. And you don't know if you should try until you do some serious research.

Yes, I used my hand made to get him down to almost dead...

In the managers office at whitesprings
---
How do you start the event?
---
A knife?! That's hard core. Those bears are mean.
---
Exactly! Gotta look into it. There is no "one-size-fits-all" answer to why you should/shouldn't do anything. People have different/similar tastes. We're all something/something. SOME PEOPLE ARE THE SAME BUT SOME ARE NOT.

Shoot at your feet with a gamma gun, you'll die of Rads in less than a second xD

You can buy 3 maps from vending machines, thats all i know.

Thanks! I'll write you if I farm them

If they were negligent enough not to find those two simple UI bugs, it's 100% believable they just don't test or care enough to find bigger ones like the dupe bugs.

Tried her, she has broken prosnaps but not the deluxe versions :(

Also lead for ammo and springs for power armor.

Got to camp adams, bottom left corner of the map above the Ash heap region. Just server hop till it starts
---
It was fixed as of 10 hours ago, as it dissapeared for me after clicking the plan
---
Yea, they are in the misc section. And I will repair one or try to trade it. I have collected at least 5 yesterday.
---
It's things like this that will make FO76 a brilliant game in the end, the creativity and randomness of the developers to add stuff like this is amazing. Though this is so sad :(

I hate when i get to last phase and girl start singing about bugs. When i don't have tesla riflr with me, it is pain!!

So yeah sometimes bugs, sometimes wendigo.

Head over to the Giant Teapot, and server hop for 5 minutes. There will be a dead tourist lying on one of the picknick tables, and they're carrying the camera.
---
It appears that once you‚Äôve completed the quest, they no longer carry the camera
---
The trick is not to die.
---
Na I've got a real nice bowie knife. Only time i have problems dealing with enemies is when they stunlock me. And scorchbeast because I can't fly.
---
Thanks! Now I see. here is vending locations:  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/U-Mine-It!\_vending\_machine](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/U-Mine-It!_vending_machine)
---
Oh my fucking god :D 
---
I could have it three times on PC, but PS4 players don't care..... Screw that. Lets grind.
---
apparently after being fixed they can‚Äôt be dropped or traded, however i‚Äôm not sure whether they can be dropped or traded if they‚Äôre still broken
---
Everywhere, in the schools you have some nice economy wonderglue, in the military camps you have the military grade ducktape
---
And later that quest you get is to find mud, like when you are doing treasure maps, in marked area, it can take a moment till you find one.
---
Plant tato, mutfruit and corn then get the green thumb perk to double what you pick.. cooking station into veg starch which scraps into adhesive üëç
---
Anglers drop a decent amount so I'd check the Toxic Valley and Mire regions. Factories also tend to have duct tape rolls or packs.
---
3 in the mining vending machine at one time, not sure about how long it takes until you can buy them again. Probably a 24 hour thing
---
20lbs with those effects? I would scrap both.
---
I had a guy sit at the terminal for Uranium Fever until the event timer ended :\ Not sure if the guy was trolling or AFK or what, but it sucked missing out on the event because someone decided to not start it.
---
not just the queen it happened against the sheep squatch imposter last night.
---
to add more to the other response, the mods you learn for any ‚Äúcombat‚Äù armour can be applied to any of the types.  
---
youll see people say BOS combat armour as well, but thats a mod.  
---
the three types arent just combat either, its def initely 3 types, maybe all.
---
Interesting, yesterday i repriced 200plans same way and nothing disapeared.
---
Go kill scorch beast queen's I am sitting on like 50 repair packs. I will never buy with atoms because never a need too. I carry like 4 weapons with me at all times, so if one break I switch and repair back at camp.
---
I dont see it as much of a problem in adventure either. You have 10 options.
---
Armour. Ranged. Mele in combinations of 1,2 or 3 stars. And a 3 star pure random.
---
Your real choice is to have more chances to get something you can use or less but having more legendary effects.
---
Make your own, x3 Tato, x3 Mutfruit, x3 Corn + Purified water. Craft at cooking station to give x1 Vegetable Starch then scrap to give x2 Adhesive.
---
The Ghoulish perk will save your life!
---
Id take the vampire one off your hands for a reasonable price!
---
Good (for me).
---
I am finding earning badges... a little bit on the tedious side.
---
Not sure how long I could have kept it up before going \*fuck it, let's exploit the motherfucker\*.
---
* Location of Aluminium
---
* Location of Power Armor
---
Get tato, corn, mutfruit and purified water to create vegetable starch. Plant the veggies in your garden and use green thumb perk for double the yield. Also use white knight perk in agility to minimize armor damage and gunsmith in intelligence for weapon damage. I think makeshift warrior is for melee weapons.
---
Grinding the scout events.
---
A lot? Lol? I'd say around half the people I see in a given day are in power armor.
---
have a shortage of a resource? PICK UP EVERYTHING.
---
Just open everything, in watoga I found like 3 of them and yep it's the Deluxe version
---
Since you clearly have never heard of it, here, use this in the future:
---
Google.com
---
You can thank me later.
---
Auto aim? you mean Vats Matrix Overlay?
---
Just let something shoot you like a liberator at the vault or scorch .. depending ... might help if you in PA ... sometimes doesn't work, if it doesn't jump in PA and try it
---
the cap limit is 25k caps? well on ps4 it is
---
Oh, neat. So how do you do it?
---
Have you ever met Partysnax?
---
He F U C K S
---
No, but I have the feeling I'm walking into a joke...
---
I dont know the word in English... It makes the enemys Red xD
---
Its a safe one.   
---
Go over to r/skyrim and tell them anyone who ever ate people should die.  
---
Dont mind your karma, its worth it.
---
I am on PC. :(
---
Maybe instead of complaining what other people do with their money, you should get off your neighbors‚Äô wifi and get your own. Game is, and always has played as smooth as expected for me.
---
Nuka cola plant has a good amount of glue and duct tape plus ghouls drop it pretty regularly
---
Targeting hud. it does not auto aim. it only highlights potentially hostile NPC
---
Nobody said IRK are useless. They're great, but atom shop RK are bullshit
---
Imposter gives 1 too
---
Jep this is what i mean xD
---
I got bugs the first 3 times and the wendigo the next two times
---
As a power armor build user i can safely say. Nah. 
---
&gt;!my opinion is not worth much here!&lt;
---
Vampire is actually pretty great I was able to get though a whole SBQ with no healing needed
---
After TSE nerf no. Event with decent bloodied gear i can be easily killed by mirelurk queen for example.
---
If you ever feel that way, pick a fight with a random player who is 50+  you'll start to remember what death feels like haha
---
Ok, got it. Bad day :-)
---
Man, you must be one lucky bastard then because I‚Äôve ransacked Watoga and can‚Äôt even find one
---
If you don't find anyone to help you - &gt; One way (i heard) to do it solo is to go to kill  Imposter Sheepsquatch (encryptid event) and revive people there. There are lots of water there where you can stand. You need to be in water, not the person who you revive.
---
I can help you. dignite - add me
---
Thanks bud adding now ign smokeyninjas
---
Ah sorry, didnt see the description
---
New cameras spawn in loot containers, including Scorchbeast guano piles! Perhaps check those at fissure site prime? Should be 3-4 of em there
---
I went to stand in water until health was down and threw a grenade at my feet
---
Hypothetical scenarios about minor glitches are really beside my point - that point being, glitches or exploits requiring a great deal of involvement and specific actions on behalf of the player are going to be missed by virtually any QA team.
---
Mh I found one in the junkyard, the workshop one, can't remember the name. Also you should visit the location you're supposed to, like the red rocket station, maybe you could find one. And no I'm not a lucky one, just a rat that loves to look in every containers the game has to offer ü§ì
---
Thanks for the tip! I‚Äôll check it out
---
I‚Äôve learned to move before the camp spawns but man did I get stuck a heap
---
cool join my game if you can
---
Funny on a couple levels. #BethesdaLogic
---
Which is the real problem, as the wood Armor itself is good for sneak.
---
I remember just having a bed, stash box and cooking station in the forest to call home. Times were hard back then
---
I don't care. I even usually reduce my prices further from the "recommended" prices by another 5-50%, especially if it's a relatively common plan.
---
coming now do you know a good place to go down? if not i do
---
Thanks! But how much  brahmin milk  i need?
---
It worked?
---
Nah you just gotta find some major gutsys that use bullets to be reminded that you are still killable
---
yeah thanks man one down three to go please :)
---
I took down 2 Yao Guai, one with a shotgun for that challenge then shot the other with the shotgun until is was almost dead and finished it with the syringer. Cleared those two challenges quick.
---
the weapon degradation on my handmade rifle with a powerful automatic receiver is the thing I find stops me from feeling over-powerful. I have to plan my traveling meticulously to make sure I know where the nearest weapons workbench is and I've had to get used to mel√©e killing whenever possible to save using my rifle. 
---
it's made the game much more tactical and demanding. even at level 164, I'm suddenly having to start running away from some enemies after being used to just standing my ground and blasting them before!
---
no problem
---
LOL

Tip: Save up the insects parts when doing the campfire tales event. You can give them to the robot at Dolly Sods once a day for a chance to get more possum badges! These are: bloodbug proboscis, bloatfly gland, tick bloodsack, stingwing barb and radroach meat.
---
Only item with CND is the radroach meat, but you can kill one of those real quick at any bunkers in the Mire.
---
Oh and remember to drop by the kiddie's corner daily for the cleanup event. Also has a chance of giving possum badges!
---
I‚Äôm Level 278 with near 700 hours in, and to answer your question: No. 
---
:)
---
I agree 80%.  Then you have the ***** who make you spawn into a death trap for your stuff.
---
Does it spoil? Because it would be nice to farm and sell.
---
Same here, the bodies were full of Quills aswell. As soon as he saw me though he walked off and hid behind an upturned vehicle, thought for sure that a squatch would jump me if i killed him, never did though :\\ poor guy.
---
Im lvl 106 and have never had any good explosive legendary guns and have always felt very underpowered. I still hate coming across scorch beasts because they never seem to land and Ive mainly been running a terrible melee build
---
I just ignore the 'noise' from 'game journalists' anymore. Just trying to create conflict for click bait.  
---
Personally I love the new player vending, finding great deals, seeing the awesome camps others have built, making the world more alive.
---
I got 800 excess adhesive if you‚Äôre on ps4. 
---
Stop by!

Cant find any RazonGrain point on "rare grass" map. Help me please
---
vampire gatling is great to finish bosses. +50% vats is useless stat. If you need damage, pick executioner, if you need healing - vampire
---
just two more :)
---
you want any caps or something?
---
ok fine. no I don't want anything
---
Is it a skin or different backpack all together?
---
How hard is it too off yourself?
---
Pogchamp
---
1 brahmin milk each
---
Syrup needs sugar and glowing resin
---
Razorgrain flour needs like, 8 razorgrain each
---
same can't do the quest
---
I wish they would stop because I want to wear my cool outfits not the stupid ones the challenge wants. üòë
---
All of em done?
---
Not sure if you found your answer by now, but incase you havn't or anyone else stumbles on this...
---
You need the ProSnap Camera and you take the photos with that, not photo mode. A quick search will show you all you need to know about getting one.
---
You know, an even more entertaining solution (for player vending at least) would be a catapult or spring floor trap.  Linger more than 60 seconds with no activity, you get launched into the air.
---
Think of traps you may have seen in Loony Toons.
---
Of course, Bethesda would have to put these in the game, but a guy can dream.
---
Amazing thanks so much feels so good to have them all out the way :)
---
Happy to help. Have fun!
---
Yes all done thanks
---
Wow, a Polygon article that's actually well-written and good. Quite an entertaining read.
---
You do it, report back with a link to it please.  I can't risk what precious little karma i have...
---
Or launch a nuke.
---
I got the badge using a battered fedora, placing bone traps and disarming them in my camp.
---
I believe you already can. Is the spawn point not decided by the position of the C.A.M.P module and which direction it is facing?
---
White Wolf Fedora worked for me. Collected bones off super mutants in West Tek.
---
I can confirm everyting. I got all paint plans which take around 20 TD per plan. After i got elder i bought the underarmor plans learned them and after another maybe 20 TD i got the shielded underarmor plan. Also got a huge amount of outfits (but sometimes i got only ammo and aid for maybe 3-4 times in a row).
---
I like seeing other people's camps. Just wish they didn't lock their doors
---
My perks and armor buff this area. For me, it high end energy weapons that rip me to shreds. The sheepsquatch event is murderous.
---
Look into cards like White Knight and fix it good. Later in the game it isn't about having more adhesive but using less of it via perks.
---
What a great idea, I never thought of that, thanks for the help
---
I was collecting bones from supermutants in Summersville, there's a lot of them and low level. I was using the Silver Shroud fedora. Good luck !
---
Time to dig that one out of the stash and give it a spin, so relieved this is not an impossible to complete thing, many thanks
---
I gotta say I feel a little awkward going into peoples homes... especially if they have the vending machine outside away from their main living area. üò¨ Note to people who want other players to see your CAMP: unlock your doors and place your vending machine inside!
---
damn, I want a full video of this. as an in-game photographer, I will kill for this view
---
Xbox?
---
Glad to help. Happy hunting! ‚ô°
---
I love building. It‚Äôs probably my favorite part of the game (next to eating corpses and the bloody mess perk). I‚Äôd love to help you build if you‚Äôre on PS4!
---
I‚Äôve got the silver shroud one and white wolf one in my stash so il grab them both and head to Summersville or west tek, thanks for the reply much appreciated
---
There is, but it's far from complete, it seems to be based on player observation. My maps are drawn direct from the game files so they capture every point with complete precision
---
Yeah, fuck kipper
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs permanent. The problem is a mixture of bad luck and a bunch of new random encounters muddying the waters.
---
This is correct! Place your camp tool where you want you and others to spawn
---
And then we all became wendigo. You win some, you lose some.
---
Dunno what to tell ya.  Just bad luck.  I saw a tourist earlier tonight in front of the mothman statue and then another later on at the top of the lighthouse.
---
I currently have fo76 on Xbox one x, is it better on PC?
---
Iong story short. My PC died a while ago so I bought an Xbox to tie me over until I could replace my PC. I have rebuilt my PC now and I am wondering if it's worth jumping back to PC 
---
If it helps, I play on a 32" fun tv, but my PC has a 27" gsync 144hz display.
---
Thoughts?
---
What's the purpose? To keep killing same enemies over and over, on same places over and over?
---
Moat duped items disappear when dropped. So no worries on that legendary.
---
Don't even quote gargabe games like these, dude.
---
That OB_RE is interesting, won't be able to do it yet but I'll see what happens if I feed it into Mappalachia
---
Thx!! Found him

Use the 'search' function Dip shit. Oh no not this again etc etc - yadda yadda yadda.

In before all the moody fuckers down vote you and berate you for asking this question which has been asked time and time again by other users too lazy to search etc etc.............. Anyway here are some links that'll hopefully help you find what you seek my amigo and good luck hunting :)

I haven't played since last Christmas, mostly because my wife, her brother and a friend of us were never able to see all the other three. At least one of us was invisible to someone else at any time. If you want to play coop this is more than annoying.
---
Is it fixed?
---
Legendary farming at the standard places. To be honest I'm getting bored too. Joining the scouts doesn't fulfill my wasteland fantasy and running laps in West Tek is getting old. I had high hopes for pvp but it's broken even when its working.
---
The one playing drums while stoned at the power plant outside watoga is my favorite.
---
Indeed and with the server always crashing I had to start over a couple of times because server crashed before I got back to my last death location to pick up my brown bag.
---
Thanks for the help - I'm good at getting the maps working but I struggle the closer we get with xEdit, so this is helpful
---
The tower at the pioneer scouts camp is perfect for jumping off of.
---
After killing the big evil mutant the vault guy went to his camp and went to bed without checking his defenses. He was killed brutally by another vault dude, but with a bathrobe holding a machete. The End!
---
Should've shot him
---
Just drop a frag grenade at your feet with low health.
---
place a punji board under them using the rug trick, they'll die a slow painful and disease ridden death :)
---
Aluminum ore is mapped - junk items containing it I'm afraid will have to be a "phase 2" release of the tool. PA is a good call - I'll see if that can be done
---
Holy shit ur a god lmao
---
Indeed. Not only that. It seems that YOUR spawn point is the same but a distance from the device.
---
If you plan your build right, and get lucky with legendary drops... yes actually. 
---
Pick a weapon class within your first 10 levels and stick to it. Damage increasing cards first, crafting second, weight, then utility last. No matter what ranged class you go with, melee can still be viable with enough strength increasing armors and chems. Melee kind of just gets in the way at any boss fight or nuke zone, unpopular opinion.
---
Once you reach level 50, you should have no problem dropping things pretty quickly, save for big bosses. SB's on your level go down pretty quick. Its 70% your build, 30% the legendaries you find. 
---
Its fine to go "well I wanna be good at everything". Thats great, but just start that after level 50. Level 103, and I've branched out from rifleman to commando and explosives, and am considering pistols. A lot of classes can compliment and augment each other. I go 15 AGI/PER, and that opens up sneak, rifles, automatics, and pistols. If you went 15 Strength/END, you could have some pretty sweet heavy weapons, melee, and shotgun cards. 
---
Early on, if I were going for strength, I'd either go shotgun perks or melee perks, for example. That way ammo is easier. Then down the line once I've got the ammo perks, go for heavy guns.
---
And don't count VATS out. Even for melee. Concentrated fire 3 makes VATS pretty OP on anything automatic. Combined with the auto target switch perk and... you're pretty deadly against mobs. No vats cards = bad time with Vats.
---
Razorgrain appears on the uncommon flora map. However it suffers from being among too many other colors. If you look at the ingredients map for Nukashine - that will highlight razorgrain clearly
---
Lvl 276, 147, 140 and 135 here.
---
Kinda. Depends on the build and the gear you can get hold of.
---
But you can make your own challenges if that is the case - such is the beauty of a sandbox.
---
Feels good to have a choice though and deliberately gimp oneself to see how far in scenario 'x' you can get without relying on 'y and z'... or not and try to see how OP you can make yourself and how fast you can clear scenario 'x'.
---
Of course this varies from person to person. 'Gimp everything so no choice remains' is a very popular opinion in this sub.
---
When I played WoW many moons ago, we had a guild by that name on our server.
---
they should really just delete the extras at this point.
---
He's gonna need a Stimpak for that one...
---
Further proof why fallout 76 is objectively bad
---
I'm sorry adding the mod actually lowers your over all resistance?
---
If so that seems silly being bigger it can store more and have more things between you and bullets
---
Whenever I fast travel to my CAMP I spawn in the mountain and have to fast travel again to get to it. When my buds come to my CAMP they spawn in the building and then float up through the floor - very weird lol ;)
---
No, especially in Survival mode. Other players will put you in your place and make you realize that you ain't shit.
---
I learned this the hard way.
---
Thanks a lot for Nukashine hint!
---
Same backpack, same shape and design, darker shade of brown
---
Don't let yourself feel sympathy, OP. When the endgame is genocide, you can't afford it.
---
The way i did it with my 3 toons was by picking up half broken crossbow from archery range in "Palace of the Winding Path", repair it without the perk that gives it 200% durability! (1st repair). then go to "Charleston Capital Building" and kill low level ghouls inside (they come running at you from all over if you make little noise, about 26-28 of them). After clear you can repair again (2nd repair). Realmhop and clear Capital Building again (until you get the 50 kills for challenge), and go repair (3rd repair).
---
It costs like 5 bucks (waa free at one point) but yeah. Weather system, No fast travel, hunger and thirst, advanced desease system, lower carry capacity
---
I'm walking around but can't find the right spot tried taking 1 from the sign on the wall but no luck, tried from the tracks on the cart, no luck either.
---
Any suggestions? Would be greatly appreciated thanks.
---
Who cheats on a videogame, which is only an hobby,will cheat on real life too. A lifetime ban would be well deserved for any of these cunts.
---
It‚Äôs an error with the specific wording, that causes it not to register, since CAMPS don‚Äôt count as a workbench the ‚ÄúCraft a frog habitat at a CAMP‚Äù doesn‚Äôt realise that you have to build/construct it in CAMP mode to count
---
It says black powder...it was the same with some pistol skin i read.
---
Partysnax is the fan name for Parthurnaax, the good guy dragon from Skyrim. He used to eat people, then had a heel-face turn when he realized that Alduin was batshit.
---
The game still have not received a BIG and PROPER expansion. So IMO, who already invested tons of time, have no purpose to get back to play. For any new players, surely F76 worth the price. I just completed the whole game, took a month.
---
Not sure how applicable some of the tips would be without knowing whether the mobs that the event spawns are a problem for you or not, so here go a couple of 'generic' things you may have missed.
---
\- Ignore wet kindling specially if you cannot keep the creepy crawlies it spawns fast enough.
---
\- Kindling is not removed from your inventory after the event and has no weight(\*). Pick up as much as you can. Make the most of events when other people turn up for something other than reaping the benefits in the last minute.
---
(\*) this is probably an oversight seen how the bioluminescent fluid behaves in the Path to Elightenment event: it weighs a ton and spoils faster than you can say 'Mothman Monthman where are you?' so is my educated guess that it will be patched soo to either make kindling weight more than the sins of your youth or script it so it gets removed after the event ends. Make the most of it while it lasts.
---
It may have said black powder but my drunk mindbrain on a Friday night said buy this for your dragon and that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at. üòØüòØüòØ
---
So is it a skin for the backpack?
---
So does that mean -55 Radiation Resist on my total resistances? (+5 for shielded lining)
---
Its fucked but i think its only for black powder
---
The pool with hole in the bottom or the kiddie pool with the spaceship in it?
---
Yeah I was mad about it at first but I‚Äôm uber drunk and feel really good and me and my wife have literally had our own server for the last two hours. No workshop challenges üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÉ and I‚Äôm super drunk plus the level action rifle looks really good!
---
I had this happen recently with my power armor stations. Try to go place it on the ground and not in a foundation, if this doesn‚Äôt work exit workshop mode and try to place it on terrain again till you find a spot it accepts then move the vendor to where you wanna have it.
---
I never excused anyone. Sure if u are ruining other players experience you are a dick. But my point was that if a game is that easy to exploit, you were sold a faulty product by someone who knew that the game was exploitable and understood how this negatively affected your gameplay experience, yet still sold it to you. In the big picture they are the real villains.
---
It‚Äôs practical. Sure it looks ugly as hell, but from a gameplay perspective most enemies are melee, and the less building you have on the ground the less gets damaged by them. I hate it, but I get it.
---
Not everyone, some of us have played the series without exploiting anything at all. All using exploits does is take the fun out of your game. I'd be willing to bet that the vast majority of players don't use any exploits at all.
---
-Guy who's played Fallout games for &gt;20 years and never used exploits
---
Melee enemies can‚Äôt destroy the walls and if the door is locked they can‚Äôt get inside either
---
Im level 283 with 326 hours in this game and i really must say, theres always something thay can improve your build. I never used chems until around a month ago, now i hold no less than 300 psychobuff.
---
LOL üòÇüòÇ thats the spirit
---
I have a bar with a stage... I hope one day every instrument will be in use at the same time
---
The standard pack at lv 50 gives resistances. If you add the mod that increases the carry weigh from 60 to 120 then you loose those resistances that the standard pack grants you. This is the down side.
---
You can't trade them apparently.
---
And you don't even need to shoot your crossbow, bashing works just fine for the challenge(s).
---
Damn that sounded like easy caps
---
Level 41.    
---
    
---
:P    
---
   
---
Yeah. Would be nice. I've got a few.
---
I'll take this post down when I get the answer
---
Bethesda feedback probably.
---
Straight to bethesda
---
Just move your C.A.M.P. device around within your camp until it gives you a nicer spawn point.

You that‚Äôs kinda a thing about this game. A lot of hate. And yeah... there‚Äôs a lot of bugs and problems but this game provides an escape for me and the wife after a hard days work. We like to come home and immerse ourselves and work together to survive. We meet a friend here and there but it‚Äôs about the journey. I think that‚Äôs what all the haters are missing. We did Cod and all that but the friendships you build in this game are second to none. Lol I‚Äôm Rambling now and you didn‚Äôt ask for this but that‚Äôs my thoughts my dude. Great fucking experience!!!
---
Thanks! Yeah the bugs aren‚Äôt a problem at all, but when Solo just basically the constant scramble for kindling while killing the stuff around you my time always seems to run out, headache!
---
I really don't wanna buy any weapons from the trade communitys right now because I'm doing it for my dad and if he were to be banned then i don't know what he would do...
---
I‚Äôve had some serious frame rate drops, nearly freezing up when collecting items the same as you described, but thankfully not lost any items. Sorry to hear that happened to you.
---
I am also looking for someone to do this with. My GT is MJCampillo. If you ever see me online playing FO76, feel free to message me.
---
Hell yes. I craft so much shit every time I play. Love fighting stuff and seeing I've still got ammo crafting perks on or my gun breaks because I took off gunsmith.
---
If  Bethesda actually tested each patch we wouldn't be in this situation. All they need to do is try every dupe method that's known before releasing it and they dont even do that because they know people will do it for them
---
I was about to answer the same. I'm level 260 and a legendary mirelurk queen just melts my health bar away in seconds, doesn't matter if I'm up close for melee, or ranged.
---
I hardly ever go down in Whitesprings anymore, though, not even in a nuke zone, so there's that.
---
Best temporary fix is to jump on Survival. It's what I had to do when the laying lowe questline went live and a guy was parked on the terminal for over 10 minutes, saying he's reading it aloud for his YouTube channel.
---
Do you think you could hook to me up to a resource just so I can understand what this would involve? No promises but I want to assess options for a "version 2"
---
Appreciated - I'm still assessing options for a version 2 yet
---
You got my vote!
---
I don't bother killing the stuff untill I have a swarm of them around me.

I basically 'train' them from kindling spot 'a' to 'b' to 'c' until I have a 'swarm' around me then I turn around and wipe the floor with them.
---
It is hindered by the fact that they have 'done a fuckup' with melee VATS and flying nuisances (I do miss gun-fu in this even, I wonder if the 'fuckup' was accidental on purpose) but is still better than chasing after them.
---
Yes its a skin. Same thing as the power armor colors
---
Awesome!
---
Also its redeployable. Prior to this patch placing a blueprint with more than a couple of foundations would be a crapshoot.
---
thanks
---
With the deep pocketed mod i believe all pieces add 10 carry weight each
---
I nearly spat my drink all over my keyboard after that hound attacked XD. This is great.
---
Tesla rifle. Keep going for wood is priority. Then you are good to go.
---
The game has been out almost a year, its bethesdas fault at this point
---
It wont be patched. You can farm mainframe cores for nuke silos since beta. It weight zero and i have 40 now.
---
I'm not utterly convinced the people behind the camera fully understand how real cameras work. That 105mm lens should not provide the same magnification as the default 50mm lens, nor should it have a zoom function - it's a macro lens. Plus, it goes way beyond 300mm.
---
I just want a vault tec skin
---
5
---
I admire your optimism but I don't take anything for granted, specially if it detracts from the grind.
---
I usualy see it as 'they haven't gotten around to patching it yet'.
---
Was it to do with the three trade points in the enclave? I see we are down to one trade point again!
---
I lost my bloodied gatling gun, I've lost several pieces of armor. Yesterday I was playing with my buddy and he suddenly asks me "Where's your helmet, man?" What do you mean, I'm wearing it... "No you're not." I lost just the helmet to my PA set... When I ended up looking through my inventory I was missing several pieces of armor. I only had one arm piece, one leg piece and my chest piece on. My chest piece on another toon was missing. I've lost so many nearly irreplaceable things. I mean if I was willing to spend ridiculous time and effort trading I might get some of it back, but I play with totally self found loot so I'm basically extra fucked.
---
They cannot be dropped, both crafted or broken. If you are willing to trade i am online now.

There's a fountain that cures all diseases?!
---
Someone actually just did this to me. I was hopping down a mountain when i heard the sound of someone landing in power armor and then they ran up and told me their opinions on my camp design and vendor item selection
---
i don‚Äôt think they can be traded either, i‚Äôll still hop on and give it a go though, i‚Äôm a desperate man lol
---
It was the new vending machines. They were putting items in and using disconnects to dupe them essentially. It's fixed now but doesn't sound like they banned anyone so yay for justice.
---
It's 5 but you need to have 5 as a base value not 5 inclusive of bonus armor or mutation boosts
---
How does duping cause inflation? Shouldn't it cause deflation?
---
I've been on the exact other end of this bug, no loot, no caps.
---
Thanks a lot for sharing that info - will let you know if anything comes of it
---
only one in the game. go into the gazebo. rotunda? whatever the domey thing is by the tennis court. look around the wall, and you'll find a fountain. 
---
I'd been in there dozens of times and never noticed it, and someone pointed it out to me on a runthrough.
---
As the battles are won by other vault dwellers, a lone vault dweller sits at her camp, playing on an old guitar she found in Appalachia, strumming an old song an watch and listen to halo tapes of those who left the world behind.

I‚Äôm also in need of this.

---
Fell free to add me. 
---
If you ever see me online playing FO76, send me a message, and we‚Äôll sort something out.
---
Oh, I didn't know it cured diseases.  I'll have to remember that next time ghouls have given me 3+ diseases instead of just running around.
---
Anyone who thinks this game is good has severe cognitive bias limiting them from seeing reality. Play rust, its if fallout 76 was not total shit
---
It is like people from Bethesda didn‚Äôt expect us to reach lvl 50 so fast.
---
They are a regular random encounter. I run into them constantly now lol.
---
A little over 6 months isn't a year , but I agree with the rest of your post.
---
Well at least we confirmed, the camera can't be traded or dropped. Regardless if it's broken or repaired. Now I have 10 broken and 3 repaired.
---
Nope we all live it
---
I've picked up 6 broken ones in two days and added them to my vendor for 0 caps in case anyone is stuck
---
A lot of the quests are glitched this might be one of them
---
You are undercutting us reasonable purveyors of rare vault 76 outfits! My rate is 25000
---
That's not even a good comparison because it's all digital stuff. Some guy duping isn't taking the item away from a finite store of items. It's more like someone counterfeiting money and the FBI doing nothing about it. It's Bethesda's system that they released, it's on them to fix it.
---
They dupe rarest items like legacy TSE energy weapons or fasnacht rare masks, which reduce their prices
---
I guess you are right, don't know about economy much
---
Oh shit it‚Äôs my cake day :D
---
Nah Skippy is the lvl1 1* wood armor guy. You're after Buddy. Buddy is the drill guy.
---
Fixed it. Yeah man people need to realize at some point 76 was a cash grab scam by the b team and just drop the game, the devs don't give a heck
---
Leathercoat without backpack , gas mask &amp; clean skiing hat. Not needing anything else
---
Are you kidding me? people are all over the Bethesda ‚Äúplagiarized‚Äù bull shit story saying how horrible Bethesda is how we should hate them
---
Even more when it was likely some lazy writer who likely be fired any negative news about Bethesda no matter how small it catches wildfire with every youtuber cause Bethesda hate makes money and clicks they don‚Äôt care how many updates are good or whatever Bethesda does that‚Äôs good they will never make a video about that only negative and controversial news they will make about the game.
---
Costumes are now 300-600 caps instead 1000+.
---
Serums are 500-2000 instead of 200.
---
Weapons are cheaper.
---
Plans are cheaper too.
---
Yes, but you need something like lv500 or something (forgotten the exact level)
---
Would hardly be worth points imo.  Maybe semi useful against mobs but
---
Great tone to the writing. In my head it was being read by the fallout 2 narrator, so you nailed it.
---
Excellent work!
---
I always thought it depended on where you first place you C.A.M.P device??? I'll give your suggestion a try - cheers amigo :)
---
I needed some concrete and aluminum to finish building my base so I spawned it in.
---
- Guy who will stand on top of rocks because it's out of reach of enemies.
---
That sounds like it wouldn't be any challenge or fun at all.
---
I really thought this was a fake except from an article at first üòÇ
---
I think my new plan is to do Tea Time first, then round up any missing items, rather than jump around looking for everything.
---
Think using the Missingno glitch to dupe Rare Candies at Cinnabar Island. ‚òùÔ∏è That's duping.
---
Most of us weren‚Äôt unbanned. This is just those who virtue signal on Reddit how bad duping is and then go and dupe themselves when they have an opening.
---
What‚Äôs sad is the first way of dupers understood how it worked and now it seems no one else understands *why* you can dupe in fallout 76 and what would stop it or make it too tedious to *want* to do
---
Making a detailed reddit post.
---
Ron Pearlman.  I was gonna post the same, but you got it out there first ;)
---
I think we aren‚Äôt supposed to do these just yet. Like the Medic badge requiring us to use Stimpack Diffuser.
---
Get a shotgun. Any shotgun. Even the one the scorched you just killed - and was wielding a fucking lead pipe - has dropped. Then equip 'Enforcer' in the AGI 'tree'.
---
You don't need to do significant damage - if you don't want to invest in the relevant perks because shotties aren't your 'thing' even thoguh the SPECIAL distribution is pretty much 'interchangeable' between melee and shotgunner - just aim in the beast's direction. With lvl3 a handful of shells should suffice to stop the thing from flying around and shouting at you and make it land.
---
Is so convenient I am surprised they haven't nerfed it yet.
---
I just imagine the kid knocks the guy out with their canteen and hides nearby for backup then sneaks inside.
---
 Can‚Äôt drop them either
---
I do have a shotgun, a two shot legendary, i just find it to be quite garbage
---
How about the wedding ring? I still haven't picked it up yet..
---
Hahaha, genius!
---
That's why I did it.  With more budget, relaxing of building ground foundation placement (which I have to test out), it may be time to revert to a more traditional/realistic looking structure.
---
make wave 1 last as long as possible, the fire burns the slowest and lets you pick up as much kindling as possible
---
use a tesla, should 1 shot all the bugs except scorpions, and it arcs so you can chain enemys, or miss and still get some hits in
---
U can name Power Armor
---
2 dirty Sugar Bombs I know of, In Whitesprings inside the Firemans building in the back office is one
---
Another is inside the laundry room in the employee lounge.
---
Meh, I just used a 10mm smg to almost kill it then put two shots in its head with the syringer for the win.
---
Just posted the same thing. Also sent you a friend request.
---
It depends. If you say something bad about the game, people from here will downvote you and tell you you are wrong.
---
But if you say something good about the game, the angry and frustrated guys over at r/fallout will downvote you and tell you you are wrong.
---
So don't ask. Don't say anything. Just *exist*.
---
What is your ingame name
---
I randomly lost a decontamination shower when I stored two of them
---
Geneziz
---
Thanks for the tips everyone!
---
I'm surprised you didn't point out that it technically should be Narsil, since the combat knife hasn't been reforged yet.
---
Lighten up, Francis.
---
Tech data spawns in containers right? Is it only certain types? Cause I can map containers I just don't know which types to map.
---
In terms of getting 2 extractors in your camp.... Hmm
---
That's another step above the mapping it's built for - also I don't have the figures of the camp radius. Your best bet would be to just eyeball I'm afraid. I know there is that acid/lead in the south savage divide, and there is (i think) junk/lead in the toxic valley
---
Try using skeet shooter with it if you haven‚Äôt yet. It makes a big difference with spread. Without it, a good chunk of pellets tend to miss at any range other than very close.
---
I haven't done that particular challenge yet, but my thought was to hit it a few hundred times with my Executioner's Gatling Plasma, and then get in the last few bashes with my syringer.
---
With proper legendaries and perk cards it is easy to carry a shit load. I have 2 legendaries with -20% junk weight, lvl3 pack rat for -75% junk weight. -20% weapons weight and -20% ammo weight.
---
Shotguns used to be amazing.
---
Then the PvP crowd decided that they were too amazing.
---
This by itself is not a problem however the devs' ears perk up every time they see a PvP related complain/grievance so they scrambled to do something about it.
---
Fast forward to now and except some very specific shotguns with very specific builds and gear they are just 'beige'/bland/meh.
---
Said that for the purpose of making SBs land any shottie will do. The key here is crippling them with Enforcer.
---
Haha, no, they'll add nothing or fix nothing thats broken... Only stop the dupe glitch they made
---
Loweres ER and RR but not DR I think
---
Frog habitat still a no go, and no diffuser.
---
DCs heaps more me too... Lag and Invisible bosses that get killed before they load in... That's my experience the last few days
---
1.) I didn't. I stereotyped a political demographic which your 2.) luminally illustrates.
---
2.) See 1.)
---
No, doesn‚Äôt spoil
---
Yeah, you can get every perk. It's shuffling around your special that would hurt. I'm working on a weapons master build and it's a pain to get the specials for it
---
Oh true
---
This and jumping while connecting wires in camp mode. Also sitting animation takes forever and sometimes you can die because of it by accidentally sitting while trying to loot a corpse. I understand that console players can only use few buttons but they can fix these issues on PC at least.
---
Happy cakeday my guy
---
I've got a video of that he's just walking around crying about his brothers and his father all gone.
---
Thanks mate, it really helped a lot.
---
Yup, that works too. You only need to get the kill shot (or bash) in with the weapon of choice.
---
Thank you :D
---
I noticed my patrolman sunglasses are missing. Anyone else having certain items missing?
---
Fuckin‚Äô A right.
---
Well, back to Battleaxe/Super Sledge time.
---
Long time EATT member hear, come join us for dinner!
---
How is obsidian in the dumpster?
---
I don‚Äôt give a shit about downvotes.... and me and the wife enjoyed playing fallout 4 together tv screen by tv screen but to be able to play together... that‚Äôs something special and we enjoy ourselves. 
---
I don‚Äôt care what people say from another subreddit. This is a good game. Yes it has its problems but it‚Äôs getting better. And I feel like most of those haters haven‚Äôt experienced this game it was meant to be experienced. Just saying
---
Hey there, I think a version of this bug is back but involving backpack mods and/or player vending station My friend passed me a backpack mods, and i passed him some stuff from my player vending through the stash box, and that character turned afterward unplayable.
---
Is it max level? If so it will be fine.
---
Where did you find the note ? Or was it data mined
---
No not worth. The only worthy mods seem armor and fridge,only if you have no weight problems.
---
I'll go armor as soon as i get my weight down from selling my stuff.
---
Did not work
---
Melees are not so good in silo, because there is too much turrets hanging on celing. But if you hack them before entering every rooms, you should be 100% alright!
---
No thanks for me üëç
---
Some robots in Whitesprings do this too. And they do it since release. One would think 6 months is enough to fix something like that.
---
OMG I crafted a crossbow and it had 150% durability, SO IRRITATING.
---
Ok... But I don't have the right perk to hack. Maybe one of my teammates does have it . ..thx for the advice
---
Yep level 50.
---
The blades pop out laterally to the missile, and there are six of them. It's like dropping an anvil with a sword on someone. Look up Abu Khayr al-Masri if you want to see what they do to a car.
---
125 mph winds can put a 2x4 through a concrete wall. The Hellfire is going 8 times faster, and we all know how physics works. It's like they put Wolverine in a cannon and shoot him at you.
---
I need to do the same thing GT:pehetez
---
I passed it before the surprising maintenance yesterday.
---
It is still doable, but ranged is better there.
---
Mm yeah its gonna need some work to be viable...
---
Was it on the possum terminal in the main camp?
---
I honestly wouldn't think so as they're quest rewards from handing tech data in.  
---
Best place to check is Vendor Phoenix in Watoga, or the BoS Rep at Whitesprings Resort.
---
What you mean by " ranged"?
---
So we're the combat armor plans but you can get them for 95 caps at grafton now lol
---
 You get them as random rewards for turning in Technical Data
---
Perfect! I'm joining
---
I know but the BOS combat armor plans are now at grafton for 95 caps.
---
I'm not a low level player by any means, but I feel that almost no daily atoms can be completed by anyone under lvl30. I'm sure it frustrates newbies, since almost all of the challenges are madness, like "take a picture of two mirelurk queens fighting a sbq under a tunnel at noon while wearing a travelling leather coat and white asylum hat"
---
I'm so hype on it right now xD
---
Bethesda‚Äôs still too salty about ‚ÄúThe Outer World‚Äôs‚Äù diss at the Game Awards.
---
Bethesda screwed adventure modes out of participating in the first or two double xp events. They owe us this
---
Yeah, passive carfting perks should be dependable on ‚Äúwhen You got them‚Äù and of course have enough Specials to use them rather then ‚Äúwhile You equiped them‚Äù.
---
There is literally no difference if you have those perks and use them anyway while swapping appart from pain of swapping them constantly.
---
Secound passive loadout should be available.
---
Somebody went through this thread and downvoted everyone including you lol, must be a dupe lover. Have an upvote.
---
That's what I was thinking.... My mule didnt eat or drink anything for 4 months..... Never died
---
Never existed for the western, only the .44 revolver
---
It needs to be alive, and it doesnt have to be a normal creature it can be a diseased/scorched etc. As long as it says the name of it in the corner when you take the pic it should register but lets be honest here theres probably a bug
---
Same here
---
Yes, but like I said. The Paints are rewards from handing in Tech Data. So doubtful that you could buy them from a vendor, as that would be pointless having them as a reward as well.
---
Indeed new camera is great. 
---
Little tip to get it, server hoping really works. Took me around 10 times by miners monument but ive got the tourist and a camera.
---
The Bethesda plagiarized outrage stuff is not helping either they are demonizeing Bethesda hard iv seen multiple videos about it and there trashing Bethesda‚Äôs but it‚Äôs form typical hate channels
---
That was a hoot and a half!
---
&gt; it's like everybody but me has TSE autos
---
they are legit the worst legendary for PVP two shot is pure meme and explosive is hard countered by fire proof + dense mod 
---
&gt;(and/or mutations or something that causes me to inflict no damage).
---
thats sentinel assassin armor ,it is busted AF in pvp
---
I understand, but so we're the combat armor paints until 2 days ago. Hence why they were about 10k each to buy.... Now there 95 caps in game.
---
Was just wondering if they'd done the same with the power armor paint and I just couldn't find it. Before I pay way too much for a point on here off someone.
---
I hate these monstrosities so much. It ruins the little immersion I have left.
---
Why that is nice of you to ask.
---
I'm feeling a bit under the weather and sorry for myself; I think I might have caught one of those nasty 'spring colds'.
---
Otherwise in good spirits. Just finished work and ready to make myself some honey tea, see if I can perk up enough to enjoy the weekend :)
---
Yes! I've just posted about this as well.  Would be cool to be able to pin notes on walls or, for example, on vending machines.  Obviously would need a cap on how many notes you can create but it should surely be easy to implement. What about being able to add a short blurb for our camp to show up on the map too? Twitter bio kinda length. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bnaz1i/we_should_be_able_to_name_our_public_camps/
---
This is why I've started hoarding armor w poison protection
---
Nah I doubt they have mate.  
---
Curious question which paint are buying?
---
You can milk a brahmin at your camp also. Place the straw and wheel barrow that spawns one. Milk it then store it, place it back and repeat
---
Go down near Charlston in the river lure the mirelurks over to kill you as they only Lvl 5 get teammate to finish them off then pop over and revive you.
---
Not sure tbh, keep seeing a few listed every now and then. I want them all really, but they tend to go for 2-3k so would be gutted if I paid that much and then found them for 100 caps somewhere in game lol
---
It's a great experience for me . 
---
You sell  stuff you thought nobody would pay a cap for and on the other hand you're stuck with stuff you thought that would sell great.... Costumes ,stimpacks,plans sell good. . 
---
It's like a flea market.... You get nice gear for a reasonable price . I'm not looking to become a 'cap'italist . It's more fun ,you can change your gear more frequently. And you get to see some great camp builds and meet nice people as well....
---
It should of been like that from the beginning.... Anything priced above 10K is ridiculous in my opinion .
---
Yeah got the name wrong my bad, thanks.
---
Similar thing happened to me soon after release. I haven‚Äôt traded with anyone ever since.
---
One if the vendors in whitesprings has the plans
---
I honestly have no idea why people have been nuking like this so much recently. I skew mine centered on the left side of V9. For the longest time I saw it like I do it or centered on Prime.
---
Then like a few weeks ago people started doing it like in your screenshot all of a sudden. I don't understand the draw. Is it cause people like to fight at V9 more? Idk. Either way, when I attend Queens with this pattern I spam the BOS distress beacon to try and annoy people into not using that pattern anymore.
---
In online now
---
Perfect post right at the top. Was just going to post one myself looking for someone to knock out both these items.  
---
Invite incoming from Robfox5
---
This situation is the most common issue I've seen.  But I suppose it's not unheard of either way.  However leaving out Forward Station Delta still allows bloodied builds to fight the queen.  So, in my mind at least, the black ring suggestion is more optimal and allows you to nuke more player area.
---
My bloodied pals all either prefer the "proper" pattern or are neutral.
---
Just remember that it was a c-section that rendered someone ‚Äúnot of woman born‚Äù. Lots of people ‚Äúnot of woman born‚Äù these days.
---
I sell ballistic, 5.56 and almost everything else you'd want (no flux atm). My camp is near the Whitesprings train station.
---
On PC add DaddyDummy and go shopping!
---
Yeah, if your Xbox I could help
---
Well a brief estimate of how much I've seen 'em go for is:  
---
* Initiate: 100 - 500 caps. "Possibly higher sometimes"
---
* Knight: 1,000 - 2,000 caps.
---
* Knight SGT: 2,000 - 3,000 caps.
---
* Officer: 3,000 - 4,500 caps.
---
* Paladin: 10,000 - 25,000 caps. "Possibly higher due to rarity"
---
* Elder: 20,000 - 25,000 caps. "Possibly higher due to rarity"  
---
Hopefully that gives you a rough idea on some of the prices, You never know. You may find someone willing to sell cheaply.. Or these prices may be well out of balance these days.. due to such high fluctuation in the player market. I honestly don't know.
---
Welp I'll be swinging on by next time I see you on!
---
Only repaired ones. You can trade the broken ones and then those people can repair it themselves.
---
Do you have a 'white'spring cold ü§£ take care ....
---
Most agreed my dude, the game has much room for improvement.
---
Put some lemon in that tea. That will help a lot. I‚Äôm sorry your not feeling well ü§Æü§Æü§Æ if you have a sore throat, consider gargling some salt and hot water in your throat every hours or so. That should also help a lot. Lots of sleep and water is the cure to the common cold üòÉüòÉüòÉ
---
Duping is using exploits to duplicate items.  You can crank out 17k ammo because ammo drops are typically &gt;1.  How do you get 97k stimpacks though?
---
Thx but  I'M on  PS4
---
I gave up, after almost month playing I made it just to level 22, always encumbered even inventory was lite packed, my weapons does minimal damage to medium opponents, can't fast travel, also can't spend half time running arround looking for suplies and workbench only .. not fun at all .. it reminded me of another game - State of Decay .. hard to survive, maximum effort - minimal fun .. overall I enjoyed Fallout games, but this one is not for me, obviously
---
The future wendigos!
---
I'm sure you can trade it, I've done it.
---
It was before the latest patch mind, so dunno if they changed it.
---
Thank you, I've screenshot that so I have an idea in future. Thanks
---
I mean if they didn't expect you to get up there then why does the roof have collision *X-files theme intensifies*
---
If you use a terminal someone else is already using it should open up in the pip boy for you to use as normal, dont know if this applied to that terminal in the uranium fever mine but it does with others
---
Saw the same thing for a split second yesterday taking a workshop with a rando
---
(X) Doubt
---
The BOS combat armor paint was available at the vendor months ago until Beth introduced a bug which removed it, the fix took weeks/months. Doesn‚Äôt look like the Nuka PA paints aren‚Äôt for sale and the BOS PA paints aren‚Äôt either.
---
FYI: There‚Äôs another exam terminal at the camp that the campfire tales quest takes place at.
---
I've tried that, it never effected my fast travel spawns, it was always in a different random location!
---
I'm definitely getting repair kit drops in addition to plans.  I think they just added them as a reward for the event.
---
Pretty sure you can't with Broken either. I just tried to drop one and it said it will be destroyed.
---
Yes you can get every perk but you could not equip every perk obviously
---
Im not trying to get it back from bethesda its just a warning for fellow vault dwellers
---
Unusable would be an exagerated. Fully moded Flamer without a nozzle (nozzle makes it's range inferior) is an excellent support weapon but usually you don't need a support guy if there isn't any area that will allow a support to be viable. It works with Friendly Fire and hit multiple enemies with debuffs (Suppression and Tenderizer). Plasma Flamer doesn't work with Friendly Fire.
---
Its the same problem i have!!
---
Yeah it is a lot of fun...ive been carrying around 25k for the longest time....theyre almost all gone, AND ive been selling stuff in the box. Crazy
---
Yes. It isn't consistent.
---
The quest starts at night so just head over there around 8P in game. The world time is on your pipboy.
---
You can run the quest each night without changing servers or anything. In my experience, server hopping doesn't give you any better chances but your mileage may vary.
---
How do you put the frog in the jar?
---
Thanks man, appreciated.
---
Nah, is the 'sinusy' kind. If snot would be gold I would be retired by Monday. In my own private island. With an army of henchmen and my own shark pool.
---
Regarding the game at least the devs are showing willingness to devote time to things other than pressing on with the roadmap. Hopefully there will be a hiatus of some sort between the current DLC (that is now coming to an end) and the next one so they can take stock and do some bug fixing.
---
i can help you - ign dignite
---
Its not a lack of legendary ghouls. Its a lack of non legendaries carying legendary items. Whitespring always had non star non labled legendary drops. All the ghouls have turned in their legendaries for golf clothing.
---
Ultra amazing, I am thinking of printing it and make it a book once more are released!
---
Much cooler than the bestiary of the official guide which I like and own as well
---
Way to get a leg up on the competition
---
Yeah I do that quite regularly but I've never had any paint unfortunately. Thanks
---
I'll use that advise next time I ask you for it. Thx!
---
Hahah! Yeah, could be that... Don't have a sulfur spring handy around here though, shame :P
---
Did it get resolved?
---
If you make a book out of those available for purchase I want one!
---
Sweet! Added you.
---
Fiv
---
Stops melee enemies and makes it easier build in an area with rough terrain. Other than the Whitespring golf course I can‚Äôt think of anywhere that‚Äôs flat in the entire camp buildable area.
---
Did you? I cannot see anything from you
---
Thought plans are not dropping anymore.
---
This game is so insanely unrealistic that this really shouldn‚Äôt be considered that crazy lol.
---
Only issue I had was my four vending machines spontaneously unlisted everything. Was a pain relisting but didn't lose anything.
---
Wish i had saved my money and i wish this review was around prior to buying it at launch.
---
Hopefully they were nice
---
Odd I saw a post saying the person could drop broken ones and telling people not to repair them if they wanted to sell them. Maybe they lied :(
---
She flies outside the game border no matter where the nuke hits, this launch method sure has a lower flux yield, but allows for non power armor melee builds or bloodied fighters to actually take part in thr fight by leaving a section of the Battlefield exposed!
---
Its a Saturday night. I'm sitting here watching the footy while my character sits in her house tending my vending machines. I've made 10k caps selling my stuff. I love this. 
---
The next step is to somehow watch a stream on a TV inside the game.
---

Nice! I'll add you the next time I'm on!
---
So does the black ring suggestion.  Notice Forward Station Delta isn't covered.
---
It isn't too bad. If your past the soft level cap you should be able to easily complete at least 3 of the Tadpole challenges. 
---
The swimmer challenge is very doable even for a solo player.
---
The Crossbow challenge isn't more then 30 minutes of work, In fact I actually rly enjoyed that one.
---
And there was another Tadpole challenge that I completed without even looking.
---
Found it.  For some reason had to log out and back in.  Thanks for the help

MizTracey is 19 episodes in so far.  [https://www.youtube.com/c/MizTracey](https://www.youtube.com/c/MizTracey)
---
I know, but she still flies outside the border when you do that, or if the nuke hits directly, it's just easier to get to V9 for most players! And is a shorter less awkward trek home as you don't need to go through a nuke zone to leave if your looting made you overencumbered!
---
I do it occationally and have gotten one paintjob (knight if i remember correctly). It's a tiny tiny chance.
---
Thanks for reporting back! I love blasts from the past :)
---
Yeah that queens spit attack melts my bloodied build before I can get out of vats more times than not.
---
Go to Camp Venture anyway.
---
Nice guide. Really helpful so saving this post for later by making a comment for easy find later and thanks again for making this!
---
Yeah having the same problem. Sometimes i wonder if it's intended that no quest marker appears or if it's a bug. And sometimes i don't trust the quest markers because they're completely wrong.
---
I've done Atomics Fan and Rail Enthusiast, no problems with those.  Musician got stuck like everyone else.
---
Id love archways could use them as a support type deal inside the camp.
---
What i really want is metal powered doors. All i can get is brick and it ruins my metal cliffside bar. ;(
---
Same thought, heard no ones getting drops for them or maybe they just made the drop even rarer then before.
---
It does not have to be alive. The person that said that is wrong. I‚Äôve completed numerous of dailies and weeklies with the animal/creature being alive or dead.
---
Thank you for taking your time making this i agree with everything that you wrote. Hope you'll have a fantastic day
---
It's a useful starter base design where the only thing you have to fear is scorch beasts and the enemies the drop on the roof of your home!
---
I remember spending an hour there during the BETA. When I did the athletics badge quest I headed over there right away and did the whole course on my first try and it‚Äôs felt so damn good.
---
This is amazing
---
Thanks, will do!
---
That they haven‚Äôt fixed this by now is ridiculous.
---
Could it be ‚Äúi don‚Äôt want to set the world on fire‚Äù? it starts with a higher voice, but goes into a deeper gravely voice and it goes ‚Äúi don‚Äôt want to set the world on fire baby, i just want to start a flame in your heart‚Äù
---
Call customer support, they regularly refund atoms if you buy something and its not suitable for your needs, they did for me when I thought the Imposter Sheepsquash Assultron Head was a skin!
---
Due east of Morgantown. There are three cabins up the mountain.
---
For the swimmer challenge with reviving a player, the stream at Whitesprings is the perfect depth.  It's really deceptive because it's not a depth that you can swim in.  It's basically ankle-deep water that it works in, but it's not broken.
---
Initiate is 3k+.  No longer drops due to error.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l6vqPUM\_FE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l6vqPUM_FE)
---
Initiate at least 3k
---
The economy is far better with more sellers available. Having to go through the subreddits was a pain, and finding someone to trade with in game was a crap shoot. 
---
As far as pricing, so far I think people have been pretty reasonable with some stuff. 
---
So, as a consumer I love player vending. Sometimes farming for certain things would take an entire game session for me. I have more time now to enjoy things like exploring, and I have a reason to spend caps on shit I actually use.
---
I'm with you. I hate this and all the unimaginative boxes. 
---
I'd understand creativity when i see it,like a guy that made a plane looking house. But those damn minecraft boxes....they deserve an artillery strike.
---
Also the houses in the middle of the street. Like  what idiot would build there,in a world with active raiders?
---
Or when I die it gives a quest marker for every death I've had that session! So by the time I find the right one, someone else nabbed my loot!
---
6 of "might not like" applied to me at least in Fo4. Base building actually has a purpose in 76 and I have been hooked on the camp idea since launch. Now with player vending 6 may be irrelevant.
---
I'm gonna put 4, 20, 6, and 9 on my shop list through whatever memes necessary
---
Actually in the last 2 days is actually gotten better for me the golfer ghouls have actually been dropping legendaries for me now
---
Don't think it's as good as it used to be but better
---
I‚Äôm not a fan of it either. I look at the dailies and may do it if I‚Äôm close to leveling up on one of mine and the conditions aren‚Äôt too bad, like level up at Whitespring, over level 76, in an asylum uniform, okay. Drunk, naked and in PVP, not so much.
---
Sometimes I get it by complete accident and have to look at what I checked off. Enclave uniform counts as formalwear, turns out.
---
You're right that looked amazing in the concept. The usual data mole miners saw the next skins for the backpack and bethesda pretty much cut out all the cool or original ones like the tire,sloth and mini mothman.
---
Travel agent will make this hurt your feelings 30% less.
---
What sucks is that apparel ALSO shows up as armor in the machine preview, so you could get a surprise like I did... and found a clown uniform for 800
---
Your axe could break so take back up melee and a few guns. There is a lot of whacking going on and shooting so be prepared.
---
My biggest problem running a silo is forgetting which way to go. Though I do it solo which has to be harder than with a group.
---
Or you could really not complain about stuff that people throw in. I really wouldnt expect to see anything good in vending machines. Makes more sense to put scrap and ammo in and then sell your rare stuff privately and be able to do a trade or work out a deal.
---
If its not i dont want to set the world on fire by the ink spots maybe its [Nobody‚Äôs Fault But Mine by Blind Willie Johnson](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_o4omd8T5c)
---
I‚Äôve had this issue since Wednesday. Beth support said there‚Äôs a rare issue where main accounts get instantly disconnected from the server. I was told they were launching a fix for it sometime today so we‚Äôll see. If it isn‚Äôt working by tonight, I‚Äôd submit a support ticket. 
---
I‚Äôll let you know if I hear anything else.
---
cant have free FT all over the map... otherwise great suggestions
---
Well I meant plans in general, not serum plans.  Sucks that they removed them from the pool if they did.  Has anyone contacted support to ask?
---
If you look at a lot of details they dont make any sense whatsoever, im fully convinsed that with the camera a 3d artist made the model and the programmers made the mod and they had no interaction between eachother.
---
Because like you said, the lens that you put into the camera sure as hell aint 105mm
---
Who is Graham?
---
On a side note, with the latest exploit fix yesterday the enclave bunker shops are once again back down to only one terminal at each working...on the flip side, MODUS has finally lost his permanent smile all over the bunker (which oddly enough, started the first time they made the terminals "busy")
---
Help me do it an I'll return the favour?
---
I found a mr fuzzy head for 800.  Didn‚Äôt buy it.   Should have.
---
Is there any reason to do more than 3?
---
Bait and switch is to offer one thing, and then sell another. That is not what is happening. You see how much of a general category they have, with nothing stating about whether it is legendary or not. The player cannot dictate how the game notes what they have.
---
I get your frustration, but it's not like they are advertising a false description of their wares.
---
Yeah, pretty much bloodied melee is the real meta rn
---
Anti armor explosive and bloodied explosive,I've been seeing furious exploding ive going for a lot too
---
The point is so that people can choose which 3 to do that will actually succeed.
---
I have seen a lot of crap ( no offense ) usually overpriced also.
---
Try the big fred¬¥s BBQ shack, I always see one there on a shelf!
---
Is what I do, the second it starts to load in I tried jumping around. With marsupial usually gets me out of most of these jams although sometimes I end up inside a locked part of their camp.
---
We need to buy the Rk from the atom shop otherwise they will nerf repairing perks. I'm calling it
---
SBQ, not just any
---
Yes it's Nobody's Fault But Mine. I'm grinning for ear to ear now! Thank you so much. Normally my taste is all about metal but this track stopped my wandering whilst I listened.
---
There's only one spot that comes to mind and that's the part of the orchard you can build on
---
Bloodied explosive is the best you can get.
---
In my opinion there are handmade weapons out there that are really effective. 
---
LMG had a buff that made them deadly as well. 
---
I‚Äôm not really a low health player but a lot of people have glass cannon builds that are impressive. Bloodied gauntlets at 20% health doing 1500+ damage. No nerfs there.
---
A more satisfying solution would be a 2 minute timer, that flags the player hostile for pvp when it runs out, upon opening a vendor trade window.
---
Youre welcome
---
Archery, hunter, and that athletic one were super easy. Why not just do those.
---
This is like pretty much every local commercial I've ever seen.  All you need is a bit where there's a bunch of kids screaming your slogan.  I hate when people do that, but it's a thing.
---
I think you might be thinking of Nobody's Fault but Mine by Blind WIllie Johnson? The voice fits your description pretty well and if that's true then what you're likely hearing is "soul be lost" being referenced several times in the song.  
---
If it's not? It's still a real good, soulful blues song from 1934!
---

---
No such thing as a meta, they've shown that with their nerfs. if something over performs they'll kill it. People like Bloodied Explosive/swing speed and Sentinel gear, usually Assassin's or Unyielding. Your best money is on Bloody Unyielding gear as there's too many perks, mutations, and gear that relies on low health for it to get nerfed *too* hard
---
pve and pvp are different beasts. just like you can't jump into survival in full excavator with maxed weight reduction perks, a pvp-centric build won't be much effective in adventure.
---
for pve, bloodied+explosive/faster fire rate anything.
---
Sure why not
---
Dude... the point... I started with two that were bugged... so you've answered the question... Athlete and Hunter work.
---
As does swimming.
---
This is the reason people are spending ages at the vendors though.
---
This is what "inspired" the Zep song of the same name. It's a great piece of music history, in my opinion.
---
Yeaaaaah you shoulda
---
Yes they do work.
---
And here i am, trying to sell my fashnacht masks for 49 or 99c a piece...
---
I guess i wasn't that smart when i farmed that event like an idiot... Everyone has those masks and nobody really wants them...MAYBE in a couple of months they'll be worth a bit more, but i'm starting to doubt it. They're ugly and a waste of stash space; also extremely annoying to scroll through.
---
Ok. Thx for the info. Maybe a good time to use the repair kits the SBQ dropped .... If your on PS4  you can always join us....
---
I did not know about the fountain, I might go and check it out, might need to server hop to get radscorpions to spawn. Thank You.
---
Me and my wife are on ps4 and just came back to it with the Appalachia update. Overall it feels good way less buggy than launch now it's rare to ctd, it still happens to both of us occasionally though. 
---
The vendors might be the best thing for the community though everyone is checking out all the camps and focused on buy shopping instead of trying to destroy my camp. Actually is pretty fun just exploring with the wife, it finally feels like fallout.
---
I used to rock the Camden outfit and She-devil head, but switched to tattered mole head+scout uniform. Darn near perfect combo
---
The athlete one I think is easier than swimming. Just run some obstacle courses. 
---
Plus all the answers to the test exams are now out. https://www.gamerevolution.com/guides/536977-fallout-76-order-of-the-tadpole-all-exam-answers
---
They just need to give us back the fast travel mats that were in the BETA and the issue is solved, no having to build the structure around where the C.A.M.P. was placed, no moving the unit  around to get a spawn not inside a wall or cliff face and a way to have players spawn exactly where they want to spawn.
---
I'm on now my GT is HyperLethal95
---
I think the ones to avoid are Empath, Herd Mentality and Grounded.
---
Birdbones and Egghead are OK. Just my experience. I have all but those above.
---
I dont particularly like them either, but I get the reason why so if that's what they want then let them build.
---
Unlikely they would know their own stealth nerfs though or be allowed to tell what they were if they were excluded from patch notes on purpose :(.
---
I can never get them to work
---
The best source are the giant pitcher plants in Cranberry Bog.
---
Just a bit dangerous down there so be prepared.
---
they're also useful because you can use them directly from your pipboy, so if you're in the middle of something and your best weapon breaks you can quickly repair it
---
Did you try killing them with it?
---
Awesome.  Have you had any count towards tadpole badges?
---
Thanks for the help man!
---
Unless they‚Äôve been fixed, optimized bracers are trash. They only decrease AP costs for unarmed attacks. And since you can‚Äôt use unarmed weapons in PA... it‚Äôs literally only for fist attacks. Like every other PA arm mod. Which is so bullshit- let‚Äôs get some Stabilized mods, and some other options. 
---
And recon hud (x-01 only) is pretty baller. And Emergency Protocols torso is fucking clutch for low health PA builds.
---
Yes, still not count
---
Yeah, it's a teaser, too.  Access door opens and closes but no beverages.  :(
---
I bought mine within the last few days from Graham.
---
For serums or the recipes?
---
Yes also strange in numbers and class freak
---
Plans, maps, virginity, all great things can be sold there.
---
There is a part lower down that the walls of it do not have collision, but then as you go further up the objects become solid again.
---
I love this idea. Make it happen Bethesda
---
A wandering Super Mutant vendor.
---
I ditched all mine except for the Owl mask and the Solder mask. Really got sick of the Giant , Witch and Toothy Man.
---
I think the beret was the best item.
---
huh?
---
I'll trade my Black Lupis and all my merxes for a 2 shot Handmade.
---
Armor bench.
---
What the need to do is open a window that shows what the things actually are when you inspect them.
---
This ^
---
People are saying it's bigged. No way around it.
---
&gt; And is the unarmed build good after the patches ?
---
 Unarmed is the best melee build since beta
---
Bloodied explosive is meta for ranged now
---
I never spawn anywhere near my camp device, so I don't think that's how it works.
---
I‚Äôve never done this I‚Äôm a hermit that lives on the very edge of the map and I tend to build stupidly large homes but I always build where there are very little enemy encounters hell I don‚Äôt even use turrets because of budget use
---
This is a very good post, I would only add fps drops/lag spikes, they can be horrifying bad, like &lt; 5 fps bad.
---
And you‚Äôre totally right about testing for yourself, I was on the fence for months and only jumped in when the game was under 20$.
---
And you know what? I‚Äôm loving every minute of it, for sure, I would change many things, but still, I‚Äôm having a blast.
---
Note that I was helped, play in coop, with a high level friend.
---
Have fun people!
---
There are usually people who already have the codes for the week, you should just have to find it online and have a nuclear key card to set off a nuke. Just make sure you‚Äôre looking at the right silo for the code, if you get it wrong that burns the key card.
---
Even once the hazmat suit breaks, you don't take that much in the way of damage.  You just go from less than 1 per second to 1 per second.
---
Now, if they can repair Grognak's Axe to over 100%, then they won't be completely useless.
---
You dont need the code pieces to set off the nuke, my dude. You can just Google the codes.
---
You get the locations from the Enclave Bunker don't you?
---
I think that's the shortest route.
---
The berets and 2 owls are the only ones i managed to sell. All to 1 guy, i guess he wants to resell them. 
---
I know i could have squeezed a few more caps from my berets but eh, i'm just happy i got rid of them.
---
As a bloodied HW build.... I feel pretty overpowered. About the only thing that I consistently die to is the sheepsquatch event, and that event just has so much damage flying around it‚Äôs insane. I can also die to random yao Guai attacks if I‚Äôm distracted (their charge attack hurts, and then you‚Äôre stunlocked and they smack you down), like on the queen fight. Mirelurk Queens are the same way- a threat if I‚Äôm distracted, but not so bad otherwise. My damage output is so high I can melt Mirelurk Queens in seconds from 200 yards with auto fire. Hell I melt the sheepsquatch in about 8 seconds.
---
So maybe I finally can use my Troubleshooters gatlin gun that has been in my stash for 2 months..... (I completely forgotten about it ) 
---
30 damage to robots and bullets explode for area damage ...
---
Wtf rly
---
What‚Äôs the purpose of bloody in pve? I mean I‚Äôm not running bloody and the game is not that hard lol
---
Yeah there is a repeatable quest you can do which shows you where the specific one is and you get to stuff for completing the quest
---
One of mine is inside the monorail pillar. I spent an insane amount of time to make sure my foundation for my stairs outside was at the right angle and elevation so the floors inside all lined up perfectly with the inside features and nothing looked like it was hanging. 
---
I get the silly cramps, but I prefer more realistic.
---
Also, miss the big metal scaffolding structures of FO4
---
It‚Äôs called the bear claw I think, I heard it might be coming with the arktos pharma patch
---
Yeah dude, code pieces are just extra legwork. Once you get to the end of the silo, all you need is the code and the nuclear keycard.
---
I found running away is the best bet.
---
Right now I only have 3 of them, arranged in basically a **C**\-shape, with none of them making any physical contact, but I'll definitely heed your advice. 
---
In addition to having no power wires connected, what would you say...  
---
2 connected foundation pieces with all 3 vending machines spread out sufficiently and no wires?  
---
*OR*  
---
3 *unconnected* foundation pieces, one for each vending machine?
---
plans, you can make them as many times you want
---
yup, if you wanna run through decrypting on your own (weather you enjoy it or wanna see if you can do it) this is the fastest method to get a full set for the same silo.  only downside is that it eats your caps
---
On PC but good luck - it's certainly doable.
---
Yeah, not supposed to happen. Somehow the companion command interface can still sometimes activate in ‚Äò76 (that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre seeing, if you hadn‚Äôt realized. Commanding companions around in Skyrim/FO4)
---
Well what are we rating? Astetics? Whats on offer in the shop? Functionality?
---
How would you improve your score after you get negative feedback as less people are likely to visit?
---
Can you leave more than one rating? Can you change the rating? What overheads dies that bring to the server.
---
Dont mean to bash your idea, i sort of like it. But rating systems can backfire, just look at what steam is now doing to counter review bombing while still atempting to keep freedom of speach in the consumers hands.
---
Generally before implementing a feature one must ask "what problem are we solving?" since i dont think there is a problem, consideration should be made to not implement it in case it causes negative player actions.
---
This is glorious!  Alas, I am not on Xbox, but I wish you well in your merchandising endeavors, sir.
---
melting everything? soloing the queen and imposter?
---
Well someone need to decrypth it first every week.
---
^^^
---
Perhaps I‚Äôm dense (which I know for a fact that I am), but is there anyway to see what Level the camp owner is from the map or even from the Social menu without joining their team or having to manually find them on the map?
---
This MIGHT save some headache. Not to rip on new or low level players, but in all honestly, the chances of me traveling to a camp operated by a Level 1-39 is pretty small at this point (excluding the obvious exception of camps run by mule or secondary characters of higher level players). 
---
Now I‚Äôm sure players Level 1-39 also May prefer to seek out camp vendors with armor and weapons that they can actually use and fits their level, whereas some End Game players might prefer to spend their time at higher level camp vendors. 
---
Not saying that some end game players won‚Äôt put non-legendary Lvl 10 wood arm pieces in their inventory just to pad the numbers or because their oblivious generally accepted in-game common courtesy, but hey, shit happens. 
---
Either way, I‚Äôd like to see player levels as an instant pop-up when the Vendor Summery Box pops up. But id also like to see a raised cap limit and ability to blue print Perk Builds. I‚Äôm not holding my breath with regards to any of these. 
---
Please excuse long post. Brevity has never been my strong point. 
---
++++
---
I play on XB. Gamertag: PRL867. Level 270 something. Feel free to join or send me nasty XB messages. I‚Äôm bored anyway.
---
Yup low footprint so i can stick it down on a square of ground where a "normal" 3x3 would never fit also its a quick deploy sniper tower/ machine gun turret nest (i put them on raised platforms sticking out the side of the shaft so i get near 360 degree cover and melee mobs can't touch them.
---
But the amount of places you can slap your 3x3 or larger normal base are much much fewer than the number of places i can stick "mushroom tower"
---
For some reason its not showing up for me. Do you have to know how to craft the tadpole backpack before you can craft this one?
---
wot about pvp
---
Confirmed! I just stumbled across a tameable Snally a few minutes ago.
---
Yeah so i can give worst grade to every selfish human, who is locking is doors!
---
That's what we used to think, no.7 is here is baking.
---
You have to get the three Tadpole badges. Then you will be given the lvl 20 pack and the plan for the standard pack that you can craft to lvl 50.
---
I found it and I must thank you, me and my dad have been searching forever for this shit
---
yes, its a paint mod for the standard backpack
---
True story
---
Go to Nukacrypt
---
Has the codes every week once solved
---
Ah, that explains it. Thank you for the speedy response.
---
Umm, didn't you know about the Legendary Vending Machines at train stations?  You trade in Legendary stuff there to get "Scrip" (which you'll use to buy Legendary stuff from the new Vendor).
---
At least check which type of wood armor it is (Sentinel/Vanguard/Assassin's, whatnot...) before dropping it, if you still don't like the idea of keeping wood armor.
---
Holy shit.
---
[Phone almost had me say Hokey shit. Still true.]
---
Thank you guys ! So I already have a full Unyielding set and 2 good bloodied unarmed weapons xD so i hope i make a lot of dmg with them
---
I hate them so much, especially when I go into a sever that I can‚Äôt place my camp so I go look at what‚Äôs there and it‚Äôs one of those ugly wooden space ships
---
Of course I know lol just didn't know if legendary wood armor Was really rare or something. And why can it only be 1 star?
---
Some People texted me on reddit via Marketdiscord and telling me my camp is awesome. best feeling dude i love it
---
So in the pvp mode you think it‚Äôs dumb to destroy bases? The game is one sided enough to carebares
---
You including the heavy barrel mod?
---
One tip though - you don't have to engage every robot or assaultron you come across. That's why it helps to know where to go. You can outpace a lot of the enemies.
---
It‚Äôs a wasteland get gud, or go broke trying
---
Still on?
---
I can use sneak perk
---
Lol, melee builds that do 30k damage per hit sure do get in the way... of enemies lasting too long.
---
Im surprised really this question is still asked. Fo76 is not really that expensive anymore and if one is really onto fallout universe definately should buy it. I personally enjoy it tremendously and Bethesda is so good at adding new content and refreshing game in the process making me interested in playing it at all the times.
---
At this moment its my favourite universe I play in.
---
Hey now, maybe he‚Äôs a role player or prefers IMMERSION. 
---
Even though I think my point is relatively valid, I‚Äôm being tongue in cheek. Hell, I bought all the Faschnat and Sheepsquatch outfits and plans plans the day after the events launched just so I wouldn‚Äôt have to be bothered with actually having to play the game. 
---
Yep, this is what my ‚ÄúEnd Game‚Äù is like. Scintillating, isn‚Äôt it?
---
But I do love the game. 
---
I also loved my Ex Wife at one time too though. ;)
---
How often does anyone really travel by road?  And what raiders? Raider's don't exist anymore, not in adventure mode and nobody in their right mind would build something fancy in Survival(unless they enjoy rebuilding that much).
---
Buy it on a reseller for $15, dont buy this buggy mess for full price otherwise you're the fool
---
You're welcome ;)
---
Umm, you wanna have the wooden sword and I'll take the metal sword?  How's that gonna go?  I mean, unless you're some kinda master ninja, I'm just gonna cut right through your sword, but, still wood armor could be better than no armor.
---
try the conference room terminal and use "register as pioneer scout"
---
What?
---
Did it similar way however I manage to do it at Morgantown airport, but I guess any low lvl area will do.
---
Cool, I will be there
---
One of the reasons I'm not really invested in this game, online games economy is super important to me.
---
most people don't do it, but that's why the made it so. I wouldn't really waste too much energy on it.
---
Yeah. Is fare game. 
---
I'd only take specific things I need though.
---
That's Grahm, not Graham.
---
Honestly ive got couple of those repair kits, no idea where I did get them, maybe some kond of event, and I dont think I will use them at all. My build requires barely any repair. I wonder can I sell them...
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt even use any mele perks and can be at 50% health and it wrecks everything.
---
no
---
[Did you say locked part ?! that guy....!!!](https://imgur.com/TdDNBSi)
---
Dont know bout that but I'm looking everywhere for an Instigating Lever Action +10% DMG when aiming +1 AGI
---
If it's always the same spot you can add a mattress near them so they can go to sleep on it. That'll glitch them out of the wall.
---
This does not appear to work on my ipad.  I can see what the map should show but there are no markings on the maps
---
My BE Shotgun sucked after this latest update so I got rid of it. Now I have all kinds of perk space in Strength.
---
Faster fire-rate,, DPS over anything pretty much
---
I ran into a 3 star Legendary Assaultron in the launch room in Bravo ( right at the end ). It killed me so I respawn outside and head straight back in and took the SOB out.
---
You can run past a lot of the robots and the early assaultrons. I think the trick is to move quickly.
---
You should feel lucky. I remember playing games before quest destination way points were invented.
---
 Yes there was a time when you didn't mindlessly run to the next waypoint marker.  You actually had to read the quest and use your brain to figure stuff out.
---
 I know...that sounds crazy and unthinkable these days.
---
Indeed its practical and redeployable. Ive got one building bluprinted like that. Its briliant if You wanna move bases quickly just for farming resources purpose. My main building though is posh and I spend good few hours building it.
---
The problem with that is a lit of people are looking for both the bonus of the SBQ *and* the nuked flora.  The best way to do this is by nuking both fissures so that you can farm the kills from nuked scorched for the components to make stable flux.  I usually get around 10 or more violet flux this way.  I'll concede that the SBQ may fly off the map anyway, but I've seen it more often when people drop the nuke south.
---
They are very hard to find. I spend sometimes like 10 minutes trying to find little dot of the quest marker on map in a location that I would never suspect.
---
If there's a camp in my normal spot, and if I'm just running around to vendors and stuff, I'll just stay in the same world. As soon as I spawned in I started jumping and it ended up in his locked part which he was also in. He started shooting at me so I got on my mic and said "Hey jacakass, you're the one that locked me in here. Quit shooting at me and let me out." He then open the door and threw up the confused emote.  Probably still trying to figure out how I got in there.
---
:(
---
Show us on the map where the noob trolled you?
---
What specifically doesn't work?
---
Which makes this post bullshit. They only ever got rid of the well know dupe methods and left the others and dont even bother to test patches before release to see if it's back. But somehow bethesda are blameless in this
---
It's not like you can steal anything lol.
---
These are the people you have to watch out for in real life..
---
Dang. That sucks. Thanks
---
Why did I think that was Shrek from the thumbnail
---
I'd buy it to go with my Nuka Rocketsuit in a heartbeat
---
This is GENIUS. For those that don‚Äôt have power armor, this or a bench is the right answer.
---
Did You try to craft it in weapon workbench to inplement it? For atoms You do buy only a design. But You need to carft it yourself.
---
I use the exact same build on pvp and pve with great success: full assasins sentinel armor, maxed damage perk three, BE weapons and stealth boys.
---
It happens. Sometime I see a bag  and no sign of the owner ( deceased or MIA ).
---
And sometimes I grab it I'm not proud to say. 
---
It's hard to turn it down if it's full of stuff you need.

archeologist is easy once you have a fedora. Go to west Tek and pick up bones off dead super mutants. You can take a pic of fossils beneath the big saw wheel thing at Mount Blair.
---
Right.  Like I spawned in behind him and he turned around and instinctively just started shooting me. Which I kind of get cuz I might have done that once or twice during a uranium fever event with somebody walking up behind me.  Haha.
---
For the camera quest
---
I got confused at some guy's camp and he was standing at the entrance and he helped me. He lead the way it was kind of nice. I mean I had too buy something now..
---
No, but you can get an idea of if it is the game for you or not.  For example this article his guy wrote would be very helpful in determining if it is most likely something you would like. And people willing to give advice like this (trying to be objective) in general (though you‚Äôll find plenty that will just go by their own feelings on the game rather than consider if some one else is looking for the same thing they are).
---
In robotics area? cause i tried several times but couldn't get it.
---
Ps4. I do run past them but my problem is I dont enter silos much so I get lost pretty quick. While Im trying to find my around the announcer brings more robots in. I rather follow someone than lead because I have no idea what Im doing.
---
Oh...so you're one of *those* people.
---
Holy shit that's great. Gave me a laugh!
---
Drop your scrapped junk at a tree near your base before going out to do an event. It will be there when you return. Hope you dont get disconnected or its byebye junkville

It's in the enclave bunker by white springs. You want to take a picture of the MODUS terminal with the main frame in the background that you can see through a big window.
---
He is on Playstation
---
I have a proper home on one character, that is just a ways east of the Angler pond in the north east of the mire.  The only thing out there that ever attacks, are cave crickets, and even then, they rarely do.
---
I also have 2 excessively large, seemingly "unimaginative boxes" across 2 characters.  1 that has no visible entrance, and is built close to several workbenches and 2 workshops, so nobody can complain about me being a bad player over not allowing them easy access to a workbench/stashbox.  The other has a proper door, everything important is on the 2nd floor, and the ground floor is just one big greenhouse(sort of).
---
Have to get the mainframe that you pass doing the intro speech when ya first join
---
Yup, and they were yes.
---
Hopefully one day! üôè
---
Sorry. Didn‚Äôt mean to insinuate or hijack. 
---
Some players (those that like to be fully ‚Äúimmersed‚Äù into the game) would never google nuke codes or watch walk thrus on YouTube as they prefer to actually decrypt and discover on their own so their Role Playing immersion stays intact. They then might ask for general help, but would consider googling codes to be a form of cheating. 
---
For the record, I google everything, and am not  one of the role players that I described above. I just think the game is fun and I got tired of GTAO. 
---
But that‚Äôs just me.
---
What's he doing exactly ?
---
i could buy it. I use AAE now, but BE should be better
---
Overpricing your items is not scamming, it is price gouging.  Definitely not the same thing.
---
I did an event earlier (can‚Äôt remember which) and when it finished it never came up on my screen saying I got items/plans/caps/xp but when I checked my inventory I had gotten rewards. I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs just a visual bug
---
I like a guest book idea, leave comments on the new fangled personal computer thingmy.
---
So, you know you don't have to completely break your crossbow to repair it right? I literally just made one, killed 1 enemy, repaired it, and repeated 2 more times.
---
Traded it yesterday for two explosive handmades.
---
I don't get why people keep bringing up this issue. This sort of plan defeats the purpose of investing special points into specific stats. By this logic, you could have an Intelligence of 1 but the utility of Intelligence of 5 to be able to use the cards passively if you own them. 
---
It pretty much make the trade-offs that you normally have to make when planning out and investing in your specials meaningless. Non-combat aspects of the game are just as valid and important as the combat-oriented ones.
---
I'm all for making the card swapping less painful with many suggesting perk profiles but I'm very much against this sort of thing.
---
They should‚Äôve banned all the duper‚Äôs when they had the chance instead of just clearing their inventories
---
I actually tried this, however they just seem to spawn deeper in the wall so they can't reach for the mattress anymore. So weird
---
Im looking for new friends to play fallout 76 with that are mature and arent kids, hmu gt is jared9990
---
Well...my camp is on Solomon‚Äôs pond.
---
Scuse me? Many of the people replying to him negatively are also people who play the game, like me (the first person to respond to him). And btw, I‚Äôve never been a whale in my life. The most I‚Äôve ever spent on mts is 20 bux and that‚Äôs only if the game felt worth giving the dev more money and the mts were not the type to encourage bad game balance (Bethesda has given up getting a dime from me soon as they introduced repair kits. And I convinced my friend who would have been fine with spending money here and there to stop). 
---
Maybe, just maybe we enjoy the game. Shocking I know, people having different things they enjoy out of a game than you.
---
They are one with the wall now, the CAMP has them. It‚Äôll be over soon.

He's charging 200 caps for disease cures and other aid items that are low value. He's charging over 200 to 300 caps over the value, he's praying on low levels and he admitted it to me.
---
I have one from a legendary drop. 2* Bloodied Plasma Flamer. Like people say, use it sparingly - but damn, it's jolly good fun.
---
I like how bethesda nerfed it. Main power of shotgun build is limb cripple, you can land scorchbeast in two good wing shots. Works great with melee builds
---
Well they proved to be a good investment.
---
I only have 1 single foundation camp, which is on a unique character.  And while I do admit its annoying seeing everything just magically supported, at the same time, it's a rather interesting camp.  It's built on the underside of New River Gorge Bridge(East) and I managed to build it up onto &amp; in between the bridge support(for the most part).  It was mostly done as a test, to see if I could.  And I will be breaking it down at some point to build a proper camp elsewhere, if only because the base level of the camp(the level that the C.A.M.P. is at) is so high up off the ground, I don't have anywhere to plant the razorgrain and corn I need for booze.
---
I'm not proud of but I have grabbed people's junk that died. I mean oh well right..
---
then again I don't have hundreds of pounds of junk on me at all times. I usually will get rid of it so if I do die it's not that huge of a deal where I lose everything.
---
Is it possible to ban their IP?
---
So if someone was charging over 200 caps for a disease cure you'd be fine with it? I'm sorry but to me that's a scam
---
The mire I full of water. I'm sure you could find a rare occupied place there
---
How TF do you keep the damn campfire lit???
---
Switched from the crumpled fedora to the white wolf fedora and it worked so I think someone forgot to put the crumpled ones on the list for challenge recognition lol
---
&gt;**So I was wondering if anyone was sitting on a little gem they are willing to share**
---
...and then turn that hidden gem into a popular location?
---
Hard pass :)
---
I have to recheck but couldn‚Äôt see anything new. Saying that if it was stimpaks like earlier I wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell.
---
This doesnt work always. I was stuck in foundation and woke up back in it. Always use concrete as the gap between foundations is nonexistent so it births you out.
---
Fast travel mats would ruin survival mode. Someone would fast travel to your camp cause your selling allot, then be stuck in a room full of turrets that they can't break and walls they can't destroy. Not that that's not happening already. It would just make it easier to do
---
Lol nobodys forcing you to buy anything. 
---
Its a free market. That also means anyone can sell at the price they want.
---
Totally agree.  I still see people hating on the game based on the condition of it at launch.  These people need to get a clue and realuze that a lot has changed for the better since then.  There's far less bugs, the servers are more stable and the new content just keeps getting better and better.  The devs are trying to make a good game even better and it shows.
---
The more you talk about a good thing the more the they will nerf it.
---
Does the cannibal perk work with herbivore?
---
You could always message it, won‚Äôt tell pinky promise üòÇ
---
Same here. üòî
---
You do when you already had a crossbow and you had originally repaired it with the artisan perk ;) (that‚Äôs what happened to me).
---
Geez why?
---
I presumed any vendor in the forest was low level and any vendor in Cranberry Bog was hard ass.
---
I was trying in front of the camp.  Everytime I got close, someone would warp in to pick up a quest and "help" me kill the bear. I ended up having to do the one at the graveyard.
---
I use tents too. I have 10 of them, all completly loaded with decorations, tons of crops, all worktables, 4 shops, it's all lit up like the 4th of July, and I still have like 30-40% budget. Walls and turrets are for suckers.
---
Aw really? Dang I wanted the baby mothman thought it would look good with he marine armor
---
Long slong acres ready for your feeding needs
---
I know that but as I said he's praying on low levels which is extremely wrong and it ruins the game for the low levels
---
No worries my man, your secret is save with me and the whole of Reddit lol. Good location, I find that‚Äôs quite popular.
---
Foiled by our own technology. You maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you, damn you all to hell!
---
Useful primary + explosive.
---
Doesn't bother me very much. Had my bag stolen numerous times.
---
 The wasteland is full of junk so not really that big a deal.
---
 I personally would never steal somebody else's bag. 
---
 The world is full of lazy little gamer kids who don't want to collect materials for themselves so I do understand their point of view I guess.
---
I see screenshots of the map but the detail is so poor that there are no visible indicators on them.  Zooming in obviously doesn‚Äôt help
---
bruh, just use the bridge near flatwoods, there's a  backpack challenge there, once your both done, one of you jump off, have the other one revive, then rinse, repeat.
---
Fair point, and perhaps good general rule of thumb, but of course I‚Äôm the exception I guess. 
---
My camp is adjacent to Sunshine Meadows, in the protected zone, and I‚Äôm Level 278. 
---
Same camp location since Level 35. Yep, I‚Äôm THAT lazy guy.
---
I‚Äôm calling them wooden spaceships from here on out.
---
They can, but the Grognak Axe bug was apparently fixed last patch (not that matters, since melee weapons no longer get extra damage for being overrepaired.)
---
I'll be happy to help. My PSN is cupcake61894
---
Oh. Talk about a misleading title. 
---
I thought it was about someone stealing a give you were giving to someone else or transferring stuff between characters.
---
What you've described is just part of the game. They didn't steal your stuff. You were careless enough to a) have valuable items to lose and b) put yourself into a position where you died. Your stuff after death is fair game.
---
Wait, the extra capacity mod lowers some resistance? That's a bummer. Guess I don't gave to farm 3 more badges haha. I'll jyst but the armor
---
Wait hazmat suits break? I haven‚Äôt had to fix mine once and I assumed it wasn‚Äôt like armor but more like clothing.
---
It has more purpose in pve than pvp. You can counter the low health in pve with skill and gameplay. The low health in pvp is just suicidal.
---
Well, they were right about casual players, and wrong about gamers. Me and three friends all started playing at the same time in Beta. I am now lvl 234, my friends are now lvl 70, 59 and 26.
---
After the vendor update I noticed a lot of people have camps set up on that exact spot.
---
Bloodied build with maxed damage perk three + adrenaline mutation. Same gear in pvp and pve. For queen I switch strength perks to heavy gun and use BE minigun for her. Otherwice maxed rifleman and shotgun perks.

No I didn't take a pic so I figured no one would belive me lol

i tried to add a guy named Barn3tt but he wouldn't accept :(
---
Farm flux and craft cores at chemistry station. Super duper and [I] chemist and weapon artison or armorer or science master perks work well with crafting fusion cores
---
Go away you whiny little kid. Like legit who gives a flying fuck if a player is setting prices high. I have so many caps if I had a disease and needed it cured and was standing there I'd spend 200 caps. You post this guys gamer tag in attempt to get him in trouble for literally doing what the vendor was made for. This post should be flagged and removed due an attempted doxing over some dumb shit.
---
I don't really worry about that meta stuff. I play the way I wanna play.
---
I am a sneaky rifle build and can down just about anything in 1 or 2 bullets.  Minus the SBQ and sheepsquatch type creatures of course. 
---
 This is for PvE mind you. I have no interest in PVP.
---
It's not a scam. It's just over-priced. Scam implies some amount of deception.
---
If he's selling for 200 and is taking advantage of people who have poor knowledge of the market, that's on them.
---
How is this even a thing? It's really a non-issue.
---
Redditors and your silly puns
---
Don't know why you're being downvoted, I think that's a capital idea.
---
Why Grounded?
---
Where did I say one should be able to use a rank 5 card with one point assigned to the stat? 
---
Oh, wait, I didn't.
---
Ideally, you would still need to be able to equip the card, in order to get the passive crafting benefits, you just would not have to do it.
---
Though I do like the card loadout profile, idea as well.
---
Just the PUNishment
---
Awesome work! The fusion core map...do they respawn? Or once you grab one for a location that‚Äôs it? Thanks for the maps!!
---
Or they‚Äôll do it anyways because it will make more sales. And they see that repair kits sell. Personally I‚Äôm of he opinion bethesda gets no more money from me on this game unless they backtrack on the ‚Äúpay for convenience‚Äù shit. But I already know that‚Äôs not happening so guess I will just forego on atom shop stuff I can‚Äôt afford by working for it. And I‚Äôll be damned if I spend my hard earned atoms on repair kits. Too bad, I otherwise love the game and honestly would have loved supporting it more to encourage them to keep working on it (I don‚Äôt buy many mts because in general I hate them but if a game is good enough and doesn‚Äôt have mts that encourage bad game design I don‚Äôt mind spending a little extra money).
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll be back on like soon, I‚Äôll shoot you a message if that‚Äôs ok
---
That's you though, not everyone has a lot of caps, as I said he's praying on low levels who doesn't have a lot of caps
---
What's stopping you from doing it here?
---
A related question, I‚Äôve been to chicken so far to venture too far in silos. Do the enemies continually respawn? Or once you kill them or are you free to explore at your leisure?
---
Very helpful, I needed a better source of ingredients for my tequila's.
---
You would miss some mules if you don't visit low lvl camps. I sell items on both my main with a full base and my mule (lvl 3) with a pop-up vendor station.

why doesn‚Äôt bethesda create the capability to ‚Äúregister‚Äù items so the fingerprint of 5hem is saved for future retrieval in emergency...
---
i‚Äôve seen that fine in other games and it was a great success.
---
I don‚Äôt think I got any for the last event I was in (or at most I got 2). I can see at the repair bench I have 2 which I assume are regular and I haven‚Äôt used any.
---
We already are that's what our perk cards are.
---
What, r/fo76FilthyCasuals not open to such content?
---
You don't spawn where it was placed but visitors will.
---
It probably saves on budget too, like my four story flak tower of power is absolutely melted on budget but there's next to nothing in its rooms
---
if its &lt;20$ yes, anymore no
---
I definitely have a good handful of non legendary who gives a fuck items, but they‚Äôre priced appropriately. (See them mostly as mod scraps/stuff for lower levels. Can‚Äôt all be legendary bloodied/TSE‚Äôs for the high level grind crowd, we can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt all play that hard you know?)
---
My camp is rather bland and boring but I‚Äôm always happy to have visitors when I‚Äôm there. I hope they appreciate the low prices of the plans I‚Äôm selling
---
Ah... what about people just sell what they want to sell?
---
Also, I don't think you understand the meaning of bait and switch.

My fear is that the original owner would find me and then Grief me for the rest of my stay.

She can also glitch off the map even when the nuke has been targeted directly on prime, it happened on the server I was playing last night. 15 minutes left on the clock after her mutating and being brought back down to half health she flew at the ground, disappeared and never resurfaced.

this is my new favorite random encounter spot.  always something different, and right between 2 spawns for the new quests.

I'm not sure, but there may be a limit to how many people can be on your friends list. I'm constantly updating mine when I notice people haven't been on for awhile, so I'm not exactly sure. 
---
If that's the case his list might have been full, or he didn't notice the add. 
---
I also use an open mic, and was talking to every vendor that was around, but I don't think I got everybody I sent a request to, just the 6 I mentioned.
---
You got a Possum badge. Check the vending machines in the area to see how many you have.
---
Nice! I didn't see that. Thank you for letting me know

Sometimes that happens. It's likely you got a badge instead, however.

Now that would be nice. Where do I check for that?

The legend is they used a very rare legendary scope mod.  The scope mod was installed and sold by Graham‚Äôs ancestor (pre mutation of course).  The mod could only be completed with rare perk cards owned only be Graham‚Äôs family.  There is not much known about the rare legendary scope only that it was a 5 star legendary.  The plans and perk cards were destroyed by Graham‚Äôs ancestor after the horrible deed was committed. This is where the story varies, some say Graham and his ancestors roam Appalachia as a self imposed exile, but there are other stories indicating is was a curse placed upon Graham and his family. The curse is referred to as ‚ÄúThe Curse of Camelot II‚Äù.
---
Chally's ancestors were not involved with the scope, it is believed that the bond between the families is why Chally and her ancestor's accompany the Grahams on there journey.  The story is that Graham's ancestor told Chally's ancestor it was not their burden and Chally's ancestor replied "I'm your Huckleberry" (I might have add the last part but I believe it went down like that).

---
Even buying at a vendor it starts at max, but yeah it‚Äôs weird it does
---
Ive sold 3 bos costumes for 5k. Though theyre super rng. The cap ceiling is so low that i find collectors will pay that just to get a rare item and keep their own vending machines working.
---
It sucks, and I wouldn't do it to someone else, but it is fair game.
---
Now, the really kooky part is that another player can take your bag, but even if you see them to it, you can't take revenge without getting a bounty on your own head.  That's the part I find odd.
---
That goddamn tire armor on girl's shoulder

But you open a vendor, everyone travels there and now it‚Äôs not so hidden

Yea i know, but goes nicely with clearing the capitol building. Since i had to to clear it twice (in every toon)

This post isn't entirely helpful. This isn't a "SHOULD YOU COME BACK POST" like we all expected. It's a "have your opinion, Kyle" post.

I always have my own opinion, but its interesting to see what other peoples are and what caused them to stay or leave..
---
Don‚Äôt you have to find the plans for them?
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tire_armor
---
On the whole it's a plus. Still think it's early days. Don't think it's really settled yet. 
---
It'll probably change again once the legendary vendor comes into play.
---
The Possum Vending machine against one of the huts
---
Does this affect where other people spawn in too? I have a camp that I spawn in just fine for, but others often spawn beneath the floor... which is crazy because its a 3x3 spot and everything else is up in the air. I built my house in a river and it doubles as a bridge across the river.
---
I *think* world objects are hidden to the player for something like 20 hours after they take them. However this may be subject to more rules than that
---
Thank you I will check.
---
Yea ofc any low level place will do :) As long as there is lots of mobs to kill, and capitol building has a loooooot = less need to hop servers.
---
Glad I'm not the omly person who found this post to be unhelpful whatsoever lol

Hopefully soon, Bethesda should just release everything rather than this drip feed bullshit, it's like they want to delay getting your money.

Ah! So this is a problem people were having with mobile devices compressing the images far too much. In the browser you should have an option such as "request desktop site". Failing that people have said the Imgur app always gives proper definition
---
There is no set value to the items anyone can charge whatever they feel like just because most people sell it cheaper doesn't mean it's a scam. H this person is really only hurting themselves and maybe a few people will buy it but most will probably just walk away.

Jesus Christ I can see ur god damn picture

it calls TIRE ARMOR

I guess it would be new type of armor

Not a skin
---
You have the option to not buy it, you‚Äôre not being forced. You always have the option of paying a vendor bot or making/farming yourself. The vendors are just convenient for people, there are many vendors so not just stuck to that guy and his over priced items

security through obscurity has always been a fool's errand

It's a screenshot of new skins for atom shop. obviosly it's trapper armor skin. Because trapper armor is, you know, made of tires

As a long time fan of the series who has been very critical of Fallout 4 since its release, I agree. I'd go on to say 76 is an all-around superior game and superior Fallout experience, despite its issues. 4, despite its strong points, remains the biggest letdown in the series for me.
---
Its a nuclear fallout... man up.

Posts like these is what eventually going to get adventure mode in a server-wide pacifist mode and all pvp will be moved to survival.

I encountered some cheaters a couple hours ago. I played along and they were really some of the nicest people I've met in the game. They taught me how to dupe. Of course I reported the duping method to Bethesda but I didn't report the players because they were such nice people. Though they spent a lot of time complaining about the other cheaters in their "secret club" which I'm "not allowed to talk about."

We were taught in science class that even a sheet of every-day paper can have enough force in tornado-speed winds, to cut through a fair-sized tree. However, in 1996, Pluto was also still a planet and there were only some-110 elements on of the Periodic Table! lol  ^(\[)*^(there are 118 now, for comparison\])*  
---
As such, that "paper in a tornado" may not actually be true... heh *(could very well solely be based on math: weight of an 8x11 sheet, speed traveling in tornado vs a non-hardwood tree of X-diameter and Y-density; however, I'm relatively certain it's more based on witness accounts of finding sheets embedded in trees after a storm.)*
---
That being said, to clarify, I definitely wasn't questioning the kinetic energy of the missile and ***it*** being able to penetrate concrete (even a 6+ inch thick wall of solid concrete; maybe even reinforced). Nay, it was the blades specifically that the article mentioned being capable of that, and that's what I'm skeptical about (emphasis is my own):
---
&gt;"Some officials referred to the weapon as "the flying Ginsu," **because the** ***blades can cut through concrete*****, sheet metal, and other materials surrounding a target.** "
---
Alas... given I am unable to find much info on the actual blades (or spring size/pressure under tension), I can't really comment on how feasible it is. Just, to me, spring-launched blades come across as lacking the oomph needed to penetrate much more than sheetrock/furniture/flesh. Otherwise it would still pose a significant collateral-damage risk. (Again, tis only my opinion \[speculation\], and I'm by no means an expert; armchair or otherwise! heh)
---
There is a lot of reasons to do that actually. That's the best way to get more money with less resources
---
Game mechanic by Bethesda, not thieving, but being opportunist.. shitty one but still. You just have to be careful and not carry loads of good stuff.
---
LOL not harsh my friend, not harsh at all! A good assumption but why then can i whip 4 level 40"ish" super mutants at once (about 50 feet away from where i met the Mothman) and , yes, I know the MM is harder because of his attack tactics but he was still only level 35 and he whooped me. All by himself, with ease. Regardless the larger question remains. Is there an understandable algorithm to figure out BEFORE you walk into battle whether or not you can survive it?
---
The Free States are worried
---
Have you checked just south and east of Alpha? Creeks and ponds all around there.
---
Damn good idea thank you
---
Pretty low to mischaracterize and slander someone's gamertag like that.
---
So is prisoner collars, which is its own category.
---
 Regardless of the Mothman, the larger question remains. Is there an understandable algorithm to figure out BEFORE you walk into battle whether or not you can survive it?
---
Poor bastard
---
I wish I had a more accurate answer...from what I‚Äôve seen once you hit 20% health you get a 90% damage increase with a bloodied weapon. Furious maxes at +25% damage after several hits, maybe 5? Anti armor does roughly 15% extra damage flat. Hopefully someone else comments who has done some more extensive testing.
---
there a tldr for this?
---
I play for status. I know it sounds pathetic but there's something about being the best geared and richest player that motivates me. I've spent countless hours trying to achieve these goals and my efforts were shut down yet again by these dupe glitches. These people that spent a fraction of the time playing the game and trading in the market are a thousand times richer than me with little to no effort.
---
People don't want duping explained because that will lead to more dupers.
---
You can view that in your pipboy, just go to your status section and go over to collections or something worded like that.
---
Sorry to make you work so hard this early!
---
I love the community you guys have built! Is it on ps4 or one of the other platforms?
---
 viewers that fail to get the actual point of the video 
---
literally you
---
Well that's cool, I'm sure people will appreciate it
---
apology accepted.
---
Now THAT'S how you launch a missle
---
Well, what lvl are you and what build and wepons u Rockin? 
---
I dont know the algorithm, but when i started f76 mothman was hard early game, now i one hit him regardless of lvl or situation or hos many enemies thay is around. Like, gearwise, cardwise, weponwise, how did you build yer char? With that info i can perhaps help you become stronger without altering yer Current build to much
---
You only need Home Defence to construct Turrets and some traps needs plans but no other defence stuffs needs plans
---
This subreddit is just for Captures and also for Fallout 4 Captures. Not just 76. But if you want to check if out and upload a capture of your own, feel free to do so! üëçüôÇ
---
he is certainly not a random, look at his viewers, you are the random here lol
---
Have you tried a sextant? Perhaps a compass?
---
Have you tried planing your monitor?
---
Probably should just get a new computer 
---
(This is a reference to the elegant gentleman's guide to knife fighting)

Isn‚Äôt the Mire the dark creepy park of the map, really good location that I completely didn‚Äôt think of, bit of a wimp and tried a base when I was a lower level and lasted about 3 days there, ‚Äúthe creepy cabin‚Äù rip that now.
---
I think fallout 4 had a welcome mat that did that. Wish 76 did the same I sometimes spawn in the river behind my house.
---
We need a complete reset! Or at least fresh servers to play on.
---
It is across all platforms, but ps4 is where the majority of are members are from. Check out our facebook page to become a member. EATT - The Establishment of Appalachian Taste Testers.

The video literally wasn't about that, it's comedy and it's extremely well presented
---
Git Gud
---
I always recommend a str build with power armor. Gatling doesn‚Äôt chew threw ammo too bad. Bloodied weapons are great. I exclusively use them
---
Thank you. Stupid me forgot about the mire. I usually move my camps at Whitesprings. What sort of enemies should I expect?
---
Sorry I fell back asleep, I'll get on in a bit
---
Looks like mixed results, but I have not tried.
---
I have doen this event 4 times, 2 first i did on one character, both times i got a plan and a badge, the 2 other times on my second character i got nothing.
---
Started thinking, the one that got plans and badges was wearing it's scout uniform, the other was not, could that be a "thing" ?
---
Anytime.
---
Of you like the game and are enjoying yourself, who cares what everyone else thinks?
---
people complain so harshly about the game because they wanted to enjoy it and or do enjoy so they feel emotionally invested
---
you are literally such a child that you complain that people COMPLAIN about something
---
Well at least it can spawn in the world for you. The hardest part of the cooking quest for me is the Cranberry Meatball thing. Killed like 4 scorchbeasts and only got 1 piece of meat - and that's with the maxed out meat perk card :(
---
I‚Äôm not an open vendor. I am one of the vault dwellers that doesn‚Äôt do human contact, and sometimes enjoy exploring in peace. üôáüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I‚Äôve done it twice and both times I‚Äôve not had the uniform on. The first time I got a stimpak and some other rubbish but definitely didn‚Äôt get a plan but need to look to see if I got a badge.
---
You have given one of the best counterpoints I have seen in a long time very well thought out and worded.
---
No, he didn't, he is literally called "Internet Historian" he makes videos about things that happened in the Internet
---
They can just swap IPs via VPN or by switching their router off long enough for their old IP to get reassigned.
---
Forcing people to have a world class speedrun while shopping's a horrible idea, how's the game supposed to detect being idle in the shop?
---
Server hop Pleasant Valley Cabins.
---
You got offended for him but you weren't even included. Relax bro.
---
I tried having a couple of bases down that area but find it‚Äôs quite a popular camp spawn for lower levels. Haven‚Äôt checked any of those places in a while. Thank you üòä
---
his channel goes after topics where hype was built up but then the creators just flop
---
Im a software developer. I have to do this with managers almost daily :)
---
REEEEEeeeeeeEE he trashed my precious gameeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Still need help? I'll get on. Saturday is a good day to launch a nuke.
---
Also very good areas to search. Thank you üòä
---
he makes videos about whatever he likes, the things he talks about aren't important, his presentation is and if you can't enjoy it you have bad taste
---
Im on now.
---
Lol I dont know why you got downvoted. They're brutal man killers, just because they show a moment of weakness does not demand our sympathy. That is insane.
---
How does the camera differ from photomode or screenshots. I left the game a month or so ago and I'm starting back up so this is all new to me
---
Being drunk isn‚Äôt a excuse to act a fool tho
---
I moved my melee build into a build with just 2 shotgun perks enforcer and skeet shooter, and it broke the game, enforcer will literally cripple nearly every single creature to a heap of goo that cant move or attack with one or 2 shots of an explosive shotgun to the legs.
---
Great!
---
Good luck to them. Although I can't be bothered myself. Doesn't take long to pick up a load of old junk.
---
If you're carry something precious on you, more fool you.
---
Still have it ?
---
Well now I want a hot tub.
---
I love it tbh. I get to play the game my way and make some caps. I can hunt legendaries and use the proceeds to buy junk for repairs. Gives me more time to do stuff I enjoy. Loving it!
---
This is an affront to America and her values, and a threat to her citizens. Prepare to be purged by the Enclave for your heinous misdeeds.
---
if he is a nobody then who the fuck are you
---
Way worse. People are selling stuff like serums for 300 caps each. That's previously sectioned off, endgame tier content going for pocket money prices. What's left to strive for? A mutation used to be a way to set yourself a little apart, soon everyone will be running around with them. Same goes for rounding off your collection of plans. Now you can probably find whichever one you want for around 50-100 caps.  
---
Also any weapon or piece of armour that isn't a legendary goes for peanuts. With player vending, players hoped that they could become a chemist/weapon-smith/armourer/wasteland chef but none of it is viable. The first three aren't viable because of resources sunk, and what people will pay with prices elsewhere. The fourth probably isn't viable for the same reason, but we can't know yet as any food added to a vending machine will continue to rot. 
---
So yeah, right now it's all a race to the bottom. Maybe it'll balance out over time, but I'm not too hopeful.
---
Master of all I survey.
---
Anyone know where the legendary vendor is located?
---
I guess everyone who has a camp should be making a creative house instead of a utilitarian one? Form over function in an apocalyptic landscape?
---
This has been requested since beta, they have no interest in doing this
---
There is a great spot at the lake near the top of a waterfall in the mire if placed right a camp can have tons of water and there is a lead deposit.
---
You are using your phone as a personal hotspot to play FO76 on a PC?
---
I can't really get a stable play experience without using my Ethernet, although the wifi adapter shows the same up and down porformance. I can't imagine trying to get the game synced via a phone. I'm going to try this just for the LOLs.
---
Two bars is OK for phone stuff but syncing this huge game cache?
---
Lots of creative ideas! üòä Hopefully Bethesda is still looking at adding more features for camps!
---
I think you're the kind of person who looks for things to get mad about. It's none of your GOD DAMNED BUSINESS why someone built the way they did. It's NOT YOUR CAMP!
---
Well it definitely shows lol
---
Dunno what the exact numbers are but the damage with each hit one only increases it at  like 5% damage each hit. Not sure what it caps too but it takes far to long to build up damage for it to be viable unless your using an automatic weapon.
---
My console is directly connected to the WiFi router it‚Äôs probably the internet provider I‚Äôve had problems with them before but that still doesn‚Äôt explain why the game crashes every time I try to log in
---
Switching loadouts could also be simplified by allowing us to create, and favorite perk card loadouts so we could switch between them with a hotkey or with the favorites wheel on console.
---
Would you mind telling me what the spawn is next too?
---
I‚Äôm down, I need to do that too
---
It was a joke
---
Heavy boys hit like a tank and mole rats follow you unless you kill them or get far enough away from them
---
Ah ! Got the same issue yesterday or the day before that day. It's annoying
---
sure, I'll help if you can help me as well (I have no friends and this quest is annoying me)

Guess I'll leave a comment. I got banned from m a r I e t 7 6 for buying the old man winter mask, cause some nosy ass person decided to report me for buying it. Now I'm banned for the next month from that place. Y'all might as well ban everyone else and all the people who are suddenly selling and buying those legacy weapons. Just saying. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Collect frog..then make the jar.. go into your camp mode and I think it‚Äôs under floor decorations ..click on it then bam! Frog in a jar.
---
My gamer tag is Saint Crompton
---
yikes
---
I used mine to repair a crossbow 3 times. :D
---
Makes total sense.  Beth is so paranoid about granting anyone too many abilities all at once ala FO4 but crafting is just crafting, like cooking is cooking (no perks at all), same concept with the vendor and Hard Bargaining, just implement it.
---
My question is. Could you build your base up there?
---
Agreed, unless it‚Äôs special ammo or explosive ammo (mini nukes, grenade rounds, etc). I‚Äôm debating on making a post outlining general ranges of things I‚Äôve seen at bases and what‚Äôs worked best for my base - seems like it might be helpful for people to see what others are doing
---
It's on the road near the red rocket shop just south of Harper's ferry. The bridge with the mannequins underneath.
---
Bumblebee!
---
If u are on a team or playing with 4 or 5 friends the WS nuke zone abound spawn a lot of legendaries
---
It‚Äôs almost 1% damage per 1% health lost. At 1% health you have about an 88% to 92% increase in damage. I guess 0.9% per 1% health lost.
---
How do you have 2bars on a router?
---
Anyway I tried logging on through my phone's personal hotspot and the game repeatedly failed to log on and crashed. Go figure?
---
Interesting. I‚Äôm level 120 right now, but I cant recall what level I was when I placed the camp. Definitely not the original location though. I remember the the game bugged out when I placed the camp where it is now and created an entire duplicate camp in my stored tab. I had to go and manually scrap the copy of each camp component. It seemed fixed at the time, since the camp was smaller at the time and I had lots of camp budget remaining, but I wonder if there remains something wonky with my camp itemization.
---
I'll be very happy if they can fix the weapons already in the game first.
---
One trick I have been using is to set aside your normal armor in favor of a full set of trouble shooters gear, it will reduce the damage by 75% from robots and you dont have to worry about repairing your good gear. Sure you wont do quite as much damage without your favorite gear but it wont matter if they cant hurt you. Also I would reccomend spending 2 points on enforcer and bring a shotgun, if you cripple assaultrons in the face with enforcer they cant laser you.
---
Dont think its in the game yet.
---
Ok cool. I‚Äôll invite you
---
I somehow ended up with an extra set of T60, fully modded/painted everything due to a server crash about 2 months ago. It does happen inadvertently.
---
On Playstation? You can come see it. Hang out. Play a tune. Whatever.
---
There's a thread about this on the Fallout 76 Settlements sub also. I removed all the decorations I'd placed under one of these staircases to rearrange them, and now none of it will go back because it tries to put it on the second floor or tells me that it can't place it because there's already furniture on second floor in the way. I can't remove the staircase because I'm worried about wrecking the entire C.A.M.P. I built around it.
---
I hope this glitch gets fixed.
---
lol, I'm in trouble.  
---
I was so embarrassed by how terrible my camp is that I just decided to embrace it and I added a dumpster and some flamingos.
---
Take for example assasins/sentinel/ap refresh marine chest or BE+agility handmade on PC: there are atleast 500 of these in the market. Many TSE weapon probably have thousands of copies of it
---
No my phone is picking up two bars from the router I assumed the console picked up less it‚Äôs just frustrating I don‚Äôt. See why I need to log in every time I go to play another one of Bethesda‚Äôs great blunders
---
They will continue to spawn until you reach the end. And you receive a small portion of exp from the majority of the respawns to prevent people farming them.
---
I got a badge one time out of the 5 or 6 I have done it.
---
You could still have the special level taken on account when calculating which passive grade of the perk to activate you know ?
---
It's not really that simple as just a resource. It's essentially a process where I'd take that xedit data and convert it into a personal file geodatabase this would require a license in arcgis or arcpro which is way to expensive unless you use it everyday like I do. Google ESRI and you can see the product suite. Then once it's in a pfgdb you can assign symbology and do analysis so like making. "blackberry run" is something you could do or looking at a heat map of coal being concentration. Then it's publishing it correctly and setting up the web app. I've got a master's in this and 5 years of experience so it's extremely complicated for someone just starting off which is why I can certainly do the brunt work and you can tell me what you like / don't like
---
Add me @ jared9990
---
I also hate this but recognize the practicality, and found a work around. I‚Äôve been building my homes nested inside power pylons, with a single foundation and some stairs leading up to the house. That way it looks like the house is resting on the frame of the pylon rather than defying the laws of physics.
---
You posted here...mr...69 (13 year old) to complain about getting banned from another sub? Dude. Nobody fucking cares about your little personal drama. Goodbye.
---
Can you give some detail about it? Thank you!
---
That would be a QoL thing and if one thing about Bethesda is for certain, it‚Äôs that they want the game to be as frustrating as possible. Wasting caps and DEFINITELY no perk loadouts.
---
ü§î I could use a friend for this one as well.
---
Nukacoke83
---
Hahah, sure. The reason I ask is because the weapons I like are broken so I want something new. Real ouroboros situation here.
---
Lever don't have magazine you can mod
---
Or you could put it In your stash. I dunno why anyone would keep their stuff on the ground.
---
Still shoots much faster than a hunting rifle and more precise
---
I just set up a new camp from scratch. The first thing I did was have a friend FT to it a couple of times and mark where they show up. Then when I built my new camp I used that as the guide.   
---
Getting stuck when you go to check what someone is selling is bad but it is also frustrating when you go there and there are no vending machines visible and you spend 5 minutes trying to find them. It's to the point now that if there isn't anything to show me the way and I don't see the machines quickly, I just leave. Today there was one that had no visible vending machines and the one door into the building was locked.
---
This one time. There was this guy who was super friendly and started to chat with me. Asked for some directions, which I provided and went on his way. A few seconds later I realised he had pickpocketted me. Ofcourse I went to report the crime but not him because he was so friendly.
---
Okay.
---
Go. A-way.
---
Phones use mobile date (radio effectively) from the local tower not from the internet router, unless you have some non standard system. Sounds like your internet is at fault, obvioulsly reboot the router and try Port forwarding FO76 if the router has such settings.
---
Plans + disease cures! And food items for the tadpole cooking badge if they are available!
---
Bethesda:  It‚Äôs not me, it‚Äôs you.
---
Lmao
---
What platform? Have you found it or replaced it yet?
---
I've had stuff disappear too, it's all been rare cosmetic items for me though. Items that I got legitimately, through events or world spawns or vendors, so I know it's not because they were duped.
---
Bring it up with the mods there, don‚Äôt bitch about it here, it shits up the place more than it already is
---
Oh, well damn is there anything they can do then? What about banning their system instead?
---
Well I've already done both now so, too late. I'm leaving this up here
---
Yeah I have a tse gatling, but it doesn‚Äôt shred like the tse 50 cal does. I‚Äôll definitely look into getting a bloodied super Sledge though, thanks!
---
Yah I‚Äôll try that I guess thanks for the help
---
How about it being reduced cost?
---
I'm the opposite, this week I stood watch over a bag dropped by a complete stranger who died twice right in front of me for some reason.  But I think it's all about how one plays the game. Much like the old "reputation" scale in previous FO's, only this time the scale is your own conscience....
---
It's a dangerous world out there and it only takes one or two mistakes to teach lessons.
---
Who cares about survival mode?
---
Purged from the Enclave?  Son, I AM the Enclave. Welcome to America, Lunch.
---
Use radaway, it makes you more diseaseable, it took me a while also but that seemed to help
---
Well it looks like Fred is yelling with you.
---
Ya that's much different than my situation. These guy didn't steal from me directly. They duped and shared with me. Then politely asked me not to tell anyone about the dupe and not to flood the market.
---
Was it after the hot fix
---
I love reading about fallout rp and what people come up with.
---
Great name, very apt.
---
Ugh, and then a diseased wolf spawns, literally one shots my hatchling, and gives me a disease...
---
When you log off and back on sometimes it kicks the items out of the vending machine and stores them in your stash. Has happened to me several times since patch.
---
Yeah it was late last night
---
Go look up shadow banning then realize that you did or said something stupid enough for the mods to decide to hide all your stuff unless they approve it.
---
Also Doing THIS right here is likely gonna catch you another shadow ban from this sub if your not careful this is so off topic its not funny. You take up issues with the mods via polite modmail (correct me if I'm wrong) not by doing it in public and arguing against the rules.
---
Take your months ban as a lesson don't do THIS as you are now likely to end up with another one if you are not careful.
---
Silver for neighbor‚Äôs dog interrupting the narration. Will definitely visit shop!
---
Pc?
---
Thx guess I'll just keep trucking along
---
I have been. :(
---
I know right. Not worth it for aid and +20% xp
---
They've already nerfed the repair perks before the kits were released
---
Yeah from what I can tell the drop rate for the badges suck.
---
How do you counter in pvp? Also sentinel builds?
---
Also the caps
---
Doh, yes
---
Adding you now. Lol
---
Ive done probably 15 without getting a badge
---
Fair reasoning. It just happens to be a real-world term.
---
The Atom shop is not on the game servers I'd imagine, the game pulls a feed from the Atom Shop server. Same but different.
---
I can give you 500 caps for it.
---
Dupers steal from us all. They ruin the game balance thus the experience for us all. Just to satisfy their pathological desire to see numbers accumulate.
---
"Take it as a lesson" so basically don't use the market ever, since just about everything that's sold there is duped. Okay cool got it ‚úåüèª already sent the mods over there a thing, cause this is incredibly stupid. I didn't say anything that would warrant a ban like this, all I did was post that I was looking for one and had caps for it, then posted that I was selling two asylum uniforms, and someone hit me up. Sold one to me, and that was that. Nothing was said that would warrant a random ban like this
---
There was a post yesterday saying that bought magazines did not count toward world challenges . I fear that the wing would be the same way.
---
Do acid. Please please please please
---
Ok that explains my lvl 45 Raider PA. I just could't understand how i got it.
---
But no armor penetration magazine
---
This guy gets ut
---
Thats bad
---
Oh really? What if I drop it somewhere? Or does it have to be looted from a body?
---
I'd use the hell out of these if they were an option.  For interior spaces as much as exterior thresholds (if not more).
---
In the hut at the substation north of Watoga, on a board.
---
Being thirsty and hungry helps too.
---
This is how I drip every nuke I've done on the queen and I've never had an issue with her flying out. The biggest issue is her getting stuck at 75% health and not taking any damage
---
What doesn't kill you tastes delicious!
---
I wasn't making a 1 to 1 comparison. Just an example of a bad man inconveniencing a normal person by exploiting the incompetence of a service they both use. It works.
---
This is the best thing
---
Clean water is pretty much camped on.  That said, Toxic Valley usually has a bunch of unoccupied lakefront.  Not sure how much of it is buildable though.
---
There is a reason why the lever action is thought after by endgame players and the hunting rifle is not. I have both in Bloodied explosive both oneshot anything thats not a scorchbeast or tougher but the dps difference is just crazy the lever actions dishes out much more damage than the Hunting rifle over 3 seconds. The two can‚Äôt even be compared the lever is vastly superior to the hunting rifle
---
On Xbox. I have not found it yet. I would flip shit if I lost my Travelers Leather Coat. With how glitched the Mores Dailies were. That was the real challenge.
---
Tell you what, (seeing the other post about sold items not working), I‚Äôll give it to you free, by dropping it -
---
IF you pay it forward and do that for the next person..?
---
Kill robots and take all their junk
---
Yes. I've been doing it constantly and that's what I get most of the time now.
---
I got the 50 kills in Morgantown in like 10 minutes
---
Last week I got TWO two-shot weapons, a lever action and a MG42 so they all don't come from dupers btw
---
The thing is, since a lot of them are making REAL money, they wont stop.
---
Seriously, a lot of people wonder why doing is even done in a game like this, but you can go to Ebay right now and see proof why they do it. Absolutely a shame
---
It was in 76 for at least half the BETA, I still had mine for a week or so after release but I scrapped it not realizing they had been taken away.
---
Dang. That does suck! I did not know this was such a problem. It is even worse because of the extremely low RNG.
---
Happened to me twice yesterday
---
Aside from the three spots already mentioned, there's an acid/fertilizer/water spot to the east of Grafton, a copper/gold spot north of Watoga, and a double wood spot near Gilman Lumber. It's thanks to the new and improved resource deposit map that I could find the double wood spot. Thanks again for that! Any chance you could make a flowering plants map? The blackberries really do hide stuff...
---
I have actually noticed that fewer nukes have been launched in recent days. Seems just yesterday that every play session I heard the automated warning system at least twice, but for now, the silos seem more dormant than before. I'd like to say that perhaps this cease-fire of our nuclear weapons will last, but we all know (Ron Pearlman voice) War.....war never changes....
---
I'm not sure how you can.  Sheepsquatch kills off the Brahmin pretty handily if you are by yourself - god forbid 2 of them spawn.
---
Inflation has gone down since the patch.
---
But there are still a few people selling crappy 1 star legendaries for 1000 caps.
---
Totally worth it. Nearly 600 hours in and I‚Äôve still not run out things to do, or fun to have.
---
I was secretly hoping for the ending to be about canvas bags to expand storage space.
---
I thought I read somewhere that the personal computer was going to log who purchased what at your vending machine. But I have yet to see it, I hope they expand the usage for that thing...as of now it's relatively useless.
---
Lol, I've tried this
---
I think they are worried about players setting traps.  Because that's what some people like to do.
---
We need to be able to give Yelp reviews on camps.  " 1 star, customer service non existent, placed me in a deathtrap upon showing up.  Would not recommend."
---
Built mine on the side of a cliff.  People were spawning in mid air, falling and breaking their legs.
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross.
---
Sent an invite, but had to log. I'll be back on in fifteen or so!
---
like 10 people ask this every day here lol. Its great, yes of course it is, especially now!
---
This explains why I'm getting a legendary next to my camp everytime I log in.
---
I routinely get the requirements mixed up from previous days.  Today, I made the mistake of being in PA instead of Responder gear (which I was also wearing).
---
Pick up every microscope and biometric scanner you find....that's the main source I've found.
---
Yeah that is what I call the "Red Rocket" mutation
---
New Red Rocket location?
---
If you give it to me and it works I can give it another person that needs it.
---
More like a spit, bud!
---
&gt; There is a reason why the lever action is thought after by endgame players and the hunting rifle is not.
---
Probably because .50 receiver sucked. Maybe Hunting rifle with right mods can be good too now, will see
---
Sounds like a plan. Add me (IGN same as here), be online in about 10 mins.
---
Try server hopping and avoid getting any diseases prior to the woopsies.
---
I‚Äôve done sometimes 4 in a day but only receive one badge per day.
---
You couldn't find a post? 
---
You....couldn't find a post?
---
YOU COULDN'T FIND A POOOSTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT???????????????
---
Well that gunsmith issue would still be a thing with this proposal. The durability effect would need it actively equipped not passively.
---
you should take the part out about not liking 76, its a bit of a contradiction.
---
Is that why the servers seem flakier than social media 'influencers' this morning? For the better part of 90 minutes I was getting dumped every time I tried to access either my stash or my vendors. Stupid long lag (on the order of up to a minute per item) trying to transfer any items from one to the other.
---
Ok, added you :)
---
How do we know if we have duped items? I‚Äôve traded for items on here as well as purchased from vending machines and vendors? If it‚Äôs duped does it just disappear? Sorry this is all new to me.
---
This was fuckin awesome.
---
Xb1 sorry
---
**P R O F L I G A T E**
---
Cool thanks.
---
Mine has been trading, in-game and on reddit, now level 90 with lots of caps, a selection of tse's and my assassin sentinel armour.  Just been on a huge treasure hunt (did about 750 maps) and now picking off the scout stuff. Have to make fun where you find it.
---
But in both cases some asshole is directly taking something, which duping isn't. Someone duping a bucket of ketchup doesn't mean that there isn't then ketchup for other people to just get at the same convenience. The bank will still have just as much money for everyone else. 
---
It's exploiting the game, and it's on Bethesda to fix.
---
C.A.M.P.? *Trivago*.
---
One time it crashed and a stealth boy was right in front of me
---
Looks about right, very  interesting and accurate. I'm very curious on the next step in the story / whats up with nuclear winter, but I didn't even finish the main story yet so I'm not sure I want to spoil myself of anything
---
falloutbuilds.com
---
It‚Äôs definitely better than before but the damage isnt the problem here its fire rate. With a bloodied build both rifles can oneshot anything in the game except scorchbeasts and sheepsquatches.
---
Now that we know that they are equal against all enemies if we test the against a sheepsquatch or a scorchbeast the lever action will win the dps race simply because it fires much much faster and reloads faster than a hunting rifle hence why i‚Äôm trying to explain to you why its vastly superior
---
Another great idea is having two different perk types. Crafting and utility (hacker, etc), and Combat. Both working like they do now, but active at the same time.
---
So, you could still only equip certain crafting ones at a time (couldn't have two five costs active with only 5 of the respective stat for instance)
---
Fun detail: on the shoulder pads and on the side of the helmet is a red BOS logo.
---
True or at least i think this is true enough.
---
The wasteland now has at minimum 20 badasses launching nukes and hosing down everywhere with over the top guns. We are playing something closer to Borderlands but with a fallout paint job. 
---
Fallout was at one point the premiere CRPG experience(some still think it is and they might not be wrong) it also allowed you non-violent options and gave you so so many ways of going about things your accomplishments were not just numbers they changed things the in-world sometimes for the better sometimes for the worst normally both at the same time if you are doing it right.
---
It really does not help with all the atom store garbage being pushed as well your accomplishments here are daily tasks you trade for shinies that otherwise, they want to charge you 15-ish dollars a pop for at the worst.
---
Nothing changes even nuking the world the thing that got us in the whole fallout mess does nothing long term just slightly harder mobs and more of them let alone you are nuking one the last standing buildings in the wasteland and not a window breaks. 
---
It feels hollow and empty
---
Wow that's crazy!
---
Wait really?  Does that apply to the Drill/Chainsaw/etc. too?
---
I‚Äôm selling em out my shop for 2 caps a pop
---
Yea that is a good place too. But reason i chose capitol building was because once you enter it and walk a little toward the corridors every ghoul in the building will run at you. Making it easy to kill them without running around looking for them. Also i find that Morgantown in more open place and more than likely to have most of the mobs already dead.
---
Not sure, really. I know console bans have to come through Microsoft &amp; Sony, which I‚Äôm not sure how strictly they enforce their TOS. And the alleged cheaters would probably have to rack up a decent number of complaints that are determined to be legitimate before the ban hammer flies.
---
He talks about how "the white fluff is bad"
---
Do you like cheese?
---
Are you holding a stick?
---
Buy from station vendors or white springs. I purchase difficult to find junk as farming it sometimes seems impossible.
---
Rather than kick after 60 how about the sentry bot mini nuke explosion ramping up at 60...then boom!  Temporarily vacate the station when you hear the sound, come back with a mop 'n bucket..
---
I agree that they ruin the balance and experience for us all. Though, they don't just do it to see numbers accumulate, they do it to be superior. Being stronger and richer than everyone else in the game is a common desire in all mmos. 
---
I did pick up on the sarcasm and I understood your point. I thought I made it clear in my response. My response was an attempt to make the point that your analogy wasn't completely accurate.
---
Tbh, no.
---
I honestly didnt even expect to get the kills as fast as I did. I didnt even make it a quarter of the way around the town .
---
Well, at least with comparing dupers to inmates you are somewhat right.
---
Ok. I‚Äôll be on in 5
---
Honestly this game has come a long way from where it was at launch. . . I've stuck with it since the beginning and I can honestly say yes it is. There are so many things to do. Like the person above said I haven't ran out of things to do and so many new things that are coming out. Also, the games stability, it still needs work but, but it's been vastly improved. There are minor frame drops but nothing compared to before. I have yet to have my game crash since the newest patch was released. I'm still finding places I haven't discovered and I'm Lvl 150 lol. So yes I would say this game is definitely worth it! ^_^ hope I was helpfull and hope to see you out on the wasteland!
---
Added you on xbox looking forward to checking out the store.
---
SO - I was looking for Uranium Veins in the World and was checking them out via the Map. Upon arrival I can say there is nothing there.
---
Uranium Veins exist in Workshops but didnt found any via this map / any help?
---
Perks would be pretty well the same as Bloodied, just no Nerd Rage or Radicool. Armor is your choice I suppose, although Unyeilding is still useful even when your not running around at low health all the time. Vanguard can make you quite tanky, Bolstering is another alright option.
---

---
Can‚Äôt see the posts, Can ya Russ?
---
Some speculation that wearing the uniform increases drop rates, but from past experience, I doubt it.
---
So did you tested Lvr action and hunting with all magazines against sheepsquatch, (in current patch) or it's just your thoughts?
---
Yeah I keep my meds at about 50% off cause I know people need those in a pinch sometimes. Depending on the rarity of plans I can increase them by a small amount or keep them half off too if they‚Äôre common plans.
---
Not really, I don't necessarily like fallout 76, I play it anyways
---
Yup. I have two level 135 characters. My gamer friends are similar. My casual buddy is just reaching 50 now. Reddit often becomes a gamer echo chamber.
---
 Are we already there?
---
For those who still need this, I'm on Xbox right now and looking to get this done.  Will be on for a few hours (4-5) for anyone who needs it (provided I'm not mid fire fight, obviously \*grins\*).  Just hit up 'Saitaina'.
---
Ok, shall I drop it or put it in a loot container?
---
Yeah, but it was kinda messed up. Sounds like the guy was downed the other guy ran up and waited for him to bleed out. It's a shitty feeling but part of the game.
---
Dude... the hunting rifle does like 70 damage more than a lever and it takes 3 seconds to shoot... a lever shoots 3 times when the hunting rifle shoots only once the dps isnt even comparable
---
Lol.  If it's working it's probably a bug which will get nerfed eventually.  If not working....intended by design :D
---
Maybe Bethesda ignores if you throw the item away? In the case of getting "caught" you'd have a very strong defense I guess.
---
Melee builds are where the fun is at.  :P Get yourself a furious tambo and max out your melee perks.  Go Wolverine! ;)
---
No, I can‚Äôt find a post and i‚Äôve looked through several pages of new threads, is that okay?
---
PS4!
---
Oh heck yeah! Friending right now!
---
Thanks Fred. You have always been the best.
---
Roses quests are a nightmare already
---
Put it in a loot container.
---
Nah I'm good.  I already know my camp is shit without other players telling me
---
Thank you for the non sarcastic comment :) as long as the main issues have been ironed out that‚Äôs good enough for me as this is definitely the sort of game i would normally enjoy but immersion is a huge thing for me
---
Ran melee for awhile before going back to rifles and have a second character in the works for melee, this is just gonna be a rifle build so I can avoid swapping loads of points again
---
Ahh... this is really about  the age old (not really, it‚Äôs a newish phenomenon) of social online vs solo.   Unfortunately, limits and  boundaries have to be set in the public space.   
---
People can argue all they want, but this is the crux of the real reason folks don‚Äôt like 76: they can‚Äôt do whatever they want whenever they want to whomever they want, including modding the hell out of it.
---
  Kinda like real life.  
---
Peace.
---
Exactly! üòÉüòÇ
---
I‚Äôve seen people selling bobble heads for 100c, does that actually sell?
---
Pssst... There's a search function
---
Stop this
---
Excavator with shocks is indeed 200lbs, and +1str is 5lbs.
---
Well done! üëç
---
I‚Äôd probably opt to put them closer to 25-50c/ea, but that‚Äôs just me.
---
What can we do ? Dirtbags just love taking paper bags ,...
---
I did the same thing shortly before the ability to respec.  I was a shotgunner, and made a smooth transition into heavy guns. Since they‚Äôre both tied to strength, you can easily start collecting HG perks. You can max your strength to 15 once you sacrifice any shotgun perks from Perception and Agility
---
I almost glitched so badly I almost fell into the void beneath the map. Luckily it spawn me back on top but, needless to say, I had to put on a new pair of undies that day. Nearly pissed my pants in fear I would lose all my junk under the map lol
---
[I could find some with the map. I suppose the veins are very easy to miss](https://i.imgur.com/dOO1Ybx.jpg)
---
You sure you're at the right spot? It's the big pool and a sign that says wavy waves on the wall. I can jump over there and get a screen.
---
Exactly. My camp consisted of a dozen foundation pieces and after one patch declared the area I lived as a no-go build zone, I was unable to place my packed up home anywhere. I made a tiny stair platform with a bench and stash box while I decided how to rebuild my camp.
---
Meanwhile, a random player I met at Fasnacht invited me to team and built me a two story house from that platform. I've cluttered the inside, added on a deck, even moved the whole house to a different location. I'm keeping it in the sky because it works, my benches and generator are safer from enemies and that's how Zero made it.
---
If they do it where OP placed circle,  they can start at the forward station.  The SBQ will even land next to it out of the nuke zone so everyone benefits
---
Or attaches to a wall on the second floor if you place on the first.
---
Same, that‚Äôs where I am at. I‚Äôd rather sell my stuff and have some extra space afterwards than try to squeeze out some extra caps. Caps were never hard to get.
---
AA weapon and headshot crits. Sentinel won't save you from a crit head, especially when at low health. 
---
My fave pvp weapon is a AA fire rate auto handmade. Before they know it I have put 8 bullets in their head and 2 of them were crits.
---
It would be cool if they could add bar swing doors. Then they wouldn't have to interact with a door. They can just go through it and it would close.
---
With the base backpack at max level, it gives you 60 extra carry weight, with the high capacity mod let's you carry 120 extra
---
Seriously, im always so disappointed when I travel to camps to shop and get locked inside. They could try to implement the welcome mats to be spawn points but I fear that would also allow people to spawn you in nefarious locations as well. Perhaps figure out a way to make locks bypass from the inside (seems like this would be a coding nightmare tho)
---
What kind of plants would that be? If you give me a list, Mappalachia can spit you out a map
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/
---
It's the 8th post on the front page of this subreddit. WTH dude?
---
Nice. Quite the boost
---
Yeah etc is with people selling ammo 2 caps each it‚Äôs insane
---
I just go with what I would be prepared to pay. If it doesn't sell I lower the price, if it sells fast I raise it.
---
Different people do it their way...
---
i can‚Äôt notice it
---
Yes I got caught out this morning when I bought more Nuka Cola than I intended. Still, all the more to craft grenades with!
---
I carry 450 without PA and just a 60lb backpack.
---
He‚Äôs talking about how only one person can use a vendor at a time, not what Mole Momma is selling
---
I intend to do all junk at once when I do. As for acid - as a personal recommendation - head to "Toxic Larry's Meat n Go" and just server hop there. It always spawns 3 snallygasters
---
BE gives better ammo/dps ratio than the FFR, especially if your using utracite ammo. The trade off would spending 5 points for Demolition to get the higher dmg.
---
bars indicate signal strength.
---
simply put, your WiFi signal sucks.
---
Go stealth commando. It's easy to transition a rifleman build into it and it's really fun to use.
---
I‚Äôm a rifle build not shotgun, was a sniper/shotgun build before my melee
---
Wow you are awesome thank you!
---
Didn‚Äôt work?
---
I thought I just didn't remember getting it, or that it was part of one of the bundles I got that somehow I'd missed before...
---
Of course! (: I was so bummed but not surprised when it first came out as I am a big post apocalyptic/survival fan. I had been looking for months for a survival/ post apocalyptic game on Xbox that my friend and I could play. Once this came out I jumped all over it. In short, I hated how it launched but I'm happy where it's going. 
---
I know the game crashed for my friend yesterday (we're on Xbox btw) which was his first time in about a week and a half I'd say? So there's still some issues that need to be fine tuned but it's almost there!
---
No it didn't :(
---
You sir are a hero for these videos
---
I see no reason why you don't get TPed to the C.A.M.P. item. It's quite clear to me it should be the spawn point.
---
Ah balls
---
I really wanted to do that during the "You better believe it"
---
My apologies, i only checked new posts as i didn‚Äôt even cross my mind this topic would get upvoted. ..
---
Yea more my style, just not sure what rifle/armour to buy, aae fe? A combo of chameleon/vanguard sentinel armour?
---
That's kind of funny the more I think about it.
---
Let me introduce you to the most annoying animal in the world 
---
*...the mole rat*
---
I built this way because it's the most secure style of house for pve and pvp. (Pvp home security on a survival server is still a joke, but it's the thought that counts.)
---
Mine actually has overhangs around the house and traps in the stair entry way. Makes it even harder to get in.
---
Ugh definitely noticeable on any thing super mutants or bigger.
---
Adds more risk to survival mode lol
---
Yeah I get your point and I prefer the old school as well. However you‚Äôre totally wrong or insane if you think that Fallout 76 is giving you all the necessary information to complete every quest without markers. 
---
Tell me, how do you use your brain to find the solution to ‚ÄúFind a place where to put technical data?‚Äù That‚Äôs all the info the game is giving you. Do you explore the entire Appalachia until you find the right box? 
---
Or quests like: ‚ÄúInvestigate Watoga‚Äù
---
I have mine at 50 caps. Have not sold one. People either don't want them or 50 caps is way too high a price.
---
You checked the first 5 posts on /new and decided to create your own? That thread was made 18 hours ago, it's obviously you didn't bother to search a bit or go through a few pages on /new.
---
Uncanny
---
Nice job!!
---
Only ammo I carry I charge more than 1 are the grenades for the grenade launcher. And that's cause I figure they do a lot more damage per grenade and you tend not to use that like a regular gun where you go through ammo quicker.
---
awe him needs a huggle 
---
kill it, kill it with fire!!!!!
---
I got a Fully modded TSE lvl 50 combar shotgun
---
For Me? Literally useless. Now I can even shoot right under my feet and I survive. 20+ bullets for a mirelurk queen and 3 for a Scorched Conquenor 
---
Totally useless in PvP (I am lvl 130 with all shotgunner perks + lvl 5 demolition expert) and lvl ordinary Gauss Rifle seems to do more damage 
---
Tried to sell mine but no offers came up
---
Thanks I'll try there. I got every hat to spawn but the hood at the other location.
---
The red rocket south of harper's ferry should have a bundle of 2 fiber optics on the tool bench (next to your stash, in the building that's not a big store). Also, fog crawlers drop a bunch of fiber optics. They are pretty rare but you should be able to find them either around tanagra town or in the dolly sods campground
---
Its sucks so bad im pissed actually but whatever I guess its ranged and mele from now on.
---
Sir. I‚Äôm gonna need you to not be on my camp location. Thank you. (Just kidding, but I saw that on the market Reddit forums. Very creative.)
---
Ad Victorium
---
I can agree with that
---
üéµ **EX MACHINA**
---
I already was on the .50 cal because crafting the ammo seemed more efficient than the .308. But... after the update, I'd have changed to it for the damage increase as well. But as it is, it was a nice bonus for me.
---
What system you on? Lol I‚Äôll buy my ammo from you
---
I've been renaming the legendary stuff I lost with the perks they have :)
---
Thanks for the (fast!) reply.
---
I found some aswell. I expected them to look like greenish pits - like how they are in the workshops. But they look really much like normal stones. Hard to miss indeed.
---
Thanks btw for these maps was one of the first things I was looking in the early weeks of the Game. Real MVP
---
I can confirm that dead works.  On PC, at least.  They just can't be meatpiles.  Of all the herpetologist pics I took, only a few were alive. If only the frog habitat component wasn't bugged, I'd be done with that one!  
---
Between the badge and atom point challenges, I've been spamming camera clicks after every encounter.  Finally finished the 80 point one and the bog weekly thanks to a trio of prime nukes last night.
---
Is there a glossary of terms used here?  I have absolutely no idea what "dupers" means and half the other terms you people use here.
---
So many impossible or near impossible requirements for badges. Usually just 1 per badge too.
---
1. How much does deep-pocketed give per piece of armor? 10lb
---
2. How much does deep-pocketed give for a backpack? Haven't played with one yet. Probably 10lbs.
---
3. Excavator with calibrated shocks give 200 eh? 100 xtra over your strength boost.
---
4. How much does +1 Str give for carrying weight? 5lbs
---
I head you can find deathclaw hide in scorchbeast guano piles.
---
That's because the majority of the article is just quotes from role players.
---
You love it stop lying lol
---
Im not 100% how stealth works for PVP honestly.
---
I know if you crouch, players cant see your name tag above your head, so i guess they can just see your character crouching there, without a stealth field active
---
So what is the best right now?
---
If this is true you're a god.  At the very minimum at least you got me to dig through shit piles this evening.
---
I‚Äôve sold some @ around 20 caps. Some people seek them out, but since they are found in the world and only temporary, I think it‚Äôs fair to not expect a lot of caps.
---
Seriously this is like the 5th post on the "hot" list
---
Read it all your questions will be answered
---
Funny, my .50 now is doing more damage than it did when it was a .308 hardened (to be fair that was before the update that I had it set to that). Before the update if I remember right the difference was only 1 damage point (which is why I decided that the fact it seemed more efficient to craft .50 was worth the loss of 1 damage point).
---
That's gonna be abused af
---
I‚Äôm not sure I understand your post properly, but if you‚Äôre saying that you‚Äôre renaming a bloodied explosive sub machine gun for example to ‚ÄúBE Sub‚Äù, people won‚Äôt see that, the rename is only visible to you.
---
Nope. But I am hoping that raincoat comes out soon.
---
Excellent this is a welcome addition there are a few recipes and they seem to take 2 or 3 boxes a pop.  Please continue to do the fantastic work. 
---
You are the glowing example of why 76 continues to grow instead of folding, great community members and fans.
---
Only you can see the different names you put on your stuff.
---
You can still use your Unyeilding with it, just run at full health and it'll help keep you alive in crowd control situations. If not, then yeah Vanguard is a good option. I have a Furious handmade for mine, it's got damage while aiming and VATS meter and does good by me. When I do run it glass cannon a 1* bloodied pipe rifle is a surprising strong weapon. I also have an automatic laser rifle that I break out for fun sometimes.
---
You can only inspect the weapons and armor when the camp owner is there
---
That's hot
---
I used to always have names for my camps/stores written out in neon letters. However, they eat into the budget severely so I‚Äôve quit doing that. It does add a lot of personality though so it‚Äôs a great suggestion for those not near max budget
---
Isn't that an animation problem? Even in FO4 it wasn't possible to craft while in PA.
---
If the vendor who owns the camp is nearby, you can inspect. It‚Äôs a silly bug that Bethesda should have caught before player vending was released and they didn‚Äôt bother to fix it during the maintenance. In the meantime, if you want  to know if a weapon has the explosive effect, compare the damage with demo expert on and off. Compare fire rates with a same level normal variant to check if it has FFR. Etc.
---
Yep. The game was alright really, but not a good fallout. The presence of a voiced protagonist (damn it Bethesda, I want to play a *real* RPG in first-person narrative) along with the constant GIVE ME BACK MY SON stuff, I just couldn't immerse in it. Nick Valentine was a fantastic character though (I'm a sucker for anything remotely Noir).
---
10lbs even on the chest? I know fo4 it gave more than the limbs.
---
Who gave you the silver!  I want names!
---
I mean, sure it works, but there are more effective ways to pve. mainly PA.
---
Those harpers ferry ones have some serious AP too ...
---
it's crazy how much people on reddit love to complain about nothing because they have nothing better to do. Yes I did look through several pages on new thank you.
---
Yeah in my belly!
---
3 unconnected would be the best.
---
PS4 but I don't carry much selection cause it's mostly extra that I don't use (I can't keep up with enough ammo for the stuff I use to sell it. Otherwise I'd offer 5.56). And I stopped carrying the stuff that was easy to find as beginner's (like .38 or fusion cells) because it wasn't selling and after some thought realized why would anyone buy it when they can find it everywhere. So right now off the top of my head I have some shotgun ammo (which I'm also thinking of delisting and just throwing away), 5 mm, and maybe some other ones? (can't remember).
---
I‚Äôve got some decent damage with full unyielding and a BE Double but am truly a glass cannon now
---
So is it broken atm and can't be finished?
---
\**Excited noises\**
---
Sootflower (and Toxic), Rhododendron, Aster, Starlight Creeper, Carrot Flower, Fern, Bloodleaf, AshRose, Thistle, Ginseng, Pumpkin Vine, Melon Vine. This is all I could think of. 
---
Thanks to your maps I can just go out and find clusters of material to mine or gather. Which means my CAMP can be placed in more aesthetically pleasing locations instead of being strategic for the resources around it.
---
Well shit.  I've sold a couple for 1-200c since vendors came out.  Lol oops.
---
No
---
I did this too but it killed me. Thankfully I was able to retrieve my junk but since you cant respawn at someone elses camp and their camp was in the boonies i had to waste an extra 15 caps getting back to retrive my junk.
---
Vats overlay,  motion assist servos. Sometimes reactive or Tesla coils (have one character built on Tesla coils) ... torso piece not arms
---
and i do apologise for the distress me only viewing /new not /hot has caused you
---
It's called functionalism in architectural terms. It works for the player. To each his/her own. Depends on your goal. I could go on...
---
By the minority though, surely.  What isn't abused by those who are inclined to do so?
---
Power armors are always hot~
---
Fireproof, my friend. 
---
Enjoy your new life.
---
I completed a task only for it to show that I didn't even start it?????
---
Yeah. But some dumbass would call theirs pu55yd3str0y3r.
---
Yeah, seems to do literally nothing now...
---
Maybe put it back to 200% damage instead of 120%?
---
Genius!
---
True but 20 caps seems not enough to justify them taking up space in my stash and a slot on my vending machine.
---
You could also p.m. through whatever platform you use the name of the vendor and ask about the weapon if the player is not on site.
---
Well save 308 and 5.56 extra and 45 if you want I‚Äôll buy them at 1 cap each but yeah I‚Äôm on PS4 my handle is Walking_Contra always nice to find a decent price trader üòÇ
---
Interesting observation...I'll check it out...would be nice.
---
This looks like it could be a cover to a hardcore album
---
I know it seems funny but it took hundreds of hours (and a ton of luck) to grind for it and now it all seems not worth the effort
---
Fucking scary!
---
Bunch of psychopaths!
---
You need revive while YOU stand in water, not revive another player dead on water. If one dies in water you don't even get an option to revive them. They only get a spawn option.
---
Ha. At least you would know what your walking into.
---
Two shot makes the spread on shotguns gigantic. You might want to invest in full skeet shooter and attachments that improve hip fire. 
---
With the old bugged damage this probably wasn‚Äôt a big deal but now you‚Äôll definitely want to make each pellet count to maximize damage per shot. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt hold my breath for a buff. Just gotta adapt and do whatever you can to maximize your weapon‚Äôs efficiency
---
Sorry, you just listed every ammo I use myself ;) (I have a sniper build). And in general I tend to run out of those enough I don't want to sell them (and I don't grind enough for lead and metal to make extra to sell to other people).
---
Oh yeah, that'll work for me.
---
What's fire resistance supposed to protect me against?
---
Yeah it works both ways i guess......i spent litteraly days apon days hunting BoS plans. Now that i have them, i can buy them for 200 caps...ugh
---
At the time, like u said, i was also grinding for a BoS jumpsuit forever and never got one. Untill i bought it from a vender box for a few caps the other day. Not quite as rewarding, but i got and im gonna wear it, dam it!
---
Que r/fallout
---
Thanks for the tip! I was scared of the "reduced range" but maybe it will help a bit
---
Title should say duping, not filing lol. Sorry
---
I try to keep mine at 50% whatever the train station vendor sells them for. Sometimes it's better to go less to move the stuff out of my inventory.
---
Bugs, bugs, more bugs.  I can sometimes fast travel to player venders only to be frozen in a wall where I have to fast travel somewhere else. Other times I've made a purchase to find it's not in my inventory!!!  Frustrating is not a word I'm thinking right now.
---
It's a momentary period of prosperity and good will, but as the average Appalachian grows stronger and is allowed to arm up better against the wilds, many might take that newfound emboldened sense of courage and decide to further test their fates against each other.
---
Do you AFK/hang out there?  If not, it's probably because they can't inspect.
---
Yes a daily quest from Rose would be great. Her voice actor sounds just like my ex girlfriend. It can get quite annoying but still fun.
---
It's cooler to fix the bugs associated with this new patch.....forget naming
---
Lol I understand but haggling makes it fun!
---
Is that what it is? Was wondering why inspect worked sometimes
---
Go to one of the houses at the peak. There's a bath on the top floor, one of them with a jug of mountain honey inside. The Royal Jelly should be beside the mountain honey.
---
many thanks for the reply, please do, i'm completely baffled. Also, it might be placebo, but i think im doing more dmg than before.
---
Welcome to the world of not using glitches/bugs/unintended damages to one shot everything.
---
Yep! They have to be near by to be able to inspect their weapons and armor. It's odd, but yeah that's how it works
---
Fire AND explosive. 
---
Screech is considered explosive damage and at level 3 the scorchbeast can really only do anything in Melee range and at that point is has less potency than a Yao guai and you should be able to annihilate it relatively easily.
---
Very helpful
---
Can you only get serum recipes from MODUS now?  I heard you could get them out of treasure maps but haven‚Äôt confirmed
---
Ok, thanks, so you saying you are going to die on the waters edge? Haha
---
Cool beans
---
Yep they hurt and packs a really serious punch although missile turrets are scarier
---
I concur with this
---
Its only unintended because they decided so in the last patch.
---
Who gave you names? I want silver!
---
No and No. 
---
No it's not the only way you can still use junk at a bench 
---
No they're not only available in the atom store there's 2 kinds, the basic ones yes but improved kits you get 2 or 3, every time you kill the queen.
---
Today someone msg me asking for refund because they bought 15 bos armor plans. I did refund
---
You can buy a regular repair kit in the atom shop, at 50 a piece. They're not worth it imo, but you can also get improved repair kits from sbq. 
---
In the workshops, there is a repair/inspect button, through that you can normally repair an item. The kits are mainly just used for on the run repairing.
---
lol more like Fred the Pharrell Ghoul with that hat
---
They until recently they dropped from the SBQ but don't anymore. If it's a bug or a nerf idk.
---
It depends on the player market.  Most people will want a profit, so they will need to sell at a rate that taking the 10% tax into account, would make them more caps than selling to a vendor.  There needs to be a agreed upon, general price range for certain things though, sort of like the 200-300 caps for serums.  Obviously, nobody is going to pay more than they think is worth it for something, so selling radawy for 60 caps each(something I've seen already) isn't going to sell.  However, selling stuff for dirt cheap, tends to result in a few people buying everything for personal use or to resell for a profit.
---
Buying low and reselling high, is an effective strategy in other games, but those games don't have a cap on the amount of money you can have and usually have better drop rates for the items as well as a better use for them.
---
As long as you didn't dupe them you're good.
---
I must be blind I can't see the option for fixing via the use of junk...
---
Nick is definitely the best part of that game for me. I didn‚Äôt like the destruction of the roleplay element either, or the focus on busywork that ultimately would get you nowhere, or really even the main storyline. The idea of synths and the institute is interesting, but the way they tied it in with the son  that I couldn‚Äôt care less about just killed it.
---
**A V E**
---
Don't understand why other people worry about how other people build their places
---
I‚Äôm believe that was intentional. But don‚Äôt know where to find them now and would prefer not to spend all the caps at the enclave if I don‚Äôt need to
---
That will look pretty messy all on one map I think, but gimme 2 mins
---
let's see how you feel when your prized legendary gets deleted for no apparent reason
---
Everyone already runs around with mutations, and players have been selling them for 200 caps for months.
---
Damn Bethesda hates fun.
---
Herd Mentality doesn't show up for me unless I'm in a team. Solo it's hidden and not affected by Class Freak R3 at all. I've only had it on XB1 though so could be bugged different.
---
Also - NAR is a good spot to hunt the Sheepsquatch, usually find one there fighting muties or scorched maybe 1 in 4 tries
---
The real issue is that the spawn point is not the same for the owner and the visitor.
---
The visitor spawn at the center of the build zone (where you first isntalled the C.A.M.P point
---
The owner spawn at a small distance from is current C.A.M.P position.
---
I slightly restructured my base for this to work
---
&gt;Welcome to the world of using **melee** to one shot everything.
---
you made a tiny mistake but I fixed it for you. all good.
---
It's kind of changed in so far as it is just a different button sequence and they added the option to use/purchase a kit at the bench. Now you go into modify/repair then inspect/repair and select workbench repair (on xbox press X or the relevant one on ps4/pc).
---
As to the kits, you can get improved kits from the scorchbeast queen event. 
---
However they really arent needed if you are careful with weapon/armour management and it is better to just workbench repair anyway as you can repair to 200pc with perks rather than the 100/150 PC a kit gives.
---
It's only some vendors not all of them if u check others inventory you can preview the items
---
i'd love to see old dailies work. Can't remember when i got bog dailies last time
---
Oh ok good thx
---
Thanks very much for the tip dude!!!
---
It does not spoil! Thank Atom for that.
---
That's about as much of a definitive answer as anyone can give since it's based on each individuals opinion on whether or not they'll like this game.
---
Considering creating another character? Brand new build?
---
This comment makes it clearer now. Still friendlyness can not excuse their behaviour regardless of their motivation.
---
Only 75980 hours to go.
---
If they did, thank you Bethesda. Heavy weapons were hardly ‚Äòendgame‚Äô because of all the ‚Äòbalancing‚Äô, a buff is long overdue. Two-shot shouldn‚Äôt mean 1.2 shot. 
---
Especially in pvp, if weapons are strong armors are relatively weak, there will be more fight and action. No magic armor garbage in CS and COD or Battlefield. If weapons are weak and armors are OP (like I can stand there like an idiot yet that makes me unkillable), people will simply stop playing it because it‚Äôs just frustrating and dumb.
---
bloodied for pve.
---
shotguns are still good but only for stealth. if you can get really close, stealth VATS crit shotguners are better than handmades even.
---
but yeah, no more getting on their faces in PA and just blowing things away. sadly.
---
u/KogeronControls recently posted a Spreadsheet, if you need.
---
You'll be fine just don't pick up random bags supposedly a few people have been banned picking up duped items like thousands of nuka colas.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ

[Here you are](https://i.imgur.com/o5ckvuE.jpg)

But now Shotgun does lower dps than all other weapons...
---
Every other tse was nerfed ages ago
---
Pumpkin House quest is fine, my home is behind the PH so I log in daily and see it. Pumpkins to complete are in the backyard so it takes seconds for me to complete. :)
---
The PVPers seem to be running junkies full health or vampires ffr lately.
---
It's a game and not a real item. I understand why you're upset but damn it could be worse.
---
Theres a post on here that has the answers too.
---
It is fun. You should buy it.
---
Triangle then Square if on ps4
---
The idea is to explain *why* the solution works and enable the reader to handle slight tweaks on the situation--for instance, suppose the tax was 7% instead of 10%. Just giving the simple instructions is the easy way, but I prefer the thorough way. :)
---
.
---
Using melee to one shot normal non-boss enemies is well justified if you take into account that they have to take way more damage by running to the mobs and getting hit by melee. Ranged can stand in one place (lets say roof of an building), in safety and kill them waaaayyyy faster (when there are more than one mob to kill, which is the case 90% of the time). I know since i have lv200 melee toon and lv200 ranged toon.
---
Let me just direct your attention to duping...
---
Not shotguns. Rifles or Melee.
---
If they are near the camp you can inspect.
---
What terms? "Dupe" is an abbreviation for "Duplication", 1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 4, 4 becomes 8 etc
---
not really? this is a looter-shooter. losing your *loot* for no reason other than server sync is literally the worse thing that could happen.
---
unless you're talking about real life, but that's a ludicrous comparison and doesn't even make sense.
---
You beat me to it.  Take my upvote üëç
---
5 points into Demolition is kind of a waste, it‚Äôs a perk card that gives diminished returns per level, kinda like the Rifleman/Commando perks that do increments of 5% per level at a start of 10%. Besides that the explosive legacy damage scales from the initial weapon damage is only like 15-20%(?) additive, meaning demolitions is only buffing a small source of damage.
---
I‚Äôm just just trying say that you only would want a level 2 Demolitions with a level 3 Bloody Mess or Tank Killer card instead.
---
It was enough for me to dump my shotgun perks and go melee.  I also got a 3* assualtron sword with faster swing, 90 weight, and furious.  So I am going to try one handed melee
---
I think you're right, it seems like my TSE lever gained 30+ damage, too.
---
I think they take up budget. But u can only place a certain amount
---
Dude, thank you! I shall erect a llama at my camp in your honor.
---
Also, it just occurred to me that there are static spawn locations for weapons in the world. Perhaps making a map of the more rare weapons would help people that are trying to break them down for mods.
---
I need both revives still. Want to link up? JRR-550
---
Thanks, I will be fixing my gear later now! Woohoo.
---
No just changing up my main character, I tried to start an alt but I just don‚Äôt feel the game is good to do the same thing twice in
---
I'm not sure if you've already tried this out, but seen as you're a fan of both Bethesda and Fallout 76, and you want to become a game programmer, have you tried using the Creation Kit for Fallout 4? It's the software Bethesda used to make the game, and it's free for anybody who owns a PC copy of the game. It will offer you an insight into what goes on behind the scenes and allow you to create your own stuff.
---
I bought an AAE shotgun a few months back and it's worse then the BB gun from FO3. No range the hit is worthless.
---
Except it's not fraud, it's not the customer that tells paypal to charge 1$, it's the company. It's like if someone gives 1$ to the cashier and says "I only want to pay this much" and the cashier says yes. Furthermore, they always have the option to cancel the sale before sending the items, so in my case, they say yes twice. It's called haggling.
---
Including the shotguns 
---
They got nerfed more than any other TSE
---
Who gave you wants?  I name silver!
---
I‚Äôm not into pvp, I think I just really want enough new content to play an entire weekend of new stuff
---
Welcome to West Virginia!
---
Seriously the entire state is like that in real life.  You have to carve flat spots out of a mountain to build.
---
OOOOO lead deposit. Where is this!? Sorry you will have to dumb it down for me lol
---
Aha! I'm honoured
---
There are, but I reckoned it's 10x easier to buy the plan and mass-craft them, idk. Weapons aren't something Mappalachia *knows* how to map yet, so I'd have to do some work to get the correct IDs of all the weapon spawns and such
---
I bet the testers of the game didn't leave the Forest.
---
I'm assuming that mine are destroyed but still taking up budget and I can't repair them so they're lost in the ether I guess
---
The instance hasn't refreshed, I think is the proper way to put it.
---
It just means somebody ran it before you, and the game hadn't fully restored the silos. I think out of the 10 or so times I've run them I've had to deal with turrets on only 3.
---
I did Point Pleasant, Wavy Willard‚Äôs, and Camden Park. Get up close and use VATS to shoot them in the head. Make sure you collect crossbow bolts from corpses because they‚Äôre expensive to craft. When you go to do the archery challenge I recommend taking at least 15 bolts because the hits don‚Äôt always register.
---
This sounds more like anthem then fallout but okay.
---
No... bug reports are for getting things patched. Spreading how to dupe is done self-servingly for various reasons (YouTube hits, notoriety in small unimportant groups, naively thinking it makes you cool, etc.).     
---
Just to head off your obvious follow-up: No. They don‚Äôt ignore it until it‚Äôs far past already being a problem. Dupers are not doing a service. Glitches take time to find, isolate, fix, test and release. The thing that makes it a problem is people spreading the glitches as fast as they can to get as much stuff duped before they fix it. They are not the solution. They are the problem.
---
I enjoy aspects of it, not the whole
---
Cool
---
Nope.  Bye bye üòò
---
Calibrated shocks? Plus I think if a backpack was on the back of power armor, it would rip the arm straps off when u get out
---
I can see how that would be a problem. It could be work through though, mostly. Like, you could only place a welcome mat on the center of a foundation block AND it has to be far enough from trap placement like tesla coils or vice versa. Now comes the next hard part, people using this have to know when they first come in, don't move and spend a moment to look around first. Now for the really hard part, Bethesda would have to code this in.
---
Tse shotguns are now in line with everything else as of the last patch.
---
Explosive was doing 100% not 20% on tse shotguns.
---
That's not Fred, that's Micheal Scott.
---
No, they were just not nerfed as much in the first update, and were brought on par with everything else with this update. Not to even mention that shotguns gain what, 8x the benefit? 9x? I don't know how many pellets they have per shot in this game, it's just a giant nuke when you shoot it
---
Thank you, I was just curious, I haven't heard anything about it :o
---
Nothing like post apocalyptic sales tax. Are they going to repair the roads or clean up the state parks at least?
---
We already are traveling salesman, you just have to invite the other player to trade.
---
people have debunked the "muh gap" argument long ago. enemies in Fo76 essentially close the gap themselves since they're so aggressive. so as a gunner you're constantly repositioning in order not to get hit by melee attackers or even ranged ones that get too close or get a vantage on you.
---
not to mention some guns have laughable range, like shotguns, and require you to get just as close, or that stealth all but negates distance and the worst: melee scales with strength. so unyielding builds can output ludicrous amount of damage that gunners can only dream of.
---
ranged only tops melee when it comes to farming, and that's **if** they can oneshot mobs.
---
How the fuck does me stating in-game lore state my ‚Äúpolitical demographic.‚Äù Stop trying to play yourself to be an elitist making such a short-sighted political comment towards a community of people
---
Thanks but I am on XB1.
---
I can carry 5000 rounds of 5mm ammo and that only weighs 5 pounds. Not everything needs to make sense.
---
A man of culture, I see
---
Nah I was melee against them.  
---
Did just find out you can VATS your own grenades tho.
---
Ah, I see. I took a break from the game at the beginning of January, and just picked it up again yesterday to check out the new content. Why have serums become so cheap/widely available? A few months ago they were one of the most expensive things you could buy!
---
And it's meaning here?
---
I met a guy in game who bought one for 200$
---
U can repair all by going to ur camp thing that u placed down
---
Let‚Äôs do it, my name is laltsl I‚Äôm on now
---
Oh shit. I'm level 245 and I've never done that. Lol thanks
---
I can confirm I've seen then. Few poo piles in watoga I use to check daily would have em.
---
Which I am grateful for. However Bethesda should still have selected a topic more easily googled or given the answers in game.
---
I bought thousands of caps worth of mags on day one, all 50 or 100 each, checking my challenge to see what I needed lol
---
Magazines don't count for challenges unless you picked it up in the wild, so turned out to be a waste.. i expect magazines won't sell as well as time goes on and people discover this :(
---
Just saw him with 2 radstags at sunnytop station  couldn't get a vats shot off before he disappeared into the forest.
---
Not what I was saying at all, we have no freedom to play our own playstyles. As highlited in Smokyphil's comment, there are less options of playthrough, instead of allowing us to have non violent ways of playing. I don't want to mod the game, I want to have fun and play it how I like. I want to be a hired assassin, a shopkeep, a tinkerer, or a supply runner. I like the monotony of simple tasks, and that's completely doable in this game, just not to the scale or use that would make it enjoyable. Don't assume that everyone dislikes the gameplay because they want it to be radically difderent, it makes them look like an asshole.
---
I deleted my sarcastic first commented.   Thanks for a genuine response;  yes it‚Äôs buggy but I think you will have a great time.  Jump in! (Seriously). 
---
Ignore the asshats, and apologies for temporarily being one of them.
---
See you in the wastelands soon!
---
the odds of rolling a specific 3\* are less than 0.000001%. all so that the server can eat it at random.
---
no, this is a very Fo76-ish problem. it's been reported since release.
---
Lol ur welcome
---
Aha ok gotcha
---
Awesome! I‚Äôll send FR and join.
---
Take in the risk of getting close quarters with an explosive weapon and the spread 
---
Shotguns are not in line 
---
Now they are much much weaker
---
I mean i thought that was self explanatory. Put 2 and 2 together, you'll figure it out.
---
I walk around with 50 chassis, which weight 125, so I get that. But like I'm not tryna have a buggy backpack animation added to the already buggy PA animation. And excavator with calibrated shocks gives +200, if u wear it on log in its +300. How much space do u need?
---
I still tune in to her radio once in a while. She has some real personality, too bad they don't build on that.
---
They are around.  About as nasty as a Mirelurk queen too.
---
Thanks for the explanation!
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying.  I‚Äôm a full health boring pve player.   I‚Äôm not really into end game shit.  I‚Äôve been an explosive shotgun build and since the nerf  am switching back to rifles.   I like to snipe Huntersville and Westek.   DPS in that role isn‚Äôt that big of a deal.   Snipe, move, snipe.  I guess now I can get more damage out of my IE rifle with a .50 cal receiver.   That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm speaking of....... kinda ‚Äúcasual‚Äù pve sniping and maximizing the initial damage.  Also just picked up a tse lever and man it‚Äôs an eye opener.   Wow!
---
We need a power backpack
---
Sure I'll die for you psn onepompousa55
---
Can't wait to hear on the news that someone shived someone else with duped number references in a computer program.
---
No different than unyielding armor. You lose all those +3 specials when in PA. Makes the game more interesting. When I‚Äôm not in PA I‚Äôm able to carry 450. Soon as a nuke hits, I have to mass dump weapons because in PA I‚Äôm instantly overweight. Good thing is when I become overweight from picking all that flux I just walk outside the zone and bam, immediately underweight.
---
How is it recovering when the in game currency is worthless and nothing can be obtained except through. The drop rate is so low that nothing rare  would be obtainable at all by caps if it hadnt been duped. Do you think anyone would sell a BE handmade if there were as many of them as old man winter masks? You're backwards, not saying duping is good in the long run but it's the only reason you can get almost anything good. Bethseda screwed the economy with so many limits and terrible drop rates not duping.
---
So what did you lose?
---
Yeah I‚Äôve heard they did a good job at making the games location true to life
---
While the item isn't real, I'm pretty sure the time people have poured into this game only to unjustly lose their items is...
---
It's just another feature they could have, plus it's not like excavator is the best for resistance. Satisfied with the carry limit or not there's no reason we couldn't use one on power armor
---
legendary armor, PA pieces and underarmor.
---
I have over 1k in the game...
---
Probably another attempt to take caps out of the market.
---
Planters, I would love to see them. We had them in Fallout 4 and they already exist in some locations in 76. Need to build my giant greenhouse already damn it!
---
they made a change recently that probably made it obsolete from this standpoint, but before that it was basically impossible to put down any building again that was larger then 2x1 on any ground that isnt the perfectly even ground at white springs golf course.
---
so especially early game when you move your house around a lot it made a lot of sense to have this tower to easily move around without needing to rebuild your whole house from scratch.
---
It's probably considered a minor issue. Maybe it got backlogged and they forgot about it. :/
---
No sadly
---
hahaha yeah I understand..my first character the build was all over the then after level 30 I created a strictly rifle build which I loved..now my first character is coming together because I'm readjusting my perk cards
---
Yeah, I got 3 yesterday
---
My camp is actually next to cliffs  and shallow water if anyone wants me to die for them
---
It happens.  Usually don't think much on it aside from "cheeky bastard".  It is usually less than 100 caps of crap though.  Hurts losing flux from the SBQ reward but that is about the extent of my worries.
---
I have picked up bags before not thinking about it.  Usually grab vendor bags because I assume they are a weight dump.  Leave behind plenty of bags as well.
---
U guys get calibrated shocks. Stop complaining. PA has higher carry capacity then non PA even with non PA folks wearing backpacks.
---
Would love to buy it from you but caps is one thing I struggle with getting so won‚Äôt be able to get it off of you
---
The possum backpack is just a skin you can put on, as the other person said with the mod you carry 120 instead of the basic 60, but you take a -60 hit to energy/rad resistances.
---
Fireproof 3 and a dense chest mod reduced explosive damage to 0.
---
You're going through the change that every other tse felt months ago.
---
I think what happened was before it wouldn't add the two-shot damage bonus to the damage that was shown to us fully, now it does to better calculate how much damage it actually does.
---
Check the second link
---
There is a 25% drop chance, I've gotten plenty. The 25% I'm getting is from data mining.
---
This. I'd imagine that more people would be willing to trade with a stranger now that trading and stores are an actual thing now. Really all they'd have to do is apply the same vending system to your inventory and maybe make a customer backpack with a huge neon open sign on it or something
---
Damn. So mods are going to be like alcohol with the negative side too.
---
Same, I‚Äôll be on soon. AC_Fortuna
---
And armor has weight reducing perks and deep pockets.
---
winning
---
Well after everything I got it done last night finally. Very happy ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Sunny top?
---
Sweet, the grind is worthy
---
if that was true then pre patch my tse handmade and aae handmade woulda both showed 136 dmg. However, the tse showed 161 and the aae showed 136. so it still showed the damage bonus before.
---
Indeed. My plan is to keep a basic backpack and carry a high-capacity one too for when I need it.
---
You had me at "forget to shut my main door"
---
Yeah, I'm aware of duping; my post refers to it.  That itself is an issue for Bethesda to deal with - patching the glitches and whatnot.  I stand by the idea that the douchebags are the minority.  Why resist making the game better for the good guys, just because of them?
---
I'm sure anyone who doesn't run PA wishes they didn't have to run hazmat or PA for nukes.
---
Choices are a thing.
---
And PA has radiation resist multiplier. Each choice you make has its benefits and disadvantages. My DR is higher out of PA but somehow take more damage for the same hit then if I was in PA ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That‚Äôs actually a good idea since the bag only weighs one pound. I might snag your idea.
---
Very well done. I‚Äôm always impressed with people that actually have a design element to their camps. Mine always tend to be a big room with all my benches along the walls
---
Yeah I'm sure it's good for a few
---
I have 52 unused perks, wish I could sell them
---
Bloodied shotgun is insanely good if you have perks/mutations for it. My level 45 double barrel (no explosive, just bloodied) does 700 damage at 20% life. I one shot ghouls and scorched, supermutants need 2 shots.

I never die .. everything dies fast at any range .. scorchbeasts land and stay down with enforcer - even queen .. i farm for plastic something like 30 minutes every two weeks and I play 2 hours a day.

Its very easy and plenty funny all the way from level 1 - 128

Have fun 8)

When you need server connection and it drops you like it‚Äôs hot, drops you like it‚Äôs hot, drops you like it‚Äôs hot.

My parents...

And it also explains why the handmade blows the lever away too.... ie handmade with rifle men perks 1 shots everything the lever can
---
Congrats!

Feel free! :D

Iirc the Wendigo cave had some.

About Blind Willie

&gt; In 1945, his home was destroyed by a fire, but, with nowhere else to go, Johnson continued to live in the ruins of his house, where he was exposed to the humidity. He contracted malarial fever, and no hospital would admit him, either because of his visual impairment, as Angeline Johnson stated in an interview with Charters, or because he was black.[7] Over the course of the year, his condition steadily worsened until he died, on September 18, 1945. His death certificate reported syphilis and blindness as contributing factors.

And in 1977 [his music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjLSf8y94fU) went to space onboard of Voyager I and in 2012 crossed the "border" into interstellar space.

Isn't that amazing?
---
This one I like a lot, if they could figure out how to implement it as not everyone has enough SPECIAL to swap in everything, but if we can't get perk loadouts (which I want, so I can swap between Heavy / Shotgun / Melee easier on my one toon) a "assume I swapped in the most advantageous cards while I craft" logic would be handy. So often that's the routine right? Stop, swap in Chemist, Ammosmith and Super Duper. I swap in Science 1 as well on one so I can build Cryogrenades. etc.

They aren‚Äôt the same type of rifle so you are comparing apples and oranges. On the other hand yes the handmade does more dps than the lever but it doesn‚Äôt oneshot stuff it requires short bursts of 2-3 hits. The handmade is my goto weapon for bosses like the queen and imposter sheepsquatch sometimes the real sheepsquatch too. The lever is for killing in an extremely ammo efficient way any other enemy in the game
---
Interesting, I may have to pick that skin up then!
---
Two near 160, one at 110 or so and starting a 4th.

Braxton‚Äôs quality medical supplies in the mire has a ton of bone and some skulls for sure.

yeah i fell like rose have alot more potential for more content

From my tests with...
---
Bloodied stuff gives 1% dmg per 1% life Lost and maxes out at 80%. Adrenal Reaction maxes out at 50% at 20% HP. Unyielding gives +1 per 25% lost (+3 at 25% hp).
---
Someone datamined that furious is 5% per Hit up to 25% or 50% (cant remember right now).
---
Berserker goes from +50% to -50% dmg at around 200 dr and er.
---
Nocturnal also goes from +50% (at midnight) to -50% (at noon).
---
Feel free to prove me wrong, always like to get enlightened :)
---
I‚Äôm level 180 on my main and have tried multiple builds on it, rifles I love but bloodied is just a pain now with that nerf to sentinel gear
---
PA is surely the cost efficiency way to go with PVE and works against most of the PVP people too
---
OP isn't suggesting it would work w/ too low special points ... I think he states as much in another comment.
---
I still cant put my camp down.. if any furniture piece goes between two foundations and does not rest on a single one the camp cant be put down again.
---
Anti armor only ignores 50 percent of the armor but nowhere says it does extra damage. If a creature has no armor (like animals) you have no advantage over a non-legendary weapon.

What about their big brother, the radscorpion? Thing teleports into my house to fight me while I'm crafting.

Fallout 76 is a strange journey through the post-apocalypse in search of the American Dream.
---
Love this community
---
Quests... explore on the way:)
---
I recommend doing this in Wavy Willard‚Äôs. There‚Äôs a pool of water you can sit in and take off all your armor then let scorched beat you to death.
---
Yeah I'm using my first character now to test the bloodied build..I was lucky enough to get a BE lever so I'm gonna test that out for now..it's really fun
---
I don‚Äôt want to fight about I‚Äôm just telling you a instigating explosive handmade will one shot all the things you said the lever will... it the reason I sold my aae and is levers off for handmades.... I can just imagine bloody would be even stronger
---
Allowing players to choose where other players will land in their camp will just lead to unfortunate situations. Fallout just needs to be more intelligent about the environment around a camp and choose better spawn points.
---
I would hold up on the quest and hang out with other players so they can help level you up 
---
You can get quest rewards at higher levels if you wait too:)
---
Good Appalachian chief can make great food with ridiculous buffs, but spoilage was a real problem.
---
Mama Dolche's canned meat stew can't spoil since last patch btw. It worth to do now
---
Ooo ok interesting to see what kind of terrain it is. Thank you very much kind person üòä
---
it's not just that, it's mainly because of stabilized and rad resistance. other than stealth commandos, which aren't exactly suited for nuke zones, heavy weapons are the way to go for pve.
---
then again, even with a hazmat suit but sneak 3, a commando could probably still dish out more damage.
---
The sooner people stop clicking on their bullsh\*t the better.
---
Plenty to do with this week‚Äôs patch.
---
MY GUY!
---
Duplicating /what/?  Last I checked there was no mathematics quest, so it's nut about multiplying by two.
---
Also the term used was 'dupers' which is not a widely used term at all.
---
There's a bunch in camden park on one of the scam tables.
---
Yes!! I'd love any kind of help/cooperation/live tips, I'll.be on in a half hour or so

I agree with the reboot of the router, and also be sure to reset the console as well.

Yea those guys suck! lol jk play as you play but How bout you use some mats once in a while that you're hoarding over there... Just missing out on the xp of having to scour the wasteland for those two copper and one crystal scrap to regain electricity back in your base bc entry and exit is a powered setup, now open to the world as shooting practice. World knowledge goes up significantly in these situations.
---
The badge is a flat 25% drop from the event and both daily quests, keep on grinding my dude
---
Yea I‚Äôve been running the be lever for awhile now, have one primed one not, just not necessarily the best build for a solo player
---
Send me a pm with your gt and I'll tell you the essentials
---
That‚Äôs amazing!
---
Planters, that's the word I was looking for!
---
Agreed.
---
‚Äú3 stars. Prices too high, but the camp looks good, resources unlocked‚Äù
---
1500 dog food &gt; everything
---
I'm really into that build now..I was like the only one out of my friends that wasn't bloodied lol
---
Here are some of own thoughts. I like these discussions a lot. I think there‚Äôs a lot of room for improving some of the underutilized effects
---
Beserker‚Äôs 
---
- change to +150% at 0 DR and adjust DR scaling accordingly instead of +50% now (fallout 4 was +100% but would still be outclassed by bloodied)
---
Nocturnal - 3 options
---
- change to +100% instead of +50% at peak hours and adjust hourly values accordingly
---
- keep at 50% but grant greatly improved sneak at night (similar to The Fixer)
---
- keep at 50% but make all sneak attack critical shots do additional 50% bonus damage at night 
---
Mutant‚Äôs
---
- change to +10% damage per mutation (cap at 5) for max +50% instead of +10% flat boost while mutated
---
Enemy Specific
---
- buff to +50% instead of +30%
---
Junkie‚Äôs - two options 
---
- change addiction cap to 10 instead of 5 for +100% damage increase (fallout 4 was +10% with no hard cap)
---
- increase damage per addiction to 15% instead of 10% and keep cap at 5 for +75% max damage increase
---

Yep, same for limbs and chest
---
I‚Äôd join her gang just for her voice
---
Any item of their choosing, chems, aid, ammunition, weapons/armour you name it. 1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 4. 
---
What are going to do, duplicate quests? Common sense man.
---
Yeah give it a shot. Tighter spread can‚Äôt hurt since it means more pellets will land. Also I‚Äôm not sure but aiming down sights may tighten it up slightly. Haven‚Äôt used shotguns in a while so I could be wrong
---
Go to the social menu and see if you recognize their name in the Recent players category.

I dumped my BE Combat yesterday because of it. It was time for a change anyway.

Also, I seem to have gotten the level 50 gatling gun from the survival challenge, but I know for a fact I never played survival. What do I do with that bad boy?

The DEFINITIVE guide to Is this game worth buying and playing...

ANSWER: eh, who am I to say?  Depends on you.
---
My TSE Lever went from 245, to 285 dmg with this patch.
---
I called my scrip at 1am and was able to sell again this morning (now 8am). Not sure if it‚Äôs a specific time of day or every 7hours or less after selling an item. I keep checking tho as I have a lot of items to turn in and they‚Äôre weighing me down right now.
---
Yeah, same here...
---
We have a facebook group, with a chat group. EATT-The Establishment of Appalachian Taste Testers.
---
what about my little enclave? can we join and be one big happy enclave?
---
I've been holding onto mines for soooo long. Figured this piece of Royal whatever might be handy sometime.
---
Need me a man in power armor
---
All my two shot launchers are showing near double damage. Which is what I had figured out they were actually doing anyway, but nice to see the stats accurately reflect is.
---
Also my TSE flechette harpoon went from 430 to 1160 somehow. Not complaining
---
No it spawns at Camp Adams after 9 PM automatically, all you have to do is walk near the Camp and it triggers.
---
What did you do to get the tokens?
---
Doh forgot that mags are prob in the category of unsalable items
---
Did that just now. 9pm in game time right?
---
Thanks! I appreciate you watching!
---
I hope it helped! Have a wonderful day!
---
You can always see what‚Äôs broken in your build/edit menu. Destroyed items highlight in yellow and reappear after you repair them. No need to keep remaking new ones.
---
Wrong black musical artist dude
---
Yeah the turrets aren't showing up for some reason
---
Not remotely close
---
I have died and lost junk in places I can't get back to. If it helps someone else, go for it.
---
You can't fast travel to them in survival mode....
---
Yea, free fast travel to non-team camps would be broken as hell. The ability to travel to these camps already makes exploring the map a lot quicker if you don't already have most of it explored. There's no reason it should be free. If you're ever worrying over a few caps for fast travel, you're doing something wrong.
---
&gt; creates some convenience in the urgency of only having 15 Caps and need 23 to travel 
---
And in regards to the op and what they said here makes no sense. If you don't have enough caps to travel so someone's camp, what do you even expect to buy once you're there...? We can only deal in caps... so...yea. 
---
If you're literally not selling anything at your vendor or to a npc vendor and you're gradually running our of caps, that's entirely your fault. I've spent more caps in a few days than I've ever have in a week of playing this game. You can offset a ton of cost for traveling by collecting water from purifiers at camps, which 90% of I've seen unlocked.
---
~~hacking~~ ~~blowjob to devs~~ 
---
What do you mean by what did i do? Which tokens?
---
Metallurgist, Miner, Robotechnitian, electrician, photograph, nuclear physicist, Railroad specialist,
---
What bugs?
---
Not as big as a behemoths
---
Should be fine I've not had a problem
---
Who you calling deformed :,(
---
If they were placed on something that got destroyed they disappear with it but not forever. Repair what it was on then the turret appears broken. Then repair the turret.
---
I'm still debating on whether I'm going for the fridge mod or more carry weight. Had it been said anywhere how much of a buff the additional carry weight mod is?
---
I've rebuilt my entire camp yesterday and today, and I haven't encountered any big bugs.
---
I would love a little mailbox or notice board where peeps can leave me messages.
---
should be 120
---
Ah ok, was curious if you did challenges or the camp fire event. Done the event 9 times still haven't got one.
---
Wait, is that why I could inspect some things, but not others? They have to be there to inspect?
---
i did 7 bages, so looks like i got one
---
You do know Pharell works with other people?
---
No way that it doubles, that would be insane! But I'll take it if it does. Lmao
---
Will after that first capture guess who is on the FBI watch list now (‚òûÔæü„ÉÆÔæü)‚òû
---
I think wastelanders is the story dlc but I might be mistaken
---
Amazing work!!! Thank you for all of your time and energy that you've put into making this. I have bookmarked this post as i will be using this quite frequently, I imagine. Again, many, many thanks!!
---
Weird that my friend has ALL shotgun perks and her TSE shotgun barely does over 200 damage. My bloodied pump with no shotgun perks does over 400 in my hands.
---
Thanks, dude. Was lucky at the third spot.
---
It's server side not player specific and had a 1 hour chill down so if someone else beat you to it it won't work
---
You are definitely right LOL bring them on! It would be cool to hang out with some feds for an afternoon and see the good cop / bad cop thing live and in person haha
---
This would be cool. I'd love to have a portable shop to go along with my murder hobo lifestyle
---
Pocketed on a raider chest is 15 for some reason. It just works!
---
Yeah, but my char can carry a lot already, so i decided to go fridge
---
unlocking the backpack is only the start the mods like increase carry weight and fridge storage and other mods need Possum Badges they are like the tadpole badages but you need to do something like 20-40 things for each badge but the fridge mod needs 8 badages and so does the higher carry weight 
---
it will be one big boring grind fest and some of them can't be done if you don't have the perks and you need lots of junk to some of them
---
I've heard a lot of issues about not being able to build under stairs anymore, and stuff about stairs and multiple floor camps not working either. I've also heard some issues about being out of bounds for building and not being able to place things down even inside your camp limits
---
Sometimes I‚Äôll buy something small so they know I‚Äôm there and just hope they fast travel home so I can inspect stuff.
---
That's such a good name.
---
Report the kid.
---
I bought 1800 lol -----&gt; problem solved.
---
How much you looking to spend
---
Haha that was awesome.. to bad it wasnt a live recording.. that would make it priceless
---
Is that the same for Brahmin at your C.A.M.P?  Same cool down?
---
I think Abbie's Bunker has 2 or 3 microscopes in one of the back rooms.
---
most polygon articles are good
---
Yeah I see that
---
I should have, and if it ever comes up again I absolutely will. But I hopped off immediately and didn‚Äôt remember his PSN. I‚Äôm an idiot, it just really surprised me.
---
The brick walls, with no door look good
---
Or free to go to camps
---
Anything to make it easier to find corpses is a win in my book.
---
Fast Travel Mat &gt; Aoe looting
---
I could spend 50 caps each if that‚Äôs reasonable? (That was the price I had found it for.)
---
I learned on day 1 of the patch not to fast travel to camps. I just go to the closest location and walk the rest of the way.
---
People dont care before it happens to them. Happened right after christmas to me so i feel you. In my case it was my first QE db.
---
Recovering in that imperfect items were starting to be traded for the best stuff. Now the bar is raised again by dupes of the new best stuff. When I say economy, I'm not talking about caps.
---
Most logical and thoughtful comment in this thread.  This sub was so helpful and kind to other users until the nerds for shotguns and armor came out.  Now there are a bunch of jealous have-notes laughing at the people that spent a lot of time working for good gear.
---
I agree, the game needs to be smarter about this. It can't be that hard tbh
---
If there's a wall, the spawn point should move automatically to a more convenient place, not suck the person inside the wall like a black hole or something.
---
For me, the fastest was going to Flatwoods and milk 8-9 brahmin there. Then fast travel to Aaronholt Homestead and milk the 3 brahmin there. Dont forget to take a pic of one of the brahmin.
---
From the looks if it you're literally only in this subreddit to argue with fans of the game. Doesn't even seem like you play it.
---
I'm not sure what's more pathetic, coming to a subreddit for a video game you hate just to shit on it, or being a chapotraphouse user.
---
Pretty much any console and game has this issue / you go to MS/Sony and they say contact the developer, you go to the developer and they tell you to contact MS/Sony.
---
It's a bullshit cycle, but in their defense they shouldn't have to refund store purchases unless it was a glitch that caused the purchase or items not being given.
---
If i made a mistake and bought something i don't think i would ask for a refund, it was my mistake and i'd learn from it.
---
Yep. Started with rifles, switched to shotguns and now to melee and I can say melee is a completely different game. So easy.
---
I‚Äôve had the same issue with other CAMP items. I normally back out of build mode then reactivate it. It usually self corrects after that.
---
Or when your main character is quite literally broken and unplayable for 3 days...as in I have not been able to load into a server since Wednesday
---
That works, but my method is free! (In all seriousness, that‚Äôs a good way too, but I couldn‚Äôt find the Brahmin.)
---
Vice versa for me lol. i see people at my camp and the only thing that goes through my mind is "buy my damn merch"
---
I was thinking about trying to pull it off live and in person at my local LOWES lol
---
It's twofold:
---
Melee enemies can't pick away at your base durability.
---
Easy to re-deploy and move 1 foundation block almost anywhere on the map. Good luck trying to pick up a 4x4 section or bigger and expect to re-place it.
---
If you move your camp box it will modify where you spawn in. I think it effects other players as well.
---
How are you negating the -60 Energy &amp; Radiation resistance though? This has been my only hold up from upgrading üòî
---
You should try wastelad, it's the fallout version of grognak.. reminds me of old school rpgs on comodore 64!
---
Do you get an immediate Disconnected From Server? I‚Äôve had this issue since Wednesday. My main character physically can‚Äôt load into a server. Apparently the dev team is working on a fix as there are multiple people affected.
---
The same applies to ALL weapon mods, there's zero reason you have to REmanufacture everything if you want to change a configuration. Want to change your reflex sight back to recon scope? SCRAP the reflex and RE make that recon scope. It's just dumb and completely the opposite of reality. Maybe they want to force players to grind for materials and spend more time at the bench to enhance the longevity of the game. That's the only logical reason I can think of. Or the game dev have never touched firearms and are completely clueless.
---
I just use the keypad version
---
Gonna need a bigger face
---
Add people as a team and it's free.
---
It‚Äôs only when you first place your camp, not moving it after the fact. I‚Äôve already figured this out. Thanks though.
---
By how much does it reduce your weight?
---
Actually that's too cheap we sell them for 100 to 200 each
---
Sadly with this issue that doesn‚Äôt fix it =/
---
GT aGraciousGod, on a Server with her.
---
**T R U E    T O    C A E S A R**
---
Bulk.
---
by half, to 30
---
I'm a sneaky boy, so damage resistance isn't that important to me tbh
---
It's a 1 hour cool down yes
---
Make bulk junk, scrap unused weapons/armor, sell it to the vendors, or give it away
---
Duplicate self, XP, one-off quests, free camp placements?  The point is 'dupers' is a shibboleth that is vague and confusing to the new.  So thank you for finally getting off your newb-mocking (see what I did there?) high horse and finally answering the question usefully rather than resorting to condescension akin to a teenager.
---
Thanks man, that's cool of you to say!
---
Ah, sorry I can‚Äôt afford that much. Thank you though!
---
Haha I got a lowes right on the other side of the bridge where I live.. I think I'm gonna see what happens here as well
---
The one that is shown in the forest is the junk version, not the aid unfortunately. Checked that one yesterday.
---
It's ammo is considered energy ammo which is effected by Batteries Included. For damage it's effected by rifleman perks.
---
At least in the previous patch, the Dense mod for various armors could be *rarely* found at the inner Grafton vendor.  I'm not sure if it's still the case now, although things like "Combat Polymer Mod" still pop up at both there and Grafton Station.  Some have said that the plan has a chance of dropping from Megasloths in the Cranberry Bog, but I haven't seen this myself.
---
Don't know about the Lever Action Rifle issue.
---
It‚Äôs not sustainable but on a bloodied build it still puts out crazy work. 
---
Fingers crossed for a buff at some point
---
You have to repair your weapon/armor on their corresponding workbench by going into the modify menu (default is space) and inspecting the item which then will let you repair them
---
Milk the brahmin at your camp, kill it, repair it, repeat. Sometimes you can't milk it, seems like a 50/50 chance. Just kill and repair. You'll have the challenge done in 5 minutes.
---
Personally, I'm never remodeling again unless I can help it. I went to change one wall, which couldn't be placed back in for some reason, which led to one thing and another trying to fix the issues... In the end I had to dismantle the entire top floor just to fix the small thing I wanted to fix. And that wasn't the first time it's happened unfortunately. The ladder seems to be the biggest culprit in my remodeling mishaps. 
---
Exercise caution and be prepared to have to rebuild.
---
Some player carpet bombed the entire map with neutron bombs üòµ
---
I just realize how I spelt it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Will do
---
+karma thank you
---
Point to me where I said he should stop making videos.
---
and taste is subjective
---
I was just doing it and got disconnected from the server
---
Or how about something like the power armour mod that highlights nearby enemies? But highlights corpses?
---
reee sombody said something bad about my favorite youtuber.

I used to be sneaky... then I took an arrow to the knee ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

What‚Äôs the location?

It's at camp Addams. I've done it a few times.

It‚Äôs not duper‚Äôs fault that Bethesda release games and patches with massive problems that can be exploited.
---
Looks like a mix of all the Bumblebee versions throughout the years of Transformers.
---
The hot dog eating contest is a random daily that can come up after you have done quest in the fairgrounds.
---
Same storage capacity
---
It still does ballistic damage despite the ammo being classified as energy.
---
The roadmap does mention a 'New Main Quest' so I'm assuming it'll maybe open up a new server where Scorchbeasts are wiped out and NPCs start populating WV. The map is gunna be pretty dry by that point however so I'm hoping it also takes us to a new area such as Ohio, maybe chasing down the missing Overseer.
---
Since it's got the theme of cards for perks. Let us make a "deck" where we have 2 different setup of perk cards and have a hotkey to switch between them.
---
The thing is, that it isn't showing up at all at the cursor. Other items do.
---
There's actually 3 spawns, there's a guy who made maps of pretty much everything in the game, including those 3 spawns. Was on the front page yesterday?
---
Just DMd you and yes this happened to me on Wednesday. Only my main character is affected.
---
I believe that either it's intentionally rare, or that the chance you'll contract it per hit is VASTLY lower than intended. Easily less than a 10% chance, or even 5%. There could be a predetermined chance you'll get it at all from the diseased hatchling as well. All I can say is that if you don't get it in under 7 minutes, hop servers and try again.
---
Thank you for that fact as well. Now to go searching for one!
---
Maybe it only effects the player because I just moved my spawn point.
---
monetize it.. 
---
2 slots for free.. 75 atoms per slot up to 5 total per character
---
tied to the character not the account
---
Yes. Eventually, I got on. I spent some time doing something else (ack!) and came back to it
---
Camp Adams at night. 2 different events in one. 1 you fight a unique wedingo and the other you do 3 waves of enemies. Both events have 25% chance to earn a possum badge along with s'mores recipe and a plan for tent.
---
Not bad thanks
---
I don‚Äôt know but I hate it. I never buy anything from a store with this kind of setup
---
I play exclusively in survival so player camps are sometimes the only fast travel spots in an area.
---
Ah lucky lol. I just tried and still can‚Äôt get on. Guess my extended break continues
---
It works for me again as of right now not sure if you‚Äôve checked
---
This is great, thanks. Really cool project. 
---
Now time to team up with a mod maker so we can get compass markers for the closest items of interest. ;)
---
Yeah, this week's challenge was bugged and it awarded the Resolute Veteran in Adventure mode. You can either save it for when you hit level 50, try and sell it another player (you probably won't get a buyer though because nearly everyone got it), you can sell it to a train station vendor for a crappy amount of caps or you can put it in the legendary machine and get some scrip for it.
---
Jetpack?
---
I can‚Äôt find the shooting range in the palace, any tip? :D
---
No.
---
Her quests should be about stealing from other factions like raiding an Enclave convoy or stealing from a Responder outpost.
---
Thanks for the confirmation
---
The best way to play this fallout is to explore everything you can in a zone, and passively complete quest. You will  find more  to do by "hacking" into terminals, talking to robots, and doing events. The events are usually pretty fun and they are easy money with free loot.    I try to limit my fast travels in 76 while questing but when I get board of exploring i Fast travel to events.  
---
The Forest -¬†Levels¬†1 to 10
---
Toxic Valley -¬†Levels¬†10 to 25
---
Ash Heap - Levels 25 to 35
---
The rest of the zones start around lvl 30 and scale to 99
---
there is an extra step to do a regular repair.. added in to account for repair kits..
---
inspect &gt; workbench repair
---
Yeah, they're basically useless now.
---
Thanks for this. Mine started on Wednesday and still can‚Äôt login. Hoping it‚Äôs fixed by tomorrow so I can grind on my main.
---
Neon letters, Greek letters and small letters....

Nevermind, I saw the workshop repair button

I always want to tune into her radio, but the music gets stale after a while and her voice is really quiet for some reason, if she was the dj of Appalachia radio that would be great.

Still though even as a die hard responder even I got to admit the raider side is tempting with her leading it

I will be honest: since i start dropping them, i never repaired my stuff at workbench anymore. So yeah, they are not

Heart of the enemy actually started working again after the last patch, but it seems like it was at the expense of AWOL because I haven't seen it since last weekend. üôÅ
---
Whoever made the first comment is shadowbanned
---
Thanks!!
---
Awol is rare as it always was. I did it couple of times already
---
Ha Yeah I've done that.  I mean for it to show up as a tooltip on the map.  Give the CAMPs more personality and sometimes an idea of what's going on there.  *Whitesprings Bar and Grill, Deathclaw Island Restaurant, Blackberry Farm* etc...
---
I have to say the "make friends with a deathclaw" quest was a stroke of genius.  I went and seriously thought this deathclaw wouldnt try to eat my face immediately.
---
I was really low level when that happened so that was a fight.
---
Thanks!!!!
---
Alright I‚Äôll check in a bit thanks!
---
Would also like to get in on this if either of you us willing.

I personally dislike the voice tho...

Ohh her daily could be fixing the radio relay antenna some hater shot at... again ;p

Awesome!!!

Clap along if you feel like some rads without a roof

Clap along if you feel like radiation is the truth

Maybe a backpack that indicates a vendor? Would make things much easier to be honest and it would be a good addition to an already existing system.

In cranberry boy at the brotherhood of steel base if you head west up the mountain their are a few water holes on the side of a mountain have been camping there for a whole never have my based attacked and i have 5 purifiers in the water hole.
---
I am become death has been the only main quest for months that had left to do, I'm level 114, a power armor heavy melee build and I finally did it last night and solo, I got lost a lot was most of the difficulty, assaultrons could barely do any damage to me, yes, take out the turrets then the Gutsys, in that order, for me most every enemy could be destroyed in 4 or 5 hits.
---
WV lumber has quite a few
---
I have it now if you still need to borrow
---
That‚Äôs awesome. I didn‚Äôt even know that existed. We need stuff like that on consoles.
---
Yeah I stood in place for an hour with hunters sentinel armor on and let 8 mirelurk spawns attack me, two of which were diseased, while popping rad-x and radaways and still never caught it
---
It has switchable lenses an works like a weapon. So you dont need to pause the game, go to photomode, adjust your camera etc etc just to take a picture

---
To my knowledge the only way is to cancel all sales and re-up them with the desired discount. I like the idea though..
---
It will pop if you go to camp adams after around 9:45 at night in the game, just fast travel and if its not on cool down it will start
---
yeah, i can see this point system making sense cause you cant really be good at every gun and scenario, but stuff like this, and lockpick and hacking should be passive or something. boring to switch all the time
---
What are you then?

What I like is that Bethesda has kept its jankiness over the years while others have worked so hard to squeeze that out.  I know that seems like an odd thing to compliment, but if you play their games, you understand what makes them different from the annual Ubisoft sandbox.  The game actually has a personality.  It has brilliant ideas, it has faults, it sometimes challenges you to look past these things.  But it feels like the sum of an almost "triple A indie" operation, rather than coughed out by a soulless machine of 1,000 people.
---
I can help you out in 30-ish minutes if needed.
---
Psn:Panmand
---
I have 1K+ of almost every ammo in the game but don‚Äôt use some of it.
---
It‚Äôs ok someone‚Äôs already helping. Thanks for offering though
---
Chameleon and max sneak work brilliantly, I use it with covert op, bloody mess, tank killer and max rifleman x3.
---
All you need is a decent suppressed rifle, ideally instigating.
---
You say that, whilst clearly having knowledge of the term itself, and you've came here to BE on a high horse looking for people to by cryptic in their explanation. (Because most people have some knowledge of what duplication is or means or used for to some capacity) 
---
Yet you acted like you didn't, to recieve a comment like mine, to make a point because you believe you're superior in intellect than everyone else.
---
So before you go too into something, make sure you're conversing with someone stupid rather than intelligent, akin to the modern day troll.

---
&gt;Her quests should be about stealing from other factions like raiding an Enclave convoy or stealing from a Responder outpost.
---
Damn straight. Another horde mode event could work too, like Rose intercepts an Enclave transmission taking about Top of the World so she asks you to come defend it. Start out by clearing several waves of robots attacking outside, and while you're distracted by them the legendary leader and some of its minions sneak in so you have to travel inside and kill the final waves.
---
Also, some more syringer challenges could be fun. Model them after the Biv quests, "test the effects of X syringe on 3 &lt;insert enemy&gt;" and have the raider themed camp objects as rewards.
---
I'd rather see a level challenge turned into something that requires you to gain a certain amount of experience fighting specific enemies instead of having to level up with 3 silly conditions.
---
There are at least 3 Level "0" terminals and a Level "1" at Garrahan Mining Headquarters. May be more than is just what I seen on my last go through there. Also Level "1" terminals in and around the Flooded Trainyard (near Watoga).
---
There is plenty of lore in game that one could put two + two together to narrow it down.  
---
You know the brotherhood wants the data.  You know that the brotherhood is based out of Camp Venture.  Probably a good idea would be to scout around Camp venture and look for any out of the ordinary areas such as a somewhat hidden, non-obvious basement area .  Once you find yourself in the basement which also happens to be a .. workshop area, probably a good idea to look around for any spots that might be a good place to submit the data like a dropbox or something.  
---
I get your point but come on- you sound really silly to those of us who spent our youth literally drawing maps on a notepad and keeping vast notes of NPC names and clues.
---
Those gt‚Äôs are made for each other. Must be fate lol.

Blueprints are best for little defensive stations, or I made a little blueprint for my two foundation shop setup.  The more foundations your structure uses the harder it is to place the blueprint.  Also if you do any building tricks that bypass rules, like stacking the 1x2 ladders, you'll never be able to move it.

No way do you have Butcher's Bounty maxxed and you don't have a piece of meat off 7-8 SB, its impossible.
---
I use one-star Butcher's Bounty and Y-search other people's SB kills, when I wasn't even around, and I get meat every time, sometimes multiple. 
---
The only possible explanation is that you are unaware that you have to actively SEARCH with a new button to use Bounty perk. That or you are fibbing :P

I tried last night. The revive procced on me and it did NOT give me credit. These pieces of gear will not work.
---
Often, CAMPS with multiple foundations cannot be moved or built from blueprints due to excessive restrictions in the build system.
---
People figured out that the only reliable way to avoid rebuilding from scratch every time, was to use a single foundation.

Thanks, dude

Everyone talks about passive cards or perks loadouts. There is a third solution: "travel" and "camp/workshop" perks that are loaded **automatically** upon entering or leaving a buildable area.
---
Hey can you put it on my backpack or sell it to me? I have caps.
---
You have to milk the female ones ,ü§£
---
Thank you for being awesome!
---
After the patch too. I still can't replace my camp and I have to rebuild everything every time...
---
Yeah, unless you have the right perks lined up, attempting most recipes is a futile effort
---
They all hope someone with loads of caps but only two brain cells will show up.
---
How much extra damage per perk point?
---
It still doesn‚Äôt work for me :C
---
Gonna necro this, but to help others who may be searching for this in the future and arrive here, don't listen to this guy. The holotape he's talking about isn't the fort defiance holotape, its the Allegheny holotape. You'll have to follow the BoS questline to get any further.
---
Logged on this morning and all my items were gone out of all 3 of my vending machines. I was lucky though, all items were back in my stash for some reason. I just had to reload the machines. This was on xb1.
---
Extremely.
---
Wait wait wait...are you saying that the extra meat wouldn't show up in the dead creatures inventory? I have to press a separate button?
---
Thanks for this. I was going to respec for it on my 3 str vats/rifle toon but i can easily have a bender with booze and drugs to tick it off
---
RIP pet rock
---
upvote
---
I love the vending.... But the whole sharing with my stash box is not cool... I would like to see the vending have its own storage space.  And maybe have a changeable plaque on the front that can be set to represent what is being sold in that machine.

I put AC in mine....
---
I‚Äôve found a Dense CA plan at Watoga station on first day of patch , I‚Äôve been looking at (known ) plans (since obviously I learned it on the spot) every time I‚Äôm there and haven‚Äôt seen it again, it is out there tho, I have screen capture on my recent Ss on Xbox at the armor bench with it in the mods, ....and no I don‚Äôt have a mislabel mod in my inventory
---
Provided you start the quest and active the lists prior to doing all things ‚Äúyou‚Äôd naturally do‚Äù like killing a Yao goi with a syringer.
---
Junkies is just fine.
---
250 caps for a bloodied Grog Axe sounds like too good to be true. Maybe stalkers or junkies.
---
I think you misunderstood...
---
So you agree that availability of camp spots is already limited, since you had to go through 7 servers for yours to place. And you can't see how if everyone left their camp in a server forever, it'd be terrible?
---
It comes down to more than just gear though doesnt it? His perk cards may also have played a bigger role.
---
I have never had much of an issue taking out a bloodied when I get first shots in. If I dont though, i expect to drop pretty fast.
---
But that's the trade off isnt it - less health for more power. Seems like a fair trade off.
---
With the HP levels Bloodied go around it, they are frequently dying in PVE battles other breeze through.
---
I play with a bloodied Lever Action. With all the rifleman perk cards etc, and my health hovering at around 15%, I output about 3-400 damage. If I can get the jump on you -, I win.
---
But if you get the jump on me - I dont stand a chance.
---
That's balance pure and simple. 
---
If someone starts attacking me, I make them think I am leaving, get a stealth boy powered up, get a got position and take my shots. If I am fast enough, I'll down the person, if they start using stims, I'm at enough range that I'll still get a few off before they zero in on me but If they do and I fail to drop them then I'm dead....simple as.
---
I cant just roll in and mess people up, I have to carefully pick my battles and plan them out to a degree, most of which i determine the odds against me and just move on. That's hardly being OP. That's using my build and resources the best way I know how to win a fight I did not pick.
---
Enjoy :D

Why do people sell treasure maps so cheap? Most of them give you weapons and supplies that you can sell for way more than a hundred caps at vendor bots.
---
If you're on PC and haven't found one by the time I get on a little later (in an hour or two), I'll be more than happy to make you one. I won't charge you anything, not even materials to make it, though Adhesive would be welcomed :P I'm getting "low" on that, only have like 50 currently. *(lol I give away tons of junk and it's hard keeping track of what I'm low on, so I tend to give away what I ought to be keeping or my* ***own*** *needs!)*
---
Ueah, I'm having the same issue. Have everything else done for this badge, except the deathclaw hide lol. I dont mind a challenge, but every other animal you kill drops its hide....
---
Yeah I'm aware of that evil stairs glitch. It was the death of some of my favorite builds. This time around I should be fine because I'm not gonna move any of the stairs or upper floors I'm only gonna replace what's underneath.
---
I had a bunch of shelves and decor to mimic a little shop for my camp. I used a set of stairs and some upper floors as the "roof" and then used the top of the "roof" as an outdoor crafting area. With the addition of the vending machines I'm scrapping everything that was part of the shop and just remodeling that part.
---
"wave of people duping the Old Man Winter Mask." But more seriously, I don't know.

BigMcChris, add me bud

Seriously, why can't everyone be that cool?  It was fast, you were friendly and polite, that was perfect!
---
I only have a single staircase, but it is a tree house so that is even too much.
---
I've been cvaught off guard by jerks before too. 
---
I don't even know what the settings are to record live action.
---
Sadly, that is exactly what Im telling you.
---
Same for the Ammo search perk, same for Pharma Farmer perk, same for Can Do perk. 
---
On my XBOX the controller maps it to Y. Have to hit Y every time, then an animation plays and a sound effect if successful.

Even endgame, Ive continued to use Pharma Farmer, these perks are so undervalued!

 My Nocturnal 40% Speed Combat Knife can get to 250+ before Adrenaline kicks in. It runs at nearly 300 a hit after a few kills. That's 4 a sec till your mouse breaks. ;)

I found one outside Dyer Chemical this morning. Totally caught me off guard and shook me a little as I have not been very successful killing legendary beasties on my own. Plus I was out of stimpacks but figured is give it a try anyway. 'Squatch took me down once but I came back and made it fall hard to my combat shotgun, Blammo!
---
Why would anyone downvote this reply... play nice, Wastelanders :)
---
I have smores recipe, do you have maybe some other plans like bloatfly mount?
---
same, although im unsure if using a fatman as a glorified baseball bat was was the intended purpose of the weapon
---
Too much to do even.  This update is the best one yet.
---
Cool! And good luck. Figure that with that build, bloodied deathclaw gauntlets and mole miner gauntlets do about 1800.
---
But, you can‚Äôt use those weapons in power armor, so either take a ski sword with you to a SQB, or use a Hazmat suit.
---
Wow that's kinda ridiculous but o well. Thank you stranger, atleast now I know. I play on PC so for me it will be the SPACE bar
---
Clickbait. You fell for it.
---
Regen, like a on a Gulper is very strong. I use them to test DPS. ;)
---
Oh I wish it was a sales tax. Instead, it‚Äôs an income tax. Seller pays it.
---
I have been critical of the whole situation is launch. No one listened. Dupers literally destroyed your experience with this game. How you might ask? Well first they ruined what little economy we had. They made end game a joke by polluting the entire system with duped 2 shots explosives. Also sold them for real world currency. And barely anyone was punished for it. people who bought 2 shot explosive weapons or other duped items were not punished. in any other mmorpg they would have been banned.
---
i don't agree with how this was handled and until they change how they handle these situations i won't be.
---
its like they are trying to run a mmo with a skeleton crew.
---
boo :(
---
Repices are a one time buy is my guess.  Only one real use and that's to get sales.  Most won't pay thousands, so you can tempt everyone into paying some money.
---
Agreed, I hope to see more content like this in the future.

If it is any consolation, I played a good couple months before some other Redditor pointed out the extra key press for the additional meat/loot, a lot of folks missed this detail!
---
Make your enemies so blackout drunk they forget why theyre fighting and wander off.

Loadouts in general would be so much helpfull.

Even it's just 3 Sets (1 camp/repair, 1 scavenge/trade and 1 comat or possible 3 different combat style

I don't think Chameleon stacks anymore (or the way it used to), I used to use a full suit and saw a huge difference around patch 8.

Buy one at the Enclave bunker if you can go there.

I'm amazed people who have played more than a few hours don't know this.

melee with a fatman counts as kills for o e of the new challenges, which is far cheaper than making enough nukes to get the requirement

Get on top of the little shed and keep blasting both with minigun or anything with a lot of firepower so they will attempt to fight you and not the brahs, definitely doable. Did this with a 30-ish player he was hiding in the shed the whole time just for the XP.
---
The thing I seem to sell out of most are legendary weapons. I price mine at 278 for 1 stars, 556 for 2 stars, and varying prices for 3 stars. I only sell stuff with prefixes people are interested in like bloodied, anti-armor, etc. I know the prices are a little weird but after you factor in that you make 90% of the sale they make a little more sense.
---
I also have a lot of chameleon and I think some weightless armor for the same prices, but they don't seem to sell as well as I thought they would. In fact I'm not sure if I even sold a single piece since the launch of this update.
---
In the case of Fallout 3, the "jankiness" definitely added to the charm and gave the game a special kind of character
---
That's not being lazy, that's just being comfortable Haha. I kept my xbox 360 controller for whenever I play a Fighting game on pc
---
I understand but there are many suits out there for sale. Just keep an eye out and I'm sure you may be able to get one within your cap limit.
---
And that is a refreshing idea.
---
I was thinking the same thing, the facial textures look like they're from FNV, they look out of place in 76
---
This would help and not tie a player to their camp.
---
Step one. Stop taking body shots, go for head/limb shots. They take more damage. (learn to aim, or invest in the perk that lets you select your vats target).   
---
Step two. Get the magazine for your weapon that does armor penetration damage  (and only armor penetration damage. it does the best APen).   
---
I mean, if you're horrible at FPS games, have never played a fallout game before, and have zero observational skills, I can kinda see your point, but there's a very shallow learning curve...it's more "gentile slope".
---
I love the plans and ammo, but I'm stingy AF with the ammo. I don't believe in paying caps for ammo... there was a point in this game all unneeded ammo was dropped by players... not gouged for 1 cap per bullet. Exception is of course Plasma Cores.
---
I think many players are catching on that my shop doesn't charge for ammo, I've gotten quite a few generous regulars that go for the real goods. As long as the pricing is fair though - people will buy it. Rare items that you only get once in the game, super rare drop, or items no longer made, are the real cash cows in the game.
---
Is this the character you played in the beta?
---
Achievements done during beta will never unlock. You have to create a new character and get them on that one.
---
Agreed but remove chem effect when relog need to be fix I think
---
Got the Pemican recipe after completing the bug part hunt from the bot at Dolly Sods. And it was a great quest-- ran into legendary Mirelurks, Honey Beasts, and Stingwings along the way that dropped good loot and weapons. Highly recommended.
---
BTW, haven't looked at the Pemican recipe to be honest, just that I got the recipe and a piece of it.
---
lol pathetic

Good to know. Thanks.

Wow, really? I've been farming the crap out of this event and never seen the Wendigo! Do you have to be alone or something?

I was buying Bobbleheads I needed for the challenge, finished that day 1.
---
Then I was buying Magazines, but Reddit has taught me that they need to be found in the wild to count for challenges.
---
I buy any MAPS from Savage Divide and Eastwards (Dont want Forest) and buy ALL maps I see for 50-75; 75-150 for SD/Mire (but not Ash/Bog/Toxic at that price).
---
Any 3\* weapons or armor under 500 caps Ill take a look at. The broken inspect has cost a few vendors as I wont buy until I see the effects. I know certain prefixes like Bloodied go for a lot, but the variety of odd weapons and effects has me trying out all kinds of things I didnt think Id try out :)
---
I had 2x mutations I wanted, but first 600 cap Serum vendor I found, I alt-tabbed out and searched for good melee builds focused on many mutations, and now I need to scroll down to read all my mutations. Of course, this is another one-time purchase that will peter out quickly, but vendors with multipel of each serum seem to be out of Marsupial, so that must sell like hotcakes...
---
Wish I could find someone selling Mr Fuzzy Tokens from Camden park.
---
Masks and outfits Im not familiar with Ill buy on site, even for a decently high price. I think this will persist as long as there are outfits most of us dont own.
---
O have yet to see hardened masses and flux for sale, at teh right price I imagine Id pick up lots of those and repeatedly so.
---
Finally, plans. PLANS will sell if you have what we want, and of all the vendors I went to, these had the craziest range of prices and they are also what I found I was willing to risk paying too much for. I bought some plans for 800 one place then found them 200 the next, was kind of exciting but not worth writing prices down and going back and forth for.
---
Hope that wall of crap gives you a faint idea or two! Good luck!
---
No they nerfed the fk out of shotguns, they‚Äôre practically worthless, all mine are unusable and hardly do any damage whatsoever
---
They didn't need it. They fixed it. The explosive shotguns were doing more damage than the pipboy said it was. This patch fixed the damage to do what the pipboy says.
---
Just got to hit a limb. Doesn't matter if its vats or not. If you have the perk and hit a limb you will do that extra damage. üëç

New Survival Mode weapon.

The Cha Ching rifle.

It costs you a real dollar for every shot and it's a one hit, insta kill splash damage weapon that makes your enemy drop their entire inventory and stash....
---
I mean.... That seems like Juicehead's kind of speculation....
---
Was a must for Virtua Fighter!
---
That‚Äôs not what I said, you have to read better!
---
Leave a bag of fertilizer and toilet paper and a Molotov in front of the vendor.
---
Flaming bad of poop for crap prices.
---
LOL luckily I played early with people who knew what was what and led me down the right path for the most part. Otherwise I imagine I'd still be in the Forest making Healing Salves in Flatwoods lol
---
Yeah, I got that feeling too.
---
If noone else will help you then I will be available in about 20 mins
---
Easier to move around
---
That's true, but in my opinion the trade interface on the vending machines works a lot better and is more polished than current player-player trading though.
---
 Plus it's kind of nice to have them able to see everything you're willing to sell instantly and not have to pull them from your inventory each time you want to trade.
---
It would be really nice if you could also add a Wanted List of items you're looking for with a set price range you're willing to buy them at so people checking out your wares could also easily sell stuff to you too.

Weight of your armor, movement, and your AGI score all affect your stealth rating.

I personally use the Chameleon mutation (not the armor pieces) with a full set of weightless armor and my AGI is somewhere around 22.

I am a ghost. Even in broad daylight anything with two legs will walk right into me, turn a different direction and move on all without breaking hidden/caution.

At night, mole rats and ants cant find me as long as I am moving slowly.

If youre on Ps4 I can craft and them for you.
---
Nice! i want it too, but for now i only got 2nd bowie knife scout paint, 2nd S'mores plan and 2nd bloatfly monted head. lucky me
---
I appreciate the offer! However I‚Äôm on Xbox. Thank you anyways!
---
You were a bit too cocky when you left, so you didn't get credit for it.
---
I think they are worthless now. My BE double barrel does 1005 DAM at 20% health and it takes me 3 shots to kill a lv 65 scorched. However, my BE lever, 503 DAM, takes them out in one shot, how is that possible?
---
Yeah, there's an easier explanation:
---
Because you earn 9/10 of the sale price as income, multiplying the sale price you set by the inverse of that, 10/9, will counteract the tax deduction.
---
Where do I find the reciope?
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll get on soon
---
Appreciate the detail! Hadn't thought at all about the Mr. Fuzzy Tokens!
---
Thanks! I appreciate the answer.
---
Thank you very much. I appreciate the answer.
---
Is there a way to see a weapon/armours 3\* values when buying from a player vending machine? I can't seem to find a way of seeing what effects they have when it's 2 or 3\*.
---
Thanks, let me know when you are available.
---
RNG wins again! Damn, I want that bloatfly, tho. Oh, Big tip: if you don't get the blotfly out and about, when you return to the bot at Doddy Sods with the other bug parts, there are two bloatflies in the building you can plunk.
---
each price is PER ITEM. just like it is everywhere else
---
its very open and missing a lot of details
---
same base weapon? same enemy? same distance? same pellet hits? other statlines on said weapon?
---
the less armor the less effective the AA effect is
---
I‚Äôve had the same issue with all kinds of stuff! The balloons from faschnat and crops have been the worst. Same stuff as you describe, either saying it needs support when it‚Äôs clearly supported or even more often it sinks halfway into the ground and wants me to place it there.
---
Read my statement. They fixed the shotguns and they now do the intended damage. One will be better than the other. Also depends on the perks you have equipped so there's no way for us to tell what is affecting your damage output.
---
Try removing all perks.
---
Take into account mutations.
---
Use both weapons on the same type and level enemy.
---
Compare results.
---
Look for red toolboxes. They have been spawning like crazy in them. For me or on purpose, I don't know.
---
Got it from the Campfire event, forgot the exact name. But you can find it at Camp Adam (SW of Flatwoods.)
---
Think you could help me out too? (Also the water revive one) I'll give you some vendor business provided your prices aren't outrageous. ign is oldage
---
I thought so but I just wanted to make sure. Thank you!
---
Do you not read release notes at all? Or do we have to read them for you?
---
That was cool! That song screams endorphin fueled rage in a way perfectly suited to POWER ARMOR!
---
Look for a post from yesterday that hit the front page, a guy that pulled data from the game and mapped everything.. including the 3 places that spawns. If you can't find it let me know, I've got it saved.
---
I‚Äôll pay you 300 caps to
---
Make me 3 I don‚Äôt care about searching down the stuff
---
I found her sitting and looking at the cat painting.  After repeatedly going to that billboard and never finding cats, it was a relief!
---
Lol watch the videos
---
**YES, but an EXPLOSIVE can NOT do LESS than a NON-EXPLOSIVE, that‚Äôs my point! Hard to understand?!**
---
Not just a clown outfit ,... it‚Äôs clearly THE clown outfit ü§£
---
Not needed. Fixed. They were doing more damage than the stated amount. They fixed it so it does the damage they were supposed to be doing. (Displayed one damage amount but actually did a significantly higher amount of damage. Not now.)

---
I bought the possum but don‚Äôt have the tadpole plans. I can‚Äôt make the pack. I guess I won‚Äôt be making the pack until my wrist heals
---
I'll try that.
---
It's super frustrating server hopping hoping for a spawn. 
---
Especially when I need that spawn to unlock new content like the back pack.....
---
Already saw. It's still the wrong colors stripes or not.
---
SAME WEAPON, SAME ENEMY
---
Bwahahaha. My buddy have also threatened me to call PETA
---
Wrong. Many mmos would have simply removed the duped items.
---
They spawn all over the place. I bought a new pro snap deluxe camera from another player for a lot of caps and then wouldn't you know it I got four broken versions in my misc tab now lol ;)
---
Pistols and shotguns sounds simple and easy to setup. I have a Big Iron pistol build that uses rifles as a back up. So shotguns would be a perk and special swap. 
---
Head over to nukes and dragons to plan out the build.
---
That is only on the high capacity mod for the backpack.
---
Who downvotes vendor searches? Really?
---
We‚Äôre just having fun here, relax
---
Yep, totally random
---
Took me a day and a half to find the damn fossils and finally came across someone who had saw something strange in a lake bed in the toxic valley.
---
I also have a heavy weapons build that is the bees knees.  It's fun blowing things up with big guns.
---
Welcome to the QOL changes they really need make,  or rework when it comes to the passive perks and the way you think they work and the way they actually work and for furthermore even having to quit them because it's getting pretty redundant have to swap out all these perks
---
Thanks I was just checking
---
If you want to use a gauss rifle you can use Batteries Included to reduce the weight of the 2mm ammo. It also has the nice benefit of reducing fusion core weight. That‚Äôs handy for me since I use a vats crit build. I burn through fusion cores when I enter a radiation zone so I tend to keep about 15 on me at any given time.
---
Make them plans you get from sbq, sheepsquatch, etc. But give us more dwellers a viable option please.
---
Not being able to build under stairs is frustrating me currently.  A blueprint that has worked fine since November doesn't work because my bed is under the stairs.
---
Rhododendron is for fluorescent flux though :/
---
Found an example by doing a really quick Google search comparing explosive and non explosive rifles.
---
The two shot rifle shoots 2 bullets: the first has deals the actual damage of the weapon, the second deals base damage.
---
An explosive weapon also "shoots" 2 bullets: the first deals the actual damage, the "other" deals explosive damage equal to 15... whicn can be doubled and become 30 after demolition expert... am I right so far?
---
So... unless the base damage of a two shot rifle, after all perks is inferior to 30... (impossible??) explosive weapons should always deal inferior damage... really inferior.¬†
---
-----
---
Another Google search
---
Explosive weapons aren't OP off the bat.
---
With no Perks in explosives, their damage is low, their spread is negligable, but they still have high cripple damage and high stun percentage, making them strong suppression weapons.
---
---+
---
So, explosive will not automatically do.more damage than a non explosive unless the right perks, mutations etc are combined with it.
---
What do you have equiped that makes explosives stronger?
---
You can server hop watoga as there are 4 magazine spawn sites. Just make sure not to pick up a magazine you don‚Äôt want or you have to wait for the reset
---
Amazing. Works. But the 50/50 chance is f*cking me at the minute
---
It took me until March to learn the Y thing for cap collector.  Had it maxed out and lost out on oh so many caps lol.  The laughter in my friends voices when they realized I didn‚Äôt know.  Hahaha
---
Wouldn't be too hard to make, don't start over just keep leveling up. After lvl 50 you can move S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points around skim through your perk cards when you get a level and see what can be applied to a sniper rifle. I am thinking rifleman perks, sneak attack bonus, the holding breath longer while aiming, things like that. A lot of that is in Action perk cards and some in Perception. Just write down what perk cards you want to save points for and see how it goes.
---
The frustrating thing is that there's a bunch of great ideas about how to deal with this and they really just need to *pick one*.
---
My personal favorite atm, is to give all the crafting and utility cards some optional min requirements. If you meat them, they become passively active.  
---
Ie, if your Int is at least 3, the first rank of hacker becomes active. If it's 6, the 2nd rank, 9 for the third. 
---
Do the same with lockpicking.  
---
Do the same with hard bargain and the rest of the utility stuff. 
---
That way we don't just automatically get ALL the things, but if your character is THAT smart, or THAT strong or THAT nimble, some things will just come naturally.
---
What would be interesting is deciding if it should be based on raw stats... or raw stats + mutations + statuses .. that could make consumables *really* important.
---
Lady janets soft serve also has some hotdogs on a grill
---
if you're looking for the scorchbeast meat I find it easier just to hunt level 50's around wataoga at the Fissure sites I normally can get enough to make a grinder with in about 10 to 20 minutes but you have to have the right tactics to be able to ground the scorchbeast quick enough and kill it before it takes off if you can do that you can chain kill scorchbeast with Relative ease.
---
Pro tip make sure to use super duper when you are cooking and if you can I try to cook a lot of a different things before I craft a high-level item or high  ingredient item to potentially get those super duper proc
---
there, that's a good start. also is capslock  and attitude toward others really necessary?
---
  there are __so many variables__ , especially on a weapon that has multiple projectiles per shot that need to be taken into account you really need to provide a large list of details.  
---
people on the sub like to be helpful, but without specifics it makes it very difficult.
---
It came up for me when I did it alone!
---
Or are loaded when you travel or craft.  Combat does happen in buildable areas. But if you're at a bench or in building mode.. yeah.. they should be loaded x.x
---
It seems to happen with two players or less. Makes the event go much quicker.
---
Unfortunately I barely remember Virtua Fighter. I had MK and Injustice on my rig. Also have the Street Fighter collection on my Switch

I find one (lvl 50) almost everything I go to Top of the World. He is hanging out near there.
---
Build it right and you can sneak right you to a deathclaw and tickle him, which I think that's a quest.
---
I never said anything about fallour 76 being able to do that.   I was just saying how lucky you are to have way points.  Even with fallout 76 way points I still don't understand what they want me to do because of the lack of information. 
---
We live in a different time and place now where everything is made super simple and you don't actually have to try anymore. Things like broken way points can seriously hinder your progress unfortunately.
---
 I remember games taking 4 months to a year to get Max level, miss those days.  These days if you can't get to Max level in 2 days people bitch and moan that it takes to long.
---
 Didn't mean to upset you I was on a pre coffee rant this morning that's all. My apologies.
---
Ooo I know the one, I was there this afternoon, the photo would only work from a certain angle for me but luckily I got there in the end lol
---
And we should get her quest through her radio station :o
---
Do you have max sneak? I get milk every time if I sneak up on them and milk them while hidden or cautioned
---
What if somebody's already done and pick them all up or is it player based?
---
Yeah it really is. I keep having to switch out picklock perks all the time. I think Bethesda is just trying to figure out how to make passives work with their current perk system...atleast I hope they are lol
---
As for weight reductions, Pack Rat, Strong Back, Traveling Pharmacy, Bandolier for ammo, Batteries Included, so something like this: 15 Str, 6-9 Per, 9-12 Int, 6-9 Agil, 5-8 in luck and the others you can fill in afterwards.
---
Thanks....it was right where you said it was!
---
I've been playing all morning and just spent 30 minutes server hopping. 
---
Fuck this. I've had infinite patience for this game, I'm gonna go play Rocket League.
---
I'll spend 4 hours looking for a camera to unlock new content some other time.
---
I  was thinking the same thing that they wanted to keep the perks separate so people couldn't exploit things till they figured out how to make everything work correctly given the way the game launched.
---
Thanks, it was right where you said it was...
---
If you're melee you'll already have lots of points in Strength I assume.. So if you transition into sniper you'll free up room in Strength by taking off your melee cards and replace them with weight reduction perks. For Perception you'll want all 9 ranks of rifleman and either max Concentrated Fire or Tank Killer. From there you'll either want lots of Agility with some Luck, or some Luck and lots of Agility depending on whether or not you're going VATS heavy.
---
Sorry I didn't pick up on that. You really never know in this game. A friend came across a guy at level 82 that didn't know how to switch perk cards so nothing surprises me.
---
I got one for imposter event last night
---
Reverend, you're preaching to the choir..lol. Best of luck.
---
Oof I'm sorry to hear that friend. Hopefully player vending is helping you recoup some of those lost caps Haha
---
Will do! Thanks for the tips :)
---
HaHa I sold one for 35 caps and I wasn‚Äôt sure if that was too much (10 caps for the hat) üòÇ
---
You dupe it.
---
Both?  If another player picks it up first obvious it won‚Äôt be there but if you grab something you‚Äôll reset your personal timer. 
---
Also,  now that I think about it there are at least potential 7 spawns I‚Äôm aware of... I usually can find a couple that other people have missed if I run through there
---
Dude honestly. Since update I've played about 7 hours and have yet to do any actual thing beyond tinkering with my camp, moving its location, and fiddling with my stash and vending
---
Same here, except for me it's Tumblers Today.
---
Magazine finding perk, wear it at all times.
---
I think (not 100% on this) if you do the campfire event plus both daily quests it give you a much higher chance of getting a badge. I got a badge 4 out 5 times doing it this way. might just be lucky tho.
---
It is haha, I‚Äôm pretty flush with caps cause my cap stash runs (now, not before üòÇ) get me 4-6000 caps.  It helps to buy ALL the plans from players!
---
Well poop.
---
Lol how do you leave the vault cockily?
---
I wasn't playing actively around that event, but it was avaible in the Fasnacht Event. After some googling, it seems to be really, **really** rare. And since there was a huge duping some time ago again, many people have the plans now and sell it for a lot of caps.
---
Yeah, it's a common bug since launch. It has happened to me a few times.
---
A community leader badge
---
No problems haha I enjoying clearing the sky of those pesky bats
---
yep heavy duping since the last patch :(
---
I had my camp in the mire by the medical skeleton factory and there would be a 1 in 3 chance of me spawning in either via fast travel or login and have 3 scorchbeasts attacking my camp. The reaction might have been oh crap 3 months ago, now it was like dammit! Gotta clear them out AGAIN!?!?
---
What about Holotapes? For those of us who like everybit of story (and maybe find holotape games)
---
I've consumed all of my mount plans sadly
---
It's happened to me before when I was there for a quest. Died and my items were nowhere to be found.
---
I agree! While specialization and "specs" are an important part of any multiplayer game, but the current implementation of the cards for these is very poor. 
---
They need to do something to separate out passive or trade skill based skills or perks from the "active" ones.
---
I know, and I'm a day one player. Although I haven't invested in Butcher's Bounty until yesterday for this challenge so that's kinda why...and I mostly play solo :P
---
Mr fuzzy tokens, plans I don‚Äôt have, and fusion cores,
---
If i can figure out how to upload it i have a screen shot of a feral ghoul that looks like it is doing ballet the best part about it which you can't get from the screen shot was the classical radio that was playing in the background. I will try to upload when i get home.
---
Oh neat, I'll have to go farm one, thanks!
---
Can't be since they were selling the plans and plans didn't drop for making the masks. Maybe the plans were duped after it was found but that means Old Man Winter mask has a blueprint you can get.
---
It is the pool on the East side, it has a steam geyser in it. Starts shallow and gets deeper with blue fans in the deep end.
---
Thats not a bug with the terminals, those terminals were once a method to dupe
---
Saw a player wearing one the other day for the first time. I wondered how that was possible.
---
The modus thing is because of dupers. People use to sell then team mate buys it at another terminal don't know how it works exactly but glad it got patched.
---
Can't speak for everyone but I prefer the battlefield at V9 to the BoS encampment. More wide open, more room for people to perch on the fence, and none of the eroded gullies to deal with.

I also got it last night on Xbox, the pip-boy says it reduces spoilage by 60%, which seems correct. After I got it last night, I wanted to test it so I picked all my crops, cooked some soup, and figured I'd work on my camp for a bit to test how much it really helps. After about an hour and a half or so of working on my camp, I checked and neither my ingredients or my cooked food had even began to lose condition. Also, I kept fermantable liquor in my inventory and it's condition bar hadn't moved as well. I'd definitely say it's worth the weight reduction if you're a wasteland foodie. If anyone wants to test if for themselves, my Gamertag is: Oliver Klohzof, I'll gladly craft the mod for anyone who wants to try it.
---
No one actually got it from the Fasnacht event.
---
Live and learn. And google before bringing the heat.
---
It‚Äôs the only one I believe.
---
The perk system is a compromise between crafting, damage output/mitigation, condition management, and resource gathering, allowing for people to do all of those things without permanently shutting themselves out of any of those abilities.
---
That being said:  crafting should be handled separately from the perk system.  I would love for there to be quests in order to learn how craft level 5 guns or melee weapons or energy weapons.  
---
You could even make them faction specific:  the Enclave offers energy weapon crafting skill quests, BOS offers Power Armor, Responders offer guns and melee.
---
False on xbox i trade with a guy who got it from the event it was a funny experience
---
You have to craft the frog habitat within your building mode. I think is is under floor displays
---
Stealth sniper or melee
---
We call him hot toddy in my house.
---
Well yes i know that but they fixed it some patches ago but now after this weeks update and release of pioneers it seems to occur again
---
I thought about having all but one at a discounted price. Sort of to imply that normally it costs xxxx caps. Since nobody is gonna buy it at the higher price. The whole price management system is pretty frustrating as is
---
It basically what broke PvP.  Sure there‚Äôs mechanics that need tweaked but it was pretty fun in the early days until everyone got a god tier weapon/complete armor set.
---
If your not part of of the problem, your typically the one getting 1 shot.
---
Those are relatively easy to obtain during a white spring nuke event.  It‚Äôs the glowing/hardened mass that may not drop as frequently.
---
THat said, the bonus is if flux goes inert, you can drink it.
---
Yes, but it's pretty common knowledge that fluorescent flowers don't really occur in nature and I didn't want to give away too early that I was messing with her lol violet flux seems more realistic, since flowers often occur in nature as a violet color :D
---
Awesome thanks I was on the west wall were it's painted on the high brick wall. Gonna look for it right now TY
---
Ya know, before seeing the second comment I was like "Why is this poor guy getting downvoted so hard." Clicked the hidden next comment and my first thought was your post. "Oh that's why, one of those people."
---
Excuse me?
---
I‚Äôve been crafting x-01 and excavator legs and adding calibrated shocks to them to sell to make caps. It‚Äôs been going really well and not only profits me but also saves the people buying them a bunch of caps because they don‚Äôt have to buy the plan. If you do that too you‚Äôll be helping other people out and making bank.
---
Haven't gotten a damn badge from it and I've play it probably 8 times. The other collecting neither. Those take way too long to grind
---
Concrete and Lots Of Wood
---
If you drug the Mothman his eyes should randomly change colors.
---
That one is more understandable. It used to work passively without having to search. I can't remember which patch changed cap collector.
---
I‚Äôve been trying that, I have like 8 of them now still not registering none of them
---
I have not had that issue.  But I have lost my addictions when I took a grape mentats
---
I'll send you an invite as soon as I get back on, my gt is vegitastorm
---
He does a lot of production so you may not hear his voice, but his influence.
---
I‚Äôd love to, but unfortunately I used all of my Violet Flux on my first one and even had to buy a few so I could craft it. I rarely have time to launch nukes and most players sell flux for an amount too high to make money off of
---
Now if Astrid would have said "No, I'm sorry ... but you could make Fluorescent Flux" that'd have been hi-larious
---
Blueprint a simple base with a vending machine, generator, and stash box and just deploy it wherever you want.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve been server hopping every so often hoping to catch a nuked Whitesprings event, but haven‚Äôt had any luck so far. (And I can‚Äôt successfully solo nuke launch just yet so I‚Äôm sort of at the mercy of the fates.) But thank you for the tip! üòä
---
I think I may have seen your camp yesterday. Are you on PC? Selling them for something like 2500 or 3000 caps each?
---
You have to jump off the pipe into the shallow part
---
It's Reddit why would I do that?
---
Yeah that was my first long term spot, lead and junk and toxic water with mere steps to the hunter's lodge
---
Do yiu need the water revive too still?
---
TIL
---
I didn't really take that into consideration. I looked it up after I commented in classic internet asshole fashion.
---
That took a while, sorry!
---
At least allow me.to shut them up, Grafton mayor is killing me with the new scouts quests
---
I find them in ghouls all the time.
---
It was never truly fixed. I've had it happen with an automatic tesla rifle after patch 6, and multiple times after patch 8. I haven't had it happen after the most recent patch but that's only because I've been actively avoiding using my quad automatic tesla
---
Sorry that 50/50 was a guess. No science behind it. I felt like I did about 20 cows before I got it.
---
Adding :)
---
Omg that question! I googled each option for the natural look e.g leather graining, leather caning etc to see what google had to say........ well I had a shock when leather caning brought up nothing more than self called ‚Äúpunishment porn‚Äù websites. I bet someone at Bethesda was laughing their socks off putting that proposed answer in thinking just wait till they google that lol üòÇ
---
It's the only one sadly. And it's completely useless because every single LMG in the game comes with a muzzle break attached. There is no other mod for that slot, you can't even have a "no upgrade" there
---
Been there, done that, got the downvotes. It happens.
---
Eh that's a quick 10 minute one there.
---
I got up to level 25 in beta and had to redo everything before it.
---
It's fine man, I really appreciate the help
---
This is bugged yes- it does not count
---
Quit hording my friend, do you really need all those missiles, and fusion cores. If you have ore refine it to scrap then bulk. The weight reduction cards help alot too.
---
I'm not sure I'd do both pistols and shotguns - you're going to run out of points quickly. Without AGI 15, you're not going to even bother seeing pistols keep up - and only then if you're also pushing luck or have tons of explody pistols and are also rocking demo expert. That won't leave a lot of points for making shotguns good.
---
I'd pick one theme and start moving your existing character to it, and a second and start working the new character up with that in mind. Use the planner and it should help tell you how to pick the right perks and when.
---
I enjoy sarcasm
---
Well that was a little bit longer than 20 mins. Sorry the traffic was bad. Add me - dignite
---
Haven‚Äôt done that challenge yet so I‚Äôll check it out, thanks :)
---
That's definitely a good idea, but moving your camp costs caps, plus for my camp I have a really cool church I built out in the mire that I wouldn't want to lose
---
(1) Yes
---
(2) It's nice to be complaining about things like this rather than other things
---
Is this why the servers were so slow last night?
---
Tell me about it
---
They should at least switch to the Nukashine blue.
---
I‚Äôve had it happen twice since they said they fixed it. Once a few weeks ago with an explosive shotgun and today with an explosive flamer on the sheepsquatch robot.
---
Guess Bethesda lied. Shocker!
---
New duping method came with this last patch. Careful trying to get one from someone through reddit, though. Crazy ass ban wave happening in the market
---
I don't know if it's been already mentioned but the second box can be found northwest of the Flatwoods around the Relay Tower EM-B1-27.
---
You should be exploring the forest - there a lots of places to check out - and doing events the events there.  
---
That help get some XP to level up.  You will also learn a lot bout the lore nd backstory for 76.
---
Follow the overseers quest line.  In a couple more levels you should be able to roam up north where the alligator is on the map (toxic valley). 
---
@ 30, head towards the bottom/black area of the map (ash heap).  You can travel via the western side of the divide (middle of the map), but some areas will have critters that are too strong for you (they change levels depending on who else is in the area).  Change servers or revisit later.  For example, first time i did path of the wind, I was about L20, but my team mate was L60: his level caused  L48 mutants there, and I got my butt kicked.  Next time through I was solo, and the place was all L6 scorched.
---
Roses quest (which you get at Top Of The World), will take you to areas you are not quite ready for.
---
As will the Mysteries quest line.
---
Actually plan you can start the quests whenever, but dont go back fro the reward until L45 or 50. - the reward you get is based on your level when you claim the reward, and you do want them to be a higher level.
---
Depending on your weapons and perks, you can do a whitesprings run around L27 or so.  It will be difficult but it is possible, and you‚Äôll get some decent weapons for the level,
---
The scout badges have helped a lot, I've had fun picking away at those, but they are one-shot, so once I'm done that's it.
---
I like the weekly 'pic these critters in this region' photo challenges too, because they're relatively low stress, can just wander the wilderness and don't have to worry about annoying extra conditions, or competing for kill credit if you're playing with your mates.
---
Let me know when you've got a shop going so I can give you some business!
---
What is the HC mod bump the carry weight to?
---
Anyone think it could have something to do with vault 51?
---
So from everything I've read about the data mine on these boxes indicates that these are the only two boxes for now.
---
Been looking for new people to play with! Adding (:
---
Why not shotguns and heavy guns? Both of their damage perks are located in strength so you can swap out when needed. Shotgun and pistol wouldnt be bad either though as you could also run smgs through agility. Just max both of those out. Just depends on how you want to play it. If you max strength you can get max damage from heavy, shotgun, or melee. Max perception it's either semi or auto rifles. Max agility is pistol and SMG. Or you focus heavy on one and get a little in the other. I run max rifles and a little heavy or shotgun depending on my mood for the day with my main. My second is either melee or heavy but is more situational.
---
http://imgur.com/a/u4WYEqd not sure if you can see this, but yeah, it doubles the carry capacity
---
What would be "helpful" to you?  Be your best friend for ten years, get to know your tastes in and out, look at your household budget, and do an assessment for you personally with charts and graphs?
---
You've missed the point entirely.  NO ONE CAN DECIDE BUT YOU WHETHER OR NOT IT'S WORTH IT TO YOU.
---
Thanks a lot dude!
---
Don‚Äôt be scared of EATT members. We love people!
---
What plans dont you have?
---
That's a lot of carry weight already without the backpack so I would go for the amour, but for myself I would go for the extended backpack cause I only have 2 strength :P
---
He could have been grinding at multiple power stations, I have around 100
---
No I sell them for 1500-2000 but I am on pc. My camp is on the WS golf course.
---
That‚Äôs a bummer, thanx for confirming
---
Just back off to the lower-level areas (Forest &lt; Toxic Valley &lt; Ash Heap). Stick to events rather than quests, maybe take some workshops for XP and free meds.
---
Were the prices good? Why worry?
---
Cool, then say that. Don't go into a longwinded discussion after making the title that you did. Typical clickbait rofl
---
\+120 carry weight (or 60 more than the standard level 50 backpack), -60 ER, -60 RR. The standard backpack gives me 380 carry weight, so the HC would give me 440. Armored is +90 DR, -30 carry weight (so the net carry weight of the level 50 armored backpack is +30, giving me 350).
---
I get it from my grandma lol
---
It's not just tool boxes. I got them out of other containers as well as a supermutant. Yes they we're deluxes.
---
No problem and yeah it‚Äôs frustrating
---
Oh I've had 60 at a time just from one day sitting in my base and occasionally porting back to a station to pick up cores. But over 5000 is a bit curious... not to mention weighing 15000 pounds in stash.
---
They were overall decent. I guess if he/she had been selling dozens of identical TSE or the like it'd be worth saying something, but maybe you're right.
---
I sit at the table when its time for a break. You guys should join me! Also build a table and chairs so i can afk in your base and be safe while i make a bite to eat.
---
Or they'll sell this in the atom store somehow
---
Hell ya man! I'll add you when I hop on later!
---
It damaged the limb itself, not extra damage to their  health if that's what your testing.
---
Unfortunately not, least not effectively. The prompt to inspect currently never works except for a few occasions
---
I'm asking 2k for my collection of white fedoras.
---
I have an instigating three star on Xbox. Won‚Äôt be on til later though
---
My favorite thing about juicehead is he keeps reporting on fallout like he's playing it but uses footage from beta. 
---
Make sure you hit that like button and if you want to see more subscribe!
---
Well played.
---
Yeah wut.  How do they have it listed???? I can barely list the stuff already in the stash because my stash is too full to list the things that were in my stash.  Some sort of exploit for sure if they can list thousands of fusion cores
---
iirc the mosaic floor was a limited time item after launch
---
You're welcome! Have fun!
---
To be fair there aren't any "you sure you want to buy this" type secondary prompts in the atom store and the inspect and purchase opt in are the same button so its fairly easy to buy something on accident.
---
With the way it is it doesn't hurt to check into a refund, if it's too much hassle then I wouldn't worry about it but if simply asking got the purchase reversed its worth a shot imo
---
Shame I‚Äôm on pc I would have given it to ya
---
Thanks. I think I'm leaning toward armored. The HC might be nice for legendary farming, but with legendary scrapping maybe I'll be good. Armored would still give me more carry weight than my PA and put my stats closer too.
---
fifth floor, just to the left coming out of the stairwell, there‚Äôs a cafe sign with ‚Äúpioneer scouts sign in‚Äù and a paper pinned to it
---
(hornwright HQ, idk about garrahan yet)
---
BETHESDA ate my TODD HOWARD
---
Maybe they are friends with the person I saw with 1k in leader bobble heads.
---
Such a shame I missed my opportunity, I really liked it. Didn't even check the store at the beginning since I was busy exploring.
---
Well, that my mind made up. Thank you.
---
They're extremely practical though. As ugly as they are, they are the most optimal build from a gameplay perspective.
---
Yeah you‚Äôre probably right.
---
Also of you add the stabilized mod for both arms (if possible) holding your breath becomes irrelevant :)
---
You're welcome üòÄüëç
---
yeah i‚Äôm the same. it‚Äôs for that reason that i‚Äôve been very hard pressed to get the rider paints asap as they come out cause i love em and don‚Äôt wanna miss em
---
maybe in the future bethesda will make em available again for a limited time, hopefully. that‚Äôd be cool
---
I appreciate it!
---
Saw you, adding

Its not in the palace persay. Follow the waters edge around the pond and follow the cliff edge. Youll see the archery target. And table next to it
---
&gt; I'm struggling to read the rest of this because this is like the opposite of why people like FO76.
---
That makes no sense. 
---
&gt; The biggest complaint I've seen is that it's not like the past Fallouts,
---
That was the biggest complaint before the game even came out.  Things have evolved since then.
---
&gt; just like they said about FO4. 
---
Lol.  They also said that about FO3.  Do you not see the pattern here?  Let me spell it out for you:  The definition of what a Fallout game is *changes every time there's a new Fallout game*.   No matter what changes, there will always be people who say *"It's not like the other ones."*  It's pointless to put a thumbtack in that, but I suppose I could say *"If you're looking for a game exactly like [X] then go play [X]."*
---
&gt;Plus you have it as a plus if you like playing alone but a minus if you don't like being lonely.
---
You were correct when you said that you were struggling to read it.  I didn't list ANYTHING as being a Plus or a Minus.
---
I said that you MIGHT like it if you like playing mostly alone.  You MIGHT NOT like it if you get LONELY easily.  "Playing alone" and "Feeling lonely" are not the same thing.  In my experience, this game can feel more lonely than, say, Fallout 4 did.  If you're cool with that, you may be cool with this game.  If you're not, you may not be.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Before this update finding another player wasn't a common thing, like there were weekly posts complaining about it feeling so much like a single player game because you weren't coming across other players often.
---
Exactly - some people preferred that experience and some people didn't.  If you like that experience, you might like FO76.  If you don't, you might not.
---
&gt; Like honestly not trying to be rude but this is basically
---
&gt; "If you like MMORPGs and the Fallout series then Fallout the MMORPG is perfect for you."
---
That may be what you took from it, but it is not what was said.
---
&gt; There is a lot of cherry picking in this post trying to ignore the negatives in FO76. Like a lot of people have been reporting more crashes after the most recent update. You changed it to "A small percentage". 
---
How is that cherry picking?  It IS a small percentage, based on what I have observed.  If you have empirical data to the contrary, please share it.  But seeing as how you can't even interpret ONE POST correctly, I'm going to trust what I've seen more than what you think you've seen.
---
&gt;There are still bugs from the beta in game. You changed it to "No game is flawless".
---
Your mind works in bizarre ways.  Both of those statements are true.  It's not a "change."  
---
Forget beta - there are still bugs from Fallout 4!  Maybe from before that, but I can think of two off the top of my head that were in Fallout 4.  The statement "No game is flawless" still applies.  Some people have been singling out this game and holding it to a higher bug/glitch standard than the previous Fallouts which were always buggy, so I think it bears repeating that there will always be bugs in it.
---
&gt; Here's a much easier way to determine if FO76 is for you.
---
&gt; Is it $30? Do you like MMOs? Does repetitiveness not bother you? Then try FO76.
---
Why $30?  I spent more than that on dinner last night and I've already shat out the remains.  I spent $50 on Fallout 76 at launch, bought it again on PC for $12 and bought a pack of Atoms for $40.  That's $102.  I think it's been worth every penny.  TO ME it has.  Because I like the things that this game has to offer, and $102 is not that much money to me.
---
Which is the point, distilled down ---- if you like [these things] and the price is reasonable TO YOU, then sure.  But only you can determine this.
---
Gt: we r arsons
---
But... there are no active raiders... anywhere...
---
ah thank you, completely missed that. it‚Äôll probably be similar at garrahan HQ so i‚Äôll take another look around there, at least now i know what to look for
---
It is not even crops. It it the other building items in the build menu for your CAMP
---
Hey, I'm really sorry but I won't be able to get on tonight. More computer trouble. Would you be available over the next week at all, particularly on thursday/friday/Saturday?
---
It's not from a full stash as other people are saying. It affects budget and it seems it can push you not just to max, but beyond it. I deleted some objects in workshop and I'm still at max budget.
---
no prob! yeah i imagine it‚Äôs a similar station, i just don‚Äôt know where it is üòÇ
---
best of luck!
---
Thank you for this!!
---
You can make fusion cores weigh .03 pounds and carry 1000 @ 30 pounds on your person. Not sure if you can sell direcly from your inventory. Although acquiring 1000s of cores is suspect.
---
Yes, clickbait.  Because I stand to gain SO MUCH from someone reading my post on Reddit.  Truly.
---
Since this post got viewed, I was able to pay off my mortgage.  My dog's broken leg magically healed itself.  People look at me differently on the street.  There's an air of respect.  They call me "Sir."  I was able to sit at the best restaurant in the city last night without a reservation.  All thanks to people reading this thread.
---
I'm glad I could make you ROFL though.  I hope you vacuumed first.
---
He clearly said at launch that he didn't like the game, but he needed the views it brings so he would still make videos about it.
---
Just your average hypocritical youtuber.
---
Lol hundo p. Must've missed some on the first day
---
I don't think You can trade backpacks
---
You can make them weigh 0.3 pounds (Batteries Included doesn't stack with Bandolier iirc) and you can't sell from inventory. It MUST be in your stash.
---
That's right! I forgot about him saying that. Tha k you for reminding me why he is a dingus.
---
I don't know if creating a second character works. I don't have the "discover locations in the mire: valley galleria" yet I finished the camera quest on all 4 characters, 3 of which were made after the beta. (Of course)
---
The discover locations challenges are bugged.
---
Some unlock done don't.
---
OP is specifically referring to the leaving the vault achievement.
---
I was playing survival yesterday. I went to my camp found a lvl 35 buying shit. Naturally I did my best South Park ‚ÄúOMG ITS COMING RIGHT AT ME‚Äù and killed him, stole my chems back and put them back in the store
---
It definitely feels that way, seeing how people got over level 100 during the first week and the maps player level display used to be clipped and hide the third digit...
---
I use a mod to play as a ghoul in fo4 so for me my fo76 character is the same person. Dropping the nuke to kill the scorchbeast queen caused them to turn, at which point they left Appalachia in fear that their fellow vault dwellers would turn on them.
---
it's literally part of the game, and it's meant to happen, and people should stop complaining about it. It's JUNK and the vast majority of it can easily be replaced. And if you are carrying around heaps of junk because you can't fit into your stash then you either have way to much junk you aren't even using, or are hoarding weapons and armor you aren't using.
---
Stop asking for a new pony if you haven't finished eating the one in front of you.
---
Who cares? Apparently, he just spouts off nonsense, and jumps the gun with info, using his "logical" guesses (I use that term VERY loosely). I've honestly never watched that junk myself.
---
I just found one in a red toolbox at Scenic Overlook.  Gonna repair it and use it for the night vision lens if I ever get it.
---
Search buildings as well.  They're around, but they spawn randomly.
---
Yes it was a nerf under the ‚Äòbug fix‚Äô disguise. And it always works, average joe would accept anything if you tell them it‚Äôs a bug fix. 
---
That being said you need to realize all AA does is IGNORING 50 percent of armor, it doesn‚Äôt do anything extra if your target has no armor to begin with, like animals. Mutants is a flat 10% extra so it does more base damage than AA. 
---
Your finding seems to suggest that the explosive part deals less damage than the 10% mutant‚Äôs bump. I‚Äôm not surprised because explosive shotguns WERE nerfed by the TSE nerf, now they just added another 80% nerf on top of previous nerf and called it ‚Äòbug fix‚Äô. That leaves us with 20%x20% at approx 4%, which is less than the mutant‚Äôs 10%.
---
If they're on XBox and their prices are ridiculously low, you can report them directly to me.
---
Any perk that doesn't affect combat should be able to be passively equip as long as the rank cost fits in the SPECIAL stat level it gets equip in. The current system already supports it but just has an annoying step of equipping the perk and then unequipping it after.
---
PC... but I like yer moxie, kid! ;)
---
Take my upvote. I‚Äôve been asking for months. Maybe they will run a one day sale again one day
---
LOL, I hope you weren't looking at mine. lincolncs. I got tired of having to change it all the time.
---
BTW I am looking for a teammate, East coast USA, I am level 88, 57 yo who isn't quick.
---
Dang.
---
You tried
---
Yep, and it's worked for me every time. If you have any issues just keep server hopping
---
Take mine as well.
---
Ah nm then. I guess it's not too uncommon of a business. I'd probably build decked out power armors for other people if I had the stash space to store that
---
Building foundations were so annoying that it was just easier to build floating bases, and as others pointed out it prevents melee enemies from destroying stuff. It's basically a reflection of the terrible CAMP system Bethesda tried to put in, they tried to make the system so restrictive that pieces need to be connected and any terrain formation would prevent the bases from being built, but gravity had no say in that restriction so you could just make a flying base without any issue.
---
Agreed. It seems rather trivial that the main point of the game, "playing with your friends" is still something we can't actually do.
---
It's an interesting question of what you cut first from a rifle build, as there are so many different ways to boost damage. My first character was a utility-heavy build with zero VATS perks and no Covert Ops, which was actually fine solo with an Instigating lever rifle and AA handmade, but the damage output in a team wasn't great.
---
I think most players would want to keep some VATS perks or go Bloodied. Bloodied doesn't need many perks for a rifle build because you rarely get hit. Either way, you can drop some 5% rifleman points if you need them, although if you're playing VATS-heavy then the accuracy may be a problem. I don't rate Covert Ops because it's a best-case optimisation.
---
LOL. Nice shot!
---
after you find one off the tourist they randomly spawn, i have like 4
---
People have been asking for this since the beta.  (Search the words "deck" or "loadout" on this forum.)  Bethesda has shown no indication that they're going to add it.  It would be nice though.
---
Has this been tested?
---
Idk why it wouldn't work like all other items: want to craft it yourself? Grind or shell out for it. Have a friend who knows the mood? Just have them do it.
---
I tried to milk the Flatwoods tenants but that didn't work. Anybody else able to do so?
---
So I just checked my stats again and I have the unlock level 10 achievement. I must have completed that during normal play. Bummer about the beta thing tho. I only have one character but I guess I can make another just to get that checked off since it‚Äôs kinda bugging me a little :)
---
It's a joke
---
Just create a new character and you will have that achievement in like 10mins
---
That would have been the very best thing, **EVER** lol
---
Yep.  I bought a house in WV a couple of years ago.  Almost every house I looked at had foundation issues due to being on a slope.
---
If you're on ps4 I have an extra
---
Because it's easier and faster than picking the correct spot that can actually lay your stuff down. Basically my buddy and I have a 'no floating C.A.M.P.s' rule, if we run across your place and use it a second, if it's floating, we trash it and eat the caps loss if you can kill us. 
---
Floating campers are the scum of the earth, just above dupers in terms of 76 cancer.
---
How about an easy way to complete this darn obstacle courses?!
---
Yes I understand most jokes. I was hoping for a creative explanation. :)
---
I've got over 500 ballistic fiber. Add me of on ps4, georgepluck. I'm a click north of Camp McClintock.
---
The enemies are invisible cuz they haven't loaded in yet
---
Nice :D
---
Revive a player in water during a radstorm after you took their picture with the Scorchbeast Queen in the background while you're leveling up.
---
The plans are for an effigy with the mask on it
---
trash cans, tool boxes, most junk containers. ive had to ignore picking up a lot of them, since i cannot sell or drop the broken ones to the ground
---
Odd that a post such as this wouldn't include pictures ;)
---
I don‚Äôt have the link on me but there should be a section on Bethesda website regarding reporting, check their forum. There‚Äôs probably a form you‚Äôd have to fill out. Screenshots would be good but I guess they can just manually check the players inventory. What baffles me is why they‚Äôre duping stuff to sell when they could just dupe Nuka colas. What baffles me even more is why they‚Äôre duping at all when people were banned for it in the past.
---
Haven't done it yet but do the Queen of the Hunt Daily quest. It sends you to kill a vengeful moth man according to Games Radar. It shouldn't run away.
---
Agreed.  I can spend an hour just poking around people's camps.  Then I remember the scout badges, dailies, material farming for what I am low on, atom challenges, inventory maintenance, legendary runs, etc.  Add in a but of exploring and it feels pretty darn good.
---
I would freaking love Caravan from NV in 76. It is such a fun way to make caps and you could play other players for stakes.
---
You've got me. Short or selling for dollars, pounds or drachmas, I don't see what anyone is gaining other than "sticking it to the game" or something along those lines.
---
It wont always be a mothman It can be any cryptid a wendigo, grafton monster, flatwoods monster,  snallygaster the mothman over never had it do the mothman yet but it can
---
Idk. A lot of people I've seen like to plant crops underneath so maybe it's to maximize the space they can use?
---
And the street vendor cart by the bandstand in Watoga.
---
...But it counts as an energy weapon for the purpose of the Grounded mutation penalty.
---
Right what D!#*$
---
You can not trade these.
---
Well that's dumb
---
The machine gun turrets currently are their exact right power level. You can build the NQ ones with no perks, the higher ones require more perks and the highest ones require the most perks. 
---
In terms of anti player effectiveness, they don't need any more boosting than they already have. The heavy laser turrets are costly in terms of materials and perks and BOY do they hurt when you line them up. The rocket turrets will stagger, confuse and straight up eliminate players. I have held off 3 enemy players solo by well placed turrets and constant rebuilding. They're very effective.
---
only pioneer scout code breakers are allowed in my home. if you can crack the code on the keypad door the entire camp does not have doors

You still on

:O
---
Can you name guns now?
---
That‚Äôs what I did, before I found my trick.
---
That was the best way for me. Thanks
---
It depends on your play style. If you‚Äôre a sneaky sniper, you wont get hit often so you could probably go with the HC. You should also go with the HC if you‚Äôre a hoarder like me. I‚Äôve been buying lots of stuff since vending came out so I can flip it for some extra caps and it doesn‚Äôt fit in my stash. I almost always have around 600 weight on me even with all the weight reducing perks.
---
If you‚Äôre Rambo, get the Armoured.
---
Unfortunately you can't sell or trade them, and they're destroyed if you drop them.
---
for sure man, i need the water one badly
---
Lost my op handmade. No legendary, but still, great...
---
Just ran into this. It's still happening apparently. There was a very high level partied with a very low level nearby (levels 1xx and 1x). Wonder if that was related?
---
Google the patch notes and announcements. This sub doesn't exist to constantly fill people in. It's for discussion between players who actually play.
---
Great.  PSN EggMustard
---
Same here! Vending is nice but I like that it puts my camp on the map so people can visit my house. I‚Äôm super proud of my most recent camp set up and it‚Äôs kinda neat to show it off in a way.
---
Maybe check the roadmap that is everywhere
---
Dang it! I could‚Äôve sworn my first sentence would‚Äôve saved me...
---
Hey so the part with all the redactions is found in a vault registry terminal inside VTU - just FYI
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure there is a broken one on the camera stand just inside Uncanny Caverns. There is a photo booth area inside the cave and down the stairs.
---
Dang it, I thought that first sentence would‚Äôve saved me...
---
Batteries included and 5 pieces of ammo weight reduction stacks. I wasn't sure about vendoring in inventory/stash. Good to know.
---
You‚Äôre right. Found it.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt understand why people lock them. It‚Äôs not like people can steal anything.
---
Its annoying seeing people who are too lazy to google on here constantly
---
Man, it's going to be annoying scrolling through that plan list every day.
---
From data-mining, all the Dense plans are listed for Ash Heap, Mire and Cranberry Bog vendors since the patch. Not sure how the probabilities work though, and it may be different on the server side.
---
I‚Äôve had this often pretty often. I‚Äôm convinced it knows.
---
As far as I am aware the camera will not spawn on the tourist again once you pick the first one up. I have gotten 4x broken deluxe cameras in my stash if you want one. I am on PC if that's any help.
---
I found my 'extra' broken cameras in dead npcs and the red tool boxes scattered about. It took an absolute age to find  them and strangley enough they only started spawning for me once I bought a camera off another player recently.
---
I mean no one has to watch his videos... but over all he does a good job of explaining stuff... he has said the background videos are from other people and he thanks those people... but I dont mind him
---
I guess that I find all of the "challenges" to be arbitrary and unsatisfying. I would rather go to a building or dungeon and have to kill everything, or search for something... General rpg stuff.
---
They spawn randomly into the world. Good Luck finding them all xD
---
ripüò≠
---
I fast travelled inside someone's camp...and they have lvl 3 door locks...which I'm not that high mainly cause I hate unlocking...such tedium.  So I couldn't get out...not a huge problem just an annoyance to fast travel away.
---
But when I come up on a locked door...I just move on. And judge them harshly...LOL
---
I server hopped the three that spawn near Top Of The World, had it done in Ten Minutes.
---
Random spawn with 400 possible locations
---
Appreciate the thought anyway! üòä
---
Wow that's awesome! Definitely going to start doing the event then :D
---
Lots of bug fixes, some new bugs, but that's something you're probably used to
---
There are a few new questlines, one of which involves the sheepsquatch and another the backpacks. The eggs are just decoration, if you got all 6 of them then you can craft yourself an easter bunny mask. Nukashine is one of the many new drinks that were added with an older update, but the reason that one is so special is it teleports you to a random part of the map after 2 minutes. It's fun but also requires nuka quantum to make, so it's a luxury to screw around with it
---
Ahh. Thanks for the clarification.
---
Can't wait to see all the new dupers get banned like the last ones did.  xD
---
Because folks don't want to see the floating cash register trade invite while they're trying to nap or repair their gear, lol
---
Give a man what he could Google, feed him for a day.  Teach a man to Google is worth two in the bush.
---
Yeah that's always been an issue, but it's happening more frequently and then when they do load they are still lying on the ground but zooming after me.  After about 5 minutes they fully loaded and are up and running around.  Then it crashes hahaha
---
I've got bug grenades I can give you! You throw them like Pokeballs to catch it! ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Thank you legend!!!! I seriously appreciate it.
---
Yeah, just found that out after logging in today, tried to make one for my buddy. Either way, the refrigerator is definitely worth it in my opinion.
---
So that guy with 2100 of the same bobblehead was probably a duper?
---
Only if you and everyone else agree to close them when you're done!
---
So last night me and a buddy did this one. We just took turns and jumped off a lookout point. Very quick and easy.
---
There just gonna do it on alt accounts and transfer everything over to there mains before they get banned so there's no winning anyway
---
It's not about stash space. It seems like some sort of budget leak, as it actually affects how much more you can build.
---
Have you got the quest called ‚Äú THE ORDER OF THE TADPOLE‚Äù active? If so try going to the exam area at the camp and completing one of the exams, maybe that will trigger it. If that doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôm at a loss and its probably a bug that still needs fixing.
---
Yep, it's actually caused a lot of problems with placing foundations, walls, ect. My gf decided she wanted a new camp location for the player vending so she packed up and moved. Now, when she places just about anything, it doesn't allow her to delete it. It's been such a problem with her she just stopped playing until they fix it, since building camps is her favorite thing in this game :/ very unfortunate, and hopefully they fix it soon.
---
If you had unlocked them you just would‚Äôve become wanted anyway. Fast travel is def your best bet in that situation.
---
If it‚Äôs not working, it‚Äôs a bug.  Beth doesn‚Äôt nerf a perk so it doesn‚Äôt work at all.
---
Given by the amount of drama and care put into your post and replies, I would say that you gain an awful lot psychologicaly from thinking you're providing the community a service. However, you don't gain respect when someone disagrees with you and you get butthurt.
---
It was fun while it lasted
---
No he grinded them bobbleheads bro dupings only a mythü§£ü§£
---
I had no idea.
---
BTW, I took [this photo of my character](https://i.imgur.com/lS7W7dJ.png) last night.
---
As far as I know they are pretty much random at magazine spots unfortunately (from all 100 odd magazines).
---
Also to further the difficulty: Magazine spots don't always spawn a magazine when the spot resets, someone else may have picked up from the spot.
---
Not sure on what the actual respawn time/reset rules are for them.
---
Watoga is a good spot for magazines, I think there's 8+, mostly in a couple of clusters.
---
One cluster is - top of watoga highschool roof, the monorail carriage next to it, a bus kinda below it on the other side of the footbridge.
---
Keep em locked...people can pick locks and destroy your camp
---
I spent way too much time on my camp and it's been in the same spot since the beta. Maybe it's time I move, but where I am has never been attacked.
---
If that doesn't work, go to places like Lewisburg, West Tek, and General Steakhouse that have a high chance of super mutant spawns, they frequently have skulls in their loot.
---
Kill him before he leaves?
---
Can everyone upvote this so more people see it in seeing be handmades going for 9 and 10k all day and iv seen atleast 7 or 8 today
---
Hence why there was the hotfix yesterday to fix it
---
I'd really like to visit your Camp, but sadly I'm on Ps4..
---
I have been psychoanalyzed by professionals before.  I don't need it from you, but thanks for the freebie anyway.
---
Probably someone already killed them. The area is pretty big, it covers the bank .
---
Guys they patched it yesterday
---
Agreed we need planters, I want a locked room inside my camp structure which I can have for internal harvesting.
---
They might have patched it but the weapons are still in rotation clearly
---
Totally agree with this. I'd hate to promote this... but what about a survival mode daily quest where you have to find camps and destroy them? (Or RAID them?) 
---
Although I'd believe people aren't too keen on thier shit being destroyed
---
I meant a nerf as in, lowered it's chance a lot. Like I said I have only seen it go off once in the last few days, maybe twice. I'm just trying to see how it's working for everyone else.
---
Ok. Cause thats all i need for the badge and no enemys were there
---
And here's me thinking the leatherwork badge was the one I could get...
---
Yeah, the weapon's mechanics are a mess.
---
Random request, could you make a map of all the cooking oil spawns? Want to make as many Fasnacht Donuts as possible. Amazing work!
---
I am interested in purchasing 4 stabilized Violet Flux. I am on Xbox let me know if you have them or you run across them.
---
Awesome Kajiit!
---
Thank you, I‚Äôll check
---
It's the perfect time to report people. You have their names that they can't change and you can see their inventories. Even if 5000 cores are legit, let Bethesda investigate and decide. He might have 10000000 more, like that 900 hours guy  with over 500.000 ultracite ammo.
---
Everyone on here has duped stuff. Unless you picked it up yourself I guarantee something in your inventory was duped. If it wasn‚Äôt for the dupers, 98% of us wouldn‚Äôt have AAE, FE, or TSE handmades, shotguns, and levers.
---
I have masks if you have cap!
---
The post-drowning revive is to get the Swimming Bagde. It's under the World section of the Challenge menu.
---
That happens to me sometimes at the whitesprings club house. I think it happens when the server is really old. As when ever I see it I don't see many other players in the map
---
thanks i‚Äôll check it out! looks like i won‚Äôt be getting this badge anytime soon:/
---
 He gets bored easily. You gotta keep him busy if you want him to stay around. ;)
---
Can you help me out with it still?
---
i‚Äôve been getting a lot of over spawning of mobs too, not all legendary though
---
Wish they'd dupe me some legendary combat armour pieces finding it very difficult to locate some good ones lol
---
The second he spawned he flew off o watched him land in front of me then fly off
---
I've been looking for the blue BOS jumpsuit for quite a while. How much caps would you want for it, if you do have it?
---
I'm really happy with the work they've done since launch. I love when they sneak something like Sheepsquach in without announcing it.
---
I will tonight as soon as I'm off work. Probably won't be able to play until Monday
---
0. Reclamation day soon :D
---
There's another requirement in the swimming badge challenge for "revive a player in water."
---
The second he spawned he flew off I watched him land I front of me then he flew off
---
Why Mr Fuzzy tokens? (Sorry, I don‚Äôt know what they are for/do.)
---
I think its fine, I have been on both ends. Mainly on the picking it up end. I am careful with my stuff and rarely have anything of value on me
---
I do! It's set in my vending machine for 5k
---
I have today opened pirateglenn1 PS4 shop at whitesprings station and I want to thank Bethesda for enabling the fact that I could build here. It's a superb location and although I have to deal with mole miners from time to time, my logic spans around many reasons for wanting to build here..I won't go into all of those reasons but I will say I really enjoy player vending and providing players with what they want.
---
Please do visit and also let me know on this thread the items you would wish for me to stock.
---
My prices are extremely competitive and in many cases superb for three star armours...
---
Come and have a look...pirateglenn1 on PS4
---
Ugh give me 25 min to get home
---
Aight
---
If you think that you know the answer to the "question on everyone's mind" and you don't share, you are being "very unhelpful". Of course I'm not even sure what you think that question is, and I doubt "everyone" has the same question.
---
Myself, I would have appreciated if they gave a brief summary of new content, or even links.. but I guess I've gotta go look it up if I really want to know. That doesn't mean they are helpful, that isn't their job.. they are only trying to contribute.
---
Add me Shearluck
---
It never procced often for me, so if it‚Äôs not popping at all, I‚Äôd call it a bug.  It wasn‚Äôt worth moving down due to its low inclination to pop and it didn‚Äôt repair an ungodly amount.
---
Thats awesome, love the enthusiasm!
---
Thanks for all the suggestions!
---
I've currently put together [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=ff33569&amp;d=sd2su2so2sp2s60s00sa0ls2lt2cu2pg2ph2pi2po2pp2al0ak0ad0au2ic4l90l00ee1&amp;w=s22sq2s32sr2pc2as2l71iq2in1i50im1if2i71i61ij2ii0i30ia0at1e60p80pa0p90e80&amp;n=Rohgoth's%20New%20Build&amp;m=) build, with the idea being I use shotguns early in the game, switching mainly over to heavy weapons towards the later stages. I'm thinking about making automatic rifles a focus, with mainly the 10mm SMG. And a few pistol perks on the side, just for lower level mobs mainly. Any suggestions to improve it would be greatly appreciated!
---
Lucky you!
---
Victoriam*
---
Whoops, it says 1. Meant to say 0.
---
Here we go again
---
Some people are pretty crazy with their prices. I tend to sell my stuff at rock bottom prices. Usually have a line leading out of my camp. Lol. I mean, id rather have a small amount of caps than hoarding it in my stash waiting for the right person.
---
I'll be off by then sorry
---
I actualy am on 16 badges in two days.
---
This has to be one of the most requested quality of life improvements I have seen since launch.
---
Does it still work?
---
It does
---
Still not fixed.. I have spent like 4hrs building my current camp and WONT DO IT AGAIN. Its been 4 fucking months.
---
Its rng i got 4 badges from running campfire event 6 times
---
I only have 3 points, didn‚Äôt notice any requirement for strength.
---
The new event randomly gives you a badge. Rare but it‚Äôs possible. Camp Adams one.
---
What I want is my turret kills to count as my kills so I get the xp and junk that they're carrying
---
Idk, what's with all the judgement of how other people enjoy the game?
---
If you're talking about possum badges, you can serve hop on camp Adams at night to trigger the campfire event that awards possum badges (not 100% chance).
---
Wait, forgot I took it out of my machine. Had it set for 5k, would like to keep it, but you're welcome to make an offer
---
Are you doing the running courses (they have a start button and checkpoint markers)  or trying to do the rope course near the big bridge that doesn't count?
---
Did you search them?  With spacebar, when they're dead already.  Have to activate Perk cards like that one, and it rarely doesn't give out meat at rank 3.
---
527 Time flies man i doesn‚Äôt feel like that much.
---
Approx 200, just hit level 50 last night. üëç
---
Why did you make the exact same thread as someone else?

---
It just leads you to the legendary scrapping machine.
---
I think it is talking about the legendary scrip machines.  The markers do not seem to work all the time via the terminal, it does not like to mark the locations for daily quests.
---
Just added you, but you are probably offline already. Well hopefuly next time.
---
1str on my alt (level 21) took a +1 str beer and bufftats for +3; didn't work for me.
---
It started back when your base would get demolished if joining a server where that spot was occupied because it is really hard to replace your entire blueprint on a new spot.
---
Why is it still around? No idea, it looks stupid.
---
I leave a bag with a single raw fertilizer on their doorstep.
---
How do you get the plans for the fertilizer producer?
---
Lots of ponds and lakes are buildable on and they are all flat.
---
You need 5 str and 5 agi to be able to complete the athletic badge. You can do everything else for it without them being at 5
---
I mean, you're complaining about me complaining so...
---
what‚Äôs the badge?
---
Gotcha. Thanks everyone!
---
Don't attack the prophets.
---
PC
---
Boourns I really dont want to waste 6 levels just to be able to complete this
---
I'm on now
---
Sell everything in your vending machine. Im having a hard time filling my stash since player vending dropped.
---
Graham is a traveling vendor super mutant.
---
Farm the Top of the World
---
I actually love the Baja, wish they'd bring it back.
---
When a Dwellers' tryna give it to ya drop him like he's hot, drop him like he's hot, drop him like he's hot.
---
I feel your pain! Still searching for the first 1. And it takes 5... I think this needs addressed.
---
Go show some love please
---
Didn‚Äôt know that. Maybe mine is buffed by a mutation and I didn‚Äôt realize it. I got the badge just fine.
---
Those rads tho...
---
Proof? If none, remove this for being a witchhunt.
---
Also the small ones go on fire places not sure if that was always a thing.
---
Completely random
---
Where do you find 8-9 brahmin in flatwoods? Aren't there just 3?
---
I‚Äôm making some supply runs if you want to join me. Psn is brm138
---
No go on any of these locations.
---
Its easier to spot... Daisycutter.
---
Been wondering the same thing with as much as I‚Äôm
---
Fast traveling around checking other vendors, haven‚Äôt seen anything show up directly after but also haven‚Äôt noticed anything disappear, definitely gonna be hard to answer this one
---
Where did you get the poster on the bottom right?
---
Really don't know what happened. My main has 3 agi, ate some +2AGI food and got the 5 agi for athlete completed.
---
Not sure what food would offer such a significant amount of STR buff.
---
I have proof on playstation and wont remove this since i want some publicity for this lovely dude
---
See i got this and my friend got this and all in common is that we were all doing trades!
---
What platform? If you're on Xbox, you can join the *Order of the Sheepsquatch* and I can help you üòÅ
---
Especially after the SBQ event. Soooo many lost corpses in the tall grass.
---
No those were all legit
---
Like in transferring to mules
---
Logging in now
---
Amen, was up til 4am just this morning. Where does the time go?
---
I am on pc unfortunately. Are there actually clans in this game?
---
Look at his reddit profile. üò±
---
Ugh still not in time
---
Now the real game begins, enjoy!
---
They're griefers who are looking to get free caps through easy PVP combat. If they enter the workshop and you're in bounds then you're both put into PVP against eachother regardless of pacifist status. If you're outside the workshop then they cant do anything to you unless you step in.
---
I‚Äôd actually spend money on that. 
---
Repair kits, not so much.
---
Haha, I was trying the rope course near the  bridge.. I just started the missions last night, and wasn't sure where to go for the challenges.. nothing is marked on the map
---
What I want to know is how Fred the Feral Forest Ranger kept his had on for 25 years.
---
Do you think that just before he completely lost his mind he stapled his hat to his head? 
---
Or do you think the feral ghoul still has enough wherewithal to pickup the hat if it should fall off?
---
As a counter point, I think adding repair kits is mainly useful for new players, and the fact that they are *useful* is good. The fact that they are inferior to the better repair kits that you can only get in game is great.
---
I'm not a big fan of "skins", and there's very few I liked enough that I "bought" them with the free currency I've earned. I wouldn't mind more useful things that are that cheap, especially if they're always available with earned atoms.
---
The argument that repair kits are remotely pay to win is a tired one, and completely false. It's convenient maybe, but with better ones in game you can earn, it's really no big deal.
---
Yup, saw it before trading and somehow i was dumb enough to go with the trade.
---
I think deathclaw steak is +2 I know cooked mole rat gives +1. Whiskey is +2 so I'll try some deathclaw and whiskey
---
All this does is mark the location of the nearest train station to you, if you've discovered it or not, to get you to the new legendary scrap machines.
---
BGS never asked me to contact MS, for what it's worth. I purchased items from the atom shop and never received them in-game. I asked them to just cancel the purchase outright and refund me the atoms as well as credit me atoms that mysteriously disappeared without any record of transaction. They were really nice about it and fixed it within 24 hours. Maybe it's just whoever you were talking to?
---
Happens, sorry for your loss.
---
Ahh, okay, the "commie" thing threw me off. Thanks.
---
I hope it tracks everything alright lol
---
I bribed a random guy to get killed by a bloatfly for 100c. 
---
Just to make sure this exact thing didn‚Äôt happen. Maybe try that
---
Yeah its not that big of a deal to me its only a virtual item but i just dont get why people do it
---
That quest goes another way with Wasteland Whisperer!
---
Chill out. Its  game.
---
Nice, they're just butt then ü§ì I'm never gonna stay in my workshop ever, I'm too "pure" for the multi-player world üòÇ
---
I still need to do it if you do! 
---
PSN Evocative
---
I built mine over a river. with a nice porch for vending. It just made life easier since my camp could span both sides without a nightmare of placeing the foundations on a downhillslope across a river bed.
---
Yeah your right overall the price falls making it affordable for everyone rather than the lucky few with God rolls to trade, the issue is though is that it depreciates it's true value for the players that ligitamitally had one drop before they patched out explosive energy weapons. Over time the numbers that have been duped will dwindle as they fizzle out to the players of the game and the rarity and price will again increase, but it's still a metaphorical kick in the teeth for someone who grinded pre patch to have something worth value and rarity, only for a duper to knock them out for a few thousand caps making them as common as a regenerating wooden left leg.
---
Lol I thought this sounded familiar
---
It's when tryhards want to play the game but have the least fun actually doing so
---
Well Your world is currently full so when you are done join me if you want
---
What does the Mothman say if you shoot it with VOX syringe mod?!
---
You missed me by like 20 minutes haha, I‚Äôll be on again in like 4 hours
---
I repair mine no issue
---
I usually just pop in ever half hour or so and pick up materials from mine when I have them.
---
Alright give me around 10 minutes and I‚Äôll be done
---
Nothing official in game for clan support; but there are discord groups that function as such.   This is the official Reddit discord for F76: https://discord.gg/falloutreddit 
---
I'm on PC, give me an add (Mutinyofthemind) and I can hook you up with some stimpaks and possibly craft a better weapon or two for you to use.
---
I would also suggest posting your current build using https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks so that others can suggest perks you may want to take to accomplish your build.
---
I've tried milking those flatwoods brahmin so many times and it probably actually milks one of them 10% of the time, if that. Idk what it is, I tried server hopping plenty of times and its always the same.
---
Elaborate please. The option doesn't show up for me.
---
It‚Äôs a game we all paid for, that a select few are destabilizing. No.
---
I see. That explains why people are now accepting caps for TSE energy weapons rather than trades only.
---
That item appears to fall into the 'cosmetic' headgear category (like chef's hats, clown hats, etc) and is not a piece of armor, provides no damage protection, therefore cannot be repaired. Not sure why it is saying you can't equip it though. Any specific reason you wanted this particular item? It doesn't seem to be very special....
---
I think it has to be film camera. The broken cameras appear in other spots as well. I think I read in some tool boxes at the camp and whitesprings as well.
---
They attacked both time just after an event to defend my workshop that's why I was there and staying
---
I have over 700 hours and everything I have are drops.
---
AA double vats handmade
---
Fe lmg
---
Aae combat rifle.
---
Just putting it out there so people know it's possible
---
No rush. Just look me up when you are ready.
---
It's not always a bloatfly. They're random bugs. I've seen Radroaches, bloodbugs, bloatflies and ticks.
---
If they see me, I just do the ??? Emote.  I was drinking the first time that happened and it sort of made sense.
---
I will say, there are some relatively fun Tadpole challenges.  A lot of it is time-consuming, but it seems to become much more mundane when you hit the Possum challenges.
---
It's always random for me, even if I move it!
---
You completely misread what I wrote. I didn't say anything about you or any community. My point was about a corrupt political system. Unless you're a corrupt politician from the future it's nothing to do with you at all.
---
I stand around because apparently people can't view my weapons unless I'm near by. I don't get offended if someone doesn't buy anything.
---
Using any mods that modify the string values in the game?
---
I believe all take a photo challenges require the camera item. One spawns outside wavy willards, the tourist will be leaning against the exploded car direclty in front of you when you spawn in, so it's fairly easy to find by server hopping.
---
That will be 2am here. Haha :D how long you plan to play?
---
I honestly feel the same, haven't played for more than a few hours since end of January, and finding any resource that highlights everything they've added is difficult.. I was hoping this post would have some resource, rather than "just search for it"..
---
I appreciate a Nuka cola in a machine. I‚Äôll buy that at the very least.
---
I think a thumbs up or a heart is sufficient if they don‚Äôt have what you‚Äôre looking for. I deal mostly in max level one stars and I realize that‚Äôs not for everyone. Most people will take a look around my camp, give me an emote and disappear. And I‚Äôm good with that. Just acknowledging the owner and their hard work is really all that‚Äôs needed.
---
I dont know if it was a random event, but yesterday I found a platform in a tree just north of Clancy Manor that had about 20 human skulls on it arranged in a grid.
---
Try adding them as a friend or sending them a message. If they want to sell that thing they'll probably be willing to help.
---
Someone killed me yesterday at a workshop. I simply started revenge and killed him, winning extra caps for the trouble.
---
After that he just ran away and never came back. Win-win.
---
Workshops attract PvP, and you are warned before claiming one.
---
I use it and it seems to work a lot more often with shotguns. I can do a west tek run with my shotgun and the effect will happen around 8 to 10 times any other gun or melee maybe it happens 1 to 2 times.
---
Griefers will always look to hit when you cant defend yourself, and event PVP rules dont apply in workshop defense sadly. If they kill you once, dont go back, wait for the event to fail, and see if they leave. Otherwise just reject the quest and dont go back to the workshop
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt think people realize how rare it is to get a perfect rolled gun in the world lol. Most of us bought, traded or were gifted duped guns. The Purveyor will change that. It‚Äôll be as rng as the damn world drops but at least we can guarantee a 3 star of whatever we want (ranged, melee or armor)
---
When you do the Sunny Top course be prepared for raider traps and mines the whole way!
---
Night in the game...
---
As opposed to real world night.
---
Ahaha shoot, in that case I‚Äôll be on tomorrow too, won‚Äôt be on for too long tonight
---
I believe it will only pop up if someone hasn't already done it that night, so someone may have beaten you to it.
---
You also probably have to have started the acrual tadpole quests and not just have the breadcrumb quest.
---
When you start making serums that requires bone, think of me... üòÉ
---
Nvm i fixed it, it was caused by a mod that deleted the "news* screen you get when starting the game
---
Yes. You need a camera not photo mode. Also, when you get a camera. When you take the picture make sure the name of the attraction or item being photographed shows up in the view finder. Right side, i think in grey. If you a photoing scorched.. it will say scorched. Taking a picture of wavy wizards it will say wavy Willard.. etc.
---
A large part of the game is the scavenging and looting to get materials for both crafting weapons and to sell to the vendors. Its possible to get all the 1400 caps that the vendors have to offer daily by bulking up materials and selling looted weapons. Without doing that you will run low on caps as you found. Try to keep 1000 in your pocket.
---
Also get perks for intelligence for the gunsmith (ranks up 5), so you can craft higher level guns of the ones you scrap. Example if you scrap low level hunting rifles then as you level up you will be able to craft weapons and mods to suit. For those guns go for the anti armour mods like hardened receiver and piercing magazine as you unlock them by scrapping. 
---
Also melee weapons are good and a serrated machete of high level does a lot of damage. Look for things like super sledge (rocket powered) from top of the world area where Rose is. They do huge damage and will be good to  carry. 
---
Cannot help in person because I am on XBox, but ask if you want info or opinion.
---
I learned that the hard way sadly. But I'll do that from now on!
---
My analysis is my own, I'm simply providing an explanation to the community about why I feel you indeed do care :)
---
It certainly feels like you are the one who is mad. I am sorry that I‚Äôve hurt your feelings by saying something is ugly when it clearly is.
---
Still need help? I need to complete the challenge too.
---
Remindme!
---
Were you guys on the same team? That's the only thing I can think of. I tried it with a team mate in front of the church in the mire. And it counted for both.
---
Playing sinds beginning and never had a drill from legendarys...till yesterday 2 times in a row...it was from ghouls @ w spring tho
---
I have that issue in my camp, that's why there is a back door where you can get out easily :)
---
Also, block the player so that they cant see you on the map and they cant send team invites. That way even if you go to a different workshop that you own, they cant just follow you.
---
211 from here
---
I feel like in any other fallout game you could turn him to a companion
---
If it was a legitimate drop they have or something they have in got in trade then caps wouldn't even be considered by that player as a reasonable offer. They knew its rarity and they would hold out for the good 3 star gear as they could basically request any piece of armor or weaponry and if a player had it, chances are they would exchange it for a legacy weapon that is no longer obtainable. The people selling them for caps are sitting on several, they move them for caps because everyone has caps there not rare so they can move them fast. Use the caps to buy 2 star items of reasonable quality and then flip them in trades for better 3 star items, which then you can use to trade just about anything.
---
How does one move their spawn point?
---
legendary vender coming the 16th
---
Found it twice today, random locations. But... it happened both times in a ‚Äùverdant season‚Äù . Might as well give it a try. Just chose a road and start walking.
---
Using glitches and bugs in the game to duplicate items. Like dplucating a weapon 10 times and then selling them to make easy money without having to do anything. That ruins the games economy and causes prices to skyrocket.
---
But with nearly every other item in the game, that‚Äôs just not true.  You can buy Ultracite Armor and/or plans, for example, instead of waiting to complete the BoS storyline.
---
Yup I know that that's why if they took the claim I'd be "ok" with it but they didn't and that's what bother me. It was totally free and without any interest since I don't shoot back
---
Get the camera and get close to them also can I revive u in water
---
Save then delete your ini files @ ...Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76
---
I would re-install NVidia GeForce drivers &amp; NVidia GeForce Experience and then just ignore it, start the game from the Bethesda Launcher or FO76 desktop icon and retry changing settings.
---
Make sure your ini files are not read only!
---
Psa: use granate to get skeletons away.
---
Can you do yours in the water? i need the swimmer badge
---
He was blocked but not because I did it, I don't know why
---
I always try to keep some Nuka Colas stocked.
---
Glad it's been acknowledged. I hit this Friday morning and have been locked out of my main since.
---
Bus monies?
---
Im slowly getting through the lists but can't seem to fully complete a single badge!
---
I got downed and he can rev me when we are on the same team but he immediately dies so I don't even get the chance to rev him.
---
We tried on team and off team. He just dies immediately before I even get the chance to try.
---
I'm also looking and helping if anyone needs it. Psn: mynamiznik
---
I get that way sometimes and I just go back to the basics, stay in the forest and farm farm farm. I pick up everything just religiously. I make circles from my camp and dump stuff and go back to it. Before you even realize...you'll have a ton of stimpacks and building mats as well as Xtra shit you may not need at the moment, that you can sell to get a little bit of caps.
---
My friend took a workshop for the sole purpose of doing this 3 at a time, I took advantage of it too!
---
Yeah it sucks specially when they stick a bunch of bullets into you then don't give you anything
---
Found one at overseers camp quite a few times. Check there if you haven‚Äôt found one
---
I think the way they did it was by identifying items they suspected of being duped and removing all but one of them from each persons account.
---
Yes, but every mod has it's down fall. Refrigeration halfs the carry weight ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm thinking of just sticking with the standard pack to be honest - I'll have all the plans thanks to being a completionist, but with these harsh negatives I don't think any of them are worth it.
---
Oh and you'll level up naturally that way too, slowly but it will happen.
---
Complete the camera quest!
---
You definitely can. Dunno about right now but for a while we had a bug where it would just regularly dupe your camp into your stored tab. The only way to not have this happen was to never get close to your camp and i'm sorry, but i'm not going to avoid my camp for months just so i don't accidentaly trigger a glitch that will dupe my camp.
---
That would at least be something. It‚Äôd rebalance the market a bit.
---
Don't be sorry; many of us love to help folks out üòÅüëç
---
Breadcrumb quest?
---
My fast travel. You rich players will never understand
---
Thanks a lot, I‚Äôll have a look
---
Guess I have another 200 hours of play time til I get something good lol.
---
I keep my doors unlocked, but put a lock on my bedroom door. Then I can go in there and nap and/or sort through my inventory, check the map for events, etc without people constantly coming to me wanting to trade. I‚Äôve put everything I‚Äôm selling in my machines. Anything I have on me is mine or going to be turned in for scrip.
---
The knowingly blind buyers of said duped armor and weapons are just as guilty. There is a lot of willful ignorance about buying duped equipment. If you see a OP sentinel's set selling for 10,000 you really should think something,'s up. When you run with gear the same as 30% of the survival server, you really should think something's up. If you traded for a TSE 95% chance that it is a duped weapon. TSE don't drop like candy they are statistically rare if not super rare.
---
The quests that lead in to longer quest chains. They're usualy a single step that's just like "go to the place and meet the person"
---
I'm talking about the armor one.
---
Nope most people have over priced garbage for sale so I have no problem leavening. I look right at them when I leave.
---
Too high an enemy level maybe and that's why it's not working? Idk....it's odd. I got down and hit the help button and it worked.

There are random encounter places throughout the map, but the chances of the Mothman showing up are low. I did about 15 server hops at 2 of the places and got a lot of weird stuff, but no Mothman. So I switched to a different badge.
---
Pictures or it didn‚Äôt happen. Just kidding. You must have all the luck.
---
Try discovering new locations and going off the main path Charleston and toxic Valley are good along with point plesont and top of the world
---
Wait where are there more thsn the 3-4 behind the church?
---
Huh, that's not a bad idea. Good thing I've put off that quest, now I'll use it to my advantage.
---
Gotta get "Join The Order Of The TODDpole Today!" on the Pioneer Scouts one next
---
Been happening for months.
---
If ur levil 15 ish go toxic Valley and wander around
---
Impossible to do without implementing some kind of spyware that can read out way more than a game should be allowed to. So no. Just banning the account is fine. After all if they want to make a new account they have to buy the game again. So everytime they get banned they have to rebuy the whole game.
---
Fantastic! I appreciate you.
---
Just got my first backpack and finished campfire quest. Somebody else started it though.
---
I'm level 1
---
Welcome to a multiplayer game.
---
Atom, railway, electrician, and photographer are pretty easy.
---
If you are on Xbox I have some in my vending machine. Gt is the same
---
My theory is that the ‚Äúfork‚Äù is between Black Mtn and 76. He mentions a robot, but also the vault. We know next to nothing about the TNT domes, so It would make sense for a unknown robot to be in there. I scoped the area out and didn‚Äôt find anything tho.
---
been looking for one specific weapon. i pop in check the weapons and pop off to the next one.. unless i get stuck in a wall or between a wall and a fusion generator, or a locked room. only been once or twice in a couple thousands caps of jumping have i seen something worth buyin.   
---
and when i am in my camp and someone pops in checks my machines and leave im not hurt or offended i didnt sell something or not getting a emote from them.. 
---
of course i have been in retail for 30 years now. currently sitting in my job while answering this question lol. if it bothered me in game, id prolly be fired for punching the customer that walked by me for not saying hi or buyin a pack of gum as he left..   
---
do you heart every stocker you walk by at walmart?
---
I remember when WoW got that. It was the shit.
---
I noticed a lot more 3* enemies dropping 1* weapons and armors now. üò°
---
Atom, railway, electrician, and photographer are pretty easy. I have those done. Others I'm 1 away or a couple away cuz they are bugged.
---
Really it never happened to me til yesterday where I got a drill then I got nothing from a 2* colonel gutsy
---
This dude Legions.
---
TBF, I don‚Äôt think most people work hard on their camps. I sell plans super cheap just to hopefully help people build something that‚Äôs not absolutely horrendous. But yes, unlock doors. Using benches to break in is fun though.
---
Which system you on?
---
Yeah I agree with you.
---
I can help if you want I'm on Xbox and need to do the same in water
---
Yeah I think the musician is bugged, it wont activate when I play the instruments
---
Well, it's not a solo game. Even if you don't want to be in a group very often, it's not the end of the world to help your fellows now and then.
---
This.
---
Wed I got goose egged on legendary mobs at the burrows. Today I had 3 3stars. Just bethesda things.
---
Yea I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as bad as everyone is making it out to be.  It was only a couple of days and I don‚Äôt think a lot of people knew about it.  
---
Even when all the handmades got duped the market bounced back.  Those are still extremely valuable.
---
I love one to disable her voice
---
Super agree that rating could lead to a weirdly toxic/problematic outcome. However, I do think it'd be neat to have a "guest book." Players can sign it to let you know, "Yo dog, I seen't this." It fosters more of a community feeling when side stepping the whole issue of rating. 
---
That being said, this is like one of those, "cherry on my sundae," type of ideas that I'd rather get four years from now after meaningful content updates.
---
1090 h/ lvl 317. Just from evening play sesions with my ingame friends. Not the best game yet, but some of the bugs we came across are epic sometimes. LMFAO indeed!!!
---
Standard or armor seems best to me
---
So it's forgetting which core is loaded in which gatling after switching weapons again?
---
Guns, armors and ammo. Also some food would be good for others.
---
That and the one where you shoot animals with syringer. I know there are more as well. Some I just am not even attempting to actively chase, like the collector.
---
That doesn't explain anything to someone who didn't already know how to do this math.
---
So it turns out I've collected all of them already and that's why I couldn't find them on my list but for the sake of the collectors mission I have to re collect them
---
Thanks everyone for your help
---
Eh, I guess.
---
Except every other game manages to do this and it's only Bethesda games that introduce a new duping glitch with every patch. So MAYBE Bethesda is just too incompetent or their technology is just way out of date. If every other company is able to do it except Bethesda then it definitely isn't a problem of games in general.
---
Any good spots to stock up on Spices?
---
i‚Äôm on ps4 sadly:/
---
Naw...there is a flood of BE +1agi handmades in the last few days. They are all duped.
---
have to be using camera, have to get close to them. like the snake thing i had jumped and ran up the alligator water slide looked down to get the whole thing and had to slowly walk forward until the name of the slide appeared while targeting with the camera..
---
What stealth perks do you have? I've been having it happen to me too, and I wonder if it's Escape Artist (Enemies lose you when you stay sneaking).
---
"I keep falling through the world" ;)
---
Yeah, that üòÑ
---
Escape artist
---
OhüòÇ
---
 I'm out of town or I would join you.   Others on this thread have given good advice already, but will add:
---
Welcome to the wastelands!
---
I hope he keeps making more videos... I dont watch the videos for what he has in the background.. and has far as the info he puts out he asks about it discord and ask if anyone has datamined info.. so he does at least try to check stuff before he puts it out..
---
Escape artist does this do you have it equipment?
---
With the bloating of the putrefaction it must be glued in some way
---
Thank you for feedback, I will add an additional machine..hope its refrigerated for that food lol
---
Landview lighthouse?
---
Would if I could :)
---
You know people can lie to you...
---
As long as you conclude every transaction with "may your road lead you to warm sands."
---
Gamertag Sidthesloth814 im feelin the same struggle as you my dude üòÇ I‚Äôll be on in ten minutes
---
Agreed, that's why i modified my camp when vending came out. Unlocked all my doors, resource collector and purifiers. Even added a huge garage door so anyone can just walk in... highly accessible and free steel and water just for visiting. Now that's customer service ;)
---
Yeah. You know how new players can struggle with smallest things. So help them with it. (of course for some "symbolic" price/donation)
---
You should just have a 600 Cap loss if I‚Äôm correct bro
---
are you a beta player? there is a glitch with what ya did in beta not counting towards achievements. 
---
like say you were on it through beta reviving 15 people then once full release hit ya have only done 1 or 2 revives.. the game will only give you credit for the 1 or 2 since release, not the 15 before full release.   
---
im stuck like that with hacking.. i am at 55 terminals hacked but i have no clue how many of those were before full release.. and i hate hacking terminals so i may be stuck for awhile.
---
Keep in mind that the male Brahmin don‚Äôt count.
---
I agree... I just got a 3 star legendary Gatling gun.  It's looks decent... But there is no way in hell it will work with my melee / shotgun build and I'm not going to spend the time to slowly Respec just to try it out. So off I go to sell to the legendary vendor.
---
Yeah, based upon a few recent posts I think the loot tables are messed up worse than usual.
---
It would have you lose the 600 Caps to the void unfortunately
---
And other games either never have dupe glitches discovered, or maybe 1 every 100 patches and that is fixed in a hotfix hours after it's first discovered. So while yeah, i guess players who use these glitches are garbage, it still has to count for something that Bethesda is the only game company in the world that introduces new ways to cheat in their games with every single update in every single game they make. 
---
And if Bethesda is the only company in the world with this problem i'm not buying that "it's not their fault" excuse.
---
Lose...
---
This is fantastic. Lmao. Why isnt there a mod for this.
---
It will probably just disappear and be taken out of  the game
---
For the small guys, I often donate a weapon and/or food..however often it's someone's second, third or ninth character but I like to help.
---
I ain't gonna lie, I saw someone place a 25/100 fusion core for 1000 caps among other overpriced things. Went to the trouble just to give them a thumbs down before I left after not buying anything.
---
_Technically_ you can't get a 1\* Safecracker's Leather X Armor since the Safecracker Prefix is a actually a tertiary ("minor") attribute that overrides the actual primary ("prefix") naming attribute. Safecrackers Armor will always be a 3\* armor but you will have to inspect it to see what the actual primary prefix attribute actually is.
---
(I have way too much fucking legendary armor)
---
Going back I can see what you meant and I apologize, I immediately assumed you were meaning people from the geographic region of West Virginia are hacks and unintelligent and ‚Äúprone to cannibalism‚Äù
---
I do have it but it didn‚Äôt used to happen like this. Or was it bugged for me before? Idk
---
I do but I don‚Äôt remember it happening before and I‚Äôve had it for a long time
---
i usually stare at them from my house and say on mic ‚Äúkhajiit has wares if you have coin‚Äù
---
Hopefully they will get on it once or twice can be kind of funny but it would suck if your first experience with a three star gives you nothing
---
Log: *cave crickets chirping*
---
Mah Far Cry 5 meta game Peanut Butter is dipping into my Fallout 76 meta game Chocolate and I think I like it.
---
Nah West Tek gave me a few really good rolls today. Saw five 3* mutants on a server and just kept popping by to kill them. 
---
I have been keeping a close eye on spawns there since the watoga nerf.
---
Banning by IP is 100% useless nowadays. You can get a new IP in two clicks if you want. 
---
And Bethesda does ban by account. Either by PSN, Xbox Live or Bethesda.Net account. But you know what people do then? They just make another account. And no you can't ban a console or a PC. At least not without installing some kind of spyware.
---
I only feel obligated if the base is cool. Then I'll buy some reasonably priced trash as a tip. :)
---
If you're on PS4 I might have one you can have.
---
Watoga was nerfed?
---
I don't think it always did it and is a more recent thing.
---
Maby that's what will happen in nuclear winter
---
Stone benches, plasma grenade, and gamma gun but tbh I don‚Äôt even know all the plans I‚Äôve yet to read till I see them looking all fresh and unknown in a vending machine or on a vendor bot so I‚Äôm mostly window shopping lol
---
Oooo gotcha thanks a lot!
---
No you misunderstand me. I know i haven't done 20 but want to know how many i have done.
---
As for the beta bug I deleted all file data and uninstalled/reinstalled the game, you could try that.
---
Send a team again
---
I placed a power armor statue (The big ones they had a few weeks back) and now I can't move it or delete it because it says it's currently in use lol. Camps just seem bugged in general
---
Im new to fallout 76. Everywhere i go there is always something like Events and quest. Everyone said the game is trash but i enjoy it. Dont even know what im doing.
---
Is that the "broken arrow" dude? Known scammer all over FB
---
Except ultracite
---
If the armor is registered, I think.
---
Its a weapon called the bear skull gauntlet and its not out yet
---
Im online now, add me rams_man
---
Only NVidia GeForce Experience (wich offered to me some settings tools). But I've uninstalled it.
---
You sir just sold me on the skin; consider it purchased! Bethesda should give you some Atoms for your salesmanship. Now where are the tires, so I can kick them? ...ah, it has that new PA smell. :)
---
I think the owner has to be nearby for you to inspect items
---
There is a glitch that let's you move l crops inside, it only works under specific conditions though!
---
There‚Äôs a daily event at Camden park that awards only 3 mr fuzzy tokens so they are highly sought after to buy the Mr Fuzzy mascot costume and head which looks great btw lol, if you google it you should be able to see a picture of it. It‚Äôs the ultimate goal lol
---
I have a cavalier/sentinel/+25 rad resist heavy raider chest piece if your interested, its max lvl
---
No, the standard backpack gives one resistance. The large backpack takes away 60 energy and 60 radiation.
---
We were just doing this ourselves. You \*have\* to use the tourist camera from the Bucket List quest. 
---
Here is the image we used to hunt spots: [https://i.imgur.com/bppHKpA.png](https://i.imgur.com/bppHKpA.png)
---
It's suuuuper RNG and we got really frustrated, though. Spent ages server hopping. That being said, the one on our current server (that we finally found) should still be there. I don't think it un-spawns. So if you're on PC send me a DM here and you can add me and join server.
---
Me too.  Can I add you?   What's your gamertag?
---
 Won't be on until later tonight though.
---
Yes possum badges. Just tried it but I get one and that‚Äôs all no matter how many times I try.
---
If it's not Beths fault tell me why Bethesda games are the only games that have issues with this? How come i never hear about how broken Guild Wars or WoW's economy is because of all the dupers? Oh right, because they don't have a million dupe glitches, that's right. 
---
Seriously, how dumb can you be? Yeah people have to opt to use such a bug but the bug shouldn't exist to begin with. Other companies don't have those. Pretty much no other company in the world has those. It's only Bethesda that has them in every single 3D game they ever made. So maybe, just maybe, Bethesda is just incompetent when it comes to these kinds of things?
---
Yes dupers suck, but it's ABSOLUTELY Beths fault.
---
A fasnacht mask you get more than once is not duped, if that's what you're saying
---
I have no idea, ive never traded on Facebook so dont know about that.
---
I feel like those are built by players who are less concerned with immersion and RP, which is fine except they kinda kill *my* immersion a bit when they come into view.
---
Thank you, I had no idea! üòä
---
Oh, I was wondering why I never saw leg bots there anymore.
---
IMO, never buy stuff if you're 500 caps or less. I have a little over 70.000 caps  in total on all my characters but i still use Travel Agent (30% less caps) perk when i travel. And i still go to my CAMP/ Vault 76 when i need to get somewhere, if those two are in the way. If you're new, don't start buying plans, you will get many of those by doing quests / taking workshops and defending them. Some people even leave free plans in the train stations for others to pick up
---
The player needs to be close by. It's a know glitch and Bethesda is looking into it.
---
Go back to the forest and toxic valley to complete events and claim workshops. Both activities yield a surprisingly decent amount of XP and give you stims and stuff as rewards.
---
With a psn name like that, why would you proceed. He flat out said he going to break the deal and scam you lol
---
Lmao mine says "Sheepsquatch ate my butthole" it fits if anyone is wondering
---
You need to unlock it through a quest, keep out is only a skin
---
Meepo222 on Xbox, I try to stock the useful crafting items, amunition, explosives, and every "known" plan I come across. And would totally accept friend requests from people looking to come back to buy stuff. 
---
I just friended two players who where both selling mutations for 250 each. I love this addition to the game.
---
It wont go below zero. I have 45 radiation resistence without the backpack on and I have 0 once I put it on. The guy that replied to you is wrong. The standard only gives you one resistance and the high capacity takes away 60 energy and 60 radiation.
---
Ah im not that worried about it and as far as i know i dont think its listed in challenges since its a ps4/psn related challenge they track it on their side
---
If only they added proper text chat, we'd have even more chances for RP.
---
We played together for the whole week man
---
How many masks were there? Did they sell Old Man Winter? Are you on PC???
---
Malaka we dont use drachma anymore. Kalesperra.
---
What's later cus it's 9 pm where I an and it's CounterBloom26
---
They're guaranteed legendaries, every Sheepsquatch is
---
My buddy wrote "sheepsquatch ate my POO" with the Greek letters in his portable toilet. It's what inspired me.
---
Did you earn the rank of possum?
---
I have half my water free but my lead, that's for me.  üòÅ
---
Wait you can travel to the vault for free? This is news to me!
---
Haven‚Äôt even started it yet :/
---
Yeah i know lolüòÇ
---
But seriously i cant judge on their psn names
---
There is also hotdogs at Morgantown airport and I believe most the BBQ and Icecream places as well
---
how to get camera
---
And i even saw that he had negative karma but still went with it, dont know what i was thinking.
---
I don't have a backpack and I'm a hoarder. It's a problem. I have to dump junk regularly because my Stash is constantly at 800.
---
Bethesda, offer me STASH upgrades in your damn cash shop. That's how to get me.
---
I‚Äôve leveled 5 characters.  My baseline plan is to stick to left side of map (forest/tv/ash heap) as much as possible early on.  Take workshops in the area, clear out quests and WALK to places, only fast travel between free points.  Questing and workshop defense will net a fair amount of XP, and you‚Äôll be moving along before you know it.  
---
The horde events are so so for weapons.  As was noted, pick gunsmith or makeshift warrior and just work with a baseline weapon.  You‚Äôll likely outlevel most legendaries anyway so no need to fret over them.
---
Shame the Imposter Sheepsquash hits people so hard it bypasses the downed state!
---
Duecehead?
---
No thanks I bought a whole set of assassin's sentinel yesterday
---
Is it possible to get royal using butcher's bounty?
---
Idk if the fallout reference is the most funny or the unintentional office reference with Astrid and Michael xD it only she would have asked her manager Jan for assistance!
---
But my house is my house. You have a guesthouse and garage available, and my house is clearly marked employees only. 
---
I do hate it when it's an inconvenient situation though.
---

---
You have to do his dailys to unlock recipes, it takes a while.
---
Yeah it happens... we've all had that idiot moment and anyone who denies it is lying. Or so I've been told, I've never had such an experience.
---
Or the dead bodies by vault 76
---
That software has absolutely no impact on the text strings within 76.
---
What would impact that very specific message would be corrupted game files, Bethesda introducing a bug by accident into affecting that text string, and as I mentioned already a mod that affects the text strings in the game.
---
As /u/nosbaroguh suggested; you could backup your ini files in your F76 folder under my games and then delete them. Once you relaunch the game, it'll rebuild those files.
---
I wouldn't worry about it too much, your settings would still be properly saved.
---
The belini and mimosa take the lead champagne combine it with other drinks carrot, mutifruit and other drinks (think diluted chems) and removes one buff so you can get the rad resist or dmg resist buff they both retain the fall speed buff
---
Follow the quest line
---
Do you know where the 3* ones spawn?  I've done free range at lot, and have met him in the wild at some usual spawn points of his but they are always 1*.
---
Or a vendor backpack upgrade, and when trade is selected it will only show what‚Äôs been added to the pack machine.
---
Eh shame...
---
High Capacity (HC) is also ideal for snipers since there is no weapon weight reduction perk cards. :(
---
Old man winter masks everywhere on the Reddit market and Xbox LFG market.
---
Yeah first time for me too and last for sure.
---
Impressive! I can‚Äôt wait to boast such great numbers myself
---
This has been requested 100 times already. Although a fantastic feature/idea, bethesda doesn't care.
---
Yeah just checked the blacklist and hes the same dude
---
But couldn‚Äôt you just kill like 25 ghouls at once by pulling Whitesprings clubhouse?
---
What thim cus it's 9 pm where I am and it's CounterBloom26
---
crap, duping is really back :/
---
Mine says 
---
‚ÄúTodd Howard ate my son‚Äù
---
Encountered 2 or 3 in the wild, one spawn point is sparse sundew Grove and another spot is that crater north of Fort defiance
---
Personally, I use leather armor so losing energy resistance is alright. Radiation resistance too (went from 25 to 0) since I use ghoulish and sun kissed. +120 carry weight baby!
---
Man, I'm on PC... Wish I was on PS4! I could use that kind of regularity with my fiber!
---
Oh I'll deffs check those out. Hes usually by the Welch train station but always 1*
---
there is also a fossil near pleasant valley station.  from the fast travel point run to the platform and take a picture of top of the world  I got fossil that way by chance
---
Wouldn‚Äôt mind some arm mod to give you. Say, 25 more each.  Arm mods for PA are lame.
---
I'm thinking most in this thread are meaning PvE. I live in the mire, and higher level enemies merely laugh at my turrets. The occasional radrat or mole rat will attack and the turrets handle them, but gulpers and muties have to be killed by me.
---
your camp and vault 76 are free fast travel points, you can also fast travel on team mates, you can also use teammates as respawn points when you die. also if your that broke.. and no bus money.. walk to nearest train station, store your junk.. find nearest high point / pond then jump or drown yourself and spawn back at your camp.
---
Winter man masks for everyone! Eff you bethesda for not alloting them to people who did over 500 parades.    
---
Im personally happy with the dupers being back. We can buy guns again for under max caps.  To those of you wanting only one copy of masks out there and were happy with being unable to trade for items i say gtfo
---
Good luck, please let us know what happens.
---
 I guess he figured you out right away. ;) The AI in this game has a mind of it's own.
---
And lose your beautiful camp every time. I think OP's suggestion is about the character itself being an additional vending machine.
---
Stop by my camp i could use the money üòÅ
---
Ah, I didn't know that! Thanks!
---
Well you're either on survival, so you're fair game.. or you're on regular and fighting back and getting railed. Just don't shoot back or find a different server dude
---
Yes.
---
Whitesprings. Look directly in front of you and to your right. Keep hopping until you see a body on the car. I should have this on my phone's clipboard full time for as often as I tell people.
---
The only way they can kill you now in Adventure is if you own a Workshop. And it has been said many times that Workshops attract PvP. You can simply not claim one.
---
Ok- stupid question... when you get the posters from the atom shop where the hell are they in your C.A.M.P directory/ i swear I've looked thought the wall decor posters a million times and can't find them.
---
Are there garden plots like in fallout 4?  I have tried looking but god knows i often don‚Äôt look in the proper spot, where i‚Äôm situated is very rocky but i have large flat roofs i‚Äôd rather just make into gardens.
---
Yea same here. i find myself getting my dailies from BIV for recipies, and doing challeneges and this scout stuff is crazy detailed. i hope i finish it before they take it away, or the new DLC drops
---
Came across few others in the 400+. Not many, but they are roaming the Wasteland! Good luck with the game and have fun! (PS4)
---
It‚Äôs pretty disappointing that I can‚Äôt compare stats for mods/upgrades as easily as in fallout 4... I‚Äôve managed to come across Modifications saying Exceptional!!! I wish we could have a wiki to view all the damage buffs and actually have decent statistics to build from..
---
It‚Äôs bad but it does help the prices of everything
---
Hmm. I have found a train station with a robot. Maybe i could sell some of these guns... But then i would miss out on mods and you veterans bailing my ass out.
---
Didn‚Äôt they add armor values to some outfits and headgear with patch 9?
---
They should be there, maybe it's hidden behind some other Atom shop posters. Try scrolling left or right on some of them
---
Blocked players can still shoot at you... You just can't do anything back to them!
---
And yes I have one friend that I can't join/invite to a team unless we do the team invite from the menu, it's a real pain in the ass.
---
I know people don't believe it, but I saw someone get one shot killed who hadn't done anything and hadn't been near a wokshop since she jumped servers to trade with me.
---
I did the water park today server hopped about 10 times and got it the body was lying against the car as ykur spawn near the carpark
---
Ghouls are sexy
---
Huh. Never thought to try abusing that.
---
I'd be ok with that. One slot for travels, one for camping.
---
I have a chair that I sit on. I stare directly at them while they are using my vending machines.
---
if your on PC I can give you one.
---
If I were on xbox... but I'm sure someone will see this and be pleased with your stock! 
---
Yea, the addition of player vending to the game has cranked up the social aspect to a new degree. 
---
And this was the perfect community to do it with as the a-holes are few and far in-between.
---
I mean, realistically, Grounded *should* impact it... It relies on energy to fire the projectile.
---
On the surface it may seem like a mess, but ~~when you boil it all down --with the exception of its ammo-- it all makes perfect sense.~~ no... it is a bit of a mess. After I thought about the ammo being listed as "Energy" and Batteries Included affecting their weigh, I then considered that it actually is not a "Rifle" either. So then not only is the Ammo mis-categorized in the Tinker Station, and its weight impacted by an Energy-related perk, but it lacks a "barrel" and therefore cannot have rifling. lol
---
The gun needs to be classified as an Energy Weapon, even though it delivers a non-engergy projectile (I'm going to ignore that the larger railguns *can* reduce the tail-portion of the projectile to a plasma lol), and the Ammo needs to be governed by the Bandoleer perk. I don't even know if there's an energy-weapon perk for things like Laser and Plasma (non-heavy, though I'd anticipate it'd effect them, too), or if they rely on the Rifle/Pistol/Automatic gun perks...
---
So I concede; it's a mess. :P
---
has been requested 100 times, bethesda doesnt care. (2nd time ive written this on a post today)
---
Agreed. Made sure the spawn point was nowhere near my tiny house, nothing worth going in there for, multiple stash boxes and vending machines outside with my crafting benches, all well protected.
---
Thanks for bringing this up! I couldn‚Äôt figure out wtf happened. My base dmg now on my TSE is something like ~220, 196 prior.
---
It also happens with anything containing carpets. [Here is an example with a single foundation](https://i.imgur.com/vKkqSNk.png). I can't move my camp or the whole thing will trigger that "object is floating" error message while still showing a green overlay...
---
So, I‚Äôm trying to check it out, and cannot get in. All the doors are boarded up. Anyone else try to get in recently?
---
They moved to survival. On adventure everything is weaker along with the legendary spawns and their loot.
---
Killed 6 three star super mutants in Harper's ferry in the same proximity within 3 minutes once. The drop rate is still random though, but I've found the probability on three stars is way higher
---
I killed 20 three üåü legendaries in adventure and received 2 three weapons, 8 two star, the rest where one star or Garbage.
---
Killed 10 three üåü mobs and got 3 3 üåü drops. The rest where two star.
---
I feel like if you find the loot or the mobs no longer challenge move to survival. It's not as bad as you think and it adds a element to fall out I miss when playing adventure.
---
They both take different mindsets to play I've noticed
---
Ps4 sadly
---
I will take your mole rat chunks recipe, Again ;)
---
I don't shoot back, but people are getting smarter to to able to kill you now. I have pacifist on but catch me on a workshop and I'm dead, or teammates being asses and shoots first, I die. If I wasn't a part of it, I shouldn't have to die. Even if I say no to shooting, I still die like it's my fault.

Still bugged, even after the hotfix!

How did they scam you?

You trade a weapon for a set amount of caps and you are done.

Anything else you only do with trusted traders .

OK here's where I've found it.  The palace in the NE, when u fast travel there turn around and go up to the parking lot/overlook area.  Slumped up against the guard rail

Top of the lighthouse by vault 76

Back of the Tyler County fairgrounds in the area where they would have the best-in-show animal competition sitting in the chairs.

Why they haven‚Äôt been able to fix the game?

I feel for you man i tried quite a bit at the cemetry first and no luck

What part of whitesprings?  The golf club, the hotel, service entrance?

If teammates active pvp then the whole team goes red. Be careful who u team with.

Yes please today I got stuck under a guys foundation and he was at his camp and wouldn't even edit it for me to get it. He just stare
---
I typically just buy four or five caps worth of whatever ammo they have, just to be polite.
---
I‚Äôd really like to get wall mounted turrets myself, one thing that really irritated me about the game in the beginning was that my turrets delayed firing for so long sometimes that mobs cleared lines of fire and then just beat on my walls.
---
Or i wasn‚Äôt able to place turrets in good firing lines to prevent them from hitting each other.  Wall mounted turrets would help with being able to attack even when mobs are right up next to your base.
---
Step 1: Fast Travel to Teapot and sprint for 2 seconds

Step 2: Hop Servers

Step 3: ???

Step 4: Profit!

Just kidding, we all know what step 3 is üôÉ
---
Lol, this great! One of the many reasons I haven‚Äôt purchased atoms yet. Game has been out for a while and this still happens!
---
Lack of taste
---
I found other people on the map that needed the same help. Pretty easy to knock out. You just have to talk to people.
---
I set my gun to 0 and he took it, i know its my own stupidity but i have never had any problem trading like that since the game launched
---
"Can I have the shiny thing on your arm?"
---
I grinded my 8 tokens via this event so, while I did not keep an exact count, just know that it does work. Maybe it's 1/3 token per event.
---
I was hyped for this game, all through the whitesprings event and lauch I thought it looks amazing, my family got it for me at Christmas and then I played it.
---
personally multiplayer is not my thing but since you barely met anyone I really don't mind and I enjoy this game a lot. my problem is the difficulty spike
---
I finished the mission just before the nuke launch at level 39 and only now at level 76 have i completely a silo with # level 200s who just happened to find me half dead and even now I'm no where near powerful enough to fight the scortch beast Queen and even lvl50 scortchbeast are a problem.
---
Oh hey, I've seen Broken Arrow before.

Fantastic!

I have server hopped over 4 dozen times

Why not feral ghoul tornadoes? No! Deathclaw tornadoes.

It has 1 damage resistance. 
---
They changed a bunch of stuff in the last patch.
---
I'm pretty sure Bethesda has an algorythm that identifies when items have been duped.  Certain items (or possibly all items-not sure) have a unique item number tied to it.  So when it detects duplicate numbers, it removes the additional items.  I'm not sure how the algorythm is deployed, but I know they ran it a while back and that's when many duped items were removed.  I know it didn't remove all of them though.
---
You propably already found it but when coming to the building area from main gates go left towards the cliffs.
---
I oppose this, bethesda made it that way intentionally and this disrupts the intended experience.

---
I've been trying to milk every Brahmin i've come across since I picked up the Pioneer Scouts quest.  All week.  Not a single challenge point or Brahmin Milk acquired.
---
When someone come to my CAMP I tend to go there because some people don't care to kill the enemies and they will most likely destroy parts of my base...
---
I just found a couple old man winter masks sitting at a train station in a suitcase.. apparently, people have been dropping them everywhere all day for free
---
Also 1* pool cues from Queen fights! Some reason no flux from the last fight.
---
After 6 months of sh*tty drops and glitched drops or queen crashes i welcome our duping overlords to flood the wasteland with what we all want. Hot, sweaty loot at dirt cheap prices.

Looking forward to the next ban wave. xD

What is the intended experience you are referring to?

Imagine you did make him your companion.

Then, imagine what the conversation between you and him would be like once you didn't want him as a companion anymore.

r/redditsings
---
I thought they  patched this a while back. Guess not.
---
This is a long shot, but are you crafting them yourself? Maybe you have that perk that makes them extra high condition.
---
Edit: whoops, read it again. Sorry. Yeah, maybe it's just some kind of unwritten part of the perks you have?
---
There are also some on the street behind the restaurant.
---
I think it does?
---
Escape artist has done this since at least when I started playing, around Christmas. 
---
I like it.
---
Do whatever you deem interesting at the time. There is a lot of game outside of the quests so you'll miss a lot if you just focus on those.
---
If you can come up with 2000 caps I can Hook you up with a T- 51 torso, jetpack and frame.
---
Just looked. The mask has been duped and is for sale on ebay. Lmao this is so sad.
---
Nope. Was at a camp this morning, guy was there and had a lot of 3 star gear. So I'm inspecting it, checking out the effects. Moving down the line of vending machines. He had a level 1 splody gun that was out of my price range so I wanted to see what other crazy good stuff he had.
---
I start getting punched. I figure I'm holding up a line, but no, nobody else is there. I go to the next machine. Haven't bought anything, yet, I want to see all he's got, not spend all my caps on the first nice thing. 
---
He keeps punching me. He's level 4 and I'm in pacifist mode so it's not like he's hurting me. Just pissing me off. I didn't even look in the last machine. Walked off with him giving the confused and follow me emote. 
---
Dude has some serious customer service issues to work on.
---
Yes. This is also a dirty trick. Sometimes people will invite you, have a workshop their friend is about to take from then to make them hostile and a third friend nearby to kill you when they turn the workshop. Works anywhere. Gotta be careful about what team invites you accept and careful whenever you have a workshop. Grahm is right, floor not safe, no where safe.
---
I feel we need 2 perk trees, one with effects such as durability and damage buffs and standard perks with the cards and then a second more traditional one for perks that are always active being your crafting, scrapping, hacking, locking, ect
---
the amount of times I have scrapped +50 weapons just to find out I didn't swap in the scrapper perk is to many to count
---
I went around for a few days and bought a lot of em.  Biggest stack I had was 45.
---
That's what gave me the idea.. I thought it happened recently but wasn't able to recreate it so I thought I must have been a fluke.
---
PC, check the keys hints :)
---
Yep nothing rare anymore
---
They are in lots of chest/toolboxes.
---
they end up under misc in your inventory.
---
you dont repair them, you craft a new one at tinkers bench using broken one as a part. (same menu as making film)
---
Lol i just asked if these were available in another post complaining about crops being glitched.  I live on some rocky ground and my house is fairly big, but i have nice flat roofs that would be perfect to put a garden on.
---
I put letters over extermination and made it say abortion. You don't want the vault to get too crowded
---
The hotel. I got it within ten hops the other night. If you were PS4, I'd do the hopping for you and wait for you there. I've done it before for people here.
---
Where in relation to the statue?  Id rather not watch a 12 minute video if I don‚Äôt have to.
---
I know that feeling all too well. My buddy got it his first load in - I swear it took me weeks to find the dang thing. To be honest, it got to the point I rarely looked at my screen - just browse the forums and use the music as your que to run, all the button presses are the same so it was pretty easy to multitask.
---
Edit: I wish you luck!
---
Yeah same maybe it‚Äôs a luck thing or chance
---
Honestly, with so many quest rewards being level based, the best thing a player can do is do everything after they're level 50. Besides, it's too fun just exploring the world, so why not?
---
I‚Äôll give you a tip. I‚Äôm not sure if you frequent White Springs but there is a level 0 terminal in the general managers office of the resort. Since I visit that area a lot and I used to check the vendors for legendary items, I would hit that terminal each time on my way in. I went from 36 to 56 pretty quickly and that‚Äôs how many it took for me before the achievement popped.
---
Yeah, almost (if not all) of the cosmetic headgear provides 1+ Dam resist, but they are not damageable or repairable. Edited my prevoius reply...
---
Happens with a perk if ur sprinting
---
It was called banning dupers. No really, that's their solution, and I CANNOT wait for the next ban wave. Gonna make popcorn, and spend the week reading how the poor cheaters got banned, and Bethesda is bad for kicking them off the game.  xD
---
I politely asked a level 3 to die in water for me. Took me 10 minutes literally
---
Best thing to do is find someone to boost it with. You‚Äôll have it done within 30-45 min and then never have to worry about it again. You‚Äôll also get a lot of revives at Encryptid event if you hang out there.
---
A customer of mine was nice enough to figure it out with me.  After numerous failed attempts to incapacitate ourselves with grenades in a ditch in the Cranberry Bog, we discovered that Reddit's tip to use the stream at Whitesprings was spot-on to grab both challenges at the same time.
---
Im on PS4
---
It‚Äôs literally right in front of the statue. I got mine at the miners monument though
---
Lol it's 430 pm here so probably not until tomorrow for you.  I will add you, ever see me on ping me!
---
:( The wasteland really is dangerous. Thanks.
---
A vendor option on the backpack would be a great addition.
---
This is a known bug
---
Definitely not. The in game market is absolutely destroyed from it
---
Alright
---
They wanted the goofy map without a grid.
---
Yeah have you been stalked by flatwoods monster yet? I‚Äôm hearing  that weird power hum a lot lately, especially around camp .
---
Everyone is a fascist according to people like you. You've stripped any real meaning away from the word by using it so falsely.
---
because it is the future and houses float on little pillars. am i the only one who remembers the jetsons?
---
Nice! I'm getting back on in about five minutes. Add skellyassassin and I'll message you when I've got him.
---
Works great but my buddy keeps fully dying instead of me being able to revive? Any thoughts
---
Because of the 10% that was a at a loss!
---
Too many, and too many of them are me jumping around at my camp because idk it‚Äôs fun.
---
There are different mothmans, you can tell by the name. One of them just runs away, the stalking mothman I believe, the vengeful mothman is one that will fight you.
---
Only good TSE I got was level 35 pump shotgun. I've had things like broadsiders, tesla rifles and railway rifles but they all suck but people still buy them.
---
And this vendor coming will be great. I will be grinding out legendarys to get that one 3* from them each day.
---
Hope I didn‚Äôt buy a duped item
---
Cool thanks but i'm in no rush it's my last one for my Platinum so i'll just wait for when that event pops up.
---
IGN pgriff46 I can help with that. I need to revive someone in water myself.

I would like to have one of the mask but dont wanna pay that much to lose it.. I feel you on the getting good weapons cheap thing but I remember getting my BE laser made me feel gitty like a kid again lol
---
yeap, it became work.
---
Tell me about it I keep getting wood pieces they really need to add another boss so they can spread the loot pool a bit and that way we'll have more end game bosses
---
I too have wondered what a more populated world would be like.
---
Can a server handle 50 or 100 players?  It would be interesting to see it happen.
---
I hope bethesda will delete their accounts . Not banned. Deleted.

WoW has literally had glitches that wipe out entire populations of players to the point that it gets studied by the Center for Disease Control. If you haven't heard of the ways their game's break, it's because you haven't bothered to look
---
Ran into my first duper last night, he had a (actually really nice) CAMP set up in Flatwoods, right next to other houses so it looked it it belonged.  Dude had thousands of Nuka Grenades and Nuke Quantum Grenades, and even dumped a bunch in the mailbox out front.  I accidentally picked them up because there was also a handful of scrap in the mailbox (not sufficient quantity to make me think those were duped too) and wondered how I jumped to 1200 lbs overencumbered.  Put the grenades back into the mailbox and noped out of there.

Cod is a multiplayer game that has a single player experience in it that stays catered too. Fo76 included cards like Lone Wanderer for people to use when they play alone, so it should still cater to people who choose the solo route they provided and not throw up barriers to force you back into trying co-op. 
---
Although I'm a solo 76 player, I didnt have to work that hard to complete this. You'd be surprised how many people are in the same boat and are just hanging out at the Pioneer Scout Camp waiting for a like minded fellow to come along so you guys can revive each other and get back to solo play.
---
I want a Mk 10 thats just the .50cal machine gun as an automated turret.
---
Do you use the adrenaline perk? they did a fix to how it was displaying damage
---
Yeah i know of a bunch of lvl 0 terminals (at about 1200 hours in game, 3 characters totaling a lil over 400 lvls) i just hate hacking i loathe doing it.. even knowing hacking a comp i can turn off turrets and short cut a silo by about 10 minutes i would rather waste the ammo destroying turrets and walk the 15 min long way around..
---
Edit: spelling
---
Its sad that doing the event 50+ times didnt reward it to us. Instead We have to find it in the trash months later.

Added back. Starting my quest for Ansel now.

I took a quick break since so I hadn‚Äôt noticed lol

OTOH, the poor bugger running pylons is downed every 10-20sec.

All you have to do is not shoot back. They already nerfed pvp caps in adventure, nerfed pvp caps in survival, cant wreck camps in adventure, cant even return fire on a turret thats killing you in survival.

One more round of complaints from babies like you and they'll take away everyones guns and we can just call this game second life.  OP sux.

Can you do this if you repair one of the broken cameras found as junk now?  Or do you have to find the tourist before you can start?

I‚Äôm finding broken cameras all over the place these days

I don't see any, sadly :/
---
meeeoow
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going anywhere, but I‚Äôm pretty sure the next DLC will drop before I become a possum scout
---
You have a big WARNING SIGN when you take a workshop saying that workshop= PVP. If you want to avoid that simply don't fight back and let it go. Or man up and don't cry about it.
---
The classic you get behind them and ill shove them over you routine.
---
Sickleman has a few in there hot tub.
---
Accurate to the area IRL too.
---
Didn‚Äôt they fix this in the last patch?  Thought you had to be in the area if they steal the workshop for someone to get to you now
---
On top of the monorail near garraham mining headquarters
---
They are not getting smarter, owning a workshop  always put you in PvP if someone contested it. There's your problem, you didn't read that big warning sign that says that.
---
If this is true it sounds great to me
---
I actually like them... i had one floating over a lake, it was awesome

If you‚Äôre at a workshop cry on buddy is a part of the game

that picture is terrifying to me for some raisin.

Did you check the possum terminal to see if you got a possum badge? That's what I thought I was getting the 1st couple times I did it and then realized I had to badges without having done any of the grinding events

A heavy gunners warning / advice...
---
I‚Äôm working on my 4th character.  I have of beaten the game and exhausted the quests on the prior three.  Having collected many guns and attained many hard to find items along the way, heavy gunners are by far the hardest to equip, play, and maintain.  
---
I would not say that you cannot play them or that they are not playable without reasources from alternates, but ohh my does it help a lot!  
---
In order of ease to play: Melee, shotguns, handguns, rifles, heavy weapons.  Why this order?  
---
1. Perk availability for heavy guns starts at level 35.  2. Ammunition consumption for heavy guns is very high. (Ammosmith 2, and super duper 3 are essential)
---
3. Without stabilized (35+levels, intelligence perk) your spread and climb are horrendous.  
---
4. Vats is nearly useless.
---
5. Weapon weight (with bear arms) is still high.  
---
6. Level planning and perk acquisition are not ideal for heavy weapon builds till after 60+ Levels on most characters, (not counting those ammo/repair/super perks).  
---
All that said, they do the best damage and are super fun to play!  Kinda make ya feel like Rambo at times...  I consistently find myself on my faithful melee alt farming mats for ammunition.  
---
Recommended weapons:  Gatlin 5mm crank version has surprisingly good ammo conservation compared to other heavy weapons.  Any harpoon guns, do very decent damage perked out and more often that not give back ammo.  The .50 is a great close quarters gun, but a serious ammo hog.  
---
Not trying to nay-say heavies but I have to keep it honest!, 
---
Hope you enjoy yours!

Huh! I‚Äôve launched 2 nukes recently with no turrets, and the first time I just figured someone was ahead of me in the silo and didn‚Äôt make it all the way through. When it happened the second time, though, I was wondering if it was a change since I‚Äôd had turrets all the way through every other time I‚Äôve launched before.

If your looking for more x01 mods you can now get plans from enclave production wing terminals.

Hell yeah!

I've passed up many a 3 star Lever because if this glitch, it breaks my heart.

I had the problem too just install it in the same folder and after 5 min. its done because its still there only the launcher is bugged!

---
You can also find the pro camera in other containers. I've found 3 or 4 in tool boxes (not the old camera, the new pro one)
---
I don't think you can sell them as my vending machine couldn't take them and if you drop them then they get destroyed as they are quest items
---
seems like a natural direction to go in as things develop
---
The guy has it as well, Ansel. I got mine off him
---
you can messege the camp owner and see if they can come back so you can inspect. if i see somone at my camp i hop back because of this. hope they fix it.
---
Another satisfied customer. :D
---
It can be either Anne or Ansel. Mine was a dude.
---
Both have the camera
---
im at full hp and it shows dmg increase
---
also i have no enemies killed and it shows dmg increase
---
Go to the lighthouse I got mine there first time.
---
It‚Äôs not the location of the nuke, most nukes are dropped where that one is without issues.  
---
My theory is that it‚Äôs when the person that had agro of the queen gets disconnected, she gets a bad update on location and takes off, and you can‚Äôt get her back because nobody can regain agro on her.
---
I'm guessing you crafted them or bought them from someone who did. The ones I craft come out at 117% charge due to having 8 INT.

I think you might be glitching, I almost always get the red mark on my compass. 
---
Now that I think about it, it might only show up if they're aggro'd toward you/searching for you... Testing required. Will report.
---
Yeah, my guess was they implemented a quick stealth boy move to help with enemies still having sight on you. It was pretty inconsistent before they switched it. Not perfect, but a little better now.
---
Behind the Mothman poster
---
Could be, some of the challenges aren‚Äôt getting checked off like creating a frog habitat for herpetologist.
---
My bad, missed that.  Seem like a fair number of folks didn't notice the new place since they were oddly not in military wing.
---
Done it there myself only problem I killed the robots so I had to deal with a Mr handy while I got them.
---
Not after the last patch, at least according to the patch notes. The owner has to enter the boundary of the workshops before being flagged for pvp. Additionally other players cannot damage objects placed in a workshop unless they are actively contesting it.
---
I am totally on your site I already wrote a mail to Bethesda as I realized what happened with the survival mode.
---
Yeah that's how I do it. Lots of people visit me without buying anything. No hard feelings, it's just business.
---
Use bare hands, if anything is equipped the bonus doesn't seem to kick in for me.
---
This must be how the White Glove Society started.
---
I had an instance maybe 2 months after realise of the game i encountered him, got him to half health and then he bailed and it was a crazy fight. My 2nd time seeing the mothman randomly he attacked and literally ran away right away, i was pissed lol. The 3rd time i was fighting him and i did 1/4 damage to him, he did a swooping attack and in doing so his legs? Got crippled (shot him as he flew by) and he was just trying to crawl away. I killed him then and didnt feel good about it but leaving him to suffer was a worse fate. Plus loot so...  Yeah üòÇ
---
Sure am
---
I get that occasionally. I dont get what kind of support it needs. Emotional support? I usually spam the place button till it goes thru.
---
I thought at first it was due to the Power User perk but it made it seem like my actions would just use less power than it increasing the amount of charge each has so I'm not sure.
---
I'm still missing a few plans and got a ton of the regular masks... anyone wants to hang, or trade hit me on xbox.. gt same as username

Ah, I did not know that was a benefit and that makes sense.  I forgot a while back I did craft a couple a month or more ago and I used to have like 12 int. so that explains it.  Thank you
---
Actually, the game doesn't rely on playing together. With small exceptions, everything can be achieved solo. I have more than 500 hours into solo playing. I did kill over 40 queens only with randoms ( before TSE existing and after the nerf).
---
I suspect it used to have an invisibility effect internally, but you couldn't see it until a few patches back. Before that, there was an exploit where you could use a combination of Escape Artist and cloaking or chameleon armor to become permanently invisible.
---
Hmmmmm. What is going on here, Todd?
---
Only you can see your whole inventory
---
Don‚Äôt you just talk to the mr. handy there?
---
 Feel like there‚Äôd be a direct correlation between the high rating of a camp and how much they payed in the atomic shop
---
Have you tried survival mode? It isn't all just PvP, there's definitely more to it than just a name..
---
I played two days whole. Did 3 challenges and had 13 badges from event. I was grinding way more in world of warcraft. So i am enjoying it in some weird way.
---
I need some help as well on xbox; GT cheesybreazy if anyone is around this afternoon.
---
Yeah, the worst case scenario is it might take a player a few moments to "load" if they fast travel to you or something.. but that's entirely fixed, for a long time now. Think in January?
---
No but getting plenty of wooden armor.
---
Just hang around the forest and follow around the low levels till one dies. That‚Äôs how I did it.
---
Just did the quest on Xbox. Thanks anyway!
---
I have a few I've picked up. I'm thinking of selling them for, say, 500 caps each.
---
I got em in one of the train station vendors - Sutton or somewhere near recently.
---
They're the asshole, 500 caps is super good shocks
---
Congrats, it's a lot of work, I almost cried lol
---
Have to make sure no one shoplifts. I‚Äôm not running a Walmart.
---
They‚Äôre the asshole.
---
500 is a goddamn steal.
---
Whaaaaaat? Darnit.
---
No I didn't, :( had no idea until one of the friendly fellow redditors pointed it out. Still feeling silly about it XD
---
Them. There are plenty of other traders/ ways to get anything in the game. Make it 5 billion caps, it doesn't change their game in any way.
---
Yes! I knew there was somewhere with a few skulls but couldn't remember. thank you :)
---
Lucky you the game swallowed up my shielded bos outfit.
---
They are. 500 for them shocks is cheap.
---
It's more worse than before now.
---
Perfect, so just very perfect.
---
Yeah, i just wished they didn‚Äôt use flux. It‚Äôs extremely hard to get a hold of
---
Anybody have the answer key to the Possum Exams?
---
Wearing a clown costume
---
I‚Äôve sold them for 1k each in the past and have sold a few sets . I think 500 is more than fair but some people will bitch if they wipe there ass with a hundred dollar bill just for the sake of bitching . Don‚Äôt take it personally block them and move on .
---
After this last update, a LOT of people are playing again or for the first time. I just started a new build and find full severs and other stuff I haven't seen since launch. Good sign for the game, bad for looting... BSG better reduce cool down times of locations or spread everyone else out.
---
One of many badges not being able to be completed.. It's a shame, seeing how much time you have to invest before coming to the conclusion you're just 1 step away from getting the badge.. Here are my personal observations so far: **\*SPOILERS\***
---
From my knowledge the musician is bugged when trying to play instruments like OP said, both at specific locations, or instrument.
---
**Cook** is dependant on the new Campfire Story event that is buggy to say the least - as well as getting the recipe as a reward in the first place (S'mores).
---
**Codebreaker** depends on launching a friggin nuke! As a scout..
---
**Entomologist** depends on getting the mothman to spawn in the first place - THEN getting a wing fragment as a loot drop (which doesn't always drop) and he might just teleport away anyway..
---
**Herpetologist** depends on making a frog habitat that can't be build/doesn't update for the few who can build it (hearsay)
---
**Medic** depends on Stimpack Diffuser - a recipe that won't drop until the next dungeon is released (Project Paradise).
---
**Swimmer** needs you to revive another player while in water. Now this isn't exactly impossible.. I know. But I haven't done that a single time, and I've played since launch almost daily. Just another annoying wall of a challenge.
---
**Photographer** depends on you being able to take a photograph of a vertibot and a cargobot, again.. Not impossible, simply very very tedious.. You have to basically be right next to either of them for the camera to register it. Best way to do this is the Morgantown Airport event where a cargobot lands at the end, and the grafton steel CAMP where a vertibot launchpad can be built/repaired (same with poseidon I think).
---
**Leatherworker** depends on if you are lucky enough to find Deathclaw Hides (junk item) to drop. Yeah, sounds simple right? You'd think it drops from Deathclaws.. Nope! Any other "boss" creature has a chance of dropping them. Can also be found in containers. When you need to find the buggers, they're nowhere to be found.. Again, kinda annoying..
---
**Electrician** depends on you being able to "become the conduit" a whopping SIXTY TIMES (60!) during the very finite Encryptid event, the one with the Imposter Sheepsquatch.. You know, the event no one does anymore since it costs caps to create the cards and people are stingy.. And again, 60 times.. I'd wager you'd be able to to it maybe 10 times per event, seeing how many people are going to be desperate for this from now on.. Going to be fun!
---
**Collector** depends on finding all the Unstoppables comics.. nuff said, try forcing that to happen fast..
---
**Chemist** depends on you being able to craft Serums.. AND use them.. You know, the recipes that cost upwards of 18k at the Enclave Bunker?! I know, there's a boatload of people who has leftovers from the duping days etc, but still.. Really? Had to add that to the badge?
---
Yea only if aggro from what I've noticed (with 3 per)
---
My guess is you're on PC? I'm on PS4 and the only issue I've got is occasional freezing in menus/map. I did have a freezing/lag issue where it would happen every 2 minutes, but deleting the save data seems to have mostly cleared it up..
---
Ok, cool- thanks guys (or ladies)!
---
Intelligence effects the condition of all crafted items so a higher stat will produce overcharged cores. Did you craft some or maybe buy some from another player?
---
Nope, I saw a non-legendary one yesterday. The first in like 15 encounters
---
That'd be cool.
---
That'd be cooler.
---
*Donald Trump intensifies*
---
Make sure you do it in water that way the swimming task one is done at the same time.
---
Never? I've gotten 3 flare guns and 2 syringers in one day once...
---
Impostor sheepsquatch?
---
Interesting, I've only ever seem legendaries, some without stars
---
You can fast travel to any friends you have on a server, too. It isn't just teammates.
---
This was heartwarming
---
jokes on you. i know how to get stuff without a workshop. and im melee so no ammo for me.
---
You‚Äôre exactly right about everything. I wanted to clear up the herpetologist thing since you mentioned it. It‚Äôs very easy to build as it just requires crafting a glass jar, and catching a frog at the whitesprings pool by the golf course. The problem is that it doesn‚Äôt count as built. I can confirm this personally. Still hearsay technically I guess.
---
&gt;Don‚Äôt take it personally block them and move on .
---
That's exactly what I did. I was mainly wondering if I really was overcharging, because I haven't see anyone else selling them.
---
Is it confirmed you‚Äôre able to buy one per day? That‚Äôd be pretty stupid
---
Don't do survival mode? 
---
Problem solved.
---
Agreed I seem to only have it once I taunt/pull a spawn... It shouldn‚Äôt be like this. In previous games it displayed before even noticing/seeing most mobs/spawns... What the hell...
---
OMG my melee build could use some rad resistance yesssssss
---
Random chance and workshops, sadly.
---
In survival mode it's fine, no slap damage.. just PvP. In adventure mode it's pretty much been removed, which is great. Probably the way it should have always been honestly.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure. I wish you could get it for the combat knife the Bowie isn‚Äôt the same :-/
---
Often seen near my camp which is towards the more from pleasant valleybstatooknqt top of the world. Start from the station and walk down hill across country towards the radio dish. Usually turns up there.
---
Didn‚Äôt know you could do that in workshops - great hint!
---
Well we did get shafted by the event as a very few got them and I meet few from what I read.
---
backpacks are treated like atom shop items. 
---
no trading, deletes when dropped.
---
Radscorpion horde followed me from Willards to the prison
---
Any Old Man Winter masks in game are duped, as no one got one legit, and if you find someone selling dozens on eBay...well.
---
Damn that sux,couple disapering and no legendarys at all i had to,but no flare guns or syringers luckely
---
I've had this problem before when multiple people are joining a server at one time.  Be patient and wait. The server can't handle everyone at once, so it puts you in a cue in the order you came in to join.  Once the person in front of you loads in, you're next in line.  Sometimes it takes several minutes.  You may miss out on a timed event, but you should eventually be able to join.
---
Well if it's that terrible, there are plenty of other games you should play. Go ahead and uninstall 76. Good luck!
---
Excuse moi?? There's a bowie knife paint???
---
Hope they plan on receivers, barrels, and stocks soon. This gun is awesome now.
---
Random locations around the map. You can try server hopping at Wavy Willard‚Äôs. It‚Äôs the easiest one to see the body you have to loot. It‚Äôll be a dead person in a tourists outfit. 
---
It could bug and not have the list for the quest, be careful.
---
By non explosive it means weapons that arent the fat man, missile launcher, or grenade launcher. Even tho my weapon is two shot explosive, i get buffs for the heavy weapon perks because it doesnt use explosive ammo
---
Maybe they're calling you an asshole because they think you are under-priced? Some people over on the market sub are having an existential crisis because the other 98% of the player base are selling things in their stash way below what their market was bearing beforehand.
---
Yes, it is broken for me too
---
Idk I've only been able to finish it once since apparently no one wants to be the conduit and I got a combat arm so not very great
---
And there are lists on google too. (Maybe try looking it up first next time?)
---
I don‚Äôt think 500 is overpriced at all considering the price of the plans, the server hopping to find them. I‚Äôve seen some crazy prices since vending hit but haven‚Äôt called anyone out on it I just move to the next vendor. Your price is fine !
---
I had mine at over 2000 with max adrenaline I was laughing most I ever got before was 800.
---
I live in my excavator armor but I still use marsupial and I think strong back
---
...just ask someone
---
It's a very rare event that doesn't seem to pop up as often as other events.
---
Only times I've been able to do it was when it was on the map, but maybe try talking to the Mr handys there?
---
A 3* legendary weapon is 100 scrip. You can get a max of 150 scrip per day.
---
There is the Berry Mentats drug that allows you to see the shadow of the enemy.. That‚Äôs about it for me though.... I don‚Äôt know why they took out the compass display of hostile enemies before actually encountering most of them... unless I‚Äôm glitched this whole play through and have been screwing myself??
---
Bruhhh I'm sorry I usually get that from the queen
---
I'm actually waiting for my no-longer-plays honey to come home so he can stand in the river near my camp so I can get a twofer!  Wqiting impatiently for my backpack.
---
ooooooo really? That sounds awesome! just coming back today since launch and I was lost af haha
---
Now look at that feature! Cutting edge feature right there in the palm of your hand!
---
Hahaha
---
HC decreases rad resistance by 60, and armored only increases damage resistance. Lead lined is +90 rad resist though (I think)
---
Well, my trick works if you have the plan. Also, try using a workshop. Apparently you can place more than one of the fertilizer producers, making this trick even faster.
---
You citing juicehead
---
So change the game back to where it had almost no players and no one was happy?  If you want to play rust, take all 12 of you and go play rust. The thousands of us that like this game now can just stay here.
---
Roger, will edit post accordingly. Thanks for chiming in! :)
---
nice
---
That should be a ban-able offense
---
Now i remember the times i server hoped like crazy to get one. Now i really am glad i never spent money on the shop. I do respect their work and i appreciate they try so hard , but F76 isn't the kind of game that deserves to spend money on.
---
I wouldn't mind if the drills where legendary.
---
Uhm... but you DO know that this topic is about dupe glitches right? Like, did you read the topic at all before writing? At all?
---
And again, if you HAD actually read, i never said that other games don't have glitches. They just don't have the same one in literally every patch. And even if they have such a bug they usually fix it rather quickly, usually even in hotfixes. Bethesda adds a new one with nearly every patch and just asks people to not use it untill they might maybe get around to fixing it some day.
---
No matter what you think and feel this game is meant to be played with other people.
---
Git  gud .
---
A level 30 player can easily kill a level 200 player. And if you are decent at the game you can kill a group of them if they are all melee.
---
All equipment are normalized for pvp so it's fair for low level players. And if people chose to go solo they should avoid these groups of people.
---
I'm a solo player and I don't like pvp but I've tried it a few times and I've wiped player groups out.
---
Juicehead is an idiot. Also if a YouTube video has a thumbnail of Todd Howard it's for first hint not to click it.
---
I...I honestly didn't think of that.
---
There‚Äôs a mounted cats head in a house to the west of Morgantown. I‚Äôm not sure if you can take a pic of any or it has to be the specific location?
---
It just didnt load lmao, dont panic and switch servers
---
It kinda reminds me of No Mans Sky. People stopped playing soon after release but one or two updates later they were back to check out the new game.
---
What perks are you running that it‚Äôs doing 490? Is that at 20% health?
---
Closest thing we're probably going to get anytime soon is the Ford Courier. Subaru has gotten really bland lately and there is much demand for compact trucks with lesbian-hikers.
---
did i miss something? his video is pretty detailed and he plays multiple datamined audio files that really point to NW being some sort of BR mode.
---
It's a shame we cannot trade those. That would be a best seller.
---
Well I hope it's not like a battle royale mode nowadays, more with a twist. I mean I was hoping for more a game mode that has a more difficult environment, with body temperature and other hard core survival aspects, but I'm not against the Nuclear Winter mode, but I know once I've complete all the challenges and gotten access to Vault 51, or just whatever you get, I ain't gonna go near it, PvP isn't my bread and butter :/
---
But hey, sounds incredible interesting and not too bad!
---
Interesting observation.  I hadn't thought of that.
---
I don't think I've gotten a three star from a three star enemy on like a month. Plenty of crap their stuff, And two 2* nocturnal weightless legs, which I use a tonight since they weigh basicslly nothing
---
I did an AWOL this morning! They still exist!
---
Radscorpion Plagues
---
Yeah, this.
---
Fast travel is free to your camp, your team mates camps, any workshops you own, the vault, and team mates/people on your friends list
---
You could make 5 serums with that 5 flux and sell them all for 500, and you‚Äôd still be giving people a good deal. Putting all 5 flux into one thing and selling it for the same price as one serum is a great deal, nevermind the cost of plans. Hell, even just the materials alone are almost worth that. 
---
If anyone is off base, it‚Äôs the person who can find anything to actually be upset about here.
---
I had one show up just now while I was fighting a Scorchbeast.
---
The scorchbeast started glowing pink and I was confused. I started looking around and saw the Flatwoods Monster nearby, attacking the Scorchbeast.
---
[I couldn't pass up the chance though](https://i.imgur.com/WO2IJ5k.jpg)
---
How do you figure? You want PvP, there's survival mode. If you don't, there's adventure mode. It's the way it should have been from the start, give assholes a place to thrive.
---
Oh, man. Sorry but i laughed so hard when you gave away his name. It's fucking funny
---
What area are you in? 
---
Some areas the enemies scale up if a higher level player is near by, and some areas are just higher level.
---
I'd suggest taking a break from the main quest and do some exploring, camp building, crafting, and side quests/events to level up. 
---
My main character is a sneaky sniper, so I did the Brotherhood quests while still about level 25-ish (2 ranks of sneak) all in a level 45+ zone. It's do able but way tougher if you're under level and solo.
---
I think bloodied is better than both but with AA you can also use vats crits better than TS
---
Maybe Snap n‚Äô Build will have a private server mod when they start. Hopefully.
---
I usually check their wares and see what they specialize in. If it's plans Ill drop a known plan, and if it's weapons I'll drop a crappy legendary for them. I wasn't using any of it anyway, and maybe they can find a seller/ scrip it
---
Garbage in my opinion... don‚Äôt get me wrong the perks in perception are a lifeline to my character, but a lot of the things that screw with my play style are not getting the jump on players... V.A.T.S. Is a great component to this game if you have difficulty aiming, but the fact that you can lock on so easily and basically watch tv while you destroy everything with a few shots... ugh just not fun in my opinion.
---
lol, I think I unloaded a full clip on someone who came up behind me." Sorry, thought you were a Yao Guai."
---
It's working. I went through a spell where it didn't fire and i had to repair my armor for the first time in a while, and then yesterday it fired like five times while playing. It's just a bit wonky I guess.
---
Unfortunately it needs to be specific location.
---
I can't use ear buds on Xbox.  Stupid quite, but perfect if I have the party on my phone (just disconnects alot)
---
i had someone get pissed because I was selling magazines for 50.
---
later I went to the only other shop on the map, they were there too, and saw that that guy was selling them for 400 each.
---
I can only imagine the message that dude got.
---
dude still never bought mine
---
Where is this mythical land that you speak of?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs at full bloodied 20%. It‚Äôs doing 503 to be exact. Just the rifleman perks, tenderizer, nerd rage I think those are the only one to affect it. Also prime receiver
---
Just like many RL Olympics athletes. :D
---
Walmart syndrome. You notice how people at Walmart ALWAYS block an entire aisle with their cart parked perpendicular to the shelves or park the cart on the right and stand on the left? That's those people playing....   I only go to Walmart for cheap diet Fresca but it's always a trial trying to get to it...
---
I know or if they did more damage
---
I had this issue last night but mine was with an upper floor and it kept saying that there was another object in the way...not sure what was going on with it, ended up having to place 1x1 floor pieces to get as much of the floor as possible built
---
Todd Howard or the vault boy with the upside down smile. Either of those is a massive red flag
---
Workshops are where it's at. Claiming is like 200+ xp, and then the defend mission is about two minutes later for another 200+ xp. Plus free stims and plans, almost all of the defend missions are easy if you set up a few turrets. Get pharma farmer(?) Or whatever it's called where you have a chance to find extra cheese in containers. You'll be swimming in stims soon.
---
Lol this is so stupid it is hilarious!  Loooool I vote radroachnado!
---
We can only hope
---
Happened to me too. Ended up having to do two regular walls and a flat roof piece. At that point I was so annoyed I didn‚Äôt even care it looked odd from the outside.
---
This is a mood
---
turn the volume up then
---
I'm just casually working my way through the badges by playing the game. The challenges are adding a nice spin on life in the game.  Plus it forced me to use a crossbow which is super fun.
---
Stop watching the tools on YouTube.
---
Thank you for your advice but I've already deleted *Fallout76.ini* &amp; *Fallout76Prefs.ini* and then relaunched game before asking a question here.
---
Also vault 76 is always a free travel point, I like setting my camp up near Seneca rock, it's 5 caps to Top of the World, and only 12 to whitesprings. Both of which spawn high level but fairly easy to defeat enemies.
---
Not if you have sunkissed.
---
Yeah, I'm lvl 117 and I don't think I have EVER gotten a 3 star with the exception of today by completing the task that rewards you the named gatling gun that is always 3 star.
---
I got killed by a lv 19 and I‚Äôm lv 100 something bc the world wouldn‚Äôt load in on survival the weapons are probably a little too balanced especially if your Built rightüòÇ
---
I don‚Äôt really like Bloodied but I am working on a Uny set to use it as an alt setup sometimes because yeah, the damage is insane. 
---
Looking to optimize my Handmade on my non-bloodied setup. 
---
VATs crits isn‚Äôt much of an issue because I use an IE Lever for those, but that‚Äôs good to know. 
---
I‚Äôm just not certain how DR exactly works. Like, how much more damage are you receiving if it‚Äôs ignoring 50% of your DR?
---
Yeah, it has always been a bother to me that the game was marketed as fun for solo or group play.  I feel like perk cards were designed solely with group play in mind where you would ‚Äòshare‚Äô them with your teammates.
---
Turtle beaches are nice but they are expensive
---
Some people think dupers are fiction after the ban.... They've been duping and prospering very well. The difference is they know how to fly under the radar now. I'd report. If BSG is serious this guy will be perma-banned, if not you'll see him next week selling new hot OP gear by the dozens.
---
Fast clap like the roar of freedom from vault 33
---
Speak for yourself I know of thousands of people who like to pvp. The issue is the community of people who dont pvp have the loudest voice. Their is a very large community of people who pvp. Another larger issue is people who dont pvp are the ones spending the $$ on atoms, while ones who do pvp trade and spend in game currency via other forums to get better gear. Bethesda is only going to cater to the ones paying the $$
---
Player vending makes sense, fair prices make sense. Mutations are not "end game", and if you really wanted them you could get them for that price in a market subreddit. Or get mutations and server hop till you get all you want, and use grape nukacola for radiation.. you can do that at level 1.
---
Everything else you mentioned seems really minor honestly. The game is moving in a good direction, and gets better with every update.
---
Yeah, i've noticed. Doing the queen sucks now on PC.I don't even join the fight anymore if there's not a few lvl200+ there. Newer players will get better and we'll start owning her soon enough. I hope
---
Upvote * 10000. I have mine at the vending machine in anticipation!
---
Welcome back! Drop a line if you need any help with anything
---
I think they may be in misc.
---
Saaaaame!
---
No offense, but juicehead is pretty well known for clickbait shitposts. At this point very few people take him seriously, and from what I can tell in his comments section, the only people who watch him are the ones who don't even play the game yet still take time out of their day to shit on the game 6 months after launch. 
---
Still, I doubt the game is getting BR. The feedback from fans has been clear that most of us don't care about pvp. Hell, look at how many people aren't even willing to play survival to get the weekly special weapon. It's a waste of effort because nobody will play it. There won't be enough players for a full match
---
Did you read the maps?
---
Or Radicool.
---
Lol I did not think about itüòõ It did work. Thank You kind sir!
---
The hard part is finding the legs, so f them.  Good on you for trying to sell at a very good price.  They missed outüòÄ
---
Workshops are pretty pointless, haven't touched one in months, plus now camps are indestructible so have fun with your impotent rage
---
I love finding camps, I used to watch for dots in wired places then find them.  This is good.  The game feels more alive, still bleak, but also alive.  I think it needed that.  But I also want  NPC quest givers instead of holo tales so that might not be what B wants..
---
Gotcha I‚Äôm honestly not sure bc it‚Äôs really convoluted with tank killer and piercing rounds (there‚Äôs a max armor ignore limit) and whatever the enemy has (like % dmg reduction from players or sentinel, etc) 
---
Sadly the answer is probably it depends lol..
---
Just wanted to make clear who he was so nobody else gets scammed, although my own stupidity allowed for this scam to happen.
---
Even most animals have armor. If you do the math it rounds out to roughly that percentage of the weapons damage
---
Only done this once, but thank fully i sold a plan i actually bought at another store(left ultracite PA leg) to buy a quad plasmathrower(390 pc capacity) for what i got from my own sale. This is super sick.
---
This sometimes happens to  e when trying to access the speak easy with Biv. I find server Hopi g fixes the issue
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is that being forced to play the way someone else wants ruins your experience? Imagine that. 
---
‚ÄúTalented‚Äù PvP players were given an entire game mode. They didn‚Äôt use it, still preferring to force themselves on others in Adventure. It was still happening when cap rewards were doubled in Survival too, so let‚Äôs not pretend it‚Äôs all about that. 
---
I‚Äôve tried to find ways to justify the existence of PvP in this game. I‚Äôve had some momentary fun with it myself, but more and more, I‚Äôm coming to the conclusion that it just can‚Äôt work.
---
Remove the stairs, place the roof, put the stairs back. You might have to attach a temporary set of stairs somewhere connecting the bottom floors to the top in order to not get the inaccessible object warning.
---
Let me in, LET ME IN!
---
After buying them, where are they in my inventory to read? they aren't in notes
---
Ok thanks for advice I‚Äôm in the black water mine
---
Or the worst time?
---
This is gonna be fallout's battletoad/gamestop thing isn't it
---
pioneer scout bowie knife paint yea
---
Never actually used fast travel on my main character he roams the wasteland on foot exploring the mountain ranges for passes n stumbling into unmarked locations
---
No sweat dude. I thought that's what you thought so I'm glad that's cleared up. I stand by my position re lobbyists, though.
---
Confirmed: it‚Äôs still there
---
My suit will survive 2 more hits now
---
Yeah, I lurk there and watch legendary weapons go for 25k caps. It's totally cool with me for people to buy and sell what they want for whatever price they can get, but don't get mad at others when the market opens up and players are perfectly happy selling off things in their stash  for what you perceive to be below market value.
---
Im all for a BR mode. It would work really well
---
Odd as they were I  the notes section for me to read.
---
Once I read it I got a warning saying reading it would destroy/consume the item. After that I went to data and found the lucky strike quest. Pressing show on map, allowed me to easily locate where I had to go
---
Oh man, I love when the robots spawn instead of ghouls. It's like a free payday at WS. And yea it's a server side issue, when it respawns enemies sometimes they don't respawn with the correct enemies
---
It‚Äôs been a while but I‚Äôm pretty sure you just go back to the obstacle course and talk to that Mr. Gutsy on the second story of the building there. He‚Äôll reissue.
---
True! I think the rationale behind making the bombs smaller in the lore was to not blow everything up and create high radiation.  Much better for sci fi story purposes.
---
I think maybe he is implying, that if the weapons come from another countries server, it flags them???
---
I think there‚Äôs a chance that a possum badge will drop.
---
sounds like they where trying to get you to sell them cheaper
---
It will not start for me.
---
"Welcome to the Pumpkin House" is all I get. :\
---
No, its a glitch. They arent counting
---
Do you just mean Virginia? I‚Äôve never heard of the mythical East Virginia...
---
üò≠ Most amazing thing I‚Äôve heard all day by any chance do you play PS4 I would love to team up!
---
Because I don't want you fucking with terminals that control my lights.
---
I don't have the numbers to back it but my opinion is that AAE is probably better in the long run since you can optimize the stack of armor ignoring through the use of armor piercing rounds and perks on top of the legendary effect where as the extra damage from the 2 shot is a static effect that can also be buffed from the anti armor perks but will still be missing out on that 50% which will hit regardless of what your opponents build is.
---
You're gonna meet like 5 assholes, 500 people who will totally ignore you, and 20 amazing players who want to help and shower you with legendaries and stims and weapons. I really enjoy this community ingame
---
Ah okay. Thanks!
---
I'm actually looking at the turtle beach stealth 600 right now, think that's what I'm gonna buy
---
I always read that as:

"Someone is duping Two Shot Explosives.
---
Controls have been temporarily disabled."
---
I'm Looking for someone to help with revive ally scout challenge / revive ally in  water....?!? I'm assuming just reviving ally in water will check off both challenges?
---
I'm a lonely old PS4 player who lives in Canada and plays every other night at around 9 pm Atlantic time...does anyone else need help completing the quest as well?! I'll kill you if you kill me? lol
---
Gotcha, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm like fuck haha should I just keep the Two Shot or is the AAE an upgrade
---
Good for you.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox One S, the issue normally happens vs scorchbeast + help, the fps tank!
---
I have a theory that we haven't fought the actual mothman, just one of his spawn.
---
Easiest place for hot dogs, in my opinion, is the Gorge Junkyard.  The house on the north part of the workshop has a grill on the back porch.  Always has three hot dogs.
---
Bought mine from a vendor for like 4K lol
---
My camp's set up there for that very reason. The most important factor in deciding my camp's location is the view, secondary are resources and nearby looting spots. Got water, the toolbox nearby spawns plans randomly, a quick run down to Watoga, West Tek to the north... Ballistic fibre too.
---
You have a kind heart
---
You know about the ammocraft card not working correctly?
---
Had 0 rounds of 2mm and crafted 1x and only got 20 rounds and not the 27 as told. 
---
The card is fully upgraded
---
Like the concept, some things i disagree with in my opinion but its good overall. Im on the ps4 though, so finding people in this group for the ps4 is gonna be difficult-er.
---
#1 ranked lesbian power armor in all of Appalachia.
---
It's been doing that to me so what I did is found a pitched roof the kind that comes to a point, in the build inventory and it was wider than the hole I needed to cover and it allowed me to just go ahead and plop it down so that's how I did it.
---
Do it in the white springs pool because that swimmer badge is a pain in the arse
---
cool kids don't use chems
---
Base value is around 7000 i think. It's 6900 for me
---
The game have still 0 endgame part. I don't get the "something to do" ? I completed the game yesterday, did every quest and explored every location. I can't get why a backpack suited with a brief quest, could fill the game with "always something to do". The vending machine is futile for any veteran player. What's the purpose of making caps eventually? To do what? See you when a proper expansion will be released (within next century maybe). Once you have completed the quest, the game will come back immediately back to "boring mode", period.
---
agreed
---
You can add me! Gt is Mabes45
---
Very nice! I wish I had the will to stick to a certain type of build. So far I‚Äôve only got one main character, level 129 with a heavy weapon/melee/rifle hybrid build. Because those exist right?
---
Ugh! Always new glitches with each new patch.
---
They just go to a window and click ‚Äúsit‚Äù on your couch to get in
---
You've done a good deed. I got myself a TS pipe-pistol that i keep for sentimental value but it's only collecting dust, sadly. 
---
Entertained myself today with building that pillar (from the atom shop) and placed it on top of my camp with a cat-shaped bush on top and two death-claws in the same category that i placed on the roof as if surrounding it.
---
Cats act all high and mighty
---
Angry joe in ‚Äúfallout adding LOOTBOXES?!?!?!?!?‚Äù Plus ever other clickbait bullshit YouTuber. Wonder where those lootboxes are now?
---
Tis what I've found online, but it doesn't work.  Have tried in full military fatigues as well.
---
Unfortunately I've gone through the voicefiles myself. They seriously do point to a BR mode, and unlocking parts of vault 51 by winning.
---
It was brilliant! On Xbox sadly mate but seriously considering getting another copy and starting a new character on my wife's PS4 (it's in the bedroom lol so don't know if I'd get any sleeping done!)
---
Yeah, I'll probably go for carry weight and stay on the delicious ionized meat diet.
---
Does the salesman usually sell anomalies?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they can see the items that you‚Äôre carrying if you‚Äôre directly trading. Unless I missed a change in the last update.
---
It‚Äôs dead
---
I'm in the UK and could do with some help with this
---
What system, if you need a hand I'm on xbox gt vegitastorm
---
This exact issue is halting me from playing the game right now.
---
I recently went to rebuild my camp (since I wanted to remove some stuck items) and now I can't place more than half of my camp.
---
It's silly for some I'm sure, but I want my camp site back before I begin scouring the wastes once more.
---
I've probably gotten 6 3* since BETA, all of them fairly terrible. My only good one is a Gatling gun, which is basically the same as the challenge reward one. Some people have amazing luck, I do not.
---
Haha id say just get both and test it for a bit...tho AAE is pretty overpriced atm
---
I did that too for the first month or so. It feels great. Of course after a certain point you just need to use fast travel because quests are all over the map.
---
Better than the Baja, I wish they would bring back the BRAT with the rear facing seats in the bed.
---
I‚Äôd get through rose‚Äôs quests but start spiraling and spacing things out as you go along, as the toxic valley is pretty null right now besides the workshops/pioneer scouts, the mire is a great level up zone, my first character went from 20-33 at a camp outside the boundroes of the tree house village, turret farming fog crawlers :,) plus theres a lead vein up on a cliff above the swamp ti the west!
---
Well when you do or if you get on that PS4 then my gamertag YGB_Phycho Cya in the wasteland man!
---
Scrip it
---
Vengeful and Glowing Mothmen are the only ones that will attack you.
---
That was possible in New Vegas iirc
---
I just mean not having to unequip it to over repair weapons.
---
I got rid of assasians, bolstering, nocturnal, mutant, troubleshooter and junkies. Basically unless you know you will use it 100%, get rid of it. The low level(1-10) I usually give to new players, since most legendaries are lvl 40-50 and still terrible.
---
I‚Äôve noticed a lot of gaming companies follow a 6 month cycle for re-releasing items
---
Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any fix, unfortunately.
---
I honestly wish Bethesda would do something to allow us to become NPC's in the quest giving format. They have given us the ability to setup a trade Network and other in game infrastructures.
---
But they did give me one thing I always wished for and that was to have the ability to turn into a endgame boss to other players. In survival if you see a skeleton in a BOS engineering outfit running at you that was me. I've stalked buildings just waiting for people to walk into my lairs.
---
The one thing I kind of feel is with Reddit reminds me of the vanilla wow lfg and trade chats. I can see why in game they have with held a text system for the more malicious or childish players
---
It's all about that sweet, savory dog food. ;)
---
Change your sheets.
---
And now you understand my problem
---
I am using an unyielding set that I seem to like. That‚Äôs a good set to keep right?
---
PvP is pointless now, they keep nerfing it for no reason. First it was an eighth of the amount of caps and now no more than 50 caps.
---
(Rad-stim-tiss)
---
I'm not arguing it is pay to win and you forget that Bethesda can and does change game balance to suit their purposes. Sure, they don't seem needed now but wait until that creep when they want to encourage you to buy more. I don't like that they give Bethesda an incentive to balance the game badly in order to sell more. It's shortsighted to look at the game now rather than look at what the company can and will do to encourage sales.
---
very large of course, but dwarfed by those who don't want it just like it always has been. It's tough to cater to both properly. Your line about $$ I don't buy at all, paid cosmetics are always popular in PVP games. I don't get it  myself but it seems like tons of people love spending money on prettier pixels to stand out slightly.
---
Much obliged mate, this is the first online game I've played and have been loving it :)
---
It is if you like it. I use chameleon since I'm a sneaky sneak, but unyielding seems to be a good armor for slot of people, and fairly wanted for trades. I never get rid of weightless, because they weigh nothing and they can always be useful later for caps/trade.
---
Ah yes, East Virginia.  I went there on a road trip a few years ago.  I hit Old Mexico, Old York, Old Jersey, and Disconnecticut on that trip too.
---
You can get it for free if you go to the lake and in one of the container has a swimsuit
---
How did you loose? it I thought is was a pinned item once you got it you only need to do it once
---
She didn't have any teammates.
---
Where?
---
Right all others are RADiculous
---
Juicehead is (pardon my language), a f#$%ing moron. You seriously think a player, who has spent hundreds of hours accumulating massive amounts of gear, is going to join in some RNG arena naked?
---
So many fun areas they could go in along with fleshing out what we already have. I'd love to see a visit to the Pitt in future updates... 2021: The Capital Wasteland DLC would be delightful.
---
Did you finish this? I‚Äôm looking for help too
---
No worries! Glad it worked out.
---
I dont remember which one it's it's facing the lake
---
Well, please tell me what you disagree with! I‚Äôd love to know. If you do refer people, thank you!
---
No idea about others, but the vender bots only have 1400 caps per day, it actually hyper easy to fill when you go kill things, wandering around or do events(some people likes to sell purified water though, waters are op), they are more rewardfully in general, and easy to reach I must say, most of them even have some super high chance/99.998% always drop at least one legendary(which maps don't) and always giving more suppiles as well.
---
Treasure hunting will be neat if you bring a bunch of same map and dig it at once though, that's the reason I have dozens of maps on me atm, others might be even way lazier than me, which bring the cheap maps to be exists, since single map is not profitable enough, they just sell it for someone who willing to do it
---
Is there a scout quest for it? :)
---
I live in Norfolk, I'd be fine with seeing a smouldering crater  of Virginia Beach.
---
Good! This game doesnt need a pvp mode.
---
because the team medic uses any stimpack where as the diffuser will be a weaker variant
---
Had lots of fun with randoms since beta, met lots of great folks.
---
Can't wait :D
---
Cosmetic value only, wanted to wear the full outfit out of choice of style. Sucks that it has to be such a rare drop.
---
I have done this, but not in water. I wont be back on until tomorrow now but add me and we can sort it out.
---
Nahhhhhhhhh, I agree with your last point but a lv 30 is going to get minced in high lv pvp.
---
No clue how I lost it.  I was level 20ish a couple months ago and stumbled into Basic while exploring.  Now lvl 38 and ready to take on the BoS quests.  There was also a glitch where the system teamed me with another player to whom I sent  message.  He was doing the DMV at that time.
---
You can get robot plans at Grafton bots
---
So mkst builds look something like this:
---
Perks: serendipity, nerd rage, fireproof, sometimes barbarian, dodgy, plus whatever stuff that makes you impossible to kill at low health
---
Armor: any combination of 3 or all 3 per price of armor  
---
unyielding (gives you +3 to all special except endurance at low health) 
---
sentinel (75% to avoid 15% dmg I think while standing still) 
---
Assassin (75% chance to avoid 8% of damage from players)
---
Weapons: 2 shot explosive/ explosive bloodied/ anti armor explosive/ bloodied faster swing speed if melee. Sometimes a gamma gun can wreck the non power armor bloodied guys if you live long enough to get a shot on them. 
---
Bassically run anything that can stagger a lot because otherwise you'll never get a shot off. Also psychotats, berry mentats, and lots of stealthboys are an absolute must to survive. Just be conservative in how many of each you carry around because you'll die and lose them all over only a few deaths. If you see more than 1 person not killing each other. Run. Even a 2 on 1 is almost a for sure thing you'll die to
---
Lake shore drive
---
Yea but look at the cosmetics. Most that are paid with real money are items for your camp. I've read a few times on reddit where people are literally paying $$ for items for a lamp or a chair. Those same people are the ones Bethesda is going to cater too because they are bringing in the money. Especially since this game did horrible of the sales front.
---
I‚Äôve heard these speculations too, and it just doesn‚Äôt add up. There‚Äôs no way that their entire quarterly content update is dedicated to a Battle Royale mode for a game where 95% of the players avoid PvP like the plague. It would be suicide. 
---
Could Vault 51 include some PvP element? Could the vault alone be a sort of Battle Royale? Will there just be a 3rd mode added for that? Maybe,  but there‚Äôs no way the entire Nuclear Winter update is going to revolve around it. 
---
At this point, I say that PvP is hopelessly broken in 76. Humans make crappy NPCs. It‚Äôs time to end that little experiment, let tough NPC raiders move into Appalachia and put PvP to bed. I doubt they‚Äôre ready to go that far, but I don‚Äôt see any other way.
---
Way too whiny.
---
You would think that, but after 3 days and a million server hops it wasn‚Äôt there ü•∫
---
I got one finally from someone.  FINALLY.
---
Why?
---
Relax, this is just another short sighted bonehead Bethesda mistake. What they wanted to work properly Adventure broke what was in Survival. It‚Äôs not ‚ÄúThis is how it is‚Äù, it‚Äôs just another half implemented, worry about the consequences  later change. 
---
For now, and I‚Äôll bet it‚Äôll last two updates before they get it together figure out how to implement it properly, you can only damage turrets after you damage their owner first. You‚Äôll just have to steer clear of people‚Äôs bases in survival. 
---
Destroying people‚Äôs bases for no reason in survival is pretty stupid anyway.
---
Agreed, that would be extremely disappointing.
---
There‚Äôs a little green container that has one where you start the test
---
But we‚Äôve had the legendary exchange for days.. I have like 600 scrip already
---
I have marsupial
---
I have a few of the mixed drink recipes for sale in my vending machine if u see me online feel free to come by.. gamertag same as user name... thanks
---
it wouldnt bother me.. unless i was forced to play it..
---
I made a mule. Same account 2nd character. Join a friend‚Äôs server and drop the items in a container. Rejoin with second character and grab the stuff. Or just have a friend trade it over.
---
If you started during the beta, it is bugged.
---
The pvp is too broken for it to work well
---
Holy shit would it be hard to convincingly implement a flood. Perhaps inside a vault or interior you could manage it better. 
---
Fun ideas tho!
---
Bummer friend. What is the trophy that you were supposed to get?
---
It seems pretty fair that a solo player who's not geared for pvp should be getting murdered by 3 high level players. What possible balance changes could they implement to make that scenario fairer.
---
I've taken on groups in survival and usually if I win its down to me picking the engagement and using stealth. You get in a straight up fight when your opponents can dish out 3 times your dps then I don't really know what other outcome you'd be expecting.
---
It‚Äôs in being mailed to you.
---
Try again at the dmv with out a team, in my current toon I did basic training at level 10 and didn‚Äôt do the bos till I was over 50 so time shouldn‚Äôt effect but I was also in a team but ended up leaving because it was glitch out the quest.
---
These existed in BETA and were removed for some reason.
---
I'm sure your tantrum will reach Bethesda, and they will change their ways for you. Good luck destroying other peoples stuff to fill that hole buddy
---
My mutation makes the brahmin hostile everytime I get close so I gotta get in there quick and try not to milk someone else brahmin and look like a asshole for hurting there pet. Lol
---
Its called a brahmin pen.  Misleadingly named
---
I will
---
Juicehead is heavily biased against fo76. Dude is one of the biggest offenders of people capitalizing off the hate train
---
But most people will blow all that scrip day 1.
---
Gt same as name
---
the NPC quest givers are gonna be passe a week after implementation and then moaning about how the world doesn't feel alive will continue.
---
It‚Äôs apart of the bedwetters badge.
---
Can I join a server with you?
---
1 Diluted at a time , so as not to suppress the mutations
---
Quality of Life or Quality of Lazy at this point. Rather have the corpses being easier to find.
---
I played 2 hours after work a couple days ago and realized the same thing. Felt like I did a lot but realized all I had done was scrap and collect water lol
---
obviously. go play the new quests.
---
That‚Äôs what I did. I usually play with a team but our schedules just didn‚Äôt mesh up these past couple of days. I had 2 recall cards so I used one just so I could revive someone in the water there...it worked üòÅ
---
I just don‚Äôt see it. There‚Äôs no way an entire quarterly content update is dedicated to Battle Royale for a game where 95% of the players hate PvP.
---
iamnathe86, no mic.
---
I'm not on rn, but I can help you in a bit when I'm back, just a couple rules we have...
---
1) do not shoot her while she's flying (will cause her to stagger and she wont land, if her animation gets stuck we will shoot her until she clips and resets the animation, as it only takes a few explosive shots)
---
2) do not use grenades on her (they will stagger the sent and cav builds and lose their protections, which are already nerfed now so dont need extra)
---
3) dont hide in or on V9 drop site bunker (she can not land there as the fences and bunker itself dont allow it and she will keep flying, on the fence is fine, and the better place to avoid the mobs until she lands)
---
4) stay together (she will target the solo runners and land far away and cut the time melee have with her and again, sent builds lose their protections running all over the place... we dont fight in the nuke zone and avoid the rads besides what she drops)
---
Thanks for the idea.  Will try tomorrow...gotta be a dad now :)
---
It's to big. Pics just wouldn't work at all. You could swing by if you want though. No purchases required
---
Only, if the way you travel to the new "map", is via a ride on the legendary J-611 steam locomotive to and from Roanoke.
---
Good luck with that :)
---
brains
---
Bash
---
It's strange that this is the only post about this challenge. We already had this daily some time ago and it was also impossible.
---
Today i tried what i think is every way to start it: normal,dressed as either factions,server hop like 20 times. Nothing.
---
Then i tried making a new alt and went there with the help of a friend but not even a fresh character started the event.
---
go to the forest and bash everything to death
---
Try to drop the camera, read what it says. :)
---
It just works.
---
Bash your enemies with it. It doesn‚Äôt need to be fully broken btw, you just need a tiny bit of damage then repair it.
---
Melee enemies with it.
---
Oh yeah Fallout 76 is the first and only game you can dupe in. No other game has ever had that issue.
---
Need people on PS4 like this !
---
Joining ur world
---
You can spend your time in survival grinding, it's less populated and alot of the time you'll get away with farming the popular spots because people are to scared to go there. At least in my experience.
---
I would however say its way better going in as a dedicated pvp build, mines not God tier or anything but does well enough and being able to kill people via ambush or straight up fights feel great.
---
But you'll run into the crazy top tier builds and they might leave a sour taste in your mouth if you don't know why you got creamed by a invisible, invulnerable guy bunny hopping.
---
That's just not true. All online games have bugs that sit for months or year and multiple updates, updates that reintroduce bugs or fail to really fix issues with patches that are supposed to are extremely common place. It's a constant in nearly every online game ever made. Just because Fallout 76 started more broken then most other such games, doesn't make any of its issues post launch unique to it
---
I ended up selling it for 100 caps. Even repaired it to 200% and fully modded it out, I was hoping it would help some new player out. It was bought quickly, but by a level 110, probably looking to resell it for more. Kind of a shame, but what can you do
---
Can we get a map with all the technical data locations?
---
You can‚Äôt trade cameras...you can trade the broken ones though
---
When you are facing the talking box and lake turn left and you will see a cabin. On the water side of the cabin is a bin and a green footlocker on the ground. In that footlocker is a swimsuit.
---
There is also a swimsuit spawned around the corner in one of the toilets.
---
Because i hate how every game is trying to become like fortinite.
---
The fallout series is supposed to be full of RPG elements.
---
who gives a shit? other people want an additional activity. you don't have to like every new addition.
---
I would hate the fuck out of that. Thankfully, I‚Äôm not picking up those vibes at all.
---
I can handle max settings with a Ryzen 3, 8GB, and an RX 570
---
So, yes, you can
---
You just got used to Reddit's generosity of getting everything you want for free. This time the devs will not allow it and you'll have to work for it.
---
I just sell or give away stuff I don't have room for or need.
---
I would love the raider recruitment beacon. It would give a more ‚ÄúTaking over Appalachia‚Äù feel. That and my C.A.M.P. is kinda like a raider town. Or, it would if the camp budget wasn‚Äôt so low.
---
Oh yeah
---
Buy gatling plans. Make/scrap.
---
of course it isn't. the vault deathmatch stuff is just one component of a few months of updates.
---
Are camps invulnerable in survival as well?? If thats the case that's a stupid decision...
---
The RX 570 is significantly a lot better than the 1050 ti
---
Which ryzen 3?
---
Astro A10
---
You call yours a "gamma gun"?
---
I thought I was being inventive with "Mini devestator".
---
been doing that too.
---
Can you get all it's mods that way? I've scrapped about 20 and still missing one of the mods.
---
I didn't need a smart ass reply. I was asking if there's enough content to last me a while, or if I should still wait
---
Damn, I didn't realize it was that hard for some players to find him.  
---
I've had the docile ones stalk me like 5 or 6 times and I'm level 29, and once when I was level 15 or so, i had an asshole lv42 vengeful mothman appear out of nowhere and duke it out with me. Luckily I had trees to block his attacks and killed him and got pretty much nothing for it.
---
I did not start during the beta. I got the game on launch day.
---
I have Fireproof and Dense and missle turrets just tickle.  Regular turrets shred me faster than missles for sure.
---
Still get ganked by explosive weapons though.
---
Get to level 100.
---
Well, it's just one component of a season of DLC updates over a few months.
---
I can...need to accomplish also
---
Wait really? My camp is still there haha. But it‚Äôs on the lower end near the Whitespring Bunker
---
Its how I got mine. It is frustrating though towards the end.
---
And you call yourself a day one player? Laughing my ass off
---
2200G
---
I hope this happens! It made the camp look royal.
---
Just turn it into scrip.
---
If you need caps try selling the 3* items at your camp vendor and hope someone buys them. But don't make them super expensive.
---
That's rad-x. Radshields are better and don't mess with your mutations.
---
Your info is wrong. Downvotes are appropriate.
---
It's kinda why I never put my camp near the vault....
---
points to one aspect of it. there's a bunch of other additions under the NW banner.
---
im online on PC and need help doing this if anyone wants to trade deaths on PC "Kayman18"
---
Would love a vendor backpack upgrade, fed up of people always wanting my gear that's not for sale and we just sit there wasting time not knowing if Either of us is still looking through etc
---
Psn Hausmann83
---
You don't even need to play survival to get the guns, I unlocked mine in Adventure mode.
---
iam so glad i still had my double shot crossbow for this challenge ...
---
Tried to join yours and got same problem.
---
Leave a number between 1 &amp; 10 raw fertilizer in his bed
---
After seeing how much great content has been added in Wild Appalachia, finding out that the next wave of content was worthless to you wouldn't be disappointing?
---
Don‚Äôt take a workshop it‚Äôs a death sentence to you from people who can‚Äôt hang in survival mode.
---
I'd say your system is definitely capable, taking into consideration that the Xbox One (and PS4 if I recall correctly, although with some small differences) has 8 GB of RAM, an 8 Core AMD CPU, along with no dedicated GPU and is capable of running this game just fine (although there are some fps drops, but that shouldn't be a problem with your system).
---
Juicehead is a dick but the Vault event will definitely be a PVP thing. It's just a portion of Nuclear Winter tho, he's a moron for pretending that's what the whole thing is about.
---
What, are we in Canada now? Just kidding, so many times I have meat hooked someone and immediately wanted a sorry emote, I don't use a Mic.
---
I see were you're coming from, tbh I think the idea is actually cool so you can take a break from the grind and have a little fun that way, but it makes sense what you are saying. It would be nice to have some sort of new content that doesnt end, like maybe a " zombie survival" mode were you fight hords of sqourched and the like and stuff or something like that.
---
I think it definitely does work, but only really in survival mode. Adventure the way it is now is good I think, griefing is super hard and I can't really think of any ways they can ruin the experience for other people.
---
Survival is something I really enjoy and I like having a space to play it in where everyone's signed on knowing that more than likely they'll be killed. For me this is what I was hoping 76 would be from the off, the added atmosphere and risk fit the setting perfectly imo.
---
They still exist in workshops
---
Yeah, you need to finish the quest and you‚Äôre given a backpack. Then you can craft them.
---
people who want to pvp will be stoked...
---
It‚Äôs not their fault, mainly.
---
What‚Äôs happening is that the dupers are trying all of their tricks to see what works.
---
Thnx
---
‚ÄúIf you request technical support‚Äù, meaning no one will be remoting into your system unless you request technical support and allow it.
---
They're not exactly going to sneak into your computer and steal whatever boring stuff you have going on, itll have so that if you have a serious enough issuez they can screen share your computer and deal with the issue from their end. It's been done before by other companies and it just saves time and effort, it's not all that scary
---
I'm having this issue and also an issue where I cant place most items under stairs.  Really frustrating to have a blueprint since November not work.
---
Fair enough point, but from your first response I'm assuming that you don't fall under that category.
---
I recommend athlete, archer, swimmer for the parches.
---
Just put a quest marker (the diamond thing) on things killed within the last 5-10 mins that you are still within a certain distance of, if you leave the area they dissappear for good.
---
I think literally having one button to loot everything is going a bit far personally.
---
Yea theres a high chance zenimax will access and steal all your files in the middle of the night
---
Since this is a spoiler thread anyway, through various sources I'm pretty sure Wastelanders is gonna be NPCs, and E3 is right around the corner. We'll probably get a nuclear winter roadmap then.
---
I am quite a hoarder myself, these are the rules for me:
---
1. mostly play with Excavator Power Armor with 2x calibrated shocks (+100 weight)
---
2. login inside Excavator PA try to never leave for the bug (+100 weight)
---
3. Strength - Travelling Pharmacy tier 3
---
4. Strength - Bandolier tier 2
---
5. Strength - Martial Artist tier 3 (I am melee)
---
6. Intelligence - Batteries Included tier 3
---
7. Agility - Thru-hiker rank 3
---
8. (Optional) Luck - Good With Salt rank 3
---
This way I have a weight limit of circa 530 pounds. I keep all Aid in the quantity of 200, then I sell or transfer to mule, similar with ammo.
---
so don't play the new quests.
---
Add and join JRR-550 and I can help you. I did it in New Gad earlier today.
---
There is actually something in the data related to rating iirc but I'm not home till tomorrow and can't check.
---
Should add that royal jelly spawn in forest is of the junk version.
---
200 bolts and it‚Äôs not damaged? How is that even possible? Your crossbow‚Äôs condition must be over 100% right? So you mean that you just aren‚Äôt below the 100% yet? Right?
---
Any location with a kitchen, they‚Äôre usually there. Try Big Fred‚Äôs BBQ Shack or Waytoga HS.
---
Cheers. Welcome and congrats on 1st post. Since Beta
---
Eat more mothman eggs
---
still need help getting this done, would appreciate it

Bethesda actually made a grid based map. You see it in train stations. It's the same as the regular map I just overplayed that grid.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Spices](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Spices) 
---
  There you go . With locations and all.
---
Yeap, same here
---
Does that actually do anything
---
The problem is, unless you play the sheepsquatch imposter event, people rarely go down. On top of that there is a challenge to revive a downded player in water
---
Then explain the map you see at train stations that has the pins in it and a grid. It's the same map you use in your pipboy just topological and overplayed with a grid
---
For me if i put travelling pharmacy, bandolier and batteries included it lowers my damage with my melee.
---
Strange.Fall damage should always trigger that downed state.
---
Sigh...did you buy the "plans" from Atomic Shop?
---
Thanks for the tip... although it wasnt that easy.
---
Many companies have this in place to assist in repairing computer problems. My dad works in IT for my local government and does this to work on computers all the time.
---
Again, please learn to read before you comment. Thanks.
---
Fucking.. reading the replies. Dope dude. Fuck me. I had those and sold them for fucking 100 caps. Fuck me.
---
Usually after a meal. Never take on an empty stomach
---
‚ÄòEvery talented player‚Äô as in ‚Äòstanding still or hopping like a bunny to be unkillable‚Äô kind of talent yes? üëç
---
No from the vending machine at camp Adams
---
Thanks pal!
---
I feel like the whole ‚Äúspawn camping‚Äù would be at least unfair for the other party, especially at train stations if its survival. Thats the only thing that kinda doesnt stick with me. Otherwise, its a great idea.
---
Oh my thats a lot of dead brahmin. üòÇüòÇ
---
I just scraped mine when they failed.
---
I haven't heard of this but with a jetpack or marsupial you can jump up the front or the back fire escape and avoid the inside.
---
If they didn't shut down the servers the moment they discovered that a new duping method exists they are idiots.
---
Peak hours or no hold no importance in relation to the kind of problem at hand.
---
The dailies and campfire each give 25% chance to get a badge
---
Here‚Äôs a better idea, when their buying, store the floor no need to disconnect
---
it only costs 1 steel and 1 razorgrain to repair. although it might cost my soul...
---
As said before, use it to bash enemies. If there are no enemies near, just bash a wall or rock or something. Doesn't matter. It also doesn't have to   be massively broken, just damaged enough to enable a repair. Also, take off any perk cards you have which make weapons a bit more durable or give the chance to repair during combat. This helps too.
---
That‚Äôs awesome! I actually only use 1 rank adrenaline and 30% heavy gunner to make space for bear arms, ordnance express, and other perks. Still, I‚Äôm quite happy with that for now.
---
But I bet if I maximized those perks I‚Äôd see similar results as you
---
Have you tried logging in with a different character?
---
The only way to combat duper‚Äôs is to offer a low price for there items that have been duped. It‚Äôs a simple strategy...offer them next time I nothing and they will see that what they are doing is not ass lucrative as they thought it would be.
---
Ooooh, way better (worse)
---
Didn't count for me. Though who knows why, so many challenges aren't counting for me in general
---
Joining now
---
U also get 1 razorgrain and steel for scraping so cost nothing to put back down. But least u got ur aggression out of the brahmin. üòÇüòÇ
---
I'd be happy even without an on-demand hoykey. Something like a poker table you can place in your camp that lets you swap decks would be great. IT could doublke as storage so you can offload all the cards you've been getting from perk packs that you dont want to keep on you at all times but also don't want to get rid of.
---
Lol not at all. I personally sit by my vending machine and play the banjo while I wait for customers. I make sure to get up and throw a heart of they purchase from me. When Im visiting other vendors I will give them a thumbs down if their prices are too high, and thumbs up if they are reasonable. Ill give a heart if they have something I really wanted for cheap. Its a buyers market. You gotta let them know when they arent priced well.
---
That's what I thought. I mean, six months is more than enough time to give Bethesda a chance. It's time to let the modding community shine.
---
I've been waiting patiently to be able to come back to this game when it's worth doing so. Player shops almost drew me in, then I realized it's a ruined concept if item duping still exists.
---
But hey, Fo76 zealots gonna zealot.
---
I play since October when they first started BETA. Never really got bored of the game. Enjoyed the game on my own mostly but had some good times with friends also. This update is the best they had so far and i can see myself playing for a lot longer with the upcoming Nuclear Winter.
---
I found one today, in a container at camp Adams (the campfire daily)
---
You can buy them, Todd will appreciate it.
---
It's cool
---
I dont have either. I'll try and get up there now with out them. I'm concerned that there are other dungeons that I'm not able to get into. I'm also not to pleased that I wasted my day reinstalling this game.
---
It works if the player is nearby
---
The ability to buy them is also part of why it's so concerning how hard to get atoms are in recent times  
---
(They're also insanely expensive)
---
Fast travel mats already exist for workshops
---
What the Hell does ‚ÄúReddit‚Äôs generosity of getting everything you want for free‚Äù have to do with any of this?  Check my history, I‚Äôve never even used the trading subreddits, nor have I ever gotten anything in Fallout 76 from Reddit or by way of interacting with another redditor.  This is presumptuous and a red herring.
---
Then you're good. You will get your backpack when you're done with the quest.
---
I started a few months ago when they upped stash size. I have 330 hours on the ps4 and similar on xbox, I am not near tired of it yet.
---
Saaame hmu tonight on ps4 kakarott9k
---
I get the feeling most of the people sending this bitchy messages are just pissed someone is selling an item for much lower. Which is possibly why he never put his store up.
---
Why buy from the idiots selling magazines for 400 when someone has them for cheaper. They are just pissed cause other people are costing them caps in their mind.
---
#ghoulhole #ghoullife
---
also at whitesping, beside the kitchen stoves
---
Doubtful. 50 to 100 players, with their camps, and  cached items would be alot for the server to handle.
---
Ultracite, beautiful. Have that myself. Calibrated shocks and motion assist made it worthy again!
---
Team Deathmatch is coming. It‚Äôs really disappointing when people on this sub are constantly acting like the people that want to PvP in this game are villains
---
Noted. My bunny hop game is strong üí™ I‚Äôm a PC player. But... why are these people possibly invulnerable?
---
556
---
Under the influence of alcohol
---
There is a large pool of PvP players. Not everyone is like you
---
Yeah, well done. Too bad they didn't think of a better trading system where you can simply trade items and not only caps for items.
---
My friend has this, it‚Äôs gross. You should lock your doors.
---
Throw me a friend request ill help IGN: Haippari
---
You likely gonna Scrap 100....
---
(Try to find a friend who already has it... I have threoy it might increase your chances.)
---
Athlete archer and hunting for me. Didn't have a camera so couldn't do swimmer
---
Nah. The only problems with the loot tables for legendaries are that drill and syringer are both in the pool and can't be legendary and wood armor can only be a 1 star
---
Will literally reference this reply on my other monitor when I login later. Thanks!!!
---
It's fake ! Banned for racism.

Nuka cola cherry are your friend! I favorited them and popped it when I was running low on AP so I could keep on sprinting, but with marsupial and speed demon it was breezy. I have a guide on my YT if it helps https://youtu.be/aSu11QHL8ZE
---
Or that only 5% of players can enjoy pvp.
---
I was so hesitant to get this game after the negative reviews, but decided to form my own opinion on day 2 and bought it. Now here I am, 810hrs in, completely obsessed. Obsessed enough to where I did not get into the games I was actually looking forward to for a long time, Sekiro and RDR2 online. And I don‚Äôt see myself quitting anytime soon.
---
Try at Jane's.
---
Whitespring, Service entrance, where the robot sweeps near the trashcans fulled with sceletons
---
Well don‚Äôt try to do medic, it‚Äôs basically impossible right now unless you have a time machine
---
Shoot.  That‚Äôs the easy answer.  I wonder if it can pop at any level or if it misses is that it.
---
Dude thats what a BR mode unless it will be different for F76...i would do it in a hearbeat
---
PvP is a lot of fun! It‚Äôs frustrating sometimes, but that‚Äôs only because it‚Äôs so personal. It‚Äôs not like other games, it‚Äôs dynamic. Something (mostly) new every time. 
---
I like it because I feel like it‚Äôs ‚Äúmy‚Äù character up against someone else‚Äôs. 
---
People should just give it a try, but don‚Äôt use your power armor
---
Same. Wont check off at locations nor playing a type of instrument.
---
Thanks I try to stay grounded and not just taunt people whose gear may have been brought back to reality. 
---
In any game nerfs and buffs happen, you just gotta adapt and take advantage of the things within your control to try and maximize efficiency. 
---
I was a long time CoD player so I‚Äôm used to seeing my favorite weapons go up and down. But if I like them enough I tried to always find a way to make them worthwhile. Same applies here. This game offers a lot of freedom to get creative. For the most part any weapon can be made effective with the right approach.
---
Me too, with only two exceptions over several months playtime
---
I'm not sure about a place with a ton of spices, but pretty much any kitchen or restaurant area should have some you can grab. I make it a habit to collect any Salt, Pepper, Sugar, and Spice I come across. It's all lightweight so it doesn't make a huge dent in the Stash.
---
The only similar situation I had was on xbox and one day it just wouldn't let me back into charlie silo, I crashed 6 times trying to get in and 2 times trying to get away from it. After that I was mostly fine though.
---
Try harder, my base has hidden entrances.
---
Lol yes not bragging, but yes I do. Built it a few years ago but it's a beast still. I can't live without multitasking.
---
Went for Hours/Days for me.  Then the first time I tried the teapot.  Bingo
---
25k made some sense before player vending, since opening trade with players that have what you want was so difficult before. Now that there are at tons of player vendors selling legendaries I wouldnt pay anymore than 5k for an item.
---
Counter idea, looting a death bag gives a bounty.
---
Shotgun shells by far, never enough plastic
---
If you have floors attached to the stairs it will prevent deletion as 2nd floor would become inaccessible. You'd need to first remove those floors or add a 2nd staircase for access.
---
These degenerates are suffering from a disease with only one cure, a bullet.
---
God bless America, and God bless the Enclave.
---
I agree these too
---
I broke a crossbow by bashing just 1 lvl15 super mutant get close as possible so it can't shoot you
---
Good to know! Thanks
---
Indeed
---
[](/celbrows)While suffering from whoopsies.
---
I think it would work with current player counts, obviously more is better though. All the factions have hubs already, top of the world is great what with the trading and workshop rotunda. Morgantown Airport looks awesome and I'd probably use camp venture for BOS. Enclave have thier bunker and so do free states. 
---
I'd like to see areas added to these that you have to have faction alignment with to enter and trade in. You could earn faction points by killing rival faction members or by doing pve faction themed missions similar to events and scout badges.
---
Talk about being obtuse and missing the point
---
I agree. I think NPCs are inevitable. I actually think Wastelanders is going to be a sort of relaunch of the game. Bugs stomped, new main quest, NPCs added...‚ÄùAll the things you love about Fallout‚Äù. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a Nuclear Winter roadmap ahead of E3 with that stage focusing on Wastelanders. That‚Äôs the thing they need to sell.
---
The athlete one was the only easy one üò¢
---
I've gotten vote-bombed so many times for pointing out that stealing junk from a loot bag IS a PVP act, even though it's not treated as such by code.
---
The first Old Man Winter Mask wasn't duped, it was obtained in the dev room, which is still accesible.
---
You aren‚Äôt meant to get unlimited free Atoms.
---
I did add two more stairs to the floor above the stair and now I can‚Äôt delete any of them.
---
Also do you know how I can post a video on the subreddit?
---
Wow, 810 hrs. I didn't read any reviews for the game or anything until I got the game in December, went in completely blind. And, when the bugs started to show themselves one after the other, I almost completely quit and actually stopped playing for a week. But I've been fairly active since then, playing around 3-4 hrs a day, almost daily.
---
Post patch it's less of an issue but like the other guy said, combination of damage avoidence perks, % damage reduction armour pieces like sentinals and assassins means players turn insanely tanky. Plus speccing into this build does nothing to hamper dps so they'll still drop you in seconds if thier gear game is optimal.
---
There are some issues. There's a bunch of safes south east of Tyler fairgrounds that are not on your map meaning it's not totally accurate.
---
\*slow clap, rising to a standing ovation\*
---
Love it! Well done!
---
Guess i know who's camp I'm definitely never visiting!
---
So many bugged challenges I had to buy cause I cant earn enough to get anything limited in the store anymore.
---
This right here.  Took mine down after the 1st day because I was tired of returning home to find it damaged with super mutants or wolves attacking it.
---
I like survival but half of why I like it is that I get to choose to go into it or not. Usually I say no but sometimes I want an opportunity for a fight even if what I get is a bunch of cooperation followed by being mowed down by an unseen sniper.
---
Not a problem man. A lot of those notes are straight trial and error from my time playing and getting wrecked over and over haha
---
Wasn't Bysshe.co mentioned in Point Lookout ?
---
At night
---
Oops OP better hide your ahegao lolicon hentai
---
I have a set of stairs that is stuck at my camp too that I was using to get somewhere (3 to be exact) and now I just a stupid set of stairs in my front lawn lol
---
50 to 100 with no camps tho... I mean if its gonna be a separate mode, could up the player count but not have camps load in.
---
Don't get why. A bounty would give a fighting chance to get your junk back. Imagine coding would be a bit trickier to implement so pvp bags and dropped items didnt bounty though.
---
I was able to jump into the chain link fence in the back and climb up to finish. Thanks for the assist. Side note you dont take any damage from barbed wire on the top of fences.
---
I'd never do this. Definitely worth staying cautious though.
---
And what will we do when player deployed mats are abused? Say the location is in a locked room full of glowing ghouls? At this point your best mediation is to block the player so you won't encounter them again. If BGS could instead fix the fast travel spawn point to something safe wouldn't that make more sense? Right now the point appears to be the position of the owner's first CAMP tool deployment. Naturally, those often get covered which introduces the current difficulty.
---
Seriously? This is standard boilerplate for any company that offers tech support where remote access might be used. It‚Äôs plain English, there‚Äôs nothing vague or nefarious about it.
---
I've been pretty much the same way, started playing on my own until I actually got a mic for the Xbox, then started to actually play with some other people and joined a faction, and it's been a lot of fun, although I still play fairly solo.
---
Good thing that's not what I asked for :)
---
sorry, i was bouncing around a couple different posts and that was meant for a different one. my bad : (
---
Since beta.  610 hours on Xbox.  Not sure how many hours on pc, but way less than that.
---
Some nights I've gotten bored with it, but when I try another new game it's just not the same.  I'm addicted.
---
I played the minute the first timed xbox beta started. Still play to this day, logged almost 300 hours.
---
Jane's?
---
I'm excited for this concept of the &gt;!nuclear football/briefcase!&lt;. This battle royale actually sounds fun. Sure the mode is overdone, but if done right and with different ideas, it can still be fun
---
That's not exploiting just cheating
---
I‚Äôm glad you questioned this. I accidentally 200% repaired mine and it‚Äôs only 3/4‚Äôs broken the extra bar after killing 50+ enemies.
---
On Xbox? I have a couple thousand I could give you
---
Hey yeah, that's my last one I need, you on?
---
Same way here, I've tried to play other games, but I almost always come crawling back to this game, even when I tried to play Fallout 4.
---
That'd be cool. I am on now with the same psn name on here.
---
Slightly problematic when you only play single player games and don't even own a mic. So I skipped that part to work on the rest first. Midway through the second of the three badges Encryptid popped up and I got it there.
---
Yeah Gt: HerbalxAssassin
---
Why not both?? It will likely have good content for you like Wild Appalachia, AND PVP content.
---
I have a max level two  shot  + 50% limb damage on PC. Msg me if your interested
---
I‚Äôm starting to think I‚Äôm just a soft lad after reading the replies.
---
Well, from what I've heard from other games about Chinese people, they're not *all* cheaters and hackers, but alot of them are, so I think the implication is that he had duped items that were deleted.
---
Yes this. My handmade chews through 5.56 like crazy. Wouldn‚Äôt mind having a few thousand rounds to play with.
---
Very much obliged for the help
---
I agree. It certainly does suck when it happens. Very anti-social behaviour given you're all meant to come from the same vault but it's fair within the rules of the game.
---
Are get some weird guy saying moo to follow you around and carry your gear.
---
I keep unyielding and bloodied and turn most other stuff into scrip, caps or leave it on the body. I consider two shots and I pick up anything past 1 star but I check their stats and scrip most of them anyways.
---
That‚Äôs racist dude
---
Cool I'll come to you, where are you located?
---
On Xbox
---
The only place is at the enclave vendor.
---
Was trying to get you the swimming challenge revival thing aswell but think you could hear me :) was trying to talk to you. But you got the other one :)
---
He spawns in various locations. I found him at the water park parking lot in the north of the map. I had to server hop 3 or 4 times before he appeared but it‚Äôs a lot better than traveling around to try and find him.
---
That could be interesting. Like each faction has their own base and shared stash for crafting.
---
Yes you are 
---
You just think your being clever about it
---
Was it the big red chest in the small building next to bear statue??
---
I found one in a nuke silo
---
I'll be on in around 3 hours, but I'll look you up when I get on if I have one. I know I had one in my vending machine and I don't think it sold yet.
---
This was intentional. They cleaned up the sbq loot pool to make preparations for the improved repair kits. The only place to get these now is the enclave vendor.
---
Never mind. Found location but no luck.
---
Even if part of it is a PvP mode, I can see how it would serve the story of Vault 51. 
---
We're playing as the 51 dwellers fighting to become overseer. Makes sense to me. 
---
But, as others have said, this is probably just one part of the DLC.
---
All of my others went just fine, but that one did not work.
---
I think it'll be focused on nuclear winter, a full trailer and roadmap like what we've seen with Wild Appalachia. After that, a wastelanders teaser.
---
I don't know... sounds like a trap to me lol  
---
But seriously though, just make sure you wear power armor in your shopping travels and you'll be fine.
---
Oof. Sounds a lot like the time I spent in Division 1‚Äôs DZ.
---
Which is great, I‚Äôm very glad.  I still just feel that we should be able to do what we want with these items.
---
Been looking for Neon letters, can‚Äôt even find it in normal vendors
---
Game crashed, Omw back
---
PC sadly
---
In the wise words of jo jo. YES YES YES YES
---
It's a 10% base chance per hit which is increased to 15% with radaway and decreased with perks/well fed
---
Are non PA users not using acrobat or a combo of acrobat and goats legs?
---
Jeeze, even buying the mod alone is like 300-400 caps.  I don't think there's a problem your pricing.
---
With a player in Nukashine Excavator armour wielding a TSE Gatling Plasma (while fighting said SBQ) and is level 431.
---
Not how the fast travel waypoint is set. And the potential abuse is a small price for not spawning in water everytime I port to my own camp
---
Not even inside? I found two there.
---
The duping is actually caused by the vending machines, I've done it before (I MUST STRESS THAT IT WAS ACCIDENTAL).
---
Just thought about this and I think this is the way to do it. So actually I will still get this high capacity mod when I'm overloaded and hope no enemies with energy weapons shoots me
---
You just gotta scrap scrap scrap. It‚Äôs just random. Took me awhile but I got mine that way
---
Wow thats really smart. I run a medical supply. I always have 100 stimpacks in stock for 15 caps each. 50 disease cure for 5 each. Will be adding Radaway to stock for 5 caps a piece soon. As well as tens of thousands of bullets and grenades at 1 cap each. All ammo types. 
---

Weren't radbears, but lil ginger snuggles. I am tempted buy one from someone.

Right after the queen dies
---
I've had three sets of official XB Stereo headset and each one the arms cracked and the foam started to come away from the earphones. I've learnt my lesson and won't be replacing like for like again.
---
TLDR: Anything but the official headset will do you fine :)
---
Just bought 1000 rounds at 1 cap a piece.
---
The problem is not your pc the problem is the game
---
I just got the Opossum list of challenges last night ...
---
That's huge... but will take me forever...I have enough of a hard time getting weeklies and dailies done, but by gosh that's a long list that is excruciatingly hard to keep track of... needs better UI for tracking...
---
Keep scrapping them level actions rifles, thats the way to get it.
---
Yeah that's the usual price
---
I hav a set of T51 with jet pack in camo, cant seem to put it in the vending  machine
---
In the Forest near the airport over to Charleston I had some luck finding them. Between the airport and the military base. Make sure you are very very quiet.
---
Hey thanks for the tip
---
I don't think you can just attach your own meaning to my message to dispute it, I asked for a simpler way of getting atom since after you complete the initial challenges the intake of atom is insanely low along with the challenges that are only getting harder and harder
---
It's more like 25% chance but still better than doing the highly ridiculous challenges
---
Thanks....will do
---
Go to Grafton Station, buy the recipe for 1700 I think, the make over 40 Rifles and Scrap them
---
There are 3 brahmin between the gym and church (north of the church). 4 brahmin south of the church around the multifruit plants and the dead brahmin. 1-2 a cross the street from the church behind the bar.
---
I run bird bones, healing factor, and marsupial. This would do nothing but give me a minor spoop, as well as getting the player that tried it put on my alliances kill list. Never looked into acrobat gear, guess it wouldn't hurt to have at least one.
---
Yo you're actually right, been a long time since I've played the DLC so had to double check the wiki but that's actually a sick lil bit of world building.
---
Good catch man.
---
You can‚Äôt trade them...
---
Took me 17 scraps to get it. Luckily the hardened recover was scrap #1 for me, so now I'm sitting pretty. Toss your gamertag/platform I'm sure someone will make one for you for mats.
---
I had some weirdness on a server last night (PS4) - there were 4 scorchbeasts that attacked Whitesprings within an hour. Then there was a weird glitch where I was getting attacked, by nothing, when all of a sudden dozens of ghouls come sliding across the ground towards me still in their resting poses.  
---
Also was getting multiple legendaries off non-legendary mobs, so no complaints here!
---
My character has 2 strength due to mutations and I just used whiskey and buffout, it counted for me.
---
Just like you can‚Äôt tell me what I think you‚Äôre really saying. 
---
They need to fix broken challenges yes. But asking for more challenges or easier ways to get more Atoms is literally asking for Free Atoms. 
---
Nothing more.
---
I couldn't bring myself to do it that way. My single foundation base had a stairway on each side of the foundation with the second floor centered over the foundation.
---
They spawn in a lot of world containers. Can also be gotten from behemoths and gulpers as well as in deathclaw nests
---
How did you made that shot?
---
Whaddya mean, registered?
---
sell anything for whatever you‚Äôd like. sucks to be them.
---
You only need the torso equipped for the mining bonus
---
Rating for vendors sure. Rating on C.A.M.P.s doesnt seem neccessary. Im constantly getting thumbs ups and messages from visitors when they check out my camp. Thats enough validation for me. 
---
A rating for vendor prices would be nice a simple
---
Low, fair, and too expensive.
---
Ansel Adams. Annie Leibowitz.
---
Are you telling or asking? You started off asking a question about nerfing, but you didn't agree with any of the answers given. Very strange. If you have your own answers why ask questions?
---
I've done a handful of things that should pop chieves, and haven't gotten them. Game is buggy, buff said sadly.
---
They didn't before but they do now since items now have unique identifiers
---
Asking for Free Atoms and asking for a more convenient system of earning atoms is not the same thing, it's pretty dishonest to pretend like it is
---
Very nice find. I wouldnt be supriced if someone paid 25k+ for that in caps.
---
I always leave my door open an my purifiers unlocked :]
---
Nah it‚Äôs terrible, why don‚Äôt I just take that junk off ya, it would just be a waste to keep it.....
---
(Jk sounds like a god roll, keep it,  wield it like Excalibar)
---
You can earn 500-600 atoms a week. 
---
You‚Äôre just greedy and don‚Äôt want admit it

I rarely even use my T-60 PA and I would have bought the set without a second thought.
---
If you have gotten almost all the free atoms then you have gotten well over your money‚Äôs worth for the game and should spend money on atoms to show your appreciation

Check by my camp usually have a couple roaming around.

You need to run the scam and fix from the Bethesda launcher

This is a sad excuse for one of the buggiest games I have ever played.
---
If FO76 were an indie game, we could give them a break. But it is made by one of the largest game studios in the world with more than a decade of game building experience.
---
I've gone solo for most of my main playthrough and I'm fine. Never broken that trend aside from helping some guy join the Enclave back in beta when that wasn't exactly public information.
---
Im looking too, think so far the only spot might be server hopping the plan spawn at harpers ferry
---
I have plans for sale at my camp on Xbox
---
Ok thank you!
---
Wow really I have been wondering on the cap price in fallout 76 since the vendor update I have seen some ledgendarys with 1 effect bring sold for 1000 caps.
---
The atom shop only sells skins, youll still need the plan for the item itself in the game
---
I search for the tourists at Wavy Willard's for a few days and server hopped so many times and had no luck. Went to the Giant Teapot near Charleston Station and found it after the first server hop. 
---
If you do the Tea Time mission at the end, there is a wolf you can kill and then take their picture that counts for the Mammalogist Badge.
---
Guaranteed spawn is the hill on top of the enclave bunker entrance.  2-3 of them   Main entrance not the service entrance
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox. If you‚Äôre on now hit me with your GT and I‚Äôll come buy them
---
I didnt know that. Can they be dropped?
---
Reactive plates basically does it for you. The Plague walker mutation basically does the same thing as well, since it's so easy to get a disease.
---
Wow thanks man loved the joke guess I will be making a get off my lawn build.
---
Copy that man. I didnt k ow they couldn't be traded. I will try dropping.
---
So? It can still be more fun to use console commands to get a few materials to finish a project, or use the terrain to exploit bad ai than it is slog through a grind of playing "correctly".
---
Depending on the item, you might need to unlock the "base" plan as well. I bought the red stove and realized I didn't know the stove plan, took like three days to find it.
---
Thanks man
---
Just hold onto it, may suck right now because of nerf, but they could change it again since it makes them terrible
---
Spiral around like the snake in The Jungle Book in Nukashine blue.
---
What do you mean by Silent CTD?
---
The owner's fast travel point is different from visitors. I can change my arrival point by moving the tool box around. Doing so doesn't appear to change where visitors land at my CAMP. While it would be nice to have the ability to set my arrival point at my CAMP, like we could do in FO4 and at workshops in FO76, you know others are going to abuse this for visitors going forward. I'm only suggesting that BGS needs to develop a solution to the problem that mitigates the obvious temptation to abuse it.
---
I got 3/4 from Helvetia
---
If you do this the queen can glitch out from a targeting bug. Either she can get stuck in the air never coming down or she will fly off the map.
---
They improved things a bit on selecting in build mode. The thing that I found doesn't work anymore is running wire through doors and windows. It works if you already have it done, but you can't redo it again. I found out the hard way when changing a few things to my setup. I had to go with a half wall which makes camp look awful.
---
Where‚Äôs the spawn point? I might try hopping it.
---
The Place of The Winding Path has a crossbow that you can repair. If you fast travel there go through the arch and turn left keep walking until you get to the ledge. You should see a table with a crossbow on it. If not server hop until you get it, but there should be the plans for the crossbow where you take the archery shooting test and you can craft a lvl 15 with low dmg resistance and should be able to repair it a couple of times after using it a couple of times.
---
Well, a normal Crash to Desktop generally has some kind of error or something, a Windows Encountered an Issue etc, etc.
---
Silent CTD is when the game just closes. No bug report, no warning, no errors, just closes. Randomly, it's not something that happens every time I am lockpicking or reading, but only happens when I am.
---
Wow I scrapped about 8 and got all the mods.. try taking something that boosts intelligence?
---
Seriously hold on to it carefully... (I lost my god roll to a glitch in the game and no other gun felt the same.)
---
I‚Äôve got an instigating crossbow
---
I need them as well on PS4. Offering 2k for them because I‚Äôm burnt out going to harpers.
---
You still on? I need to revive too and am looking for someone to help out
---
Heck ya! I‚Äôll check it out, thanks
---
Yeah I mean they were over powered before but that was only in PvP and when they were stacked with 100000 explosive bubble heads. I think they get nerfed to hard but that's just me. Plus this is my first explosive weapon so I am very happy it's a good one.
---
Ah, that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt know what it was. I‚Äôm on xbox, sorry. Hope someone can help though. That sucks
---
Sunnytop Station seems to have tons of armour plans currently (don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just the server I‚Äôm on though)
---
This is actually correct. It's the same thing that causes her to get stuck flying in the air firing at one person. If that person dies she will get an update with bad coordinates for her aggro target and can fly in any direction. Once saw her fly all the way across the map and over flatwoods
---
500-600 atoms from logging in every day of the week, doing 5 challenges daily that are usually very challenging and quite a lot wont even function along with 6 weekly dailies will earn me a pink pip boy, there is a huge difference in effort and rewards here
---
Looking at one right now
---
Months ago I saw a guy running around 1-shotting shit with a TSE handmade. I asked him if he duped and he said nah man, I just bought it for $5 on Ebay.
---
If u talking about metal armor 
---
Go to white spring and check every vendor, I‚Äôm not sure who, but I‚Äôve got all plans from them 2 days ago
---
How did the glitch happen?
---
I do the same thing. But I'll buy plans or weapons for people that I usually play with that don't have those things. Or if they have cheap legendaries I go and trade them in for scrip.
---
There's like 10+ threads a day asking for help. If you refuse to help them, then why would you expect anyone to help you? It's not a single player game, sometimes you're just going to have to do things with other people.
---
People pay real money for cosmetics. It's not surprising that they would pay real money for items that actually improve your performance in game.
---
Yeah, y'all get errors typically lol.
---
It really does suck though, had 7 workshops under my control, was picking a lock and the damn thing just crashed.
---
So many junk extractors... Gone...

Thanks guys my gamertag is Facepuncher85 and I am on xbox1.. I have the plan to make lever actions I will continue to scrap them.. thanks again, 
---
Ps...this is the best community of people I have ever had the privelidge of dealing with any problem any question I have fallout related or otherwise has been met with nothing but the most helpful people I have ever seen.. I appreciate everything the reddit community does
---
I think you would have to put the pieces in one at a time and it's going to take a lot of stash space. Also you need to remove the atom shop paint before trading.
---
Sorry to hear it. Xbox doesn‚Äôt get errors, it just closes, exactly like pc. I understand your pain.
---
What system are you on? I'm on Xbox: xMagicPrincess, feel free to add me. The question is, what do you want to do? The world is your oyster here. Personally, I like to take it slow, smell the Ash roses, and take joy in the little things. I try to avoid fast traveling (within reason) and just go with the flow, following whatever piques my character's interest. What class are you going for? What's your favorite thing to do so far?
---
I could swear I saw some in the top of the world train station.
---
I have the legendary Ghoul Slayer‚Äôs Gamma Gun with limb damage and agility:)
---
If you're not running bloodied, I like vanguard.
---
Really? I know that sometimes the PS4 gets error codes, figured it was the same for Xbox.
---
Sometimes we do, sometimes it just goes back to home.
---
I've said it before myself and agree 100%.
---
We need more raider goodness. There should be higher tiers of raider armour while we're at it.
---
I have a bunch of one stars on my mule.
---
No sorry, not that good. All those effects are kinda meh :( Entry level weapon
---
I shouldn't have to, that's the problem, especially considering the amount of time I spend playing this game
---
I never leave my suit of t-51b power armor :)
---
When you build the Excavator for Miner Miracles, the last step is registering it. You hit a button in the room next to the power armor stations in Garrahan Headquarters and a blue light scans you in the armor, then the quest completes.
---
Yeah, still looks good in photo mode.
---
Speaking of, buddy of mine has an Xbox S and wants to try the game out, his PC is garbage, how does the game perform on Xbox? Any glaring issues you come across?
---
Same here. Wave 2 crickets stuck inside rock wall.
---
There‚Äôs the truth. You think you deserve free stuff because you‚Äôre an entitled gamer.
---
Your own words tell the truth about you.
---
And naked. That one turned out pretty funny. Re-enacted something ridiculous an ex did while drunk.

---
Trying to place anything on the ground seems to be awkward now. It has to be related to the changes in floor placement. I have a few blueprints that won't place anymore after the latest patch.
---
Mine too, thought I might have dropped them somewhere but they were definitely in my stash and now are not. Wonder why?
---
Same server lag, but I very rarely crash on Fallout. It performs surprisingly well on xbox, the only issues are the servers, which is universal.
---
thank you lots

Yeah I understand what you mean

Sending request gt vegitastorm

About 430 hours, played since the first minute of beta, most of it is from the first month since release, about 12 hours in the last few months.
---
Also, now that I think about it, Xbox does have a fair amount of pop-in when standing high up. Does PC have this or is it just us?
---
I'm looking for the plans for shadowed leather armor legs for one of my characters so I check a lot of camps with plans. If they have any other plans I don't know yet I usually buy at least one of them if the price is reasonable.
---
Argh, never mind someone bought them but I still have the deep pocketed plan for limbs and chest
---
They don't spawn in the world but are random container items - so they can't be mapped
---
Freds bbq shack has foxes for archeologist badge.
---
Yeah, servers need work.  
---
Other than this occasional crash, it's been performing really well for me, too.

I'll let him know it's not bad on Xbox. Thanks.

Hearthstone removed sorry emote because of toxicity. I don't think we need such frustrating things in the game

I am bloody but may have to change my build up. My build has been lacking after new patch
---
Oof.
---
I use 2 pieces eliminates all fall damage from anywhere. Its rarely the main perk so you dont scarifice anything. Unless you are hardcore about every perk on your armor.
---
Depends on the settings you have it set to, and the general power of your PC. I don't personally notice it on mine.  
---
You on an X, S or original?
---
Bayonet modifications sync with perk Incisor? Martial Artist? Gladiator/Slugger? 
---
More explanations for perks/weapon benefits/ modification calculator, actual numbers, percents...? To compare whether or not this modification is any benefit.. I‚Äôm still confused/raging about why the hell certain stocks,barrels, or modifications make a weapon ‚Äúbetter‚Äù ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù, but have absolutely nothing to do with the weapon outside of V.A.T.S. Combat... I hate vats.. but there are players that cannot live without it and therefore why am I making this missile launcher or fat man into a ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù V.A.T.S, hip-fire, and accurate ‚Äúone-click to nuke this $h!¬£  video camera‚Äù!? A fat man and missile  launcher are amazing to aim, fire, and watch as enemies turn to steak  in a firework show. 
---
If players choose not to use Vats then why can‚Äôt critical hits apply also to players manually scoping,hitting, aiming?? 
---
Range for weapons seems to be broken if I‚Äôm standing far enough,but still scoping a target there seems to be no chance of hitting that target regardless even if it were a straight shot... this scope isn‚Äôt a huge amount of yards/miles... it‚Äôs literally working more as a binocular instead of as a tool to shoot the face off some ugly mole rats. 
---
Knife, Bayonet, Ammo, etc. crafting to include certain solutions/compounds/ bait items/ tracking applications to apply to certain weapons for a limited time effect. For Example:  Lets apply a vial of Deathclaw Blood to a combat knife or the bullets of a Gatling Gun... The blood will attract the predator that normally feasts on Deathclaw...  If Deathclaw happen to feed upon Deathclaw then there is also chances of having legendary/furious as hell Deathclaw. The crafted item I refer to here can be a poison/radiation on impact bullets/perk canceling solution/damage/critical/A.P./tracking of Deathclaw,Sloth, Alien, Wendigo. 
---
Ideas to include a modification to weapons that workers like a  tracker. A little radar/sonar device..? Npc/player display device for weapons on the side of it like in the Blizzard Mission in Mw2? 
---
Dual Wield melee? Dual Pistols? 
---
Vertibird/Sloth/ Deathclaw/scorchbeast travel/mount for certain locations/paying a vendor to have you ferried somewhere on map... battlegrounds for pvp with vertibird machine gun/middle launchers? Domesticated Deathclaw that can be modified within a C.A.M.P. Or for obtaining a workshop exclusive to the mount? 
---
If vehicles/creatures can be modified with weapons/armor then perhaps we can have them also be able to include several players operating/traveling with/ assisting?
---
Arenas with exclusive weapons/armor/etc. Maybe in different Locations of the United States... return to D.C., Chicago, Mothership Zeta homeworld...
---
More options for how you want to customize your weapon with details like in the skins to also include the scopes... for some reason the recon scopes don‚Äôt get painted with the weapon... the reticle of the scopes are garbage and it‚Äôd be fantastic if there could be more options to customize them for all scopes.
---
I could swear it worked for me? But I have heard of that issue so maybe
---
Downvoted. I am not a HUGE pvp fan but I for the most part don't mind the pvp and haven't since I started.
---
Will I get frustrated in this hypothetical mode? Almost definitely. Will I be *more* frustrated than when I dced 10 second before the scorch beast queen died or when my xbox blue screened 8 times trying to get into and away from charlie silo? Maybe, but I still don't think my primary complaint will be pvp in the worst day for pvp, usually it's server stability or the ability to res where I am at in adventure mode. I can't tell you how happy I would be if I stopped having to respawn at vault 76 and fast travel to where my junk is when I don't happen to have a friend nearby.
---
Are they wall safes? Wondering if I only got free standing ones
---
You got a mic that works
---
Correction - I HAVE had some pop-in, but generally it's coinciding with a bad lag spike or impending disconnect.
---
Have you seen the daily challenges since the camera dropped? People are having to make reddit threads just to get like 20 Atoms.
---
I'm not enjoy playing solo at the moment.
---
I do
---
I wouldnt say its completely useless. its a nice small addition to the game and some players might find it really helpful. Those especially who don't use trading reddit or discord. Me personally on the other hand don't find it useful. Haven't travelled to any camp to see vendors after day 1 the thing came out. Waste of time for me.
---
Yeah im sure. The noticable things are not by accident. The sudden flood of AAE , or Bloddied Exp Handmades, or explosive lazers.....and some people who ive seen with litteraly thousands of each type of flux and bobble heads etc. for sale. It messes up the servers. But i cant really decided if its bad for the game economy or not. Everyone buys that stuff for PvP....eventually theyll all have it , and then whats the point
---
Goodie
---
I've got a Turtle Beach that I've had for years and works great. Forget the model, but it was reasonably priced and it's really lightweight. You forget you have it on after about ten seconds.
---
Nope. They are free standing ones. It's what I call the safe graveyard. 13 safes in a very small area. Also there are wall safes, floor safes, prewar safes, etc. There are a lot of different kinds of safes in the game. And your xedit also probably isn't updated for the latest patch. Message me on discord as I help keep it updated on a seperate branch. Eckserah#0001
---
Weight has made people cautious at best about each new item. The vendors are working fine. If no one's buying, go find quest item junk or highly used/sought after stuff and sell that.
---
Holy christ, I have not gotten that! Guess I gotta grind!
---
Considering that I saw someone asking 4000 caps for a basic 1 star legendary weapon I would say 500 for calibrated shocks is pretty damn reasonable.
---
Vending backpack? People can click on it and will act as a vending machine connected to your stash.
---
I used to play a lot of wow and it‚Äôs a similar thing. I‚Äôd get some gems or ore or something just by chance, sell them for lower than the current prices so they will definitely sell and I wouldn‚Äôt have to re-list them (there‚Äôs a whole auction house system and you can see all the prices). Then people will send angry messages because you undercut them.
---
Id take those shells if I wasn't stuck at this wedding
---
Yeah we have it on the ground when standing on something like the top of a mountain- the ground textures get really bright, and the plants+grass disappear, but it pops in when you go closer to the ground.
---
Yeah
---
Gotta take off the Atom Shop paint before selling, my dude!
---
My crap is selling reasonably well. Mix of plans, maps, legendaries, aid, mods.
---
My plans I have priced fairly low - people will buy what they don‚Äôt have.  Most mods I have priced very cheap, except the ones that are really wanted (various calibrated shocks, etc.) - and even at higher prices, those sell.
---
You got discord?
---
I‚Äôm suggesting servers that include players not so far off in level from your own. Sometimes alright it‚Äôs fun to pick on the low level noob shooting his pipe rifle and missing all the shots... alright fine. There is still a fine line between okay cool that was fair he got the jump on me... then there‚Äôs well F0($ I might as well take off my pants and let this group do their way with my freshly dipped Mire @$$.
---
There sure are lots and lots of problems still with this game and i don't see them getting fixed any time soon.. But still i find myself logging in daily to do some small things around Appalachia.
---
Oh, yeah I don't have that. The pop-in I've seen was enemies, items, like zoning into a completely empty area.
---
I do not unfortunately
---
I'm past 500 now and have been playing since the week after release.
---
I've mostly reached the point where improvements to my character will be extremely incremental (i.e. I want the so-and-so effect on the left arm), so even the hunt for Legendaries is kind of "Eh."  Player vending is a definite shot in the arm though.
---
No they disappear like they‚Äôre atomic shop, but broken ones can be traded I‚Äôm buying 4 broken ones later tonight
---
I wouldn't but yea I know people will and always will to get an advantage over the rest. It's sad really. Let me get to lvl 50 spend 1000$ and get the best everything so I dont even have to play the game I can just run around and grief and fuck with people. I get it makes perfect since...
---
Huh, I guess we all have different pop in, bc I‚Äôve never experienced that.
---
Damm oh well its not required, but voice chat is better on there then xbox parties
---
Servers dedicated to just leveling wouldn‚Äôt be that fun... survival is out of the question if you actually intend to keep any components that you acquired...
---
I'm on the rocky ledges across the tracks from white springs and the spawn is kind of weird. Some of the time I end up just north of my razor grain plants near the camps door. Other times I end up on the ledge up overlooking the camp.
---
Nocturnal stuff kinda sucks, cause it takes a hit during the day. But otherwise it's not too shabby. :)
---
I'm a big Vampire fan, myself.
---
Good spot is at crevasse dam. You can pull a single melee mutant into the water to get downed.
---
That's what I hear, maybe I'll quit being lazy and make an account
---
The way this game handles pvp would never work for a battle Royale mode.
---
Its easy to set up and everything if you have a pc or just plug headset into your phone
---
Sure I guess certain areas should have pvp, but places like the forest.... as a level 15 just barely knowing what the hell is going on... come on
---
Sounds like the Xbox has it set for a lower draw distance for foliage. Is it every time you are up high? Or just every once in a while?
---
I put a vending machine outside and stuck Free on it. I put some common plans,ore, ammo and just junk i didnt want in it. People took it. Inside i have 2 machines with my for sale stuff. I think it helps. Nobody needs common plans outside of new players though and people are asking alot for items. Most vendors have the same stuff for sale. Aid items, ammo and ultracite explosive vent plans. We want good gear and hard to come by plans. If you don't have that you better have dirt cheap prices.
---
Im still trying to get my pals vampire rolling pin. Don't know why I just want it.üòÄ
---
I found that exited the camp edit mode and going into ur pipboy and equipping and unequipping items resets it. Kind of annoying but it works
---
In game text chat
---
It takes time. Sometimes I go 5 hours without players buying a thing from me and other times I have to close shop down because I reached my caps limit. One mans trash is another mans treasure. I have not even budged on lowering my prices. Are you in a good location? It helps to be near whitesprings as you will get more visitors than other locations.
---
The quickest way is to craft the chintziest Crossbow you can (Lv. 15?) and bash things with it while making sure Gunsmith isn't equipped.  Repair it the first moment you can.  Repeat.
---
Oh ok, I'll definitely do it sometime tonight. I'm currently trying to complete these tadpole challenges and cant find anyone to revive
---
I have only ever felt like a tagger on until recently when I blew a load of level ups on rerolling as a 50 cal tank, now I'm still only lvl 130s but fuck me does it feel good to line up with the big Bois at the front and lay down the firestorm ready for the melee sluggers to whomp fuck out of her!
---
That or it's a culture where cheating is socially acceptable and they developed a deserved reputation because of it,  but fuck nuance amirite?
---
Lol I hope you at least were able to get him back and not lose all the items..
---
They tag death bags in survival so it couldn't be that hard...but then death becomes even more meaningless.
---
Only once in a while. I‚Äôm pretty sure it is the draw distance tho. It also happens when you first load in while everything‚Äôs loading still.
---
Ima hop on in a lil bit and invite ya to a party
---
Player hub.
---
Have you exited build mode, re-entered and tried again? Or perhaps, instead of trying to connect A to B, try vice versa to see if that works? I've had the same thing happen to me, and each time either one of these worked to fix it.
---
Did you just try to justify racism? Nice man
---
Need help with the water one
---
I‚Äôve sold quite a bit. Everything from plans to junk to serums to ammo to 1-3* legendaries. Pricing matters and having large numbers and a spread of item types can be more enticing. 
---
Location matters as well. If you‚Äôre close to where other vendor camps are, you may get folks more willing to come. Being near the Scout quest locations helps as well.
---
I‚Äôve gotten killed by a rad roach that same way... lol I‚Äôll take your death as legitimate compared to mine haha
---
Lost 300 quantum‚Äôs and he left as soon as he grabbed them, gotta love survivalüò≠
---
Placing camps much closer to make little villages.
---
Sounds good, I may have to get off in a few but I'll be on later tonight. Gotta run the wife to the store
---
Tried both and even switched servers and none of it helped.
---
The only real option for one handed melee is a bloodied build, stacked with adrenal reaction.  
---
You'll be able to do a fair amount of damage, but the same build with a bloodied meathook/powerfist/deathclaw gauntlet or a super-sledge/fireaxe/war drum will legitimately do twice as much damage.  
---
There's obviously a point where the damage becomes erroneous fighting regular mobs, but for the Cryptid/SBQ/future raid bosses it is a huge disparity. It also is a MASSIVE disadvantage in PvP, where an opponent can run Blocker + Dodgy + Lone Wanderer and reduce your damage output by 105%. At this point, 2h/Unarmed can still perform admirably, but 1h melee gets left in the dust and you just get smoked.
---
I'll be coming

It‚Äôs sad. I‚Äôve sold my tse pump no point in even keeping it as they clearly don‚Äôt care for making shotguns viable fixing the ‚Äúexplosive bug‚Äù on shotguns made them even worse.

Bethesda, hire this person to write your bubblegum jokes. üòã

And if you're from Canada perhaps a "Soorrey" emote as well.

Water revive that is
---
I guess were all supposed to run bloody melee or vats builds. Any other build is almost useless. At this point i hope they release higher tier weapons to offset these nerfs or "corrections" as the fun police would have you believe.
---
Yeah, the only ammo I‚Äôve sold reliably.
---
Thanks for the advice. I think I will be switching my build!
---
Same here. It‚Äôs a great game. I just think the biggest frustration could really be fixed quite easily - allow players to rejoin the most recent server they were on if they want when the game crashes...
---
Shoot me a request Im Will The Vermin
---
Got a mic and all I normally play late in the evening unless it‚Äôs my day off.
---
That was just a bug this week, you usually have to be in survival mode for it
---
Bummer... It could‚Äôve been old survival before these recent patches and you could‚Äôve also lost like 200 caps with it though haha
---
Yeah, during that ill probably get a early dinner
---
I have a 2* Furious SS Shishkebab just waiting for the day they buff it!
---
i use -20% weight of food and chems set and carried 700 pound without backpack, now i can carry even more
---
Thanks for the advice! Looks like I will be switching my build.
---
I was having a discussion with a friend just yesterday about this. We were trying to figure the reasoning behind having to have a space between camps, and not be able to have them closer.
---
I wonder what it looks like when you have a floor piece selected to move or store to another player.  I know it's a grey shadow to the owner but you can still stand on it. 
---
You could have it selected, ready to pop into storage in less than a second.
---
You got it!
---
Oh
---
oh, no, the other shop was someone elses, the dude that sent the message was just also there too
---
Last night I built a set of stairs to nowhere to complete this challenge. Had someone waiting to revive me at the bottom. Walked up. Fell off. Got revived. It worked pretty well. I need to see if falling into a puddle will get the swimming one.
---
You got any unyielding sentinel you wanna trade or sell?
---
Probably pvp. Loading into survival next to a higher level guy could suck.

Man that‚Äôs too bad they can‚Äôt keep these people away. If these guys are indeed responsible for the server instability and they keep coming back and keep doing this shit that sucks. I didn‚Äôt know they were banning PSNs seems like a lot of work to create a new console account just to keep duping thought it was just Bethesda.net accounts. It really ruins my playing I rarely ever accept trade requests and never buy anything because of this.
---
That's what I mean, clickbait shitposts. Intentionally misrepresenting the game with just a tiny smidge of truth in it so they can justify themselves, that's what the youtube part of this game has mostly been. They love fanning the flames with fake news and exaggeration because that's what gets the clicks and that's what draws in the people who don't play the game, who will actually believe it
---
Yeah, I have a bloodied + ss Shishkebab and it is \*ok\*. But the damage I could get out of ANY other weapon with the same build is just staggering.  
---
Especially now that they removed the over-repair bonus. It's significantly shittier.
---
Happy to help! Good luck out there!
---
Plans and recipes no one is gonna buy if they already know the plan. I haven‚Äôt been to one vendor that I didn‚Äôt already know the plans they had listed. 
---
I‚Äôve made about 20k selling items since launch. Mostly serum and weapons, that I first overpriced. The player vendor market doesn‚Äôt work the same as Reddit so I adapted and lowered my prices accordingly. Bottom line, if you see several people stop by but don‚Äôt buy anything, then lower your prices. If you wanna get rid of recipes and plans, list them for 1-5 caps.
---
That would be nice or draw lines with the cheapest path. I‚Äôm usually eyeballing it to see if using a free spot is worth it.
---
LMAO, I will still have them just add me...
---
Nothing like that time i died at the sbq fight and took off my PA cause of where they nuked, than i died and it spawned me in the nuke zone 23 straight times before it finally got it right.
---
Much easier to call things racist and move on than to actually think about something critically,  I get it. I wasn't expecting much from you anyway.  Have a good day man
---
So basically putting on a piece of clothing and then taking it off again?
---
How tf do u carry 700
---
I have NUBWO wired headphones from Amazon that sound great and are dirt cheap (26.99). Intended as temp tukes but became my full timers. Bought a second pair I liked them so much.
---
I don‚Äôt have those legendary weapons like all the youtubers who had the privledge from the God of War to be bestowed with those weapons with shoots extra projectile, explosive,max damage, and the ‚Äúsmack you back to vault 76‚Äù modifications on it
---
Well, between that and the BoS plans and the X-01 Calibrated Shocks, it goes to show that in the long run, it's pretty much never worth your time to grind and server hop for hours looking for a particular plan/mod, because at some point, it will probably come to the surface again.
---
Yesterday I actually ran into someone who was in the same situation, we revived each other, but it didn't register for some reason and I'm back to square one. Guess I'm shelling out some caps for the Impostor Sheepsquatch event. Such a pain.
---
Watch all the locations people have mentioned on the map.   I found it at the water park entrance lot because like 5 people were assembled there.  I think when some people find it they message others to come too.  I didn't get the message but I went investigating the mob at that spot and found the camera car.
---
Yeah bud, I call it as I see it (:
---
Are you doing the event? That makes the possum badges less grindy. Look up the mod effects
---
I used to be a WoW mogul just by doing this. I would pick all the gathering professions and just sling herbs, metals and leather at slightly lower than market price.
---
r/choosingbeggers
---
I don't think I've ever come across a camp at that station ever. I guess lower level players might because it's a nice spot but it's too far away from high level locations for most to get level players.
---
Nocturnal works exactly like that but for Night/Day, so effects like that do exist.
---
If you're asking is Beserkers is meant to get weaker than a non-legendary, I don't know.
---
I have no unyielding sentinel at all yet. All of what I have is 1 or two star and most of them are either endurance, radiation resist or int or charisma. Nothing fancy yet just low level and some mid/high level but wood stuff as the extra. Inspite of my bloody and unyielding collections I don't really have multi star or useful/nice multistar ones yet other than the supersledge i just bought for 10k.
---
I have a Shishkebab with 40% faster swing speed and more damage after each consecutive hit that I call Thousand Cuts. I've always viewed the Shishkebab as my favorite Fallout  one handed weapon but even still the moment I got something decent in the two handed tree my damage went up by at least 4x. They really need to put in some proper work with these weapons; Shishkebab should have flame damage not energy and then it should also ignite enemies afterwards to deal dot and then ontop of that it only has one single mod.
---
An in-game method of communicating with people. I don't mean server text chat, I mean something actually immersive. Message boards at your camp, maybe a way of using terminals to ping other players. A radio system that allowed people on the same channel to voice/text chat across the map might be interesting - the FOnline games did that really well, I remember in the old days of 2238 people used them a lot for faction stuff before they all moved over to teamspeak/discord
---
Why would it bother you that they actually add proper pvp to the game? it's not like they're going to force you to play it
---
Fiy that camp blocking bit is a lie. I don‚Äôt know why so many people think that. If someone is camped there it changes the spawn point to the far side of the upper train track bridge. I have found him there multiple times when people have camps at the pond. Also I find him way more often on the road near Lady Janet‚Äôs soft serve. I hope this helps you.
---
Shotguns suck now and won‚Äôt be rebuffed, sell them they‚Äôre worthless
---
Given the fact that they stated they "threw" atoms at you...yeah no, this is another lie. They don't "throw" enough atoms to "get whatever you want". 
---
Which was clearly a lie at the time. No company wants to give enough of their paid currency away that people don't buy more.
---
Had to hop off for a while but I'm adding rn
---
Ohhh I like this! 
---
I still want a brahmin to adventure with, but I like this!!
---
Whitesprings vendors were a nice place to pick up stuff. Now a ghost town. Let's see what our mole miner friend has in store!
---
You and me both, seems we got twin swords.
---
It‚Äôs ok with me if Fallout 76 has a bit of everything.
---
My super sledge has power attack damage and damage to bugs. It's nothing special. And I don't really use legendary guns so normal guns work just fine.
---
Had to get off for a bit but im back, adding :)
---
I found one today and he didn't even drop a Torn Mothman Wing when I killed him. üòí
---
&gt; i use -20% weight of food and chems set
---
This means food and chems weight 10 times less
---
Wait, what? Like people being assholes and then pressing sorry?
---
It's not a guaranteed well crud
---
Even more community events like SBQ, Free Range, and Encryptid.
---
First couple of hours after update was insane busy. I set fair prices. A bit higher for legendaries, default value for most things and low prices for common items I use to drop at Overseer's camp. 
---
Today I shopped around looking for bargain basement prices to "flip" for small profits. I watch the map, once people stop visiting me, I server hop. I also try to keep a few items under each category. That seems to appeal to people rather than having 5000 ammo with nothing else.
---
And patience. I sit sometimes. I run other missions then check back after I hear a few cha chings to refill my box. Load your vendor box, then play the game. Return, refill, repeat. Count your caps.
---
I know, I mean how do you have 700 pounds of weight
---
I was stressing over how to get this one done when I came across a low level player and watched him get mauled by Mr. Gutsy's only to revive him and leave again
---
Silver? Names? Wantttt!!
---
Excavator w emergency protocols = huge carry and huge survivability IMO.
---
Location location location
---
I mean, they have horde events.
---
They suck, because they don't have threatening enemies synergise together in them. But they already exist.
---
Floods/ storms/ disasters could be put in the same way, being random events.
---
I would love some events that are tuned to be much harder to deal with than current.
---
#HOW?!?
---
I can help. When I get back inside I'll add you and I'm on pretty much all the time.
---
I‚Äôm almost always trapped in excavator power armor.
---
Permanently weighted.
---
Honestly, I'm not planning to go out of my way to get the mods.  The +60 carry weight is nice and I'm content with that.
---
He also spawns at the lady janets, just down the road past the wrecked bus.
---
Is your camp multi-storey? There is a height restriction, I can't place any wires on top floor of my camp.
---
Absolutely right. Encryptid took me 3 days before i even saw the event. A week later i had 8 tries and i had 8 fedoras. Bought everything 2nd hand after that. Will do same with scouts items. Effort put in is never worth the reward in this game.
---
I prefer unyielding but I die... relatively often. Things usually die before they hit me or can't damage me thanks to serendipity but when I die nowadays it tends to be getting one or two shot by a stingwing, radscorp or something with similar armor negation or a thing that just gets lucky.
---
What marked location is it next 2
---
Yeah I‚Äôd also like to know
---
I'm more curious why it causes so many sandy bunched panties.
---
I'm pretty sure it's only once they're aggroed. They changed to that in FO4 and basically made perception useless as a base stat. I miss actually getting the blip well before you see them/they see you. Pretty useless having 15 to Perception and there's no change to when you see the enemy versus rank 1 :T
---
It's perfectly \*understandable\* that they'd want the intake of atom to be low so people actually buy atom but at this point it's almost impossible to reliably farm atom
---
It‚Äôs a nerf in order to balance with the slightly nerfed magic armors.
---
Location and goods. I‚Äôve made easily over 30k caps. I am also in the area near the George Junkyard.
---
I'll help with it ps4 tag is jackeatpumkin123
---
I really wish we had an answer for this, because I don't understand why "Rejoin Last World" hasn't been a feature from the beginning.  The best you can do, right now, is to make friends and join servers where they are playing.  That way, you can rejoin a server through a friend if something happens.
---
Not that it helps reclaim Workshops, though.
---
I said the same thing and had a bunch of people tell me off. r/karmaroulette
---
(runs back and forth for backpack upgrades)
---
Buyers remorse is terrible thing.
---
I am close. I have to transfer items to alts or friends' alts to stay useful. Otherwise excavator and all the carry weight perks and backpack still wouldn't be enough. I have been stuck in my excavator for a week or so, more than once though.
---
Fasnacht 2!
---
There's a massive griefer population in this game that cackles in glee when they get to steal all the juicy loot from people who, say, die right after they fight a scorch Queen.
---
I would love to check that out. I love themed builds. I made my camp a comic book shop.
---
‚ÄúWelcome to my Camp! I won‚Äôt hurt you‚Ä¶ unless provoked.‚Äù
---
This is the best way I've found to get a bunch of milk for making recipes like the fasnacht doughnuts and s'mores.
---
I mean, 50 ish a day, another what, 200 per week?
---
"bUt I'm HaVinG FuN WiTH thE GaME!!!"
---
Those days are long gone by now. You no longer have a game cart you just stick in and play. Modern AAA games are far too complicated for that, you have to choose your game mode, choose your character, choose your launcher, choose to ignore the cash shop...
---
Holy shit.  Not sure why I didn't think of this!! I did it for the crossbow challenge.  Lol
---
I'm far from unkillable, but I use Unyielding and Bolstering pieces.  Even with the recent nerf, the Sentinel/Cavalier effect is still better than nothing too.
---
Confirmed this, on the patch of grass above the bunker. Thanks!
---
It was pretty picky about it before. I gave having a garden next to my camp because corn and razorgrain just have the weirdest space detection. Each stalk of corn can't be anywhere within 4 feet of anything unless it's directly inside of it. Muttfruit seem pretty chill, but I'm pretty sure if my character could piss, it'd come out purple from all the juice.
---
I mean it's 700 pounds without armor
---
Serious question, did you consider it perfectly normal that your weapon was one shotting end game enemies in a MMO?
---
This game has a way of just punishing us instead of rewarding us. Thats my biggest issue with this game. I never feel rewarded or any accomplishment You put in work and you are almost never rewarded for it. Instead some bug or issue comes along and says thanks for wasting your time.
---
Hahaha, yes. Rolling pin of DEATH.
---
I fast traveled back to my camp near white springs earlier today and found a dead scorchbeast inside my camp, a second one a little north of me by the white springs train station, a third one right in front of the white springs gate, and a forth inside the gate.
---
The higher capacity mod gives you 120lbs (lvl50) at a cost of -60 DR/ER. Refrigerator mod increases time it takes for food to spoil by 60%, I believe, at the cost of -30lb carry capacity.
---
Yes it is - three floors to be precise. However, I have managed to place wires on all three floors without a problem. It‚Äôs my small building, with my vendors, that is causing problems. It‚Äôs on the same level as my bottom floor on my main building. I can easily place the power connectors, but the wires won‚Äôt connect with the power connectors. Everything works as it should until I press triangle to attach the wire to the connector.
---
Do you need a Bethesda.Net account on console? In that case they probably just ban that one. But for console it's not really a problem. Even with a new PSn account you can still just play the same copy of the game, if the console is set to the primrary console of the one who originally bought the game. Same goes for the disc version.
---
For PC though, since everything works per the bethesda Launcher you actually have to rebuy the game every time so that seems like a lot to do just to keep cheating.
---
I think valuing lack of patience over cash is precisely what he is calling them an idiot for. Lol?
---
Mama Murphy's quest glitch
---
It means that Fallout 76 is an objectively broken and rushed product. If you're enjoying, I'm glad for you and please keep doing so if that makes you happy. I, for one, couldn't even get a refund.
---
yes
---
Advanced power connections you mean?  Should be available on BoS or Watoga as I recall.  Best to check the Whitespring mall.
---
That bitch
---
Sounds good, but where‚Äôs the line between QOL and advanced hand holding? I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs better to make corpses easier to find than just auto looting
---
They really get mad about that? That's gold. I wonder how they'd react to me selling a bunch of old TSE weapons I stole from dupers back in the day for less than a thousand each
---
Does anything trigger that daily? I keep trying to activate it, but it almost never shows up when i'm in that area.
---
If they have open windows with a crafting bench close by you can 'use' them to teleport into their base. Most people lock their doors because they are tired of coming home to finding a molerat humping their decon arch in the rubble of their base.
---
assuming it's a BE shotgun, it should definitely be able to oneshot end-game mobs since the weapon itself is classified as end-game.
---
not to mention mediocre melee weapons can oneshot most things, even end-game, with ease.
---
Oh, I just meant the death respawn thing. I knew you could travel there for free.
---
Tip, find a mirelurk queen spawn, there are several.
---
Equip one of the cripple perks, there are several. Enforcer is easiest.
---
Shoot her until all her legs are broken, this is much harder than on any other enemy, and can take abnormally long depending on your luck.
---
Once her legs are crippled she will collapse, stand behind her, she can't acid or melee if you are behind her. Note that she isn't facing the way she is facing, she kinda falls and angles her body slightly to the side, but this doesn't effect her true facing and angles of fire. She will never get back up.
---
While you are behind her she will use the only attack she has that can hit you, spawning mirelurk hatchlings.
---
She spawns them in groups of 2-4 as long as there are less than 6. kill any that aren't diseased down to 5, then keep killing new ones until you get lucky and she spawns 4 diseased at once. This is unnecessary, but you have time to kill so it keeps the mind numbing boredom at bay. 
---
I spent an hour getting beaten on by 9 while starving and taking rad away and failed to catch the woops. It is not an easy or quick process, I don't want to think about having to do it with one spawn.
---
Language,.....
---
It's "That Communist Bitch."
---
Pain Train!  Woot woooooot!
---
Electrified mutation blows the legs out from under very low level ghouls and scorched that melee you, but that's not a PA thing.
---
XD
---
Oh so that‚Äôs what it is called
---
Il be clear. I have never asked for help. 
---
I am just saying, a game to which Bethesda said you can happily play solo, is not quite solo when people have to go on reddit to ask for someone to die for them.
---
That's hardly engaging gameplay is it? Solo or not solo
---
Flatwoods. Then radiate out on the map as you level up. Stay away from cranberry bog until lvl 20 or be very careful.
---
take 700 pounds of chems, put armor on and you get only 70 pounds
---
Tesla coils, works like a bug zapper.
---
I think it's there, but only available in the Canada region.  Not that they do stupid shit, but they have a cultural need to apologize.
---
Please add ceiling/wall turrets too...
---
I love most of the stuff that they did in Wild Appalachia (WA). I just hate to see that the next few months of updates and patches to the game are going to be for modes that the fallout series wasn't made for.
---
Plus all that downloading and installing I have to waste my time on the TD and BR modes whereas I could be playing WA content.
---
Making a multiplayer Fallout at first was a bad idea but it grew on me. I play solo 98% of the time so having multiplayer isnt that bad. But knowing that they are adding TDBR modes in, Its just gonna upset me more than the day I found out that Fo76 was going to be a multiplayer game.
---
What we need first, before adding that kinda small cosmetic things is fixing of all the major bugs and glitches that still  plague the game.
---
Ah ok, should work then if its on the bottom floor. Maybe try moving your power connectors around, could be that placement of the connectors is the issue.
---
Oh lol, I thought you were literally saying you could carry 700 pounds carry weight wise
---
Can I ask when you played last so I know what info you already know.
---
Search function will give you 100x posts about this same subject. From this week only.
---
I tried survival and didn't last 10 minutes till someone mowed me down with some exploding weapon. I said fuck this shit.
---
What sucks is you use to be able to trade them..... for some reason BGS took that ability away
---
This is the most WV thing I‚Äôve seen
---
Thanks but I‚Äôd rather speak with people, I asked a bunch of questions that require both opinions and facts.
---
of course not
---
I think like 5 months ago
---
Like how quantum grenades still dont work
---
Where from the station is this place
---
Make it an optional download so I dont have to waste my time downloading data ill NEVER use.
---
Yes,  of course that could just be coincidence but its worth a try
---
Gulpers eat everything including deathclaws
---
Fasnacht in July!
---
Chat presets that you can change in your settings that are added to (or that replace) the emotes. I understand not wanting to type while playing because I play on PS4.  But trying to get your point across that you want help with quests and not just need revived is literally impossible with the emotes.
---
 No worries!
---
I imagine it'd be something like this:
---
*Take a camera picture of a player under the influence of Daddy-O*
---
*Take a camera picture of a player under the influence of Day Tripper*
---
*Take a camera picture of a player under the influence of Fury*
---
*Take a camera picture of a player under the influence of Jet*
---
*Take a camera picture of a player under the influence of Orange Mentats*
---
After you get out of the
---
And its not quite the same as people asking others to help in some epic 30 min+ challenging battle. Its asking somebody to pop on and die for them, then you die for them.
---
The setup would take longer then the actual execution. And for what? One challenge of 5+ for a single badge? Yeah, I mean that's just ridiculous. Defend it all you want. Its still ridiculous.
---
It‚Äôs because I did try that but it didn‚Äôt work for me :/
---
I've only seen this twice, both times in the mire.
---
Oh fuuuuucccckkkk friend found!
---
I'll try to get on tonight if not I will for sure be on tomorrow night 9pm Atlantic time
---
I had hours of it basically being coop, no pvp at all. I hopped around from event to event and briefly to my house but I stealthed as much as possible and was doing for the sole survivor so a lot of people were just event hopping and participating at the time.
---
&gt;	Disconnecticut
---
This is truly underrated
---
I‚Äôll try when I wake up tomorrow. The whole game has been more buggy than usual for me since the recent patch unfortunately :/
---
You select them in the atom shop. Same with player icons. Itll have a check mark next to it when you select it.
---
No not at all, not complaining I was seriously asking. I thought they seemed overpowered before....
---
Understand the death penalty meaning, just frustrating when people hover in sheep imposter, watching as your revive timer dwindles waiting to take your bag.
---
I felt bad because when the expansion before last came out and I made millions, literally millions, of gold selling herbs. Then they let you buy herbs from a vendor and the price dropped by 75%. My guilt came from not needing the gold for anything, I just liked logging on and looking at the number :p
---
Long, long ago, I used to smuggle wool from the Alliance side to the Horde side AH, and I'd use the money to buy cockroaches and such and smuggle those back to the Alliance side AH.  I funded my  fast flying mount that way.  Again, a long long time ago.
---
Deng sorry pup,  maybe try exiting camp mode and then just spamming the button and then going back into it?
---
Why shouldn't you have to? All of the things on the atom store are cosmetic. It's not like you can go into the atom store and buy a fat man or some sweet power armor. Sounds kinda like you just want to complain about the game.
---
Quite honestly the worst part of player vending is that you cant bulk Ammo in this game 1 cap per bullet? thats absurd.
---
Yup got mine with 5 sheepsquatch
---
Yeah while I fully understand that it was not right before I hate these mid game corrections after we spend all this time getting to where we are....:)
---
The ones at Watoga HS definitely don't work.   Five of them total at the stage area and played each until the well tuned buff appeared.   Not one counted to the challenge of playing ANY instrument at Watoga High School.   I appreciate the added content but would I would love is if the content all worked.
---
No. Like how 3 star enemies still dont drop 3 star gear.
---
Yeah I am considering going to heavy from here....
---
I am pretty sure it was that you needed the arms only.
---
Ha! I finally completed it yesterday, having never seen the leader of the pack event spawn. 
---
It was on every server I joined today. The game just knows when you‚Äôre looking!
---
Oh great! I‚Äôm going on level 7 now so I should be a few more before tomorrow and I am off on Monday as well :)
---
Yep definitely works w/ sheep squat challenge
---
Embrace it and go full on Florida Man. Camp on that junk mode south of the golf course that has two dead trucks and shit in "the yard", put a gaudy fountain &amp; some flamingos out front, and make the place look like a ghetto fab meth house. Tattered rugs, mismatched furniture, a couple beer signs on the wall, etc...
---
Yup hunting rifle reload is freaking slow even with speed demon. My repeater seems way more powerful. Some guns on paper don't seem that much better but using them it is a night and day difference.
---
hahah. Thanks!
---
I'm a data miner. It's you only need the torso now.
---
My IGN name is Baba Yaga
---
pfft, I have only ever seen 3 brahmin around the church. I must be blind.
---
bos graveyard in front of huntersville
---
Same. I gave up and went for another challenge because it wouldn't milk them.
---
That's not really how online games work sorry to say, just because content doesn't appeal to you doesn't mean the content should be scrapped, there's plenty of people that enjoy pvp that didn't complain about the pve additions
---
Now that‚Äôs it‚Äôs been a month any update at all about the whole suspension situation?
---
I agree, at least let us correct our builds. That be the fair thing to do.
---
Don't you get it from scrapping many many laser pistols/rifles
---
Had a few attack my base before I started all these challenges yesterday.   I have yet to see a wolf since then.   Still need to photograph one and kill one with a knife.   Cooked some wolf meat from that encounter later as part of the hunting badge and it counted.
---
Holy hell. The things I'll do for achievements.
---
I respect your dedication to completion.
---
And wash it down with toxic water - breakfast of champions
---
Fffffuck ‚Äúmarket value‚Äù in video games. Get a grip people! Folks are absolutely ridiculous about this shit. It‚Äôs a GAME. Period. 
---
It‚Äôs honestly mind blowing to me the amount of energy people waste being pissed off at this game and the people who casually play it. 
---
If you think the price is too high/low, move on to the next camp and carry on about your day. Mother fuckers acting like they just lost their real job. Because they can‚Äôt sell duped TSEs for 40k. 
---
OP‚Äôs price is fine. And if it isn‚Äôt I don‚Äôt give a shit.
---
Seen this in a few other threads.   Gulpers can have them as something of a rare drop from what I have read.   Deathclaws apparently do not have them.
---
Hey I play on ps4 and I wouldn‚Äôt mind typing to someone here and there
---
Thats intended its not a bug lol
---
I am in pc looking for help with this. Happy to meet at whitesprings GT kmart26167
---
I competed this by walking up to a rando and asking over mic if I could revive them for the backpack. They thumbs upped, then proceeded to jump off the top of a building multiple times until their death.
---
Don't be afraid friend,  just ask.
---
Start the free range event in the Mire guaranteed spawn for the first mob encounter.
---
Can you set powered things up on a timer like in Fallout 76? Have it set to turn off every 60 seconds so people can‚Äôt AFK
---
What‚Äôs your tag
---
What event?
---
It doesn't double.
---
its +/- 50%
---
I believe the breakpoint where it cancels out is 60 armor. which is a power armor frame with no power armor.
---
after 120 it's -50%
---
I personally think it can be salvaged by adding more items like the extra carry weight backpack that reduce your armor, as this allows you to wear armor for the legendary effects and actually make use of berserker effect as an ancillary benefit.
---
Kind of where I'm leaning
---
Not quite conducive to building in the game though is it. Maybe they should of took the odd liberty because what is not fun is trying to build anything without at least huge plants sticking through foundations etc or being forced to build a certain way because there is no flat area at all.
---
The Head Oreo
---
Haha, I figured that was why you thought it was super grindy. 
---
The campfire tales event at camp Adam in the southwestern side of the map has a 25% chance to drop a possum badge, just server hop it
---
Have galas, dances, big dinners, shindigs, etc inside the Whitespring. We mainly just use it for the vendors now, but there's dining and ballrooms there and we  need to have big events in there.
---
How? By picking the lock and letting in monsters maybe?
---
All right I‚Äôll look you up
---
Pain Train perk
---
Saving this post! Thanks!
---
BTW this makes zero sense to me. Damage bonus from berserker should be higher than bloodied
---
I'm not even against the idea of buying microtransactions in games to support the devs, but it sure as hell isn't me sliding them a tip for a job well done
---
I‚Äôm down with this.
---
Yesterday. I had one ghouls linger like that. Grenades the sucker and finally killed it. Health drops to almost dead then rubber bands to something  thing like 25% over and over. I was just going to leave it at 25% since it was crippled and it couldn't do anything.
---
I bought a t51 jet pack for 50 from a guy but I had to complete a fun house to get to it
---
I heard most of the mods are -30 weight; armor is 80 DR, and extra capacity is like 60 extra weight and -60/-60 DR/ER I wana say or maybe -30
---
I find it kind of unreasonable to dismiss the atom shop as being just cosmetic when the atom shop is the only progression in this game next to RNG armor and weapon rolls, I'm fairly confident in saying that microtransactions being anything but optional is insanely anti-consumer, I shouldn't have to spend 10 dollars to buy a pink pip boy
---
So many people don't seem to know you can repair something before it's completely broken. All it needs is less than 100%. I took Weapon Artisan off but crafting a low level one still yielded 150% quality, not sure if the Gunsmith level effected that.
---
Did it change at some point, because I thought it was that way, before at least.
---
I had the exact opposite problem the other day. Traveled to someone's vendor and ended up locked in the interior. Picked the lock to get out, but ended up wanted.  Dude came back to his camp and I explained and he was cool about it. Sucks cause you can no longer fast travel to other camps when "wanted". Shortly thereafter another player showed up and mowed me down for the 10 caps bounty though.
---
I found the course start at the **New River Gorge Bridge - East** map point. It is at the beginning of the bridge, on the left side when looking west across the bridge.
---
The fact you get a 1* just doesn‚Äôt seem right with all the prefixes intended or not. Fight me ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
There's a challenge to kill 76 scorched with a crossbow that you can work on along the way. Morgantown airport, and highschool are both 100% level 1-6 scorched.
---
People who lock their doors beyond level 1 (level 1 maybe to stop humanoid creatures) and leave benches/beds/instruments by windows, or better yet, use the single large brick windows, are just asking for a surprise paper bag on their bed.  If you're gonna put up the big "F U" to other players that just want to sightsee, you might want to make your base airtight.

This happened to me earlier today.   Was picking a level 3 lock in the raider area near Top of the World when the game froze and closed.    Didn't think much of it other than it was just a crash which happens with this game.   The timing of it was unusual as I could not remember another instance of it happening while picking a lock.    I played for several hours afterwards without crashing once.    Playing on PC.
---
It always required the torso but before this patch it required the arms too
---
I still haven't gotten it, it's down to that and swamp itch, but that other one is so easy I haven't bothered.
---
Whoopsies though is a real nightmare.
---
They were. I haven't used a tse shotgun since before the nerf, but I have a really hard time believing they are reaching anywhere near obscurity. People used to complain about how broken the enforcer perk is, and that was never changed. It's just that the meta involved killing things before they could even get crippled.
---
Was just gonna say make sure you don't have artisan selected if you craft one. Morgantown airport is a good spot to go, lots of low level enemies out in the open.
---
It is a better time. How much better, is up to you to decide.
---
Not sure if it's Gunsmith or just your Intelligence coming into play. Best to dumb down with alcohol first, too.
---
I've just started playing again. Stopped playing several months back. 
---
I honestly like it a good bit better with the player vending and extra content. It feels more of a finished game than before and the legendary enemy drops have been much better too. Like now 3* enemies will actually drop 2 or 3* items unlike before. Plus I'm kinda exited for more content coming soon.
---
I haven't tried out the new brewing stuff cause I haven't started the quests yet but soon.
---
In my opinion it's nice to be back in it and it feels good, really. Other than the servers are still kinda iffy after the recent update.
---
Yeah I don't mind at all if they're not interested.  It's nothing personal, in both directions.
---
There are a lot of opinions both good and bad and this question is asked multiple times every day, so probably be beat to read through the other posts and decide for yourself
---
There‚Äôs an event in the forest, can‚Äôt remember the name, up near the Ferris wheel on the map. You have to wipe out three wolf packs. Good way to get three low level legendary pieces.
---
I will probably delete this post, since it's getting asked so much.
---
Ohhhh boy. Fo76 is so tame compared to many other games out there right now. I really don't mind it due to years of logging into WoT and having a good 5-10 minutes before you're actually in a match. It's a different sort of game, too. An online game like this will always be longer than a fps that's *Start game. Hit start. Resume game* and you're in the action.
---
Ok, thanks.
---
It‚Äôs good to hear Loot was fixed 
---
From what I‚Äôve read pvp is still pointless/hopeless, any ideas ?
---
Actually, that's a fine idea, dedicating one machine to free stuff, I might copy that! I wanted to ask Bethesda to give us buildable containers for giveaways (or customers' donations, but it would obviously be free-for-all), but your way is not as dangerous: the freebies will survive a crash or a server disconnect.
---
Its the ice cream cone between the forest and toxic valley, to the right of the turkey, on the road
---
Thanks for the info.
---
No problem!
---
Some things are still worth more than that, but not many. I bought a TSE dragon for 10k a couple nights ago because it's my buddy's dream weapon and I knew he'd cover it next time he's on.

It‚Äôs -60 ER and rad resist for the high capacity mod.. insulated is 30 carry weight with an added 90 ER
---
Anyone who ignores the people taking care of the pylons is an ass. I may just be bitter. I run pylons all the time and never get a revive.
---
But selling that stuff circumvents people doing the quest and what is the point of playing a game if you dont want to play the game?
---
It's automatically added to you.
---
Not entirely sure what you mean by this(sorry)
---
If you‚Äôre still on I‚Äôd be happy to help
---
Technically you could argue that in some circumstance having lots of health but no armor is better than having armor but no health, so the damage bonus is fair.
---
If it weren't for the fact armor is super important, and health can't be increased to meaningful levels.
---
Berserkers could be twice bloodied but it would still be borderline unusable without the -armor backpack mod.
---
Yea pretty much the same as before with PvP. Hear that the new survival mode isn't really anything special so I haven't tried it.
---
Although since I started again I haven't run into anyone just going out and trolling people or anything. Actually I don't think I've seen anyone with a bounty the past couple days. So I think PvP in this game is probably not gonna go anywhere.
---
Yeah, you have to sell the pieces separately from the frame. It's seriously eating into my stash space right now.
---
Fuck, you got lucky!
---
Nah, I'd pay that. If they don't like the price don't buy it. Think I played 350 for just the mods. Don't stress about it, I seen a perfectly preserved pie for sale at 5000caps the other day. So I'd say your prices are fair
---
Some are trying to scope out your build for bad intentions.  Often, it is kids who don‚Äôt want  to speak and let you know they are only 12...
---
Please see this post where I answer that question.
---
Yeah, I just bought high capacity.
---
120 carry weight 
---
-60 energy resist
---
-60 rad resistance
---
As you were out wandering the wasteland in the upper left-hand corner of your screen you will see items being sold and coins deposited.
---
This morning I just put my vending machine on a switch to easily disable when I don‚Äôt want my camp visible.
---
Jet packs are handy for getting past the annoying ground floor locks.
---
Exactly the same design, just the possum one is darker if I remember correctly
---
I need help my gt is SPY TEMOC
---
He's... In the massage parlor now. Next to Aloe/Vera. You know this, right?
---
[Here's a pic of it in game](https://imgur.com/wJHJv71).  I thought it was a different backpack style, but it's just a darker variant of the tadpole "paint".  Kinda bummed I didn't see this post first and saved the three points towards the larger capacity mod.
---
I've gotten possum badges from Campfire Tales.  Not every time, but I've gotten two so far.  When the game is turning towards evening, keep a look out for it.  I got S'mores recipe today from it.
---
Also, two fails in a row on the event today.  One was where you have to keep the fire lit while killing enemies, which I've never successfully done even while frantically running from kindling pile to kindling pile, and the other was someone that DCed while collecting the clues.  Whatever he picked up failed to register, and disappeared from the world so the event became impossible to complete.

When playing on an alt character, I was so excited to see the herpetologist progression notification popup as soon as I captured a frog.  I was like, "Sweet!  They fixed it!".  Excitedly check my challenges and nada.
---
Thanks, I'll keep a look out for the notification :)
---
Just got message. Still need help. Can return the favor. Add me Stinkyglen. Hope to be on tonight in about an hour
---
Yeah I found this objective offensive. I revive players every time I'm in a big event like sbq or sheepsq impostor because I always have a shit load of stims, But other than that I play by myself so I'm fucked until who knows when.
---
I lost emotional attachment to my junk because of this. Now when I die I just laugh and hope for the best, check where I can respawn. I can't count the times or caps I've lost due to *ONLY* being able to respawn at vault 76 :/.
---
yeah, and if you bothered to search your question you would find a bunch of fuckin answers buddy.
---
Interactive Story Time!

Upvote this comment to have our hero follow xXSwagZaddy6969Xx because he's a little whimp. 
---
Downvote if you think that he should fight the bastard 1v1 in real life right then and there and make his way to the holy Leather Right Leg himself, because honestly, after fighting the Super Mutants at West-Tek, is there really anything other than a lvl 18 Grafton Monster that our favorite BDSM-fetishist can't kill?
---
Comment Karma starts at 0, balance will decide. If the Karma ends up at 0, I'll think of something wacky √° la Wild Wasteland.
---
The possum backpack is just a skin/paint.  [Here's a pic of it](https://imgur.com/wJHJv71).  Same as tadpole, just darker.
---
Same carry weight as the standard pack.
---
They moved him into the massage parlor mate

Anyplace where i've seen a screenshot of, I trust.  I've seen a screen of a tourist draped over the handrail at the top of Landview Lighthouse and I personally found mine at the picnic bench by the Giant Teapot.
