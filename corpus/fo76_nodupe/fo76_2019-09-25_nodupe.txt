thanks, didn't know about the accuracy bit. I thought it was just range and per.

It’s a bug with the legendary perk “take one for the team”.
---
I thought about making a character like this once.Wanted to make a toon that wore nothing but rags used a death claw gauntlet and had natural defenses through perks and mutations. Drank and ate everything I encountered for buffs etc.Unfortunately the perks I would want numbered way too high even with legendary ones it still would.On top of all that there would still be some huge barriers for the toon to deal with.
---
I felt the same.
---
This is the normal price for ammo, if their charging more then move on.
---
Do people want that many more water purifiers everywhere
---
Probably teaching you to suck eggs but I'll go through what I do.
---

---
You can find lead weights at the following sites; the three silos, at the top of the Monorail Elevator, in the Palace of the Winding Path, in the court yard of the Eastern Regional Penitentiary, at Green County Lodge, Charleston Fire Station, in the Sludge Works Camp on the Ash Heap,  and in the Hornwright Estate.
---
When making ammo make sure you equip the following perk cards to make the most of your resources, Super-duper, Ammosmith and if you can unlock it, the Ammo Factory legendary perk is a godsend 
---
Again apologies if you know most of this!
---
I'm still selling 20-30k ammo a week, but I only sell 50.cal, 5mm, 308.,5.56 and 45.
---
The fact that a AAA dev team can continue to fuck things like this up STILL is a travesty.
---
I fucking hate the devs, they are garbage.
---
Isn’t it possible get loot from team member kills , even without getting a hit in?
---
See if the high-levels at your event are on a public team.
---
Bloodied have always been fragile.
---
That's what I always do, especially in uranium fever. I stay by the first spawn point and use melee on enemies that pass because I'm bloodied unarmed and when it shows up I switch to my gun, take two shots (which is like 10% of the health because I don't have perks to buff it), call people over and usually there's someone who just runs over and kills it which sucks. Especially since I gave them and everyone else a chance to kill it.
---
Sometimes people think it was me when the emote finishes and they get there and see it dead. I normally do a thumbs down or angry face too and shoot as whoever really did it.
---
I might start blocking people like that so I never have to encounter them again
---
I usually make my own ammo. I never really see it in shops either. I can only assume most People use the same ammo as me, OR, you simply dont find them lying around. I pick up alot and I have never ever picked up my type of ammo in any place. So, maybe You sell the wrong kind of ammo?
---
I spend 3x more ammo now than i used to do. NOW monsters are harder to kill and instead of Just 1-3 bullets it took for me to kill creatures, now i most likely have to whack it with a good 10-15 bullets :(
---
by the way, the devs finest spaghetti code makes it so you can kill the enemy with a normal gun but you need to pull out the saber straight afterwards to get the credit. Dumb I know.
---
exactly, same as with all radiation sources - when I'm coming back to my camp to use Radiation Barrel I need to wait couple of seconds for barrel to work. If you go out of Monongah mine after Colossal Problem you also have couple of seconds to equip hazmat suit or chinesse stealth armor before rads kills you.
---
We cant just invulnerable to everything wheres the challenge?
---
Would it work if you fast swap to a melee weapon while charging?
---
It is probably really hard to develop a whole system that counts every single exchange on a day to day basis. Setting avg net prices on trades and things of that sort would be so much fun. However that is a whole game of its own and probably better enjoyed if we set that type of value on things. It sucks there isn't a Trading Vendor that allows inventory exchange with more than one item to be trade-able.  Would trading shrink the player base more or less?
---
Can't seem to find you on Xbox. You on PS4?
---
i feel like tank builds are great especially with the new legendary perks you can pick
---
Bloodied are actually tank builds.
---
1cap each seems to be the standard to sell ammo for in my experience. Don't think I've seen anyone selling for more
---
I will keep them until I get caps for them goddammit!
---
[removed]
---
Legit question, what's the point of finishing it as fast as possible?  
---
The reason I ask is that I've been trying to get to the event for the past few days and every time I spawn the event is over.  I have not been able to deposit any prime meat and it all spoils so I toss it away.  
---
So back to my question, do you get better rewards? more rewards? unique rewards for completing within certain time limit (like daily ops)?   If not then, with all due respect, screw your suggestions ;)
---
You think that's bad?? Try the thorn.  150 script per piece to make... Iv been doing it for a month
---
It's a bug that is being exploited so how can you possibly say "that's on you" like it's his fault? The dude had no idea you clown
---
There are far too many people that over charge on this game. I like to set my prices at respectful level so everyone benefits. Tips hat to everyone else that does the same ;)
---
I thought I'd scare them with my huge power armor and guns. Apparently not
---
You get two minutes before the event actually starts, and a pop-up letting you know that it has arrived. Additionally, the event runs once every hour (for me it's on the :30min mark). If you aren't there for the event, that's kind of on you. It's an event that a lot of us will complete at least dozens of times before meat week ends, and we aren't interested in spending several minutes cleaning poop piles and collecting greens.
---
That's not really what is being discussed here. The point is how to indicate to gathered players when everyone is ready to start the timer in the event itself.
---
happend to me too when i used it, the bug was also in fallout 4, idk what causes it, it's not very intrusive so i dont really care
---
Are they not boosted by strength?
---
Could have sworn I got an notification about a reply from someone who thought it was their camp, near top of the world that this all kicked off beside. Sounds like the right location, it was a camp right by PV Station and a short walk from the prime event that takes place near there, the one with the Brahmin beside the pond.  
---
If your camp was a big boxy thing beside that then it likely was you.
---
No shit. But you guys keep saying how Bloodied is super tanky. 
---
Sounds like bloodied is only fragile *when it fits your narrative*.
---
what level are you? because i just buy bulk lead from vendors for 70/10 pieces
---
Bummer yes I am sorry, was looking at ps4 trades and saw your post, just assumed. Google lead deposits and build over one of those like I said, and scrounge for steel items to scrap instead, it'll be easier for you ATM as steel items are everywhere. You'll also need acid and cloth also so tag them in your pipboy if you know how too so you'll know what items to pick up and never walk past a tin can, you should be collecting them every chance you get. I'm sure if you made another post if you're desperate for ammo someone on Xbox will help you. Most of the fallout community love to help new players.
---
And since Microsoft owns Bethesda now, I might just see you on that platform one day lol, good luck!
---
I've only once (twice including this incident) been drawn into PvP against my will. The other time was a while ago and was someone exploiting (in my view) my lack of knowledge about the workshop mechanics, i.e. luring me into going hostile when my intentions were innocent.
---
I didn't see any in his camp, maybe he did that in workshops idk... Thing is, i got much needed amount of ammo without effort and without cheating lol, everybody's happy
---
Fallout just doesn't feel the same without a companion by your side.
---
Honestly, I’m not sure. I’ve seen them stay at a consistent 83 with bloody mess on my characters, even with differing levels of strength, but I’ve heard some people say it is affected by strength.
---
Even then, they’re still so weak as to hardly be usable by the end.
---
What I do, is I clear all the enemies so only I can draw aggro. Then I sprint from toxic sludge to sludge, moving too quick for the moles to do anything. Once I complete a lap or two, I run up the straight staircase by the turret. They will come single file to their deaths. Hope this helps.
---
No apologies needed dude, those are really helpful tips right there. I'm level 27 on my main and 24 on alt that I'm struggling on (thought I'd try energy weapons and realised they're crap after manufacturing loads of cells). I've only come across weights at flatwoods, but I'll keep an eye out for those other locations.
---
The bloodied gauss minigun probably has the best dps of the heavy guns that isn't a legacy or magic weapon(although it can be), only problem you'll run into is keeping it fed. A BE gatling is still very strong, fun to use, and very ammo efficient, definitely should still be on your wishlist

Yes, in the next update, sure...
---
I'm repairing my explosive fixer halfway through a daily ops every time... I almost don't even want to use it anymore bc it's sucking up all of my repair kits.
---
That would be cool even if I would never use the perk personally, kind of like the lockpick and hacking one.
---
I've scrapped all my unneeded cards for coins and noticed that every category has only small handful of extra cards left.... except intelligence.  Still need to scroll through that one for a second to see them all.
---
I don't know if it still works or a thing, but if the event for Campfire Tales pops up. exploit the one phase for the duration of the event time by hiding in a cabin and kill every fucking bloodbug that goes through the door. Limitless spawn of bloodbugs until timer runs out and collect their proboscis which gives 2 acid each.
---
Oh no. I've seen some of those so-called console peasants wanting access to duped &amp; hacked items. Just a shame it comes with a hacked NW too.
---
You lucky
---
I really don't know, I'm still getting used to some things of the game, definitely i use the grocers backpack because i carry more food than chems and with that i reduce a lot. The armor that reduced it i got it recently, is an ss and i crafted it as an extra to have it with deep pocket, cos my other one is the jetpack that hurt my eyes lol. But I will totally check later if the weight change with both on and see if there's any difference
---
So much no idea that he muled the items since there was too much.
---
The kindest thing to say is that you're naive to think they didn't know upon finding it.
---
If I get a bounty, then I go on a lockpick spree, and see how high I can get it. My highest is 1240.
---
Does it work in order? I thought it might be random which item you get from it.
---
Yes
---
When used in vats all the pellets seem to hit on one location and although the visual damage numbers aren't dramatic the damage done will be.
---
sometimes one tap not works, dunno why?
---
No!
---
I like junkies for the balance between tankiness and damage. I made a new character after 2 bloodied builds and this one is so rewarding. In daily ops I can take so many hits just standing in front of the assaultron boss while my bloodied teammates are downed if they hop in the line of fire. The damage still isn't the same and I definitely miss the benefits of unyeilding armor but it's nice to not die almost ever. I don't use PA but I bet it would be awesome. Being able to revive the team and draw fire is nice. If someone doesn't like it, let them go play solo, you should do what you want and like!
---
Fallout 76 isn't a new game though...
---
I've just found one of the 2 deposits I was looking for from the map app. Reckon someone had collected the lead before I got there because I'd been over that patch of land a fair few times and nothing had popped up before 🤨 
---
Thank you for being helpful.
---
Done so many times I lost count now
---
Lucky Hole Mine and weights:   yes.      
---
However, it also seemed like I was awash in lead when I was completing the "kill X robots with Y weapon".  I don't know if that's feasible now, however, given the leveling with the last update.
---
I sometimes run 2 copies for muling, bought a 2nd account a long time ago when the stash limit was 400.  Maybe this [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cb43a7/guide_how_to_run_multiple_instances_of_76_on_a/) for the bethesda launcher helps you, no idea how it works with steam. If it is just for muling, I guess starting one version via steam and the other one via Beth launcher or using a shortcut to the exe would do.
---
You can trade the plan but you can not trade the jupsuit. If you try to drop it the item will be destroyed.
---
I do this, but I have both games directly on separate [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) accounts. I am logged in the launcher with my main account, and if I need to go on with the second one I just start Fallout76.exe and log in manually inside the game itself.
---
I don't know how this would work if you have the second copy through Steam.
---
Also, be aware that if you activate 2FA on the account you cannot log in directly inside the game - you have to start it through launcher. So then you would need a second PC or run the second instance in a virtual machine or something. In other words, you might not want to activate 2FA on the second account.
---
Yes, it should. But I guess it is considered explosive damage.
---
Lol don't forget 10 server hops to get 5 vault steel at a time just to craft full sets of ghoul/mutant slayers, nocturnal, exterminators...
---
If you're expecting a lot of damge jump into pa with emergency protocols
---
Cool happy to help, I've tried energy weapons but I always seem to end up going back to ballistic weapons, the Gauss shotgun is quite a lot fun at the moment though.
---
Happy hunting!
---
Great. Thanks for the info!
---
Level 24. I've spent majority of my caps on plans for camp, basic weapon plans and the rest on fast travelling to get myself signed up for the BoS and the Enclave. I had plenty of lead for my .308 but wanted to try out a laser rifle and quickly realised I wasted the lot. Lasers are not my friend
---
maybe go up to 39% life instead of 19%. the beauty of low life build is that you don't need to be very low to start to gain power up.
---
and how about getting some troubleshooter armor when you need to fight a lot of robots? This helps greatly.
---
You can sometimes set power armor inside or use a crafting station inside to break in without lock picking
---
I do this.  I open my mule account int he Beth launcher and my main account through steam.   When I have the two open I make sure one toon is looking at their map so my graphics card doesn't have to render both windows.   When I forget I can hear the fans on my graphics card speed up.  Just have the toon you are not actively controlling look at their map.
---
Yeah, that's how I do it and never had any problems.
---
Usually in a video game, if something is impossibly hard, this means you are doing something wrong.
---
Think that used to be the case but it doesn't happen in events anymore
---
I guess the problem here is, that everybody wants a bit help with the daily ops to complete the challenges, but is so annoyed by the daily ops that nobody is in the mood to do it more than once...?
---
Where is the rest of the comment to this?  ... what else?  What are they replacing MN with?  You guys are way too vauge about things and that erks me tell us whats up b4 hand not last minute.
---
As im camped up by vault 76 i usually sell my ammo I dont use for free so any new player can fill up before heading onto the overseers camp.
---
Is that a challenge for atoms? I rarely look at character, weekly and daily stuff. Every now and then I get some atoms or score without even realising I've done anything. Robots do seem to have lead now and then along with cells and steel.
---
I've found a lead deposit to camp on now, so I guess I'll have to start searching for acid a lot more now. One grind to another lol
---
I thought shooting a weapon was what fixed it? It might just be my imagination if that's the case.
---
A good start would be making 3\* enemies drop 3\* items more commonly, same goes for 2\* should be more likely to drop 2\* stuff.
---
We should be able to use legendary modules on any weapons if we know the plans as this would cut down the grind massively, after all the game should be fun, not a grindy wreck where you spend months at a time trying to get a god roll that can only be rolled at the Purveyor (like The Fixer or The Tenderizer).
---
Thank you.  I feel they should have had this discussion much soon then now.  Halloween is around the corner this last minite stuff will only end in poor results.
---
Yes, but actually no. Nuclear Winter is a rip off from Fortnite which in turn is a rip off from Call of Duty. That’s probably a rip off from something else. A battle royale is *nothing* like the PvP you get from Adventure Mode. You don’t have the opportunity to bring your own gear into a fight. NW is too RNG based for me. If I’m not lucky enough to get good gear, you can get your ass someone else will have that Marine armor, .50 cal and frog legs. You don’t get your own separate build for NW - if you want a certain build in NW, you’re not getting it unless you want to sacrifice your adventure mode build. Then there’s the lack of participation in NW. It’s trash, and the fact there’s never a full lobby despite a ten minute wait time reflects that it’s the public opinion too. Now, if we could convince Bethesda to bring back Survival mode, that would be a whole new kettle of fish. Matter of fact, if Survival was a thing again, I’d play that over Adventure because I want PvP.
---
I have a lead deposit now, thanks guys and girls for the extra grinding and looting tips.
---
Now to get back to camp building again lol
---
Every time my bloodied mule respawn, I will take any food first before I take toxic too to gain rad for nerd rage. It always work for me.
---
Not sure the cap, but its figured multiplitive so it has deminish returns. Tank killer doesnt work for heavy guns like the 50 cal, stabilized is their version of it. Stabilized + AA is a solid choice if you run PA.
---
Like they dont have sentinal armor all dmg avoiding perks and healing mutation . Like the 3 star will one shot them so they need to kill it fast af.
---
Also be aware in there most recent tos they made multi accounts a bannable offense
---
This is my planned character as of today:  
---
[Terminator build (20200925)](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f9f3536&amp;d=s32sr2s82ej4eo2ib4p02aa2ls2xq3pf0sf2x13x33sq2e00cg2p53lc2el2eb2&amp;w=il2l71au2e42e52&amp;m=e6i&amp;n=Terminator)  
---
It's  a *WIP* trying to balance playability and flavor. I'm particularly concerned about sicknesses... since [Uncle Bob](https://terminator.fandom.com/wiki/T-800_(T2)) doesn't get sick nor drinks nor eats, how do you emulate that? 
---
*Bloodsucker* is a good card, because it's somehow lore-friendly (terminators bathed in blood to restore their skins in the series *The Sarah Connor's Chronicles*) plus you can't get sick.
---
Then, there's **eating**: *Cannibal* is an option, because you can't get sick eating humanoid's corpses (oddly but luckily for this character)... **but a cyborg eating human-flesh**? I've never seen one (out of W40K) **plus** it wouldn't be a good infiltrator... (a scary one, definitively).   
---
On the other side, eating canned food could get me sick, it would mean the T-800 had some sort of stomach (which they don't) but I could justify *him* doing it because he wants to blend in with humans...
---
And there's the **sickness** associated with using some cards or others. If I take cannibal I can forget about getting sick for eating food and save some perk points and use them to prevent sickness from fighting enemies... but then how do I handle sickness from environments?   
---
I think *Natural resistance* would won over V*accinated* because I prefer my terminator quietly taking disease cures or antibiotics with his pipboy rather than carrying around a gas mask that anyone can see... If natural resistance prevented Ash Heap's airbone diseases, that is...
---
think this was effect was fixed last patch.
---
What you looking for is +33 VATS, +50% Limb damage or 40% Bash damage as modifier on your weapon.
---
Even though demolition expert doesn't seem to effect it. So it's its own thing all together
---
Same, map or even the pipboy interface does the trick for me too to switch to the other window just by moving the mouse and clicking once (2 monitors, mule running in windowed mode so I can drag it over to the 2nd)
---
That's why I don't bother swapping to melee, just bash them with the gun you're using 🙂
---
Hi Stupid!
---
Hmm. All is well on the Australian servers. Each one finishes about 10s after the timer starts.
---
This game is not capable of keeping up with they type of gameplay required to do the resilience ops properly. You need to be able to move like DOOM, but this combat system is janky, slow broken and horribly clunky.
---
that sad moment when the root vines is in the mothman bundle on the player built wall but you cannot build it yourself
---
Stealth is not supposed to work in Daily Ops, also I watched DTDGamers video about maxed out commando perk cards are only giving 7.5% extra damage for each perk card instead of the 20% that we supposed to be getting so I think all the perk cards needs to be fixed. I just wonder how long will it will take them to to fix.
---
Well it is just a reskin if a previous event so I guess they are not putting much effort into it.
---
I think critters might work.  Hit up meat week and kill some there.  They are limited to level 5.
---
How can it screw people over? The only variable is if you wish to turn in meat for scrip. Just do that ASAP. Otherwise, enjoy the same spoils as everyone else. No one gets left behind.
---
Go pay for Fo1st and play on your own server then. Or just skip the event if theres only one popping up, i mean it pops up every 5 minutes or so
---
They are doing just this. Not out of generosity but forward thinking. Anything to shift some renders for $$$
---
I've played where 3 pop up and i can manage to get at least 2 complete before the timer runs dry
---
Nope, ps4 but thanks anyway
---
I’m happy to pay full price as long as someone from Bethesda can personally supervise and de-clutter my constantly rammed stash box , despite having a scrap box as well .
---
Apparently I’m incapable of doing it myself.
---
I don’t think that’s too much to ask for £11 a month .
---
I’ve had this effect with a combat shotgun for several weeks and haven’t noticed a difference in the latest patch.
---
jump servers.
---
we nuke. regularly. 3 yesterday. and the most epic SBQ event yet. 27 minutes, ad spawns were just coming. think near everyone on server was there. 
---
Best part...no ass hat wearing jerks with magic weapons melting queen. Players knew the XP is in the minion spawns.
---
Never found there and I go for a check every day, I hop server a couple of time too
---
Use turrets sure but learn to love the atom prefab buildings these usually have decent sized interiors whilst taking almost zero budget (except the new bos bunker its huge outside and TINNNY interior)
---
I run a bloodied PvP tank. It works well with the right gear and setup.
---
Yeah, what do you want for it?
---
Aw, lazy people are downvoting you.
---
As many times as I've wished I could grow Cranberries or some other ingredient, having them all available at all times takes challenge from the game. If everything was easy we'd all get bored and probably go outside or exercise or do chores or some other horrible alternative.
---
Maybe there should be either a CAMP option or an NPC-run farmer's market (Meat and produce for sale, not perishable until purchased)? While it would make gathering stuff easier for the lazies, it would be balanced by having to spend caps for the meat and produce. (in a CAMP, of course, they'd have to be refrigerated or something so I guess you'd have to abide by market price dictated by Bethesda, otherwise people would use it for cheap perishable storage by having stupid high prices).
---
This
---
Annoying I know, but leaving the server and joining another should fix
---
I think it may be fixed.  My combat shotty has the right perk but my guass does not.  The former still wrecks stuff.  I have blocking on armour.
---
This was hard to read, Bloodied builds isnt that Great in PvP especially with the new damage calculation. For balancing Bethesda just needs to make some adjustments to pistol, rifleman and meele builds.
---
TBH, I'm not really sure.  Maybe someone else who does know can chime in.
---
I transferred a bloody exploding gastling plasma that way hehe. No sweat at all for just ammo and rafting supplies etc. the server stays open for five minutes after you leave it. Even if you accidently go to a public server first. You just log off fast and then to the right one.
---
Just another unfixed ignored bug they seemingly don't care about. I told a CM about this probably over a year ago now...
---
Are you drunk?
---
150 + stacks with 80 and then base doubles with super duper. Easy to get 1k of .50 cal ammo from one flux now,
---
Especially with the new Legendary Perk. Lead isn't too hard to get in large quantities (ironically the lead resource node is nice but you're going to be farming places like the Nuke Sites and VTU for dumbbells) and steel is literally in every weapon that drops (and is only a major concern if you use 2MM ammo).
---
You can also PA thru solid walls if you do it right no window required
---
I need more arcade stuff for my chuckie queens party palace. Though wouldnt be cool if they all shared a limit.
---
Using pvp as an example is pretty bad though. Damage is capped in pvp, not just bloody but other builds can easily reach the cap. Its not the bloodied bit that is op, they were probably using a fast firing weapon with a bit of aoe like a explosive effect. With enemies being more perceptive you'll fnd bloodied characters more on the floor.
---
&gt; The problem is that ... i got melted. 
---
Considering that Fo76 was conceptually a pure PvE game and PvP got added as a step child afterthought. You should rather call for PvP to get more balanced and cheat protected.
---
I got it first run.  But never got the tenderiser from meet week, done dozens of em.  RNG baby!
---
Poor babby
---
There are two npc raiders in my camp, I made a kind of steak house at their spot, so raider girl is cooking all day long and her raider boy fellow is keeping an eye on her and visitors. Also have Commander Foil and collectron, and I really enjoy when both travelling trader and Athena show up, and some players visit to check on my vending machines. That really makes me feel that I build some kind of hub where everyone can stay for rest, no matter of faction. I only wish Grahm could also visit me, but sadly my place is far from his route.
---
The first line is gibberish. What are you talking about? He got killed a few times because of a bug someone was exploiting and it's his fault? Yet again he only learnt about this bug after it happened a few times. It's not OP's fault the game doesn't work properly :') Is that too difficult to comprehend for you? lmao
---
Gauss minigun is a shredder. 
---
BUT
---
keeping it fed is a pain, and the wind up time is annoying
---
BE 50 is the gun you want.
---
Well it is a drop from many different events.I just looked it up and it says Antoine at legrande gourmet in whitesprings carries it.I remember now after reading that.Antoines recipes are not static he has different ones each time you go there.So I think if you server hop you should see it sooner or later.
---
So pretty much everything is bugged since this last patch.
---
I have a melee build but I still collect all ammo for this purpose
---
Because being level 3000 will make people think twice about attacking you.
---
That's something I'd do. Lol!
---
You don't need steam to run a second copy. Just a second license and a second beth-account.
---
Fuck. Teach me your ways.
---
Spell it with me-
---
T-R-O-U-B-L-E-S-H-O-O-T-E-R
---
I have killed off the assaultron by bashing it with my handmade while being shot at by 10+ other guards and numerous protections. 
---
Full set, whatever you can get your hands on. Swap it in, swap it out.
---
I think the additional percentage is increased off of the base weapon damage (IE DCG base damage is 68, +20% is only 13.6, so you get 13.6 damage added on)
---
I feel you bro
---
It means that an Instigating 33% vats gauss shotty will one-shot everything.
---
The one time I accidentally pressed level 40... Only unyielding piece I have on it
---
I believe angry turtle says up to level 2 is usefull while level 3 is overkill
---
As a stealth archer with literally negative strength I disagree
---
On the other hand stealth builds were so nerfed with the last update that I don't even care anymore :D
---
If you still have the tenderizer plan if not its all good,
---
You can probably check out if there are any other plans on me you want too
---
One per day: 1 module is 50, 5 steel is 50, server hop, other 50 steel.
---
Well to join the club do what every other club member did before you. Get grinding.
---
I prefer Chemist backpack over Grocers backpack because I use glowing blood for disease free rads management on my bloodied build (can get like 50 of those form single radiation ramble), would end up carrying like 50 kilos of those otherwise lol
---
Yep
---
Tenderizer plan, someone bought it for 13k caps in my vendor just 20 minutes ago... Tell me if you need something
---
Going on a personal biases here, but this is like a lose/lose situation... 
---
On one hand you got players who get burnt out easily and just shelf the game out of boredom because of how tedious and long it takes to get one armor set with no mods and want it to take less time to get armor sets with mods. 
---
On the other hand you got players that want the long grind just to have a reason to keep playing the game and not get bored but if they change it too where it takes less time to aquire armor sets and mods, Those players will get bored and shelf the game after getting everything.
---
Get rid of the turrets, that's at least 20% of your budget right there probably more. Honestly, you don't really need them. I've been playing 1000+ hours and never used camp turrets.
---
In theory maybe, it doesn't really work with such a common item
---
I'm sure when you get that bloodied swing speed it'll be a blast . Still waiting for the plan to drop on my melee character,  got it on my commando . Also still waiting for a legendary bear arm to drop I've had the plan learned for so long murmer don't like to share the good toys .
---
Whys it disappointing BTW.
---
Sacrifices must be made 🙌
---
Ever since I saw a kind stranger do that in an event I've done the same. I used to have to switch weapons because my 2H melee build would destroy them in one axe swing, but after the last patch I'm not so OP so it's easier to just tag the enemy and wait for others to do the same.
---
But then insult bot can’t come to your camp
---
I’m sorry it finished quickly and you got rewards for doing fuck all.
---
Ive got 3 War glave Plans.
---
In a row.
---
I feel you
---
This.  I don't even know how to modify my build now
---
I switch to one of my other 4 characters. They’re not mules so they don’t have that much extra. After purveyor events i sometimes need to drop a few though.
---
Side question before i invest in hack and slash, is the AOE damage pretty good?
---
i agree,however for the time they are affected by the legendary effect or your equipped weapon if you dont know that allready
---
That’s magic.  Note how crap it is out of vats.
---
Daily ops, but you need to be at least lvl 50 to get them, otherwise you just get random plans instead
---
We had that with Faschnat so your excuse is invalid.
---
Load into the game, open the menu through the map, then select "Change Appearance" and you can edit the character like you're creating a new one, except for the name.
---
It's basically an official version of the "showracemenu" command from Skyrim or Fallout 4.
---
Wasn’t an excuse, plus fasnacht didn’t finish in 5 seconds.
---
also 80% of existing mods for existing items are useless ...
---
Nerd Rage, Autostim armor, Sirindputy rank 3
---
Nah, its all good.
---
That's about the only thing I want.
---
b'coz of that, I avoid Swarm Mop PublicEvent for Legendary that only end up to make me upset, but if I do I aim for Exp only
---
So after patch 22 if I want Legendary I run to this event :
---
\- Daily-Op (1-3 Legendary star, StimPack, Ammo, Radaway)
---
\- Leader of the Pack (1 Legendary star x 3)
---
\- Riding Shotgun (1-3 Legendary star, chance Blue Ridge Caravan Stuff)
---
I think any weapon with those prefixes is gonna be better. It's very slow and the range is more limited than I thought a knife on a pole would/could be. The cryo may make it slightly better but if it takes god rolls and specialised perks to make it even viable then I'll keep using a damp stick of celery instead.
---
It's just meh. Really.
---
Dtdgamer cant do math correctly in that video. Plenty of us corrected his math. Commando perks are working as intended. They each give 20% boost to base weapon damage for 3 ranks.
---
This. This so much.
---
It's cool and all that we get new stuff now and then.
---
But I'd much rather get better upgrades for stuff we already have.
---
I don't want ANOTHER weapon as good as the Fixer, I want to make the older stuff as good as the Fixer.
---
If we have Prime Receivers as a base game end goal, add equally powerful Barrels or Magazines or Stocks as a grind in new content.
---
Give base melee weapons the insane Elemental upgrade options that the War Glaive has.
---
Give Armor and Power Armor new mods too! Nothing that breaks them, but just new effects. Fun stuff. Stuff where you really have to decide between what mod is most worth it to equip.
---
Alight, I get that it was a typo but when you said RAFTING supplies you had me all fucking STOKED for about half a second....
---
The melee thing seems to have come back with the last patch for me.  Took constant melee damage with nothing around the first day of daily ops.  Haven't had it happen again since though.
---
Yes, and they are sure to ban people who play from same IP like family members. Think before you post.
---
Nope
---
^^ This.
---
The challenging aspect of a challenge shouldn't come from the jankiness of the game lol. If hits connected like they should this challenge would be nothing.
---
Only thing i gotta grind is the days, i have more than enough notes to get almost all the plans
---
Well how melee is at the moment god rolls are the only way to go , war glaive ill see you.. never probably .
---
If you die in a fissure site and leg it to it after you spawn, you can run around the green under the insta death zone, and get your loot back
---
I did think i thought ppl should know what was in the terms they signed without looking most likely now kindly go walk off a short pier
---
A fool and his money are easily parted I guess.
---
Ha, sorry for turning that legendary scorchbeast into goop
---
It is definitely a tricky thing to make the character as realistic to a terminator as possible.Fallout at least in 3 and 4 have the 3rd generation synths which are very much like a terminator.In fact they were probably loosely based off of the terminator.When they teleport in they even have a electrical effect that goes off.I believe they can do most things humans can though to blend in.Things like eating and drinking etc or at least they can feign like they are.
---
They are going to be changing the mechanic for thirst and hunger in the game in a future update.You will no longer suffer the negative effects from not eating or drinking.So that would not be a problem when that happens.You can still eat and drink to gain the buffs from it though if you want.If you did not eat or drink that could eliminate some of those perks needing to be taken.
---
As far as disease goes that one will probably not be fool proof.Without a suit of any kind you would still have some chance to get diseases from the environment and creatures.Depending what you want to wear you could have the suit hidden under a out fit.The marine wetsuit is a under armor and protects from environmental hazards.You could still get them from the air though with no helmet.
---
So I do not think you will be able to get around the environmental without headgear and a suit and there would always be a chance to get something from enemies.
---
Camo isn't much fun for my vats build.
---
Can we also talk about the legendary perk card that makes enemies explode? the range on the explosion is huge, doesn't hurt the one shooting, but triggers pvp on other players
---
I’ve never seen a Meat Six-Days take less than three minutes
---
You can't reduce weight of items in this game less than 10% of the original value. Ammo can't be weightless
---
So we’re on the same page then, thanks.
---
Some of us build atypical camps that don’t work with an underground vault door. Can’t imagine exactly incorporate an underground bunker into my pirate ship that is floating on a lake.
---
Wait what free content? The atoms? Rarely get anything in the FO1st tab in the atom shop.
---
Yeep, if it's ever tradable you can have mine... and then give it away again haha
---
Hahah np, I tried to find it using the camera but it was under the ground
---
Yes, put it down. I am on european time, so I'll be online in 9 hours, which is 2100 local time. Which level are you currently?
---
I’ve had Faschnat finish in 9 minutes before though. Using the PA shield people kept moaning about, because you can’t stop the parade master. So when the parade master got to a certain point in his circuit, the others would just turn back and go the way they came. Foolproof.
---
Bandanas are still pretty badass IMO
---
Loutvig - i'm not sure if ill be online by that time tonight, but we'll see! 15 currently.
---
Yea, you are just jealous because you can't use several accounts at the same time on your crappy console. And then come here trying to scare people about things that will never happen. 
---
 \* slow clap \*
---
5mm is easy to make and find.... 308 though is horrible.
---
Used to craft 40k plus 5.56 and 2 k shotgun shells every week.
---
You on PC? i can give you like 100 i got from doing meat week
---
A lot of them are to be used as you progress, but only a handful are used in the endgame, need more fun endgame mods
---
Reactive plates on PA torso and vampire weapons (Gat Gun, .50 cal, Flamer) is what i use in events. I might not 1 shot the boss but i keep its attention. Tanking 20 minions in ACP is no problem. I have probably died 3 times in 100+ runs.
---
Problem is  that particular quest requires you kill a variety of types of enemies iirc.
---
Yeah. It seems pretty equal to the damage I do with my weapon.
---
In whitesprings on the lower floor whenever it proccs everything in the room dies. Exploding palm does 20% of your damage so basically the explosive legendary effect and is buffed by demolition expert up to 32%. So an extra third damage.
---
Hack and Slash is probably the most useful melee perk because it's basically hitting multiple enemies with melee. I think things further away take less but I'm not sure. It just seems that way because when I hit the ghouls some that survive have about half their health. Not as much as I do to the enemy I hit directly but the game never mentions drop off. Then again the issue with hitting and they take no damage is also still a thing so maybe it's just a calculation issue
---
I think you may be right. From the limited playtest I've just carried out I tried a B/E/15 combat shotgun and a Berserkers/250DWRL/40Bash double-barrell and the Berserkers was one shotting everything - two shots at most whilst the B/E/15 was significantly underperforming in comparison.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'll try to carry out some more detailed analysis as I hope the patch isn't fixed. Typical if I finally get that role from Mumbles and it's no longer magic!
---
Yeah. Part of me feels cheap for charging 2 caps per 2mm EC, the other part of me thinks 2 caps is still underpriced.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Recruitment\_Blues](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Recruitment_Blues)
---
An extra 3-4 shots doesn’t seem like much with one enemy, but when you have to constantly farm for materials because your weapons are degrading or breaking faster is significant for a low level casual such as myself. Never enough materials at camp to do workbench repairs. Which means forcing me to play stealth or abandon objectives in order to spare my weapons and armor. Repair kits are a bad joke
---
High health vanguard build with explosive AA commando, 50drwa does pretty well. I think the 50drwa is key to getting near enougg under fire for the meele finish
---
Also, you can rename your armor pieces for better sorting. Mine all start with AA, and then the piece name (e.g. "RL" for right leg). That way you can just select the top items in your apparel tab.
---
And for some reason we can’t put wallpaper on walls with windows 😒
---
How do you take cover when every single enemy in this game can just shoot right through cover? Hmm? Oh yeah, that's right, you don't. Because EVERY SINGLE ENEMY IN THIA GAME CAN SHOOT THROUGH COVER!
---
Demo works with gauss (or did last week). You will see if you equip.
---
I originally thought that they were cloaked, but I then realised it was long range melee attacks?
---
This is awesome!
---
Whenever my character does the fuk off grunt of you cannot fast travel that’s the first thing I check
---
robots are good for ammo farming . they spawn mabye 3 times more than everything else.
---
I have/had all of that and it's still not great. I switched from shadowed to polymer for extra resistance and it's about the same.
---
Even with 15 agi, bird bones, escape artist, and Chinese stealth armor, I was staying in danger after running away. Had to pop a phantom device.
---
I switch out my cards and armor for OPs so that's not it.
---
Seems like stealth just got nerfed, or enemy perception got buffs.
---
The .44 should be a magnum and do hellacious damage, maybe at a short distance you know,  like the real ones.
---
also show plans (known) and unknown. hate seeing 153 different mounted head plans for 250 caps each
---
I think they are long guns only not pistols
---
At my vendor ammo is 1 cap each no matter what...
---
I hate greedy people who want +1 cap per bullet too. 
---
Greed, greed never changes!
---
Oh, all three of the new displays? But why? And why am I able to display my baseball bat then? Such a pity :(. Thanks for replying though!
---
I’m also experiencing we’re radrats etc are much harder to kill than super mutants etc. 
---
In fact most of the insects and animals are much tougher since the latest patch?
---
Can you provide more details? Are you firing from the hip, down sights, or in VATs? Is every shot fully charged? Does it happen on all enemies? Where are you targeting?
---
Bethesda employees need to be able to reproduce a bug in order to fix it.
---
Looking at the build you have there I can see some things to comment on.You might want to switch out bullet shield for blocker.Reducing melee by 45 percent is really helpful.Concentrated fire might not be a great pick because heavy guns are very taxing in vats.If you are going to be solo often you should get at least 4 charisma and get lonewanderer it really helps.In intelligence if you have no gunsmith you are going to have to repair your heavy guns all the time.Then in luck you might want to think about mutations.Many of those make your character superhuman.You would just have to role play that they were from being a cybernetic organism rather that a mutated human.If you did then you would want enough much to have starched genes and possibly class freak.
---
Yeap but my bloodied commando is kinda handicapped against a robot horde unless you go for large mag and quick hands perk. Which in my case I’m unable to do so because I need serendipity and ricochet. 
---
I just can’t solo kill them fast enough before they swarm me.
---
Earle will squish me like a bug at this point. Lol - so sorry I wont get to team up with you online, that was really nice of you to offer.
---
I'll watch for those Daily Ops, thank you for the advice.
---
Damn. Thx for sharing.
---
I only charge for 5.56 and 45 because those sell (1c each ofc) if anyone comes to my camp looking for 38, 44, 10mm, shotgun cells, arrows etc they can just have them for free
---
Are you using a wet noodle?
---
Something is off with your damage,  full life build, AA 10mm pistol here. Sneaky headshot mutuies for about 175, like 250 ish once follow through kicks in, and crit for like 350ish -400.
---
I’m no fan of PVP, but it’s a circular argument to say that it never worked in FO76 because it just wasn’t that popular. The reason it wasn’t popular was because it was half-assed and ill thought through, resulting in a compromise that didn’t satisfy PVPers and only served to annoy PVEers. You can’t launch without any kind of faction system and say PVP was given a fair chance. No risk VS reward mechanic when all you lost was junk. Players were never given a reason *to* PVP. It was sidelined and allowed to wither on the vine. 
---
Survival, similarly, failed because its goals were confused. People wanted adventure mode but with the potential to PVP. Bethesda put a scoreboard in, which forever threatened to stick a big neon arrow above your head for everyone to hunt you down. There were repeated calls to get rid of that scoreboard. All ignored. People wanted to hunt each other by hearing gunfire in the distance and investigating it, which would give silenced weapons real utility. Bethesda thought they wanted battle royale. No attempts to tweak it and a big ‘oh well!’ when player numbers dwindled enough to justify killing the mode. Once again, it was allowed to wither on the vine.
---
.38 are free. 
---
5.56 are 2 caps (because I use lots of them myself.) 
---
All other ammo for regular rifles and handguns is 1 cap. 
---
(I also stock fuel, as it sells really quickly. Weird.)
---
Don't understand the downvotes, this is what was said.
---
It is any type of shooting. Hip, vats, crouched, sighted, you name it. Sometimes I hold a shot for 30 seconds and when I release it it just does nothing
---
If you max out the legendary perk card “Ammo Factory” it gives you 150% of base crafting. If you stack it with Ammosmith and Super Duper you have a 60% chance to craft 360% of base ammo per batch. Between the ammo machine from the raiders and daily ops I haven’t crafted ammo for my main gun since before the patch. I just craft ultracite ammo for my prime weapons and I have the Ammo Factory perk at rank 3 which gives 100% more than base. Stacking it with the other two regular perk cards I’m swimming in ammo. I use ultracite plasma cores and with my perk set up one craft using two regular plasma cores makes 7 ultracite plasma cores. The other day I crafted 3 times and ended up with 28 ultracite cores because Super Duper kicked in too.
---
Higher level enemies will have higher perception so I would assume it would be the reason why.
---
Game can only support so many enemies. It doesn't just infinitely spawn them. 
---
I used a vamp shotgun. Also line of sighted them where possible. Any damage they did was healed by vamps. I think any vamps weapon would do. I dont think the regen is tied to your damage. So something fast firing with 90% rw should do. May need to test this tbh. But it makes sense and it says regen when an enemy is hit.
---
I died once at end when I was using my main on the boss. I got that bug where I could use a stim and by time I put away my gun I got downed.
---
So you can stand in one place, fire at nothing, and this will happen? What’s mods are on the gun and are there any legendary effects?
---
Exactly.They just can’t or won’t produce enough fresh content on a regular basis to keep everyone from getting bored.So you end up with a percentage of players getting bored with the mechanic you have in place.
---
Get a mule with full weapon wight armour.  Add every perk you can to reduce carry weight, then max the weight.  Now open your inventory. That's why it will never happen, the 30 seconds of lag, or 2 minutes just to see the legendary perks on stuff
---
The quest kill detector is really slow, you can get the kill with another weapon and quickly switch to the sword and it counts.
---
I have lost kills accidentally by switching away from the sword after a kill as well.
---
At this point I would also ask them to put water (purified, dirty, and boiled) into its own category. 
---
I don't want to buy 50 purified water for 30 caps each. Nobody does.
---
The other night I was the only one that showed up for the event, so I tried to solo it, but it seems impossible to do.
---
Fair enough, that's why I use UC .308 on my long.  Inherently more produced per craft so I can make a ton.
---
I didn’t notice any changes last night.
---
My hope is that one day they will separate the clothing from the armor, it just makes sense..  don't lump something cosmetic in with something useful... I have soooo many outfits and hats and things in my stash that I have a hard time finding a piece of armor if I stash it by accident!
---
I'm actually actively looking for 40mm, and I've seen people selling it for 2-15 caps a piece. I've never been so disappointed
---
I recently did this quest on a new alt and I couldn't get rabbits and squirrels to count after I killed a mole rat.
---
Oh, that didn't occur to me. Makes sense.
---
I want earl as a pet or nothing...
---
Dogmeat i have in real life... gimme a break! (Yes my dog is called Dogmeat and hes a german shepherd).
---
I already kicked a few people from my team in the past few days because they didn't at least show up before the boss fight got started.
---
Yeah the perk isn't worth the points atm and having it count as melee damage would at least give it a situational use.
---
if you keep walking forward it takes 0,5 second to clip through an enemy
---
Now I want to build a base by vault 76
---
On one of my chars I have a full set of Troubleshooter's BOS Heavy Combat Armor sitting in my stash, and yes I am (or was) pretty much invincible in it.
---
But here's my issue with that ....
---
I loose the benefits I get from my Unyeilding armor, most noticeably Strength. This means I need to do some jiggery pokery with my perks in order to just be able to move to my stash so I can dump some stuff (which I can't because my stash is currently full of legendaries because I can only scrip 3 a day). 
---
PITA
---
But that aside, unfortunately I've scrapped most of the perks I don't use regularly in order to get some legendary perks, which basically means I can't really change up my build anyway. 
---
Given that the Resilient Daily Op is the one, and only, instance in the entire game where my survivability and effectiveness drops dramatically ...  meh, I'll just live without  it. At least until I can fix my broken full health tank alt.
---
Lol at the Bethesda employees alt accounts suggesting to just take cover when every enemy in this game can shoot right through cover
---
Im sure there will be new prizes to earn.  We will see.
---
Nice, does daily ops give 4-8-12-16 ammo for  308 ultracite too?
---
I still feel like I am getting the same amount
---
it's funny I full my punch bowl with nothing but normal alcohol and no one ever drinks it, guess everyone just thinks it's 10/10 nukashine
---
&gt; It is definitely a tricky thing to make the character as realistic to a terminator as possible. 
---
Yeah, but it's fun. :-P
---
&gt; They are going to be changing the mechanic for thirst and hunger in the game in a future update.You will no longer suffer the negative effects from not eating or drinking. 
---
That's good news for my T-800 and bad news for people who love RPG mechanics (like me).  
---
I hope they do something like "hardcore mode" in New Vegas, where you could toggle it ON/OFF... but if you *don't have to eat* doesn't make sense to me that you benefit from the buffs. It should be a "yes/no" thing to incentivize players to use it. I hate it when they make things are too easy.  
---
&gt; Depending what you want to wear you could have the suit hidden under a out fit. 
---
Obviously, he's wearing *greaser jacket and jeans*, which is closest outfit  to the movies.
---
&gt; So I do not think you will be able to get around the environmental without headgear and a suit and there would always be a chance to get something from enemies. 
---
According to the 1st answer "Natural resistance" doesn't prevent you from taking a disease... So, I'll go for vaccinated and when I have enough points to spare (that is when the build is mature enough) I'll try "Natural resistance" myself.
---
There are new rewards. If you’ve read my other comment I said that the new rewards have been on the market sub for a while now. So that’s definitely confirmed.
---
you need to adapt yourself
---
Have you experienced the bug where they all explode every damn time?
---
That one is fun.
---
PVE, I think you mean PVP, otherwise you just hate the game.... :-)
---
oh i see, thank you for responding so fast. I guess weapons that use 308 ammo get less ammo than flamethrowers
---
Try Approaching from the western side and take the picture from the top of the cliff.
---
thank you for responding so fast, whats the amount of ammo you get on 308 ammo?
---
I'm on XB.
---
You can have one, I think I have 9-10 now.
---
True. That's what I'm using right now (my CAMP is in an appropriate *Terminator-like* region: Ash Heap).  
---
Nevertheless, why would a T-800 use it? To hide his damaged face like it uses sunglasses?... 
---
eerrrr... maybe...
---
I didnt see that sorry.  What are the new rewards?
---
Who tf brings junk to an event?
---
It reminds me of the time when you accidentally shot a robot in whitespring and they spawned indefinitely...
---
Same
---
And after the sale even my main and other alts are over loaded with legendaries now too
---
For everything I seem to get between 6-16.
---
at least name of the perk is correct...
---
You're telling me this now??? I had 2 V E shotgun the entire time and didn't know what to do with them...
---
Excellent. Powerarmor and decent body-armor will be a start. Level 15 is where it begins
---
I don't see yhe issue here? So what if someone follows you?
---
*tips X-01 helmet* "Member"
---
It's-a me!! Haha yeah I sell all my unwanted ammo for 1 cap, I don't care what it is.  I also regularly put all my basic scrap up for 1 cap each as well - steel, cloth, leather, rubber, etc. The way I figure it, I'm happy with my gear and how my camp looks right now so I can just vendor my scrap for a while and make a few caps!
---
Thanks! ❤
---
im guessing it is by type of ammo. normally .308 is used in slower firing guns, so you get less back. while 5MM is the base default for the minigun, and thus you get more back. .50 cal seems a bit weird though. it barely gives me any ammo but it fires fast
---
Everything is higher level now.  At least for me things seem like they are taking longer to kill mainly because hits don't register correct if I fire to quickly.  I always need to stop myself and slow down my fire rate because I will notice that I'm wasting my ammo for no reason in vats.  Sort of frustrating, seems much better if aiming down sights though.
---
It's annoying.  Its why I got private.  Say hi. Use manors.  Ask questions. Get better. Don't be a sheep, be more dog.

It does exactly thatconjures up a magic chem that fills food &amp; water, heals a bit, cures any disease. It is single best legendary perk.
---
They are meant to be grinder over weeks / months thru rng. You gotta do the ops for the season daily anyway, plus it's EXP and an ammo farm, it's honestly not bad just be patient.
---
I’ve recently noticed that sometimes when you attack one of the farmhands or protectrons, they now make a whirling noise which becomes louder before they explode. Just make sure you move out of the way.
---
Stealth didn't get nerfed per se. Thanks to WO, all enemies now have a higher level, that includes their perception. So sneaking is less effective the higher their level.
---
I run a gauss pistol and it seems better, but not great. Still missing a lot of 95 (even with 33 VATS accuracy effect) but not as many before patch.
---
And I'm winging a good number of 10% or less shots at distance. 
---
Makes no sense.
---
I would not mind the clothing being under Misc in the shop symbol. I have a toon that is a clothing vendor and I do look for high numbers of armour in the shop symbol. it usually, but not always, means there will be some outfits. on the negative side I am sorry if you travel to my camp only to find my 50+ armour is clothing. I seldom sell weapons or Armour but I do sell 90% of the ammo so I hope you find something to make it worth your while.
---
Yes. I followed a few 200s around dong events and I leveled to much and now all my gear is useless again.
---
I'll take another look. I swear I'm too pissed at this I'm hardly using it anymore. I joined an early flight and it was truly a nightmare. Even needs more than a clip to kill the small spawns wendigos.
---
I have an aa2525 M2525, J25 and JE and honest too good all those 10mm are just crap now. I still need to test how badly hurt was my hybrid build with my BE15r bolt action pipe rifle which I used with gunslinger and rifleman perks
---
I can only get a guaranteed vats bit by first targeting an enemy in vats, backing out and retargeting, there’s def something broken
---
As HW user I find the flamer is helpful.
---
It gets me close so I don't need to sprint to get into weapon bash range. This seems to help reduce the chance my bash doesn't register as I'm less likely to move through their model.
---
same goes for thrown melee weapons like the throwing knife, i'd carry a few just for those resilient buggers
---
I've never seen anyone say that bloodied builds are tanky. You can have some decent dmg resistance with a full Bolstering SS armor but its not really tanky.
---
Be dog? Those things blindly do the thing you hate: follow.
---
Fair call, I don't bother with stealth boys and just use my furious 25 faster fire rate .50cal in power armour and will usually kill people unless they use a legacy or some ridiculous build
---
And I love it for ammo farming! Best is exploding bots in vault 94 they funnel in through the door on the left mostly and easy kill easy ammo.
---
This was me for a long long time, but I changed it because I found DPS more useful solo. 
---
Now with public teams I'm trying to change back, but need to level up more so I can respec back to what I was.
---
It’s hardly ridiculous if you’re not a bullet sponge. Run Emergency Protocols.
---
I’m just starting a new character which’s now at 27.
---
Everything is now scaled to my level, but it’s strange why radrats are so tough and at close range. 
---
Even the ticks were causing me problems. 
---
This can be off putting for beginners?
---
Players have gathered? They are ready to go and start the timer. You don't seem to get the mechanics of the event require no other "terms of agreement" than to be there. Do you start the event and then decide to do perk management? Why? Are you going to repair your armor and weapons now? Scrap your junk? Don't you have a camp for that? 
---
In other words, we are ready to start because we are here, with you. I am ready because I am here. That's my way of indicating. 
---
If you want to get together to do something else, please don't start a Daily Ops team. There are better places to hang out. The faster people learn that, the smoother things will go.
---
i wouldnt expect a fix anytime soon, 
---
the gaussrifle was in the game since launch and there are complaints about the bug constantly but nothing was done yet
---
i think at one point bethesda said they going to fix the problem in a patch (soon after wastelanders came out) but nothing happened and i havent seen any more mentions of the topic
---
my guess is that bethesda found out that fixing this bug is harder than they thought and evaluated that its too much effort for only a few weapons
---
i have a nuka-cola machine, punch bowl and 4 different kegs full of shine and i regret nothing
---
They take less time and effort than a lot of events, too. Other than the end, you can basically ignore the enemies and just tank while you sprint between up links.
---
I run full health and spam stims cause I can afford to
---
I would settle for some new skins for the 50cal and lmg
---
Still run EP for when there’s that one dude who tanks you long enough to cut your health to 20%.
---
Yeah, pretty much. First guy took it too seriously and it went down from there.
---
I am actually willing to make it if you want it tho. PS4
---
I don't have room for it in my camp. Lol
---
you need to realize most people who have max damage builds only carry one weapon and the idea of being forced to carry a second is insane
---
\*\*stabs something with a vampire faster swing speed 90% weight reduction combat knife\*\* 
---
I don't have anything wrong with this mission
---
Lol, a sheepdog HELPS heard the sheep.  Communicates.  Learns.  Hell even gets treats.  Sheep walk round eating the grass they can get. That's my point.
---
as someone who's guzzled a dozen nuka-shine for the lols, i can say you don't teleport just the once, spent half an hour of load screens just bouncing across the map.
---
Just know it happens as much as he says it does as he says it does. Not only him. Used one for awhile. Tragic stuff.
---
Is ninja even worth having anymore ?
---
Yeah I agree with you but that novel you wrote was too much to read.  😂😂😂
---
Ditto. Tried to solo it. I did it but died about 20 times and it took almost 30 minutes. Would have been a lot less if when I bashed something it actually landed instead of having to do it three or four times.
---
It weighs, but there are not enough decimals to show it on screen. Once you hoard enough, you notice it.
---
It took weeks for me to get rid of my extras priced at 15 caps.
---
Hey I kinda suck at math lol but 30k x .003 = 90 weight, 90% less and you picked up 9 exactly like your pipboy is showing right??
---
LOL! Probably the person deleted the character and started all over 😂
---
It’s so frustrating, especially considering 4 out of the 6 new ranged weapons added in wastelanders are effected by this bug.
---
The benefits from food are such that many are going to prefer to eat for benefits and bonuses.
---
I have one alt I like to think of as a "no resources needed" kind of character and that's the only one I'm even remotely considering for this perk...and right now I still don't have it worked into the plan.
---
That's great to hear :) glad they took care of you
---
I saw train, expected something about the train set from the current season. Thought about the idea of the train set causing damage. There was intrigue, now only thoughts of liberty prime riding a train into combat. 
---
"Liberty Train online"
---
"Steam: hot"
---
"Coal: black"
---
"Pistons: primed"
---
"All systems nominal"
---
"Red Chinese threat detected"
---
*toot toot*
---
oh I was refeering to the final reward. where you get like 200 or so
---
Funny, i have max bargain, and I’m selling most of the guns I find but damn caps are slow to come by. 10 here and 12 there and maybe 15 for this.
---
that makes a lot of sense
---
We do need those sheepdogs to get that sheepsquatch. I'll take my nap meanwhile and don't give a fuck. Maybe after that I'll play with a ball of yarn.
---
95% of the pvp in this game is people acting in bad faith.
---
It blows my mind the prices I see those stupid mounted plans for. I price all my plans at 10% of Beth’s suggested prices. So the mounted plans were 15 caps. Couldn’t sell them. I just dumped them in train station lockers and noob camps. The only plans like that that I will try to sell are the two gorilla, the icicle lights, and the Santa crash. And they still don’t move fast.
---
I've admittedly been the asshole, but only once when I realized what I did and why it was bad. I didn't know at the time that as long as everyone gets a shot on a legendary, that everyone will get a weapon. I thought I was helping to kill a tough enemy.
---
All automatic rifles are slower than they were in Fallout 4. It doesn't even make sense. They shoot so slowly now that it just feels weird.
---
In generell it only works when you unequip the Futur Tec Camp device skin from the last season in the Atom shop and the move your camp. Had this problem 2 days ago and changed my ally round about 50 times. Only the camp move works. For me at least.
---
To be fair meat week does lead to a little bit of a weight problem for most players. If you don't have 1st it doesn't take very long to go from tons of space available to totally overweight after just a few events.
---
YES
---
You can get around this by placing the actual stairs last.
---
Yeah.
---
This is true for highest level players but anyone below 50 (or maybe 100) won't be able to max out these kind 308 is still a relative pain to craft [comparedto how much the LMG spits out])

Are you on xbox? I got a Vats build I just put high health with furious stuff, it great!! I'm a bit lost on the new perks too, got agility, luck, intelligentce, then follow through and the sneak range one on that one
---
&gt; Looking at the build you have there I can see some things to comment on 
---
**Thanks, I greatly appreciate it.**
---
&gt; You might want to switch out bullet shield for blocker.Reducing melee by 45 percent is really helpful. 
---
Is it worth exchanging resistance towards all attacks (specially ranged) for 45% melee damage denial? 
---
&gt; Concentrated fire might not be a great pick because heavy guns are very taxing in vats. 
---
Yup, it thought about it for some time... I use it because VATS gives the impression of a Terminator's targeting interface, maybe I could save those points for something else but nothing interesting came up... maybe a few points in mysterious savior (you know: reboot and all that).
---
Now that you mention it... I don't need *Concentrated fire* to have the Terminator-like interface, without it I just want be able to target limbs... and maybe I could use those points somewhere else... Thanks, I'll give it some though!
---
&gt; If you are going to be solo often you should get at least 4 charisma and get lonewanderer it really helps. 
---
I usually play with my wife or in groups.
---
I know, I know... Arnie didn't but IMHO this game makes little sense and it's less fun when playing solo... all points towards this (events, benefits... everything).
---
&gt; In intelligence if you have no gunsmith you are going to have to repair your heavy guns all the time 
---
I'll keep it mind. The T-800 isn't particularly smart (on human standards) and so far I haven't had to spend a lot fixing my weapons. All my resources go to fixing my armor... speaking of which, I might be dropping *Moving target* for *White knight* as soon as *Heavy gunner* and *Ironclad* are maxed out. After swapping melee for heavy guns I'm not running at all so it's a waste perk points.
---
&gt; Then in luck you might want to think about mutations.Many of those make your character superhuman.You would just have to role play that they were from being a cybernetic organism rather that a mutated human.If you did then you would want enough much to have starched genes and possibly class freak. 
---
Good idea there... actually, I've looked into it and you can find the mutations I selected in the build: *Scaly Skin, Electrically charged* and *unstable isotope*  
---
I hope to be able to avoid using Radaway with the *What Rads?* Legendary perk, so I won't need *Starched genes*... Dunno how am I going to manage to remove a new mutation without removing the ones I like... I guess I'll have to use serums. *Class freak* on the other hand could prove very interesting. **Thanks**!
---
Yesterday I put my guns away and just started meleeing everything with my spiked ski sword. Instead of an entire clip of ammo gone I just chop up robots in 7 hits.
---
Once you get all the rewards earle is not worth it. I only nuke the queen now again, and everyone else does the same apparently.. more xp, more legendaries, flux and repair kits
---
Every day I'm on bottle shorter. Don't trust strange vending machines and bowls, at least, not until Halloween
---
Well i sold all my masks and fasnacht plans for 450 each. You just need to find the right id-... i mean buyer, i suppose.
---
That on the test servers there will be no material requirements. It was in the very same paragraph.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/QVtYt70.png](https://i.imgur.com/QVtYt70.png) that's a picture of it. It happened before I put the mods on it too.
---
Maybe Bethesda should simply display the accumulated weight per stack in addition to the weight of a single round, for all items that can be stacked.
---
I live in my power armour and run reactive plating cause melee hits are constant
---
How tf you got so much ammo?
---
May rethink the timing on taking that photo?
---
Now that is funny. 😂
---
only if it makes honey, honeycomb and wax
---
as i said a few days ago: mount a BAYONETT on your gun if possible. you only need one bash to kill after you have shot their health down. normal weapon bash will do, too, of course.
---
and, regarding to our yesterday run: one shooter, one melee. works like a charme.
---
Because it’s content that isnt going away. People would also complain if it was too easy and they kept getting the same rewards.
---
I mean, it's better than every energy weapon. I have a similar amount of fusion cells and only 10,000 plasma cartridges and it weighs over 50lbs with the weight reduction. And then there's the fusion cores... 😆
---
I find EP to be significantly more effective. Although I have a question - does a reflected melee attack from Reactive Plates kill the resilient cunts in the ops?
---
I don't, I can do all the prime events solo.  The project paradise one I need help with, or the event fails before I kill it
---
My audio is fine?
---
Oh I have no idea. Again yesterday is a weird one with the melee mutation. Not sure if that affects that calc or not
---
Had to laugh, thanks for the comment :D Wait until the Mirelurk King is 3\* That will be tough
---
I'll have to look, my gamertag is Bluedreamer720
---
i agree, expecially the bow seems to perform so poorly, the gauss weapons at least are decent if you use them with free aim 
---
but as i said, these smaller quirks weapons have seem to get overlooked
---
i had hopes that the weapon balance changes would mean bethesda looks at all the critique for different weapons and make them more usefull
---
durability for energy weapons, base damage for pistols, durability for explosive weapons etc
---
but after two years im not sure if they ever going to change things
---
I’m a Bloodied Pa/Hg tank build
---
Why? Its the law of the waste land. You die, I'll take your shit.
---
No.  If someone tries to kill me and I fight back and win, I deserve that duct tape and 2 pots they were carrying.  If they wanted to keep it safe then they shouldn’t have started a war with me.
---
A dead person doesn't need their stuff
---
Indeed I love my vampire deathclaw gauntlet, faster swing speed and 90% reduced weight. I used it exclusively in the daily op on Thursday. Also I’ve named it “Vald the Impaler”
---
The residual heat produced by laser guns requires you to be naked for them to function at peak operability.
---
I get these stats on stuff far too regularly but I script it all just to make sure I dont contribute to the buggy shit storm that is FO76.
---
Yes. We had them stacked like cord wood waiting for the uplink to finish.
---
This meat week definitely has less people that seem to know what to do. I can't tell you how many times I've seen six people running around trying to kill Critters and passing up all the rotting piles and greens. My standard now is to start on drums,  jump off just as the event starts, run around and grab all the greens while cleaning up the rotting piles on the way. I turn in the greens, I turn in any prime meat I have, I turned in wood, and then back on drums AFK until it's done. 
---
And unfortunately post like this will fall on mostly deaf ears as a lot of those people don't go on Reddit.
---
Your armor is fine. Are you using asbestos mod in torso? What is your poison resistance? Are you full health or are you running the low health perks and hoping the vampire carries you?
---
I've tried pain train with melee equiped and it doesn't work. I tried finishing them off with throwing weapons and grenades aswell while holding a melee and no joy either.
---
I think it still works for challenges like you said, but they've altered it for daily ops for some reason.
---
And we don’t have the ability to hang a chandelier type ceiling light on a pitched roof piece.
---
Um....you can do something about it. Stash it
---
I guess you're right but then that makes me feel even worse about it because then it's going to be mostly lower-ish level players getting kinda ripped off on ammo prices. People who might not have a lot of caps or a good method to earn them.
---
After a certain point you just start trading legendary items for ammo, because the ammo is more valuable :-)
---
I don't think so, I'll check
---
on what platform are you?, i might be able to help
---
I've been selling more 5.56, .50 and .45 than ever. 
---
I can't make enough of it.
---
Ultracite guns are only good against scorched and trash against everything else, your armour stats are fine, maybe its your special layout
---
I usually launch at least one nuke a day. Currently I start it right after a meatweek event.
---
I've just decided to start collecting Toxic water from the Crater (Raider area)
---
The water right next to where you get the two dailies, it's just as good imo (30 rads a tick, fills the water bar)
---
Why would someone spam SBs &amp; quantums just to "griefc? That's super unnecessary. lol I do that naked with stock weapons or on baby levels.
---
I have 50 poison resistance , is that important? And yes I'm using abestos mod , but the most annoying thing is on every wendigo hit I cant move or automatically stop shooting
---
Do you have blocker and dodgy? At least blocker is a must.
---
What platform are you on? I wallpaper all wall types on PS4. Windows don’t cause a problem for me. Have you tried a work around? Build solid walls put wallpaper in them and then change the wall to a window wall piece in edit mode.
---
Flat woods hotel gym, Charleston fire station gym, prison gym and the 3 silo gyms, and a small bonus dumbbell is in that student party house in Morgan town  I run this once a day, and I'm sitting on 40k + lead right now.
---
while armor rating isnt unnecessary, a lot of your survivability in this game comes from perks that reduce damage by percentage
---
 
---
its a bit unintuitive, but you wont see a huge difference between 300 dr or 600dr
---
if you want to build a tank, focus on perks like serendipidy/dodgey/blocker/richochet/nerdrage
---
maybe take autostim pieces into account or go for a mix of mutant slayers/troubleshooters armor rather than vanguard and so on
---
Happened to me the other day when I was killing mobs died and some guy was stealthed in a corner somewhere and robbed my shit , in that case yes but In pvp it’s fair play
---
I've sold ammo since before vendors. 
---
10mm never sold for me. 
---
Shotgun shells used to, then the original nerf killed them, but magic shotguns have increased sales a bit. 
---
50 cal, 5mm, 45, and 5.56 have always sold for me. 
---
And I'm selling 1000's of rounds.
---
It's the best screw farming method there is. I've ran it twice in a PS, just to sit in the exit tunnel, farm wendigos, and not bother with Earle until the last couple minutes.
---
I've got all the rewards, but I'll still run it every time it pops up. 
---
I had 40 keycards when the event launched, so I've nuked Earle 40(ish)+ times since then.
---
Riiiiight... on the non existent text chat?
---
I'm Xbox. I've got a lead resource camp now. Took a loooong while to find the one I wanted tho. Even got a nice view to boot 😁
---
I think it's sad how PvP doesn't get the attention it deserves.
---
It should've been a big feature from the launch, like in the good old survival mode days.
---
Hippity Hippity your junk is now my property.
---
Hey thanks again.
---
Your dr is good. It sounds like your survivability perks. Eg. Dodgey, Ricochet, body guard, barbarian, bullet shield and so on. Some chems like med-x and others help you be more like a tank.
---
No worries I got another one lol 😆
---
Because that mod is bugged, atm it lends it's damage to make magic guns with the bashing prefix more powerful.
---
got it from the gold game pass huh? i've never seen a user on this sub that was low level and on PC, so, sadly i can't really help anyone even when i want to.
---
Here's to hoping that microsoft enables xbox players and pc players to crossplay
---
you're welcome
---
And thank you at this rate ill be trade for all the others too.
---
Yep, just close the game and it's gone, tadaa!
---
U heard wrong.  
---
Pacifist mode on will not engage you in PVP if ur using taking one for the team perk.
---
&gt;fast travel to BoS HQ will be free once you max your reputation with them.
---
Source?
---
🤔
---
It seems to me that you could have at least gone down with the ship and sacrificed yourself for accidentely causing his demise lol
---
Damn that is def the drop of choice that Todd Howard had picked out for you lol
---
Or meat cleavers, tomahawks, other thrown melee weapons in general, etc..
---
Honest man if I get another today im going flip knowing my luck it will be nothing or the lamp again.
---
&gt; what’s the point of pvp with no reward
---
Most people just want no PVP, period.
---
I was just bashing all bots with my 50.cal and didnt see any issues?
---
If you're gonna take one for the team, just take one for the team. lol It's fine. Or put on passive.
---
Got the game for Xmas when it came out, played a little, got bored and went back to fallout 4. Only recently got back in to it and began again now that there are NPC's. Enjoying the game a lot more since the last couple updates.
---
I was so shocked when someone bought my entire stock of 44 rounds the other day, over 4000 rounds of ammunition cleared from my stash!
---
No, it doesn't. The person had to have actual teammates for the perk to activate.
---
Thanks for the tips 🙂
---
What's your build in F4? and are you doing the same in f76?
---
CHA CHING
---
Yeah I’ve been getting the signs over and over again now. I was getting vault 94 outfit a bunch. Then I got nothing couple times. Just want to get some of the other stuff like super reactor and solar panels. The outfit would also be nice but I’m trading for a outfit some time soon. But hey good luck hope you get some other shit this time
---
Sorry man. I hate melee and only found out 2 days ago 😭
---
I got luck / follow thru and am thinking of getting agility. Don’t like keep swapping them in out while deciding using unnecessary coins
---
Nah. Your teammate was in a workshop if all that is true.
---
But how else do I get people out of my camp?
---
Suppose I could carry a shitty knife or something to switch to and do that instead of using gun bashing
---
I would love Chinese stealth armour mods
---
No he wasn't, he was hanging out at another friends camp!
---
You don't need to have lockpicking and hacker equiped all the time tho, so infilytator don't rly save special stats, it saves time you waste swapping cards
---
I'd like to see a lead pipe with circular saw blades cut in half and welded on to make a battle axe, or even mods that reduce weight of a melee weapon, increasing swing speed but also reducing damage output... theres so much stuff the could implement into the game for all of the existing weapons! I'd love to run around with a hatchet and be a post apocalyptic viking but it's just not feasible as all of the new weapons and high gear weapons out do all the other cool weapons! give each weapon a different kind of bonus. for example a blunt weapon would stun a enemy and give them a chance to have blurred vision for a few seconds or confused for npc's. sharp weapons would naturally be more armour piercing. I hate the fact they have added in multipurpose axes, spears, hatches but they just arnt great compared to things like the new gleive, super sledge etc! give love to other weapons into the game developers and you will see other people start using these weapons becuase they are feasible to use and not just becuase it's something they picked up until they find something better!
---
again they added in bows to accompany crossbows but yet only different damage modifier mods, make it so you can change the wood, string and sights etc for either better range, faster draw speed etc
---
also pistols need love too, is have too many times where I'm going along killing 3 star enemies and picking up some really good pistols but what's the point in using them if you can't have similar damage output. alot of people I speak to get put off becuase theres too many different pistols yet all of them past certain levels are next to useless...
---
bethesda you have all these weapons in the game and all you see most people using is either heavy weapons or fixers and handmades... why do you think that is??
---
also on lever actions extending the barrel should increase magazine tube size... I mean it does visually it's not out of the ordinary for a lever action rifle to hold more than 5 bullets... I love lever action rifles but find it's pointless using it for alot of events simply becuase the damage isn't quite high enough and it's got too few bullets.
---
I always buy fuel and 2mm. But if its not 1c forget it.
---
I only craft a few pieces at a time, usually at the end of the day, and only when I have a little scrip left.  I immediately scrip the 1 and 2 star pieces. The unwanted 3 star items are the first things I scrip the following day. If necessary, I'll transfer tradeable legendary items to another character. It's a slow process, but at least I don't get bogged down with a bunch of legendary items I have to hold for days, or be forced in to dropping them.
---
I always buy fuel. It works good on earl. I personnaly think the flamer is one of most underrated weapons.
---
Do you make the 5.56? Crafting 20 at a time is expensive, i wonder if theres a perk or something i'm missing.
---
I love it.
---
When you find a good place to build your camp that has a lead deposit, you need to build a lead extractor on it and power it up. I can't recall if you automatically know the plans for the extractors at start, it's been so long since I first started, but once you build the extractor on the lead deposit, it will continuously collect lead for you.
---
I've kept all that I got for it and canceled it months ago
---
I’m even let 2mm go for 1 each.  Crazy right?
---
Only if you were close enough when it died!
---
lucky hole mine, excavator PA for 4 times lead ore then refine with 1 acid waste per 2 ore for 5 lead. equip chemist and super duper - each run is like 2k lead
---
Healing factor makes it harder to survive in a fight, and sentinel armor is still rare as fuck!
---
Maybe using the same logic .50 cal can also apply to the hunting rifle? Just a guess based on why we may be receiving less .50 cal back which is annoying when running a b/25 50cal to get 5 rounds of ammo back.
---
If you aren't a part of the community, you're not gonna know how big it really is. And like, duh, man. If you aren't seeking PvP then the only PvP that is gonna find you is the griefing kind. 🤨
---
Really i have a ton of sentinal armor ? Its all in crap peices though like enemy related or cloaking or nocturnal
---
I once encountered 3 kings and 3 queens at that same spot. This was long before One Wasteland, but I had crappy weapons at the time, so it was still tough battle.
---
PC, when i select a windowed wall the wall paper option disappears. 
---
Oh cool yeah that workaround works. Put wallpaper on as a full wall, switch to windows or door. Thank you
---
I only ever seem to get sentinel to drop on assassin's pieces, as I hate pvp into the scrip machine it always goes...
---
I got 3 characters, one's 421.  I played arou d.  The explosions are anoying, damage resistances are OK, but not needed, and the other ones are either items/boost items/lockpick. So that leaves the ranged sneak, team one (after someone was in fits because I asked why he wasn't taking one for the team) and the specials.  Specials at least 1 for sure
---
Woww. Let's take away the last area's PvP is enabled and sell cookies instead. 🤨
---
We do get an armor ace skin for handmade it's just a tropical camo called tropic thunder
---
r/iamverybadass
---
well, you’re getting instanced interiors because it seems the system struggles as is with rendering people’s camps
---
I only have 3 assasin sentinals and 1 bolstering sentinal . Why would healing factor make it harder ? Just duck and escaoe artist the aggro off ,heal up , re engage
---
Just remember to shoot it first. I've done the come here as a courtesy too soon and had someone just destroy it before I get a shot in. Manners second, people
---
So things like the meat cleaver, throwing knife, and tomahawk should work on resilient enemies?
---
I do that with vanguard peices and cavalier
---
holy mackerel I didn't think of that.
---
There's a reason I have a cat head mounted next to my bed, and I don't want to put a second one there.
---
Buncha garbo
---
Shouldn't of used the ammo machine glitch and you wouldn't have to rebuild hope you learned your lesson.
---
Black Powder guns don’t even have prime mods. They got nothing aside from an obscure bayonet for the rifle you have to find randomly in the world. 
---
Crossbows could also use some sort of semi-auto mod, like the crossbow from Metro.
---
Half the heavy weapons have basically no mods at all, aside from a prime receiver and a barrel if you’re lucky. 
---
The M79 grenade launcher with a 6-shot revolving drum would make an excellent middle ground between the base version and the auto grenade launcher.
---
And don’t even get me started on all the weapons that have plenty of mods but need a serious stat buff to be viable to any degree 👀
---
You only auto heal at hidden, caution doesn't proc it. So you're just making stimpacks and chems less effective during a fight just so you can save stimpacks after the fight!
---
Find yourself a nice legendary flamer, I had a furious 3* flamer that would melt a Mirelurk king in under 4 seconds. I just switched to a TS FFR 90% reduced weight flamer that’s even better. Mirelurks and Wendigo fear me now.
---
Doing it with teams is more helpful for me. Gets the goals down faster.
---
I didn’t know it was a glitch when it was built in my camp
---
Yea but, dogs
---
First do the Wastelander series, then go and buy those lunchboxes, use 4 at the same time for 100% xp bonus, then go into high level areas and kill mobs.
---
You can contest during a defend event - hence your suggestion to snipe from outside the zone. 
---
You cannot contest when a workshop is overrun.
---
But if you drink a serum you dont have any negative effects
---
I miss survival mode.  The risk was much higher so if you got into combat, you really had to outplay your enemy.  Trusting players was much more difficult and shooting first, thinking later was how the world worked.  It makes sense because I picture a collapsed wasteland to be this way.  You never know who to trust.
---
I could better understand with throwing as its kind of range weapon style, but in the end it's very much the same :D why is it not possible to finish with a thrown knife? Why do I have to stick the stupid knife in the fucking robot?? It's a very good question
---
If you can afford to keep wasting flux on that, but as I said, you only heal at hidden, not caution!
---
High level here with God tier guns, this is why I hit it with a gun and emote for people to come get a tag on it. Less chance of nuking it on accident!
---
You clearly have no understanding of ultracite gattling lasers.
---
👍But don't forget "Suppressor" ! Jesus, ppl really underestimate this perk card 😐
---
To me it is as important as "Blocker".
---
Ghost weight is a massive pain, ive noticed it more when using grenades or using heavy ammo. like missiles or mini-nukes
---
I know Bethesda is working on pets but I'll take a nonkillable camp animals. I tame animals all the time and I'm so tired of them slowly getting killed by surrounding creatures. There's nothing you can do but watch them die. It's not like they are easy to come by! We love our camp animals. They bring a lot to the camp!
---
Legacies and Teslas weren't OP... I miss I too...
---
Passwords and keys can be resolved with a keyring. Fo3 had a keyring, they removed it in Fo4 why I have no clue.
---
Kill lots. Quickly.
---
Public teams are good, run inspirational r3 on a casual team for a good boost
---
Rad rumble is a great event for xp. Or anywhere with a lot of super mutants
---
Well hes focused his ammo to one type, so that makes it easy.  Ultracite not withstanding. 
---
Personally as a heavy weapons tank, I carry 60k+ .50 cal, 45k+ 5mm, ~10k Ultracite 2mm emc, 40 ish plasma core/ultracite plasma core/fusion core/ultracite fusion core, 5k fuel, 1k cryo cells, 16 harpoons (flechettes), 5k plasma cartridges, 10k ultracite .308, plus whatever I pick up.
---
Eventually you just accumulate and find ammo.
---
On that machine I throw a lit up (?) next to the words nuka cola. Mine is probably 2/3 vintage nukasine but I do put some cranberry in there and some dark maybe various sundry other liquors.
---
Casual teams give an INT bonus for everything. Event teams give big bonuses for event XP rewards. Switch back and forth between them to get the most out of both.
---
In general, get INT as high as you can. If you run bloodied, Unyielding armor gives everything a boost. Look for mutations that give helpful INT boosts directly (Egghead) or indirectly/enhanced with perks or other factors (Strange in Numbers + Herd Mentality + being on a team).
---
A number of different foods give INT boosts or XP boosts. Cranberry relish, crispy squirrel bits, etc.
---
Then, once you have INT high and all your bonuses running, clear out high enemy events and areas. One Violent Night, Guided Meditation, West-Tek, Huntersville, Harper's Ferry, etc.
---
Yea I know, ive Seen it...
---
Join a team casual if farming mobs event if you wanna grind events. Well reated/lovers embrace, cranberry relish brain fungus soup, berry mental, hit path to enlightenment when it's up, and pop a lunch box at events with lots of ppl they usually reciprocate. I was getting over 1000 xp per kill at the prime meat event in the cranberry bog yesterday
---
I have been using automatic railway rifles more lately so I've been carrying a lot of railway spikes and those things are super heavy. I wonder if that's it.
---
Dude it’s the only consequence to death. If anything they should make death more brutal.
---
How much junk were you carrying? Because if it's anything more than a small handful of items, you're doing it wrong.
---
Yeah the resource section of the menu seems to only pop up if there's a resource inside the build zone. I've got that and built it all within the inside of my 3x3 house. Floor tiles can be built through the extractor too, which is really handy
---
I think it looks dope
---
Lol, I just know the game.  If you don't want help, carry on complaining on here or to Bethesda.  Or ask what platform I'm on and join the group, you might learn why people enjoy it and can do these things
---
My real name is Jock too
---
I knew this would get complained about. It's the only mutation that adds any kind of difficulty to the daily. I personally enjoy it. I don't want the game to de as easy as it is.
---
Oooooor maybe people just don’t feel the need to act hard and brag about it, just a thought.
---
Steam, Bethesda, Microsoft?
---
I assume you have performed an integrity check to make sure the install is good?   Or removed and reinstalled?
---
If so
---
When you uninstall make sure to purge the fallout folder in you my documents.  It contains the ini files you want to reset those too
---
It could be a graphics issue?   Have your tried setting the resolution to 1080p low.  To rule out card?
---
Have you updated.  Video drivers recently?   
---
Has it ever worked?
---
Try Window mode
---
It could be sound?   Do you have USB speakers? Headphones.  Try to remove those.  See if crash stops
---
Are you running win10 preview builds?   Those have caused problems in past
---
Have you attempted to right click and launch as admin?    If you remove and reinstall do not install to program files.   Created a dedicated GAMES folder.  UAC protects program files
---
These off the top of my head
---
I can try to help
---
Submit another ticket. Also, look through various forums on CTD for Fo76. Specifically Google stuff like "fallout 76 crashes when starting/loading/action...etc". Your best bet is to start looking through the reddit and Bethesda forums on Fo76
---
That would be cool.
---
There was no disputing that.......???
---
They increased the budget in Mar 2019, they have also reduced the cost of putting down quite a few things. Example: Lights. They are now implimenting instanced shelters, which is supposed to be unlimited. &lt;-which is awesome.
---
Hell I'd just be happy if the purveyor would stop giving me gatling lasers and start dropping weapons I can actually use.
---
Only *once* have I seen a rifle class weapon, but I've got enough gatling lasers to arm a small country.
---
No, on the profile you get when u hit my name on the map before fast traveling to wherever I go
---
I call bullshit.
---
Hum. I dont use it. Two seconds dosent sound like much
---
I've seen it said in this sub all the time, usually when calling for bloodied nerfs. 
---
Bloodied can have some good damage mitigation through some perks, but it'll still fall over if the breeze blows its way.
---
Oh crap I already forgot those things existed. Used to use them early on as emergency chunk of damage.
---
Why are rare rewards scarce?
---
Is that your question?
---
I think this would make an excellent legendary perk. Legendary Farmer, each rank you could grow a new set of plants or with each star you could choose an extra plant you can now grow from a list. Something like that. I'd take it.
---
I’ve always found radrats to be harder to kill than Super Mutants. It’s because they’re fast and their hit boxes are tiny.
---
Watta BS.... This is meant to be an post-apolalyptic MMO not a stupid inphantilistic cardboard game of braindead grinding.  They should give meaningful content like the base stories with matched enemies with improved AI and first of all clean up the most bugging software bugs of the last 2 years.
---
It's a serious bug that needs fixing!
---
I'm offering help and u say I'm acting hard and bragging about it?? Ur deranged man it's a different perspective
---
Yes it is lol 😂
---
Buttress mod, I use dense on chest and deep pockets everywhere else.
---
Conversely, I'd be thrilled to be able to avoid yet another bolus of common masks while I'm looking for incremental improvements in my legendary modifiers.
---
This one thousand times please
---
youre welcome 👍🏼
---
It should be two seconds per hit or something
---
I run a junkies PA tank with t65.
---
Use either my JE 50 cal or JE gat plasma
---
Untouchable and amazing damage.
---
Highly recommend👌
---
redrum
---
Lol just go to the pumpkin house it also has costumes down the street you even have to kill a wendigo dressed as a clown.
---
when you burn through a bunch, check how many you have, and then when you log back in see if it "corrects" to a higher number
---
I'm a stealth rifleman and I can still hide.
---
Do you have the card that makes enemies lose you when you crouch?
---
Maybe i never noticed . I do know in earl fights if i duck all the wendigos leave me alone and even earl will walk away from me .
---
Ok, guess it doesn’t matter if I communicate with that team as long as I get the 2,3,or 4x boosted
---
No, the whole point of fallout is it’s a wasteland of anarchy.  No government, no laws, no enforcement, and everyone fighting to stay alive.  If anything, it should be a bigger part of the game.  No body’s going to all work together in one big community to help conquer the wasteland with their friends.  It’s going to be a blood bath of people fighting even their neighbors to stay alive with what little they have left.
---
YouTube.  Angry turtle has allot of good videos on xp farming.   The advice is pre one wasteland but it’s very relevant info
---
Part last patch.  Any event with lvl 100 mobs is an xp factory
---
Can’t use unarmed weapons In PA. 
---
All u can do is add the arm mod that increases the PA unarmed punching.
---
The real question being asked here is; "Is the game supposed to be balanced around legendaries?"
---
Bethesda doesn't seem to have an answer.
---
If the answer is yes, then it absolutely needs to be easier to get the right legendary gear. I'd love to get some rifle class legendaries, but I never do: I have seen three total, in *two fucking years* drop from mobs or the purveyor.
---
If the answer is no, then something needs to be done about all the legendary gear floating around.
---
Alas not an option in daily ops, its danger all the time!
---
I took off escape artist when things started detecting me immediately. Put thru hiker back on. Lol
---
It doesn’t really seem like you’re offering help hahaha and then you definitely were bragging about how you can solo all the events. Chill brah it’s literally a video game
---
Yeah i hit elder everytime now and only got one gun plan . Its lame .
---
Depends on how you play.  I am always overflowing with food, water, stims, and I just ignore disease since the effects are so minor.
---
I remember radiation rumble, a tone of glowing ones normally charge at the NPCs so it would most likely be a good place to farm
---
Always a sneaky rifleman or rogue in any rpg. Yeah I'm doing the same on this. Thought I'd try a laser rifle yesterday for closer encounters but found they're absolutely shit.
---
Let players use legendary modules to upgrade base gear: One module per star.
---
It's still random, but at least you're starting with the weapon or armour you want.
---
Even better you keep your stash. You just can’t add to it
---
Get 1st.  Stuff your stash cancel.  Drain when empty re up 1st for 1 month
---
Thanks!  I have looked through all of those I have been working on this since the 22nd when power and internet came back from the hurricane.  
---
I played fine before the hurricane and now it crashes.
---
I mean me not getting rare loot is lame , the daily ops have been fun
---
Blocker, fireproof, dodge, nerd rage, serendipity.   U can also use evasive and ricochet if u can fit it.
---
I’ve been collecting outfits and by far the rarest are the Responders Fireman Outfit and Helmet, Red Asylum, and the VTU Cap. I know that the Ultracite Calibrated Shocks and the Healing Salve (The Mire) Plans are also really rare and worth a small fortune! There will be others but those are the ones I see going for a lot!
---
I just pulled all the info from my support tickets.  I am going to add it to my main post.
---
  
---
I load the game and get past the first screen where it says Please Stand By. Then I go to the next screen where it says Press Any Button to Start. I press any button and then it crashes. I have followed everything on the support page. I have disabled Game DVR, I updated my nvidia drivers, set both applications to run as administrators, run the scan and repair, unplugged my controller, Both are added to exclusions. I have DirectX 12.
---
I have also done the following:
---
Uninstall and reinstall game - Done  
---
Uninstall and reinstall launcher (Which uninstalled the game a 2nd time) - Done  
---
Power Cycling the Network - Done  
---
Port Forwarding - Done  
---
Flush your DNS - Done
---
Getting frustrated I was just trying some stuff to see if I had any luck.  I went into Geforce Experience and switched from full screen to windowed mode. That spread the screen across both of my monitors. I then saw something that I could not see on a single monitor. Here is what it said. I don't know if its going to help but maybe it will.
---

Awesome glad the workaround worked.
---
Lol. I like the way you think
---
Was using death law.   But this seams so obvious now
---
It's an alt, so not as high level as my main, but I use [this build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3d285fa&amp;d=p00pp2a32lt2lu2a04s01pg2ph2pi2c72cm2cu0a70ar2an2l71lv2eo2i11ic2xm1xp1xq1xa1x60sg2x80&amp;w=cd1c60ce0&amp;m=051c249f8a&amp;nw=p1p7pci2aal3l4) for my junky commando.
---
My build is a bloodied power armor heavy gunner but I have about 10 intelligence so I will find the consumables you mentioned
---
Only if you’re doing it solo, never went past 8 in a group
---
It’s really not bad, unless you are solo
---
Just make 1 piece at a time.
---
I got lucky with the chest and arms. 
---
Right leg took a while and the left leg has been a nightmare.
---
Finally cleared out my last ss leg for scrip but now have tons of 3 star junk weapons from ops and meat week that will take forever to unload before I can start up crafting the leg again.
---
Be nice if we could just pay scrip to change a legendary effect.
---
Or photomode clip.  Locked doors are basically pointless to have in this game.  If someone wants, in they can get in without gaining wanted status.
---
They don't take up computing power as is, they just take up a heap of spaces and clutter it up
---
Lol, I defo didn't say all, and that says it all.  Cant always do project paradise, and Queen and Carl is a no go by myself, Im not that extreme player.  However all my characters pack a punch, its normally perk cards I gota go trough with people.  I still do it with someone iv been playing with since beta, she just keeps changing them!
---
I have this happen every now and again, try unequipping any weight reduction armour or perk cards then equip them all again. It has always fixed it for me.
---
I can't believe that 2 years into the game, people still try to sell ammo for more than 1 cap
---
Hey I'm on ps4 as well! If u ever need any help or just someone to farm some events or even just wander around aimlessly hmu... psn tatudpirate ..... :)
---
Like others have said.   Join or form a public team.    You don’t have to actual talk to them if you don’t want to but I recommend you do if you want to.   
---
Then there are many posts on here that talk about foods and other items you can use to get an XP bonus.   An easy one to do is sleep in a bed to get the well rested bonus.  
---
Then do events and quests and kill things while doing the daily and weekly quests.   Usually the dailies for score  can be completed in under an hour if you fast travel.
---
I tried it last night, solo. 13 minutes and change.
---
Any companion is unkillable in F4, why would you specify that.
---
Were each individual sentence in the quoted paragraph a series of line items, or bullet points your argument would hold water, as it stands the one sentence you are referencing is bookended by statements about these 3 instances being on the PTS. For TESTING. 
---
The inference (based on the paragraph structure) is that there will be the ability for PTS users to have 3 instances so they can test all 3 out for optimization purposes.
---
Anything else is desperate reaching and you are probably going to be disappointed by expecting something unreasonable, and unnecessary.
---
You are welcome; I don't get why people try to charge more for ammo
---
Yeah, I did it in a group first so I could get max rewards and then I did it solo because why not. I was almost at 14 minutes
---
for me, i always go for rifleman overseers guardian, but i did go the deliverer on my railroad build, because i hated the faction and wanted to be done with it fast
---
Everyones complaining about resilient, and last night we did it and I was cleanup. I used a troubleshooters buzz blade with 50% LD, and had absolutely no issues. Finished in a little over 6 minutes. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I can confirm this helps.
---
I play through the Bethesda Launcher
---
I assume you have performed an integrity check to make sure the install is good? Or removed and reinstalled?
---
Yes to integrity check and it has been uninstalled and reinstalled twice along with reinstalling the launcher.
---
When you uninstall make sure to purge the fallout folder in you my documents. It contains the ini files you want to reset those too
---
I did not delete any files.  Support told me that there was no need to delete any files and that the unilstall would take care of everything.
---
It could be a graphics issue? Have your tried setting the resolution to 1080p low. To rule out card?
---
I do not know how to do this.  
---
Have you updated. Video drivers recently?
---
Yes.
---
Yes I have been playing for over a year.  I played just before Hurricane Sally hit.  Once we got power and net back is when the crashing started.
---
I did that and found something weird on the screen its in my other post.
---
It could be sound? Do you have USB speakers? Headphones. Try to remove those. See if crash stops
---
I do not have USB headphones or speakers.
---
Are you running win10 preview builds? Those have caused problems in past
---
I do not know what those are so I am going to guess no.
---
Have you attempted to right click and launch as admin? If you remove and reinstall do not install to program files. Created a dedicated GAMES folder. UAC protects program files
---
Yes to the admin.  It installs to Program Files (x86) and that is where I played it from in the past.
---
Put on pacifist mode or you're fair game.
---
I noticed this to when unloading to a mule.
---
All the ammo that supposedly had zero weight actually had weight.
---
Maxed blocker perk is a must.
---
I refuse to spend one penny on ammo, unless it's to . meet a daily requirement.  I don't see anything heroic about selling ammo for one cap. I can't imagine anyone buying it for more than that.
---
It's randomized. My buddies and I used to have a guy host "Nukashine Roulette". We provided the alcohol and nukashine, he tosses one nukashine and the alcohol in. Winner got 250 caps for each game, 25 cap buy-in from each person.
---
It refreshes...as far as i'm aware. 
---
It works like Tenderizer. As long as you keep damaging your targets. It is quite efficient in activities like Daily Ops, Scorched Earth event and the Colosal Problem. Don't underestimate it. 
---
As exemple, in Daily Ops, i can throw nades to a bunch of adds and stand there in my PA (Bloodied build) poping diluted stimpaks if needed. But combined to the Blocker perk, Suppressor saved me multiple times from goul groups, when outside my PA. 
---
It is just a must, in my opinion, i have it equiped on all my characters. If you are trying to escape, it cost you just a couple of ammo and if you tank bosses as, a bloodied build, it gives you all the time you need to pop a diluted stimpak if needed.
---
Also as a sneaky build...it can save your ass. I highly recommand you to test it a lil more  man. ✌
---
I know about the shots left as that happens with my weapons on my main character all the time. Im wondering about the instant reload.
---
From the messages at the end of your post, and that it worked before outage after hurricane, it makes me think it may be a network issue (not necessarily local in your house). Do you have opportunity to test with a different internet connection - preferably with a different provider?
---
If you have a decent data plan, maybe try with WiFi-tethering from your phone so you access internet through the mobile network. Not to play, but just to see if the game loads to help troubleshoot the issue.
---
Floor gang, wya?
---
Have you tried removing those files from documents / my games/ fallout76 :
---
* fallout76.ini
---
* fallout76custom.ini
---
* fallout76prefs.ini
---
Maybe drag those files to your desktop so you don't lose them (in case you need them again). The try to launch the game, it should re-build those files. Worth a try...
---
Also, are you using 2 monitors? If so maybe try to disable all but your main monitor.
---
Daily ops with a vampire weapon.  I come out with plus 20 to 30 each time
---
Keys should go on a keychain which doesn't allow duplicates and since they can't be dropped, they shouldn't even need to be individual items. Tapes and notes should be a lexicon/database entries instead of being individual items, that would help collectors and would also keeping track on what did you find and what do you need still.
---
Can i ask how you managed to get 10 people in there?
---
Thankfully have a decent amount just hurting my farming runs severely
---
Its takes too long to reduce recommended prices.  I use to do what you are doing, then someone bought out my inventory.  Decided I'd just be lazy...
---
I carry a J SS 90 pickaxe on my heavy weapons build for things that I think dont warrant a bullet, and now for this.
---
But otherwise, I carry 12+ heavy weapons with ammo to spare.  Each has a purpose, and I male sure to use them all.  
---
It mostly helps keep ammo consumption in check as it's easier to rely on pickups instead of crafting when you can just switch to another weapon.
---
Best way to do it is to lure him to the mineshaft because he can’t get under it and let him have it
---
Still though it’s definitely not ideal
---
Good to know! I dropped 30k on the shock plans not too long ago after only ever seeing them the one time in a vendor. And got the Responder Fireman Helmet a little over a year ago. But that helps establish a few good "white whales" to hunt.
---
I got mine at the station,took about 15 tries.
---
Vampire weapon? Sounds like I need to hit the legendary shop.
---
Get better guns and or a better build. Also a better group. I have yet to have the event fail even when he decided to play mole rat for 5 minutes and then sbq for the remainder of the fight
---
Keep just that one weapon and stash other same weapons.
---
The balistic AP attacks make the same sound as melee attacks. Pretty sure it's intended to let you know when the dang armor piercing balistic gutsies are shooting at you.
---
Yea daily ops is a great way. If you are a melee build its easier on ammo also.
---
The primal cuts in cranberry bog also gives a fair few stimpacks from fog crawlers if you can kill them easily enough.
---
Lucky, mine had me wake up on a double mattress bed in the middle of the savage divide with a dead deathclaw. Got a nasty case of swamp itch as well from it.
---
I fear to know what my guy did when he passed out.
---
Okay I also need to ask how do you do a "daily op"? Is there a mission pip or is it like the murder mission from the crater? I've been wondering since they came out.
---
I'm on pc as well but I'm able to wallpaper my windowed walls without much fuss. I just have to not aim at the window itself but the bare wall instead.
---
Why the delay? Bullets are cheap af now.
---
Ah you are saying this is kind of the source of the magic damage? Some kind of stacking the bash damage and adding to the damage dealt by the normal range attack? So the further I increase bashing damage, the more 'magic' damage? I never looked into details of turtles video but does the bashing perk, armor bashing legendary effect and weapon bashing legendary effect as well as bashing mods stack in some way?
---
All this does is make me go "hey, when we pick up ammo out in the wild (unless it's a single round), it's always an ammo box."
---
Which then begs the question, "Bethesda, why are we forced into selling single rounds at our vending machines when ammo boxes literally exist in universe?"
---
Bethesda, ammo bulking for vending purposes pretty please? Pretty pretty please, with whipped cream, hot fudge, crushed peanuts (unless you're allergic), and a cherry on top?
---
🙏
---
I always try but in the bog every second your not pouring lead into a legendary enemy is the second someone dies.
---
I want to make a vault tec vault, really friendly and all, but with 1 locked door where behind there are meat piles of people i eat since i'm kind of a cannibal
---
Are emergency protocols also rare?
---
What armour are you using though, vanguard, bolstering Or unyeilding.
---
Ok will do fine sir.
---
Are the emergency protocols still rare as well?
---
Wait. The mire healing salve recipe is worth caps? I get them out of mirrors atleast once a week. Im guessing I shouldn't be selling them for 100 caps each. What would you pay for them?
---
Now that will be worth the atoms for sure!
---
I thought I would give myself a challenge by making a pistol character.  I was wrong, pistols were too strong.  And now they got buffed big time with tank killer, so the problem is your build, not the weapon.  Thanks to pistols (especially revolvers) having great accuracy, you can spare some points in perception, put them in demo expert and luck. Spamming crits and using a tse automatic 10mm destroys everything.  And if they aren't dead right away, they are crippled.  If you are wasting points on thru-hiker, get a grocery backpack or aid weight reduction armor.  You need all the points you can get to have maxed adrenaline and gun fu.  Successful procs of grim reaper sprint and crit spamming is key in things like daily ops when you need to clear hordes.  You can always fall back on tossing a mirv frag when in a tough spot.  Also, because vats is so good with explosive guerilla builds, you'll want to be exploiting the fact that blocker's armor will magically boost your vats damage on things like the tse 10mm.
---
I'm on Xbox and even with the Gamepass flood, I didn't sell very many and I don't have plans priced above 10-15 caps, max.
---
I find that things like Benches, Tables, Signs, etc sell well, but the Mounted Plans don't. Even shit like Dog Meat Steak recipes sell for me faster than Mounted Plans.
---
I just miss the days you could pump out 2000 damage in half a second, but your right
---
Im just tired of either getting nothing or the same thing. Haven't had a new reward in a while but hell anyone one a shitting vault 94 stash box? Been giving them away still have 3 left.
---
I took a picture of my real life junk.  All nice and zoomed in an everything.  Kinda veiny like and eighties cartoon barbarian.
---
I placed this picture in my pictures folder on my computer so I could use it in the picture frame you want.
---
Then I carefully placed the frame on a stand at the spawn in point at my base.  I tested this several times to make absolutely certain that when you visit my base the first thing you see will be my frank and beans.
---
FRANK AN BEANS!
---
(This is why you’ll never see it happen, but yes ild love an idea to put picture frames on desks.)
---
&gt; It’s really frustrating to outright lose a legendary over someone’s greed. 
---
It's not always greed, sometimes it's just an outright accident. I know that sounds silly but yes, you can accidentally 1 or 2 shot something while just trying to get your shots in so you get loot. I've seen it happen, and I've personally had it happen. 
---
I have a mini gun and a double barrel shotgun that are my worst offenders. Their damage is all over the place. Sometimes it's predictable, sometimes they blast a hole right through a vault door. 
---
So I carry a melee weapon and just smack the legendary a couple times and wait for others. But sometimes ... sometimes the legendary isn't too smart and walks right into the line of fire and catches a hail of bullets. Sometimes they barely get a scratch, sometimes they get the dead. And then I feel super bad.
---
BTW I don't use magic weapons because I don't like glitches weapons. I use legacies and there are already very op for use in groups. I just never thought much about the source of the 'magic' effect... But this seems like a good explanation.
---
Join a daily op team. And on your map screen if you hit the up button on PS4, I'm not sure on PC. But hit that button then you can start a daily Ops.
---
There are a couple of good youtube videos with the soawn points.  I know of 5 off the top of head.  But they aren't at exact locations.  Charlestin station is my go to location though.
---
The 10mm Smg still needs a suppressor and the Tommy Gun is missing most of the mods available to every other weapon.
---
I am swimming in fiber optics from that one LOL
---
I don't understand?!?! Down vote, down vote, DOWN VOTE!!!!!
---
I've been selling 7000+ ultracite 5mm for 1 cap for a few days now and still no one has bought any :((
---
Thx!
---
Are you asking about damage from other players to you?  If you have pacifist on, you will take no damage at all and also cannot hurt other players.
---
What build are you?
---
I just sold all the raw meat I got so far this week. I have limited time to game so I won't spend 25% of my available time cooking.
---
😮😂
---
Do not underestimate the value of tin can traps.  Disarm those every time you see them.   
---
Also.  In general.   HOOVER up all junk and scrap.   It helps reset loot in areas you revisit.  Plus you will always have all the crafting supplies you need.   If you don’t have FO1st.  You can BULK and sell the overflow
---
I found that those stupid floater grenades caused this for me, to some degree.  If I am overencumbered by a small amount, then I lob a few of the floater grenades i will be below weight, but the overencumbered red warning in the bottom right remains until i actually drop an item.
---
This leads me to believe that the weight calculation is not working properly when a consumable is used.  It doesn't update a proper reduced weight unless you actually force drop an item. More testing would need to be done to determine if this is 100% true for all consumables/circumstances, but im not on Bethesda's payroll so not gonna waste my time with that.
---
Also scorched dropped a lot of stimpacks.
---
I did that last night and it worked like a charm.  Auto que would be nice though.
---
I also miss the way of selling to vendors in previous fallouts. Select everything you want to sell, then confirm the sale so it's only one pop up on screen.
---
You may want a vendor shop for a vampire weapon you want. This look for a two-star. The purveyor is random a f and who knows what you're going to get.
---
Now i want a pickle sandwich that speaks fluent italian!!
---
&gt;Super high levels love to just decimate them in a few shots and prevent anyone else from getting a legendary. Its especially bad in places like uranium fever. 
---
You know, I saw these comments all over the place before I started playing, and still see them. Currently level 108 and I've never seen this. Maybe I'm lucky, but nobody has ever swiss cheesed the SBQ, and Uranium Fever the people always play nice. They find the legendary and use the "come here" gesture. Everybody gets a few taps in, we look around and check, then it's one dead legendary. 
---
An accident happens from time to time but it's always followed by a series of apologies that sound pretty sincere. 
---
I'm on PC, so maybe it's a different crowd?
---
I meant just aiming my swing for headshots/crit points. I only get 3 or 4 hits in vats with my setup.
---
I agree with you on the loss of strength being a big hit for a melee build, I'm just trying to do cost/benefit of my damage vs character balance with the new update. I also have at least +2 STR from Legendary armor and I try to compensate with that as well and if desperate I use chems. 
---
In a team right now I'm hitting 24 STR without chems. I can still 2 and 3 shot most enemies and one shot once adrenaline is stacked, so I'm balancing my special while relevant damage type cards and mutations to get me where I want to be for dps.
---
So far my damage did take a small hit so if you want to prioritize one shotting enemies then I definitely agree to skip Egg Head like you said, its more of an XP vs Pure damage choice, I may cure it after I hit my leveling goal. 
---
Bird bones was a surprisingly fun addition as I am a bit over zealous when jumping off of high places, BUT don't take it if you don't want at least one perk card point in adamantium skeleton for sure.
---
If you’re on console no. If you’re on pc yes.
---
As a melee build I have so much lead and gunpowder I don't know what to do with it.
---
No one's going to bother with taking time out of their play time just to appease your need for attention.
---
I didnt need advice, I never asked for advice. I finished on my Junkie heavy gunner first try at 6:50. It took three tries with my bloody guy to get it done in 7:10. I never said it was hard, just that it is an annoying mechanic based on the objectives of the event.
---
Are you a troll, or are you really that stupid and bad at reading comprehension?
---
Touche
---
You complete sausage
---
There’s definitely something buggy going on at fertile soil, I’ve been out of clear view of any gutsy and I still receive melee damage. 
---
I didn’t see anything shooting at me, and normally their ranged damage has a much greater hit damage than melee.
---
On PS4 you just it L1 once and it drops it to zero and from there it’s very easy to set the price at 5 to 15 caps. I like to hang out at camps where the prices are too high and get in area chat to tell people that the prices in this  camp are out of control and come to my camp.
---
Yet, you didn't offer any help. Just whining about "manors" no one owes you.
---
I know that feeling. Stopped playing when Borderlands 3 cames out and fml this was disgusting. At first no vats. This was my biggest problem at first always hitting the vats button but there was no vats lol. 
---
Second problem for me was I always switch between 1st and 3th person view depending on my environment. Most of the time 3th person. Also no option.
---
But at the end it's just a 1 or 2 delay until your back/good again in other games haha.
---
At this point all my chars have the plan - except the one who uses melee weapons 😩
---
I think the Wendigos stagger you. This happens to me and for a second or two I can’t fire, so I run like hell until I can recover/reload then get back at it. If you get swarmed by them during ACP it’s bad news.
---
What? Maybe in a different game? 76 Adventure mode isn't about pvp... and even if it was, once you're level 50 it's all about gear.
---
Ive got thousands of the stuff. I know i will never run out.
---
You suck ;-P
---
No, it's not the source, it just adds to the overall bashing damage that gets applied to each bullet, thus making the magic a tad bit stronger.
---
I usually don't go under 40hp, i don't see any more benefits when i go lower.
---
When on a team resilient isn't to bad, i did it solo when it first dropped, took me 36 min to finish it😒
---
It was my first run I've gotten better since but that first run scared me
---
I see the same thing, since the uptade people stoped buying ammo from my vendors. Before that, 50 cal, 5'56 and. 45 for one caps were seeling fast.
---
This is the video I followed, a little easoer if you have FO 1st. You can get a chamce for two spawns. I also tried having a friend in the world and me flogging, but relogging didn't work.
---
https://youtu.be/yI_gmBX-oss
---
I don't usually jump on board with the people who say to get better, but in the case of ACP, I don't think another answer exists.
---
With the time limit and player limit, you're kind of stuck having to be able to do more than your fair share of damage in case others can't.
---
Yeah man I’ve seen them go for good trades/ max or near max caps so definitely keep ahold of them
---
As long as you don't step into a workshop!
---
At the very least it would be nice if all wall mounted pictures had a desktop version.  I could make some use of that.
---
More proof that the inventory needs more / more specific categories tbh. Though the inconsistencies between pipboy and camp icons are befuddling anyway.
---
I'm sorry your stupid too
---
New to building, is there a build limit to how many you can use?  I like how they look and want to use them as indoor lamps.
---
I’ve had one pug do this, it was SO much better. When getting scared we’d just run backwards a metre and then get right back to shooting. A+++ wish everyone did it
---
Lady Janets is the best place I found for finding the Travelling Responder Bot. Fast travel there, kill the handful of ghouls then head to the right down the road (West i think) a little till you find an overturned Whitespring bus. Thats the spawn point. Theres about 6-8ish random encounters possible there. If you dont get the responder bot, leave, do something else for a bit then revisit. Theres no need to reload the server until you get the bot. The Hunters Long Coat is still pretty rare appearance in his inventory so you are going to have to keep trying a while
---
Just do events and daily’s. They all give you stims.
---
What got me was the boss at the end...trying to get close to hit it with those twin guns'o'doom was insane, just kept getting chewed to pieces. Eventually it ended up I had to jump up to the second level from a sign landing behind it while it was shredding my teammates.
---
There really is no harm in resetting the ini files.  I would delete them and let them get rebuilt on verify.  At least rules out any changes in them
---
I’d say 30k is still a decent deal! And the Fireman set is crazy hard to get a hold of I just got a hold of both pieces finally and I traded a legacy for the helmet and over 100k worth of trades for the jacket, definitely a white whale for me haha!
---
Ah, yes that's a great point!
---
I never go to workshops when others are there, and if I take one for a challenge I leave right after.
---
Thank you 🙏
---
Because NW is just the step-child. To get out of beta it would need massive cheat protection.
---
I'm in the minority that enjoyed it.  It's good fun having to have your tank, healer and melee specialist working together.
---
I just tried that.  The game still crashes at the same spot and when I go back into that folder it is now empty.  I guess the game is not loading far enough to recreate them?
---
Works out great for me because they use energy weapons.  With electric absorption perk, I often take zero damage and my power armor has been running on the same fusion core for over a week now.
---
Yeah there's really not much strategy for him. He's just a big ol sponge
---
I’m not 100% sure on the value but I’m sure those are one of the rarer ones! I’m sure someone a bit more knowledgable will have a price for you though!
---
It is a fun game to get naked, drink a Nukashine and find your way home afterwards without the map and only use what you find on your way.
---
Omfg.... L1....This whole time....
---
I just tried that. The game still crashes at the same spot and when I go back into that folder it is now empty. I guess the game is not loading far enough to recreate them?
---
The thing that happens next at that stage is it tries to login to your account 
---
Can you try turning off windows firewall real quick just to rule that out?
---
Could ya help me started yesterday having trouble with the fire breather quest pm me pls
---
Not even bothering with daily op if the resilient mutation is active
---
That’s the case for pc but how many cheaters are there on console?
---
Holy shit I love you 😂
---
Bruh we died before the second circle closed in, Im terrible at NW think Im rank 1 maybe two at most
---
That would be my guess.  It’s looking network related let’s focus there?   Are you running any VPN software?  3rd party firewalls?
---
I agree with you.  I used to decorate somewhat like this, but then I realized people will have no idea what it is.
---
Then I started using wall mounts inside the white glass shelf, displaying pistols.  Which looked great, but was kinda budget heavy.
---
Now I only display my fancy rifle above my fireplace.   👍
---
‘-‘
---
I've gone in full team just formed full bond.. no one else joins so I start solo, take about 9mins to finish it and realize 2 other just joined. Not sure if they got the rewards or not but find it strange when I'm going around collecting ammo I start seeing '????' Emotes. This is on Xbox I've experienced multiple times.
---
That's just bad luck man. 
---
Are you on PS4? I'll buy a single 1 cap ammo from you every day buying from a player vendor is a S.C.O.R.E. challenge.
---
That could be a cool 7 caps a week.
---
Oh hey, I've got a few other those. Time to unload the 5mm and shred away those tears!
---
The friendly gods ate up your sacrifice
---
People are more likely to hesitate when there are big numbers involved.
---
Magic guns are OP for this.
---
I think that it will be one of those beta's forever cases.
---
Hey I’ve played since launch and have right at 2000 hours play time and I didn’t know about L1 until 2 months ago. Just like I didn’t know holding down the O button will back you out of a computer UI without going back to each previous screen.
---
What are you shooting a rocket launcher? You can dump 15 rounds in 2 seconds in commando.
---
Yeah, after a few of the plans that I really wanted I have I gave up  and haven't looked back. Sure the SS armor is cool but not worth the time for me...it's a video game. Sure I like to putter around and kill stuff, maybe find or trade for a cool legendary item(I don't much care about camp plans or outfits) but I'm not devoting that much time and energy to this grindfest. YMMV.
---
Just get the secret service armor.
---
Actual dr and er on armor has diminishing returns. Once you get above 300 or so you gotta start thinking about perks that negate hits.
---
The only possible way right now to use pistols is full bloodied sneak build with level 4 follow through and with every tiny bit of damage squeezed out of your perks and buffs. Try switching to commando or heavy weapon for now and just level up for legendary perks. Even without any perks you'll do more damage this way than with pistols. And since you are not using stealth and bloodied, pistols will be pure pain and suffering.
---
At this point I will try dancing in a mushroom circle if it would work.
---
I turned it off on domain network, private network and public.
---
Still nothing.
---
5.56 always sells. I have about 55k rounds, but I will buy it every single time I see it at 1 cap each.
---
There is no way that guy is you, ur on ps4 im on xbox, I clipped the guy with the emote to find him in another game
---
Never encountered a single cheater on ps4. I don't even think it's possible on consol
---
It wouldn't be so miserable if this game REGISTERED MELEE HITS CORRECTLY. Can't tell you how many times I hit the enemy and SEE damage numbers but no change to his health. Repeat sometimes up to 5 times before a hit actually registers
---
Pistols need to have a way low AP usage rate and a massive buff to critical damage. I think this is reasonable and likely easy to implement.
---
I will keep that in mind when I find more of them.
---
Scrip vendor daily limit definitely should be increased. It's no longer endgame currency, and we are getting legendaries from everything now. Makes no sense that they kept it where it was before.
---
In general, daily limits should be abolished replaced with weekly caps per currency. Dailies are f2p mobage territory; a full-fledged game like this should not think in such daily limits at all.
---
I completely forgot to add the underarmor to the list! I spaced on adding it because it was the first thing I purchased and I've never taken it off since. 250gb and another 200gb for the shielded lining if I remember it right. You are 100% correct, its an amazing addition to the setup with the highest UA defense bump and the SPECIAL boost is perfect as a melee character. I do miss the marine wetsuit effect.  
---
The Shielded lining +4STR +4END +2PER  is also the perfect counter balance to my nearly maxed mutation setup (excluding Herbivore &amp; Empath). STR and END are the only stats mutations don't have positive numbers for so this is the perfect addition.  
---
I wasn't sure if I should add the seasons gold due to randomness of person to person progress, but you're right I should include that as incentive to use it for that extra bullion bump. Thanks!
---
Cause i have to clarify i'm aware they bought bungie not the game which means they can work on the game and have right to it...
---
P.S Geez "grammar nazi" Much 😂🤣
---
Now hear me out, have it be the regular apiary, but if you provide the honeybeast Royal jelly, one would spawn which would be loyal to you.
---
Nope.  No VPN and just normal windows firewall.
---
It is why i finally gave up.
---
I will have to try this later once I figure out if I can do it.
---
Uranium Fever classic, but also during the "Queen" hunt after a nuke drop...  
---
I usually use a double barrel shotgun in Uranium Fever, except on legendary (44 pistol), so the other guys can enjoy the loot...
---
IT DOES WHAT NOW?!
---
Oh wow. Didn’t realize angry turtle had weighed in, I’ll go check it out. Thanks a lot!
---
As a one Cap seller. I love seeing people buy the ammo up. Makes me happy to know it's being used up properly :)

It’s kind of option of last resort. But windows 10 has a refresh option to install win10 clean.   If you don’t have a ton of apps it could be worth resetting OS to rule out any hidden changes malware etc
---
Instanced CAMP spaces are coming to the PTS soon
---
Can you imagine the budget a Mirelurk Queen would take. It would be cool to see her little ones chasing enemies from your camp though.
---
I know right? When I was told about that I couldn’t believe that I had never known that. Knowing that makes the silo run faster.
---
Check out the FO76 website
---
Im not sure if this is satire but heres a downvote
---
Yes.  Any button I push on the "Push any Button" screen crashes the game.
---
Is the computer domain joined?
---
Generally I’d like this as well, but I’m willing to bet my Strangler Heart armor that some dupers or otger nefarious people will find a way to abuse it...
---
Like, one bad line of code and some jackass could probably clear out my stash or something 👀
---
Looks like you need some "manors" yourself before asking others.
---
They just joined the event🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Highly recommend a vampires flamer. It's incredibly efficient, not only will you walk out with the stims, but also 500-1000 extra flamer fuel you didn't have before. Not to mention its got really good power when you max damage out with a napalm tank and vaporization Nozzle (takes away range but so worth it). Aiming for the head works wonders as well. Don't use vats, it never works with it. The first few days of daily ops found a cheap lvl 40 1 star vamp flamer and that thing still wrecked. If you can get one with the "magic" prefix for added support when taking on the daily ops bosses. The most important thing tho that I can say about it is thats it an fun as hell. 
---
Oh yeah run in PA to take less damage. And lvl5 or 3 gunsmith is required to ease repairs.
---
At least you acknowledge that you killed it too fast.
---
Yeah I have thought about that option.  The computer is new (I got it in July) so there is not yet a lot installed.  I am kind of saving this as a last resort.
---
I just bash them in the face lol
---
Totally understand
---
Prime LMG. Prime .50 cal. Prome Gatling Plasma. Which of these favorited weapons are the same? Hmm?
---
😂
---
Those are words and I am sure they have meaning but I do not understand what you just said =)
---
It was rhetorical.
---
If you do too much damage the hp rubber bands back up or something
---
Next to impossible to do with the EULA that Sony/Microsoft have.  The console providers need to be able to control all accounts on their systems.  Xbox and PC might get cross play but it is doubtful Sony would.
---
DCUO, which was owned by Sony at one point, instituted cross play between pc/ps  but couldn't get Xbox into the mix because of the Xbox Live EULA.  I can't see this as being different.
---
Plus as PC is hacked to shit why would console players want their game impacted by hackers?
---
I own the full set. Wasnt worth it at all.
---
Hear me out, new pvp modes outside of the Battle Royal. Imagine a one in the chamber style mode, vault team deathmatch, capture the flag, etc. For it everyone is treated as equals, no fancy perk cards, just stock vault dwellers.
---
Back when, I got out of my power armor after an event. The guy I had been teamed up with just said "Oh hell no!" And he logged off. Guess he didn't like clowns. 
---
Some of the outfits are just a tad psychopathic. Good times!
---
Many critters drop stimpacks, radaways, etc, especially around WS.
---
Alternately, loot the Medical building in charleston, or the quarantine area hangers around morgantown.
---
  Consider the healing factor mutation.  It will restore you to full health (less rads) within 15 seconds or so of combat ending and no threats detected.  Combine that with a vampire weapon, and your stimpack usage will be really low.
---
The ArmCO Ammunition Construction Appliance is the best way to get 5.56 ammo. Get 200 every ~1 hour right out of thin air, no power required.
---
I know when people are looking for a dig, like u did.  Il reply in kind, never said I was that nice.  The smart answer would have been 20 minutes sorting out a build would save tons of time and stress,  but you probably have some sarcastic reply to that too
---
I will come back here when you're wrong
---
What do you thing the responses helmet is worth on it's own?
---
What AV are you running?  Some anti exploit can cause problems but I’m running anti exploit from paloalto and Malwarebytes with no issues.  It’s like it won’t sign you into store
---
Do you have MFA enabled on Bethesda account?
---
Every 20 hours. And yes they are all linked.
---
i'm just glad someone knew i was joking tbh
---
Hahah this brings back fond memories of saints row 😂😂
---
There also a human npc trader that will have the rare outfits the bot carries I ran into her in a couple different spots just so you know
---
Ah yeah the vats, I forgot about that :D. Thats my choice tho to perma use vats, so I wont be too mad about that one hehe.
---
It not selling as much on my camp on ps4 
---
Most of my sales come from legendary weapons/armor which I’m selling at vendor prices just to move inventory
---
The magic weapons are the problem almost. It has nothing to do with bloodied builds lol.
---
Even if it's the case the guy used a shit ton of Chems food ect to get the dmg output which is just a perfect end game build
---
It's not the point if bullets are cheap or not. Solution to 1-2 sec server delay, shouldn't be to stop shooting to save ammo.
---
I have the standard windows AV and have not installed any new AV since I last played the game.
---
I do not have MFA enabled.
---
Exactly what I used too. Mine was also 90WR. It is almost like a shovel for the burial quest or shepherd crook for herding. If you have a 90WR there is no reason not to keep it in your inventory for this.
---
I'd also point out that resilient robot DOP is also an opportunity to get your 30 robots killed with assualtron blade for opposum badge.
---
It’s not joined to a work network?  Microsoft azure ad?   Probably not.
---
First time hearing about this particular bug then, so just report it and hope for the best.
---

---
Cheers
---
I'm on pc, but gonna buy console, thinking about xbox series x.
---
Nice, good point.
---
Wait what oh you literally described the exact thing that happened to me the other day
---
Yea after switching my build I almost never used vats again. And this alone is noticeable in other games haha
---
What happens in the divide stays in the divide.
---
So you suggest a workaround and not a fix? Ok, Bethesda employee.
---
You using melee? And what's it like on the ghouls at acp?  These are the questions that I ask while I script away
---
My ass.
---
No, it has been duped in mass.
---
I traded a B/E/25 Legacy Laser Rifle for mine and I did a price check and it seemed like it was an even trade, so it’s worth one of the more common legacies, or some good rolls on good guns, it depends who’s looking to buy it more than anything but it’s in pretty consistent high demand.
---
Pretty sure they patched that method with the latest update since this update didn't have the hotfix that re-enabled it before
---
Yes, they're delicious!!!!
---
Does no one else think this scaling is bullshit though?
---
Man.  Your not making this easy.   Other games work?  Just to verify direct x is working?
---
LOL
---
From what I can see, you are just describing that people are using magic weapons, also bloodied is only a little better than junkies now
---
No.  It just hooked up to my home network that I have always played on.
---
It's hard to respond with anything to this word soup to be honest.
---
Same here, there were a few level 7's at the purveyors house and I dumped them hundreds of ammo I picked up from doing four daily ops in a row.  Since it was a melee event I got all kinds of ammo I can't use.
---
Oh, you mean like the tens of thousands of reports they got for the fast travel bug? Or the infinite respawn?
---
I put all my extra masks in my vendor for 76 caps each and they all sold out.
---
Thats unfortunate, did you find anything in the windows event log? Otherwise I would suggest to do what /u/Thalarius suggested to rule out a network issue. If you don't have an option for WiFi-Thetering maybe some neighbour (with a different Provider) with WLAN could help out, or use VPN (there are some free ones around, just to nail down it is/isn't your ISP/network).
---
Targeting HUD is still a rare one too
---
Right?  This was the opposite of relaxing after work.
---
Can’t be two shot and Bloodied? Has to be one or the other.....
---
How do you even know it was bloodied? With sneak bonuses and concentrated fire fucked it’s hard to pull close to what we could before. Maybe it’s magic weapons or legacies but don’t go wildly accusing people who work hard on their build and trade like mad people in order to get good damage, just because Beth made every other build pointless.
---
I’m that heavy gun type.. I normal wait a few before shooting so other get claim but I’m not waiting for everyone
---
Only 1 person in the group need to claim
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=59345ff&amp;d=ad2ak2al2a72a32l71lu2lt2lv2ld2lk0ic4eh2p02pj2s01sb2c72pb2&amp;n=Pistol this is a pretty decent set up for a casual player, it’s based more in vats but once you start playing around with concentrated fire and gunfu I think your stance on vats change. Of course you can always just switch cards around to more suit your play style
---
Two shot bloodied explosive eh?
---
And made a huge mistake. I have one with flechette mod and it's amazing.
---
Depending on where you are, you can accomplish a lot in those 2 seconds.
---
In that time frame with my SS ghoul slayers switchblade, I can kill (at least) 4 ghouls at RR.
---
That's mad, I been hopping mirrors for literally months since yabvone bit up his guide on here, still haven't got the plan
---
And here i am doing the opposite, hoping armor is the damn leather coat I've been looking for for months! Either one
---
Like why lie?
---
And while Monster Mash has very good loot drops and legendary rates I have had maybe three matches where random players show up out if maybe a hundred total in the last six months.  My friends and I love the event but no one joins.
---
Lol Fake news for so many reasons. But grats on scripping an explosive Harpoon. Not like they are extremely over powered haha
---
I have played Skyrim (When we had power and no net) and I have played No Man's Sky (Which I downloaded once we got net back).  I don't know if NMS counts as an online game.
---
Rob I do want to say thank you for trying to help.  I really appreicate it.  FO76 is one of my 2 main hobbies with the pandemic so it would really be nice to get back to it.

I dont like harpoon guns also im too lazy to sell weapons
---
I didnt. I just really dont like harpoon guns
---
That's the one, 0 game knowlage involved, just a sarcastic comment
---
1. No you didn't. Blooded and two shot on the same weapon isn't a thing unless it's a hacked pc item.
---
2. With the flechette mod, the harpoon gun is overpowering and you'll never run out of ammo, so long as you scavenge your kills. The only downside is that you'll rely on VATS to land your shots. It can one shot enemies on daily ops.
---
You got a Dense mod installed in your brain?
---
It does happen, but i only see it in 1 out of 10 uranium fever events. Usually if you have 4 or less people, everyone's pretty cool about it.
---
It was a while ago and i remember it had three amazing boosts. I know for a fact it was bloodied
---
I just went in with my Assassins Deathclaw, my teammates were shooting and throwing grenades at them to get their health down then I finished them off.
---
The gun you stated doesn’t exist mate...
---
Bloodied melee, I have a video on YouTube of the perks I run but I don't show that particular armor set because I have another one i believe is better. Any full set of unyielding armor is pretty good. Toward the end of [the video](https://youtu.be/XIHXXfCaBgE)
---
I dont understand this part:
---
Other posts are pointing at NAT type.
---
I have my own router.  Same router I have been playing the game on for over a year.
---
Yup
---
Well, two shot bloodied guns don't exist, so I believe you have.
---
What is the windows event log?
---
Death law. Love it
---
ahhh gotcha. idk why i never thought of it in that way but you do have very solid points. i didnt about meta plays. especially being solo i need them heavy hitters haha also not a fan of many heavy weapons. i do see a lot of people rocking the same shit which is kinda sad it would be nice to be able to switch things up and still have fun. Maybe one day things will be different haha thanks for the input. i just recently started playing again after a year hiatus so im just now learning all this.
---
I remember that there was a bloodied harpoon gun with two hella awesome boosts. It was a while ago so i kinda forgot the other ones.
---
It’s so goddamn slow. I took off super duper too and that seems to help...a tiny bit. Now I usually dump it all and let others pick it up if they want.
---

---
Don’t get offended, salty food build.
---
It was a while ago and i forgot the two other boosts but i do remember they were one of the best boosts and it was def bloodied
---
The fireman outfit is a fixed spawn. You can literally farm it  I had 3 of both and sold one of them. Its not that rare
---
Would it help if I posted the log from the bethesda launcher that Support keeps asking for?  I can pull one now and post it if it will help.
---
Ah, the more you know. Thanks mate
---
It tough but it a good thing and I hope more daily become just as challenging.. this make you think about tactics with your group
---
My group probably failed the 8min mark 3 times yesterday before we came to the conclusion to run 3 melee 1 heavy gun
---
I was running my HG build Gatling leaser , I blaze them up and they pick them up. We also notice that we can’t ignore them because they do lots of dmg in numbers so we clear a few as we were moving
---
I don’t understand the point in this post.
---
Hahahaha I gun bash in PA with a gatplas and don't have any of that, your Def making shit up right there
---
I think a lot of us have done it, just not intentionally. It happened yesterday to me during a primal cuts event. Gun Fu kicked in, and I went from one wolf to a legendary wolf, before I could react it was dead. Thankfully it was only 1 star.
---
You’re thinking of a different set, the Responders Fireman Set is a very rare spawn from specific dailies
---
Jesus
---
Not offended. Actually a very optimized junkies pa heavy gunner.
---
But ultracite weapons don't deal bounse damage to scorched. That is a common misconception. But an ult gat laser has a high base damage than a normal gat laser. And is a pretty great weapon
---
Thats the part im confused about. Its instanced to groups, you can't fit 10 players into a single instance.
---
Or shoot the floor if you have explosive for that tiny splash damage.
---
You can shoot them and finish them with bash damage.
---
That’s part of the Xbox game bar.   You can try to clear the invite. Or perhaps disable the Xbox game bar service.  That’s a bit tachnical.  I could walk you through it.
---
I always make sure to set any ammo that isn't a plasma core, fusion core, or mini nuke to 1 cap. Those cores and nukes are usually 10-20 caps each. If I could set the ammo to like 0.5 cap each, or make ammo bundles that I could sell....Like a trade deal I made with a friend. I'd sell things like 1500 5.56 ammo for 600 caps. Because it really doesn't take much to make that ammo, and I have a ridiculous stockpile of materials for it at this point.
---
You can bash them with ranged weapons.
---
Gun Bash works too doesn't need to be only a melee weapon :)
---
One time I scripped a junkies quad explosive ffr fatboy railway rifle shotgun just cuz.
---
No idea about the other weapons, but the bow is even worse now. The first vats shot was always a guaranteed miss, but shoting again/swaping targets fixed it. Was really frustating, but got "used" to it.
---
Now not even that works. I missed 5 shots in a row on the same target. I thought it was just bad luck, but happened again with the next target, and again, and again, and again... Threw my bow on my stash and haven't touched it again since then.
---
I got all the sets already, just wanted the thorn 4th perk for the melee .  How about at Earl? Does it help with the ghouls in any way, or at least tag them so u can get a mate to spray u quick? That stagger mades me swap to unarmed quck to mop up, but hopeing this could tag so someone else can kill them quicker
---
That’s hilarious!
---
Luck hole mine + excavator PA will yield you almost 600 lead ore if you find all the nodes.
---
Plus more crystal than you can use, likely a legendary weapon or two...and a few other things.
---
Ohhh that makes sense. I mean they're both names Fireman outfit so I guess I got them mixed up lol
---
I am really good at following instructions.  That is why I have not "accidently" died in my sleep as my wife informs me =)  I am willing to give it a shot.
---
I replied to one of your other responses would me posting the log that Bethesda Support keeps asking for help you?  I can pull a new one right now and post it for ya.
---
Ironically Fallout Shelter, their mobile game, doesn't even have these kinds of caps on things.
---
Do people not know that they can scrip generally good weapons to get the one that fits their build?
---
I warn the boozehounds coming to my camp with ‘Feeling Lucky, Drunk?’ sign over my punch bowl.
---
I read this as ceiling pants and got excited
---
that’s a bug, m8 :). you teleport just once. I’ve been draining nukashines from peoples bowls since this combo was created.
---
[deleted]
---
I loot literly everything. I havent been to the forest for a very long time due to ebemie levels ash heap I was there a bit for breach and clear and battle bot events. So I spent most of my time in the mire, savage divide and cranberry bog. The mire has a real nice route for legendary enemies so I go there multiple times a day and its also worked into my chem and booze run which starts in the mire.
---
Pain train could honestly use a little love, especially now
---
I proposed dual tip melee weapons. You should be able to convert a rolling pin into nunchucks as an advanced mod. Also convert the spear into double pointed to double the swing speed. Things like this.
---
Gallifreyan tech at it's best!
---
It’s a nightmare I’ve panic bought so many of the wrong suit from vendors haha, the rate set has a white helmet and a blue uniform
---
I agree with you. they've always been absolutely tiny compared to every other aaa studio. this buy-out just means they have more people and resources than ever, meaning they can bite off what they currently bite off, except now they can actually chew it!
---

---
That sounds like it indeed.
---
I guess try to put those files back into the folder. After doing that, open the 'fallout76.ini' file using wordpad. Under the heading '[Display]', there should be two lines:
---
bFull Screen = 0 or 1
---
bBorderless = 0 or 1
---
Try to set it to:
---
bFull Screen = 0
---
bBorderless = 1
---
Then save the file.
---
Basically I'm trying to see if fullscreen mode could be the issue, so we're trying to run the game in borderless window using the in-game settings to see if that works at all.
---
there is no I in team
---
there is however an I in d**i**e, also **i**n, and f**i**re so that's a trifecta of some sort
---
It was a fuckin joke? A completely made up gun just like your post.
---
I'll settle for one instanced bunker of a fair size, that won't have random strangers gaining access to it by using PA to go through my CAMP walls, I'm not concerned with them causing any damage, it's just rude.  
---
And for the record, I have all workbenches outside my CAMP, with stash box, scrapbox and even a Sympto-Matic.  
---
I'm English, and my CAMP is my home, not a free for all to every one that wanders by.
---
Ah yes let's add a way to set traps randomly for new or old players just by leaving some junk on the ground.
---
Lol yes, if I hopped into my power armor, stacked some chems and food, and grabbed a more appropriate weapon then soloing earl would be possible without swapping perks. But that's not how I play the game and soloing the team oriented end-game bosses isn't one of my goals.
---
OP wanted to be more competitive and now we're talking about soloing earl lol. I was only calling you out on heavy high agility and demeaning tone, where high agility absolutely has a place in any build depending on your goals.
---
True, if you were min-maxing for pure damage then point swaps need to be made, but I like survivability outside of PA for that sweet sweet carry weight and XP.
---
That would look great on my qe25 handmade dammit
---
Are you sprinting or getting hit?
---
I killed them and was that annoyed I almost forgot the photo when I left
---
Camouflage is the worst for me cause i can use vats, resilient i juts find a team and if someone shoots i just go melee and finish what he shots at.
---
I'm justbin my campalso listening to ring of fire
---
I sprint a bit but nothing drastic. Plus with power user you would think the use would be pretty good. I’ve used 7 in an hour and a half.
---
If it will fit.   I have to get ready for work soon.  I can look at it tonight
---
This man speaks the truth.  
---
This things are soloable on Elder.  All the tools to do it are right there with gear/perks.
---
Iphone.  But it’s not wrong.
---
Ok?
---
Presuming you aren't running "Taking one for the team" with someone on the team not in pacifist.
---
And as long as you don’t pick a player owned lock.
---
Haha such a funny prank. I keep Nukashine in my kegs and ever now and then have someone that comes along. Got it from happening to me once, was hilarious.
---
Sell the lead for 2caps, trust me people will eat it up
---
after 22 1 shot 1 kill only on magic weapons.
---
I think it's just random
---
Ssshhhhhh! Someone's gonna hear!
---
Yea sorry this chain is so fragmented.   :)
---
I’m on iPhone.  Just replying.
---
I honestly haven't tried that yet 🤔
---
Caps are all linked, but inventories are not linked.
---
I havnt left my PA once and havnt even used 10% of one
---
My 45 and 5.56 for 1 cap each, 50cal and 2mm will stay 2 each and full plasma/Fusio cores at 10 each still sell albeit slower. 
---
People can just farm the daily ops over and over and get hundreds of ammo at the end by just switching to the desired weapon to kill the last boss and prompt the reward screen.
---
Yeah I feel you. My question is, many people say don’t use it everyday but only for boss fight, but is it really worth it to spend 2K ammo for a boss gives you 2 random flux? I don’t think so
---
Im thinking with the new legendary perks and a few normal ones you could even make a healing tank provided you have vampires and medics weapons.
---
Even if we got our own greenhouse, that would be cool
---
Just type in 'Event Viewer' in the windows search bar and it should find it for you, it is a built-in tool for any non-ancient Windows to review events like errors. At first launch it may take a while to gather the information. Once its running expand the icon Windows Logs and look through 'Application' and 'System' Events for errors. With some luck (depends on the application) an error message is generated when an app crashes, maybe you can find a reason there like sound/graphic driver
---
In that case, functional examples would be: [Hoop Shot,](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Hoop_Shot) [Atomic Rollers,](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Atomic_Rollers) [Whac-a-Commie,](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Whac-a-Commie) [Nuka-Zapper Race.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Nuka-Zapper_Race)
---
Specific functional arcade cabinet examples can be found with the [Arcade Workshop Pack Creation.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Creation_Club#World)
---
I know all of that. Just because I understand Bethesda’s choices doesn’t negate the fact that those choices won’t work for everyone’s idea of what is and isn’t a camp. Not everyone wants an underground bunker. Not everyone can incorporate that concept into their current base.
---
Yep, I paid for Fallout 1st for about 3 months, got all the NCR Ranger outfits, hardcore grinded to top my box up with as much lead, steel, screws and aluminium as I could. I can play the game and not worry about being unable to repair my armor and guns, with very minimum looting.
---
Can you give us an example of what you would like your gameplay to be? Examples, bloodied, full HP, melee, ranged, shotgun, pistol, rifle, Power Armor, heavy weapons.
---
Agree with others - Meat Week.  
---
At this point in my characters evolution, repeatedly doing meat week for Treasury Notes has a higher value than whatever I'd get for running a nuke zone.
---
Put them back.  Both were set to 1.  Set it up as you said and still crashing in the same spot.
---
I kind of did the same thing using Nvidia.  I was playing around with borderless, windowed, etc... which is how I found that weird thing at the bottom of my post.
---
What they are doing is total shit either way. Their system would be like a hospital that is going out of business starts breaking people’s kneecaps if they try to leave then says they did them a favour by stitching them back up. They keep people coming back everyday because they pump out timed atom shop bullshit. Honestly it pisses me off so much that bugs stay in the game forever but every week the atom shop has a full update. But the fan base is to blame too because you guys buy into their shit. I quit playing the game at level 82 of the first season for this exact reason. The feeling like I had to log in everyday just in the hopes I would buy something off the atom shop was getting old.
---
I dont mind it being there, those that want to do.it can and there are resources for those that dont
---
So much this! Maybe I would try Harpoon Gun then because it's slow reload speed and it's 'magazine' holding only one harpoon is a joke. Broadsizer could also have some love. Blackpowder rifle should have scope mod since these actually existed in real life.
---
Instead of just giving more guns, buff unused ones as well.
---
Is it random when you take stuff or does it drink by the irder you placed the drinks?
---
I’ve given away at least 20 each in a drop bag next to my vendor, along with many other plans. They won’t sell even at the lowest prices.
---
People’s prices are beyond greedy into pure delusional.
---
They patched it out. However, there was a big backlash so they reinstalled it. I was able to do the trick just yesterday.
---
I always take one regardless lol.
---
Definitely use to work on Liberators.
---
You missed the downside where you'll be repairing an explosive flechette pooner every 20 shots or so.  As long as you are swimming in repair kits it's awesome, fun to use, and so much free ammo.
---
Agree! Something is def up with the robot spawn numbers. Waves upon waves of smashed metal being dumped. They are the most dangerous too with their piercing rounds..
---
That said, as a melee main and side big guns, it's just a waterfall of experience :)
---
Awesome, I'll give it a try.
---
NOOO if only i knew that it gave so much meat :(
---
Let me know if you do!
---
Are you on PC? If you do I have lots of stimpaks I need to get rid of. Been looking out for low levels but can't seems to find them. I have few Vampire Melee weapon to get rid off too if you want them.
---
It is a choice one makes to race to complete leveling up legendary perks, or having some build flexibility.
---
I was just thinking the same🤔
---
&gt;  try to get a anti armor or instigating effect for a legendary if it is possible
---
Bloodied is not worth using anymore?
---
The helmet, while pricy, has an AWESOME light.
---
Due to the daily ops. I use shotguns more than other weapons. And I go in with 200 rounds. Blast to my hearts content then walk out with 450 rounds. I figure the ops drops rounds that you use? Havent tried with a different gun yet.
---
Never had that happen, I used a piece of armor that was auto stim a while ago being it bad weapon weight reduction and it was annoying so I took it off. But you said you don’t have that so I don’t know. Is there any perks that do that?
---
This happened to me while on a team.  Someone was sharing Born Survivor.  Maybe this?
---
I'm not sure if I 100% agree with that, especially since the codes aren't solved "legitimately" when they are posted. Yeah, you could say the option is there if people want to do it, but I consider that a weak reason when there's no benefit or requirement to do so.
---
I had 3 of them, I used one and traded one last night I still have one. Message me so we don’t get it trouble
---
I literally reinstalled last night.
---
What's this ammo machine thing? I'm building a heavy gunner and I love those old crank guns so that's what I intend to main. They are 5mm I think.
---
The entire process is fucking tedious. I'd rather it be a proper dungeon as opposed to tedious tasks while being pelted by turrets.
---
Yeah. I have one spear that I refuse to use until I find some others to dismantle. Are there no mods for them? It would also be nice if outfits could be upgrade with ballistic fiber, etc like in FO4. Why just the under armor, etc. I suppose we ask for too much.
---
If you kill ticks with butcher bounty you can make some with their blood
---
Late 60s would be the wrong time period for the game as it is largely inspired by 50/early 60s plus licensing would be expensive.
---
Agreed that this particular weapon needs a buff. its the 'rarer' variant of the standard laser and as such should ( I believe) slightly outperform the standard laser, even if it was balanced with a slightly lower total durability bar. As it stands there is no reason to use this over the regular laser, ever.
---
Do you use a Jetpack on your PA?
---
Of course, to each his own. I'd like to streamline everything as much as possible, so as to focus on things I enjoy in F76 - and they don't include picking stuff and grinding events...
---
Max in an instance is 8 people. Bosses don't scale, so if the team had a bunch of folks under level 50, it can fail. Usually one high level can carry it though if they can do enough damage. The embers and environmental stuff down there does not affect him, just have to start blastin'.
---
Well i just want to understand which build works and how.
---
Anyway i love revolver and i find stealth and vats boring, i prefer aim (i'm on PC), i don't want to be tank, i prefer focus on dmg.
---
But as i said i'm new so i really don't know amything about builds and i'm glad to know any build that can work or a site where i can relax about them.
---
I tend to cheat with a legacy or magic weapon.  Just enough to keep the pace from being monotonous. Most people don’t even notice when I jump in and drop earls health by a fifth or so before going back to farming wendigos.
---
I use the first three so I never sell it, but the .45 goes pretty much as fast as I can stock it.
---
You don't pull that off with magic weapons if you are not bloodied. Magic weapon damage scale with your damage bonuses so bloodied builds wielding magic weapons deal about 5 times other builds using magic weapons
---
This is way beyond time to implement *anyway*, regardless of CAMP shelters. Too many locations on the map require us to sit through two loading screens in quick succession, if not immediately. Overseer's house, Valley Galleria, Crater Core - just to name a few. Long press on the map icon to directly load into the interior is such an obvious solution, I can't fathom why we don't have it yet. Is there some way too complicated screw-up in the code that prevents this?...
---
The way diablo 3 did it was good. You can change 1 thing on it and that's it and it gets more expensive each time you roll it again.
---
Ty for fast reply!
---
Is vats so strong in comparison to aim?
---
I'm really glad for you present but in on pc.
---
I'd honestly like some variation of the code fragments you collect from the officers be something you have to deposit to "unlock" the silo for the week, but then there'd have to be more of a benefit to nuke zones to make them worthwhile. The silo runs themselves I don't mine too terribly much.
---
I want a mangy chimpanzee in raider gear. Jangles then Junkie
---
Every time I run into the Scavenger Trader, she does not have any outfits at ll. Don't know if that's just my bad luck or what. Found her several times at Lost Home and the camp site near anchor farm.
---
What am I missing?
---
most likely the cause
---
One dedicated server space for only pics and ONlY for pics you take with your in game camera all the pics are allready saved on there servers when I load a game my pics pop up and not the ones that are on my ps4 I’m talking the ones allready taking up server space.
---
That breaks my heart, because I’ve fallen in love with my LMG. I just can’t use it. The ammo amounts crafted are absurdly small.

Whens meat week? Didnt it already end this year?
---
Im a melee build so i dont like this idea. I can sell random ammo to other players right now. Adding an extra step will make me just ignore ammo all together.
---
Just tried it on PC, it still isn't working. Pain
---
I can't explain it. Chally might be listening.
---
I would love a bunch of public domain tunes or covers of bluegrass tunes.  I would adore getting to listen to "Solidarity Forever" or "Which side are you on" while fighting strikebreakers as both have ties to Appalachia.

Yeah, that feature is actually meaningless without the possibility to inspect...
---
Pistol builds will be really hard to take on any mobs for your entire career, and forget about doing any meaningful damage to the endgame bosses. That would be more of a fun casual character play through. Even if you had the build totally dialed in and an amazing pistol, you would still have to 4-6 shot a super mutant, and if there was 6-8 of them chasing you, would be very tough.
---
Like pre one wasteland, didn't really felt a change.
---
So I had to play it 3 times last night with a team to get elder. First time two guys I was with none would melee or even bash and kept throwing up question marks up. We finished at 9 minutes. We go again this time we get to boss and I kept melee him as they wouldn’t and all they had to do was run over and hit him once and we would’ve been done in time. Nope we finish 803. I left that team and then played with another and finally they understood and we finished 756. I had the robot one and def hate the melee one because no one wants to even when they’re in power armor and I’m not and also I’m bloodied so I have 20 health. If I’m not afraid to do it they shouldn’t. But plus of being on that first team is I went to his camp and bought the radioactive barrel for 10k. Def a steal being I never find that and I never find decent weapons except one every couple months.
---
I don't mind a grind to games if it didn't have some grind I'd get bored and move on...
---
That being said I like the idea of re engineering or something similar...
---
RNG as the gate to end game and good gear is my biggest issue with FO76. RNG for rare/desirable cosmetics and stuff is fine.
---
For example SS armor is nice we can roll a specific part and narrows the RNG but my Right arm is a 1* underlying and I've rolled this month about 80 more of that arm and haven't even gotten another 1* unyielding. It's bad enough that we have the limits on things we do but If I could take 1 arm and then reroll just a slot on it until I get what I want and eventually Make the perfect for me part and really narrow down that RNG I would be happy. Gives me something to work on with a goal in mind.
---
How many ribs come with that?
---
Nope. Emergency protocols.
---
I would settle for anything but the burrows sign plan. that seems to be all that I ever get.
---
Free aim is good but the gun fu card at a 3star level adds 10% damage per kill up to 30% so if you have high AP combined with a AP reduction gun you’ll be putting out some serious numbers, this 30% is also added to crits which can be gained fairly quickly
---
Nice
---
So its going to paste ugly.  If this does not work let me know and I can email it to you or something?
---
Oh cos it meat week, meat week Grahm love week of meat. 
---
Meat sweet, meat treat, Grahm gonna eat da meat. 
---
who gonna eat da meat? Grahm gonna eat da meat. who gonna eat da meat, humans gonna eat da meat. who not gonna eat the meat.. CHALLY! 
---
Oh cos its meat week, meat week, hmmm hmmm hm hm hm
---
Pet Sounds was ‘66 and one of those songs is in the game so I don’t think it’s that much of a stretch

Your now just getting SS armour? What have you been doing homie.

I like it; though it might cause even more logistic issues with the fact there's only 3 potential spawns per server for the Royal Jelly.

This Is so sad for me, but so what are the best builds in general? (i hope at least i can use free aim instead of vats)

The extra damage really isn't anything

I find modding rifles with a bayonet just for the ops works great, it allows you to swing a bit faster, and since stealth is useless in ops, you don't really need a suppressor.
---
Did it delete the outfit you were already wearing?
---
The licensing is the bigger issue.  No one would play the game because they added these songs so it would just be lost money.

They're out there. I see almost as many who sell at 2 caps per shot (3-4 for heavier ammo) as those that do 1 cap.
---
Well he missed the seasons and the damage rebalance, so that’s quite a bit. Also missed the massive dupe wave where like 20-40% of Xbox players got banned, then unbanned 3 weeks later because they couldn’t sort who did the banning and who just picked up duped guns.
---
Them dropping nothing valuable is the worst thing. I don't see why they couldn't at least drop a rarish mat like snallygasters, wendigos, and gulpers.
---
Isnt it an event tho?
---
A man can dream
---
Someone was likely sharing Born survivor
---
I've seen a few people join public teams with bloodied builds and then change to sharing it
---
The Gatling gun is indeed 5mm. I have a nice legendary that is my go to daily gun. But even the non legendary ones are great. 
---
The ammo machine is a camp item you can get at the end of the Wastelander’s story line. Once you obtain max reputation with the Raider faction you can purchase the plans for it with a end game currency that is part of the quest line. It’s a great resource for your camp. I have mine set to make 5mm. I’m not sure how much it makes in per hour. All I know is I leave it alone for awhile and come back and check it and I have 1000 rounds in the bin. 
---
One other thing always lock both the drop bin and the computer terminal of the machine.
---
A metric fuck ton of changes, too many to list here.
---
How do people run out of stimpacks? I have to constantly sell them just to keep 30 or less on me.
---
I feel you. With the new legendary perk maxed, the normal ammo perk and super duper you can get a decent amount. But I've always found that making ultracite .308 was a way better value than normal .308. Can make over 500 rounds in one go if you're lucky
---
Don't give out incorrect information
---
I have only failed event twice out of 50 times. First time was me and 3 players all below level 50. Second time everyone left except me and two other guys. We almost won that one but one guy was using a pitch fork and other was using a Gatling gun. And yes I said pitchfork. You just need decent damage players and ones that can tank and help clear spawn. I’m a bloodied commando so I do high damage but I also clear spawn because I love the loot from them. Just get in with ppl that know what they’re doing
---
What even is a legacy weap and whats so kmportant about it?
---
Oh yeah, that's what we need, like why the f*, I should spend 2k caps fast traveling to different merchants only to see tons of useless recipes, or absurdly overpriced things(that you don't even need), the best would be to have some sort of submenu, that will show the exact contents of the vendors in the specific camp you hovered your mouse to(fantasies, I know), but as I've been saying in my previous comments, once the official mod support will be out, the interface problems will disappear.
---
Last night I crafted my first part. Unyielding left leg with +1cha and block stuff. For me that's a win.
---
Personally, I think it should work like this:  
---
Rank 1 - Access to all crafting/durability reduction perks (gunsmith 5/expertt, master and science 1/armorer 3/makeshift warrior 5/white knight 5/etc.)  
---
Rank 2 - All perks +crafting cost reduction  
---
Rank 3 - All perks + even more crafting cost reduction + chance to not use materials (similar to super duper)  
---
Rank 4 -  All perks + even more crafting cost reduction + bigger chance to not use materials (more than rank 3)
---
You should be ok. It’s harder to aim on controller so the delay shouldn’t kill you. Using vats too much will hurt you in other games though.
---
Ugh yes. I love the extra xp and caps, but dang it is annoying.
---
Ive done the nuke launch once the way the game intended. And i hated it. Which is why i use a website that just skips a large portion of the time it should take because i dont want to wait till the end of the week (when im working) just to launch a nuke and possibly screw it up.
---
If they where to change anything why not judt chsnge it so you had to gether 8 codes that just give you the input numbers. If its unique to each player it would add an extra half an hour (if rhey make it so you can find them via pipboy instead of going to bunker each time) but would be overly tedious.
---
You can press Revenge, though..?
---
Maybe the bunker door could be like the door to the treasure room or something??
---
exactly the same feelings, man. PA tank here, but it felt like something new and challening and last, but not least - fun.  
---
however, please remember you cannot have fun while some bloodied dude in his 800's feels invalidated, we are on r/fo76 after all.
---
100-250 stimpack regs, 25 watered-down stims (forgot what they were called), 15 stim supers, an entire set of heavy BOS combat armor level 20 deep-pocketed, 100+ presents (if I have them) all my extra plans, and a bunch of junk that I might have an excessive amount of
---
So here’s what I use to do. I use to farm ticks over in the mire with butchers bounty. It sucked because you didn’t get it all the time. But then i bought the commie protectron. Set him up to get blood packs. With blood packs from him which I would get like 10 or more some times. You then use chemist in intelligence it’s only 1 point and super duper maxed out and you will craft so many stims you won’t ever have to farm them. I actually ended up just doing events and stuff now that I never run out. But back then when I was still getting use to things even with playing the game since beta it was the worst time farming stuff for stims but if you follow my guide it will help you
---
I suggest googling or going onto YouTube and searching up a few to see what looks good to you.
---
Absolutely. Pulls you out of position for the beacons, requires you to drop out of VATS, makes you get up close and personal with hordes of enemies, and that's not even discussing the absolutely shitty, janky hitboxes you have to aim for when you're buttsmacking them for the kill.
---
Like - I get it: you're supposed to build a group with a tactical approach and varying weapon styles, and use mics to communicate. But... that's not *actually* how the majority of us play this game. We play mic off, PUGs only.
---
Game is much more stable than at launch
---
Greifers are really a non issue. Slap damage and the ability to destroy others camps (outside of pvp anyway) has been disabled
---
Legacy weapons are weapons that do not exist in the game at their current combination of legendary effects. For example, I have an explosive Gatling plasma. Explosive energy weapons are no longer an item that will drop in the game. These items are over powered compared to current game weapons and so I use it sparingly when it is needed and try not to ruin people’s fun.
---
I mean, he played smart, didn't he. No risk, all the rewards.
---
Oh ok
---
I was lookin at getting the bug zapper. Is there any other effects to it or is just a blue light?
---
Pretty much pvp is non existent now. The game is 100x better than at launch. There will be ton of stuff for you to do. The game is still a mess, but in comparison to launch it has gotten exponentially better.
---
Yes but if you like the look it’s a good power armor 2nd to the t-65 I have it and I use it for nuke zones
---
All i want it to play is orange colored sky, anything goes, and wouldnt it be nice
---
It's what i'm doing from 2 hours, but i really found old things or casual build.
---
What I was thinking was along the lines that the code fragments the officers carry would change to items you have to deposit in a receptacle in the silo control room in order to unlock it for the week. Might need to be reduced from 8 if they went that route, though, but it would introduce a step that wouldn't make me want to put my head through the wall.
---
When you have a gameplay mechanic the community actively avoids at all costs, it might be time to consider rethinking it.
---
I have survival shortcut equip has i do not find anything better and it does the job easily...
---
if i get the plan it will be a solid 10000 caps in selling, solar panels, BOS suit already got sold.
---
We will see. Both of my current camps are atypical and have very little interaction with the ground. One is built into the structure of a permanent building, the other is a pirate ship floating on the lake by thunder mountain. 
---
The second one will probably not work at all since Bethesda doesn’t like us building underwater.
---
Its an event in an instanced location. So only a set amount of players can enter.
---
Or if you use a Fat Man as one of your three man weapons.
---
People talk about how much they suck, and they do, I guess, but I’m over here murdering literally 95% of groups in one shot with my instigating limb damage Fat Man like it’s a close range weapon, and silently taking out 95% of tough single targets with my instigating Dragon. High level assaultrons Only lose half the life with one shot, though.
---
I’m a lvl 140 casual player that uses no drugs, and has on light leather armor. Never touched bloodied. I don’t get people that say this game iS nOw iMpOsSiBle.
---
Never tried, but it might possible if people fast travel to team members whos already in.
---
Happens on ps4 too sometimes.
---
I give it a love tap then dance out of its way so I can call everyone over without getting too much health bar obliterated lol
---
I never can find the food vendors I just found the scavenger vendor down near the grove and what did she have.... stupid shit. No outfits. Usually I would find her twice a night and most times she would have chem recipes but never any outfits. Only time I ever got a outfit from her was when someone posted it on market and I joined and got clean straight jacket. But I never play with friends on game so I can’t have anyone wait near her so I can leave and come back and hope she has the rare outfits
---
It's weird how i rarely see anyone take this workshop nowadays, i just take it and make ammo to sell.
---
1. Yes. 
---
2. No.
---
3. That depends on you. But the scrapbox and tent is handy. 
---
And it have been an nerf to everything, and one wasteland. Enemies scale to your level. Throughout the map.
---
I see you've been to my CAMP...
---
Ditto
---
If you only needed to collect them once for the week I wouldnt mind collecting 8 of them.
---
Also think the ability to fully arm and equip allies would be useful now that we need better protection in our camps.
---
IMO
---
1. MUCH more stable than beta, only issues I come across regularly are very minor ones
---
2. Beth has done a pretty good job with getting rid of most of the trolling methods, it's hard to come across a player trying to troll besides trap camps
---
3. If you plan on playing regularly (4-7 days a week) then it's worth it. If you only plan on playing occasionally, (1-2 days a week) i'd say you don't need it as long as you got some good stash management skills. 
---
I played 76 a month after release, got to level 70, then never touched the game. That is until Wastelanders came out, and I've been playing it nonstop since and I am now level 402. Game is a lot more enjoyable and I think you'll enjoy a visit as well.
---
And I look forward to never seeing you again.
---
One thing that works (gauss rifle) for me, its to hop in and out of vats it every time to take a shot. Doing that, it’s hit more often than not on the first try
---
take everything you can, scrap it, and throw away what you do not need when finished. also make sure you store everything you do need in your stash.. or just shove it ALL into your scrap box if you have one
---
If by mods you mean loot boxes, because that's what MS does to games that they own.
---
Im not 100% sure but from my experience it saves the slot if your on a team and won't let randoms into it.
---
If you were on PC i would have given you the plan for some caps
---
No it is the same for me. I just found her last night and she only had random stupid stuff. Usually it is chem recipes or bow plans. I only once joined someone while they had her where I got a clean straight jacket
---
As it stands, you only need to enter the 8 digit code once per week per silo: if you go back to the same silo later, you skip the keypad altogether. Same thing if they change it to something you deposit.
---
there is a mod that shows you the exact total in budget remaining (clearly PC only)
---
Ok
---
Ah no worries. Thanks anyway!
---
So I googled how to disable the game bar.  I switched it to off in gaming setting.  Then I saw this:  Teredo is unable to qualify.  So I hit the fix button and when I checked again it now says NAT Type Open.
---
The game still crashed at the same spot.  I don't know if there is more to doing it than just switching it to off.
---
Post seems to have been removed? I wonder what it was all about
---
What level are you? Once you get into Scorchbeast Queen fights you get improved repair kits. It's all I ever use to repair stuff.
---
My camp however is a different story. I'm close enough to Monongah mine to get nuked several times a week.
---
Go to Charleston Station ... provided there's no CAMP there. Run forward towards Charleston and over the railway bridge. Stop on the other side and turn around and run back. Random encounter will spawn, which might be the vendor bot. If it doesn't spawn leave and come back later to try again (or server hop).
---
This is the only way and place I've been able to get it to reliably spawn. 
---
And if you do this on a private FO1st server, you can leave the server, change to an alt and hop back on - if you're quick enough not only will you be on the same server but the vendor bot will still be there!
---
Last time i fought him we were struggling and i gave my vampire 90wl 40bashing minigun a try as it was supposed to be magic and indeed it is magic and shred the last 3/4 bar of Earl!
---
It didn't work against the SBQ though...
---
I totally want a Ghoul Mask like from Fallout 3.  I know it’s not as spectacular as playing as an actual Ghoul but hey, it’s something at least.
---
Butcher’s Bounty does not affect Tick Blood drop rates any longer.
---
It may not be a choice on their part.  CAMPs already struggle to load in when they aren’t even a portion full.  Unless they rebuilt the entire way that the system loads camps from the ground up, which given the age of this engine may not even be possible or feasible, adding more to our normal camp budgets may not be an option. So interiors may be the only option anyways.  I’d rather them go for a working option than something that’s going to take an extended period of time to do or cause the system to break more than it is. 
---
The point is, wether it fits what YOU think of a camp is irrelevant.  This is the solution they have set forth at this point, for what ever reasons there were, and it seems that by doing it as interiors gives them far more flexibility.
---
Yep, it's an atom challenge under "Combat" iirc.
---
only if the mothman in question is non-hostile. so you can choose to let him enjoy lamp
---
This is the post.

Awesome. Thanks. I wasn't gonna jump into a sub but I was toying with it if I got into it. Glad to hear from someone who got back into it. Thanks so much for your time and opinion, much appreciated :)
---
I just hope that they don't add loot boxes. MS ruined Forza with that trash.
---
I wear your grandad's clothes, I look incredible
---
I'm using T65 for a while and quite satisfied with its looking and jetpack on the arm, which is a skin bug, I think I shouldn't make strangler heart at the moment  until my scrip is really has nothing to do with.
---
As an explosive guy I really wish they would dump the last  the fallout vegas grenade launcher. It's great to have the m79 but I would like grenade rifle or china lake as many people know it by in the game already.
---
I'm glad to hear Beth did something about that. It was a big problem, at least I encountered it a lot in my few months of playing. Thanks for taking the time to answer, I much appreciate it :)
---
Hey come on now - don't try and screw with Bethesda's profit margin! If they didn't *specifically* intend for you to buy Basic Repair Kits from the Atom Store, they would've scaled durability when they made weapons weaker and enemies stronger. 
---
It has been raised constantly since ACP was implemented and One Wasteland was announced. They've heard... they just don't care 🤷‍♂️
---
Limb damage is the effect
---
So I'm guessing a solid sneak build with a silenced AA 10MM can't headshot kill even a raider or a ghoul?
---
That's kind of a letdown.  It's always been my favorite playstyle in older fallout games.
---
Though I think if I do come back, I'll try for a bloodied build, since I'd be more stealthy I can make it work and not worry about getting swarmed.  I've ran a STR build for 2H, Heavy, and tried Shotguns but they all involve me being jumped on by everything. 
---
I might roll a new character or keep playing my old one but I have to readjust SPECIAL points on top of maxing out new perks.
---
Gives me a lot to think about, thanks!
---
Yes, this too - I picked up a Hunter's Longcoat this way.
---
The trader was in the house with no roof (and clown painting) directly north of Veiled Sundew Grove in Cranberry Bog.
---
If the game is a mess like Ark, then that part shouldn't deter me much, unless I can't get that damn cat head. Thanks so much for taking some time to answer my questions :)
---
No problem! Definitely give it a try cause you never know, you might really like it now. And hey, if you don't, it still wouldn't hurt to try. Not everything is for everyone so you don't know for sure you'll like playing it again until you give it a go.
---
I can't speak from experience with camden park outfit and tokens cause don't care much for outfits but to answer your question:
---
1: stability. There are still occasionally hiccups and lag when engaging enemies, especially queen fights but aside from that nothing worth noting. I've never played beta so I can't compare but from when I've started mid last year. 
---
2. PVP. Something I don't worry about since I'm always in pacifist mode. You can't engage other players unless you turn pacifist mode off under your personal gameplay settings. 
---
2.1 fallout 1st was worth it for me since I love to hoard any junk I pick up. With FO1st you can sperate junk from your main stash weight not having to worry about inventory management since your stash cap is as 800lbs max. 
---
One more thing to add is that the new update basically made all the weapons equal. Legacies still are top of the list as are 2525 weapons but the difference are not very minimal. I believe the new meta will now be survivability builds instead of pure Bloodied max damage builds.
---
I've gotten this message time and time again when first logging in without actually being over encumbered. In my case I thought it might be what kind of data gets loaded in before other data. 
---
For example, and this may be incorrect, but if you consume something that has a timer for how long the effect lasts such as strength to increase your carry capacity, then log out before the effect expires, the effect continues for the remaining duration of the time limit whenever you log back in next.
---
Then as you log back in, the game calculates your actual carry weight limit before factoring in the strength effect of what you consumed before logging out last therefore rendering you over encumbered for a brief moment.
---
 I see the bloodied witch hunts are still alive and well!
---
Should I start new so that if friends come I won't have the mobs be scaled too high?
---
If it was one thing it would be okay but between melee hits/bashing not registering half the time, weapon swap being buggy as hell, and having to stay on the point while unkillable robots destroy you from a distance (or lose time by running out there to go hit them),  its a bit much.
---
You seem to think that I want to argue that these instanced camps shouldn’t be a thing. This is not an A or B issue. I am not making the case that the instanced camps are a bad idea. We can have instanced camps AND find a new ay to boost camp budget.
---
Soloed him twice, not very hard, just bullets hungry. If you are below lvl 50-75 you shouldn't do it.
---
I'm gonna combine everybody's advice with this. Swap some slugger cards, etc. Thanks!
---
Wait. We currently only need to enter it once? Well ive been doing it wrong all these years.
---
Yeah the bullion limit sucks, been grinding events, faults and the wendigo nuke, I now have over 2000notes, that's 100days just to claim the bullion...
---
This is agonizing to read. Sell that goodness. For 1 to 2 caps, don’t be a greedy asshole.
---
With flamers, it isn't a question of damage, but durability. They break faster than just about anything else in the game. Two Shot will have half the durability, so personally, I'd go with Executioner's. But... If you -really- want to main a flamer, slot Bear Arms and just carry around a bunch of them, haha.
---
It depends on your ammo type I’ve noticed. When I use my 5mm Gatling gun, I either get 10 bullets back from the enemy, 25, or the highest I’ve gotten was 60. Which is perfect because regardless I end up making A profit. Most enemies I kill only take about 2-4 bullets. So I always end up getting more ammo. Same thing for when I use my shotgun emo. 
---
However I noticed that if I use my Ultracite 308 , I only get between 4-9 bullets.
---
This is the direct clip , time stamped:

---
Biggest news in a while.  I'd imagine all current games will still be multiplatform, but future ElderScrolls and Fallout, even Starfield may be exclusive?  
---
The idea of having to own two next gen consoles again has me feeling tired, but I guess that comes with age.
---
At least I have a new PC I can start building with, it's 16GB DDR4 just need a great card and I'll be set for a while.  I think this thing can go 32GB but will require fans and such I reckon.
---
Camden park has been working for me. I just got the head last week. I also played at beta, but never tried for the mascot outfit before coming back.
---
They are still rare and weren't duped *that* hard idk what the other guys on about
---
Yeah I agree sell the lead it will sell trust me.
---
And Im saying boosting camp budgets may not be possible so they gave us instanced interiors instead. 
---
Simply increasing a number would have been far easier than a whole loading a new area system. So there is something structurally limiting them from increasing camp budgets further
---
Is that your screen name over there as well?
---
I’ll always buy mini nukes when I see them.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't SH use Ultracite mods? Getting your hands on Calibrated Shocks for Ultracite is a huge pain in the ass.
---
Batteries included to carry more fuel. you will need enough to both set the world on fire and start a flame in your heart
---
Also what is up with the weight values? I could believe they were meant as a balancing mechanic if they were at least consistent, but there are times when an all around inferior mod weighs more than one with no discernible drawbacks— while we’re at it the same can be said for condition.
---
That would require creating new assets. 😋
---
Noticed the same thing. After the recent update i didn't see much Frog Legs and the game was actually enjoyable for a short period. Now i get entire teams just flying around shooting, sniping from rooftops etc. You'd think there was some penalty with Frog Legs when shooting while airborne or not usable with power armors...
---
It definetly is working. I just don't think it works with the wood wall. Try the barn set, the metal set, the contemporary walls, or the brick set. Make sure you have foundations placed on both sides of where you want to build the double wall. Then, build two doorways facing each other. Finally, select the doorways and simply replace them with a regular wall. I literally just did this yesterday on PC.
---
This daily op is one where its very nice being a full health junkies with a troubleshooter set. I can stand by the repeaters in the open without burning through too many stimpacks. First shot at it yesterday was me and a level 60 something who wouldn't get close enough to the repeaters and was just running around. Managed to get it in 8:48. The last part trying to run around and bash kill all the marked robots really killed our time.
---
Responders Outfit can be cheesed at Overseers house with explosives anytime.  
---
Can confirm, got em again last week over there.
---
That is super helpful. I had no idea the commie protectron could be set to make blood packs. I always have an eye out for them to craft, but now? Mix myself a mai tai and play mtg while I rake in the stim
---
Use power attacks, melee?  Should use Electric Absorption legendary perk if possible.
---
Some legacy are magic homie. Je gat plas for example
---
Yes it does, and yes it certainly was/is.
---
Is it called the Responders Fireman Helmet/Uniform?
---
Back when I played I saw legendaries out in the open and no one nearby, I figured it'd be fair game.  I don't know how far you can see emotes, but if I see a dot or two on the map I'll signal but if no one comes after a couple mins then I end up taking it down.
---
For the golf course or uranium fever I round them up and to the emote.
---
I have a two shot3 star legendary gauss rifle that is essentially useless except as a decoration. It misses 90% of the shots in vats and seems to do little damage when hip fired or using the scope. It's too bad, that 254+ damage would come in handy sometimes.
---
They scale to your lvl. If both of you see the same enemie, you will see them in different lvl. You can see a lvl 100. But your friend can see lvl 50. 
---
Test your toon before starting a new one. There is also legendary perks. There's a new banner above the perk selection.
---
Salamander confirmed
---
I mean, the second part is sort of encompassed by the F1 Survival Tent. I doubt they'd ever separate it from their subscription service.
---
Likw the others said, the problem is with magic weapons not bloodied builds. Even if you say "bloodied builds using magic weapons deal way more then others using magic weapons" still doesn't change the fact that magic weapons are what's making it broken, without them it's just a really strong build. What they need to do is offer more support for other builds. Bloodied has so much working for it, between perks and unyielding on armor. I'd like to see more of that for other builds like junkies, berserker, instigator etc
---
You sure you are using full ones? Cause I've barely used 1 in 3 hours while playing with power user.
---
Ive seen her at the small campsite up north of sacrament. She also can be found near overlook cabin - just turn and head up the hill from the spawn and you should find a tent with a random encounter, she is one of them.
---
As mentioned, blocker is a must have perk. No wastelander should travel without it
---
I mean, that's been my experience. I could be grossly misremembering it, but I'm pretty sure I've done a second launch in a week in a silo I had previously launched from and it didn't make me enter the code. I.e., running silo charlie a second time. Alpha and beta would still need codes entered for those for the first launch, though.
---
Unless that was a glitch those times it happened and I was supposed to enter them, but I could have swore other people have claimed the same thing.
---
Yes work on the mods and legendary effects berzerkers NEEDS a buff
---
How about just being able to scrap ammo at a workbench for ammo points. That would be acceptable.
---
Pros (after 10 days):
---
* I generally take less damage.
---
* Decent XP, leveling once per \~2.5 hours (was 3.5 hours before, @ lvl 760).
---
Cons:
---
* My versus weapons do less damage than AA, so they are dead weight now (were +10% better before).
---
* Mobs take 2x the bullets, thus twice the condition loss.
---
* lvl 50+ junk animals (radroach, molerat, etc.)
---
I haven't recieved a rare reward in 6 days and the 3 ones I got before that were all caged light bulbs. It has to be a bug at this point... right?.... :(
---
And legendaries...
---
Absolutely I am. Just walking now period to see how long it lasts. Just switched to another and 1/4 way through already.
---
Make the drop loot bags trick or treat plastic pumpkins! Those hanging bats at the pumpkin house as a camp/Atom item. Cauldron smoke machine and skull candy bowls that say something creepy/random when a player takes a candy. Alien and Flatwoods Monster costumes. Make another Alpine River Cabins mission and have us ‘disarm’ the ‘tricks’ as timed quest (w/ ghoul spawns) -kinda like Campfire tales.
---
Your understanding of the lore is good, but your understanding of the player base isn't. They've looked into it and overwhelmingly, players don't want PVP.
---
Are you VATSing more? I was using a VATS crit plasma caster build a few months ago and was FLYING through cores. It wasn't until I stopped using that weapon and VATS that I realized how heavily that was affecting me.
---
Don’t do either.
---
The locations in the Galleria have places where you can kind of "hide" from the enemies without leaving the booster radius, so I will whittle them down with my gatling, then duck down in one of these locations. Most of the robots will come to you at that point, keeping you from having to chase them around.  The ones that don't come to me, I don't bother with. I just let them stand at a distance and take the hits while continuing to use cover to mitigate as much damage as I can.
---
I agree though... it is still a pain. It's the only one I haven't been able to top-tier solo so far.
---
Pistols need so much work. Going to throw my cowboy hat in for fan-firing from the hip for increased firerate with the 44. It would make all the western/44/singles so much more interesting.
---
Someone can share your build from nukadragon to have an idea.
---
You could try the glitch for putting two doors next to one another to create a similar saloon door effect.
---
BuT dUpE gLiTcHeS
---
Nah nah nah nah nahhh nah
---
That's very strange - when I pick mine they show up as gourds in my inventory. Agreed - IDK. "It just works"
---
Funny during the beta and half way though 2019, I didn't notice the melee issue,  then the first hit wouldnt do damage even though it hit with blood,  even get damage numbers.
---
Now in the daily op some dodge the damage even though it hits unless I vats,  mainly the protections and gusteys.
---
Sorry no - as others have said, you are totally wrong in blaming bloodied builds and it's this sort of mentality that is causing all the ridiculous hate against them.
---
Yes I know =) that's a insane combination :D
---
I mean if you want to have fun and do it, I’d say go for it! You’ll just level super slow and the game will be on hard level. But generally, the build is based off of your weapon you find, pull, trade, buy. So really I would start building based off the first good weapon I pull. 
---
There’s a few good builds, bloodied (Lower health for you = more damage for your weapon) is probably the most popular, specifically bloodied not in power armor (PA) where you setup your card deck to match your bloodied weapon. But you max out perk cards like Serendipity in Luck which gives you a high chance of missing damage when low health, Nerd Rage which gives you more damage and other benefits when below 20% health, and then stacking other cards for defense and damage. Then they put on Unyielding Armor pieces which add 3 to all stats except endurance when you are below 20% health, so if they maxed out Strength at 15, and then had 5 pieces of Unyielding Armor, that would make it (15 + 5x3) 30 strength. Add in Radicool if you have rads to keep your health low add another 5 strength, add in a weapon and a piece of armor that gives strength, etc, you can pile different stats. The downside is you can die quicker than full health
---
Junkies might be 2nd most popular. You keep regular full health but get up to 5 addictions to chems and your junkies weapon will add on 10% damage per addiction = 150% max for 5 addictions, plus you can have more options for armor but many will use Vanguard armor which gives armor higher resistances the higher your health, so they just take a lot of stimpacks to max out the armor when fighting. The downside of this build is you have addictions which have negatives on your stats
---
3rd might be getting a Two Shot Weapon, specifically Two Shot Explosive, then you can run full health, have no addictions and have comparatively good damage. And wear whatever armor you really want
---
Also a shotgun build is crazy good right now, but mostly because they’re glitched. Legendary Shotguns with 33% vat chance and 40% extra bashing damage and I think 50% extra limb damage as legendary prefixes (which are on the second or 3rd star of a legendary shotgun but not the 1st star, meaning you would have to get at least a 2 star legendary shotgun) do super amounts of damage when using VATS. But when not using vats they’re not that great. 
---
The downside is if they ever fix it (which I doubt at this point) your greatness will go away. 
---
Hope this helps a bit!
---
Meat week is on right now!
---
We got a second one as a reward from the fortifying atlas event.
---
This is how me and this one other guy duo'd it after no one else showed up one time. None of the groups I've been in since has done this, which sucks.
---
Gauss pistol is just awful to use. The armor pen is not enough to fix clunky gameplay and a lack of meaningful mod options
---
Thank you. I tried it with the wood set thats why it didn't work. I appreciate it :)
---
I joined a daily ops team, jumped into the op, and the rest never did. Eventually they kicked me. I joined it again and got halfway through. They never joined, and kicked me again.
---
I don’t understand people.
---
If you try to fast travel to a teammate in a full instance, it will start a new instance and put you in by yourself.
---
You’d hate my camp then. 30 armor all of which are the super rare White Wolf Fedoras for 30000 caps a piece!!!
---
Over 170 ;) LMG is 172.
---
But yes. In fact theoretically a TSE anything firing over 50 will do it because TS counts as double, and E counts as double again, but the “magic” seems to depend on hitting the same body part continuously, and Explosive will hit.. all over the place, so it’s much less reliable. 
---
The higher the fire rate the more “magic” it seems though; either in triggering faster or more consistently. I’ve got a TS33% Gatling laser that just rips (effective fire rate of ~360)
---
Can’t say i don’t love it!
---
I have occasional sales when I used to have sales pretty frequently.  I don't really expect to keep my ammo or chems vendors up anymore.  Shit is everywhere now.
---
I think you mean 40 seconds.  With 3 people on drums and 2 or 3 or spits right when the warm up timer starts, it is done in under a minute.
---
&gt; Nukashine 
---
I do the same, plus my punch bowl is all nukashine.  Greedy people can drink as much as they want, then wake up somewhere else.
---
Anything that drains ap will increase fusion core drain especially when ap near zero.
---
People don’t do that? I thought it was the standard thing to do
---
Yah I was Mildly hopeful and tried that last night; no love, very disappointed
---
I can deal with any combination but resilient robots. I feel like I can never keep up with the spawns; for every one Gutsy I gunbash, 3 more appear in the hallway.
---
I was soloing yesterday's Faily Op. I had just built out a cool 3-star legendary melee weapon so I go in with a bunch of stimpacks (and survival syringes, thanks Legendary Perk Cards!) and am ready to go!
---
I ignore as many enemies as I can, get the signal repeaters...repeating...and then the Boss comes out and it is some giant Assaultron thing I have never seen before. Like a Sentrybot mixed with an Assaultron? I had to jump out; I couldn't get near it because it was head-lazering me and shooting at me with some kind of auto weapon that was similar to a Col Gutsy.
---
I am cool if I can only hit them with melee, but then don't put a Boss in that is impossible to get near
---
Hoping today's Daily Op is less frustrating
---
Wait ...  we can craft stuff at other peoples camp?
---
Yeah. I would subscribe just for the tent, but at this point I’m trying to save my coin for a little game I heard about that’s supposedly going to finally released in November
---
That didn’t work for me last night... but to be fair I only threw one, and there were two enemies next to each other, I may have hit the full-health one
---
Yeah ive seen that and thought maybe it wouldn't be so bad. But im still waiting just to see if theres another way
---
Yeah, there were no Ops groups on any of the like 10 servers I hit today, and on any other day there is almost always at least 1.  I hopped in solo without checking the mods, logged out right away once I realized what it was.  Not worth the ass ache.  Annoyingly it was also on a day where the NW challenge is the worst one, that I generally don't even attempt, because it's so random that it could take hours.
---
How can you do that
---
History of this game dictates that some users will have fusion core drain glitches after updates and 75%of the community will explain why you’re wrong 🤣
---
You can also run up the hill the other way and follow the tracks over the bridge then turn around and another encounter will spawn. Ive had the vendor bot many times at both these locations at Charleston. Its been harder to find servers that DOESN'T HAVE A CAMP there though sadly.
---
I forgot to ask, is this  PA tradeable? 
---
I saw some post 6month ago trading for this PA
---
I would like if I could scrap ammo for gunpowder
---
I guess its just me but I don't mind it at all. Took me a month to make and put together my t-65 armor and while it was a grind, a month to get a full set of end game gear is not bad. It also helps make those items worth something socially as well. If I see someone rocking full ss armor, I know they are in it to win it and most likely a top player.
---
So I agree the way they did the grind is annoying and not fun BUT it works well enough.
---
Two requirements: must be on PC and must access it through the Bethenet launcher as it'll be automatic through it.
---
Tbh it might be accidental. I couldn't tell you the amount of times my buddies and I just one tap a legendary just trying to get our hit in.
---
I think they do.  They also have a nasty habit (at least for me) of spawning around the first signal booster.  I will be trying to activate it to get the show going and protectrons keeping knocking me away from it, making me go back and hold A again from the beginning...all while the timer is ticking
---
Lights have a limit of 50
---
I personally got to a point where I just roll for my weapons now at the Purveyor, or even trade with others. I initially dumped 12/13 points in INT for this exact reason, but once I learned the plans and had weapons added to my pool, I just sought after script instead.
---
My strategy, however, does not take into account weapons that use legendary mods to craft, in which case I would agree with you. Just a thought if you are struggling.
---
both the loot bags and hanging bat decor were in the shop last year.
---
It still works on my non-magic combat shotgun. I just have one armor piece with the 15% damage reduction while blocking effect and it works. I have a magic pump action shotgun that I use while in power armor since the other one doesn't work without the armor piece on.
---
Absolutely! I'm going through my saved Youtube playlist to see what ideas I can find for you. 
---
What sort of ideas have you got so far for it?
---
I’ve heard u can do it if u have 76 no mater what
---
Conversely, as a PA build, that Laser Recharge perk is looking super OP now. I’m tanky as shit anyway, that one would just make me immortal.
---
But I agree with ya OP- the other issue is the spawn amounts. Robots spawn in like 3x the quantity of the other types- I’ve run Ops solo; when it’s super mutants or blood eagles, it’s like 1 attacker every 10 seconds. Robots? 3+, easy.
---
You heard wrong.
---
You have to kill different kinds and there are only so many.
---
Sweet!  
---
I hope that's true. After this last time I'm never doing it again.
---
The sever would probably explode trying to calculate all the super dupers.
---
The only thing that's annoying about this is when you're a bloodied build and you have the enemy attacking you and everyone wants to take their time killing it while its shooting me in the face
---
Aye I've notice this too with my AA one, It's a tad annoying but not overly an issue for me.
---
Anywho I have noticed this an it's super annoying the hell outta me, but sometimes (aka 90% of the time) the top rail when reloading is invisible and really breaks immersion for me.
---
not exactly valuable, but only 1 spawn in the game world: wedding ring, souvenir toy magnet
---
I just hope they're not all big ugly Vault doors. I want like a nondescript hatch or a storm cellar door.
---
This makes my comment about the servers exploding If someone mass crafted with it on probably true haha.
---
Might be one of those deals where it’s easier Solo, at least three or four of us were over level 100 and one guy was over level 300, which maybe I don’t know but seeing how I tried it before and he was also a sponge I doubt that’s the issue
---
R u talking about the private test server cause ur meant the public
---
I*
---
Unfortunately, not a bug. Your regular armor perks don’t apply when wearing power armor. You could try adding calibrated shocks for extra carry weight if you haven’t already.
---
There is only the public. It is only available on pc threw the Bethesda launcher.
---
Honestly, this is true for all the automatic melee weapons- ripper, chainsaw, even drill. The robots go immune to ranged attacks 1hp, so literally any melee damage will kill them. 
---
It’s just a bit more efficient with a buzz blade in case your team hasn’t gotten them down all the way yet.
---
Yeah like a separate tab on the building menu called "Found Items". When you scrap a Junk item, you learn the plan to build it.
---
You take off your regular armour pieces when you enter power armour. You can't stack the effects.
---
As everyone in their grandma keeps saying, the game is way better then it was at launch. still a few bugs here and there, but itsa Bethesda game.. (sadly thats the best excuse we have for it) 
---
they have patched out a lot of griefing methods, if you want to avoid PVP keep pacifist mode on, avoid workshops. and for now, do not use the legendary perk "taking one for the team". outside of PVP camps are immune to damage from other players, but enemies can still be drawn to it. nukes still destroy camps
---
personally speaking Fo1st is worth it if you plan on sticking around for a while. i paid for 1 year in advance (due to cheaper cost and i knew i was gonna use it)
---
It’s more stable. 
---
Griefing is nearly nonexistent in my experience, but I am on console. 
---
Fo1 is not necessary and certainly not to avoid grinders. It’s good for other reasons but I would play without it.
---
ability to scrap legendaries, returns a percentage chance on 1-3 modules based off stars + crafting materials
---
O ok srry
---
Thanks!
---
Update - doesn't seem to work on +33VATS on an instigating combat shotty.  
---
Berserkers bash is far out performing it
---
Its getting to be really sad really.
---
This comment is gold 😂
---
Write this on a napkin and slide it under the devs' door for a season 3 idea.
---
Floor decor I think?
---
The power armour when in its chasis only weighs 10 lbs. As soon as you put it on, the entire weight of the power armour and the chasis is added to your carry weight.
---
If you have calibrate shocks, you should be able to carry about 230-250 lbs before you put on power armour and not be encumbered. (that would be weight without the weight saver mods like grocery mod etc)
---
And when in PA backpack doesn't work. It is intended to work like that
---
I think they should be counted as a melee hit for the Resilient modifier in Daily Ops. I was so stoked to test the Meat Cleavers in the Daily Ops yesterday, only to be disappointed.
---
Inside the vault seems to indicate that it’s simply a door
---
They don't.
---
All my armour is deep pocketed, carry weight drastically the odd time I get into PA.
---
I am having the same issue i was under budget as recently as when the new fireplace came out deleted something to place fireplace no problem got this weeks bundle and am now over budget I have deleted two stash boxes and a magazine and it’s still saying over budget I have seen reports in the communities of some being dozens of items over when having just been under  prior to recent changes, I’d really like to use the new stuff at my camp but not at the sacrifice of deleting half the camp so I hope the team will continue to dig into it especially if it was an unintended change, thanks take care
---
Tank here, I solo the imposter sheep easily. Tank builds are important for bloodied builds so they can stay alive to do the damage so that guy is just simple or does not realize that the take one for the team perk is helping him do that damage.
---
If you don't want to touch stims, you need a fast fire rate weapon with vampires but if you want to become god like, stack stimpack with vampires. Even in PvP players rarely kill me. If your on Xbox I have no problem telling you my build, just mind the fact that im a murderer in fallout and do bad stuff to people.
---
I sell all ammo for 1 cap each now.
---
5.56?  1 cap.
---
.308?  1 cap
---
Missiles?  1 cap
---
Mini Nukes?  1 cap
---
.38?  0 caps (for the lowbies)
---
If they don't sell and my stash starts getting heavy, I just trade in everything but 5.56, .308, .45, and .38 to the ammo converter.
---
Maybe it was eight, I was just being General
---
&gt;I’m no fan of PVP, but it’s a circular argument to say that it never worked in FO76 because it just wasn’t that popular.
---
While on the topic of logical fallacies, that's what you call a strawman. 
---
I never once said PvP never worked in 76. That was never the topic. In fact Nuclear Winter is a provable case where it did work, for a while at least.
---
My point was that PvP was never popular. While that's obviously false for Nuclear Winter by my own admission (at least initially), the same cannot be said for the Adventure mode, the main thrust of my point. 
---
It was ALWAYS unpopular from the onset. Before all the issues and exploits with PvP were known, before all the Survival server issues or NW, well into beta before the game was even launched it was unpopular. 
---
It's certainly not for a lack of trying from Bethesda. They did everything they could to push PvP. 
---
Bethesda was dragged kicking and screaming away from PvP by the community. The game is in the state that its in where PvP is mostly eradicated because of the community. 
---
It wasn't because the community turned it's back on PvP, it actively fought against it.
---
In game items yes, atom shop items no.
---
There are ways to troll people (like building certain items you can remove without moving the whole camp). It’s not without risk.
---
I'm in this big ass coat
---
From that thrift shop down the road
---
One way to do this would be if the ability to plant more crops were tied to the Gardener Possum challenge. Or they could add a "Master Gardener" Possum badge or multiple ones (e.g. "Mycologist" badge so you can grow fungi e.g - Firecap, Glowing Fungus, Brain Fungus and one for berries - starlight creeper, firecracker, cranberry). I'll live it to the wizards at Bethesda to come up with a suitably grind-tastic set of challenges for each of these.
---
I've always thought the badges should actually reward players with a small, relevant buff rather than just the badge. Not as strong as an actual perk, or food/chem buff, but a 2%-5% improvement in something relevant.
---
Honestly this is part of what’s wrong with this game, being forced to have to use a build just to even survive sometimes
---
Wow.  Did not know this
---
Devs described it as a vault door to an underground bunker during one of their twitch streams. Can’t remember what event it was at.
---
One thing I don't see people mentioning in here - depending on what you got to drop for you; some of your equipment might be VERY valuable.  
---
There are things from back then 'legacies' which are simply unavailable right now except through trading.  
---
Any explosive energy weapon would be a good example. Just keep that in mind.
---
Oh, good to know. After all this time (1600+ hrs) I still regularly learn new things about FO76. Thanks!
---
Besides calibrated shocks you could add motion assist servos to the torso for +2 str if you don't want/need something else like emergency protocols or jetpack. The best solution would be to get rid of unnecessary stuff you carry around, though
---
Well my saloon will have its title "Junkie's Saloon" in unlit big lights letters. I found a trick where they use short stair beams to make foundation stairs stack. My foundation layout is 4 by 7, lights will be the antique lights, etc. I wonder if just the default wooden walls would sell the atmosphere, im wondering if there are other window styles than the regular ones, so on and so on. Im trying to make it look as authentic as possible. Look up western saloons and interiors. Youll see what im trying at
---
I've heard the term magic minigun before but am not sure what it is referring to, could you clarify?
---
I'd guess in misc structures
---
Dude, this is pretty much identical to the other post you made:
---
 I’m no fan of PVP, but it’s a circular argument to say that it never worked in FO76 because it just wasn’t that popular.
---
Yea if I see any camp with 10 or more "armor" and the player is under level 50 I won't even waste my time going to see what it is, chances are it's all if not mostly clothing.
---
That sucks
---
*Did you just call my comment a carrot?*
---
😉
---
I actually tried that. Yes it got to that point after trying other things like only tagging favorite on the two i wanted to use and yup still didnt work. I also stopped carrying ammo for them as a test.....it swapped to them anyway even with no ammo. All of my guns are primed so i think its a similar issue. Its very annoying. Anyway instead of swapping to the other only weapon on the favorites wheel and in my inventory it would swap to no weapon. Yup. Fists. So fed up with it. I just had to give up and select the wheel on the dpad every time now. Its slow on controller.
---
I am now starting to think that i might have an unusual yet somewhat related bug.
---
What's your GT? It didn't dawn on me at 3AM that I don't get "added you as a friend" notifications lmao. Or just send me a message
---
I ran with Randoms who were all bloodied and completed it just fine at elder. While its annoying its not that bad either. I play a tank build so I would make sure to stand in front of everyone on the edge of the circle so everything shot me to protect the bloodied builds. Weakened all enemies then when its time to move everyone punches them dead since they all all weakened. This was a random team.
---
This is a multiplayer game, make friends it wont kill you I promise. If you are on Xbox I have no problem helping you out. Just don't lecture me when I kill someone at their workshop.
---
Lol I made the jet pack on the arm of my t-65 too lol
---
So, my melee character has a monorail car camp, in Cranberry Bog. It's right where the Primal Cuts event is, in the monorail car that is on the platform with stairs going all the way up. My whole camp is up there and surrounds the car and goes above it. 
---
That location is also a Nukashine teleportation drop off point. Right next to where you land, I put some plushies and a Have A Nice Day sign, so people realize they are in a safe place, someone's home. I also have my Nuka-Cola vending machine there, with a sign "FREE Nuka Cola" on it, to invite people to have a refreshing beverage...
---
... Only I don't have Nuka Cola in it, I have Nukashine.
---
I’m currently a v/e handmade commando tank build, and I never have less than 400 stims on me at once (that isn’t a joke, I actually carry around 400 stims) I’m sitting at around 400 max health, what are you at for max health? Should I go higher? Also, if you don’t mind, could you share some key points of your build if you don’t mind?
---
I've been a victim of this. My CAMP was removed in the last update ans my god it was a pain in the ass to rebuild. Some parts were legacy and had to be compensated for, but it worked out. It sucked though.
---
Thanks for the responses, it is good to hear I can even run the bethesda exe second time (honestly I didn't even try, normally MMO games do not allow that... )  
---
Now just need to find a cheap price somewhere... wish I could buy it when it was less than 10USd everywhere...
---
Disagree. It gives melee a place to shine. Every time it pops up everyone in my group wants my melee character to come along.
---
Start team....wait till one or two join....start op.....profit.
---
Been getting the very rare "Vault 94 Jumpsuit Plan" I think it's pretty rare idk tho
---
That’s actually hilarious! 🤣
---
There is enough RNG and more than enough grinds in this game.  
---
What you describe would just at yet another RNG grind. People would probably pretty much stop dropping nukes at that point.  
---
The silo runs are quite fun, and one of the few places it is worthwhile to run hacker perks.
---
True! Rad barrel can only be rewarded from radiation rumble and is a pretty rare reward.
---
That’s a great joke! I have been waiting 30 minutes in a lobby for one.
---
I’m all about a company making money. If the artists/devs can’t eat or invest into improving their product, we all suffer. I get that. But when does it become pure greed?
---
Not only the shocks, emergency protocols for Ultracite are rare af too. Got the shocks, but the protocols are my personal White Whale...
---
I'm gonna hop some camps... got 20k caps in my pocket... I'm huntin'... lookin' for some armor... these are fucking outfits.
---
Not there. Ive gone through all categories multiple times cycling through all item variants. I don't see it anywhere.
---
I have claimed it and have restarted my game if that matters
---
Need someone to point me to it directly cause I'm missing something
---
Amen to this! I'm always up for new gear but if it has only a few mods to make it better than as is then I rather not even bother with it. You think it being the wasteland ever gun would have 20 or 30 plus mods to make every gun unique and special in their own way. Don't get me wrong pipe guns have all the attention for some reason only sucks they are straight trash compared to any real legendary gun that does decent damage.
---
I already hate it lol
---
So, if you come to a forum/subreddit to ask for advice on something you are not familiar with, it makes no sense to be resistant to the information provided. 
---
Especially when the correct information is available online via a Google search.
---
You should definitely keep an eye out for the western bundle from the Atom shop that comes around every so often; got some saloon-y stuff in it. 
---
You could also try making some horse hitch-ups out front of your porch area, put a Brahmin outside. Sorry I don't have more specifics to offer. This is a really cool idea though and I'm sure you'll create something amazing!
---
It still does the emote, just your character doesnt do it
---
I have no interest in a gopher hole.
---
Its a VENDING machine, not a display machine. Use the thanksgiving or the base display cases to show off your nuka's.
---
&gt;vend
---
&gt;/vend/
---
&gt;verb 
---
&gt;offer (small items, especially food) for sale, especially either from a stall or from a slot machine.
---
I got it purely for the tent. Now that foundation and crater are free travel spots, the tent is kind of obsolete. The stash box is handy as hell for not using any inventory space for materials tho.
---
I only carry around 30 stims at a time and only for imposter sheep and PvP cases break out my vamp weapons and I literally never die. Are you xbox?
---
I don't get why people drink them all
---
They don't get added to your inventory so you're just wasting 15 drinks
---
I was just guessing. Sorry I'm not much help. I did collect it a space or two back on the scoreboard so i will be looking for it later on today as well.
---
No, I’m on PC unfortunately
---
I do the same too but how have they not thought of displaying actual nuka colas lol
---
Yea! I still cant sell the almost 4k .38 and 4k 10mm for sale, may just put them up for 0 and let anyone that will use it take it, the rest just flies out of the shop. I love selling at 1 cap each for everything excluding cores(50c), its great slow and steady gain. If you ever come across my base near the ammo factory enjoy the cheap ammo and thanks for stopping by!
---
Don't use heavy armour. Using the light versions of armour sets exposes the underarmour to varying degrees depending on the specific armour.
---
SS is the fattest, tankiest suit of armour. It's practically an unpowered PA suit and you're expecting to see the underarmour underneath that thing?
---
&gt;	All you’ll need to do is build the door to your Shelter in your C.A.M.P. 
---
Sure it leads to an “underground” area but hopefully it’s like every other door we’ve seen thus far - it attaches to a wall frame.
---
Or when a player has weapons, armor, rare clothing or whatever and they have 30k priced on each BUT have a PM me for offers.
---
Change server...start team....wait till other join...start ops......profit! What system are you on?
---
I was selling masks pretty fast for 1200 caps last January. Noone knew they were coming back though.
---
I HIGHLY doubt that my suggestion would make people stop. I'm just saying they should make the entire process fun to do, instead of one where the community skips some of the steps consistently. Maybe even make nuke zones a little more profitable to do as well.
---
I do agree about the silo runs, I like doing those just in and of themselves.
---
Ps4
---
Currently only lvl 27. I’m sure once I get passed lvl 30+ I’ll fair better. Can’t wait to get starched genes. Tired of losing my mutations or getting one shotted by trash NPCs because I’m constantly playing at 1/2-3/4 HP as I attempting manage my radiation lvls.
---
I hope to man. Thnx for your time
---
Yes, and to "celebrate" the release of new mods for undesired weapons to make them better, they could release new paint jobs for said weapons. give them a financial reason behind giving us new weapon mods
---
I just drop the duds I craft, considering I get like 10+ leg a day easily now they won't ever get cashed in.  The system is so stupid.
---
I have always sold ammo for 1 cap, before this last update ultracite ammo would always be 3 caps since making lots of certain rounds where very resources intensive. And farming loads of flux is far from fun. Now with ammo factory rank 4 all ammo is 1 cap including ultracite at my camp. I do get a good laugh every time I go to a level 150+ player vendor and see they still trying to sell cryo cells and .50 cal rounds for 5 caps a piece like hell no.
---
I vote we should be able to save certain outfits so we don't have to equipped every single item every single time.
---
I would like that very much. Sometimes the budget cost is not obvious at all. For example I think the huge super reactor has a smaller budget than the fusion reactor. Or one crop can have as much budget as 5-6 decoration items.
---
I did that but with the chest piece :D
---
Always thought they should have their own card.  Always thought it would be fun to go around throwing knives at shit.
---
That sucks, its just a lot to go over and explain that's why I'd prefer voice chat. When I get time I will send you my build and equipment.
---
In my opinion to come out of beta it would need a lot of rebalancing.  The scoring actively discourages doing anything except just hiding.  The weapon drops need some reworking. So much downtime between playing, etc.
---
Its sometimes easier to get a decent xp result by going afk and making dinner than playing.
---
Its not a full implementation, and beta is the right tag. Although id argue that maybe "alpha" is more appropriate.
---
Sort your stash by weight. Helps with that, the outfits all weigh .10 so unless its like weightless wooden legs that you accidently tossed in there the real armor will come right to the top
---
Yeah. I didn’t think it posted which is why I did the updated version. I’ve been up since 4:00 am folks. Sorry about.
---
Alright! Thanks, I really appreciate it
---
not only is the first shot from them guaranteed to miss even with crit active but vats seems just all around horrible on the ps4 version. ive played on both PC and PS4 and the latter is super unreliable for vats. sometimes youll crit someone 200 times before damage ever shows at all. just today i missed all 6 shots from my 44 with a 95% chance to hit. then theres the fact that if a blade of grass is too tall it just boots you out of vats entirely.   
---
I specifically was using it because aiming on a controller vs mouse is already janky feeling. add in the fact that the PS version of the game is painfully unstable and frequently just locks up for no reason or at best still heavily drops frames and aiming feels pretty gross (the lockup issue seems significantly worse in NW than adventure. luckily i hate BR modes anyway) im just gonna respec into auto rifles and out of vats because it feels so terribly unreliable as a whole. was decent on PC but why use it there when i can just... click on their heads.  
---
can the console version just get a performance mode option that helps it run normally? I get some people dont mind playing an inconsistent flip book but others do and im all for having an option to reduce some of the lighting effects, shadows, grass, etc if it helps make a more stable game.
---
If you're on PC there's a great mod called intRaw for this
---
It's a nice idea in principle but ammo points are worthless to a new player, especially one that never got access to Season 1 legendary run.
---
Also until their fix the ammo converter, I'd rather have the ammo. At least I can drop it or give it away so that someone else may benefit from it.
---
Instead of having a card, get nukacrypt up, go through silo you want us to try and find random codes, do more math, then run the silo (or will we just have a nuke console near prime?)  
---
People are lazy - that's why there is nukacrypt in the first place.  
---
You can "HIGHLY" doubt it all you want. But, I launch nukes most days, if it was made more tedious, I simply wouldn't.
---
Then why did they buy the game?  They knew pvp was going to a part of it.  It’s even in the official trailer.  Makes little sense to me.
---
I was nervous that the Ammo Factory legendary would put my 1 cap ammo shop out of business. Thanks for buying.
---
Just makes a zapping noise likebugs are flying into it, adds to the ambience is all.
---
It was unpopular because it was horribly implemented. Sorry, but even to this day people are confused about how PVP works even in relation to workshops.
---
That combined with the impossibility of balancing it in Adventure mode with all the mutations, perks, and legendary effects, plus Consumable usage, meant that the only “balanced” PvP possible meant redoing everything. Thus enters Nuclear Winter. 
---
And all that shit existed since day one- I’ve been here since BETA, minmaxing PvPers figured out all the tricks super early on, and all the early duped gear was PvP- Sentinel Assassin gear was what was hot.
---
Cool thanks
---
I was wearing Scout armor for a long time because it had the best protection for the smallest "footprint". I could actually see my Raider Waster underarmor under it.
---
But then they introduced the SS armor+jetpack, and even though that thing is janky as hell I would miss it if I tossed it. And the SS armor looks ridiculous.
---
So now I finally have an excuse to wear all of the outfits I've collected over the years and never bothered to put on. I actually prefer the "armor over underarmor" look, so I'm hoping some day they let us re-skin armor to look like other sets.
---
The spine of my tower utilizes a stacking method with the steel scissor stairs, that to my knowledge has long since been patched.
---
I’m a “build it perfect then never move again” person.
---
I wish i never learned those. So annoying.
---
The caged lights from daily ops are a hanging light. Are you maybr confused by what the new lights are?
---
Minigun shredder mod.
---
Oh god I wish I had thought of the auto plasma pistol earlier, I have been making them all into flamers...
---
But also good news, ammo factory legendary perk solves the issues of not having enough plasma ammo.
---
Try taking the card off and putting it back on, all I can think of , but something is making you burn through cores. You aren't walking around over weight no?
---
Yea you have it really nice compared to Bethesdas previous method for strangler heart and thorn armor which was doing vualt raids for a chance of a few pieces of 94 steel and a chance at the plans. This method isnt even a grind you literally do scortched earth and a colossal problem and save up treasury notes to convert every day and buy 300 every week. Like waiting is the least painful form of grinding I'm this game.
---
there is no point in finishing it faster. you got lots of toxic people downvoting people saying this is a bad idea, and it should at least be run for a few minutes to let people get their scrip/xp buff. like someone else said, it's the event equivalent of melting a legendary before everyone gets a tag in
---
My GF and I just started playing again after a 6ish month break, and the first thing she said was "I can't believe they still don't have a slider for cooking!!"
---
Seems like such a simple QoL fix that it really is mind boggling that it isn't in the game yet...
---
So, I'm going out on a limb here, but this must be a severe limitation of the engine. Basically every single quality of life improvement we've been asking Bethesda for since Oblivion have not been met, and this is one of them. This isn't unique to this game, it's been a problem for over a decade that's just made _worse_ by this game and its vending functionality.
---
I'm pretty sure mods have done this before, but for whatever reason Bethesda seems to be unwilling or unable to do it themselves. It's a conscience design choice for again, over a decade, to muddle the armor and clothing in Bethesda games. Key ring is the same sorta nonsense. Why? Who knows, but we've been asking for this since vending existed and can't even get a response.
---
I actually had 2 pieces of armor drop with that on it. My shotty almost 1 vats shot hits a lot of things..after the patch sometimes 2 or 3 but still not complaining but yes i do believe i either couldn't get it to work or it just isn't a thing anymore as it made no obvious difference at all.
---
Thank you!  I had no idea.  My friends and I have been doing this manually.
---
Honestly this game needs to give us more accurate info for a whole lot of stuff.
---
&gt;or use some mod, which is officially not supported by the game, so i think its very unnecessary complecation and it would be way better to have some informative built-in feature.
---
I agree completely. For example, on PC there are mods that give us the % on our health and tell us enemy health both in flat HP and in %, but mods are a PITA in that updates constantly break them, people abandon development, or just take a while to update and might not display 100% accurate info (the new show-health will rely on player feedback to tell us the flat HP, which does not thrill me TBH).
---
I'm sure it would be really easy on BGS' part to give us more UI options, I'm grateful to modders who gift us with these QoL out of their free time, but I'd much rather have official features than mods that I don't know when will stop working, and if they will be updated at all.
---
Who said anything about finding random codes and doing math? I never said that. I'm saying just make the fragments into items you have to collect and deposit once per week instead of solving for the 8 digit code. If all else fails, get rid of the code step entirely since no one wants to do that anyway.
---
Armor and BP are removed when getting in PA.  
---
Calibrated shocks, and motion assist servo can bring that up.   Excavator armor is ur best bet for carry weight.   Would still need calibrated shocks and motion assist to add more.  
---
If ur a full time PA user max travel farm and thruhiker is needed.
---
I'm that person too, that's what made it so damn difficult. 😭 The new one is arguably better in someways because a few changes were made on a fundamental level. If the stair stacking method you're talking about is the platform stairs stacked with stair posts then I've heard one person in discord say they've just done it and the other say they can't get it to work to save their life lmao
---
Yeah weird, I have a medics faster fire rate something minigun, and it shreds the queen but doesn’t seem to work on Earle. Lol backwards for me
---
oh yes, it's soooo much more important that you get someone their fourth or fifth chally the moo-moo outfit ASAP, rather than give them a chance to get their scrip and XP bonus
---
thats a different one i believe. responders fireman is the dark blue variant, not the red one!
---
Two weapons to bring.  A high fire rate gun with Vampire effect.  That will keep you alive.   A plasma gun with the flamer nozzle seem to do better damage to him.  Between those two, I stood nose to nose (had my back against some equipment post so I couldn’t run away) and just unloaded ammo into him.   Repair kits are handy too.   Or bring backup guns.
---
Thanks, thought maybe specific items might have had build limits, like 20 of one version but 50 of a standard one or something.  Awesome!
---
I do this. Have my camp built by the red canoe.
---
Agree - the 'legends' for camp vendors really need work.
---
 I've been scanning for the last 100 or so Mr. Fuzzy Tokens I need. I've figured out that the Miscellaneous category is the most fucked of all. It's got Holotapes, Serums, and Miscellaneous stuff in it. I kept finding people with 1000 or more items showing in Misc getting to their camps, and not a damn thing on that tab in their vendors - at least with armor, it's on the right tabs!
---
Absolutely not. About 100lbs under. I’ll try that.
---
I just make a lot of Forrest healing salve using green thumb and chemist. Its lower strength than diluted stims but all healing perks effect it and it counts as stim so you can spam the hot key for healing items. I usually do 180 to 360 healing salves per run a day and it'll last me 2 to 3 days. By the end of the week by doing that I'll usually have 200-300 stim packs saved up by then. I usually sell excess healing items at my vendor really cheap and they fly when I'm logged on. 
---
Forrest healing salve is blood leaf, soot flower, boiled water. Id recommend using packed with salt while gathering if your going to try to make 100+ salves so they don't decay too much. 
---
Follow major water sources/rivers in the forrest for blood leaf, and soot flower is all over grasslands,prairies, and hills in the forrest and savage divide areas.
---
1) there are still issues but it’s infinitely better than it was 
---
2) I’ve seen posts about griefers but I’ve literally never experienced them and I’ve played since launch day
---
1, part 2) do you have $18 CAD/month that you won’t miss by spending it on this? Then go for it. I haven’t used my private world for anything besides transferring stuff between characters in a long time, but the scrap box is amazing. I’ve always been a solo f76 player but with the née public teams I can get the benefit of being in a team (strange in numbers, etc) without changing my play style.
---
Don't knock mutant slayers!! Lol...awhile back I was convinced we'd get armor mannequins (Still waiting Beth!!) so I put together complete sets of all the enemy specific armors with the "Sentinel" effect...and I can stand in a hoard of super mutants and laugh at them while they do virtually nothing to me. Great for the daily ops, lemme tell ya
---
I guess it's possible. I don't ever remember seeing wall mounted caged lights before, but I have them now. I definitely am missing the other wall mounted lights that I had before. And I did not see any hanging caged lights in my menu at all. At work now so can't check again, but if you've got a pic that would be great.
---
EDIT: yes, I learned the plan for them after winning the prize.
---
The cage lights are a variant of the hanging ceiling lights, they're in with the vault tec hanging lights (of you got those) and come in a long &amp; short variant.
---
Yeah I don't do uranium fever as much as I used to because of them
---
If you hold an anti-armor melee weapon or even just have incisor equipped, you should do more damage with pain train as well.  Because it debuffs all enemies rather than augmenting your particular damage dealt by a particular weapon.
---
It was using a glitch that crashed the server, but I belive it got patched
---
absolutely not. I've seen groups running this technique and it usually lasts 30 seconds. if someone is wrapping up a Prime Cuts event somewhere while the 90 second warmup for Grahm's Meat-Cook has already started, there's a pretty good chance they're not getting to the grill to drop off their prime meat.  
---
source: seen plenty of thumbs down and angry emotes around the grill at the 20-30 second meat-cook completions
---
🎵 I want***to set the world on fireeeeeeee🎵
---
Definitely, I am sure it also depends on lighting, movement of items, etc.  
---
It would be nice if they could have a total number.  Like ok you get 5000 CAMP points and you have used 3500, realizing a single item could be 5 to 500 points depending on what is going on around it.
---
I run PA though so if your not a PA build I'll be more limited on how much it will help you.
---
Its annoying as hell. I used to love the event, now I tend to avoid it as I know it's a big chance I won't find the legendaries before someone one taps them
---
Agree with this, but will add that if you set up water purifiers (or collect purified water when visiting player vendor camps, most leave them unlocked) and then dilute the stims, you get another chance for super duper to proc. 
---
So if you start with tick blood, you get 3 proc chances, or 2 if you start with blood packs. You’ll be swimming in the diluted stims if you spend a little time on this.
---
Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention that, I am PA build
---
Join a new lobby then?
---
the same damage twice is just instigating but better.
---
Well it’s only 75.
---
I'll PM you
---
For every day for 3 weeks all you have to do is spend 5 minutes traveling to foundation, putting notes in a machine and leaving. For the best set of armor in the game that you can choose to get every single time (unlike rolling purveyor), that’s a really good deal. If you’re gonna complain, complain about something that actually needs fixing
---
Can you make me one too?   I’m Caperboi
---
I
---
Maybe to avoid walking out of the way and avoid PVP.  I remember a lot of PVP fights around that workshop.
---
Well shit, I need to look harder next time. Thanks.
---
Well shit. Egg on my face.  
---
I misread your post and I apologize.
---
You're lucky. That's all there is to it. Toxicity is more prevalent in this community than most would like to admit, but it's there and not as rare as people pretend it is.
---
You get them as drops even if you haven't learned them. It changes nothing really.
---
Sorry to hear it's not working. I take it other games are fine, it's just fallout 76?
---
Learned or not, they still drop. I’ve just gotten to tossing them whenever I get bored since you can’t sell them.
---
If they don't use FU's then I'm going to be really disappointed...it would be nice to see Bethesda acknowledge some of the community's hard work.
---
It was both for me. Half the time I couldn’t get it to stack, then couldn’t get walls on it, then could, randomly over several days. For literally no reason. It was a nightmare.
---
The worst is placing an item (wall), then taking it off, literally doing nothing else (no intervening variable), and not being able to place it back. Pure anxiety touching anything once it works.
---
my advise is go through the early and mid game without a build and in level 70 or so search for a build that fits your playstyle!
---
As a new player who started after Fasnacht I can assure you that even I don't want those or any stacks for mounted heads. We only need the buy them once, people.
---
Only count as melee damage if you throw them while you have a melee weapon equipped.
---
Never hurts to clarify
---
Ooooh that's sounds awesome.
---
I've got a guy around 14 I think from way back I'm going to use.
---
I'll have to read up on how to start the wastelanders story!
---
I've got a lvl 40 Anti Armor, explosive and I think the last perk is -90cw one waiting for me when I get up there a kind redditor gave me a while back.
---
I've been shuffling perks around in that dragons perk planner thing and apparently need like... level 100 or something to get all the cards I want lmao.
---
Having that much ammo to come back to would be amazing!
---
I've collected a full set of Troubleshooters armor just for this kind of daily ops. The 75% damage reduction means that even the boss assaultron is just an annoying mosquito to me. It also helps if you just take cover behind something near the uplink. When guarding the uplink, you don't have to kill anything, your only objective is to stay alive and stay near it.
---
That's even worse then!
---
Lol Scrooge can’t take it with you
---
Would this be why I seem to actually be doing *better* damage after patch 22? My main is an AA/Limb Damage Fixer with the mag that has a few more shots + improved penetration.
---
EDIT: also modded to autofire.
---
easy fix, make them all wield Missile  launchers, when they get close they would switch to a melee.. at least that is how the super mutants and mole miners operate
---
complitely agreed. Camp budget is a necessary limitation for core mechanic - camp building - which is one of most popular core mechanics of this game. I think, if we have to rely on 3rd party solutions, which are even not officially supported - its totally not correct.
---
Its not accidental. If you will one shot or, then you should be gun bashing it. If it was accidental it would only be one legendary it happens to, I almost never get legendaries in uranium fever anymore because they just walk around stealthed and one tap them all and then leave. That's not an accident.
---
Most things are better than instigating.
---
Living enemies can't go flying anymore. Presumably it was removed because syncing or simulating the ragdoll over a server wasn't practical.
---
I can finally be able to display things without it taking up my above ground camp budget. I ll have a whole power armor display room.
---
Just a guess but look through floor decor. It’s probably a 2nd or 3rd item behind the fridge or something else instead of being it’s own category.
---
I guess you already know about the sub, but maybe not [https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/)
---
Maybe worth some browsing for inspiration/tricks
---
The generally established unit of measurement for camp budget is FU, or Flamingo Units. That is, the number of Flamingos each item is equivalent to placing.
---
Don't i risk to waste special?
---
Hey, no harm no foul. Trust me, we can both agree that if they forced everyone to do the actual codebreaking step, while for someone like me I'd get a kick out of it, most people playing the game would indeed just give up, as at this point I would argue the nuke zones aren't worth doing without something like nukacrypt making it tolerable.
---
I'm just saying either streamline the parts 99% of people don't want to do or replace it with something people would enjoy doing as a weekly thing.
---
Absolutely. You get them as rewards from anything and everything. I’ve read it was a bug that they’ve never patched but I haven’t been able to confirm that. If you run a few daily ops in a row, they add up quick to a few extra pounds of weight. I can at least sell the other grenade types to vendors. The whole thing feels like such a waste. They could’ve been a really cool idea if they weren’t so weak.
---
Instigating is pretty much the best effect you can have on melee, it basically guarantees oneshots on everything but bosses.
---
Double damage every attack is absurd, it makes literally everything else awful in comparison.
---
That's sad
---
its annoying until you found a deathclaw mask listed for 10caps :0
---
Hey guess what?
---
Claiming that “certain number of atoms for certain price” is a better deal than “other number of atoms for other price” is stupider and less representative than the other guy’s claim.
---
Atoms shouldnt exist as a purchasable item at all, so it doesnt count for a “value proposition”.
---
That would be like paying slightly more money to be shot in the head, instead of paying a little less and settling for the electric chair.
---
They are both sucky options for someone who just wants to play a game confortably.
---
B-b-but I'm a herbivore
---
It would be nice if that every time we unlocked a new camp item, there is a new tab so we can see what we recently unlocked instead of aimlessly scrolling through the tabs.
---
Hell yes if you helped me! 
---
I think i'll look for a Two shot or a bloodied, ty for clarification!
---
https://youtu.be/9mRX-MEPzhs
---
Video is kind of long but worth the time
---
I mean, it IS possible to turn it off. Also, after you do that, you can even listen to whatever you want. :o
---
Gauss weapons be like:
---
 95% - miss
---
 14% - hit
---
Best bet is to just start your own daily ops team. Other people looking to join the op will see the notification and join.  I've given up on joining existing teams. More often than not it's people who have completed it already and just haven't changed it.
---
I believe it's either In misc or floor deco. Also heads up the picture it shows in build mode Is of the side so u can't a truly tell you went past it untill you really pay attention.
---
Even though the helmet is a waste of gold bullion, it atleast looks sort of like a storm trooper helmet.
---
I'm going to copy a comment I made before when someone asked about another puzzling balance decision:
---
Because they have no idea how to balance anything and the relative strengths of gear and perks in this game are the result of the numbers they arbitrarily entered during the initial build of the game and never got to balance because the game was rushed to release.
---
Just bring a kitchen knife with you
---
Wait how rare we taken cause I'm litterly selling it for 10 caps
---
If also never hurts to use Google. 
---
*Except when you do a people search to see what your old high-school girlfriend is up to these days.*
---
None of that chances the fact that nuclear winter is pvp. What i dont get is why people are so salty that people perfer not to do pvp in normal adventure mode. You basically telling people how to play the game. There are people that do pvp in adventure mode, workshops are pvp zones.
---
Then how about 75 % of the original damage.
---
Nope, same thing will just happen. I would happily solo it if the obj charged as fast as it did if there was four.
---
You make the holy Mothman cry.
---
Sounds like you just have shit luck
---
They should have the option to set any under armor you are wearing as an ‘outfit’.
---
Or better yet, just give us the option to make any piece of armor we are wearing invisible.
---
R/fo76 never dissappoints!
---
Lights are all lumped together. There's a counter when you place down a light. 1/50
---
This would differ them from rifles, and provide an interesting play style.
---
Rifles may need AP cost nerf to make pistol more appealing.
---
You still get the buffs from meat, just not the food.
---
i ate all the prime meat, was that not the thing to do with it
---
LoS them. Hide behind things to make them move. Worked on every single daily ops so far.
---
That's still just better than everything else.
---
Two-shot on rifles is like 25% of the base damage of the weapon. Anything above even like 33% extra would render the other effects pointless, as they have drawbacks like needing low-HP or addictions.
---
Nope but it refers to future games and who knows about the ps5. 
---
We shall see what happens but considering the coding and processing each console needs to make a game run correctly, they cannot simply decide on a whim to add a game to a console, they need time to work on it before hand.
---
I'd buy literally all of it. Do you have Xbox One?
---
I do this every night. Typically completely finished withing 20 to 30 minutes tops.
---
Not rare at all. I’m fact it’s way to common of a reward for what can be a difficult fight.  This is a manifestation of my hate for the white wolf fedora and eventually I hope to have 120 for sale!
---
At this point anyone still putting mounted plans in their vendors should have to do a 3-day stretch in Eastern Regional.
---
Looting the corpse is an after thought for that event. The event rewards are the real prize.
---
I think something that would be neat is a power armor costume. It's an outfit that looks like how power armor was in 3 and nv
---
[Resource map ](https://fo76map.com)
---
youre welcome! if im not using it, might as well sell to someone else
---
It does make sense. The Assault Rifle is similar to a Lewis Gun, which is more similar to it is in 76 that 4. And the automatic variation of laser weapons needs an extra second to charge, I guess? I've never personally used an automatic combat rifle in either game (I strongly prefer semi auto weapons regardless of the game,) so I don't know about that one.
---
As someone who is super casual (played since launch but just now level 100) I love coming in and buying event stuff that I missed on the cheap side.
---
Let me introduce you to ‘Party Boy/Girl 3’ and a +6 Strength (+30 lbs) boost from Whiskey. 
---
Steeped Fern Flower Tea for another +2 Str for 60m. 
---
*You keep shining on, you beautiful leaf-eater!  We got your back!*
---
Huh? Pacifist mode makes it so you don’t deal any damage to other players.
---
Interesting. I can actually see how crossplay for this game would need work compared to something like Call of Duty or Fortnite, and the new food/water changes and Steel Dawn content info look promising if not anything else.
---
You turn 5 at a time in to Graham for scrip!
---
Pepperoni Rolls for me.
---
I feel bad for all the console player that want these quality of life improvements that we get as mods on PC
---
The Fasnacht stuff was always going to be a loooooooooong term investment. Like maybe, maybe next February you can get some decent caps for them. Even that is unlikely. Before Fasnacht came back this year I was offered what I thought was an insane amount of caps for my beret, but I turned it down because it's one of my favorite looks. In retrospect I should have sold it because I got 15 more just sitting in an alt's stash now
---
I could have sworn that as a Carnivore I wasn’t getting any buffs from veggies. I’ll have to look again, I guess!
---
If you have a Bethesda account you can link it to your steam account  
---
* sign into your [Bethesda.net account](http://bethesda.net/en/account/linked-accounts) and go to "[Linked Accounts](http://bethesda.net/en/account/linked-accounts)" under your account settings.
---
* Select the **+** on the block that says "Add a Platform, Social Media or Game Account."
---
This was the original way to transfer from Bethesda -&gt; Steam, so maybe it works the other way around too and you can access the PTS install then from the Beth launcher. Probably worth a try, not much to lose but some minutes to create the account if you don't have one already.
---
Stimpacks can be a reward for completing quests.    
---
Pharma Farma at R1 can proc quite often. If you find the recipe for it cheap,  get it.    
---
I've seen it in player vendors somewhat often at cheap prices. Tag the mats you need for it.    
---
Get Chemist if you don't have it as well as Super Duper R3. Make sure they are equipped when at any Chemist workbench.
---
So we couldn’t play fo76 on next gen?!😞
---
*"Fallout 76 is considered "stable" now internally, so they want to focus on making content."* Ahahahahahahahahahaha :D
---
It’s just my opinion, and a vast majority of the PvP community agrees with me on this, that NW has potential, but it’s too poorly executed to be used for its potential. Survival on the other hand was brilliant. If they bought it back, but didn’t make food builds who don’t like PvP feel like they *have* to play a mode that’s not for them by introducing god rolled weapons as rewards then everyone will be happy again. NW isn’t the PvP we want.
---
If I'm in an event with high level 300+ players with legacy weapons one shotting everything over my shotgun, I'm gonna take a shot. Sorry if that 3 Star Scorch Zealot dies to it because nobody ever waits for me. I only want to get credit for the kill, but the way this game is makes it difficult.
---
Contrary to what you might say, most players I run into don't wait or even emote. 
---
Don't blame the player, blame the fact that the game only let's you loot if you attack it. Should be able to loot anything that dies while you're in the vicinity.
---
Huh? So you are high level I assume?
---
Anyway healing salves are the way to go.
---
if youre having trouble, keep pushing forward in the main story plots, these will give you items and exp that will get you stronger.  its tough to go from vault to events right away
---
If I don't have a bethesda account and create one, will that still work? I don't want to link to steam and then find out I lost my toons.
---
Don't forget that the bonus applies to the ricochet perk too! Still useless, but funny that it works that way, haha
---
Discord username please
---
If those trouble shooter numbers I spotted on a level 5 version (130+) are accurate, they are pretty amazing. It even has a bull barrel.
---
This is why missile launchers have bayonet fixings.
---
Idk if you watch her videos or not but Innovsurvivalist just made a video about what I was trying to articulate. Maybe it would make more sense then my ramblings. Lol... take care ,stay safe
---
Not sure if there tameable but toxic Larry’s I believe that’s the name consistently spawns three.
---
This was a HUGE missed opportunity on their part. They had set the table for this with Responders, Free States, Enclave, BoS, Raiders and even Order of Mystery in the vanilla game. Add in some sort of voluntary faction PvP element and maybe a roleplaying element and they would have sold *so* many cosmetics...
---
I see the flamer in use almost everyday. What they should do, is remove the weapon perk cards from the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. slots. Then merge them into legendary perk cards. That way you could be a Str Rifleman. Or a Cha Heavy gunner.
---
I just read on the wiki that two-shot weapons are 62.5% the damage of the original shot so how about that.
---
PS and XBOX are both having almost all of the past generations libraries BC, don’t see why 76 wouldn’t be included.
---
i feel like a clown now. i'm not a melee build by any means so i completely forgot about the bashing part, i will have to remember that next  time, thank you!
---
You can! But it'll be the same as playing it on regular consoles. There will be no direct improvements to graphics/frame-rate. You may encounter faster loading times / less frame-rate drops though. Players need to speak up if they want to see any next gen enhancements. Let them know!
---
I was thinking about this and i have two ideas. One, only the owner can fast travel inside the shelter, the other players only appear in the camp. Two, you now have two icons to fast travel "camp" and "shelter" and you decide in what of those appear. The icons in the map should look like Charlie silo and the place near to it. I don't know if you can have the shelter in another place or it has to be next to your camp, only time can give us the answer.
---
Same thing with consumables/chems.  And also projectiles/weapons.  They should have separate menus.
---
Insult me below so I get reminded to check after work :)

Shhh lol
---
Yeah =) also JE Gatling Laser... But I don't like people using them in groups and shredding everything. It's just annoying for myself if someone kills everything instantly without giving others the chance to tag enemies. As if it's not possible to kill enemies with other weapons. It's easy enough in this game :D it's a hell of fun using the legacies but i always think if you want to kill everything by yourself, then do not join other people... It's just annoying for others. I just assume you are not the kind of people I am talking about :D
---
Or a VTU cap for 4 :) (check my post history lol)
---
i dont farm legendaries, but twice now since i started (level 79 right now) ive been maxeed on legndary scrips - so if im having trouble without evenb farming them, im sure yall must be frustrated with this other scrips that i havbent heard of yet
---
It is here. Look closer. In its own spot with no variants.
---
Now I want a 'death trap another player' daily challenge
---
Someone bought 5000x 5.56 rounds from my vendor yesterday when I was raiding vault 79. So that was a nice and simple way to get 5000 caps.
---
Love the wall idea and would love a blood splattered shower curtain or curtains (think psycho movie). 
---
Would be cool to have knives, axes, tomahawks, etc that we could add to walls as decorations with blood dripping from them. 
---
Oh and spider webs to add to the porch, etc. maybe even some green/orange lights instead of the blue/yellow vault-etc colors
---
If you’re on PS4 I have 4 fuzzy outfits and helmets lmk
---
Carry excavator PA for that sweet +100 carry weight
---
r/unexpectedmacklemore
---
HAHAHAHAHAH... well played!!
---
That would actually be a good idea. Intelligent power armor energy weapon would be an awesome sight.
---
Brahmin meat, Radstag meat, Radtoad legs. Holy trinity of carry weight food.
---
I do this but I have been burned before by the love tap being too small....Since I switched to my PA tank I usually hit the legendary a couple times, emote and move out of the way. I have on my Bloodied char (I stopped using him as I am enjoying my PA more since the patch) I have accidently done this. I even once emoted and accidently took out the mob as it was beating on me. For that I apologize to anyone there. I usually try to switch to lower damage weapon when doing an event and a legendary pops up. Harder now that the quick change bug totally lags out my computer.
---
i couldnt figure out how to do that at grahams bbq - there was so much stuff going on all at once, i was shooting rats then banging on the drums then adding stuff to the bbq. very confusing
---
You don't do it via steam.
---
You should have a Bethesda account. Just install Bethesda launcher, install 76 pts (different install than base game) &amp; login with Bethesda account.
---
Should be same character but 1st &amp; Atoms don't carry over.
---
Seen that a couple times, opened up 400 presents and bought it. That was my offer lol
---
Yeah I do but there is idiots that like to one shot shit
---
I can't tell, sorry - I linked my accounts long ago just in case but still use the Beth launcher. If it does not work you could ask in the official Bethesda forums about it (needs an account too of course...). Maybe wait a while, someone else here might have done it already.
---
Im sorry. Im not insulting you. Thats not what was ment to come across. I apologize for that.
---
That is 100% outdated information, two-shot has been heavily nerfed due to being too strong in the past.
---
Can't you get fireman outfit at overseers house now?
---
I see Caperboii is that you?
---
Hey I'm just coming back after a long hiatus. Why are these masks desirable? Just collecting value?
---
Those are good too.  They just require more crafting ingredients.  I don't usually have Gulpher innards, so I go with the ribeyes.  The only require brahmin meat.
---
I'm bloodied.
---
And I was alone ( in a daily ops team) and they never joined me despite seeing me dying over and over.
---
They’re not, that’s the problem. Only a couple are and they’re 99% never there. Just bait to see what’s in the vendor
---
Doea it work on the ammo converter
---
Imagine being a Str Rifleman and being able to effectively use combat knife in sticky situations.
---
Ahh.  Gotcha.  Got Firebreathers/Responders mixed up.
---
Yes it was nerfed in the past but they changed it again in more recent patches.
---
That’s the red outfit set that you can get by doing the story (I’m sure), the rare set is a white helmet and a dark blue uniform- extremely rare drop from dailies and one of the first story missions, that’s the only way to get it, and even then it drops in two pieces so even harder to get a full set
---
I’ve never understood this. I have a super op pistol build. Granted it involves every single pistol in the game as a tse variant, but I solo daily ops no problem.
---
It is possible
---
So I have played Skyrim, No Man's Sky an some old Sega Genesis games through steam and I installed Marrowind through the Bethesda launcher and loaded it just fine.
---
Is there another game I could try that would help us identify a problem?
---
I have had random seemingly corrupted or glitched things like that in my inventory  that will crash the game when selected. Only happened one or two times. Dunno what causes it though.
---
Nm. Got the Firebreathers/Responders mixed up.
---
What no love for Deathclaw steaks, stingwing fillets or molerat chunks? They stack with ribeye to give even more carry weight bonus.
---
No problem, I am glad you were able to get it to work. Hopefully bethesda will add interior walls soon so we don't have to use that trick anymore.
---
Yeah, I’ve done that so many times, easiest mistake to make mate
---
lol that wasn’t what I meant :D I just wanted a random comment so I get a notification which will remind me in about an hour when I get home as a reminder!
---
What, you don't like making a bazillion radtoad omelettes you may never need to eat? :D
---
I didnt know you can put things in the punch bowl :O
---
I have a shrine of Gamma Guns. One of each variant. But may we ask if you’ll bask in Atom’s light and let him wash away your sins?
---
We all know what passes as standards &amp; quality at Bethesda so... Yeah.
---
Getting rid of any part of the grind would be lovely.
---
can people just steal your stuff thought?
---
I recently read a post where the said takes animals don’t count towards your camp budget.
---
Ah thanks for that
---
Gulper Lagoon for the Innards.
---
Also you have to reload more often. Also, bullets was just one of my points. Idk what the discussion. You really supporting 2 sec lagg because you don't have issues with farming bullets?
---
Gotchya...Im still kinda noobish to reddit amd the day to day verbiage.lol
---
Elder is soloable, at least for me as a shafted melee build since obj charge mechanic is stupid and doesn't let me have fun. I just idle behind something while enemies just stand in the distant being dumb and approach me ages later if ever till I finally get to genocide things in kill objective. Only time solo may not give me enough time is if I get a billion freeze procs when trying to kill last boss and my swings take 5 years. Generally have a full minute or more to kill him.
---
All the work to get a bloodied gauss shotgun to just keep it on storage. It just doesn't work
---
I just dropped 14 lbs worth 
---
 Thanks for reminding me
---
I dont think the vast majority calls people who choice to play the game in a different way (staying away for pvp) little bitches. The moment you start using insults about people I instantly disregard the opinion.   I do get what your saying but by using Insults you just come across salty.
---
How about the forest camo jumpsuit?  I have one but can't seem to get a second - and I get trade requests for it regularly.
---
Because the PVE aspects were what they wanted, and the PVP aspects can be ignored easily.
---
It's difficult to tell, at least you have narrowed it down to being fallout 76. I see some people are making internet related suggestions. I think a possible way to troubleshoot this further would be for you to try to play the game from a trusted friend's computer. Not sure if that's an option for you?
---
I've always refused to use mutations until I could have class freek 3 and starched genes. Early game is rough. All my new characters rush caps to buy heavy leather and once I can craft level 20 heavy I use that all the way to 50. Sadly with the lower durability constantly need armor bench but leather is cheap to repair.
---
This would be my main concern as well. I’m also wondering if the upcoming mannequins and PA displays could come with the same issue.
---
Framerate would inherently improve. Jeff even said as much in the video. It's resolution &amp; texture quality that'd be the main issue
---
It’s in misc for me
---
Sounds like Matt just completed a few Daily Ops!

I usually do mine at 11pm eastern every night.  If you wanna add me would love to get a set team together.
---
Nooooo :(
---
Funniest thing I have read in a long time
---
They reset every 24 hours.
---
I have a sign on mine that says "NUKA ROULETTE" and "TRY YOUR LUCK".
---
It has 1 of every Nuka Cola, and the rest is Nukashine.  I refill it on Tuesdays lol.
---
Exactly. I feel like nuke launches need to feel like you've "earned" them, but as it stands it's a lot of work for a payoff that isn't always equivalent.
---
I say this as someone who has a bunch of nuke cards in his inventory and hasn't felt like running a silo in a while.
---
Thanks for the recap!
---
I read here it doesn't work.
---
It is not.  I don't have any friends that play the game.
---
However I may be able to have a friend install the game and then log in on their computer.
---
It needs a ready up system.
---
Shocking that perk loadouts are being pushed back again. They say they listen to the community, but this is something people have been asking about for a long time. So what the duck they listening too?
---
So they are actually going through with the moronic idea of "toning down" the already watered down "survival" system. That's a big yikes.
---
Also no mention of text chat or other basic online game features and perk loadouts keep getting pushed back... fucking lol. Maybe they should hop on over to Nexus and pick up some of these features that modders already made for them if they can't be assed to do it themselves.
---
What about ultracite Tesla coil plan ?
---
Its in misc
---
Not true.. It's better because you can start it farther back. Could record the queen dying in 3 seconds.
---
Then there's that annoying "warning" you get when try to drop them and don't know the plan. I'm pretty much scrapping junk here, Bethesda. I know what I'm doing.
---
As long as it’s strictly „look-don’t-touch“ it should be fine. The weapon displays work the same way afterall.
---
Wait till you start actually crafting the pieces and notice you can get 1-2 stars as well, plus only 3 modules a day (few exceptions)  
---
The gold grind is nothing compared to the actual crafting process
---
It would, alongside faster loading - but that's due to the higher console specs, not anything done by the developers. It won't go up to 60 FPS until they properly optimize it and unlock the framerate themselves. For now, it'll have stable framerate at 30 FPS compared to the terrible framerate on current-gen.
---
Anyone's house you can bring your desktop to try and play from their internet connection? I know that sounds like a pain, it would potentially write of your router as being the issue. I know it's a lot of effort though just for the one game.
---
They’re boosted by whatever you have equipped. My grenades and thrown melees are doing +50% because of junkies
---
I didn't have that much of a problem with it in the Burrows because the spaces are all smalk and they generally have to get close to hit you too. But in the Galleria it's too much. I can't do it alone anyway.
---
Yeah after the fact I thought about having them install the game and log in.
---
you mean +200 with the limb mods, wouldnt be worth it for me otherwise with unyielding gear and backpack
---
Yep. It's solo-able even in slow ass PA. Just focus on the objectives and melt the boss.

Yea people are building pistols while ignoring vats/crits and wondering why they can't compete with rifles when the strong suit of pistols is their low cost in vats. That being said, maybe they could move some pistol perks to a different special so your AGI isn't cramped but that would fuck up existing builds
---
An interview came up on Youtube with Jeff Gardiner on GamerHubTV, this is moved to the Winter update with BoS. 11.30 ish on that video
---
He needed more space apparently. I think the stuff he gave me was 200 extra weight lmao.
---
Grilled radstag as well boosts carry weight
---
I play on the PS4 and i never see them in use other than the rare TSE Flamer players and you come across them at best once a month or less.
---
I already got one, thank you though!
---
If pvp can be ignored then don’t get pissed at me when you start a battle you can’t finish and I steal your junk.  That’s the main goal here.
---
Nah i’ll usually run solo. I’ll pull it out during sbq or earle if the group is struggling towards the end but only then
---
Sorry, you are correct. I was thinking of the firebreathers, you're talking about responders fireman outfit. My bad!
---
If you trust them and they're not gona mess around with your account (like deleting your character and that sort of thing) it is worth looking into for sure. Fresh instal, different computer and different internet. If that doesn't work then you know the problem is on Bethesda's end
---
No mention of rad ant lager? I keep a stockpile for those true emergencies where grilled radstag (always preferred it over your fancy steak for some reason) and whiskey just don't cut it anymore. Also I usually try to keep a lightweight melee weapon with +1strengh for squeezing a little more carryweight when needed, my main uses WWR armor so his VSSS Fire Axe weighs less than half a pound and my alt has a Boxing Glove that weighs 1.0 so I still net gain 4.0 carry when I equip it.
---
Might not, thought I saw a guy using it yesterday in a group but could've been mistaken. I'll try it myself next time its resilient. I was a bit disappointed that meat Cleavers didnt work when I tested them so I stopped after 1 Elder completion.
---
Vats has been broken for years and they haven't fixed it so I'm guessing no plus they just nerfed concentrated fire making it even worse now
---
Yeah the day after it dropped I did my first one at like roughly level 20 and it was the same resilient robots but in the sewers and I had no fucking idea what I was doing and burned through every bit of my main weapons ammo and all my stimpaks and I broke the game for myself for a little while xD come to realize daily oops are literally the best way to gain ammo and stimpaks later on lol
---
*slaps the roof of my garage*
---
*Wall falls down*
---
Yep, got all the ammo you could want in this baby right here. Like seriously, buy some ammo. I have too much.
---
Why does he have 2.3 million Mr fuzzy tokens?
---
I'm actually sick of getting radworms every two minutes, lol. They can bring back survival mode in the future and add all the survival elements there for people who like that stuff. I honestly prefer a casual experience like past Fallout games.
---
Rad Ant Lager gives you +50 for a minute, then -50 for another minute.  I always keep a few in my inventory.
---
Personally I use grilled radstag the most though, because radstags are everywhere in this game, and they usually appear in groups, too.  I usually have enough of this stuff to constantly operate with the buff though, so I find myself over encumbered even with the increased carry weight haha.
---
Add me Tsumz :)
---
Anytime I'm on you can come to me and I'll drop them for you. What's your ID?
---
They really do, it's ridiculous how bare bones multiplayer features are in this multiplayer game.
---
Great for on my front porch.
---
Another way to farm ammo is to clear daily ops using the plasma caster since it uses the same ammo type as your plasma guns at a much lower ammo consumption rate.
---
My Silver Shroud outfit hides it now: it showed at first, but when I switched outfits then back it concealed it. Now the Silver Shroud shoots fiery propellant from his shoulders as he flies into the sky...  lol
---
How about unique mods? Like the wood armor can have a camouflage when in forest, or robot armor can have a chance to make an attack energy based. It differentiates the armor from being good only stats wise. Same for weapons, like the spear and war glaive should have the longest range of melee.
---
Am I the only one who gets disappointed when there is actually no Nukashine in the punch bowl/keg/nuka cola vending machine?
---
They want to do things other than Meat Week and then show up *after* the warm-up timer is up when it is convenient for them. Their argument is that it's UnFaIR if the event closes quickly because they don't want to have to be present or participate while it actually occurs.
---
Hey, that's a really good tip, thanks! 👍🏼
---
I’m pretty sure I have it...
---
Xbox?
---
I’ve seen that, but at the same time, that’s frankly an unintended side effect of the legendary weapon system. It may make them more powerful on builds with the proper legendary weapons, but I still think they deserve their own damage perk card or should benefit from one of the existing ones.
---
[This should help you out!](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iwnmss/how_to_tame_a_pet_post_patch_22/) There are vids, maps and LOADS of suggestions as well as what you need to do exactly to tame!
---
Depends on the ammo. .45 and .38 are .0003 each, 5mm is .0001 each, most others are between that or higher
---
Not tamable, unfortunately :(
---
That's what I've been doing but it was getting difficult without equipment that was good enough to fight in. I was actively avoiding fighting and trying to race through areas as enemies were just mowing me down and I had nothing to heal with and was trying to learn how to farm ammo.
---
So the removal of the survival mechanics makes the survival shortcut legendary perk useless 😒
---
Do you use vats? It seems like a lot of people just neglect vats and wonder why their pistol is just a worse rifle. That being said, we could use more end game pistols that aren't revolvers or gauss.
---
Maybe tie it into endurance. They freeze you in ops.
---
I mean, sure, it's not necessarily outright undoable, but it is just... counterintuitive at best. Like being told to get something out of the middle of a huge pool - without getting wet.
---
Might be on later tonight with a friend. I will give you a shout if I remember!

Yeah I had a good laugh at that myself hahaha, it really made my day

I just wish I could see the item instead of just its name. Not really a fun way to shop.
---
It's not popular on here, but not even a mention of Nuclear Winter?

True. Plus, I don’t believe I’ve heard anything about ally outfits being taken, so that’s reassuring for the new displays
---
I didn't know you could put it in your machines. Know what I'm doing next time I'm on...

It's sounds like you are asking about our upcoming service Fallout 2nd.

Man I used to find the alternative nukas all the time; like I'd find cherry as often as regular, quantumes were almost 1 in 10; and a good handful of the others too

Every since A Colossal Problem though it's been nothing but regular
---
I got the ring when I first started playing when the game came out and never took it off my character lol. I love it.
---
Ah, ok.
---
Buddy of mine had like 50 lbs of inert flux he forgot about... now he’s lighter than a feather lol. Always pays to look through your inventory.

I’m guilty with the gunpowder since they decided to put it in misc instead of junk. I’ve been trying to only craft as much as I need to limit it.

You forgot two perks - green thumb can be used to make water filters, and contractor reduces the cost of crafting any camp structure.
---
Also - PA Smith it primarily for crafting PA from what I remember and not for the mods, though I don’t recall if it’s required for any mods in particular.
---
Sorry man I’ll upvote for visibility and hopefully someone will come through. Good luck !
---
I teamed with someone yesterday just fine, they shot them up and I just tapped them with a powerfist or bashed them. Elder first try, but it did require one person to be melee to make the timer for elder.
---
Gun bash.

I also seen this post:

They suggested to:

Turn off Internet, go to C:\Program Files\Bethesda.net Launcher\games\Fallout76 and turn on the game frome fallout76.exe, enter your username and password (dont pres enter) turn on Internet back, and go press enter
---
I’m afraid I cannot match your narrative with what I’ve observed since ‘beta.’ 
---
The failure of PVP had everything to do with its confusing systems and Bethesda Austin’s inept handling. They wanted to be all things to all people, and ended up pleasing no-one. PVP could be initiated freely, but it also had modes in the form of workshops and a couple of events. Neither were well realised. That kind of indecisiveness has been a recurring theme over the past two years. Systems like slap damage should’ve died on the drawing board. 
---
Can you honestly say that survival mode got the support it needed? Because from your ‘dragged away kicking and screaming’ comment it sounds like the devs’ support must have been tireless. Likewise, they must’ve tried out some new systems for adventure mode PVP before giving up? As opposed to just truncating what was there so people would stop complaining?
---
Someone using a gatling laser, I disagree. Unload into them, run up, bash, go to the next. Easy.
---
Freezing pisses me off being a shotgun and heavy user. Never finish reloading the shotgun, never get the heavy to finish spinning up.
---
Sounds like you are describing situations where PVP cannot be avoided easily. Most players want those removed entirely, along with all PVP.
---
No I was using the 10mm, I had a bloodied explosive that was decent for low levels but as a lvl 220+ I no longer have the pleasure of mowing down low levels with my guns
---
Who would have thought that if you remove player-versus-player content there would be a lack of players engaging in player-versus-player content?
---
Dang! I remember the loot bags, didn’t see/remember the bats 😞
---
All good man! Tames are a pain in the ass from the drop lol. I posted a comment with a link that will help out tho! :)
---
Because aside from a few reward events, they've largely ignored it for six months now.
---
I no longer have hope it'll be anything more than what it is now.
---
I use my 3 star vampire flamer on daily ops every day(on the melee kill I wait to use it until the boss pops—the bash damage breaks it too easily). It’s a tricky weapon to max out because of all the perk cards you have to pull from.  With legendary perks, it’s really easy to max out.  That said, a lot of people I talk to love the flamer....but keeping fuel handy is the problem.  With daily ops....that’s no longer an issue IMO.
---
It's still the only thing I have in my vendor cuz people keep saying that it always sells but no one has bought any.
---
If you are trying to get a certain plan (e.g., Plan:  Meat Tenderizer), it's possible to go 100+ event cycles before you get it. (I got my Meat Tenderizer plan on my 102nd event.) 
---
Legit answer, if you are running the event hourly, only investing 4 mins per hour instead of 10 mins per hour lessens family aggro significantly. After all, 10mins per hour is 1/6th of your waking time. 4mins an hour is 40% of that.
---
i feel like a clown now cause i completely forgot about the bashing part with guns. at least now i know what to do. it was my first time around with Daily Ops so now next time will probably be a lot smoother, or so i hope. good luck to you in your future Ops battles
---
Really!?  Marked at 1 cap right?
---
It did! Thanks
---
Yes you can back all the way out when you’re finished, if you’re doing more than one kind of ammo I’m not sure if backing out and going back in would be any faster.
---
Ran in in under 6 minutes, having friends helps a lot in that one can be the gunner the other dedicated to melee. You both win since no matter what you both get the xp compared to when I go in and just slaughter everything.   
---
I just think it is funny that people complain about a challenge, it is an optional mode you are not required to do it. It is also nice to have variety and a challenge for once. But I guess this just further proves participation trophy winners will whine at anything hard.
---
Bruh it isn’t even that bad what are you waffling about...
---
Agreed that it is annoying (worst compared to the other mutations, but at least its different), but its mostly from players not being coordinated.  Both of the resilient daily I have done I waited for a full team and even then no one used melee, we all just bashed with our equipped gun.
---
If only resilient could only be killed by Melee **and** Grenades, give Molotovs a place to shine other then just tagging enemies.
---
cooking pot towards the center of the area lets one turn in Prime meats for "Meat Sweats" buff
---
🤣
---
Same man on PS4 also. Even finding a team they don’t join the op
---
with ammo and stimpaks i noticed that too. ended up getting like 5 super stimpaks. at least now i know i can use bashing with my guns to finish the bastards off, lol. its a first time going at it so not fully knowing whats going on will happen but shit it was a fight and a half. hell i actually thought my game was gonna crash. had a level 100 assaultron as the final boss and i kept trying to stimpak myself and the lag was so intense that i thought oh great here we go
---
Glad to see that daily ops is something they are going to continue adding to in the future, FO76 always suffered from a lack of endgame but these daily ops give me something to do even at full build.
---
Yep, and the only thing I have over 10 caps are current event rewards. Players usually pick up plans sometimes chems but still no ammo sells lol
---
I have carnivore mutation and I get double the meat bonus. So with ribeye and grilled radstag I get 40 extra carry weight. So I def always carry some around if I know I’m going to be carrying over 500 carry weight. With the bonus of ribeye I can carry 600+ during the day it’s nice
---
I get people coming in to buy them at the default 150 a pop because I was way too lazy to put a price on 30 individual items.
---
I saw a interview with Todd and Pete on the microsoft thing. Todd looked like he been out in the sun for months on a island with Matt Lauer. He isn't working on stuff lol I didn't hear any 3d printing going on in the background or nothing!
---
If you want to see something added/changed, please make sure your voices are HEARD. The developers and community managers are constantly on Reddit / Beth.net forums. 
---
Not happy with the non-existent plan for next gen? Let Bethesda know!
---
I wonder if this is the purpose of the “bombs drop” content that is purportedly on the way.
---
Excavator PA plus shocks will give you close to 400 carry weight. Perk cards is what you need to adjust. I use chemist back pack and switch the the chem weight perk cards when I put on PA
---
I hear the cash register at the rusty pick is a popular spot for scrip legendaries.
---
Properly as it can take 10 minutes to get out going back through all the pages. Thanks ill give it a go later.
---
Pff, it's actually day 645, and there's already been one "fix" to the midriff textures.
---
Get your facts straight 😐
---
Who?
---
Shoot until that last slither of health, then gun bash 🙂
---
We’re also getting expeditions early next year as part of the endgame experience.
---
They could start by pulling the perks out of agility. That poor tree has all the supporting perks we'd want to get to buff the already poor damage but there's not enough room to get all the good stuff that rifles get.
---
Yeh, you can choose any perk to level up, it doesn't have to be a perk on the SPECIAL stat you choose. There should be a filtering option when choosing perks that you can use, look at the bottom of the screen it will tell you how to filter depending on which console you are on.
---
NW seems to get worse and worse after each update. It's a dead mode and unfortunately, Bethesda clearly doesn't care about it. For the mode to succeed they would have to nerf explosives, remove vats in NW, fix majority of bugs currently in it, and probably even make a new map like Watoga for it. If they did those things lobbies wouldn't be as hard to find as they are now.
---
It's psychological warfare. I price them based on perceived rarity (200-1k) and people are more than happy to buy them. If I price too low people give no shits.
---
Yes stat and card pick are not linked.  You can use buttons (shoulder on PS4) to pick a stat then pick a different perk card
---
It’s easy done man I had 7 sets of the things because I kept getting mixed up haha!
---
Outside of Vats shotguns do less damage it’s not much less but it is noticeable. Also turn on damage counter. Plus shotguns are really close range in FO 76 unless you take scatter shot perk which tightens up the spread greatly at certain ranges you will miss a lot.
---
Look around at the little stream behind the Wayward, maybe a little bit north, and the rafting supplies are all there.
---
I’d recommend getting an AA ballistic weapon to do good damage.
---
My question is why my flamer doesn't work with the friendly fire perk.
---
I'm the same, I just try to help where I can but staying in the range is more important so I just stay right at the edge, except for when they are freezing then I have to pull out my Gatlin Lazer to be of any help
---
I literally had a game freeze on loading screen 5 minutes after commenting :D
---
Just use excavator power armor I can carry 560 in that. I always carry the same level 25 I have had since I got it and I’m level 340 and played since launch. I have t65 but only can carry 430ish in that. So I keep that with me but only use when I want better defense. I am a hoarder of everything so my character can carry 580 to 630 with out power armor and with excavator I can do 560 I believe. I gotta usually transfer stuff or drop it so I can actually use t65.
---
Before 50 you do not have to take a perk in the same special trait you put the level up point into.  You could say put a point into endurance and then pick slugger in strength.
---
After 50 you can pick whatever perk you like at each level up.
---
This game lacks plenty of QoL overall.
---
The current one that annoys me currently is weapon/armor condition bar. It is annoying to compare power armor parts since I need to take it from my chassis to actually see if condition bar is longer than the newest piece I found. Also  to see how much actually condition bar is reduced (by points or percentage) when you are deciding which mod to take.
---
I started just selling all of my meat. Takes way too long to cook stuff. My dude is on an all corn diet. I wonder what his dumps look like.
---
Darn.  I was hoping that it was functional defense coil.
---
Still very rare and valuable, I’ve been trying to get one for ages but I’ve blown through all my good gear getting the other ones
---
That’s not what they said../

Now anyone who I use is going to have the same ISP.  Its what's in the area.  I don't know if that going to impact my results but we shall see.  Most of my friends are not PC gamers but I am checking with them now.
---
 Ultracite Calibrated Shocks   this I need will pay $$$
---
Does the bug zapper do anything? Is there little zap noises as if things are flying in it or does it just glow and take my atoms?
---
You're the first person I've ever seen mention this here, and I've been wondering when they were gonna put this in since launch. Such a simple, time saving feature that its crazy it hasn't been implemented already.
---
what are those?
---
Irony, edgelord or both?
---
Looking at the seasonal roadmap, the fact that there is a "bombs drop day" makes me think that, at the very least, it's a "celebration" of the day that the bombs dropped in the fallout universe (as that's the day being celebrated). Also, it's described as a week long event leading up to the day. Not sure if any changes would be a part of it, but it's anybody's guess at this point.
---
Another good thing would be to add a third perk to starched genes for a third star and have it so you can choose mutations at certain levels of radiation. But for each new mutation it takes away those rads.
---
I might pass on the freezing one the next time lol that one was rough for a melee build
---
Not a glitch. There was a major update to the game almost 2 weeks ago. Information about it is readily available on the game's website.
---
That's informative, thanks!  Happy to hear about the building interest
---
Its really showing up for me with the Gauss Shotgun. Guaranteed to miss the first shot at *least* if not more. Then coupled with the 'recharge jam' i get on the shotgun which prevents you from using VATS or heal etc unless you bash or holster it to cancel the 'jam' its amazingly frustrating.  
---
As a sniper with a Gauss rifle since the beginning i'm finally able to be a sole ammo source and then this all happens borking everything. it'd be nice if u/ladydevann or someone ran this up the pole there.
---
I sold three last night at 10 caps a pop.  Still got way too much inventory though.
---
I do. Vats and criticals are key, but either way I can still kill a level 100 scorched with about 4 bullets on most of my weapons. Rngesus decided to give me 2 tse black powders also, so my gameplay style generally is pepper dudes in vats with me tse 10mm until my crit bar fills then pop heads with the black powders. Agree on the end game pistols though. I’d like to see the plasma defender make an appearance. Basically just a 10mm with higher ballistic, but also energy damage and a good rate of fire
---
Welcome to One Wasteland. Up until you hit LVL50, everything will level up with you. After that, many things will level up with you until you hit LVL100, but some things will be capped at 50.
---
I totally agree. I get tired of seeing mods and skins for supersledges. Sure I get that some weapons are far more popular than others.
---
But maybe that’s because some weapons have been made to be be way better than others. 
---
There’s no reason why some weapons can’t have more mods. Example, why can’t axes have a couple mods that add some sort of energy damage? Or maybe bleed damage? Or increase a chance to break a limb?
---
I much more prefer a weapon that looks like it’s made from a variety of items.
---
Heck, maybe worth a shot. Also i linked to a post with a potential solution, but I don't know if it is relevant...
---
|  Rifleman and being able to effectively use combat knife 
---
You can do without legendary perks.
---
Pre One Wasteland, I was already 15 STR, 13 PER. switching seamlessly between rifles and melee as the situation demanded.
---
The mode no one asked for and hardly plays outside a bonus objective for SCORE? No, I don't think they give a shit about it.
---
You don't have to be bloodied at all to use magic weapons. Angry Turtle has done vids on the weapons as both bloodied and high health  and shows they are ridiculously OP in everyone's hands.
---
Found protocols in a vendor for 30k not too long ago. Guess guy was displaying it until my little mule showed up and bought, think he roid raged.
---
here have a paid wood armour skin in bright turquoise no one asked for with your own private nuclear winter mode *new* play by yourself and still loose
---
That’s what I do with plasma cartridges. 
---
I collect the copper veins and whatnot everytime I leave my camp and always end up with a good bit so I sell them. When I need more it’s only a minute walk from my camp to collect more. 
---
Some people amaze me with wanting 15 caps for one tiny piece of copper, or lead, etc and 1000 caps plus on most items.
---
Rip lmg.
---
I'd kill for Recon HUD on ultracite power armor
---
All enemies scale with you since One Wasteland dropped 10 days ago. So a level 11 sees level 11 enemies, a level 70 will see level 70 enemies etc (there are floors and ceilings for certain enemy levels)
---
I don’t know how it could be impossible to do though. What weapons and armor are you using? What perks?
---
All that said, they are doing some balancing around mid level enemies in a hot fix soon(ish)
---
Try it in one wasteland.
---
Just another mirelurk orgy spot.
---
They're listening to all the people who took infiltrator and are no longer complaining about switching cards to open doors and terminals.
---
Vats and heavy weapons dont mix unless it's a single shot like the gatling gun or the plasma caster.  Heavy weapons simply burn through way too many AP per shot.
---
You want str and int for a heavy weapons build since heavy weapons thrive in power armor.  Stabalized perk is the key.  It makes all the difference.
---
I’ve had issues with mini nukes. I pick them up, it adds the weight, but doesn’t show in my inventory until I relog. It’ll also show my fat man with 0 ammo
---
I think that making weapons viable through legendary perks is a terrible idea, because those weapons should be viable before you hit level 50. If they need to do anything it's tweak the non-legendary perk cards to make them viable instead.
---
Gunsmith also reduced the rate of weapon degradation.
---
My fixer still breaks incredibly fast. Even with perk cards. I can’t use it during events as it will break 3-5 times.
---
That would just completely outclass the 10mm then. I would do some kind of high stopping power pistol with a low ROF, high dmg, good mag size but slightly heavier.
---
Day 2?  You gotta pump those numbers up.  Those are rookie numbers in this racket
---
If you have a friend one of you gets a tesla rifle preferably OP and one has the melee. You spam the tesla and bash who ever you can and the melee cleans up the rest. Works even better with 2 tesla and 2 melee.
---
I remember when I stumbled out of the vault, not knowing that it costs caps to build your C.A.M.P., but was told that I get atoms for my first setup of it. So I did it almost next to the vault and then had no caps to move it again. Visiting the moonshiner cabin was the next failure because I used all my 5 rounds of ammo I had on those bloody ticks that attacked me there. When I reached the road I ran into some wild mongrels and died. It was one of the worst starts in any game I played and it took quite some time to not struggle all the time while following the quests and level up.
---
I also remember that I was always in the need of radaway and never found enough and now I have so much that I sell it to some vendor every now and then.... I think it might be a good idea to put it in my vending machine for low level players now.
---
Don't let it get you down. Besides all the issues one might have with this game it is also a lot of fun most of the time, too. Otherwise there weren't so many people still playing it. :)
---
Online games are prob not for you at this stage in life...
---
Yes. Each bullet on two shot does 62.5% of base damage, meaning IF both hit you are doing the 25% extra damage described. 25% would be the best idea as it is slightly weaker than a creature specific weapon that would deal 30% damage. So, as a jack-of-all-trades I would think 25% additional should be good.
---
They did this to me on purpose? This sucks.
---
So I'm gathering from you post the BOS fatigues are fixed and can be worn as under armor?
---
On, PS4 happens every once in a while
---
If you mean monster mash as a pvp event, yeah the rewards aren't good because you burn too much stuff fighting people, but if you run it with people who agree not to pvp, or solo, the rewards are great. Usually about 3-6 legendary items, 1k Halloween candy (which is one of the best food items in the game), and 10-15 of each of the specialty chems (berry mentats, psychotats, etc).
---
It wouldn’t make sense if the ultracite gatling laser was weaker. They were made to be stronger counterparts that were better against the scorched and scorchbeasts, not weaker variants
---
Dont worry i get annoyed when im shopping for plans and the camp says 100+ plans. I show up, and its all mounted head plans that NO ONE wants.
---
I was thinking of it more to become a speclist in that weapon over making them viable but now i think on it there should be better balance over all first maybe. Then look in to doing something like this to get people perks to become a speclist in to some hardly used weapons over all.
---
I still doubt with just damage buffs you would see any one use the Fatman/ML/Flamer/Cyro for anything for the lolz. I was basing this off Warframes Riven system that had special Mods that can make poor weapons good only with out the RNG behind rivens.
---
I'd be happy to help you out. My PSN is GattoDiavolo68 and I play around 10:00pm EST.

Visited a camp once that put 2000 .38 for 0 caps. Safe to say I took all of them for my legendary pipe pistol. The little thing rips stuff apart at 40% extra speed.
---
Yep.  Just wait til those mole rats are lvl 100 and there are 10 of the bouncing in and out of the ground.
---
I love you big boys shooting big booms or using big sticks. Makes my sneaky snek job fun
---
Yeah, having to eat and drink makes the game more realistic.
---
I have the limb mods too and it’s def sweet I go up to 465 carry weight lol. Unyielding is fun too tho especially bloodied because you can basically just sprint forever
---
It’s already enough for me! So I assume I could play the same character with the same process on PS5, am I right?
---
Participation trophy winner haha, nope im just an unpopular suggestion maker.
---
And i dont have an issue with all the challenges just this one as  you need a specialty build or perhaps those who claim to run it in record time without specialty builds are not tackling fully leveled enemies which would certainly be a breeze.
---
&gt;tedious tasks while being pelted by turrets
---
If this could stop being a design philosophy in general I'd be pretty stoked. Playing melee just makes any encounter like this painful and irritating.
---
Worth a small fortune mate! Hope you get something cool for em mate!
---
I also headed straight for the vault to get the guardian then pick up the deliverer as it was the only guaranteed silenced gun I could get before picking the perk for them. Is two shot a legendary perk in 76? I've not come across any legendary perks worth keeping yet, just trade them in and eventually get something equally shit from the purveyor
---
Did I write a Bethesda please post? I just voiced an opinion that it doesn’t work for me. People need to Get off the damn fan boy soap box were any form of dicent is scolded.
---
I’ve found my bloodied build works well with a vampires ultracite Gatling and concentrated fire + tenderizer
---
Hi again!  Thank you for the guide,  currently referring to your guide actually cuz it was posted on my other post,  i did get a few tameable creatures like deathclaw and megasloth and i regret getting that mirelurk hunter lol
---
Bye megasloth :(
---
Anyway, seems like im having a badluck on the snallycutie to spawn...  T~T
---
No confirmation yet. My best guess is yes since save data is tied to your PSN/Bethesda account.
---
I'm slowly working on getting a couple of decent sets together for Ops. I usually roll without any armour (stealth berserker) but these missions have completely changed my playstyle. Right now I just wear my Chinese Stealth Suit when I do 'em.
---
I don’t know about everyone else but hitting artificial time gating like this in a game makes me quit, not log in more often.
---
Also: not using the community's ideas is not the same thing as ignoring the community.
---
I’ll be delighted if I could play it with a better spec which has faster reloading screen
---
Same here. But the fanboys and Bethesda employees doing damage control will swarm any post with criticisms to be neutral or negative upvotes. Every time. Gotta sort by controversial to see actual players' posts now.
---
I'll most likely give it to a friend if they don't know it. At this point caps I can get, I have my guns, armor is Secret Service. I think at this point I'd be willing to swap for fun stuff like junk or outfits.
---
It’s part of the one world update patch 22. All Enemies basically now match your level. In addition some weapons have had their damage stats reduced. Been quite tough on some especially around your level. Bethesda are aware and have said they plan to tweek going forwards see thread below...
---

---
In the meantime I’ve found the best thing to do is to stack your perks on damage multipliers and endurance, the enemies are now tanks so to match then you have to become a tank yourself. 
---
On the plus side you do level up much faster.
---
If you're on PS I'd love to check it out sometime! :)
---
Yeah!!
---
You guys raved over our quest autocomplete feature...
---
Now, it's the Workshop auto build feature!
---
Everytime you take over a workshop, every possible repair and resource construction happens automatically!  No need to check your stash, we will pull those supplies out for you.
---
Best part, if you don't have enough resources to complete all the structures we have implemented a lay away plan.
---
We take what resources you have and give you a very handy shopping list, would you like us to provide the remaining supplies.
---
Damn right you do!  That will be tree fitey.
---
Side note, I never drop my freakin armor. Ever. So, not only do I not know how that would have happened why wasn't there a bag right there with it if I had dropped it. It was an event and it was over but I may have panicked and clicked drop favorite accidentally. It should have been there to pick up tho.
---
If it wasn't a mule account selling without any caps, he probably lost quite some caps from the 30k. Well, congratulations, you are one of a few proud ultracite protocol owners now :-)
---
Lol this.
---
I often play bloody tank: born survivor plus dodgy plus serendility plus ricochet?  I swear i heal my team more often because BS prove every 20s
---
Exactly!  Also, when you take cover a lot of those robots that need finishing off will come to you, meaning you don't have to leave the radius to bash them
---
I specifically wanted a Snally for one of my builds and it took roughly a week of some SERIOUS server hopping. You WILL find it! :D
---
You've found the real endgame boss. Busted coding.
---
Please don't.  It's really the only one of the ops combos that's even challenging.  And even then just plop in 1/4 electric absorption and put one guy on melee cleanup duty and its GG.
---
Not going to happen, but I am always shopping for stable flux.
---
Aye the true endgame! What platform are you on mate?
---
Plus bethesda don’t own Reddit so you’d be better asking in their site - not that it will do any good though 👍
---
I've got an app exactly the same as that on my phone(probably links to the same resource) Took ages to actually find the lead location I wanted near the central train station. Apparently there's another slightly SW but I couldn't find that before posting either
---
Did you have an atom skin on it? If so it would have been destroyed when dropped
---
Cripple his legs is the key, I use a tse handmade with tormentor and grenadier. Then take one for the team, and then unload on him.
---
To my knowledge no. You just need to pray to the RNG gods and sacrifice 3 new players on the fires for extra meat points. Then your chance will increase by 30% to some number still not relevant to normal gameplay.
---
LOL Yeah, its all about the display cases and fashion sense now! And I am on PC.
---
Yes they do, the devs often respond to feedback and suggestions on here
---
I thought the Responders fireman outfit came from a quest? It was given to me in a quest line and has since just been sitting in my stash. I thought everyone had it
---
Old news old news old news
---
Me too.  I just got some steaks out of the freezer.  There's gonna be a ribeye and a glass of bourbon on my dinner table tonight!
---
Chain of fools.
---
Yeah but they sell for so much more after you cook it and you get the free exp. Some people like myself just can’t pass up all that basically free exp and caps. Such a drag to have click and confirm one at a time.
---
All I ever buy is ammo. I’m sitting on 150k rounds of 5.56 because of these lovely people. 
---
*heart hands*
---
One of the best suggestions I’ve seen so far
---
I suspect you mean "why are there only 3 rare rewards" and not "why are rare rewards rare" as everyone seems to think. And if I'm correct, the answer is "minimal effort for long term engagement".
---
Tell me about it. I run lucky hole mine for lead ore and then spend about 5 mins smelting it all so I can put it in the scrap box and not take stash box space with the ores.
---
The three farms in the Toxic Valley (where the fertiliser aerosol machines are) has several types.
---
Thanks , So that’s why nothing gets fixed - the staff all on Reddit all day 😁, says me who’s posting this at work 😂
---
Wow. The Bethesda damage control employees sure are on a roll today. A true massive bug gets downvoted to get it off of New. Typical.
---
Gourds are good for Cranberry Relish...
---
Bingo. “It doesn’t work for me.” Like I said they can’t, won’t, and shouldn’t cater stuff to just you, or a very small minority of players. Therefor it’s a waste of your time and everyone’s time to even ask
---
There is a bash button? I assume this has something to do with the fabled block button?
---
All mmo I know have time based token limit.  
---
If a solution exists to regulate the flow, it has not been found yet.
---
&gt; Crater Core
---
This one bugs me because the gold press machine is inside Core.  I would love to be able to cash in treasury notes when I'm at Crater, but instead I always wait until I have to go to Foundation since their gold press is outside and doesn't require an otherwise pointless loading screen.
---
My tank/melee build has lots of ammo, gunpowder and lead. I use my son's account to move ammo to my gunslinger and heavy weapons builds. Also make ammo just to get the xp on my melee. Before transferring over.
---
at this point would it even matter lol..
---
Most of my friends have received it this go around, keep going. You’ll get it.  
---
(Donations don’t appear to have ANY affect)
---
The day I got mine I manned the spit prior to the event. Then I added a litttle bit to everything, including chally’s feed, wood, prime meat, veggies, chunks.   Maybe just a fluke.
---
I don't think we'll get it but we can all dream of dual wielding right? But I do think we'll get a buff.... eventually. If you haven't yet remember to use the tank killer perk! My number one wish is to move pistol damage perks to perception. If we had full access to a maxed out adrenaline perk or really any of the great perks on that tree it would change everything.
---
I was talking with someone about this last night about how pistols are compared to rifles when using vats. It a always been in this and all the fallout games to my knowledge if a weapon has a stock it has more accuracy in vats but consumes more ap. 
---
They also have a handful of other perks like faster movement with it out, you get a faster fire rate I believe, and on energy weapons I believe they get more ammo.
---
The only real buff I could personally say I see them needing and it can also be a buff to bows which I know some people consider a little weaker is swapping the Gunslinger perks with the Archer perks between Perception and Agility. This will mean you can set up both between full Gunslinger and Full gorrila meaning all your pistols get full damage not just single shot or full auto. Itd also mean taking a bow or cross bow is more tempting since after this you'd be able to go full Commando or full Long rifle or a mix of both and still have a boosted up bow.
---
I'm just going based off this buff though based one of my charcters. I have 15 strength 13 perception (legendary perk) 9 endurance, 3 charisma, 7 intelligence, 6 agility and 6 luck. I don't use handguns but I've looked at it before with this charcter and something like this would be a huge help to doing a pistol build for him. If I took the legendary agility perk of course cause I need my high strength and perception for my build and can't really move anything else.
---
Check out some angryturtle videos, he does a great job of explaining shotguns.  I've got the same as you and I had to learn to only make shots using VATS.   Don't mind though because the damage is enough to shot one most thing even after the last patch.
---
Gary! Gary? Gary.
---
Don’t use vats for heavy gunner. Just spray away. The laser has a pretty good reflex sight. 
---
And if you can, go ahead and prime the Gatling laser and craft ultracite cores with ammosmith, super duper and the legendary ammo perk card you’ll have more ammo than you know what to do with !
---
I’m with you on the fashion! I’ve spent months collecting rare outfits and spend all my time in power armour haha at least it’s something to chase!
---
Git Gud
---
No you don't
---
I was thinking that exact same thing. If they just kept the damage the same and upped the speed that perk would be much better.
---
I think it would be good. Just have them be like 10atoms or around there.
---
Right?!?? I constantly laugh at the posts addresses to Bethesda as if this is the official forum. Which I also read and don’t see these posts sublimated there.
---
Help yourself people and go right to the source!!
---
O.O I thought you could only have a single Ally placed at one time. Storing one Ally and building another shouldn't be possible as it will think you have one built already. Did Bethesda goof again...?
---
Maybe. I think it would be a healthy change for the game community. They may also choose not to do it so that hacked weapons don’t infiltrate a closed system game through the pc side.
---
This happens to me with my heavies. I have a lmg and gauss minigun. I’m at an event an use a fixer and lmg so have them ready. Swap to my lmg and it brings up my minigun or even worse no gun at all. Have to go into pipboy to select as the wheel won’t pull anything up🤦‍♀️
---
You may be thinking of the fire breathers outfit. is yours red and black?
---
lmao imagine everyone doing scorch beast queen or earl and the server crashes because someone wants to cook 1000 corn soup
---
Unless Microsoft throws resources at them to get it done, it's not happening anytime soon.
---

[Fallout 76 Interview (Steel Dawn, Next Gen, 2021 content, etc.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/izkmyk/fallout_76_interview_steel_dawn_next_gen_2021/)
---
I've sorta gotten used to my first shot always missing. I've got a bloodied vats 50% rifle and a quad vats 50% rifle and since the patches i've been really leaning into my quad rifle. Also picked up an anti armor 50%CD railway rifle today so been really having a ball in vats lately.
---
Have faith that it'll be fixed someday, try quick shotting your first vat shot. Also try partially charging between shots.
---
It is stupidly easy, you just need friends or a mic. If you don't have either slap on a melee and be the hero.
---
I’d love this. To be able to just boil all my dirty water in one go instead of spamming X for 5 minutes would be very appreciated
---
It is very frustrating lol i also do server hopping and fast travels keep costing me aloooot of caps...  Is there a specific timer/cooldown on every random encounters? I feel on just wating it out to spawn xD
---
They have community managers that read and collect feedback. But they are limited and have many different sites they have to read as well. 
---
The devs and such don’t post as much as the community managers.
---
The thing is. You have a better chance if them at least seeing something at their forums over here.
---
Now I want to equip a plastic fork and finish them off with that :)
---
probably like the bottom of a pop corn bag.
---
I used to keep a punch bowl full of Nukashine at my camp.  In 3 months i had 2 people take one.
---
I moved it to the front of my camp and put up a sign that said “Free Taxi”.  I went through 12 Nukashines in less than 2 weeks.
---
1st attempt:  Unplugged the cable from my computer.  Loaded 76 and got to the screen to put in my ID and password.    As soon as I plugged the cable back in the game crashed before I could hit enter.
---
2nd Attempt:  Did the same thing above but this time with a different cable (I know it works I took it from one of our other computers).  Same thing.  As soon as we plug it in it crashes before I can hit enter.
---
3rd Attempt:  Did the same thing with the same different cable but this time I unplubbed the cable from the router.  When I plugged it back it it auto crashes.
---
4nd attempt:  Unplugged power to the router.  Loaded 76.  Put my info in and then plugged the router back in. Once the net reconnected it crashes.
---
It's randomized.  See SirDouglasTheScholar's response above under nostalgix question.
---
I can't sell any for one cap (i don't sell .45, 5.56 or 5mm though, which I'm sure would sell), I've started listing everything i don't use for free, along with stims and rad meds and magazines that don't help me kill robots.
---
Also, people, stop asking if it's ok. 
---
The machine says free for anyone for a reason. I don't care if you're level 3790 just take them. Take them all. Empty the machine. I really don't care.
---
I don't actually know if I did. I may have actually.
---
Hell to the no. Get rid of the hacks &amp; glitched weapons first.
---
Happens if Tesla Rifles cause alot of lag. Happens most often with increased ammo sized ones. Legit or bug doesn't matter.
---
My toon currently looks like she was working through some serious life issues and came out the other end with questionable fashion choices....King Grognak Outfit, Plague Doctor Mask, Mr. Fuzzy Backpack, jetpack and Devil Horns. How things in the Gary Larson Wasteland say "Don't Touch!"
---
Oh, you're right. I didn't realize there was more than one. Sorry!
---
Not to get off topic, but I feel like melee needs some tweaking when it comes to the actual combat mechanics, as right now I would describe it as what you use when you don't want to use a bullet, not because you actually want to play like that.
---
Must be nice
---
This, back when the game released PvP was way more common but not all the time. Now I half to beg people to kill me for my bounty.
---
No need to apologise haha just seeing if you had something really rare 
---
The responder one (really rare) is blue and white but looks the exact same as the one you have
---
Says every sub lvl 50 player.....
---
And now I am sad!!!! :(
---
Not really, no. The few people who don’t have legacies won’t be extorted for one of about 100 sitting in the top traders’ stash boxes gathering dust, but that’s about it.
---
This is precisely why I built my camp near a static honey location.  I can walk just a little outside my build radius and harvest the honey
---
It's...adequate. On a 2h melee spec it'd be better, but I carried one on my commando for ammo-conservation purposes until I made another Lucky Hole run. I might build one and mod it to elemental damage at some point, just for lols, but there are other things my bullion is going for ATM...
---
Impressive work, keep it going.
---
Gotta say I feel like the pistols took a big hit. Maybe its because I dont have that guy all decked out with my best armor and legendary perks but non-theless they sure do feel a lot weaker. I still need to try the semi auto pistols maybe thats where the magic is now.
---
40 agility for the win lol
---
bad
---
No next gen update planned. 
---
Well there goes me following this game since BETA.
---
Unnecessary, unless you really need to max out legendary perks before level... 550 (or whatever).
---
* Fallout 76 is considered "stable" now internally, so they want to focus on making content.
---
fucking lol
---
Does anyone know how recently the FU (flamingo unit) camp spreadsheet has been updated?  Last time I looked, it didn't include a lot of the newer items.
---
as someone who has been melee since beta, I agree it could use some love. certain aspects of the game just absolutely suck such as the abundance of turrets in the nuke runs, I have no idea what to do with it to improve it but something would be nice. it's a real bummer one of the most attractive legendary perks for melee (the chance for AOE attacks) is restricted to VATS, which is just such an incredibly awkward experience.
---
Im having enormous difficulty replying to posts. Guess I got shadowbanned for speaking against the hivemind circlejerk. Same here though. Have to use the wheel every time now.
---
Can't you like.. melee through those?
---
This game still miss a lot of feature that were in previous chapter as well. I hope they will do an update with only QoL improvement soon.
---
I'm using it right now (only as a backup for daily ops, primary is a AAFFR prime plasma caster). Basically get heavy weapon, damage and energy ammo perks then VERY IMPORTANT luck of the draw and gunsmith, without both of them you'll spend most of the time at the repairbench, with them you'll need to repair  maybe once a week. Vats however is useless on this weapon.
---
Hard to see that making sense for gameplay—perk cards are character/level locked, while Atomic Shop purchases are not. Plus, with legendary perks now having us scrapping perk cards, that’s P2P.
---
Ten atoms? For 4 cards. For a penny? More like $1 each seems the right price. 
---
Not that things can’t change. But they said perks would never be sold for money.
---
Honestly, just increasing the resolution/render distance and frame rate is enough for me. Not sure why this isn’t a priority.
---
Excavator is accessible pretty early. Go to the rusty Pick, and at the front door you seen a floor sign for it. Click on it and the quest begins. It naturally has more carry weight and can still get calibrated shocks. And it gets 2 or 4x from ore harvesting.
---
Ty for all the info!
---
Meanwhile I will be eating an Aberdeen Angus sirloin...
---
Pretty sure Junkies works too. My JE50 combat shotty just about 1-2 shots every regular mob (in VATS) without a 15% block armor piece. And it doesn't seem to make a difference in more/less damage when I equip one.
---
I'm generally a stealth rifleman and I just put on power armor, grab that 50 cal from Becket and bash the robots in the face with the gun.  I don't often get to Elder that way, but I finish in under 10 minutes and that's good enough for me.
---
I have high INT like 13
---
It was in fact in misc. I went through it 3 times and kept skipping it SOMEHOW..
---
Pretty much this. Regardless of all other reasons, there’s still two functioning as intended economies on the console side and cross play between Xbox and PC would easily destroy one of those, giving Bethesda even less control around governing their game and the core loot gameplay loop.
---
Not just you but kinda....they are working on the balance issues in mid game so hang tight it might get better.
---
I used to think it was silly complaints too until I also learned that pain... When you're dumping legendaries left and right and have hundreds of treasury notes...
---
The modding system was only designed as level progression power bump mechanics, not variety unfortunately. There is a clear best in most mod cases, some with no drawbacks at all. 
---
I would like more variety in mods as well as legendary effects
---
10 Atoms is more like ten cents, not a penny.
---
Thanks for actually being of help(sincerely)instead of sucking your own dick and telling me how easy it was the 800 times you’ve killed it like others have let me know. 🙄funny for a game where 98% of the people are helpful in game to be assholes on other social media platforms 🤔I don’t get it.
---
You got this too?
---
If you weren't convinced F076 has no future past 2021, I think this seals it.
---
Yeah, I've "stuck by" Bethesda after they provided me with hundreds of hours of entertainment. THEY OWE ME SLIGHT GRAPHICAL IMPROVEMENTS!!!
---
Yeah. I may have to ditch the mutations until then.
---
Ouch. That does sound like it crashes as soon as the internet gets connected, a bit beyond my reach unfortunately. I would probably suggest to try another online game to see if the same occurs, and trying f76 on someone else's computer. Beyond that I'm at a loss, other that a fresh install of windows, which is a pain and having to make sure you don't lose any important files in the process. I tend to reinstall windows when a problem takes me longer to solve than the windows reinstall itself. Of course there's still no guarantee that it is going to work...
---
Pretty sure they recently mentioned making perk packs available for gold
---
I always stay with Sirloins and Bourbon... Just not in Appalachia
---
XB1, I'm going to get them the hard way. I'm at 390 tokens and dammit I'm going to get them somehow, lol.
---
Thanks for that, nobody has mentioned this to me yet. 
---
Damn I've been in there a few times too. How are these things not labelled? I came across a popup a couple days ago by turning around in a train station and had to take a second look. There's 3 quests on a noticeboard that I had no idea about til then.
---
The Overseer told me to watch your back.  #76Strong
---
I did that with the thatch rug. The icons are hard to see sometimes.
---
Good for you?
---
This and only this. Jeff Gardiner stayed this in a recent interview. Perk packs as well as other rewards from various content will be purchasable for gold.
---
Not really. Next-gen enhancements is not a priority at this point, they don’t even have access to next gen dev kits yet in Dallas according to Jeff due to the current situation. Hopefully it’ll come soon.
---

There's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. So it would work well for you
---
Note, 5 points of luck are from a legendary perk
---
Well atoms can be earned in game so it’s really not money their being sold for
---
Laugh out loud in Col. Gutsy
---
If you gave up that easily, then no.
---
Yeah good news is I just got the new computer in July so there is not a lot on it yet so that is an option that I am keeping in my back pocket for sure.
---
The only other games I have played is No Man's Sky (Which I don't know if that counts) and Skyrim (Which I know does not count).
---
This is the weigh
---
Good.  Stabalized and power user will be your best friends with that gun since it uses fusion cores as ammo.
---
Plant some antiseptic in your camp garden and go back every few hours , if you like this tip I have some magic beans for sale in my vendor 😁
---
Does it stack with other things, like whiskey or meats?
---
After level 50 wouldn't that just essentially be buying levels?
---
Hopefully we get some data mines soon , really curious what they got in store for us
---
Just agreeing with you that we are all entitled compensation from a game developer.
---
Todd reviews content "It just works"
---
It’s just rng, after this week I’m officially in the hole statistically
---
I get that its not easy. But i just want to mention it is possible to do it within elder time even if only 3 or maybe 2 players hold the uplink at a time while the other taking care of the mobs outside range. 
---
Dont get me wrong, this mode can indeed be very frustrating, and its entirely possible this is not working as intended. Im just saying the extra strategy it demanded in the runs i did made it the most fun ones i had.
---
That's more of a work around though and it requires you to place two walls where only one is needed, which eats into your budget.  They really just need a wall which can be wallpapered on both sides.
---
That sounds so cool !
---
I haven't been using melee since the update. But I dare to say you need every possible multiplier and buff and special point to focus on damage, so, yes, it should be necessary. 
---
Useless at Daily Ops, of course.
---
I was gonna say the same thing.  If you barely gave it a chance then gave up.  Don’t even bother with it now.  Only true fans appreciate the ups and downs
---
This would be a further step towards ‘pay-to-win’. 
---
Let’s do the math:
---
- 10 Atoms for 1 Perk Card Pack
---
- 10 Atoms for 4 Perk Cards
---
- 10 Atoms for 8 Perk Coins (PC)
---
You can spend $40 and get 6000 Atoms. 0.67¢ per Atom
---
- 10 Atoms = 6.7¢
---
- 6.7¢ = 8 PC
---
It takes 300 PC to fully rank up on Legendary Perk. 
---
- 0.8375¢ = 1 PC
---
- $2.51 = 300 PC
---
So for $15.08 you can max out all six of your chosen Legendary Perks. That’s not counting the free PC you get at level 50 either. 
---
How many players do you think would jump on that in an instant?  **$15 to max out your Legendary Perks?**
---
Someone, feel free to check my math. Let me know if I missed something.
---
F's in the Chat.
---
But yea, I recently did a Run in 6:50 Solo (invisible super Mutants in the burning mine) and got nothing. Aaaight, imma log out then xD
---
But 6 days straight? Damn.
---
Sorry my wording makes it sound like I only played it for a day. What I meant was that I played it from day one for about a month. I just got bored from the lack of variety but I’ve heard good things about the recent updates.
---
ESO is getting a Series X/PS5 update. I don't think they have a next-gen kit. I just want my death physics closer to Fallout 4.
---
I think it does with meats, not sure about whiskey.
---
Someone said it zaps
---
I got it and crafted one then went out to test it on the scorched by my camp.   Wasn't really impressed with it, my gauntlet did the same amount of damage and with a +40% to the swing rate took them down much faster.  Only thing that was good was there was some distance between me and the enemies.
---
I’m calling it right now. Enclave vs BOS tdm mode

Rad ant lager is my emergency fast travel kit of choice too. Coupled with a calibrated shocks excavator and you almost never have to worry
---
I currently have 3 flamers that I rotate between as they break.  Usually I end up with more ammo than I used in daily ops but I still buy up all the fuel I see!  Appalachia must burn!
---
I'd say I stick around for 90% of my matches until I die, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't take a picture and instantly leave the lobby, or place my camp and leave the match, a couple times last season. NW is only fun for me after a shot or 2, but hey for some reason they thought putting season challenges in them would be healthy.

Atoms are the only currency you can acquire by using real world money. This is why you **always** have to think it thorough carefully. 
---
At 10 Atoms for a Perk Card pack, that means someone can max out their six legendary perks for less than $15.
---
It's the most powerful 2h if you mod it

Decades ago, my father tried to learn to play Diablo(the first one,) and the inevitable "Too many darned buttons) cropped up and he quit. He stuck with his Mahjong games and such for years. Fast forward about five years later, he asks me "Can you show me how to play...that game again?"
---
Fast forward roughly two decades. He has now beaten all three Diablo games, plus expansions, Neverwinter Nights (His favorite,) has max level/tier characters in World of Warcraft, Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online as well as a slew of other games.
---
He's turning 74 this Dec.
---
Weren't they an Atomic Shop item at release that were negatively received / viewed as a pay-to-win mechanic, resulting in them being taken out of the marketplace?
---
It's not a good idea either way though. Being able to buy them would eliminate any means of progression in the game. With One Wasteland your level doesn't restrict you in any way other than through the perk system. Removing this would destroy the progression and remove any motivation to keep playing.
---
The legendary perks system was intended to and has lengthened the progression system for veteran players. This would destroy that as well.
---
TLDR; this completely goes against the progression system One Wasteland was meant to create and is not a great idea for the longevity of the game.
---
Really? Does a two shot weapon make you throw two things?
---
Wasnt there a handheld chainsaw too? I really wish i had it. Just destroying military robots using this rinky dink little fidget spinner chain.
---
1200 caps just of fog crawler meat and I wasn't even trying.
---
Make it so that we can indefinitely block, and parrying still requires the precise timing. Allow for perks that allow blocking to more efficiently block projectiles (it's an rpg, let me do bonkers stuff with my sword), maybe even reflect/deflect. Allow melee attacks to disarm attackers. There's a bunch of things they could do even in the creation engine that would let melee be more indepth than the basic implementation it is now.
---
I haven’t had any luck.
---
What the hell is turbofert anyhow? I keep selling them before I try anything with it

Still huge amounts of bugs have not been addressed. I can't recommend game in it's current state.
---
Nice job pulling this together.  Thank you!
---
The fire below the desk yao gui
---
Illuminati confirmed.
---
I can understand this. I'm quite new to the game, so I'm not up to speed with how bad it is on PC.
---
Of course it would. LFDH is the best thing on YouTube. Or maybe the second best, after the Lockpicking Lawyer.
---
If I wasn't just bashing them with the gauss minigun to farm ammo this would be a fun way, also a ripper should work just as well.
---
Lol epic
---
   Post One Wasteland, I am still 15 str and 13 per.  The difference is I'm usually melee first, rifles second.  
---
Either way, the TL;DR is Pre OL, the build could effectively utilize two different classes of weapons, and for my playstyle, One Wasteland did not change that.
---
Granted, that may be because  I was high enough level to get 5 legendary  slots the day OL dropped.  From unused level ups and card packs, I had enough coins to make each one of the 5 cards at least 2\*.  
---
  I used them to bump up the specials I shorted to have the high numbers in STR and PER.  Doing that let me add perks for dealing damage, damage reduction, and QoL.  
---
Those changes mitigate both the additional damage it takes to kill OL critters, and the increased damage they deal because they are generally higher level than pre-OL.
---
I love my bloodied flamer! Only one star but it competes with my bloodied gauss minigun even with just the standard nozzle. Vaporization nozzle makes it point blank range, but twice as powerful.
---
I just love the smell of napalm in the morning. It smells like....victory.
---
Clear each random encounter you come to (kill all the things or interact/participate) and it will return the encounter to the reset pool. Usually they take about 15 minutes to change, but clearing the encounter can speed that up significantly. 
---
I can do two circuits in about 30-40 minutes and have something different at each encounter. (I also run through a few other Encounters to look for outfit plan spawns). 
---
If caps are starting to take a hit, equip Travel Agent before your leave each encounter, just remember to re-equip the tame card. LOL You'll know if you don't!  If you have a survival tent, place it in the Bog and, if you can, leg it to the spots there. they really aren't that far apart and you have a chance to explore! 
---
If you have Fallout 1st, utilize Private Servers. I go Public, Private, Public etc...
---
I tame as a leisurely activity, but when I'm out for a specific pet I am ridiculously single minded. 
---
You WILL get it! :D
---
Best to sort by New so you actually get to see the posts before they get deleted.
---
Yeah no longer, sorry
---
Just RNG. No gimmicks to it.
---
Yeah it sounds like a tough one to get around. I hope you have more luck asking a friend to use their computer!
---
If you dont mind being low health, then you can use a full set of unyielding armour for +15str
---
You can also use a backpack, which you can fit with the chemist mod (90% reduced weight on chems) for loading up on those drugs/stims
---
Swap on a high capacity pack?
---
You can buy lunchboxes?
---
Cloaked I have the most trouble with since i rely heavily on vats. Resilient is second for me in terms of difficulty but I just throw on a vampires deathclaw gauntlet and do my best. Volatile is my favorite, its the easiest to farm.
---
Edit: I think where you're doing the op plays a role too. Resilient enemies in the burrows was far easier for me then in the galleria.
---
I still think that if you gave up on it that soon, then it's probably not the game for you, even with all the new stuff.
---
Its been a long time. Maybe join a data mining discord. I'm sure they would be able to pull some data of the missing items.
---
Tattered Field Jacket. Incredibly low drop rate and only appears as a reward from a handful of Mire-based dailies and events.
---
Item bank is one of the main request from the player base. But no words from Beth.
---
Ammo is the easiest way to convert currency past 30k caps. There are exceptions, such as 2mm ammo, but yea 1c per should be the standard.
---
I personally will not buy the basic ammos for more that 1c, and if you try to price gouge me on them I will not buy anything from you.
---
God No
---
Lmao so crazy
---
I think the game is stable. FO76 is more stable than Skyrim and fo4 imo.
---
I was lucky enough yesterday to fall into a team that we just kinda evolved into our respective roles without communicating it. 2 were shredding with their guns while me and another plowed in berserker style with an ax and gauntlet finishing off the job. 6 minutes and 50 seconds later we are wading in a pool of dead robot steel......OHHH, BUT the CARNAGE...!!
---
I’d imagine we get a coffin bed with the Halloween event
---
As in fails?
---
Guaranteed
---
Happened to me on xbox with Earle yesterday
---
I mostly wear Chinese Stealth Armor which really lowers my carry weight.  So I'm always wear a high capacity pack to help out.
---
They need a next gen game engine not this very old busted crap !
---
Thanks, I'll see if I have to double check some mods. 
---
(The prime/hardened receivers do +25% damage and those small changes are most likely due display rounding.)
---
Let's not forget the legendary modules to get the armor you are looking for.
---
The Camden park dailies weren’t worth the grind for me. I see them sometimes going for caps in vendors
---
Seadaddygaming. I saw his Ufo camp, outside of the rusty pick. Had 2 million something misc items so I went go check out it. In the Ufo he put the vendor bot behind a locked door. I wall breached through it and looked in the vendor an saw 2.3 million tokens. I took in game pics of it and his camp.
---
I am strugglling with melee. I have makeshift warrior and specced one handed damage melee cards.  
---
Ooops.
---
*Laughs in Vampire's Ricochet
---
Yeah, It was a bummer, the free bos handout is similar but not the same
---
I was thinking more along the line of pellets. Kind of like a deer or an antelope.
---
what are struggling with? melee is one of the best builds in the game
---
we decided to just ignore the wendigos and concentrate on earl. and had the right guns as it seemed.... ;)
---
This gets an upvote 😂 night downvote the original post - just to confirm the paranoia 😂
---
Use Super Duper for exponential gainz
---
Low health tanking is real.
---
I think you are actually correct.  It’s reset time here and the Daily Ops is still the previous one.  Should switch in an hour then I think.
---
Yea, but, bugs since Skyrim from release day of November 11, 2011
---
I used to be you. One day, I discovered psycho buff. 
---
Some time later, I went Unyielding, and have had no Carry weight problems since.  
---
An alternative is to use those stupid scrap kits. Or to switch to carry weight perks, fast-travel and switch back.
---
We tried that but we found that they get a bit overwhelming as they keep multiplying so our lower level people were trying to take care of the spawn while us higher level was focused on Earl
---
That’s still waaaaay under priced. I get people want all their legendary perks maxed out now. But the system was built so as to have long term goals and value.
---
Nearly every criticism is downvoted into deletion. Not paranoia when you can see it happening.
---
i know of 2 static spawns of the wedding ring.
---
One is on a dressed up dead rad roach in a house on the edge of the ash heap, the other is on a skeleton at an unmarked campsite in the southern savage divide. The roach ring is easier to find.
---
Since I run with marsupial and sometimes get in power armor that always has jetpack might take the bird bones just for fun, and the bonus agility is slightly beneficial too, I’m feeling a hit to damage since this update so I’m hesitant to give up a single point in strength plus I’m always having issues with carry weight. 
---
You run herd mentality at all times right? Does I was gonna add that in but the in game description says when allies are near does it just mean being in a team? Doesn’t matter if my teammate is across the map?
---
Of course we need to downvote the OP... is that even a question?
---
If you have a bug, why not open a ticket? And if people do post bugs here, they should include actual steps they performed so it can be reproduced.
---
Simply saying “game crashed and I lost my gear” is useless here. unless people can repeat the steps to reproduce it, it’s a useless topic of discussion.
---
It's almost as if they knew this would happen 😁
---
Surprisingly, the plasma grenade plan is ridiculously rare.
---
😂😂😂😂😂
---
I think it would be more or less the same differences between the .44 and the western. I find the best way to play pistols is to collect one of each and give yourself options situationally. Another heavy hitter with a different ammo wouldn’t be a bad thing in my opinion. But your idea is cool as well. I’d love to see and energy revolver of sorts with all the attributes you said. Or even just a .50 pistol
---
My melee build does it way more easily than my heavy and commando build, maybe you should tweak your build a bit.
---
I'd like dual pistols with some sort of super quick reload ammo / magazine belt, maybe replace backpack slot.
---
Oddly enough one of the other reasons aside from damage I haven't ever put much effort into pistols is the size / screen placement. Just something about it that feels a bit too large on the screen for me when running around with one.
---
Yes they are available for 100 gold bullion per. Check you faction bullion vendors.
---
*did someone say icicle lights*
---
Math checks out.
---
Buying perk cards is a huge middle finger to low to mid hundreds level players.
---
I got a few of my friends checking the specs to see if they can run it.  Most of friends to play a lot of PC games so they really don't have computers that will run it.  Waiting for a few folks to get off work and check.
---
May just have to unplug mine and go over and try.
---
No. Not a good idea at all.
---
All hail to bethesda and the fallout franchise. We pledge our lives to thee, may we have another day where our experience is bug free and the RNG smiles upon me. Oh praise to our glorious programmers for they ar........&lt;disconnected from server&gt;
---
 What bugs are you referring to?
---
The math at 10 Atoms/Perk Card Pack means for less than $15 you can get six Legendary Perks maxed. 
---
There’s no good price point for Perk Card Packs using Atoms. It would either be cheap to max out the Legendary Perks, which would ruin the whole progression purpose, or so expensive that it would just be for ‘whales’ to use.
---
No
---
I have found lots of cherry and quantum in the power plants while doing the repair events.
---
I dunno, energy weapons in general in this game are kind of a mess and i dont understand why.
---
They do less damage, they have significantly less durability and less ways to mitigate that. they require more perk card investment to modify and craft.
---
When i saw this weeks "repair 15 weapons" challenge. I pulled out my 2shot plasma gun and used it for farming. I had to repair it so fast and so often. But i got my weekly done lol.
---
Agreed. It’s just a really bad idea. 
---
**Gold Bullion** for Perk Card Packs would be far more balanced.
---
Use full charge from strength with power user, idk if it's bugged or not but with those two my core literally does not drop unless I get hit by a cryo floater, I could only operate on a single core if I wanted to but I use a laser gatling lol.
---
&gt; The entire year is planned out. 
---
Well then...give us the roadmap then? Or is text chat at least planned now?
---
If you use carnivore you get double the carry weight from meat.
---
Any good ant spots? Can't seem to find any outside of Teatime event.
---
Survival being toned down? So I took 250 coins worth of Survival Shortcut for what exactly?
---
It’s because we’re all optimist hippy glass half full people - , spread the love 💕💕💕💕( sorry no wacky backy , cheech and Chong , reefer , smoking a big old fat one emoji )
---
Shut up and take my atoms
---
yea but the mods for the 44 and western are dogshit
---
No spear mods sadly. But it does have unique poke attacks. The pitchfork is the only other weapon that has these attack animations, so you might like that. It has a few mods. Barbed burning is the best.
---
I levelled melee, and got all the one handed damage plus cards. It seems to me that the best melee weapons are either two handed, or unarmed weapons. Only one perk card exists for unarmed damage then the rest can be spent in incisor and martial artist.   
---
Also standing next to something that staggers, or waiting for a scorch beast to land is a problem for me.
---
Do you have an example?
---
It’s deep state I tell you !!!!!
---
I'm an idiot, you wrote "hopping" and I read "hoping". Makes sense now, yeah that's shitty
---
Condition for both weapons and armor 
---
Increase the amount of Durability 
---
And Decrease the rate of which it breaks
---
Not just the vendor bots, but any vendor such as Duchess all work on the same 1400 daily cap limit.
---
Not really. There is the power station north of Watoga that occasionally has a Deathclaw fighting ants, but I'm not sure if that's still ants or other bugs since the last update.
---
I have rank 3 and never seen it activate once. Died maybe 20 times since I upgraded it and not once has it proc'd. I use

Hey berserker’s is a lot of fun for a change of pace. I have a Berserker character and it can be very strong if you commit to zero armor. I wouldn’t be opposed to a buff though. It’s way higher risk than bloodied or junkie’s so it’s damage boost should reflect that.
---
I find it hardly matters. I have a 2 shot gauss, and my main pistol is a 2 shot explosive western. Damage is about a difference of 7. The rate of fire for the gauss is just so off putting
---
First they said no perks would ever be sold they would only be earned in game. Let’s hope they stick to that.
---
15 to max out 6 legendary perks would be terrible for the game. Because they are powerful and a maxed legendary perk should earned, not bought the moment you hit 50. 
---
I mean they already are giving 13 perk packs this season.
---
Leveling up is way easier now as well. 
---
Just go play the game for fun and you’ll be amazed at how fast it goes.
---
There are thousands, Bethesda employee. Thousands...
---
Pull, enter VATS, wait half a second, release. 
---
It takes some time, but you can do some serious damage with a bow when you learn what the game expects you to do with it.
---
Um no
---
Oh it's fine against normal enemies.. check your damage against the SBQ and Earle and let me know what you think.  Then run through the daily ops against the resilient robots.  I went from 4k to over 60k when buffed to under 400 with the same buffs against the SBQ.. Was that overpowered?  Perhaps, but that was just taking advantage of what was available after a ton of research and prep work.
---
I'm doing the commander Daguerre quest line.  I put upwards of 20 shots from my Somerset .44 into mirelurk king in the flooded train yard and barely moved the needle on him.
---
I hope they fix this. I would love to see PA team mates charging through enemies in ops.
---
Nothing in the atom store that gives a competitive advantage otherwise everything falls apart
---
There is a definite lag to it, but it's also the fact that you can get staggered out of switching weapons, and when you come out of it, it's a crap shoot what weapon you'll actually be holding.  Wrong one?  Sorry, you gotta start the process over again.
---
This is fundamentally what makes Resilient frustrating.  The game wants us to perform a specific task, we perform that task, but the game cannot reliably translate that into the correct end result.
---
I know this is late but if you use the legendary Special perks on other specials, deduct from them what you added in legendaries , then boost charisma the traditional way
---
Wow! Hopefully I'll get this good in Fallout! 😂
---
i guess not, but instigating/bloodied/junkies do effect your grenades and throwables
---
i tested it and its not just a visual effect either
---
also if you have a vampires weapon equipped, your throwables will heal you

I feel like it's bugged. I'm 0 for 20 at Rank 3.
---
Maybe this is a weird question but, why is it worth so much? Just the rarity or is it more useful than I realize?
---
Bringing your computer could be a good one to try. I think at this stage it's more about troubleshooting / writing off possibilities. If you bring your computer at a friend's house and it works, then you know the issue isn't the computer but maybe the router etc... Good luck, I hope you can narrow it down and eventually figure it out!
---
Probably not possible given the jerry rigged netcode duct taped onto an aged engine

I agree that a lot of the tiny changes captured in the middle tables are probably due to rounding. I know you pull straight from the game files so let me know if you see anything that drastically stands out against my findings. I’d be happy to collaborate or help any way I can.

I started a bit late, but I think I'll get there... I turned 60 last month. ❤

You're not fooling anyone, Bethesda employee.

The fast travel bug has been addressed a hundred times over.  How many more fucking posts do we need about a known, documented bug?  Maybe instead of posting on the subreddit, that HOPEFULLY might get looked at by community managers as they handle all the other social media sites, people just open a ticket every time it happens so that by the sheer volume of tickets it puts them in a spot to want to fix it.
---
But yeah, let’s just repost the same fucking thing here over and over again, heaven forbid people do things like the use Search option to see if it’s already been addressed or anything like that

Always like a Peppi!  Do you farm gulpers and milk?  Any suggestions?
---
I really don’t see why some people care so much about this. As long as the game is continued to be supported, who cares. Game looks fine IMO.
---
Sometimes if you are mass dropping things and speed clicking it will grab from other parts of your inventory (this is sadly true for scrapping too, but that’s not a factor here)
---
Thanks for trying.  I appreciate it.  Maybe support will get back to me at some point.  They were helping and then they went silent going on 52 hours now.
---
software can do whatever is needed as long as the time is put in to get it there. the idea that fallout 76 can't have x because of the engine is a sham people need to stop believing.
---

---
This sub is monitored by fo76 cms
---
Too many stacking low health perks, need to change how those interact in order to create a healthier meta.
---
These Daily Ops are designed to challenge ALL builds from different angles. The Resilient one is a bit more difficult for ranged builds. Probably easier for melee. 
---
But... imagine this... what if... hear me out now... what if we teamed up ranged AND melee people working through it in a team! AMAZING!
---
Added to the long list of things i guess :(
---
I used to display good rolls with whatever their abbreviation would be in small letters to let people know what I have for trade instead of just the scrip legendaries I have in my vendor for caps.
---
Now I only display rifles/shotguns that I have cool skins for. I checked people's vendors for 3* weapons for the 90% reduced weight stat so my displayed weapons don't eat up so much stash space. Currently displaying a handmade with the blood eagle skin, ghillie hunting rifle, responders pump shotgun and a slug buster. Still hoping for a skin for the plasma rifle and the only one that isn't 90% reduced weight is the handmade.
---
So you're asking me, on a post I made for a camp build, about seadaddy's in game inventory, because I watched a video of his on Youtube? Gotcha
---
Always remember to rename your gear thst you want to keep and always put a Z at the start aka "ZZunyielding left arm". Thst way all your armour and weapons will go at the bottom of your invent, it helps me alot when I'm dropping or scrapping (My bad if you already do this )
---
If it actually did that with Gary, that would be funny as hell.
---
red asylum outfit isn't even close to rare anymore. they've been duped by the thousand. Anything that was originally valuable due to rarity has lost its rarity a long time ago. The real rarities now are obscure items
---
True but most of the reports here are random cases with no real bug behind, it's just natural now to scream bug. Most the times it's just the guu that scrapped or dropped his gun...
---
There's always the Carnivore option, I guess...
---
What level is that somerset? That’s an entry level gun. Have you been upgrading gunslinger perks? Tank killer?

Compared to every other Fallout game has linear progression of time when you fast travel or wait in place, actual time of day. 
---
Until I see some seasons, I have no reason to believe time isn’t standing still with inexplicable leaps forward in years in game.
---
&gt; Fallout 76 is considered "stable" now internally, so they want to focus on making content.
---
What a slap in the face to this playerbase. We literally have bugs from Fallout 4 in the game. People are running rampart with modded/glitched items.
---
I can be bloody and tanky. You need to play defensively, but it is a possibility due to how low health perks and mutations work together. 
---
My main is an Unyielding Tank. Over 600 DR 500 ER 400 RR plus mitigating perks plus vampire weapons.
---
I hate to sound like a jerk but I feel like 90% of “bug” posts are either the player not understanding what’s happening in the game (stealth not working in daily ops, not understanding that one wasteland is now a thing etc) or are repeats of another post made sometimes minutes before, sometimes even with workarounds already written in them (eg the annoying SCORE pop up which has had the same workaround written in each post for it). 
---
The less duplicate and unhelpful bug reports are made, the easier it would be for Bethesda to find the good ones (as mentioned in another comment- including reproduction steps etc)
---
There are absolutely definitely real bugs that need to be fixed, but they need to be reported sensibly. Filling up “new” with repeats doesn’t solve it quicker.
---
When I get ‘bogged’ down on one character, I switch over to another. 
---
On a related note, I think it’s *possible* to max out one LP at level 50. 
---
With 13 Perk Card Packs available in each season, that’s 208 Perk Coins. 50 more from hitting level 50. Leaving 42 more to get the 300 you need. That’s 21 perk cards to scrap, and at level 50 that’s available. I have an alt that just recently hit 50 and scrapped about 30 cards. Granted I had the build planned out so I knew what cards I didn’t need day-to-day and which utility cards to hold on to.
---
Legacies are top shit round here. On PC, I feel desperately sorry for y’all, dealing with that shit.

It's mind boggling that there is not a safe and easy way to trade with complete strangers in a 2020 MORPG game without the assistance of a third party.  Think about all the other MORPG games with P2P trading that got it right before this for years and years and look at what we have.
---
Armor penetration seems to matter so much more now, so that could be part of why they feel weaker. Recently I found myself gravitating to Anti Armor weapons, perforating mags, and put an armor piercing receiver on my SMG despite it doing slightly less damage than hardened. Seems to make a difference since everything is so tanky.
---
Have you tried tank killer with pistols now that it supposedly works with them? I wonder if it makes a noticeable difference.
---
They are a bit irritating - I usually just go over there when all three of them are active and do them all at once.
---
 I gave all of my tokens to one of my characters, and after doing practically everything else in the game, I thought I'd try to do this thing too. I saw someone had over 1000 Fuzzy tokens in their vendor yesterday for 30000 caps for some reason.
---
Still ants.
---
So to prove your point of posts about bugs being downvoted and deleted you sent me a thread listing known bugs that is not deleted?
---
u/Ladydevann think that’s enough information to get this bug fixed?
---
Internal development roadmaps are always subject to change at any point. They’ll probably share the roadmap Spring 2021. You can except mods to be a part of that.
---
Didn't delete my post, dipshit. Bethesda damage control employee, you're not fooling anyone.
---
My post should have been more specific.  It works fine against most normal enemies.. I was referring to damage to the SBQ and Earle.  Those of us running unarmed melee went from 4k to over 60k when buffed to under 400 with the same buffs against the SBQ.. Was that overpowered? Perhaps, but that was just taking advantage of what was available after a ton of research and prep work.

This is Reddit, no one here cares about your bugs because this isn’t the place to whine about it, Reddit isn’t responsible for debugging and fixing anyone’s game. Go whine to directly to Bethesda, notice how many people want dog meat on here and yet still no answer from Bethesda? Yeah it’s because this subreddit isn’t the one stop shop for fixing your fo76 experience, Bethesda isn’t listening here, this is a place to share what’s liked about the game and maybe find new people to play with.  Also, this is by design a place for “fanboys” to congregate you fucking turd we KNOW the game has bugs, we don’t care that you lost a weapon or progress because there isn’t a damn thing WE can do about it.  So yeah plenty will downvote posts about bugs or people whining, I do it all the time and will continue to do so, stay relevant and you’d avoid this situation. Even now this post isn’t about the game so much as it is about you getting upset because how people on this subreddit respond to people like you, take your downvote and hit up the actual Bethesda forums or costumer support.
---
And you think you can trust people still....
---
&gt;My post should have been more specific.  It works fine against most normal enemies.. I was referring to damage to the SBQ and Earle.  Those of us running unarmed melee went from 4k to over 60k when buffed to under 400 with the same buffs against the SBQ.. Was that overpowered? Perhaps, but that was just taking advantage of what was available after a ton of research and prep work.
---
That’s weird. You should send in a ticket to beth.
---
It seems to be a bug. If you check with the capacitors that boost fire rate, auto ones aren't boosted. They seem to be hard stuck to 75. The only exception is that a ffr auto laser does actually go from 75 to 93
---
My pleasure.
---
This isn't the appropriate place to file bug report. Nothing will be done about it.
---
Go here: https://help.bethesda.net/app/home file a bug report so that somebody can actually do something about it. 
---
Also stop being paranoid about voting, people are tired of whinging about software problems. We already know.
---
Oh yeah, anyone who disagrees with you must be a shill.  
---
Sounds like you’re just another pissant who is trying to stir up shit because they got banned for duping weapons, isn’t that right weapon duper?  
---
Or is throwing accusations at people not the right thing to do?  
---
Maybe you should go tell my “employer” how horrible I am and get me fired, good luck with that.
---
I have a dozen stock laser rifles on the wall and I pretend they’re legacies! We can’t have that!
---
I quite like the idea of having exclusive items because I was there at the time..
---
maybe if they never came back and remained exclusive it would motivate new players to not miss out when newer exclusive items are released..
---
I'll look up the source when I am back at you computer but, yes, it is known by the dev team. It involves a bigger rework of the VATs system then just a quick fix.
---
A dumb question probably, but were you using ammo or spinning an empty shredder gun?
---
Yea, free placement of junk would make up for the decorative selection the game currently lacks (big time). 
---
I'd also say adding Place Anywhere functionality (in terms of being able to nudge items) would be amazing to along with free placement. If they could get those two things into the update as well I'd be in heaven.
---
I think a good start would be Faction public teams with their own daily op missions and lore friendly buffs related to each faction.
---
It would be a great way of finding like minded players.
---
I know that but it's so much stronger if you use it bloodied. If you tried it out yourself even for once... you wouldn't be commenting this
---
I'd like to know as well.   My post should have been more specific. It works fine against most normal enemies.. I was referring to damage to the SBQ and Earle. Those of us running unarmed melee went from 4k to over 60k when buffed to under 400 with the same buffs against the SBQ.. Was that overpowered? Perhaps, but that was just taking advantage of what was available after a ton of research and prep work.
---
The reason they don't sell well is because the presents were duped out of control, hell even on console i remember me and like 8 other random people chilling one the same server at murms with about 5k large presents each farming legendarys, some of the most fun I've had in this game ever (get rid of the stupid fucking script daily limit)
---
Looks like I will be migrating to the PS5...
---
Pitchfork 😂😂😂. Would love to shake the hand of the crazy bar steward who turns up to fight earl like that . There’s a sean Connery untouchables quote begging to be put in here about knifes and gunfights
---
How does that prove the OPs point, since the posts are clearly still there.  Nothing has been deleted, on the contrary, since they seem to have been communicated, what’s the point in keeping more posts repeating the same thing?
---
change, not fix.
---
I’ve already suggested this a while back as a throwing weapon. But a jar full of bees.
---
Bee hive would be a good way of making them
---
They kind of already did that with the last update
---
Maybe in the future...with 22, they finally allowed Combat Rifle skins to cover the Fixer...
---
Finally I can get rid of my cards for food and water. Fireproof and Action Boy here I come!
---
Of all things to view as problematic, how is the WANTED system one of them? It's utterly irrelevant 99.99% of the time, I legit see like 1 player become WANTED per 25 hours played. The WANTED system doesn't improve or detract from the gameplay in any meaningful way, it's just there.
---
they also said storage couldn't be increased, then charged us $13 a month to store unlimited crafting mats. they also said mod support and private servers would be available. and pete hines also said the in game shop would be cosmetic only.
---
Someone is saltyyyyyy
---
Stop making excuses for a multi billion dollar corporation. We get it, you're ok with mediocrity. Workarounds should not be a thing. They should have tested the fucking game. SCORE flashing on screen for several minutes at a time would have immediately been noticed if they ever tested anything.
---
That doesn’t mean that melee isn’t viable though.  I mean, no on in their right mind should have thought that damage numbers that high were intentionally.  The only advantage some other weapons have now is the magic weapon thing, and I would imagine that will hopefully get fixed too.
---
I like wheat diets more, the extra disease resistance is more helpful than a slight AP bump.
---
I used to run those two. Furious for bosses, executioners for mobs. Up to you. This damage calculator is still being updated, but it's still a great tool:
---
[https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
I just let my teammates hit them with ranged weapons while I run in and punch them to death
---
But those cleavers are considered "explosives" in the vending machine lol
---
I interchange on melee character quite regularly from all three, yes two handed does more damage etc but... I quite often run around with a fss furious Bowie knife (I thought it was going to be bad) gave it a run and it's actually good, I'd advise getting thorn armour its buff is amazing
---
Here, here on this subreddit. Nice try though.
---
Me and another fairly high level ended up in there on our own , he was in power armour and kept smashing him with his all rise whilst I just poured in thousands of ammo to his big fat head from my bloodied fixer , it broke quite a few times but it’s just a case of getting as much damage per second as possible , tenderiser perk helps
---
That’s what I’m hitting with my build as well - Bloodied Sheepsquatch Staff with bonus power attack damage.  Not a full bloodied build (I’m in PA for the extra survivability), but that’s fine.
---
If you think that 60K damage was “fine” I’d like some of what you were smoking.
---
Yeah and they should add more perk cards that boost berserkers survivability because compared to the survivability you get from bloodied and damage its nothing.
---
Do as many Daily Quests and Ops as possible. Most of mine come from these and Events.
---
Yea the carry wight is a constant struggle for sure, thats why i love high STR builds.  
---
I am officially now running Herd at all times and with a public group solo it still works. It also doesn't matter if the teammate is across the map. Although if they patch or change how it works it will be a large detriment when not on a team.
---
High intelligence, XP boosting foods, lunch boxes, well rested, inspirational perk if grouped.  
---
Farm areas with super mutants.
---
All the perks that add dr/er/rr need to be converted to percentages or straight reduction. Using four perk points for 40 energy resistance is nowhere near worth it by the time you reach higher levels. This goes double for the things like dodger, junk shield, etc that have additional restrictions on them. I see their utility, but they become obsolete pretty much by the time you get them. Since resistances have diminishing marginal utility in this game, having a percent boost (higher bonus the more you already have) would still be useful without being broken. It would give you a legitimate choice for min-max tanking. Now that resilient daily ops are a thing, there is an actual reason to do that, too
---
You guys ever just forget that ammo has weight? Cause I sure as hell do. Lol running around with 10 missiles in my pocket is not the the brightest idea
---
I have not tried Tank Killer, thanks I'll give that a shot. I knew AA was becoming more important. Guess I never thought to look at other perks the arent supposed to be associated. Pistols were pretty OP before this, I was shocked first time I loaded up and tried it with the new system. Commando, heavy guns, and even shotguns are largely unaffected in "feel" IMO. I'll check out Tank Killer tonight and see if thats the key to getting pistols back.
---
As much it would be nice I don't think it will ever happen. I think it has to do more with server/game engine limitations more then anything. In fallout 4 having a bugged out unlimited budget that made the game extremely unstable. Note this would start occurring when they started to go above the max budget of that said location. Now if you apply that issue to a internet based game with 20-24 people on top of it, it would be a nightmare. I think the instance camps is an answer to that.
---
Nice try what? I asked for an example on this sub and you haven’t provided it unless I missed something? Are you just trolling? No need to be rude..
---
Can you provide an example of a post talking about bugs that delete your gear that’s being downvoted off the page?
---
You da real mvp, u/yankee_chef_nen
---
Pathetic.
---
I'd make Awareness highlight corpses and the Science perks both increase damage and durability of energy weapons(plus put Gauss weapons into ballistic only category). Maybe give Mysterious Stranger high chances of knocking down enemies.
---
Honestly it feels like it now, can't speak for consoles. Haven't needed to worry about people randomly deleting all your items for over, what is it, 9 months now?
---
Set that sort by weight. I notice pretty quick if they’re at the top of the list.
---
Fast. Travel. Bug. Moron. They don't listen or act in their own official forum. Shill.
---
Nah they're a nice challenge which is the point of the ops.
---
yeah i definitely agree with you 👍🏼
---
"Not drinking water or food will not grant you any negative effects."
---
That's not toning down the survival system, that's straight-up removing it from the game. Food and water giving buffs has nothing to do with survival, that's exactly how a lot of normal RPGs work (DoS, WoW, etc.)
---
Can't say I'm happy about that. The ideal change would have been actually making the survival system more challenging, because it's virtually pointless after level 15-20 in the current game, and then having either an option to turn it off or a different server/mode type that doesn't have survival. That way folks who aren't into it can play 76 as an RPG, and those who are can get a 'true' survival experience. 
---
"Building will be focused on heavily next year."
---
This is great to hear, hopefully it's gonna be developed for the community and not to promote more MTX. :P   
---
Everything else sounds good.
---
I have the anti-armor I think it is 50 Cal, the final word and all of the big guns perks and seem like it was just not even doing nothing, it was knocking him down so slowly that you could barely tell visibly that it was moving. We’re gonna have to try other weapons
---
I haven't seen a better pistol yet.  Yeah maxed gunslinger I don't think I have tank killer yet?  I finished NV with Benny's pistol FO4 with Kellogg's pistol and I was cruising along FO76 with a pistol until this last patch lol.
---
Haven't the textures been fixed already, noticed it looked better before this previous patch
---
Ops reset at 10am pst for me so another 30 minutes.
---
Again.., what level is the pistol? I’m guessing level 5-10. That’s not going to be good enough to bring you through the game.
---
Use gear appropriate to your level.
---
Also pistols are pretty underpowered. Do you have expert gunslinger maxes also?
---
Tank killer is available starting at lvl 30
---
The Pistol weight reduction perk, Packin' Light, which I can't imagine anyone actually using, could be useful if it *also* included a buff to reload speed, like Ground Pounder does for Rifles.
---
I'd merge Guerilla and Gunslinger into a single "Small Arms"/Gunslinger class and, ideally, move it from Agility into Perception.  If it remains in Agility, I'd condense these damage perks into a single 3-rank card, like Iron Fist is for melee.  There aren't enough options to justify Guerilla as a distinct build, and it messes with cards like Modern Renegade whose odds (even after the re-balance) still favor Auto-Pistols.
---
Most of the Charisma perks are way too circumstantial to ever be that useful.
---
I'd also do a pass of two things:
---
* Every card that doesn't apply while in Power Armor needs to say that.  Some do.  Many don't.
---
* Get rid of vague language like "better/improved/superior/exceptional."  Show me the actual percentages.  How else am I supposed to assess if "better" is really worth the investment?
---
* If we're keeping base damage as the standard for the new damage algorithm (which I maintain is counterintuitive), the damage perk cards need to say they apply to "base damage," not simply "X% more damage."  Because the current phrasing is fundamentally inaccurate.
---
Sort of, but that's the problem with half measures.
---

---
I wish that was true for the forest scout mask.
---
I've been trying to get one to complete my cosplay, but despite offering more in trades than it's worth, everyone is holding out for legacy stuff that no one is willing to trade for it, so my cosplay goes unfulfilled.
---
My thinking, (or hope rather) is that we're going to be getting new maps in which these expeditions take place... maybe even a trip to Capital Wasteland?!
---
I have yet to experience such a high lag.
---
Anyways, I know my monsters and pay attention if they have a crown or not. Crowned lvl100 ones need 2-5 shots, so they get 5 in general, crownless lvl100 need 1-3, so they get 3.
---
Since I usually run around with xp-buffs, have ammo-factory and primed guns, delaying between each mob is just counter productive and not needed when bullets are cheap af to make.
---
That happened to me once, I swapped servers and it stopped doing that. It was annoying though.
---
&gt;no text chat
---
What the fuck?
---
Grilled radstag is great because you just have to kill radstags while you're out in the wastes. There are several that spawn in Flatwoods (like 6 or 7 at once) as well as the 4 at The Whitespring, not to mention the albino herd you can run into. I keep something like 50 on me at a time with whiskey and I'm going to miss them when I go herbivore for the ease of collecting brain fungus over scorchbeast brains.
---
I’m guessing there will be an event similar to fortifying atlas but for the enclave bunker. I’m hoping it’s not all of the whitespring. I’m also thinking that we will be able to own houses and the whitespring and use the camp mode inside them
---
A compromise that would probably alleviate the decay issue would be making both a colossal problem and daily ops missions reward advanced repair kits. Been saying this since patch 22 went live. Glad to see I'm not the only one who doesn't want to spend hours farming for materials necessary to repair gear. Another option would be to reduce the required materials to repair stuff.
---
I'm aware
---
Here's hoping they might be able to help 👍
---
Man I got so goddamned frustrated with the module grind for gauss weapons I couldn't bring myself to even turn on the game for about a month. I got a wild hair to play one weekend and hit a Yahtzee on a gauss mini roll and, my god, it was like an enormous weight was lifted from my shoulders. I was free to engage with the game in a way that was satisfying and fun again.
---
My main character is a PA heavy/melee/shotgunner, so i planned to do the SS armor grind with an alt. But I've postponed that indefinitely, I refuse. Fuck it, I've already got good armor.
---
...are you new here?
---
That is just a small percentage of why you would switch cards. What about when building, using power armor, different weapons, etc. 
---
To focus on just one thing you switch cards for, and what, 10% of the player base, is ridiculous, but fitting for this game. LoL.
---
Edit: and isn’t that the perk that opens any lock/computer, even if it is owned, thus putting a bounty on your head? Great perk LMAO.
---
Hahaha hey my fellow fallout oldie lovers. It's lonely out here huh?
---
Gaaaaaaaaarrrrryyyyy
---
Oh dang I didn't even know that existed I'll give it a look thanks!
---
Did it sound like Orange Julius from 2 Fast 2 Furious, right before Suki jumps the bridge?
---
Yeah there was whole periods of time I’m pouring it on and it doesn’t seem to move at all then just a little bit , but it gets there in the end, people moan about legacies , magic weapons etc but boy do I love it when someone opens up on earl with one - that’s thousands of rounds of ammo, a couple of repair kits and 15 minutes of playtime saved 👍👍👍
---
I run nukes at least twice a day (more during the weekend) with my group, and yes you only need to enter the code once a week.
---
The game gives you a message saying that you've already entered the correct code if you try and enter the keypad interface after you've already launched from that silo previously.
---
Thanks for your help
---
Like I said in the very first post, changing the ammo vending machine that's present at every single stations would let everyone make use of ammo points regardless if you own the ammo converter.
---
But yes, they need to fix the ammo converter interface
---
New to the subreddit, yes. New to the game, no. I’ve been playing since beta, but I’ve never seen this before.
---
He might not be hacking, bloodied builds can be OP. I'm bloodied melee amd I can 1 and 2 hit almost everything but bosses amd legendaries.
---
You need to accept your rewards and/or check the Scoreboard before loading in
---
Do you have Full Charge(perk card)?
---
Yea scrapping ammo would be great, though not until we have the ability to bulk scrap (which is also laughable that we still can't scrap  or craft more than one thing at a time)
---
Yeah, a menu toggle to 'hide armor' and 'hide backpack' would solve the problem nicely, and make a lot of players very very happy.
---
If you use armour the amount of vault steel goes down. But yes when crafted you are guaranteed a 3* piece
---
What system you on? ive been wanting to pet hunt and need a bud
---
Doing great work thanks!
---
No.
---
He may have misspoke and thought he was describing Lunchboxes, but Jeff Gardiner made it sound like Perk Card Packs might be coming to the Gold Bullion vendors, which would be a rather interesting addition and a healthy Gold sink.  I'd be all for that.
---
Yea, though that can only happen after Bethesda figures out the oh so difficult task of letting us scrap / craft more than one thing at a time.
---
Imagine scrapping 15k .38 bullets one at a time.
---
That is a very interesting question...  I’m now curious myself.
---
I still get a decent stream of buyers for 1c ammo sales on XB1. I've been super lazy lately though and just periodically dumping hundreds of rounds of ammo (all varieties) and plasma cores into the blue suitcase under the skeleton at Charleston Station.
---
Aaronholt Homestead. Top left corner of the map.
---
I think you mean just east of Aaronholt homestead, there’s a big field with a shed that sometimes spawns a power armor there

&gt;Atoms shouldnt exist
---
Multiplayer games generally need to continue to generate revenue, *after* the purchase of a copy, or else the servers wind up going offline, and then **nobody** can play anymore.
---
There are generally three ways for that revenue to be generated:
---
1. Monthly subscription fees;
---
2. Microtransactions;
---
3. A hybrid of both (1) and (2).
---
There is literally no path forward that would keep F76's servers active indefinitely, without one of those three being in place.
---
Fallout 76 went the route of #3 - a Hybrid setup, where the revenue is generated partly by microtransactions (Atoms), and partly by subscriptions (Fallout 1st).
---
...
---
WITHOUT those revenue sources, you'd get something more like Fallout 3 or 4: a handful of DLC for a year or two, and then ..... **nothing**, ever again.  Also, no multiplayer, because there wouldn't be money coming in to pay for the required servers.
---
Games that buck that trend are very few and very far between.  Offhand, I can only think of one that fits that bill right now - Diablo III - and even that, **originally** the plan was for a steady (albeit modest) revenue stream being generated via fees charged on the *Real Money Auction Hall*.
---
# IMPORTANT TO NOTE
---
There is not one single speck of actual content in Fallout 76 that is gated behind either Atoms, or the Fallout 1st subscription.  It is entirely possible, *and not even necessarily onerous*, to play through every bit of story content, to attempt and succeed at every Event, Quest, or other activity in the entire game, *without ever spending a dime on Atoms or a Subscription.*
---
Just the initial cost of purchasing the game.
---
The only things behind Atoms or a Subscription, are *convenience* and *cosmetics*.
---
And, to add to this ... you can earn a modest amount of Atoms **just by playing the game**.
---
I don't see the problem.. vets have the cookout so wired it's all I can do to turn in prime meats  before it's over..

by the time the 2 min counter ends the progress bar is 3/4 full.. lol
---
Pepperoni Rolls are a must.  They add 60 to your carry weight.  In Excavator PA I am running 500-525 lbs.  At upper end Buffout, Bufftats and Whiskey help.  Whiskey seems to stack with everything. Traveling Pharmacy is a big help if you have lots of chems and Scattershot if you carry several shotguns.
---
At least on the PS4, the deathclaw faschnat mask is worth a fortune. Almost worth a legacy
---
I don’t understand what changed with patch 22 that is different from before in regards to repair kits? I’ve never had an issue keeping myself supplied via the queen although I do agree that earl should drop similar amounts. I always looked at them as a high level endgame ok you’ve repaired your shit with mats enough times you’re good enough to grind the queen and forget all that
---
Please cite your source. Also cite how many of them are assigned to work on this game, and how many of them are assigned to work on bug fixes. 
---
Thanks!  I love seeing actual data sources, so those sources you have will be of great interest!
---
because it kills you faster

I just blindly tap enter on crispy squirrel bits while browsing this forum on my phone. Same with smelting all my ore,  pound enter while killing time on my phone. It's really annoying
---
The team I was on last night took turns running up and bashing the mob of bots pelting us, it worked out well and we got Elder first try.

Nearly every criticism is a weak ass player or something that's been posted 1000 times. Gotta filter out the worthless ones.

DPS would be the FFR. The explosive would have better hp regen.

September 2020. Bethesda are totally inept. Microsoft you was robbed.

What mask are you after?

would a TS grenade launcher build be viable against mobs atp
---
I was just 30 seconds too late and lost yesterday's Level up challenge :(
---
Yeah I'm not 100% sure Is there an ultrcite recover for .50 cal? 
---
Regardless don't feel like you are missing out. Hacking takes the fun out of the game. What level are you? What spec are you? Perhaps look at builds or try and find better weapons. It isn't always a fast process but I found it pretty rewarding having my build amd being able to smash mobs in the face. 
---
You can always utilize the discord servers for advice and builds as well.
---
They need this and need to name the budget points Flamingo Units
---
So for when a stroll to the eternal after just won't do huh?
---
Unfortunately I’m on PlayStation but thanks anyway!
---
I've had people yelling at me over my pistol takes so I'm going to try a different tack here. 
---
I totally feel your pain. Last year, I created a pistol medic character with the idea I'd use him in the Vault 94 raids. Well, I ended up hating the raids and hating the character BUT, by leaning really heavily into VATS, I could get by. Couldn't really bring the big enemies but for most things, I could kill them eventually.
---
I know a lot of people don't want to hear this but... going to a low health build solved pretty much all my problems. I wasn't even using bloodied weapons specifically, adrenal reaction and nerd rage were enough of a boost to kill most enemies. And I've played with this character since the adjustment and he still works. Relies exclusively on VATS headshots and crits but he works. But I bet a full health pistol build right now is like throwing rocks at scorchbeasts. 
---
I use .44s mostly, 10mm pistols and pipe weapons break so quickly. The .44 and western.

Hahaha i have those two melee mutations and ricochet. Legendaries tag ME

No. Just one I.    I’m Caperboi

As a new player, I’ve been doing this event and I have no idea what I’m doing, could someone give me a quick rundown to take advantage of this event? I’m level 23, and I just teleport there and kill stuff/play the drums lmao. I also try to participate in the primal cuts one but only if high level players are there since I’m low level, what am I suppose to do? Thanks!!!
---
This is my point tho.  The solution to the lagg, is to slow down.
---
exactly!
---
Yeah it was crazy. Like he just go swinging around his pitchfork all happy and shit. Def made me laugh, would’ve been better if we actually finished the event and didn’t lose it

Honestly w the Mirelurk Kings I’ve dumped half a fusion core into them from a Bloodied Gatling laser and still had issues taking them out. Furious Gatling doesn’t seem to do much either. And that’s w Tank Killer perks

I always wear my moms dress when playing
---
lol this is an issue?
---
The rarest junk is probably the clean Mr. Handy Fuel. It has no world spawns, and can only be looted at random. It is not scrap protected like the dirty one, so it can be accidentally scrapped.
---
The glasses from the cultist suicide random encounter may also be considered rare as there is no guaranteed spawn point.
---
Maybe, maybe not. Just depends on a lot of factors
---
&gt;Fallout 76 is considered "stable" now internally, so they want to focus on making content.

Yeah except for the stuff that's been broken since launch that they never fixed

It doesn’t take hours to farm for materials to repair.  I’m sitting on 75+ advanced repair kits.  Use gunsmith.  Use weapon smithing.  I can only see an issue with low levels, but I leveled a new character to 50 with update 22 without issue.
---
Yes. It's about Lazy and Inept Programming.
---
Agreed... or actually all of the above? 
---
Decay rates need a tweeking I think... not too much, but definitely a bit lower. I'm not a fan of having to repair my guns every other fight. 
---
And also... yes, it would be really good to see the advanced repair kits as a reward for at the very least any event that is triggered by a silo run. (nuke)
---
I've seen plenty of those, but there's been quite a few recent I've seen where they just stand around and low lvls struggle to get past the first bar. It's not all of them, bit I feel bad for those few.
---
&gt;  What about when building, using power armor, different weapons, etc.
---
Yes I need a perk loadout for crafting so I don't have to switch 15 cards
---
😂😂😂 Must have been a sight to behold - sorry you failed the event but you’ll never see that again
---
Sir I don't know who downvoted you, but you get ups from OP for humor and I hope that makes up for it!
---
I dont know why that option even exists. Make it like SS and level 50 only
---
Yes. You'll see a prompt for it
---
"I don't suppose anyone else has the same issue as me?"

Many people have the same issue.

None, I’m looking for an unyielding ap (?) forest scout left limb lol hoping for the good ole “treasure Fïnd”

Did not know this was a thing , thanks !

Falling faster is the penalty, damage reduction is the benefit.

Alcohol &amp; chems generally have a positive and negative in game.
---
 Unless Microsoft throws resources at them to get it done, it's not happening anytime soon.
---
You make a very valid point and I gotta agree completely with that!
---
I just tried adding you as a friend
---
damn ive never ever had this problem once, the game has provided a surplus if anything.
---
I visit each site i see on the map and do a once over and collect everything from everywhere and have so much stuff now as a lvl 79. 
---
im a hoarder in fo games and it serves me well, although it is a bit boring for most people and time consuming to sweep through each site picking up everything and killing everything no matter how slow it takes to kill them
---

I feel like a lot of the game mechanics in FO76 are just brutal. Sure, it's a survival game, but many of the arbitrary mechanics aren't for the sake of a survival game they're just arbitrarily difficult for the sake of being difficult, like the entirety of the Tadpole/Possum quests. They've locked a mechanic to allieviate one of the most stressful elements in the game(carry weight) behind a needlessly complex questline. I've acquired that backpack four times now, and completed all of the related quests only once. There's not really an explaination for Bethesda having done this, other than they are just wanting to be brutal to the people playing the game.  
---
All of the limits upon the gameplay, the stash limit, caps, bullion, scrip, etc - it's more brutalism, when you add to the fact that every single one of the daily quests or events rewards you useless weight where you're consistently overburdened if you just play the game, there's no explanation for it other than they've just created a brutalist world with arbitrary logic that isn't actually focused on a being a 'survival game' and instead it's just making things hard the simplest way that they can instead of being challenging. 
---
I would welcome missles, mini nukes, floater grenades, and heavy/sturdy combat armor being replaced with basic repair kits any day of the week. Anything that would reduce the amount of time I've got to go into my Pip-Boy to drop items or locate a workbench or stash box to unburden my character.
---
Yeah, its super handy,i use the workbench map a lot.
---

---
Try getting a melee weapon and the appropriate perks, they can be a godsend in the beginning for conserving ammo. It'll take you a little longer to make your end game build if you don't go melee, but it really helps in the beginning. 
---
They did announce on the last ITV that they are changing the scaling for the lower levels that also might help out. That comes Monday or Tuesday i believe.
---
I wish instead of removing the debuffs for hunger/thirst they'd just make the degrade time more reasonable
---
Nope.
---
Exactly. Even during last Meat Week I had to make sure I went straight from the drums to the cook area to turn in Prime Meat before I turn left to start cleaning up garbage piles and before I can even make the full circuit, about 1/3 the time the event completes. 
---
With so many people knowing what to do, the Meat Cook tends to end quickly.
---
I found it started doing this to me when logging in as my second character after my first, though it didn’t happen today so I haven’t been able to replicate it yet. Definitely annoying when opening the map!
---
Sick link, gonna give it a read! Thanks!
---
Gotcha, thanks! I already seem to have pretty good sustainability, so I guess I won't bother looking for explosive.
---
Now thats a care package
---
Bees are not to be thrown!!! Lol.
---
Or you mean the camp shelters which have been on the roadmap and have been specifically stated to have their own budgets so you can go crazy and do exactly what you are talking about?
---
Yeh cause that's already a thing. Soon to the pts infact.
---
Sorry if it is, having 2 kids gives me little time to stay up-to-date.
---
As someone who uses bloodied and full health builds and have used magic weapons on both.    They both melt just as quickly.
---
Thank you. All I saw was the fall speed increase.  I didn't even notice the +15 DMG resist.  Again, thank you and good luck out there.
---
PC player?
---
Best advice I can give apart from obviously weapons etc. The Center Square area im a bloodied build so can die easily if you hug the centre column and peek at him and just keep shooting and when he moves you just rotate round the centre cleaning up mobs as they come. When he moves you move. Hope this helps.
---
huh? I am just using the max amount of bullets needed, ignoring their level. That way there is no need to slow down.
---
I swap cards for camp/crafting vs being out and about, even with infiltrator perk loadouts is high on my want list
---
Well, relative to how it *was*...
---
On a high level, the bleeding has stopped.  They *can* focus more on making content than building out core systems like conversations or instancing.
---
Ya this is a glaring problem.  Combined with character locked bullion gear and cap limit the in game economy is tanked.  Sad to because vending / economy is a fun role play / end game activity if done right and helps other players get decent gear otherwise unobtainable.
---
Thanks for the info, very peculiar indeed.
---
From my experience:
---
Violet: 
---
toxic valley (make sure to include Wavy Willards for better odds on HRF), and be aware Chem benches are scarce) or 
---
Fissure prime (IIRC, Watogo high is the closes chem bench out of the zone, but you'll have to fight more critters to get to it)
---
Cobalt: Morgantown
---
The rest: WS.
---
Grenades that make planted crops grow instantly.
---
Excellent for people like me who do a lot of farming.
---
I think it makes sense for Bethesda to do it as far as server usage but the game is way too unstable and I think pc/console have two different build versions.
---
The most likely scenario is they allow ps4 and xbox to come together as their environments seem more stable. PC is a constant shit show with hackers dupers and the likes.
---
Edit: I'm on PC too and I know what the place is like
---
Only once, is this common?
---
cool thank you
---
This.
---
Same. It's about time we had a valid and reasonable response from a community member. Upvoted.
---
I once sprayed the drummers with gunfire as it seemed clear we wouldn't complete the event unless they helped. They didn't and it wasn't completed. They basically want others to get them rewards.
---
Sounds underwhelming for a live service game to me. No new zones, no next gen graphics upgrade, no real vision. But internally stable? C’mon.
---
Oh hell no i need my 60fps on ps5/xbox :(((
---
Play the drum (for a second then get off) to start the attacks at the beginning of the event, then defeat enemies in each waves, focus on the ones marked to get to the next wave. That's about it
---
The "prime meat" can be thrown in the cauldron at Grahm's meet week event near Vault 76 to progress the event and get legendary scrips (a currency that you'll want to save for when you reach max level), note that you can only throw the prime meat in the cauldron when the event itself is active.
---
The excess meat I'm talking about comes from looting the animals during the other events popping all around the map, selling them can get you a lot of money, especially when cooked, plus cooking stuff (and crafting in general) yields xp, but it's tedious due to having hundreds of pieces of meat that you have to cook individually (one craft is 2 key presses).
---
I've only seen it once. And it was just the other day. Glad I'm not crazy!
---
Honestly I would love to see cross play happen even between consoles.
---
The thing is, I'm kinda maxed out and there's nothing I can do to improve my build unless I cheat. And these hacked weapons are a huge upgrade for me
---
I have a much different experience with Uranium Fever, almost every time I run it it's with randos but everyone plays nice and gets along. The pricks are few and far between, and being high level and well-equipped myself, I take pains not to bogart the kill.
---
So the asshat who didn’t want posts removed removed his post... 👏

The worst part is the walk of shame back to your loot bag....

No need to thank, your welcome buddy.
---
I observe legendary etiquette in events, but I'm not going to worry about it out in the world. The only place that was ever necessary was Whitespring and that hasn't been a thing in ages.

LMAO! So true!!! I always feel stupid. 😔

I’m with yu on that but atleast they could reduce food and water loss rate I shouldn’t have eat a meal and drink a gallon of water every time I jog 20yards

There's a charisma card that maxed gives 3x buff to booz (party girl?). Pretty significant with whisky and carry weight
---
I've been so disappointed seeing so many people charging more than 1 cap for ammo.   
---
I keep mine at 1, and even 0 for ammo types typically used by new players.
---
I need to find you other 1 cap ammo sellers on XBox. I'm out of lead and getting low on 5.56 and .308. Need time one of these days to do a Lucky Hole Mine run.

There is a Prime Receiver for the 50cal.👍

Best change ever. That would make looting so much better.
---
This is great information thank you! I'll bring this up.
---
Very unfortunate to hear there’s no plans for any enhancements for the next-gen consoles. I guess for a GAAS it’s not exactly a big priority but I would love for the chance to play this game at 60FPS on console
---
Game has come a long way.  Definitely recommend giving it another try.

Im a casual player, I've tried

---
Wow thank you so much, could you tell me why other events to look for so I can get some of that meat to cook for caps/xp?
---
What build are you using though? I don't mean to sound rude, but maybe your build isn't that great? My bloodied melee is 10 levels lower than my PA gunner and out damages him by a lot, but I like playing my PA gunner just as much. 
---
If you think that getting a hold of a hacked weapon will make you happy then go for it I guess?  But if Bethesda ends up banning people for using that stuff, don't be upset if you get banned.
---
Devs are moving away from levels being a relevant measurement of game progression. Their ultimate goal is to have every piece of content available to every level of player.
---
The devs have also recognized that the mid levels are more difficult than they should be. The next hit patch will include tweaks to the mobs at those levels.
---
not really lol. the fixers are king still in pve in my opinion. I only carry a laser for pvp
---
My guess is they were AFK.  
---
At least AFK'ers are trying to help/make a contribution by turning spits and/or banging the drums, freeing others to do the remaining tasks.
---
its not poison
---
Thx for the info, I will try to do that :)
---
Yes you can use bash then to finish them off. 
---
But you can also use throwing weapons like the throwing knife, meat clever or tomahawk.
---
And another great tip is to use your vampire weapons 😁
---
Then you should be able to solo it in 7 min😄
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but if you go upstairs at the Overseers house to the display cabinet in the bedroom and shoot it or blow it up with a grenade you can get the Responders Helmet and Suit to fall out.  I was missing the helmet and this is how I got it.
---
Have the community managers even acknowledged that they are looking into this? It's sad that things like this don't recive immediate action when other less detrimental bugs do.
---
Try out a good JE gatling laser build and come back to me later. I’m doing BE handmade and laser because I prefer that playstyle for day to day stuff. A JE gat laser build would be for serious boss fights like soloing an SBQ or Earle.
---
I both agree and disagree with this post. 
---
Is the game unplayable at high levels? Absolutely not. I like that there is a challenge again. 
---
Do I feel like there is no longer a sense of progression. Yea. And that is my main complaint.
---
It’s a different outfit mate
---
Wasn't this posted like a month ago with very similar content? Someone hoping for some karma?
---
We've been working hard on the VATS issues over here! the VATS system is pretty complicated so it has proven to be a difficult fix but our team is constantly working hard on it.
---
Also remember that explosive degrades your weapon quite a bit faster, so for tanking out for a long time, stay away from it. Neither the SBQ nor earl will outdps the healing of a vampire gatling with adequate gear.
---
I don't do melee cause it's really bad. It sucked back then and it sucks even more after the patch. Needs buffed I think. I got these god roll melee stuff and never got to use em ever
---
I never drink from other players' punch bowls or machines because it's usually a given that they'll put Nukashine in there just to mess with you. I thought that was common knowledge. That or Nukagrape to mess up bloody builds if they didn't already get hit by the decontamination shower.

Any build can work especially if you plan it out ahead of time. Some are easier to get to an op level then others but everything is viable. I have a gunslinger that uses a lot of food and drug buffs that one shots level 50s and 2 to 5 shots everything else. My main is a shotty that just one to two shots everything. 
---
Mutations are important! Adrenal reaction, marsupial, and either herbivore or carnivore are universal to most builds and if you aren't going to use energy weapons grounded is great too. 
---
Ricochet, serendipity, nerd rage, and blocker are must have perks for me personally across all my builds. Born survivor and adrenaline are great too. 
---
You mentioned you like revolvers and don't like stealth. Vats is still your best friend for pistols especially those headshots, but any automatic should down enemies fast but it takes a lot more ammo which can be very difficult early game.
---
I do have magic weapons, and yes they are stronger, *to a degree*, but not this mythic multiplier you speak of, so don't tell me what I do and don't know. Its the GUN that's doing it, not just "being bloodied". I can gain as much if not more damage from non magic weapons just by simple min/maxing. "Magic" weapons get the same boost all weapons get through the perks/serums/armor that we use - so that will in turn make their magic effect greater, again *to a degree* - but not the way you're hyperbolizing...
---
Appreciated!
---
I’ve never posted this before 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
IIRC, blocking another player is a per session block, not a forever block.
---
Yeah it was already named and all together. I thought I had dropped it at one of the events, everyone was gone so I was looking around where I was but nothing so I think I must have had a paint and it was destroyed when dropped. I don't remember doing it but I must have. We do labeling like 01- unyielding or 01- bloodied ***. I will survive without it. :(
---
There are so many more now in groups of 4+ level 100 relentless teleporting, light speed , Bethesda listened to the 'community'.
---
It's funny if I VATS them with Gun Fu my character tracks them as they career around the area, makes me dizzy. Same with scorpions.
---
Well, you wouldn't be staggered. More likely dead.
---
But aren’t the drummers helping....
---
Gotcha, I'd never encountered that card before. Thanks!
---
Ah, right. It goes down to 10 vault steel. That's nice :)  
---
However, am I correct to assume that I can only craft a piece every other day if I do not have a supply of Vault steel saved up? I can only buy 5 vault steel a day from what I can see...
---
I don't know why the bullion exchange machine even gives the option of going over 20 treasury notes. It should default to 20 or however many less that is on hand.
---
It zaps, and it looks great at night.
---
Maybe, never came across that card before but seems likely.
---
Thanks. I saw someone running a stealth melee build with a one handed knife and that is why I specced one handed. But I leveled with a level 15 ski sword, couldn't find anything better. Guess I didn't account for swing speed and didn't realize how important martial artist was over damage buff. I did wind up getting and maxxing tenderizer and adreneline to try and up my damage.  
---
Now am going after heavy guns since I have 15 strength.
---
Huh? Why don’t you just use junk to repair weapons?
---
True but your post is 95% similar to the trending post of the same title from a month ago. Seems like a lazy re edit to try and get some karma.
---
Personally I love the specialization of ops. Using rolls I used to never look at, it was always bloodied or nothing before. Pretty excited about the vamp/+10/rw fixer I just rolled, will be fantastic for daily ops.
---
Try extreme range and no sneak attack. With a bit of practice, you can do only 1 point of damage. The downside is having to chase the damn thing to stay within reception range.
---
I don't understand. Then why do we have separate 'block for session' option then?
---
I am glad to hear they are removing them. I hate how fast my character starves/ dehydrates every ~20 minutes. It does nothing but encourages me to bog down my character with food/drinks and interrupts game flow.
---
I understand you are venting and there are plenty of people who agree with you, though yeah, I would say the majority of players have figured out how to progress comfortably enough by this point. Also important to note that Reddit is not remotely the majority population playing the actual game, we are a fraction of voices here. 
---
That said, the fact that people are progressing means that the way you are playing has to adapt to what the game is throwing at you. I know that’s frustrating because you want to play this game the way you want to play it. I remember when I started playing Fallout even as early as Fallout 2, I tried charisma builds every single time and always had at least one pacifist playthrough. Fallout is known for giving you that kind of viability and freedom no matter what build you use so I won’t argue that you need to get good nor will I compare this online rendition of the game to other single player RPG’s out there that also restrict how well your build works. 
---
Still, the bottom line is that you will have to do some research and find a compromise of a build that still fits the aesthetics and playstyle you want, but is capable of progressing and maybe even thriving in the game. Yes, pistols generally have it rough if you don’t have an amazing weapon to carry the build. The same goes for one-handed weapons. But, the game is absolutely playable for a majority of the base, you just unfortunately will have to compromise to make it work. It’s been an adjustment going from fallout single player to fallout MMO for sure, but I still think it’s worth my time investment. Hopefully worth yours too :-).
---
Edit: I just wanted to add to this post all the things I used to absolutely love using in Fallout that I haven’t been able to successfully use in this game. This is so the poster knows that I feel their pain and I’m not writing them off in the slightest, I am just at a loss as to how to get the developers to actually balance these weapon items into being actually useful.
---
Flamer, Shishkebab, Nuka Grenades and thrown explosives all around, Fatman/Missle launcher, Gauss Rifle, One handed Weapons period, Charisma/Pacifism. I’ve adapted to a commando style, something I’ve never done in Any Other Fallout. It sucks, but I at least enjoy the Fallout World.
---
Switch builds, I’m not using hacked weapons and I’m killing everything fairly easy. Without using a magic weapon either. Although I do own a few magic ones for old Earle lol

---
All of the primal cuts over the map that appear every 15-20 minutes are part of that event and will yield a lot of meat (assuming you tag a lot of enemies, meaning dealing enough damage to be eligible to receive XP and loot from them, a few shots are enough)
---
The actual Meet week event at Grahm's place is still worth doing too, other regular events are all very different and would be a bit long to list each of them, but some like Leader of the Pack (northwest of the forest area), swarm of suitors (Mirelurk breeding ground event in the northern part of the map), and workshop defense events when animals attack (those happen at any claimed workshop, you don't need to own the workshop to participate in the event) are surefire ways of acquiring meat outside of just hunting around in the wild and find spots on your own.
---
There's a lot more events that can yield meat that I am not thinking of atm, but don't focus on acquiring meat as a method of making caps &amp; xp, that's more or less unique to Meat Week events, except nuke zones meat, but that's for lategame.
---
the gold bullion I can somewhat understand because they added it in for grinding and if you could just easily buy it from other players it makes the gold bullion items almost worthless
---
ouch
---
I use 200% repair, and carry both a backup (also 200% repaired)  If that does not last me until I get to a weapon workbench, I revert to my secondary specialty weapon or it's a backup.
---
I've started using the repair kits just to drop weight, and generally use them on armor.  Even from 200%, the legs take a lot of abuse from mole rats and other small critters.
---
As an individual who has always played his fallout games on the hardest difficulty I welcome the challenge. I know this is not very player friendly, but it feels more like the games I used to play tbh.

If you think about it, the opportunity for coop and trading with high levels can be viewed as the replacement of the difficulty setting.

Maybe the difficulty is too high, but if it’s making you and your friend strategize and make new friends, that’s kind of a good thing and may actually be the point.

You'll likely not recieve any sympathy now that you have admitted that you enjoy consensual PVP. Griefing has given any form of adventure mode PVP a bad name.
---
A lot of people like the raider play style, what’s the wasteland without some one trying to rob you blind or cheat you? I kinda like it when a couple of idiots try to get one over on me, kinda makes the game more immersive. Not saying trading can’t be better but I do like the genuine attempts of people trying to take advantage of others... it opens the door to mental chess and the chance to rip them off instead.

Happy-Go-Lucky can increase luck by 3 while under influence of alcohol, which I think will increase the chance of crafting duplicates. I drink a bottle of vodka before doing any crafting.

---
I stick to pre-war food as I found there loads in this game so much I still sell a lot if it.

Are you actually kidding me? No improvements on next gen?? All I want is stable 60 fps so I can finally enjoy fallout, but it seems like there is no hope for this. Man I can't even hit constant 30 fps on PS4 slim, sometimes it drops below 20, I am forced to play a melee build because this is the only way I can actually hit anything. I love fallout and I am frustrated af consoles are being left behind.
---
Ubderstood that legendary pa were available during the early part of the game.. can someone verify that? Can see pieces selling on different platforms.. do thry really work, or are they just visual glitch?
---
I'd rather clap dog shit in my hands.
---
The meat you collect at the primal meat event you need to keep that for grahms cookout. Once you get to the cook out put the prime meat you collected into the pots in the centre then kill the critters running around then grab the chunks they drop and put that into the trolly opposite side of the prime pots and there also big green plants all around you can grab also and put them in the cooler next to the trolley.hope this help
---
Yeah what's the deal with that?
---
It's not about Junk or Materials.  The length of time  required to stop playing the game &amp; need to find a Weapons Bench is the Irritating Factor.  So thus one must just devote themselves to Scorchbeast Queen Farming or purchasing Reapir Kits for use between such events.  The repair need is based on a different parameter.  The issue is with Irresponsible Programming.
---
Definitely NOT stable on PS4. Constant weapon wheel glitching/freezing, slow/unresponsive controls (often takes 3-4 tries to do a stimpak in hectic battles), regular BSODs, "server unresponsive" disconnects, the list goes on. If this is stable, I'd hate to see unstable.
---
How is it so? Now that T65 is available.. isnt that pa has the highest resistances?
---
alright i'm watching right now and will comment as I watch:
---
it's about point 3 i guess. 5% chance for initiate, 10% for paladin, 80% for elder. She even explains how these three chances roll seperately and how you have a (small) chance of getting two or three rewards at once.
---
THEN she goes into how she "feels" and "thinks" its not going right. And that's the whole point. That's what basically everyone assumes as soon as he is a bit unlucky.
---
After all - its an assumption, not a fact. I can't prove it wrong, so I just go with what the devs said: it rolls 3 times. 5%, 10% and 80%.
---
If you do elder on first try that is:
---
82,9% to get one reward
---
12.5% to get two rewards
---
0.4% to get three rewards
---
(results might be off since i didn't visit a school since 2007)
---
Doesn't seem that high at all, huh? Chance to miss that 5 times in a row is not extremely likely, but totally possible.
---
And that is for ONE of the rare rewards. Including Burrow Signs etc. if I am not totally wrong since there is another roll: IF you hit the 80% on elder for "rare rewards", THEN that includes a 32% chance to get an actually rare reward and a 48% chance to get one of the "uncommon rewards"
---
Here is my experience:I did it almost every day. Half of that on two characters. I already sold a couple of duplicate Reactors and SpecOps Outfits. Yes - i might be luckier than others. But then there are naturally also people that are less lucky. even unlucky.
---
I feel the same about mine.
---
I know they'll fix it eventually but for now it's helpful.
---
Past couple of times I've done the event, I've soloed it and only needed the JB. And on one of those I never needed to repair it.
---
Good question, I'm not sure.  The way it works out, it's good for getting your carry weight under control just long enough to fast travel to your camp or to a vendor, then the debuff comes and goes before you realize it.
---
I had around 2 or 3 crashes in 700 hours so it really is way more stable, that's for sure. Huge amount of small glitches doesn't really make it unstable.
---
Just the jukebox stretches out the event.  Just keep it on and repaired you'll be fine
---
Sorry to hear that. But Bethesda has said multiple times they are working on solutions. 
---
You definitely don’t need a ‘jacked weapon’ to have very positive results in this game. And the world and server are big enough to find another spot to play. 
---
Best of luck!
---
With my Gauss Pistol I always without fail miss my first shot in VATS. I have to factor that in now into how I play. The second shot onwards will hit however. It's such a strange bug.
---
There's not much they can do to increase the resolution besides toning down the scaling. The new consoles are bound to run the game faster at least, but i wouldn't expect anything past 4k60 for the next gen.
---
Server hop? I think it resets the animals involved.
---
Yeah I run bloodied commando and took a beating on that first resilient robot op. But a few tweaks to my build, more defense, and going back to my sentinels pieces was all it took. I'm liking the update
---
missed the reply and answered myself :D see below and have a nice day!
---
I can't tell if you are being condescending towards me or not but I was not saying that I think they aren't needed anymore or anything, just saying what is probably going through the empty skulls of the people scheduling updates. Sheesh.
---
Crossplay between consoles? cool, crossplay with PC? no thanks!
---
I wish. But they already wasted this opportunity with Raiders vs Settlers.
---
Thanks for the answer. That's why I came here.
---
95% of the griefing in this game are people who cant handle PVP against those who can defend themselves so they go after the unprepared. True PVP balance would eliminate a lot of griefing.
---
or the ranged just bash them or use a backup tire iron?
---
When I show up and others are there I'll start playing instruments. But many time those other players let me get mauled by mobs so I have to stop playing and start shooting. I usually don't even go for this event now.
---
It all sounds promising. Looking forward to the legendary perk tweaks, but I really hope they apply to existing characters as I've already got the maximum number made and won't be deleting them.
---
&gt;They're looking to add player-versus-player content in the future, not a priority at the moment due to the lack of players engaging in player-versus-player besides in Nuclear Winter.
---
Because it was implemented so poorly. If they had made Survival mode more like NW with no legendary items and you all start on the same playing field, like with seasonal resets, it'd have been so much better. Also there was the issue with spawn camping.
---
It should be around 4K @ 60 FPS on next-gen consoles. Fallout 76 is currently around 2K (upscaled)@ 30 FPS on PS4 Pro and 4K @ 30 FPS on Xbox One X.
---
The backup can't be the same type of weapon.  The speed wheel glitches out if the weapons are similar.  So it requires the PipBoy to change out a weapon - in the middle of combat... Even high level repairs are breaking frequently.  I'll just keep saying it: They did not adjust the repair values.  They are at different rates than the new patch.  Not adjusting them is lazy.  Not adjusting the Perk Cards is Lazy.
---
I mean bethesda had a habit of butting heads with sony before Microsoft bought them. I doubt that'll change anytime soon.
---
Don't forget the armour pieces with 15% blocking, they'll magic up just about any shotgun
---
I wonder if they are not worried about it because with the addition of mods, we could graphically improve the game on our own. Would make sense but if that's the plan they should say so. Personally I would prefer that.
---
i dont want to live in a world where fallout 76 has dupers
---
That I cannot answer.
---
  I can only speculate the thinking is ... for whatever reason you decide to block someone, the delay from end of session to the next play session would be sufficient for one (or both) parties to calm down. Next time you cross paths, the scenario is likely to be different, ergo there would not be an issue.
---
But that's just a WAG.
---
No SPECIAL has any effect on Super Dupper, it's a flat chance and can't be modified.
---
I bought a B/40FSS cultist dagger for this reason alone. Worked pretty well.
---
I was now years old when I learned we get scrip for prime meat. I’ve been ignoring it mostly. That’s about to change.
---
Where i can find a build for a gunslinger (possibly revolver)?
---
I still not understand how mutations and legendary perks work, but at least i search for a build so i cannot waste special.
---
I definately knew vampires worked yeah, just was curious how deep the bug goes haha
---
Tough shit. There are too many people who are greedy enough to dupe everything they can get their grubby little hands on so they can hoard it and make everyone else pay through the nose once the dupe is patched for one of maybe a dozen copies of a god roll or legacy they duped.
---
I love this post because I've been seeing a ton of players claiming that melee got nerfed into the ground; when really this proves that bloody got whacked, not melee as a whole.
---
Lifting weapon levels won’t fix anything.  They will just dupe those.  
---
They need to fix/create new engine and remove all duping exploits.  
---
PvP will never be balanced cause of legendaries.    PVP should be its own mode and no legendaries allowed.
---
Would also be nice to indicate how much total power our camp needs and is currently producing.
---
What do you mean the length of time to find a workbench? Your camp is portable. 
---
I don’t know what programming has to do with anything.
---
I have some for trade, what system are you on?
---
Yeah I rolled one a few days back(mutant +50 limb damage and +250 damage resistance while reloading) its pretty awesome, I came across more thought player vendors for dirt cheap to... got a 2 shot pump with the +50 limb damage for 400 caps, then a bloodied explosive +50 limb damage pump for 200 caps. How close are you when you use it in vats? I'm usually about 4 feet away (vats goes in the 90% hit range).
---
I’m calling BS. You can’t just die unless you shoot back and when you’re in an event and everyone’s name is yellow then you can’t take damage that way.
---
Thanks I was considering making a post asking about herd mentality so you saved me some trouble. I think I play with friends often enough, long as distance from teammates doesn’t matter I think I’ll get it
---
well they plan is sought after for being legacy , but i dont think anyone cares about having someone paint thiers with initiate if thats what you mean.
---
that being said any magic weapon is better than a legacy, yeah?
---
Anyone else notice the issue with the shotgun too? Combat shotgun does damage out of vats, but enemies seem to heal it back? But they don't do that when you fire from VATS? Anyone else experience something similar?
---
Not the dark red leather suit with black belts and Firemans Helmet?
---
We are aware of this issue and are investigating
---
With that it makes any shotgun "vats magic" right?
---
Server hop and you can buy more.  It is super dumb she doesn't stock more like she does modules, but there is that work around.
---
Sooo they back pedaled on the bos content. They said 2 parts then they said all in one aka more content at once. Now its back to "trickle" it in again. Got to milk the content teat i guess when you have very little. They need to hire a debug team and let the current team focus on content. Burning the candle on both ends in hobbling content. Still im glad for what qe get.
---
With the axe you can add the Legendary Perk "Hack and Slash" and get the explosive damage.  Works with unarmed melee such as power fist and 1 or 2 handed melee.
---
That's very.. creative
---
Nothing to do with magic weapons, at all.
---
You have "take one for the team", making you killable when you are in a team, unless you are a pacifist.
---
That would be dope but leaves console players hanging a bit. Unless they were able to make stable mods developed by pc players available to console players!
---
Ah, lame. Thanks for letting me know, will have to adjust my layouts.
---
No offense i can kinda tell that you have very little knowledge of the wider fallout universe if your comparing the wider brotherhood and enclave to common slavers and raiders, even Fallout 4 brotherhood only has that one really shady quest about stealing crops essentially, but fallout 3 brotherhood was actually really nice and helpful.
---
(Oh wow i just reread this over again and tbh I'm not sure you've even played the damn game)
---
Nobody with a brain wanted private servers to "avoid pvp(there is a button for that as you so kindly mentioned) and the pvp raider mentality thing you mentioned was about 4-6 percent of the community, that's why survival mode tanked because nobody really has ever fought over anything other than workshops besides a hand full of peeps that can easily be ignored if it's not your thing.
---
Wastelanders brought the npc framework, a boatload of new content, and decently fun stuff to grind for, and is easily one of the better dlc experiences I've ever had(played every fallout game w/dlc)
---
No it's a free trip to destination fucked.
---
the problem is with the take one for the team perk it allows someone to kill you if you have your pacifist off without you attacking them back , so not your fault its a game bug
---
They should just have legendary enemies in events be open loot. Excluding Earle and SBQ to make sure you participate. If it dies it can be looted by anyone in the event if they tagged it or not. Everyone gets their own personal loot from it. Also would be awesome if they make corpses with legendaries glow.
---
There will always be people who AFK at events or don't participate and that won't change. But the current system of having to worry if you kill it too fast for others or don't get the tag in time is awful and sucks the fun out of it.
---
&gt; Stop making excuses for a multi billion dollar corporation
---
Are you whinging about reddit or bethesda at this point? I hope that you're aware that reddit and bethesda are two different companies.
---
Ouch, you think? I was getting worried I said something wrong 🥺
---
I'm going to be on the lookout for a good legendary one of these since Bethesda decided to fuck an entire playstyle over with this bullshit annoying modifier.
---
Gameplay feature being sold for real money: bad. Very bad.
---
&gt;Am I in the wrong?
---
&gt;Should I have had the foresight to turn on pacifist mode when I didn't know it was even off?
---
Since you said it had already happened before, the answer is yes.
---
&gt;Was me not being able to navigate the menu my fault?
---
Maybe, but the event happens every 60 minutes; just go to the next one.
---
In the meantime, go here: https://help.bethesda.net/app/home and see if there's any help articles on your problem and if there's not, file a bug report.
---
That's what I thought, so thanks for confirming that for me.  I mean, I get why people want to be efficient, but my understanding is that the event runs once per hour per server, so it's not like finishing it faster will make it spawn faster.  Anyhow, I guess I had a bad luck, I will keep trying.
---
Hopefully with microsofts involvement thats something we can look forward to for future games!
---
Awareness to highlight the body parts that take critical (yellow) damage when hit, and provides a small boost to damage when those areas are hit by you.
---
The title made me think this was a song reference. Lol
---
But... some legacies are magic. So they’re both. Making “magic is better than legacy” invalid, because there are weapons that fall under both categories.
---
I planned to hand out painted sets of T60 or leave them at my camp for visitors. I usually give out jet packed x01 but have considered this with the BOS returning soon.
---
This seems to happen to me more often than actually seeing the rewards screen.
---
Spoilers, I guess? 
---
Datamines for Steel Dawn have revealed two new unique BOS members arriving, one from the Mojave and one from the Capital Wasteland, that were recruited by the original California expedition as they moved East. I'm gonna call it now that these two people will have a respective expedition to their home territory that they will lead/organize. Then again, all of this information is subject to change.
---
Yup if you protect the jukebox and repair it, that’s all you need
---
Did it with fallout 4 and Skyrim so I see no reason why they couldn't plus they have said they are bringing mods at some point to 76.
---
They would be limited to cosmetic or non game mechanic changes as it is a shared world.
---
How does the game exist? What created it? Is it not Code? It's a measure of pulling up code and making a value change. Programming is the heart of the issue.
---
Truth be told, I don't see why consoles couldn't do cross play.
---
They're similar environments, just their portals to access the game servers are different.
---
Hell, I forgot what game, but they accidentally enabled crossplay between Xbox and PS4, then finally came clean and said cross play wasn't allowed because of Sony.
---
Console crossplay is likely the same reason here too, Sony won't allow it.
---
What do you think cm2 means, community managers. There’s two that monitor this forum
---
Don't remember if it's every shotgun, maybe one prefix doesn't, but yeah. Mufflee (sp?) put up a very informative post about this awhile back. It's pretty much the definitive "magic" guide to all weapons
---
BRING ME THE PITT!
---
The benefit of using a single type of crafted food is that it makes it *very* easy to just keep that one food favorited and consume it without having to open the pipboy. and the crafted soups fill both food and water, so it's doubly helpful.
---
thanks!
---
Yeah. In fact, this would make me grind even more. Right now, I have every gold bullion item I needed unlocked on my main. I don't have everything, but I'm just 500 shy of the max 5k gold bullion and I don't care to spend it at all.
---
I won't be buying any of the other weapons or armor, because I won't use them, so they'd just lower my chances of getting an item I want when receiving a purveyor roll. If I could trade them to my other characters, I'd definitely unlock most of them.
---
The rare helmet is white, and the rare uniform is dark blue- the other set is the set you get from the story missions with the fire breathers, and that’s the set that’s in the display case at the overseer’s house
---
I’ll be honest, didn’t see it. I ran primal cuts in the Mire three times today and was very frustrated, hence the post.
---
Ok Roy.
---
Nah resilient honestly isn't that bad. So what if it takes a few gun smashes? Just as with melee, there could be different kinds of gun bashing? Citation needed. But. Standing still versus running up and doing it. I'm supposing most have been running up to do it. Just make it a point to literally bump into the enemy and then gun bash as close as possible. Most misses for me have been because I was sloppy or the enemy strafed away and the hit didn't register. Solo run times are a bit longer with freezing mutation. And depends on location. Valley Galleria or whatever was easier to run than the Burrows for resilient. Freezing overall has been the longest to solo, with times closest to the 8m mark versus resilent at 7m15s - 7m30s ish
---
👍
---
That’s really awesome! If you’re on Xbox i would gladly help you level up or give you some of my old weapons (I’m a hoarder so I still have weapons from when aí was level 10) :)
---
Now that the levels are more balanced you might be able to take out some glowing ones for High Radiation fluids and Glowing mass. You need those for crafting flux. That or get carried through a queen kill and pray you vet flux as a quest reward.
---
Even worse, before the beta a youtuber asked someone at Bethesda, and they said the scrap was going to be weighless. Then they made it cost weight for server stability, which I'm fine with, but then F1st came.
---
Ah, sweet! Thanks a lot for the info! :)
---
100% this^
---
Cool story, bro.
---
1 cap per bullet is actually too much in my opinion. 
---
 They need to make it so you can price stacks of items in Vendor. So you could have bullets at .5 per round. Which is what they go for on Discord Market. 
---
By all means, play the way you want, if it works for you, which it seems it does, great, but as steel and lead are so easy to come by, you are wasting your caps by buying ammo at 1cap per round.
---
I understand it all now. I watched about 5 hours of youtube videos last night at my 2nd job to try and understand what was happening. I didnt even know that if you are lucky enough to get the 80% on elder that there is another 60/40 split to as what you get. I thought ot was a 80% chance for a RARE drop...lol...and dont feel bad about math and school...because I haven't been there since 2000 lol.
---
Im gonna try the "thought" unless I am in that last "luck" tier of "unlucky" as of this am I am now on day 7 of no rare reward on elder completion. What im hoping for is the rng gods are going to build up the bad luck and ill get 3 different rare rewards for the next 3 days. Bahahahahaha
---
I can start the encrypted event but whenever I start it we always fail, if you want you can add me and I can start one my psn is XxzgrimCYBORGzxX
---
Try posting on trading sub reddits should find a seller quick.
---
Your post here will likely get taken down they don't allow trading/buying/selling here.
---
I have a ton of purified water so I keep that as a favourite as it does water and HP. Then I just eat out of battles. Dont get me wrong I craft all the soup and meats ect, but that all gets farm to NPC vendors with 98% of drugs and buffs.
---
I don't rly see whats irritating with making a stop at your camp every now and then to drop off stuff, put stuff for sale, repair equipment? Its not like that takes forever :p. To me thats just part of a game that uses weapon / armor degrading mechanics.
---
The listed resistances don’t matter *that* much. All PA has innate 43% damage reduction (energy and ballistic), and 90% radiation reduction. That means they’re all MUCH more equivalent than you’d think.
---
But to directly answer your question, it’s because there was a little known but long-standing bug with Ultracite jet packs- you could put them on any limb. So a jet pack arm (since arm mods are mostly useless, and the power attack one doesn’t stack) means you can still have another mod on the torso. Say, emergency protocols...
---
This got patched a while back, so people who have ultracite jet pack pieces now have “legacy” armor. 
---
*cough* I may have made like 6 of them when I first learned about it, anticipating them becoming legacy.
---
Look in your inventory? It gets loaded into your inventory without having to view that screen.
---
It would seem by the downvotes the community so far seems to enjoy the exact same content posted constantly instead of anything fresh. Haha
---
I agree! So many weapons are left as they are when there could be so much added to them! For example, the death tambo and guitar sword. Fantastic weapons but they are useless because they can't be modded
---
9 more levels and you can get all the slugger cards and move to 2 handed.  It's definitely is the best.  Use Dodgy and Blocker to help with your damage stats.  Also, Hack and Slash explosion when you are mobbed (scrap your one-handed melee once you upgrade to 2-handed for Legendary perk coins for Hack and Slash
---
They don’t. Workshop plants won’t get nuked either
---
I agree, it's super annoying and I've definitely died because of it.
---
Was not trying to be condescending, just pointing out that the locks and computers are but a fraction of the reasons that people change cards and the “perk” they added is bugged, or at least that was the last thing I read about it on here. 
---
And I do agree that it is fitting for the programmers that update this game.
---
Please make the official measurement in flamingos as well, in honor of tradition.
---
Wonder how speed demon will be updated with the removal of hunger needs.
---
NO, even more so now that Bethesda is a Microsoft holding.
---
Doing Todd's work
---
Good that you checked yourself! This is second time in a row that I overslept and didn't checked on time.
---
The power armor sprinter legendary perk. It slows the use of AP when running. That's actually a non-legendary perk, but doesn't work in power armor because.... ???
---
It's a boring effect that should be a standard perk. Maybe if it did something additional or combined multiple perks, such as pain train, or if it decreased your jetpack AP usage it might be useful.
---
PC, thank you very much for the offer but I am currently not looking to buy/trade them.
---
This. I was having this problem. When I logged in, it said MAX RANK 1/1. So I looked at my Scoreboard and it returned to normal, no further issues.
---
did i really need to include a /s in my comment?
---
It's amazing how you said everything i did in only 3 words XD
---
Sorry for the late reply.  I guess you figured it out!
---
Lol, just looked it up.. it already DOES do double at midnight, right now. Noon is 50% penalty.
---
personally speaking, Atom shop fridges should work at -90% spoil rate, they should give us a normal plan for a barely functional one that does the current -50%
---
It’s fine bro
---
I know the plan as well. I've painted a few peoples and given away a set or 2 there are some collectors who like having a painted set but they don't really sell. Honestly its a lackluster paint job and most don't even know what it is or how to tell the difference between it and some of the other paints its not really flashy or eye catching.
---
The plan on the other hand would likely sell really well as I haven't heard of or even seen one in the wild for a long time.
---
Bethesda really needs to do something about durability. It drains the fun from the game.
---
Sorry I updated with a build that's close to what im using now. Another tip is to always have 5 intelligence so you can switch out for crafting perks like gunsmith. If you look lower on the linked page you'll see the mutations and their descriptions. Legendary perks will open for you after you hit level 50. It opens one slot that you can then choose one legendary perk to put in (but can change later at the price of perk coins which you get by scrapping perk cards you dont want). I believe you gain another legendary perk slot at 75, 100, 150, 200, and 300 (or something like that).
---
Do i need to be in a blast zone for the glowing one ?
---
You will. In my house, we're all gamers. Me(42), my wife(34), my son(13) and my daughter(11) all play games. We do "Unschooling" Homeschooling, and use video games as teaching tools quite a bit. Our children learned to read by playing Stardew Valley(No voice acting, just text) as well as a few other games. They also learned critical thinking, logistics, risk/reward, etc. We play on our own private Minecraft server, as well as 7 Days To Die (Zombie Horror/Survival/Build/Craft).   
---
Anything you can do to connect to your child, even playing video games, is a parenting win.
---
Yeah, unfortunately you’ll have to do it before you log in each time (assuming your app has been restarted) but yeah.
---
This is true too but my hope would be to be able to alter the pistols family without affecting any other weapon system, like rifles.
---
LOOK AT IT
---
Because reasons.
---
what platform do you play on?
---
No idea but I haven’t bothered.
---
I hit level 50 yesterday, and that was the first Legendary Perk I took.
---
isn't it cheaper to just make your own ammo?
---
Turns out, a chunk of people hate always-on world PvP. And once you allow them to opt-out, wolf PvP becomes pointless. So they've tried "survival mode" and NW, but most folks just want to have fun in a Fallout game, not PvP.
---
So you have to spend a very long time grinding the gold bullion to buy it. If it had a lower cost you wouldn’t have to spend as much time playing the game.
---
I only put nukashine in my machine and my punch bowl. I hope I’m not the only one who is disappointed when you drink from someone’s machine or punch bowl and it’s not nukashine
---
Considering how many people bitch about it continually, yes.
---
I used to use that often until the side-effects caught me off guard. I keep two on me just in case.
---
*for you
---
😹
---
I am pretty sure the glowing ones only drop it when they are in blast zones or come out of them, not positive. Try throwing on a hazmat suit or crafting the stealthsuit if you have it for the rads and grabbing a rifle and maybe finding a safe vantage point for yourself so you can kill a couple and store the materials before trying for another kill!
---
yes, enemies that spawn in a blast zone have a chance of dropping them.. IF they are killed in said blast zone, luring them out tends to yield the "weaker" nuke zone items. glowing meat and glowing blood
---
Feel free to add me, I have a few extra keycards &amp; I run with a group who know how to complete it. DtotheR0CK88
---
Okay, I have the white helmet, now I have to look for the dark blue uniform.
---
You have until reset Monday!  Meat cook all weekend!  🍗🍖🍗
---
Also why type of flux do you need. I can check later to see if I have any spare! If you are on Xbox that is!
---
Yes. Like every session. I've never had armor break this often, especially when using Fit It Good. Pre-patch 22 it lasted a long time.
---
It works but it's finicky. If you just grind up a full health enemy it does fine. If the enemy has hit the resilient phase due to being shot, it doesn't. But those you can easily handle with a bash.
---
Don't be scum like them 👍
---
It's very creative cause he is wrong lol, the block button doesn't stop you from matchmaking with the person, they just can't message you or invite you to teams if I'm remembering correctly.
---
Really ty for you help!
---
Exists a perk or something that can regenerate your health doing dmg? (A sort of vampire/lifesteal)
---
And If exists, Is It viable with a gunslinger build or i'm asking too much?
---
3 different rare rewards. Granted!
---
(Valley Galleria Signs, Burrow Signs and the V94 Stash!)
---
Why are you in such a rush to find her? Just play the game and you’ll encounter her along with all the other companions eventually. I’ve found her over ten times already without even trying.
---
Yeah they only drop that stuff in a nuke zone its 10 flora per 1 stable flux.when I first started I just asked the high level players in the map if they could sell me 5 of each flux for the jetpack most say yes or just give them. If ur on xbox I'll slide the 10 you need pm.me I'm on every night
---
It's a secret.
---
Try the mod Better Inventory. It is better.
---
Mothman was creepy the first time I tagged him. looked like he wanted to eat me.  He is the nice one, the other ones are mean and they make everybody go nuts.  Rumor is there is a treasure in them hills. Hint: there is., but it is in a vault and it is protected by a bunch of bloated glowing ghouls. Have fun and enjoy. The community is generally nice and helpful.
---
Sounds good, i'll give it a try. Thanks!
---
The degredation while in Combat is based on a now older rate.  Degredation Over Continued Length of  Time has Increased.  So losing a weapon that degraded from full health from an incorrect value  is cheating the user.  Furthermore any weapons that are similar and placed in the speed wheel have a high probability to glitch out. Rendering a backup weapon almost useless.  The combined aspects are not indicative of a well programmed game. Some aspects of this need to be fixed for basic playability.  It's not about resources.  It's about Inept Programming.
---
Go to Billings homestead and run up the coast looking at white dots, all the way to the lumber mill.  Repeat until you find her.  Took me two tries.
---
That is surprisingly low. I have maybe 2-3 crashes (game closes on it's own) per week on average if I play every day.
---
Ah yes I actually just made an alt exclusively for my magic shotgun. Quad double barrel “magic effect” and 25 less vats cost. Insane honestly. Put some point in reload speed.. and I only reload two bullets anyways. It’s major yikes. Trying to tune my build quick so I can test in daily ops.
---
When i focus on something, i have to complete it. I wont rest until i find her. Now move along
---
You can also do sbq and earl events. Both events drop random stable flux as a reward.
---
As a non power armor stealth commando, I can hold all three nodes, will people please stop being so scared of them
---
Yes. Exactly the Point.
---
Don't forget toys and paint cans as sources of lead as well.
---
Works on enemies who aren't in the resilient phase; it just blows right past it to dead. If an ally shot your enemy down to 1HP, you have to manually bash rather than shred.
---
🙏🏻
---
I fully support this message
---
Always sniff the pipe
---
I dont think i have it discovered. Where is it
---
the bow seems to work if you let go as soon as it knocks the arrow. the arrow will literally act like a cartoon and adjust trajectory in flight to hit the enemy, like clipping through the ground or flying upward then bee lining at target
---
Yeah I used a anit armor 33 25 handmade from 35 to 50 it still does good but I have a level 45 anti armor 33 2 star i use now.kinda a bummer
---
😫 i have 2 of those already....take it back.... I just want the solar chargers and war glaive....lol
---
It seems maybe your problem is design, not a problem with the code. 
---
Regardless, if you have such a problem with repairing weapons, bring multiple weapons. Or make a mobile camp. The tools are there for you.
---
well if that was real roleplaying in a world like fallout I would kill a thief trying to steal my weapon but since you can't just take it back from him it sucks and there is logic in it
---
My ss armor has never broken except for the right leg but everything else never
---
You have dmg perks  or sneak attacking. That’s the only time I’ve noticed I killed a squirrel
---
Wdym? Im honestly confused. Why do you want to find her so badly?
---
All that AP to sit there and reload for 10 sec every 6 shots....
---
I agree the plans would be worth something, and the paint leaves a lot to be desired, guess I’ll hand out paladin sets or Elder sets when the Brotherhood arrives. Repaired and modded like 12 sets of T60 for their arrival. Time to go repaint a few.  Also I didn’t plan on selling it. I give away full sets of armor to random players if I hear “Aquarium” on the classical music radio station while near them. Passed out over 100 so far and I’ve got 41 in my inventory now.
---
They don’t work for wild flora, right?
---
Is it just an outfit or does it have damage resistance like under armor?
---
Cause she kinda cute ngl
---
Thanks
---
Because it belongs to the secret service? You think they'll just hand them out
---
I replied to your other post but it was removed. I can craft one for you.
---
Sorry to hear that. I never play in the mornings but I ground out a half a level this morning since I just passed out last night.
---
how did they nerf concentrated fire?
---
Creatures that spawn in and die in nuke zones have a chance of dropping the mats for stabilizing flux.
---
You may want to head over to the trading sub and see if anyone will sell you the flux though, it's a far quicker option. On xbox, stable flux sells for 100 - 200 caps each.
---
I am selling only plans. No mounted heads. Ign gn0mish
---
On pc :(  but I appreciate it!  I'm not stressing leveling up yet, seems to happen organically.  ALTHOUGH I jist built my first camp and it looks pretty pathetic compared to other peoples i see!  Think I get some fancier flooring and chairs by leveling up...
---
There aways tomorrow and the day after and the day after that and so on.
---
The timer is strange it will say 20 mins but in the right corner where it says make noise it's a 5 min counter.people usually turn off the jukebox thinking they have 20 mins and the event fails.they patched the time where we could stretch this event out to farm it...
---
Yeah but she looks like she hasn’t had a wash in over a year lol
---
make the rare rewards common!!!11!!!
---
Tried yesterday doesn't work😒
---
“Only when a mosquito lands on ones scrotum, does a fool realize violence isn’t the answer...” out witting them is more what I meant, like maybe you drop your shit after they do and server hop to safety leaving behind a bag with .38 ammo
---
Make rare rewards common?
---
It’s been less than two weeks lol
---
Honestly gonna disagree, the market would flood faster than you can say EZ, they aren't hard in the slightest in general and the rewards are already more than generous enough with the ammo and legendaries.
---
u\toppjeff
---
Damn you beat me to it
---
What you did there...see it, I do. Hmmmm?
---
Oh damn!  I haven't gotten that far, I was still wondering about that treasure!  And I didn't know there was more than one mothman... thats a little freaky
---
I hit Flatwoods for Brahmin milk and I need to build a Brahmin Pen.  Gulper Lagoon for the Innards.  
---
There are other locations, but I can't remember their names.
---
At some point maybe. It is currently not on the roadmap which means that it won’t be something that happens on 2021.
---
I feel guilty because I do rob people of XP however you don’t have to deal with the hard to target wolfs, mole rats and rad scores
---
Well shit Bro, you watched the guys video, so you’re obviously buddies IRL, what kinda beer does he drink, and will he trade his B2525 fixer to me for 200 caps?
---
Microsoft is far more likely to allow crossplay with PC before it allows it with Playstation. It isn't just Sony.
---
I never thought about asking people directly lol. Yes. I'm on xbox That'd be great!
---
What I’ve noticed is more leachers now at events.  
---
I’ll do them solo for majority of the event and then when it’s boss time or event timer low people pop up.
---
Because helmet.
---
My god yes, these god damn burrowing mole shits and scorpions are just the worst.  At least the radscorps seem to be limited to the ash heap as far as Primal Cuts is concerned.  However, all the primal cuts events have some kind of fast moving, annoying as hell creature... absolutely miserable for a tanky 50 cal player like myself.
---
Someone on here argued with me yesterday that they ARE guaranteed. I won't name names though.
---
It only ever seems to be the legs I've repaired them twice in the past hour.
---
Hey thanks for that heads up! I'll definitely pop over to my original character to see if she has anything interesting. I know last time I logged off I was pretty heavily encumbered so I hope I find something :D
---
Why you would upgrade it beyond 1, eventually 2 stars?
---
mmm yes h e l m e t
---
It only seems to be my SS armor too
---
If you make the rare &amp; uncommon rewards 100% drops and unrepeatable you'll only have to win Elder 14 times and never have to play DO again. 2 weeks and the Ops will be as dead as ACP.
---
Meat Week always affects event attendance, in my experience.
---
I never go to radiation rumble unless there are already people there same with free range. But since the update events like tea time are much more difficult, definitely can't do that one on my own anymore. Otherwise I think it's hit or miss depending on server, if you have a few event groups then they usually show up
---
Yup, so annoying
---
That’s exactly right. Damage boosts got nerfed due to the new calculation, but the weapons themselves still have the same strength scaling as before. I actually thought the scaling was going to change but I was relieved to see it didn’t. It also makes my life so much easier when reviewing for updates.
---
Dude ots the wasteland. Course she hadnt
---
Imagine a perforating magazine for a lever action
---
Damn, I'd still hand it out or keep a few tell them what it is and let them pick.
---
Fun idea passing out T-60.
---
JrArevalo956 add me I'll be on in about 4 or 5 hours
---
What system you playing on? PS4/XB/PC? I’ll set you up with armor if you’re on PS4. No charge, fully modded.
---
Meat week is the easiest time to farm gold, so people prioritize that
---
No, good players emote and gun bash. I'm absolutely gonna blame the players who just kill it instead of letting everyone else get a legendary too. The game is partially at fault and should have a better system, but it doesn't and you one shotting the legendaries preventing everyone else from getting one is a dick move.
---
Shoutout to the guy I told number 1 to.
---
Me: States number 1
---
Him/Her: and how does that impact me?
---
Time to gooify some blood eagles
---
Usually has to do with legal issues. Conflicting EULA agreements have kept crossplay from happening on some games.
---
That, I’m not sure about.
---
I’ve honestly not tried it.
---
Go play fallout 4 survival mode for a few hours, you won't come back complaining about one wasteland trust me.
---
rad-ant lager
---
not anymore you would have to drink a serum with the food you have selected to negate the cant eat meat or plants negative effect from the mutation
---
You getting lucky doesn't mean the pricks are few and far between. There are quite a few of them all over, you've just been lucky enough to avoid them.
---
No, I don’t think it’ll be like Daily Ops. They’ll probably involve much more story telling rather than kill ‘n’ loot.
---
I have all 7 paint jobs that I drop temporarily so they can see them but I painted the others with initiate thinking it might be better for those who missed it. Came here to get a better idea
---
To be fair, what game doesn't have some bugs, I just know Beth rushed out FO76 with far too many. I'm glad so many have mentioned it's improved. And really extra glad to hear theyve most addressed the griefing. Pacifist existed when I played but didn't seem to work. My base got rekt too many times to count with that turned on and off. 
---
As for FO1st, I really want to believe I'm gonna like it enough and if I do I'll probably hop on the bandwagon, if not to at least try and lure my friends into it.
---
if anything i would make them harder to get and non tradeable. just to annoy people.
---
Omfg yes, and its so super laggy on consoles. Need this
---
The auto grenade launcher is viable for anything really. It’s one of the better launchers. The rest all have various hit detection problems or something else holding them back. 
---
The normal M79 is similar in damage but two shot gives it insanely large cross hairs so the shots are not nearly as accurate as the auto. You’d wanna be elevated/above enemies for a better chance to hit, or use formula P to help the accuracy.
---
Yeah but I mean she is literally covered in dirt. She looks like she’s been rolling around in mud. At least the other companions look like they have tried their best to keep their body’s clean.
---
Clearly you hav'nt met the right cat yet
---
It's all code _ design still needs to be coded. What about Indoor Combat? Not all indoor areas have applicable workbenches. The Increased Rate of Decay asks the inevitable use of Repair Kits.  The speedwheel Glitches out with any weapon similar to another.  So use of a Preferred Backup Weapon is a risky attempt that the Glitch won't occour. 
---
Above all they did not change the Design nor the Code to reflect a completely different use of Design or Code however one sees it. It is Ineptitude in either regard. Defend it if You must - there are others who will not.
---
I just put the pocketed mod on all my armor. Shit breaks so fast idc about extra defense mods lol. Also the excavator armor for a quick TP to the nearest stash box
---
I'm glad to hear that, I remember back on release XBOX consoles seemed to be given all the attention from Beth :P I'm glad to hear yall are still having as much fun as you did on release. Thanks for the info :)
---
Thank you. I'm definitely gonna peak at my old character before I start a new one so I can see if I have anything worthwhile :)
---
Great to see it is being updated.
---
I have a feeling they're not updating the game because console strength isn't the bottleneck. Their server capacity and outdated engine probably is.
---
Far left side of the map along the road that runs along the river
---
Did they change it with 22?
---
Unfortunately there isn't a perk like that but there are legendary effects on guns such as vampires and medics. I believe vampires is per hit but it hasn't worked well for me. Medics is per critical hit and heals a lot which is great on a vats build. 
---
I tried making a non vats build for you: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=67845fb&amp;d=sg2pb2pp2pj0eh2ej4c62ce0i10ir2ii0ad2a11ak2al2a00ap2la2l71lg2lt2sb1s00
---
But like I said I haven't played without vats so i don't know if there are any bugs (for example shotguns do shitty damage outside of vats). 
---
I'd recommend watching angryturtle's YouTube videos. He goes over different perks and builds.
---
believe it was wastelanders
---
Scorchbeast queen or the event, not sure which can drop stable fluxes. Random which ones though.
---
Public teams? Im intrigued. I might not go for a sub right away but I really want to like it enough. I really wanted to like it enough on release, hence why I was so salty to give it up for 2 years. Fingers crossed, thanks for taking the time to answer :)
---
If you want one to try out i can make you one if you're on xbone. Can whack a mod on it as well. 
---
Saw someone say it was the best two handed melee weapon now.
---
There are several perks like this as well though. Let them have their fun
---
Y'all have me convinced :) thanks so much for taking the time to reply
---
ED-E coming in with some BARS
---
I'm usually in chinese stealth armor, which doesn't have any mods.  I keep hoping Bethesda will allow pocketed for it, but that's never going to happen.
---
This game is amazing for an explorer. It's not only at the marked locations where you can come across something interesting. And there is a lot of environmental storytelling as well, where you come across a scene and try to imagine what went down there. Read all the terminals, read all the notes laying around. Those who say that this game has no story must just have ran from quest marker to quest marker. It's definitely worth it to only use google as a last resort.
---
How you got so many of them?
---
Those will increase what's already happening?
---
I would still do daily ops even if i had all the rare rewards. Its great for ammo and stimpacks. While legendsrys still make 70% of my sales each day ammo is probably about 15% now. All I need to do is  grab a weapon that uses that ammo type and walk into daily ops on an easy day and just farm.
---
Also. Having no rare rewards 2 days in a row really suck.
---
 yeah, its also very good idea!
---
Some things in life you just have to work for.
---
Dude. Its a game.
---
More of a badge of honor than a practical weapon.
---
Just an outfit
---
Most often my left leg but at least once probably twice a session I game to repair. It's like the armor perk isn't working on its durability
---
It’s not the best but it’s close. The only reason you would want it is so you have a unique weapon to swing around.
---
So now we use Radiation Rumble.
---
Friend after 1000 hours in game and more Uranium fever runs than I can count it's probably not "luck" LOL it's a trend.
---
That would definitely make the events and causal teams useless but teams as a whole right now aren’t creative either way  but on the topic of a challenges team do you think that’s a good idea?
---
xbox, i worked super hard to get a full set of armor ace t45! All i need to complete it is the flux for the jetpack! Your offer is very nice, thanks!
---
Does anyone actually use RadX? I occasionally used to use one during nuke zones but since wastelanders havent touched them at all.
---
I wish they counted as melee hits against resilient enemies in daily op. They are melee weapons after all.
---
Who knows. Maybe Appalachia has it's own Woodstock every year
---
On ps4 sadly, I've tried it before and thought it was good, but that was pre wastelanders. Hopefully I can work something out in the market sub cause I have missed the event a few times now for some really dumb reasons.
---
Not when not enough people are picking up. They only slow the time down once the event starts.
---
Complete opposite od the ss armor, id run my pa if it could carry as much as my armor and backpack. I'm a hoarder and can't seem to change that lol
---
No, it just makes it so you can use any of your shotguns. Don't need to get a specific prefix 👍
---
Flexing on mfers

---
Alright, to the wasteland i go, see you in a bit!
---
I sell both, but armor, even with pretty good rolls sells slow...at 10 caps per scrip price.  SS armor killed the armor market because SS is just so much better.  To sell  armor it had to be unyielding with either AP regen or sentinel.  It's hard to move anything else...and I can't keep a ton of it sitting in limited stash on the main.  On the other hand, outfits crafted from rare plans move pretty quick and take almost no weight.  I don't bother trying to sell extra masks.  I ditched all the extra non-rare ones in a station ages ago.
---
If your very lucky yes
---
I’m running excavator with the leg mods lol my carry weight is 465 rn it’s really helpful
---
It's like wearing nothing at all.
---
Ultracite ammo yes from mobs and end reward, However the cores will only drop for you at the reward screen and you get 3~ or so.
---
If you want to be more ammo efficient prime Gatling gun is a great alternative choice because mobs drops 10 to 60 ultracite 5mm and it only takes a couple of shots to kill them.
---
You can also just take out your plasma Gatling at the boss if you want cores.
---
Fair enough, I guess I can chill out about it. It does look really cool so I'll keep trying but I'm glad to know I'm not missing out on like the best new weapon.
---
It's not too bad with calibrated shocks on the legs.
---
Normal large backpack is 60, then +50 from 5x deep pockets is 110, and PA shocks add +100 so carryweight only goes down by 10.
---
Not applicable if you're running that extra large backpack mod of course, or have a different PA mod on your legs.
---
Counter question... Why rad-X? Does anyone even use them? Like ever?
---
Guess I'm getting downvoted for asking a question smh
---
Ah yes, sucky old melee really sucked before patch 22 when you could hit things for over 100,000 damage with non-hacked weapons if you had the right perks and buffs.  Melee builds were just too weak to even bother with.
---
It’s possible the perfect cat and I are like two ships passing in the irradiated wasteland night... or the cat became someone’s lunch.
---
#cancelcatmeat
---
Well if you’re on PS4 I’m looking for some UnyAP(?) forest scout pieces :)
---
Whats wrong with the casual team? Its almost the same thing if you count the repeatable weekly.
---
I want to drown my enemies in a swarm of bees
---
\*Season
---
What?
---
I think they said some of the stuff from Legendary Run will end up as gold bullion purchases at some point. i only got about halfway through and regret not getting the chicken coop so I hope so
---
Have the weapon out before the boss gets killed and you will get cores for it.
---
Me thinks doggo outweighs this
---
Bees are to be loved, not feared! :)
---
Yeah and now that I think about it, it weighs 20 so it isn't very practical like you said.
---
Season, not battle pass.
---
Totally agree. There are so many cards and gear that synergies with bloodied, which only makes it even more powerful than it already is. Berserkers doesn’t have much of anything that doesn’t already help bloodied just as much.
---
I will say though that I run revenant, mysterious savior, and broken life saving to revive me when I go down. It’s pretty fun when it kicks in for the extra damage boost. But once again, bloodied could use that too in exactly the same way.
---
Its better for the non-bloodied players as they don't feel quite as pressured into a completely OP Bloodied build and have more options available.
---
I think most people knew Bloodied would get nerfed eventually. It still pulls ahead of every other build damage-wise and has the massive perk of increasing ALL your SPECIAL stats to extremely high levels with Unyielding gear, which no other builds get. Its just not so far ahead that high health players that use utilize AA or TS weapons feel useless in comparison.
---
Getting the plan is only half the issue though. It's the travelling to the Rusty Pick to see if Mumbles will give you an Anti Armor swing speed reduced weight version, and then you spend the next few days seeing which of the mods for it you like.
---
i don't seem to damage robots - get to Zero but they do not die????
---
It’s a battle pass
---
Went 4 days no rare then got a triple and double every day since then
---
Any way to work around it?
---
Well I know you can purchase the Ammo Converter for Gold Bullion
---
Well done sir/ma'am..   I laughed a little harder than I should have
---
Damn, well anyway if you need any help with fallout 76 I’m available anytime :) oh and camps always look pathetic the first time you try building one lol. Always search for camp plans (red ones) if you need items to build a camp and levels come naturally so enjoy the game and I hope you have a good time in Appalachia!
---
No they do not work on wild flora, or someone else's for that mater.
---
That too, yeah I guess I've been pretty irrational about it. I'm a collector at heart but I really need to take a step back sometimes.
---
Stable must be a relative term
---
Cant you already buy it from the settlers?
---
PA durability is amazing. It's one of the benefits nobody really talks about.... You'll go literal weeks without having to repair it.
---
I ran up and down that river like 5 times now. All scavengers and raiders. Can you help me, by looking on ohter servers, of youre on ps4
---
I don't think I have ever used the speed wheel for weapon changes.  
---
My primary and its backup are two different legendary switchblades.  Their respective backups are legendary combat knives.
---
Might be playstyle.
---
I try to keep everything at 200%, and I tend to pre-select a weapon before going into a given location.   
---
if either needs repair, I'll do so before I get to said location, or I switch to the secondary weapon that is fully repaired so I don't have to worry (too much) about breakage.
---
Since I don't use the same weapon 100% of the time, it seems like my visits to a repair station are farther apart, making it seem like my weapons are more durable than they really are.
---
Shoot, I’m glad I switched then! Haha
---
Not last I saw but it's been a while since I checked. Hopefully!
---
I'm at a random campsite in the Cranberry Big, listening to Ring of Fire
---
Except their not.
---
I used my phones mobile hot spot and connected with no luck.  Still crashes at the exact same spot.
---
It's SO annoying! It's like socks and underwear, they are almost NEVER seen! 
---
An option to make it so socks and underwear appear as an outfit please.
---
You don’t need to spend to get access to the better rewards like you do in games like Dead By Daylight, that’s why the term Season is appropriate not Battlepass, they are different things
---
Ok dumdum.
---
Came for the Parody, was not disappointed
---
Not on my game, it's not.
---
I’m about 15 ops runs since yesterday with no rare rewards. I’m jelly.
---
No problem I had trouble the first couple of times I rarely die now at all if you can get PA with emergency protocols on that helps too if not put asbestos lining on a single piece of armour stop the falling debris killing you too.
---
It does now.  Things hit harder and daily ops etc really hurt.
---
What are you twelve? lol
---
If it’s really stressing you out then maybe try to find one in the trade forum?
---
You nailed it on the lag part. If I could just rapid-fire cook this food without having to wait for the game to catch up with me the cooking process wouldn't bother me so much. I mean, I still do it though. That's good xp right there.
---
Oh ok, I was under the assumption that you had to buy it. Thank you
---
Something something pension, something something *tension*
---
Nope, it’s free.  
---
People can spend atoms to pay for ranks, but the season is free
---
Rad-X...useful when SBQ dumps you in the radiation zone, especially near the fissure at 60rad+.As I clearly said I only carry a small number for emergency use.
---
Also ready source of caps.
---
I used to when SS was not a thing when fighting ghouls. I can see them being useful for newer players that don’t have SS fighting ghouls.
---
It's for the better even if its worse for your current build.
---
I still have both legs and the chest of my excavator armor at full condition from when i first crafted them, but i did have like 30 something int so 🤔.
---
I am
---
Mines whiskey and bufftats but pepperoni rolls and radstag also have carry weight buffs
---
The first Tenderizer I got from mama was AA SS +STR, but I never really use melee weapons. Is AA the new melee meta?
---
Except the wendigo. Haven't seen that plan in a vendor since someone posted the pics of one being used as a chandelier. Looks f#@¥ing awesome!
---
Just don't build it on top of the cranberries, many people farm these. I have seen a lot of camps right on top of them.
---
Oh god I’m laughing so hard at that thought of getting groped by the mothman. 10/10 good post, I love reading experiences of new players. You know what, I’m gonna go exploring today. Sometimes you forget how nice it is to wander around when you just fast travel everywhere like I do.
---
Wtf? XD I'm so unlucky. Despite getting elder first almost every time I've only gotten one rare reward all other days have been none. ;_; At least I've gotten a lot of really good legendaries to sell.
---
Hey thanks for the reward, that means a lot, and may the sarcasm always be with you.
---
Hell yeah. I got a hazmat suit favourited for when I suddenly encounter radiation, but having to scroll back thru the pipboy armour tab and put on a whole list of items after is annoying as shit
---
It's those pesky molerats.
---
You know what, fair. They get a reprieve.
---
 try camden park. Go to the bumper cars and than head over to the shoreline a random spawn is over there. Ive found her and the punk there a few times.
---
Yep. Mama dolce, teapot, and a few others were my casual eventa, now with lvl 100 molerats thats a hard pass.
---
no problem my mans
---
sounds magical
---
Public events mostly, and meat week the first one we just had. You got them everytime you did prime cuts, plus getting them for every public event.
---
Of course, i like to farm them too :)
---
Very simple. Lvl 170 and I have a bloodied uny rifleman build and 3 laser rifles. All same upgrades and same damage, 97 dmg, 9 ammo. One is Furios / vats and can kill a lvl 50 supermutant in 20 - 30 shots with or without vats,
---
Second one is bloodied ultracite laser rifle with vats and can kill a lvl 50 super mutant in 20-30 shots. And the third I use is a explosive laser rifle than can kill a lvl 100 supermutant in 1-2 shots. Before the patch all my weapons were good, I did not have to reload 5 times to kill a lvl 50.
---
One of these days, I need to compile my overall cooking changes, showcase more food options and reward people for getting the more rare and dangerous bits, as well as rewarding those who go for the more complicated ones with several parts over the base, simple forms. 
---
.
---
One day...
---
Try it with a magic armor piece🤓 while crouching.
---
Yeah i already know all the spots. Im just looking for people who would look with me
---
What are the 3 stars? Certain stars make all shotguns lethal in vats.
---
Speaking of Fatigues i love how they broke them as UnderArmor then restored them but i still got screwed out of the Flux i used to craft two Shielded versions of them previously.
---
If your implying it's hacked or something it's not lol was a random role from murm and I'm on (XB1)
---
Same issue with known/unknown; plans/recipes... I'm on 72 out of "learn 76 recipes" and spend hundreds a day traveling to CAMPS with 100+ plans, just to be all mounted heads and like 5 recipes I already know :(
---
&gt;I think i got blessed or groped or something.
---
For the glorious Mothman, those are the same thing.
---
I love it when people selling over 10k ammo rounds but for 3 caps each
---
fast travel bait
---
so, Steel Dawn is gonna have less content and on the same dripfeed system, meh
---
And I might be on the minority here, but I really really REALLY don't care about building and stuff, I have my house built and thats it, I don't care about decorations and furnite and what ever they are planning.
---
I guess since everything is gonna be free I can't really complain that much, but ehh...idk.
---
Pretty sure it's just limb damage and...i wanna say plus 1 agility.
---
Do you have the plan tho?
---
Depends on the platform. 
---
For example, I'm on PC and it's on my list to finish knowing all the plans. Since it's on there, I'd part with quite a lot of flux/junk/whatever just so my list is complete. 
---
The big buyers are people like me that want to finish the collections
---
I have a AA explosive and a quad explosive. It’s pretty good when I tested it. I can kill lvl 100 things pretty fast with it and I was not speced at all for shotguns.
---
Sounds like we have an 'up close' magician
---
Triple rewards because each level has a (once per day) chance - 5%, 10%, 80%. I've yet to get a triple but had concecutive doubles from the very first ops winning as Elder.
---
Hey man, you got any extra pipe? I’ll pay yeah back!
---
Love the treasure finds, they do happen
---
So then you would say like what, 200-400 atoms for a pack? Would that sound more fair
---
So you don’t use them, you just want to complain about it?
---
Its also possible to get no rewards two days in a row
---
Just like me :')
---
One of the games I was looking forward to playing at 60 FPS. Especially since I'm ahead of my PC account by about 150 levels. Disappointed that they can't even be bothered to unlock the framerate or see if it can even run at 60 stable on the next gen consoles.
---
My pirate build is sad, harpoon guns are fun : )
---
Thank you all so much
---
I love you! Yay!
---
Same, I have a responder fireman outfit and helmet, forest camo!(which i got from an event so very special to me), tattered field jacket, USA mask and FSA mask, Bos jumpsuit, that's my small collection, what would you guys rate it's value as overall?
---
👍👍👍
---
Some weapon rolls break part of the system.  It’s different from hacking which someone did intentionally.
---
They know, they don't care. No really, not to be harsh. They just don't care. 
---
The developers have answered this on a LIVE stream before. They "want" to add it but it's just not high on their priority list. They seemingly can't figure out how to monetize it and that's probably one of the reasons.   
---
These developers come from single player mindset games and have been learning as they go about the online aspects of one. They don't know the importance of having a guild/faction/clan in the game and how it is usually the driving factor as to why many players return to MMOs.   
---
Although, this is coming from the same developer team that thought it was a good idea to nerf everyone 2 years into the games life instead of make their own AI better.
---
Do let me know how it goes. I have a low level alt who is going to be maining Pistols and shotguns so if it’s worthwhile I’ll make a note to get tank killer down the road. 
---
I’m primarily a heavy gunner and haven’t felt too hurt by the update. The only thing that’s really changed is that I use power armor more than before in order to maximize stabilized for additional armor pen.
---
Well i mean it's good at being a big hammer, probably excellent at tenderizing things, but i don't think it would make a good coat rack or vehicle, so i guess in the end it's up to you.
---
I’m sitting In a ring of Fire,listening to ring of Fire
---
It’s got a good ring to it,I think the young ones would say it’s Fire
---
You get 5 scrip for 5 prime meat, and you can turn them in 2 or 3 times per meet cook!
---
Yes, I found that out after this comment they changed it by mistake.
---
Is it okay to use a good old fashioned AA.50cal?
---
They should have a category called beating a dead horse . 😂... im sure they are very aware and they don't seem to listen.
---
They didn’t increase rate of decay though... in fact they slowed it for daily ops which is huge.
---
Partyboy to boost that whiskey goodness.
---
All the damage perks should be reworked to max 5 levels maybe 4 instead of nine points like now especially now since you have to have them all on to do decent damage. This would allow other perks to be used to make qol stuff easier like weight reduction. 
---
Example every heavy gunner perk cost 15/strenght points so there is nothing else you can have on if you reduce the 9 damage perks down to 4 or 5. That 5 or 4 perk point you could use for something else.
---
I have to admit, that when the Purveyor sale was on just recently, I tried for the whole 3 days, about 1300 scrip worth, on rolling 3 star melee weapons really only wanting an AA version of the Tenderizer, didn't even score one, let alone an AA version, but at least I got a wealth of 3 star reduced weight rolling pins, meat hooks, boards that didn't take up much space in my stash.
---
My name is QuakeSumo, and I'm one of the many Fallout  76 victims, living day by day with the hope of finding my own personal 'Unicorn'.
---
Spesific legendary effects makes shotguns "magic" weapons. Thats what you hsve right now.
---
Ah thanks for letting me know, normally when i hear 'magic' weapon i think of like the mini nuke mini-guns and stuff lol
---
In daily ops all durability is 50% better so there’s that as well.
---
Game was like "here's a troubleshooter for your troubles noob" (no offense) 😁
---
Sounds like a "magic" weapon. Certain legendary effects on the weapon or on your armor make shotguns extremely powerful in VATS. It's been a long standing bug for a while now. Having instigating, junkies, stalker's, vats hit chance, limb damage on the weapon or block damage reduction on an armor piece causes this. Works for high rate of fire weapons too outside of VATS.
---
The Repair Perks are not up to date as well.  Both this &amp; The Speed wheel Glitch do not indicate a well coded game.  Balanced use of weapons is a Player Style Yes - that would factor into weapon breakage.  The Wheel Glitch is a thing for some of us.  
---
The d-pad fast swap is dependent on what weapons were used more often - yet tend to be based on some unknown quotient.  It will often pull up a unrelatable  weapon to the current Combat Situation.  That is not always a reliable tool either.
---
Moreover Highly repaired weapons - readied before a situation are breaking at an highly incorrect rate.  Again it's a Inept level of Code &amp; Programming.  I can't defend it. Sorry.
---
Could you imagine being a vegan in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust? I bet they mention it to everyone.
---
I just want 60FPS :(
---
How is everyone sure he isn't talking about Fallout 1st?
---
But yet here you are playing the game
---
I didn't get any rare rewards for first 3 or 4 days after patch release... -_-
---
yeah, it was VERY mucha  pick and choose yer battles which was nice, and more realistic IMHO.  Now it's max out all, and burning more resources to do the less damage overall.
---
I've bought over 250 repair kits when on sale. Allows me to focus on playing the game and not worry about repairs.
---
if you're implying that i am implying it's hacked i must inform you that i am not implying. Look up fallout 76 magic weapons
---
Its "magic" limb damage is one of them. Even with no shotgun perks that gun will wreck most things in vats. Enjoy it though use enforcer to cripple limbs.
---
Did it take you long to gather so many of them? I am struggling getting enough to buy all daily gold and doing these 3 daily quests from handy/settlers/raiders are like salt to my wound after I finally maxed both factions.
---
And the chicken coop, and that’s it.
---
If the hackers weren't an issue then that would be awesome! I do think we'll get it eventually whether they address those issues or not.
---
I thought that shit was cool when it added 50lb, but immediately regretted it when I went -50 shortly thereafter.
---
Isnt this a you problem? I dont crash when killing spesific enemies.
---
It's easier if you have a rad barrel and decontamination shower at your base for rad management, but you can survive these events AND do great damage at 30-40% HP instead of &lt;20%. Just incorporate born survivor 1 into your build and the good old bloodied survivability perks (blocker, serendipity, dodgy, maybe ricochet if fighting that robot op).
---
It’s the mole miners venting system for there caves . We’re sniffing mole miner farts . Pipe is life  !
---
PC
---
We can even inspect shit in player vendors. First things first.
---
Sorry fo assuming lol I've heard that term used to describe the hacked in ammo weapons i/e mini-nuke mini-guns lol
---
Buddy u really deserved those 3 rewards
---
The One Wasteland configured the bad guys on a curved scale.  Part the changes to the bad guys optimized the armor class by level, if I understand correctly.
---
Evidently the armor scaling is very bad at levels 14-23.
---
They don't have to increase it - but leaving it as is has increased the rate of decay.  The fact they slowed it in DO's shows they could have altered it  outside of the event but did not.  It then just seems about selling Repair Kits.
---
The worst use of VATS in the game. Useless
---
Idk there servers always just crash out of nowhere, but It could possibly be my internet
---
When they explode, do they damage you?
---
It happens all the time to me. When I spawn into a world, when I fast travel, just loading an instance. It's just a visual bug, at least for me, it's stupid but harmless.
---
I've never actually had to drop anything in order to hit a lower weight, so that's unfortunate if you're getting that behavior. I guess you can submit a ticket and see what happens?
---
Woukd be nice if they added outfits and legendarys as their own categories in the stash box and inventory aswell
---
There is another way they could address this - by slowing the rate that food and drink decreases. But no, banish them!
---
I know it’s not related to your request, but unless you plan on quitting the game soon 73 is nowhere near “too late” to switch your build. I didn’t even know what a decent build was until level 70. And now I’m almost 180 and I decided I’m moving to heavy guns. I agree pistils are trash but saying it’s too difficult to change your build at this point is kind of a lame excuse.
---
Pipe is life!
---
More times than not when I do uranium fever these people are here, but keep acting like it's not common
---
Just wait until you see how fast my explosive double barrel shotgun breaks :/
---
It's a short term solution to a long term problem. Lol. I only use it to get to the train station near my camp. I usually waste enough time crafting ammo, cooking meat, scrapping weapons and armor, and bulking junk to sell that the hangover is done by the time I am ready to move again.
---
Razblokirovki🤔🤓
---
What? “Leaving it as is us increased the rate of decay”. 
---
What are you talking about?
---
Man it sounds like you have a decent gun and build.  I'd give it a go again.  Sometimes I think either my internet or the server gets a bit laggy/buggy and damage doesn't apply right for me.  Every once in a while I get an earle or queen that Just. Won't. Die.  The group that I run with have all soloed the queen and earle as well as done them in large groups but occasionally we run into that problem.  Not sure if this helps but its something I've noticed and can't explain.
---
I had to make a mule and dump everything on to it. Only keep the bare essential on me to keep under the weight and keep my damage perks on .
---
Well you know what they say, you meet an asshole once, you met an asshole. You meet assholes all day, you're the asshole.
---
A whole brahmin gives 1 steak, a whole bottle of whiskey gives 1 shot.
---
Nope. Your just unlucky. I sometimes run into bad servers but it’s rare.
---
Nothing at all
---
Cardi B's next hit?
---
I mean I feel like all of those issues have to do with server security, and as far as I am concerned on PC Bethesda has yet to put in an anti-cheat system. If they did a lot of issues would be solved. A bunch of PC players would be butthurt about cyber-security, but developelopers like ubisoft have been doing this for a while. Its risk you gotta take for the security of the game.
---
I could be way off base here but based on what I’ve been told about the ones I’ve collected; the scout masks are around 30k, BOS and Forest Camo are around 50-60k, and the tattered field and fireman outfit and helmet are worth over 100k. Again I could be a bit wrong on either side of the amounts but those are the amounts I’ve roughly traded for each one mate!
---
Stupid sexy Flanders
---
Quad double barrel? That doesn’t even make sense! Lol
---
In the right hands, with good two handed melee perks it's nice for thinning out small mobs. AA is starting to become popular on a few weapon types that can push out damage quickly. Not just melee builds.
---
Ty
---
This! All of this. Scrolling through everything to get an unyielding piece is a pain
---
Yeah even though I don't have a mic and I wave people over to the legendaries. But sure, that makes me an asshole that I don't hog legendaries and allow others to get the kill lmao
---
Battle pass?
---
Yet you can still die inside.😁
---
Thanks, there was a bit of lag and people getting booted and having to re-enter.
---
Its shit below max rank what are you on about? What am I going to do with a budget of 1 syringe every 40 minutes as opposed to 1 every 10?
---
It’s just a random encounter
---
If we can add that you broken gun owners, PLEASE JUST MELEE. PLEASE!
---
Sorry, it still works fine, afraid you’ll have to find something else to complain about today
---
definately!  so quick question, i play on pc and at night mountain standard time i think (im in utah) from like 10:00pm to maybe 1 am.  There's not really alot of players around that i can tell from the map anyway.  How do I meet others and are there groups or something i can be a part of?  (not daily quest groups, i mean like socially in game)  ESO had guilds and stuff you can be in and i don't know what they have in this game, but as fun as im having in fallout76, there is that pervading feeling of being a lone wanderer happenin.
---
;)
---
This is true. Players I notice at events just sit there and do nothing and some others shoot a couple of times then stop moving. Probably on their phones like I am right now.
---
They need to separate armor from clothing, and they also need to add separate icons for legendary weapons and legendary armor. At high level, a camp full of non-legendary armor is just as worthless as a camp full of clothing.
---
Ah yes the sale, as a non 1st user the sale is a nightmare for my stash and actually almost convinced me to to get it for the first time.
---
If You're Cool with it go forth... But there are fundamental changes to enemy AI - the decay is set at attacks for probably half the values we face now.  So it takes twice the amount to damage an enemy - with the old values on weapon decay - then decay is quickened.
---
I have the same roll on a hatchet, I was saving it for trades but I packed it with me for yesterday’s ops, it was handy.
---
Definitely a magic weapon. To help understand what a magic weapon actually is see Angry Turtle's video about magic shotguns [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHu4CErJXU4). The short story is it's a bug with certain legendary effects that when used in vats makes the weapon far more powerful than it should be.
---
No it makes you a normal player. Most people don't do that, you're the one here acting like everybody is trying to steal your legendaries and insisting your experience is the only one that matters. All I did initially was point out in my experience that event runs real smooth most of the time. If you're this unpleasant to deal with in the game world it's no wonder nobody ever gives you a hand. 
---
Also a good rule of thumb is, if you DO find yourself in a UF where somebody is bogarting the legendaries (which for you is apparently all the time) just leave after the first one. It's not going to get any better and you're just going to get tilted. Try again later and save yourself the vexation.
---
This is Everything
---
They know how to nerf everything. Lets nerf everything and make our hard work useless.
---
Why spend years on a game developing it when we can develop it and fuck it up. Developers are stupid..
---
They can nerf everything under the sun. 
---
Forget doing decent damage...
---
&gt; 1 syringe every 40 minutes
---
What ARE YOU talking about? First rank gives syringe every 30 minutes, second every 25 minutes.
---
I’ll totally be honest. I rarely think of that. Like now I read that and was like “oh yea I could do that”
---
I hopped in my excavator with calibrated shock and I'm like 100 over. Those weapon weight decreases are serious business.
---
Lol
---
OMG! This. So this.
---
Ok then class pay attention to glitch thru a window with PA you stand at it try to place your armor inside the structure if you get it placed then you try to enter the armor and then wait to teleport inside *BaM* screw that cool looking camps locked doors and their attempts to make you wanted! Method 2: find a chair post tree some solid object close to the wall you wish to phase thru, place your armor as close to said object as possible, stand with the object between you and the armor but make sure you can see the enter armor screen (this step is very important!) Then try to enter your armor if you freeze for a second without entering the armor then as soon as you CAN MOVE RUN TOWARDS THE WALL you want to phase thru dont stop running a few seconds later you should ghost thru the wall and be inside the armor
---
Class dismissed!
---
I read a while ago about a great way to fix Duped Weapons.  Weapons when spawned would have to have an Id associated to them. (all provided numbers in the examples are picked from random, and nothing is exact).
---
Example: I just got a Furious 25 faster fire rate, 25% less vats handmade as a drop from heart of the swamp.  When I got it there would be a specific ID assigned to it Ex. NEAL9287463458 (first two and last two letter2 of my gamertag and a code based on weapon type, suffixes and drop location)
---
Example 2: You just got a Furious 25 faster fire rate, 25% less vats handmade from a ghoul at white springs.  Your assigned id would be Ex. GROT9287463499, where the first four letters are different due to different player, and the last 2 numbers are different due to coming from a different drop source.
---
So why does this matter?  When a weapon is duped everything on it is the same, durability, mods, prefix, suffix's etc.  If each weapon had a specific id, the id would be the same when duped.  I don't the exact method for the following, but all Bethesda would have to do is have the game/system/software check for matching weapon/armor ids.
---
If there is 2x or more of the exact same id on the exact same weapon, with the exact same base durability then all they would have to do is delete all of them, as **the odds of the exact same gamertag, exact same drop source, and exact same durability** (which is derived from player stats), **is improbable.**
---
This would be useful to fix upcoming and future duping, once implemented they could even have the game constantly check and if someone just completed a dupe, the game would notice two exact matching items immediately and delete them before that player managed to trade one off.
---
OH it gets better. Then you get to roll a bunch of absolutely worthless 1\* pieces, and some nearly useless 2\*
---
I’ve been playing a PA/Heavy alt for about a year and a half.  In that time, I can probably count the total number of armor repairs I’ve made on my fingers.
---
I am sure after wastelanders I was still able to use broiled SB brains for the int buff on my herbivore.
---
check out FED76, it can give you an idea of the value of what you have. It is rough, but at least an idea.
---
Ad victoriam
---
&gt; Survival system will be toned down (finally!) - Not drinking water or food will not grant you any negative effects. However, drinking water of food does give you some boosts.
---
I still don't understand why even remove the negatives of this.
---
&gt; Building will be focused on heavily next year. (\cough* settlement building/management please*)
---
Please no. Sod off with that management BS.
---
&gt; Every content that comes to Fallout 76 gets reviewed by Todd personally
---
Time to blame Todd for everything again.
---
Thats why it is called under armor
---
Wait what junk is worth caps?
---
Oh yea wouldn’t want to scrap my 20k 10mm one at a time
---
I feel your pain, unlike most of the people here. PvP is so broken. If someone takes your shit they should be flagged, pure and simple.
---
It’s been with the settlers since patch, 750 gold
---
Man I can't imagine playing this game at 30 FPS after getting it to run at 90-120 FPS out in the open and a solid 144 FPS in interiors on PC.
---
It seems lots of people hate the resilient modifier, I spent 30 mins last night trying to get a group together to run one for the score challenge. I gave up and tried to run it myself, thankfully two other folks joined in about two mins into the op and we were able to finish with a stealth commando build and two PA HW builds.
---
What was your time? I've never gotten two rewards
---
F
---
ITT: People who think other peoplr have all the time in the world to play a stupid video game
---
Due to the lack of in-game guilds, text chat and alike, the de facto way to connect with communities is Discord. There are a many different ones, and there's one for this subreddit as well. I'll PM you with some info about the one I'm in.
---
I think they mean stable as in crashes. There are still quite a few annoying bugs.
---
Seems like that to me.
---
Welcome to the game! This game has the best community imo. I'm new to it as well, well newish, just hit 86, and love it. Glad you're on board fellow dweller!
---
I understand that there are weapons I could use that deal more damage than a lower level pistol and if you say there's some boss-type mobs that should be very very difficult to kill with a pistol I wouldn't argue but the fact is at level 34 I should be able to kill a mole rat with a dirty look.  I think the game is nearly impossible to play for mid-level characters as of the last patch
---
I find it odd that all my SS limbs get broken three to four times before my chest gets below 100%.
---
Oh your one of those people - only questions raised by you are allowed. In that case you may as well endorse the removal of 99% of the drops in the game including the multitude wearable and weapons that nobody ever seems to use.
---
Frame rate to 60 at least!
---
ahh shame if you were on xbox I'd help you out
---
You are good at looking like a high and mighty douchebag lol, it suits you well. I help out plenty of players, especially new players, and considering I don't have a fuckin mic, there's no way for me to be unpleasant to deal with unless I was griefing, which I don't do. Loads of people talk about having this issue, not just me, so I'm not actin like my experience is the only one that matters. You're also pretty eager to call me an asshole for having to deal with assholes, which makes no sense. If playing the game in a way that doesn't hinder others and supporting new players makes me an asshole, then I'm an asshole. But at least I don't act like having over 1000 hours makes me the say-so for what does and doesn't happen and then call people assholes for having a different experience that aligns with that of many others. Stay on your high horse lol I don't care. I'm done talking to you, have a good one.
---
Your question has been answered because it does now.
---
Carnivore and ribeye/grilled radstag, gets me 40lbs extra, sometimes 50-60 with radicool. Thrown in whiskey and party boy and who needs the excavator.
---
They are giving multiple double score weekends. Doesn’t need to be made easier.
---
Yeah my friend carries the excavator suit with him to act as a fast travel taxi cuz of the +200 carryweight with shocks lol.
---
It is unclear if you are referring to Seasons for Fallout 1st, so I'll just answer each.  
---
All season rewards you have unlocked you will keep. You do not lose them just because the season ended. Any season rewards you do not unlock have no guarantee of being available in the future. For example, from season 1 only a couple of rewards were made available via bullion purchases after the end of the season (just the ammo converter and the chicken coop I think).  
---
All Fallout 1st benefits you have will remain on your account after your subscription ends, but you will not be able to use them. The exception to this is the Scrap Stash/Box which will still allow you to remove scrap from it but will not allow you to place any more scrap into it until the subscription is reactivated.
---
People are till settling into the One Wasteland changes.   I am still observing players shelling out hundreds of bullets with almost no health movement on the target.  
---
I suggest, rather than assuming someone else is not participating, consider that they may not be as optimized as your build, or they may be experiencing lag.  Compassion, get it.
---
I think this is the main purpose of the egg mines. To distract from main targets.
---
*directional flashlight noises* 
---
(Other than mining/PA)
---
He was 5000 crowns. Last I played the exchange rate was like 1k crowns per 100k gold
---
I'd rather say "nice" instead of good, as it's not the player who's killing the legendary's job to help you. I've missed out on plenty of legendaries because people just slaughter them on me without saying anything.
---
I don't blame them, it's the way the game is. Maybe if Bethesda would allow legendaries to be looted as long as your in the vicinity there wouldn't be any issues.
---
After your first time unlocking each tier in a day you no longer have the ability to get a rare reward.
---
I ended up getting Elder solo after missing a handful of times with rando teammates. Took me 2 tries solo, my advice is don't kill anything if you don't have to. Just try to stay out of sight while remaining near the uplinks. Worked better than you might imagine. Kill anything that gets close but otherwise, don't engage. When you solo, the end "mob" only has 1 enemy in it before the leader shows up, which is really nice. When the assaultron popped up, I switched to ranged to grind her down and gun bashed for the kill. 7:55 LOL I will say resiliant is MUCH harder to solo than the other effects. 
---
TL;DR just hide.
---
It’s not impossible if you use level appropriate gear. You can’t expect to use a level 5 pistol level 35 enemies. 
---
I have a level 26 character right now who is doing just fine. 
---
Anyway, as I said: they will be doing some balancing for mid-level players soon.
---
I didn't read any of that screed. Good luck out there.
---
no thanks
---
If you know how the game works and still choose to one shot legendaries and not let other people get a hit in, you are part of the problem.
---
You just said, "it is honestly stupid that you do all that work..." referring to 8 minutes or less of game play.
---
Science, the energy weapon crafting cards. They're clunky and awkward and dont have many real benefits to them.
---
We should cut them and just have energy weapons fall under gunsmith. 
---
Everything about energy weapons seems like it punishes the player for using them. Bad damage, terrible durability, clunky crafting cards. Having energy weapons have their own perk cards limits player choice in weapons. Discourages their use and has less practical benefits.
---
Just make gunsmith the blanket ranged weapon crafting/durability card.
---
It does feel relentless at times. Went back to my level 20 alt and there's just no breaks.  Glad Bethesda is listening and will make adjustments.
---
Can you recreate the bug?
---
If you don't count all the bugs, it's very stable.
---
I don't think the pistol weight reduction card should be in agility.  But the rest is fine imo.  5% damage per rank of a card is garbage so you should really only be opting for rank 1 cards (10%) for damage.  Even before patch 22, you would get more damage from sneak bonuses than from the guerilla or gunslinger cards.  And now that sneak sucks too, people really should just start playing smarter.  Like, you can basically get a garunteed cripple in one shot of a scattered laser pistol now, they are about as good as shotguns.  I honestly believe the real strength on pistols lies in the incredible utility they have now, the low cost of operation, and their efficiency in perk card usage.
---
Oh, and if you are lucky enough to have a legacy laser rifle or a hacked-in plasma, they are actually stronger as pistols than rifles now...
---
Ok,thanks.i assume the same goes for the vault 94 jumpsuit .
---
It’s mandatory for service-based games to be supported on next-gen consoles if they want to maintain a healthy player base.
---
We don’t need any graphical improvements at all, just a frame rate uncap to 60 FPS is fine, 30 FPS tends to give a lot of people motion sickness, especially with the constant frame drops in current gen.
---
Alright 30 then, I'm not always on the game to check every little perk ranks. 1 every 30 is still shit it makes no difference
---
the sale has not gone through.. there are regulatory hurdles to clear..
---
I feel ‘ya man. I’m not a heavy gunner build, but since I use a mix of vats and regular aiming, it’s super fuckin annoying — also because the vats is bugged out and I waste 30-60 rounds of ammo! Agh!
---
Because agents live by rules, or so I’ve been told 900 times
---
Nope, just seems dumb to bitch about something, that even you admit is not crucial to the game. This subreddit is already filled with complaints, some warranted and others not so much. This falls into the "not so much" category. I'll leave you to your bitching though, hope it makes you feel better.
---
It’s kind of random
---
Yeah, I can’t play fo76 at all lol, says can’t connect to psn, though ps store works fine
---
If you won't read a reply, don't reply to it. Goodbye.
---
I would like to craft outfit versions for sure. I want my survivors denim...
---
Get over it. Most players I come across continue to shoot legendaries until they're dead, with no regard to me or anyone else. I'm my own top priority, not you. You complaining about me one shotting just so I can get something amongst other greedy players is a sign of entitlement.
---
Nobody is obligated to wait for you, and this problem will persist until Bethesda allows legendaries to be looted as long as you're in the vicinity.
---
Now this one I read because it was so short.
---
No, my wife tried it last night.
---
I saw someone today use the flamer to fantastic effect.   It was at Graham's cookout.   A player started shooting everyone there with a heavy plasma weapon.....and then a player in PA melted him in seconds with a flamer.   It was fantastic.   Thumbs up all around.
---
Also, in the last two weeks, saw someone freeze the SBQ pretty effectively with some kind of cryolater.   She barely moved.   Fantastic also.
---
These weapons are in play, just not by everyone.  I'd like to see them buffed too, tho.
---
Yeah thats usually when i have problems.  I've noticed when the server gets like that I'll see my damage numbers but the health bar doesn't really move.  Then occasionally the server will catch up for a few seconds while we are shooting and a decent chuck of health will knock off before going back to no change in damage.
---
Also why we should be able to interact with all crafting benches and other items **while wearing power armor!**
---
So stupid having to get out constantly just to do simple things.
---
Supported and upgraded are two different things, my dude.
---
The complaints and ideas on this sub, Bethesda’s forum, and YouTube lead to 50% of Bethesda’s changes and additions to the game according to Jeff Gardiner. That includes the idea of instanced interior bunkers, which was posted thrown around as an idea over a year ago on this sub. I think we can all pat ourselves on the back.
---
They recently added teams comprised of people that are on your server with you rather than having to manually do it. You can join a team and earn things like +1-4 intelligence or charisma or endurance. There are teams focused on Daily Ops, events and killing legendaries as well. I’ll hope on, join one and just run around solo unless there’s a big event and get all the background benefits of teaming up. 
---
They’ve added a bunch of stuff since the beginning. It feels way less empty now, at least for a while. At some point it does turn back into a bit of a grind, but that’s nearly every game.
---
You can make glowing blood packs with it... but I never use them
---
Honestly depends on your build and playtime, I'm actually pretty casual but super efficient now. So I can do most public events within minutes but the majority came from prime events. Got loads from the APC event to, it's trying to do as much as possible in little time and effort. I mention build to because you wanna get in and out of events as fast as possible, especially with prime events to make it more likely you can hit another immediately after. Not even sure if prime events reward them now, don't remember getting any earlier today but did the previous day, atleast I think I did.
---
1. Its cool
---
2. It kind of reminds of a storm trooper Helm
---
3. It has a headlight about as bright as power armor
---
4. It completes the SS armor look
---
What perks do you use for it?
---
That's your punishment for killing rare and endangered species.
---
Enemies are doing more damage now, thereby increasing the degredtion rate for your armor. Try equipping White Knight and having Fix It Good equipped when repairing your armor.
---
I would still expect better frame rates from improved hardware, but not enhanced graphics.
---
Lame.
---
This was already suggested a couple days ago. Either way though, I still 100% support this.
---
You can use it to make glowing blood packs, which heal give rad resist and if you use the Bloodsucker? Perk its even more beneficial.  That being said it takes a normal blood pack and a couple? antiseptic.  Plus a normal stimpack and rad-x, even rad-x diluted is better.
---
I also sell them as they actually have good value, I horde up 50-100 then throw on Great Bargain, pop a grape mentats and sell.
---
Last time this was brought up the reason was because this game uses the same crafting framework as Fallout 4. Which also didn't have a crafting slider. Last time I checked there also weren't any mods that would enable it, so it's something probably buried in the game that would be a bitch to change. 
---
Seems simple on the outside but knowing the nightmare that is coding, it would probably break 80 things in the process.
---
I think that run was 6.30 with a 3 man team. I have gotten Elder rank solo but its just more fun with others (usually).
---
True lol
---
Love how all base function get more buggy with each update. V.A.T.S 👍stealth👍hacks👍server stability 👍buggy atom items 👍legendary effects(TS, Magic)👍lags 👍duping 👍vendor stealing👍
---
I appreciate it, thanks for the advice.
---
Sorry you have trouble reading a paragraph.
---
If you know how to make Sunshine oil it’s one of the ingredients, restores your to 400 AP.
---
Can also make a glowing blood pack which heals and gives 75 rad resist.
---
That's a real missed opportunity skipping enhancments for next gen. It would drum up interest in the game from next gen owners, "Fallout 76 now 4k 60fps on console", right around the time Steel Dawn drops.
---
Chinese stealth suit for the win!
---
They will get right on this!
---
What does the chicken coop actually do?
---
Yes it is magic. As long as your firerate is above 200 it should deal insane amounts of damage compare to a aa Gatling plasma without bashing.
---
There’s a really cool mod in Fallout 4 called Akma Budai that basically overhauls the Chinese stealth suit allowing players to customize it for different play styles.
---
I assume that the riflemen perks affect the syringer?
---
This was brought up in the PTS and B acknowledged that it would make sense and that they would talk about it internally.
---
It may end up being something that goes live one day.
---
Enemies hit harder and we lose stealth more which means more hits. Also SS is the only endgame armor that doesnt require ballistic fibre to repair, so its actually a lot cheaper than fixing combat armor even if it were more often
---
A gatling plasma may not be able to get the fire rate high enough to trigger the magic effect, but if it does you'll see the enemies' health bars suddenly drop really fast as if they took several times more damage than you were actually doing.  
---
You can see a list of the effects in Angry Turtle's recent video update about magic weapons [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs) . Jump to 1:56 to see a list of effects. Be aware that using a magic weapon could very easily be considered an exploit, though I hope not because there are definitely a lot of people who use them because just they're strong without knowing there is a bug causing them to be so powerful.
---
I do believe that’s the one yes.
---
Prime that bitch. Makes like 4x the 308 ammo in one craft. And fluorescent flux is really easy to get by nuking whitesprings.
---
Better then nothing buddy
---
Not if you're on PS4.
---
Doesn’t matter, it’ll be the exact same experience if it’s not enhanced for next gen.
---
GFYS, you are part of the problem. Trash people like you are the reason people stop doing those events. Sharing the loot with everyone like myself and others do by waving people over isn't entitlement, it's just not being a greedy douche.
---
Thought it was Modus' 👹😎
---
Sorry I don’t check this all the time
---
This and cross save is a must. Im switching to a series X for quite a while due to Sonys absurdly idiotic preorder chaos,  and Im not starting over.
---
I'd be okay with it if there was an option to always play the quicker in-combat animation
---
Turbo fert is amazing. Its the only reason I went with Foundation first. I cook Sweet Tato Stew &amp; it needs a fair amount of ingredients. I pick all my crops, throw a turbo fert at them &amp; BAM, they instantly regrow. Exceptionally fantastic quality of life item in my opinion.
---
imagine...
---
This is what those of us who represent the Faction/Roleplay portion of the Fallout 76 community have been asking for nearly 2 years about. 
---
Well since the main Project Lead said Bethesda Austin is taking suggestions from Reddit how about they do this ('Factions') with Steel Dawn?
---
Seriously though: Zenimax is helping Bethesda Austin with FO76 now (Please Microsoft keep them in check!) so it honestly wouldn't be that difficult to slowly add in ove-time. For starters they can add Faction Public Teams then slowly get more creative as time goes on.
---
Makes fertiliser
---
Honestly it’s how shotguns should be imo. I feel like shotguns take way to long to kill enemies, especially with their health regen bug
---
You seem to not understand the concept of rarity
---
Looks and 10 fertilizer generator
---
Makes sense.  Same thing was happening to me, although, maybe now I'll run in to level 50 squirrels and I'll no longer one-shot them.  =)
---
I just want to see the world burn!!!!
---
Yep everyone know pre patch 22 melee did not do any damage at all 😑
---
I traded mine for a BE gatling plasma and 100 of each flux a couple weeks ago. Theres definitely a market for collectors
---
And why does it not have any mods??? I want night vision and HUD... enhanced perception too. Come on Bethesda!😎
---
They are not doing mischief night again this year. They are doing a bombs drop event instead
---
The back story I gave my main character back in the early days of the game was that he was Don Swanson, son of John, grandson of Ron, who moved down to WV to attend VTU to study forestry/natural resource management and earned a spot in Vault 76.
---
I had designs on opening a restaurant called Swanson's Cramburgers On A Bun With Nothing when vending came out but never really did anything with it.
---
No. I think they mentioned it was too buggy. It's going to be a "Bombs Drop" event though in October.
---
There's a community calendar here: [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4eM5a9X6VmGaV7zz7gYnDy/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-september-2020-updates](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4eM5a9X6VmGaV7zz7gYnDy/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-september-2020-updates).
---
Divide and conquer: have one person shoot the bots while another shanks them to finish them off. Use fast Vampire melee weapons if you have them, such as a switchblade. This strategy will get you to the Elder tier with time to spare.
---
The slow UI is annoying but 20 minutes... I think your exaggerating just a touch.
---
Tesla coil is tier 2, not rare bit not common either
---
But no mods.☹
---
Agreed. I love to browse outfits as well, but hunting down a full set of legendary armor becomes a challenge.
---
I just want a silencer on the 10mm smg  that's it
---
Oh my god. A build where you just throw knifes and tomahawks at everything sounds incredibly fun.
---
Thank you for explaining that to me. It is definitely information I didn't already know.
---
Hopefully microsofts involvement can help!
---
I’m not sure you know what an engine is also this pvp no legendaries mode is called nuclear winter
---
One can hope!
---
There are considerably more known issues than what is on this list.
---
I use steeped fern flower teas, pepperoni rolls, smoked mirelurk filets, mystery meat pies, cramburgers, ribeyes, grilled radstags, Deathclaw Steaks, Deathclaw Wellington, fried toad legs, &amp; a bit of bufftats. Also always good to have a Rad Ant Lager on hand in case of emergencies.
---
No worries, I think it got buried even though it trended. Its still a great idea that would benefit every player. I have a lot of Shielded Underarmour &amp; I think people misunderstand it &amp; think it's just clothes, because it's Shielded Vault 76 jumpsuit or Shielded Long Johns etc. In theory, they are just clothes but once Shielded, you get a perma boost to stats &amp; never need to repair it. It goes under any other armour &amp; all other outfits. Shielded underarmour is amazeballs.
---
Everyone should treat themselves to one!
---
Get over it. You attacking me won't solve anything. The solution is as clear as the problem, which I've given you enough times.
---
Nobody is obligated to share anything with you, there is no written rule for this. Is it the nice thing to do? Sure. Is it something everyone should follow? In a perfect world, yeah. Does everyone follow it? No.
---
You expecting me to follow a rule most people I come across don't follow? You're being entitled. Nobody is obligated to wait for you, just like they're not obligated to wait for me.
---
I'm just telling you the facts my dude. I've been victim to this enough times that I don't care anymore, I'll shoot to kill if that's what to takes. Until loot vicinity is a thing, this problem won't ever be fixed.
---
My favorite part:  Every content that comes to Fallout 76 gets reviewed by Todd personally. 
---
Sometimes I feel a tiny bit bad about the Todd bashing. But since he's reviewing all content personally and doing nothing as they release broken and buggy content... no need to feel bad!
---
Looks dope
---
Thank you lol. All these people acting like it's not their fault and they shouldn't have to care about anyone elses experience are selfish and are a stain on the community. I happily wave people over every time, because I want the legendary but I understand others do too ad I'm not a greedy asshole lol
---
Server transaction is true, but by NOT having a slider, everyone has to queue up the single transactions... 
---
Why have 10 requests for 20 crafts when you could have 200 individual requests? This is the way.
---
Nah let him work on Starfield.
---
Wait, so what does the "new game+" part mean for those of us who have already made multiple characters who already spent perk card points into the same cards? I got 3 characters who've maxed out Ammo Factory already.
---
Edit: Also, massive "boo" on toning down survival aspects, they really need to stop rewarding those too lazy to do basic parts of the game.
---
If you actually got off you high horse and bothered to read you see I write I Rarely used not Never used them. And if you open your eyes you may find that lower level players find them a lot more useful if they don't have very high rad resist armours and perks of late game. So quit your bitching and learn the world does not revolve around useless individuals like you complaining at every valid question - and yes it was a Question not a Complaint.
---
**Absolutely not.**  That’s still about $2.00 on average for just four perk cards.
---
50¢ per perk card is still way too high for what it intrinsically represents. 
---
There just isn’t a good price point.  Either it would be too high for the purposes of using it as a perk card, or too low for the purposes of using it as Perk Coins.
---
Either every player with a little spare cash could bump up their Legendary Perks way too fast, thereby ruining the whole concept of progression over time, or it would only be available to players with a lot of discretionary income which would be unbalanced and a hard step into ‘Pay-To-Win’. 
---
***Gold Bullion***. That’s the most fair option in my opinion. It cannot be bought with real money. It cannot be traded. It is practically impossible to duplicate. There are only three ways to acquire it after the Vault Raid. 
---
- 200/day from Treasury Notes
---
- 300/week from Smiley
---
- SCORE rewards. Total 200 IIRC this season. 
---
So, let’s say 200 GB per Perk Card Pack. 
---
That’s about 8 per week or 64 Perk Coins.   About one fully upgraded Legendary Perk card every 4.7 weeks. That seems about fair to me, as an added method.
---
Nah fam its for the better
---
Greedy douche saying greedy douche things, how interesting. I want vicinity looting, until it comes around I'll continue to help others get the loot too and not be a greedy douche
---
Keep an eye on the ATX Shop
---
That was what happened to me. I used the two-shot auto grenade launcher to melt them down to 1 while two others were finishing enemies off with melee.
---
I've been having horrible lag and framerate issues for the last couple of days. I very rarely do, so it's been noticeable.
---
Weekly challenge includes fixing armors and weapons - Bethesda is helping you to S.C.O.R.E☹
---
There are some other community events in the works to honor Halloween....I may or may not be part of one (as I will neither confirm nor deny).
---
It's why I love that spot.
---
Good XP, lots of caps, lots of plastic, lots of meat, and Bloodied players are afraid to go there.
---
Plugging your ears and blaming other players won't fix the issue, but you're free to continue doing so. Happy looting!
---
Yeah but it wouldn't look good if the list just read "most stuff."
---
I wish it wasn’t so ugly though, I prefer wearing armor over outfits and it’s like a polygon Michelin man in SS
---
Yes. These are all the ways to get into a locked camp. But his question was about still getting wanted with the new perk card its so much easier. I've seen a huge up tick in wanted players. I can understand locking your machines but there's no sense in locking any doors for all the reasons listed above.
---
If they do make this change, they should add some more throw options, like javelins with plasma heads, explosive heads and other options.
---
looks amazing man great job.
---
nothing more to say 👍🏼
---
&gt; ALSO, just a nod to the "Please stop killing my cow" post earlier this week. Don't be a dick and kill someone's brahmin. There are plenty in the wild that you can kill for the steak meat
---
~~B-but what if I don't like their vendor prices?~~
---
Definitely not this.
---
!!!!
---
*Do you want some gum-gum?*
---
It is not. I am using level one and besides using ocassional boiled water found in the wild, it is good.
---
I think it weighs 30lbs with mods.
---
That would be nice, not perfect, but better than it is now at least.
---
You are in for a treat!  The things you like about this game are exactly what it is good at.  Keep exploring.
---
One hint: turn on Pacifist Mode in Settings.  That will prevent accidental PvP.
---
i have yet to test it, but for you PA buddies Targeting Hud would be nice. i know it worked on Cloaked Assultrons like a charm, but have yet to test it in Daily OPS
---
I primed my gatling gun... It never runs out lol,  daily op keeps me supplied for life
---
Some little stuff isn't worth sweating. If you want to bitch, bitch about shit that matters. Go drink a nice cocktail and consider that there are more important things in life/Fo76 to complain about. Enjoy your weekend and until next time.
---
Same with grenades. Never want to target them. Ever.
---
Gross. Blocked.
---
0.4% odds to roll 3 high tier rewards at once. Then considering 3 rare rewards (40%) versus uncommon (60%) the odds of 3 jackpots is 0.0256% or 1 in 3,906. Not a bad roll.
---
That’s less annoying. At least they do something when you shoot them.
---
So how can you tell me it not worth it at max rank when yours is only rank 1.
---
I acknowledged that I also want vicinity looting, I'm listening to you, youre just making excuses for your greed and acting like it's hard to wave people over to the legendary after hiring it once or twice when it's not. I'll absolutely put the blame on you as well as Bethesda, as they are a fault for giving a shitty looting system and you're at fault for being a greedy douche. Its simple really
---
There aren't enough rare rewards to merit that. People would just stop doing ops once they had everything. This is why no one ever does project paradise.
---
Oh yeah. Starfield. Six years in development and we don't have a screen shot.
---
Las Vegas needs to take bets on which will be released first - Star Citizen or Starfield.
---
"The Brotherhood of Steel questline will have choices and consequences/"arcs" based on choices."  
---
I have two characters, around levels 330 and 130.   It allowed me to experience the end missions with both Foundation and the Raiders.   However, I was kinda regretting having two because on not having more perk cards to scrap on my main.   On the bright side:  with this news of consequence arcs, sounds like my 130 still may come in handy for wringing out all content.  :)   Definitely a silver lining.
---
It just doesn't work in real time. It worked in 4, sure, because the game slowed down.
---
OK:     
---
I want Dogmeat in this game.  :)
---
And so it begins.
---
2021 :)
---
Wow, great idea!
---
Doesn't seem to work.
---
Targeting hud doesn't highlight them for me. Berry mentats works a charm though.
---
Or you could just mind ya business
---
So if I am switching from Xbox to PlayStation for next gen my progress won’t carry over? That’s really sucks considering the hundred of hours I’ve played. In that case there’s no chance I’ll keep playing 76 now and once next gen comes out... no point in grinding the season anymore if I can’t carry that over
---
When I run it as my main...I run a heavy gunner build with friendly fire as well for team health. I’m a guass shotgun build currently.....but my flamer is op...I have the napalm mod and the vaporizer nozzle...it’s putting out 97 damage/sec. with no perks....however...super fragile....unless you have repair 200% mod...it breaks if you sneeze too hard.  It’s perfect for daily ops though....enemies literally melt.   Bloody mess is another good perk to add to it.
---
It is worth already at level one. Beyond that is waste of perks cards. I have no idea why you need to use it every 10 minutes.
---
Do primal cuts while its avalible.
---
As someone with 6,000 hours in a heavily modded ( PC ) FO4 with the vast majority of it devoted to Settlement building, I hope they don’t move toward that route. In fact, one of the reasons I moved to 76 a month ago now was that you just had a camp to build upon.
---
The Auto Unlock has always counted towards those challenges for me
---
literally everywhere there are mobs is a good place to go for teh XPs
---
I'm interested in the load times mostly.  Currently my xbox S has an after market SS hard-drive internally after the original one died in January and I didn't want to replace till the Series X released, and I load into everything before all my friends.
---
It's not shutting down my Xbox, but I've been crashing constantly, like four times a day, since the new update. It used to happen sometimes, but rarely. Now it's gonna happen daily guaranteed.
---
IM GONNA POP SOME CAPS
---
Like tow-mater?
---
Did you buy one of the mods for it mistakenly? Sorry, genuinely trying to help.
---
Which cards do you run then
---
Ok thanks, so the image of the card has a sniper rifle and the perk doesn't work with rifle? I'm not sarcastic, it's strange, isn't?
---
Look out for the Flatwood Monster!!👽
---
True like
---
Congrats on your 15 caps
---
Yeah this is part of the Radtoad defense package.... it’s a feature not a bug lmao
---
You guys seriously need to tamper your expectations.
---
But during all the other events it's quite fine to circle AFK in a quiet corner...its a habit for some people that has been encouraged right here on Reddit as harmless, and which Beth seem to have no wish to stamp out.
---
I can the posts that would pop up on here now. Lol
---
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11mzvaPRGmG_Bd_vgaZAmpfAWcZ2QQ_bl?usp=sharing
---
Sorry for taking so much time, here are some pictures of my camp
---
You got more in one day than I've gotten so far.
---
I saw the harness underarmor on an NPC and *loved it*. Finally bought it, thinking it was an outfit.
---
Because a gun is not a melee weapon. 
---
Why can't my fire DMG be used to kill a fire dragon? It uses the same magic spell attack that my ice one does, but fire? I don't get it?
---
I would depend on the mods, but it's not a global problem.  I run a couple and can run Ops.
---
I noticed that there are gaps between swarms big enough to sit down and play the instruments for 10-20 secs undisturbed. And as others have said, the jukebox is enough if guarded and repaired.
---
I've gotten double rewards twice now after none for the first few days.  Full group elder 5:56 and solo 7:54.  I don't think the times matter other than getting you into whatever rank and overall rank chance.
---
Attend events, claim workshops (and defend if confident its mobs not griefers). Don't get sidetracked from completing quests, there will be plenty of time for sightseeing later.
---
Sorry man I passed out last night and didn't set my alarms so I had to rush to work. Thank you for trying to help me but I won't make you wait anymore. Sorry again man
---
😂🤣😂🤦
---
Perhaps that dog was scared shitless by you?
---
Also, a tip for Ammo Converter users, when converting a bunch of ammo: select the highest amount that you can transfer (obviously). Once you hit the [Conversion Complete!] screen, instead of selecting [Back to Ammo Selection] , press "O" or "B" to go back to the previous screen and proceed to spam "X" (on PS) or "A" then "O" or "B" and repeat. This and holding "O" or "B" to exit the terminal makes using the Ammo Converter less of a complete pain in the ass to use.
---
Haha, you'd think after two years of playing this game that I'd have learned...
---
Sounds like you bought plans for protective lining or something, which you can build, but you'll have to have the ss underarmour in your inventory before it can be modified.
---
I got caught out thinking I was buying a plan for 10mm SMG with drum magazine to find it was just the mod's plan I bought and still can't make the SMG yet. Now I read every plan twice before buying after that little mishap
---
From your screenshot it seems like you can get the same plan in one go. Imagine the unlucky triple War Glaive jackpot.
---
As I expected they are hoping us to forget the pets they "wanted" to add and leaked through pet-related emotes in the shop
---
Sounds great.   Which prefixes are best with it, same as others?  Bloody, junkies, furious.....anything else?
---
I had this happen last night. it was obnoxious.
---
It's not bad programming, maybe the dog just didn't want to die. You should be able chase them down easily simply by following the marker above their head.
---
This is how I've gotten burned out. Daily SBQ kills for 5 months and no drop. Statistically I think its like 1200 kills to have a 75% change of it dropping. Probability is a harsh mistress.
---
Considering i solo wrecked everything else its possible. On a serious note i think it literally didnt know how to get to me so it did that thing they do where just run
---
Between that and no plans to enhance the game at all for next generation is leaving me pretty pessimistic.
---
We have everything from sweaters to shotguns! Get our Kurt Cobain bug out bundle!
---
Pc players don’t even want to play with other pc players. Of course no one wants to play them either.
---
Tesla rifle does it better just aim at the floor and poof they're gone
---
I'm not. You can't stay alive with one person, and it's often a struggle with two or three. Assuming anyone else is bothering. I loved it last time, but now I'm just wasting ammo only to have the event fail. That goes for several other events, too, not just meat week. I'm not a wimpy build either, but I can't pull all the weight on these and if no one else is participating it's a waste of my time. This update has pretty well ruined the game for me. I don't mind a challenge, but the events are overwhelming for casual players, which I consider myself to be.
---
But don't complain. Everyone else thinks it's awesome.
---
Well when every other enemy comes directly at me even the other dogs when one starts to just run and run and run with no goal it leaves us with few conclusions
---
What about those tons of legendary itens that can only be sold for 150 legendary scrap a day? I accumulate a lot of itens that I don't want and cannot scrap on the craft tables.
---
If you don’t have time to play it then don’t xd
---
To increase the EXP earned, join a causal team for the extra INT.  Early in the game you can make Brain fungus soup which will boast your INT by 2. Also sleep often in you camp for the well rested bonus which increase how much you earn EXP by 5%.  If have lunchbox use them in events with others. That can increase your earning up to 100% for each lunchbox opened.  The reason you do it in events is others can share when a lunchbox is opened and they may join in.  As you level up, you may find the recipes for Tasty Squirrel soup and Brain Bombs which will help in earning EXP.
---
I actually like being able up shoot grenades. Since you can't "cook" grenades, i use them like mines that you can throw much farther, and then shoot them when you want it to explode. Though i wish they would let you only target your own grenades, so it doesn't clutter other players VATS
---
"Where is my brother?"
---
"For God's sake I'm not a synth"
---
I have a vampire and suppressor....I like the vampire better.
---
Go for the Gauss Shotgun and mod it with a short scope plus the other mods suchs as hardened receiver,  bruising stock, perforating mag,.. etc. I get nearly 600 DPS with the shotgun perks.😎
---
Oh yeah, it seems like they are winding things up on this development-wise.
---
The stable thing seems like an excuse to stop bug fixing anyway.
---
They should just hire the people who put out the community patch mods for Skyrim/fallout 4 e.c.t and let them actually fix that shit.
---
Just another thing to add to the list for people who post about the game knowing nothing of coding. People often assume "it would be such an easy fix for -insert function here- ; they just need some lines of code and done." I'd imagine whatever they want fixed will often break something else indeed.
---
Lmao. I mean where are the mutated squirrel that walk on two feet with huge muscles.
---
Throw them high in the air and shoot for fireworks they are better than the lame ones that we got at the last game board.
---
I messaged you like an hour ago but I’m not sure If you’ve seen it
---
Contrary to that video, Medics heavies are also magic. Or I get real lucky with my Medics Lmg with no heavy gunner perks. And no, none of my armor is the 15% or whatever blocking to trigger it. Also, firerate is 182.
---
I feel the same way.
---
Don't go to Sugar Grove or RobCo.😎🤓
---
Sometimes the game does not line up the enemies neatly in a row for some arcade action and you have to actually earn the rewards. That's different to when I had one fail because the last enemy before the boss spawned inside a wall...now that's annoying bad luck (and if it's repeated then I label it poor programming/testing)
---
Like your post!  
---
I'm loving that the daily ops difficulty can vary so much (and for different builds). Ive solo-ed an elder run on explosive blood eagles as a heavy power armor. But when I've realised for resiliant robots I'm just going to aim for completion for the daily challenge unless I can get a group.
---
I smell a commie!  Nothing is free for the taking, it always cost someone in the end.
---
When you first start the game look at the score rank on the main screen. If it says 1/1 open the score board and it’ll then show the right rank of 30/100. Then load in and it shouldn’t happen during that play through.
---
Darn I never thought of that and its bloody genius
---
pictures or it didn't happen mac
---
isn't that what the casual team is for?
---
I feel like no one in this subreddit plays on Xbox. Seems like there’s a minimal amount of duped items. I haven’t come across any.
---
lol why does it matter? It's not like other builds cannot one shot everything
---
I'm sorry about your investment, but theyre right. Its worthless past rank 1.
---
Even that 200+ is nothing compared to what you can have with legendary gear. My friend in leather walks around with near 600 carry weight while PA users are limited to 400.
---
It doesn't matter when all you need is like 1k damage to one shot things
---
Have you seen the gatling plasmas fire rate?  It's no where near 200.
---
Damn commies, always wanting something without doing the work!
---
In an interview they stated that crossplay (even cross-save) is technically very difficult to implement. However, it is on their list, but with low priority.
---
It's too easy to buy a mod rather than the plan for the UA itself when theisting is so small and cuts off the name. I examine everything before buying, which of course wouldn't necessarily be needed of the previews actually showed the item rather than a generic plan.
---
Me too.
---
HURRY UP AND BUY
---
Weeks? I guess you play more than I do cuz I'm looking at months.
---
Hate HATE HAAAATE the ones selling the shotgun ammo for 2 caps -_- I refuse to buy it every time
---
It's a little more than a 1/200 chance.
---
I only use them to give rads to my bloodied build.
---
Damn thing is over so fast what difference does it make..
---
by the time the 2 minute timer counts down the progress bar is 3/4 full most of the time..
---
I've thrown and immediately shot a grenade, tagging in events... but I wouldn't be sad if they took that away
---
My vendor is a end game vendor tons of sentials assassins unyielding stuff like that and bloodied weapons of all kinds but heres the funny part too get too my vendor you have too have a jet pack. I'm probably one of the last ppl that know how and build flying camps and underground bases. Plus my camp is totally flying i built it off the cliff near the ammo workshop its like 30ft off the cliff and 20ft above it its a do or die base if you miss the stairs your screwed because its probably a 300 ft drop too the bottom.
---
Yeah there's at least the free states one from the bundle.
---
Just watch angry turtles' vids on this, they are exhaustive.
---
And on further testing this is, in fact, not possible. You need to scrap one Ally to be ale to place another. Are you glitching it in some fashion?
---
I dont expect it to line them up nor do i want it to but when an enemy that you have to kill runs from you in that perfect ai path and faster than you. Thats either bad programming or an even worse decision. And considering bethesdas track record i promise a dog having real feelings of fear in a video game is far less likely than a bug
---
Perk load manager was the only one that I had causing issues. It was updated really quick. You’d have to update your mods if you haven’t already.
---
So, weird info for you
---
Recently, I’ve been working with my harpoon gun, with flechettes. And I’ve found some oddities with its damage. More specifically... It can one shot **players.** Tested non-legendary and legendary versions, no difference. 
---
Only in VATS (which unless you’re at point blank, is a necessity to use this thing) it will one shot everything short of a Scorchbeast, Sheepsquatch, and sometimes Deathclaw. Outside of VATS, the damage constantly bounces to half. Not really sure what’s up with that, just figured you might want to know. I’m unsure if it worked like this before Wastelanders, but I know after Wastelanders it is.
---
The main benefit of an upgraded version would be that it's a clear sign of commitment to keeping the game running and supported. 
---
But then again it took almost 2 years to get to the point where Fallout 76 is considered "stable" now internally. Maybe it would be best for it to remain backwards compatible and hope the new systems at least run it better. They will still have to maintain the current version for old systems which would be doubling the amount of work, probably isn't in the cards anytime soon.
---
Is it worth it??
---
yep, on PS4 the weapon wheel freeze along with stimpack issue are the biggest buzz killers for me.
---
Nice glad to hear your having fun.
---
If you shoot a mole rat in the face with a shotgun, it should die.
---
If you shoot a human in the face with a shotgun, it should die.
---
Mutants and larger, maybe not.
---
I worded it weirdly. What I meant was the magic effect usually activates above 200. It doesn’t necessarily have to be that High for it to work it’s just pretty much guaranteed to work at that fire rate.
---
Its not "challenging" or "fun" its merely an annoyance
---
Just really bad luck, pretty sure there’s only an 80% chance to get a rare reward though.
---
Well you only have 1 rare chance in daily ops per day I think. Last 3 days I have nothing on 3 under 8 min ops.
---
I have a few. For sure the free states as mentioned. I also have a camo bundle for all shotguns I bought in the armor shop a very long time ago.
---
This! Posted a work around the other day
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iz0ccz/psa_possible_work_around_for_score_notification/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Past 3 days I've been getting the common drops, Vally Galleria Signs &amp; Burrow signs &amp; those stupid lights! Nothing rare &amp; they're suppost to have a 60% drop rate on elder
---
Hey, don’t get me! I’m helping you!
---
Yeah, I never used to wear outfits over my armor very much until I got the SS armor which is ugly as sin.
---
Or maybe exclusively is bullshit?
---
Well if you play on PS4, head north of vault 76. The fuel is forever 1 cap.  
---
(All weapons and armour are at level 20 or below. Discount prices reflect this.)
---
I have a gatling plasma that would be magic accept for fire rate and it isn't magic.  The only way to have a magic plasma imo is to also have it be explosive.
---
I'm curious to see if you can get AB rounds. Not that I'll ever need them.
---
Definitely. This is a rare example of how you can be 100% afk and still genuinely contribute to the success of the event.
---
Having people on the drums/spits makes a huge difference.
---
You need 30+ Ag, all sneak perks, all shadowed mods, a harder to detect legendary effect and a fixer stealth bonus to reliably stay hidden from lvl 75+ enemies.
---
You can’t just skate by with a half assed stealth build anymore.
---
I did not say they was not used just hardly ever used.
---
The only flamers you tend to see now are the super rare TSE Flamers that you can not longer get in game since the TSE effect was removed  from the droptable. The TSE Flamer was gamebreaking in power but the standard is fairly lackluster.
---
You do see the odd freeze on the SBQ but i see that coming from Grenades/Mines been tossed once it lands not the Cyro it self.
---
Both weapons could use buffs and i think adding speclist legandary cards could be the way to go. I all so think its not just them that need it weapons like the Fatman/Missile Lancher need help as well.
---
if it wasn't wastelanders then it had to have been when the first "season" started.
---
I'm still pretty sure it was wastelanders tho.
---
Are you sure about that? I’ve had the magic effect work on weapons with a relatively low fire rate. Obviously it’s rather unpredictable and only works every now and then but a Gatling plasma can definitely be magic.
---
I always have a problem more so with hrf and the masses.
---
No problem lol I'll be on earlier tomorrow too I gotta unfuck my sleep schedule. I've placed it for 2 ppl today so it won't be a problem to do it tomorrow if you don't have if by then. Just shoot me a message whenever you're on and If I am I'll stop by and place it
---
I will defintly be looking. I am on ps4.
---
I kinda like blowing up grenades mid air though
---
It's possible there were no drums or spits available when they went AFK.
---
I bet you run What Rads and Ammo Factory
---
Is that possible??
---
You can do that??
---
True that, get the frozen screen every other day or so
---
It's not a huge deal anyway because I have a magic gauss minigun, (that's also vampire's), but it's impossible to keep fed with ammo.
---
No. But this needs to be added if it isn’t a thing lol.
---
Smoked mirelurk filets also grant +30 (except they don't persist in server hop or death)
---
Mystery meat pie is also a good one +20 and 3 endurance.
---
I've sometimes found a lot of ants inside lucky hole mine when I went there for lead ore.
---
another way that works for first members. store ur junk in ur tent and blow urself up with a grenade should be able to pick where u respawn
---
"Fallout 76 is considered "stable" now internally, so they want to focus on making content."
---
That is really not the way he said that, he was saying they have to focus on balancing the release of new content and improving the stability of the game. Really disingenuous way of interpreting that OP
---
pepperoni roll?
---
The new scoreboard has a shotgun skin, but idk if it’s for combat shotgun.
---
Just... Wat? Sorry I don't understand what you are trying to say with your comment. I honestly read it 3 times and have no clue :D 
---
About the first part, yes it is not a melee weapon. Okay so far... But... the enemies are meant to kill with a melee attack so I don't understand your point here? You are saying I can not use a ranged weapon to peeform a melee attack? Why does bashing works then? My point is why the hell is bashin a melee attack put sticking a spinning freaking Shredder into the face of this robot is not? 🤖
---
Yeah the grind is huge with that weapon. I don’t even know if I can be bothered saving up for the plan.
---
GEICO
---
I sold my TSE lmg because I could never get enough ammo for the damn thing
---
Need lots of enemies for those, ive heard morgantown or white springs but dont know for sure.
---
Dude you just saved me hours going forward. I was thinking you can keep going till you get a rare.
---
If you have the resources to spare you can make the vapor nozzle have normal range by removing the long barrel and putting it back on after you log in to have the same range as the normal nozzle.
---
I really wish they had the requirements of the plans in the requirements tab
---
Thanks man I'll add you when I get home I appreciate it
---
To be honest, This is the only event I allow myself to be AFK. But on the other hand, I do the prime meat events. And deliver that, help to clean up the grey rotting goo. And then I go for the drums or the spits.
---
Lol nice.
---
The weapon I already have, that's fine.  It just pretty much can't be my main weapon unless I feel like buying 60k steel from someone.
---
Thanks all, I'll double check my mods are up to date and run it again tonight. Fingers crossed.
---
Mhm with ammo of course. I tried it without ammo as I saw it works in a video from captain noob some time ago. But I think this got fixed because it does not spin without ammo for me =(
---
I shoot my own grenades all the time. Actually only discovered that i could do that a few weeks ago! And yeah I agree you should only be able to target your own.
---
What a shit mission.
---
I have both a 25ffr and explosive. Currently use the explosive because the vampires effect heals you for every enemy you hit and the explosive in perk is pretty good on it due to high weapon damage in itself. But dps-wise, the 25ffr one should be better.
---
damn yes thats what I did!! I feel like an idiot!
---
This, every 15 minutes. Just try and tag as many as you can.
---
I actually like the change. The survival system in this game feels rather unnecessary. It's incredibly easy to get huge stacks of food and water. From there, it just feels like an inconvenience to keep accessing the menus.
---
Same here.  People ask about my 76 hat.
---
One thing of note though: the Grafton hat is a medium shade of gray.  It's not red/white like the Robco one was.
---
Takes stuff to make. Too lazy.
---
Don't forget you can temporarily equip the strong back perk for +40 weight too!
---
Yeah that’s why I probably won’t get it. I’d have to save up for the plan then try to get a good roll then try to constantly keep it fed with ammo. It just seems like a waste of time.
---
Power armor and chassis is weightless when worn, 10 lbs on a chassis in inventory, the only time the armor has it's normal weight is when it is not worn or on a chassis in your inventory.
---
I mean, it's the highest dps heavy in the game, priming it definitely helps.
---
I would wave, if other players weren't already melting its health. You do realize I'm saying all of this because I'm also trying to get a legendary among other active players?
---
I just tend to finish it off in my one shot.
---
You actually get three chances. One for each rank.
---
I keep piling up to 5, so rank one is more than enough, even with Speed Demon and sprinting everywhere. Are you spamming Stims and Chems like a Fiend or something? :P
---
Lol I do run rank 1 what rads. I bet you run max rank survival shortcut... oh wait
---
You can't expect all enemies to run straight towards your weapons otherwise wheres the challenge? Yes it can be annoying to have to chase them down but the DOs are in a closed environment and usually played as a team so it should be far from a game breaker. 
---
On a lighter note don't you think 'Pefect AI path" and' Bad Programming ' are rather contradictory?
---
Yeah I just don’t know if the slight increase in damage is worth the grind.
---
As someone whose running an explosive launcher build I'm enjoying this update. the "buffs" to them are interesting. I wonder if it's intentional or not, you can never tell w/ bethesda. I mostly spent my time in low level areas pre-OW so I can't comment on whether it feels like the damage was increased but the AGL feels like it can hold it's own in daily ops. I would also like more durability or a durability rework for explosive weapons period as they do break really quickly.
---
I stand corrected, it's 40% but it's still a pain getting the same crap on 2 different characters each day.
---
There's a Vault Tec skin, it's the one I use for it combat shotty.
---
I wish they would release black skins for all of the guns tho
---
Yo i kinda want to hear this as a whole song. Lol
---
Good thing we got the repost police here. Clearly, your work is super important. Your cure is worse than the disease. How embarrassing is it that people would rather see reposts than what you have to say? At that point I’d really start reevaluating things if I were you.
---
Also... If you are using one and experiencing lag. Put it the fuck away. Online servers are affected by our mutual decisions. 
---
Would i like to use my new vamps tes?  Fuckin damn straight but i care about u lot. :)
---
You want to play a game? If you have any ranks of gunslinger equipped you have to delete that comment because pistol builds are not to be taken seriously. I can smell the gunslinger on you so the game's already over.
---
"No plans for next-gen enhancements in any form - but will still be playable on next gen with no improvement whatsoever."
---
Again OP extremely disingenuous, what he said in the interview was that "they are not actively pursuing that right now" but "you know as 76 grows in popularity I'm certain that at some point we will be adding i mean minimally, hopefully, visual things and you know the frame rate alone should be a lot better" in reference to next-gen consoles.
---
My main is even leveling multiple times a day and that character is over level 370.
---
Older the past few days while not on my main my alt went from 37 to 75 just from primal cuts in the cranberry bog and ash heap. (The rad scorpions are great for exp)
---
Big stonks with ult plasma cores
---
I once got triple rare rewards, on my sub level 50 character...
---
If you’re a carnivore, night I suggest pepperoni rolls? +60 Carryweight.
---
I’ve had five days in a row with no reward for Elder, then a caged bulbs. I’m pretty sure the rare item ‘None’ has 80% chance drop rate.
---
&gt;I'd make Awareness highlight corpses
---
That would immediately be slotted into every one of my characters. Yes please.
---
I agree. It drives me crazy when people are just standing around and the meat meter is falling... it’s the easiest event, just pick something to do and do it and then... it just works!
---
Does that even fit with the lore though? I can’t say I’ve saw any football related items in any of the previous fallout games(I might be wrong though). So maybe it’s not popular in the fallout universe or maybe it doesn’t even exist.
---
Bingo, you're a full health build so you have no use for Survival Shortcut. Of course you dont get any value from it cause you can just suck the guts from glowing ghouls for survival and there's no consequences. Full health players saying Survival Shortcut is bad is like heavy gunners saying Follow Through is bad, it isn't but it's just that the perk isn't meant for your playstyle, so you don't get to be the judge of how good it is.
---
Yeah but if you get elder on your first run it rolls all 3 chances so it doesn’t matter if you do it in 1 go or separately
---
Even if you guys don’t get your Fps cap unlocked, the game should still run better on the new systems due to the better hardware. Frame drops shouldn’t be as bad for you guys as a result. So that’s something I guess?
---
I could be wrong, but I could have sworn I had seen a football outfit a while back in the atomic shop.
---
Have you tried AA on explosive launchers? I run as explosion-proof as I can w/ fireproof and dense chest piece which negates almost all explosive damage regularly. I can shoot at my feet w/ missiles and grenade launchers without taking damage. Then I got an AA m79 right after OW dropped and promptly killed my bloodied self by shooting at a scorched that was right on top of me. I'm scared of using it now since my playstyle is to essentially run up to the enemy and explode all over them.
---
It is always worked for me.
---
I need to know where this happened
---
I love shooting grenades, it helps me a lot to get fast damage out when I'm spotted (stealth sniper/vat build)
---
Perhaps they could make the FPS “stable” next? Windowed full screen vs full screen is a ridiculous differences. Hell, fps in general even on good hardware is pretty bad.
---
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
---
I suspect it is magic because if you put on a splitter you multiply the fire rate above 200 which is where the magic begins. However due to the very wide spread of this weapon it would be very difficult to use unless you stand right against your target, otherwise the HIT rate is way lower than 200 and magic can’t happen, although the FIRE rate meets the requirement.
---
I wonder if it's related to the "magic" weapons bug. I know it applies to some shotguns where they're still regular outside of vats but will 1-tap most enemies if used in vats.
---
That would be amazing
---
You see, this is something I never understood. Why in the world do people play in windowed mode?
---
That’s the odd thing. Fletchette harpoon guns *can* be magic. But it doesn’t have the right effects for it, even tried it on a non-legendary version.
---
It has a Halloween skin as well.
---
consoles are definitely a bottleneck in performance, the game runs much better on pc
---
Where did you get the 40% from?
---
My understanding is, lowest tier has a 5% chance, middle has a 10% chance, and Elder has a 80% chance.  If you get Elder on the first run the game rolls for all three chances.  So it’s possible to get three rare rewards.  Also possible to get nothing five days in a row.  
---
Then again, maybe I’ve got it all wrong.  I usually have the same terrible luck most people have.
---
Yesterday I made 15k just in ammo selling. But yes, it's a bit slow after the update. I guess I was just at the right server at the right time lol.
---
For me 5.56 still sells but less than it did.  Not much else moves though I did sell some shotgun shells the other night.  I sell all ammo that I do sell for 1 cap except the 2mm EC which I sell for 2 caps.  Not sure if that is ok or not but it does sell at that occasionally.
---
Armor has always been that way.
---
The difference is if you have a bunch of damage bonuses stacked up you get more out of anti armor than the legendary effects that add more damage.
---
So with base damage anti armor by itself is \~30% more damage, junkies is 50%
---
with 160% base damage ant armor is 30% more, junkies is \~32% (160 -&gt; 210)
---
As you stack more damage anti armor doesn't lose efficiency until you start to break certain armor thresholds most weapons don't get to, while other damage bonuses become smaller and smaller factors individually.
---
High damage slow weapons like super sledges and the like can get to the point anti armor is less effective (dealing 300+ damage per hit before sneak/headshots), but most weapons can't.
---
Do people not use the text chat mod on pc anymore? I havnt reinstalled it yet but I’ve been thinking about it. As well as a few others like the perk Loadout mod.
---
You ever see the image on the side of a can of hominy? That.
---
One of the raiders at the Ohio water park, or whatever it is called, was a football player before the bombs dropped.
---
Brickhouse's shotgun skin is for pump shotgun
---
I've noticed that sometimes when I log in it will double book one of my favorite slots, usually it will show that my bloodied laser is favorited and what I'm picking. But it will pull out a different weapon, go into your menu and then unfavorite the weapon it keeps pulling out (Yes, even if you have never favored it before)
---
In the patch notes it said Concentrated Fire: Rank 3 of the Concentrated Fire Perk no longer causes the chance-to-hit in V.A.T.S. to suddenly jump to 95% when using an automatic weapon. As a stealth commando build I never had it just jump to 95% and now it barely even climbs in hit chance and it's hit chance will suddenly drop to oblivion.
---
At the very least it would be nice to have them available in the atom shop.
---
Yeah I just googled it and apparently it exists. Football must not be as popular as baseball in the fallout universe though. There’s tons of baseball stuff but hardly any football themed content.
---
Yeah I know.
---
I get this.  I have a Vampire LMG that I really like but I rarely get to use it due to ammunition issues.
---
Then what’s the point of your entire post complaining about hacked weapons one hitting.
---
Yeah it definitely exists but it must not be very popular compared to baseball
---
Counter point-
---
1. It's not particularly cool
---
2. It definitely looks like a stormtrooper helmet.
---
3. It has a light no brighter than the miner's helmet I picked up at blackwater mine.
---
4. It completes the SS armor look, kind of a mix between stormtrooper and Michelen man.
---
You should probably lay off the Nukashine... and chems... and Pipe.
---
I'm on a Discord &amp; it has a Datamined sheet showing all the rewards &amp; thier drop chance during Daily Ops. I don't know how to share it on here though sadly.
---
The Mothman in "The Path of Enlightenment" is friendly. Interact with him and you get iirc 5% XP-Boost for 1h. 
---
But i you see the Mothman outside this event... run! As long as you be a lowlevel :)
---
And if you run the power patcher card it takes even longerXD
---
I know that but you still get three chances at a reward. Each rank gives you a chance at a reward meaning you can earn a total of 3 per day. Which is the point I was trying to make
---
I run Excavator as well and have 511 in a team:3
---
True
---
No clue on that one, windowed mode people are weird. Windowed fullscreen however is straight up fantastic if you run a duel monitor setup.
---
Stable doesn’t have to mean “perfect”. It could just mean “the amount of fires we have to put out are down to zero”
---
I get you on the missiles/mini-nukes and how much they weigh, I wouldn't be able to store my stock of mini-nukes in my stash even if it was completely empty. I'd happily buy mini-nukes at 20c per but missiles would probably go for 5c.
---
So I’ve been a lone wanderer this whole time and just recently have been joining teams, how do you get more from teams? If you don’t mind me asking!
---
Does it have fake hair hangin off the back of it?
---
Sorry I’m at work &amp; cant check myself
---
Even if they did enable a cross save it would be most likely PS4 to PS5 or Xbone X to SX similar to how borderlands worked. Its pretty rare they let saves shift platforms for most games as it is. I play separate characters/saves on PC and PS4 actually and id settle for just items purchased with atoms working on both since my bethesda account is linked to both anyway.  
---
also, not really trying to do sony's job for them on keeping customers or anything but given how much more popular the PS4 was over Xbone im actually amazed at how many people didnt expect the pre orders to be gone in 0.5 seconds. absurdly idiotic might be a bit of an overstatement and "kind of bad" could work for both of these consoles pre order issues.  Even with that said are any of the day 1 games for either console that big of a deal that people are ready to raise torches and pitchforks over not having it instantly? thats usually when the consoles are most flawed anyway. Remember the 360 launch when people were hanging them from their ceilings just so they wouldnt overheat? Long story short, if youre hopping to a new platform dont expect them to cater to letting you keep progress or purchases as there is no obligation. I didnt get any of the rock band tracks I spent a gazillion dollars on when i swapped from 360 to PS4 nor did I keep progress from any kind of game on a different platform despite owning 3 different copies. dont set hopes too high or youll just stay furious at... whatever
---
Or ultracite ammo...
---
There is the legendary perk card for recharging cores.
---
Today I got two plans for vault 94 stash box in the same run.
---
Wow I feel like I’ve been missing out lol. I’ve repaired so much of my leather armor
---
 [I'm bleeding, making me the victor.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYGxWGduCCQ)
---
That is only for your PA..... and is kinda Meh. You're better off just using Power User.
---
Not working in my experience.
---
Yeah, the no next-gen plan is horrible. If Todd said this game would last into the far future why would you not have a next-gen plan? Why should I continue to pay for atom shop things if you're not even investing in improvements for next gen capabilities?
---
Ight thanks for your time everyone
---
A durability buff or re-work is sorely needed for explosive weapons. As it stands, they all break far too quickly. As someone who runs two shot versions, they break twice as fast, hence why I literally have 4 missile launchers on me at all times lol
---
I don’t know if the buff was intentional, or if it’s actually just a result of the new damage calculation increasing the benefit of two shot. Either way I’m very happy about it and hope it stays.
---
I have server hopped into several worlds where almost the entire server is afk in the event and it can be really difficult to complete. But I just keep server hopping until I land on a server where I can see people participating so it's not that big of a deal. Just go early and scope things out because in my experience there are so many players afk in the event that you may have to server hop several times.
---
How long would it take to punch though them? Would be interesting have a prison in one of the worlds but you'll need some dedicated role playing characters for that and 8 in a private world isn't enough
---
I haven't the rights to see your pictures? 😁
---
my cut-off for 40mm at a vendor is 3c. I'm usually hovering around 20,000 caps so spending a bit extra on them isn't that big of an issue. It's especially disappointing when you see a camp w/ a lot of 40mm, missiles, and mini-nukes all selling for the default price, but that's just too expensive....
---
I feel like that is down to Bethesda "nuking the 50s" especially with Fallout 4. Baseball was a huge American past time back then and quoted as America's favorite (or something like that) by John Henry Eden in Fallout 3. 
---
From what I understand Football wasn't as big as it is now until a few decades after that but I am probably wrong 😎
---
My friend got the inoculation machine thingy and was able to build one for me as well so that's cool. I've gotten elder like 5 times and only twice gotten a crappy rare reward, signs;lights.
---
I miss 3 star drops the most of everything. now I'm lucky I can visit the purveyor twice a week.
---
I would have disagreed with you in the past but then borderlands 2 happened where everyone had the same weapons and grenades and you were fucked if you couldn’t find someone to help you get the good shit
---
Thanks! ill definitely try this next time it happens.
---
Wait til you try to use the ammo converter.
---
Play the game, cowboy
---
Considering grenades and molotovs don't benefit from ammofactory/ammosmith it makes sense that their demand wouldn't change too much. We really need a perk that doubles their crafting amount like chemist or ammosmith.
---
That’s why I run with good doggy
---
If you have mutations with strange in numbers perk that boost The effect of mutations by 25% while in a team
---
Unless you are playing with absolutely anyone because they just melt the legendary enemy as quick as they can. Arseholes
---
Thanks friend.
---
Mhm. Drop or stash your ammo and try again. The shredder doesn't do ANYTHING (except possibly boost magic damage?) UNLESS it's used without ammo. Likewise, your mini will not spin ammo-less unless the shredder mod has been applied. 
---
Idk for sure if this would work on the resilient mobs, but I would be surprised if it didn't. My guess is when you were testing if your gun would spin without ammo, you didn't actually have the mod applied.
---
The removal of the hunger/thirst meter is stupid. It’s not hard to manage at all and adds a level of community to the game; I like going around and giving free food and water to newer players. I’ve always liked the survival-lite aspect of this game and they are slowly taking it all away. This is a bad move.
---
Thanks all the same!
---
It's not a narrative. My information is based on evidence. So easy with the passive aggressive language.
---
You keep talking of situations after the fact. Survival long term didn't get support, true. It certainly started off plenty of support though. They made a whole bloody game mode for pvp. They added invulnerability upon spawn. They added fast travel exit timer so you couldn't slam 1 team member &amp; run. They removed the leaderboard when it was proved unpopular. You unsurprisingly leave that out because it's not convenient to your argument.
---
As I keep saying, PvP. Was. Not. Popular. From. Day. One.
---
We didn't have beta flooded with pvp activity. We didn't have pvp run rampant during launch. Survival servers weren't even close to running at capacity at launch. It wasn't popular at all when people didn't know any better of the issues with it. Lack of support also not relevant for the same reason. 
---
Again conveniently ignored because it doesn't suit your argument.
---
You show me that pvp was popular at these inception point &amp; I have no choice but to yield. I go off the evidence as it is, not as I wish it to be.
---
if your lower then lvl 50 maybe
---
As an explosives user, thank you for selling missiles and mini-nukes for 1 cap. imo, you could probably get away w/ making them a little more expensive but you do you.
---
Why would they knock down survival mode? Is maintaining food and water that hard?
---
Sorry 😪 should be fixed now, forgot to unlock it for anyone 😅
---
The real surprise is somebody bought .44 ammo
---
i fill my machines with nothing but shine, its not my fault you like randomly drinking stuff from strangers
---
I’ve seen this myself, as I have a QE Harpoon with flechettes that I use fairly frequently. In VATS it’s a one shot monster, like you said. Outside of VATS, it’s probably 50-60% as powerful. It seems to get the VATS shotgun benefit, even if it doesn’t have the “magic” effects. 
---
The QE I use has always been really good, but i started noticing this after Wastelanders, just like you said. Seems that update caused all kinds of shenanigans for any weapons that fire in a spread pattern. 
---
I have an explosive dragon on my Berserker alt. I haven’t used him in a bit, but I should check to see if it gets the same benefit in VATS vs without.
---
Haven't come across that.  Did get wrecked at some abandoned cabin on a cliff sorta near that amusement park.  Was some ghost or devil.  My junk is still prob up there in a bag if you want it.  (This was like 3 days ago, but I really have no idea how long your death bag hangs around)
---
I always drop the .38 ammo because I don't use it and didn't think anyone else did and I really didn't think it was worth even giving away.
---
Someone dedicated to have a pistol build even post nerf!
---
I think they’re giving up slowly. But I’m a pessimist so
---
Caesar’s Legion wore Football gear.
---
You only get revolvers? You can still use your rifle. You dont have to be a pistol build.
---
Counter point: I love games where there is no defined end game, where I can wander and have random experiences with the community or do random events. I also like progressing on my own time. Since I hit the wall of daily limits, I've pretty much stopped playing because the game doesn't respect my time. I would love to grind legendaries all day, scrip them, gamble for more, and go out and grind more. But I can't, very quickly I run out of scrip I can gain, so I log out. Then my week becomes logging in, getting my daily scrip, spending my daily scrip, and logging out. Because my goals are unattainable for the day once those limits hit, my stash is only so big so I can't bank more stuff to scrip, which means doing anything else is going to see me wasting items by leaving them behind. 
---
It puts a bad taste in my mouth and when I hit that login screen, my first thought is "what's the point". I can only progress so much towards any goal, it will hardly feel rewarding, then I'm done for the day. If I could approach this at my own pace, I'd be logged in all day every day. Sure I'd run out of goals eventually, but I could easily make more, roll a new toon to use a new build, focus on grinding legendary perks while I'm doing my gear grind, whatever. Instead I'm more likely to find a game that respects my time and what I want to do with it. Sandbox games are great when they give you freedom, but when they intentionally hold you back, it becomes a lot less of a sandbox and more of a daily chore simulator.
---
That doesn't make the complaint less valid or relevant - it just shows that Bethesda have been using crappy engines for years where even the most basic quality of life features are impossible to add. 
---
Having said that, given they design all of their interfaces for consoles, and don't even attempt anything better for PC (just rely on modders), this is more just the usual case of Bethesda extreme laziness.
---
wtf are you on about?
---
That's why I used the qualifier "seems" \^\_\^
---
Yeah I’m not usually on around that time so when I was I thought you know I don’t think we ever settled this.  That being said, I wasn’t around to confirm that the reset happened at 1pm my time so it could be later.  All I know is the SCORE resets at noon and the daily missions reset at 7pm iirc, not sure about Daily Ops but I think 1pm for whatever reason.  And the vendors I believe reset 24 hours from the first sale made to them.  Would be nice if Bethesda would consolidate all these timers as well as the currencies as it makes things a bit confusing at times.
---
I'll keep an eye out while I play. I first encountered her in the little cemetery just north of Morgantown Airport. It took me forever to encounter raider punk and today he wants me to go fight a noxious sheepsquatch, pretty sure I can't do that one alone
---
And ammo. The robot hordes are not particularly hard but they are literally in the way. :)
---
Saw someone spinning right next to the drums... Like WTF dude....
---
The point where he says how frame rate would improve is referring to the improved console specs maintaining the frame rate to 30 with very fewer frame drops. They don’t need to directly “enhance” the game for that.
---
Add another currency for a currency? Pls no more currencies. Just remove the script limit and limit the number of legendaries we can get from Mumble a day, if they must have a time gate.
---
Also, add how many legendary weapons and what star level they are at, and what type (ex. Melee or Gun).
---
Agreed. That's not my point however.
---
My point was that a feature is announced to be coming by Bethesda, that we're getting it soon &amp; seemingly without fail, not long after said announcement, some people post complaining about not having the feature that was just announced to be coming very soon.
---
Already did. Saw one at a camp, looked at the terminal menu for long enough to know I wasn't gonna bother and moved along. I'll make my own 5.56 from junk like a reasonable person
---
lOL
---
I didn't think about it neither until yesterday's daily op, bashing is something I almost forgot even existed :)
---
no
---
Ooooo....fancy. I like it.
---
I'm still using text chat mod but a little motion from Bethesda's side to get atleast something up to industry-standards would be very welcome. Also text chat mod probably entirely depends on donations while an official chat would be supported by the game's sales and microtransactions.
---
Ps4 had maintenance done few days ago and it made my ps4 unprimary so I had to reactivate it as primary to use any games.
---
That would bring down Bethesda servers indefinitely
---
I was selling them for like 5 caps each but honestly I just want them gone more than I want the caps.  And I'd rather they go to someone who will use them, rather than tossing them in the ammo wood-chipper, lol.
---
I don't know, waking up surrounded by a dozen level 100 charred ghouls can be a challenge unless you're prepared.
---
I'm not the original person you were arguing with but i will ask these questions, does your food and water completely deplete twice every 20 minutes? How did you survive eating food and drinking water before survival shortcut? My food and drink wears down about every 30 mins, which is coincidentally every time i get a survival syringe at rank 1, And I always forget I even have them. I have a buddy (bloodied) who also maxed it out and he was pissed and told me to only have rank 1 and that he wasted his perk coins.
---
I already found my waifu. Thanks tho. She was by a river
---
That’s not the problem I’m having, I can still launch games, just not being able to play online, it says “can’t connect to psn”
---
I like it. 👍 What did you use for the pillars?
---
The "County Coroner" (or "Mortician?") Vault Boy illustration for the perk card practically draws itself.
---
I have various builds with the Perk, one Gunslinger yes, but also a Bloodied Commando, a Bloodied Heavy Gunner, and a Junkies Shotgunner. You didn't really answer mine, either, as I'm curious just how many Chems you must be chugging.
---
This game has football under armor
---
You were just talking about a reduced AP cost for pistols..... If anything reduce thier critical AP cost but watch to make sure you dont break it with crit savvy.
---
Very nice. Love the lighting. What is the "tower" pieces on either side making that sliver of light possible?
---
Got 1 as a random drop. I ain't melee but i killed some stuff with it to be honorable to rngesus
---
So, not different from now?
---
I'm still worried when it comes to mods in a multiplayer game and possible bans from mods. I really hope they approve the mods somehow to keep their system from screwing up and banning people accidentally. Maybe I'm just paranoid *shrugs*
---
It works like the bullion items. Once you get the plan, you can earn it from events and from the purveyor. But you cannot trade it.
---
It is off and there's supposed to be a hotfix on Tuesday.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2d9r0zJNbst99qwmLL1zM0/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-pts-news-upcoming-hotfix-and-more

Hahahaha
---
"But that.. . . . . . . 
---
. 
---
......is a story for another day"
---
I always have a hard time finding .45 rounds. Few people ever have any in stock.
---
80% chance of getting uncommon or rare reward. Of that, it’s a 60% chance uncommon and 40% rare. So really it’s 32% chance (.8x40) of getting something off the rare list.
---
gauss shotguns have new regression in latest patch where vats hits deal like 10℅ of the actual damage (it feels like only explosive part of the damage is calculated now). if previously they were meh to use in vats due to constant misses, but at least you could one-shot mobs when it lands. now we still miss a lot plus if it lands there is no damage hehe. 
---
still F76 have a lot of good guns and for now I switched to plasma caster... I don't know why but it rarely misses VATS hit and with instigating midifier it insta-kills most mobs in game via vats headshot.
---
ignoring the point and how it contradicts the idea of "in any form"
---
FOMOs a bitch yo.. 'specially when you MO'd
---
The key here is that they're referring to the internals (ie the server not the client). Essentially they're saying "If we add content now it won't magically break everything else in the server".
---
Don’t change this! The radtoads are using their own offspring as decoys. It’s brutal and awesome and the one defense they have against our unstoppable weapons.
---
Ah, thanks. I see they mention only some enemies will be updated. I hope it's specifically ghouls, they are the ones that are annoying me the most haha
---
My bowl has big glowing letters under it saying Vintage Nuka, and people still drink it... 
---
I warned them...
---
\&gt;*No plans* for next-gen enhancements in any form - but will still be playable on next gen with no improvement whatsoever. (very unfortunate for a live service game.)
---
I couldn't have imagined the truth would be any less enticing than this when I clicked this thread but I should have known...
---
I love that VATS targets these eggs by default. It makes sense from a game's mechanics POV - it's a mine, like like frag mines.
---
However, I think it would be more interesting to rather than just get rid of it, that there is a story reason for why it occurs and a mission for you to update the pipboy to stop targeting them in the future.
---
I’ve been using my legacy explosive flamer to set them on fire for a bit. Makes it easy for teammates to spot them.
---
They're not exactly invisible
---
Because they're using a game engine that is older than most of their players and making next gen upgrades would be an incredible amount of work that would have to shift part of their focus. As a pc player who has an xbox, I wish they would do updates like that but it isn't feasible with the current manpower. I'm hoping the Microsoft acquisition gives them more developers to focus on things like that, or maybe build a new engine lmao
---
When your &lt;20% health build, every time you eat you lose between 5-10% max HP to food rads. That piles up fast. Survival Shortcut cuts this dumbass mechanic out completely. It's one of the most popular cards for low health builds for a reason.
---
You said you want to recharge it...
---
You can take it out and use for gatling laser.
---
Me tho. I have all slots with something except like 1 or 2. I like to have a variety of stock. Junk, ammo, supplies,  outfits, weapons armor
---
There's no extra 'flow' or extra sauce mullet wise. 
---
I like that idea though.
---
tbf the series x was just as messed up for me when I tried to do the same. Had it in my basket on the microsoft store within an hour of pre orders being live and it just errored on me over and over and then was gone.
---
I'll tell ya what.. In between waves of PC, I shot a radtoad egg. Took like 3 shots to even hit it, and i remember the explosion being pretty much nonexistent. What do they even do? 
---
In either case, I never need to shoot at one again
---
Different client systems will have different degrees of stability. I know with the single player games I have had systems where they crash every half of an hour only to upgrade to a new system and have the crashes spaced many hours apart. Updating my system and all of my drivers has occasionally helped too.
---
Part of the issue you have is tank killer only works on rifles and now pistols, you need stabilised which also requires one to be in PA for heavy weapona
---
Maybe it's a region thing. I've NEVER seen anyone AFK in that fashion at all with all the runs I've done with Meat Week. They're always on drums and spits. Sometimes to the point where you can't do them yourself at times.
---
Twice now I’ve received two rare plans upon completing the Daily Op with Elder. So, twice at 32%??   Not sure that’s how it works.
---
It is extremely unlikely that 6 people are afk on spits and drums in a server while you also want to afk. If someone is using it because of the event, just wait until the event is over. There is no excuse not to afk and do something meaningful this event.
---
I want a flux breeder reactor. A little trickle of flux is all I need, not much. Even one every half hour or so would be great. Just enough to keep me in ultracite 2mm without having to constantly farm flux.
---
Improved health bar was causing issues getting to the debrief screen, but it was updated a couple days after the release. I run ops with a few mods no problem.
---
Can you even get meat from player's brahmin?
---
Downvote if you must, but that’s an old laser weapons balance issue, and always has been. Not a One Wasteland issue.
---
Thank you - The steel beams? from the stair section
---
It comes from the Encrytid event. It's not a common outfit, but not super rare as far as I know. The price you paid is higher than I sell it for but I don't think you necessarily paid an exorbitant amount. As long as you like it, it's all good.
---
Ill copypaste my other comment explaining what makes it one of the bestlow health cards.
---
&gt;When your &lt;20% health build, every time you eat you lose between 5-10% max HP to food rads. That piles up fast. Survival Shortcut cuts this dumbass mechanic out completely. It's one of the most popular cards for low health builds for a reason.
---
It's top tier for low health, beyond useless for high health. If you're full health its not for you and you don't even need rank 1.
---
No problem 😁 your camp is amazing and the pictures in the rad storm are great! Love it! Go ahead with this great work mate 👍
---
Thank you! it's just tables lol looks cool though
---
Dupes are abundant on all platforms, maybe not as obvious but definitely there
---
At least Thorn armor is the gold standard for stealth armor.  I don’t even know what Secret Service is supposed to do.  It sucks at stealth and power armor crushes it defensively.
---
Let's just skip all the baby steps and implement a global Auction house already.
---
Or they could just stop producing brain dead ,pg rated events . Meat week doesn’t belong in the fo universe
---
I’ve had to be a bit more careful recently when spamming explosives at my feet, but I think it’s because I’ve been in power armor more. In fact I just killed myself with a missile launcher 5 minutes ago when I was in my power armor.. 
---
I run fireproof 3 and a dense mod normally. As I typed this I got out of my power armor and shot my feet with a missile launcher and grenade launchers about 6 times. No damage at all to myself. Not a scratch. 
---
I’ll have to keep an eye on this more. I wonder what resulted in you dying. Did you have fireproof 3 or a different rank?
---
Looks very cool! I love seeing creative ideas like that. Love the use of the steel pillars too.
---
 Every content that comes to Fallout 76 gets reviewed by Todd personally. 
---
lol
---
I'm probably in the minority here but the thought of Mr. "It just works" reviewing things personally isn't exactly instilling confidence in me.
---
How about reduced AP aaannnnd crit AP cost?
---
Gotcha. Did you put them behind the half walls? Or do you know a trick to attach them on top?
---
Looks awesome man, wish I had this level of creativity
---
Somebody saw one happening at WS.
---
10 ppl all with mics. That needs to happen
---
*hefts vamp FSS +agi buzz blade* waaay ahead of ya :)
---
But, but... if you're not sitting there pressing "A" like a clown for half an hour, you won't be online for as long.  Bethesda can't have that happening now, can it...
---
Sup: imma drummer boy
---
How very enclave of you. Flair checks out. Lol.
---
Unarmed weapons got a slight buff? I went from dealing 2.6k per hit to ~400...
---
lol wow, i knew about the radroach but didnt know about the other one.  good spot!
---
Rolled as bloodied melee against Earl yesterday and tabked him for the majority of the fight. 
---
Only died like 4 times, dropped 7, and mind you I was among the primary damage dealers for that group. (At 20% hp)
---
Then in the same day I was dropped cold by like 6 random enemies who seemed to have successfully circumvented all of my defenses. Once by a legendary Ant even.
---
If I forget to swap off my crafting perks I feel it hard nao.
---
I think its important to remember that these builds were not designed with any intention of us just sitting at near death the entire time.
---
That were meant to grow stronger/ tankier as were closer to death, when we would need it most.
---
And in that regard its totally okay to run at half, 80% or even full health.  
---
Its especially more convincing to get new players to attempt any low health builds if they can ease into it.
---
I wonder if berserkers would wind up being more effective now with armor breaking much more often. Which is again an example of something that's by design meant to empower us as our circumstance becomes more Dire.
---
Clearly it's not intended that we would be running around completely nekkid. Altho...
---
The purchase has t happened yet, it just been announce that they want to buy axe iMac, Microsoft expect the actual purchase to be finalized early to mid 2021 so any of this is t happening anytime soon
---
Got a random drop from Meat week after learning the plan.
---
Thanks man
---
Thank you
---
That's a lot of work for little return, doesn't help plasma cores either.
---
Not that one.
---
There *is* a hunting cap that's presently available that does, though.  Mudflap hat, or something like that.
---
Gotten a few as rewards from the daily ops after learning the plan, havent had one drop yet from a random legendary enemy.
---
Kill everything at whitespring, all the ghouls assaultrons and sentries, then clear westek, then huntersville, then burrows, by then whitspring is respawned. rinse repeat. Squirrel stew or cranberry food, scorchbeast brains all those goodies.
---
I'm wondering when this video was recorded?  There was an interview with some of the devs talking about Wastelanders. It was recorded over a month before that patch was released, but the video wasn't released until the day after the patch, and some of the content mentioned in the video got delayed. Could we have the same thing here?
---
The bag is there until someone finds it or you log off.😎 I have been playing this game for almist 2 years and still discover new places. I have never played ESO and planning to look at it.🤓
---
Just using the two stacked blueprint that allows you to place them anywhere, then delete the ones you don't need
---
That's very kind of you, thanks mate, looking forward your next videos, subscribed 😉😁
---
Makes glowing blood packs, good for drinking :V
---
The Tenderizer itself is worthless.  Most people are not spec'ed for 2h melee, so it ends up being an extremely heavy paperweight.
---
The *plan*, however, is a (very) rare drop from this event and worth a fortune.  This is also the only way you can get Legendary versions of the Tenderizer.
---
Pretty much the entire game. have fun, and welcome back.
---
Helps that pvp is an utter trash experience.
---
They aren't completely separate though.  The Chinese Stealth Armor is both an outfit and armor.  Though as I'm writing this it occurs to me you can't sell it at the vendor anyway.
---
You have an out and choose not to use it. This sounds more like a personal problem. Just switch it off when you enjoy your light PvP. You're consenting by -not- enabling pacifist.
---
Getting the Tenderizer plans is a better drop and allows for getting legendary versions.
---
You can get a plan for the mest tenderizer, if you learn it you then have a chance for legendary ones to drop similar to bear arm and fixer.
---
It is viable, I think its currently top 4 for a melee build, depending what prefix and majors you get. 
---
A normal one is sadly not worth much at the mo, probably get more worth scrapping it
---
I guess I just don't get bothered by such trivial things.
---
Your complaint has been noted, and sent to the relevant department, waste disposal.
---
Okay awesome. Thank you!
---
TSE Gatling Plasma Gang 🤘🏼
---
I think the backside of Grafton High also has a football field, complete with endposts.
---
I mean, the survival aspect isn't difficult to begin with, just rather cumbersome after so many hours.  I definitely welcome this change but I'll likely still stay hydrated and full to gain benefits, like eating grilled radstag for carry weight.
---
You were the one yelling encore, weren’t you!
---
Yes. No one else has posted about that.
---
What level are you?
---
*thatsthejoke.jpg*
---
Cause now damage's patched and nobody one shots other than hackers lol
---
100
---
Just posting this link was going to get a Thumbs Up from me after watching but you even broke it down into bullet points which is impressive, so thank you! Jeff did say eventually visual enhancements "at minimum" would come to Next Gen but also he said the fps will go up as the "new machines are beasts." So not entirely accurate to say No Enhancements though. Honestly I only saw Jeff at QuakeCon2020 and I was disappointed but after seeing/hearing him and his clear passion in this interview I was so impressed. I feel better about 76 and its struggles now that I got to see behind the curtain in this vid. Great Post, great game, very hopeful for future.
---
\*\*I rec an Edit about Next Gen enhancements as half the comments are about that. It is accurate about "No Plans" but the subtext was misleading imho. Still a underrated Post I hope more readers check out. Thx.
---
It's cool not all posts are taken positively. Just a bit tiring seeing the same posts again and again rehashed for no reason. We've all seen them a thousand times. This one is almost word for word and is literally the same title cut in half. So I pointed it out. Didn't mean any harm. Just voicing an opinion.
---
/shrug. It's really not that big of an issue.
---
Not furious, just hopeful it will come. And wont start over on another platform thats all. Destiny 2 got it right and incidently is the reason I am doing it. (along with a confirmed day 1 patch for cyberpunk that increases the resolution and framerate) The launch of series X is the same date as beyond light, its on game pass and my save is ready for me. I wont be able to get my hands on a ps5 until may 2021 and thats unacceptable for me.
---
The Meta build is Dont Cheat this time.
---
I think that changing the food and drinking is ridiculous, theres nearly zero reason to drink and eat now. I could never touch it ever again and it won't negatively effect me.
---
You 100% can. I have 400 ab rounds ill use one time pretending to be spaceman spiff inititiating silly "lose only" pvp. Everyone has a bad hair day
---
sounds like your build and/or gear sucks
---
Which, iirc, still clips through every type of armor I tried to wear with it.
---
Also comes with a very old-style football "helmet" that makes you look like a luchador.  In contrast to the more modern faceguard style of the Raider Scabber Mask.
---
I don't think pistols even need a weight reduction card lol
---
&gt;5% damage per rank of a card is garbage so you should really only be opting for rank 1 cards (10%) for damage. Even before patch 22, you would get more damage from sneak bonuses than from the guerilla or gunslinger cards
---
If anything it's more important now since dmg from other sources has been gimped.
---
&gt;they are actually stronger as pistols than rifles now...
---
I noticed this when I switched my plasma flamer from a rifle to a pistol, why is this?
---
Love this, I remember your previous posts. I think you were also the one to originally tip me off that the pipe revolver has a lower fire rate with pistol grips as opposed to rifle stocks. I have a theory for the launchers: in the past, the +25% boost from two shot only affected the impact damage, and the double damage came from the fact that two projectiles each exploded for full damage. Now, the +25% applies to the explosion damage, and you still get double from two explosions
---
It really does! I hit the drums one event and the meter got a little faster. But when two more people hopped on the drums we completed the event with full score in &lt;4-5 min
---
i didn’t cheat, i did have lots of ammo however, like a lot of other people, please don’t be rude
---
Thanks everyone, hoping I can grab the plans at some point. Appreciate the insight
---
Good riddance to thirst and hunger. Hardcore mode was always an option in other Fallouts but this game forced that utterly unfun mechanic on us no matter what.
---
It’s like my 2nd time getting on since the fix I was a bloodied melee what should I switch to so I don’t get mad when I’m constantly dying 😂
---
Are you on Xbox? That might have been me. Glad you enjoyed.
---
thanks bro, dunno why you got downvoted, also i noticed vermintide 2 is on gamepass now so going to 76 might have to wait a while 😂
---
I’m using all bloodied fixer and ak and secret service armor unyielding
---
This is my first time seeing a post on this topic. Not saying no one else has posted about it, but I am saying not everyone sees every post on this subreddit to care if something has been talked about before.
---
People on the drums is exactly why that happens. Without drummers you can actually fail the event, especially with only a couple people actually contributing.
---
Priceless and worthless
---
Damage scaling stops at 50. 
---
Stealth is effectively disabled in Daily Ops.
---
Rifleman is considered less effective than Commando.
---
But maybe its your weapon, what are you using?
---
Plus, there is a 5000 gold bullion limit, so in times where you aren’t buying things, you cannot convert notes to gold... and when BoS comes out with their plans, you start the daily grind all over again. Collecting only 200 gold a day.
---
People downvote me because I keep it real.
---
I was also here during beta. You'd be lying to yourself to say that PvP was popular during beta or even during launch, well before most the players were even aware that there was a problem with PvP.
---
That's my point. 
---
I agree that a lot was poorly implemented and poorly supported. I'd be a moron to deny that. However, PvP was never popular at inception, when none of these issues were apparent to players. So, it's a little much to think it was the lack of support or poor mechanics when people didn't really show up for PvP in the base game in the first place.
---
You have a problem with shooting a full clip into a wild animal to kill it. 
---
But your ok with eating corpses, jumping like a superhero and floating like a bird, and a gun doing more damage just because your stoned.
---
Yeah, I dont think realism was what they were going for.
---
I love targeting frag mines too. Haha
---
Handmade non legendary 70 dmg. I'm trying to get my hands on an AA fixer or AA handmade. No luck yet.
---
They made Daily Ops super easy for PA builds but sucks if you are stealth thanks to the enemies being able to detect you even in the stealth armor.  They should’ve made a nice rotation where different styles were better suited to make for good variety but with they way they’ve gone I’ve just changed my style to PA with Vamp Ultracite Laser Gatling and I have no trouble.  Can solo my way to Paladin and close to Elder without having a min-max setup.
---
Headshots, then you only need a couple bullets. 
---
If your not using headshots, thats your problem.  Pick up concentrated fire.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
If they're spinning you can usually nudge them away from the event.
---
Ants love them some deathclaw meat.
---
No problem!
---
With no upgrades for next gen there is no way 76 is taking up the limited SSD space.
---
It'd be nice to have a "make this item invisible" paint option for armor, agreed. The SS underarmor is extremely cool-looking; seems a waste to spend art assets on something nobody'll ever see.
---
if it was legit, then you wouldnt have been banned.
---
You either duped yourself, or knowingly assisted to duping.
---
We are not dumb here, we live on the internet, we all know how this works.
---
Just to double check, are you wearing a piece of armor with increased block damage? That would make the fletchette harpoon gun magic regardless of effects on the gun.
---
New update: you can now craft in bulk
---
New bug: super duper only procs a single time for the stack granting a single extra craft.
---
Well fallout is 50s themed
---
Got it should I switch any perks around is bloodied even worth it now
---
What platform are you on?
---
&gt; *No plans for* next-gen enhancements in any form - but will still be playable on next gen with no improvement whatsoever. (very unfortunate for a live service game.)
---
I'll say again what i had said in the the microsoft purchase thread, 76 as served its purpose, ( show they can make a somewhat lucrative live service game to attract investors/buyers)
---
So now that they have been purchased they technically have no reason to expand the budget beyond what it already is (i might be wrong) to upgrade it with next gen features or have it run for years on end really, other than keeping a good image to their playerbase.
---
"I'm gonna pop some Ghouls,
---
Only got 20 caps in my backpack,
---
I'm- I'm- I'm huntin',
---
Lookin' for some armor,
---
This is just some Fasnacht...." 😓
---
That’s a very small sample size. You could do it 1 time and get a rare drop. That doesn’t mean drop chance is 100%
---
I buy stuff that doesn't weight much. bobbleheads, plans, magazines, apparel, ammo. I often end up selling the mags and bobbleheads at a loss. 
---
Oh and junk. I see junk i buy junk. 
---
I also buy any decent weapon or armour i see and send to my alts to store. I got enough gear to start a revolution.
---
You need to own the game on the Bethesda launcher to go on the PTS
---
Not bloodied.
---
No armor, just PA or nothing at all.
---
Ya honestly, now my legacy plasma gatling is ultracite so its that much more broken 😂
---
depends on your build as well. Try not having 20% health. Go for 40%. Then maybe lower it for SBQ and earle.
---
At level 1? Oh aye, rinse &amp; repeat you say 🤣
---
I didn't build a CAMP for quite a while. I didn't see the point.
---
Why did you give someone your flamer to make mods? Why didn't you make them yourself?
---
Seriously everything changed
---
1. We got NPCs and they talk.  Hurray for dialog.
---
2. Starter quests are slightly different. There is now a Wayward quest line. Morgantown Airport got redecorated as well.
---
3. We now have 2 factions. Once you start a quest from the overseer to inncoulate people you will get access to their daily quests. They have a rep system. More rep = better rewards to buy. See #4 for how to get those rewards.
---
4. New currencies in the game. On top of caps, we have treasury notes and gold. We do faction dailies and "!" events to earn treasury bonds. We then turn those treasury bonds in for gold. Gold can then be spent on new stuff from factions. Also another group to buy stuff from but I will let you discover that as you move through the quest line.
---
5. Not sure if this is new for you. We can now all bow before a mole miner who doles out new random legendary items. In bethesda style we grind bad legendaries up into currency (scrip) and the spend that scrip on a random bad legendary. The RNG is the same as it ever was so thats how it feels at least.
---
6. We have a new end boss. We get to nuke an entire region just to clear some rocks and spawn the event. Seriously, I have excavator armor. Isn't that what its for?
---
7. BOS is on its way back. First we all gave tons of materials to a brat kid who gave us all booze in return. Now a certain BOS character is back in town and he gives us daily ops missions to do. These are instanced 4 player quick dungeons with a certain goal. The faster you do it the better the loot. The mobs and some abilities are randomly generated, though limited. Right now the big suck is robots that wont die till you punch 'em in the face.
---
8. Now we have one wasteland. Every mob scales to your level. Everyone can play together, so dont feel bad about being low level among high level. That lvl 40 super mutant for you is level 100 for the person next to you. This also means that no matter what level you are that damn molerat hands you your ass.
---
9. The great balancing has started. They changed damage calculations from multiplicative to additive. This hit bloodied the most, with a roughly 80% decrease in dmg. For the most part meta is still the same, though AA is now better and TSE is maybe back for heavy weapons. Also junkies is maybe something of a new meta for you as well.
---
The Cowboy Hat is an Atom Shop item. Same (I think) for the Clean Skiing Outfit. If you don’t have them unlocked on your account but have them in your inventory, it’s either a glitch or someone found a way around the trade restrictions.
---
Actually, it would make it easier. Statistically with large quantities a 30% chance to craft a duplicate become simple ctafting 30% more pieces. They could do somthing simple like multiplying yhe crafting amount by 1.3 and any fraction becomes a random chance to get extra.
---
E.g. crafting 115 in bulk would mean 115 x 1.3 = 149.5. So we would get 149 pieces with 50% chance to get extra one.
---
This would dramatically ease the server load then spamming crafting one by one.
---
What do you suggest
---
Nah, you'll stay.
---
If having that weapon was the only thing that kept you playing this game, you were due to go anyhow.
---
It's not the weapons that keep you in the game, it's the gameplay.
---
Gotcha thanks for the help
---
why would you do that with a stranger.. surely you could have found someone reliable on the market sub to do it..
---
I been using my pa heavy for this season I thought it was bugged as well until I checked the durability today an saw it went down a lil bit
---
Don't give up, I have lost my favorite weapon before..dropped it or something... you can always find another that you like!😎 Have you tried a shotgun build yet? I love my gauss shotgun.
---
Do Beckett’s quest so you can get a solid AA heavy gun back in your inventory. It’s not the end of the world, you got this.
---
This. 
---
Although it would be quite nice if we could make mods ourselves to be able to trade/sell.
---
really ? well here the ps5 was gone after 10 mins after opening preorders on many stores.  I fell for the big megacoorporation presale of preorder lines. I "preordered" in april this year to guarantee id get one. which means I didnt even try the day it was announced. Turns out that was a mistake so Im mostly pissed at the vendor Ive been using for a long time. 
---
I ordered a series X today and it seems to be able to come. Im in Norway, so it seems like demand for ps5 is way higher than series X here. Well see.
---
i like it more because i get more xp for kills like that, makes levelling less tedious :)
---
But when I look into my atom shop to see what I own, it only shows my postmans outfit and my mountain scout suit, I also can't craft it.
---
I feel bad for all the PC players that can't survive more than 15 seconds in nuclear winter because a guy floating in the sky with a Aimbot is taking everybody out
---
What
---
Ammo. Especially from newer players. 
---
*Sure, I’ll go ahead and take your 3000 .38 ammo. I’ll funnel that into a Fixer and pas it out to other players.*
---
Understood.
---
I’ve experienced more than on glitch/bug in my time here :)
---
Sorry to hear that. As a general rule, just never trust anyone you don’t really know. Even if you do know them, people can be shitty and still steal weapons
---
If you want to be aligned with the current meta, full health junkies.
---
If  there's hints  that the Mojave and Capital Wasteland will be involved if I had to make a  guess I'd say their goal might be to expand on the variety of dungeons available for Daily Ops styled activities by using some of the dungeons from previous games.  Seems a lot more likely than giving us access to the entire maps considering how much more work that would be on top of keeping everything even remotely lore friendly.
---
I worry that the servers explode because of whatever is causing items to drop when bodies despawn. I picked up 72 radscorpion meat, 46 radscorpion eggs, 12 sheepsquatch meat, and 5 legendaries off the floor at one of the primal cut locations.
---
Especially now, being Lvl 100 they can actually kill you while you are accidentally targeting said egg mines. 😒
---
I  run a commando build and ended up with an instigating double barrel that has become my go-to CQB weapon. VATS headshots are lethal to most regular enemies. I’ve been building up my legendary strength perk to in turn beef up my shot gun perks to make it more viable.
---
This sounds like *extreme* social anxiety.  There is nothing normal about that logic.  I'm not trying to insult you.  If you really feel this way I highly recommend getting help.
---
Oof this is too fancy. This like something Mr. House would live in an use as his vacation home.
---
Lol! Falsely. Sure...
---
Most of endurance
---
Yes. I get that. So, as I said, it’s either a glitch or you somehow acquired it from someone that was able to get past the trade restrictions on Atom Shop items.
---
You might have picked them up from a bag and not realized it. 
---
If you’re 100% you didn’t get them from anyone else and they just *poofed* into your inventory, then it’s a bizarre glitch. 
---
What happens if you try to drop them?
---
I just meant in comparison with the previous fallout games. You're the hero in those games. Now you're a mouse. Being squashed by vermin. Not so realistic.
---
High level does not mean they have etiquette or skills or honor or privilege. It just means they have obtained a higher level. 
---
Our expectations of other players shouldn't be based on their level.
---
Starting to wish for an option to hide my character level.
---
Just my opinion!
---
Awesome time to sell all the bloodied stuff I put so much work into 😂
---
“Flamingo unit”, I love the crazy shit people come up with. “Oh yeah, I measure my camp budget in flamingos.”
---
Just stash it for now. These things are cyclical.
---
its your build.  
---
team bonusses are extremly worthy in this game. join a casual team, 99% of the time you're on your own but profit from it. get tenderizer 3 from CHA, some mutations with strange in numbers perk. consider switching to commando and go to a trade subreddit and shop a instigating or furious handmade, max lvl 1 star should cost you about 5k caps.  
---
and get rid of those str perks. bandolier and blocker are great there. if you get trouble with carryweight, shop a higher capacity backpack plan (around 10k caps) and carry less junk or go scrapping it.  
---
    
---
if you are on xbox i can gift you a two shot 25 faster fire rate handmade.
---
I miss survival mode so fucking much. That was my shit
---
lol he would feel right at home :)
---
I love the idea of the pip boy being buggy and needing to be fixed by the protagonist. It’s meta perfection.
---
You don’t have a issue with dying all the time? More xp is cool but I’m already level 190
---
alright
---
Well if you think about it, everyone freaking out and building up their expectations that The Burrows were going to be the mother of all instanced endgame legendary farming dungeons... they were right... sort of... eventually...
---
Disgusting. **BLOCKED**
---
Oh wow! Yesterday i was suffering from dehydration and i came across a machine as well, and started drinking and after 2 drinks i got nukashine. I went and started riding the horse ride that was setup at the players camp while all the colors changed and took photos in photomode.
---
I am very new to the game so sorry if it was anyone on xbox i drank your drinks, I was dying. 😂
---
Note to self: Don't be a greedy cunt and most players machines have the Nukadrink
---
High ROF +Limb Damage is definitely magic
---
Papa Todd looking everything over for us before we get it. Thank Todd.
---
It does just got the plans on my melee.
---
my guild wars account got hacked years ago. They stole all my stuff but the worst thing they did was they deleted my characters. Characters i'd put about 4000 hours in to over 3 years. I really didn't give a fuck about the gear. Everything is replaceable. but the characters couldnt be replaced. I was upset. very upset. And i nearly quit the game. 
---
But i didn't. I made a new character and started again. And put another thousand hours into the game. I remade all my characters the best i could. 
---
And tbh even a god roll AA flamer isn't worth that much. Easily replaceable. Unless it was a legacy. And even then it's still replaceable.. just not as easy. 
---
Always remember. The clothes don't make the man.
---
It is not a coincidence that there is a bear statue 🤓 but I was shocked too while was doing some trading and got mauled.
---
Damn, good call!
---
Were you around for the first big ban hammer?
---
There were paper bags everywhere with thousands to millions of things in them. Bethesda didn't know how to handle it back then, so they just looked at everyones inventory and banned people that had an abnormal number of the same thing. 10,000 nukas = banned, 300k rounds of 556 = banned. People were banned for just picking up a bag of stuff. Most were unbanned after bethesda deleted all but 1 of any item but a good number stayed banned for some reason. At least one other player back said that bethesda had issues with character corruption and has finally chosen to just delete characters and let players start over.
---
Just to clear it up I’m sure he misspoke but you can already buy lunchboxes for 100 bullion
---
Im sad too. Apparently the harpoon gun is more than just a funny looking gun. People say its amazing :( i have many regrets now
---
Was it a drop trade? If it was through the ui he might have scammed, but that's really picking the bottom of the barrel.
---
I hope i get to see Nuka world in some way in 76 even if its not the full map.
---
yes
---
Just go to Angry Turtle's channel on Youtube. He's covered the topic extensively.
---
You don't need a list. He explains very clearly what the criteria it is. It's not a hard concept to grasp so a list is irrelevant because it's self evident what counts.
---
you also get the meat sweats!
---
I will try that once I get back to my camp. I got these back when the game first released so I would not be surprised if so glitch or bug happened.
---
What effects your AA flamer had?
---
Not really, but I can put one together if there's interest.
---
Here's a few tips:
---
* Two-shot and explosive both effectively double the fire rate. Combined, they're not magic.
---
* Beam splitter multiplies fire rate by 5, combined with explosive, it is ×10.
---
* Gauss weapons have built in explosive, so they can run Two-shot and get ×4 fire rate.
---
* Besides lasergun, the only legit commando magic weapon is the Junky(etc) Explosive SMG with Scorchkiller receiver. That receiver is bugged to grant an additional 40% fire rate.
---
Im so looking forward to the cry when they fix that shit
---
Don't let other people touch your babies, so sorry for the loss.
---
Even Fallout 4 was really stable compared to Skyrim. Just with mods the game started to misbehave. And 76? I had few crashes in the first 6 months and then one crash this summer. That's literally all of it. In comparison AC: Odyssey (that I play right now) tends to crash much more, especially when saving game.
---
Blame consoles.  The majority of players are on console where there's already native text messaging and where voice chat is more often preferred.  Bethesda has admitted they don't see it as a priority if it's just for PC players.
---
Oh god. I dont think i could play until monday. Have safe travels wastelander.
---
Ammo
---
Now you have motivation to gain a better heavy.
---
My bad, i read level 70.
---
Have you bought all the power armor plans? Excavator plans from the bot at Camden park, raider plans from the bot at pleasant valley ski resort, plans from the bot at watoga shopping, and X01 plans from manufacturing in the MODUS bunker. 
---
Also donate 6k a week to smiley.
---
yes, you are the only one that thinks that
---
So if you have 15% while blocking armor, it makes ALL shotguns magic, but most deadly in VATS. I've tested that for sure.
---
For heavy guns, you need either faster fire rate or explosive in order to trigger the effect. You need a fire rate over 200, or over 100 if it's explosive. If you combine that with any of the traits you mentioned the weapon is magic.
---
It's not a list, but I hope that helps.
---
Magic weapons. There will be info on youtube
---
I'm going to edit my question and add more detail so people understand what I'm trying to ask. Sorry for being unclear.
---
when I tried to drop it, the normal "this item will be destroyed" thing popped up.
---
i am dying more but not all the time! doesn't being a higher level mean it's harder to level up?
---
This is something I don't get when people complain about how "buggy" this game is and how Bethesda never fixes anything.  We've seen more patches and fixes to this games engine in less than two years than Fallout 4 and Skyrim have probably gotten combined over their lifetimes.
---
Thanks for the tip. Unfortunately I'm on pc. I'm trying to trade a B gauss rifle and INST gauss rifle but no luck yet.
---
Yea just takes more xp
---
That's your problem. The game is no longer balaced around non-legendary weapons. Stop using it.
---
AA won't help against mole rats because they will always have 10 DR
---
Run daily ops over and over until you get a better weapon. One good player can carry you just fine
---
Keep looking and checking vendors.  I keep seeing people put that stuff up for below reasonable prices these days.  I know it’s time consuming, but hop around.  Can’t depend on the purveyor to get you anything decent.  Or try and trade up for a weapon in the marketplace.
---
I know this now, I’m just to trusting lol.
---
Sometimes I see the helmet and the dress go like 5K a piece. 250 is a bargain.
---
No next gen enhancements may make me quit the game ngl.
---
Never give someone weapons/armor you care about. The bright side is now you have a goal to get a better weapon. Great heavy weapons are everywhere in player vendors for pretty cheap.
---
Super Duper annoying
---
Bethesda is moving forward. Being god in other Beth games is terrible game play
---
Console users don't realize what they're missing here, so they don't complain enough. With the perk loadout mod on PC I easily switch between melee, heavy guns, stealth commando, crafting/vendoring and fast-travel.
---
Yes.  I dropped all tenderizers I got from the event, kept all plans.  Didn’t want to learn them because it’ll get thrown into roll pool...
---
God Dammit
---
Because it's a vanity item. It's a cosmetic you can show off as a "I have this much bullion to waste" statement.  All of the SS armors are going to get hidden by whatever outfit you're wearing, but you can always show off the helmet if you wanted to.
---
Exactly lol.  Have one, won’t learn it lol
---
You’re probably right, I’m just pissed at myself really.
---
sadly, market for gauss is quite small, but good luck :)
---
There I've made it a bit more clear. Hopefully, someone understands what I'm trying to ask, I'm not that good with English so it is hard to make it any more clear.
---
Maybe even the Eyebots can be at our camp and scour or scout for enemies and loot?
---
Beat ya to it, did I? :)
---
* Crafting
---
* Purveyor
---
* Daily Ops
---
* Limited time public events
---
This happened to me too. It ran right past me and across the room.
---
Yes i know this, but you didn't answer either of my questions.
---
I have the same issue with the gauss shotgun. It shakes, and won't swap with the previous weapon while in power armor.
---
I say 50/50 in my experience. It worked some of time, but others it did jack shit. At least I can use the projectiles to determine enemy positions.
---
I have gave him my flamer, bc maybe he had mods I didn’t, foolish really. I’m just pissed myself really.
---
Rumor has it that Microesda is gonna tweak damage tables. hold your horse until next Tuesday, then we'll see.
---
No but it was very clever
---
There was one for 76 but I think it was a timed exclusive
---
Didnt know that one! Like, just one small one on top another, then blueprint it?
---
Yea, it was a drop trade.
---
I think the converter is bad, go for the gauss
---
Ye,I hate them ones...I’m always lookin out for just regular hats,but only ever see the ones wit the stupid hair off the back.
---
I’ll have to buy the graft on one I s’pose
---
The workaround to this is to drink another beer of a different type as soon as you’re done fast traveling. Since you can’t have two alcohols active at the same time, the second beer will override all effects of the first.
---
I've yet to find this encounter, but you can bet when I do I am jumping off my couch and thrusting my fist into the air over and over while chanting PIPE IS LIFE! thanks to this community...
---
Its a ripoff
---
With that being said I still bought it since I have nothing else to spend gold on.
---
The built in light is great though.
---
Its not hard at all, I think that's kind of the point.
---
Survival in this game is just a matter of carry weight.
---
Three people on either one is ideal. Someone might correct me, but I believe that it is better to have three people on either drums or spits, than two on one and one on the other. As long as someone on the field is paying attention to picking up messes and putting out fires, the event can get finished shockingly fast.
---
What platform you on PS4. I’ve sort of step back from 76 but if you want an aa e flamer you can have it for nothing don’t need loads of weapons any more
---
Magnifiquè 👏👏
---
*laughs in Deathclaw Wellington*
---
Yeah my experience with series x was weird but maybe it was down to the website being overwhelmed and not stock? But I tried for like 30 minutes of refreshing and then gave up. In UK.
---
Thank you kindly stranger. (Swear i totally envision him when i play. Storytelker for life. Also theres a random encounter with a storyteller. Neither an eye-bot nor is he in PA sadly but i think it's an iota of homage)
---
Good? It's strong af. The problem is both the shotty and pistol are kinda borked in vats, like bows. But you miss a shot, leave and reenter vats. My stealth commando 1 shots wendigos in acp with ZERO shotgun perks.
---
Some people use the text chat mod, enough to have conversations &amp; give notices but not so many that it becomes a hassle just to keep up with the posts. Almost no assholes, too. People who run silos give notice, then we add them to our friends list and join their servers. Now when I log in I join one of their servers instead of joining a random server.
---
Wait i can craft legwndary versions? I only see the base weapon
---
I have bought all the power armour plans (i don't use PA though) except the bullion ones .Smiley is great but its only once a week and i'll have made that money back by the end of the day.
---
Lack of compassion isn't my issue,  my builds are not really optimized either.  I'm a fairly casual player, I don't run junkies or bloodied.  I've got one full-health PA heavy build that does OK, and four more characters where I'm playing 'suboptimal' builds for fun or where I haven't leveled enough to where my perks are optimized for the build. 
---
I understand that One Wasteland changes affects different builds in different ways.  My PA Heavy build still does OK, though I have noticed I'm a lot more cognizant of how many enemies there are when I'm getting swarmed for instance, whereas my auto pistol build (still in low 50 level range and missing some perks) struggles quite a bit more than it used to.
---
Maybe One Wasteland is the issue, perhaps Meat Week is affecting things, maybe there are other factors...I guess that was the question I was asking.  I had just noticed that event participation was down and wondered what people's thoughts on that were.
---
I love it when they hit me with an energy weapon. Laser shots and tesla bolts don't seem to work though, not sure why🤔🤔🙄
---
I had to use doluted radaways and toxic goo to stablize my rads every 15 minutes before, as all non stealth bloodied builds have to. It gets very boring as you can imagine. Since you're a full health player you have no way of knowing what keeping your rads at 80% is like and therefore you shouldn't really be telling me what's good for me and what isn't.
---
I generally use VATS, but you'd still recommend it regardless?
---
I’m on the PS4!
---
i facking love mine. it's wacky and does what it wants a lot of the time but i couldnt go back to any other gun (i do use a vamps shotgun now and then until i make a gauss vamps)
---
Just the normal sized ones, not the small! snap one onto a foundation then another on top and blueprint the two beams. You can so cool stuff with them
---
This is not really a counterpoint.I agree with you.I do not like the system for the same reasons as you.The point I made was if they put no limits on it then it causes other problems and makes a content drought in another way.
---
Google likely?

Team benefits would easily outweigh all of this.
---
Your build is kind off bad no offense, you definitely need stealth and legendary weapons
---
Buy You have been insulted for 1k caps.
---
Jeebus, half the playerbase wants more content and half the playerbase wants all the bugs fixed. Be glad you're getting at least something.
---
Oh wow I had no idea that’s awesome
---
Wish we knew more about whether the new weapons and armor are just going to be generic craftables/drops or if we're going to be heading into new bullion currency territory.  I was thinking of spending my excess bullion buying some more plans and trying my luck with some rolls but if the legendary modules are better saved for a few months...
---
I understand this, but this really is so trivial. Everyone expects everyone to do everything their way. Just let people be. The meter will fill. I participate, but it doesn't bother me.
---
Wait, aren't you the guy that makes the Thermal mods for Minecraft?
---
If you want it it’s your been looking for the right person to give it to. Il be on in a little bit
---
I slacked on doing the Wastelanders story until now mostly, also been gone for a few months. Once I complete the story, how long until I can snag a Gauss Plan from the faction would you say? O.o
---
I make most my caps selling junk but not having a scrap box hinders me. I've never made an Alt, perhaps that may be an answer to my storage problems
---
Haha I also reread it several times. 
---
They do make a good point about the need for both fire spell buffs AND fire dragon nerfs though.
---
Use a headset to talk to people. Some may be in a party and won't hear you. Also put yourself in pacifist mode to prevent accidental hits and kills. Check trash vans and train bins for plans people discard.
---
Yes, hopefully a lesson learned.
---
Everyone reading this: NEVER GIVE YOUR WEAPONS TO ANOTHER PERSON. Assume everyone is a scammer.
---
Server stability has increased a lot since launch. I get disconnected like once a week now, whereas before it was once an hour or two. That's what Bethesda's talking about.
---
I’m lucky that I can just use achievement art on Xbox. Love the Vault Boy.
---
Real talk?  I've gotten two of these plans.  I learned it on my main for the sake of completion, but for the exact same reason as you, I won't have the others learn it.
---
With the recent update.. technically anywhere there are mobs.
---
Sounds great too me.
---
I’d be cool if it could also attack with an occasional laser. Nothing serious, more for fun. And you can change the attack.
---
  In that I‘ve been playing for a long time, got griefed once or twice early on (chased across the map being killed repeatedly by groups of “role players” ).  Being taunted with...shall we say very impolite.... word choices by other “role players“ etc.  
---
Other times, I just got irritated at other players for different reasons. (I’m bored, so I’m continually jumping into your line of fire trying to force a PvP session (or continually flailing me with a melee weapon for the same purpose) 
---
 Didn’t block said players, I server hopped to get away from them, or logged off completely, and came back later.
---
  Point is, I got over (whatever caused the issue),  and I never ran across those players again (or if I did, they never bothered me - so it was a different scenario). 
---
 From that perspective, I have never had the need for a permanent-block against anyone.
---
I did this during faschnact.  I would have people go AFK in my camp, so I'd push them around for fun.  Got one guy down to some scorch to the north in the stream.  Let them kill him and then revived him with a stimpack in the water.  Swimming badge complete.  I love AFK players, its like a whole other event.
---
Umm depends on your capabilities and you speed in which you can kill mobs.   
---
So a little info can help a lot, first are you over 50? Next type of weapon you are using? What build are you aiming for? Carnivore, herbivore, or neither? Armor unyielding or no?  
---
Also I will not be of great help if you are melee as my melle has been shelved for a long time and I have not touched him since patch 22 so not sure on the optimal farming locations.   
---
If you want a quick answer pop as much XP crap as you can cranberries are easy to farm so are squirrels for now. Routes, locations and such I would need that info.
---
I love it. Conserves a lot of ammo and I can farm ammo for my gauss minigun character! It's a no brainer! If you like shotguns you'll be amazed with the power it packs.
---
It is a magic mini so for now it is good.
---
Honestly, that would be solid, I kinda feel bad for you wanting to give this to me. My PSN is Mealdiamond let me know when you’ll be on.
---
I kill a LOT of desthclaws so having the meat on me is no big deal. +5 strength; +8 if I make Wellington. That adds 25 or 40 pounds. (Carnivore mutation with strange in numbers)
---
I’m a carnivore and always run in a team so my carry weight bonus from radstag or Brahmin is +50 pounds. 
---
Rad Ant Lager FTW; adds another +50 and if you drink a different beer before the negative effect kicks in (after fast travel) you’ll lose all effects and not get the debuff. 
---
Aaaand for good measure bufftats for another +3 strength (15 pounds), a strength bobble for +2 strength (10 pounds) and you have a grand total of...
---
190 extra carry weight pounds that will apply to any build or armor
---
TA DAAAA
---
Impressive that you can infer all that from a few posts calling out whiny players like yourself.  I just get tired of all the constant bitching on this subreddit about stupid, petty things.  There are plenty of legitimate complaints you could latch onto instead.
---
This post is a perfect example.  They posted info for players who might not know about it.  If you don't want to join a team or whatever, cool.  But commenting about all the reasons you don't join a team has nothing to do with anything being discussed here.  Good for you I guess?  The post was to educate players about a feature they might not know about.  No one gives a shit that you don't want to be on a team.  No one asked your opinion on teams.
---
&gt; I certainly wont be jumping on this public team crap. 
---
You call it crap but the majority of the player base loves it.  You are the minority here.
---
Your posts also come off angry and disapproving of anyone who *does* like this feature, hence my tone in my comments.  Don't act like a jerk and people won't act that way back.
---
Have you considered the way you act might be the reason you have poor interactions with other players?
---
I’d be interested to see that. I can say I’ve abused it some benefit against a dude muscling in on my workshop... That shit was hilarious.
---
I was heavy build I’m lvl 100 wanted to try a rifle build didn’t like it but scraped all other perks cards and trying to get back from basically nothing
---
Hehe yeah.  I only have one main character (now a shotgun build).  Made the mistake once of learning a plan I now regret and getting the majority of my rolls on that specific weapon :(
---
Definitely, lesson learned.
---
Oh. But don't forget you have to charge it to 99% like the gauss pistol and rifle. But you get used to it.
---
This is a great community and as I’m stepping back mite as well let someone else have fun with it
---
Even worse is the clown at one I did today - constantly coming up and doing the No emote to me and another person who were doing the drums and the spits, going between them. 
---
The event failed because nobody was interested in doing anything except shooting the critters and if Mr No had spent half as long actually doing something constructive instead of thinking he was being smart it might not have.  
---
Here's some news for that person today, Mr know it all, but actually knows nothing, doing the drums and the spits isn't lazy, it's integral to the event.
---
Can you tell I'm still fuming :D
---
You could fighting against the scorch and try to get level 15 guns to drop
---
In your wallet.
---
Pretty sure that’s what I did the first time.
---
On the contrary, this is fairly tame as far as social anxiety goes
---
Did anyone ever think we'd be getting the entire Capital Wasteland map though? I always assumed that (if we even went there) it would just be a small slice of it.
---
I do like to buy stuff from the low level players, but begrudge spending over the odds for stuff I don't need from greedy players, I guess I could start experimenting with different weapons so i can use up various types of ammo.
---
Carnivore mutation+ strange in Numbers perk turns ribeye (or rad stag) into 50lb.
---
Also turns stingwing and death claw steaks into 8 str
---
Party Boy perk turns whisky into 6str
---
Nice. I was about to give him one if he was on pc. Got it as reward from Daily Ops but my character that uses flamers already have a good one.
---
No, stealth shouldn't be affected by being on a team.  It only matters if the enemies can see you.  Also Daily Ops effectively disable stealth.  Something to be aware of.  :)
---
you'll need a pal to help swap stuff over
---
it’s not rare, it’s an uncommon drop from encrypted. You can usually find them for cheap in vendors
---
Hi and welcome!
---
I personally dislike it, and prefer my VE15 combat shotty. But as you can see there are those that love or swear by the gauss shotgun. With legendary ammo factory plus ammosmith ammo itself is a joke item now I mean you get 900 ultracite .50 (5mm), I'm still sitting on 10k 2mm ultracite rounds and 18k 2mm normals so I didn't pay attention to what you get but it is a lot now.   
---
If doing normal 2mm I want to say it is 68ish you get which quite a bit consider how cheap they are to make.
---
:D the game is a blast so far
---
Now do that and then get kicked just after you kill the boss because your team leader is a major griefer.
---
Friendly Fire needs to proc with the fire that actually comes from weapons,  bashing and melee damage.
---
Which brings me to another perk card, Basher...when working as described that card is nothing more than bait for new players. Take it out or make it where u can bash as fast as you can melee with 1h/unarmed weapons.    
---
Max rank Adamantium Skeleton should greatly reduce your stagger chance. Nothing more infuriating than getting staggered at Earl when using a gatling weapon only then to be followed up by the reload bug even though it shows you still have hundreds of rounds in the drum.
---
Hydro Fix and Munchy Resistance need to be combined into 1 card and even then I dont think they'd be used much especially with the changes to Hunger and Thirst coming up.
---
Anti-Epidemic needs to be changed to where using stimpacks has "%" chance to cure diseases on you and nearby teammates.
---
Bodyguards needs to be % based reduced damaged to make it worth max rank, 36 flat D/ER isnt worth the amount of perk points it requires to achieve.
---
Rework Spiritual Healer and make it where you can revive down teammates near you just by using a stimpack yourself, each rank increasing either range or the effectiveness of the healing upon reviving.
---
Intelligence Perks are in a good spot, I wish Makeshift Warrior/Licensed Plumber/Gunsmith all got combined into 1 perk where all weapons in general break slower and are cheaper to repair, instead of separating them.Wrecking Ball needs to be a NW perk and do increased damage to CAMPs there, if its not already.
---
Agility Perks are also pretty good, when working as described anyways. If anything Id combine Dead Man Sprinting and Moving Target to where, while sprinting incoming damage is reduced by % when below % max hp, would be good for Berserker/Bloody Builds.
---
Evasive could be combined with Dodgy to make a Berserker based Perk. For example at rank 1: If your DR is below 150 gain 30% chance to dodge incoming damage. Rank 2: If DR is below 100 gain 50% chance to dodge incoming damage. Rank 3: If DR is below 50 gain 70% chance to dodge incoming damage. This would make Berserker/Chinese Stealth Suit builds viable. Doesnt have to be those scaling numbers but you get the idea.
---
Luck also has a lot of good perks. Maybe rework Junk Shield because like already stated Flat DR is hardly worth anything the points once you hit a certain threshold.Storm Chaser could be useful if it also gave other buffs like AP regen or make it where all your attacks count as a sneak crit when in a storm, regardless of if youre actually sneaking.
---
Yep im a PA user too
---
Daily ops. Specially if you have a strong weapon that conserves ammo
---
Funny you say that, I'm on them right now. I agree though, usually I'm not afk though.
---
I'm not saying how to play the game, but if you're going to make an argument against doing something, at least make the argument make sense.  As being on a public team does not require any social interaction, not wanting to interact socially is not an argument against it.  It's just an excuse to refuse trying something different.
---
The real question is.. does it feel good???
---
depends on how much you play. i absolutely hammered this game and maxed the settler rep very quickly. make sure you always donate the reward for more rep. and look online for random encounter locations that give rep.
---
He you think I can survive daily ops
---
The majority of the players are good people too.
---
they patched a visual glitch that would make it say 95% even when it wasn't 95% I thought. unless the % to hit that you gain per shot was glitching out
---
Should I straight up donate all the gold to settlers too then when I finish?
---
From what I’ve seen they really are
---
I’ve looked that over but there are ones that I know are missing so I assume there’s probably a few I’m not aware of missing as well. Just trying to find them all! Thanks tho 🙏
---
I had one but a bloodied explosive is a lot better.
---
I might need to try that... there is the water right neat meat week and usually some mongrels nearby.
---
Bloodied Gauss shotgun is easy mode for this game. 
---
In Vats you one shot almost anything except for the very top level enemies.
---
You’re basically looking for places that have a lot of enemies. It’s easier to get experience now since every enemy is around your level. No more enemies dropping 18xp when you kill them.  
---
I go to white springs. Kill every ghoul in the golf court along with the houses and the parking lot. 
---
The mole miners at the train station right next to white spring on the right. 
---
I go to Welch and Welch station and kill all the mole miners there. Any blood eagle/moth man cultist camp I encounter. 
---
And my personal favorite. West tek for the super mutants outside and inside.
---
It should still be in the Atom Shop.  Bundled with some blue floral wallpaper, and a yellow one with someone fishing? hunting?
---
Start a group. I have no problems getting people willing to farm it.
---
If you are on pc TZmaps has a nuke map for flux you can mod in game.
---

---
Okay brt
---
Thank you.
---
Most daily ops are going to take at least 5 minutes, which is the time it takes for a bond to form.
---
Junk and ammo
---
There’s being a food build, some of which are ridiculously powerful, especially for PvE, then there’s trying to use it as an insult because the Bethesda dev who thought resilient would be a good idea when melee and gun bashing don’t work properly. You sir, are just being a tosser.
---
I buy them when I see them for 1500 caps. I can resell them all day for that amount.
---
Explosive.. flamer. What? How? BETHSEDA!
---
He said core recharger. There are 4 types of cores, that perk only works on 1. Don’t act like you’re helping and then when he explains why you weren’t, try and argue it
---
No. It still drops after last update. My friend got the drop.
---
My trader trades, so I keep his vendors in good shape. My other characters usually have 1 vendor just offering whatever extras I don't transfer over to my vendor dude. I vend good to God roll legendaries for very reasonable prices. I see this as a service for a hopefully expanding player base. Ammo, consumables, for convenience. Plans cheap unless they are super rare(stimpak diffuser, bear arm, ect) with an emphasis on the rarerer decorations ( tvs, starburst clock, ec) and the stuff you need to do the possum badges. 
---
What to spend it on?  Buying all the above items to resell or use. Ammo for convenience. Any stable flux for sale( with a vaguely reasonable price).Many many assaultron recall cards. The mole miner event will be a good caps sink. Presents for friends who aren't as hardcore.
---
Alright thank you!
---
I am thinking Far Cry and small areas you travel to to do a quest using the instanced technology. Rather than an indoor operation, I imagine an outdoor map.
---
Explosive used to be a legendary effect on energy and flame weapons. Crazy, right?
---
Which is why I dont understand why people want pvp so bad in 76. The gunplay isnt anything we haven't seen before. There's a ton of pvp centric games already that are good and have large player bases. Fallout has never been pvp before. If I'd want to play pvp I'd play it in a stable game that has balance.
---
Recall Cards for encryptid and serum plans to use in trades if I need to dump a lot at once. Best value for its weight.
---
I absolutely love the LMG but the recoil is a bitch it really does need some grips and better barrels. I know it can’t be possible but I would love a sight on the 50cal but I’m guessing it’s impossible plus 50cal could do with some love all it has is prime and heavy barrel. I also use a bloodied pole but sadly only comes with punching mod wish it had a one or two more options
---
I sure will! Thank you!
---
And that is an issue. They want to have melee kills only? They should have the AI use melee only to compensate. Or even better, scrap resilient altogether because melee doesn’t always work and neither does gun bashing.
---
But how is sitting on drums for 3 mins fun? Maybe if it was like rock band and you had to actually do something but no , Bethesda has no idea what people find fun
---
It's not impossible either. There's a current mod on PC called Intraw reborn which pretty much does this.
---
5mm ammo and shotgun shells. 
---
I won’t ever need to buy armor again since I’m using secret service. Unless I see a really good weapon (which I never do) then I’ll stick to the same 6 weapons I’ve been using.
---
They can't change it now. Many of us starting grinding as soon as wastelanders launched, saved enough bullion, and have gotten all the gear we aimed for by now.  You are asking to be exempt from the grind that the rest of us spent countless hours putting in.   That's not gonna happen, nor should it.
---
The bullion grind is a cake walk compared to other stuff in this game.  I have been killing scorched beast queens by the hundreds and not once have I had ultracite calibrated shocks drop.  For T-65 calibrated shocks, it was simple matter of putting in time and effort to get the bullion. It's a grind with a payoff, as opposed to a continual kick in the teeth.
---
Its an ultra rare drop now where before you could just buy it in the bunker.
---
Okay, so is it a trade only item?
---
Fondle holes. They’re a hidden feature.
---
Just basing it off the list, Id say its just missing the 2 Pioneer scouts Dailies.
---
And the 4 added for Wastelanders, 2 @ Crater that rotate, one at Foundation and the last to take pictures for the robot.
---
Cant think of any others atm.
---
Edit: oh and the Biv daily
---
I grew up in an old house that had one of these walls in the dining room, along with brown shag carpet in the living room.  So, for me, the artificial wood panels and the orange shag carpet are extremely nostalgic and comforting for my own CAMP.
---
I largely agree with you, but some areas and enemies are easier to deal with than others. With a melee build, I love areas with Feral Ghouls. They just run up to me, I don't have to chase **them** down.
---
I wouldn't mind it if I could kill them without getting off point, put if I have to get off point to kill them, that's a pass.
---
Hookers and nukashine
---
I just wish we could shout at them. Fus...... RO DAH! And they’re out of our faces.

Mixing it up a bit going from drums to spits and back again, pick up some poop and dead stuff, put out a fire on the way.  I like it as it's usually good at the end, lunchboxes being opened and stuff.  I don't know, maybe I'm just easily pleased.
---
The best place to farm XP starts with you. Lunch boxes, Legendary INT, Leader Bobble, Well Rested, Cranberry Relish to name a few. My INT is 4 but with all of the buffs I stack it is 45 + 135% XP on top of that. Currently the best place to farm XP is Primal Cuts. I'm getting 2.5k for killing a scorpion and 6.5k for killing the end boss. When PC isn't active, chaining Events and killing Super Mutants / Scorched Beasts is a great source of XP. I've been playing for 2 months and I hit Lv346 last night just from stackinf buffs and grinding with friends
---
i personally kept it all. if you donate half thats only 1 lot of smileys gold for 6k and 1 day of handing in treasury notes. not sure how much rep you actually lose though if you keep it all. you may want to look into it.
---
This.  Did this exact thing, ranged brought the health down and I bloody meleed them while spamming stimpacks.
---
Okay back to heavy then. If you have a fast heavy with expo hit up rad rumble try and get so lunchboxes popped up along with well rested and food. You can try without an expo heavy but ammo will become a pain. 
---
Next up is Queen killing in the bog There are 4 mirelurk queens and 1 deathclaw. Go to the farm south of Watoga kill the lurks and the queen in the lower bog area (good spot for cranberries also and brain fungus around there for more int means more xp) 
---
Then head to the sundew area by prime there are 3 possible encounter/events which can spawn either bullshit all the way up to sheepsquatches . if not in the mood to go through the pink forest and take down some scorchbeasts head to the power station north of watoga kill the deathclaw then book it to the quarry 4 lurks to kill plus another queen in the water. From there you can head east past where the prime event is to the park there. It sometimes has a hermit crab and has 4-7 lurks and a queen also if you path right you can have 3 more events/encounters 50% of the time I end up with the yoa guis and a deathclaw). After that hit up bog town it is a lot of exp you have 9-15 super mutants on the non-workshop side and workshop typically but not always has a behemoth and a clutch of super mutants. Also 3-4 spawns normally dogs at the diner. The I head to macs farm 4-6 lurks and a queen plus more berries then off to the steak house for those 3 floating bastards and the mutants there. 
---
Primal cuts is also good right now, guided meditation is hit or miss sometimes you get a lot of enemies sometimes it is just a few it seems. 
---
If you are familiar with the mire there are a few hermit crabs and queens to kill. 
---
Just for an idea I am a heavy gunner also, I use full unyielding and stack all xp buffs I play two hours a day and yesterday in 2 hours I got 15 levels. from doing my circuit along with hitting savage and bog primal cuts and one rad rumble.  I don't expect people to stack like I do as I am over 300% xp gains but that means normal should be able to hit 5 levels at least.
---
Urg
---
Yeah, I don’t buy the overpriced stuff either. But there’s a lot of players with fair prices so it helps me stay below max caps and helps them clear out some inventory.
---
We just want elder. If you arent about doing the op soon and fast disband the team and leave it if you are done with ops. Most understand this. I start a team it usually fills quick, we run it and never see each other again.
---
I read this to the tune of "wouldn't it be nice" in my head, but I also agree it would be nice as hell. I honestly cant wait for camp shelters
---
♩ ♪ ♫ ♬ *Hot Pocket* ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬ ...
---
Why on earth would someone waste 3 perkpoints for 6% extra stimpack heal when you can already pick two perks that increase stimpack heals to a absurd degree and add biomesh on top of it?
---
I think that's OP's point. It doesn't unbalance the game, but it gives a lil' something to the dedicated solo players without making solo the new meta.
---
Ammo, underpriced Gear from Player Vendors. Chems / buffs
---
Santacollectron would be nice. Never selected it
---
Lol, exactly what I got( which is exactly what I wanted for my full health melee build) , but peppered is max damage, and I like the cloud effects.
---
It's also a reason to extend the spoil rate, seriously even with the spoilage rate perk on (at max) I really do think everything spoiles too rapidly
---
The gauss rifle with VATS is fucky since the game came out. That was like... 2 years ago?
---
Never used the new gauss weapons, but if its the same issue as with the gauss rifle, i wouldnt hold my breath
---
Thats too hard
---
I also always do drums while NOT being afk and I inevitably get someone giving me a thumbs down like they think I'm afk.
---
If people start doing drums and spit before the event starts it gives the completion a head start and you can finish in under 5 minutes if enough people are on the drums and spits.
---
Pretty much though Theyre usually a 10-15k cap item nowadays.
---
I guess eggs would’ve been too hard.
---
Same on carrying 4+ missile launchers. It's like we're using one of those irl disposable missile launchers lol.
---
I've got a Fallout 4 one. It's the title screen art, with the power armour in the garage. Had it ages though, so maybe it's not available any more?
---
same here!  I was wondering what in the world was wrong with my left leg.  Not my arms, not my chest piece, not the right leg nearly as much, just that left leg.
---
Your not alone. I would love to be able to host my private server with customizable survival settings.
---
LMAO!
---
If you watched the interview you know that’s not what he meant. He says he knows for some of the remaining bugs it requires the whole team a full year to focus on, therefore will be no content, and with the more stable game status now he rather be focusing on new content. There is still a dedicated team to fix bugs.
---
My husband lives in the mire, at a lake where frogs spawn whenever you do. It's so annoying trying to kill em and just vatsing the eggs. Like why?!
---
I buy and transfer from high level character to my 3 other builds using my son's account. Everything from plans/serums to legendary gear and ammo. Nice head start to a new build.
---
Yeah, I usally go for the stuff that requires you to move around but I wanted to watch some YouTube. I get off drums after event to see what I have then hop back on. First time going kinda afk.
---
Supposedly the Glaive from daily ops is best. Sorry, the new grind commences.
---
It was specifically an AntiArmor grenade launcher. I'd have to get on and test it again though to be sure. I know my bloodied one is fine to shoot at my feet though.
---
I'm still running marine/scout/combat armor so maybe my regular DR was too low to effectively contract the AA effect?
---
&gt; Every content that comes to Fallout 76 gets reviewed by Todd personally.
---
So we can legitimately blame him for half of the new atom shop items being broken?
---
Even with all of that it wouldn't be comparable.
---
I may be wrong, but I think the pump produces fewer pellets than the ~~pump~~ double barrel, which results in overall less damage.
---
I'll be honest, I'm usually AFK for this event. I spawn in a minute or two before the top of the hour, jump onto a drum, then go make a pizza or something.
---
I'm going through a TON of pizzas, you guys.
---
Because it takes more scrap to make and does more damage
---
Thanks but I love my VTU.
---
The double barrel is glitched.  Interaction between 33% vats hit chance and probably a legendary effect on your armor.
---
Just turn in critter chunks and it’s done in 15 seconds
---
Instead of making food, water, and all perks related to them much less useful, Id rather the Hunger/Thirst meter last longer.
---
Drinking a gallon of water and eating 5 servings of meat every 5 minutes is annoying and immersion breaking, but so is making food and water in a survival game optional and unnecessary.
---
This was the only purpose I could think of also. I didn't notice the DR🙄
---
The double barrel is "magic" due to the 33% vats hit chance legendary effect. While the ROF is slower than 200, because it has multiple pellets hitting at once, it trigger the "magic" damage.
---
It was not. I was on PC.
---
1. There isn't an instant way, but if you hold the left stick and D pad down at the same time, it'll scroll a little faster.
---
2. Same.
---
3. Use the triggers and bumpers when the quantity slider is up.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Sliders.. use trigger-top buttons. Scrolling. Tough Luck.
---
I like that idea; make “Good with salt” work the same as “Weapon artisan” and “Fix it good”
---
&gt;I have no problem with people AFKing the event
---
&gt;Also looking for suggestions on how to bump these people out of the event zone
---
Ahaa okay. Thats why it seems like its on cocaine
---
Oh really? I have the combat rifle skin from nuclear winter but nothing for shotty. Maybe I missed it.
---
You wrote pump twice
---
Assault mask you can buy at raider shops
---
Green hood? Idfk
---
Probably *all* the drugs.
---
So i have a god gun?
---
LOL Its the unofficial official measurement unit for building! [Camp Item Budget Cost](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a99nq3Ifs3Y3tb8NeXiP185LA1ca975-wvrw_-Wd_n4/edit#gid=0)
---
I’m pretty sure you can buy the assault gas mask from one of the raider vendors, Sutton I think. I could be wrong though.
---
Those that do try PVP quickly realize that it has no balance whatsoever and common equipment just doesn't cut it against legacy toting Quantum spammers.
---
ffs i did, thanks for pointing that out, i corrected it but left my shameful moment for all to see
---
Imma rename it to cocaine gun
---
Human nature
---
And the best part is it's a feature working as intended. It's  not a bug.
---
I’ve been told that too. Cole seems to have forgotten that.
---
Welcome!
---
Looks like your quad double barrel is magic because of the 33% vats hit chance and your bloodied pump is not magic. If you don’t know what magic means it’s basically a bug/glitch that makes shotguns deal ridiculous damage in vats. The 33% vats chance is one of the few magic inducing effects. If you want/need some more info about magic effects there’s some good YouTube videos about it. Also, I agree with your barrel preference on the pump the long barrel looks ridiculous lol. If you have the station skin you know medium barrel with the suppressor looks amazing.
---
You know those bean bag launchers that some police use?  Imagine that, but with bags of cocaine.
---
Those both sound awesome! I bet the free states one looks cool. Now for the long atom shop wait. Thanks!
---
The combo you can buy from any raider themed train station bot, the green hood on it's own is at least uncommon.  I have found a few in my travels, but not many.
---
ESO is going to next Gen... But not FO76...? Just... Why?
---
Can you join my world
---
I man a drum overnight. Just gotta remember to unequip life saving armor and born survivor LOL
---
Nice! Now i know what to look for whenever it finally comes back, thanks dude!
---
Spit Crew checking in
---
I like the survival tone down. I can hardly get by with the added demand for stimpacks that one wasteland has brought
---
I think a crafting one would be nice, and I think a repair/maintain one would be nice. Something like Armor and weapons are repaired to 150/160/175/200% durability and degrade 50% slower.
---
It would match the vibe of infiltrator, essentially combining multiple perk cards into one, and having rank one be very strong, but still some return on later rank.
---
I know many people have posted about it, and there have been suggestions on how to solve it. Might try checking those threads.
---
TL;DR just hide. Love it
---
Thanks for the info and in the time I've played fallout 76 i haven't once come across a green good or gas mask they were both gifts
---
I like Grafton Steel. Tons of muties.
---
Which used to give an xp buff, but now it just boosts your hp!

211 in 742 hours playing since two weeks after launch. Some people have used xp exploits. I only started working my way through the ranks after I optomized my build by increasing intelligence from 6 to 22 with mutations and explanation bureau
---
We who are about to *life* salute you!
---
I've also noticed about 80+% care only if you dont help while afk.
---
Sidenote why do you prefer spits?
---
I think it's from the mole miner pails they recently added new drops for them so whoever saved up on those have a chance to get the new outfits , camp plans and backpack.
---
Do you run a bashing piece of armour?
---
It is, I don't really care for the other wall papers in the pack. And, well.. 400 atoms. Which, I know isn't really a lot. But, I'm not 1st and can't afford to throw real world money at Todd for a wall paper.
---
4-5 min seems long to me.
---
If the people on the drums get started before the event even starts, the bar will be half full when it begins. I feel like I've got to rush to turn in my primal cuts before the whole thing ends.
---
If you have three people on the drums during the countdown to the event, the event will start at the first meat marker (ie 50% complete).
---
I’ve never seen 3x drums and 3x spits pre-event start, but I’ve done a few of the events where we started at 50% and finished within a minute because we had all drums and spits going, plus a bunch of prime turn-ins.
---
It's a shame one can't tame a Mothman. What be a fun camp companion.
---
Dang that makes three then that's more then what I was expecting. Here's to hoping we get basic colors for all guns as permanent atom shop bundles. It always shocks me how easily they could take everyone's money with simple stuff like that that they never get around to.
---
Then you're the kind of AFKer everyone is happy to have.
---
A tuned build goes a long way. Check out Angry Turtle’s bloodied commando build video for One Wasteland. In part of it, he uses a freshly crafted non legendary pipe rifle in a solo daily ops, and seems to do pretty well. Not Op, but not using clip after clip of ammo either.
---
Ok thanks
---
Tell your friend I can give him a good deal on them. He got any legacies? Lol
---
It does work in real time. You just have to time it correctly. I do it all the time with Pasma Grenades against robots.
---
Well done!  Makes me want to build again.
---
new bug? Hey so I tried Google and haven't found anything. (I'm on Xbox) &amp; every creature is my level? Like everything from ticks to death claws. Idk if there's any suggestions to fix but it sucks 😅
---
Robots don’t work with the mentats since they aren’t alive. So I use the targeting HUD on my PA helmet. It just works somewhat.
---
Doesn't work.
---
The problem I have is that it takes so long for all the players to get loaded into my game that I'll think I can jump on the drums, but someone is actually already there, it just takes 30 seconds for them to show up.
---
Right? As soon as they released matte black and clandestine, I bought them. 
---
I just like black gear 😩
---
STOP. COMPLAINING. ABOUT EACH AND EVERY SH!T!!!
---
Vats targets an egg... so what?!?!
---
If there will be core recharger, it definitely won't recharge ultracite ones. Don't try to use 4 types as excuse while only 2 would be used or you will see complaints why ArmCo doesn't give ultracite ammo as well.
---
Get rid of NW, give us 3 tdm modes. Normal time, ctf and koth. Id pvp then
---
Yeah it’s pretty sweet honestly. If you don’t mind exploiting a bug keep it and keep shredding enemies, otherwise it’s scrip. Not a huge market for magic shotguns. Now, magic heavy guns on the other hand...
---
Will this be your first legacy weapon
---
Probably right! I wasn’t keeping track of the exact time but it was definitely over really fast. First thing i did was dump my cuts then hit the drum
---
Fix ur flipping build!
---
Yup that’s just a carbon copy of the 76 jumpsuit with different lettering
---
Its a reward from the Daily Ops!
---
Because I totally have control over how vats works...
---
That's just what I mean. It was never much of a survival game, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't benefit from becoming one in full. It just needs to be opt-in so that folks who aren't into that side of Fallout aren't alienated.
---
My personal favourite Fallout playthroughs for 4 and NV were both using survival mods, and I had oodles of fun. Survival mechanics just fit perfectly into the post-apoc genre.
---
This is good advice, I'm looking forward to the mole miner event, I know a lot of people don't like it but it suits my lone wanderer style of play. last time around I had just returned to the game and couldn't afford to buy many pails. but did find some good plans.
---
I'm pretty new to trading through reddit and the last couple of weeks have been a learning curve for me,. I quickly found out that caps are worthless for trading and as a result i'm sitting on loads of plans and weapons that i would normaly just put in my vendor.
---
What console?
---
I do make sure to kill queen am much as I can. Usually 3+ times a day. I have noticed I’m using more repair kits lately, but the queen seems to be keeping me supplied.
---
It had definitely changed recently.  I learned two plans in about 8 rifles (and I’m over 30 knows parts) and I’d factor that into unheard of.  Could be the rng gods favoring us, but I’m pretty sure they hate my guts.
---
Pc :D
---
Gonna repeat the reply I just wrote to someone expressing your same sentiments-- 
---
That's just what I mean. It was never much of a survival game, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't benefit from becoming one in full. It just needs to be opt-in so folks who aren't into that side of Fallout aren't alienated.
---
While not expressly supported, I have never yet had any issue with using a suitcase in one of the train stations and private worlds to transfer items among characters. Legacy gear, ammo, plans, etc. I'm not sure that I would trust dropping a loot bag, but using an existing container seems to work fine.
---
That is a valid choice.I never recommend bloody for a couple of reasons.I personally do not like gimmick builds.The second reason is the bloody is a more advanced build and requires a very specific play style.
---
there's a green hood spawn in morgantown. It's on the metal shelves near the tents on the road. If you have the front door of the school to your back head up the road left and you'll come to it.
---
I want that beat boxing eyebot to patrol with me especially.
---
Meat week definitely brings out a few flaws, cooking one by one and the stash, vendor cap, and scrip limit all come to mind.
---
The limit on the above 3 means I have to stop playing once I catch up on all three of be forever overweight. It's no fun wish I could get scrip vouchers or cap vouchers just to keep the game moving. As it is now I get off when I'm full and then by the next day I'm just scriping and selling what I hauled the day before. Used to not be such a bad problem but with daily ops and meat week the legendaries are so plentiful I don't have room to breathe. Haha not a bad problem to have but makes me want to stop playing for a bit hate when games become inventory management games.
---
The not being able to heal has been the Bain of my character’s existence while using my gauss shotgun
---
This. Most teams can get elder first time. After that it’s back to the game or another toon.
---
Are you sure? 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/isfgj4/does_anyone_have_a_list_of_all_the_rare_daily_ops/
---
It is not listed.
---
Yeah not bothered about the bond. If a team starts, I want to get stuck into the ops ASAP.
---
No...but I do have the bash mod for the gun...mostly for durability.  It jumps it by about a third.
---
One vote for yes please 👍
---
While on a team so they can farm the same critter chunks.
---
That would be cool and give us some very varied scenery to visit too
---
lol. My punch bowl is half Nukashine and half whisky.  Got rid of the Nuka cola vending machine because I would always find it cleared out in about a half hours time, once filled.  I assume by someone just for the 15 caps gained by cleaning it out.
---
When I get back to my camp and find my brahmin dead, sure enough, I check my punch bowl and I find it one Nukashine down.  lol
---
It will be thank you.
---
Well whatever they did screwed it up big time on top of the problem that vats has had since the game came out.
---
idk man I rarely have trouble with vats. but I used concentrated fire level 1
---
edit: and have 29 perception without food buffs.
---
FUs(flamingo units) really are the best system of measurement.
---
No worries enjoy it and don’t stand to close when using it lol
---
I’ve always thought that too! I tried so long to replicate it and nothing I did came close. I settled on the Deep Mining Mask and the Treasure Hunter Outfit, which has a similar vibe, though I’d definitely exchange it if that actually came out with that outfit. Especially if they included a backpack
---
Oh wait, my bad. I had the Symptomatic thing in my head as the same thing.
---
Why not both? I run a tank bloody build and it works like a champ.
---
Fusion Cores, I don't have the time to farm thw workshops and I don't mind spending a bit to get some.
---
Yeah I got a full unyeilding of ss .. so many modules used
---
Any chance of doing a YouTube video on how? My husband loves it also and is wondering what the whole thing looks like as well. Nice job.
---
Nobody is doing the primal cuts events, I went through like 10 servers of nobody joining them and then just doing the cookout
---
Sorry , i fell asleep playing and my controller fell on the floor making it do that.
---
I guess . Me personally , I’m ecstatic that bethesda lost the FO ip
---
So i need a two shot fatman so i can have some better silly fun
---
Fallout 76: First mobile game for consoles smfh
---
The worst is when a friend launches a granade and you make it explode before reach the target, and even worst if you do it 3 times in a row. Sorry bro, I just vats and shot, there are other games to be aiming.
---
I was considering it but I’m just not a fan of being below max health 24/7, nothing against people who do use it. maybe my brain is just broken or something and that’s why I don’t like it
---
Yep, I noticed it yesterday when I was going through the skins I have.
---
The question should be, why do I need to drink water when I am neck deep in Super Muties. The Food/Drink aspect should be OPTIONAL.
---
Jumpin catfish!   Indeed.  It is a consideration.  But I think if you have a large enough enclosed area it’ll keep them inside
---
Dude that's bad ass! I hate how they have so many great outfit ideas but so few in game options. Hopefully that changes.
---
!close
---
When are the daily ops gonna stop disconnecting me during the event?
---
Will try do one over the weekend. My other builds [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJyr3Sfd4capexdjxBaTX1g?view\_as=subscriber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJyr3Sfd4capexdjxBaTX1g?view_as=subscriber)
---
Awww how do we get mole miner pales? I didn’t start playing until late may
---
* Me: damned MOLERATS! Eat headshots! *&lt;trigger VATS&gt;*
---
* VATS: Hey - there’s a Radtoad mine way over there! Lookit!
---
* Me: No, not the green mine - the red molerat currently humping my leg and giving me parasites  *&lt;trigger VATS&gt;*
---
* Me: Okay - now lets take out the Mirelurk Queen coming at us.  *&lt;trigger VATS&gt;*
---
* VATS: I;m thinking about Thos mines.
---
Nuke mine. Place it at their feet then shoot it. Have the radiation kill them
---
I think they are going to do that at least I hope they are
---
I run bloodied with emergency protocols and I have never had to repair my PA. I’m level 408 for reference. All pieces still have over 150% durability.
---
If people legit need fasnacht masks I have a ton on my secondary account, literally so much it lags my stash going through it and I'd be happy to give them out. PSN Only: TheInfamousRover is my acc, just hit me up with a message and let me know what masks you want and an offer, I don't have extras of winter man, crazy man, death claw, or raven masks but I have plenty of all the others (jester, goblin, skull, sun, toothy man, gaint, witch, soldier).
---
14 missile launchers though...
---
Nice to see people checking this interview out though I feel sorry for the interviewer who posted this on reddit two days ago where it was mostly ignored.
---
The lack of next gen updates isn't surprising. Their team is almost certainly too small for it w/o it screwing over various other parts of development. We also have no idea if Microsoft will put any further funding beyond their norm once the sale goes through.
---
As far as the game being stable goes, for the most part game breaking bugs are gone and the servers don't crash. That is enough to be considered stable. You have to remember Bethesda doesn't exactly do bug free games. A good chunk of the bugs we have in 76 came from FO4.
---
Will be interesting to see how Daily Ops further evolve. I enjoy what we have so far, but I can see it gettign a bit boring after a month or two. Hopefully the next stage for Ops doesn't take too long to happen into the next year.
---
Curious how much more they can go into building beyond additional content. I'm sure there are minor changes they can do here and there, but the heavy talk makes me wonder if it will be bigger than expected. I would love to see a settlement system personally. Something focused around the are the Overseer is living at would be nice.
---
but you can't even transfer the items to another character of your own!  I did the grind once, but my alt cannot build any of the gold bullion plans I know.
---
Never have I ever, wanted to look like a monster getting out of my power armor.
---
Ab-SO-FREAKIN-AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!
---
HE IS WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS NOW! LOL
---
I've made a habit of when I would logoff I just afk on the drums. One server there was a squad of 4afks (counting me) all in a public events team afking on drums or spits. Seems like the server loved it case like 10 people would be running around killing stuff while all afk tasks were full by us or others
---
I quote, " this dude takes building to a whole new level".
---
I said, maybe he is an architect in real life, lol. He says, maybe....
---
Are you?
---
Second time I've seen this post lol if only we could send tickets in game too
---
When they actually make new ones I guess. It's pretty disappointing they only have one mode with one style.
---
Noted lol.
---
Not that I know of
---
Thanks so much
---
probably never. sneak would make it easy enough to do solo with your eyes closed.
---
No lol that would be cool though ha
---
&gt; Fallout 76 is considered "stable" now internally, so they want to focus on making content. (lol)
---
Its this kind of stuff that that really rubs me the wrong way. The game is by any definition not stable at all and never has been. This is the fucking project lead. 
---
Also [My friends list has been 100% unusably broken for 33 days.](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/43927/kw/43927). Support said to subscribe to that article for updates, yet it has not been updated in two months. So stable.
---
No only non legendary can be crafted.
---
there's a world spawn for it
---
and i have about 10.
---
Bethesda has said that there will be new modes other than uplink next year at some point. Piercing gaze is tied to uplink so until there are new modes, all daily ops are going to have that.
---
Tanks. That's helping me trend toward more involvment that particular event.
---
yeah, in an event with just 1-2 players my vampire's tesla does not seem to cause noticeable lag.  But 3 or 4 players all running tesla's.   Forget about it...
---
It happened to me after the event and did it in 6 something so I’m picking up the ammo and boom I’m in the home screen so I jump back in and join my group but all I got was burrow signs
---
Piercing Gaze is a constant for this particular Daily Op, Uplink.  Eventually, they will add more Daily Ops.  The next one is supposed to be more stealth-oriented, in fact.
---
He mentions that (better frame rate just from the HW) in the interview right before/around the 14min mark.
---
Ah, well, still glad you enjoyed.
---
I've sold one for 7000 caps. Currently have another 2 for sale at 5000 each. Don't know why people will pay that much, but they do.
---
I think bat's count as two handed weapons, so they should be good. There's also a glitch where weapons don't show up on racks sometimes.
---
The next Tresure Hunter Event will be in mid October i think
---
To ne fair: think of everyone in the server. I haven't used mine in months. Just try to be altruistic :)
---
Rare to get from machines, but you can just go get one at the roof of West Tek.
---
I have an explosives character whose always giddy to see that most people selling ammo sell 40mm grenades for 1 cap each. That combined with the Ammo Factory legendary perk finally allows me to use the grenade machinegun in maniacal extents not previously possible.
---
Also great for cloaked Daily Ops missions since i don't have to aim for shit as everything in a 50 feet radius around me just blows up.
---
&gt;September 29th Hotfix Notes
---
* Fixed a bug that allowed Berry Mentats to see enemies under Active Camouflage.
---
Cool, haven't been able to watch it yet, am at work and was toilet posting.
---
Yeah, you'd be fantastic at it. You definitely have a phenomenal brain. Oh just saw your indoor pool. Elegant. Also, wow on turning brick inside out on the modern white w grey edge.
---
Don't really need the exp boost with lunchboxes and levelled enemies
---
Only for newly crafted pails, old ones still have the old plans. Old ones can be traded, new ones cannot. So if anyone is trying to trade you the pails for the new stuff, they're ripping you off.
---
Same. lol
---
Yup.
---
*Has flashbacks of mass learning every weapon plan I could get my hands on not knowing it fucked with my legendary pool*
---
God i hope not. My build cant even get backhanded by a super mutant without dying. I NEED my stealth.
---
most of the time on a private server, so if my husband sees frame rate drop, I'll hear about it, even if he is having mic issues.
---
I'm level 12.  Play around 10 pm mountain standard time on pc
---
That seems fair. And have like a currency exchange in game that has no daily limit. Like Sammy taking scrip and caps but never run out of gb
---
That really sucks the big one.
---
I hate dealing with the market. I decided I needed an explosive flamer last year, pulled the trade, used a courier, everything went perfectly. (Tip you're courier, .556 is good, maybe 10% of caps value of the deal.)  No complaint.
---
But I have friends who are more active, and they are constantly getting pestered for stuff by the people they have traded with in the past. Game time is my time! My time!(goonies ref.)
---
Assault gas mask is a common vendor drop, green hood is a common drop from all the rarer clothing spawn locations in the game. The ones that drop explorer outfits, radstag outfits, fisherman outfits, etc
---
Both have no real value
---
Ye,I wish I had one...
---
I regret not joining up to FO76 in the beginning...if for no other reason then to have that hat in my collection as well.
---
I’ll play with you I’m in central time
---
Welcome! Feel free to add me. I’m mariflute
---
Glad I thought twice. 
---
My original message is a bit jarring but I do want to catch the attention of more "public only" folk who use it notwithstanding consequences 
---
Hope yall continue to enjoy WV
---
I have about 30 now used to have many more I click the machine a few times and then the claw does that shift and wham another pie., I actually just give them to people. Should I actually sell them?
---
Can't stand out in the open anymore like a superhero with bullets plinking of you, though I find a bit of cover or just jetpacking away from danger helps
---
I just always get there late and it's the only thing left to do...
---
This is entirely true - until you have to use exploits to force a fight. Then it becomes griefing because you’re using an exploit to force PvP.
---
Idk if it’s ever been suggested or if Bethesda has mentioned it, but I’d like more customization options for armor. Not so much for paint jobs or skins, but give us an option to have secret service armor look like leather armor for example with the ability to apply whatever skins one owns. So think the cosmetic system for armor in ESO or what Destiny 2’s is now. It would give players a lot more options appearance wise and enable us to use all those armor skins we have unlocked, but don’t use cause they’re for trash armor.
---
Is your collectron locked?  It really should be.  Mine brings me useful stuff every few hours.  If it is unlocked, other players are taking the useful items, and just leaving the bones for you.
---
Agreed. All Enclave operatives should be identifiable by their miniskorts(miniskarts?).
---
Ahhh ok good to know I didn't know that
---
Ive had 2 machines in a row pop before, and like others have said, there's one that spawns on the roof of west tec
---
&gt; Rifles/Shotguns/SMGs: Misc. Tweaks - Condensed into chart below for simplicity
---
Same story as with the Pistols. Minor tweaks to some of the noteworthy damage-boosting mods, but no changes to the standard base damage for these weapons. Changes may be more-or-less inconsequential.
---
&gt; Conclusion
---
The misc. changes to rifles/pistols/1H &amp; 2H melee weapons all appear pretty minor so it's hard to get too excited about them.
---
Re: rifles, 
---
I appreciate your time and effort, but with all due respect, have you actually tested the practical changes for ranged in time to kill / shots to kill? Both at point blank and longer distances especially at max range?
---
 Because based on my testing, the differences are hardly insignificant when it comes to practical gameplay.
---
It’s weird but my testing of rifles so far seems to indicate that damage numbers and legendary effect have way less relevance vs shot placement and distance from target.
---
IE npc x requires x amount of headshots/weakpoint hits or body shots to kill with x weapon as long as each shot reaches a damage threshold which is why the damage drop off at longer ranges can have such a significance in ttk/ shots to kill.
---
I should also note that I only test via ADS and don’t use V.A.T.S. and also I smoke a lot of weed and the chances that I am overlooking some factors and is high(pun intended).
---
Are you sure?  I can never tell what's a feature and what's a bug in this game.  Do you know if it was corrected if it was a bug?  
---
My experiences with Nukashine are exactly what Mr.Thunderbotom describes, every time I have ever downed one. (many times)
---
Haven't had one in a while.  Will drink one when I log on tonight and see if if it's still the same for me or not.
---
Nah, it's intentional. It has its own drop table. I've scrapped about 20 so far since the update and have not noticed any difference. Even if there was a difference, it can all be rng
---
&gt;beneficial 
---
Look at the vendor stash steal glitch, people were losing legacies and god rolls out of vendors and punch bowls. When we figured out how to turn it into a dupe glitch, they disabled that shit for literally weeks.
---
Thank you! Yeah, love the white walls so this camp defo makes a change from the rest. They're cleanest looking ones so it's hard not to use them. I really liked the pool too ha
---
https://youtu.be/sbeocfcoixU
---
Many times when someone leaves before the daily ops starts is because they may have just ran it if you’re joining an almost full team. As for starting it before the bond is full, people don’t really care about it, and whether the bond builds all the way up or not isn’t their priority.
---
Halloween radio
---
Frankly I dont think the system is strong enough, even with speed demon, and having to eat often, I have so much food its insane. My entire 1400 budget usually is just on selling food.
---
To keep you grinding and keep the server populated. It's all a numbers game.
---
Also can be on the table at one violent night-  (Sons of Dane compound?)
---
Been like that the last few meat weeks ive done, i rarely show up to them, mostly because no-one else bothers either
---
Maybe on PC, but it’s still a mess on consoles.
---
Leave him alone you commie maggot! He’s my psychological box!
---
people do buy them tbh. i sold a few for a few k a few times
---
Great, thank you! I'll take a look soon.
---
Personally I think the fridge should freeze spoiling indefinitely, and accept items in bulk (so 10 grilled radroach takes 1 spot, and another 10 yao guai meat takes one spot, think of junk stacking) and let you put item on sale from the vending machine that are frozen to make restaurant camps a thing, so people who like to cook really good buff-food could sell them without worrying about spoiling.
---
And it would provide another trade good.
---
Yea they fly around with cargo bots that carry nuke cards
---
I buy random cool shit from vendors that doesn't seem like it's duped. Latest purchase was a reduced weight instigating assaultron head. I'm always looking for the rarer bugged items but it's not generally what you find in machines. I buy any junk legendaries for scrip if it's 10 caps per scrip or lower, and spend the remaining money at the raider vendor buying vanilla radium rifles to scrap for mods
---
Lol.  Yah.... the one I’m most regretful about is the gauss shotgun.   I had high hopes for it, and as a shotgun build, it disappointed me a little bit.  Misses a lot in vats and I honestly don’t have the patience to tweak my combat style to facilitate it.  Now I get all kinds of gauss shotguns at the purveyor with weak effects.  I NEVER get any other type of shotguns, which I actually use. Lol.   I either traded for what I have or found it in a vendor.  My apologies to those of you who still use and enjoy the gauss, and kudos to you for figuring it out.  It’s just not for me.  I wish I could give them away to people who would actually use them.
---
Wow! This is spectacular!
---
Great to hear they are expanding content for the builders. Maybe expeditions plays a role in that somehow🤔
---
I failed twice this time around. But it’s not really worth it being I’m only missing spicy mod for tendy and tato recipe
---
[https://youtu.be/79i2YKaDjJ4?t=127](https://youtu.be/79i2YKaDjJ4?t=127)
---
Thanks for your input. I’m going to switch it out for the infiltrator perk card.  At least I will use that one once in a while. Might even open up the locked rooms at West Tek when I run through.
---
I will switch my vendors off...for days at a time until I find something to buy. Today I got the imposter sheepsquatch outfit and head.
---
So they opened again with the caps dump. I just buy anything I don't have whatever the price. Check Grahm after every meat cook.
---
Found the red asylum outfit today, just sat there on the bed so that hunt is over. That felt almost religious. It turned out the outfit is real. 
---
Today was the first day in weeks I have played for longer than it takes to do the dailies. Sometimes I will go and get a new pet at the camp, but I feel bad replacing my current one. Currently have Toady who is sweet but ugly.
---
Must be a region thing. I've not seen a drop in numbers. Certainly not significant enough that the event has ever failed.
---
It's unfortunate they think 5 minutes of decent gameplay should be mired of 10 frustrating or boring minutes of "gameplay", it doesn't build nearly as much goodwill and the result is less purchases in the atomic shop and more cynicism.
---
Walk-in with a couple of dress-able mannequins. Visual representation of all the outfits on hangers. Please Beth, I have so many neat outfits, I want to show them all off.
---
Fuck it, I'll take it.
---
Yea damn that’s tough cause you can’t even sell them off. Lol we need a patch that lets us unlearn plans
---
I tried that with super mutants and it didn’t work
---
Thanks for that. : -)
---
The end today was quite funny.

Blood Eagles in Stealth with Yellow direction Markers above their Heads .bwhaaaaaaaaa

Has anyone managed to get a top tier award on any of these OP events solo ?
---
Have not got further than Paladin on any of them.I would love to know how it is even possible.
---
You can only go as quick as the timers on Aplha and Bravo.
---
How does being in a Team make it any quicker ?
---
PLEASE ADD SOME MODS TO THE BLACK POWDER WEAPONS! also paddle ball
---
it seems to kick them off?  Just not as quickly as in FO4.
---
*but also, hey friend...*
---
I'll put one in a machine. Thanks
---
No you BOUGHT and online multiplayer game..the base version.. every mmorpg has micro transactions..even eso and they all have benefits for the services that those people subscribe to. This is the next fallout in the series...it's an mmo soo guess you'll have to wait for the next fallout to come out if you don't want people to be getting microtransactions 🤷‍♂️ pay to win services are always going to exsist whether you like it or not. Again it's a company.
---
That’s why I keep rad ant lager on me
---
I only sell 5.56 and for 1 cap only.
---
Yup, daily limits should be heightened and made into weekly limits at the very least, and would benefit greatly from being account wide so every characters in your account can pull and participate in one single large pool.
---
Only lvl 307 so I don’t have a lot of points to use. All ready maxed the @ammo and have lvl 3 in Luck. The rest are just rank one at the moment.  Using the PA sprinting and I’m not sure what the other one is.
---
That is incredible! That budget tho. Were you able to decorate inside?
---
Problem has been solved, but it was a 25 fast fire rate, plus 1 agility and, 40% bash
---
Thanks very much
---
Psycotats recipe rumor is it doesnt even exist
---
Well i still appreciate you!
---
Just got my hands on an Instigating SS! WOW went from 1050 1270 from a B SS, you are awesome! Thank you for making 2-handed fun ha
---
VATS targeting grenades has gotten me a load of Nuclear Winter kills
---
Well you live in that world now, so you gonn quit the game or what?
---
OH MY GOD THAT WOULD BE AMAZING!! I'm one of those players that loves to cook the good stuff so something like that would be amazing
---
You used to only be able to turn in one at a time, now you can turn them in back to back I guess.
---
The user you linked isn’t Bethesda.
---
On the subject of Power Armor, what makes you think Blood Eagles could have more than 1 suited guy at a time? It doesn’t make much sense since lore wise maintaining power armor and constantly feeding it FCs is a bitch. It makes sense at to why there is usually only 1 per group, probably being used by the leader to keep his subordinates in order, and why they are rare. Sure it’s possible, but highly unlikely.
---
The fire rate thing is a meme. Disproven months ago yet I still see people parroting it. Maybe on consoles with low framerate, but even then it's only slower, not impossible. This bug is just the fallout 4 furious effect erroneously applied to certain effects
---
Thank you! it was defiantly heavy on the budget lol went a bit overboard so there are empty spaces which is a pity! Would love a increase on budget
---
I can't actually afford it just yet... But I think it might be? It has a set effect that heals you and your team for 4HP per sec as long as you're above 60% HP. Which sounds very nice to me :)
---
aren't those vertibots? [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vertibot](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vertibot)
---
Or make the plan trade-able, or the crafted weapon, or the dropped weapon, or something, please. Have it on 2 toons who will never use it, melee dude still grinding.
---
Mine is a gift from a friend.
---
If you familiar with the predator effect it's easier to spot them, but as someone mentioned, while using Tesla, I don't even need to see them to kill them (:
---
My Beckett ur glitched and won’t even come in the house or near his bar.
---
It’s not bad other then the melee robot ones. Being I’m bloodied stealth but seem to be the only one doing melee in my team. All others can be easily done solo. Robots I def don’t do solo lol
---
Im second guessing myself about the camp skin. It may have just been for the pump. Im gonna check when i get home. But the free states one paints the gun blue with a star on it. Thats also my only skin for the 10mm smg. Now if only i could find a skin for my railway rifle.
---
I am mistaken sorry. Read it to fast.
---
I don't care about the XP, I just want to get elder for the day and farm up some ultracite ammo.
---
Hop servers if the people in your server aren’t attending the events. That’s what I do and eventually you’ll get to a server with event-goers
---
Marine Armor literally has a power source in it's back even if the stats are ass in this game, in Fallout 4 that set was the quasi power armor of a true wasteland badass.
---
You are correct. There is a bonus for having either the spits or drums completely staffed. I'm pretty sure it's the equivalent of having a fourth, so it's definitely a noticable difference.
---
So is that singular plan not translated into russian, or...?
---
You, sir or madam, are AFKing the right way. I wish more people knew they could AFK and still contribute to the event.
---
What??? That's sad news for a non gaming headset user. Well, enjoy while it lasts
---
I was hoping the rate updated. The rate is basically the same as armor which forever. I think someone had a document with it figured out and you basically need to scrap 300+ to get the mods. I spend my caps now buying materials to make Radium Rifles. I bought every other vendor plan that I see.
---
Wait this works for people? I entered with them active and it didn't help me one bit.
---
Does explosive bait still work on AFKers?
---
It was a blast at that mask event.
---
They should change Crack Shot into a perk that increases firerate &amp; reload speed of all pistol types by 25/50/75% to give them quick gunslinger feel and increase the mag sizes for automatics across the board.
---
No you get the items right when you kill the boss.
---
Wait, really?  I stopped picking those up since im carrying over 200 on one of my toons...
---
What legendary effects make the heavies magic?
---
I just tested it a minute ago. It's still working just fine.
---
Well i wanna patrol the wasteland as an eyebot
---
Yup. 😂🤣😂
---
Available micro-transactions do not count as a value proposition for a full priced game. Not only that, but you did not compare "servers on" to "servers off". you compared one set of over priced trash to another set of SLIGHTLY lower priced trash. Trash that has no real world value btw. The atoms are pretend. Monopoly money. comparing a made up purchase to another made up purchase is not valid for value propositions, no matter how big the letters are that they slap on there that say "BEST VALUE" 
---
Make a real argument or i will simply ignore you and your nonsense.
---
Nope.  Ran into a similar situation yesterday but everything should be there.  If you hit it at Elder you’ll probably see two new legendaries and a plan if you’re lucky.  They probably threw some floater grenades at you as well.
---
That's going to happen anyway if bethesda releases the animatronic clowns without fixing the dupe. Spoiler alert: they're not going to fix it
---
m8 id look at player venders u can find them at like 500 caps or so
---
Dont worry the grind gets even worse............
---
Once you get the full  SS Plans ,then begins another grind.
---
I am about 200 legendary modules in to trying to get an unyielding SS left leg.
---
So far i have SS Unyielding Chest,Left arm,right arm, Legs i am not even sure they exist.I averaged about 70 Modules a piece for the other pieces.
---
I did 10  Legs alone yesterday.
---
I've gotten crazy lucky I think, got the spec ops outfit and the super reactor in the same run today. got the symptomatic last week and the vault stash. Pretty sure all I need now is the spec ops helmet and war glieve and I'll have all the decent rewards(I think)
---
I bought a friends old account. Loads of guides on opening and running 2 instances of the game if you are on PC. Then just meet in the world and swap gear
---
Man. I don't have any creativity with my C.A.M.Ps at all. :(
---
I did it today solo, got max rank and unlocked 3 plans  for the reward.
---
I got a vault 94 steamer trunk plan so maybe?
---
Nice! This needs to be a spotify playlist!
---
Yeah. I saw you're on Ps4. I'd give you one if you were on pc.
---
don't go over 255 .)
---
There are many outfits that are teased in the atomic shop that are not in game nor is there any confirmation they will be. Just gotta wait it out, good chance it'll be a atom bundle since both piper's and elder maxon's outfit were exclusive to them.
---
Not sure what your style is, but my camp is located on the perch just above the cannibal b&amp;b.  I don’t get attacked very often at all by wasteland creatures.  My problem is that after I started building up there I realized my camp was initially placed in the wrong spot.  I would rather build more up the hill but can only build down it.  Kind of too late to store and replace my camp now too.  Side note: there are no resources up there.  It never gets nuked (I say that now but we’ll see).
---
Yeah - no need to pay more than 500. Average price around 350 ish.
---
I added you 😁
---
Nice. At least I know it's possible.
---
Unyielding Legs do exist then .
---
How long has it took you ?
---
I am ready for giving up on them.
---
I'm just going to dump them the next time I'm on
---
Man, games on the 360 were actual games.  It's like everything I touch on the Xbox One has been a "milk the consumer" simulator with some marketing major who's never played a damn game in their life calling the design shots.  I'm cynical as fuck at this point.
---
Yes! Exactly this!........Mentats for sale! Berry! Mentats! FOR SAAALE!
---
just drink any other alcohol to skip the debuff
---
THANK CHRIST IM NOT THE ONLY ONE
---
These brainless fuckers going into the event to stand around, WHEN THERE ARE AREAS AROUND THE EVENT THAT ALLOW YOU TO CONTRIBUTE AND STILL BE AFK!!!
---
They shoot the hell out of my camp!
---
why is it extended? that's a modification, and as far as i know, nothing drops weapons pre modified. correct me if I'm wrong
---
This isn’t a problem. It’s a preference.
---
I’d rather Bethesda spent time making new stuff and fixing old stuff than something like this. 
---
It doesn’t effect the game the way things are.
---
Same effects so instigating, junkies, stalkers, limb damage, 33% vats, or block on legendary armor. You also need very high fire rate though. Usually close to 200ish but you can do it with less if your frame rate is high and game running well. Explosive rounds also help since it artificially counts as doubling fire rate for magic damage purposes.
---
&gt;STOP. COMPLAINING. ABOUT EACH AND EVERY SH!T!!!
---
I suggest you take your own advice here, dude.
---
I am. Username is the same.
---
I had a player that I watched stand through the whole event in one place attack me after the end because I apparently took too long trading with Grahm 🤣
---
I'm not sure where I got it from tbh....
---
Keep trying man, my camps used to look like airport hangers lol
---
Go to the mountains in savage divide near white springs, they will be there.
---
that was the joke.....
---
You have to served hop I’ve read
---
I would love if they released Mr Handys that fix the CAMP and pick up resources.
---
Since they made a killing with the concept of the Collectron,, which went from hated P2W devil to fan favourite, this time around knowing the various skins and alternative will sell well they can give the basic MrHandy for free/as a reward for something, and then sell the skins on the shop, and still make a lot of money out of all the possible alternatives.
---
The best thing to happen would be if they don't restrict us to either a Handy or a Protectron, but instead let us have one of each at the same time, and record various dialogues interaction for the various Handys vs the various Collectrons.
---
Immagine the possibilities... It'd be truly hilarious.
---
So a junkies explosive +250 reload resistance would be "magic"?
---
Although I'll make the YouTube work, not criticizing! Always appreciate fallout themed playlists and halloween is great!
---
It’s the perk and backpack that don’t stack. Armor and perk or armor and bp does.
---
No those are part of the rewards
---
Damn aight. I’m a really sucker for apparel items in this game and customizing my character and her outfit was one of my favourites from FO4 (other than Maxon’s battlecoat)
---
yes you can, you can even drink it after you've gotten the debuff to skip it
---
Yes it does. You cannot fix partially broken items. The health bar only shows if at 100% or partially damaged. If it's actually broke it disappears. If you have a lot of partially damaged items in your camp and it took a long time placing your CAMP just right, you end up just seeing all these damage bars every time you move around your CAMP. It's beyond distracting.
---
I use toxic goo for rad management.
---
I've been having a similar experience with crashing. The shutdown crashes are once in long time, but there's definitely been more regular crashes since this update.
---
I'd like to see some super mutants in PA parts. Not the full frame, but those brutes are already large enough to wear the armor parts without the frame.  Could be fun to fight some "Heavy Muties"
---
Its rare for solo players as they have to get lucky to even complete Encryptid. I spent 6000 caps on the full oufit today because I had 27,000 caps and nothing to spend it on.
---
So yeah you can get a good price. And there are so many solo players.
---
Weird, didn't work for me.
---
Junkies, stalkers, medics(people say medics is fixed but I still have a magic medic shotgun so idk maybe fixed for heavies) Limb damage, 33% vats chance, bashing damage. I’m pretty sure there’s a couple more I’m missing but with heavy guns you need a high fire rate preferably over 200 for the magic to happen so it’s only for LMGs, Gatling lasers and in some cases Gatling plasmas. I’ve personally never used a magic heavy weapon because it’s hard to get the 25% faster fire rate with a magic inducing effect but I’ve seen some YouTube videos and it’s absolutely insane, melting SBQ in literally seconds.
---
Yeah - he's a total loser.
---
You have to get the right legendary set on it all........i think.
---
Only kit i am impressed with is the T65 power Armour,Decent radiation resistance.on it.
---
I like to bring the scorch to the player. I attack all scorch I can find and let them follow me. I lead them to the afk and then I stealth and watch the show.
---
I may not attend every primal cuts, but when I do, I bring 4 shotguns...
---
Ok thanks!
---
Only crashed or unusable ones in the airport. The rest flying around are autonomous versions.
---
That's a total bummer! I hope you'll be able to do really cool things with the camp bunker dodad.
---
i can give you a free marsupial, chief.
---
i usually sell them for 250.
---
Same here
---
Alright thanks, my problem is that I have too many legendaries in my inventory I really should just sell some in a machine since you can only scrap so many a day
---
if you need to farm lots of milk, the farm workshop in the forest is great, pick a whole bunch of the razorgrain, use it to create the brahmin pens, milk the brahmins, kill them and repair for a new milk-able brahmin
---
I mean, bethesda has pretty openly endorsed cheating at this point. People got """banned""" for one week and then had their accounts with beam splitter .50 cals/handmades, dozens of duped bloodied explosive gatling plasmas, millions of leadership bobbleheads/nuka quantums, and 3* unyielding wedding rings unbanned. You can fuck this game as hard as you want and they will let you keep at it. They will even reward you by releasing more content that prioritizes cheaters. Have you seen the animatronic clowns and new backpacks yet? They're not scheduled to release until the next treasure hunter event, but people who duped thousands of mole miner pails can get them early. Just another gift for the cheaters of this game. So while my personal stance would be asking you not to do it, bethesda seems really intent on getting as much cheating as possible into the game. I'd love that idea to be proven wrong but have yet to see a single official action in any way denouncing it
---
Yes I see this all the time in raider vendors.  It’s abundant
---
Bought for 1k, was at Max caps so why not. They need to boost those limits 30k is not that much realy 50 or 60 would be nice.
---
Perforating is 40% armor penetration and 20% action point cost increase.
---
Piercing is 20% armor penetration, 15% reload speed increase and 10% action point cost increase.
---
Stinging is 20% armor penetration, 25% ammo capacity increase and 10% action point cost increase.
---
Swift is 5% action point cost reduction, 25% ammo capacity increase and 15% reload speed increase.
---
Hahaha.
---
Yeah, like... Give us five points a card not TWO per rank it is. That’s insanity.
---
That means every five levels you get 10 points, and a perk pack that’ll give you 8 more. And if you’re a very high level, it’ll take hundreds and hundreds of hours to rank these up very high.
---
Probably a ripper too. If anyone needs one (PC) I'll build it for you.
---
Being afk lasts like 10 or 5minutes for me why the rubber band someone just going on a 7 minutes drive or somthing?
---
Grates me with that dialogue line.
---
" I will do anything for you Beckett"
---
" Anything Huh ?"
---
Becket is a sexual predator.
---
Congratulations on the find.  That:'s one grind I haven't done yet. spent the last couple of weeks hunting down the civil war costume plans.
---
Why you getting down voted 🤣
---
You can also use symbols if you think using AA is visually unappealing like I do.
---
They don't call him Slick for nothin'
---
it’s a skin for the backpacks rather than crafting it’s own thing
---
Defo man, looking forward to the bunker, also can't wait to unlock the glass set from the scoreboard
---
Yeah I appreciate it it took along time so I hope someone would like it
---
its a shame pet deathclaws don't produce eggs over time so you're not reliant on item spawns and the nest rarely having them
---
Last meat week event I experienced the 3 on drums and 3 on spits for the entire 2 minute count down (a few times) and the event started with the bar almost maxed out.  I think it took less then 1 minute to complete the entire event after the counter.  One event was so quick that I couldn't even cash in my meat for scrip before the event ended (the animation to get off the drums took too long, lol).
---
Would love to be able to do this.
---
Have not got remotely close solo.
---
Paladin is an effort.
---
Can i ask are you doing it in record time in power Armour ?
---
Thanks in advance.
---
You need to apply them to a backpack. If it’s been a long time since you played go to an armor work bench and modify
---
What gun is it?
---
I've unlocked 43/45 . Most insane thing I ever got involved in.
---
What i don't understand is why this should bother you.
---
Folks paid for the game, they are entitled to play Fallout 76 as they see fit and they don't need to come up with any valid reasons to defend their playstyle.
---
Maybe it's social anxiety, maybe they want to treat this game as the next single player title in the franchise, maybe they cannot be arsed to communicate with other people because of a previously lousy experience, i don't know and it shouldn't matter to you or me.
---
And that's the last time i'm going to reply because i have a feeling we are going to run in circles if this conversation continues.
---
Cheers!
---
Rewards are not tastey enough to justify going, moo moo outfit and scrip are lame rewards...Id rather launch a nuke and hang out with Earle
---
Storage could probably only be increased at a margin, and with higher server useage, so the people that pay benefit from the extra space while the peasants get what they can afford.
---
I agree with you about disliking it.  Personal preference of course, there are loooooots of people who love it
---
I'd also love a serum section, I cba travelling round camps looking for a scaly skin serum just to see someone selling 800 med x for 1000 each. Sick
---
I don't understand, I used to craft them from the backpack menu but now those options are gone, is there some other way to make them now?
---
I feel ya, I've been wanting the helmeted cage armor since the start of the game.
---
No it just bugs you as a person. It doesn’t actually effect the game or the performance. 
---
And I’ve spent hours and hours building my camp and placing everything just so. It’s not one of those big worded empty boxes. 
---
So again, since it doesn’t effect the game or stability as far as we know. I’d rather they didn’t their time better.
---
You know you always have the power to master your own emotions.
---
And yes you can fix partially broken things. Remove and replace them if your need to be so anal about having a perfect camp isn’t something you want to make an effort for yourself.
---
how?  Ithought you only needed to sit on the drum for a split second just to start the event
---
Oooooohhhhh, thanks
---
If you want to waste materials to keep your stuff in tip top shape then just scrap and rebuild it, because you are going to waste the same amount of materials in the long run on your obsessive condition bar thing.
---
It’s the real end game content. As silly as it is, I run out of adhesive more than anything.
---
you craft a regular backpack, then go into modify it and add the skin
---
ah yes. i keep forgetting about pc. ha
---
As a heavy melee build I am still stumbling around with my 2 star bloodied swing speed war drum. 
---
I can't even complain about rng in ops. Every elder run has given me one unique plan and once two. So I have been super lucky.
---
Just no war glaive yet!
---
My two clients idle the drums like good bingo boys
---
I agree. I really like the vault jumpsuits but for gameplay reasons, gotta cover it up. Sucks.
---
You know how fighter jets can release chaff to distract incoming missiles? Radtoads developed a similar skill with their eggs.
---
I don't understand why half the time I join an ops team and the others don't run an op? I join the team, start the op. I stand in there and wait a minute or so (before the timer triggers). I throw up the follow me emote a couple of times, wait another minute. Crickets.
---
If you're in an ops team, run the op! Smash elder then leave if you want or stay and help others get elder. It's not a casual team, you shouldn't be napping at your camp or listening to ward bitch about his water cooled bone saw. Rant over.
---
So far this is the only item that is not translated after update. Before that we got Red Menace PA skin which wasn't translated aswell but I just renamed my PA pieces...
---
Pipe is life
---
They can do both you know? How hard is it to remove this? Not hard at all. 
---
Explain to me how you use it? It is not useful in any way, not one. Can you use it to find stuff that needs to be repaired and fix it? No. Can you use it to identify items completely broke that you can fix in CAMP? No. 
---
It is not hard to remove this element and in no way does your comment make any sense. Explain it to me like I'm 5 because removing this would be so easy for the team and I don't see how that would distract from other bugs (still not fixed since beta) or making new CAMP items which they are doing. 
---
And if you think they can't do this and it's issues like this are why there's still bugs since beta that haven't been fixed, I doubt you'll have a competent answer for me. Also, if you think this would be hard to remove from a dev perspective I find it laughable.
---
I support this post 100%
---
Hope to see you in the wasteland soon friend! I’ll accept that request as soon as I’m able to hop back on!
---
I... completely forgot about this since the int is better 99% of the time than that stat. Thanks for the reminder that it exists!
---
You can still be efficient at killing things without being an ass and denying people tags. A few seconds for people to get credit goes a long way towards making the event experience better overall.
---
I came here to see if other people were noticing this a lot too. There were at least 6 people AFK at the event in my server and we FAILED the event?! 
---
I agree, please at least go on the drums/spit :(
---
Just made a post about my Camp Beckett doing similar.
---
Soon as i start swapping my Perks for Ammo/Super Duper to craft Ammo, he knows and goes straight to the Bench to stand there for a few minutes.
---
I swap my Perks for Fix it Good,Off Beckett trots to the Armour Work Bench to Hog it.
---
Oh really? I appreciate it!
---
That's what my old main's looked like. My new character  has a small box for crafting stations and the steel bungalo. Lol
---
It's a joke.  But sadly a joke that has the good possibility of happening.  No Fun Allowed, after all.
---
Awesome, thanks
---
Upvoted
---
I thought that might've been the case! I did the same thing is why I asked. Don't feel bad! I think it's an honest mistake.
---
They'll occasionally come with mods if you have them unlocked.
---
I am. I'ma a Bloodied Commando build but spec'd into Electric Absorption so I could run in PA and got lucky to get a 3* vampire explosive handmade my first DO. Pretty much just stand there and tank then on to the next booster.
---
The legacy mask is the mask you would earn through the Vault 94 raid. They removed the ghillie from the mask. So it has an camo pattern on it.
---
Awesome
---
Bumping because yeah, that’d be cool.
---
They have limited time, resources and people. You have no idea what’s involved. So your reply about it being easy is just selfishness. But you can’t see it so you’re just going to keep thinking you deserve this.
---
So blocked.
---
I have an instagating limb damage gatlin laser. Is that good?
---
No kidding. If they did, I’d bother getting a pet deathclaw.
---
Saves some T Bonds.Thanks.
---
I afk’d on the barrels once, and it kicked me. Idk what that was all about, but my controller was off and everything. On Xbox btw if it matters
---
I shouldn't have to remove and replace an item to get rid of a UI element that serves zero purpose. I also never said anything about it impacting performance or stability, so WTF you talking about? I said it's an ugly unused UI element, which it is. It serves zero function in the game.
---
I turn spits even before the event fully starts to get a jump on the meter
---
I believe you are kicked from the server for inactivity after so long so those on spits/drums are out doing something IRL and come back and are contributing but could be kicked. The ones spinning in circles are away from the computer probably at work or something for hours but their character will rack up rewards and they are contributing nothing. Is this considered against ToS or can this not be classified under anything?
---
Next genhancments is a missed opportunity😂
---
Do you have discord? Just showing up next to someone seems of when I could coordinate times to play.
---
I like spits because when you exit, it gives a recap of your rewards
---
As good as any in the wasteland man ha
---
I'm guessing we'll see some with Steel Dawn.
---
Yes, it will be like purple fart coming out of their butt. https://i.imgur.com/r1yJYz1.jpg
---
You block me because your argument is of no merit and you know you don't know what you're talking about. Also, it's a very childish way to not concede your position is flawed. My brother is a game dev and works on small projects and this is just a simple fix. You're clueless, buddy. No matter how small their team is, this would be easy if they decided to do it.
---
And some people put them at 500-1000 caps each. Hahahaha
---
I have a two shot plasma caster that I love to use on these guys. It's great!
---
I'm pretty noobish (lvl 104) done daily ops solo in less than 8 minutes several times. Can be frustrating sometimes, but completely doable. I'm PA full health heavy weapons build.  
---
Run to the first objective as soon as you're out of the loading screen and ignore / avoid enemies while going for the objectives. Only time you should be killing them is while boosting the signal or taking down the last group and/or boss. Or if you **really** must.
---
Yes I have discord
---
This doesn’t work
---
didn't they say the daily ops rewards was just the purveyor mystery pick? how could they fuck that up to start dropping legacies again?
---
Pretty much every event I go to theres someone using this popular hacked weapon: looks like a heavy gun, shoots fast, and does an explosive shotgun spray that one hits everything it touches.(Also sounds weird)
---
Also Pepperoni Rolls and Deathclaw Steaks
---
Also, I think my friends are getting tired of me asking if they have any deathclaw eggs. 😂
---
Oh okay.  I wasn’t sure.
---
This doesn’t work and has never worked
---
I'm not sure what it would do if I had pistol perks, I coined most of them off since it's not a build i would choose for this char ,so I can't test anymore :(
---
To quote Chains from hit game Payday 2, "broke dick piece of shit."
---
500 should be max for you to buy but don’t buy unless you have starched genes perk card unlocked. You will waste caps on it by losing it from radway
---
15-20k in trade, Forest is higher.
---
I see her very often while doing the ecological balance quest.
---
If you've changed the caliber of the base weapon's receiver, keep one round of the default ammo on you so the game doesn't think it's empty. It's a (yet another) bug.
---
Guessing your problem weapon is a hunting rifle? Just keep one round of .308 on you and it'll switch like it should.
---
Duck you man that’s  all I see now.
---
Thank you. I look forward to mannequins behind glass walls and building a boutique fashion store. It will be a heartache dismantling my base but I have my photos saved.
---
It makes me so mad for people just to farm that stuff and do no work at all, especially seeing level 100+ it’s annoying
---
Exact same happened to me after I updated. I'm afraid to delete or move anything in my camp now.
---
Do you use born survivor?
---
Right no one is excited by it it seems...first couple days yeah, now notta, and until I get my build set can only solo the one near Wayward.
---
If they think this is stable Im at a loss for words, like what they smoke must be 10000x better than what I got.
---
&gt;Make a real argument or i will simply ignore you and your nonsense.
---
Funny, I'm thinking the same thing about you.
---
&gt;Available micro-transactions do not count as a value proposition for a full priced game.
---
Yes, actually, it does.
---
Look, just because **you** personally dislike MTX, or think Atoms shouldn't exist?  *DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT THEY DO.*  And that isn't going to change; the Atom Shop is not going away.
---
Atoms have a value that is directly relatable to real money: about 100 atoms per dollar, at the most basic transaction rate.
---
&gt;Not only that, but you did not compare "servers on" to "servers off". you compared one set of over priced trash to another set of SLIGHTLY lower priced trash.
---
No money coming in ----&gt; servers off.
---
That's literally how it works.
---
&gt;Trash that has no real world value btw.
---
One man's trash is another man's treasure.
---
IOW, just because you don't want a thing, doesn't mean that thing has no value at all.
---
***I*** don't want a gas-guzzling SUV.  Said vehicles retain their value independent of whether or not I personally want one.
---
It is the same with Atoms, and you.
---
&gt;The atoms are pretend.
---
All modern real-world currencies, being **fiat** currencies, are"pretend".  They work because enough of us *choose for them to work*.
---
&gt;comparing a made up purchase to another made up purchase is not valid for value propositions, no matter how big the letters are that they slap on there that say "BEST VALUE"
---
Items in the Atom Shop cannot be purchased directly for U.S. dolalrs, nor any other real-world currency; Atoms are the intermediary measure of funds placed on deposit with Bethesda, against future acquisitions from the Atom Shop.
---
The **rate of exchange** between your local real-world currency, and the Atoms used as a universal currency within the game, is what I compared.
---
Bought straight up, with no subscription, you get 1,600 Atoms for $15US; that is an exchange rate of roughly 106.667 Atoms per U.S. dollar.
---
As part of a F1st Subscription, you get 1,650 Atoms, for $12.99 ... an exchange rate of \~127.021 atoms per U.S. dollar.
---
Thus: a Subscription gets you more Atoms per dollar, *without even looking at any of the other things the subscription gets you*.
---
If you personally don't want or value Atoms, then that is your own **private and personal** affair.
---
That doesn't change the **objective** truth of anything I've said.  No matter how desperately you need it to, to shore up your own fragile sense of self-worth.
---
I am doing them all in power Armour.
---
Maybe this is seriously slowing me down.
---
Without Power Armour though enemies are shredding me.
---
At Galleria i did it quite quick until the end.Then was held up fucking about whacking Gutsies,had no choice because the Boss wont Spawn,swapping from Heavy weapon to Melle weapon.This part seems to kill my time every OP event.
---
Like the Burrows i storm straight through,sit literally on top of the progress meter
---
Every time Paladin.
---
No idea how i can shave those minutes off Solo.
---
I only laughed because payday is in my top 5 games of all time. I love you, i hope you have a spectacular fucking day
---
One of those things is deffo not like the other.
---
got me feeling all Morty now
---
AAE probably
---
They datamined an Enclave PA skin and beret...yet they’ve been AWOL.
---
It’s all good, thank you, I appreciate it.
---
I’m AFK right now having a couple pints at a local brewery. Jumped on the drums and banded the controller so the camera is going in circles. 
---
Curious if I get kicked or not. I’ll report back once I get home.
---
Combat or Pump?
---
Mine just likes to sit in the port-a-potty most of the day
---
I got the War Glaive plan today, sill have another character I'm going to run through later to see what happens then. Also, got a 2* Junkies Tenderizer, cool, but I might as well have been given an anchor to carry around.
---
Why do you care?
---
Not sure, I run them in PA and have no problems with it.
---
As someone with a Bloodied Gunslinger, I added a Quad Western Revolver to my arsenal and that thing tears.  Sure, it's not Bloodied, but as long as you can crit-every-other-hit or so, it's going to wreck anything in 1-2 shots simply because it does a lot of damage... *and you've got 24 shots*.  That's comparable to a 10mm, or the sluggish Drum Magazine'd Gauss Pistol.
---
Tank Killer is also Rank 3, of course.
---
One of the side effects of this rebalance is that while Bloodied is still the best, it's not *far and away* the best.  So Quad has its purpose, as long as you've invested in critical hits (and why wouldn't you?).
---
For Rifleman, the Quad Lever Action Rifle kind of accomplishes the same thing, but unlike the Western Revolver, its reload speed is notoriously relative to how many bullets you have to load.
---
With giant pain in the ear bars flying around? No most you find were shot down as the brotherhood were trying to fight the scorched
---
I made a pretty sweet box with a roofless deck. It looked like a shipping container but with junky wood walls instead of metal.
---
Well done!
---
If you see the game as “work”, you’re doing it wrong.
---
Big turrets
---
This. Ts on a shotgun will make the accuracy horrible, and iirc it only adds 1 pellet si ther damage lift isn't that amazeballs.
---
Even if the paper damage is higher on the ts I'd guess the aa will outperform in actual use.
---
I love trying to hit something far away with VATS and targeting a Plasma Grenade someone threw instead.
---
I sell mine for 1500 a piece...I have a couple of dozen sitting on mules. Lots and lots of Encryptid events.
---
Looking forward to the instanced camps, will let me be able to get really creative. We can see just what kind of boxes I can build. Lol
---
My wife has been using a flamer also, and it really does make a difference. Once you adjust to looking for fiery silhouettes the invis hardly matters.
---
He’s doing all the work and we’re not apparently.
---
If you drop weapons and pick them up in daily they will show there. He obviously did that
---
Really hope for some next gen improvements still, although it seems hopeless
---
I lit my PS4 on fire and that cleared it right up
---
Graham wont give me the Plan for the Tenderizer. Everything else, sure. Damn you Graham!!
---
I can give you a 1 star AA handmade, fully decked out. That should help quite a bit. But yes, you build could use a bit of work if more damage is the end goal.
---
Are you implying the meat cook actually happens?
---
Because I've not seen it once this 'meat week' - try 12 Primal Cuts in a row.
---
People were saying that on the other post but those weapons show at the top of the rewards list and not at the bottom.
---
Yep that’s magic. Like that other dude said, gotta have a high fire rate depending on your frame rates and game performance but 200+ is desirable because no matter what the magic damage will activate with fire rate that high.
---
Resilient punishes ranged builds. Freezing punishes melee builds. I can see how it’s a bastard. But it seems resilient punishes everyone. I just stand there and Quantum spam, take a Stimpaks when I need to get going and run. Don’t even have my gun out.
---
It dont help that i am now always over encumbered in power Armour,even with Calibrated Shocks.
---
Reason being i bought the grocers back Pack with Treasury Bonds. Meaning i could drop 3 points Thru Hiker.
---
Unfortunately soon as you jump in to power Armour the Grocers Back pack stops working,and you become over encumbered.No idea if this was always supposed to happen.
---
Sounds awesome! Thank you
---
Do TSE ballistic weapons also benefit from the huge buff post OW?
---
like im gonna waste my time actually doing events and shit while some level 400 twat sits on his fat ass and watches
---
Clearly
---
Anything is better than whiny Sophia
---
So it doesn't eat all you have on you when you turn one in? That's good.
---
unless it's changed in the last few months you can get them from campfire tales (got 2 out of aboot 30) and the dolly sods insect thingy (0 out of 20+)
---
might be others.
---
Definitely, they sound really cool can't wait
---
I wanna know why people aren't participating in the event when I am drumming afk on a second monitor.
---
About the raider PA skins. The raiders content bundle features a XO1 looking skin that can be applied over everything like a skin. Even T-65 and my precious ultracite.
---
Open the scoreboard before going into a world.
---
Ha ha.
---
He looks like an Anorak to be fair.
---
You can complete two daily quest to get a chance on getting badges, one located in the mire, near the nuclear plant and another one in the little lake in the middle of the toxic valley.
---
You Will need to grind a lot in order to get some badges 
---
(Sorry, im not at home and I dont remember the location names)
---
Those Headaches.
---
Sadly, tesla shotgun is not shotgun. It would be nice if they add more tesla weapon in the future. Tesla pistol or tesla minigun. Lol
---
"A Game Engine that's older than Cell Phones"
---
Listen, Devs, I love ya, but maybe, just ***maybe***, it's time to let the Model T rest and make a new engine?
---
Floating in space forever... just.... why?
---
Easy way to solve the problem. Make participation necessary to complete the event, opposed to just having to be in the event area. Im sure they've thought of it, but maybe there's downfalls. No idea.
---
Meated out bro
---
So weird. I remember back before nuclear winter came out, people were getting NW and wastelanders spoilers by playing different language versions of the game
---
[https://youtu.be/EOQMpb\_R41Y?t=13604](https://youtu.be/EOQMpb_R41Y?t=13604)
---
As a person who rubberbands the controller during a time where my bladder starts giving me the shakes, I only do this in a private server thankfully.
---
Also, I wear a cosmetic
---
That extra 2 damage on my unarmed weapons really made up for the 1k damage I lost in the patch.
---
- Fixed an exploit that allowed Berry Mentats to see enemies under Active Camouflage. As part of this fix, we have removed all berry and grape mentats from player inventories.
---
I don’t mind targeting. I just wish I could hit them for once!
---
Got any flux i could buy ?
---
i always check deathclaw islands suitcase whenever i see low level players on because they spawn eggs in there for one of the beginner wastelander quests. was over the moon that one time i found 5 sitting in there
---
A full set of ultralight troubleshooters armor is a thing everyone should have. Its the LBD of the wasteland.
---
Mest week is still out!?!?! When does it end
---
combat
---
Stings and things at dolly sods is in the mire, daily cleanup one at kiddie cabins in toxic valley, small chance, and campfire tales. The challenges are time consuming but not that hard( some require some super luck, finding the right magazine 😡), and at least they definitely give you a badge.
---
Edit: unless patch 22 changed something...
---
I can dig that!
---
Without my friends,I wouldn’t have half the cool stuff I have.
---
The community In this game Is the dopest.
---
I try to repay EM when I can,wit stuff they want or need...sometimes it works out,Lol
---
Seriously
---
Honestly they need to have a project clean. Like take 4-6 months and just work on bug fixes, no content just work on what we have right now. The game is in a pretty good place content wise right now and after December itll be even better, so I think just ironing it out would be the best move.
---
Still trying to do ‘em on PS4 to get the peppered mod, and it seems hit or miss to be sure. Even when the event looks populated, its often people depositing Prime meat and not participating or even just shopping from Grahm. It’s so depressing watching half the bar disappear when there are 7 people at the event but there are fires everywhere and people depositing one critter chunk at a time
---
Pretty sure you can get Sludge Lung running around the Ash Heap with mo mask
---
Honestly with public teams being a thing now and experience gaining being so important for leveling legendary perks, I see no reason to not be in a team now. You can still run around and do your own thing without actually playing with anyone if you want, but you are just gimping your xp gain by not being in a public team.
---
Can't you make a sign saying to enquire about junk on chat? Direct trades aren't taxable so would be more caps for you.
---
pay to win! bloody paytoads!
---
There was an identical post for this when Meat Week first released. Bethesda don't care.
---
I assume only meat lovers pizzas this weekend.
---
I had a house I spent hours building there and right about when I was done my wife said “I don’t know how you can stand having a camp there the tilted water would drive me crazy” I hadn’t seen it before and had to move my camp cause it hurt my brain. 😂
---
Use nukes n dragon's
---
I may have gotten it in the Burrows
---
[Here are some things I currently have available, in case it helps](https://i.imgur.com/A3WOdeS.jpg)
---
I'm hearing that in the Post-Modern Jukebox style.
---
Yeah, same here.  Thinking peeps are likely out of ammo.
---
As if getting two spec ops suits is so bad.
---
Got mine the other day for 50c each guess from the posts I got a bargain
---
Hahaha nah, it really wasn’t
---
VATS is doing my head in lately, specially in Primal Cuts. Theres nothing more infuriating than targetting the molerat when 2 x fucking yogis are about to hit you like a mack truck
---
Don't half-ass several things, pick one thing and whole-ass it
---
Addendum: I see pretty high agility here...sneaking makes everything *much* easier
---
What a deal!!!
---
Not a fan of furious on shotguns personally. Bloodied, two shot, junkies's, or even instigating are a better option imo
---
I haven't successfully did this solo. I prefer 1 person fix the signal repeater. The others go straight to the uplink.
---
One Wasteland....welcome to the jungle baby, cause you’re gonna die!
---
Some raider 100% threw some grenade at me and I VATS it with my Guass Shotgun when it was right in front my face. Gave me early access to night night.
---
Use incisor, armor penetration is no joke, pick either heavy guns or shotguns to switch to since they also use strength, if you need to kill bosses in a group. Commando and rifleman might as well not exist unless you're using the weapons for them, so they're wasted
---
I almost always do, else they just run away from it.
---
im settled by wayward. Lots of plans and things i can sell to new players and have my own personal NPC vendor rite next door to sell more things to as well.
---
The bonus is for the completion, and takes five minutes to build, few runs last less than five minutes.
---
haha got a start somewhere eh
---
Yeah that’s my biggest thing now, because I can’t switch to one without sacrificing the other, and I’m not sure the best way to do it
---
go all heavy, redo all perks and stuff towards this if thats what you want. I have some random vampire guns you can have to keep you alive until your build settles. Look me up in game when you can, ign catpants
---
Sums run anywhere from 300 to 500 caps. If someone is charging that much it's a scam.    
---
I have never paid for than 500. Have patience.    
---
You'll need Class Freak at R3 which doesn't hit until level 46 so at minimum level 49 is when you can keep mutations with a dedicated 5 points in luck for Class Freak R3 and Starched Genes R2.
---
One wasteland....... What an amazing update, SO MUCH XP!!!!!
---
There is a bug / maybe not bug that lets you turn multiple in if you do certain things.
---
If you can’t find them under $500 you can easily get them for less on the trading subs. I dunno it might even be fine on this sub as it’s more of a hand than a trade.
---
takes 5 mins i believe for a bond to form. the vast majority of people cannot do this under 6 mins never mind 5
---
Check for the icon SW of Vault 76, on the hour every hour. The event actually starts 2 minutes after the hour, so you want to be fast traveling to the event asap.
---
If your on a busy server, it can sometimes be completed by 5 after, so make sure your watching the map, or you will likely miss it.
---
As bad as 5 consecutive misses at 95% hit chance... every...time ?
---
Okay gotcha. Thank you, will add this to my growing list. This is my first time playing so I am big noob.
---
That *was* the update. Everything scales to your level now.
---
One wasteland. Everything scales to your level now.
---
"nope" - bethesda game studios
---
exploit with xp. funny is ,it is boring and not best way to earn xp ingame
---
With the new update even enemies at the forest will be lvl 50, highest they'll go is 100
---
And funny enough, they REMOVED the bayonet from being attachable to the dragon even though it has a unique visual for it and all the animations work fine
---
hahahahaha, this is good trolling
---
i have about 20 of these displayed in the last year thanksgiving case and it looks pleasing to me :)
---
It'll return, probably around halloween.
---
Ohhh okay! I haven’t been able to play for a while because of college, at least a month, so I’m finally getting into it again! Thank you!
---
I'm sorry I have a hard time comprehending 😅 so now like im level 47, a radroach is level 47 and if i level up during combat it goes to the same level as me?
---
Thanks for the insight. I am really curious on this Tank Killer, seems I need to incorporate it. 
---
My other builds were largely uneffected, dare I say stronger. I have had a full health junkie/vampire commando for well over a year and now with what rads and the poison perk my vanguard armor is insane. Damage is still great due to other perks as well. The heavy gunner/shotgun build had to change a little and bring more health but with the PA charging perk its still a beast. 
---
My pistol guy was the only one that felt weak but I didn't know Tank Killer worked. Time to give it a shot. Thanks.
---
Do you have a heavy build recommendation? I’ve seen a few but they vary so much that it’s hard to know what will be beneficial and what won’t be. And thank you, I appreciate that!
---
If you’re on pc feel free to add me, I’m level 130 on my guy right now, and only just started maybe 3 months ago. Bethesda is tacotheunicorn
---
I'm not i promise I just don't understand why I'm level 47 and everything is level 47 now
---
Same vendor hop now never really drop below 20k caps, buy gold from smiley once a week about it really.
---
Because you *want it.*
---
Especially during meat cuts event
---
Watoga, too.
---
Every creature will be close to your level, up to level 100.
---
Sting and things are the easiest way to.get them....I do atleast 4-5 a day and get about 1 every 4-5 events
---
Just wait it out. Sometimes the bundles items are sold separately, or one is given away as the weekly freebie. It's how I got my floral curtains and purple wall paint 😀 Fwiw I have spent atoms on other housing items. But like you I don't want to buy a whole bundle for one item.
---
Edited for spelling. Sigh.
---
Are you suggesting a system where caps can be exchanged for gold, but without any limits?  Or do you mean no limit on how much gold can be used to buy perk card packs?
---
My main is a Stealth Sniper lv 130.    
---
My CAMP is just N of the Wayward along the river.    
---
I'm on PC and my user: DocB30tn.    
---
I'll probably be on after 9p.m. CST.    
---
If you PM me what you need I'll see what I can do. I might have some plans and recipes you can have as well.
---
Probably my husband who fell asleep while playing upstairs. The snoring gave it away.
---
Oh okay my concern was its everything is my level like no level diversity
---
Just watched his 4 videos about this and the only hidden effect he noticed was the electric absorption one.
---
Welcome back, you might notice a damage drop due to multipliers being modified which was also part of the update.
---
I would prefer the overseers projector personally
---
Okay thank you!
---
I hadn’t thought of that. I’ll have to test it out.
---
Don't mean to sound dumb but what the heck does AFK mean?
---
I only do drums because one time I think I put the wrong meat in and event “finished” as soon as I did. I don’t quite remembered what happened but I didn’t want to risk ruining that event for others so I just stick to banging the drum lol
---
Nice!!! I lucked out today, too. Just got my hands on both the Tenderizer plan AND the Sheepsquatch Staff plan. Been trying to nab both of those forever. Hopefully I can get the War Glaive plan to drop soon, then it'll be time to grind out some Purveyor legendaries.
---
Instanced bunkers means we're one step closer to being able to get our own rooms at the Whitespring and/or Enclave bunker. Definitely good possibilities
---
Imagine square enix collabing on Fallout! That would be awesome.
---
pre nerf, i was a heavy pa food build. But the nerf made that very unsustainable. So I eneded up going 100% Vampire Heavy PA, because if my health goes under 99% I lose my shit. 
---
I went mostly non explosive, any perks that help ballistic ammo weight (80k 5mm weigh a lot). I'm not near my pc so i can't post my build at the moment, but if/when I get logged in i can post my exact build here, but it's not a "real" build. It's a bastardized ammo weight/heavy pa build that usually throws purists into a stroke.
---
Get rid of lead belly, traveling pharmacy,
---
Pick one weapon type and specialize; you've got 1H, 2H, melee, rifle and commando perks. You're spreading yourself too thin.
---
Last time I scrapped a Chassis about a year ago by accident it put all of my pieces into my inventory. 
---
If the pieces aren't appearing after a re-log, and you're on PC, let me know.
---
The one that only covers the top half of the face?
---
same here.
---
I've gotten Royal Jelly from killed Honey beasts.
---
you know when you start the game and there's a screen that pops up telling you about game updates? you should read that.
---
Lol.Nice. very nice.😄👍
---
Yes that one!
---
Okay thanks 😊
---
I was talking to someone about shotgun skins, and I started thinking about how some guns have so many skins, and there are still guns with no skins. 
---
I recently had a BE25 Railway drop from Earl, and even after patch 22 it destroys. Now, all I need is some sweet skins for it!
---
I hope a radroach kills you ha ha.
---
Ok...  so you still didn't answer my questions but alright.
---
Stands for "Away from Keyboard", basically means they stood there and didn't do anything.
---
Right now, the Take One For The Team perk card allows for it. It's within game mechanics, so I'm not sure how you're calling it an "exploit." Especially when you refuse to turn on pacifist.
---
Wait until OP finds out there are NPCs in the game
---
Congrats!! Still on the hunt for the sheepsquatch staff and warglaive! I’ll be turning in scrip for 3* melees from now on just to see if I can get something cool. The war glaive looks awesome!
---
Haha okay, well you seem very knowledgeable anyway so I will absolutely listen to your advice
---
Oh shit that's a bug then
---
It's the build. It's always the build.
---
Burning mine or Belching Betty in the Ash heap with no mask on.
---
The urban/forest underarmor clips out of every thing you wear. Especially bad on the arms. It's been like that forever with no fix in sight.
---
Oh for sure, not sure when but it's one of the oldest thing in the atomic shop.
---
Yeah that's neat, I love Heinlein he's my second favorite author of all time, but I'm not sure if you trying to use it to justify being unable to turn a roasting spit or play a drum in power armor or not.
---
I can use a computer without smashing it to bits, I can even pick a lock on a door using a bobby pin with my big clumsy powerful robot hands.
---
Its inconsistent, and it should be changed. It hurts nobody allowing power armor users to interact with things while in their power armor.
---
I’m saying the first option. Also we could have perk pack that scales to how much gold you put in.
---
That's the part of the update called "one Wasteland". 
---
Every Enemy you encounter will scale to your level. 
---
It also depends on the area you are in, if you are over level 50. In the forest the highest level you will encounter is level 50. In other areas they scale higher, up to level 100. Ash Heap an Toxic Valley shouldn't be as hard as The Mire and Cranberry Bog.
---
They're definitely not in my inventory. I'm on PS4, unfortunately.
---
Imagine being so entitled that what other people do in a video game pisses you off
---
Yeah someone I played with on here was trying to help with my build! I’m slowly working on understanding it and figuring out what build id work best with
---
Great to hear I can’t wait for it to come back thanks for the info!
---
Real Royal Jelly or the weird crafting material one? Because the Honey Beasts tend to drop the crafting one, not the consumable.
---
*X-COM intensifies*
---
I was playing Read dead online earlier this week and I and the thought...damn let me get this stuff going in fallout. I play tons of 76 but uh...the engine is ancient
---
Giggity
---
Thank you for explaining. I was just confused since its not like I see any other levels its only my current level everywhere.
---
I hopped onto Nuclear Winter at 7am cst and after one match it couldn’t find anything, so you’re right about that. I’m always going to look forward to building stuff. Surprised and pleased we’re getting to test indoor camps already.
---
No, that’s inherently flawed. It is so easy to get caps in this game (included a legitimate non-exploit manner to get infinite caps) that you’d still be destroying the planned progression.
---
There’s a reason Smiley only sells you 300 gold each week. Because being able to buy unlimited gold is a catastrophic idea.
---
I've had people I blocked put in my NW teams. It really does nothing.
---
Don't start a daily ops team if you aren't going to do the daily ops. No one wants to wait around for you.
---
My friend lives in the Mire with his donkey. He's always yelling about rad toad mines. His wife, the princess is fed up to here with her vats targetting them.
---
You mean Public Teammate or Private Teammate?
---
do people not do this? I always see people doing this especially with lode bearing event
---
Won’t you die from dehydration if you’re afk?
---
I'd say the very next thing is to put in the sneak perk card and level it up. Make sure that handmade is suppressed and crouch. Escape artist also helps. 
---
The game will feel a lot easier, you'll use less ammo, get hit a lot less, and you'll have some breathing room to move forward on the rest of your build plan
---

---
That's awesome. I see some people do such creative things with their camps. I wish I had the patience to sit and make something nice like this. Great job!
---
Not after they added it to the loot pool from the Xmas presents, I got about 7 of them just myself...
---
well at least now you know what to do tomorrow...
---
True and that sucks that they focus so heavily on one group of users while ignoring the rest of us. 
---
I will say I have little hope that they will ever come now that Microsoft has bought the company and have already said support for future games is on a case by case basis, which to me is just a fancy way of saying, duck off PlayStation users, IMO.
---
Ah, I was wondering how the fuck someone had a camp full of clowns without the event being live.
---
VATS really needs some more attention by Bethesda. I don't think it works as it should.
---
Not over do it ?
---
Thank very much
---
Is it supposed to freeze time like fo4?
---
Bloodied is still top dog. 
---
Ive tested a bunch of different builds since launch to see what works and what doesnt.  Conclusively, Bloodied is still top for damage dealing.  Other things fit other roles.  
---
I mainly play bloodied, but with the nerf I also wanted to check into High health AA/Vampires/Mutants/Exe as well
---
You can get by with a high health build just fine, Junkies will get you similar damage to bloodied who isnt in nerd rage.  AA is your best all around option though.  Vampires will make you pretty hard to kill, tand you will use more ammo.
---
Things are more bullet spongy than they use to be, and this makes headshots all the more valuable. 
---
I tested a variety of weapons in a variety of builds, Junkies High Health, Junkies low health (hated it). High health/High DR, High health/Low DR, Bloodied Damage, Bloodied Tank.  PA Heavy Bloodied, PA Heavy High health.
---
All in all, if you want to survive, nothing beats a PA build at high health.
---
If you want to destroy everything you see, Bloodied PA.
---
If you want to make normal non high health encounters easy, bloodied rifles or commando.
---
If you want roam and be the most versatile, high health, high DR.  Using a Vampires weapon set, or Anti Armor for dmg output.
---
Those are my thoughts.
---
My bad. Minigun.
---
lick my ass
---
Damn!  Some pre-wasteland looking swankiness there!
---
Wouldn't Demo Expert increase the damage even further however since there's more rounds hitting with explosive compared to the AAE?
---
Will future content be Xbox exclusive?
---
Yes, I was around.
---
Doesn't change the fact that the people most likely to try to announce publicly that they were falsely banned, were in fact guilty.
---
Why would you even bring this up as part of your question.  Basically, what people are going to see is this:
---
"Hey, they banned me last time for duping, whats the best gear now so I can dupe it"
---
I thought they did? All mine (raiders, settlers, camden, watoga etc) reset at 10:00am every day
---
No. They removed  dying from dehydration and starvation.
---
only one counts because you only have to level up once. weird
---
I heavily disagree the Brotherhood fatigue should stay as underarmor
---
Haha looking good until the bombs drop! Thanks man
---
Well they sure as hell don't for me.
---
Yes to this. Love it when that happens. 
---
My survival tent is parked outside the substation so I harvest a deathclaw there whenever I want; right down the road from there is a random spawn point (on the way to the bot stop) that can spawn the albino deathclaw on her nest, with or without supermutants. There’s usually at least one egg there, sometimes two, and of course at least one in the waste dump.
---
if you're gonna stop playing because you're close to levelling up you're playing the game for the absolute wrong reason.
---
I'm selling a piece of propaganda for 25k, your welcome to buy it
---
There are crashed Vertibirds all over the map and two undamaged in Watoga. No operational ones yet.
---
Some people are just don't want to invest that much time into it but they do want to spend money. Hopefully he was a YTr because its pretty easy to get thru it. I 1/3 of the way there.
---
I agree like, theres nothing wrong with buying a few tiers, or playing some to get to a certain tier and buy when you're one away, but man come on. It's like you're already that high level, you play the game alot already, why not save money?
---
I would put off changing the two handed melee build for 20 levels. Move points out of perception into agility and get perks like dodgy.
---
You don't need more than 5 in intelligence. Concentrate on being a melee expert which will help you defeat almost enemy. 
---
Lose perks like green fingers, they do not really benefit you. Food is plentiful. 
---
Once nothing scares you in the game you can start changing your build. You are only really slowing down your legendary perks, but they are just the icing on the cake of a solid build. 
---
Work on getting a full secret service armour build unless you prefer power armour. It is absolutely doable, you just need a plan.
---
This gets my upvote just for “purple fart coming out of there butt”.It tickled me and made me think at the same time.Where else would a purple fart originate from?
---
Some people have the discretionary funds and choose not to wait. 
---
While I personally think is a poor decision, it’s not my money.
---
I came back a few days ago at a discount im sure, I've had it for a while.
---
You shouldn't do. I kept mine AFK (on drums) while I was at work, and it was still going strong when I got home.
---
Standard time globally but obviously time zone specific. 17:00 in the UK
---
I also enjoy displaying the preserved prewar food, like preserved instamash or Salisbury steak
---
No i leveled up to 150 and finished my dailies and two week challenges, then i made a trade with a player and he invited me to help in the colossal problem and reached 152 in doing so. Maybe less lunch boxes during the event lol
---
Neither works that I know of
---
Doesn’t work for me either.Unless it shows up differently with different visual settings?
---
Yeah, super weird. Sort of like when I killed an extra 25 creatures while in a group it didn’t count for the next identical challenge.
---
welcome to bethesda games.
---
popcorn is in the corner.
---
It's weird that this is the second day in a row in God knows how long to not have to go to someone's vendor for SCORE.
---
Perhaps check the other chasis(I am sure you have). I scrapped a chassis on PS4 about  4 weeks ago and had a heart attack. Thankfully the pieces appeared in inventory. Could be a new bug since the latest release.
---
Ive had the popcorn since the beginning 
---
And the popcorn is infinite, just like the bugs in fo76
---
Public team-mates.
---
I don't think it's a "flex." People can spend their money how they want. If you have the money and want to spend it on that, why not?
---
I'm not sure what to do, I turn up and get intestines a lot whilst looking for something to shoot, when I see something a level 9000 power armour guy drills it in a oner before my triggers been pulled.
---
Sounds like drummer boy could be just the thing for me (do i still get rewards for being useless)?
---
Wife passed me on the board a few days ago. Think she's lvl 67, me 62. We're almost outta berry mentats. I spent half the day making brain bombs and relish to keep us going. But just buying lunch boxes and fucking killing on primal is awsome. I really want and have plans for those greenhouse walls, but I'll take 100 lvl ups and grinding before I/we pay for that shit!
---
I was thinking either the rifles bloodied or junkies but what armor do u use for junkies cause I don’t wanna lose a lot of damage output so if it’s about the same that would be cool also would be nice to not have to heal all the time would junkies completely change the game for me cause I definitely love being top tier damage with bloodied
---
At Rank 63...didn't spend a dime.
---
Pro tip: Buy and use lunch boxes as often as possible (always use 4 at a time), if you need more just server hop and they will be replenished and able to be bought again. Farm West Tek, Burrows,Harper's Ferry, rinse and repeat....tons of Xp! Eat food or read mags that give 5% xp also.
---
Watched a guy AFK right beside the cooler where you put the greens in. Not doing anything, just standing there.
---
It was late in the night EST so not a lot of players around and we STRUGGLED to finish it (we got to lvl 3 cook out with like 11 seconds to spare) If that guy had sat on a drum or a spit that would have changed so freaking much!
---
If you came for my 2nd tier armor items you deserve the 60 outfits. It’s all about that SS grind some gold
---
I can’t think of a way they can create another daily op that completely negates a build line they did with piercing gaze. Power Armor Magnet so every 5 seconds your power armor sticks to the ground immobilizing you for 10 seconds. Maybe Heavy Bummer where heavy weapons deal 1/10 the damage. 
---
I’m a bloodied stealth commando and have had to hybridize my build so I can flex into full health PA for daily ops.
---
Also a little more incentive from the perk card packs this time.  There are 13 packs in this run, so 104 legendary perk points extra. I confess I bought a couple slots because I was impatient to level up a perk.
---
i have enough atoms to buy 40 levels just from the diamonds i have.
---
Quads are fantastic, the cursed one from Colossal Problem is pretty good too.
---
I haven't repaired my t-65 helmet since I got it the 2nd week of wastelands
---
Yes! That glass set looks so cool, you could do so much cool stuff with it. I want it for my rooftop garden :)
---
I guess so, or maybe try turning on the flashlight. Sneak is useless anyway because of the enemy perception.
---
I know this is late but thank you so much! I was about tob give up hope.
---
Nope. Fallout 76 will remain the way it is.
---
Cool!!!!!!!
---
I am on now how shall I find you?
---
Yeah that would be pretty badass!  I particularly like the helmet / mask a lot.
---
I wish they would port over the merc outfits from Fallout 4.  They are easily my favorite ones from Fallout 3 and 4.  The Merc Troublemaker, Merc Charmer, and Merc Adventurer outfits look great and I would easily buy them again.
---
If you turn on pacifist mode you can use a tesla and shoot the other combatants and it will jump to the enemy. Luckly i have a double shot tesla so works even better.
---
Literally 10:00am East Australia time daily for me
---
No, but when it's displaying 95% then my shots should be meeting their target head on!
---
How about a cap that you can buy. 2 scale packs and 3 regular packs a week. Regular pack is max caps or bullion and scale is scrip or bullion.
---
So, my guess is to avoid ‘join team, FT to workshop, leave team, contest claim’. Maybe.
---
I could see allowing it for Private Teams if a FT mat was placed.
---
Sorry, no next gen enhancements for a game capped at 30 FPS on consoles is fucking stupid. I hope to God this changes.
---
It’s a lazy solution though. Maybe make it so the uplink only activates if you’re out of stealth giving stealth players a chance to balance the uplinks and combat.
---
I have over 200lbs of 2mm EMC’s lol
---
Thanks for the advice, much appreciated
---
Lucky! It’s only been in the shop once since I started playing fallout and I missed it lol facepalm
---
What do you mean by ‘scale pack’?
---
People spend money on things that matter to them. Like  exotic plants or fancy wine or spa days or orthopedic dog beds or towels or a rare stamp or.....you get the idea. Why does it bother you so much that some people bought this?
---
Keep telling Bethesda what you want!
---
High health junkies I used a 4x Vanguard and 1x Auto Stim.
---
Low health Junkies i used my bloodied setup 3x Unyeilding and 2x Bolstering
---
Both builds were tested with Junkies Lever and Junkies Fixer and Junkies HM.  No other weapons, because addictions only hurt your output if you dont have a junkies weapon.  
---
In my own opinion, High health Vampires or AA  beats the junkies hands down.  You use a little more ammo, but it feels safer.
---
Sorry wrong thing. I mean no cap on bullion spent on a pack
---
Like a winston tickle gun. But that would be more of a flamethrower than a minigun.
---
Well Bethesda is happy with that, that's the main reason they removed daily atoms and did seasons so grindy, so there's only two choices grind a lot for at least 4-8 weeks or spend real money to advance.
---
I just figured it out, I think I joined your world. That’s a first for me trying to do that.
---
Had like three people doing that last night and we only got the second level because there was only 1 person on drums and two of us running around. We’d nearly get it full and then by the time we’d collected another round of greens and critter chunks the meter had fallen again. Then they all wanted to start emoting when the event ended
---
Furious on shotguns is bad because a stray round can hit a nearby target thus breaking the effect.
---
If you love being top teir damage, stick with bloodied, just play a little more cautiously.
---
Junkies does take more upkeep, and more stims.
---
If you make a mistake and mess up your addictions, you are left hunting for chems.  with bloodied, you stand in water for 3 minutes.
---
Sounds like you’re a wealthy player. Give it back and sell items at a loss. I am almost complete on my plan journey as well. I intended on selling items at a cheap price and buying junk/ammo from players. I usually drop plans since they weigh .25 lbs. regardless of the rarity. You might make a new or experienced players day. I don’t really need caps anymore.
---
If you have the Fallout 1st scrapbox, it has unlimited storage
---
Everything g should reset when the dailys do. Not sure why tf this hasn't been done a year a ago.
---
gt: rammadeus. 
---
send me a message on xbox. i'm on my alt and have no serums on here. so i will swap and message when ready. wont be long
---
Piercing actually reduces ap cost 5%
---
https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/0031B1AC
---
Heres datamined info, scroll down until you see AP cost (attackactionpointcost), it says - .050000
---
*Sort of Raiders vs. 'Settlers' that raid more than the raiders
---
I get a shimmery glow with my pa
---
If you're on XB and really want one, I can craft you one with any of the mods. They're 20+ units of weight.
---
Priority should be cross saves over new content.  Players will be moving to xbox from PlayStation and vice versa.  Or console to PC.  Not having this setup will kill the game on the next generation of consoles
---
Unless they aren't continuing with next gen and that's the idea.  Release it as is and fuck the players who have invested time and money in the live service.
---
Gotcha thanks for the info!
---
Yep. Hate it. I made a poolhouse there and it pissed me off SO MUCH.
---
That's why you rename your PA sets
---
They drop from the mole miner pails.  Basically they have adjusted the loot pool.  Based on this, I assume the mole miner event is coming around again.
---
That said, if you cant wait, on the market subs, there are people who had leftover pails who are selling these new plans and drops for a price.
---
Vampire lol
---
Like the amount of cards scale to how much you put in. The pack of 5 is 1,000 gold + 200 per extra card.
---
I just reload my Tesla and spray and pray.
---
Yeah, i was the stealth commando build, I will usually just pack in my AA/E/lvc railway rifle into the ops cause stealth isn’t a thing. As soon as I can score some more perk coins I think I’m gonna put them on intelligence and start running demo expert
---
Team up oh what a perfect world you must game in, 4 hours on and nobody, not exaggerating nobody was doing daily ops teams gee i wonder why could it be the resilient has pissed off more than just me.
---
Angry Turtle deliverers again. 
---
https://youtu.be/GWbwtHQGWGE
---
Best part about this build is it's super easy to achieve as his main gun is an ally quest reward.  As far as the legendary perks go just get ammo factory and you'll be fine.
---
What do you play on? I'm a huge King fan and I would love to check out your camp!!
---
Goat legs, lol
---
This, you dont need to roll at 20%, just get under 30 so serendipity still triggers and you will still be fine.
---
Better hardware-based frame rate. It’ll still be capped at 30.
---
I met along the lines of stealth commando, PA heavy gunner, or 2 handed melees.
---
You were correct ! Thank feck for that!
---
I personally doubt that they will stop doing them as it would just mean more publicity and such for Microsoft.
---
build doesnt matter because.. magic weapons
---
Yes but they could tone tone the mechanics.  Not remove them all.  
---
Survival syringe,  symptomatic,  antibiotics, disease cure etc will all be irrelevant.
---
My only issue with resilient enemies (as a melee user) is that fact that they just like to sit outside the booster range taunting my with their 1 hp health bars. I want to run in there and tear through them with my chainsaw but I don't want to leave the zone and slow down the objective.
---
I get buying them if you don’t have much time to play and want the rewards but you’re not taking advantage of the new content, I like grinding for cool rewards but that’s just me. To each his own I suppose
---
Depends. For Daily Ops, possibly Heavy. For Freeroaming, probably Heavy &amp; Stealth commando
---
I very much did. If only I could teach you to read too.
---
Let me just look into my crystal ball and predict the future a sec...
---
I have been away for a while and just getting back into it.. What do the lunch boxes do?
---
That’s what they’re doing. It just won’t be that much annoying anymore.
---
It also makes the Gauss Pistol an exercise in tedium and frustration.  That thing can't hit the broad side of the barn at "95%."
---
I have Bloodied Heavy build, Full health Commando and Bloodied Pistol... still I mostly play with Bloodied Heavy and do all dailies. Just fun be honest and I love what Bethesda finally done to the game! Feels so good! Even with all nerfs I barely feel ant difference.
---
PA heavy gunner. With the new legendary perks you can make room for rank 3 traveling pharmacy and thru hiker which takes care of carry weight problems, and the other legendary perks are good as well. Only issue is you don’t get as much xp as someone going bloodied unyielding. 
---
Not to mention they have all the crazy magic weapons.
---
Low health build is still best. Vampire's weapons are 2nd most valuable prefix now behind bloodied for any auto weapon. Especially in Daily Ops.
---
Definitely should be a way to vote people out. AFk during any group mission whatever any game is the most selfish chump move.
---
They said the same thing about wastelanders and there were no consequences in that.So I will wait and see if they actually follow through with this one.
---
If you're a decently skilled player - same as before.
---
If you're someone that just copied a bloodied build off the Internet and complain about how the game is too hard now - maybe a Heavy PA or some version of a full health build (Junkies, Vampires, AAE/TSE users).
---
Bro! That's sick! Awesome work man
---
Ah, gotcha. Thanks
---
If your having trouble pop a rad x and starve and dehydrate your self while your in the ash heap. 75% more chance
---
this is the only one you find challenging, hmm are you a one hit wonder.
---
That challenge is bugged, so you won't be able to get the atom challenge.
---
I recall there's a way to get it and make it count, but can't remember how. 🤔
---
Actually, i beleive any NPC you can engage in a conversation will immediately get out of that bench. So click on them first then the bench...
---
PA Heavies won big time with funky duds, taking one for the team, and electric recharge, but all the main builds are still viable
---
Melee is far below other options here now. PA heavy has probably pulled even with commando now. Low health is still easily meta
---
There are other Stephen King references all around my camp. If you're on ps4 you can see it.
---
Hey man Idk. I just started this game on Game Pass, and I got the Marsupial mutation early on so it was just something I picked up for lols
---
It's subjective, but I'm not feeling baseball caps.
---
Awesome thank you, will give that a watch!
---
Just my 2 cents but there is other faction which also have some members who are wearing PA. Commies in The Deep. Either one or two of them are wearing these. Go check!
---
Hopefully BoS will bring a lot of things, be it power armor stations, PA buffs, backpacks and powered enemies as well. Maybe we will face some Renegades/Traitors from BoS or maybe some other faction being crazy about robots/PA (something like Rust Devils) will come as well. It is really weird that some weapons have mod  whose purpose is to drain energy from fusion cores.
---
To be honest, if prefer if they just stuck to making new ones. I’d rather they keep it coming with the West Virginian fashion style. I agree that they do look nice but would rather they stick to the 23rd Century.
---
You have no idea how geeked I am right now. Haha. I'll be stalking to see if you're online when I get to play!
---
Ok. I guess I should do the same thing. I get everything but the tendorizer plans. Maybe I could get it after an overnight drumming session.
---
Yeah, that’s the same situation I experienced which made me write this post.  If AFKers just put a little effort into it, it would be to their benefit.
---
Did you ask a legitimate question intended to improve the game?
---
That's a downvote here.
---
I got the weapon once, but no plan. It sits on a weapon rack till I get the plan..
---
What do the lunch boxes even do
---
Perk Card Packs have 4 cards.
---
I suppose so, I tend to rebuild every couple of days though. I think my favourite spot so far is the cliffs by the Charleston Landfill. It’s just high enough to build a foundation on the top and bottom and leaves plenty of space for a multi level cliff face structure.
---
I hear what you are saying but it’s a 5-10 min session.   I am not there for the bonus, I am there to complete the op.    When I have my top level score I bounce to a casual team.   Then I will stay awhile.
---
What is bruh?
---
Is that a word?
---
A word from the english language or gibberish?
---
Armpits for the final boss enemy. Sorchbeast will came out from their mouth as far as I can remember. I haven't tested it on earlie.
---
And? I was asking legitimate question that I wanted to know the answer to
---
We knew on launch week that large amounts of resources would barely affect server stability. It's a higher number of the same item to calculate. Carrying 5 pipe pistols is more intensive than 50000 steel. The scrapbox is something the game could have launched with as a base feature, but they decided to hold off and make it an incentive for f1st. And it was a good marketing decision, considering pretty much everybody who buys it does it either for the private servers or for the scrapbox
---
Well at least you're getting something, today was my third day in a row getting none rare rewards. :(
---
Didn't realize the calibrated shocks were that rare, I sold 2 in my vendor for my standard plan price of 10 caps.
---
Hey don’t talk about Riley that way
---
Bro, I'm being sarcastic.  Whenever I post about an issue the apologists downvote me to heck.
---
SOmeone posted a video about a new item for camps at the game, I had to ask how many flamingos it was.
---
Well, I ended up biting the bullet and getting the wallpaper pack. It just looked too good to pass up. Now for the next problem. Figuring out which outside wall looks good with it for interior rooms(since Bethseda fixed double walls). Before I had one of the stone wallpapers that looked good with the red brick walls. But I don't think the red barn walls look that good with it.
---
Or just adorable ignorance? 😂
---
They spend so we get free dlc. Let it happen
---
I’ve seen one at a guys camp today (xb1)
---
an educated guess is that the event will return after this meat week.
---
I could be wrong.
---
Same situation here with the bear arm, it's just sitting in my stash occupying some sweet real estate.
---
I love my bloodied stealth commando /  full health PA hybrid. It’s not min/max obviously but it flexes between the two styles really well.
---
Had a game the other night where the Cookout never really loaded. It was just me on one drum, floating in the air, while two others just floated with their back to the pit.
---
You can use people’s camps for this. It shows a damage number and then instantly heals.
---
I saw someone AFK while holding transaction menu with Grahm last night.  That's perhaps an even worse example of AFKing this event.
---
They know why.....but they seem unable to fix the problem.
---
I was in favor of your argument until u said “blocked.” You are basically forfeiting the argument and not even trying to change his mind, tragic.
---
I so wanted bows to be good. I have a couple decent ones and even bought the plan for compound and got a bloodied compound during purveyor sale. But yeah they’re not good and def really bad since patch. And of course seems like I get one to two of them every week from daily ops or purveyor
---
I have copy/pasted those number from somewhere long ago. If that datamined page is up to date it looks like you are right. I have to test this in game :)
---
The one that works for you.
---
One thing that really helped me was switching fronmy Bloodied gun to a Vamp gun.
---
I think health regen still ticks if you're at full health, so if you trigger the Camp effect at full health, get them all down to 1HP, and then charge it to bahs them, your regen will heal the damage you have to tank, and with Serendipit and Dodgy if you run them, , it's very doable.
---
I have a Vamp Penta Barrelled Gauss Minigun I only use for ops to farm Prime 2mm, and that thing hits so fast I'm basically permanently in healing, so if you have a semi decent Vamp gun with a high fire rate, give that a go.
---
Didn't constantly powering PA with fusion cores started with F4 and it's whole purpose is just for gameplay reasons? Maintaining PA would make sense if we were talking about T45/T51/etc but for makeshift made Raider version?
---
True, but that was the 1st drop I got. So I've worn it for 11 days straight. Novelty has kinda worn off by now. And the smell.. oy vey!
---
It’s what I have been saying as well.They will include PlayStation for one reason and that is to grab the money from that player base.They will however continue to treat ps players like the step sisters treated Cinderella.
---
I have so many atoms I don’t know what to do with them.
---
I mostly agree with your points.  Pvp as an example, like a scrimmage vs my buddies is a good laugh and actually really fun but trying to take that sweaty  try hard on in a workshop is just a complete shit show :P
---
Another example of this was the vault raids.  they had some good ideas but man the lag and glitches just killed it.  So it wasn't that the raids were bad it's like you said, they don't seem to have asked "why" wasn't it working out and instead just removed them.  
---
I'd have loved it if they could have instead fixed it so you know, maybe the terminals would work and whatnot :)  Ah well at least we have ops now.
---
Even worse is when you have damage numbers turn on and can see that your shots hit but the game just doesn't count them.
---
Pretty sure you can get all the power armor plans from the faction vendors in whiteprings
---
Take my upvote! This has happened sooo many times. I sell so many weapons it’s hard to keep track.. I usually got like 90-110 for sale at any one time..
---
Great idea!!!
---
Yep!
---
I just wish they could drop missiles...
---
I mean, yeah there are problems but how do you change a card's function after people have sunk a hundred hours of perk coins into it?  Sadly it's almost too late to make changes, just bad planning as always.
---
Good point about Vault raids, that's another case of Beth essentially throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
---
Wander around the Mire or hit the greenhouse room in 94 without a mask on.
---
Oh ok lol
---
They're selling for like 50k caps, like I said, not a bad thing to get two of.
---
Thx for the tip bro :)
---
This is very good to know, I've been looking for this!
---
Seems like some people have a bug up their butt about me pointing that out lol. I can't stand hypocritical whiners like this guy.
---
And the gun doesn't break long before you finish?
---
or 5 points in to gunsmith?
---
Actually a lot of people just aren’t interested in PVP at all... even if you are
---
I got a total of 2 from campfire tales when I was grinding for back pack once I came back to the game last October. It was such a long grind I just did the world challenges. There are some really easy ones, some take some time but you can grind through them. I still have 3 that I can finish all I gotta do is do the test. But campfire tales is your best bet from events. I had to get 8 for high capacity and man it was a grind but it was fun working towards it. Worst part is, I just found out prob 3 months ago that there was a small back pack plan in Morgan town the whole time. Ugh, this is what happens when I didn’t follow this reddit or watch YouTube videos and I’ve been playing since launch and still learning shit everyday.
---
and now I know. Gracias.
---
Vampire stealth commando
---
Have to agree, but it’s their choice. 
---
I’m already level 34, and it’s been a little over a week. This season is far easier than the previous one.
---
I have a couple of characters and my non-PA bloodied heavy gunner with vampire weapons is by far my favorite. My stealth commando just feels tedious in comparison with minimal benefit.
---
Calling people out on their personal spending habits is a *weird flex attempt*. They wanted The Things. So they got The Things. Good for them.
---
If you are on XB1 you are welcome to send me a DM with your gamertag and I can try to run them with you.  If not XB1 hopefully you can find a good team to run with as I think it’s a lot of fun with a team especially if you run them routinely together.
---
Another reason to ge there early, if it gets swarmed, the ! button is basically impossible to click and you'll have to find the sweet spot or FT to 76 and haul ass, and both might take it just long enough to make you miss the event, so turn up early and start banging on those drums!
---
It works as of One Wasteland with Pistols.  It was a Rifle/Commando perk before.
---
I didn’t realize you can buy them. I thought they were a season drop exclusive. 😂
---
sure but you gonna miss more pellets and the ones that hit won't have the ap.  
---
It might just come down to your personal accuracy and playstyle.  The tse will be great if you are like ultra super close, like melee range.  the aa will be better further out and still decent close up.
---
Try them both and see how they work for you I suppose.  but personally I think ts is trash on shotguns and I'd just go with the aa.  Especially given there's no other aa perk for shotguns like there is with rifles and heavy weapons.
---
Don't use full strength RadAway unless you have the Starched Genes perk
---
I had assumed you needed them linked at the start. Cool.
---
Strategy what strategy use a fast vampire melee and team up really same recycled comment as the ones above.
---
It’s not an argument with him. It’s not even a discussion because this is a personal issue with him, not an issue that effects the game. It doesn’t effect the stability or anything like that.
---
So he’s just going to keep insisting it does effect the game.

I agree that the pvp in this game isn’t great. At all. But also most people who play 76 come from a single player game background and have no interest in pvp even if it were good. I think that’s why it’s so low on their priority list when it takes up dev time and money that could go to getting more of Bethesda’s actual single player player base to try the game.

Didn’t know the camp health bar had such decisive opinions 😂, any way I get your point, I love camp building and it annoys me to no end
---
Well you did help...I just ran elder and got the gutter plan and caged lights plan. Fingers crossed for tomorrow
---
I expect Bethesda has metrics about what features are used and PVP in adventure mode isn't high on the list.
---
Yeah true, I do prefer AAE regardless over TSE for sure as it stands anyways. In fact I tried a TSE with the same mods as my AAE just now and it's not nearly as good from what I can tell.
---
Same, I run a non-PA bloodied heavy gunner with maxed out intelligence and the damage nerf is almost unnoticeable, I'd go as so far to say its better post-patch because of taking one for the team and ammo factory. My stealth commando is literally doing 1/6 the damage post-patch, it's laughable.
---
Great job! This is the only reason I carry the camera now to get camp snaps for my load screens
---
Well that’s true, but still requires fusion cores regardless, which is a rare thing to come by. That is unless the raiders want to use unpowered frames, making them as slow as a slug.

He owns a Tesla he does smoke better stuff than you do.
---
These are only from forest events if I'm not mistaken. I'm still missing this one!
---
I got lucky and after learning it I crafted a two star bloodied and it was a beast. Haven’t used it much lately, but have gotten a quad from purveyor and that was about the best one since then. But give it a go and see how it is
---
I’d like to have a place to stand extra power armor.
---
I like it cause constant vats use gets boring extremely quick with commando builds. I usually stick to my unyielding gear with bloodied heavy build for xp and such but definitely plop on the PA, stabilized, and swap OGA in for serendipity for the tough fights. And with the unyielding can use basically any weapon that suits my mood effectively when I don't care about max damage. It's just by far the most fun and versatile IMO.
---
I wish more people would do it when it pops up since the more people the easier it becomes but people think it’s either too hard or too complicated to get to some of the things
---
Do your parents know you’re on Reddit? It’s no place for children.

*booing intensifies*
---
I've heard it does, unfortunately Daily Ops doesn't really mesh with my typical activities, so I can't confirm it.
---
I've done a couple, with my brother, but I typically do my bullion dailies then select a region and "patrol." Essentially exploration and helping people who are being overwhelmed.
---
I feel like survival mode was sacrificed for NW server space. The above mentioned balance, emphasis on duping/rng for God tier pvp gear, would have made survival the funnest high octane/ anxiety version of 76 that it could have been. Also survival needed some basic mechanics fixed or changes...
---
Don't know why I haven't done a cliff build yet that'd be really cool
---
Depends on the ammo you are making for the most part it’s like the ammo factory up north on the map
---
FO76  can be optimized for next gen and for better performance on PC absolutely they probably just don't see it as profitable sadly.
---
If you just need them installed on XB1 and have the mats, I can do it. Assuming you need it done on a standard Ultracite.
---
Thank you!
---
I fail to see the problem here.
---
What kind of ammo do you use? I use a handmade, 5.56, for that, it’s absolutely worth it, every time I come back to camp I have 200 ammo waiting for me, but some take longer to craft, like plasma cartidges
---
be that as it may that misses my point.  Had bethesda ever took a real, honest look as to why pvp is unpopular they could have uncovered the mechanics and items powering these evil gankers you are talking about and given honest players a better chance.
---
They don't ask why, they don't analyze the root of the problem, they just see low amounts of pvp and say "huh I guess this isn't popular".  There's a REASON it's not popular but they just happily ignore it.
---
You want to know something that will blow your mind?
---
There's a unique dialog exchange if Daguierre and Grahm ever meet.
---
At least, it exists in the files.  I don't know if it properly triggers or not.
---
Was meant to prevent farming for xp back in the day , I agree ,
