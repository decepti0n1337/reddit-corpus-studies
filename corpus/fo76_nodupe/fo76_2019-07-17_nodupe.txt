Yes for sure lol, that's a higher level area. Can't believe they wound up making drops affected by the area you are in instead of player level. One of the many baffling things about that game, I haven't touched it in a while honestly
---
---
---
Do you know if it pops up on a private world or do I have to at least be in an online world with other randoms?
---
That's fine
---
Because they say they have what they need to know who did what but they don't. Only those who actually duped should have got banned. If you don't know who did it then u have no right to ban. 🤭
---
Thanks for the info will do.
---
Nah, just for the kill 3 huge creatures weekly
---
Release the heavy guns LIMB damage gods! she ll be literally crippled in less than 15sec
---
Gotta transfer items somehow lol. It's sad this is how we have to do it
---
There's a Lv10 Grafton monster I'm pretty sure. Though you need two others iirc of different types. In the challenges it says what creatures qualify.
---
There’s a level 10 Grafton monster at Charleston Capitol roaming about outside to the left of the fast travel location but it’ll still probably take a few hits at your level. Definitely doable though. 
---

---
The rest on the list to choose from are more difficult without help.
---
Get banned and try a different game
---
I thought they were using the same engine as skyrim. The mechanics feel similar. Also every post apocalypse game I've ever played theres always been some extremely hard method of creating some kind of means of transportation.
---
Well you do give a fuck, otherwise you wouldn't be commenting on someones post telling them how they play is wrong. 
---
And, the season isn't free either, it takes time to grind. Most people value their free time, I do. If I can do 1-2 hours paid work and enjoy the cosmetics now, rather than spending 100-200 hours of grinding, take a guess at which way I would go. 
---
The season is a grind, and some people just want to play and have fun and don't need second jobs and chores filling up their spare time.
---
Isn’t it a bug? Or did they just remove the ability?
---
Rule #1: Store your scrap if it's good scrap, every time.
---
Yeah have no idea why it does what it does.
---
Thanks, I should've figured as it was a post from 2018. lol
---
Exactly then it’s fun for bloody melee people can get hit on her
---
Uhuh
---
I got a nocturnal enviroment resist metal arm I got off the queen this morning.
---
Removed completely
---
Holy wow that's a lot of events
---
It’s on their list to fix lol
---
My go-to is nuking whitesprings, killing everything that spawns including sentry bots, then fast traveling to vault 76, leaving the server then rejoining, then going for the ghouls again. They usually dont spawn the first couple of times
---
Oh yeah thats good stuff.  Save it for em next week lol.
---
Private world farming for me is hit and miss.. the issue is world enemies spawn at a low lv. So stuff outside westtek on your private world might be lv 16 while you are lv 100+
---
Having said that, you can "refresh" your private worlds spawns by exiting the world, joining a public server, then joining private again, which gives you a new world.
---
Why, I still kill her all the time.
---
Been locked up due to the Rona so nowt else to do
---
jetpack or deep pocketed....
---
Grafton monster near charleston station should be manageable. Follow the tracks over a red bridge heading away from the station.  Past the bridge he is usually lumbering around the bottom of a big ditch that resembles a dried river. Server hopping should do the trick.
---
Lastly, join in the event free range and get some shots off at the legendary sheepsquatch before the high lvl players mow him down, miiiight count.
---
I had a stroke reading the items name
---
I would suggest doing events such as radiation rumble or uranium fever, it doesn't even matter if you fail the event because you already get tons of XP. (Btw lunchboxes and double XP weekend is a killer combo)
---
YES! Considering times and "safety" this would fit in perfectly.
---
I was gonna say something bout the down voters but they cannt do anything else with this game so I understand.
---
A mega sloth spawns often near the barn with the workbench next to the bunker that everyone fights the SBQ.
---
My friend was pretty new to the game at that point, but he learned the hard way lol. Yes, those patch notes made some bells ring when I read them
---
Lol
---
I honestly don’t think it fits with gauss weapons. What it should’ve been was a single barrel weapon, with no mods to give it 3 or 5 barrels. And instead of a spin up animation, it should’ve been a charging up animation. Depending on how high you charged it (1-99 like other gauss weapons), it would fire anywhere from 1-10 round burst. Instead of the barrel mods there would be higher burst mods, so 1-25, 1-50, 1-100, etc.
---
Fair point! I didn't even think about that.
---
But it’s annoy when she lands for a second or 2 then she’s off again
---
Wait the game now will auto scrap your shit and you have to post shit in your vendor to make it not???
---
Idk. I have more issues with this game than any of the other 30 I own. It's always something at least twice a week. Was looking forward to catching up during double XP weekend but I guess that won't be happening.
---
I recently repriced almost all my plans by just taking off the last digit of the default price. So if it's a 150 cap it becomes 15, 6000, goes to 600. I tried selling some chems at the default price, no one seemed to want them. Have sold some Nuka-Cola's at the default. Armor and Weapons I'm not sure what to list at.
---
Wait... Are the robots there killable? Like I remember back in the day they used to just come back to life!
---
i wish i was you :(
---
Do people actually read my post or they just assume I am asking for help?
---
Shit...that was probably me. It was an extra and it says it is only worth 600 caps should’ve researched.
---
I want the race for presidency added in. The enclave needs more love but definitely not PVP. At least not on pc. theirs still way too many legacy and hacked weapons out there.
---
&gt; I think players nowadays need to spend a little more time looking at the good and a little less time at the bad.
---
Sadly these gaming communities tend to thrive on negativity.
---
Just select it like you’re going to buy and it shows the full name in the confirmation window
---
It's called The Battle that Never Was (Versus) and it was a cut PVP-enabled event.
---
I played it a few times it was good but the robots need the a buff and maybe some variaty.
---
I'm going to give it a few hours on a public world with Public Team for Events. I've got enough lunchboxes saved up to really boost everyone's XP. Just wanted something to fall back on for when I need to be a bit more of a loner ;)
---
Thanks for the tip on events. I guess that makes sense. Use the events to kill mobs, not necessarily to complete
---
That is how I see it exactly
---
I dunno men I think the card sistem is a little bit broken in that aspects but I surely prefer sneak/commando , junkie/bloodied or booodied/furious builds
---
Its not a bug, its because the player she is targeting jumped on something
---
I’m not telling you to not play the way you want. Just turn off the damn auto team fill if that’s all you do without supporting your team.
---
I got a char banned for the name "12inchPainPipe"
---
You do realize the raider marauder paint works on any power armor right? Not just raider
---
It got nerfed when they released the Wastelandejrs DLC, so many spots got nerfed, and animals which used to spawn no longer do. This was strange, they had 3 that used to spawn, Fogcrawlers, Megasloth and Deathclaws I think, now none of them spawn there .. Braxton used to spawn a sheepsquatch but it stopped spawning there and they put a megasloth instead and a bunch of other enemies .. they must have their reasons I guess.
---
Reinstall the game?
---
It makes me wonder if they saw a way to advantage of the dupe by suspending so many accounts for a couple weeks so these accounts are unable to get all their score points before the end, so that more people will be likely to buy atoms to get the rewards they 'missed' out on.  
---
  
---
They took away the way to earn atoms daily/weekly and replaced it with less atoms earnable over the same period of time, and forced rewards instead of being able to choose what you want to spend that larger amount of atoms on, and not what you aren't interested in. ( i.e. I don't want the space ship playground, I would rather have atoms to spend on stuff I like instead.), seems like most decisions at Bethesda here lately are only real world money based aka driving up atoms sales.( Which is understandable as they are a business with a bottom line.)  Maybe they assume that if you've been here that long, you are addicted to the game and will likely spend your hard earned money to get those rewards you missed out on when they unsuspend all the accounts in a few weeks.  Atom shop stuff usually stays around for three weeks or so, so again you are more likely to buy atoms instead of earn them to purchase the items you want that are about to 'leave' the shop.  
---
Part of me thinks no one is reviewing anything and they will all be unsuspended without any kind of actual review or punishment( as has happened with previous dupe waves, no real punishment.)
---
/End conspiracy theory
---
So you are paying FO1st to NOT use the only service gained that should cost anything.......?
---
Yeah, there was a time where you could apply the jetpack to limbs. People actually really like them because it saves the Torso slot for something more useful. You can probably sell it for a decent amount although Raider isn't the most popular of the power armor pieces.  They fixed the bug so you can't do it anymore, allegedly, but you can still use ones that have it
---
Yes hence why it's on my excavator too
---
Wouldn't bother with the nukes. Create a building team, even if you are the only member.  I usually get the best XP by farming the DMV, Golf course, Westek.  When finished, back to base.  Repair weapons as necessary, offload legendaries, sleep and play instruments.  Log off at your base and then relog and repeat the loop.  Relogging refreshes the enemies.
---
Use melee unless you want to spend a zillion bullets.
---
At Level 295 I've already leveled up 10 times in 4 hours of doing this.
---
To be fair I believe a small portion of players were falsely banned, but I agree. Do stupid shit, win stupid prizes.
---
Well in that regard I guess I can't wait for One Wasteland although I'm not sure it will be an overall good change for the end game grind player.
---
Will relogging to the same private world not reset nuke zones like it does if you have another player in the world?
---
The first ones you kill grant XP, sentry bots will always give XP and so will assaultrons. Protectrons and Mr. Handy bots sometimes don't
---
lmao no. this is just entertainment.
---
the season is free, op couldnt even do a 2 minute challenge and get the 1st rank free, its actually pretty pathetic. funny but pathetic. op is the type that get their guns on ebay lmao.
---
you would literally unlock ranks by just getting XP by playing the game. but i guess some people are just so programmed to pay that it doesnt matter.
---
the amount of brainwashed people in this thread is slightly astounding lol.
---
We don't do logic here.
---
Coming from someone who probably got dupe stuff sound like the biggest hypocrite
---
Yea, I finally learned to do this (bush wookie here). I did not even realize it was an option for awhile there. I wish they would set it up so that it is 'no team' by default. It was only because I go to reddit that I learned about it.
---
Yeah, starting to look like it, indeed.
---
I just logged in at about 8PM ET (I'm in Finland though, so 3AM local time for me), and had 2000 S.C.O.R.E. worth of dailies completed already. Before this, I've not had this happen a single time.
---
Clearly avoiding the reset hour at least isn't 100% sure way of keeping the dailies.
---
You know you're god level when you do a pacifist run of a PvP game.
---
Thanks I had a feeling
---
Thanks, i'll try that
---
Right, planned on doing that, just wanted to both double check that it still worked on private worlds and also see if anyone had any other farming "routes"
---
My game bugged out, luckily. I like abusing the magic shotgun vats in my private world, and without trying it gave me like 23/25 done without me eve actually hitting space to use a proper built up crit.
---
I wish it would, but only after they fix the issue of half used cores littering your inventory.
---
I truly believe that the end game will have to be pvp since all other games are like this.
---
There will always be a bloodied build in the game but in pvp you can counter it really hard with some weapons.
---
Either radiation or explosive/fire can really destroy bloodied players
---
Okay, Karen.
---
Nah man it's definitely a bug. Never used to be this bad.
---
Then why exactly does she do the exact same thing when i solo her and I'm the only target she has and fully in view of her the whole time.  She'll just randomly decide to fly away not even attacking anything just a long ellipse that usually drops aggro.  
---
How do I know there wasn't anything else for her to attack?  Because I had ESP and had literally wiped the entire areas of every possible enemy.  Her whole AI is totally fucked, she just randomly flies around for no apparent reason, it has nothing to do with standing on things.
---
On a private world the enemies should scale to my level right?
---
Nothing besides what the SPECIAL menu says you have effects how many cards you can have.
---
Exactly.
---

Downing **and** Killing a player: 30xp

"There's a new museum opening up in Morgantown! 
---
The owner is asking me to hand out invitations to travelers
---
Looks like that's it, got to go"
---
I was bloody unarmed, then picked up a BE 50 cal, and it’s an amazing combo
---
I didn't say duping made the game better, just that I had fun experience I'd never otherwise have had as a result of it. Gauss shotgun / Minigun roles &amp; Vault 94/79 armours are still bound to accounts.
---
The die is cast. Duping &amp; giving away gear for free means that real money traders on eBay (who have been exploiting this dupe in secret for a long time) had their prices crash through the floor. That is the lesser of two evils.
---
Unless in a nuke zone you have a bigger chance at getting low level enemies, I find. The burrows is good but slow, west tek is pretty good all round
---
Sounds like a plan! I guess by the end of the week maybe i'll level up enough to take on something bigger. But are you saying it's enough to get some hits in and let someone else finish them off?
---
LOL you know whats best for this game. Dunning Kruger is full effect.
---
Also always farm radiation rumble
---
I'm purely unarmed right now, so I have to agree. Also its just not fun. I would take 3 wendigo Colossus instead over the queen any day
---
Maybe he duped and got caught 🤔
---
With the new changes to carnavore you can get 50 extra carry weight from radstag meat. I don't run deep pockets anymore.
---
same here (well 40) and i did every single score challenge, daily and weekly
---
I enjoy the burrows and being a ranged build primarily it works well to get up on the shacks and pick off the ghouls. That area should definitely reset on a relog then.
---
It's just some imaginary numbers that doesn't mean anything and gives you a couple of skins... How do you think this is content?
---
Even if a failed event it's still good XP. Thanks for the tip!
---
Yeah, it's worth a go. Vats is very handy in there, for easy kills one after the other
---
Yea it's a really fun build.  I'll have to try a heavy gun sometime.. just hate constantly worrying about ammo.
---
I tested a bunch of items, and any pre-packaged food item counts. For drinks, I only got a notification for canned coffee
---
Yes, until the sodding SB won’t land.
---
No probs! You'll get plenty of ghouls and glowing blood to sell
---
If I had fresh new content all the time, I’d happily play a lot, but I understand it isn’t possible. The grind in Destiny got so boring that I’ve completely moved on from that game.
---
I just like that somehow a diseased scorched
---
Shooting me gives me some disease
---
I’m fully specced for heavy guns. I had never used them in any fallout so decided to try it when I started again for wastelanders. I went bloodied, again, never did it. I have 3 points in perception and just throw all one star rifleman perks in there for my everyday use bloodied explosive lever action. 
---
That’s the only concession I’ve made to the build. I do 1300 damage a crouched sneak shot to the head on most stuff. I do about the same with a bloodied one star deathclaw gauntlet despite having no melee perks other than strength. 
---
No point speccing into anything really, when you can get most your specials over 30 and just use anything long as it’s bloodied.
---
Yeah but arrows cost adhesive which is more difficult to farm than just getting lead/steel/gunpowder. 
---
You can craft it but there is a limit to the speed at which you can. 
---
If you're picking them up then yeah but actively crafting them, I feel like it would likely be more efficient to just grind materials to craft ammo yourself. The conversion rates aren't that good.
---
Probably nuking people for content
---
Then why are you using raider PA
---
or maybe he didn’t and just got banned either way he’s important enough for fallout76s youtube presence i doubt they’d permanently ban him
---
Issue is not with being suspended for doing something wrong. Issue is that they suspend people under a TOS they don't even abide by themselves.
---
To be fair I’m not mad. It was an awesome end game experience after close to 2500hrs playing. I loved every day that weekend like it was a new game for me. Trying out all those awesome weapons I’ve never been able to use. It was by far the best time I’ve had in all that time playing. That’s how you exit a game properly in my opinion.
---
You can and in fact only for $5 US per weapon. 
---
Your welcome. -Atom Shop
---
I keep getting them on Queen of the Hunt
---
Is there a Halloween skin for combat? I thought assault only. That's cool. Didn't realize there was a skin in the legendary run for cr. Thanks.
---
Maybe this landing technique could be removing survival tents from the event as its people who stand on top of them is what hinders the queen from landing
---
I've got a compromised immune system so had to stay home still only going out a little bit even now
---
What’s the third?
---
Yes.  Sometimes the first run is a mixed bag, but from then on they will scale.
---
That's some shoddy shit. Not spending any more money with these shysters.
---
No chance he duped.
---
Downvoted for being right?
---
Grafton Monster near Charleston Station. 
---
Deathclaw on Deathclaw Island. 
---
Join a Free Range event with other players and get a tag on the Sheepsquatch at the end.
---
Even if I do reinstall it'll take 5 or 6 days. My internet is only 5 Mbps dl.
---
Everyone has duped stuff unless you don’t trade and only use what is dropped for you personally
---
I hope that's not the case because I like his videos, but wouldn't that be unfair?
---
Because it's better looking then regular raider and maybe I play the game for rp elements
---
This actually makes sense and could be true to some degree. It would be quite the risk to take on their part though.
---
If you log out when you still have active lunch box XP is it there when you log back in later?
---
I assume it should be, but this is Beth we’re talking about.
---
Probably in someone’s basement. That happened to people before.
---
It is I just wasted my money that I was gonna put into preordering legion but now I don’t have enough so rip
---
I stopped nuking because of people coming and cleaning house, the amount of ammo to get through a silo to get a few kills isnt worth it.
---
[deleted]
---
Does it matter to you how I play I also like to rock nuka quantum x01
---
Sorry to hear that
---
hell yeah! The name of the game is intelligence now. I have stowed my SS underarmor and 3 of 4 SS limbs to replace them with otherise inferior scout armor that has +1 INT and casual underarmor that has +3 INT. I take serums to eliminate all negative attributes of mutations for an hour, I eat Scorchbeast brain (+6 INT) and pop berry mentats (+5 INT). The result: when I kill a level 91 deathclaw 4000xp!
---
Well, I rarely go out of my way to get lead and steel. To much effort for me. I have a small farm, so I always have a little Adhesive, and paired with super duper, I get a ton. Besides, arrows are super common event, quest, and Wastelanders rewards
---
"Murder and manslaughter are different charges for a reason your honour"
---
Yes indeed much harder to farm and if you burn through your stash box you will certainly need to go hunting for it.(Boarderline rare and top 10 rare junk items for sure.)
---
I don't believe that, someone in his group I see frequently has obviously xp glitched A LOT and you have to dupe to do that.
---
If I'm not mistaken...and this has been my experience with lower scorchbeasts.
---
You have to limb damage the wings. Stagger effects anywhere on the beast seem to break this. So unless everyone fighting her knows this secret and let's someone with the limb damage sharpshooter build bring her down first you have to fight in air.
---
It’s really a shame, I think they didn’t want to have a repeat of the minutemen stuff from FO4 but they unfortunately did that anyways. It would be better if they actually gave some variety.
---
Not even gonna argue a fact.
---
This isn’t some debate based off of opinions or any nonsense like that.
---
While I really *really* want that Enclave event, it wouldnt be fun. PvP needs to be changed to allow those events to be played on an even playing field
---
As it is, any meta build with any Tesla rifle will instantly kill you without even having to aim. And if both opponents have a Tesla rifle it will be simply who can pull the trigger first
---
They'll release events that people will avoid, even though there is cool rewards, because it will always be a one sided match, or mutual assured destruction
---
And with a heavier interest in Tesla rifles: any good legendary Tesla rifle will inflate in value as it's now a more appealing meta weapon 
---
As well as people will just flock to private worlds in groups to do the event. Bypassing the whole appeal of PvP, just to get the rewards
---
Who? And that doesn't mean he did. His career revolves around this game currently. He wouldn't chance it
---
Yea... no.
---
I dont give away my team's pos, cuz I'll team but not run with them. I like to have a team though cuz it's kind of like a position sensor for enemies. ( All 3 just got merkd by the steelworks? I ain't going over there...) sometimes follow far behind thier trail and pick off  chasers.
---
Also. Don't use any other XP boosters if you're using lunch boxes during the double XP event. It's screws up the calculations and you get less XP for some reason! I made that mistake. I was getting 900 XP per super mutant with 4 lunch boxes, then took a tasty squirrel stew and was only getting half that.
---
I'll play devils advocate as I have a different take on the perception build, since I've been lucky to have had a FE laser from very early on in F76.
---
With that, it allows me to run and gun and one shot enemies (sometimes bunches of them) ... to the point where I often handicap myself when there are melee/heavy players around unless for some reason I wanted to hog the xp. They can't match the speed.
---
With SS armor jetpack I can jump, spin and snipe many spawns standing at one location with my loud rifle, which draws more and is very efficient. Explosive effect and split beam results in very high vats accuracy at any range.
---
The biggest drawback is that self explosive resistance doesn't seem to work properly on legacy energy weapons. The second drawback is SBs and their explosive resistance means i have to swap weapons for them.
---
Sorry to hear that hopefully you're not getting too bored with 76 yet!
---
+1 from me.
---
Ohio river adventures has a daily raiders quest once you have done standing with them
---
I work 60 hours a week and have 2 fully allied characters, and my third is almost there. You can doo it!
---
There is, it's the Jack o lantern skin, pretty cool actually 
---
And you can get it now in NW due to a bug. Its about half way through the halloween challenges, should only take a handful of matches if you consistently in the final 10
---
I’ve done something similar so it’s not unfair, I didn’t kill anyone and didn’t use any chems, someone launched a nuke and I ran into the storm to avoid it. I came back out and it was me and someone else, they died to radiation poisoning before I could luckily.
---
I got my account name changed a while back before 76 came out, but I presented it as a security risk. My old name was my irl name and I asked for a different one to prevent potential doxxing. They changed it within a day. 
---
Maybe you could say your irl name is Frank Horrlgan? Probably won't work though
---
How often are you switching armor that equipping the hazmat suit has become a problem for you?
---
Of all the bugs, this one is easy to ignore. Just move around
---
In my experience, I've never been able to place it on any spot that didn't at least have a small amount of dirt.  You can sit it on rock, but there has to be at least a patch of dirt somewhere under it for it to place.  I've never successfully placed it on foundation or floors.
---
Regardless of all that and the walls that are currently a bit broken, it is still a great prefab.
---
Naming is against sub rules, if you see it you'll know who I mean. And again, I don't believe that. Entertainers aren't infallible lol. If anything they're often immune to consequences that bound the rest of us.
---
For steel you can just equip scrapper and do a single west tech/surrounding areas run you'll have a few hundred steel usually. Uranium fever as well if it's up. 
---
For lead lucky hole mine can yield roughly 800-1000 lead from a single run. Assuming you have the acid to smelt it. But for acid you can normal farm some by going to locations where snally/big bear things spawn or just wait for campfire tales and try to tag the bugs there. 
---
It's pretty low effort if you know where and how to farm.
---
I should check. I got a lot of those skins since that bug popped up.
---
I haven’t tested that, i would think so though
---
Been grinding the outfits well trying to anyway, they do get boring but for some reason just can't put it down lol
---
The earth is shaped like a Mr handy
---
I needed people like you when I first started out l
---
Oh sweet! I don’t have very good rep with them right now bc I’m just starting to play their side on my raider character.
---
Literally had someone join my team just to ask this earlier.  Gave a sob story over the mic, kinda like some people do when asking for money in a walmart parking lot.  This guy knows that his lvl 4 character wont be able to use any of the lvl 50 items I'm towing.
---
Switched teams.
---
Ive got nearly 1k arrows that I have slowly been converting into 2mm EC. Its a bit tedious
---
I just got 7 out 9 autocompleted..... -_- what a great start to the Double XP weekend..
---
According to datamines, the Scorchbeast Queen has a unique "perk" that prevents it from being crippled. If the code is to be believed, all Bethesda has to do is disable this one rule and the Queen should be fine, making it more confusing as to why they couldn't just do it immediately, given how seemingly simple it is.
---
What's more odd is that it seems intentional, ie someone at Bethesda deliberately created the perk just for the Queen, and either left it in by mistake or put it in on purpose for no explained reason.
---
We should just be able to get back the old ones we missed like in warframe
---
“To much effort for me”
---
*laughs in 10min West-Tek/Lucky Hole mine runs*
---
I throw useful items out at low prices no ammo over 1 cap. All camps should be helpful oasis's for the weary traveler. cheap plans for all
---
Its not always that easy. I can move a mile away and it still not work.
---
You probably have it then. The dark matter skin is probably better looking, but the jack o lantern skin might be a good placeholder for now
---
Never been in private but I’m sure private is the same as public
---
Never gotten this lucky yet, but every time I try I'll get to top 10
---
Just out of curiosity, are you on ps4?
---
Regardless, I'm 100% he didn't
---
It needs to show the item again
---
Lol. Ive been doing fissure sites all evening, I’m with you on this one.
---
i eat canned dog food and i always get a steady flow when im doing the fedd the people event
---
Yeah haven’t tested it either.
---
Mine did the exact same thing like 3 days ago.  I changed nothing and it's exactly like you described, everything is a little darker yet more vibrant. I swear it has something to do with their hotfix but idk.
---
Queen of the Hunt has a decent chance of spawning a Megasloth at one of the three locations it marks for you.
---
you get a for sure 3 drops. I always tell my low level friends to hit that up.
---
I'll do that, I get scared the game will take the next step for me and buy the item, you know doing me a favour.
---
I had that experience today. I was blown away
---
Well whenever they let you mass deconstruct them it'll be easier. I have about 600 arrows and 400 bolts I got from a vendor for 1 cap each. It's not too much but I plan to convert them to shotgun shells to save on the plastic costs.
---
Grinding the xp isn't going to be that bad. It would be if you missed the weekly challenges though those are 1k score each now that's a lot of times hitting 10k xp to make it up. But today I pretty much played normally and went from like 154 to 165 in just a few hours doing westek and queen runs. The Queen runs were hit or miss though with all the new people on every server. Wish there was a server choice with levels. I like helping new people but weekends like this I wish there were dedicated servers for lvl 100 plus or something.
---
But where to get all that acid?
---
This is why I nuke Morgantown. Glowing ghouls galore for mass and a ton of radiated plants. Not too many legendaries, but because of town streets/blind spots lots of tense/fun moments when you do run into one.
---
Im level 85-ish and hit score 39 today. I just recently started doing NW and most arent that bad, plus you meet more cool people along the way.
---
Bloody mess or grim reapers sprint
---
Suggesting it may be feasible but cant confirm.  Worth a shot, I think it would work so long as you do enough damage to loot the body too, guessing at that point it considers you as one of the numerous players who killed it.  Worse case scenario you just got a bunch of exp.
---
Harper's Ferry &amp; the Burrows.
---
Happy cake day 👍😃
---
I got killed by a death claw and it made me respond close to where I had died originally then a Yao gao killed me then all to respawn and be killed by both no option to go elsewhere

Okay, thanks for the info.
---
That will be a great day in appalachia
---
To me it seems like it’s overlooked because Its always there and nobody doing it
---
Hmm i have one of those duped explosive laser lying around on my other character. I don't use it very often because it breaks quick, kills me and doesn't seem to one shot mobs. I also contest that highly accurate from any range statement, mine seems to be inconsistent from anything above mid range with anything between one to all of the shots missing according to VATS %.
---
I wonder what I'm doing wrong with it? Do you use it in semi or auto like me? What's the trick?
---
That’s a super lame play style lol. I feel bad for your team.
---
This. It's also pretty easy to learn all of their spawnpoints once you do the event enough. There's always 1 before the first ambush where you have to blow up the barricade, and it can be either in the secondary tunnel on the right, inside the red train car in said secondary tunnel, or in the cave on the left or right. After that, there's always one down in the tunnel directly to the left of where the captain spawns; if you see mole miners, you're in the correct tunnel. After that, there's always two past the gate, and they're in similar locations to the 1st (in the secondary tunnel or in the caves). My personal routine is to start searching for the 1st immediately after I start the introductory dialogue, play normally until the captain and all of his cohorts are dead, then find the remaining 3 before opening the gate.
---
Nothing flying has ever been fun to deal with in like any game that isn’t like Ace Combat
---
Four.  2 are Ranged and 2 are Melee.
---
Forgot about West-Tek for steel tbh
---
Resource or level grind?
---
I just stopping put doors on my builds. Saves time and helps my OCD.
---
Crippling a wing used to do this. When wastelanders came out they stopped allowing her to be crippled. Said it was a glitch and they would look into it. I'm just assuming, but it seems they have no intention of changing it back.
---
Indeed, not to be rude, but nobody cares if you play or not. If you like it, play it. If not, oh well.
---
It pops up often. I did it at least three times within an hour last night. Nobody else ever does it. I leave it alone if I see low levels come by, but I like to see what ridiculous weapon drops I get from it.
---
I wonder if this supposed fix of theirs kicked off the bug for those that never had it before. They supposedly released it yesterday and look at that I get hit with the bug.
---
I find Clicking the Icon, then pushing 'E' to confirm will fast travel me, but mouse clicking both icon, and the confirm button will fail 90% of the time, likewise with hitting the activate button on the icon as well as confirm.
---
Events where Mothman Cultists or Blood Eagles are actively trying to take a workshop claimed by a player, or having to take a workshop claimed by NBC factions would be dope
---
A mega sloths spawns 100% north west where my camp is in the bog. My camp is at a small pond where frogs spawn. North of Berkeley springs west.
---
Put on scrapper it's a 1 rank card in intelligence and go through west tek laser weapons give loads of plastic
---
I take advantage of the Events tbh.
---
I use the circus doors and that blue and gold one from the atom shop
---
So you’re a stealth build that moves at a slow deliberate pace and...you’re upset someone is playing a build that can execute legendaries easily and move on?
---
Yeah, crit damage is just not that much more.  I agree that the perk points could probably be better spent on Tenderizer, Mr. Sandman, or gun fu.  I'm assuming you already run concentrated fire.
---
If you are looking for a perk in the same perk category as Better Criticals, Tormentor or Bloody mess if you don't already run it, might be the best option.
---
Tormentor is only really useful on higher fire rate weapons.  Not so good on semi auto rifles.
---
Yes, thanks!
---
I have trypohobia, so radtoads get a visceral reaction from me
---
im gonna walk in ur camp and turn off a few of ur lights
---
Hitting fissures is nice. Lots of scorched and at least one scorchbeast.
---
That would be nice also, although some of the images are pretty similar.
---
Such as me. I don’t think it’s small but really no one knows.
---
Yep. I find the 1st during the introductory dialogue, play normally until I've killed the captain and all of his backup, then find the remaining 3.
---
i’d say resources, it’d be nice to not be constantly running out of ammo
---
What a false dichotomy. You’re saying that a person playing the way they want is a deliberate affront to how you like to play and you don’t want them to?
---
You do realise that what OP did was a choice right? There is the possibility that OP created a new account, purely for the reason of making this video to try and make money on Youtube. I find it hard to believe that this is their main account, I got the first 3 levels without even knowing what to do just by completing my normal dailies. 
---
Throwing insults at them doesn't help your cause. 'OP is the type to get their guns on Ebay lmao'. Is that because how many, and where you buy your guns, is the metric for being a decent human being. Brainwashed much? You are so brainwashed into to thinking that owning a gun is your right and you need it for protection that you can't comprehend that all the least violent places in the world actually have the lowest levels of gun ownership. Step outside of your little bubble and you will realise that you are being force fed lies being sold as truths. 
---
Good day, sir. This has been fun! Perhaps we will continue this later.
---
Perhaps change my mind, but I dislike the Burrows. I've run it a few times now, and I always seem to get lost.
---
If you mean grognacks chair, you can’t. It’s an atom shop item
---
I was at a Queen earlier and people were opening them left and right. When I checked my stats it still said 100% bonus. On top of double XP. Whether the numbers matched up IDK too busy trying to kill her with all the new people in the fight lol
---
4 at the minute but that’s just because I’m bored and like to spice up the XP farm loops I’m doing. 
---
Usually it’s two- a bloodied explosive lever action for everyday, and a bloodied ultracite Gatling laser for big boys and queen. 
---
The rest I have right now are a two shot gauss mini and an explosive handmade. 
---
If I see mad dog malone, there’s no weapons, he gets to catch these hands.
---
But if somebody had it and they join my party/my team they would be able to put it in my camp for me￼
---
I vaporize myself instantly with my TSE tesla which is usually a good indicator
---
Ever seen the pink and white Hello Kitty Ar-15?
---
It’s disgusting how much steel you can scoop out of there in less than 30 minutes.
---
That's what I'm guessing yes. Will have to see what happens with the challenges tomorrow.
---
I've managed to stockpile 400 super stims. I get 6 everytime I do a queen but since I'm a Bloodied commando I'm rarely getting hurt and when I do I just drink water to heal. If you happen to be a similar build I'd recommend trying it. If you're on Xbox I could give you some
---
He's saying you can put the skin on any PA and it'll look like that
---
It really doesn't make up for all the broken auto corrected dailies and weeklies! That they're also still not going to do anything about!
---
It doesn't require a ton of acid. I think if you go down the hill near the bed and breakfast there are yao [bear things I for the life of me can't remember how to spell it] usually 3 if I remember correctly which will give you a good chunk of acid. The abandoned trainyard has snallygasters which also drop a good chunk of acid, probably around 40-50ish. If you manage to tag lots of bugs in campfire tales you can end up with 40-60 acid from the blood bug parts.
---
Project paradise is actually a really good place to get acid as well, if you can swing looting during it. It typically spawns lots of snally/bears. Each give a nice bit of acid. 
---
I believe each lead ore yields 5 lead (8 average if super duper) and costs 1 acid. So if you just get the bears and snally you could easily get 200-300 lead without super duper and 260-400ish with it. Depending upon the drops and luck with duper.
---
that's not your build, that's your legacy gun.
---
You can't place items from Atom shop in other people's.camps.
---
oh
---
Never put 100 percent faith in any person, we are humans after all.
---
Again plenty aware
---
Putting the lotion on the skin.
---
There’s also a second quest there from Bones that sometimes is repeatable
---
Just about any bloodied gun will change the way you play. Once a masochist always a masochist.
---
But once your bored with that you’ll resort to drugs And become a junkie. Shooting yourself up at every chance you get for that extra rush.
---
if you're a commando build, try it modded with the auto receiver. it's impossible to use outside of vats, but if you think it's op now just you wait.
---
I want to see a server that everyone just waits in the middle to the very end and see what happens with a massive fist fight for supremacy inside the final ring
---
Thanks! If you only have two usually, do you carry those repair kits? I’ve broken all my weapons at once and been left stranded, so I’ve been compensating by carrying too many. Trying to figure out how to cut back.
---
Melee weapons are a good secondary weapon to keep on hand to conserve
---
What ammo type do you use?
---
I know :(
---
Aha ! You fool i use candles !
---
Oh! The ceiling lights in the garage certainly turned on! I'm talking about any additional lights that you can add via the build menu. (Neon Letters. Spiny Nuka Cola Bottle Lamp thing. Etc.)
---
Wait, we're half way through?  I've done every daily (minus NW ones) and am not half way done.
---
I mean, why would you expect them to? They're either all seperate buffs with seperate timers, or they're the same buff and would replace each other. What we have is the better of the two options.
---
Whatever suits you mate
---
Your response just seemed kinda hostile
---
I used to do something similar. Put the door in, change the wall. Put a level 0 lock on the door. Place something visible and enticing in the locked room.   Behind the door was a note "Ha HA!  You're wanted!"  Amazing how many people would pick that lock. Constantly had to repair it.
---
Three shotguns, LMG, Shishkebab, Shovel.
---
Primary is Quad Gauss shotgun, backup is AAE Combat - also have a Quad Double Barrel for environments where explosive weapons may be annoying.
---
Primed LMG mainly for SBQ, but is helpful for Scorchbeasts in general, also for Fly Swatter. (basically anything that flies xD )
---
Shishkebab, for Friendly Fire at Rad Rumble, Project Paradise and Riding Shotgun.
---
Shovel for that one daily...
---
Oh! Also, for acid, there is always a Grafton Monster near Charleston capital
---
My candles are superior to your turning of !
---
Speaking of the SBQ, I was playing and whenever it landed, my game lagged immensely but my gun’s fire rate stayed the same so I, for the first time ever, took out half of the SBQ’s health.
---
so far just .308 and .38 (only have a pipe pistol and a hunting rifle)
---
3 Shotguns. One junkies gauss is my main and another Junkies Gauss as backup. Then a junkies explosive as a backup for my backup and also for lower level enemies that i don't want to obliterate in one shot even though i usually do. They only weigh like a pound each.
---
A shishkebab for healing. And a 90% RW grenade launcher for line in the sand.  
---
Try and get a backup weapon with reduced weight.
---
Not intentionally I just dont understand why what pa matters
---
Was just thinking that earlier!
---
What? Wait a minute. Thats how you get that one. WTF. I didnt realize being a spectator counted towards that.
---
I'd be happy with paints that made the items look new. Craft a lmg or some of the PAs and it comes out rusty and beat up, just annoys me.
---
Carnivore can also get the 25% xp from squirrel stew and pretty easy to make if you know where to go
---
It feels like a rat race to get to the end. Extra time and rewards should be the go to here
---
hey man, let your creative juices flow one of these days! Camp building is a really fun angle of the game that is fun about up until the point you reach your budget and then your start complaining to Bethesda about increasing the budget.
---
Any favourites for XP grind? I'll do SBQ, Radiation Rumble, One Violent Night, Line in the Sand, and Encryptid, but those are the only ones that have yielded similar XP to a location grind.
---
Ive recently started playing for the first time and i actually like selling stuff since it frees up stash space. And it makes me feel special that someone would visit my wooden platform next to deathclaw island
---
I used the skin on t-51b. That PA has the second highest damage resistance and it still looked like a raider which suited my theme. It's basically just for the DR/ER/RR
---
Bad luck, maybe. This whole thing is being exaggerated beyond belief.
---
I prefer west tek and abandoned bog town and i try stay away from feral ghouls due to poison and radiation damage
---
Having exactly this problem. I was grinding out some atoms for camp pieces and suddenly a couple days ago it stopped giving them to me when I complete them. No animation, no atoms. It shows them as completed in the challenge window but I got nothing for them.
---
I farm the ones from the queen drops yeah, but honestly my stuff doesn’t break often because my stats are so high I repair weapons well above 100 percent durability, and I specced the lever action particularly to give it the largest possible health pool because it  used to break constantly at first without that.  
---
It takes forever for the Gatling laser to break if I’m not unloading on the queen.
---
I usually forget about fissures. But perhaps because I play melee and I typically avoid anything that flies.
---
Yeah I have had similar experiences
---
I've bought maybe two weapons from people, so pretty sure I have nothing duped
---
I appreciate this. I find (as bloodied) I die more by ghouls than by half a dozen Super Mutants firing at me at once.
---
The one vid showcasing it on YouTube has it on his fort plus I have seen people do it online. Next time I'll have to ask them lol
---
We're in week 2 of a ten week season, who knows what this cats going on about.
---
Good to know, thanks 👍🏼
---
An explosive flamer, a bloodied DCG, a BE lever, a B2525 Fixer, and a BEWR 50cal.
---
23.
---
Or else it gets the hose again.
---
He didn't
---
nope it doesn't work while crouching...
---
mostly because Agility perks are so nice. No one minds stacking all the rifle perks in Perception. But Stacking all the pistol perks in Agility? You lose out on soooo many other important perks if you do...
---
I think the option to switch event markers on and off was added a couple of updates back. The new update just set them to off for some reason.
---
Yea I seen alot of people have that happen. My wife made fun of me until it happened to her and she threw her controller
---
It's not a two shot variant is it? I use it semi auto and it doesn't seem to break faster these days, I know when I bought this for 5k caps back in the day it was unusable by any measure because of everything you just mentioned.
---
Now, I don't even use gunsmith with it especially after sbq started dropping 150% repairs. I have two explosive lasers, one je (probably duped as I bought this week for caps) and my fe250 both run the same mods:
---
-Prime capacitor
---
-Split beam
---
-Long barrel variant
---
I also always aim torso, because the shot results in a tight grouping and the explosive effect does something funny, in the sense that the visual graphic sometimes show the monster get hit - and it doesn't die for a split second -, then the explosive effect takes and melts things around it. Almost always using vats. If I aim torso and miss it hits legs, arms, head, etc. If I aim head and miss sometimes it flies over the head instead.
---
So even when I "miss" in vats , the tight ball of explosive energy ends up around the thing and most things generally die in one shot. I think the behemoth took 3 today.
---
More info: in one of the latest updates I think for some guns if you move while in vats, changing the accuracy percentage  the shots will always miss. There have been a few other posts of people talking about this topic. Solution is to exit vats and reenter.
---
The best test something is fishy about explosive laser guns is i have a tse HM and tse combat shotty. Both are unusable these days... somehow the explosive laser got so good it became my main.
---
If I don't feel like using it, I use a junkies lever, which can one hit headshot things, but its slow as I need to stay in stealth. Don't have that issue with the legacy laser.
---
We're in week 2.
---
The season is 10 weeks.
---
I dont think you know what "halfway" means.
---
Yes. It should continue throughout the event. If anything, they can boost the dailies to 11 or 12 during the limited SCORE boosting events
---
308 can be found in good numbers on mutants. Grafton dam and the prison, which are right next to each other, both have large low level mutants populations 
---
38 can be theoretically found anywhere, so I wouldnt say there's a much better place to find it then another
---
Turned 29 today
---
In the cave under Tanagra Town there's a bunch of crickets guaranteed, pretty fun to server hop and see how fast you can get up there
---
Fissures and the Burrows. West Tek is good, but I’ve ran it so much that I’ve just started getting tired of it. I know everything about that building. I get lost in the Burrows, and I have a fun time trying to find my way around. Makes it more interesting for me.
---
Im a bloodied junkies build and i use my junkies explosive 15% faster reload lever action and with adrenal reaction and all stealth perks i can do 1380 damage with one shot
---
Since a couple of patches before wastelanders!
---
I get chastised when I try damn just dailies and I hear "you play that damn game too much"
---
I play on ps4 and the servers have seemed to have had a good number of people on them. Granted I only play maybe 10 hrs a week and I just came back from like a 6 or so month hiatus. They're not full but enough players that its noticable. Just started nuclear winter so I don't what the averages are. Played a match earlier with like 51 people
---
You all are amazing! The plans finally spawned. My thanks to each of you. The only information I could find was still stating their name was glitched. Hooray. My diner can be completed.
---
This will become possible when Legendary perks come out.  Note that I didn't say "Easy" or "Probable".  It will be a major grind to do, but will be an option if you want it bad enough.
---
*Unless they change it.. Again.*
---
The legendary "Special" cards when upgraded fully will allow you to add up to 4 extra points worth of normal perk cards to their assigned categories, up to the current total limit of 15 per category.  Meaning theoretically you could equip a max of 15 perk points in almost every useful category.  Fully upgrading them will take massive amounts of cards to scrap though.  Don't expect to grind enough to max out more than 1 or 2 cards in a year or so of grinding.  But think about the rewards if you do.  These new cards IMO are a game changer, and convinced me to no longer hate the new legendary system if they remain as described.  I'm actually very excited to try to upgrade some of them.  Universal builds would become doable and I like the sound of that.
---
Can you get ballistic bock or nuka dark?
---
That's been broken all year!
---
Fair. Only mentioned as he was using endgame builds as reference. For a long time you could trade b2525s for legacy guns, so i saw them as equivalent. Duping in last week throws all things into chaos due to the bans, but I'm one of those who don't dupe and started playing in 2018 so had a few guns kicking around.
---
Edit: wanted to focus back on the OPs point which is heavy str builds over rifle per builds. I'm arguing perception builds can hold their own, as endgame weapons allows flexibility for perception to be more efficient with a non-spin-up legacy farm gun (bloodied would be ideal) that doesn't rely on sneak, while still using your excellent bloodied hms and fixers on explosive resistant foes.
---
I'm just saying unless your him......
---
You're just salty he finished before you😂 dude can spend his money however he wants go sprinkle your salt somewhere else
---
oh that sucks, sorry to hear that. My cat never openly complains about how much I play!
---
And even worse my daughter's got into the grind so we team up and momma yells at them and me we play too much games
---
well, it shows up as a single line with a single timer. You don’t see 4 lines on your pip boy, just one line with the timer of the newest buff
---
Yup probably that's why
---
On mobile you hit the three little dots up top and one of the options Is for flair. You can choose your faction there.
---
I haven’t logged in yet today. Will soon. I’ll let you know.
---
Anywhere from 2-8. Dont have any weight reduction perks on since I recently min-maxed for pure damage output with heavy guns and commando
---
Week 3 and week 5 will be halfway so were approaching halfway. I agree it's a tad early but why try and get more dailies after it's too late
---
The other part of this conundrum is that he STARTED like 25 steps ahead of you.
---
You mean pre waste Landers. I played before the major update and it worked just fine. It looks like they tweet a few things when they updated the game to try to make it a little bit stronger but they made it too strong.
---
Nice! I've been able to get my Bloodied Bone Hammer to do the same. Makes grinding so much easier.
---
If you go to the main page of r/Fo76 and click on the three dots menu by the search bar, you'll see a section that says Change User Flair, just select one from there :) there are a fair few to choose from
---
Yeah go play something else instead of lingering on reddit ,you seem to be pretty bored atm tbh
---
This is the sort of way I wish passive NW players played, not just standing in the centre of the map along with 9 other players constantly jumping up and down to avoid being kicked for inactivity.
---
It looks like they auto flagged certain suspicious items and you've exceeded a permitted amount. A suspension allows them time to investigate with theoretically less backlash than instant account bans. 
---
I see 2 options, either take a break and wait it out, or appeal immediately which may (or may not) push you up the list for manual checking.
---
Like... that's just your opinion man
---
Use powered doors - I always close doors at camps even when I didn’t open them.
---
There is a possibility but it’s mostly the good stuff. This last dupe has been out for a long time.
---
Thanks!
---
They added the new public teams for a reason, so people could team up for stuff like this and take advantage of the up to 12 extra free fast travel points around the map that being on a team of 4 provides you. If you joint a team chances are at least two of them have tents placed at XP hot spots. You can also offer to buy food buffs from higher level players if you can't get some of them yourself. I have been giving people free stew who have been asking to buy some.
---
 I don't do most of my xp grinding on a private server, I do most on a public because the spawn density is better. Yeah, some places get farmed dry but if you watch your map before going to a spot you can usually avoid choosing a place where someone already is. Make some friends in the game though, and when they're on their private server ask them if you can join them. Most will let you.
---
If you are under level 50 the easy solution is to level up. It's only about 3,800 xp per level till you reach level 50, which goes pretty quick, especially if you tag along to some higher level events with a shotgun and tag stuff and let other people finish it.
---
Also, obviously they aren't going to tailor a system like this toward people who just jumped into the game right now. Next season will be the season for them to try to max out. They want to give their existing average daily players a challenge. They also aren't going to tailor the season toward the people who play very casually. I get that some people can only play a few hours on the weekend but that's why the double XP and score events run on the weekend. The people playing 5-7 days a week don't need the double xp and score events to finish this on time, most of them will be done weeks early as it is.
---
I would just continue to pester them on twitter.  Just keep at it, create noise.  That is likely the only way your going to get anywhere.  It's pathetic how bad Bethesda is.
---
  Coming here and complaining about it is not going to go the way you want and bring visibility.  Posts like these would get several hundred responses back during the 1st ban wave. (but always suggest it is something you the player did wrong)   Many are gone now and most left are apologists or just accept Bethesda poor behavior.  
---
They are always screwing stuff up in this game every single update.  Like their methods for banning would be any better.  
---
Just keep pushing them on twitter and ask why their support is so terrible.   That you just want someone to follow through and actually give you some customer service in a timely manner.  Keep pushing them, you have an unresolved issue.  They can make time to fix another screw up.  No reason to be shy about it.
---
 Forgot to add I play on ps4
---
Gamer tag: Orochin-Kinn
---
I prefer the circus and atom shop one they look better also don’t see why people cant just close a door it’s common sense
---
I mind the time gate less than things still breaking. I think there’s been some steady improvements, but I’m getting sick of the setting. 
---
I need to grind out a few dozen Imposters and queens so I can login daily just to buy gold for a while.
---
Make sure to have serendipity and nerd rage and when the nerd rage thing appears you will know you are at 20% health which is perfect for bloodied
---
I sell for 3 but I don't know the resources it takes to make.  What's the going rate?
---
I'm on playstation, and the servers feel pretty populated to me. Im always in a public group thats filled, and there is plenty of player vendors up
---
Lol they anything but sheep. When I suggested people should scrip the legacy weapons or risk being banned I got alot of hate.
---
I think most of the bans are people buying duped weapons even if they don't realise.
---
I'm only there for the score man, sorry.
---
Thanks
---
Which one is it?
---
You cannot see all the people on the map.the dots mean nothing.drop a nuke see how fast 30 or 40 players just show up magically.look at the map roster to see how many people are actually on the map.
---
I suggest going to Morgantown airport and killing scorched, grabbing yourself a shotgun if you're low on ammo, scorched typically drop like 6 rounds and if you arent a terrible shot it should take 2 to kill, unless you melee or use a different weapon and just farm those shells
---
...or you can ask anyone for 38 rounds or 308 rounds and they will most likely give you a few thousand 38, this community is very nice :)
---
it’s always a great feeling when something like that happens :)
---
&gt;Is being banned a bad thing?
---
*insert crying face behind a smiling mask meme here*
---
I doubt my zealots grognak ax is duped and a spiked fire ax so I'm good lol. I've never found a God level weapon in a vendor let alone on my own.
---
6 my Gatling plasma, gatling laser, flamer, cryo, LMG, and 50cal. 
---
This is only recently as I had no idea the significant difference the “Bear Arms” perk could make, it’s a game changer for me.
---
Over half the events I attend, most of them are on the ground all scattered in one area and deplete her health in under 10 minutes...sometimes less...this has been proven that it is bc people are standing on something...thats the only bug I see here
---
lol yeah you must be new. Patch note bug fixes are RARELY true. Or they're fixed this patch, and come back next patch. There's a patch note about Ward staying put now, did you see that one? Yeeaaaahhh... dude still roams everywhere.
---
And I've seen Zombie spawns multiple times in the past month, so no, it's not fixed.
---
... but you’ll get the same look of a raider no matter what power armor you’re using. I could see using it if you were using it without a skin, but there’s no point in using one of the lowest resistance PAs in the game if you’re putting a skin on it that completely changes the model
---
Haha I'm melee as well. I don't have a great build but once I pop some chems the SB is dead fairly quickly. Just have to wait for the damn thing to land.
---
Its not hard to make. It doesn't even require gunpowder, the going rate for all ammo is 1c.
---
Just did it today and she still landed at least 3 times
---
Bloodied Deathclaw gauntlet. 3 star. 
---
Furious explosive light machine gun. 3 star
---
Bloodied Pump shotgun. 3 star.
---
You’re probably right lol. If it makes you feel better, I never found a god roll on my own either and I played for almost 2500 hrs
---
Yes, we are all so convinced that those grapes are sour.
---
But will they make them not want to give support because I keep annoying them?
---
Exactly.i see tons of players during events or sbq.then poof gone.then again during another event.some are just sitting and waiting or crouched.you canmot see them.you have to open the map roster to see how many there are.
---
Pretty sure he moves 1 space per day you can see when he moves if you look at the bottom right of the legendary run just under the board there's something called the "zorbo blaster" or something which shows when he next moves 1 space. Also he started on the board at around 30 or so
---
Could u cripple her so she stays landed
---
3. Junkies guass magic shotty, junkies 40% mole miners gauntlet, and junkies fixer.
---
It means that someone on the server already has a camp nearby most probably.
---
20
---
I regret finding out I could go level 1 to CP levels with alchemy and enchanting writs. By the time I did that with my second character, I walked away from ESO. it’s been 2 years.  It’s probably worth checking on it.
---
Around 10 or so. I only need to carry 1 at a time but it’s fun to just switch between all my heavy guns whenever I feel like it
---
But if you’re a low level you probably just need 2-4. Depends on your build
---
Yup if you bought duped items so they will ban you. They will probably remove the offending items and give you your account back.
---
If you stay your camp is saved until the next time you load into a world it can be placed
---
It’s more of Bethesda trying to make extra $$$ by forcing players to have to spend atoms to complete the board. Already a lot of players are asking when they can buy levels, it’s stupid that they are asking this and not asking for Bethesda to make it easier to complete the board. 
---
It’s clear that a lot of people don’t have the time to complete the challenges, but a lot of the daily/weekly stuff (atleast like 80% of them, some are like NW which some players might not want to do) can be completed in 1 hour. But, it just doesn’t make sense for them to force you to have to get the XP to get Score, since there’s that repeatable XP challenge which rewards 100 Score per completion. The XP challenge should be something that isn’t needed, but it’s there so players can passively earn Score and if they played a lot, it’ll reward them.
---
Also read a lot of posts by other people, but yeah, a lot of fools who think that “oh I earned all these levels and it’s only been a week, I’ll finish the board easy”, they seem to forget that it takes more Score to level up on the board as it gets higher and higher.
---
Are people over reacting? Maybe. But is the Score system poorly done? Definitely. Atleast make it more fun and less grindy if you wanted players to complete the board, or make it more rewarding. I’m personally not a fan of all the ghillie paints for the different types of armour, there could’ve been so much more potential for different skin rewards. Also, it would’ve been great if atoms were more commonly awarded on the board or if it gave more atoms.
---
It does. Lol I'm at like 500 hours and pretty casual so I'm happy with what I have, tho I would like to one shot things
---
I use a readily available *mod that shall not be named* to do this now.  It is very, very helpful. I'm not promoting it, just saying that it exists and admitting that I do use it.  Glad to see that Bethesda is working on a version of their own.
---
I just like being able to see outfit and display items
---
you gotta be at least level 30 to get my help now. tired of wasting resources on people who don’t even learn how to play and then just blame it on the game being “broken” and sure it’s broke in some ways but you don’t deserve to talk about that until level 50 plus and have experienced it
---
Yesterday sorry too late homie
---
I dont see it being that bad since most games with a battle pass feature makes you pay just to get in then you can pay more to skip ahead. This is atleast free to everyone and totally able to complete without paying as long as you keep up on challenges
---
Only thing I use 1st for is the extra weight and the little bit of extra atom I get at the end of the month
---
Yes I found this out the hard way. I also use Born Survivor (only level 1), which also helps keep me alive. It uses alot of stimpaks though, since it activates at 20%. But if you only keep diluted, you can get 4 out of each 1 regular with chemist.
---
You guys are making it to the second half? I’m not even 1/4 through and I’m playing everyday
---
That's what I don't like. I play for speed: run, jump, vats, kill, repeat.
---
Maybe the streams weren’t doing too well? I was watching him every time he streamed (almost nightly) about 1.5 months ago, then I went on vacation for a month and came back and saw that he only streamed like twice a week.
---
I did quit really trading a long time ago because I knew them really good weapons were just unobtainable so I just casually played with what I had
---
I just sell all kinds of aid.people eat that stuff up because of the buffs.so i started making them because shit i need them too.lol
---
Vffr50dr gatlin/HEfr .50 cal/extFFR15VF .50cal/ I-40PA-40LDPA Grognak axe/ AA LD 90wt gatlin laser/ VE250dr LMG....I never can choose
---
I'm high level and these are the three I did. But I grabbed the Grafton monster near hemlock holes, he's a lvl 30, it's his snally gaster buddies that will get your.
---
Approximately 8 weeks until it wraps up. It was stated to be roughly 10 weeks long, and we've just passed week 2, so there's still time yet.
---
Thats good but i cant use it due to if i remove one perk card my build will be messed up or i will become over weight
---
It’s 30% bonus xp not 60%
---
This made me laugh out loud at work. Everyone is looking at me. I am pleased.
---
That’s really cool there is a mod for it....now if only I could get my PS4 to have mods lol
---
Also surface to air and distant thunder should they pop. Fast.
---
If you have them, berry mentats as well.
---
Only the basic beer you find as world spawns.
---
Each section of the map (Forest, Toxic Valley, Ash Heap, Savage Divide, Mire, Cranberry Bog) has a level range for enemy spawns. I listed the zones in order, but basically, once you hit the Savage Divide, max level enemies can now spawn. The spawns are based on the players entering the area after the area has reset, and will remain at that level until the next time it resets. There's a lot of highlevel players hopping around now, so it's pretty normal to see max level enemies anywhere Savage divide and east. You can try server hopping a bit and try your luck that way, or go back to the lower level zones and grind there for a bit more with events and such.
---
supposedly this system is being changed in the near future with a system that scales everything, but we don't know how that's going to play out yet.
---
Who cares? Seriously, if you did nothing wrong like you say.  What the hell do you care, you should be pissed off, right?  I would be creating new tweets each day until they fix their fuck up.  Like that response they gave you on twitter, we have ensured your ticket is with the proper team.  0 was done to help you out.
---
I agree wholeheartedly. I want them added to the Legendary pool...granted, they don't have a level, but come on. A quad stringer with VATS Chance and FR would be awesome. Add a frenzy mod or one that freezes enemies like the Cryolator. I would farm for that all day.
---
I have an electric chair that kind of looks like a throne.
---
For starters, you are on Xbox and Microsoft are very quick to shut down third party software and aim bots. 
---
Secondly I average 5 kills a month in NW so if I was using a 0 damage cheat then you would think I would be cleaning the map and have more kills to my name no?
---
Thirdly, less than 30 seconds after I downed you and your mate I got taken out by another player. 
---
And lastly there are some damn good players in NW on Xbox who regularly clear the map using skill alone. Yes there are some quick scopers and nube tubers but that's what you deal with on MMOs. 
---
It doesn't hurt to lose a few matches in NW. Rather than send  threatening Xbox [messages](http://imgur.com/gallery/4JIaCrF)to people, how about you either just roll with losing a few matches or put some more practice in?
---

I'm a Bloodied Gunslinger currently with no Bloodied weapon so I carry a mix for different jobs - Meat Hook, Pipe Pistol, Pipe Revolver, Pipe Bolt Action, 10mm, Gauss Pistol. 
---
Might seem a lot but they are light and so I'm not weight restricted or perk reliant. Each has its own capability and the mixture of ammo types means I never have to worry if one runs low. If I ever get the ideal legendary versions I may thin it down a little but atm I'm just having too much fun - who ever thought a pipe pistol would be good enough to run around the Ash Heap or take on parties of Super Mutant?
---
nevermind i found something
---
I don't think that's the issue. He has gone radio silent across the board. His streams (dating back to last week) were always #1 on Fallout 76 Twitch and every lobby was packed with fans who were rolling through SBQs, Encrypted, Project Paradise, etc.
---
Perfectly worded.absolutely correct on prices.
---
Since you start out with 6, the actual limit is 56 usable perk points currently.  So with all legendary SPECIAL cards maxed, you could conceivably equip 84 points worth of standard perk cards.
---
Yeah I got mine from the purveyor and freaked out.
---
Was that not last week levels? thought it was level 45 by the 20th?
---
I just tweeted them now asking wtf is going on.
---
Yeah your right.
---
Happy birthday!
---

---
Thanks, I've been looking for info on these guns for a while now I'm going to give it another try perhaps without the automatic receiver, probably just hardened then.
---
 This is why I consider it a public service when I stand on flat ground, pop psychotats, and use my BFFR gauss minigun as an anti-aircraft weapon. The single barrel might look like a giant fire extinguisher, but I have the range of a sniper and the fire rate of a minigun.
---
My mortal enemy is the one who starts the ending of the event before I've finished running around getting all the packages.
---
Super sledge
---
Assaultron blade
---
Gauss minigun
---
Gauss shotgun
---
Gauss pistol
---
And, a Handmade rifle. Sometimes I carry a fixer too
---
I crossed over to the second path on the day that they put this in. I honestly thought that's how it was supposed to be, and it made sense to me to do it like that. Well shit..
---
I messaged whoever it was about it afterwards so if you got a a message about it then that was me.
---
As someone with a phobia of bugs, fuck bloodbugs and Stingwings and bloatflys
---
So what happened to all of my stored items in my CAMP?
---
The 1st option isn’t really viable for people, with everyone saying people will be receiving account wipes. Not sure if it’s true but I wouldn’t be taking that chance if I was banned
---
For carnivores squirrel stew gives the same XP bonus as cranberry relish!
---
I bought the game during the steam summer sale and am level 33. I haven’t bothered fixing up my camp yet or really anything with building. Any advice?
---
I want a Knockout mod that would allow me to get up close and personal, and pretend to be Steve Irwin in the apocalypse
---
It's very frustrating.
---
Isn't it 2% per INT? 30x2 = 60? I'm not including other bonuses like food and mutations which make it higher, just a rounded figure in the context of the post.
---
Man if only I didn’t already have one 😞, plus are you on PlayStation or other
---
On my main, a JFFR RW .50 Cal MG, JFFR LVC LMG, Junkies Bash RW Fixer, and a Quad Bash RW Handmade. Sometimes a JFFR RW Radium Rifle.
---
I mean, you're using a heavy weapon. Boot up that power armor and equip Stabilized and go to town in the nuke zone.
---
He's a rolling pin
---
None? Why would they? All the good MMO's have endgame gameplay loops that are enjoyable enough to usually keep most players engaged until the big new content drop usually once a year or so. Coupled with good smaller updates and events.
---
You a bot trying to associate ages with accounts so you can better target their accounts with ads?
---
Just kidding, I'm in my 20's, gotta keep it sorta on the down low
---
I've never played NW. Do berry mentats work in NW? Are they even in the game? Or is it just luck of the drop?
---
What’s the deal with the bear arms perk?
---
Yea crit multiplier only applies to base damage regardless of any dmg boosting effect. That's why "50% more damage" doesn't translate into your crit shot being 50% stronger. Same goes for better criticals, it only affects the multiplier in the crit formula. 
---
As mentioned, bloody mess &amp; grim reapers sprint are good replacement options.
---
Love surface to air. If you get a good spawn eater that's 5 SBs.
---
Is the 2nd one legendary? If not, I’d say go look around for a 1* or bad 2/3* junkies or anti armor you could get cheap, probably 1k caps or less
---
Tier 64 is is halfway till the end in terms of xp

I will go into your camp and inconvenience you by placing my power armor down in a door way only to pick it up when you give up and go to another door.

I'm VATS Rifleman but starting to get the commando perks. I did get that mod too. Is it OK for Rifleman too?
---
Appreciate it
---
Wow, I'm super jealous. In the past three days I've fought the queen over 3 times and every time it failed because we didn't have remotely enough damage. Even with several players who were level 150+. Just had one today where she mutated with 2 minutes left in the event. It's been brutal.
---
Well, if you don't finish one, it'll stay in your quest list after the reset opens up another one, until you complete it. This is true of all dailies.
---
Oh ok dang
---
I get they were regional drinks, but it would be interesting and make for a good tribut or throwback to the older games.  There could be a couple missions that could be more comedic to go with it.
---
Don't skip leg day
---
Well you were talking about the bonus from unyielding which only gives you 15 int not 30

As a more OCD player I hate my garage has a sliver of health missing with 5k of repair mats in the box. Please let me repair!

I have about 30 weapons and I’m not kidding. Most of them are heavies and they weigh about 2 lbs each+ mods. I have the heavy gun 90% reduced weight perk and I usually keep some rifles and melee that have 90% reduced weight like a bloodied Shepard’s crook for free range for example. I have like 5 different Gatling lasers, Gatling guns, Gatling plasmas, miniguns etc.. i even have a freakin broadsided that weighs 0.00 lbs for some reason because it was 90% reduced weight before the perk kicks in...I have a problem. Gonna start selling them off eventually
---
Just a quad? I think I picked one up last week. PC.
---
I heard he joined ZZ Top recently
---
Finally someone with the guts to help
---
I have watched angry turtles videos on magic weapons, and managed to craft a gauss minigun with magic mods AND another one without them. They both feel the same, just melting any sort of enemy. You don't even have to be a bloodied build, it still gets the job done. I have solo'd SBQ with the non-magic gun and a prime receiver. Took \~2k bullets though since she hardly lands now...
---
Would highly recommend getting your hands on a penta barrel gauss minigun.
---
Good luck, I have heard some horror stories in the past about how long it can take to get them to remove a temp ban.  Hopefully they won't remove any of your stuff in the process.  Let us know if you are successful.  Someone else might find your post in the future the next time they ban someone they should not have.
---
I just listen to Appalachia radio on repeat 😂 sometimes I switch to classical
---
Theres no response from Bethesda on ANY post EVER that criticizes them in any way.
---
I’ve been playing since day one. It was always a team fight for me.
---
Yeah I have to carry a lot because of ammo running out, and also they’ve all broken in one session and left me stranded.
---
Sorry but I’m an Xbox/PC player
---
Yeah, not looking for anything super fancy. PC.
---
Cripple the wings or freeze.
---
I see plenty so arktos. But the other 2 yes I agree
---
Hmmm... a brotherhood of steel sentinel vs. a raider asshole, addicted to psycho, wandering the Appalachian hills with a portable civil war cannon firing explosive rounds
---
Well at rank 3 it decreases the weight of your heavy guns by 90%... now I have so much carry weight available.
---
I carry 3 Bloodied 10mm for low level, Instigating Fixer for everyday, and BFFR Handmade for the heavy lifting
---
Monster Mash has a trophy tied to it...
---
not really much advise other than "if you plan on having a pet a some point only build in the forest where lv50+mobs wont kill it in 2 seconds"
---
These are good events but with so many new players and so many people banned/ starting over the higher level events are empty at the moment
---
A purist I can respect that :D
---
I have a phobia of molerats. One time I decided to kill myself  with a plazma grenade than kill some of these creatures with a plazma gatling, They just appeared to hit me from the back and disappeared in a sec. Another fun is being killed by radroach while u use PA.
---
Oh boy, uhh, I'm at rank 41 concurrently, with one weekly challenge left (apart from the recurring). But I thought it was a bit... closer than that? Either way, I appreciate the info and the surge of optimism, as the later items do look pretty darn tasty.
---
1- A furious combat rifle
---
2- anti-armor homemade with scope
---
Both gifts from a generous high level player
---
3- level 35 instigating crossbow that I got from Fasnacht . It’s a one hit kill, use it mostly in forest or against scorched areas
---
4- Two shot Tesla for mobs and close quarters
---
5- Prime Railway Rifle for SBQ
---
All rifles because I use 9 perks for rifle cards
---
Is he looking for some tush?
---
OVN is great on a private server with friends. I won't do it on a public server anymore.
---
I didn’t know you could get one of them during the introduction
---
Just more scrip limit along with higher xap limit. 30k is rediculous. 1000 scrip over all (150 a day ) is rediculous. No more currencies either.
---
i always have a stash of halloween candy that i use for exactly that reason!
---
Good call. I’ve been popping so many berry mentats lately that I forget them!
---
Yep, I've got one. IGN Tazier2, what's yours?
---
Which I can never get for some odd reason. I completed that event so many times. I currently have 1500 bubble gum for that event.
---
Yeah, not all. There's a reason i quit Destiny 2.
---
Wins are wins.
---
I am leaving a one star yelp review. No hot running water. The deathclaw Wellington was a bit overdone as well.
---
I'm at work currently, but I can let you know when I get off in a few hours if you're still available.
---
Wait is Destiny an MMO? Since when? I thought even Bungie themselves are against calling Destiny an MMO? I've never seen it labeled as an MMO.
---
That deserves gold but I'm broke so $$$
---
I love Monster Mash, it's my favourite event!
---
6. I’m a bloodied shotgun build. There’s a park that reduces shotgun by 90% so I have a Swiss Army knife of shotguns. 
---
I also have a Flamer for healing and a bloody plasma for boss creatures 
---
My gauss shotgun is for DPS, my sniper shotgun is for range My fancy shotgun is for fun in my vampiric shotgun is to get my health up to 56
---
Gotcha thanks
---
Prob 2nd or 3rd week in August  , I believe 22 is the big one in September
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Sir you have the wrong place we dont serve dethclaw Wellington, sorry to disappoint
---
Just logged in and all challenges are there thankfully.
---
One violent night is good, arktos is superb. They're empty for different reasons in my opinion. 
---
OVN s empty because everyone wants to farm the mobs not play music so it takes too long. Then because of the competition, people spread further and further out of the barn to sit camping the spawns so noone gets to shoot anything or do anything.
---
Then there's the one twat who camps the wendigo spawn and one shots that as well. 
---
Arktos is a bit time consuming, and a bit daunting if you aren't used to it. I avoided it a lot as a lower level because I didn't know the layout or what was going on half the time. Easy to die too. The rewards are good but it requires coordinaion for the best stuff- something that is hard to come by, again especially now with XP farm and whatever. 
---
Monster mash is pseudo PVP and it's been well established the vast majority dislike that in the game. I don't know exact details about it as I haven't done it myself since not long after release, but I don't think it's worth the ime unless you're doing the eating pre war food challenges that come along.
---
I should be able to, sure
---
no, the standard (and prime) receivers are for rifleman (semi auto). the automatic one is for commando.
---
unless you meant whereas the railway is good enough as a semi. in which case, definitely. it's just that it goes from "strong" to "look at that damage" when you put the automatic receiver on.
---

---
Instead of a core since that doesnt make sense with a ballistic ammo type, how about crafting a drum of 2mm EC. Cant be used with rifle or shotty but has different craft recipe/amount/weight. Only issue id see is how ammosmith should effect it since it would craft a set amount but it suppose it cud just craft ‘overfilled’ drums like INT does for cores.
---
Old enough to know better, young enough not to care.
---
downing and killing players, playing aggressive and win: 1100xp  
---
better take the risk and win 1/10 matches or have a single win in 100 matches. either way, your math is not correct. i play aggressive and leveled within one month to 94, finishing rank 100 tomorrow.
---
Ive noticed more are starting to signal they got their hit in by a thumbs up emote and Im starting to adopt that myself. I honestly have never had anyone one shot the captain in that event yet. Everyone has always been good at making sure everyone gets a chance. The other legendaries that may spawn sometimes dont always work out that way though and I dont blame anyone because I myself have inadvertently one shot them before realising they were  legendary and felt like an arse.
---
I grew up with a black and white tv and a rotary phone. Ford was still making Mustangs, and candy bars were a quarter.
---
Oh that sucks. It's definitely a pain in the ass to do solo.
---
One spawns to the east of Watoga like just East from watoga marketplace I think across the river a bit
---
Sure it’s more fun that way, but it’s easily doable solo with a good build, which most high-level players have anyway
---
Sometimes I wish they'd add some tunes from the other fallouts. When's 3 dog get his own station?
---
Furious ffr handmade, troubleshooters explosive fixer for mr. gutsy and assaultrons. 
---
Instigating “magic” shotgun for up close and personal farming spots like west tek.
---
No, it isn't. It is a piece of piss. I managed it 'solo' at maybe level 30.
---
You run around, pick up candy and shoot mobs. Hell, you can hide in one of the bathrooms for 15-minutes and it is completed. Just make sure you pick up the mask beforehand.
---
I'd have to disagree. All three events are fun, and quite rewarding
---
I can imagine. I lost 11 hours of playtime bcz I stuck in a van. I tried to switch to normal mode in order to help me out with the console and when I got back to survival mode ... there were no fresh saves.
---
Your Camp should still be stored the way way you last had it. All you have to do is choose a new world if you want it up
---
I didn’t ask you personally to write a thesis on why I should jump back into the game. I specifically said “if you have the time to spare”. Mainly just looking for someone to explain what’s changed about the game before I jump back in. If no one cares to reply to my op then so be it
---
Agreed. Even besides the SCORE system, it's actually been giving me something to do in the game besides grind reputation. It's nice to have some goals to meet, and the more there are, the longer I play. That's what Bethesda wants, isnt it?
---
&gt; someone who doesn't know better drops their ore early
---
Can you explain this? I feel like I’m probably guilty here
---
Got insta killed today by a scorched tick, they are brutal 😜
---
Damn I didn’t even know that, I’m still on my first character. Even knowing this I’m not even tempted purely because of the fact that I have purchased this game with so much content it’s as if it’s endless at this point in time and as a result I’ve been taking every zone heaps slow, enjoying the separate zone stories - because they all seem main quest material in all honesty - and I’ve really gotten into learning and shaping my build.
---
If you haven’t played for 2 years I highly recommend you go back.
---
I say GG, WP.  And this is from someone to plays NW the traditional way of murdering everyone ;p
---
So, that's why people are suddenly buying my arrows and bolts. But crafting them would be a waste of plastic and adhesive, really.
---
Wulfy you jerk. You don’t join me anymore.
---
You could manually repair the floor it's on and then try and pick up the remains into your inventory. Then you should be able to repair all at once. Happens with grain with me.
---
Pretty much what I'm doing until I get bored of playing pretend store and go live on a cliff face somewhere to RP a hermit.
---
I've now configured my NW character for total defensive and survival, no offensive.  I'm having more fun with that than losing every time I have to shoot at someone.
---
Maybe? You dont sound sure about that.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
[removed]
---
That’s true. Alot of it may just be a personal bias and me having extra fond memories of 3 and NV
---
Laser gun unfortunately doesn't have hardened so you need to use prime to get the same damage boost. The damage difference is only 30% though so if you have a bloodied explosive variant it might have already been overkill without it :/
---
That and the 95% VATS thing is pissing me off so badly.
---
The only way I'd justify using it is when Bethesda fixes the ammo converter
---
I don't remember the exact level. It was between 30 and 35.
---
This is why setting up camp in a popular spot can be a headache sometimes
---
Sure, you "found them for sale".
---
And my uncle works at Bethesda.
---
That might be the thing that soured me most though was the fact that they make you pay extra to get the classic solo experience. Maybe I’m just stuck in my ways haha
---
You select them in the Atomic Shop. They don't change until you move camp either.
---
Arktos - needs 3+ half decent players who read the instructions. Too often recently they are after xp kills and don't actually do the required tasks and it fails at the first round. They then think it's too hard when it just needs teamwork and a little thinking. 
---
Monster Mash - a love/hate event for many as it can become very pvp like if multiple players attend. But recently this is rare and tbh I like doing it just me vs the ghouls. I think it's location also puts some off as its a long dangerous hike for newbies who haven't completed Mayor for a Day.
---
Violent Night  - it's become problematic. The predictable spawn points and entry paths means it's dominated by PA Heavies outside the shed. It can still be fun solo or with just a few players but if many turn up its shortcoming really come to light so they instead just avoid it.
---
Still think we need a gun that turns enemies into squirrels. Syringer would be good gun. Only need special syringe ammo.
---
That’s not that bad of an exploit though. You could get double that in the amount of time spent loading and unloading 20 times
---
They could also be buying them because the bow is a fun new weapon and they think the ammo is expensive, like you :-)
---
But if not for ammo, what are you using that stuff for?
---
I've got a .50 brotherhood recon rifle, junkies fixer and an anti armor grognaks axe (just in case). Got a handful of bloodied heavy weapons I'll pull out for the queen but other than that the Fixer and the sniper rifle are all I ever use.
---
750 gold for that shit? Hell no, play the game
---
Comment ur user if interested
---
3
---
I put the values in brackets, didn't care to elaborate
---
Or FEV syringe that turns them into mutants
---
The only gun related bug that i had is me shooting them having 1 hp left and heals it all back like 3x before.  (i do over 500 damage so anything but sbq dies one hit or suppose to)
---
I used to overlook the arrows and crossbow bolts and stopped picking them up but now I dont. Im also actually pleased to get 40mm ammo now as rewards. They are among the best conversion rates and helps me add a bit to my .50 stash
---
Servers are soft capped at 24.
---
47....damn
---
Have you met Bustma yet
---
\&gt;server hope 20 times
---
\&gt;20 times
---
\&gt;you got yourself 100 5mm
---
\&gt;100 5mm
---
I mean
---
on top of that I must have spent like 8 hours converting ammo into fuel
---
How’s the 40mm conversion rate?
---
lol
---
OVN and Project Paradise are good events, people don’t do them for a few reasons: 
---
OVN: Either nobody shows up or the whole map shows up, and inevitably some dude is there one shotting everything. Rubs a lot of people the wrong way. 
---
Project Paradise: This event requires a bit of thought, communication and cooperation. Nobody shows up because apparently asking people playing a multiplayer game to...play together...for 10-15 minutes is a bridge too far to cross.
---
An FEV syringe that has a chance to mutate into legendaries would be neat
---
Wait a minute hold up ... lunchboxes stack ??
---
I have a feeling that anyone that repeatedly purchased duped items from someone on their friends list must have also been tagged.
---
Shoot loading screens alone would take over an hour to server hop 20x lol
---
Anything that's not a solo woman strumming an acoustic guitar.
---
42
---
Just an FYI- The Sugar Bombs produced by the Workshop wont work for Brain Bombs (a +3 INT , 90 HP, 300 AP  Boosting food). You have to use the Sugar Bombs with Rads.
---
oh i see haha I missed out on 2 weeks worth of stuff. Guess I’ll be hitting up the west tek and whitesprings again for that xp. Really want to Get everything as I am a collector so I’m seeing a lot of grinding ahead. Might try the queen runs and get some legendaries at the same time.
---
This is honestly one of the dumbest exploits I've witnessed someone document in an earnest way.
---
I think there are bigger issues they should address before this
---
As far as I know you prolly won't. I have that mutation and a fixer and I practically move just as fast in sneak as I do walking. Pretty sure it caps out if you get the mutation but I could be wrong.
---
Funny, I cant move cores to save my life. For every full core I sell 50% cores for 20-30 caps and they just sit. I sell a lot of common ammo including strangely enough, lots of .38 and .44
---
Gotcha
---
That’s likely due to the fact we can’t cripple her wings. Doing that keeps her on the ground for a significantly longer period than it you don’t. Of course, having her limbs be crippled meant that you’d often have the thing just stand there menacingly.
---
Honestly, I’m okay with not being able to cripple the limbs, but it needs to just alternate being in the air/on the ground, because it’s stupid that it can’t handle it as soon as you stand on a fence.
---
It only resets the word after maybe 3 minutes I think. I use private to transfer items to my alt
---
oh well I'm at 39 but when the double score weekend arrive when can compensate if we don't get to 45 till 20
---
Wait until last 30-45 seconds to deposit ore, because the higher reward levels spawn harder creatures. If nobody drops ore until right b4 the end, you only get ghouls, can cripple them, and have controlled spawning of easier enemies for same reward.
---
The earlier you deposit the ore, the harder the enemies, and more likely the scavvers will die.
---
;)
---
Yeah she's not the brightest queen in the land.
---
most of the good stuff is duped, though. if you ever bought or traded for something remotely good, chances are it's a dupe.
---
It probably stacks
---
Foundation quest. if you sided with the raiders without doing the settler stuff you missed out on some things
---
49 in the running for the oldest? Lol
---
Well, then its still a grind. Biv gives much more than basic beers
---
I think it may have been a part of a settler’s quest but I could be wrong. I didn’t side with them. I thought I read that somewhere though...
---
I can build you one. 
---
GT?
---
Violent night is great as a duo, same with any horde event. One person does tickle aoe and the other cleans up. The problem is that 2 people at an event tends to attract others and it ends up as a pissing contest.
---
Me to.
---
A pc player speculating about xbox newbies and doesn't know about playstation... did i miss the crossplay announcement or what is this post even about?
---
Spoiler:
---
&gt;! Part of the settlers quest line !&lt;
---
It is indeed part of the Wastelanders stuff. Did you not do all quests for both factions before having to choose one?
---
Well crap. Thank you.  Had I known I would have gone Raiders.  Thank you.
---
Good question I will say not that it’s a big deal but it bothers the shit out of my inner self when ppl share the same perk thinking they stack ...I share barbarian just because it’s sort of uncommon
---
I need the blueprint
---
Smh.
---
Halfway is the beginning of week 6, end of week 5.  We're in week 2.  We're not even halfway to halfway and yall acting like its the end of the world already.
---
At this point I consider the winter fur lined jacket to be the rarest outfit in game right now haha sooo much xp to unlock that ..
---
I didn't win but i did AFK once and forgot about the match....
---
Apparently it spawned me where the final circle was going to be and i got 2nd place just standing there the entire time.
---
Just celebrated the 19th anniversary of my 21st birthday.
---
Another problem is staggering. If she is starting her landing animation and gets staggered in the air, either from one gun army or a series of headshots, it resets the animation and she won't land. If you see the landing animation, stop shooting until she drops.
---
You get the best xp rewards the longer you survive, behind winning the match. The way experience is doled out is wholly flawed
---
The vast majority of the time it's just a normal hard liquor or one of the basic Red River/Old Possum/etc beers, all of which the collectron will gather.
---
I'm on rank 50, I think it balances out with the plan.
---
Does sped demon effect stealth negatively?
---
A good way to keep track is the enemy piece moving along the board ahead of you
---
Honestly, most of the NW playerbase does it
---
You just have to deal with, as the only way to give out their position, would be to give out your position
---
As far as I understand it (and I may be incorrect), all effects are multiplicative but at what point they begin to have diminishing returns is not well understood aside from a few values like DR. I believe in your situation these effects would stack.
---
No I didn’t.  I chose before finishing them. My dumbass.
---
Sun kissed for trolling is good
---
If you can be the leader of the team be sure to be in building until the last second and switch to event team and then switch back when the event is over. You keep the bond for the x4 even when you switch to capitalize on the bonuses too if you didn't know already.
---
Thats why I'm saying its a grind. Most of the time its beers when people really want nuka dark or ballistic bock.
---
Don't bother. Cushioned is the only mod worth getting on the legs if you have Speed Demon, and even those are meh. The others are just useless.
---
I share/use that unironically
---
Kinda useful
---
I have between 6 - 8 at any time. Hunting rifle, 50 cal machine gun, 10mm auto pistol, 10 mm standard pistol, combat shotgun, combat rifle, and a missile launcher. I change play style based on whats in front of me and who is beside me. If i need lower damage or higher damage, ill switch quickly. 
---
I really need to drop this down to 2 or 3, but deciding what to keep has been a chore.
---
I was once in a group where two people were sharing max inspirational. The experience boost was amazing. Sadly I only have 4  charisma, so can only share a one point card. If someone in my group is sharing inspirational, I will also share rank one. If not, I run rank three for myself and share rejuvenated. I figure giving a bit of AP and hit point boost should be useful.
---
What does gt mean
---
Wait only 1 is supposed to be available at a time? For the last couple weeks I've done all 3 everyday at the same time has this been a glitch?
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Power_armor_stations
---
Fire proof, glow sights, vaccinated, adamantium skeleton, action boy, bloody mess are all pretty top tier share perks that are universally useful
---
Also good for those kill multiple legendaries S.C.O.R.E.
---
Complete the mission for excavator armor in the ash heap, Garrahan headquarters. You unlock the plan for free there. 
---
Otherwise. I suggest moving this post into a trading sub, this one isn't for buying/selling things
---
gamertag
---
Heh yeah there's a way bigger exploit involving ammo machines going on so I'm gonna stop there and call the troll.
---
Perks like these are the bane of a Bloodied builds existence. If you're on a team of full health players go for it, but if you see someone with a bar 80% filled with rads I'd suggest switching... Unless you're like Kolinee over here trolling the Wasteland one perk at a time lol
---
Nope, her wings can't be crippled anymore
---
I don't know where people got the idea of account wipes from*, I've seen nothing from official or reliable sources that even hints at that.
---
For non-Dupers who are just unlucky enough to have a limited number of dubious items then editing them out and releasing the account is far more likely and less controversial. If that's deemed impossible to implement then a roll back from archives may be possible so you lose some but not all progress.
---
Tbh it's all speculation atm but resetting everyone who's suspended to day 1 accounts would be a PR disaster if they didn't try other less severe methods first.
---
Edit * of course this is Reddit. It's Best or Worst case scenarios only with realistic options for the crazy fee like me.
---
Ok good to know. I like to shishkabab the people and collect ore, but I hadn’t heard that before.
---
Yeah I'm too low level
---
Personal preferences but I like carnivore as the buffs with scorchbeast meat suit me. Brains for int, lung for Agility (helps the stealth), heart for endurance. Strange in numbers increases the buffs to and with cooked scorchbeast meat I get 500HP so even as a bloodied build I still always grab 1 to 2 pylons during encryptid which I tend to do after a few queen runs any way. The xp buff is definitely easier to farm for herbivore with cran relish but carnivore does have the equivalent of tasty squirrel stew but getting the squirrels isn't always easy.
---
Edit: oh and with carnivore radstag and Brahman give +50 carry weight
---
Toads and ants give +20 carry weight (though rad ant lager is an option for ants)
---
Ahh Bethesda... well played
---
yep, I have a full set.
---
Hey my friend was um, talking about his farming route for legendaries too. He said he uh, um had the best route. Do you mind telling me your route for my friend?
---
Haha me too. I made second place hiding in the port-a-potty at Morgantown airport not long ago. I do always shut off the auto team though.
---
Yes
---
Then level up. It's a double xp weekend, perfect time to hop to events and tag enemies for experience
---
Honestly the 4 ways to win are:
---
1. Bush camp till last one and kill last guy
---
2. Have ur whole team left and just murder last people left 
---
3. Be a loser and hack to win
---
4. Sit in a puddle the whole game with lungs perk
---
Shared perks don't stack unfortunately. If someone is sharing Inspirational 3 you should just share a different perk all together.
---
Plasma and pulse nades
---
K thanks
---
I found out the price and I'm just gonna level up
---
I understand doing it, but doing it with a team is just scummy af.
---
Don't hate the player, hate the game.
---
Eventually. When this season is done I’ll check it out. I’m trying to cut back on my Xbox time. It’s too easy to settle in.
---
congrats man! about to hit mine on Sunday :•)
---
Check out [nukesdragons.com](https://nukesdragons.com), they've got a perk/character builder there that's nice to plan an endgame goal around (as well as be aware of what's available, and when).
---
Minmaxing isn't NECCESSARY, but there's a VERY strong argument that everything in the game gets easier the more damage you do. And I'm not just talking about killing things... this game has a lot of consumables and maintenance aspects. More damage=less ammo used, less weapon degradation, faster kills which means less damage taken so less meds used for healing, less armor repairs needed... faster kills on one target mean you don't get swarmed as more targets close in in response to your attack... faster kills means faster clears means more time means you can "do" more ingame in the same timeframe...
---
twice I've noticed this, same
---
The only sandwich they could probably make is mayo and cheese but the mayo would be too hard to spread for them
---
It sucks for sure, but it's in the bushwookies best interest to queue up in teams. It's 3 people that aren't trying to kill them.
---
The truth is even selling legedanroes at a reasonable price people won't reslly buy them as much as you would like, its best to undersell so you can get them out of ur stash quickly
---
Use it in VATS, on full charge
---
Put on enforcer in the agility slot
---
=Profit
---
3 Dog wouldn't be alive yet during this Fallout
---
I've got at least one, but it's really not a good gun. The legendary effect is very very poor, it's basically barely a step up from a nonlegendary 10mm SMG. Now, 10mm SMG's have a coolness factor, but they're missing some very important things like muzzle attachements (no silencer) and sight mods (no reflex sight etc).
---
Why? Real question how does someone hiding in bushes affect the other ppl on the team?
---
I guess if Biv actually wants either of those. Today it was Red River Ale for me and there was one in my collectron's box.
---
Uncommon perks seem like good choices, I like that mindset. Personally I don't think perks that increase DR are particularly useful (at least to end game players that already have high DR equipment) but I'd rather someone share one than nothing! 
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
 the alpha monster for me as a melee that thing scares me I tag him 3-5 times and stay away lol. that is the most hard hit I took to this day, 2 hit I'm dead I can even tank the SQB queen but not that thing.
---
I think its 5 for 70 points. Im always finding that crap in my inventory because its a frequent reward drop. I just make it my end of session ritual now to run my ammo spoils through the converter
---
Yeah I did one of them
---
Try as you might, you will not get me to stop being afraid of clowns! IT scarred me...
---
A lot of these events don't give rewards that are worthy of the effort that goes into completing them. So they're just not worth playing and wasting resources on (ammo, stims, etc).
---
Very true but I don't use bloodied weapons and my best weapon is a two shot, 50% crit damage plasma pistol.
---
I did buy it but I doubt it was duped.
---
I saved a lot of canned beef stew from Feed the people just to use this weekend. Been in my inventory for almost month. Over 200 across 4 characters.
---
I miss him... even when I shot him in the face a few times
---
Good to hear.
---
I'm personally almost on S.C.O.R.E. level 41 now, with one 1000 point weekly still to do, without having farmed any XP at all for the 10000 XP repeatables, just doing the usual daily stuff (1 level and challenges) thus far, so I can't really complain too much about the 2000 points that went into limbo today, since I seem to be where I should be as far as the math behind getting to 100 goes, and since there's a double S.C.O.R.E. weekend coming, and Bethesda has even promised more dailies and weekly quests to the end of the season.
---
Having said that, it might get frustrating if it started happening every day, as it has for some people for a while now.
---
So, here's hoping the "more complete fix in the next few days" they promised in the ItV will get rid of any remnants of this bug.
---
gauss will miss the first shot in vats like 99% of the time. You just got to get used to it until it gets fixed. I barely use the charge on it. Can one shot level 91 deathclaws.
---
If you want to get that stealth bonus go into vats, then exit vats, then enter vats again. It usually lets you get that hit.
---
Also. it's not every 1st shot in vats. It's like. First shot in vats of an encounter and then it's msotly fine.
---
It's mentioned in detail above.
---
Ill be as rude as I want because I think its insulting to put basically a "is this game worth playing" post up. Im tired of seeing these. If theyve never owned the game i can understand but you already own the fucking thing. Install it and form your own opinion!
---
Uhm that saying is for opponents not teammates who intentionally sabotage you.
---
Heck ya!!
---
Ugh, I get that too. Shoot too fast with a shotgun and no damage.
---
I only play it for the score. Once I complete the challenge I leave till the next days challenge. 
---
 Queuing up on a team is 3 less players trying to kill me when I'm just trying to complete my challenge. No interest in NW, only the score.
---
You win at “Fashion”
---
What was the timer on when it happened to you? If you remember
---
Uhm which is stronger, a 4 man team or a 3 man team?
---
Happened to me the other day! I was saving I Am Become Death for the perfect opportunity, but while I was randomly exploring Watoga, Death From Above triggered and out of the blue I received the trophy for completing the final quest. Because that isn't game breaking or anything. Gotta catch dupers, yo! 🙄
---
Nice never knew there was an option!
---
They can damage friendlies?
---
Yoy can buy it in whitespring resort from one of the vendors, don't remember which one though.
---
Easier than doing the excavator mission
---
I guess.
---
Wow I have never experience that. I even have my own super weapon outside bloodied and junkies in the form a furious plasma flamer that once a critical hit is triggered will do absurd damage.
---
I can see it health drop considerably while I do it.
---
What part are you referring to? I did that quest a long while ago so I am not remembering. I do know some deets about MODUS and the enclave in general though and spoilers if you care. 
---
&gt;!MODUS kills the human enclave members because Eckhart (president of Appalachian enclave) was becoming a dictator and unable to stop his human subordinates from rebelling against him which made MODUS their prime target. So to prevent himself from dying, MODUS went into kill all humans mode and is only working with the player in 76 because he knows the scorchbeast problem is a serious threat and has no human agents left to do what needs to be done!&lt;
---
Its a rare drop for every one of the alcohols he asks for
---
But we can kill her in 20 seconds if she stays on the ground that long.
---
Maybe they send him back in time😂
---
Rewards are mediocre at best........ you said it
---
I find "skeet shooter" helps a lot with the spread. Also angry turtle put out a video I think it was today about the gauss rifle and if you listen to the tips he gives about a method to use vats you probably could get that to work real good.
---
Fashion
---
I dont know, but you just exposed yourself as a NARC. 
---
NARC!
---
Paraphrasing, I only care about myself, I will fuck over 3 other people to get what I want.
---
It’s basically an MMO, just a hybrid version. Fallout isn’t really an MMO either if Destiny isn’t.
---
&gt; Trying to make Bethesda fix anything
---
Good luck dude
---
Thanks for the input! I avoided sharing perks like Bloodied Mess and Fire Proof because I assumed that most players (or at least a significant number) are already running them. Glow Sights and Adamantium Skeleton are two I hadn't thought of that would also be universally useful, but less common. Thanks again for your answers.
---
Cryptic
---
Usually 2. A 50 cal and an UGL, though I've burned through so much ammo that I've had to swap that out for a Gauss minigun tonight.
---
I'm going to tweak my character once the ammo for those runs out into a PA Commando build, but I'll stay with 2 weapons for that, a Vampire's HM and AA combat rifle.
---
Yes I have two in fact I have four pieces I'm hoping to get the left arm eventually.
---
Isn't fallout always survival by any means necessary? You got a well earned dub as long as you ain't actually cheating then it's a good win
---
I mean, some of us play more than others. I bought it, because there wasn't much else to drop gold on for me. I'm not chasing SS armor since I live in PA, I got T-65 just for kicks but I'm never going to use it, I already have the Gauss Minigun and the Plasma Caster... there isn't much else I actually \*want\*... so now I just buy whatever.
---
If you do the daily "photo opportunity" that can be started by talking to the overseers robot (forgot his name) and choose to take pictures of crater you can turn the pictures in to ward at foundation for a bit of extra settler rep each day. I dont think it's as much rep as vital equipment but every bit help!
---
I can't remember 100% but I'm pretty sure if you store the item and re-add the item back it'll go back to full health.
---
When it comes to NW correct.
---
Pay for time and laziness perhaps but where are the "win" aspects that give him a greater advantage over others?
---
Yes, that is why I play to kill people and win.
---
I don't know what you're talking about, I've done his daily lots of times and have only had to craft something unique maybe 3 or 4 times.
---
Oh whew lol, I figured they wouldn't be this cruel/poorly implemented.
---
That's how it always was though. The FT gauss minigun was an end game item with very rare ammo, you couldn't use it casually unless you spent endless hours grinding and resetting the shop. It was pretty much always just to whip out and try to kill a boss in one turn. Weapons like the gauss minigun and LMG aren't meant to be used as your only/primary weapons for killing every mole rat you see
---
What time do u get off
---
Do the monster mash event when it pops up as Halloween candy counts as well and it’s weightless so is good to save for whenever you need it
---
You fix the issue by actually using your cores up instead of reloading every 10 seconds lol
---
No. Most account that get banned are actually mule ones, used to dupe items.
---
Do you remember about how much it cost?
---
My biggest pet peeve is teammates that don’t melee AI (especially since they seem to have really bad detection these past few months).
---
Funny u should ask just smoking before hoppin on
---
I have an unyielding left leg, unfortunately it has no other stars:( I still use it though.
---
Life continues and I find myself in the 5th decade of mine, but I still have some way to go before reaching a big 5-0 and starting decade 6.
---
So I'm not the oldest in the thread so far, but I'm definitely not the youngest either!
---
you guys know how hard is to get an[mutation] ss 40% ? or if those 2 can't be on the same weapon?
---
Yes you have to replace your camp down to make them work
---
Oh really?! Thank god, I thought I was losing my mind.
---
Dude what the fuck is a Battle Pass
---
Why I moved from white spring to bum fuck map edge, got tired of server hopping for a spot lol
---
Funny how you sought out to defend your self when I mentioned no names and I have video proof, but you stick to your story. Too easy to do the wrong thing over the right, and innocent people try SO hard to make them selfs look so innocent. But you keep on with your story there bud.
---
I get that. Too many players looking for handouts, it's like feeding wild animals; suddenly you have a pack of them helplessly following you.
---
I dont cater to them anymore, but I'm more then happy to give info.  If it's clearly an innocent noob player asking a legit question I'll hook em up. A lvl 34 asked where I found my dcg so he can get his own.. Heck I threw him my spare legendary dcg.
---
I might agree they need more challenges, but that's not the same as giving out first place as a participation trophy. Makes it sort of meaningless for the ones who grind it out, maybe it doesn't need to be TOO casual.
---
Besides they give you enough atoms to buy your way past another 10 levels or so, use them at the end when they count more.
---
I think we are on the same page but I .. I guess I've spent to much time in Everquest and similar games where if you put the time in you could acquire the gear.  Here even if you do put your time in, RNG could just hate you (really it hates me.. or rather feeds me nice non trade-able rolls for builds I am not to tease me.)   
---
Since I refuse to pay real money for a weapon in a game I'll never have the fixer I want, so I will have to gamble with mumbles for it.. oh wait I'm already doing that daily with all the script I can hand in for my left boot (which will need repeated with the right one at some point both of which only have 50% reduced fall damage as useful stars.. really)
---
I don't mind grinds, hell I love them if they're wrapped up in fun events and similar.  (we need raids so bad, can't wait for patch 21)  Its the grind for no reward that is my issue.  Anyways sorry I come off so harsh.  My frustration with the RNG is boiling over a bit.
---
You need a SSD my friend.
---
But with OCD perfect placement is time consuming. Those of us with issues just wanna hit 'repair' not replace everything after each mob....
---
Why create a masterpiece camp only for one mole rat to make sure you see nothing but health bars everywhere you look 5mins later.
---
True, but at least there's now a use for moldy food.
---
It looks to be about 500 caps. It's probably lower tho
---
That's actually a reality that might be incoming because before in the last PTS you could do the Colossal Wendigo Event when you nuke the mine but this time in the current PTS every 4 hours the mine nukes itself and 8 players can go into the mine and you basically going to separate instance so now the whole server can't just ganging up on the boss now so yeah assuming this get implemented as is without changing it in Patch 21 a Colossal Problem Event is also going to be timed too.
---
Ok
---
Why are you even using doors they're useless.
---
Yeah. It’s happened to me a few times now. I guess their supposed to be tracking it so maybe send a ticket in so they know to look at your account. Beyond that they don’t seem to have the tools to fix it or give you score.
---
In case you are being serious. The Legendary Run is basically a battle pass. its what these 100 levels of rewards has been called since they started in games.
---
YOUR sweet prince
---
25 years young. This thread is surprising me, I imagined the ages would skew younger
---
September 8th at noon EST.
---
Was on 7 diffrent servers tonight and none where empty
---
Yes. I have a full set.
---
Some people mains got banned cuz they never thought of a alt but that’s their problem
---
Auto team fill should be off by default and require a button press to turn it on instead of the other way around like it is now.
---
you might have your events confused, in monster mash you get waves of about 3 ghouls every 20ish seconds, you don't have have to fight them if you don't want too.  It's tedious but not hard
---
&gt; You can debate saying how Bethesda is just busy looking through the suspension emails and investigating people’s accounts which yes is a possibility but me literally tweeting and sending another ticket asking for a resolution for my suspension early within this wave and STILL not getting any kind of response about my ticket or update is ridiculous.
---
This is the worst nightmare of every person working in service and support. Everybody thinks they deserve to be on a priority list. The only thing you did was add more things for them to sort through before getting to your ticket. 
---
This is a big ban wave since so many people grew secure with cheating, most of them are spamming up support tickets pretending to be innocent to try to avoid bans, and just in general bethesda has barely ever banned anybody so they're likely not used to doing anything of this scale. There was only one ban wave early last year that was anywhere near this big. They already told you in the email they sent you that it might take up to a few weeks, even though people were already getting emails about suspensions being changed to permanent yesterday. Let them do their job and stop making it more difficult, they already get that all the time by working for a company like bethesda
---
All of the items I care about are "My \[such and such\]".
---
Please don't. I use arrows and rely on buying them.
---
Yeah, as far as I know it's a bug.  It happens to my fiance's account too from time to time but I've never gotten that glitch pwrsonally and I've done the Camden park daily religiously pretty much since launch. 🤷‍♂️
---
i mean would you rather have 46 or 49 people trying to kill you
---
Do you think you could use a similar strategy to how you addressed the autocomplete bug and implement more extensive logging to help?
---
I’ve gotten 2 legs and a torso of unyielding, but no luck with the arms. I’ve burned through 70+ legendary modules and I’m losing my patience.
---
True that.
---
Fair enough.
---
What about harpoons and spikes? Iirc they only cost steel to make and the exchange rate for spikes is 10 points:3spikes. I think its 7 steel per 3 spikes, so that's 1400 steel for 2000 points
---
You dont get friend requests?
---
Psn:  egroegy
---
Yeah you're right, I had an issue where I wanted to place a stash box and it disappeared but still used the budget so I had to pack my whole camp just to discard a single item.
---
The build menu should have an item management tab so you can select individual items to repair or discard.
---
Very nice
---
You really don’t need to charge it up. The damage increase is minimal. 
---
Try using ‘Skeet Shooter’ in Perception.
---
I was definitely one of those people who said that helping new players is their end game. I have stopped helping anyone below a certain level now too. After building so many basic camps, low level weapons, given away stims and radaway. Almost every time I log in now one of those people had friended me and sent a message asking for this or that. Be nice just one time to get a message saying thanks and btw I have been helping newbie's too! Or even better "hey you helped me out big time when I started out I now have these useful weapons you interested in any of them. You get first dibs!" But no it's "hey I'm really low on caps is there any way you would buy this water for 10k?" Ha! No.
---
Do you know if I can equip Chem Fiend, take my stuff, the. Pull the perk card for something else and still get the bonus time?  Sorry for all the questions
---
Yours too
---
&gt; Syringers need ~~more~~ any love at all
---
FTFY
---
I do Charleston DMV.
---
It's almost like the old Whitesprings Golf house where the ghouls come to you.
---
Hit the terminal when you enter then again when you leaves gets you 8-16 more ghouls.
---
Even better there's a skip from after you pass the ID stage and it leads to the mainframe... then you skip from the mainframe out to the last hallway. 5 minute nukes all day.
---
Usually, 3 weapons: a Mutant's Gauss shotgun, a BFFR handmade and a BE 10mm auto pistol. All of them are primed.
---
Happened to me to with this quest. It was one of the few I was kind of hyped to do too
---
That has nothing to do with Public Teams, and it doesn’t actually finish the quest for you. You just get the achievement.
---
Dude I got rekd by a 1 star legendary stinging yesterday
---
The only downside is if you have an atom shop skinned item and you drop it then the item gets destroyed. If the item is Favorited the prompt is bypassed by the atom shop "Do you want to drop it" prompt. Imo it should prompt once for Atom shop and once for it being Favorited.  
---
Or just remove the atom shop skin when the item is dropped
---
I’ve done it in Apex twice before and I’ve seen a lot of other people do it too. It involves a lot of luck but it’s possible.
---
No it's the part where you activate the kovac and it sends down the cache and just when you activate it and he says what. What is that  with a long pause it's not the scorthbeasts btw I don't think
---
They aren’t intentionally sabotaging you, they’re hiding in bushes because the game mode is boring and they just want the rewards/to do their dailies
---
No, they don’t do hardware bans, credit card bans, or... “you” bans (since they don’t know).  It’d be nice if they got THAT serious about duping.
---
Just added you
---
Fools? That's just your opinion, man.
---
We're 1/5 of the way in and 1/3 of the way through the board. There's double XP coming, Bethesda added 50% more quests for the rest of the week, and they'll probably do it again. Meat week, who knows what else.
---
If I don't finish? Well, they did give me enough atoms on the way through to pick up another 10 levels or so (at the end, when the levels are worth more). Call me crazy but I think if I play every day and complete everything but NW it's all going to work out somehow.
---
And if some people don't finish? Well, it ain't much of a race if everyone comes in first place.
---
This is a bug that's been out since the beta. Back in the day they were called no star legendaries. They used to have legendary in the name and drop a random 1* (or a flare gun, or a drill, or a syringer). In typical bethesda fashion, this was never actually fixed; they simply swept it under the rug by first removing the legendary drop, then removing the legendary tag from their name. These enemies still exist and used to be indistinguishable from normal enemies, but with wastelanders you can tell from this message. Also, that's why some robots explode on death despite not being disabled and not being labeled as legendary; they are secretly legendary but the game hides it from you
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
If you want help building the excavator armor, let me know and we can do that to get you through it. Also, leveling up can be assisted too.
---
Depends what we're doing. If we're fighting the SBQ, I share Tenderizer.
---
I figure it all helps us do more damage to her. (It's not much, but it's something at least)
---
46 here....GTFOff my lawn!
---
Takes a little vetting I gave a kid a berserkers lever action.  he had been waiting for the game to come on gamepass for weeks and was very educated for a new player I could tell he had been watching videos. A little ahead of himself, mentioned how he’s working toward a bloody build with a mole miner gauntlet so I hooked him up and he was ecstatic. anyone can have a few stims or some radaway though i’m not a monster
---
No but I know that at least on ps4 you need to lodge a ticket w/ them to unlink your ps  account from bethesda.net to log into a new bethesda account so they can refuse if they want to.
---
If that's your plan, wouldn't it be a better idea to price say 100 rounds of ammo at 30k each?  Pretty much impossible for anyone to buy that out even with some friends. :P
---
I've got a 600+ song playlist on spotify that has a bunch of 80's synth pop and new wave and hair bands. Plus They Might Be Giants, Tech N9ne, Ween, Violent Femmes, Soul Coughing, Twiztid, lots of Pink Floyd and Yes. As well as some Sacred Reich and Vio-lence. It's all over the place but so am I when I play so it all works out.
---
... they’re displayed ingame
---
Once the players that can play 10 hours everyday gets to level 100 maybe they could get like 50 atoms a level or something.
---
Hey at least someone ended up with the junk. If you die after the queen all the stable flux you just earned gets tossed into Oblivion. I f*ing love that when it happens.
---
It happens. As a higher level player sometimes it’s hard to not kill things. It happens by accident often, but there are jerks out there too. Try finding a basic tesla rifle and it will arc your shots between targets and help you get hits on everything. If you’re melee, consider carrying a shotgun or something to be able to tag targets from a distance. Also you can get more intelligence points so you can rank up faster. Broiled scorchbeast brain, shielded casual under armor, unyielding armor, etc.
---
Just one of the many things that needs some rework
---
I know how you feel, switched to another game for a month but then I got pulled back in lol
---
Funny how the dupers use that exact same justification
---
Well if people don’t want to eat it they can leave it in people’s camps that they don’t like lol
---
My son was playing last night and a player dropped 50 large presents for him. I’m sure they were duped but he was so excited. He is still talking about it. This is a truly awesome community.
---
Hate this. I'm 111 but I deliberately take my low damage explosive gatlin so I can do enough area damage to claim a kill then I get on with objectives of event. Regardless of your level good players can if they want limit their damage output. You don't get any more experience for damaging or killing a monster so just hit it sufficiently enough to get xp and loot and move on. The fasnacht event was the worst for it.
---
The problem is not level 100+ players (after Lvl 50 it doesn't matter anyway). It is just bad game design. Everyone wants to do the event asap to get treasury notes etc and get out. There is no time to search for Lvl 5 weapon and search for legendary just to low hit it once. 
---
I think that once the event starts, it should "lock in" the players who were present, and make loot share-able to all characters.
---
Cuz it's one louder.  It's from the This is Spinal Tap movie.  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=uMSV4OteqBE&amp;feature=emb_logo
---
Even on my SSD it would still be a good 10-15 minutes
---
That's the point of this running for another two or so months with 9 dailies now. You also have double score weekend and the bonus extras on the last week or w.e. If people want one level per day spend some atoms instead of demanding more dailies to make up for not getting an endorphin hit after getting a score lvl. It's an unpopular opinion probably but it's true.
---
Tbh I kill everything moving, my guns all 1 shot any gear you get at lv 32 is meaningless and you should be happy with the exp. I went through the same thing when I leveled up I just tagged what I could. After a while I started doing more damage as I leveled up.
---
I started yesterday and h there where a lot of other low levels there too what it a vendor I have no clue what that is
---
As she sits mindlessly watching TV or reading a book. Hey at least this way your problem solving and improving hand eye coordination lol
---
Post the video then and let everyone else see it and they can make the decision.
---
You drop a bag full of loot on the ground and expect someone not to pick it up? Sounds like the blames on you for that one
---
brooo dont let it get out :( I spent the past 9 hours doing this and almost have enough 5mm to kill a scorchbeast now
---
I'm one of these newbies and I have to say, this game is legitimately terrible. Please stop giving your time and money to it. There are much more successful games in this genre that are far more performant and far less greedy in their content. Conan Exiles comes to mind, Ark, Rust, Mincracf etc. Please I beg you all, give up on this game now.
---
If you insist
---
West-Tec!
---
25,000 EXP (I can complete the run in 6 minutes)
---
Potential: 2-6 Legendary spawns / 
---
100x 5.56 rounds per run /
---
100-600x 5mm rounds per run /
---
1-5 stimpacks per run /
---
~100 Caps per run.
---
19. F in the chat for all you old mutha fkrs.
---
i agree. 
---
even if there a max limit of SCORE for the dailies, it's nice to have options on how i complete my challenges.
---
e.g. eat random person in NW
---
Someone who has stacks of money can simply buy their way to the end of the seqson instead of just playing the game and earning the score naturally.
---
Not everyone is rolling in stacks of money.
---
Please do and link it on this thread so everyone else can see it.
---
THIS.
---
I'm surprised this is the high upvoted comment here.
---
Literally everytime I've brought it up on this sub, I get mass downvoted by people who dont want to hear it.
---
How did you finally get through to them?
---
That's the most boomer thing I've ever heard.
---
After I found three weapon weight reducing armor pieces, I became a walking arsenal. I constantly switch between weapons depending on enemy type. It's not really necessary but it is fun and it means I only have to repair a weapon like once every three weeks or so and I don't need to make ammo that often if ever.  I switch between full health and bloodied as I get rads, up until I get sick of managing my health and go back to full health. My damage perk cards are set for shotguns and pistols, with a bit in rifles.
---
I have two severe western revolvers, one bloodied and one two shot (I used to have an explosive two shot but tossed it cause it wouldn't get head shot damage, so the normal two shot outperformed it.) These are great against humanoid mobs with headshots, especially back when adrenaline worked.  
---
Two automatic rifles - a bloodied handmade and a furious combat rifle for crippling scorchbeast wings and cargo bots with tormenter 
---
Two non auto rifles - my instigating gauss for sneak attacks out of vats and an antiarmor lever rifle for vats sneak shots
---
Two 90% weapon weight plasma gattling guns, one antiarmor, the other exterminators. These are for shooting the SQueen when she's dicking around in the air. They don't do much damage since they are unmodded, but they only weight .5, so I figure why not carry them? 
---
Two melee - furious powerfist and a bloodied mole miners. 
---
An instigating charging tesla rifle for low level trash mobs and tagging mobs at group events. 
---
Finally two shotguns. These are my 'the sh\*t has hit the fan' weapons that I use when I need something dead right away. An instigating double barrel shotgun and the fancy shot gun. The double barrel pretty much oneshot kills anything except scorchbeasts and mirelurk queens, the constant reloading is a disadvantage though.  The fancy is great when going up against a large group of ghouls and such and is great for crippling legs (assaultrons).
---
Okay, allow me a record it with my phone.
---
not soon enough
---
I’m pretty sure it was the opposite... re applying the mod used to give you the same range as a normal nozzle which wasn’t intended. And I’m like 75% sure they fixed it with wastelanders, or who her recent update that buffed flamers significantly
---
Living up to the username i see.
---
One thing I’ve noticed that seems to help is going into vats, exiting vats, going back in, then shooting.
---
No, you download the original from Xbox and post it.
---
But again that's not paying to win, that's paying for convenience. He isn't getting some new super God tier weapon or any actual win mechanics. It's cosmetic items so he has paid for outfits and camp items
---
Probably a good thing; if the game prioritized kills it would basically just be a deathmatch.
---
First off you arent my fucking boss, secondly I'm not as tech savvy as yall cheaters.
---
Wait was that confirmed?
---
This should also be a thing for the Gauss Minigun
---
You can also go to achievements, see all my achievements,  scroll down to any game, click on it, then go to stats and it should tell you your total playtime. Works on most games (oddly enough fo76 is one of the ones it doesn’t worked on, I should’ve checked that before commenting)
---
Hopefully. Don’t know why people actually like that dumb redneck’s content
---
?
---
...because it's rare
---
except that team of 4 that uses mics and strategically kills everyone just afk, we thank you in advance
---
I had a level one beaver that actually lasted a few weeks of gameplay unscathed. If you live somewhere with low level mobs, you may just be able to enjoy your opossum friend for awhile! Having an ally helps to protect them delicate creatures as well.
---
No but i met ligma...lol
---
I don't know about the time, but the day is right. Legendary Run was announced to last for 10 weeks, then there's a couple week break, and then the next season will start
---
I get that but it was their 3rd day playing, they didn't know the dupe. I know they didn't. One them is a roommate of mine and I saw his inventory before the ban. He was banned unfairly and without proof of him doing anything wrong. He was event suspended, he was straight banned.
---
The fallout community is solid morally across the board. I love the togetherness and helpfulness of people I've come across and also the want for me to help others. Very rare in today's gaming groups.
---
Yo is that true? What things in the tos do they break?
---
Well not everyone is a Chad like you.
---
Oh ok, thank you!
---
On xbox there are a huge number of low level players. I think it is fun. I think that the game pass players are getting sort of a weird introduction in a way with the legendary board game though.
---
Ya know, I'm such a ran of fallout, I thought about just buying the ranks of SCORE outright. But then I realized, if I got everything, I would just go back to complaining on reddit that I want more content. 
---
Remember the months that would go by with absolutely nothing to do, minor grinds that aren't worth the time. I genuinely enjoy getting on every day, doing my dailies and get another reward, and then putting the game down when I want to. I'm excited to see the themes they come up with in the future
---
Yeah it's great, for anyone who survived the banhammer. 
---
The Colossal Problem  Event premiers August 4th I believe.
---
As in your suggestion, the Gauss Minigun as a heavy gun still uses normal 2mm EC, and needs to be addressed on how impractical it is to just use that type of ammo instead of a unique one like you said when the clip size of it is 500 bullets.
---
Totally agree, it should lock 3-4min after event starts
---
delete it and rebuild. unless you already have
---
and move it around
---
Yeah I’m a little bummed. I’ve played a lot, probably too much. My wife is enjoying it as well lol. There were nights I was so bored playing and I’ve been trying to find an exit anyway but I kept hoping I would draw a nice piece from the legendary vendor. That’s really the only reason I kept coming back. So when that opportunity came over the weekend, I took it regardless of the cost. It was my time and wouldn’t have happened any other way.
---
That’s the 10 week mark from the start day/time. I would assume that just like the challenges moved from Atoms to SCORE at that exact time that they will have some sort of changeover then too. 
---
No clue what the challenges will award during the downtime from Season 1 to Season 2, though.
---
Oh bet
---
I must have missed this holotape. Where is this from?
---
Yeah that’s the problem, people + Bethesda aren’t taking into account of players who may not be able to play every day. Should battle passes/season passes be impossible to complete if you actively played every day for about 3 hours of constant grinding? So yes, fools are saying everything is okay but why do you think a large majority of players are complaining about it. Sure they can bring back 2x XP weekends like maybe 1-2 more times during this, but if they take away the extra dailies, then progress would just be even slower. 
---
If you actively grinded and completed every challenge, good for you, unfortunately a lot of people don’t have the luxury of doing so. 
---
Plus the fact that you said “they gave enough atoms for me to buy the levels in the end”, you shouldn’t even have to Lmao, the fact that you’d be forced to spend atoms unless you literally played 76 for several hours a day (without missing a day) and do the challenges + get XP for the 100 Score challenge to complete the board, it’s a little ridiculous in my opinion. There are players who don’t buy atoms or pay for 1st, so having to waste the atoms to complete the board, which may I mention is actually harder to get now, is pretty lame.
---
Obviously I don’t really care about the completing the board and I don’t intend on wasting atoms, it doesn’t seem worth it to me. But I know a lot of friends/players who want to complete the board as a sense of accomplishment. I just find it really stupid that you are so limited on earning Score.
---
It’s clear that Bethesda wants it to be something that’ll make players play the game, since there’s no actual way of completing the board unless you actively played every day. Even spending 5 hours in a single day yields less Score than playing an hour each for 2 days since the main source of Score is from dailies (ignoring weeklies since we are talking about general score, since weeklies can be completed within the week). 
---
But Bethesda has been really stupid about everything since the start of 76 and are all about the $$$. If they were smarter and actually knew how to make a good/polished game, listened to the community, and delivered actual fun content, they’d make even more money than they could imagine. It’s just lame that they’d prefer to have an incomplete game riddled with issues, then expect people to give them money because it’s a “Bethesda Game”, too bad their reputation is tainted now.
---
Oh it sounded like you were saying that I talking the gauss minigun sorry
---
No, there's an issue where it auto-reloads before the core is actually empty. On my gatling laser it will do it at anywhere from 10% - 2% of the core left.
---
I missed a week camping and I am level 35.
---
It's a habit lol
---
Yea u bring up a point that I didn't mention. This is a very good event cus it's so long term not like some things like fasnacht. And you don't get bored of it cus the dailies constantly change. It gives us plenty to do for the 10 weeks it's active
---
The mmo I played the most did have time gated content. It was called “energy” and you would use energy to do activities, and regenerate energy over time. This game was called Black Desert Online. I have 5000 hours in it because when I ran out of energy I could just go do one of the hundreds of quests or grind or something fun... but I was always progressing. 
---
There’s a difference. Here you literally cannot progress.
---
I have to admit the last NW match I played I built a little room, decorated the inside with star wallpaper, added a lamp and a dresser... and sat in there until the burn zone finally made me move with ~10 players left
---
You guys are right about not having to fully charge it. But that first miss in vats is a piss off. Will try going into vats, then back out. I’m maxed out in perception unfortunately, so can’t use skeet shooter. Will watch that angry turtle video though. He has great content
---
I think it's fine. Extra damage should come at a cost, whether is be extra resources or just lower health or addictions.
---
You need to select the one you want in the atom shop and the skin will apply when you move your camp.
---
Its not a great system - it would be far better if we could change it without having to move camp. 
---
Also, make sure the one you want is definitely equipped just before you move - the skin can default to basic from time to time.
---
I totally agree, of course Fallout isn't an MMO at all. I mean heck "30" players playing together at one time on one server isn't exactly "massive" after all lol. Destiny does have a few more MMO elements to it but it's still just a lite MMO at best.
---
I did monster mash once.i accidentally stepped outside and was stuck with the mask on my head for the rest of the session.lol.i had to jump servers to fix it.
---
Come to think of it, Reddit itself skews young so it's possible there's more older players than this thread suggests
---
I think older gen y gamers might be more into fallout because it's an old series.
---
I was playing fallout 2 in high school
---
What? You melee AI.
---
Bot a bad idea but unless I bash them I don't carry melee weapons.
---
I think melee should be able to vats other players, same with pistols. This would give them a reason to be used.
---
Maybe a passive damage reduction for melee too, Something like 50%.
---
You're not alone. I've been suspended since Tuesday, I've responded to their initial email then &amp; I sent them a Ban Appeal Letter today that's a page &amp; a half long. I haven't been home for about a week when I got that Email on Tuesday. If I were to guess. People I traded with before I got off for a week gave me duplicated Weapons without me knowing at the time &amp; that got me banned on Tuesday.
---
I'd say just be patient. I know we're missing out on the Daily Bullion limit &amp; Score but it's better to be patient then to getting frustrated at Bethesda. I've seen other people get impatient on Twitter, Forums &amp; here on Reddit. I'll give them 2 weeks &amp; if I don't hear from them by then, I'll check up on the support ticket &amp; ask on twitter. I've put in over 1000 hours into this game, Paid the Yearly Subscription for Fallout 1st, lvl 300 in Adventure mode, over lvl 100 in Nuclear Winter, Farmed Vault 94 until I got the Vault 94 emote &amp; I occasionally bought Atoms from time to time.
---
If some of the weapons I got from trades are compromised. I'll be happy with Bethesda Removing them if it'll allow me to play again.
---
Script, gold, repair &amp; scrap box's, caps isn't cosmetic btw
---
It seems to make the durability higher when it procs
---
In all fairness, there is a "queue solo" option exactly for this.
---
I'm not gonna act like I don't boosh wookie. I 100% do sometimes.
---
But, at least have the decency to not join a team.
---
i think the standard receiver should be unlocked by default but i’m not positive see if you can take it off you might not have to use ultracite rounds.
---
39.  Sometimes I feel like i’m too old to be gaming but seeing the range of ages in this thread makes me feel a lot better.
---
Burrows
---
You can still do it...
---
That is exactly how i feel about arktos.no one knows how to win it.only if i see a high lvl player will i join to help.
---
That’s gonna be a problem for every ally. I say this because I too have a character parked up on the Seneca Rocks mountains (west side represent!). I’ve tried everything from fencing them in to relegating them to the ground level and every ally ultimately ends up waiting for me at the bottom of the mountain. I’ve talked to them, done their quests, even once in awhile they respawn back up top... but ultimately they’re going to abandon their post. I love the place, but forget allies and tamed animals, that’s the trade-off for the impassable terrain for enemies.
---
But that's exactly what it's supposed to me.
---
You can change your IGN on the Bethesda.net profile page. I changed mine so that I didn’t have the same username as my account name.
---
I never play teams and always bush wookie. I get top ten 90% of the time and top 5 about half of that. "Three less people shooting at you" is just an excuse to be a dick to three other people.
---
Yeah man. I always wanted to try the Be gat plaz and an explosive flamer. Wasn’t a fan of the gat but the flamer was so OP and now I understand why they removed it. That B2525 fixer was absolutely insane as well. I can truely say that was the best weekend I had playing the game in all those hours grinding along. I’m gonna keep an eye out for cyberpunk. Is that out already
---
I agree, you shouldn't have been downvoted for facts lol
---
Pre war publicity stunt to draw visitors to the camp like a haunted house thing, theees a hunting stand with a terminal if you follow the wires
---
I don't have A single offensive perk equipped either. Aquaboy, Lifegiver, Rad resistant?, picklock, less AP used while sprinting, DR/ER while sprinting, and less damage from creatures. I don't remember all of their names.
---
maybe they are confused bcz it is double xp bonus and u are clowning around with some charity. from other side of view i can tell u: great job, bud!
---
Wow that's pretty crazy guess I've been really lucky well thanks for letting me know!
---
Yes. Read the notes around. Follow the wire.
---
Sorry I had to eat dinner and yeah I forgot to change that setting
---
Not the quest...
---
Pretty sure it comes out November-ish to coincide with next gen consoles ❤
---
I think I got to 28 and really wasn’t trying. Didn’t really see anything in the rewards I wanted to work for
---
The extra damage came at the cost of grinding raider rep, or constant rolling to get that sweet sweet God roll. The whole prospect of grinding for endgame loot is the improvements from your current gear. Why shouldn't I want to consistently use it without bankrupting myself? I stuck out the grind, so I want the extra damage. Then in your opinion the gauss shotgun ammo should be expensive right?
---
Very nice. Thanks
---
I like full ultralight for limbs, increases sneak and boosts AP. Shadowed used to be bugged for everything but leather if it's working properly now definitely give it a try. Probably mentioned before but one piece with AP refresh is advised -two is overkill but one for sure.
---
Play on a team at all times, have most  mutations, equip strange in numbers, radicool, starched genes and class freak. 
---
Your gun is just okay look for something with decent second and third attributes, FFR, 50 pct better criticals etc. Learn as much as you can about the crit hit system. Properly setup every 3rd shot can be a critical.
---
Free Flux, two legendaries at minimum, free Improved Repair kits and a chance of fighting the colossus is more than enough to get me to fight her every time.
---
Around the 12 or 13 minute mark, I was running a circuit and checking it pretty constantly
---
making nuke zones pvp would be interesting
---
So I don’t see the big deal?
---
Ugh read!? Lol just tell me
---
I agree!
---
[Sounds like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf7oqgjPJyw&amp;t=9m30s).
---
If so, he is definitely talking about the scorchbeasts as he now has the ability to track them and is surprised. Up to that point he couldnt verify your story and had no reason to believe you. He even says "consider us pleasantly surprised" as based on his knowledge of humans they cannot be trusted.
---
The thing with that is you have to do a damage limit. Sometimes a hit isn't enough to get loot or experience. There is nothing worse when it flashes up a 3* deathclaw legendary name and you hit him once. Get to body to see you can't get loot and you also didn't get experience because of a lvl 400 has levelled him in 2 seconds with a bloodied build. Even the feed the people event at mama dolces I was using my level 15 pistol I don't have buffs for to tap ghouls so the low levels could finish then.
---
I never do that, I always use them up, and I haven't used my gatling lasers/plasma in months. Just wearing power armor seems to do it.
---
In my case i sided with the Raiders but i still did all of the Foundation questline up to the point of no return, i went to the Deep and i noticed it wasn't discovered even if i was there for their quest.
---
36
---
I don't know, the experience I was getting was significantly improved that night. Like I was getting 1700 each from the eating hotdogs and throwing rocks daily. I have been in groups sharing one max inspirational and I don't get that much. I know other ones don't stack, but inspirational might be an exception. I don't know how to test it for sure though.
---
Thanks! Every other hit is a crit but crit is so small because its always just off base weapon damage. I did not know about the powered pieces. Why are 2 over kill? I was trying to get all 5
---
&gt;Yeah but arrows cost adhesive which is more difficult to farm than just getting lead/steel/gunpowder. 
---
Just run the Cranberry Bog with Green Thumb, the pitcher plants give you 8 adhesive apiece.
---
Well for starters the quest walks you through what you actually need to do to launch a nuke... plus it kind of kills the story side of it too
---
I think it's fine, they won't change it anyway.  
---
Why would they make a whole new ammo just to make an op weapon more op.
---
I have no trouble fueling my plasma flamer with clips of 300 round when plastic is a scarce resource.
---
Why should just lead and steel be any different it's very easy to farm the ammo.
---
What are you talking about? What is being reset the 20th?
---
I had this mechanic the other day with a random legendary scorchbeast. it just refused to land and then when i finally got it to mutate, it just randomly flew off in a straight line.
---
Yea I have the standard. Just wondering if I can get better receivers from vendors or if I have to use precious junk on dice rolling LA rifles for a good receiver.
---
Yeah that could work too but I'd prefer a dedicated area for it that's always there to explore and find new loot and monsters. RuneScape classic was the earliest experience I had of when you entered this area anything you have on you can be lost. It just makes it that more tense and exciting when looting. Sometimes fallout feels a bit safe especially at higher levels.
---
I just did it yesterday. It was a pain in the ass and I could only do it with wooden walls but it did work. I had to keep removing walls and replacing them but eventually it ended up working. This was on ps4.
---
Chuck a grenade at the one the Overseerer has in her home and it will pop out?
---
Oh shit I didn’t even realize! Thanks!
---
It seems extremly hard to do as im trying to place another doorway but simply cant
---
Fertile soil in the forest
---
Most LA mods are from scrapping.
---
This is the second post i've seen in less than a day saying almost the exact same thing.
---
Except they said it was from Scorched Earth. Something smells fishy and it's not my feet for once.
---
I believe if you take Chem Fiend off you lose that duration bonus immediately, so you need it to leave it on to get the full benefit. And feel free to ask as many questions as you want. =)
---
This has very little to do with it in my experience. It seems entirely random and I say that as someone who launches between 2-4 nukes a day myself and has experimented with launches where no obstacles can be stood on and no tents are deployed.
---
What is more likely is their own terrain is impossible for it to walk on (those trenches/pits are nightmares for ai).
---
Easy okay done with concrete walls. Just did my camp. Works.
---
It’s up for me today FYI
---
That's not the same one you get from the events Ive got load of the firebreather outfits it's the responder fireman's outfit  you get from event
---
Its precisely so you can't share and both have to grind every single day to unlock all pieces which can take near a month or so plus mods. It's strictly so their daily numbers go up. 
---
Almost all of late game content is this.
---
They look good and fit with my camp
---
My camp budget is full so I'm going to load up a private server and try at a workshop to see if I can figure it out. Shame my wife isn't here, I can't remember shit I did five minutes ago but she would know what I did to get it to work.
---
What is damage on it? My bloodied deathclaw gauntlet with extra claw is 1007 damage before I use any one handed strength buffs.
---
Just wait for the new legendary perks, youll be crafting more than plenty of that ammo type
---
That's too bad just trying to get back into the game and helping my friend who is new
---
I agree that it was genius but I heavily disagree and believe it was poorly executed. Hopefully they improve the many flaws and kinks that need to be worked on in the legendary run.
---
Yeah definitely. It’s just easier to to put these online multiplayer open world type games together than worry about coming up with a new acronym for every variation.
---
Nope. But I guess it could scare them when they see an incoming grenade and run away from the bush they hiding in, because there's no way to tell if it's a teammates grenade or not.
---
I'd enjoy it if you had to ferry over to a new area, but to board the boat you had to lock away all your adventure mode weapons, armor, etc and only use new area stuff.
---
When you ferry back to App you get to unlock your stuff and keep your loot.
---
I guess in a way it's like Vault 51 BR.
---
If it could be traded I would understand, but if you want it, you have to earn it. The problem is that its kind of not worth the grind. Once you have it the chances to get the roll the one you want is so slim that it's not even worth it. A 50 cal is so much better economically. It's the same problem with the SS armour. It takes so long to get one piece uny, let alone a whole set. Combat, marine, or scout armour does the job fine.
---
I personally use Inspirational, Rejuvenated or Tenderizer. The extra XP in group is always nice, even if you aren't doing the public teams "objective", for rejuvenated it's always nice for me and teammates to have that extra health, i don't exactly know if having that extra health will ruin bloodied but i swap it in any case. Tenderizer always gives a good boost on damage. I swap depending on the situation or if there's already a card in use.
---
I would avoid Action boy or Action girl, they seem to be broken for many.
---
Currently having 9 charisma points
---
Inspirational is always a safe bet to share.
---
Strange in Numbers and Travel Agent are also great 1 rank cards to use.
---
Luck of the Draw is a pretty decent one (help people keep their guns repaired).
---
If you're going for damage increase perks, don't go for build specific ones. Go for more generic ones like Bloody Mess or Tenderizer. Glow Sigth is a good one too.
---
If you want to go for resistance perks, go for more unique resistance types (like Fireproof).
---
Um... I guess some perks like Nerd Rage could be pretty good. They're universal for builds, and the effect is useful.
---
Some weight reduction perks like Bandolier or Travelling Pharmacy can always be helpful.
---
Just, don't go for any situational perks (build specific ones, crafting ones, or lockpick/hacking). It may feel useful, but most people have them and can just activate them when needed.
---
As for me? I run a 7 charisma build and usually share Strange in Numbers or Travel Agent. In the rare chance both of those are taken, I'll usually share a Rank 2 Suppressor card or a Rank 2 First Aid card (they're the only other cards in my build I can share, and are both decently useful).
---
But, all that aside... The important thing to remember is that at least you're sharing a card. That's good, and useful no matter what you choose. So, good job! And thank you.
---
I actually found with the fewer dailies, I was not as motivated to finish all of them. Especially when I knew one was always to level up once. With 9, I'm more motivated to do different kinds of activities and find I keep playing until I've completed most or all of them. They don't feel as much of a chore
---
I just did a while ago and was happy it works because i have 400+ candy...lol no more using the 20+ sugar bombs i carry around with me!
---
I had this happen a few weeks ago from line in the sand I believe but honestly it could have been a number of events. I have been really active with the events lately. My husband was jealous...
---
I guess I'm just wishing for some new stuff to look towards besides the little we are getting currently been playing since beta and it really feels like they're giving up adding decent content like enclave missions and enclave items as they are the main story before wastelanders. Tbh I just want the enclave to come in hard and crush everything the bos and settlers and raiders have built up lol.
---
If I can even use them lol
---
Sadly there is still an insane amount of lack in late game content. If you want to have fun play more casual, explore, build a nice camp. Otherwise you'll both get burned out fast.
---
What do you mean
---
I do remember roofs being a problem so you may need to remove those first.
---
Yeah. I think that risk analysis is off. I am, admittedly, horrible at NW. I’m there for the daily score. But I’ll give it an honest try while I’m there. 
---
So far, in two weeks, say 20 rounds, I’m level 7, and I’ve killed absolutely no-one. Whenever I’m seen, I’m obliterated instantly.
---
Playing aggressively, that means 10-15 minutes getting into a match, 5 minutes of play, death. Now queue again.
---
Or I can hug shadows in my wood armour with my hand-cranked shotgun, look for camouflage, and try to stay out of the way of the two L90’s with power armour and Gatling guns until they murder each other, and pick up xp while I wait. More time in game, more xp, fewer deaths, more fun.
---
I’d be more inclined to play aggressively if waiting around for a match to end and/or queuing for the next one didn’t take so long.
---
It's just says 2 and then 10fire. I heard that nothing is resistant to fire. And yes your gauntlet is very good sorry for saying he chainsaw was better. I mean the basic ones
---
As far as I've seen you have to be really high Lvl to use unlock them, unless it's been changed
---
A good battle royale would have players constantly judging whether or not a fight is worth the risk.
---
The whole point is to be the last one standing. Killing other players increases your chances of this happening, but also increases your risk of being eliminated.
---
True but i don't play the game to only play the most op build.  
---
I play what i want and my gauss pistol is great fun even if a western revolver is better.
---
The same should apply the gauss minigun, play it not for more dps but the unique explosive bullets and don't worry about how bad it is.
---
Chainsaw really is godly for the damage it shows. I think that's broke tho.
---
I hit 41 today, thought about grinding experience to 42 but just didn't feel like getting burnt out so quickly into the double experience weekend.
---
Level 50 isnt very high leveled and it has never been changed
---
I just saw a level 14 with a jetpack go floating by.
---
Oh, dog food counted? I assumed it wouldn’t!
---
I’m pretty sure the moldy hotdogs count too
---
I believe it was Line in the Sand but I hadnt looked in my inventory for a couple of events. The other was Distinguished Guests. Since those particular ones are meant to be Savage Divide event drops my money is on it being Line in the Sand. I nearly fell off my chair when i looked in my inventory after and saw them
---
It still does that. Absolutely nothing changes. 
---
What am I missing?
---
Oh I'm pretty sure that the requirement was a lot higher when it was added to PTS
---
&gt;What is more likely is their own terrain is impossible for it to walk on
---
So, you agree about the tops of tents being a factor then?
---
Your comment contradicts itself
---
that would require bethesda to care about game quality
---
I could go super mutant hunting and get myself 100x5mm from 1 alone, without the need to server hop for 10 minutes or so
---
Fantastic event for xp and legendaries. Very rarely anyone else in there, and honestly I’m not there for the candy anyway, they can have it!
---
That idea sounds more like the deadzone in division series. I'd rather it be a more seamless transition. Into a sort of stalker type area. The idea of maybe a guarded fence line that fits into story that you have to leave all adventure gear because you won't be able to return with it being so irradiated or something to that effect so it fits. Even if it was like daily events where you could only spend 3 hours in zone a day or something then had to get out before end of timer or you lost your looted gear would be cool.
---
I had a lot of the same concerns at first, but 2 years later and post Wastelanders release the game is much better than it was on release. Yes, you can play solo. It's totally worth it now with NPCs back in the game and a lot of fun. I'm doing the game solo and having a blast. PVP is disabled and not automatic unless you go on the Nuclear Winter mode. Just stick to Adventure and make sure you have Pacifist mode on in the settings after level 10 (PVP is disabled by default before level 10). If you really want to be all alone there's also the option of Fallout 1st. You get a private server all to yourself if you want for $13 a month.
---
It's not pay to win at all. Just about anything that can be bought in the Atom Shop can be grinded for and you can get it free, and none of the items are really game breaking. And again on Adventure mode there really isn't anything other players can do to you unless you want them to. 
---
As for lore, I haven't gotten very far in the game yet, but I've heard some snippets from YouTubers of lore that sounds fascinating. Haven't gotten there yet but eh. 
---
Make sure you have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, otherwise you'll have to pay to get online because it's multi-player. If you already do, I say try it. It's a lot of fun, even solo.
---
Someone probably opened a lunchbox around you without you noticing. I just tested it and you get the exact same amount of exp regardless of how many people are sharing Inspirational. Perk cards do not stack.
---
Exactly what he said. 
---
Side note: using skeetshooter raised my accuracy by 4 points. 4 points. Lol.
---
You can thank the dupers for that. Bethesda locked a lot of new Waateland rewards behind the gold grind/character bound wall.
---
They are talking about CAMP skin, like the one part of the legendary run.
---
The most disappointing reward ever. So much work for a 1*.
---
Nope
---
Have never seen one of these, nor do I ever want to
---
I hope it's just visually broke. My guess is its tick speed . I want it stronger I love this toy
---
Agreed. Though I would prefer if I can get more scores from weeklies since I can’t play the game everyday.
---
Sort of, but insofar as the problem is that pathing is the issue but not because of tents. It has always been a problem whereas tents only were introduced with 1st.
---
Unless you are just a naturally good player at this kind of game, it takes a while to get a good perk card set. Also knowing where the good crates can spawn. I'm not a great player but if I get a handmade going against a great player with a pipe pistol, I'm gonna win that.
---
Well I was click baited then probably lol
---
I'll need to try it. I still use a gatlin gun as main even though I have a bloodied lmg purely because I like the pre war vibe so I like trying cool looking weapons regardless of damage.
---
So I can do the quest again? Actually receive the quest steps with modus walking me through it?
---
Jump on the tents when she lifts off to deal with adds perfectly fine. Nobody likes getting hunted down and poisoned by a bunch of mirelurks
---
But when everything is dead get back on the goddamn ground
---
I’m at 37 right now with just the dailies left, finished the week yesterday. I’m afraid I may slow down with Ghosts coming out tomorrow.
---
100% a bug. And it’s extremely common, probably 90% of every core I use reloads prematurely. And once it starts, you can’t stop it, the gun has to be reloaded (maybe you can swap weapons but cba). On top of that you only load in the highest % core. So after you use all your 100% you’ll be left with all 10-30% cores. It’s the worst. And to keep yourself from dropping them and wasting ammo, you have to use core after core with 50 rounds each lmao. I can’t do that with 60 cores. 
---
You just dropped a nuke. You’re on the Queen with 50 cores left. You reload a core, and you only get 40 rounds. What?? You finish that off, and toss in a core with 35 rounds. Wtf?? You check your ammo. All 48 remaining cores have 50 or less rounds in them. That’s how it hit me lol.
---
Half the time the green/red means nothing anyways.
---
I'm doing my rad rumble and guided meditations lol. I just like to have fun!
---
I'm also 48 score, I'm not worried about finishing haha
---
I'm going to clown garden tonight
---
Maybe they did patch it out. I can't get it to work. Glad I did it before. Sucks they didn't have the decency to let us wallpaper both sides before doing so.
---
This
---
You’re insulted by my post? Jesus dude just scroll past it then don’t be a dickhead about it. Some people like talking about games and helping people out, if you don’t have interest in that then fine but why you took this so personal is strange to me lol
---
Maybe this explain why I saw a dude in power armor going to town on a SBQ with a flaming chainsaw once. I thought he was just doing it for fun but maybe its more viable than I gave it credit for
---
What did you think the level was?
---
You’ll always get exp from just a tap, idc if you get gear from the queen or any other end game boss but regular stuff you’ll get exp
---
Standing or jumping.
---
Yes, just crafted unyielding, Rad resist; Sentinles
---
I got TWO pieces of unyielding secret service armor in about 30 attempts. Luckily, one out of those was an unyielding pieces is an unyielding powered Cavalier secret service chest piece. The other? Unyielding charisma breathe under water right leg. It’s possible
---
I'm the same but with rifles not big guns. Like its very fun
---
They are all super fun events, most people don't do Project Paradise because they don't read the objectives and give up. Violent Night is good but it could be ruined if there's way too many people there and none are playing instruments or protecting the jukebox. Monster Mash even if doing it alone you get rewarded CANDY!
---
Neat bug!
---
Or I think they should increase the amount of score you get from dailies. Increase them to 500 each. Or increase both dailies and weeklies as we get into the last 2 weeks or so to help the ppl who haven't finished yet
---
Haven't really messed with one in a while, but try the twisted muscles mutation with the incisors perk. Also maybe two handed melee??
---
Would you use them over this?
---
[Bloodied 25FF](https://imgur.com/a/Cx7VgUk)
---
I'm not familiar enough with it. Where do you get the mods for it? (And where do you even get a chainsaw in the first place?)
---
Idk I saw a post about it and the op was outraged about the Lvl requirement so I assumed it was unattainably high. I saw something about 1500 lvls, maybe to unlock them all which is unnecessary
---
Whew! Because I wrecked that toilet of the camp I was at earlier!
---
WRECKED!!
---
Which part?  All of the CAMP items I see in the Legendary Run have nothing to do with moving your camp. I must be missing something. I’ll look again.
---
*Edit: I stand corrected.  Reward 66, the Future-Tec C.A.M.P.  My guess would be your just have to move the module itself, but that’s simply a guess.  I think I may have been thrown off because of the Raider/Settler Bundle reference. I didn’t know there was one of these skins in there either.*
---
Where would you put [this](https://imgur.com/a/Cx7VgUk) in a ranking?
---
Seem like strength effects . Now I just need  to know perks and mutations . I don't wanna full change my build tho. I like my railway rifle.
---
That is to fully upgrade all 12 cards
---
Did you kill a wendigo?
---
You're right. Couldn't do it with wood but concrete works.
---
Annoys me when I see stimpacks being sold for 40+ caps
---
Don't forget to keep wood too. You need that to cook food etc.
---
As for Collectrons, I made the mistake of buying the Communist one and assumed that it collected junk too. It does not. As far as I can tell, the only one that collects junk is the default one, not the Communist or Raider one. However, it seems if you buy all 3 Collectrons you can use one to gather what all the others can just by switching modes. For example, I bought the Communist bot first then the scavenger bot. When I went into the terminal after building the scavenger bot, I could still access the Communist bots modes to gather weapons etc. Hope that makes sense. I thought that was pretty nifty since the game only allows you to build one type of Collectron at your CAMP at one time.
---
I'd say the scavenger bot is worth it. It doesn't load you down, just gives you small bits of useful scrap every so often.
---
The pictures in the cabins sometimes spin when you first walk in
---
I'll was with them . I'm very interested. I saw a pic with a guy that got it to 167D ticks per second
---
Just got half a score rank in 10 minutes at Line in the Sand.  Don't forget to pack your lunch.
---
Forest events for forest camo I believe.
---
Heard of a few, some posts/comments about it too
---
Guessing it was mostly just people who had a flagged item and they suspended their account until they can remove item
---
Correct
---
Level 60.
---
Make the Ohio side of the map this area. You can ferry from Ohio River Adventures or something.
---
I’m running a blooded handmade with a complete bolstering sentinel urban scout set and take over workshops
---
I bought my mods from stores same with the weapon. But mine were player shops. Super cheap too. I've seen the mods I think in whitesprings . On like the newer protectron shops
---
It is available on a private world. They all are as far as I’m aware.
---
yeah i know forest events but Im wondering if its only the public events there or the others too
---
I sell all plans and recipes at half of suggested price idc if its really cheap or not but I have it learned already so I dont need it so even if I make 10 caps per im not complaining I have over 500 plans so . . . Ya
---
&gt; e.g. eat random person in NW
---
Cannibal isn't a perk in NW, but I love the way you think.
---
Probably max strength with strength buff foods and chems. 167 is quite a bit for continuous damage though.
---
You can get it thru quests and events as a rare drop in the forest. One time i created a new character and when I completed thirst things first they gave me the forest camo jumpsuit so I transferred to my high level character since I love to collect outfits.
---
Ok good to know
---
Maybe, I’m curious what times their flagging. My friend got suspended and he didn’t dupe. He did buy and trade for duped weapons tho.
---
You have learned Zax's lesson to humanity.
---
If no one shoots, other than to kill mobs, everyone would get more XP.  Even the person that would have gotten first place would end up with more XP.
---
He's so happy when people vote for a map.  He's so sad when you drop a nuke.
---
Zax is trying to teach humanity to put down their guns and bombs.  
---
NW hasn't left beta because no group has learned the lesson.
---
Humanity sucks.
---
Kinda need power armor if you’re going in a nuke zone. That, and if you have emergency protocols on your power armor, then you get 50% less damage while under 20% health. Coupled with Nerd Rage? Is more than enough to have fun and survive in a nuke zone.
---
It’s in the datamined stuff coming, so you’ll probably see it in the atomic shop soon
---
While other games do have time gating, there is a right way and a wrong way. Right ways: Dailies, weeklies, etc. it’s fun to always have new challenges on a set time gate. Raids that take more than 4 hours to do. WoW raids (at least back in Classic, BC, and WotLK) could sometimes take multiple planned sittings for 25 people. It’s hard to get 25 people on the same schedule so time gating raids was a good idea. You and your group get 7 days to complete a raid once you enter. If you can only do 1/4th I’d the raid in one sitting, that’s fine. Come back within 7 days and pick up where you left off! 
---
Bad uses: You can ONLY do this one thing once a day that gives you one currency. You then need 30 of those things to buy the worst backpack in the game. Currency time gates. XP limit per day, premium currency grinding limit per day, etc. Time limits on challenging group content (looking at your Destiny 2 and FO76)
---
He was using the over repair thing (honestly just got back from a long hiatus have no clue what's all added)
---
Because no one would be insulted if you walked into a restaurant and said "tried the food about a year ago, was terrible. Is it worth it to eat here now?"   I have the attitude but you're an ass
---
Yeah take the PvP out and it's good.
---
I'd love to try to farm better mats and gear etc but that ass clown with his bloodied-bullshit and endless duped gear (if he wasn't banned that is...) would see to it that he griefs and slays everyone. No thanks. The douche minority would ruin it. 
---
Other than that it's like an early days Craglorn in ESO, a group content area. I'd be down for some tougher pve kills.
---
Honestly I'd love to mess with Berserker but it's just not worth it for me. People are forever saying nerf bloodied, but the synergies and the way that build is done encompassing everything is quite honestly amazing when done right. I wanna see more complex rewarding things; if you put in the time, like that. 
---
What needs to happen is other builds need to be buffed or created to at least compete and synergize in a similar way, not make the one (2 I guess if you count junkies but that's not even on par) build that's good in its execution also bland. How that would happen is another matter, but berserker definitely has the ability to be something great if stuff is added or changed to make it so.
---
As one of those players who'd be raking in the atoms I'd love this, but I'm pretty sure the removed atoms from the dailies because they were giving away too many and a lot of people didn't need to buy them to get what they wanted from the shop, so I don't see that happening.
---
Static chainsaw spawn at the Ranger Station (inside the shack behind it, across from the animal cages). I’ve tried it and it’s fun but it doesn’t have any legendary variants and still does less DPS than many of my unarmed weapons. For these reasons, I have to pass.
---
I have a 3star Automatic be railway rifle and its recoil is ridiculous. But it takes out groups of ghouls which is fun!
---
Only thing worse than hiding in a bush on teams is 4 man teams of people who play with teams off.
---
As long as we can kill them every time they open their mouth like in Skyrim.
---
2mm is energy.
---
The 9 dailys last until the 20th then its going back to whatever it was before. This is more like a special event than a permanent thing. 
---
Besides COD, I don't think I've ever come across such a grindy pass and I've played pretty much all besides those mobile games.
---
The pass is 10 weeks I believe they said. So 70 days, to reach the cap I'd need to level 1.4 times per day. Easier said than done when you need progressively more and more XP. If you want to complete it, it'll get to the point where you need to do all of your dailys and then grind out 100k XP (OR MORE) to get enough from the repeatable to get a single level per day.
---
I love 76, but the dailys are just getting monotonous and its getting increasingly annoying having to efficiently level up each day. I use second characters but even doing the same starter quest is getting a bit long on the tooth. 
---
There are plenty of ways they could fix it, extra challenges, double S.C.O.R.E. weekends every second week, small amounts of S.C.O.R.E per event/daily but it's whatever I'm, I don't care. I'll spend the atoms as I'm not spending another 6 or 7 weeks doing the same shit I've been doing since this game launched lmao. 
---
I'm waiting more for the Broken Steel season so we get daily ops and by then. They'll hopefully have found a decent balance of S.C.O.R.E.
---
Is that good DR for a limb though? That seems high.
---
It's not legendary but I would use it for normal junk runs
---
Sorry, power armor. I'm an idiot
---
Their risk assessment is definitely off. I've played a lot of BR games and can average 5 kills in nw/match. Playing passive is just the smarter/less risky more reward play. 
---
I've won multiple games because getting to the last circle is easy if you afk and usually the people in the last circle are people who don't really play BRs so they're easy to kill. 
---
You'd definitely get more exp sitting afk starting at the edge of the map crawling towards the end game with literally no gear than spamming games you land in the middle to kill people. Although at some point if your kills are high enough then it averages out. Risk is still lower and reward is higher if youre patient till the last circles.
---
Doesn't work with wood
---
Although it might be possible, in an engine like this that would be extremely clunky and probably not work consistently
---
nice
---
Yeah same, like what’s up with that
---
it's definitely not usable outside vats. the recoil-improved stock does nothing, really.
---
This is exactly a post I made before and got flamed for daring to suggest other builds should be buffed.
---
Listen guys at the end of the day this is a single player game with minor online qualities. I honestly don’t care if every build is broken and easy because that’s always been the case in fallout. Eventually your character shits on every thing. 
---
That being said please allow shared legendary mob drops for events even if you don’t tag the mob.
---
2mm EC isn’t energy ammo though. Wouldn’t make sense for them to have cores.
---
Thanks for the info. I do have a second character I created to see the changes out of the vault when wastelanders dropped so I may make more use of her. Ill probably be doing that anyway to take advantage of SCORE dailies that require a level up
---
I'll take storys that never happened for £20
---
Yeah and the other person said it works with concrete. Tried it myself and can confirm.
---
Not sure why you felt the best reply to me saying it doesn't work with wood was to say that you can't do it with wood but you do you.
---
She is a powerful end game Boss. She isn't suppose the land so that you can beat her to death  with a melee weapon wearing a clown suit. 
---
It's suppose to require heavy guns and power armor (with Stabilized perk and to avoid the intense radiation) to take her on and defeat her whether she is flying or lands.
---
Probably 🤔
---
Except it doesn't kill anything better than most other weapons.  I mean, by that logic .45 for The Fixer should be nearly impossible to get.
---
I really like now that everyone wants to team up.  It make the world feel more like a “community” of sorts.  
---
I dislike that atoms rewards are so minimal now.  Some cool stuff coming out in the atomic shop and we get 1500 max over a 10 week period (challenges aside).
---
I haven’t had any score issues either, so I know that’s the major issue for some.  That being said I don’t think it’ll be any issue obtaining 100
---
Um... use ultracite round maybe. Saves a lot on the junk requirements if you can keep up with the flux.
---
Uh, I've been skipping days and I still managed to get to level 34 this week.
---
This reminds me, why aren’t there Mounts for the other cryptids? Mounted Grafton Monster Hand and Mounted Flatwoods Monster should totally be a thing.
---
I would never ever use Aa at the start of my shit I want. If it has no paint it comes up on the top of the list during vendors. For the love of God Always save gear you want as Zz
---
There is a VATs bug that causes the first shot to miss a lot of the time on many different guns. I also use a Junkies Gauss Shotgun w/ 33% VATs hit chance and have just got into the habit of firing twice at everything. Another trick I've found: target enemies legs in VATs. Even if you miss, the explosive effect off the ground tends to hit (and usually kill) the enemy.
---
cool, I'd like to know.
---
Rode hard, hung up wet?
---
I seem to think it's half decent level 45 and I run it pretty nice during like plastic hunting
---
One word, Cryolator.....
---
Hey man.   I've never had the drive to drop money on this game, so I'm stoked I get to experience it through game pass.      The main reason I have been reluctant is because I don't really care for multiplayer, so I am currently level 13, and have no interest in interacting with people, at least until I finish the quests and get myself to power armor boss status so I can start concentrating on the other aspects of the game. 
---
That bring said - who the hell is spending caps on 10mm early in the game?   Caps are hard to come by comparatively and I've got the find extra ammo perk cause I'm saving them caps for end game shit.     Who spends precious caps on 10mm?  Silly goofs.
---
I’m glad we don’t have the more obscure dailies anymore though.  Like kill crickets in Uncanny or kill a sloth in Cranberry bog.  Or forgetting to equip 3 items while leveling up
---
The AR is pretty decent but if your into shotguns the be combat shotgun is really good especially if you add a silencer and increase its accuracy it can be used as a sniper in a way theres a bug going on with that shotgun but i would rather use the shotgun than the AR tbh it does massive damage in vats
---
So melee weapon people can’t join in?
---
I use my new character as a luck build to help with getting better stuff and im using her for the SCORE where you must level up and so i can side with the raiders so that I have all the achievements and the fashinable raider outfit.
---
I think that's what the new season will be. At first I thought it would be a war between the two, but why make Meg such a reasonable raider?
---
You can use another character so that you have more stash limit, a bigger cash limit, and you can use the character to do opposite sides of wastelanders.
---
With 800 stash limit, it becomes very useful during legendary events  like treasure hunter or faschnaut
---
They probably have a program set too flag, then an employee goes through and suspends until they remove the flagged items
---
If you got a duped weapon you will most likely just lose the weapon, if you have a much you might get wiped or rolled back. Dupers will no doubt get wiped, or maybe just a permanent ban
---
I got a BFFR+P on my 15th or 20th roll. Hang tight. Before they broke adrenaline, I was doing close to 250 dmg to the SBQ per round per headshot.
---
Because the perks required to hack or pick a lock are replaced with much more useful perks (ex: commando/ground pounder vs lock picking in perception)
---
That would get you 1 rank and it would be your only card.   You'd get 35 2mm per craft instead of 27.  Not exactly setting the world on fire.
---
Should give out something worthwhile to anyone that completes the board before the end.  Legendary loot box every “space” you advance past the end.  Or atoms for the store or just something that’s not viewed as worthless.  I really hate having to grind grind grind every day.  Let me take a day or two off the game every so often without feeling like I’m screwing myself and having to use the real money currency to make up for it.
---
Paradise is different than RR though, there's XP in all the habitats (and you are more likely to get more XP if everyone splits up to do the different habitats than if everyone was grouped up in venison). I think for paradise the most XP is actually in radkelp given the difficulty of some of the enemies there, yet most of the time people just stay in venison and ignore it so I do not believe XP farming is the reason people ignore the other habitats.
---
Mostly for holding the loot you earn on your main character. Most of the high level traders I know have several storage characters. Once you get high enough level it becomes prohibitive to change your build significantly so its easier to start fresh.
---
But.... you don't have to. It costs you nothing to not be a dick and downrank your damage for events... but here you are, being a dick. I deliberately downrank my damage so everyone can participate.
---
It could've typed "56" and hit enter, but this was more fun. :)
---
I totally agree, the characters at crater are way more likable than foundation, i think Jens alright but she's one of the only settlers I took a liking to. It would have been awesome if we could have foregone all the gold we got at the end if we had a 3rd way where we get the settlers and raiders together. The way I see it is foundation are a bunch of selfish assholes who move think they're better than the raiders when they're just 2 sides of the same coin.
---
XP needed for challenges [here in limited time section](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank)
---
Nah. Tell Bethesda not to have daily challenges for a mode no-one's interested in playing. Then you'd get less players doing it for Score.
---
Its completely possible. The Fallout 4 mod "Modern Firearms" has this feature, though since its only a mod, they had to make it an Aid item you hotbar and use whenever you wanna change between the two. All it needs is some kind of Button assigned to it. PC is ofc easy, since theres plenty extra keys, but for console, they could just make it be on like... the D-Pad. Just hold down like... The stimpak button or something, idk im not a game designer.
---
They did it on purpose, because it is very powerful. My Bloodied has a base damage of ~500 when low health. I can kill the imposter goatsquatch before her laser can charge.
---
I’m being a dick because Idc about everyone else playing the game, what’s the point of grinding for weapons if I can’t ever use them in an event complain to the people who made the system not me. I’m gonna use my build as intended
---
Theyre talking about how the 9 dailys make more sense once you get past the second half of the pass. 
---
With 7 dailys (i think it was 7 before) it'll take 2 days to level up once. Im not sure what level 99-100 will be but from what I've seen, I wouldnt be surprised if its 4k or something, which is 3(?) days worth of grinding. 
---
Most other games that have a pass require a consistent amount each tier. 
---
Fortnite (80k per tier for 10-100)
---
Destiny (100k per tier from 1-100)
---
I dont know about COD but I know its pretty consistent.
---
Other games usually have this abundance of XP at the start of the season. Enough to get about 15-20 tiers in and then it slows down. Then the grind sets in. With this though, it'll be different to say the least. 
---
I'll personally be buying tiers because there is way too much of a grind
---
I've said it a few times recently and I stand by it. You can't have a game that's always been PvE, then embrace aspects of PvP and expect to balance it with both in mind. That's where the problems started and it escalated from there. The natural idea to nerf bloodied is a reaction to feeling like you're being pigeon holed and forced into it if you want to max out your potential, and it's seen as more realistic/easier to nerf one thing than to buff everything else
---
The fact bloodied is stupidly powerful in end game when you've got all the perks mutations and gear etc shouldn't really be a factor to others when it's a PvE world with a PvP donkey tail tacked on. The gap is only awidened by the fact the other builds are so far behind. I'd love to see some more like it so it's diverse but also not detrimental to do anything else, because that's how I feel right now if I consider changing my build. 
---
One wasteland is a start, as well as more challenging mobs or even raising the level cap on them for end game when OW drops so everything isn't a cakewalk even if you do go bloodied. Then add some stuff to make the other builds just as complex and synergistic.
---
And yes, removing the frustration of losing out on loot and drops because of the build destroying everything would also make a big difference to how it's perceived. Event drops if you contribute meaningfully without having to loot a specific corpse or whatever would be a delight and help a lot.
---
If you have a friend to help moving stuff from character to character its essentially a way to have a bank in the game, you can use your 2nd character for storage of weapons, food, chems, ammo, chems, outfits, junk, caps, chems..
---
No chance you have any daytripper?..
---
(Junkie build humor)
---
I didn't know that the asylum hats weren't rare like the outfits were so I definitely had those priced pretty wrong for awhile. It was a sad day when I found out I wasn't just super lucky finding all those "rare" hats.
---
In the PTS, to fully rank up one card required so many perk coins that you'd need to be around level 700
---
Yea I think on major issue in the game is the lack of ways to obtain atoms outside of the legendary run and just flat out buy them. They should either add more challenges that reward atoms, increase existing atom rewards on current challenges, or, like the settler and raider dailies, give them out as quest rewards
---
The mule aspect is one of the largest components of having additional characters to me. I run a junkies build so I keep some excess chems and heavy weighted item on those characters. Also, it allows you to build up a good deal of scrip 1000 per toon. So when a legendary sale takes place you have more resources at your disposal.  I really only play on my main. All others are storage.
---
But other than that I use my 2nd character for building different camps because I don't want to lose my main because it took forever to build
---
Look on the brightside, even if its green it still wont place due to
---
A. Object is floating
---
B. Collision with another object 
---
E. Object needs support 
---
D. Item error
---
I have 2 accounts. I join groups with my vendor mule with 15 charisma who's got Empath and share Inspiration. And then I join with my main account and don't share much of anything, mostly because I have perk loadout sets already made (perk loadout manager) and rebuilding them for every single group is just... nah cuz, I ain't like that. Enjoy the 3star Inspiration and the damage reduction from SiN Empath.
---
I might share Strange in Numbers or Travel Agent or something random.
---
Or when two players on your team decide that they are the only important ones and run off. Or when your teammates jump around everywhere but aren't good enough to survive so they get the whole team killed. Or when you go to save them and then you get downed as a result and they just leave you to die. Yeah, pretty much team play with randos is pretty awful. Occasionally you get a good team, but more often than not if you are solo, you're better off playing solo.
---
She's been doing that a lot more lately.
---
Ha ha thanks for the boost my friend. I'll get there and that sounds like something I want to get involved in. I love the model and the actual projectile animation,m so fingers crossed I can drop my ultracite gatling laser for it in time :D
---
About 3-4. Usually I have one sniper rifle (silenced), a silenced pistol for shorter range, a mid-range rifle and then the strongest weapon I can find at that moment in time in case I run into something unexpected (at the moment that's a double barrel shotgun). Lately I've also started carrying a bowie knife for weaker enemies like radroaches etc so I don't waste ammo on em.
---
My favourite is the stair case you can't delete because the absolutely 0 floors above it "won't be accessible"
---
"IDC about everyone else playing the game".
---
Yes, you are a dick.
---
It just gives you the achievement. You can still progress through and do the steps. 
---
Have you tried yet or just assumed?
---
Guy, this is reddit, a place built for sharing information not an Applebee’s. Why you have self proclaimed yourself to be a reddit police officer is beyond me. I don’t really give a flying fuck about what type of posts you agree with. Multiple people have shared brief explanations of how this game has improved, and that’s all I was looking for. You said no one has time to explain these things to me, yet you’ve replied 3 or 4 times belly aching about it haha. Go find the real criminals of reddit, officer. I respect all that you do for our community #backtheblue
---
I think they should've added some actual content to go along with the grind. Since we've all just come off a 3 month Bullion grind and now it's just another grind we have to commit to but the same events, same sort of dailys etc to commit to.
---
Its all getting a bit long on the tooth at this point. 
---
I'm all for the pass but they need to time the pass drops with content drops so we don't feel burned out on content because of all the grinds
---
Thanks, appreciate it, I’m on PS4 but I’ll hopefully aim to tackle it again soon after refining my build a little more (and hopefully pickup even better weapons)
---

Obviously referring to the cap pool...
---
Now I may not be the most well versed in fallout lore but I don't think 'the Raiders' and 'cooperate with other factions' is a thing.
---
This is true, it's a lawless land
---
You won’t be able to give people good guns since you don’t have a character with any. Stay banned
---
I have a PA hvy wpns main, and a sneaky commando for myself. I started a third to play with my wife when she started, but that one kinda got left behind once my wife hit level fifty.
---
It actually works in my favor for Legendary Run, since leveling is easy on the lower level and the commando knocks out the crits in just a few minutes.
---
In levels, but not xp.
---
Welp, time to place my camp and start all over now! ( I hate that one )
---
i had it happen to me too for the first time but only 1 free quest and somehow before id even logged in it had logged eating 2 pre war food... curious to know what you did prior to logging off? i had just completed a rank, claimed it and finished 1 repeatable weekly.
---
.....
---
Custom Fitted, Deep Pocketed, Ultralight... hardly just useless.
---
I mean...you play fallout 76... How big is your brain really?
---
I honestly like having high level alts so I can have extra chances to get something good from scrip (but it can be rough feeding a few alts)
---
Yes, it’s all RNG. 
---
Suggestion; when crafting, make sure your Intelligence is as high as possible. Even though I don’t run a Bloodied build, I keep a set of Unyielding for crafting purposes. 
---
The base durability of the armor and weapons. is a lot higher if your Intelligence is raised up.
---
For me, I needed a full set of Troubleshooter’s for silo runs and then a mixed bag set for adventuring.
---
Best of luck!
---
In general people in NW are pretty damn oblivious to their surroundings.  
---
https://youtu.be/ynI_Du1l4ME
---
Yea ur absolutely right just let time to pass, through in some new atom shop items and let things die down.
---
Might be a consequence of Healing Factor. We already know it shortens the durations of stimpack healing; maybe the lunchbox buff is implemented in a similar way.
---
I personally think that the raiders over at the crater aren’t that reasonable, a bit yes, but not as much as foundation is to us. One example is that the raiders are immediately hostile to us before we do any storyline quests. That was annoying maybe to just me, but it’s still a valid point. If you’ve got sick or thirsty people in your home raider, you shouldn’t steal because then the people that had the item won’t be willing to trade for it. What I’m saying is that the raiders aren’t reasonable. If they were, they’d be willing to trade instead of just steal all of the generators and stuff they have at foundation. If meg were reasonable, she’d know that it’s not because you’ve been here before that other people can’t also stay in “your” land.
---
Thank you
---
The information your post is conveying is phrased as a backhanded question toward the game itself. And this is your last warning before i write a citation and fine
---
Makes sense. I guess my playstyle is more suited to hacking and lockpicking.
---
Still doesn't explain running away from aid, though. Randoms, I guess...
---
im all for a viable medic build/support build with a stim like ammo for it, flamer with friendly fire too...
---
How do you unlock using atoms?
---
What type of team were you one?  If it’s an Events Team, you end up with a lot of bonus XP for those events.
---
I SWEAR, IT WAS JUST AN OVERSIZED BUSH
---
I have a level 100+ Berzerker and another level 35 one. Both are stealth commandos. I rarely died playing either of them. With the right build and weapons, I don't find the mode to be very hard as it is. Could it use a damage buff? Probably. But then, if damage is the main goal, may as well play Bloodied, which has all the benefits already.
---
It’s not like she drops anything cool anyway.
---
[Read this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Nji1wR3q5hoHOKwKQWnK5p1qhtub7O64XPGZxeimpI/htmlview)
---
Noticed this too.. instant disappointment.  The NW Ghillie blends perfectly with the map foliage but the score versions are just too green and shiny.
---
Actually I did not even have to go inside.  I battled Mr Gutsy and the Robobrain Protector and it was inside the Robobrain Protector.   Careful though when you go to collect, he blows up.  Killed me but I respawned back to Grahams and went to the blown up hulk and the interpolater was there still in the hulk of the blown up protector.
---
I have like 9 mutations but NO healing factor. All armor has chem reduction. Gf has mutations but no HF and all her armor had a random reduction on it. We don’t experience it.
---
i guess it is not only about bloodied effect is more about the whole set: unyielding + bloodied + perks + mutations. I dont use any bloodied weapons bcz i go with "2 shot" which means +100% of damage. Maybe i am wrong at some point bcz here almost everyone is crazy about bloodied effect and i joined the comunity loooong after i had finished all questlines. 
---
But! 2shot is the best effect ever. I tested it with low rate guns to see if it works and it does. 
---
Back to my suggestion. I am strongly disagree about nerfing any mode but it is not fair fight between low health unyielding + bloodied player and berserker. U dont have damage resistance but u MUST be able to deal way more damage against ur opponents. Die or oneshot everything. Low health caracter are quite tankie against any enemies depends on their armor set/perks/mutations/buffs.
---
System?
---
I won a match last night for literally having the high ground. Last player couldnt get up to my location and I was pushing my two plasma mines and a nuka mine off the cliff to kill the last person
---
Sucks bro, I glanced around your post history and although it doesn't mean much you don't seem like an exploiter to me. That being said this post likely wont help as at best it will get a community manager who at best can send the department a message which will likely fall on deaf ears as its really just a volume problem at this moment.
---
??????
---
get to 10, join radiation rumble, line in the sand, load baring.. anything with a large amount of mobs and just get single hits on each mob. it will be frustrating with the hail of explosive weapons but 5 ranks every rad rumble isnt something id ssy no to
---
thanks for reading this post
---
Too real. Restarted a 15ish hour camp because if this. It just got so outta hand, it was like 4 floating completely disconnected staircases and a bunch of floating foundation pieces. Couldn't delete any of it
---
You're not counting the beginning of the pass when you were getting multiple levels a day. My statement still stands, they don't need to change the score rate as the event goes on to satisfy your endorphin cravings. This pass does have a grind to it, but that's the point of battle passes usually, not to hand out an item a day, it's ment to keep people coming back to get that end of the pass shit. You don't need the stuff on the board, everything on it is cosmetic with the exception of lunchboxes (which will most likely be purchasable eventually like the repair kits and scrap kits). If you aren't enjoying the game and it's a chore to play it daily, then don't play, it's the simplest message Bethesda can receive. They seem to get shit done when player counts drop.
---
Level 30 game pass noob here, only playing for 3 days. Every 2 hours there’s a nuke on my server, and every session I have at least 2 people above level 450 lmao.
---
I keep wishing there were people my level but I can’t find em
---
That's an awesome Google doc. You're amazing. My math seems sound then, still a good PSA post for the community. That doc should be top thread on this sub
---
Honestly, I feel like they could easily implement a fix for this.
---
Nw is what bugs it out for me. I only go in if the other daily &amp; weekly challenges are all complete
---
sorry i didn't elaborate the event you have to play music to lure enemies and kill them, i don't remember much of the story
---
Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts in such detail. I really appreciate it.
---
I've personally been apprehensive about sharing perks that I know a lot of other people use and I see shared all the time. For example I think most players with mutations are already running Strange in Numbers on a Public Team so I don't expect that many people that would truly benefit from it, and what good build doesn't already have Bloody Mess? I may be completely wrong though, which is one of the reasons I made this post lol.
---
I like the advice on not sharing crafting perks or Picklock/Hacker. I agree that crafting perks are way too situational and they're a bad idea to walk around with anyway. I never really thought about Picklock/Hacker being that bad but now that you bring it up and I gave it some more thought, they aren't particularly useful. If you could share all three ranks maybe, but being able to freely pick/hack level 1 locks/terminals is not that great.
---
I also agree with you on sharing resistance perks. Perks that boost DR have minimal effect where as perks that reduce damage by x% are hugely beneficial.
---
Last thing I want to say is I like your choice in perk cards to share. I recently took off Travel Agent because I have way more caps than I need and I figured I'd use the point elsewhere. It still pains me to pay 75 caps to travel across the map though, so when someone shares Travel Agent with me it makes me unreasonably happy.
---
Back? they never left.
---
Does that really stop the queen from landing? I didn’t know that
---
Say that next time the biatch drops you a 1* shovel or similar :-)
---
That qualifies as bush hiding well, haha. Even without the bush
---
I'd be raging hard if I was the other guy's teammate
---
I’m a gamepass noob, but so far I haven’t been able to find too many people close to my level, the majority are 60+ and I’ve seen so many 500+
---
epic boast fellow ledditor! may you have many upboats! XD!
---
Its affected by energy perks like batteries included but its technically not an energy ammo. Its a physical round thats magnetically accelerated through the gun, unlike a non-solid state ammunition that pulls from a pooled source of like plasma, nuclear fusion, fuel ect. Basically, its a solid projectile and therefor ballistic, perks be damned.
---
I really like this. Way better than just the daily giving atoms. I'm also on vacation and just got shut off at our resort bar so I'm drunk Redditing.
---
Ah okay, that's crazy. Thanks for the informative response!
---
Once upon a time, the Responder, Raider, and Watoga Mall vendors had separate cap pools, but they were prohibitively small. The fix to the issue of players having to traverse the map to sell things was to make all of them have an interconnected daily cap pool that is much larger. Wastelanders introduced the separate cap pool held in a traveling merchant you can unlock through quests, though there is a chance this is shared with the other traveling merchants that may appear at your camp now.
---
I have tried to get the quest again but nothing came up. 
---
I can figure it out via google but that's not my point, I wanted to do the quest, its kind of a big part of the story...
---
I don't understand your issue with me wanting to enjoy the story?
---
I tested this, using 3 nukes (same server lol)
---
Depsite her broken AI it can be utilised, I tend to rush in front and open fire on her best I can, she aggros to me more die to the damage I'm dealing and she'll land more and go for me meaning melee builds and others can get a ton of hits in before she fucks off
---
How do I stay alive even though I'm bloodied? T-65 PA, I can survive 4+ swipes before I'm near dead whereas without the PA I'm 1 shot even with full set of SS
---
Hahahaha respectable
---
10 hours? I play 2, tops. Lv 41.
---
I've read that. I try to stay away from NW all together, and I hadn't gone in until after I did everything else in Hope's the game would pick up and realize it.
---
Does throwing explosive bait still entice her to land?
---
Would you be kind enough to explain the WestTec run? I see people post about it all the time, but whenever I go there's only 5 or so super mutants right where I spawn in and that's about it. I'm clearly doing it wrong.
---
That's more or less what I have I think.  I don't have the less damage from creatures because I generally do a good job of avoiding them.
---
Last night while hiding I dove into the river next to Morgantown and met someone also just hanging out under the water.  We just kind of sat there on the bottom of the river for a couple minutes staring at each other until he swam off.
---
I mean, the xp is good, easy 4 notes and repair kits
---
Plus, it never gets old but I love launching Nukes and seeing my name pop up lol (I wonder what people must think when I launch all 3 lol) and seeing it land
---
You should try crop dusting them yourself!
---
I really do, but next gens are so close it seems pointless to upgrade now. Console player btw, i load in so slow in NW i cud spawn by a chest and it already be looted b4 i can move lol
---
That’s what I’m hoping. I know a situation similar to mine and post like I made did get attention and eventually the person got un-suspended and a apology gift.
---
My main is a HW/explosive build who uses Ordinance Express (-90% explosive weight) and Bear Arms (-90% HW weight).
---
So I carry a TON of ordinance. I've probably got several hundred of various explosives on me at any one time, and I often have something like 15 different heavy weapons PLUS a few melee weapons (gotta have that shishkebab for event healing) at any one time.
---
My first alt is a bloodied riflewoman who I play as a bunch of different "characters". At times she'll be a cowgirl with a bowie knife, lever action, and western revolver. Others she'll be an Enclave commando is Scout armor with a handmade, 10mm pistol, and combat knife. Sometimes she's an Enclave Officer with a Sniper Rifle, 10mm SMG, and combat knife. Rarely she's a Civil War reenactor with a Blackpowder rifle and Sword. If Energy weapons didn't have so many issues she'd spend a lot more time as Nuka Girl jetting around blasting things with laser rifles and plasma rifles and alien blasters.  But in any one character, she's only carrying 3-4 weapons relevant to that character. 
---
My second alt is an Unarmed Junkie Tank. He's honestly carrying too many weapons these days, but primarily he has a Power Fist, Combat Shotgun, and Lever Action.
---
My third alt is a bloodied melee. Usually carrying 4-5 weapons (combat knife, DCG, Gauss Pistol for ranged attacks, shiskebab)
---
😂😂😂
---
I didn’t intend for it to come across that way, there were many things I liked about it. If I hadn’t grown up playing the previous fallouts I probably would have enjoyed 76 much more. Objectively it isn’t a bad game, but my subjective view of the franchise itself sees the game in a completely different light. 
---
And idk if you discuss this in your meetings, but you may want to point out to the other officers that having a sense of humor can deescalate most confrontations
---
I completed a trade then got off last night
---
I have my unicorn buddy i do events now just for exp a 1 star shovel still buys modules
---
I misspoke when I said Cushioned. You're right that Custom Fitted is not useless. It's the only useful mod available on the SSA legs. Deep Pocketed and Ultra Light however are only available on the chest piece and are irrelevant.
---
The people at Foundation aren't even from Appalachia, they're the interlopers. Samuel is a former vault dweller, Jen is the child of communist Chinese apparently, and there's the family who came from The Pitt, so none of them really have a claim to that land that they occupy. Since Ward is a former Raider, you'd think that he would be more sympathetic to helping them, but it's not the case. He says things like he wishes that there were other options besides violence, but there's no options to provide assistance. Oh well, sorry your grandpappy's leg is going to rot off and he'll have to suck up all that toxic water! But, oh my, this violence! I feel like there's a lot of shortcuts and missing pieces that would've really made for better storytelling. I'd rather have had less detail of Daguerre and Beckett, and more of the Raiders and Foundation stories.
---
If you’re level 30 doing events designed for end game builds idc if you can’t get a hit in. Play with a team they’re easy to join now. End game builds have no problem keeping up these low levels need to go quest and come back when they’re stronger
---
You get decent amount of xp for just hiding and trying to make it til the end. The xp for killing 1 or 2 people isnt worth getting killed early.
---
It's the rank up option when you go to the gameboard. 150 atoms per level.
---
No, it's not. We don't measure power output in millimeters. Plus "2mm EC rounds consist of a copper coil used to create a magnetic field, as well as a lubricated track the loads the lead slug into the weapon."
---
Sounds like each round is an extension of the magnetic coil barrel with a lead slug inside of it. You can even see these individual cartridges in the [pistol magazines](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/fallout_gamepedia/b/be/F76_PPK_12_Gauss_Pistol.png?version=d4d524ccaed37a1dff70335dd96eda9f). At best it's a hybrid round that includes a tiny electrical charge to jump start things.
---
I mixed both and it was probably the best match I ever had (I won as well with 8 kills, I uploaded it as it was NOT something I was expecting)
---
Takes a true bush wookie to bush wookie without the bush. 😁
---
I am talking about the balance between modes and there is no balance. Ur last phrase just point that out.
---
That happened to me today too and the less damage from creatures perk helps A lot if you make it to the end of the match and have scorchbeasts and whatever else all over the place. I didn't like NW at first but when I started playing it like A game of hide and seek, it became much more fun.
---
Unfortunately they removed the over repair glitch over a year, about the same time they introduced repair kits into the game. Which is a shame because over repair was actually a pretty interesting mechanic that I worked around.
---
they really don't care
---
Best place to spawn is Ingram Mansion, lockpick, at least 3 boxes and a terminal that either gives aid or a gun (last match I played the damn machine gave me a missile launcher.. no I didn't win but sure was funny
---
I always open the shutters.  Especially if the front door is locked.
---
Everyone on PC is playing Death Stranding, fo76 will grow in numbers again after everyone beats that game. Give it a couple weeks or so.
---
Oh, that’s not mine. I just saved the link to share the info since it was so well organized.
---
The radio always shutting off is why I chose a camp area that had a radio already in it.
---
Aha but you see i use the contemporary set muwhhahaha no shutters for you
---
I figured it was or wasn't, but still. Awesome find. Best I could find was the score calculator by ark
---
I have 4 PSN accounts mate. And a list of friends. I never said I didn't have any.
---
Stay banned
---
You are gonna have to pick five chems to be addicted to as that is the most. You could also get addicted to alcohol. It all depends on your build as some of those addiction will have negative effects.
---
Common addictions; Mentats, Buffout, psycho &amp; med x 
---
Worst is probably, X CELL addiction because it’s (2) to all SPECIAL.
---
Who said I had an issue with that?
---
Scorched Earth completing doesn’t interfere with you doing the quest. It didn’t affect the alt I made eight months ago when someone launched a nuke. I didn’t affect my newer mule I made a week ago when someone launched a nuke. 
---
What I’m saying is that you appear to be guessing at what happened instead of testing it. 
---
Keep doing the main questline.
---
I don't know. Her and the rest of the raiders are incongruous with the graphical elements in their camp, the corpses, the heads on spikes, etc. Even Rocksy, when you tell her that there's a familiar face going to rejoin the camp, she's amenable to giving that person she sent you to kill another chance.
---
Take care. See you in Appalachia.
---
Do a bunch of drugs, go on wild 'adventures', hit rock bottom, go to rehab. Rinse and repeat.
---
You made a good trade.  That shotgun isn't worth all that much.  I play a bloody build and would have made that trade.
---
More damage up to 5 addictions, recommend: buffout, med x, psycho, daytripper, alcohol, those give you the least drawbacks and the 5× damage bonus for junkies weapons
---
With those chems you won't even notice a difference, you'll forget they're even there :)
---
Dont blow yourself up with that Gat Plaz... LOL
---
This feels like skinner and his mother lmao
---
I'm rank 19, is it safe to assume that I should just buy and grind now
---
Get the cushioned leg mods, and try and get 1 piece with reduced fall damage by 50%
---
thing is, camperfire tails is based on time sometimes as are many other events and simply put, a lot of the times waiting for the new players to do things would be pointless and lead to the event failing. Based on what you said, which i am assuming is killing naya, if you dont kill her before kindling runs out, you fail so why put that responsibility on someone who can maybe kill it when you can for sure kill it. You gotta understand its a double standard. You dont have fun when we play but we dont get to do anything if we play the way you want us to so I'd rather i get to do something and you get a consultation prize than no one getting anything. Adding to that, either response warrants hate. People get mad at high lvl players killing stuff and people get mad when they dont. And another thing is, everyone had went through it, you are not the only person whos been lvl 32, literally everyone lvl 33+ has been there. Like Im not gonna lie, I would appreciate lvl specific servers. Low lvls dont have fun playing with us and we sure as hell dont have fun playing with them becase this games lvl scaling system is stupid. Like if its not time based yah thats a dick move but also applies vice versa for you when its time based. It wouldnt be fair to make everyone fail the event just so you can slowly kill the insects.
---
Thank you I hate when this happens
---
There's meant to be 26 (your-Max level) super mutants.
---
15 (lower level) super mutants. 
---
16 mutant hounds. 
---
2 turrets.
---
Private servers can yield you a couple more.
---
I did the maths two days ago but deleted the document.
---
I mean do they have any reaction at all once it's done or the game just pretends nothing ever happened?
---
Ok grandma :)
---
I'm not an expert either, but I've played New Vegas, FO3, FO4, and the representation of the Raiders in FO76 is drastically different from all of the other games. These are like 'proto-Raiders' like something has to happen to them to eventually turn them into the Raiders we seen in the later games.
---
Same
---
I don't think teams are really anything but solo players joining for the bonuses.  I don't think I've ever been on a team that really interacted.
---
Just save up and buy it yourself? Its not that expensive.
---
Bro they said it can always change after  the 20th stop gas lighting
---
Id wait. Because buying 1 rank now (at like 19 or 20) is worth that of like .5 toward the end. Wait until the last week of the legendary run THEN purchase what you need for 100 if youre so inclined.
---
When a rank is worth 1000 SCORE vs when its worth 3000 SCORE, youre getting more for you 150 Atom to buy the 3000 SCORE ranks
---
Better leave that door open for some air flow then.
---
You can holster the weapon, that works, but it's a pita.
---
I'm not familiar with how the mod works (PS4 player), but unless you're constantly swapping out your loadouts wouldn't you be able to just go in and quickly select a perk to share with whatever loadout you're currently using? Surely any perk is better than nothing in most cases.
---
Also as someone who also has two accounts, I've got to ask, are you actually motivated to complete the season with both? I've only logged in to test a few things with my second account since the start of the season since it doesn't seem worth it to me grinding challenges for two accounts anymore. Not trying to criticize, just merely curious. Thanks for your reply btw.
---
The fact you just didn’t trade for one and earned it
---
Mad respect ✊
---
I think the title "one wasteland for all" might be the main quest. It would be really good if like you say it all goes south and they splint into multiple factions.
---
It all the same after a while once you have all the reward from the event , you only care about kill per exp ratio  and exp per hour bases
---
That's why its better to go on console.
---
The game just pretends nothing happened. I sided with raiders and the settlers just praise me for raiding the vault when i go to foundation.
---
i guess anyone wearing the nuka-rocket outfit is a synth from the future?
---
No Im 100% sure that the quest was competed. It's no longer on my quest list and I was up to that point where you need to collect the codes... i can't remember exactly but it's after the point in the bunker where you speak to modus and push the various buttons that explain each step of the nuke. 
---
I was in a group/team, someone launched a nuke and the quest popped up as competed.... I'm not guessing, that is what happened
---
If we're talking about PvE only, no rebalancing is needed. If this is about PvP, then, I agree.
---
Thanks dude! It was certainly the hardest grind in the game so far haha. That's including the faction reputation and Secret Service bullion grinds. I appreciate it!
---
I believe they detailed in the post that it’s something currently being worked on. Was never patched yet.
---
Or 76er
---
So do you have to be in withdrawal to get the bonus or do you pop these chems like they are candy?
---
u/Ladydevann will there be a rework of the legendary perk coin system as it is catastrophic like this? i mean getting to level 5000+ to max all perks seems just bad.
---
All ammo in this game is actually just a representative program and not a simulation. The velocity of arrows fired is not based on the construction of the bow. Velocity of bullets are not determined by their grain, rifling, or gas venting. The 2mm EC is not actually a piece of metal, nor is it actually being accelerated by magnets.
---
Which is why i agree with the OP.... The number of ammo types in this game is an unnecessary hindrance.
---
I mean this argument runs both way right, yah thats kind of a dick move but telling him to not do this is just essentially switching the positions of the two. At least when he tries, the event is completed whereas if you left it to the lvl 32, you probably arnt getting your treasure notes or the potential possum badge.
---
"#dontduped" I like it. Catchy.
---
Oh that’s kinda sexy in a diseased kind of way.
---
As far as I know, all 4 spawn immediately when the event starts. I've had people run ahead and get all 4 before we even get to the barricade, but I prefer to play it safe.
---
Secret service you could at least farm thru most events for the gold mr fuzzy is eating 1 million rotten hot dogs lol
---
I got the garage and love it. It also fits my camp build style better than the train car.  Not going to lie though.  If you didnt have to buy the whole bundle to get the train car, I would have both.
---
The difference between the best and worst power armor is so small that it does not make as significant difference as the numbers look like.
---
The 42% natural damage reduction does the lion's share of the work, the dr is pretty meaningless in comparison
---
Using the single hardest hitting attack in the game, a glowing super mutant behemoth's 250 damage melee hit.
---
A level 15 raider pa with it's 160 resistance will reduce the damage to \~70
---
A level 45 raider with 341 resistance will get you to \~50
---
A maxed out T-65 with it's meaty 565 will reduce it to \~45
---
That is against the attack where having the most armor makes the biggest difference, against all smaller attacks the effects are reduced significantly. 
---
For a 100 damage hit (max level scorchbeasts do 95) the difference for the 3 armors breaks down to 20, 15, 13.
---
And any shared perks, buffs, or damage resistances reduce the effects even more.
---
I play on console been back about 6 weeks got from level 78-205 and I’ve only crashed twice total since than.
---
Lol I see, didn't know why I expected anything different from Bethesda
---
If you're on xbox most likely I'll snipe one of you, leave you there, looking at you while you bleed out, one of your friends assumes its safe to revive, i snipe him and then I got 2 preys down and I wait for either of you to bleed out or for a 3rd to go down with y'all.
---
For real. The most frustrating this by far was occasionally the challenges wouldn't give tokens for some reason or another, it happened more times than it should have haha
---
I love that location I built my camp right next to it.
---
Next patch they said.
---
If you have FO1st you can place a tent in line in the sand to force them to spawn in the middle. Each wave totaling maybe 10 is 3,500-4,500 XP each time if you spray with explosive rounds to hits as many as possible. Obviously the more people there the more xp.
---
I run a bloodied build with chemical addiction immunity, I bleed the drugs out so fast I never get addicted.
---
I mean i dont think ima bad player but i and literally everyone who has an auto tesla rifle can click once and let go and clear the wave at campfire tales
---
You probably duped you cheater. Bethesda would *never* make a mistake /s
---
The train car is slightly limiting in my opinion due to it being narrow.
---
IMO Fasnacht needs to come back. It's been what feels like ages.
---
Doesnt show up till a certain faction rep lvl tho, so ig OP isnt wanting that grind.
---
And play with 10 fps? No thanks
---
extreme hide-and-seek is a hard win, but feels So good when you pull it off. 
---
ya add being unarmed to the mix?
---
Sounds like your computer has some issues, it shouldn't be crashing like that
---
We just need a new legendary effect to play with. I suggest Sentinel's so that if you're completely standing still you do more damage, the longer you stand still the more damage you do, cap to 50-75% damage increase.
---
Yeah I got my suit like you it was a grind then people duped them and I was sad haven’t worn it in a few months
---
My main is a heavy gunner with weapon weight reduction armor, and usually carry about 30 different guns so I can play to my mood, I've got most types of heavy as bloodied and junkies, and a few of the ballistic heavies as vampires (I used to carry some AA weps but I felt like they did the same damage as vampires so I dropped them on my mule)
---
I’m just waiting till they rework the ammo converter to even bother with this bs
---
I mean I dont have any problems with any other games, be they Bethesda games or otherwise CoD etc.
---
I have a 1080 and an I7-6700, and I rarely crash of have any serious problems playing.  Not sure why you're having issues, but most people don't have the problems you have been.
---
I've never had a crash, that might be why.
---
I was farming for the tokens to get the giant mr fuzzy got it then accidentally scrapped him. RIP giant fuzzy 😢
---
Not on your high level!
---
It does about 2% damage on the level 40 mole miner legendaries so I think I am safe
---
What do gat lasers need to be crafted? I dont have the recipe
---
Pennywise? More like nickeldumb
---
If you're talking about the giant fuzzy bear, you can't actually display it at all. I made the great mistake of buying it, thinking I'd be able to put it with the rest of my teddies in a display case, and sorely found out it was a waste of tokens
---
I want eddie cochram on the radio. Cmon everybody was on the trailer!!!
---
Yeah, but Right Leg was a bitch. Got 3 stars of every other Unyielding piece on the first try (10 modules at a time), but that right leg took like 15 tries.
---
i have the exact same combo with crashing being VERY rare, and i have 3 mods installed.
---
I wonder how long they will keep folks 'suspended'. I wasn't around the last ban wave but I heard the suspensions were rough too
---
Yes thats was my intention also. Was a real bummer I hope they can change that later.
---
No I'm hunting one haha
---
I'll give it a whirl. Currently [this](https://imgur.com/a/UH5Xw17) is what I did to the shotgun.
---
i was wondering why that was all fucked up.
---
having to "turn on" an event i just joined was starting to make me a little crazy.
---
I want Whitesprings to be cannonically nuked and become a little glowing sea high lvl area
---
I still have some elusive mods to make. In order to keep the game fresh, I stopped crafting ammo a year ago. It is more fun to be forced to use different weapons. For example: I have no more 45, so I had to replace my fixer with a bloodied SMG. And it became my favourite. An instigating western revolver was my critter gun, until I ran out of 44 and had to start using a 308 antiarmor explosive pistol. 
---
It's fun.
---
I've seen a lot more quitting posts from people fed up with the SBQ being taken down in less than a minute with hacked weapons and being shut out of rewards. those are people who will never spend money. And the rampant cheating hurts the game's reputation so even more will never try it. 
---
I don't get the lure of cheating in a game. I get that people do it to make real money but screwing over legit players to do it doesn't seem kosher. And duping weapons does screw them over because it blows up the in game economy, which doesn't need much help in that regard.
---
I crafted 22 left legs yesterday and didn’t once roll an unyielding one...
---
A knife, a revolver and a long gun. I like to keep it realistic.
---
Just leveled up like 5 times by doing this. Thanks 😂
---
Molotovs are your friends.
---
you can put all workbench+ammo converter+bed+sink on the garage, at least I could put all that lol
---
&gt;something has to happen to them to eventually turn them into the Raiders we seen in the later games
---
Time.  That's what changes things.  Many, many years of dealing with the new circumstances will change many things.
---
Aside from that, it's a wee bit early in the story to jump to the 'happily ever after' option.  I'd say we have a few decades of development to work through before we get to that point (if we ever do).
---
Yeah totally agreed lol the lines between genres are blurred enough as it is haha.
---
Can Do perk and white springs resort trash cans had me at 20 items on no time.
---
The last couple of days have been pretty bad. I've had 2-3 crashes per day, ”stopped working” popup message. Believe it or not, it's gotten much better than it was.
---
I want that stash box so bad.
---
Between that, and the 0-options available for changing the pip boy color is really a bit of a slap in the face for the visually impaired.  
---
If it were me, I'd be raising a (polite) fuss with BGS about the issue.
---
Gauss minigun do not use pure energy ammo. Makes no Sense to use cores since Its a Ballistic round. How you are going to fit ballistics rounds in a core....
---
Hammer, wep is duped, he was offloading it...
---
Blanket statement for like 25% of the game
---
Nice you have most of the perfect mods for it id rather use a hardened receiver but if your going for crit damage i guess its fine if your running a vats crit build
---
Todd swings the ban hammer because you're not dedicated enough. Bye Felicia.
---
Sorry, I don't speak Latin.
---
Zorbo is just a representation of time, each space he moves is another day gone from the season, the remaining spaces are days left. If you have just been doing dailies and weeklies and not much extra SCORE grinding, then chances are you are not supposed to catch him until possibly the last week or two.
---
West-Tek &gt;&gt;&gt; Huntersville &gt;&gt;&gt; NIRA &gt;&gt;&gt; Harper's Ferry &gt;&gt;&gt; Whitespring &gt;&gt;&gt; Charleston Capitol
---
Go back to camp, turn game off, wait 5 minutes for the Private World to reset, repeat.
---
zorbo comes and kills you good riddance scrub
---
They are banning people who are connected to the duping. Bethesda has wised up to how people will create alternate accounts and use those to transfer items to their main or "seller" accounts.  If he bought a duped weapon from the vendor bot, then they will assume he is connected to the duper who put it there.
---
Also they pull up the items off of an inventory history list and able to track down how it ended up in somebody's inventory.
---
Makes sure you do your adventure challenges first as they can bug out from playing NW
---
Idk I’ve heard stories of some people already being unbanned and other receiving emails saying they will be unbanned in the upcoming days
---
Lunchboxes dont heal you though, so I dont think they're related. Does healing factor also affect other timed  effects? Btw I have healing factor
---
What flaws exactly do you mean? Tbh I was surprised the legendary run itself worked pretty damn fine (except the score/daily autocompletion bug, but it's an older bug).
---
I would hope not
---
I generally use a 10mm smg but id never face the queen without my trusty minigun
---
the gamepass version has more problems than the steam edition. and on console it usually works halfway decent.
---
Or if you stuff in ridiculous amounts of money
---
Crashing that bad is most likely not due to the game. Have you followed some basic tech support guides and updated your drivers?
---
Is the free TB on the drive you’ve installed 76 on?
---
The ghille outfit was limited time, so unfortunately you’ll never be able to get it unless you do some hacker-things. My condolences if you were interested in picking it up.
---
Maybe, but I never heard of Ghost of Tsushima (?) until this post, so .... maybe not?
---
To each their own.
---
So, I play from 12am to 3am pacific time because that is when my wife and 6 year old child are asleep and I can have some me time. I am lvl 101 and these are the things i've noticed since the bans at that time of night. I hopped servers 10 times on Tuesday and only found one nuked area.  There were only three highly ranked visible players each time I bounced to another server. Last night in the same time frame i found two higher ranked players after 12 server bounces. Only 1 nuked area and i had not been active for some time. 
---
Pros:
---
I farm resource bases so no PVP since the bans. I can't tell you how many times i put the effort into to build a place only to have a 400+ come in and take over. usually for about 20 minutes, they log off and i take it back. 
---
If i'm on a team I can usually have them help me kill off the higher level player and I share the spoils with them upon getting the base back. 
---
At lvl 101, its me and usually two higher lever players for events with a bunch of lower level players. I make sure to let the lower level players get their hits on enemy so that we all get the good rewards.
---
Cons:
---
Much less nukes going off. 
---
Less people buying from my vendors.
---
Just my observations. If you play from 12am - 3am pacific, let me know, i'd be happy to roll on Shabas with you.
---
I use daytripper, daddyo, mentats, medx n alcohol. The draws backs are not noticable on a rifle build. You get 10% damage up to 50% for being addicted. You can use chems to suppress the downside of addiction but still maintain damage.
---
What would you like to spend it on? I spent mine on secret service armor plans, but that's not for everyone.
---
At rank 5 it allows you to make 300% more ammo. Also, it may not seem like much, but if you (like a sane person) only craft ultracite ammo in larger quantities you will have a supernumerary amount of munitions
---
The only joke was those response
---
SS armour, Gauss shotty, Gauss minigun, Ammo machine, dirt tiles, t65 armour... Depends on what you have already bought and what your build is I guess.
---
Yep, same old content for the last 18 months. 
---
Wastelanders was good but once it's done it's done.
---
Games and updates usually come out in the same day
---
It’s a playstation exclusive that’s fairly big, I think. Kind of like Assassin’s Creed set in Feudal Japan.
---
*satisfied and superior tone*
---
"Baaaaaaaaaaaaa ..."
---
SS jet pack
---
Watched both of your clips. I can't even be bothered listing and countering any of the ridiculous reasoning you've given. It's all  bullshit. 
---
I honestly hope your friends (and you) are banned for life. The game is much better off without you and your scummy mates. 
---
Fucking cheat.
---
I’m so close, I have enough for the head, but that suit is miles away. Saw someone selling tokens in their vendor (for like 367c each) hard pass.
---
I’ve got just a bit under you.  I’m going to buy Strangler Heart PA since I missed the Vault 94 event when I took a break from the game.  
---
If I wasn’t getting that, I’d be getting SS armor.
---
Jetpack on ss chest, gauss shotgun, chemist/grocer backpack, the rest if the ss gear and mods, ammo machine. About that order.
---
I do like all the chonky bois at the Whitespring golf club. And for double XP weekends I hit the robots too. Those sentry bots given a ton of XP.
---
What does the message say exactly? Is it after installing and trying to launch the game or is it when trying to install it? Need more info, system specs would be handy too. Is it talking about ram, vram or harddrive space?
---
I chose the highest place you climb to make my camp and play Hermit. No critters up here either so I don't need turrets.
---
Have you ever thought that exhausting all the content meant you were done with the game and didn't have to continue playing it?
---
I think the YouTuber juice Head has a video and within it it contains a location where you can purchase the compound bow before you reach a satisfactory level with a faction. This video is made about a month ago or more.
---
Not everyone is on ps4, they dont have to change their schedule just to suit one platform.
---
Yes.
---
Truth. And maybe not yeeting legendary corpses into oblivion
---
I share Philanthropist. It fills your teammates hunger and thirst when you eat or drink, so when I share it we are basically sharing hunger and thirst bars. 9 Charisma.
---
&gt;!Commie scum!&lt;
---
Keep the gold for yourself Don't worry about them. You're doing all the hopping around on the map.
---
I'm running a Junkie Commando build and I picked up a Junkie's FFR Railway Rifle from Murmrgh a while ago. I'm still grinding to get the automatic receiver, I can't wait to see how ridiculous it is. So far I haven't found a weapon I couldn't tame the recoil on thanks to using KB&amp;M - even my JFFR 10mm SMG - but I think my Railway will finally break that streak.
---
Nope, I love Fallout 76 and still play. Just saying we need new stuff to do especially since it's advertised as a "game as a service".
---
They just need more new events and activities that can't be completed.
---
The legendary run isn't content.
---
i just hope u wernt in a team, im sick of gettin teammates in gillies doing that all the time while im fighting another team next to them.
---
Whats the ammo machine?
---
proper
---
Guess you weren’t the first to get it all.
---
The reputation grind for Raiders/Settlers is very shallow and tedious. It's no fun to do. Scrip I can gather by playing the game. Reputation is the same quests over and over for months. Sure I can hunt for the random encounters and shoot some mirelurks for raiders, but the reputation gain is minimal. Even more annoying is when one raider or settler dies during the encounter and it just happens to be the person to give you the rep --&gt; no rep gain.  
---
Looking forward to start the grind all over on my alt character.... as the turbo-fertilizer is a gimmick, I probably will focus on the raiders. That kinda hurts my heart as a roleplayer. I would like to support the Settlers, but it makes more sense to favor the raiders in the quest options. Mainquest pick Raiders, Davenport pick spying on Settlers.  
---
I think Raiders and Settlers should have own (weekly) objectives. Like how they do it with SCORE. Link it to faction events and random encounters. Put in items like the "technical data" for the repeatable BOS quest. We already have treasury notes, so give them their own currency. I am not a big fan of currency, but I think it's the easiest to implement.
---
i started with the ammo machine, waste of money, then i got the ss armor and the jet pack, worth it, then got the gauss mini and modded it, worth it but ammo is so expensive that i only bring it out for special occasions, then i got the 65 pa, not sure if it's worth as i've maybe worn it twice and still working on getting the mods for it.
---
This subject is so old...
---
The answer will always be get the eff off the tents.
---
It's double XP. I just went from rank 59 to rank 67 in like 4 hours from the dailies but mostly from the repeatable... The dailies are basically a bonus. The real score comes from that repeatable if you are maximizing your XP gain. I was getting like 2300 xp per Super Mutant Warlord tonight.
---
His comment is about about the super mutants and scorched. Modus had been dark for quiet sometime. I believe Gen. Santiago's Rebels Destroyed modus uplink to the kovac muldoon not long after the bombs fell. Effectively leaving modus blind to the outside world until the vault dweller comes knocking. 
---
Once the uplink is reestablished. Modus can literally see the whole area from the satellite platform. The enclave expected some mutations but not to the extent mutations have spread in Appalachia.
---
wrong, nw is buggeg out and you can unlock it
---
You know what's also not fun?
---
Killing the bitch 30 times and STILL not getting credit for it.
---
I just shout at players to get off the survival tents and she lands every time.
---
A lot of people mention bodyguards, but does it make sense to share. If equipped it gives a bonus to you and everyone in your team - but if shared does it give 4 times the bonus if you have 4 players on your team? Because if so, it is a no brainer to share it.
---
According to this I'm right on track so far. Phew. I was worried. Especially since some people are so much further than I am ahead :/
---
You don't need to be in withdrawal, you get the bonus just for having the addictions. So you can use the chem to suppress its withdrawal effect and still benefit from junkies.
---
I have collected around 1800 or so Halloween candy that I use for this challenge, makes it soooooo easy and it weighs next to nothing.
---
Or look in a lunchbox! It's not that hard!
---
Sure do!
---
I may be wrong. I was having that issue. I think that she has to be your SBQ, as in you’re the one who launched the nuke.
---
The actual game is pretty good once you get into it. I’m on PS4 though so once you actually play the game you’ll see it’s not so bad
---
I’d love to be able to remove my silencer on the fly, lots of guns in this game have awesome sounds but my stealth build requires a suppressor. It would be neat though to remove it and go loud just for fun sometimes.
---
(Handmade, Lever Action Rifle, SMG, etc. All have awesome sounds with the suppressor. Hell I liked the Handmade sound so much back in Fallout 4, I replaced the RU556 Assault Rifle’s sound with it. Did the same for the Deliverer, gave it the pipe revolver sound and it came out awesome.)
---
If player doesn't stands on the navmeshed ground (aka ground) AI will use its range attack instead of melee.
---
Even the bos bunker seems to missing proper path finding.
---
Been fighting many sb and sbq. And sometimes they land right away.
---
Fudge ok. Guess I'm waiting till tomorrow for the resupply. Do you know what time it resets?
---
thought the same. i dont want to farm for xp buffs so i just had a cranberry cobbler, lovers embrace and the double xp bonus which gave over 670 xp for a lvl 68 super mutant and more than 3,1k xp for vital equipment. afterwards i realized, i even forgot to equip inspirational 3. im not really into math and numbers and dont want to spend too much time on buff managing, i just want to play. but as conclusion, these numbers seem to be really high to me too.
---
Well done! That’s a great pic by the way, the radstorm in the background is awesome.
---
It’s part of the overseer’s journey quest, sitting right on the table outside. Have the quest active as you approach, and it should be more visible.
---
Just got home, IGN Chasewinfall.
---
Nice! Looks awesome. Gotta love those perfectly timed radstorm photo ops!
---
Gotta ask though.. why are there stairs in front of your garage? Are the foundations too low to place ramps?
---
No the XP values are strange. I killed 3 of the same level ghouls in a row and got like 126, 146, and 162 xp. Sometimes it's the same amount but for the most part I've been getting random XP. I also use group to boost it with inspirational and then use well rested bonus, and other food items that are supposed to boost your XP. Its given me good progress so far. Went from 127 to 136 in a couple of hours.
---
I don't know why the fuck they would end it...only way to make it reasonable is to keep the 9 dailies...because I'm already tired of this grindy bullshit.
---
Pick the 5 addictions that will least affect your build. Just don't go with X-cell. -1 to all stats is terrible.
---
Those other games can conflict with fallout 76
---
ya thats been happening a lot more lately with legendary enemies. I think its linked to all the dupers. their overloading the servers and despawning enemies and lagging the game out hard.
---
If you go to the barn for project bean stalk there is a bunch of bags of chlorine. Five or six. Those yield acid. That's where I go. I'm sorry I forgot the name of the farm.
---
I run with pretty much every mutation, coupled with herd mentality, strange in numbers and class freak the bonuses are huge and downside negligible.
---
Decide on a backpack mod, then get the Secret Service Underarmor and Shielded Lining for it.
---
All that will only set you back 800 bullion.
---
Me and my friend have very old Dragons. We like to kneel side by side and fire simultaneously. We enjoy the smoke clouds.
---
Oh ok. Sounds like fun. I run a bloody commando and bloody melee so it will be different. Now what sort of perks should I look at? Sorry if I have too many questions.
---
Fair enough. Wild times
---
available when reaching max reputation with the raiders, plan costs 750 gold bullion. it produces a selected ammo type. its really nice and the only reason, im still grinding those daily quests.
---
Then why the fuck did I waste my time grinding that shit?
---
Launched on her today with no problem. She was dead in like 7 minutes. She landed plenty of times. I think it’s a mixture of tents and people not giving her a steady target to attack. (I also centered my nuke so the eastern edge of the radius barely touched Fissure Site Alpha).
---
Its not like I’m running any of them at the same time
---
idk I never run in pussyfist mode
---
Might have been duped (more than likely) so just watch out from now on it’s easy to get caught up in dupes and with how bans are atm who knows if u could get the hammer
---
i did too man, idk what to tell ya, even the halloween and christmas drop from last year are bugged and unlockable right now
---
Thanks anyway buddy
---
I didn't know that was a reward. I guess back to grinding reputation.
---
My husband just bought this from the atomic shop the other day bit can't find it in the builder's menu. Can anyone help us find it?
---
It definitely drops the value in ammo trade in other subs for 76.
---
Oh man too many. Lol
---
Junkies handmade, junkies railway for pvp (since vats is broken) a 10mm pistol for low level mobs and my prized 3* shovel with reduced weight!!
---
It's a legit win. Don't let anyone tell you anything else
---
Got 11 passive wins playing BushWookie during the Xmas event.
---
Bushwookies unite!
---
Still Missing:
---
- Goat White
---
- Goat Black
---
- Black Bear
---
- Firefly Off/On
---
- Alien
---
- Fish
---
I'm pretty sure the auto receiver is a plan. no need to craft and scrap.
---
there's no such thing as recoil control with an automatic railway. it's funny, really. I can kinda hit a large group of ghouls if they're clumped together. and half the shots are still misses.
---
it's a great weapon.
---
I farmed 15 lvls on west tek running 2 lunchbox and 4 Mama's stew, the xp fluctuates from 475 to 676 on enemies with the same name and lvl. something isn't right but I like it, farmed from 85 to 100
---
Its sold for 750 bullion by the raiders at max rep. Its like a smaller version of the ammo maker at that one workshop. It makes ammo for free. No steel or other junk needed. It won’t make boat loads of ammo but let it run for a bit and it will make some decent amounts. I can usually get 200-300 .45 ammo an hour. Sometimes more. 
---
It won’t make 2mm or explosive ammo. I believe it can make flamer fuel  but i might be wrong. 
---
If nothing else its free money set it to make 5.56 or shotgun shells and stick them in your vending machine.
---
100k exp. that’s outrageous. So much. That’s almost 5 levels at level 240. Or if you’re doing the Grindy boring elements of the daily’s and weekly’s. Like completing events. Leveling up and building and finding stuff......I call that playing the game.....you’ll get it easily. This generation with its self entitlement is laughable.
---
SOULS-LIKE
---
No karma today.
---
Try again tomorrow
---
Wrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
---
Yeah, i like it too, but it feels weird getting so many levels and legendary run levels in such little time.
---
Two. My main gauss shotgun and my backup gauss shotgun, for when my main breaks unexpectedly.
---
There’s no reason to carry anymore.
---
they’ll vaguely threaten and insult you when you visit crater or foundation that’s about it
---
The car is bigger than you think. I fit plenty of stash boxes, shelves, displays, a tinkers bench, weapons bench, armor bench, stove, sink, bar, and bed in there. Power armor display probably wouldn’t work well in it, but just saying the car is bigger than you might expect.
---
You on Xbox. I think I have a bloodied plaama pistol you coul have.
---
It’s great. My gf and I use it a lot. Lately worlds have been super populated. Even after the ban wave (this week specifically). So many glitch weapons or people one shotting legendaries etc. had 6 people sit on a tent at our nuke tonight and sbq did not land ONCE. It took like over 20 minutes I’m not even joking, we almost left towards the end. She wouldn’t even hover, just air strike after air strike. So when we experience this we go private and enjoy everything to ourselves. Then the junk stash is just added bonus, same with tent. And the atoms you get comes semi close to cost of membership I think? I have way more atoms than I can spend just from 1st even after this week which I thought was decent and I had just bought the red rocket bundles.
---
It gets a lot of hate, but if fo76 is one of your main games, I think you’d find it worth while, and you can always cancel/renew whenever.
---
We already know you're 27, Jason
---
yeh I think is to make low lvls from the game pass  level faster and get used to the game. I like it I wish they could let a tive on all the weekends hehehe.
---
Tee hee they won't fix, that I guarantee it.
---
Rad Rumble will be a lot harder with max level ghouls.
---
Wait wth why is this not trending
---
Wait wth why is this not trending yet
---
He can kill you, you will do 0 damage to him if you are in pacifist.
---
Awesome thanks for the information use 45, and plasma cores. So that will help alot.
---
I just started playing today during double XP and have been getting the rewards just as outlined in that, so it’s behaving accordingly
---
Uranium Fever I'd definitely going to stay the way it is unless they add stronger mole miners
---
Oh and are you forgetting something. Like the several thousand score from weeklys?
---
clearly this is a super secret double double XP week, you did well to notice it
---
I love my Swing speed shovel. It makes the most satisfying sound when you smack something.  It's not op but its fun to use on trash mobs.
---
Oh! I forgot about that! Thanks!
---
I used one mutation for about a week and used a ton of radaway with SG 1.  I got worried and did SG2 because of this thread, but SG1 seems to have some lock-in.
---
it is all about PvE and PvP. and yes, rebalancing is needed. for berserker just +50% more damage to be able to oneshot if u ve been spoted. Mind u it is not a crazy buff. As for perks I would love to see +20% more additional damage and +20% AP boost or -20%AP cost for sprinting and VATS when u have 0 damage resistance or less than 50 bcz of a mutation which gives u 50DR + 50ER.
---
Sometimes during some PVP shenanigans with other high level players, I'll disconnect the vending so its harder for them to find my camp and forget to turn it back on.
---
Sorry, they have no time fixing game-breaking bugs that cause you to deal  0 damage and you have to kill the same enemy 5x and waste ammo just for it to die. 
---
This is the issue since the start and Bethesda doesn't seem to be bothered. I guess because they are not losing any $$$.
---
Use covert ops, 276 headshot
---
We should buff the bad ones, add in new ones and give more variety
---
sigh, i actually came back to fallout76 because they added bows to the game.
---
then i found out that it's bugged in vats. major letdown. lost interest real fast.
---
if you have any other stuffed animals, check to see if they're in the same row. I found mine in the same row as the cat in the space suit.
---
You know they dupe on burner accounts, right?
---
u cant tank damage if u go with berserker. u kinda have to dodge damage and run and maybe use autoaim with VATS. so ur perk is ok only for lazy stealth build.
---
Pretty sure buffs wear off quicker if you fast travel often.
---
didn't anyone tell you we're racing for pinks?
---
Wow just wow cant believe Bethesda would do this considering the fan base for the bs they have been doing lately is dwindling down. I hope all goes well and you get back in.
---
I’m swapping loadouts pretty frequently, and it’s hard to say what is useful for a group that I can actually share from my loadout- I don’t have many 1star cards in most of my loadouts, and I only have 4 charisma on my active characters.
---
My second account is purely a mule/vendor account, so I’m not trying to work on the season at all. On PC I can run both accounts simultaneously- I’ve been “benefiting” from groups for long before Public Groups were a thing ;) Empath, Strange in Numbers, Herd Mentality, extra free fast travel points, safe transfer of equipment... the benefits went far beyond just having extra storage. Hell a second account when I bought it was like $20 bucks... far better benefits than 2 months of fallout first, it’s still a no-brainer for me.
---
Gatling plasma uses plasma cores.
---
I had 2 regular (one legendary and one regular, but both not queens) fly away from me today.  One flew so far it despawned. The other flew to the end of a cell and hung there until I ran to the edge of the cell and it reengaged me, finally.
---
I'm sick of them taking forever to land, leaving the ground right away.  Scorch beasts are not fun.  If I could cripple a wing so it couldn't fly and then finish it, that would be one thing, but they've been broken since beta.
---
Very smart, friend. thanks! I only have 1 plushie so I guess I just missed it.
---
Same thing with flamer fuel, it’s notorious for crafting materials (tons of acid and oil for small yield) but it’s cheaper to just craft flamers with super duper, giving 50 fuel with each craft and if you use scrapper you actually gain steel because of the super duper bonus.
---
Mutants should apply for every mutation we have? And not just cap on 10% which is useless.
---
Or option 4, do it myself.
---
It’s not so bad in vats. Just time pulling the string correctly
---
I sold ammo at 1 cap each. cores sold at 1 cap per 10 percentage. This was before the ammo converter.  Now all goes into it. Plans/ recipes go for 1 cap each no matter the rarity.  Sells quickly. Boobleheads/magazines at ten caps. Screws, acid, ballistic weave sell quickly a few under list price.
---
Didnt hapen to me yet... Are you using any mods? Try to disable them all if that helps just to check if its the game or mods.
---
Damn Autobots... come on Optimus, this ain't no click bait. It's just a bit of a laugh at the current situation.
---
The battle is better when people don't stand on tents or fences.
---
better to go to all events to tag enemies and boost ur lvl. there is no need to slowly progress ur fo76 experience.
---
This is why I love the duper’s that just redistribute shit I feel like it really hurts some of those sellers lol
---
No mods. Xbox player here.
---
Angry turtle did a video on ap recharge modifiers for armour. One piece made a huge difference when he used two pieces the second piece had very little effect.
---
You are right with the critical hits not being worth much but the accuracy boost is great.
---
I mean.. it’s the truth but whatever
---
I can't help it when my taps are 3500+ damage and I 1shot most mobs. I don't mean to be that guy I normally wait for others to get a hit in but sometimes I just don't pay attention and Bam I just killed the 3* legendary because he wanted to see what my fist looks like up close. If your in arms reach and I don't see the green glow I'm dropping you like a used rubber from a one night stand.
---
done that,  still didn't count.
---
That’s not normal? Admittedly I only did line in the sand once (I’m level 47) and when I did it they all spawned in one giant group right next to the emitter we were supposed defend. There were 4 other players plus me. I had a 1* anti-armor .50 cal. One person had a Gauss Shotgun and another had a Gauss Minigun. All I did was sweep back and forth to tag as many as I could before the Gauss guys turned them to paste.
---
Thank you for the advice!
---
If I fast travel a long distance, then my disease will usually wear off, as well as most of my other buffs.
---
-A Non legendary Fixer with a .38 receiver for low level roaming.
---
-A silenced Instigating Lever for sneaky surprise headshots.
---
-A Zealots Handmade (till I find a Furious or AA) for faster fire rate “shit hits the fan” situations.
---
trust me, i tried very hard to work it. missing the intial shot 90% of the time even though you have max % chance of hitting really pisses me off. i wish they could just fix such a critical bug instead of us trying to play around it.
---
same goes for the gauss rifle.
---
it's like when the game was released and a LOOONG time after that, plasma weapons were simply unusable because the projectiles flew through everything. they just dont care about stuff like this
---
Hell I hope I don’t mind losing, all I found really worth while that may have been duped was a BE lmg for 10k and a BFFR handmade for 5k
---
I do have a extensive FR, that may be a cause
---
We should really be allowed to name and shame. Good on you for trying to do something nice though.
---
Yea i noticed that when the mobs spawn at lower level when you load into a private server at the location your trying to grind at. 
---
To remedy this just make sure you spawn at a neaby location that you want to grind at. Your camp works too.
---
She does to the high level guys that join the event and don't bother with power armor anymore. There's always one getting downed multiple times.
---
That requires there to be 1 survival tent to be in a spawn zone outside the gate. And then it's wonderful mayhem.
---
Ohhhh that makes sense. Thank you!
---
Yeah so is it fair if a low level joins a high level event and hides in the corner and let's the high levels do all the work? Because I see a lot of events like that too... high levels aren't doing it to be jerks. Sometimes you just log on and hop to the event. And today I was one hitting enemies and I didn't mean to but accidents happen.
---
You people need to chill. When the pass was introduced it seemed like we werent gonna get all of it for free; that pissed all of us. But with all of the extra dailies they added and the double SCORE weekend (wich will last 4 days) we are gona get there. If you do all your dailies then dont worry. Im even skipping most NW challenges and still expect to get all the way there.
---
BuT LAtEr yOU aRe GoiNg tO pRogReSS SloWeR. Yes... I know. And on Tuesdays I progress a lot thanks to the weekly challenges. That is irrelevant. The point is, at the end of the season, with 70 days + all of the bonus it wont be an issue.
---
Yeah apparently that’s just when a survival tent is in the spawn zone outside the gate
---
I feel your pain. My score is gonna fall behind when the destroy all humans remake comes out at the end of the month. But it sounds like your really excited for GoT. My advice go enjoy ghost of tsushima. this probably won’t be the only double xp weekend. Its just the only one announced so far. We are only week 3 of a 10 week event. Plenty of time to catch up or purchase ranks when that option becomes available.
---
Now that you mention it. I do remember seeing a tent there and was like “that’s a weird place to camp since this event doesn’t happen all the time”
---
There are mods that were "forgotten." They were supposed to add them in later but they haven't yet.
---
Might want to share your platform.
---
You're 100% right, that's why I'm here with my 'apology essay' admitting it. It would be hypocritical for me to let my friend get banned and not admit to my part in the process. 
---
The game will be much poorer for my friend's absence, both as a gregarious papa bear, an intellectual sparring partner, and a giving friend to all who meet him.
---
https://youtu.be/9SJLI6jkBRU
---
I think they will reimplement crippling her wings to force her to land. Not sure tho but really hope its true.
---
I’m literally watching this show now!
---
Check the market subs.
---
I feel they could get some miles out of reskin enemies.  Make it so that if you nuke certain areas, you get reskin boss versions of foes. For example, you fire a nuke at Charleston, you get a Orange color glowing one that was the former Mayor or something. Keep spawning ghouls as you fight him, gives some score or gold for fighting him, and bang. Simple boss fight
---
The Queen is overall a basic, but good boss fight. Alot of fun to face. However, more targets would be nice and maybe even raise the drop chance on rare gear fo others. Want some Forest Camo Enclave gear, nuke the Whitespring and have the Frank, the Secret Service Securitytron spawn and attack. I would love for differences in fight but ill take anything then nothing
---
You shouldn’t have “accidentally gone into god mode for pvp”. Also right before that comment you made a post asking if the “youtubers making videos abusing god mode XP glitch will be punished or not.” Soo I’m thinking maybe you tested out a god mode xp glitch video you watched and got banned for it lol? That took like two seconds maybe delete those before making a post like this.
---
Not op but what are they
---
It seems to be happening a lot more recently - possibly less active worlds since #banwave?
---
Id say gg to you, playing it smart. But ggn't to Bethesda for making a battle royale that is best played in a pacifist way.
---
Great, if I knew that I wouldn't have wasted the bullion on buying the armor plans. Now I Really feel ripped off.
---
Should be like 5 percent per up to like 7 or 8. Maybe even all.
---
Nocturnal should not reduce damage, or just increase sneak multiplier by 50%
---
Mutants slayer should have a high chance to stagger enemies or deal increased damage to enemies with high health.
---
Ghoul slayer should cripple limbs and deal more damage to staggered enemies
---
Assassins should have radiation damage
---
Zealots should do bonus damage to In air enemies and decrease scorched damage
---
Hunters should deal poison damage
---
Exterminators should deal flame damage
---
Executioners should deal exponential more damage the lower the health
---
Suppressors should break armored and increase the damage you do to them
---
Furious should work like adrenaline
---
Instigating should have a flat damage buff on top
---
Stalkers should just have increased damage the farther you are away
---
Vampires should get a 5% damage buff per kill until it maxes at like 15%
---
Medics shoudl heal team members when you hit them
---
I have a full set in my stash box waiting for the deep pocket mod. I use the chest piece only so I can use the jet pack.
---
It's awesome and mind-blowing, one of the best things I've seen in the last couple years. Enjoy it!
---
So I have something to do when I visit your CAMP. I turn on your radios too.
---
Might be a touch young... 17
---
Man some people just suck.
---
Well since there is a new group of players and more to come it would be a nice edition
---
I crafted a bitchin 3 star unyielding torso on my 2nd try. No unyielding on any of the limbs so far after 15 tries.
---
*Especially* considering the autocomplete bugs wreaking havoc on the number of challenges we can do; today for instance out of today's 9 daily challenges: **8** autocomplete themselves! Which would be an especially bad loss of progress if they go back to 7 dailies! 
---
This wasn't so bad with the old system but now that each season is time-limited? A string of bad luck with this glitch could ruin even the most dedicated player's efforts.
---
Just in case I'm uninformed, is there any way to fix this bug? Thanks for any input, support or feedback anyone can give me, I really appreciate it.
---
This happened to me once except it was a bear stuck in my foundation 😬
---
Fake news. You people just don't understand/observe Scorchbeast behavior. She follows same rules.
---
Source?
---
I believe I should catch/pass him by next week. I'm 3 spaces behind him. He's currently on space 49 so 51 days left.  
---
What you miss would be where ever you are at the end of the season to the end of the race.  
---
Here's all the [rewards](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons) for the season.
---
I think its fine like that... its a very strong weapon and it needs a downside. If you are really having issues making the amo, prime the weapon and equip ammoshith and super duper. Also, in less than a month we will get legendary perks and one seems to allow you to craft even more ammo.
---
Was it docile or did it try to attack you?
---
Fish in a barrel to the pvp folks.
---
Yup I’m new. 1500 hours level 70 almost on the legendary run but wtf do I know? I clear west tek multiple times a server with a plasma caster which leaves goo piles and this hasn’t been an issue for months. Maybe once a server I’ll see a headless body. It’s nothing like it was before.
---
I'm sorry your right its 38 by today
---
Well, they already introduced the ability to skip levels with atoms. The main idea of the whole thing was not to let everyone finish the run with ease. The grind part is here to incentivize some people to spend atoms (as in cash for atoms) to finish faster. It would be counterintuitive for the devs to work in the opposite direction making season run easier for more people.
---
Yup
---
A purge of high level dupers. Fallout 76 will begin anew with these lower levels eventually becoming the new "old" guard.
---
level 32 can't complete campfire tales? It's a level 20 event. Not even switching positions- not being a dick still gets him his rewards, AND doesn't screw other players out of their potential rewards. I do it all the time- in fact I just "carried" a couple lowlevels through Uranium Fever after I started it and a level 17 and level 34 showed up in it. I ran around and dropped all the mole miners to 20-30% health, kept their attention, and let the lowlevels finish them off. I didn't even change my weapons,  I just changed my perks, and with Perk Loadout Manager that's super super easy to do. If I didn't have PLM I'd just carry a tesla rifle, though. It's not hard not to be a dick.
---
Fucking same the other night. I got up off the couch, put the controller down, and went off to bed. Wife was hella confused lmao!
---
Oh he very much wanted to eat me.
---
I'll hop on, been on the phone.
---
Get a flechette harpoon gun, shoot any corpse, infinite harpoons.
---
The conversion rate isn't great, but it's literally free aside from the cost of repairing the harpoon gun every hundred or so shots.
---
See 50% cores are kind of useless when you can get 9 full cores in 20 min by just holding all three power plants. Intend to just drop all of those when ever I do SBQ or nuke zones for other people who may run out
---
Just heads-up, it is absolute garbage.
---
I'm having this problem to! It's a pain in the ass! I don't understand why this game is always breaking and buggy. Hope I don't get banned for trying to exit power armor.
---
If you open the last level reward's description in game, you'll see there is another 500 atoms reward inside, btw.
---
she does this whether people are on tents or not
---
Agreed.
---
Accidental godmode can happens sometimes. Even if your turned into dust you can still have godmode somehow. 
---
Also don’t take my post out of context about YouTubers. I was asking can there be a suspension wave for people who abused the SCORE system.
---
And also I didn’t test it out. It would be stupid for me just to say I want a suspension wave on people who abused e SCORE glitch Using godmode just for me to test out godmode.
---
I suggest deleting the game. Delete it. Move on to an etch-a-sketch for something more challenging.
---
Also, don’t be surprised if this post is removed. Rule 1.
---
that’s mr pebbles to you he’s a national hero
---
If you think patch notes = something is actually fixed, yeah, that seems pretty new to me. Maybe it's not as bad as it was, but it's not \*fixed\*.
---
I know for a fact that shadowed isn't there but deep pocketed I didn't know. But tbh you dont need shadowed if you run a full set of Uny. You get so much agility that it is unnecesary. I sneak perfectly with it and even if they detect me the armor can take it. If you have butressed then you will be fine.
---
Its happening to a lot of people. There has been a hundred posts about it in the past 2 weeks. They were suppose to hotfix it today(I think) buy it seemed to not work.
---
This is why we are getting more then 7 dailies each day right now. They are giving everyone extra to help.
---
you’re the problem with the monopoly community I hope you burn in hell.
---
Shhhh!
---
I agree. If you are not a team player, then turn off fill team. It's difficult to win when you're outnumbered. I'm fine with people going AFK provided they are courteous enough to turn fill team off.
---
I've also been thinking about how to expose AFKers on my team. I built a small wooden structure to trap them in, with vault boy cutouts outside pointing at the structure. I haven't had the opportunity to test this structure yet, however. Has anyone else successfully trapped AFKers this way?
---
Thanks for instructing me to preform a search. Would never had thought of doing this before posting a thread. What is this google you speak of?
---
I’ll go out on a limb and suggest the timegating. Right now, two players with the same play time over a week can receive drastically different Score depending when they can schedule their play. Not allowing completion of missed dailies later is a baffling design choice.
---
I also think the level up challenge is poorly designed. Once you hit, say, L50, you’ll take long enough to level up your main that it’s easier to create a throwaway character and level that up instead *just for the daily*. That’s a poorly thought out challenge.
---
Then there’s Nuclear Winter. Some of the challenges there have the potential to be huge effort sinks relative to their value (kill 9 creatures!) and that, and a few of the odder adventure ones, suggest a team either not familiar with their balance, or still figuring out what works. Not ideal.
---
I’m not sure if splitting off the PVP challenges from PVE and saying “complete 9 total of 18 from either mode” would work better. But probably. Dragging people from NW to Adventure and vice versa is also...a weird design choice.
---
We’ll see how the score-to-time remaining works out, too. It feels too close, to me, but a ways to go yet.
---
Mexican Bloodied (for now) level 175 answering your call for a game pal. Im on PC, you?
---
How do you one shot a sheepnach? Squache. Shaspshed. Meh.
---
Use Herd Mentality and always join a public team to get +2 back.
---
Last night at an sbq fight 4 people opened lunch boxes, i had 10% xp boost from the canned meat stew so should be 110% buff but got absolutley 0 boost for an hour untill the effects wore off. Anything over 100% seems to cancel all buffs.
---
Basically, if you make a bunch of noise.  Either by being near them and firing your gun a ton so that your dot shows up on people's compasses - or if you throw explosives in their vicinity - it'll create noise that at some point will probably attract the more seasoned players who follow battle sounds to take out whoever is making them (or in this case, near them)
---
It only happens to me when I try to exit in my camp. Then any where afterward I can't exit.
---
Rocket 100%.
---
The train car is good don't get me wrong, but the effects, 'larger' (debatable) interior of the rocket not to mention two doorways, flat roof etc gives you more to work with. Interior lighting already connected too btw.
---
20 hours
---
On Xbox.
---
Yeah. That's a better description of the bug
---
Unless they want people to be behind to make more money from people buying atoms to purchase the last levels
---
I've only bought the chest/left arm plans so far, but have been saving up bullion and all the legendary modules to buy the rest of the suit, but now...damn I really feel like running these dailies for bullion was a complete waste of time. There's nothing else I want to spend bullion on and not wasting it on the rest of the set plans if the mod plans for it aren't even in the game.
---
After having 7/9 dailies auto complete 2 days in a row I think I'm gonna bow out TBH. Not gonna log in just to grind my life away.
---
having good guns
---
also he say they basically one shot it, meaning they probably just killed it quick
---
We need to have a group objective that will force the queen to land, something like putting weights on her ankles when she lands so that she is forced to land sooner next time. Could be a craftable, "Scorch Beast Weights". 
---
Just have us do something other than sit, shoot, wait.
---
I wonder if the rewards we obtained during this will be taken away after it's fixed?
---
If a teammate dies nearby me, I try to "protect" their loot by sitting on it until they come for it. If they never come back then I claim it as my own.
---
No I know it’s fixed because I’ve played for hundreds of hours since they fixed it. Goo piles used to never despawn and the server would be screwed. Now maybe once in a while you see a naked super mutant or a headless ghoul that you can’t kill.
---
Let’s see... 
---
I have my B3325 Handmade Rifle, that’s my main “No f*cking around get shite done” weapon for my stealth bloodied build. (Named it “The Black Dragon” as a reference to FO3’s unique Chinese assault rifle. Also have the matte black finish on it.)
---
Carry around a BE .44 Revolver for those times I wanna feel like a mercenary like Kellogg. (Named it “The Jackal” as a reference to the Hellsing Jackal.)
---
A B10 10mm Pistol I named “Whisper Cannon” that I use when I wanna save 556 rounds. 
---
A Furious Swing Speed Shishkebab I named “Vengeance” that I carry around to use for Friendly Fire on quests with dumbass escort targets.
---
My Fancy Pump Shotgun for those times where I just wanna go John Wick 3 on shite and have a little fun. Mostly used in low level areas so I don’t use my 556.
---
A furious swing speed combat knife I named “Stabhappy” as a reference to the unique combat knife from Fallout 3, that’s a “All my other guns broke I’m about to die” weapon, had one main weapon break and the other ran out of ammo one time so I took this out and stabbed a scorched beast to death with it.
---
And an Unstoppable Monster, as a last resort weapon, an ace in the hole. For when you need to hit something really, REALLY hard. (Record damage with it is 13k per hit.)
---
I saw someone say that if you shoot her while she’s in the air she gets staggered and makes her stay up longer
---
Highly doubt that, I think they acknowledged somewhere that it was happening and you had until patch 21 to get them.
---
I never said that joining events and hiding in the corner is fair lol. I honestly never seen anyone hide during events but even if someone does its not effecting you in any way does it ? Someone like you joining mid event killing all legendaries by "accident" is messing progression and definitely defeats the purpose of doing the event
---
That would be cool as hell. The interior could be a big dungeon.
---
like someone else said its better to queue with a team, less enemies
---
I pay for the stash box and tent mostly but the atoms are nice too.
---
Ah sweet that sounds awesome. Time to grind for the stuff I missed lol
---
campfire tales is designed for level 20's. Get over yourself. "come back when you're stronger" doesn't mean a damn thing when everyone is 1shotting everything- endgame builds still cannibalize from each other because of this. Event etiquette is \*at the very least\* not instagibbing legendaries.
---
I imagine theyll add them. They added in the mod plans for the underarmor last patch. I went ahead and bought them so I could start rolling for the pieces I wanted. I've spent hundreds of modules and I'm still not happy with what I have. I mean I'd play with it of it was deep pocketed but it's still isnt exactly what I want. So I'll just keep rolling and playing with my current armor.
---
lunchboxes don't heal you, but healing factor reduces CHEM effects, of which stimpacks are one. Maybe lunchboxes are classified as a chem.
---
Same here. 374 and I just pretty much do my own thing.
---
Bloodied builds and/or use of glitched weapons
---
I believe the other faction is a bit salty but I think they stop after some time. My first character went with raiders. Settlers were like "I can't believe you have the nerve to show up here" and such. After a little while, I think I stopped getting that dialogue.(I would stop by for daily quests)
---
Still, I Wanted it because I have it on every piece of my current set. If it's not in-game for the SS set then screw that set. And no, I don't use buttressed.
---
Pretty useless on a stealth character, it does not proc while staggered iirc
---
You might be on to something, but I used Berry Mentats at the same time as lunchboxes so that I could get up to that 5x XP boost today. Normally you cant use 2 chems at the same time
---
Yes, explosive harpoons are now legacy
---
4. One meele, 1 main gun, 1 side arm (vampiric flamer) and 1 for fun (plama caster).
---
I am asuming this is your fist time as a lvl +50. I would recomend you pick a build and go toward that. There is a youtuber called Angry Turtle and he has a bunch if videos on some of the strongest builds out there. I dont use his builds but I learned from them to make my own.
---
Also, regarding the raid on vault 79. I strongly recomend you pick the dick move and keep all of the gold. Dont share it. They will get pissed but just a lil bit. Gold is slow to get and sharing makes it worse.
---
Finally, when you get that done choose wisely how to spend that gold. I went for the SS armor cuz I have decent weapons but its up to you and the build you picked. 
---
Welcome to the endgame! Congrats.
---
3 Handmades &amp; Fixers
---
If your on PS4 I'll give you the helmet. I know the grind all to well. I still do for the scrip so I have a crap ton of tokens.
---
35
---
Turning 47 in a month
---
Lol, its not quite direct enough I agree. I just hope I don't get banned from the sub. But I'll blame bethesda for that as well..
---
At almost lvl 400 my build is pretty much settled and there are only a handful of items that would benefit it beyond current point
---
I kinda want an updated flatwoods monster
---
The servers would explode if they had destructible structures.
---
if on PC, I just picked up a sweet 50cal I can give you. look for nmart.
---
I am a level 400 and logging back in now
---
I urge you to reconsider "screwing" that set. It has the highest recistance of all armor sets and you can keep rolling it until you get the legendary effects you want. Also, butressed is the best material mid available, 100% worth it... it majes the armor even better.
---
I'm not going to bother with any of it until it's actually in the game. If they haven't added them yet after months I'm not going to be holding my breath for them.
---
The alien should be coming soon the fish is in I think the spring season next year I believe?
---
No. The speed demon mutation puts you at the maximum possible speed bonus.
---

---
the server cant handle register half my hits imagine register your actual position with a verteibird with out crashing lol
---
The armor was the only thing I wanted so I might as well roll for it while I'm waiting. Like I said they just added the mods for the underarmor in Patch 20.
---
It's a world drop. You need to pick up 180 other world items and server hop for it to respawn IIRC.
---
I don’t hate the design, I think it was odd that it wasn’t more obvious it’s a Zetan, I would’ve made it a standard Zetan in some form of stealth gear (that matches the Appalachia lore) as opposed to a deformed Zetan in a weirdly designed life support harness.
---
Yeah I was playing a game that you could fight a certain boss once a week for something that has a drop rate of less than 1%...so this doesn't seem so bad haha.
---
Simply: NO
---
I know, but shouldn't it either not be nukeable or have the resort already destroyed from the beginning with only the bunker remaining? I know the players love the area, but it doesn't make sense to be able to nuke it.
---
I haven't crashed in months.
---
Sure? Thought PVP is enabled nevertheless of pacifist at that event
---
I'd think you'd have to still log some serious hours! But yeah I can see people max it out to get there. Normally I just have the rested and meat stew, I grab groups as I can.
---
It happened to me once. It fixed itself after I waited for a few minutes and hasnt happened since.
---
If I knew it was double xp weekend, I probably would've held off on the last two challenges for the ghillie suit lol
---
It was probably on the roof
---
Gauss pistol works for me. Haven’t tried rifle
---
Depends on chems. Rad away, rad x, stim packs are all chems too, you can use them simultaneously
---
Lmao, smh.
---
Yeah, I do that when fighting low level enemies, but not high levels. You otherwise can’t make a build
---
Oh yeah, that's a good point. It probably has something to do with that then
---
Thats interesting, I was fast traveling quite a bit so it might be this
---
I kick people to make room for a personal friend. You can just join a new one.
---
I really don't care about how good it is, I was going for finally having a good looking complete matching set that I don't have to hide under clothing. Since the mods for it aren't available, screw it. Not wasting time/resources on it until everything I want for it is available.
---
1. Ammo maker
---
2. SS or T65 depending on build
---
3. Guns depending on build
---
In my opinion the ammo maker is amazing specially if you make 5mm cuz that is the one it does the fastest.
---
Happens often. People are weird. I've seen a couple of people on here, one in particular, declaring they kick people if they don't share a fucking card they like. God knows what else ridiculous reasons people are willing to do it for. I've been kicked a few times after an hour or so with x4 bond in a building team. 
---
Go figure. I tend to just solo in my own team now. People always join at some point.
---
Yup and it's super fun not playing the game and watching your team mate in a ghillie suit hide a bush the whole time. Good times, good times. I guess you could use that time to browse reddit.. and calm down from getting killed in 2 shots. I don't think I have the temperament for NW.
---
I am also currently watching the show
---
I doubt they will add those mods but hey, its your call. Good luck out there.
---
&gt; and are all about the $$$
---
Wait, they aren't doing this for free? I thought I was donating to a kickstarter this whole time.
---
Elaine: "oh hi, your door was open"
---
Joe: "Yes, i like to encourage intruders"
---
You could probably pick up the plans at Whitesprings, maybe server hop a few times. If I have the plans, I could probably craft you one if you're on ps4
---
I asked this elsewhere...
---
I'm on Xbox, but thank you for the offer I appreciate it.
---
Idk why I didn't think about that lol yeah I just haven't been using the system much just wasn't sure if people were having problems staying in teams because people dont like randoms
---
There are multiple ways you can have "empty" servers.  First if you're just logging in it could be empty because all of the older servers have filled up and you're one of the first to populate a new one.  Second if you've been on a server for a long time then older servers may have started to empty out meaning as yours empties as well new people are being redirected there while you're just bleeding players.
---
Yeah maybe for the new players. But it does absolutely nothing for veteran players that have slogged through the grind in its present form and maxed their rep. Maybe if they added more reputation ranks or have added more features to them besides simply unlocking new plans, but right now I can't see any reason for it but to make the game easier for new and casual players.
---
I'd argue that high level players that have already maxed their rep or are close to it are the players that need another way to get rid of their excessive legendaries the most, not new players and causals that already struggle hitting the 150 scrip cap. 
---
This also leads back into what I was saying about the feature being doomed to become obsolete. If the devs add another way for players to get rid of garbage legendaries then why would they design it so it becomes completely useless to a player eventually instead of making something that players will continue to use for the rest of the games life? It's best to keep in mind that even if the players with max rep now are in the minority that won't always be the case.
---
if you did the enclave quest and payed attention to the resort robots they say they are busy re-forming all the place and, modus says they needed to destroy some parts for hygiene purpose(just point out). but I agree when nuking a place they should be actually destroyed like fallout 3 on the first town if you activate the bomb you gain and apartment and a lot of caps but the megatown will be in pices and the vendor turned in a ghoul.
---
Thank you!
---
I've won in almost the exact same way. Waited in bushes, down to 5 players, Scorchbeast kills all but one. Only difference is last guy ran out to where the circle was gonna be and I hit him with one explosive arrow. So 1 shot, 1 win for me.
---
&gt;  forcing players to have to spend atoms to complete the board
---
Can confirm Todd has already told me he will shoot all my loved ones if I do not buy BP levels.
---
Junkie works best with vanguard imo.
---
LOL
---
Well if/when they finally get around to adding them in that's when I'll start on it again. Not wasting resources on something that may never happen.
---
Or if all else fails, you could do the powering up the power plant things. Fusion generator is one of the guaranteed generator plans you get as rewards. You may have to do it more than once.
---
Yea I went to 4 vendors with 0 caps. Ugh.
---
But I’ve seen some camp build areas that are massive.
---
Grafton at Charleston station spawn is 15-25 caps w acid and oil two wacks run back towards station hop repeat. Its a random spawn spot ie mutants trader pied piper ect. So you can add a few off 4 very easy mutants if you want to waste your time. 1000 an hour is  easy just looking to mix it up with an activity equally as lucrative. Mutants are way too random with cap drops. Wasnt sure if there was a new spawn im not aware of as things have changed since i stopped playing before wastelanders. Searches turned up threads like this.
---
Don't take any of this "the game is empty! the game is dying!" bullshit seriously.  Even odds it's just people stirring shit, especially with all of the recently banned salty twits looking for some sort of pathetic revenge for how worse off the game is now that them and their friends aren't around.
---
i've been yelling at the sun, but it doesn't help
---
They literally are working on it right now...
---
Do the event powering up Poseidon three times and you’ll get the plan.
---
I only have 4 charisma on my main character so I cant share much lol I go with philanthropist usually. Yeah I'm just going to star using my own and let people pop in.
---
YES! THIS!!!
---
My camp is near one
---
Damn, maybe I need to learn how to xp better...where you finding these xp blessing mutants?
---
Squanch
---
I joined Uranium Fever tonight on a relatively vacant server...there was one other guy with me. Someone I didn’t know. I’m L54- he was well into three digits. Because there were on,y two of us, we had a few moments of scrambles to kill everything off, but was overall manageable with just us. There were three legendary miners- I happened to check around the corner when he was killing the first, so I got a few shots in. The next spawned inside my room, and I killed it like I had everything else up to that point (there was another in the room at that point too), and the third spawned in a spot easily visually accessible to both, so we both got it. 
---
He gave me a thumbs down for the one I got, but I had no idea I’d be expected to ‘save’ it when we were scrambling at the best of times. I was genuinely stumped as to why he was upset until my husband told me afterwards that I should have saved it, but that didn’t dawn on me just because there were only two of us. 
---
Genuinely feeling conflicted- bad because of course I hate when situations like what happened above are irritating to my core, but also not so bad because he still got 2 of the 3, and I would have gladly passed him the 1* revolver I received from the one he missed. 
---
🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Sucks, but I didn’t know I was expected to put myself in danger when all I heard were shots from the other room (as in he was busy anyway), and I hadn’t actively planned on him missing out...I’ll certainly know better for next time. 
---
And if you’re this guy- my apologies. I’ll do better next time 🤗
---
I doubt you'll get one as we all run the Power Station event, get the plan, learn it, and never go there again. Good luck though. Running that quest is not hard, may take a few times to get the plan.
---
To answer your question. No you can’t. When you play online you either get a team that hides in a bush all game. Or actually tries to play normal. 
---
If you don’t want to take the chance of having a bush team, then turn “find a team” option at the beginning so you can play solo.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
I have the 150 for the suit finally but I'm just going to keep saving for the head but it's a long road
---
Event: Powering up Poseidon
---
Certain areas make it look larger, but in reality it it not.
---
Some parts of games become obsolete and if something was created to make newer players have fun and make the game easier for them that's good sure it will be obsolete but it will make it easier for players who don't have good guns or perks making them go on constant grinds to get this just to do another after that
---
Press X on a item you want to drop.
---
Instigating or junkies build
---
Insigating if you're running solo
---
Junkies if you're in a team 
---
Nothing else besides a VATS crit build (which works for all builds really) really comes close to a '2nd tier' meta build
---
Clearly the resort area is made of the same material as the Vaults. Just steel and concrete, very pretty steel and concrete, that looks like wood.
---
I guess I missed that part, it makes sense but yeah like it was mentioned above it would be too troublesome if the buildings got destroyed while nuking, but it would be cool to see it
---
No problem. Feel free to ask me or the community anything, we are here to help each other.
---
And I also wonder if I hadn’t come around their corner when I did to see him killing that first one, if he’d actually planned on the same- was he holding it? Or did the timing just work out?
---
What about the monongah plant? My camp is near it
---
This is something new to me. Are they as consistent as the grafton. Its there every single time and close. Its all about caps per hour lol.
---
Of course
---
Scary thing is level 50 is really only about 30% through the season in terms of SCORE needed
---
 May I ask, how much time do I have before Patch 21 comes or I lose the items ?
---
Jean
---
Best way. You don't get random power trippers or people who want to make room for friends or whatever else then. Even a team of yourself is better than solo, and it's never solo for long honestly.
---
Same here. Guess I won't be able to get the quantum lamp.
---
Or under the ground, if you build on overlapping ground textures, sometimes things clip under, a really easy way to build a true nuclear bunker. Put down some stairs going down into the ground, an instrument to help yo clip through and build off of that and the rest of your base is safe from creatures and nukes
---
No. We really shouldn’t be allowed to.
---
Yes the guy OP is talking about was an absolute dick face.
---
But actually going after the guy and sending him messages or whatever would only make you worse of a person than them.
---
At the end of the day it’s only a video game and no one deserves hate for playing a game like a dick.
---
I see.
---
Alright guess that explains the damage part.   
---
I guess  I will test if it is shotty level broken tomorrow.
---
Honestly bethesda should just implement world loot everyone gets rewarded the loot (it will probably cause some lazy gameplay) but it's better than a high level just destroying a legendary not even a sec to be alive and nobody gets rewarded but that one guy like that mole miner event. Id say 90% of the time people have some common etiquette when it comes to killing the legendary mole miners
---
Yeah its not as efficient as the caps are real random off mutants.
---
Has anyone done the math to show when the earliest complete can be done? Assuming all weekly/dailies and excluding/including NW?
---
rank 5 \*currently\* takes an obscene amount of spare perk cards to unlock.
---
I’m not sure what It’s used for ingame universe, but it’s not a napalm launcher so not a weapon for sure.
---
The heavy incinerator from Fo3 and FNV on the other hand is purpose built weapon.
---
Early August sometime.
---
you can use a flamethrower trap to break the item and repair it
---
I do have one question, when I use a plan am I locked in at only being able to build at the level I unlocked it at and lower? Because I unlocked a decent amount of high powered plans while I was around level 30. Also, what’s the best way to get caps? That’s all
---
That's crazy nice of you man! Unfortunately I'm on Xbox but I really appreciate it
---
I'm pretty sure that if you did everything you wouldn't hit the mark. You'd need to do the repeatable challenge 120 times to get enough SCORE to complete on time
---
But now with extra dailies, and the double SCORE weekand who knows
---
IF A PERSON LEAVES THE GROUP ITS SAYS THAT THEY WHERE KICKED....BLAME BETHESDA FOR BEEN LAZY
---
That kind of stuff happens, and it shouldn't be a big deal. I would not give a player who was a lot lower level than me a hard time about something like that. I think what irritated me was the fact that it should have been obvious that I was trying to gift my crappy sword to the new person, and this guy like naruto RUNS over half the farm to steal it 😒
---
2 times only and some days  not at all.
---
Alright, thanks for the advice
---
Lock it
---
Yep
---
Double score weekend? I saw double xp but not score, unless it’s not this weekend
---
I kicked someone who was afk just sitting in their camp. But normally we only kick off we’re making room for a friend or if they’re being rude (1-shorting Legendaries at public events etc)
---
So you did see it today tho?
---
This is also why the Double perk is much less useful on the Gat Laser and Plasma. It doubles the first core, but then every subsequent core after that will only have 336 shots (on the gatling plasma; unsure about the Laser) no matter what. Which means it's literally *worse* than regular gat plasmas in terms of ammo
---
You make me sad
---
I have
---
yes.
---
I have and it was bugged for us. All enemies in a wave would spawn on top of the transmitter. Was weird.
---
is the team aware there are MULTIPLE fast travel bugs that need to be addressed?  Having to repeatedly select the same location is an annoying one but there's also the bug that's been around ever since the countdown system was introduced to allow fast traveling with enemies nearby, where the countdown will just terminate instantly and you either have to run further away from or kill all of the nearby enemies anyway.
---
My rule is to never engage, it's not exciting, but I'm almost always in the top 10 and probably like 70% of the time in the top 5 players.
---
I really wish you could see stats in the game.
---
Awesome thank you so much
---
The reason the Scorch Beast Queen is never actually killed is because the nukes we think we set of are only Vault Tek holograms, to give the impression that we are cleansing Appalachia.
---
So Whitespring is never really nuked, the glowing ghouls are held in underground storage pens and are let out when we 'drop a nuke'.
---
The whole thing is a giant mind game to truly find those that can survive the repetition... The Best and Brightest.
---
Ty very much- we have just been unlucky
---
I apologize
---
It's something later down the road
---
Unarmed scorch hit hard.
---
Double score is next weekend
---
Maybe it’s a dumb question, but does the Zorbo ship actually represent anything? If we fall behind the ship can we not hit rank 100?
---
Y'know, that explains why I suddenly had 15 full-charged cores in my inventory after crafting Ultracite Gats to learn mods
---
Rank 43 and honestly don't GAF about progressing any faster. I'm beyond burnt out on this game because of the legendary run. Double xp or not.
---
For me pressing E fast rather than clicking works wonders
---
I noticed it too. Radiation rumble started and no one joined. I waited till the last second to start the event and no one joined. I looked at the map and the server was full of people under lvl 50 so i started it on my own for the xp. Left the server, no point in hanging around if no one was going to help do endgame events.
---
edit: Pc btw
---
Absolutely- I was surprised because it doesn’t seem like a 1-person event (I’ve done it many times, but most are with about a dozen others- this was a first). 
---
I’ve kept a few key pieces that I look forward to passing along to deserving lower level players at some point, and always try to have a few things in my vendors they can use at about half of the cap value, too. 
---
Makes you wonder how some people sleep at night.
---
At least one of mat characters has a few extra. Give me a few min and I'll make sure
---
That will work as well, the Poseidon one is a little easier.
---
Know why you don't see threads about faction rep any more?  Because even the whiniest of people realized it's not  that difficult of a grind and that after they were done with it they didn't  give a shit any more.
---
Yeah that happens when people put their tents by the entrance
---
It's stuff like this that makes me sad they took away demolishing people's bases.
---
It starts next weekend on the 23rd also for context here's the roadmap:   
---

---
Its due to people placing their tents out on the road, intentionally, to cause all the scorched to spawn there, you can earn mad XP for each group that spawns and they spawn in every 12 seconds or so.
---
Try the vendor bot in harbors ferry or Phoenix in watoga. They sell mod planes.
---
I cam probably craft one for you too
---
Was wondering if I'm solo in a public team can I still use lone wanderer until someone joins or does it take the bonuses as soon as you make the team?
---
Kinda thinking that he was not planning on waiting. I don't understand why some high leveled players find the need to get every single chance at legendaries. From my experience, I've essentially gotten to the point where I always hit the daily scrip limit. If I wanted, I could farm legendaries(a legendary every few minutes, mostly loading time though). If there's a lot of people, then yeah, hold off so plenty of people can get a shot in. In your case, it's not your fault so don't worry about it.
---
Mounts have already been data mined, believe they're currently on the pts build and from the atom shop.
---
You could say you gave them a taste of the Circus if Values!
---
Oh yeah I totally expect people to kick players for just 1 shotting everything and not letting people get loot and xp
---
I prefer the 76 raiders they feel like actual people
---
Double Score Weekend only really adds 3 days extra worth of points. Not really a whole lot. I’m getting more out of double XP and the repeatable right now than I will from the double dailies. Plus I’m going on vacation for a week in a few weeks for a week so I’m trying to keep myself ahead because I never know when I will be hit with the autocomplete bug again...
---
Honestly I haven't checked, but my feeling would be it wouldn't work as it SHOULD be the same as the old private teams.  I use inspirational for the extra XP since I dropped Tenderizer.
---
Sharing Bodyguards would give everyone on the team +36 DR. This is pretty much nothing for a player with set of fully modded high end armor (like SSA, Heavy Combat or Marine). Even an extra 150 DR wouldn't have that much of an effect given the highly diminishing returns adding more DR gives. I wouldn't recommend anyone use perks that increase DR, even for themselves.
---
Edit: also forgot to mention Bodyguards only effects the player that has it equipped (unless shared), not their team.
---
You should have blocker and/or serendipity perks on bro.
---
I made a spreadsheet to calculate where you should be by each day If you want to make sure to make enough daily to finish the pass by day 70. By it’s calculation we should be at level 44 by the end of Monday to be on track.
---
Just go and check on the public team list, you'll get the rough idea of the size of players on the game server.
---
I'm on PC as well sorry I forgot to include that
---
But how else are they going to get us to spend atoms? (Sarcasm)
---
Many people are bloodied and rad sponge is a little more than an inconvenience. Some people even do it intentionally. If someone joins me using it or sharing it I do kick them. Excuse us for not wanting our build ruined.
---
Ya, my response above was lame. I think the fact you can be allies with both is bad game design. I do actually like the Crater characters,  way more than Foundation.
---
When did this start? I only realized today that I wasn't getting atoms for challenges. I also wanted that lamp.
---
They’re working on a lot of things since BETA too...
---
Agree, maybe replace the circle in our markers with a star or something, that would indicate its yours while team members stay the same, Id prefer this mainly cause I like the colours as they are and green would be so weird after all this time... whatever they do anything is appreciated
---
Yeah when I've joined the teams I've used that and then philanthropist or the perk that makes you heal nearby teammates but I'm always worried of using that with bloodied builds near because they need low hp constantly
---
Lol, are you under the influence of Nukashine?
---
Lmao
---
Never said there weren't legitimate reasons, and I was specifically referring to idiotic ones I'd seen, as well as getting kicked after a significant period of time, not instantly. 
---
Also rad sponge is not really that big of an inconvenience, especially considering most people just do their own thing and only join teams for the passive benefits. It only works in close proximity. Can be a minor inconvenience if you turn up to the same event or whatever, but still. It's not the end of the world when toxic goo exists. 
---
I am bloodied and I have quite happily stayed in teams with people using it, I've also allowed people to stay when I am leader. 
---
As far as reasons go it's perfectly fine, as are ridiculous ones really as there's nothing you can do about it. But that doesn't mean you can't ridicule them.
---
It's about the same on PS4
---
🖐🌈’magic’🌈🖐
---
Power user? My gf and I both use Ultracite gatling lasers. It works with lasers, we both get 999 rounds with it normally. That would be terrible :p think we were experiencing bug well before she picked it up (and shares it). 
---
Tbh, I think it’s speed demon serum. I experience so many bugs with that mutation. For example, 50% of the time I will get the reload speed increase, the other 50% of the time I won’t. Same with gf. Also applies to the MS boost, sometimes I’m fast af boi and sometimes I’m not. Sometimes I’ll get an insanely fast reload and other times it’ll feel like a million pound fusion core.
---
*cough* ward
---
But I guess the reason you can be allies with both is you don't attack foundation so they are cool with you and if a raider kills someone that is allied with foundation and is a vault dweller from vault 76 you have the most powerful faction in Appalachia and foundation against you and the vault dwellers have access to nukes, power armor and miniguns that shoot plasma so it makes sense why they don't attack
---
ya thats a douchebag move.
---
i fixed one guys wagon who was kill hogging at an event. Basically we were doing the one were you have to play the music to lure in the ghouls and the wendigo boss. I was standing by the Jukebox waiting for the enemies to come in since im melee so other people can shoot them then when they come to me i kill them and we all get xp and loot. But nooo some mouthbreather decides hes going to 2 tap every enemy as it comes in the door and no one else it allowed loot or xp. so i put my weapon away and stood on the other side of the room so i wouldnt draw aggro. the next thing to happen was a legendary and a few adds came in and bumrushed him and murdered him in the corner then i went over killed them. then the wendigo came and he was still dead when it spawned so i killed it quick before he could get loot from it. He got what he deserved. Nothing lol.
---
It’s not just Whitespring. Nothing gets destroyed besides player CAMPs if you drop a nuke anywhere. You can nuke NPC’s and they just magically put on hazmat suits and don’t die in the blast. 
---
The entire nuke mechanic is my biggest pet peeve with the game. They made them so utterly trivial, just doesn’t make any sense at all. The Overseer says nuking is bad. The army guy is supposedly pissed about nukes. But there are zero consequences for dropping them.
---
I disagree. To me it’s a lazy mechanic used to replace actual content that needs to be added.
---
I've been wondering the same thing. I've been kicked from build teams several times and I have no idea why. I think many people don't realize that build teams are best suited for solo play with group benefits.
---
I once accidentally kicked a person when I was trying to fast travel to their location. The buttons are close to each other and there is no confirmation button.
---
I once kicked a guy who was sharing Sun Kissed and didn't stop when I asked him to; I was using my bloodied build.
---
The last person I kicked was a known AFKer in Nuclear Winter who isn't courteous enough to turn fill team off.
---
Healing perk is fine as long as it's not also coupled with rad sponge. I use healing factor as bloodied. 
---
I also don't really mind people using either, as it's only a minor inconvenience at best usually, and only relevant at events or whatever as most the time public teams aren't together, and toxic goo is a thing, especially when I'm at west tek a hundred times a day anyway farming XP :D
---
I assumed that's what you were referring to, since I've seen that particular complaint a lot from bloodied players. So yea fair enough, my bad. That's about all I would kick someone for besides just afking.
---
2 dozen skins and some extra items are not content. Please don’t refer to it that way
---
with OP guns it is so hard to just tag some enemies (happened to me a couple of times and as a result i just had to giveaway some scripscrap) but he must be a dickhead to loot this bag if it is meant to another player. Shame on him. 
---
Anyway It would be good for every player to leave 1\* shit to low lvl players. No matter what is into the bag that can make them happy. I remember how happy i was actually :)
---
Started a couple weeks ago with the legendary run. Now you get score instead of atoms
---
i never heard of a hotfix for today to solve this issue, maybe youre thinking about the hotfix we got tuesday that added some logging to help them find the cause of it?
---
Entirely understandable. Like I said, doesn't matter even if the reason is stupid, there's nothing you can do about it and teams aren't in a shortage so it's usually all good, just baffling when you've built up a bond over time but hey, it's only a game right :D
---
I'd like to see an armor frame, to complement the power armor frame. Why should a full suit of power armor weigh less than a full suit of unpowered armor just because it's on a frame?
---
A frame you can equip with whatever armor you want and equip with 1 click would also give us some lateral gear progression with the ability to use encryptid, sbq, project paradise gear sets in a practical manner.
---
It does that but at a certain point you are supposed to be forced to fight.
---
Guy says he was unbanned with everything intact in the end. Dummy.
---
I tried posting about this and everyone on this downvoted saying there is no problem
---
I don’t think the Mirelurk Queen claw has ever unlocked either
---
No it was delayed
---
Oh okay cool I was just always worried about negating people's buffs and stuff
---
Level 41
---
I would look for sentinels over vanguards with the SS armor.  The DR is already so high, I find that the damage reduction is more helpful.
---
Do all the weeklys and dailys. Then grind xp. Those are the only ways
---
as on xbox
---
Explain infinite harpoons.
---
I’ve seen stuff like this. Very selfish of people to do that. I enjoy helping low level players, no reason to be greedy at a high level. Especially with a 1*. I don’t like pvp but that would tempt me. Good on you for making the armor for the lower level. Shows we have decent people in the game.
---
Well can you nuke an area and have a chance for it to spawn
---
Yeah Idk why people dont turn fill off to bush camp I'm a level 50NW bush camper and I started doing that almost immediately after the first team yelled at me for hiding lol
---
This game has far too many issues with accessibility.  I have made so many practical and laid out solutions, but they just don't seem to care.  And sadly the fandom doesn't either, heck, the post i made asking them to stop using the slur crippled got downvoted out of existance.
---
Can you share your build?
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
That's not the quest though. The quest was delayed.
---
Some people will definitely get the arse about minor stuff like that. I guess I'm just too easy going by the look of it :D
---
Im using the reload bug instead of watching the charges left to separate low power fusion cores and make ultracite ones out of them. Why waste a fully charged core when you can use an empty one? :D
---
Could have been this
---
https://amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hm6ndy/psa_having_more_than_four_lunchboxes_active_at_a/
---
I know
---
level 32
---
You got the discord
---
Yeah there are alot of uptight jerks but as an almost 30 year old gamer I've dealt with it all lol This community is super amazing even with the occasional ass hat
---
Software developer?
---
Me too lol yay
---
Pro tip halloween candy from the monster mash event in watoga counts as prewar food and weighs nearly nothing.
---
45, play a couple hours a day most days.
---
Then I'm not sure why you said it? The quest has been delayed. It was in an ITV and in the updated road map.
---
I think this goes for randoms too, everytime someone dies after scorched earth I sit on top of their bag until they come to get it back so no one can take it, their heart emoji after getting their flux is worth more than the junk I could have stolen
---
You're right about it being a plan. It is sold by vendors in the Savage Divide, Mire, and Cranberry Bog.
---
Auto RR is so much fun once you figure out ammo weight management.
---
I'm not getting atoms for completing challenges that are supposed to give atoms. Like craft x amount of times, etc, not the dailies.
---
I kicked someone who was sharing some useless ass perk card.
---
I usually launch a nuke in whites springs in my private server for farm fluxs and kegendary, in 2 hours you get about 150 fluxs and lot legendarys
---
Can you give any other examples other than SWTOR or ESO? The overwhelming majority of MMOs have main quest line voice acting and written lines for everything minor.
---
Go do Becketts quest line to the end. As a heavy, you'll be happy
---
48
---
Me too, I get lost in west tek sometimes too, so usually I do WT outside and Harpers ferry, then hit Burrows til I am lost and ft out lol
---
Harpoon gun +flechett mod
---
With the flachette mod when you shoot enemies you can pick up harpoons (sometimes more than you shoot) from the corpses thus this makes it infinite ammo
---
Rank 43.
---
[wiki ](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wendigo#Wendigo_colossus) says   
---
"The wendigo colossus has a 1 in 15 chance to spawn when nuking any assault-type random encounter."
---
There are guides on the sub by a guy past 75 already. The search function will likely find it.
---
Ok, but I've seen people killing them in random nuke zones
---
I was going to do this but ended up finishing before double xp was activated . Can’t be wasting all that precious double xp time on trash ass nuclear winter
---
Is it possible you went hungry/thirsty just before? And possibly lost the health bonus from rejuvenated? If you even use it.
---
That's how I die a lot........as soon as I'm not well fed I go to 1hp until I eat/drink.
---
It's true, sometimes things in games do become obsolete as time goes on or as they get phased out by new features. But designing a feature that is absolutely doomed from the start is a waste of time. The game is already easy enough and there hasn't been so much added to the game that new players need any sort of boost so they can try to catch up to the veteran players. It doesn't even take a high level player with end game gear to be able to easily complete the faction dailies or farm encounter spawns for rep.
---
I mean seriously, the whole reputation grind was only added a few months back. I really don't think that there's any reason to make it easier, unless they were also going to expand on it. While I understand a good deal of the player base is casual, that doesn't mean there shouldn't be things that you actually have to work or grind for.
---
Just finished one.
---
Yes. But as I said that is not the quest. You said you understood that I don't think you do.
---
You can spawn the colossus but the event "the colossal problem" is not in game yet. It was delayed.
---
Mine glitches out and didn’t give it to me but gave me my head piece when I bought that 🙄🙄
---
For making room for a friend, for not sharing a perk, for using *Rad Sponge* perk or for just being an general asshole.
---
I'm around level 350, and same. I was at 20,000 caps, and I'd had my vendors shut down for weeks. Tonight I opened them up again and then saw someone come by and buy like 15,000 caps worth of ammo in one visit. I rushed back to my CAMP and shut down my vendors again and am unlikely to turn them back on for another week or so.
---
damn really? thank you my dude
---
lmao
---
I think if you're in a team, you can tag and everyone in the team gets their loot. Care to experiment?
---
Yup 5.5 levels to go until 100 so ready to be done with nw
---
Oooh. My bad. No idea when it stopped working :\
---
I wish. That would actually be of some use
---
dont know if posted already but [angry turtle made a video how to force scorchbeasts to land](https://youtu.be/arkeekNX2TA)
---
39
---
If there are enough people to control spawns it’s better to kill the ghouls and drop in the ore earlier just don’t hit 100 until the end, because you can get TONS of XP at this event.
---
It would have to only apply to legendaries, though. Most of the time, I don’t want most of the drops from enemies I kill (such as glowing meat since I’m a herbivore).
---
Im not sure if that bug works tho. Me and a friend tried int a few times but never worked.
---
Any errors of any kind? Did you change anything with your bethesda account/email?
---
More dilly less dally.
---
Are you asking the question or giving the answer here? 🤷‍♂️  
---
If you're so certain, why the hell are you asking?  
---
And if you don't know, why win't you accept people's answers? 🤦‍♂️
---
At this point, one more weekly also would be nice.
---
I believe it is in the game now
---
...since 8 hours ;)
---
Honestly, I’d like a settings option to not see teammate’s markers. Most of the time, you’re only with them for an event, and perhaps not even then, so you don’t care where they are trying to go.
---
Just about caught up to the green spaceship.
---
Are you getting the "Vault-Tec Engineers..." message?
---
Unfortunately two-shot was changed a long while back to only add 25% damage. It also has a vats accuracy penalty which puts off many players. It's still good... But not like it once was.
---
And if not world drop at the very least event enemies would make alot of sense
---
Nuke zone = random chance for wendigo collapses to spawn. 
---
Cossosal Problem = separate in-game quest that’s been delayed.
---
Have they reduced the frequency of events overall? Seems like it..
---
49
---
Got the green spaceship today. But I play a lot. However Line in the sand (with a well placed tent) with double xp is helping.
---
Actually the math was incorrect because you need only 2 minutes in a bush instead of 3 for getting the same experience as downing \*and\* killing a player 😂  
---
Now the numbers are correct. Still anyone can disagree from the conclusions drawn from the data.  
---
Still unless you're really good at this mode you can reach the best ranks by sitting in a bush. Especially if the game suffer serious FPS drops even in the lowest settings. This makes it really difficult playing any kind of real-time competitive games.
---
46 currently.
---
When I started the game, I had a phobia of bugs, but not anymore lol. I just got used to it
---
Pacifist mode, it exists for that reason. turning it on keeps you from being able to fight back and keeps you from triggering PVP in most cases
---
Did I say came fire tales im clearly talking about events designed for 50 up
---
Grafton ststion vendor normally has the plans
---
Thanks gamer.
---
Just read it on the sub, didn’t think much of it. And my friend got an email saying his account would be unsuspended in a few days
---
There’s not such thing as “event etiquette” tell them to design them better not my fault your build can’t keep up
---
No.  You will get atoms from completing the pass as well as playing the game. If you are in the 85 to 90 range at the end you should be able to buy out the rest of the pass with your stash of atoms.
---
I didn’t even know that was an option. Is there a way I can turn it on?
---
The Legendary Grind is a turd wrapped in a pretty package. Instead of doing challenges for Atoms to spend as we wish, we have this system that only MMO grind lunatics love. Everybody's favorite new consumable is the LUNCHBOX!!! It's an item used to mitigate the pain caused by the the very system handing it out as a reward. It's sick.
---
Purveyor is completely random. Waiting or not, there's nothing to weigh your chances to get what you want. My advice would to look into player trading to get what you want
---
I got my build team bond up just as I was finishing the silo by myself... and just before I complete it they boot me. So I bombed their two camps. Now no one gets a bond bonus.
---
My guass minigun can fry that sucker (non-magic / bloodied, just anti-armor).
---
It’s in the settings, you get a message pop up when you hit level 5
---
My camp use to fracture every time I logged in. The only thing that fixed it was to move my camp and rebuild. And even then some things still would come apart. 
---
The fix I found is that I had to SLOWLY build my structure from the ground up, placing foundations, walls, and roofs one at a time, and backing out to inspect them to make sure they were snapping in the correct place. Logging out every once in a while to make sure they didn't load in fractured from everything else. 
---
Even then, wall or foundations occasionally split apart or would overlap. There isn't much you can do beyond being super meticulous
---
If a player is at Max caps they will happily buy gag items because they can share the wealth and not get burdened with weight for things they'd then have to offload. When I'm at Max I try svd find low levels to buy things from but often I'm waiting for scrip to reset so I only buy things that are light it can be scrapped
---
If you have whitespring bunker access (or someone you know) you can buy the plans for a few hundred caps from a MODUS terminal. Or do a few power up event.
---
You mention the entire problem right at the start of your comment. The reputation system is shallow. At the present time the only reason to grind rep is for access to some new plans, the majority of which are not particularly exciting, and nearly all the best ones loaded on to the Raider side. 
---
I won't argue that the grind is tedious, but speeding it up in my opinion would be just a little like a car accelerating and weaving around other cars as fast as they can just to get stopped at a red light with the same cars they were passing; sure you may have gotten there faster but does it matter when your stuck in the same place with everyone else going nowhere?
---
They really need to add more features to the ranks and add some additional ranks for those that slogged through the original grind. This way having additional ways to grind rep wouldn't be pointless content for people that have already maxed their rep and it would give players even more of a reason to increase their Faction ranks. With new benefits, additional ranks, and more ways to grind rep I feel like the grind could be made into something positive instead of a boring and negative experience.
---
It doesn’t show up for me in settings. I’m playing on Xbox One :/
---
Go into settings and gameplay. Should be near the top and just flick it on. Nobody can directly cause damage to you and neither can you cause damage to others.
---
I also learned this also means you can't attack wanted players for the cap reward or achievements..... But it's easy to turn on and off as you wish.
---
Just hit 40; was at 30 this morning.
---
3. My main rifle, a pistol for tagging legendaries, and a melee weapon for low level enemies not worth bullets.
---
it is under the settings section, i think it is in gameplay settings. 
---
it does NOT protect you from Workshop PVP, avoid workshops as much as possible to avoid issues. if you have to take one for a challenge/unlocking plans abandon it when done unless you are on a private server (fallout 1st only)
---
Keep a decent Vampire weapon with you. I have a VE handmade. It's like god mode.
---
Lucky you lol. I'm a rank 52.. I'll get there eventually though
---
It would be nice, if we could  get those points by just playing (similarly to Outlaw Pass in RDO). I could barely progress with my quests since this started, because all my time goes to running around to be able to do challenges.
---
I did a ton of grinding over the last double an deven more over the triple lol. My wife got kinda pissed haha. But I was just carrying a new born around moving from Bush to Bush lol
---
Today's Jul 16th Inside the Vault:
---
"As part of a hotfix we released a few days ago, we implemented some logging to help us more effectively track down the root cause of the bug. We also included a fix for the issue, which we enabled yesterday after reviewing information from that logging. Our data show that this fix has addressed the vast majority of instances of this bug, and we are pursuing a more complete fix in the next few days."
---
So it looks like yesterday they "included a fix for the issue" that worked for most, but not all.
---
Would I not have better odds for a lever action now than if I were to add another gun to the pool?
---
You aren’t unique!
---
Settings =&gt; Game then bottom option
---
Or just google it
---
That is a very good weapon for a few hours of quests. 
---
The Ally quest for Beckett gives you the Last Word its AA/FFR/250DR .50 cal weapon.
---
I'm on vacation the double score weekend. Guess I should've asked Bethesda instead of my employer.
---
I have noticed that.   I was server hopping the other day looking for plans and i ended up looping around the same servers
---
They could make it so it gives rep until you max out, then it gives scrip.
---
it is up, you should see a button prompt at the bottom of the screen to "rank up" at the cost of 150 atoms each rank
---
Lol did you forget that I told you you may have to wait a month or more
---
Fuck it, make it use cannonballs seen as though it does the damage of one
---
41. I'm quite surprised that there so many older gamers here. It's a good surprised, though.
---
This is true, I ran Uranium Fever a couple of times with a public team and while I didn’t get exp I did get the loot that the legendary mole miners dropped
---
same. not a big deal but it is annoying.
---
Well done! I finished my grind for it a couple months back, felt good when I got it. Never again.
---
Till I realised I had amassed a decent amount of tokens on my alt. Sooo...the grind goes on. May as well since I'm so close!
---
I have a mule camp on a level 4 out near fallout 76, so although people may see i am only level 4, doesnlt mean its low level stuff.  Have legendary weapons and 15000 ammo at it
---
I've thought about this a bit, and had newbs bitch at me for trying to give them "useless" stimpacks they already have too many of.
---
About the only thing newbs don't get tons and tons of is radaway.  They can also use bullets but melee works well enough anyway.
---
Some scrap is useful too, leather mostly at really low level.  Ballistic fiber at mid.
---
Could you tell if it was limping? Like he shot in the leg? I typically try to cripple the legendary’s and then wave people over if it’s spawns by me
---
All good info. Thank you! It just irritates me because I've never had any issues until the "release" today.
---
If you do this please put your vendors above ground
---
Blame your pals standing on their tents...
---
Thanks, but I was only using one lunchbox at the time and I was looking at the effects page when it happened

You’ll always have all the guns in the pool except the ones that are tied to a DLC or were added. Something, like a Bear Arm or Fixer has to be learned to be dropped by the purveyor.
---
It's the Responder vendor in Grafton who usually has the BOS plans, not the one at the train station.
---
Ok thats top of my list to do then.
---
Gotcha makes sense. Thanks everyone!
---
"It just works"?? Is it? Dev team is this the normal way? This is tested right? Cool. So it works.
---
Sounfs good, thank you for the info.
---
Generally curious what the PC term is that’s acceptable to you.
---
If you ask me you sound like all you do is drink red Bull and yell at your mom for undercooking your veggies.
---
Thank you for the source, i appreciate it! Good news to hear that theyve stopped a number of instances in it completing
---
Well i didn't "scramble" to buy the ranks, but I am now done with my seasonal grind. Which means when I get on, my playtime can be spent doing what I want at my leisure instead of only gridning out daily challenges. 
---
I don't get much play time at all, now I can go back to collecting all the stuff I was working on before the season started.
---
Found it, thanks!
---
Dross Toss is bugged for me
---
Well played I say!
---
I seen!!!😀😀
---
I carry 4, a fixer and handmade so I can mix up ammo, a shishkebob for healing npcs if needed and a weight reduced shovel for completing buried with honour daily. Lately it has been more carried due to waiting on scrip to reset
---
Thank you :)
---
You are semi correct. I play with my brother almost daily. You’ve got to be within a certain distance of the ensmynto be able to loot it if your teammate does all the damage. Sometimes we get split up going to the burrows or thru WS and there have been plenty of times or I will kill stuff or vice versa and the other one won’t be able to loot it because we were a couple rooms over
---
How does this even happen? Did you do anything to deserve this? Or was someone just bring a jerk to you? I legitimately don’t understand.
---
Another thing to add is that there's a petition going on right now to unban all banned accounts. It has almost 2000 Signatures. While I agree with most of what is in the description. I feel that it could have used a different title &amp; if you duped say millions of items. You should remain perma banned. But Imagine if those 2000 people were Fallout 1st members. That's over $200,000 right there. Bethesda doesn't make alot of money off game sales as they're not releasing much in the way of new games. Live services like Fallout 1st keep the money coming. But $200,000 loss due to banning that many people? Ouch. 
---
I do feel that not as many people would have been banned if they've fixed the problem much sooner. They've known about for over a week &amp; didn't apply an emergency hotfix like they've done in the past. Instead they waited for the next tuesday.
---
So I can't help but feel that how Bethesda handled the situation is Unjust. Just banning people &amp; hope the problem will go away which it never will. From what I hear depending on your platform, there are empty servers around now. Less people in the game. Half of my friends are banned &amp; half of theirs as well. 
---
The whole system must be Automated.
---
Hahaha. Gotta love the bush wookie life. It's better to hide in a bush than actually play. Seems you earn more xp that way anyways. Plus I don't really care for pvp.. I'm just in it for the rewards to be honest.
---
Brotherhood Recon Rifle with a .50 reciever is my go sniper rifle.
---
Be a man and accept the consequences of your actions.
---
This is what locks are for.
---
Your getting this wound up over a stranger being an asshole?
---
I can only imagine how wound up you get from the Toxic lobbies of the old CoD games
---
Injured?  Your leg is injured.  You have injured the SBQ's wing.  Using a stimpak will heal an injured limb.  It's not hard to swap at all.  I'm not the kind of person to generally complain about stuff like this.  I don't complain about crazy or dumb, but crippled is kinda like calling someone the N-word or Queer as a slur where it's just so out of taste it's uncomfortable.
---
Yeah man. You'd have to kill 10 people to get the same xp as making it to the top 10.much simpler to just hide. I also hate the game mode and pvp haha. But the cosmetics are pretty great 
---
 Bush wookies for life
---
I wonder if there is a bug that kicks people from teams. On multiple occasions, I have been team leader and have seen the message "Player X has been removed from the team" as opposed to "Player X has left the team", even though I did nothing to remove them. I suspect that at least some of the times I've been "kicked" from a team, I wasn't really kicked at all.
---
In my opinion on xbox anyhow, yes in my opinion it is still a great place to farm.
---
If you’re getting this bent out of shape over being solely accused of something like this, *and* went as far as to report somebody for making an accusation, I think you need to take a step back and think about who the real toxic one is.
---
Thanks, I’ll have a look at how I get one.
---
Thanks for the speedy response, my gamertag is SwifTBuddY hmu if u tryna play sometime
---
Angry Turtle on YouTube has tested VATS criticals for us: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jagOtAvr9DU&amp;t=738s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jagOtAvr9DU&amp;t=738s).  Because of the way criticals work, it looks like the damage boost from severe receiver is tiny and hardened is the better option.
---
And still can't produce it in may ammo mashine...
---
You can do davanports and sell them to one of the two factions. You can also turn in mirelurk meat (Queen is best) to black eye at ohio River adventure for some raider rep
---
There can be a bug where of you select a player trying to fast travel instead of the default fast travel it comes auto selects kick from team. So if the leader is clicking fast trying to fast travel then it can happen. My friend experiences it when he clicks fast but oddly it only happens with some people not others but now he just makes me team leader as I don't click as fast (original xbox is slow so kinda can't)
---
Too many. I carry around a powerful automatic handmade, an automatic Fixer, a .50 cal machine gun, a 40mm auto grenade launcher, the Black Diamond ski sword, and a two shot MIRV Fat Man. I used to carry a shotgun and two pistols along with all that, but decided to specialize into commando and heavy gunner
---
Nope no errors, havent changed anytuing either.
---
It's the Internet. Ignore them. Easy as that.
---
Pretty sure you get the plan from the terminal outside of the loony bin where the Line in the Sand event takes place. 
---
If you're on ps4 I'll craft one for you.
---
Usually bloddied builds run some tank perks serendipity, Blocker ,etc. These perks give more chances to survive these hits and also LifeGiver gives up back when losing the last amount of hp threshold i think you need speed demon for it to activate its a known bug that occurs with anything that gives base hp to the player
---
I got it like once an hour today almost. Not to mention events starting as soon as one ends on the server I was on.
---
Yep, I have 2, and I had found another long ago but I sold it quick for caps, I very much regret it now
---
Don't know if I've ever achieved those damage numbers with any of mine though
---
Nope, nothing like that, its just that signing in message with the circle that is usually only there for a second before the start menu comes up
---
"It just works".
---
Fuck that shit lol
---
I’m excited for daily ops and I just really really hope they are similar to dungeons in other (mmorpg) games
---
They both do.
---
It's Bethesda, this is almost certainly what they want.
---
What platform are you on? I might be able to help a little. Two players hooked me up when I was below rank 20. So, I’m making it my duty to constantly help people below my rank. I’m rank 81 as of tonight. I don’t have crazy legendaries. But I do have plans and I can build stiff at your camp if you want.
---
Use a hand made or fixer. You can make them semi auto yo work with your rifle man perks. Much better rof than the lever action
---
Lunchboxes alone are going to get me a few ranks.  Then there is double score weekend.  Even if all you do is run dailies and catch a couple events that happen to be up you should have no problem getting 100.  Anyone actually grinding XP is going to end weeks ahead and probably quit the game "from burnout" lol.
---
Almost done with the first blue segment.
---
It does feel like it
---
Yep we finally got one
---
Nice. We finally got one after being on all day
---
It's atom shop. So no
---
No because it’s an atomic shop item
---
I am UK on PC lvl 300 a level 230 and a level 130 in game name same as on here.
---
Running bloodied builds non meta and just creating a high health Vanguard but only lvl30 on that one. Look me up.
---
Wouldn't be surprised at all lol
---
Unyilding. You'll be crouched all the time so sent won't help you much.
---
Had a level 300 player take all the stuff out of my free fending machine.
---
I'm missing something: what's "the battle pass"?  
---
I looked all through the Legendary Run menu and website and can't find any mentions of it.
---
Very nice. How do you have so much camp space though?
---
I can only make like a single 3 story house.
---
I think the "has been removed" also happens after a disconnect. If you get booted from or leave the game via a crash, alt+F4 or whatever (and possibly quit to desktop), you often are still in the team when you relog. So I presume there's a degree of time-out buffer.
---
They are probably thinking, if we don't acknowledge them, they'll go away. The only reason it's like this is because they can't find a way to monetize red dead online the way they could with shark cards.
---
What do you mean by head? Like one you can wear?
---
Why?
---
I'm on xbox, got it with gamepass but I'm definitely going to buy it
---
While I understand that not all people might be able to log in to play every day, that seems to be a cornerstone of beth's in-game monetization strategy, so I don't really think it's gonna change all along with all the inherent problems like timegates on scrip, gold and such.
---
On level ups: it is a part of the grind, even when it comes to level up at higher levels. Grind is an integral part of (almost) every modern mmo and to go down this path is up to each player's personal preference. It's a problem for some but again is totally feaaible for others,there's no real middle ground here, I guess. Also, we were given an opportunity to earn the same amount of score in exchange for 25000 xp via repeatable weekly, which is much less than what higher levels require.
---
Lack of totally separate set of daily/weekly challenges for NW is a real issue, that I can totally agree with. Forcing players to play modes they don't like is a bad thing that must be addressed. It really would work better the way you described and I'm baffled how the devs totally missed a point on that one.
---
I haven't seen stims yet but definitely a bunch of chems.
---
Sometimes it happens to me and my friends in SBQ fight or Encrypted fight, all we can do is wait about 15 to 30 minutes, yes it's annoying but it worked for us.
---
If you leave the game, you will lose your loot.
---
It makes sense, Ward is a psychopath and an asshole, meanwhile Foundation is full of pansies (except for the remnants of the military).
---
What's the point of not being allowed to tell people being a dick that they are being a dick? Maybe they don't know they're a dick because nobody ever told them?
---
You going to be on tomorrow?
---
Hero
---
I’m trying to sell mine for 20 each
---
I did the mirelurk one but nothing popped up for raider rep when I did them?
---
&gt; they were freaking beating the poor brahmin with it at first, trying to herd them 
---
I'm level 230ish and I do this for at least 2 swings before I remember what's up, every time.
---
Nope. There’s a free brotherhood one coming up next month though.
---
do you want a two shot g laser ? i’m on xbox too
---
Idk man. When you turn in meat you should get a bit of rep. It's a tiny amount but it should be there
---
You can also defend the area with fishbones once a day (or once per server with a bit of a dialogue loop)
---
Same here. I took a break for a day and looked at the prizes when I played again and saw nothing worth the daily grind I was trying to complete.
---
at Ohio River adventures, also talk to Fishbones, after some dialogue, you can offer to help kill mirelurks attacking their water pump. 
---
There's also the random encounters, I used to check Slocum Joes, as it would vary between Raiders, settlers and random occupants. Help kill whatever enemies are there, talk to them after fight for a small rep boost. (sometimes was able to bring enemies to them, just to start the fight)
---
Lone Wanderer doesn't work in a team, even alone as far as I know. However stuff that requires a team work if you're in a team by yourself. Empath, Herd Mentality for eg
---
The actual chainsaw? I couldn't get any mods on mine
---
Unless they have proof you're fine.
---
That would be neat
---
recipe could be something like-
---
- 250 steel
---
- 1 Fusion Core (to power the device, ideally in the real world you'd require both 'ammo' types - but that's not really possible here, so you just made the fusion core part of the disposable ammo drum)
---
Makes 1x EC Drum (500 rounds)
---
I see posts like these constantly on my feed, but they always just seem like something one of the devs in BGS is writing to get people on their side lol. Not sure how another ridiculous amount of grinding (which is made ever more unattainable due to game breaking glitches) on top of the already absurd grinding mechanics is “very well executed” but I guess that’s just me.
---
Go to C:\Users\yourusername\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76\
---
Delete Fallout76Prefs.ini and Fallout76Custom.ini if they exist and then relaunch the game.
---
Same thing happened at the Fasnacht event. Bunch of low levels hanging around, I would drop the low level item from the sloth (if I managed to tag it) and any duplicate common/uncommon masks I got. Some high level running around picking up everything.
---
Im close to level 200 myself, I have literally no use for a level 20, 2 star weapon. Weighs too much to stash for the scrip. Why tf would someone 50 levels higher than me need it? If you need scrip, Riding shotgun takes 10 minutes bro! Guaranteed legendary errytime!
---
Me too, and I keep reading more and more.  All these people that dodged the ban are trying to high road us when in fact we did nothing wrong.  
---
Whatever, I switched to ESO.
---
I found some in shops and player stores . some weapons you can't get them from breaking them down or there rare mods.
---
This is nlt bethesdas fault, this is the players fault, people need to stop fucking around on tents, and everytime she staggers in the air it resets her ability to land.
---
Why not a backpack magazine like in FO3.
---
46
---
Anyone in a clown outfit comes near me, I'm nuking the entire area and logging out. It's the only way to be sure.
---
This still happens even when no one at the event even has a tent
---
One wasteland?
---
Yea I just ran white springs and it seemed like I was getting around the same xp definitely not double. Though sometimes I saw huge increases like 3000+ for sentry bots. Maybe it is a visual glitch idk I’ll have to keep track of my score tomorrow and see.
---
Only other way not mentioned here is from [random encounters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7ycZJzw_TU), but its god awfully slow so be prepared for lots of server hopping and grinding.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f154f5b&amp;d=sb1s01sq2s32sr2s20p00eh0ee2c62ce0s12ir2ib4ic3a70l71lu2lt2la2a00s71ao0&amp;m=01c2fba
---
Notes:
---
- Lifegiver does more than it states. It's pretty useful.
---
- Only use demo expert if you have some explosive heavies. Else use more gun smith or power user for gattling lasers.
---
- Carry weight perks can be mixed and matched to your likeing. I happen to have some armor pieces with weapon weight reduction, the cap is 95% so 3 armor pieces and 1 perk card was 90% for me which is enough
---
- Escape artist is QoL. You can still sneak with this build, and you need that card to be able to do it effectively.
---
Use whatever guns you want, but you need a bloody fist weapon. I recomend a bloodied gatling gun, explosive if possible,or a bloodied Plasma Caster both of those weapons can one shot enemies in VATS at long range for like 1/8 of your AP. Then carry high DPS weapons like the 50cal, Gatling Lasers (personal fav, lasers go pew pew) and LMG.
---
You can swap perks for Incisor or iron fist if you want, but I find with a bloodied power fist and 30 str I can one shot every "farm" enemy including 68 super mutants without those perks which is all you need out of it, and heavies are fun for everything else.
---
:-)
---
I know. I was bummed out when she died. She’s been helping me make ammo since fo76 launched. She was always there for me.
---
standing on tents, standing on K-9, completely unloading while she's mid-flight...
---
fellas need to let the poor girl land :/
---
that being said idk wtf bethesda was thinking when trying to figure out what makes a good boss fight
---
it gave me one (1) good chuckle. if only I knew how short lived that good humor would be. time makes a dumb heifer of us all
---
The communist one brings stimpaks all the time. If you are looking for stims, pick that one up when it comes around again.
---
This is a great idea
---
I'm having the same issue, it resets back to the low original number once I'm in the store
---
I think i've got it. I think it boosts the xp that the unyielding stat boosts give by 2x also, because im not getting anything near that amount when im in power armor.
---
I pretty much gave up on getting anything from the fasnacht sloth after a while. Riding Shotgun is a fun event though! I do like that one.
---
I call BS on your post except the end.
---
Whatever is shown when you visit the atom shop is how many atoms you have.
---
Do you mean Imposter of Sheepsquatch itself?
---
56
---
Did that and still infinitely loads, even deleted my mods (better inventory and TZ Map) so the game is basically a fresh install and still wont work.
---
If you don't shoot her in the air she will land.
---
She can glitch from explosive bullets in the air.
---
Leaving Sundew Grove open is the best place. Just clip fissure prime and cover Delta, so no one goes there.
---
Crippled is a slur? When referring to someone who is disabled, definitely.
---
But referring to the fact that you've broken a leg during combat against ghouls (which can be solved with a stim) in a fantasy videogame? Taking out a scorchbeast by shooting the wings? Handling a bunch of feral scorched by shooting their legs and making them crawl?
---
Come on, man. That's taking PC a bit too far. It's a verb. You can choose to let it mean something to you.
---
Yes I would if you are fine with that.
---
Why can't she pick people up and drop them?
---
pretty sure if you set it to proletariat it does, just the same as the other bots, however not sure if you set it to chems and alcohol.
---
Afaik there is currently a bug when you open your 5th lunchbox which will negate the 100% xp gain from the 4 boxes but it'll still shows in status that you have the full buff. You have to wait till the buff runs out to apply a new buff. I would recommend to never use more then 2 lunchboxes at a time because anyone could use one anytime, which is very cool in my opinion that it's area wide but unfortunately it doesn't work properly.
---
Give reasons then??
---
You can scrap damaged crops, it gives you the crop back and you can just "plant" it again.
---
So I have to scroll down through the 100 outfits each time? Lol, nah.
---
0.7% vs 1.3% for Crater
---
Because people who weren’t even present during the ordeal have no right talking to the person in regards to them being a dick.
---
If OP and the others didn’t already tell him off than there’s no reason for the 77+ other people who read this post to do so.
---
It just incites more toxic behavior from the community and no one wants that pathetic shit here.
---
Fyi its always double xp for both modes
---
Hush, don't question it.
---
We’re really need an emote that says “you’re a dick”.
---
Yah I know. It just holds up auto repair and I have to go outside and manually remove it
---
I have all 3 bots, and was messing with them today, all all 3 had the identical options via the terminal. Not sure if it's a bug, but now they all have the "revolutionary" and the "weapons and ammo" options, which is a little redundant
---
With the way gauss technology works it would make more sense for a drum powered by fusion cells to be loaded in to the gun. Gauss weapons use magnets to move projectiles at insane speeds so all you would really need is steel and then something to power the electro magnets.
---
Yeah. I parked my tent next to NAR Repair Yard and server-hoped. It’s common to get either the Raiders or the Settlers as one of the groups to spawn. 
---
Keeping at least one alive against whatever enemy was attacking was easy. But the rep gain was so minuscule
---
At monster mash, i’m almost positive that pacifist gets tossed out the window...The event warns you that it’s a PVP event when it starts
---
How about goes too far and not coming back for 1-2 min and fills its health.
---
this is a kind of toxicity I get on the daily. I swear i always get the worst servers with the worst people 
---
sorry you had that experience, been there, it's infuriating af
---
You’re correct sir
---
Windows 10 just updated so check/disable Windows firewall or allow fo76.exe through. Only other thing could be back end issues so I would submit a ticket at help.bethesda.net
---
Wow was ment to be funny thanks for the negitive votes.....
---
No idea what the loot looks like. I've only seen the event three times and each time, I'm in the back, behind the cows, making sure no one sneaks up on the caravan while other people run around shooting stuff.  I've never seen the Captain, either.
---
That's fine. My job is poking cows with a flaming pitchfork to heal them when they get damaged. It's a dirty job, but somebody's gotta do it!
---
(Responders!)
---
Ah okay. Another bug to live with. Thanks for replying mate :)
---
I love the recurve bow. The compound bow sorta sucks. It took me a little time to figure out the get the most out of the bow as it is currently.
---
1. Have the gun-fu perk. Have all the perks and build so you do max damage with your bow.
---
1. Draw bow.
---
1. Select your target with vats. 
---
1. Unselect your target with vats. 
---
1. Select the same target with vats again. It MUST be the same target you selected the first time. If it's a new target, resume from step 4.
---
1. Release arrow. Repeat until target is dead. Single draw/release fire is all that is required for any gun-fu acquired targets.
---
1. Repeat until you run out of targets or AP. 
---
Add the marsupial mutation and the grim reapers sprint perk to the mix and you have everything you need to be "Wastland Legolas."
---
And Wasteland Legolas is a lot of fun. 
---
Finally, I have found that the bow has INSANE range if you don't use vats. Probably the best range out of anything in the game. The damage drop off is significant, but with the right combo of perks and mods you can still one-shot most anything under level 40 from just inside render distance.
---
If it was possible for them to implement this would be a decent idea. It would give the community a lot of different things they've been asking for in one package. I just have my doubts that they'd be able to pull that off in this crappy engine.
---
ah yeah now that i remember when i shutdown my pc last night it did update so ill check that out. of course this has to happen when double xp is on aswell :/
---
Can now confirm that was I said is true.
---
Each level of the buff keeps it's own timer.
---
I've never figured out how to get Fuzzy tokens. I'm level 250, been playing since Beta, and I *still* haven't figured it out. I understand that the grind is obscene tho, so, much like launching  nuke, it's probably a thing I'll never do.
---
Bear Arms is awesome. On my Strength character I basically carry a heavy gun for each ammo type, that's a Gatling gun, minigun, .50 cal, Quad harpoon gun, LMG, Gatling laser, Gatling plasma, auto grenade launcher and Flamer, plus an extra explosive Gatling gun for tagging and a Shishkebab for healing. I'll eventually add a Gauss minigun and a plasma caster to that lineup.
---
On my Perception character, I have a Lever Action, Handmade, and Fixer for general mayhem, an Automatic Pipe for low-level events, a .50 cal for SBQ and Sheepsquatch fights, and a Shishkebab for healing.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f335e88&amp;d=s01sq2s22sx0s32sr2pe2eh2cu0c72ic4s12ip2id2s72a04l71ls2lt2&amp;m=1c2fe3&amp;ad=03458
---
That's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. But you can easily ditch the junkies Park and run vamps or Furiousif you don't like junkies
---
I usually carry 4:
---
my normal Two-Shot Lever Action
---
My backup Lever Action in case the first breaks
---
My Junkies Reduced Weight Shovel for burying the soldier and when I want to whack things.
---
A Bowie Knife that is also reduced weight because it weighs even less than the shovel and is useful occasionally for killing fireflies when I don't want to whack them with the shovel.
---
This could be it. Thanks mate. Any idea why the lunch boxes are actually reducing XP gained? I understand negating the benefit, but not the erroneous reduction of XP compared to no lunch boxes noted above.
---
As someone who has now done both, the suit was much more tedious than launching a nuke hahaha. You get them by completing the challenges at Camden Park, each of them (usually) give you three tokens each
---
ya i kind of agree. I do think that there are SOME people (very small amount) getting wrongfully suspende/banned. However I think probably 98% of them were duping and using exploits.
---
And for the small minority of people that mabye are getting wrongfully suspended/banned blame the cheaters. They created this.
---
I've only been attacked and killed once when I had mask on and it was a very long time ago. I couldn't hit them back cuz I had pacifist on.
---
hahaha, you're not wrong.
---
Nope don't know why this is happening maybe it cancels a couple of other buffs as well like the food buffs
---
This happens to me pretty much every other SBQ fight. A bunch of us trying to get a hit in when one level 9452 player has the Light Machine Gun from hell and turns her into Swiss cheese faster than Usain bolt can run a quarter mile. So fucking annoying
---
People that do this got banned, and just don’t give a fuck anymore. LOL
---
I'm pretty sure I've had two copies of that plan on my vendor for 10 caps each for over a week
---
Oh thats why there is so many noobs. I was really feeling this. Empty servers? Are vendors down again.       
---
      
---
Forgot what I was doing, nek minet, im helping some level 5’s set themselves up lol.
---
Also informed by another friend that they used 3 lunch boxes in a row, but that it did not register the buff. Same issue. Seems like the trigger is a bit strange, but thanks for tracking down one avenue!
---
At level 45 you won’t roll max levels from the purveyor. Wait until your 50
---
Yeah, this is why you have all these options, I own the fasnacht bot, the standard collectron and now the raider one and it doesn't matter which one I place down, I can have them collect anything that the other bots are capable of aswell.
---
I can only assume it was an idiot child....where it was an actual child or just an immature adult is up for debate.
---
I was sad too .. but then I was exploring south of the map, the cliffs to the west of watoga, and she just popped up! Asked me where I wanted to go so we took a joyride back to that place where the communists were.  After I'd happily slaughtered everyone there, she was patiently waiting to drop me off back where she had found me!
---
Don't worry, she is still out there..
---
I'm only at 34 and I've been playing every day doing each daily and weekly.....
---
I go by fed76 and price consistently about 1K under the minimum and nobody ever buys my stuff. I think it's because I'm in the forest nobody bothers checking my camp
---
I’m also thankful they gave 1st members armor skin.. can’t npc them
---
No prob. It was one of the first things I switched on when I started, but in the last week I've been dabbling with it off to see how things go. So far so good.
---
I kept pacifist on because before this I used to play games like Rust and was kind of sick of the constant stress of having a destroyed base or getting attacked on site and thought this game would be similar. 76 is far less stressful lol, so trying things with it off.

---
Seems most are ahead of the curve.
---
Thx for the heads up! 👍 So i guess we have to use the lunchboxes very carefully 😁 even thou it's a bice addition to the game
---
Get a bloodied Gatling gun for trash mobs. No spin-up, accurate, kills everything except bosses in one or two shots, and 5mm is cheap to craft.
---
Naw the ones you put on the wall
---
46 here as well.
---
Use a power armor instead. Much easier for that
---
Has anyone mentioned your missing the head?
---
42 almost 43
---
They do this shit to veteran players b/c there is a high chance they will just buy another account, especially in timing with the double xp event.  It’s too much if a coincidence to have double xp after suddenly banning so many accounts. They ban first for this reason
---
I have never moved any 38 or 44.  I dont even sell it anymore, I just stash it and when I have time I convert it.
---
Marmite is an evil bitch and the more preference you have for a weapon the LESS likely you are to get it!
---
I love my shotguns so ofc when I spent all my scrip yesterday I got TWO cryolators and a missile launcher..
---
I got allies w/ foundation about 2 weeks ago and 2 days ago I reached it with Crater
---
LOL, Beth is suppose to plan their events around other games?!?!?!?!  Yeah it would totally friendly to the 76 player base to have nothing going on this weekend, even though just a portion of the 76 player base is going to buy GoT.  Screw all the 76 players who don't get GoT.
---
Same happened to me. Submited a ticket to Beth
---
I'm planning on doing the same, eventually.
---
Cant keep up with that green ship, he's like 15 ahead of me :/
---
Bethesda: "You want closure?"
---
player: "after all that crap, yes i do..."
---
Bethesda: "...Well so do We!"
---
(Player kicked into appalachia under world, quest auto completes, player DCs, must reinstall)
---
Im not sure if its 100% just that as i have characters without hf and my husband told me he doesnt use hf and he complains about it more than i.
---
To be honest there may actually be some innocent people around, yes. If you are genuinely innocent then you have a fighting chance because otherwise you could just sue bethesda.
---
It being changed with next update.
---
All is well that ends well, New Player got an incredibly set of armor for their level and I got some internet brownies and got to blow off some steam so I am satisfied 👍 and if anyone ever needs anything on PC I am HotMessMandy and you have only but to ask
---
Sry, should've said that in the initial post...
---
Of course I have Serendipity and Blocker 3* equipped...
---
same bug on PC today
---
I actually had no idea, yay
---
When I'm jumping around to vendors, I actually skip camps that have a large variety.  In my experience they're usually full of things like non legendary weapons, common outfits and way overpriced.
---
i bought the garage the other day and i LOVE it. its so badass dude. especially when you hook it up to a genrator and the rocket on the roof shoots continuous fire and the redrocket neon sign lights up. so freakin cool man. you wont be dissapointed with it.
---
*It’ll happen again...*
---
Was looking for a couple of things from whitesprings yesterday and vendors had it there. Was only a hundred or so caps if I remember correctly.

Season 9, episode 1: Bethesda

Sheepsquatch, otherwise i would have just said Assaultron (Same attacks as Imposter)
---
Shoot them in the face.
---
I just used 13 legendary modules and didn't get a single unyielding piece
---
I'm only at level 27, I'm hoping I'm not that far behind. 
---
I realized joining a team is the easy daily, I thought you had to be with your team the whole time.
---
AFAIK Its still going to be on a terminal, but they are making it so you can trade more ammo in one go and bank more points.
---
Double xp is really helping me I’m at 50 now I’ve only levelled up 3 times with some spare atoms (I’ve also ranked up each time I’ve hit an atoms card as it’s essentially a free level). 
---
I’ve noticed now though before I could easily hit 2-3 score levels per session and now I seem to be struggling now it’s nearly 2500 per.
---
I'd have cut some characters tho. All those family relations were getting too clustered at the end of season 2.
---
It was way too hard to relearn everything at the start of season 3.
---
The show was well written tho,and one of the best depiction of time travel,if not the best.
---
Use a " air lock" system by putting down a few shelves or display cases, 
---
you do not need to lock door but players have to close door to pass through.

Shepards Crook!

(shakes cow bell at player fresh from Vault 76)
---
"what do you want?"
---
(cowbell noise)
---
"wtf?!?"
---
(more cowbell noise)
---
"Aaaaaa!" (runs away)
---
(in pursuit, cowbell a clangin')
---
Yes, it’s still the best.  All anybody seems to do these days is nuke for SBQ...so tired f that
---
Don't worry I know where you're coming from. I've just recently started on Xbox and compared to PS4 xbox has Alot less assholes. But anyway I was doing the Queen on XB1 and all of a sudden 3 extremely high players over 1000 each one shot the SBQ. I was gob smacked they took her down in 30 seconds. Crazy. Didn't even get 5% on her
---
I really wish they had tied the progression to basic xp earning rather than challenges so I could do the stuff I enjoy rather than forced to jump thru specific hoops every day/week.
---
I was looking forward to Fallout 76 Seasons but noped out on the first day.
---
Yep still a terminal, just less clicks a d faster conversion. I do think the terminal works, it's just automated deconstruction and construction.
---
I just hit 40 before bed doing my wastelanders story
---
he likes em soft
---
It's not the low level that are raising significantly, it's the high levels that disappeared, after the massive banwave a good amount of them was wiped out
---
It's something I suppose
---
Obviously I'm missing the head, but that's another 200-hour grind away lol
---
I run a one person build a team for the intelligence boost.
---
Its ~2% per Int point. 
---
Which is why I recommended class freak.
---
Monster mash is a clusterfuck of getting one shorted then running around like a twat trying to find the other player
---
I'm a junkie and would definitely recommend that. SS armor is so high dr that you don't really need vanguards, especially if you're using buttressed mods. I've heard that using a full set of damage reduction from each enemy type works well. -15% damage from mutants, scorched etc.
---
(drops ammo in bag)

(logs out)

(logs in)
---
"Where's ammo? damn synths"
---
Honestly, if the vendors aren't directly on the ground or on the first floor, I tend to be cautious. Ever since I fell into a trap camp (with inactive traps thankfully), I always look through vendors in my jetpack power armor.
---
I certainly think you're right for most people. Personally, I don't like surprises (in general) and I like planning and optimising and anticipating. I do realise I'm in the minority though!
---
My heart dies a little bit each time i see his event on the map.
---
I just want to be able to get the new Power Armor and Jetpack without having to spend Atoms. Unfortunately I’m like a week or two behind because I didn’t jump in at the start
---
Thank you for confirming! I would say that the communist bot is the best one if you had to only pick one, IMO.
---
you learn the plan, then apply it to combat armor...
---
the plan is where the others say it is
---
God roll 50 cal. I used it until I got a Bloodied 50 cal
---
Thank you appreciate that help new to the game ;)
---
Yeah noticed this myself, was initially at 50% and the XP was very good, then I went to Line in the Sand and I don't know how many lunchboxes were opened but the amount of XP dropped substantially even though it said 100%. I logged off and came back later, it said 75% and my XP was excellent again.
---
Yeah, your're probably right. People like that just get my goat.
---
Appalachia  is finite. Its resources, finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.
---
I get what you’re saying, but Jesus man you’re reaching really hard. Crippled has a ton of connotations that aren’t related to disparaging someone. The “N-word” clearly has one connotation and you’re weakening your argument by trying to compare them.
---
How can she help?
---
They already hotfixed the dupe issue and the double XP weekend has been on the roadmap for ages. Perhaps people shouldn't have taken advantage of a new dupe exploit right before a double xp weekend?
---
You have to put nuka colas and the ammo type for the weapon you want in his cash register to gain better rolls. More NukaColas, better the roll...
---
(just kidding, but i do it anyway, because bethesda effed my brain)
---
the date of double xp weekend was announced weeks before the duping glitch got public.
---
Succinct and astute. Yes.
---
I hate that. 
---
I'm only a 45 right now but I try and let everyone get a hit even when I'm getting my ass handed to me! Shotguns for life hahaha
---
you kinda just have to accept it. due to some infighting in the cheat community there is a possible silver lining. new and existing cheaters are going to have to pay for the hacks for NW in a couple weeks. hang in there and it will go down to normal levels of getting sniped constantly every 3 games.
---
the cheat community decided to just say fuck it and patch the nw cheat detection themselves in the hack since after a year, bethesda couldnt be bothered to do it.
---
Yup, president Eden has malfunctioned again and is running the Santa.exe program...
---
But banning right before double xp weekend is sus
---
No need I always try and help lower levels and I have shit stuff 🤔
---
Last time, I managed to get around that by adding more foundations snapped to the existing one.  It shouldn't matter, but it did.
---
[The wiki has a good overview.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders_reputations)
---
TL;DR: Crater daily; Photo Opportunity daily from Davenport - choose Foundation and hand in the pictures to Kiyomi at the Crater; give mirelurk meat to Blackeye at Ohio River Adventures.
---
If you can stand the grind and absolutely must max your rep ASAP, farm random encounters but the rep gain is tiny.
---
Huh, still had the [bethesda](https://bethesda.net).net version installed and that works fine. Cool i guess
---
Its a bug, chances are noone else can see the crate, only you. Same thing happens with scorchbeast corpses, no idea what causes it, but they can suddenly spawn above you without warning. Seems to happen the most when you fast travel and arrive.
---
there was a colossal problem with the "colossal problem" event, so bethesda delayed it because crushing hopes and dreams tastes like victory to them
---
So let me guess, you were banned for exploiting a glitch in the game.
---
Should of had a special effect that recycles ammo every 5 shots or some shit it’s powerful but I got a pentabarrel, two shot +25fr and it’s just an expensive light show 😂 it’s not that powerful..sort of needs a buff
---
In the event breach and clear mother lode will emerge from the ground and you can loot all of the ore she mined. You can make about 2000 bullets per haul.
---
No one can be truly banned if accounts are cheap asf to buy, according to a friend
---
Nope. Unless a visual glitch that causes my jetpack to disappear counts.
---
i get closer to Zorbo's ship, and then he flies further... i'm on the orange part now... meh
---
Never done breach and clear should. Just never bothered
---
(tries to log in, error message, reloads everything... error, gives up)
---
(draws line in cat's litterbox)...
---
"It's not the same"
---
Two ‘clips’ of ammo let’s say is like 1300 rounds and it takes up so much space 😂
---
So, why did people duped if they can not stand the punishment? Dont cheat, simple as that and then you can enjoy the double xp event. Also, its date are told us months ago, so it is not sudden, out of the thin air.
---
where's Zorbo's ship? did you pass it yet?
---
Your edit is correct.
---
No it isn't.
---
😂 innit
---
lead paint
---
Such a weird take. It's not like Bethesda had a vested interest in drawing players from a new samurai game to a 2 year old MMO. The new Paper Mario came out this weekend too, was this another wrinkle in Bethesda's plan?
---
I've had the same thing happen to me...
---
Days left until it ends. You have to beat it to the goal
---
Glad you got it going. I wouldnt be surprised if that is related to your issue as both clients share the game files but I know beth.net uses an ini file to locate your game server for logging in. So maybe when you have more time uninstall and try steam again.
---
Also keep in mind the platforms have separate atoms and 1st subscriptions.
---
The normal scavanger give you the option for junk or scrap. The Raider lets you search for chems and alc. Or ammo and weapons.
---
NOTE: The Skin doesnt matter. - You can have a RAIDER Collectron that is looking for SCRAP or JUNK as long as you vave bought the Scavanger Collectron. Or Vise versa a SCAVANGER Collectron that is looking for CHEMS and ALC as long as you have bought the Raider Collectron.
---
B/c ppl got dozens of mules if not more to make $10,000/month or more from RMT which is easily done by this broken game &amp; its weekly-monthly dupe bugs each patch
---
Nope. You'd still get all the base weapons. The fixer, sheep staff, sheep club, bear arm, and the bullion stuff are the only things you need to learn the plans for the have mama mole drop
---
I used (wasted) probably 30 modules over the past two weeks trying to make an unyeieding left arm. All for nothing.
---
There is a post on here about it some where. It's a visual glitch either your been disconnected or server is having issues it's saying people are been locked when they leave the group also not sure about your situation though. Pretty shitty of you get kicked though for nothing
---
It really isnt
---
Nein.
---
Cripple can be used in a non-slur descriptive way. It can certainly be used as a slur. But it still has valid and descriptive meanings in popular culture [notably in video games in general] outside of a slur against a disabled individual.  
---
The N-word on the other hand can only be used one way really. It was born a slur to dehumanize people and remains one. 
---
Queer is kinda a case where nuance might apply because some people in the group on the historically receiving end have reclaimed the word to an extent. It can most definitively be used as a slur, but it also now has more expansive meanings in the group. 
---
I get your argument but you might be associating the word in a manner it's not intended. Maybe there could be another world chosen but I think it would be disingenuous to suggest that Bethesda is using it in a slur like capacity when describing the limb damage system.
---
Perfect. Thanks for saving me all that time!
---
I’d rather they be on top of duping instead of punishing players for their own buggy game
---
As a general purpose workhorse, Final Word isn't bad at all - the only downside of that gun is it's accuracy.
---
You might get more DPS out of a Furious Ultracite Gatling laser as long as you can keep up your supply of fusion cores. I don't like spin-up in a general purpose gun, but for boss fights this is a really nice weapon.
---
A Furious LMG has very good burst damage but a small magazine, and it eats .308 like crazy.
---
Will be doing this soon..will have to tell my boss I’m showing symptoms 😂
---
Then they should not cry if they are banned anytime... double xp event, or not. They lost, what? A mule? A mule does not need xp anyway.
---
&gt;If the dev team actually cared
---
You know they aren’t the ones that decide this stuff, right? They just do what they’re told. Regardless, the double xp weekend has been on the roadmap for a long time now; well before the dupe became public knowledge. The people that got banned maybe shouldn’t have been duping, y’know?
---
Probably, I'm not sure when though
---
And that has what to do with the last ban wave and the current double xp weekend?
---
No way you can get banned from picking up dropped loot cause it could be duped I always grab left over stuff if no one is about am opportunistic person oh crap 🤦‍♂️
---
Well i launched the game directly from the steam install folder exe rather  than through steam and now it works ???¿¿¿ i dont understand one bit but oh well, as long as i can farm xp now lmao
---
Well it ain’t like me, everytime I get in a team everyone leaves for no reason it’s like if a was a bad player or idk what have I done to people to hate me so much and leave
---
Yeah it was weird timing both times it was as soon as the event ended and it stopped showing the rewards for the event
---
Double xp has been planned for a while, get over it. Don't chest/dupe &amp; you won't get banned
---
Ya’ll that keep defending this controversial company are stuck in a sunken coast fallacy.  It’s like everyone forgot about the 200$ nylon trash bag before the game even came out
---
Fuck, I just want the dalies to not be auto completed before I log in for the day. Did every trick too. No NW, No Private. Logged off normal 8+ hrs before reset, logged in 1 hour after reset. No fucking dalies. I can't fathom how they can continue to claim they've fixed this.
---
It's possible.  It's also possible that the 'I didn't dupe' people got banned for having a collection of B2525 fixers (or whatever was being duped), even if they didn't duplicated it themselves on that character on that account.
---
I haven't dug into any of the claims, no one I know in game has been banned (though that's a very small population), so it's all speculation.  But I suspect they were able to flag something with the latest dupe that either marked anyone doing the dupe (likely), or they've developed a way to track the duped items better than they were able to before (less likely, but still possible).  Or some combination of the 2.
---
Yup, I remember buying it from whitesprings awhile ago and it was 230 caps.
---
They made these dupe glitches possible. Wdym LOL
---
&gt; so what am I going to miss because I can’t catch Zorbo?
---
You will miss the rewards that your little rocketship does not reach on the Legendary Run board game.  I am guessing that since you're asking this question, you have not seen the board.  And if you have not seen it, then you have a bunch of rewards waiting for you.
---
what level are you?
---
single digit levels are not great on an events team of + 50's
---
And what does the ToS says? The ToS, you know, that you signed when you bought the game.
---
My heavy uses a Anti armor gatling gun for everyday use and an ultracite final word for queen fights.
---
I calculated I have obtained 69750 score up to now.
---
I need another 154000 to reach the end.
---
I'm aiming for rank 80, and il use my atoms on the last 20 levels, meaning I only need 89250 score. Which means I will be halfway by Tuesday most likely.
---
I don't know that. I do know they have thousands of duped items on those accounts and one person sells from that account. My point is the bot isn't catching them but it catches people who made dumb trades or purchases or even just bought a gun in a vendor bot someone else used to dupe. It's very inconsistent which is a tad frustrating. That's all I'm really saying.
---
It makes sense. Vault 76 was designed to preserve the 'best' and 'brightest'. How else do you determine who qualifies to survive without a dangerous test. This is just one giant vault-tec experiment. 
---
I believe the winner of this test/experiment is given cookies.
---
I already told you. They. Only. Do. What. They’re. Told. If the person that’s in charge of them says to do more work on an upcoming event and issues that have been going on for months, then that’s what they’re going to work on. An entire dev team, or just a single dev, can’t just say “screw it, I’m gonna work on this thing instead” just because they want to. That’s how you stop getting paychecks.
---
So you mean, you want them to fix the dupe issue (which they did) but you didn't want to be banned for it?
---
Dude, the ones that are crying are the ones that got temporarily suspended b/c their dumb dupe/hack scanning bot mistakenly found that they had a shitload of steel when really it’s easy asf to farm that
---
West Tek. Is not about the mutties but your bonuses
---
U notice how they always fix it after banning?
---
That hasn't happened to me in months, ah the good old days lol
---
44
---
“Hey, bud. We in the same lobby?”
---
“Yep.” 
---
“Cool. Spawn by the spot that always has the large crate?” 
---
“Sounds good. You kill me first.”
---
Repeat until both players have killed each other. Congrats!
---
That’s sad. You’re right
---
Oh look. It's raining salt.
---
I feel your frustration, tried dropping stimpacks, radaway etc for two players (lvl8 &amp; lvl 9) they were bugging me to trade throughout collision course. I dropped the bundle did the “gift” emote &amp; before the emote displayed a Lvl 89 had sprinted in from nowhere and picked it up. I did the shaky head emote at him, he then started shooting me (I’m lvl200), I walked away &amp; he followed, shooting all the way. 
---
Some people are just twats.
---
I never shoot her when she's in the air. It a waste of ammo and  a waste of time for everybody. Let her land and then go ham. The whole fight will be 100% quicker.
---
I'm level 247
---
Yeah we are at the apocalypse and expect everyone to behave nicely. Sad news, is not like that. I can be that guy if I feel like it, and I can also help if I feel like it. 4he beauty of this game is you okay like you feel it
---
I have a shitload of steel, and I have legacies too. I did not get suspended. So, do not tell me that all and every suspended account is innocent...
---
Aquaboy is super useful. how can you kick that guy?
---
How do people freeze the Sbq?
---
I’m 560 not 569 and I was looking for the damn bathroom.
---
Stop acting like the world fucking revolves around you. There’s a long history of posts from ppl here &amp; other forums from people that have been banned mistakenly in the past not for that but other things that can give a bot a false positive
---
It's a bit of a tease when I see one. I'm like, "loot!"...then the disappointment sets in 😂
---
Unfortunately it does happen on occasion. A ticket is likely your best bet.
---
Blame is on Beth for those magic effects. If someone can get free lot and don't waste 30 min fighting the queen, that now can't be crippled and can't be forced to land, so be it. This is a post apocalyptic game, not Disneyland
---
I'm either 40 or 41. I did the NW challenge last and cant remember if it pushed me to 41 or not. Happy I finally unlocked the sheepsquatch plushie. Next thing I'm looking forward to is the Lightning bug jar, then the chicken coop.
---
Or ban you after fixing it. What the hell do you expect them to do? I had a feeling you were child when I read your OP, but after your subsequent replies, that is the only conclusion I can come to. You aren't even making an argument at this point. Hell, you're barely making sense. This has been the way fixes and ban waves have been done in online games since online games were a thing. Its not new. Its not some scheme cooked up by bethesda. Its the responsible thing to do. Fix your glitches and ban the accounts that used it.
---
&gt;ultracite final word
---
Is it a mod ? I was under the impression there was only 2 for the 50 cal. The prime receiver ( haven't dropped for me yet ) and heavy barrel.
---
Just wait until you get to around level 50 and everything good seemingly disappears about the game. If I had any advice to give new players its take your time, enjoy. Never worry about late game. You'll have a lot more fun.
---
&gt;is. Very selfish of people to do that. I en
---
It is the wasteland, there are raiders everywhere
---
But my experience is everyone is jumping around like pricks with the frog legs.  Hiding in roofs with 50 grenades.
---
because that would be enjoyable and convenient. that goes against bethesda creed.
---
Do you see a difference in xp if you are in a full event group? Seems like I was getting the same xp if I was alone or if I had a full team.
---
We can have a drum mag instead of core.
---
I had similar frustrations with the train carriage so AFAIK none of the preplaceable buildings can snap. So change this request to " **Hey BETHESDA, please make all prebuilt buildings snap to foundation blocks** "
---
But throw in an extra please, just to be sure :)
---
That was taken because all the flakes were complaining that the game was too damn aggresive and they were "griefed"
---
It makes it annoying as it is having to get out of my power armour to craft but then I have to scroll through my pip boy to get it back out
---
Just run through a silo and launch your own nuke? Someone correct me if I'm wrong but there is zero difference between launching your first nuke vs your 100th.
---
I've mentioned it on this subreddit before, but one night my partner and I had a particularly needy drop crate that was following us everywhere, I think it must have appeared with us about a dozen times. It always scared me when I was doing my thing and then all of a sudden I'd hear the noise of the flare popping on it.
---
So use a less OP gun and don't sneak if you do. It's quite easy.
---
There is zero reason to go all out on the legendary nightstalker with 6 other people in the room for example, we all know bloodied commando builds with legacy guns are overpowered and don't need to be shown again.
---
(thinks about the Postman movie)
---
Just nope, using converter instead of runing lucky hole mine(for lead) and west tec(for steel) is a stupid idea.
---
According to several reports, Gunsmith is broken in current patch and doesn't decrease durability degradation. Same for White Knight and armour.
---
If it means anything, you can rename the power armor to **(1) Power Armor [T-51b]** or whatever and it will be at the top of the list.
---
Right I literally said that I know I can do that, but I was excited to finish up the story.
---
You do it because you know there aren't any consequences.
---
the GMG is really just a flex weapon. In practice, its not that much better than the other high end heavies.
---
I don't mind it being more demanding on ammo consumption, since its a very definitely an endgame shiny.
---
There's plenty of economical heavies that can still be competitive in the meta.
---
Because is a game meant to be played that way.
---
I already do this but it is even more annoying when I accidentally click on the wrong one as I carry three with me at one time
---
If you have speed demon mutation, you're maxed out on speed bonus. So that part is also rather useless... 😜
---
My daughter plays on PC, and recently complained that whichever ally she has would walk around her house and open ALL THE DOORS. Happened with three different allies.
---
It's just the prime mod
---
It may cause another bugs n glitches
---
Then...name each one for what suit it actually is? If you’re still selecting the wrong one if they’re clearly individually labeled, then that’s kinda on you.
---
Well I had heavily invested on PvP on my build. I don't mind anyone coming at me. I have fun and can hold my own fo a while. And if they kill me I'll just laugh and move on. Is a game, not real life buddy.
---
Sbq?
---
(Broadsider) 
---
"Pirate Time!"
---
(lore person): "There are no pirates in Apallachia"
---
"Yarrr (drinks rum, shoots broadsider, waves revolutionary sword around, eye patch, and long coat)
---
(Lore Person): "No that's not accurate gear!"
---
(drinks rum irl) "yarr!"
---
Its a great system to have, yeah.
---
In the background. Right now its the only thing going on in the game. Now, I love my new sheepsquatch plushie to death but ugh. I want to run Colossal Problem or at least do the stupid Rebuilding ATLAS thing.
---
Still trying to farm the forest camo jumpsuit from Forest events...almost lvl 400 here
---
No
---
Also make sure the gramophone is turned off, and the door into the tinker workstation is closed.
---
I’d suggest Locked and Loaded for the heavy guns reload speed increase, but it doesn’t even work half the time. I have to switch weapons and back for the perk card to kick in
---
Through out the wastelands, you’ll encounter raiders and settlers. Sometimes they are fighting creatures. Help kill the creatures you might get a small rep boost. Sometimes talking to them gives you that, or items. You have to pick the right dialog with some of the raiders. They like to talk about violence. 
---
You won’t encounter any of these random chances if you fast travel everywhere.
---
Didn’t know you could mount them.
---
So random, pure win!  Good show OP.
---
Agreed, but how about snap to all floors too? I would have bought the train carriage if I could stack them(and that I could use wallpaper in them)
---
did his name begin with CMT? just today someone that level went around the map killing anyone claiming a work shop. He took me out which is fine, im lvl 120 and getting junk is not hard.   
---
But then he went to another camp where my son was playing with three other lvl 15's, and he wiped them out.   
---
Three times. They ended up logging off to change servers.   
---
if that is you, then i highly encourage you to not only copulate with yourself, but copulate with a hormonal pissed off bull.
---
Yeah. So all and every banned player are innocent. Cool story.
---
One way to fix this is to take off a limb and put it back on a couple times, that usually works
---
True
---
I'm at 40 atm, a few dailies didn't gave a score, and one day was auto-screwed. I'm not going to NW so these points like screwed too. 
---
Just thought I might share to compare.
---
Yeah I saw a lot of people complaining about end game stuff being quite barren at the moment, so have been taking my time and just slowly messing about. I'm waiting to see what happens in the next year or so. Overall most of my fun comes from just following people around lol.
---
I hated how they treated the raiders.
---
I joined the raiders to raid. This is a Fallout game and I want to be evil, so let me be evil.
---
I don't want to collect vacuum tubes, I want to pillage.
---
So I am okay to play the game as normal for the time being it sounds like?
---
Yep- I wiped my camp in order to make the Red Rocket my centrepiece and its a bastard to site. Unless it's perfectly flat it looks shit, and not only that you just can't get foundation flush to it. I had the same with the train carriage.
---
So. Back to my old base layout and praying for a game expansion that doesn't have every awesome site occupied by a fukn shit 'pre existing location'.
---
Good work!
---
Tasty, tasty salt.
---
Would a two-shot 50 cal be an improvement ? Or the accuracy loss is not worth it, what about explosive ? I really like Final word, it is amazing for general purpose but a bit underwhelming for high level events.
---
Not gonna lie, you can’t place anything anywhere anyways lmao. Would mod support allow the community to make red green colorblind modes for the game?
---
Also put that player on block for session so they can’t see you in the map and follow you around.
---
They probably also start events without waiting for more people to show up and then it fails or the outcome isn't as good.
---
Don't do silos while on a public team, you auto-complete the quest "I am become death" for *everyone* on that team if they haven't yet completed it.
---
Only during events, i think?
---
I did it this night.
---
My favorite spots are the Sundew groves.
---
I wish there were more enemies in the trenches to surprise you.
---
Someone mentioned on another thread similar to this of making loot bags we drop level locked. So if we see a low level person we lock the bag at say level 1-20,20-40,40-50,50+. 
---
I personally like that idea as it seems fair and would prevent used toilet paper wads like the guy you ran into from taking stuff.
---
9 Dailies is a good amount.
---
Me who has the luxury of being able to log on everyday and do all the dailies was never going to have a problem hitting the end of the Run.
---
This encourages more casual players to play more when they have the time, because it makes the later rewards more attainable.
---
I'd say they're even more likely to buy out the rest of the ranks. Whales are going to buy all the ranks pretty much ASAP anyhow. For non-whales, very few would dump 45-60 on reaching the Rank 100 bundle, but something 15 bucks to buy up the remainder is a lot more reasonable for most people.
---
Dusky Yao gui
---
It was not that individual but I am very sorry happened to your son and his teammates.
---
This is a major bruh moment
---
Yeah, and my point is that there isn't a single difference no matter when or how many times you do it. You can still get that same experience you're looking for. If knowing the quest has been checked off once before really ruins the experience for you then I'm sorry. It just seems like a pretty thing to complain about in my opinion.
---
They should have called it Christmas ghillie skins
---
Nifty idea, has potential. Quite like.
---
I get that bug about 80% of the time I die, sometimes I'm forced to relog... It's really frustrating.
---
Woooof That is a relief to here, I hit 44 today
---
God, yes, please.
---
yeah we finally found one
---
Thanks for the advice. If you're on PC and it's still for sale I'd buy that lever action!
---
Cryolator or Cryo arrows

Not looking to good. But maybe if you grind a ton
---
According to the people who "did the math", completing all the challenges every day, every week, will just barely get you to 100. I've not done the math myself, but I do know that you can buy your way with atoms. That is, if you're an obsessive completionist/ collector. Nothing bad happens if you don't reach 100. Who knows, some of the skins and such, will make a reappearance.
---
Why thank you!
---
I gotta have more cowbell!
---
An outrageous twatwaffle
---
That’s why we need player police.
---
Tesla getting fixed next patch. You need to hit something for it to arc now.
---
The free aim arc was always a bug.
---
STOP CLOSING MY DOORS I LEAVE THEM OPEN FOR A REASON.  I have a lock on my front door so I can shut it and lock out my vendors if I am near cap limit.  People come by and shut my doors and block others from using my machines
---
You wont hurt anything and as far as I know its just one of those random bugs.
---
I posted before...but when I saw the slocum joe bundle I was sooo excited because I was ready to give praise to the wasteland gods for this auto close doors from FO4...
---
but nooo like a needle through my birthday balloon, my dreams were popped when I saw it included everything but. 
---
Two signs (3 if you count the free one) and lots of other cute stuff, but nothing to fix the pet peeve that oh so many players have complained about since day one!
---
When they finally let her get crippled again, I will permanently glue her to the ground with my shotgun build
---
Man I hate people who don’t share legendary monsters, especially the ones who one-shots them and then brags about it.  It’s like yeah I can do that to, but rather switch weapons and let everyone tag first.  Annoying fs.
---
Jesus guys.. you have already almost completed 50% of the battle pass while im only on level 25. 
---
I mean one reason why i'm so slow with this BP is because i have a job. Do you guys have no jobs or something?
---
Didn't buy it, don't care. Doesn't have anything to do with the actual game and definitely hasn't anything to do with the duper ban. Your rhetoric is... strange.
---
This is why people need to learn to get comfortable with voice chat. So you can say, “Hey Noobstar420, come here I want to give you something. I don’t need this weapon, you might find it useful. Let’s trade.” Or, “Hey, lets go behind this dirty shed so I can drop something for you.”
---
Shepskwonk
---
Where are all these bags of randomly dropped loot that they all say they've picked up? I never see this happen, ever. The only stuff I find in loot bags is rotten food and mini nukes.
---
Wait what’s being reset on the 20th? I hope you say it’s the amount of XP needed to level up lol
---
They don't even need to add new models for display cases, there are plenty of shelves in the game already that they could just add the ability to place items on display in. I hope the thanksgiving one comes back around this year, I've seen it at others camps and its nice not having things behind glass.
---
Make those cores into full ultracite cores and maybe it will move better.
---
Wait is there gonna be a new bp on the 20th? Or am I reading this wrong? Cause I just got back into the game and I want the firefly jar :(
---
Welp, I guess I’m somewhat screwed lol, thanks for the info though!
---
He has a name! Mr Pebbles!

---
I missed a week as well already and am rank 21. Definitely dont think we can make 100 if we play every day and do the dailies/weeklies. My plan is to try an get to about 80 and then use my atoms to get to 100.
---
Yes, it will generate stimpaks.
---
I'd settle for a bench that just scraps stuff. I grab anything and everything I come across. I'll take every shitty shot gun or mole miner gauntlet and pipe pistol I find because scrap is my bestest friend. Even if it doesn't have any crafting options just having the ability to break down weapons and armor would be wonderful.
---
Nope. You're better off just running through super mutant zones in Divide, Mire and Bog
---
At the very least, I expected this. All the shelves and displays we currently had, I was expecting them to turn them into functioning displays. Just like the did with the comic stands.
---
Seems like just about every new addition or idea they have, they never finish before moving onto the next thing.
---
You don't get a second chance with the yogi bears.
---
I just want placemats as single-item displays. The possibilities would be endless.
---
This happened to me earlier when I was selling fixers to lower levels at my vending machine for 1 cap each and some level 450 comes and takes them all :(
---
Oh no the PvP is full with griefers n haters dun hurt my feeling pls, that’s what they will say
---
Fuck that guy
---
And the New weapon you learn, she give me 3* bfr Gauss  machine gun
---
For lead just farm places with can traps, 9-10 lead and some steel when you scrap all the cans.
---
Skins, outfits, camp items, plans, mods are all also content. You have a severely limited personal definition of "new content" if you only consider playable content as the only type. Even so, I do not know many MMOs pumping free DLCs every this frequently.
---
Nope..... Had a tonne of mutants doing this lastnight. You can vats lock them and everything but they can't be killed.
---
Oh no, they will tell u dun teach them how to play the game
---
The legendary run is great! But as always the rewards are pretty umderwhelming...
---
At level 100 u should be rewarded with one 3* Legendary item and u should be able to choose its atributes by urself.
---
B25/25 Fixer for example or a unyielding/AP refresh/Weapon weight Chest Piece...
---
I dont want fcking cosmatics or Atoms or what not.
---
This has been an issue since launch my friend. The community have suggested fixes and Bethesda would rather sell atoms than provide a fix
---
This is what I do while under level 20, grind up some rep just running between local spawn points for these.
---
The trainyard near Watoga has a chance to spawn this encounter too, but the enemies are usually a much higher level.
---
I said the bullion gear.
---
Don't craft weapons
---
As long as you queue up as solo, why not? You'Re not breaking any rule, some people hate to fight other players, so being a pacifist is fine.
---
I kinda wish there was more to fighting her. Maybe like an animation grab where she grabs a random player and throws it or a like a wing swipe that knock backs everyone around 5m (not stagger).   
---
Just something to change the combat loop of just shooting at her till she dies.
---
currently like 4 but 3 of them have 90% weight reduction effect.
---
One Maingun. Currently a Combat Shotgun and 3 weight reduced explosive weapons, Auto Grenade launcher, Fat Man, Missile Launcher.
---
You have to do 1000 damage.
---
You have a magic weapon. Use it right and you'll delete bats while hopped up on Formula P
---
Explosives good but you dont benefit from any of the Heavy Weapon damage perk cards
---
Good guy Bethesda having a x2 xp weekend right after bans so you can level up your new account quickly.
---
Really the diference between damage imput with 400 dr or 8oo is about 20% good set uny have Moré benefits for good set bolstein, and, you level up faster, very important for get score or level up for future legendary perks
---
How fast do they respawntho
---
Don't craft pieces in quick succession, the RNG gets hitched on certain parts of the loot table - causing you to roll the same couple effects over and over.
---
Acid Soaker
---
True, true  sorry bro
---
I’ve already skipped several NW challenges. Especially the ones such as: use a stimpack on 2 teammates, pick a lock two times, rank your overseer rank.
---
I'll save my lunchboxes for private servers only then.... And won't be mad if other people open their lunch boxes in adventure mode and it messes up as their not mine.
---
Now and then, yes. Especially if I go over to Whitesprings. I have a great shot posing next to a couple that glitched out after being on fire. 
---
They are both standing engulfed in flames, frozen, flames and all.
---
Eh, if you stack it right and get to tag everyone you can get like 4000xp per wave on Line in the Sand. And there‘s like 10 waves or so.
---
And that’s without the double xp going on right now.
---
10.000 sounds like a lot, but you’d be surprised how quickly you get those.
---
Immediately if you change servers
---
Wow even on fire? I guess it just works lol. This game is a all you can eat bug fest.
---
I'm allies with the raiders because it had a.... shortcut 🤫. But ultimately I am going to side with the settlers, just haven't done much to gain rep with them yet.
---
But doing rotations around a nuked white springs seems more efficient in respawns than switching servers? Maybe I’m wrong
---
Damn son you've gotten far haha
---
Haha, I've never not been disappointed when I go to high level player vendors. I can only assume all their good gear is on mules and they have no need for caps, probably only stocking trade only weapons.
---
Well last night I made 3 silos and the robots inside lvl 50 were giving me only 35 xp. Later when I finished the mission head off to the prime fissure and did Scorched earth. Some of the mobs were giving me 500 xp some 30 some 20 some 150.. and most of them are only high levels 70 or 65. So I am not sure that the double xp is really working g correctly. Note: I haven't used any chem for boost.
---
we need a Middle Finger emote. Like the one the vault boy gives in death from above.
---
So, basically the Hunting Rifle - LMG situation, only this time, the rapid-firing weapon is the worse weapon.
---
What? Underwhelming rewards, bugged progression, removed daily atom points...u ok with all that? Bethesda is slowly turning this into free to play. Oh, 150 atoms to progress one level...
---
lmao no. im at level 81, ill finish and have spent zero dollars
---
Did it aswell last night. In the ash heap too.
---
First it got stuck for like 10 minutes at the charlestoe fire station with no mobs around. Then it got stuck at the ridge entering Charleston since he couldn't find a path
---
We finally managed to get it to its destination and if you're wondering why the persistence on my part, I wanted to complete that event since it was the last one I needed for a challenge.
---
Anyway after finishing the event and the challenge, I wasn't awarded my 80 atoms..
---
Aww look at this big floofba -- OMG MY FACE
---
This same thing happened to my brother (not fixer’s though). So he put up a sign instead that said “new to FO76? DM me for some supplies”. He lives just below the vault and regularly farms ticks for stimpaks and gives them to people right out of the vault. It’s a bummer when greedy people make things much more complicated to just help new players.
---
You should be able to get 1 rank a day just from dailies till you get 60 though?
---
LOL  Reminds me of when I attempted a "nuke going off behind me" photo, unaware that I was within the blast radius...
---
No. They'd respawn quick because someone logged in on an alt account, which triggers a respawn.
---
I believe the current "first shot missing in vats" bug can be circumvented by quickly locking on, off, and on again in vats. I personally haven't tried it but saw it in an angryturtle vid about the gauss rifle which has the same issue due to its charge up requirement.
---
It's not ideal but might be worth a try if you can get the hang of it!
---
Well I toke plenty of levels since the seasons started and done all challenges but the NW ones. 
---
Lastly I unlocked the last 7-8 ranks with atoms just to unlock and put on the ghillie.
---
Lol I bought nearly 30 serums from a lvl 400 selling them at 50 caps each. I’ve sold over half of them at my vending machine for 400 caps each.
---
Capitalism is a beauty.
---
It seems to cycle the ammo he finds or something though. I'd get like 40 or so .45 out of it, then the next time I'd check it it would be different calibers, so I'd empty it and check it again later and there would be .45 in there again. Same with 5.56, though that was only in there the first time I checked it and no subsequent times. So its not perfect for always getting what you want, but its all ammo point fodder anyway, so its still handy.
---
I think you would find that there is karma today my fair fellow
---
Yup, has been happening to me quite a lot today, i got angry at first but going into the atom shop makes it go back to normal.
---
Yeah the game has a lot more bugs then other games. But you know what, all software does and will. I’m using programs that have been around for almost 40 years. They still bug out now and then. They still get updates that end up having bugs.
---
It really comes down to this. How much fun are you having, and how you react. I know people on PC have more bugs, and part if that is their systems and a lot of times mods they use for the game.
---
Computers and coding are man made things and will always be flawed. Everything we make is flawed and always be that way.
---
So as long as I find the fun more than the frustration, I’m not going to let myself become to salty over it. I can always go find something else. We live in an entertainment driven society so there’s literally hundreds of thousands of entertainment options to pursue.
---
😂 We've all been there!
---
Also uranium fever, tag every mole miner and scrap all there weapons. Get above 500 steel each time I do it. Also lots of black titanium
---
Lol still I'm at 4q and have only missed 1 days dailys (thanks auto complete) and am only at 41 haha. You must be doing some serious xp grinding. You're not far off from being done!
---
The xp only seems to go crazy when i use a full unyielding set.
---
\&gt;be douche
---
\&gt;breaks the T&amp;Cs
---
\&gt;gets banned
---
\&gt;gets salty
---
\&gt;double exp weekend which has been on the cards for ages
---
\&gt;"disgusting tactics"
---
Y'all ever tried not breaking T&amp;Cs?
---
Also, I haven't heard of anyone who hasn't duped **or modded their game** that has received a ban/suspension. I've been filling up my scrapbox with thousands of units of scrap from farming every single location I visit in preparation for cancelling FO1st, and I - like everyone else who has adhered to the T&amp;Cs - am fine.
---
Y'all wanna complain cos you did the videogame equivalent of getting kicked out of school before prom, that's fine. Just don't try to blame anyone but the dude looking back at you in the mirror. 👍🏻
---
yeah I play for the fun of it as well. Hence why I  named this particular ghoul Earl. I dont get frustrated at the game. I am not a tryhard. I don't exactly help new players well I do but not overly help(give them a god roll level 5 pipe and such) but if they need things i often supply them. Also I built the Ragin Rocket Diner at the Whitespring which is a diner and supply post xD. I like having fun.
---
I'd rather get a root canal. Thanks though.
---
I'd just wait. 99% chance you get crap. 100% chance you out level what ever you get in 5 levels
---
For me instead of relogging was just going to the atom shop right after getting the atoms and it worked, but if that doesn't work, sending a ticket might work (Considering this has been happening to a lot of people)
---
 165 isn’t a high lvl
---
Tbh with how bugged this game is he could have made the account this week and still reach lvl 1000
---
43. I am good :)
---
Yeah I have done about 200 levels spread over two characters. 
---
wWith lunchboxes, changes to carnivore and teams(building with strange in numbers) it have been no problem to get 10 levels a day with 4-5 hours of game play. 
---
All thanks to having vacation and shitty weather outside
---
I have my tent there so when people are on it I can move from under them.
---
OP you eventually get this resolved?
---
IMO it's the best version so far. Once we get (IF we get) a more reasonable and user friendly ammo converter ot is will be right on the money.
---
Wait for a purveyor sale
---
It could be 25% off;forsure or 30%; could incorrect and you can gather more in mean while.
---
Wait, save for when you are level 50. You will find something better almost immediately so keep it when weapons can only be max level.
---
&gt;all ammo point fodder anyway
---
This. 
---
If you want specific Ammo there is already the Ammo Generator. It would be wierd If it basically works the same.
---
I just let it build up and recyle. If it got Ammo I actually Need than thats a + for me.
---
I think its worth it for people like me who chew throug 5mm Ammo faster than I can farm it.
---
Yes wait. I can’t begin to tell you how sorry I was getting a .50 cal vampire explosive 10 levels under the item lvl cap. I miss that gun 😢
---
Helped me kill my first deathclaw in 76
---
It's pretty much a waste of time on any region, sometimes you can't repair him because the component is nowhere to be found, and sometimes he just gets stuck
---
True. But I actually expected the Brotherhood Collectron  for us to look for Ammo and Weapons.
---
Now Im really interested what he brings as a Option.
---
That's the commie Mother Lode that you can get access to from The Deep
---
Same for me.
---
It dosn't help me.Score at 0 when i going in to atom shop.
---
Good to see your enjoying it. It has definitely improved since release &amp; is slowly(sometimes too slowly) getting better.
---
As a nearly 3000 hour player, I do get bored sometimes &amp; take a couple of days off, but I purchased 4 copies of the game at launch with nil regrets. I &amp; one of my sons have definitely got our money's worth, as we play together a fair bit - even when I'm away at work.
---
The event group bonus only applies to the completion Exp. The Int. Boost of the Building Team will actually increase the general exp. you get.
---
*and* if you want to maximize your exp., know that if you are the group leader you can switch the group type without breaking bonds. That means you can be a building team during the event, switch to an events team just before the event finishes, and then switch back to a building team after the event is over.
---
Such a shame, try sending a ticket to the support team, hopefully they will give you the atoms that were not rewarded.
---
Bethesda already said they’re looking at redoing the ammo converter to make it easier to use. That said, I’ve got zero idea why they didn’t think people would want to do bulk.
---
They’re changing it, they’ve already announced it
---
I have also full set, but still it is somewhat weird.
---
dude has 17 subs and spend $200 to make money on youtube... well he'd have to pull in about 200000 views and get over 1000 subs to even qualify for the partner program, and then get another 100-300k to break even so no dude, he didn't make this video to make money lmao. real greeeat idea trying to make a video showing that he payed for this shit instead of playing the game, spending $200 on MTX will certainly get you that clout 🤣
---
im talking about RMT trading not real firearms you dolt....the type of person who spends $200 on a free season is the same type of person why spends $$$ on RMT ebay guns, thats just how it goes, they cant play the game, too lazy to grind or trade so they just pay some to do it for them. always someone to milk the cow i guess  🐄
---
was fun to read though, your comment is the exact type of brainwashed mental gymnastics that I lol at.
---
Oh when? Ive kinda been out of the loop.
---
Wait untill you're level 50, you don't want under-levelled stuff.
---
and good xp, i got the repeatable SCORE three times in one monster mash with the double xp going
---
I would wait.
---
I was here the other night, and it scared the crap out of me! A player made his camp right next to it, and I'd travelled there to see if he had anything decent for sale. Whilst looking through his vendor, I could hear the screaming but thought it was something in his camp, but as I came out, I could still hear the screaming! It was dark irl, and dark in the game, so it definitely creeped me out. I went over to the cabins, not knowing the screaming was coming from that place, and the ground began to shake and doors closing etc. Definitely spooky!!!
---
Wtf is this bug?
---
Not anymore, they nerfed the amount of experience glowing ghouls give you, and changed it so a 3* enemy is not a guaranteed 3* item drop, so few people bother nuking the area anymore.
---
This also means few people bother going anymore, and as another person already pointed put, it was a new character showing up that would trigger the constant enemy respawns.
---
Furious Primed LMG
---
When at the Queen did more the 4 get opened. 
---
4 is fine... it's the 5th that will cause the bug.
---
From playing it as it currently is in comparison to older reviews and videos, if they can keep this up and not botch the MT's they may actually build a steady player base + trust again. The community is super nice, and most devs for Bethesda are great too, it's just there's a couple noggins making very poor decisions it seems.
---
The structure of the world in Fallout 76 blew me away vs 4/NV. The detail and size is pretty impressive, though I can see how it'd felt empty and desolate without the NPC's.
---
It hit me again after the hot fix. I’m see the same number of posts about the issue, so I don’t think the hot fix worked at all.
---
Thank you.
---
riding shotgun has same bug with moleminers
---
there were originally SEVEN different vendor cap pools, it was a pain in the ass to get your caps before they put them all in the whitespring
---
Its a bug where u cant fast travel. U continuously try but it doesn't let u until it knows your about to rage.
---
I guess it’s 5 scrip ... greedy tho I’m carrying so much I’d of left it
---
Had like 10 people doing Uranium Fever today.
---
Each time the legendaries appeared, everybody would summon the others to it. The problem? One guy would always one-shot the legendary before anybody else got there. I managed to get 1 of the 3 drops as I tagged the mob before calling others, but I reckon most got none.
---
Yeah. My guns are breaking much faster lately.
---
&gt; At the end of the day, the idea for the legendary run was very well executed. 
---
Lol, what? Yeah, it was well executed for those in the marketing and financial department of Bethesda. Players got massively screwed over by this stuff, in case you haven't noticed.
---
Sounds fun has it been around awhile I don't think I've ever had it?
---
lazy people are better than people who ruin fun for others :C
---
I main a raider commando and still don’t sink to nabbing lowbie loot
---
I don't like Two-Shot in general, and on something that is as inaccurate as a .50 cal, I'd definitely stay away from it.
---
Explosive is good if your aim is tagging mobs for XP and loot. Damage-wise, it's not much of an upgrade from Final Word apart from the mass tagging - in fact on SBQ fights it's almost certainly worse. (As is Two-Shot.)
---
In fact, leaving out Junkie's and Bloodied, the only Legendary effects that will give you much of an improvement on damage will be Furious and Two-Shot+Explosive. And the latter incurs a hefty penalty in accuracy and weapon durability.
---
Free vending machine? :o I’ve never found one ... probably all picked clean by the vultures
---
Bloodied gauss shotgun charged
---
I don't think that's a team thing. It completes for everyone on the server. On my alt it popped up right when I just left the vault and only lvl2-3
---
It does it on my main too when I don't hear to the nuke zone right away. Good thing it really doesn't mean anything besides the nuke just hit
---
Absolutely!
---
And tbh alone the BE flamer was worth it.
---
But did he really needed to steal a shitty 1* ski sword that he’ll just trade for 5 measly scrips?
---
Frankly I don't give a damn about any lunchbox effect that isn't Confetti. Give me my birthday party. The only way it could be better is if they outright stole the "Yayyyy" from the Hall Grunt Birthday Party
---
bethesda ban waves = fake news 
---
bethesda only bans players who call other players a homo!
---
I flog my purified water 10 a pop, the machine’s making them are unlocked and directly hidden behind the house ;) they could just get em for free 😂
---
I plan on making a 2nd character JUST to make a haunted house trap camp. I haven't worked out all the details but basically it will have a revolving floor pla of 4 different layouts, to keep repeat visitors in their toes. There will be no constant internal lights, pressure plate jump scares using mounted heads, spot lights, sirens. Maybe a spring board trap to startle them too. Could tame a Deathclaw 
---
It will have a good and a bad end room, bad is a bait vendor and a pitfall, good is with either a free vendor, or a Nixie lamp code that they can give to me for a prize. Just wish there would be a way to alert me if someone dies or find the good room so I can reset/collect the loot.
---
I'm also considering a escape room camp using keypad doors and hidden codes in each room.
---
this ban method was automated, that means it picks up false positives so yeah people who dont really deserve a ban could get caught up in it. this has happened before in 2019. they did a ban wave so big that they had to do an UNban wave.
---
sure morons who duped on their mains will be salty on reddit, but that doesnt mean that there are NO people who got caught in the crossfire between the doopers and todd.
---
bethesda is incompetent with everything they do, this included doling out bans. this banwaves was NOT comprehensive either, it will do fuckall to combat dooping.
---
I've heard since launch, but i only started playing last june and have had it off and on since then but these past few updates especially waistelanders made it worse. Like to where u get it everytime you try to fast travel.
---
you are incorrect unfortunately
---
I’ve been getting 1363 zip from super mutants with 4 lunch boxes. Idk why yours is bugged.
---
It it goes to 5 then it breaks.
---
Tradings a good reason for a mic, but saying where you're going to drop an item if you don't want somebody else to steal it seems no different to just dropping it in front of them.
---
Its been mentioned in a q&amp;a on the official forum, you cab choose 10x and 100x and the score is getting a rise to 100k from 2k.
---
Thar change should come with update 21.
---
Same happened a few hours ago on the SBQ? It spawned and then it dropped dead on the floor without loot for anyone. Can SBQ be killed that fast even?
---
Ah yes, I've got that same bear in a snap. Luckily I saw it as I approached, went stealth mode in the bushes, brought out my camera, but that was enough to get the bears attention, took the pic as it was running at me, managed to run away with a mad scramble over the river and through the forest.
---
You don't mess with those bears.
---
Thanks !
---
Well, the drop comment was supposed come across as creepy, lets go behind this DIRTY SHED...
---
We need text chat ...
---
Dang, didn't know you could only get a fixer if you knew the plan. I saw one for 5k caps the other day and almost bought it just so I could try one and see what all the fuss is about.
---
Last levels needs more xp
---
I'm ok with the missiles now since I can turn them in at the ammo machine for 100 ammo points
---
I think these issues with lunchbox "debuffs" has something to do with double xp. I didn't experience any issues with somebody activating buffs up to 75% prior to it. The game might have one pool of %xp buffs from which it subtracts all excess buffs if it happens to be above 100% (or 125%). If the game makes a check for excess lunchbox buffs when you open one, then it might turn out so having 100%+ alrwady due to double xp might trigger the logic to subtract excess buffs instead of adding to the pool.
---
Why are you expecting everyone to have good stuff, i have a lot of stuff yet i dont sell it and only sell 1-4 things at ridiculous prices so i am on the map to hopefully aware people nuking  whitespring. I could be level 5 and selling tons of stims or level 1000 and not selling anything cause i dont want people at my camp cause they just leave all my doors open and once i was trading with a friend and some level 30 came and started taunting me cause i had the trade glitch and he wouldn't leave me alone then i came back on my level 170 character with a tesla, explosive lmg and hitting him and he back off straight away. maybe he did it just so people dont nuke his camp cause i do the same and dont expect things from people
---
I get it to!
---
Try a new character and build around the chainsaw :)
---
I can't believe I missed the joke... 
---
That's the second time in 24 hours now.
---
My bad, I seriously need to sleep more before using Reddit.
---
I had a level 5 3 star furious pipe revolver with 25% faster fire rate and 50 dr while aiming. I used it up until I hit 50.
---
How 2300xp??
---
It is very high compared to level 20
---
Last night had a naked blood eagle just standing vacant in the camp, I'd already slaughtered everyone else, I put it down to PTSD.
---
Gotta love those 3* nocturnal rolling pins with +1 perception
---
I have no idea how they got so high, it’s not that easy to do glitch on PS4? But you’d think someone in the 500-ish rank should have a few interesting pieces. Nope when you get to their camp you look at voice of set and all rise. I’ve seen this many many times.
---
Respeccing should cost 10 or 20 levels, not just 1. Or not be possible at all. In my opinion.
---
Well, I buy a single ammo/cheap item if the camp looks good. It is almost the same.
---
Yes just hop into my vertibird I have a legendary for you
---
has this been fixed yet?
---
I ❤️ my shottie , she very rarely let’s me down :)
---
I would be up for this. I also feel bad when someone sells stuff super cheap and can't find them to give them a tip
---
If they have been duping then I hope so.
---
That's cheap too. Cheapest I've seen is 6k and they logged off before I could buy it
---
Hi know a nice filthy shack far from the prying eyes of a cruel judgmental society you can take a nap in.
---
It's likely that they had to limit it as someone found an exploit in beta testing......
---
why ? you can hard cap the xp bonus maybe you get, but in an events team u get more xp itself from them so not pointless at all.
---
Why do you carry around 100 outfits????
---
Yeah, I don't give players things directly or drop them in front of them. When I encounter weapons mods in the world, I pick them up, I make low level versions of them attach the mod, and then drop them about the Flatwoods area. Sometimes armor. What I have done has changed over the course of the game. At first, I would run around Flatwoods and put in every single mailbox a stimpak, purified water, radx/away. So if someone checked all the mailboxes, they would get a nice amount of each. Then for a while it was a set of level 5 or 10 leather armor, all tricked out. 
---
Currently my camp is up the road from the Wayward near the Slocum's Joe and overlaps the persistent camp where NPCs can spawn. I will stick Welcome to the Wasteland packages in the tent for other players to find.
---
Im confused?
---
No cross play on fallout Sony refuses before so they ruled it out
---
Did something alike in line in the sand, someone tent bugged it so they all spawned at the turret, I just dropped a nuka nade on them at each spawn, solid 3000 ish exp each spawn.
---
I read this in Sidney Poitiers voice.
---
Been doing queens all day with success.
---
Even had instance where someone insta killer her.
---
Had no problem having enough people to do it with.
---
Its always wise to double check how many high levels are on your server before prepping and launching a nuke
---
Your vertibot looks like a windowless white van.
---
Quest awards are now, "oh no, what am I getting?" vs "yea! rewards!"
---
Wait this reply makes no sense. If there is a hard cap then building teams is pointless for me because I have 28 int,
---
I would be better off with the group event party. 
---
I’m just asking if there was a hard cap at 25 because that was the first time I ever heard of it from one guy on YouTube.
---
No, most server is filled by liw level players, GamePass released a few weeks ago. 
---
Your friends are banned? Did they duped anything last week, when the new dupeing method went public?
---
Explosive weapons/legendaries.
---
You could make way more bullets from that steel with minimal lead/gunpowder farming.
---
Yes freaking buggy tents
---
This is the same sort of bullshit that stopped me dropping stuff at Fasnacht. It was like dropping chips on a beach. The same people would swoop in and take everything. Greed is disgusting
---
The rule is there for a reason.
---
A while ago campfire tales spawned on a server but nobody went. It was a few minutes and I jumped over. I needed a drink, so I hopped on a roof and hid at the back crouching and invisible. I hadn't started the event yet but would when I got back. Looked like I would end up doing it solo, which is fine.
---
I came back to find 2 players shooting me with mini nukes and nades (doing no damage) and calling me nasty names on voice chat because I was afk. Being really abusive. Even after the event ended.
---
I guarantee players like that would make posts here and slap my username all over it. Then it would get several hundred upvotes, with some of those boted players trying to ruin my camp and escalating. No we shouldn't post usernames.
---
Yup sadly pretty much this. Since they can't make more money than they know what to do with out of the game, it's not worth putting any effort into. Super sad.
---
Join your filthy duping friends in exile!
---
If he's using Gamepass for PC, so he's playing on a PC, then you can play with him. All PC-based players share the same servers (Gamepass for PC, Bethesda and Steam are together)
---
If I didn't understand correctly, and one of you is playing on Xbox and the other on PC, then you can't play together. there is no crossplay.
---
*tries pushing padlock through paper bag ....’it rips a big hole’*🥺
---
Same thing happened last night. I *think* it was the level 800 that 1 shot the sheepsquatch and the rest of us stood around emoting.
---
I've heard rank 5 is broken, but not 1 to 4. I use rank4 and I FEEL like it slows it down but haven't tested it
---
I always thought higher levels would be the good guys; but this post, as well as a Uranium Fever experience last night where a level 150 ish just ran round finding the legendaries and massacring them before anyone else had a chance to get close, have been eye opening.
---
No melee weapons have any kind of area damage.
---
Ranged weapons can get the legendary explosice effect but that's as close as it gets.
---
An MMO term for a frontal AoE attack. Closest thing in this game, as someone else has pointed out, are legendary weapons with the explosive secondary effect.
---
I have a different noob question. Where do I turn them in? My old CAMP used to be next to Camden Park so I have a good number of tokens so far (that said, how many are needed anyway?)
---
The only thing I can think of is Raider Punk who has a mohawk. I think your friends may be pulling your leg personally.
---
I have a level 5 anti-armor, explosive pipe pistol I use for any low level grinding I have to do on new characters it's great.
---
Another feature by Bugthesda
---
Ahh ok
---
GW2 for sure and I think if it's still running, which it may not be, the secret world as well. Past that the other big MMO's like WoW and FFXIV only have voice acting for main stories I believe.
---
What for lol? Running Scarlet Monastery?
---
Do people actually buy water?  Even cheap that's kind of pointless
---
It'll pop up but you need someone in the area. Typically the northern forest will get it to trigger. Just head a bit up from vault 76.
---
Of course they did.
---
gauss riffle for snipe
---
gauss shotty for shotgunner
---
if you have high strength for the shotguns, you could invest in big buns pers too
---
if you have perception, you could also go for commando. its double xp so its a good time to get those perks or tweak your build.
---
There's a little building behind the vendor bot, which has a couple of terminals. You trade them in there, most of the prizes are just prices of junk; the Mr Fuzzy suit is 150, and headpiece is also 150 :)
---
I'm in the middle of that grind: just to cooperative with both as of yesterday. I think I have a long way to go: I remember grinding Outlands rep in WoW for that damn proto-drake mount...
---
I wish your Reddit accounts could get banned along with the game account. That would fix the other half of the problem
---
This. I wouldn't buy Ranks until the last day, and even then only if you have the cash to burn and It will unlock things you actually want.
---
I see that dam observant radstag all over the place!
---
47 here
---
This Is not true, there were a lot of hi.lvl player, Just not willing to play.
---
Yes, they did
---
I mean, it's possible but it's the same story every time. So many people claim they didn't do it.
---
disable pacifist.
---
friendly fire during the mayhem is a regular occurrence. players won't bother about it.
---
There is a legendary perk that does just that.
---
Dumb comment. Frustration lends to duping, and this game can cause frustration because it's structure Is bad
---
It's a nice event for sure but I think for high levels it's just not worth it most of the time since the 3 drops are always 1 stars, and best case scenario you get three weapons for 15 scrip. It's very nice for getting low level legendaries, but if you've got some decent gear for new characters it's hard to justify the time investment when you could just run west tek and have a good chance to run into a 3* legendary that can drop 1-3 star item and it might even be useful.
---
I’d like to know this too.
---
This was fixed in fo4 with a mod like 5 years ago. You would think that Bethesda would actually look at the nexus to see the popular mods people use and make an effort to replicate them. But, skyrim even still has the same completely garbage UI after 9 years when every person uses skyui.
---
that’s when you just take pacifist off and go to town on the guy
---
Bruh why did this amazing comment get downvoted to hell
---
Honestly, I don't need a tip jar. I put my stuff up for sale for reasonable prices. Very reasonable. And about at least once or twice a week, I have to go spend money, or I'll buy a mutation serum so I don't go over the 30k limit. Yesterday, I went from 12k to 27k in a single day, I couldn't go buy gold. I think the most expensive thing I had was just over 1k, but in general, everything else is not even close. 
---
I sell things that people want, and can find in the world for themselves. I've sold SOOOOOO much dog food. But also, things you can make, white russians, fasnacht donuts, sunshine oil. Anything that is consumable that doesn't spoil. And chems. You all are some serious junkies.
---
There is a mod on the nexus that does this.
---
Maybe if you do it on a private server. The amount of time it takes to launch and then sit around waiting for things to respawn, you could have run through white during a dozen times server hoping.
---
Also very curious about this since it's double xp weekend.
---
There also a special place in hell for high level players that empty both of your nukacola vending machines in one go.
---
Maybe i'm Just unlucky but there were a lot of High level players Just not willing to play. I personally asked
---
sounds pretty nice
---
Yea btw, if I have a character only for mule, this will be a stupid question I know, I don't have to put the items in the mule character stash, I can keep it on the character over-encumbered right?
---
The reason i am asking is because of a potential bug that may cause items on character to disappear or smth like this, you can never be too sure
---
Grinding XP on the current Double XP Weekend gave me quite a boost. I played yesterday a few hours and my SCORE is now rank 68. I think I will finish the Legendary Run earlier than expected.
---
It’s a great question, I thought I knew the answer but now I’m not certain. I was under the impression the cap for Int XP buff was 100. I run with about 43 Int, and will test this tonight by swapping a few points of Int around.
---
Can you get explosive melee weapons?
---
i believe this only doesnt work on sheepsquatchses, sheepsquatch imposters, scorchbeast queens and wendigo colossi, atleast i think those are the enemies you actually have to do a minimum amount of damage on
---
TS is the worst "good" prefix. If second bullet misses its only 62.5% dmg iirc , and it misses alot + guns break twice as fast
---
2 things.  1: most number crunchers didnt take into account that you start at level 1 not level 0 and that makes a big diff in the xp from 99 -&gt;100. 2: most did the math before Bethesda upper the number of dailies so dont loose hope 😁
---
Damn, that sucks but thank you.
---
TOS is there for a reason. Just because they are your friends does not give them immunity from the ban hammer. 
---
There is no reason to dupe what so ever since any bloody weapon can kill anything in one shot if you. Build around it. They don’t need a fixer to be effective.
---
You will find that the duper’s are still in your game as they will have throw away accounts to do the duping on
---
Yea yesterday some girl bought 10 of em so that’s 100 caps .... I don’t buy em tho
---
Pretty much the way  I got my first win
---
I’m a lvl 129 and I do this, for the legendary daily challenge but also because low levels don’t do it. I saw one group of low levels actually do it ... I helped them a bit and then went on my way. 
---
It could be that they’re afraid of events, being so new? Events were definitely hard for me as a solo player starting out, and this was at launch so things were really empty lol
---
No, there is no cap on the xp from intelligence ... you can get up to 63 intelligence (I think even more now, thanks to the double effect of the Carnivore mutation) [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ehzgqr/how\_to\_get\_up\_to\_63\_intelligence/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ehzgqr/how_to_get_up_to_63_intelligence/)
---
It all counts and gives you extra xp ... something like an additional 2% XP for every intelligence point
---
The only cap that I know of, is on how much you can get from a single kill or event completion. You can't get more than 4,000 XP from one kill, no matter what kind it is (even the SBQ gives only 4,000)
---
I don’t even know what they it.
---
But no, sword in Destiny 2 are my favorite weapons and I wanted to make a Titan build but apparently swords can’t Cleave which sucks.
---
People are seriously struggling with this one ????
---
What happens if you have 25k caps and sell an item for 10k? Is possible? Only adds 5k?
---
Awesome. When is Patch 22 supposed to come out?
---
Bugthesda feature
---
Hazmat suits should just work like power armor.
---
Back when I was a playing with heavy guns I used a missile launcher. It was a way for me to have an explosively good time without keeping track of my mini nukes.
---
Pff totally not my family
---
If have to ask its a problem
---
Alot of people right are doing line in the sand.
---
If its going one people won't go the queen unless the line in the sand is over
---
Actually, what's dumb is giving into the idea that you NEED certain armor and weapons to play the game and enjoy it. 
---
Frankly, I find those kind of players often SUUUUUCK the most at the game. First they need an uber weapon that sprays ammo all over the place, because they figure that's the best way to make sure you tag everything, and hopefully kill it. They ALWAYS need to be in PA, because they need to feel they are the most protected. 
---
When the Legendary run started, I saw level 240+ at all the low end events, like Tea Time. And they couldn't handle it. Why? Because they want to tag everything, so rather than cover one of three spots, they run all over the place, trying to "guess" where the creatures will come from. One pipe had 4 high level players on it. But that pipe also had the most damage at the end, about 15% left. And that's because me and my friend started to cover it as well. 
---
It's hilarious how much they suck. 
---
The game has issues no doubt. But sucky players always blame the game for how much they suck. Because they never, learn to actually play the game.
---
Join Line in the Sand with auto grenade launcher or M79, radiation rumble with Tesla rifle or combat shotgun, farm west tek n huntersville if u can
---
Should be around September
---
Yeah, there is always going to be dupers. Never said there won't be. Here's a newsflash for you.
---
There will always be people looking to hack games and profit off them. And all games are hackable eventually. They will find a way. If you know anyone that works in any kind of coding job, they will tell that no system is unhackable. That someone will always find a way.
---
Always.
---
Oof. Thank you.
---
There is no cap for bonus XP from Intelligence, but there is a cap for XP gain. You can only get up to 4000 XP from a single action - may it be a kill or event completion.
---
So if you are already stacking INT/XP buffs on the double XP weekend and/or use lunchboxes, then the events team bonus is somewhat pointless as you will hit the 4000 XP cap for event completion even without the team bonus.
---
Thats why there are now a lot more builder teams than before the double XP weekend.
---
They didn't have the will to play? "i don't have the will to play so i WILL play the game to dupe items" Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
---
what I am suppose to feel jealous or something ?😆
---
Tents building fences stop standing on shit.
---
Looking at where you are, you're probably going to have move soon. Or get constantly nuked, once the new event drops.
---
Assuming that is the case, everyone has to start somewhere, yet you still put them down.
---
Fair call on the guns comment though, I did jump to the wrong conclusion. My comment is still valid though, just off topic.
---
I don't see it as too lazy, just time poor with plenty of disposable income, not everyone has endless hours to spend on game. People have families, jobs, businesses and other responsibilites. Some people have time to grind, others don't have time to grind, but have the funds to take shortcuts. Both get to enjoy the fruits of their labour.
---
Mental gymnastics huh? I'm not sure you understand what that means. It implies that I am changing my position or opinion back and forth on something. No, I've been fairly consistent in my opinion. I believe that everyone has the right to play the game as they please. 
---
This is a mechanic that has been designed into the game as a way for Bethesda to make money. Bethesda needs to continue to make money to keep servers alive, pay staff and continue to create new content. So players like OP, Fallout 1st subscribers and players that buy Atoms are the real players keeping this game alive. Without them Betheada would have shut down the game as a failed project because it wasn't providing them any income.
---
I paid $100 three times for this game for my 2 platforms and my son, plus fallout first for around 9 months. I have done my fair share to help support this game and help grow it and fund it providing new content. I have over 2,500 hours on Xbox and 300 hours on PC. I have grinded more than most people can imagine. I am a true supporter of the game. 
---
Buying the game for $5 four months ago doesn't entitled you too put them down for how they play the game. You should be thankful for people like OP they are keeping the game alive.
---
Thanks. I was wondering since I saw someone who was discussing xp buffs mention a int cap.
---
He gets mad a LOT at me.
---
I'm on PS4. A couple days after the bans went out, I was on at 4 in the morning. There was a total of 18 camp vendors I could count. 18 out of 24 is a lot for 4 in the morning.
---
Yesterday, with double XP started, the servers were full. I had so many players at my camp, and went from 12k caps to 27k caps in about 4 hours of game play.
---
The servers aren't dead.
---
Can you use all 3 collectrons at once or no?
---
Not defending anyone but it was nice when wellgeared players join the Sbq fight , guess its back watching people swing their allmighty allrise and ferousus 56dmg hunting rifles for some time
---
Huntersville - West tek - server jump and repeat. Recomended events: Radiation rumble, Guided meditation, A violent night
---
I'm guilty of one shotting enemies at the guided meditation once. It was so annoying to constantly go back and forth fixing because people kept letting the ghouls get by them. Sometimes they didn't even see them  breaking shit while they waited for the next one to shoot. So, I pulled out my one shotter and VATSed, shot, VATSed, shot until the event was done. My side, the bridge side, and I jumped and got the center a couple times.
---
They were very mad, thumbs downs and kicked from the team but I kept shooting. 
---
That was the only time though
---
No only 1 at a Time but when you capture a Workshop you can place down 1 for each workshop you own.
---
Yeah maybe commando would be a good idea. I’ve got 10 levels built up just sitting there I haven’t picked any perks for.
---
Im hoping ammo bags and military grade ductape
---
Ok I was just wondering because that was the first time I heard of an int cap from someone discussing exp buffs on YouTube. Thx for the info.
---
I figured it was capped to 4k xp. I got that for killing a glowing behemoth yesterday while lunchboxed, then again later without the lunchbox so figured that must be the limit.
---
I use missiles.
---
Games should really offer a variety of color blind settings so that it changes things like UI and such making it possible for the color blind to enjoy the game without extra work. While it's work, i doubt it would be overly hard.
---
A lot of games are moving to yellow text because it helps people with dyslexia and has no effect on people's comprehension and retention if you aren't dyslexic.
---
That would actually be possible. Having the Option "Military Supply"
---
Getting Dog Dags, Ammo Bags Ductape, Radio Jammer,  Stealth Boys and other Utilitys.
---
Lets see and hope.
---
I'm grinding up a sizable lead. Aiming to be rank 50 by the end of the double exp weekend. Just to take it easy during the coming weeks. Maybe be able to miss a daily or two, ignore NW ones, and of course incase auto-complete strikes. But I can't imagine anyone grinding more than that and not ending up with a massive surplus of possible score.
---
Burrows is a good place as well.
---
None. I turn off all game music and have other audio set so I can hear enemies. Sometimes I'll put netflix on my phone. But since I almost exclusively play with my gf I usually just talk with her while playing since shes in the next room
---
Yea I was the same way until I found out explosives is just a waste of perks and I dropped everything and switched to pure heavy gunner.
---
Safeish. Even private servers crash occasionally but most of the time it's a pretty reliable means of transfer. Just don't move too much at once. I always make a habit of moving all toons to the same place first too to avoid fast travel issues.
---
Tip: Visit ash heap (Purveyor maybe) every day, but only go to Camden Park every 3rd day, and do all 3 dailies in one visit. It's a real time saver.
---
Why are you guys a little more humane?
---
Who the hell cares about duping, this Is a game not fk Wall street. This thread is about me that i lost people to play with, not about everyone joining the party and tell their opinion about duping, that's not a duping thread
---
Yeah solo play is very hard at times
---
No I feed my Ammo Convertor those!
---
My Quad barrel bloodied, faster fire rate, reduction weight rocket launcher does not agree with you, mate :D
---
I play with the same discord crew and due to world time zones it’s usually the same 5 or 6 people. If say 3 of us are in a group with 1 random &amp; one of the others cones online we will kick the rando so we are all together. Only other time I kick is if the person is not active/leaching at events for example.
---
The head is 300.
---
You're thinking of Death From Above, not the quest he's talking about.
---
So Australia gave refunds and deemed 76 unsuccessful because of a door-leaving-open epidemic 😷
---
I wish I knew this 290 hours ago lmaoo. Cheer though! It'll help me for the headpiece
---
If it makes you feel any better, there isn't any dialogue/holotapes during or after the quest that you get.
---
Thank you guys for telling me, I would've just kept wasting screws and nuclear material trying to unlock it. I've already wasted enough on Radium Rifles, but I still need that damn reflex sight. Unless that's a plan, too, in which case I'm going to be very upset at myself.
---
Never had a problem whe  placing tents, just loads of people firing rounds at her mid air not letting her land
---
Lazy people are the best you get to tag everything;)
---
Radiation Rumble with an explosive 50 cal or tesla rifle. Make sure you're in a building team.
---
this is why bethesda needs to bring back a morality system. no, not the rpg mechanic implemented in award winning games such as *Fallout 3* and *Fallout 3: With Cowboys*, but you know, ethics. strange as bethesda starting going morally gray, so vanished the morality system.
---
There is a cap of 1000 scrips, if nothing has changed.
---
\- do not spend your scrips until you would lost them over cap  
---
\- if you stuck in game and have no good weapon ( still, go just for 1\* or 2\* legendaries )  
---
It is better to save scrips for max lvl. But, do not expect wonders, there are .. well, many possibilities .. so you either are lucky or you stop play trying to get lucky :D
---
Well there not wrong us aussies actually got something right i suppose
---
4 or 5
---
Instigating suppressed sniper for taking out small groups or one shotting mobs during low level events.
---
AA 10mm submachine gun as my back up to my main at the bottom old this list.
---
Electrified civil war sword(cant remember the legendary bonuses)
---
Pump action suppressed two shot shotgun, which honestly does shit damage. I miss my combat shotgun.
---
And my fav weapon which gives me so much xp despite breaking so fast, a Twoshot Explosive Suppressed combat rifle.
---
Ah ok would you say am explosive laser rifle will do the job ?
---
37
---
It doesn't even have to be bloody. I have a furious fire axe. It does more damage with each hit, and also 40% more damage with power attacks, and +1 strength. I've been using that for over a 100 levels, because I've never gotten a single melee weapon better than that. And I don't even have all my perks for increased melee damage maxed out.
---
you need a quad drum one for lmg use, a normal one to handle as an AK, a short one with no stock for a AK-U, and then a semi auto sniper one as a dragunov ofcourse.
---
There is a bug to get the rep up in about 30 minutes.
---
Just Google raider rep bug. This could get you banned, but I don't think it will. I didn't got me banned and is still in the game since wastelanders release.
---
omg this is gold 👌
---
mental gymnastics isnt changing positions lmao, its coming up with every excuse and making long winded justifications for obviously shit takes.
---
the mechanic is designed to milk people who lack impose control, and i guess it works. bethesda gets to make bank on assets they made years ago because chumps will pay.
---
i could understand the time poor element but.. OP didnt even try to finish one rank, that would have taken 5 min tops. if you cant even devote 5 min to the game then whats the point at all? this isnt playing the game, its literally paying to NOT play the game, it pathetic and i think it hilarious.
---
yeah bethesda needs to make money, and they sure will, they have fans that will PAY for FREE content, its fucking amazing, they could sell an actual piece of shit in the atom shop, that doesnt work and then bricks your PC, and people would by it and then come shill on reddit.
---
Wow semantics sorry bro
---
“Crippled” is like the N-word? You are a parody of yourself.
---
So they duped, and got banned. I do not see any problem with this.
---
I used to do this daily myself, but I also looted the entire park. Took about 30 minutes every day. My scrap box has tons of raw materials now, so I've managed to curb my looting habit, a little bit.
---
Plot twist - lou gets shot in the head and becomes courier 6.
---
If only.
---
"roleplaying a raider" is the shittiest excuse for being an asshole to other players...
---
My camp is in flatwoods so I get so many newbies 4unning through my camp leaving doors open and REPEATEDLY turning on my Rad shower cuz they don't understand what it does.
---
uff. that is sad. thanks. I will try to get a bloodied version. 
---
I thought it works as intended bcz of numbers I see.
---
I heard the chemist perk counts with smelting ore, can anyone confirm?
---
It literally says "in any mode"...
---
I mean for the mini gun. I've found crafting ultracite rounds for it to be more manageable personally.
---

---
See for yourself!
---
You lost duper friends. So, thats why you lost them.
---
I just recently hit level 100 (woo, 3 digits) and can honestly say after having it happen to me so many times sometimes I just instinctively kill the legendary since doing it back in double digits it just became a habit.
---
I dont have all the legendaries I need, still trying to get my armour set and weapon but tend to just skip trying to get them from events at all and just do my normal route. Even on xbox (while there is less people like this) you still run into them. 
---
Just because you're in the triple digits doesnt mean every legendary belongs to you. 
---
Kudos to OP for trying
---
You see the reason why im getting pissed ? This is why i have my base with no vendors
---
You’re an idiot
---
Should be fine to keep him overweight
---
But that's only four, and there's like six skins plus the default. Need moar handmades.
---
Personally, I carry five and I'm thinking about adding a Vampire's to the mix.
---
2300?! I had a lunchbox, brain soup and cobbler, full  int group, sheilded lining vault suit, egghead, well rested,  3 star inspirational, mothman buff when I can get it and 12 in int but only getting between 1100 to 1500 per lv 68 one. How did you bump it up even more?
---
As long as the server doesn’t crash it’s fine. Just make sure everyone is at the same location. I normally use a cigarette machine at one of the stations.
---
Level 42 im on track.
---
Did it twice today.
---
Am I right in saying the SBQ will spawn from any fissure site that is nuked? If so, ain't there a better spot with a more open and flat fighting stage? Wouldn't that solve a lot of the problems. We all agree on a safe distance to drop tents and such and experiment with the other sites. I've only seen the lower right and whitesprings hit
---
yeah, completing missile countdown gives the heavy explosive ammo so watch out for them. I wish it could give us ammo we actually use
---
I'm not making excuses for these dicks. That said, there are companies that sell the legendary game items to people via websites. I was curious, I had a look, you can get anything in the game for real money, which BTW, I did not do. These asshats taking stuff you dropped for others may very well work for these companies and they are trying to make their quota, or whatever.
---
I use the ice machine at purveyor
---
Line in the sand the big that all mobs spawn in the middle wauw that was quick grinding xp.
---
lmao imagine being this lazy, spending $200 on atoms just to not play the game.
---
bethesda out here whaling 🐳
---
I think some people just dont understand that their Troubleshooter's bolt action pipe pistol isnt worth a damn
---
Well you get planter plots right away and the rest of the rewards are meh.
---
Shouldn't matter, you're not trying to kill stuff, only tag it. Anything that has the explosive effect is good, better if you don't kill them outright in events so others can tag too.
---
it's a christmas tree skin
---
I levelled up 7 times last night, was mental lol joined a building group with 4 people and just did a few events plus white springs, west tek, the burrows and Charleston interior. Oh also 2 SBQ events too. Loaded up with well rested, played an instrument, leader bobble head and used the lunch boxes too.
---
Ah ok 👌 I usually play on my private anyway so ill go ham with it
---
It’s a Bethesda thing.
---
Happens in Skyrim with Dragons too.
---
Usually happens when you fast travel with that specific thing near by.
---
Oh so you got some of those bobble heads
---
According to Bethesda the upped quantity of dailies is temporary until the 20th and it will go back to seven per day.
---
Yeah been saving them for the double XP
---
I understand but I made my camp and chose its location because I wanted people to find it easily. So all in all it's worth a little annoyance.
---
I don't know about others, but I don't mind missing out on caps. I price everything at my camp under 50 caps even if it's rare plans. Just want everyone to have fun and make things more accessible for newer players! 👍
---
Same here
---
Ugh gross.
---
I just run lunchbox cranberry and well rested
---
It is but you would think people have sense to close doors
---
Lots of posts like this for different ideas.  Personally I’d just like them to fix things like adrenaline and the fast travel bugs.
---
Thats all well and good, but doesnt explain why the hell she flies off 2 seconds after landing. That is WAY more infuriating to me then her flying around for a few minutes. 
---
What makes it even worse is her being on the ground for 2 seconds still brings out the million ANNOYING enemies coming at you. (im talking the stupid small things that are annoying to kill cus they move around you by the time my minigun has span up)
---
You know there is more than one server going at a time, right?
---
Ye that's what i thought. I've seen many ultracite ammo plans yielding more and only getting a few extra ingredients than their regular counterparts so i assumed the same goes for gauss mini(still grinding rep). 
---
Since I use the ultracite gatling, i could alternate between that, primed version and a primed gauss minigun.
---
Double score for the primed ultracite gatling as I can craft ultracite fusion cores with nearly empty regular fusion cores. Can't do that with the rest of the ammo, except maybe the plasma cores. No issues with ammo then except the flux
---
I just figure that newbies might think doors close automatically after a while.
---
Tip: For all creatures that pop-up from underground, walk backwards, gun drawn, ready to fire. They will pop up in front of you.
---
I saw some lvl 1600 players few days ago. And a lvl 800 something player in NW. All seems legit 😂
---
Yes, it made todays NW challenge a lot easier.
---
There is that but thats why now my camp is just a giant platform off seneca rocks
---
Agreed, but you they seem to go back and forth between fixing and creating.
---
I would like them to add mass crafting. Cooking individual meat is a pain.
---
Yes that is why those who could help I'll be willing to give them my gamertag so that they can join me and my friend.
---
Thanks for the info!!
---
Each int gives +2% XP. Your source is outdated.
---
Again agreed and I’d like power armour stands. But before all that. Fix what’s in the game already.
---
Not sure if troll, if you missed it last month or you just love the repetitive nature of that event
---
I think friendly fire is disabled in events. Am I wrong? 
---
I always go full metal monkey during events. Shooting at everything that moves. A I never gets pop up that says I am shooting a other player. Before the event is done.
---
I've set up turrets for my little guy
---
Yeah, I was going to say this. As soon as i get up on a small roof shed, the Yao Guai run off straight away. Shame, cus their stagger ability is ridiculous.
---
Wait.... this game doesn't have fucking text chat? I subbed here before the game ever came out and have since refused to play it so I don't have any hands on experience with it. That's absolutely baffling though. I would think that the least they could do is have basic mmo features considering that they've apparently botched almost everything else!
---
Exactly that. I have a lot of very nice weapons and armour but all for trade. My vendor has flux in it when I need caps. That’s it
---
Side note since your camp is there. can the Eye of Ra be found on the body there even if you haven't started the quest? And is it a one time loot of can I get multiples?
---
Im allies with both and im tired of those events...
---
You get less spawns in events when you're solo, I'd honestly switch to public for the weekend if I were you, jump on your private occasionally as part of the server hop for west tek and such, but sticking to private only will severely limit the XP can you earn.
---
I was wondering the same...I have a small one story house and two sheds and that's me at my limit
---
Wait theres a body ? Oh god what did santa tron do !?
---
I'm up for it. And I don't even like girls in that way!
---
Same. At the start I dropped spare masks &amp; plans so people who didn't have them could pick them up. The paper bag would get checked by various people but not emptied straight away, seemed like people were just taking what they didn't already have. Then vendors got re-enabled, and suddenly every high-level player nearby would be sprinting for any paper bag they saw, so I got disillusioned and stopped doing it.
---
lol, same thing happened to me. Apparantly the result of some bug that bethesda introduced and then fixed. You wont get banned.
---
😂 That's what I done but on my main account. There was a glitch way back where any challenge gave you the normal rewards of atoms but also perk card packs. It's totally fine
---
The unlocks are a glitch that been going on since patch 20. So no worries. Not sure about all the unopened packs but it's not like you did anything so again, no worries.
---
i mean, the season has actual things that effect gameplay, perks, caps, scrip, gold repair kits, scrap kits... literally things you get from all of the core gameplay.
---
the whole "ItS NoT pAy ToO WIn BeCauSE no WIn" line is BS, if you are buying thing that effect gameplay, thats what P2W means.
---
That was fun i never had so fast 10k xp
---
So she wasn't landing even when you were the only one fighting her?   This is often put down to players perching on fences/tents or people shooting her in the air.   Did you do either of those things?  
---
This is important, because if you weren't and she still wasn't landing, then it never was the two behaviors mentioned above, and the SBQ herself is a mess now.
---
My blood is boiling reading this shit.
---
Put on can do and run around the Whitespring searching all the trash cans, I get food like this all the time, doesn't spoil and fills hunger pretty well.
---
Didn't they fix this stuff like 3 days ago?
---
Ammo construction machine  
---
then the gauss minigun
---
Do you think it's wise to have a chameleon piece or full unyielding is generally better? Thanks.
---
ok thx^^
---
&gt; SBQ and Radiation Rumble can wipe out a stash like that no problem
---
If you and your team members are not blooded builds then you should try combination of sharing Ghoulish and Rad Sponge perk cards. Our party has been using this combination since Vault 94 raids. Even level 2 cards are enough. We've forgot about stims. Yesterday I realised I've over 2k stimpacks.
---
At least he (new guy) didn’t die during the immediate aftermath of the event, the over leveled guy definitely would of taken his stuff
---
It did feel snarky. Scorched Earth is literally the end game. It doesnt say much for Bethesda and this game if your saying, if the only reason your playing, is to play the end game then take a break.
---
I mean good for you that your finding random things to enjoy in it though.
---
Yeah pro tip, when you Google stuff go to search tool and do results from last week or month. Filters out the outdated results.
---
i just saw that its not moddable at all which is a bit sad bcuz it could be such a cool weapon to use
---
Hahahaha
---
I dont do this event. I do events where i can get 10k+ experience and get a chance to obtain high level legendary item or scrap a lot of stuff.  And my build is a heavy stealth/heavy/stealth. While u r go to clean nuked whitespring golf club wearing stealth suit there is 0 reazon to share enemies bcz they will kill u. So u need to oneshot everything bcz u know.. players can loot u. What i tried to say that shit happens by accident and "use less OP gun" is what 10 lvl could say. tonight I nuked 3 times and in the 2nd SBQ event started by me she was killed in a matter of seconds just by one guy. No one could loot her as I saw a lot of thumbs down. So I know exactly what players can feel about this kind of situation.
---
I've heard it's because people are on top of the tents
---
No idea? You do know there's 3 different ways they can do a full ban for mule accounts, the best example would be an HID ban, bans the hardware Id so you can't play on that console or pc anymore, and the fact that you don't understand how easy it is to pull a static up just means that over 500 people probably have yours...
---
For pvp a chameleon piece is nice. For pve full unyielding is best
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Ra
---
Should be right next to your camp. Would love confirmation before I trek out there. The brooch has it's own unique apparel slot on the chest, like the 2 rings share the hand slot.
---
Omg in your case i would be scared now to get banned, as Bethesta might think you entered a cheat Code 😂
---
Things like this make me wished I played still just so I could get high level and destroy people
---
Oh okay well im not on right but when im back I’ll look for it for you
---
I don't do pvp at all but thought chameleon would make you less likely to get detected when in close range.
---
Why he gotta be a pothead why can't he be a football player man 😂😂
---
Exp Bonus is real bro. Int food int chems int gear building Team double XP Weekend. Be careful you might level up by killing a Mole Rat
---
I run a full uny set and can move around West tek with out them noticing. Like they at eon top of me while I shoot them and they can't find me
---
No worries. I appreciate it
---
Really?
---
\*makes instigating pumpgun noises
---
just a tumbledown shack and it's built way back, about twenty-five feet from the railroad track?
---
I watched that same video. He is incorrect.
---
Are you saying despite the announcement of a hotfix for both the dupe and godmode issues, that people are still able to perform them? Asking seriously, haven't heard anything about it since the ban wave and hotfix.
---
What quarantine? 🧐
---
There is no cap on int giving you XP. The only cap is a Max of 4000 from any single kill or event.
---
I stopped doing it for so long because of it being broken. Out of the last 20 or so I've done I reckon its only effed up once. Which is nice.
---
I’m fairly new to the game and honestly it’s got one of the best communities in an online game like this that I’ve personally come across. Almost every player I bump into we say hello sometimes exchange some bits and bobs, a guy gave me the t51b jet pack plans yesterday out of nowhere. People like this honestly suck ass
---
I only join teams to fast travel for free 😂
---
I used to do that and still no sales. Now I sell PA-plans for 25 except jet pack and some more for 50. The ultracite armor parts are 10 caps each. Now I finally sell some. Still just low levels finding me in Whitesprings. All high levels have too many of those from the queen anyway.
---
Happened everytime I dropped fasnacht masks at the end of the event
---
Yes. They are still just as live as they were.
---
The exact thing happened to me and my GF on PS4 whom I have cauxed into playing with me ( she actually enjoys it alot ). Joining events with level 120+ with top tier weapons is hard work, no wonder people buy 1st just for the private worlds. But this is the Appalachian wasteland, there are people out there worse than any raider you may come across. It is bound to happen at some point.
---
Im sitting in a Bar drinking my beer. Quarantine was back in march bro... Or Well i guess if you live in trumpleton you still have a bad time im sorry for you.
---
I glitched the raider rep. I've literally only touched upon neighbourly with foundation. I did finish wastelanders when I was like level 100 on my main tho. I'm 165 now
---
there's another comment on this thread stressing your issue, in summary it's to do with the old engine/enemy AI having a bad time seeing you
---
This is the same as all the level 200+ who rush the sloth in Fasnacht. Don’t be those guys
---
Ah good times and good memories!
---
They have proximity voice chat, which is a much simpler system. If only people knew how to use a fucking mic
---
Did the same thing. Pretty happy with the results but man placing that foundation so that it's level with the ground can be a real pain.
---
Fine fine. "Hey, TightEnd_Beta, here I have something to give you." 
---
Better? Or maybe WideReciever_69?
---
It was too good to be true LOL.  Personally not worried about finishing at 100 but I'm sure it's going to bug plenty of completionists out there.
---
That makes perfect sense, so it is kind of dumb luck which presumes NW has few enough players to make that happen frequently.
---
I thought I could do this using the in game social menu, that was my mistake.
---
My issue is I have no friends playing FO76 but I do have two accounts and can just about run two clients on my oldish PC temporarily and was thinking I could join up with the spare mule after my main was in the game hiding in a bush, realise this is not possible now.
---
FUCK BATHESDA AND THEIR BROKEN PEACES OF SHIT GAMES AND THE MUGS THAT PLAY THEM AND PAY FOR FALLOUT 1ST!!!!
---
I just got 6k for doing queen of the hunt, same yesterday for scorched earth.
---
Thank you for the info. I’ll share with those I know
---
Lol I was mainly joking 😂 imma pot head i use to play and we found dicks and quickly realized we didn't want to be that type of player and tried to help when we could and defended what we could. We quit playing due to the game crashing so damn much.
---
Mmmm! 😜😘cookies 👍🍪
---
It is the best team for xp gains, but few players know it
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ems9lm/low_on_caps_heres_a_new_strategy_to_farm_2k_caps/
---
Nukashine is my byatch
---
Enjoy it, it will be fixed next patch
---
Shhh just let people forget about the burrows
---
and still no fix for enemies regenerating their health after being hit
---
Yea it’s disabled but sometimes you get those people who somehow didn’t join in and friendly fire won’t work on them
---
I never rly care whos on my public teams and dont kick anyone. The only exception is, when i run a public team with friends. If im there with two of my guys already and i want to make room for a third friend who just logged in, then sry pal but the random gotta go.
---
Id Be more happy if I could at least use the scrapbox and survival tent on the steam side with the fo 1st bethesda membership.
---
Have both characters in the same location to limit fast travel crashes as well.
---
Ok like most ammo then.  I sell most of my ammo for 1 cap anyways.  For the materials though I do think shotgun ammo, .45, .556 should be 2 caps.
---
But sometimes they don't sell at that so I guess the market decides.  A lead run and lucky mine run can make enough for 2k caps.  But really not worth it.  Hence why I like to clear .50 or 5mm.
---
Thanks for the input though.  Ill set mine to 1 cap to see how it goes.
---
Yes... the moment you get in the elevator
---
Luckily i live in switzerland 🇨🇭🥳 never stopped working, never had to wear a mask, never was forced to stay at home and luckily no one of my friends or family got in contact with that virus
---
This is why we need loot accessible to anyone participating in the event.
---
Ya that’s actually something I shouldn’t discuss.
---
I thought BGS said they weren’t going to take them away? (Just clarifying, as I think it’s already fixed to not add more of them.)
---
"deleting legacies from the game" those items were there from day 1 , game has already 2years and theyre extremly rare, also with bloodied build u can 1shot everything too, so that solution is just bad as it sounds, u could use that solution on duping too. Delete display cases/vendors and blah blah
---
well thats kinda sad but not unexpected I guess
---
They won’t take the rewards u earned, but this bug will be fixed in next patch so u won’t earn those rewards anymore after that
---
Had to rip my entire roof and first floor apart since the game wouldn't let me place a roof-tile over the staircase, even thought it was green :/
---
I know i will be downvoted so Hard but:
---
Does anyone know a Person first grade who actually had this Virus?
---
As me and my friends and family and their family and friends don't know such i Person. The only Thing i Heard of it was in the news but Not in rl
---
I wouldn’t have much a problem with legacy if they were just that. legacy. Dupes make these legacy items way to abundant and they won’t stop appearing.
---
No. That is just what people on here want you to believe. 
---
Believe it or not, most players don’t exploit games. It’s a false narrative. 
---
It’s a fact the game has been flooded with new players ever since game pass.
---
More this. I shifted hundreds of Mr Fuzzy tokens around and never lost any but did it 3 and 6 at a time to be cautious.
---
With patch 21 (hopefully) legendary perks will come. One of these is cleave. You're welcome.
---
Yeah. I don’t see why they had to patch out the flamethrower trap glitch where you could destroy a built item and place another inside and repair the first one making it sit inside.
---
That had enormous potential.
---
You don’t have to push those buttons in the first place. And you can still launch a nuke. You can still do all of that.
---
What does it say under your main tab in ‘Data’?
---
Proximity voice chat is great for players that want to use that. I personally hate having to mute strangers who can't turn off their music or figure out how to not yell every single thing they say, so I'm personally not a fan. Guess that doesn't matter though since I have no intention of ever touching this game.
---
Maybe you were banned? check your email just in case
---
That also helps my point, actually. Being bloodied you can still one shot most enemies with a decent weapon, so why are legacies even needed? Why are they desired? People are saying they are destroying the economy with them being duped since they’re so sought after, so doing away with them would help the economy as well.
---
You will have to drop the nuke yourself  for it to count (unless they fixed that) if you are on xbox use the LFG and ask for help launching first nuke for the ques and people will help  otherwise ask players in your current server.
---
Can someone tell me how I can easily launch a nuke? I’m level 129 and for some reason I have trouble launching a nuke cus I get killed by the robots easily especially with the assaultrons
---
Int does give bonus xp. I'm running with 42 Int with rest/food buffs etc etc.. And getting close to 2k xp from super mutants and 4k from scorchbeasts.
---
Honestly it feels a bit slow compared to other places. But because no one goes there its always got enemies in it.
---
If Bethesda was able to focus on putting out actual game content instead of bouncing back and forth between constantly combatting dupers and putting out profit fueled updates to lessen pay outs, then new weapons could be an easily viable new piece of content.
---
how the fuck do you build a 4 foundation base that is moveable???
---
We already had this available. It was part of an Atoms Bundle. It is unlikely to become a standard Atomic Shop purchase.
---
People who are trying to make 10mm guns and probably the smg work. They are terrible. They can be alright at the start
---
Nice. Will they be raising our Perk Points too? My build already utilizes all my perk points.
---
No intention of ever touching it yet you follow the sub and occasionally browse through it? You’re just as weird as you claim the game is
---
What was that again? Only cosmetic items in the atomic shop? My, oh my. How times have changed.
---
Then just bring out the bundle (again)
---
My ts ffr cryo litterally kills me in under a frame if im not burst firing
---
Both my character are still stuck at mumbles after the last script sale. I just log in when I have a chance, script 3 legendaries and wait for the next chance I can have 5 min to login and script. If I can login tonight I should be able to fast travel tomorrow and get a good session in.
---
It happens because energy weapons are bugged and the goo/ash piles break the spawns.  You get naked/unkillable/unlootable enemies after the piles despawn.
---
I use carnivore and only pick up the meat from animals if I need to sell to get my 1400 cap daily. It's much easier to launch a nuke once a month or so, and just hold onto the ionized meat. It never goes bad, and with the grocers backpack, weight very little.
---
I'm not sure how to understand that question, but legendary perks will be seperate from your normal perks. There will also be legendary s.p.e.c.i.a.l. perks, which boost your s.p.e.c.i.a.l. from +1 to +4( [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks/legendary-strength](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks/legendary-strength) )
---
Same. I had a bunch of excess ammo, Radaway, Rad-X abf other little goodies and a level 50+ just taking everything even though the sign said "Free for Players below Lvl 20"
---
Yes same here. With enough xp bonuses you hit the 4k xp cap per mob.
---
IIRC, it was advertised as a limited time exclusive. If so, that could be problematic.
---
If im close enough to boop her snout with my gauntlet you shouldn't be that close. Im strafing to get closer to her head which will let me deal more damage.
---
Lol, nobody cares that you lost your duping friends
---
That youtuber is wrong. And spreading false information. And an idiot. There is no cap to int.
---
Oh you can buy tiers like MTG:Arena pass and stuff?
---
Bloodied Fixers have been duped to holy hell.  If they just removed all items from the game that are OP or have been duped we'd all be running around with nocturnal lead pipes.
---
If only the actual trading system wasn't so unintuitive then we could use that.
---
Oh I don't claim this game is weird. What I do claim is that based on the posts here the game is an absolute shit show, and every single person putting money in to it is responsible for sending Bethesda the message that they can get away with these products. If that statement pisses people off then so be it. The negative internet points they give me won't exactly ruin my day. 
---
If you look at my original comment you'll see that I subbed before the game came out, and this post happened to be on my front page as I was scrolling through reddit this morning. Not sure why I haven't unsubbed before today, but I can assure you that has been remedied.
---
Exactly this.  Im a huge believer in accessibility in modern gaming.  Even those terminals (looking at you ammo convertor) only take up 1/6 of the screen.  
---
You have to really close sometimes to see it.  Often reading them gives eyestrain.  Games should be as accessible as possible, and for everyone.
---
I also have a vending machine with free stuff for low level. I wonder how much that high level must suck at the game if they need all of it.
---
Thats awesome! Ty mate.
---
Im on level 44 atm and thought im way behind.
---
People need to stop shooting at her while she is in the air too
---
No there plan is to go back to 7 dailies starting jul 20th
---
I’m referring to the 15 Strength, AGI, Intellect, etc.
---
I wanna max them all out, lol, not a fan of limitations.
---
But if they’re gonna be separate perks than that’ll be fine. Have to wait and find out.
---
I agree. I just thought it was weird with this one on how mucb hype it got when it came out, but then they skipped it for the Wendigo colossus (which is only a taxidermy stand, but its the thought)
---
I wonder what part of Grafton they would put up, would it be an arm like the Mirelurk queen? I want the Flatwoods monster as a taxidermy thing so its the whole body preferably, or else it might just look like that animatronic head in van lowes basement.
---
No need to be a dick about it :/
---
Awesome! Thank you!
---
There are always “limited time” items yet they’re always brought back.
---
But we were friends in the fault. Are you still mad about the indecent? I thought we got past it, I'm sorry I just don't like you that way.
---
41/42 not sure if I ranked after finishing NW challenge cuz I just logged off as soon as I leveled up in nw.
---
Bloodied players who rely on the bonus health + Speed Demon effect need to move to stay alive.
---
4 boxes stack just fine.
---
We just had one, next one will be months from now.
---
Do all 3 "power up "x" power plants, the first one you'll receive the medium generator, the second the large, and the last one you'll get the fusion generator, and I can confirm I just did this yesterday to get the plan for it
---
On PC you can probably already shift colour away from red/green/other hues using Nvidia Freestyle or Reshade.
---
Really disheartening. People quickly forget how they were once newbies.
---
I'm full health... never get it.  My brother is bloodied... happens a lot to him
---
If you want a good weapon for now just spend it, you can get 200 scrip a day anyway it's not a big deal.
---
Everything is bugged
---
Arent we past this point already. This isnt new but also what the Community wanted.
---
Camp items with a Purpose. Non items you get by this are tied to this Camp item, everything is obtainable in Game.
---
The Collectron stations are priced at 500 Atoms which a FRESH-Out-of-the-Vault Player actually shouldnt have much problem to obtain.
---
In terms of obtainable ATOMs In-Game I have to say you get the fairly easy. Although with the ATOM Dailys and Weeklys you could earn more, with the new SCORE Rewards I managed to get 1000 Atoms by now wich will get you The Collectron 2x times already.
---
I would prefered it to make these type of things relsated as a Quest Reward - I can see that these Monetazations are not the Choice of the Designers, but rather the Publishers.
---
I have 2 characters at lvl 350-400 and 2 more in the 250's.  It is doable without cheating.  But, at this point in the game, vending doesn't really interest me in the slightest.  I don't need the caps and I already have most of the weapons in the game that I want.  If I set the prices to 0 caps to give stuff to people who need it, azzhat high levels just come and take it all.  I'd rather drop it in a train station suitcase somewhere.
---
Endless? Yes. But also expensive as both, the display and the item take up camp budget. Better solution would be to make scrap items craftable as static items.
---
"pushes away veteran dedicated players" let me help you with that " bans players who dupe/exploits/cheat".
---
I think it’s to do with how it determines if you’re taking damage etc
---
Patch 22?!?!?!?They said 20 at first, I thought it was gonna be 21 but now 22? What, except buying time to get more money, could POSSIBLY take them so long?
---
Then, at least try to avoid stepping in front of us heavy gunners cause my be gat plas kills me in like a tenth of a second.
---
Since explosive laser weapons are meta right now who cares?!
---
I dont see anybody complaining about explosive flamethrowers shoot ballistic rounds. So ballistic rounds even fit into fueltanks.
---
Seriously. How does someone have the budget for all of this? One house and I’m at max.
---
I HATE when people run directly infront of me when im in VATS shooting the queen and just fucking stand there. Not only have you canceled my VATS but now i have to move to rengage her. Have a little consideration man..... 
---
9/10 times ita some dude in PA with a heavy gun....
---
When they fix it and she start do normal landing this event end sooner then you fast travel there.
---
I would have preferred your solution too, but oh well, publishers gotta publish(milk their cash-cow dry)
---
I'm not standing close, yet there is still some oblivious power armor user strafing back and forth while firing their handmade getting my entire be heavy group killed.
---
Cursed_meatball
---
sounds like a you problem, get more hp noob
---
So it's a random fact that I'm doing high level events basically solo?
---
I enjoy it up until the moment I have to deal with the Frogs Legs Grenade Spam Fun Times Extravaganza. Then, not so much.
---
can confirm this
---
I feel that so hard. However, in my experience it's usually some rando using a handmade that stands in front of me.
---
The SBQ can walk on tents all day long bro. I've seen it many times.
---
Unless we're talking the floating tent glitch then yeah, that's fucked.
---
1) i believe so
---
2)yes
---
3)no
---
I’m only talking about the legacies, the explosive energies. I didn’t consider the bloodied fixers to be legacies. I think those are fine even though yes they have been duped to hell and back but it’s too late for them.
---
Same here.
---
Nothing better than an ice cold legendary
---
I would doubt it would be back. None of the atom bundles have been brought back. But, you never know.
---
does not work. i have tried that and many other tricks people have said worked. it's not consistent, just buggy
---
But ur still missing the head! So ur journey is not over jet...
---
Happy grinding! If ur on PC make me an offer and maybe we can figure something out.
---
1: Yes
---
2: No
---
3: Yes
---
4: No
---
You are transferring you Saved Account data.
---
Everything you currently own/acquired will transfer.
---
The Legendary Run is a part of your data and so is your scrap stash.
---
Gigabyte... sounds like you are missing RAM.
---
Unfortunately there’s some punk bitches in Appalachia.
---
I thinl everyone should know where to draw the line.
---
Getting ATOM's this "frequently" is a nice. I hate Games deep down that have in-game ONLY Purchase currencys. Atleast with ATOMS you can get them by Playing and in a fairly frequent manner.
---
Now Things like Fallout 1st - is a disgrace for the Commumity, and everyone Supporting this Tactic doesnt know what harm they are doing to the Community.
---
Paying 500 ATOMs for a low Ammo Generator, is not what I hoped but what I got and I guess with them handy out ATOMs they do we can agree on something here.
---
Paying 100 Bucks a Year for in game unlimited Space of Stash. THAT is truly just milking the community and not acceptable in any way shape or form.
---
Question though (no offense intended). Why do you use explosive weapons vs the queen,even legacy. She  dont take dick for explosive damage. Pretty much just using a 1* weapon that breaks faster. 
---
Bu much better off with a FFR or 10%DWA primed 2* or the final word if youre not bloodied.  Not only saves you repairs ,but the annoyance of nimrads standjng infront of you and triggering your.explosive damage.
---
Yeah I don't understand the people who seem to think it's okay that you need to play 98% of the season just to get the pass done without paying
---
The people downvoting this have a smooth brain, this is exactly why the community is so dead not all 2000+ out of 3000 players are duper's, maybe 500 of the 3000 are duper's and the rest have fallen victim to the duper's schemes, it's a shit system Bethesda has set up and it's sad
---
The thing thats just as bad is when they dont get a hit on the legendary and start chucking angry and thumbs down and toxic emotes to you and sometimes goes on the mic and starts berating you when they just one shot them or kill them before everyone gets a hit. In UF i sometimes block the tunnel with my PA and round people up so everyone is there before it gets finessed and let them fire away, usually works.
---
Any low levels, if either the OPs scenario or my scenario( not the UF onb) remember, they are sad butthurt no-lifers with duped legacys who have nothing better to do in life than be an entitled sod and they are keyboard warriors, they hide behind their screen and act tough and intimidating and wind people up online because they know there is no real life consequences so they can carry on. They just act up online, dont let them get to you :)
---
U have to reach level 50 before u can rearrange skillpoints maman.
---
He's not beating the Brahmim, it heals them.
---
After you reached level.50 you don’t get to add a new special point and card but you have to choose between moving a point or choosing a new perk card
---
Very much agreed
---
Ah thanks!
---
Yeah! How dare they release a new game and do other shit FO76-players want, when the Diablo 3 Season is still on. 
---
Blizzard was first!one!!
---
Once you hit 50 you can move a point or pick a specific perk card every level up
---
They’re called Legendary perks not congratulations you made it out of the vault perks
---
Killed by your own duped weapon, what a huge fucking shame.
---
Here's a new problem. With the Legendary Run, they stopped handing out atoms  for the weekly and daily challenges, so no more fun and free purchases. It's either pay up or fall behind :/
---
Discord is pretty much the closest thing to text chat on this game but you have to know their discord name so still far off but at least its something
---
Hell, I had 180 when I went and tried NW for the first time finally.  Saved most of them to open during double XP and gained 8 levels from opening doubles.  165 perk packs opened last night.....zero frog legs LMAO
---
Fair on the mental gymnastics, the internet tends to agree with you, however, it has a different meaning to me and my circle. But to be fair, you are going to great lengths to justify your attack on OP that how they play the game is lazy and to insult them because they choose to purchase the cosmetics instead of wasting their precious time grinding for them. Keep in mind you are attacking a playstyle and lifestyle choice, I am merely defending it. 
---
'Designed to milk people who lack impulse control', 'OP didn't even try to finish one rank'. You do realise that you unintentionally finish 2-3 ranks just by playing the game. There is no way OP loves building so much and has spent the last 2 weeks purely building. If OP played the game doing their normal routine they would already have a few ranks. So therefore the only conclusion is that they either didn't play for 2 weeks or did this purely as a stunt for views. 
---
Either way, who cares? Oh, this dude on Reddit cares. It has absolutely no negative impact on his game experience. Actually, it improves  his game experience by providing the developers with the funds they need to develop new content. Yet they still come on Reddit and shit on the game, the content that they provide and the true fans that support the game. 
---
So it is quite obvious that you are so enlightened that you and your opinions are so much more important and true that they need to be forced upon other people. It obviously didn't occur to you to just chuckle to yourself, maybe downvote (which would be a dick move, but this is Reddit) and move on. No, you made the choice to shit on someone else parade because there isn't even a slither of possibility that you are wrong. To you, your opinion is right and you will defend it with a passion. 
---
So, you want to grind The Legendary Run, good for you. I have done my fair share of grinding and it is very worthwhile when you finally achieve what you were grinding for. OP wants to buy the levels for The Legendary Run, good on OP. I wish I had that kind of spare cash that I could do that too. 
---
Because to some people family and life outside of games is more important. To others, games and game life is more important. Both are right.
---
This has been fun. But I fear you enjoy being an asshole online and belittling people. So continuing this is only giving airtime to a troll. And anyone still reading has surely run out of popcorn by now.
---
Good Morning, Good Day and Good Night.
---
Enjoy Fallout 76 Good Sir.
---
I can hit her for 150 or 200 in the air as long as she isn't too far away.  I don't have a problem with people taking air shots at her, since she can't be crippled anyway.   I move around while crouching because I'm bloodied and like to stay alive.   The real problem is people standing on tents/fences/V9 that prevent her from landing.  Get out in the open and she will land eventually.
---
Good point guess I’ll just die now
---
It was a cash item, not atomic shop.
---
Nine times out of ten I’m standing well to the side of the group to avoid getting caught in any attacks directed at said group. No need to bunch up
---
Ohhhh thanks for the confirmation :) I can still get the fireflies I wanted at least
---
Yeah I already acknowledged that but it’s never bad to re-release it
---
you're getting downvoted but you're absolutely correct lol
---
Doesnt the secret service armor just look like the mechanist armor???
---
RNJesus is not blessing you
---
They should implement a way to level lock vending machines. Should be simple enough ( I have a feeling someone here may go into lengthy detail to explain why its not), they can level lock weapons, armor, etc. surely there is a way to level lock a vending machine. Lvl 5 and below, lvl 20 or below, etc. All it has to do is detect your level and if your above the set level, gives you a pop up "vendor is locked".
---
Not a random fact. There is an in flux of new players which skews the ratio of low to high players lower on any given server. 
---
I will try to illustrate with an extreme example....
---
Imagine 24 people total play the game. They are all level 100. When you login you will see a map full of level 100 players. Now imagine the game just launched on game pass and is currently the number 20 most popular game there (it is). We now have 48 level new level 1 players playing the game. Instead of 1 server with 24 level 100 players on it, there are now 3 that have 8 level 100 players and 16 level 1 players each. You will now have a much harder time getting high level players in your map because they are now spread out between more servers.
---
So how does a gauss shotgun split a 2mm round into 8 pellets? Exactly. That doesn't make sense either, but here we are.
---
Been praying for weeks for his blessing
---
Not at all
---
If its green then let us place it!
---
The game did go into maintenance like 3 hours ago. Possibly still offline.
---
Upvoted all your replies since it appears some dickwad downvoter has emerged.
---
Ok I see your point but please explain this on PS4 thanks
---
Mostly at least for me its a matter of the other advantages I get from using a explosive plasma Gatling. The main one being I can use a beam splitter to increase the damage output while still firing actual shot rather than the plasma fire that beam splitter fires when using a non explosive gatling plasma.
---
So would you mind explaining this process, I am thinking of making a mule character.
---
Legendary perks is a free update so that does not make them money. Second I rather they release later due to how bad the perks were in patch 20. 
---
The new legendary perks that added actually made me care.
---
You forgot missiles. There are always 2 Missiles. At least.
---
Bye bye Ammo, hello Fallout 1st.
---
Same happened to me. Made a post about it yesterday suggesting craftable loot bags you can lock to a certain max level so only those who are at or below it can open it. 
---
Cue a bit later someone suggested it's my fault cause I dropped the loot to begin with.
---
Some people are just cunts.
---
Use building and change to event when there's one on. Then back to building. Rinse and repeat. Most profitable.
---
Tis very good.  40mm, arrows, crossbolts makes the ammo convertor less tedious.
---
Are you talking about the challenge? because that is bugged. 
---
If you are talking about loot, then you have to do more damage, turn on your damage numbers to see what you are doing, nobody really knows what the low end cut off is, but 1k usually see's you get that precious nocturnal shovel.
---
True but the Challanges got easier and the items you get from the SCORE are free.
---
All ln all Im not too mad about this. Before Score I grinded the Dailys and Weeklys to buy thing I like (I dont like lots of the things in the Atom Shop - Slocoms Joe or the PA Camo Paints for example)
---
Now rather than sitting on 2k Atoms and waiting for something new in the Atom Shop that I really want, I sit at 1k (now 500 because of Raider Collectron) but got a bunch of stuff I atleast can use and some things are things I really want like the Firefly Lamp or the Chicken House for your Camp.
---
So basically I earn Camp Stuff for free AND can buy Stuff that I actually want from the ATOM Shop.
---
For Xbox a lot of nuclear winter players such as myself play in party’s. Game chat can be buggy and not work so we end up just making a party and stay in it
---
They do drop as legendaries, but it is indeed rare.  Took Angry Turtle 6 months to finally get a bloodied one.
---
They could...y'know... just put them into patch 21,  since they do seem to be working on the PTS. Or they just f'ed them up like adrenaline...and so many other things.
---
Ahhhhh gotcha.
---
Geeeeeeeeeeez
---
They still have not competed some of the art work and cleave is not working as intended.
---
What does that have to do with terms and conditions of an online, multi-player game? Bethesda does some garbage stuff, this game could be 10x better, and there are features they announced prior to launch that STILL aren't in the game, but that doesn't give someone else the right to exploit a game for an unfair advantage. 
---
Additionally, given their past, everyone should have seen this coming. It's not like they make account banning a secret.
---
Dang. But I wouls still save up and do a big run.
---
More chances to get something decent instead of one try.
---
You do get items for free BUT you do not choose which items you get and that's the issue I have with the new system.
---
ding ding ding. 100% correct, Queen is currently bugged, they are aware and have said several times removing crippling was unintentional.
---
Yeah im sick of going to a camp where there are tons of weapons and armour just to find its all overpriced garbage, i hate the 'ooh level 20 1\* bloodied lead pipe hmmm 6000 caps' i love people who sell everything cheap even if its rare cause it shows they arent collecting rare stuff and making people get huge sacrifices for them but just want them to have fun. I would love to tip them and maybe make it so theres a 'requests' list or 'wish list' for preferred items e.g. script, outfits, ammo and maybe make it so you can only put requested ammo there cause some douche would probably come along and fill it with dirty water and 40mm
---
Fair enough about that. Could be trying to dodge attacks from enemies that spawn insteadof killing them. Not really sure.
---
Only fissure prime sadly, it would be awesome if that was the case, add a little variety to what is essentially 50% of the end game content.
---
Yeah.  Not the greatest chance.  I just bought the gauntlet plans from foundation and rolled a BSS one in the first 10 rolls.  It hits almost as hard as a power fist and you have a much better chance to get one since you can roll specifically for gauntlets instead of completely relying on the RNG gods.
---
I think it knocks down the AP cost ... :)
---
Sorry, just forgot that it's 2020 and this is an AAA game, how utterly stupid of me. Btw, have they fixed adrenaline which is known to be broken for 2+ weeks now?
---
This comment made my day have a upvote
---
Why do you assume that I use a duped weapon? I've been playing since the game came out, I've collected a decent group of legacies over the years.
---
I have been hot before in that event, it was kind of funny because the guy stood there waiting to see what I would do.  He was lower level may be in the low hundreds.  I just gave him thumbs up and went on with my killing.   I think most people are understanding at that event.
---
Is that where you play? I would chalk that up to confirmation bias.
---
Even a 1 star, the first weapon you get that matches your build is a huge life altering moment. Congrats!
---
If I see no one on this, I still jump over to it. 3 legendaries to turn in for scrip and lots of meat. 10 minutes tops. Excellent event for low level players.
---
"Breaking news: thing should be *anything* other than what it is!"
---
Data miners said she has a perk which doesn't allow her limbs to be crippled, it sounds like something the could put in a hotfix
---
This reminds me to ask, I'm level 17 (I think?), quite often the public teams notifications show up. Besides for me being woefully underlevelled would me joining a team of super high level people be detrimental to them?
---
Had that happen with a Queen mirelurk last night.  she did not attack I tried t kill her nothing the health gust regend.
---
get more hp then noob, u keep doing the same fucking thing expecting shit to change and u complain 
---
or go private server noob
---
This bugs been out for awhile now
---
I circle around to get head shots. I also side step to avoid her melee attacks.
---
Yes, you can dodge those.
---
Just dive in, 1st time through the silo is a blast, take plenty of ammo and stims. Its the penultimate mission and is supposed to be hard. 
---
 Once you have done it a couple of times it becomes a cake walk. 
---
After a few hundred it becomes a chore. :)
---
Oh yeah, it totally did! The innuendo was palatable.
---
They are fixing it in patch 21. To be fair with the workers of fallout 76 they are working on a small budget with a small crew of people. 
---
Ever since the backlash at the game release the higher ups just assumed that the game will never get popular so they just give them a set amount to work with
---
I almost exclusively use punch weapons but I cannot seem to get excited enough about the gauntlet to buy plans. The idea of punching stuff w a bear skull is still real sexy to me. I traded &amp; got a mutants bear arm w swing speed &amp; it wrecks, so I can only imagine a top tier roll.
---
Yeah, I talk from mine and my friends experience
---
I didn't dv this, but have you are a new player and have not yet encountered the various event bugs yet.
---
* Events show up when they are nearly over
---
* ft to unchosen destinations
---
Also events that give notes should not be restricted in any way. 
---
And it might sound harsh, but it's the wastelands, if you can't hack it yet, go get some more levels. There is no need for you to think about getting legendaries yet.
---
I feel the same way towards players like that, at any event. It's not that hard to cooperate with others. Just today, I went to Uranium Fever, 5 other guys and myself were able to share the 3 legendaries that spawn. It's just shameful and a poor design on the game makers
---
Thanks man. Other than you and a few others, I’ve kinda lost hope for this sub.
---
I have one word for u: BORING!!!
---
But still congrats to ur victory.
---
as a now higher level player (130 ish), if someone drops items that we are not explicitly talking about me receiving, it's courtesy to wait until the lower level people look at it first. If they don't take it though? hell yeah I'm taking scrip fodder.
---
They won't fix it anytime soon IMO.  Bethesda is pulling out all the stops trying to get people to play NW.  They've resorted to blatant arm twisting with the new NW only score challenges.  I contend this "Bug" is by design.
---
Ahahaha
---
ur that random noob with a BE plasma crying over others standing in ur way like ur some white knight saving the world 
---
but u just a noob that needs to get private server or more hp
---
There's a wonderful country song I'd like to quote here
---
"sounds like life to me"
---
Sorry you're work interferes with your gaming. But it is what it is
---
They borked crippling, they are aware and hopefully it will be fixed soon (Its been nearly 6 months since they broke it)
---
Just cough a lot when you call into work to report that you think you might have COVID.  Profit.
---
Bummer
---
Power fist
---
I work away from home literly every weekend. I got about 4 hours of playtime before leaving for work and if im lucky I should get home on time and have a 6 hour game while the double exp is active. I usually miss out on 90% of them and either catch the start or end of them.
---
Power Fist.
---
They didn't last long did they?
---
Not sure when they'll bring it back but they had said they are planning in bringing it back, kinda like how we've got double xps a few times a year, and having it in different regions
---
Im with you man, but for me I still get Atoms - at a slower pace - but still free Atoms basically.
---
I pick the items I really want and the rest is free bees basically. The Chicken House is the hardest to get item I want for the Rest I couldnt care less.
---
All in all I do believe this System is healthier for the Game itself. Now doing daily Challanges (easier ones!) Is more chill for me because I dont really miss out on Atoms on a Daily Basis. 
---
Dont get me wrong, I would prefered it when they just packed all this content and make it as rewards for a Questline (or multiple) with new NPCs and Locations.
---
But I rather see myself doing some weekly and randomly unlocking a New Rifle Skin I can toy with, than stressing with wearing a fasnacht mask - protest sign and killing a deathclaw on deathclaw island as soon as I level up just to get 20 Atoms I may not even spend on anything because the latest ATOM stuff pealed my interest.
---
good job, you figured out the hoax, you must be an incredibly intelligent person to realize that all these people in the hospital are State paid actors from the liberal mainstream media
---
Damn. The bear arm is so much cooler looking lol. Does it lose out by a lot?
---
I actually switched to demo 5 after the reports. I have like 100 improved repair kits anyway... I thought it would be annoying to repair my guns constantly, but it's really nothing to think about even without the perk (and I'm using legacy weapons which break a lot more)... So I'm happy it broke, it showed me I don't need gunsmith 😂
---
Get rid of Healing Factor if you have it.
---
Damn haha love the look of the bear arm. Does it lose out by a lot?
---
I understand your point, 95 % of the time suffering a PA guy jumping up to the fence in front of me, blocking my VATS shooting. But using an explosive weapon against the SBQ its a bit useless, or guys in PA jumping over fences or tents, or PA guys in stealth position firing without silencers. Just stay at floor and keep shooting and agro the SBQ, and stop jumping around
---
Blueprint the item and then place the blueprint.  Problem solved.
---
Which outfit? Insurgent, or Treasure Hunter? No idea wtf "Tacticool" is, so... Are you on PS4?
---
Chally, you hear that? Music? Talking? No. **Trade**. Trade on the winds.
---
Well maybe im mistaken. Havent played F4 for ages...
---
My mistake!
---
Is it really about the rewards or the fact that the starred mobs are killed by high levels?
---
Be honest with yourself, you don't need that XP and certainly not the gear that drops from them, that is below lvl 50 anyways, just because the lower levels are in the event.
---
Why not do the decent thing and wait before you shoot the starred ones? You tried to explain it, but I have trouble following your reasoning. This topic is about a low-lvl event after all.
---
A lot of people don't bother reading older posts.
---
yes it does sound like begging
---
anyway don't worry oh, no matter how grindy the reward, you know Bethesda is going to put that shit in the atom shop in 90 days
---
Then you'd know to use the fireproof perk. Also, how could you collect them 'over the years' seeing as they were taken out of circulation quite a while ago.
---
The insurgent outfit
---
Yes confirmation bias. 
---
In order to actually see a sizable difference from a ban they would have to ban over 50% of players. Do you really believe they did that based on few dozen posts on reddit?
---
Also I imagine there has been an increase in players on all platforms (though clearly more on pc and Xbox) just with the new trailer and seasons.
---
Yeah, and it was a brand new perk, working theory is they were testing it out and forgot to remove, for the last 6 patches including the biggest patch since launch which had almost 400 fixes, just not the one we needed.
---
I gained 17 100 score bonuses yesterday on an events team.
---
 All I did was run event to event.  When I wasn't running events a did my daily quests.
---
 From what I understand the building team grants 4 intelligence on a fully binded team.  I think that equals out to about 8% XP increase on everything you do. 
---
 A fully bonded events team will Grant 100% extra event XP..
---
 Events Grant large chunks of XP then that gets doubled.
---
 So instead of 8% bonus XP for finishing an event I get 100% extra XP.
---
 If you do more than events and run around killing things, crafting or what have you then I am sure that intelligence boost would be more beneficial.
---
 For me I just constantly run events with very little downtime between. It seems more beneficial for me to run a full events team. I could be wrong but it's been working for me so far.
---
Also yes I am on ps4
---
Has that ever happened even once? Like... a single time?  
---
Like I am all for trash talking their predatory sales tactics, but... maybe keep it in the realm of reality?
---
Two or three.
---
Generally ... daily driver, tagger, boss killer.
---
For my commando I'm mostly running this is a Tesla for tagging, a primed bloody handmade for bosses and eitgerva fixer I radium depending on mood.
---
I'll run around if i want to, i will shoot her in the air if i want to.
---
The Brotherhood broadcast is a pain
---
Best you can do to find that elusive giblet from a legendary monster corpse is to take out the camera and looking around.
---
You have no reason to feel bad for this. Someone much higher level than you like that was probably never in any real danger compared to yourself and should be more gracious. You have no real obligation to them. 
---
And perhaps the thumbs down was unintentional or not meant the way you took it. I accidentally send the wrong emotes all the time because my emote wheel is a laggy piece of crap. Dont be so hard on yourself, it's only a video game and you had no genuine ill intentions.
---
Apparently that’s one of the features coming with the “One Appalachia” update. Where as long as your actively participating in the event you will be able to collect all the legendary drops that come from or around said event but if you are inactive and just joining for the loot it’s supposed to have a sort of auto detect where you might not be able to loot if it doesn’t sense any participation.
---
What I would prefer is invis-fags stop bringing all manner of ghouls and other nasties on the people trying to fucking shoot the bitch.
---
That and I noticed she lands more when people stop fucking shooting her in the air.
---
All of this is why I will never move my camp. Even though it’d be cool to experiment with different builds in different places, the system is just too fussy and fiddly.
---
Everytime I do that event there's always one dbag with a minigun. Makes me regret not ending those brahmins out of spite. Bethesda needs to buff boss enemies so everyone gets a chance to tag or at least nerf some perks.
---
Well how far are you from getting to your desired build?
---
I donate so many stims it's unreal. Even with donating 10-30 to every low level on the server. I sti have 350 stims left.
---
I need to stop hoarding bodies.
---
That's all very well, but it's not practical to do all the time as there is usually a cost (in caps/time) associated with finding a stashbox.
---
You pick up a fan (yay, screws!). You're not going to fast travel somewhere with a stash box, then pay caps to fast travel back to where you were each time.
---
In short, yes. The TOS allows 3rd party mods as long as they aren't enabling you to cheat or otherwise attain an unfair advantage. They don't support them, though, so you're on your own if/when things go wrong.
---
The CMs have in the past reminded people to disable and update their mods after patches, so they are well aware of mods being used.
---
Why is this getting downvoted?   It’s gold.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
I have one you can have. You know, to save Bethesda from having to re-launch an entire two week event just for you 😅 I din't have the plan though - I only have this one put aside that I can give you from my personal collection, so I can't make more for your friends unfortunately
---
PSN id: xxplaguewind
---
Ty can I get a list of the ones that I can use without being banned if there is one
---
What if I’m in a role playing group as raider?
---
Why would you have stable flux when fighting the queen? Surely you stabilise it once you're done?
---
I got it on Tuesday. I love him
---
If your moving points around like that all the time then you need to go to a special build website to help plan out your cards and stats. The way you are doing is to never make you happy.
---
If you only have one them keep it man, I would love having but if you only have one I don't want to get of the joy of you having it
---
This is the Fallout theme... Just like the factions that died couldn't cooperate... The same theme repeats in other fallout games, the humans in this universe are not reasonable (and it goes to extremes the further in the fallout future we are).
---
Everything in all fallout games is based around violence. Even very smart and forward thinking factions like The Institute in Fallout 4.
---
neither am I, I've been putting all my time into fallout 76 lately
---
It probably brings you a lot of joy to have so keep it
---
Got it yesterday. I’m right on track I think as long as I get 50k xp between now and Monday which should be easy enough.
---
I never use it, and only have it cos I'm a hoarder. It's buried on my alt 🤷‍♂️ you'll enjoy it a lot more than I do
---
I do this all the time and it never fails if I use this method:
---
Put both characters at the whitesprings station.  On character one, place items into the blue suitcase. Exit to the main menu and log in character 2, but you must do it within a couple minutes.  Walk up to the suitcase with character 2 and grab whatever.  You can transfer items both ways using this method and you'll never lose anything.
---
IF you have a second account, it works the same way except you open a second copy of the game using the windows key to minimize the first instance of the game, then use the fallout76.exe in the game folder to open a second instance of the game.  Then use the friends list to join character 1.  Walk up to the suitcase and grab whatever you transferred there.
---
Works 100%.  I've never lost an item in hundreds of tries doing it this way.
---
Useless? Even when using the jetpack?
---
I think I'm just tweaking here and there.  Maybe 6-9 more if need be?
---
I started out as a high DR shotgun/commando then when public groups came out I worked towards shotgun/medic.  After that I switched towards bloodied PA and then bloodied commando PA/PA.
---
It's a VIDEO GAME set in the wasteland. Get out of here with that wannabe darwinist shit. It's not real life.
---
Omg man your the best I really appreciate it
---
NO put them in your vendors at a cap each... plz :)
---
Your not. The expected score level people should be at is exactly rank 40 today.
---
As a newer player there are just so many things to do and my main focus is going through the missions to progress story so far, I see public events pop up but I can't always just leave what I'm doing otherwise ill never finish lol
---
Hahahaha.
---
Did you miss out on double xp cause you bought a duped gun?
---
Name one in this game that was a non-Vaulted Limited Time item that was brought back. 
---
The Battlecoat wasn’t brought back. 
---
The Pint-Sized Slasher outfit and knife weren’t brought back. 
---
The Revolutionary General’s Unifrom hasn’t been brought back. 
---
It’s okay for some things to be exclusive based on time.
---
the only thing I agree with is that you don't know anything about computers or coding, the rest of this is bullshit
---
Got him a couple days ago and used up all my camp budget to put them everywhere lol
---
6 to 9 more levels is easy, especially with double XP right now.  I'd just grind it out.
---
I looked again and according the wiki it's 15800 for level 100 and 158000 for level 300.  
---
As in it maxes out at that value but then jumps again.
---
I want corroboration from a high level player though because that's stupid.
---
Assuming you have FO1st and can start a private server, put the item you want to transfer into a container (like a suitcase at a train station). Do not just drop it on the ground. Leave the world. The private server will remain available for approximately 5 minutes. Select your other character. Have that character play on a private server. It will spawn into the same private server as your previous character. Collect the item from the container.
---
It isn't written anywhere that to see anything there should be at least a ban of the 50% of the player base. Differently from you I'm talking from experience not Reddit posts or personal assumptions. For the player increase not too much, the player base is pretty static since launch, just a bit during Wastelanders and obviously during free weekends (all info I gathered some time ago around YouTube). Anyway I won't respond to any your answer without you bringing info from trustful sources (so not generic Reddit posts) because otherwise this discussion wouldn't bring to nothing (also the info I'm interested in are regarding PS4 not XB1).
---
I didn’t know that was ever a thing?
---
Literally the corvega backpack is a limited time item yet it’s back :|
---
No excuse for role playing a raider and being a jerk to others. Taking a low level legendary at over 200+ level doesn’t make you a raider, it makes you a jackass.
---
I do it because those dam adds are always going after me for some reason.  I am constantly in stealth mode so the more I move the less likely I am to be put in danger.
---
 I appreciate you asked politely but you play your game your way, I'll play my game my way.
---
I've transferred hundreds of legendaries doing it this way. I just lost my first set to a server crash yesterday. Luckily it was only 5 items, but if you do it make sure you have someone in your server, alot of things can go wrong and you can lose the items.
---
Fair enough, although my personal experience is that everyone constantly steps in front of everyone else in that fight, at least at Drop Site V9. Things seem to be somewhat better at Forward Station Delta, probably due to the elevated circular walkway.
---
Yes, the bear arm has the sexy factor.  Good luck getting the one you want.
---
You can always just switch between building and events as the event is about to end since you can change the public team goal really quickly.
---
Just one, a BE HM.
---
Got him yesterday
---
I skipped the revive player ones. The overseer rank increase isn't bad. If you really want to, just create a new character and hide in a bush. One time with decent luck should get you a level.
---
I think as the game evolved and then I learned more I changed my goals.  I started out with a build I was pretty happy with but then public groups came out and I wanted to focus on healing.  But realized that hardly anyone needed healing and noticed that high DR wasn't that helpful and saw how if you built a certain way bloodied isn't super vulnerable, so I built towards a PA/bloodied with emergency protocols PA, then am starting to fully commit to bloodied with or without PA with more stealth/unyielding stuff.
---
Damn, all my challenges should just autocomplete if playing with myself helps.
---
I didn’t get my build the way I wanted until I was around level 150, I just had to try all the perks and now I know exactly what I like for my play style so you’re not the only one
---
I've been one-shotted in the back near the end of killing the SBQ three out of the last four times by high level wastelanders... naturally they collected my hard earned junk. We always have a few turds in the punch bowl.
---
I usually just join somebody else's team, it's easier that way.
---
They recently said they plan on fixing it August 4 or somewhere in that timeframe. Luckily, I grounded out most of the rewards last week and now only have the last Christmas one
---
I love the combination :)
---
That 50% thing I said is from a statistical significance perspective for you to actually notice a large ban. If you need me to whip out the PhD level maths I will. 
---
There is no reliable source on player count. Anything you see on YouTube is pure speculation. Where do they get their data from? Because as far as I see the only one publishing are steam (active player count) and Xbox (only to the level of knowing it is a top 20 most played game atm)
---
Yeah, role playing as a raider is no excuse for being a troll to low levels. I’d think if by raider mentality, you’d raid something useful for you, at 200+ a low level 1* legendary is not useful. One can still enjoy a raider rp and still not be awful to others.
---
Many people never even touched NW and are not as active on reddit (like me obviously). So I wanted to tell all those people like me that they can still claim it AND should check out their NW card packs.
---
I'm sorry if this annoys you but nobody forced you to click on this thread and even comment on it. Just continue scrolling next time.
---
Ugh, another "yOuRe PlAyInG tHe GaMe WrOnG!" Thread
---
Yeah they go well with each other
---
In the end of it all. Play how you want to play not how others play. Bloodied is great at killing things but junkies works as well.
---
I play as a heavy gunner PA bloodied build and I don’t regret it. I can face tank the SBQ while just 20% hp wearing my t 65 PA
---
There is a golden way:
---
Delete all and every duped items, keep the original one only. So goodbye, duped b2525 fixers, be gatling plasmas, etc...
---
And this way, legacies would be real mementos of the past, their value stay high and only a handfull would be in the game.
---
Even b2525 fixers would have their value this way.
---
If it's that big of a deal, they literally let you know when the double XP weekends are a month or two in advance. You can request days off of work.
---
F
---
And I use the SS helmet since it comes with a built in flashlight. Was using the maybe helmet before, they also go really good together.
---
Good to know thanks for the info! :)
---
Hemlock Holes in the west end of toxic valley has 3 acid nodes.  If you're gonna be on for a few hours it's a worthwhile grab.
---
It isn a option but you always stayed in a team with your friends wfter the match
---
It seems like sponge is a issue all together, but explosives being slow to load definitely got hit hard. Maybe if legendary explosive effect was aoe damage but not added explosive damage they could knock the resistance down? Besides the weight the reload times further reduce their effectiveness. You'd think targeting computer missile launchers be the go to heavy explosive for scorched. 
---
If end game bosses being killed to fast is an issue then why not have them be multi phase? Sbq phase one is constant flight keeping the field radded, it has health regen within its own mist that falls from its wings. Cripple the wings and she comes down with no regen, she maybe slowed now but have her aggressive. If another scorched beast gasses her to long her wings repair etc. Defeat second phase and she becomes exposed ultricite form or something, mutates tentacles or growths that act like turrets? Skilled teams would still blow through her but it beats neutering a weapon whose job is aoe slow but heavy damage.
---
Would be a neat idea for free vending that is aimed for low levels to have some setting in the machine you use that specified levels that can buy stuff (i.e. Sell only to levels 2-19). Sure high levels could use an alt to get around it, but it might deter the lazy ones. I never take free ammo or really any free stuff that I don’t really need. No reason to be greedy.
---
I use the bear arm just because it looks the coolest lol, I can still one shot almost anything with it so it’s all good if I lose out on a little damage. I just wish I could get the mod for the rebar that comes out of the mouth, idk what it’s called.
---
I was melee since beta slicing her up when she landed but helpless when she flew. I’ve completed a switch to rifles and I’m having a lot more fun with SBQ. I am pretty much undetectable by ai and have almost unlimited action points and will ignore everything you just said. Cheers though!
---
I always get downvoted for saying this, but whatever... When I want to transfer between characters, I go to Vault 76 and just drop everything in a loot bag on my Private World, change characters, and pick up what I dropped. Literally hundreds of times I have done this and not once did the loot bag disappear or anything was lost.
---
you can join a public team too, no one talks and everyone does their own thing anyways
---
Maybe i never played enough but I always had to re join up from my memory. Usually if you leave the game to go to the main menu because you die it kicks you from the team, because your team is still in the game. 
---
Maybe I am remembering wrong.
---
Haha I have the same thing friend! It makes it hard to see a lot of shit lol
---
This won't stop me because I can't read
---
“Robots can have friends”
---
It still wouldn't be possible to max them all out even with using all the legendary card slots. Even then you probs wouldn't want to do all special  cause you'd be missing out on other legendary perks and I think atm it takes about 1500 levels to max a legendary card out which is insane.
---
You are gonna be one unhappy dude. No one follows those rules. 50% of Scorched earth the queen never even lands anymore. Maybe it's just as well cuz if she does some fucktard will kill her in 30 seconds.
---
I will ignore number 3 because I'm a stealth rifle build
---
Very helpful, thank you.
---
It is an Atomic Shop item. Vaulted items have a history of coming back. 
---
The bundles were exclusives associated with external events. 
---
‘Limited time to purchase before it gets vaulted’ is very different than ‘limited time event exclusive’. 
---
Think of it as a convention exclusive item that can only be purchased from that event at that time.
---
Even with weightless missile launcher, reduced explosive weight, and increased damage I felt like I was better off with other heavies simply because the reloading took away from prescious time you could be shooting. Add to it the closed in areas being a issue, grenade launchers sights dont really do much in first person and  all.
---
Don’t forget if someone opens a lunchbox make sure to open 4 more. Don’t want him having an unfair advantage to people farming without a exp bonus. 
---
/s
---
You can alway have someone mod it for you
---
Didn't realise i was going too a tea party with the queen lol
---
But but but, it was Bethesda’s wrong for the SBQ won’t land, and I want to play in the way I want, dun lecture me how to play the game XD. Honestly, if I saw bunch of PA heavy gunner stand on tents n fences n shooting void, I will head into nuke zone n get some flux materials rather than waste 30 min
---
Bear arm is the sexiest looking unarmed weapon for sure, maybe even the best looking weapon in the whole game imo. I’m still trying to get that plan so I can get a bloodied bear arm eventually
---
It's not quite the same, but I set up a Slocum's Joe shop at my camp and stocked with all the canned coffee, cream, donuts, Fancy Lads and Nuka Cola that I could find from several days of gathering. And gathering sufficient brahmin milk and frog egg for Fasnacht donuts is a bit of a pain. I didn't price them for free, but I kept the prices cheap... Cheaper than the 'pre war' prices at any rate. 
---
I figured it was just a bit of fun to make my coffee shop/Becket's Bar seem a bit more authentic. None of these aid items are particularly useful, and I priced them high enough that someone couldn't really sell them at a vendor for a profit. But nope... Only up for a couple of days and one person came in and bought everything but the Nuka. Rather than be happy for the sale, I just felt rather miffed that I spent all the time and effort and someone just scoops it all up at once. Like do you really need 30 bottles of cream?
---
It makes me feel like it's not worth the effort to try to bring a fun little bit of attempted role-play to the game when someone is just going to go 'Oooh, cheap/free stuff' and clean out days of work in seconds....
---
And i totally agree, but that would probably be way more actual work than what Bethesda is willing to do. So i tried to think of the easiest way.
---
FYI: You usually can tell where the horde boss is if you are familiar with locations.  For example, yesterday I had to search for an eyebot boss. One of the possible locations was mama dolce’s. Knowing that robots usually spawn there I thought there was a good chance he was there. I was right. Didn’t need to search anywhere else.
---
Exactly what we needed, more people being offended by stupid shit and wanting to change everything that doesnt even revolve around them.
---
I'm a bloodied stealth melee build. Her flying around is the worst. Scorchbeasts need their AI to naturally land sometimes. Things don't just fly around
---
Legacy god mode got patched the new way is with a tesla soooo.....
---
Thats why we get so many "my challenges autocompleted" posts on this sub... People just playing with themself too much.
---
Same with supermutants in the bog are usually at the steakhouse and robobrian hoard is always at the place in watago.. can't remember the name
---
Man most of the hoard events I've gone to lately have been fast travel there, kill 1 big hoard and the boss, profit. I've been loving them haha
---
This is the most annoying thing in the world. You’re wasting your time and everyone else that’s playing’s time. Sure it’s “not cheating,” but you can’t possibly tell me you’re enjoying yourself sitting still. If you tried this in any other battle royale you’d get brained by a sniper for sitting still that long.
---
Bottom line, you’re playing the game wrong and making it take way longer than it should. When this happens in the final circle my reaction is always annoyance at the fact that I could be half way through another game if it weren’t for someone desperately trying not to learn how to play the game properly.
---
Same.
---
U have to record a clips n send the report to them
---
That sounds like s lot of gaming time to me lol
---
If a game is making your blood pressure rise, it’s time to find a new hobby.
---
I'm guessing people quite new to the game. My very first character I had some trouble getting enough purified water because I couldn't travel that far, didn't know places that reliably respawned water and didn't yet have a purified water pump for my camp. There wasn't really a reason to buy any though, there were plenty of other drinks you could have besides purified water.
---
The standard nozzle is the best. The medium does not give enough damage boost, the last one makes the flamer to a melee weapon...
---
Go on...
---
Do horde events give anything good?
---
That's pretty much why I stopped chasing them down haha
---
Be good just to even be able to see what xp you have and progress.
---
If it is there I cant find it!
---
Yeah, i hear you, i usually close all doors too, in my camp i use a red rocket automatic garage door powered with a pressure plate inside and outside, sometime get buggy but you can just jump one more time to open it lol :D
---
Why didnt you just kill him?
---
Wow that's a dick move... should've dropped a Nuke on his CAMP lol
---
4 of my toons have bear arm plan.  I’ve still only have gotten 1 bear arm in months.  Nocturnal 3*.
---
Yeah the one I bought came with the last one. There is no range. Thank you. :)
---
Why not just say Legendary Run?
---
If you are trying to get the max possible dmg per hit it can make a big difference but in 99% of that game these extra dmg dont help anything as you anyway will do so much dmg already with all other boosters especially if you play bloodied.
---
During raids in vault 94 my melee character was my most favorite but since they removed the raid i never played it again 😅
---
I have well over a 150 perk points I haven't moved around yet.
---
 I personally wouldn't make an alt since you can always gain more levels and switch more points.
---
Got it on Wednesday. Best reward so far.
---
I'd say level your alt. You are plenty far ahead, believe you should be at 40 today, and we've still got the double score next weekend
---
What a tool!
---
Best I can do in those situations (without getting abusive over the mic) is to block them!
---
You can only get these to drop from the Purveyor?
---
Why thank you! It’s nice to have ones work noticed!
---
Personally I’d level your alt. Score challenges are account wide so you will still be earning score towards your unlocks. Also as you are lv 48 already I’d say you have this completely under control and are likely to get to 100 before the end if you keep up with your current pace.
---
Interesting! I did some farming with INT/XP buffs before the double xp weekend and scorched earth had a cap at 4k XP for me. But I haven't checked since the start of the double XP weekend. Maybe they increased the cap to 6k XP for it.
---
As much as I'd like a glitch free game part of me wants this one to stay. I have so many great photos from thanks to glitched mobs.
---
thats exactly what i told u, if there was an hard cap then making a event team is not pointless, u just said making a team would be pointless.
---
I still move points around sometimes even after playing for a long time, most recently boosting my Int for the legendary run. I also found that as my gear got better it would make some perks less needed so I could switch things around a bit.
---
oh ok, building teams means the int team group, thought its a word for making a team in general.
---
There is a workaround for this, but you have to do it every time you enter a server.
---
Very much the question I've had in my mind. My main is now at 49/100 so I think about as expected. My backup or second main I was wanting to respeck to a melee build from 15 intelligence commando but he doesn't have enough perk points to do it.
---
Questions... questions.
---
Taking pictures of glitched mobs is one my subject matters. Mostly for my load screens. Rad storms are another one
---
Yeah I miss the raids.
---
I played a bloodied melee for a bit but didn't care for it. I got a b ss s bear arm recently (totally legit I swear xD) and figured I might give it a norther go on a new toon.
---
Have 340 levels as a heavy gunner. Just started messing with a stealth commando and have been really enjoying it. Figure I might enjoy branching out even more
---
Does this mean I should already be at 40 or can I get there when the dailies update and still be on track, I missed a couple of days playing in the early stages of the run but with the double XP I've managed to catch up a little.
---
Except blueprinted structures can also be very fussy with placement.
---
At least cater specific weapons. Two shot pump action has almost no accuracy and the damage dropped off even with explosive. Something that sounds deadly felt like a confetti cannon. Increase its accuracy. Fast fire rate lever action cant increase its fire rate because they cap it which makes those mods useless on the gun. 
---
44s feel useless now, I remember hoarding ammo to use on particularly tough enemies that a rifle wasn't at. In 76 they feel like they shoot 38 and the 38s feel like 22s real fast lol.
---
Enemy turrets can be a threat meanwhile ours are jokes and waste camp budget. My cousins camp is always sniped at because the super mutants wont close in knowing about the turrets. Mine keep killing peaceful creatures like observant radstag yet my camp being attached by lvl 60 scorched, or raiders just slow them down. The occasional lvl 80 scorchbeast just one shots them and destroys my camp since wastelanders update but I love my spot so im sol.
---
Now that Carnivore/Herbivore doubles the bonus of food instead of just the food value it's actually quite useful to carry some around just for the buffs. +20% melee damage from glowing steaks, +4 Strength from Deathclaw steaks and +6 SPECIAL boosts from Scorchbeast meats is nothing to sneeze at. And +40 lbs carry weight from Radstag steaks means carrying more loot back to the vendors. I've actually starting using Good With Salt and Grocer's Backpack to keep extra food on me just for the buffs.
---
What actually affects this bug (besides healing factor)? I’ve been playing for approx. 2 months, and I’ve never encountered this bug before (thankfully, as it sounds really annoying). I remember hearing one of the reasons it could happen is because of certain perks and armor, but my mind may be playing tricks on me.
---
Powergamers gonna powergame.
---
It has indeed
---
Horde boss can be a 3 star legendary, if you can get to one without anyone else joining you can keep killing the adds and ignore the boss for more xp/legendaries
---
If they complete a quest you get come caps
---
thats a load off of my mind thank you
---
A nice QOL improvement would be the option of doors that auto-close after a few seconds.
---
PC
---
A widely used survival strategy during all of evolution is HIDING and staying PASSIVE. i see no problem with this, its a legit way to win a NW-match. its all about SURVIVING.
---
Totally agree they typically spawn where they normally can be found, I assume so they aren’t instantly killed by the location mobs, and you get nothing.  I watch where they are on the map if you spawn in at a location full of one type to get the boss, the local mobs often get them first if you don’t charge in and tag it quick.
---
Practically anything  on [nexusmods.com/fallout76](https://nexusmods.com/fallout76) should be safe. I personally use
---
* [Perk Loadout Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124) \- a game changer and an absolute must for me.
---
* [Improved Health Bars](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/368) \- a segmented health bar and % HP display that's useful especially for bloodied builds.
---
* [Better Inventory](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32) for general inventory UI improvements.
---
* [TZMap](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/419) \- a map replacer with a lot of possible additional info - ore deposits, treasure maps, workbenches, vendors, random encounter spawns, etc. and a few different map marker sets that are a lot more visible than the default.
---
Yes, when an ally completes a quest, the whole team gets Caps. Charisma gets higher caps
---
We'll be lucky to see it next year around the same time.
---
Just a minute ago I considered a *Fog Crawler Horde event in cranberry bog* but remembered there would be 4 locations and the start point was not even in the bog, I did something else.
---
Poor bastard.
---
As if building up your camp isn't a challenge already.
---
You have my sympathy.
---
Shoot at her in the air, just not when she does her obvious turn, pause and leap upwards before she lands.
---
I've been to countless SBQs with people on tents, fences and the bunker and she's landed multiple times. At other times in the open she's stayed airborne or done mere touch and goes - it ain't that simple.
---
You have no idea who is capable of dealing what damage. The worst offenders are often the PA Heavies who paint the sky with useless lasers and plasma bolts and think they know the rule book by heart despite never having played melee, shotgun or Gunslinger without Magic or Legacy Explosive weapons.
---
So folk here's my alternative advice - play for fun, just don't do anything really stupid or annoying like spraying Explosive Plasma randomly around events...you know the type, the people who think they can dictate the game.
---
It's Quad XP if you saved your lunch boxes! WOOoO
---
I know that but I wanted to go through the quest to experience the story. 
---
Under my main data tab I have three quests. Defiance has fallen, Duty Calls and The Ol Western Shuffle. That's it
---
It's no big deal, like its not a game breaker... it would have just been nice to go through the quest line like you're meant to
---
its more than that every time im in a game people start crap
---
what?
---
So how do I make sure I can’t get banned and like updating em
---
Usual RNG junk.
---
im the one that cooks
---
Unfortunately no, not sure if intended or bugged :/
---
Ah rip. Not sure then :p
---
those ive been on
---
I'm sorry for your loss 😥
---
Just hoping on of the community people see this. I already did my grind for the old rewards, so I’m just hoping we get an answer. Cause I’ll actually play it if it gives SCORE.
---
I think the most common flavor here is salt
---
Yes that's the part that competed, the quest is no longer there. You mean the elevator at whitesprings bunker? If so i went down there last night and nothing came up
---
Part of the issue is I played high DR shotgun commando without VATS for over 100 levels and then realized afterwards that VATS headshot with an anti armor shotgun would one hit kill most anything. A crit headshot would almost kill a scorch beast legendary.
---
So I realized I didn't have to build up my commando.
---
Then I realized that excessive DR didn't help that much. And I learned how awesome shotguns worked with medic and four leaf clover so I started investing heavily in charisma and perk sharing.
---
Then I watched how lifegiver and power armor with emergency protocols was much better tanking than my original build so I started working towards that.. Then I picked up a bloodied pistol. And then I picked up a bloodied smg and started moving off of shotgun. Then I got a bloodied tesla.  So much fun.
---
Then I got a one star unyielding SS chest. And my very next chest was a two star unyielding SS chest (+1 luck).
---
Now I'm moving cha into agi for more sneak on foot Vs dodgy in PA armor.
---
No with all the problems as of right now, its a good possibility that the game has a big issue that might cause you to stop playing for a while making the monthly sub pretty much useless and a waste of money
---
Always sounds too crunchy to me
---
Lol. Nice
---
I had the same empty containers yesterday. Haven't retried it yet though so I couldn't confirm it wasn't a one off.
---
It is worth taking for a month and filling that scrapbox with as much junk as you can find. And then cancel it. You can still access the scrapbox but not put stuff in. It'll free up space in your stash box. 
---
I've got like 60k steel and 10k lead which is gonna keep me in 2mm ec for a LONG time. And i'm adding more everyday
---
&gt; "but guns go brrrrrrr lol" 
---
Upvoted for this, thanks 😃
---
*Defiance has Fallen* is your next main quest. That will continue to lead you to the end of the questline. 
---
**Your quest hasn’t auto-competed.**. You just got the platform achievement.
---
I was tempted, but it would just escalates from there. Why bother, I had “score” to gather. Easier to just let him waste his ammo and ignore him.
---
Nope! The new public team system provides a passive buff to everyone on the team. And the more players the higher the buff! I'd recommend joining a building team for the buff to intelligence so you get extra experience for everything you do.
---
Yeah I had this aswell yesterday
---
9 or 10 its my entire b 33 collection, but I have wwr armor
---
ouch... i remember a similar scene someone postet from FO4, near a building in boston, where he was mauled -after killing some gunners- by the bear  lurking in that area...
---
found it on YT: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONWIgiY0wQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONWIgiY0wQ4)
---
Exactly. Nothing wrong with using stealth suit &amp; guns.
---
amen
---
It means that you are expected to be at rank 40 today in terms of legendary run XP if you want to reach rank 100. 
---
If your above the expected rank then you have to ability to keep grinding or rest a day or 2 if your high enough to do that. 
---
The google doc does not include event that raise your legendary run xp like the double exp or double score.
---
There are daily challenges for the legendary run that make you play NW for odd challenges.
---
It would also cut down on the impetus to dupe or otherwise cheat or buy stuff with real life currency from others, so that would free up resources that are currently dedicated to clamping down on that.
---
Plus, I feel like more people would be willing to put in more time if there was a clearer path to what they want, as opposed to quitting, or deciding what they have is good enough and playing less.
---
Maybe just make stupid expensive legendary plans for each weapon, and you can either use the current legendary modules for a RNG roll, one module per star, or stupid expensive roll-your-own modules where you pick the effects.
---
Maybe make the legendary plans and RYO modules all be whatever the scrip cap is (isn't it 1k?) or something so you have to max out scrip 4x, which is a grind, but the light at the end of the tunnel is that you're guaranteed to get exactly what you want.
---
SBQ fight is the ONLY time im interested in having a chadaround/use my chad weaps. I just want to kill the damn thing as quickly as possible so i can get my repair kits/flux and poopy legendary. Doing that fight with legit weaps just takes too long : /
---
What ever you say not my responsibility to help those who randomly show up, they need to be questing
---
Im finished. Rank 100. 50% cool stuff i guess. But the rank 100 PA skin looks like shit. Nothing like its pic.  Also captain cosmo outfit has no helmet like it shows. Kinda pissed me off
---
This sheep says you're trying just a little too hard.
---
Huh, what are the biggest issues now? Tnx
---
I guess Bethesda would say use the Trade option, but it’s so slow &amp; hangs. Maybe if they applied more server resources to their database servers then trading &amp; crafting &amp; the favourite wheel etc would be more usable.
---
No, I know that, but the repeatable XP challenge either doesn’t work or something. If we had that, it’d be more fun to do. Because then after dailies, I’d still be incentivized.
---
I think its just different for some people or maybe different on different platforms. 😆
---
I'm okay with her not landing if the people keeping her in the air are doing decent damage to her.  If she stays up there and it takes 25 minutes to kill her though I have an issue with that but can't stop it so whatever.  
---
I'm easily able to get enough damage on her in the air to get rewards but I'm not wasting a bunch of my ammo if someone wants to keep her from landing.  If someone wants to waste theirs and keep her up there I just switch to adds after getting my damage in.  Still screws over melee players and people who aren't able to do good damage to her up there though.
---
What system are you on? XB1 is flooded with low level players from Gamepass. High level events are not going to be very fun right now unless you want to be the DPS and solo the queen while everyone else stands by and watches. Lol. Even without the ban wave that many potential new players will water down the average level in servers.
---
I always go for the outfits, never the same hat, outstanding!
---
*Can't*? No such thing. As long as you stay with texture replacers and QoL mods, you should be *reasonably* safe, but the only way to be *absolutely* sure that you can not be banned for using a mod that Bethesda considered cheating is to not use mods at all. AFAIK, and according to the experience of thousands of other players, the mods on [nexusmods.com](https://nexusmods.com) are safe. For me the risk is worth it - I would have stopped playing this game a long time ago if it weren't for the Perk Loadout Manager mod...
---
As for updating, while there are apparently mod managers that work with FO76, I manage my mods manually - only having four of them certainly helps here. It's largely a case of seeing if anything breaks after a patch, then going to nexusmods to wait for an update to come out for my mods.
---
They should make the Thanksgiving 1 available to get on the store all year round, given how terrible the existing displays are
---
Exactly. And rather than juts buying a module and rolling, you could have specific modules so you still have to earn those rolls and effects at least a few times on other items. If you get 5 explosive weapons you can trade that for a chance at one explosive you want. So it doesn't skip the legendary grinding since you still earn those rolls in your favour
---
All that sweet violet while they go pew pew in their tins cans, priceless.
---
last night did a scorched earth on the xbone and there was i reckon about 13-14  people there. didn't see anyone under 80. Most were 200+
---
So if you were to be believed, which is a stretch, you launched 8 nukes failing each time and as each failure came for the reason you listed you never bothered to check how many higher level players were on the server.  This whole post reeks of dumb even with benefit of the doubt.
---
You make a really great point as I am on XB1
---
I've been getting 4000 xp from man hunt over 6000 with buff on
---
I've noticed this since public teams came about. A bunch of sub 50 players standing arou d not really able to help during scorched earth. Doesn't happen all the time but more often than before. I don't think it was the ban wave just an influx of new players over the past few months.
---
Im down. Even priming the barrel so you can make the ultracite rounds STILL isnt enough to keep that thing fed. i cant figure out how to make enough ammo to main it. I only bust it out for SBQ/WC/EN/if im getting shit on, such a cool weap too : /
---
Makes me super sad to say it but these are the exact type of people that made me quit playing the game in the past. Not the bugs, not the flawed game designs, but the people that act so selfish and ruin it for others.
---
It’s good. 
---
Last night on a random server there were plenty of level 200+s, and when the Queen was nuked about a dozen people showed up. Lowest level was about 80 IIRC. After we killed the Queen in about 10 minutes, we went and found the Colossus in the grove. Killed Randall too. 
---
While I’m seeing more low level players, I’m not seeing noticeably fewer high level players. 
---
You don’t need to dupe to be successful in this game. And that’s being proven right now.
---
Good to know I'm not alone. Thought I was going crazy!
---
Nice to know thanks for testing
---
No i mean the missle silo. It sounds like you all your missing if you have the keycard and a nuke code is the thing that says “launch a nuke”. Just go to a silo and it will pick up from there.
---
The Queen does not scale with more people. That was disproven a long time ago
---
[Get of my lawn!!](https://imgur.com/gallery/XYYN3XV)
---
She did eventually land and melted in seconds, but took about 10-15 minutes.
---
Thought its suppose to be like that? Less camp budget.
---
This fucking Idea of having to login religiously everyday is stressing me out and I'm at the point to just drop the game.
---
♥
---
Just luck of the draw. As for ps4 its mixed as well. Sometimes its nice highlevel player that kill sbq and robot sheepsquatch in seconds and other days its some 75s with pipe guns.
---
We might have been on the same server!  There were three runs in a row. I was at #1 and 3.
---
This is why I only stock my vending machine with Nukashine.
---
At least the imposter sheepsquatch is a real threat to your health bar.
---
Sorry wasn't intentional. I'm just used to calling then battle passes
---
True story. Health bar melter
---
You might be taking a non competitive game a bit too seriously. Have you even played another fallout?
---
Modding and duping have kept this franchise alive when bgs struggled to deliver any meaningful content. 
---
Thats the history of fallout
---
I want to do monster mash but isnt a pvp event? Feel like some minigun tryhard will come kill me if I try the event lol
---
You make a fair point. I do often forget about the buffs from cooked food. I just wish the cooking menu, and crafting for ammo, allowed bulk crafting.
---
The same way you get magical abilities by standing near radiation and becoming a frog jumping into the air. Magic cause it's a video game.
---
Sometimes yes you can just straight to the most likely location if you know the layout of the land, but its not always guaranteed.
---
It is mostly I just startednwoth the gamepass and simply dont have the suppliesbor plans to do much. And I'd rather experience the other content right now than build. Building usually only appeals to me late game or at the end of a gaming session.
---
Guess I have been getting some real bad luck with servers then? Glad to hear the queen is still being defeated
---
Your mom does though.
---
BOOM! LIGHTS OUT. Got em boys
---
This thing on?
---
*crickets*
---
Is there a rule against it? People is sensitive and flakes about this
---
Once I've done enough damage I sometimes go sleep in tent and make coffee or a snack, clean up when it's gone quiet.
---
Click the button to collect as fast as you can while at the same time holding the button to drink. You’ll get a huge amount.
---
This is a problem that should have been fixed long ago. A simple system of player reports are not enough. Even then they dont ban the hackers because they expect everyone to be recording their gameplay. They need to actually put resources into a proper anticheat and get these fuckers automatically. How is it hard to detect someone literally flying, noclipping, and mass killing people across the map?
---
The game belongs to BGS. They'll make the decisions. Still plenty of high levels around.
---
You really think I can do that? Some people don't have jobs which you can just have days off whenever you want.
---
So then why are you wasting time being here?  Is your life so devoid of things to do that you follow the sub of a game you have never played?
---
I’ve gone blind due to playing with myself
---
jeebus, when my camp gets too full I search the map for a low level dude and drop all my one stars off for him.
---
No hurry to finish the story or wastelanders stuff (although the quicker you finish the wastelanders the quicker you can start earning bullion). Take advantage of this double xp and do events and level up a lot. I didn't start the main story on my 2nd character until i was 120.
---
What do you do when I join your said team, boot me or go with the flow?
---
I'm stressed by having to login everyday, I know it's cosmetics but in my head its all or nothing. I don't like this system.
---
Or actual placing junk on shelves.
---
I’m sure there’s a nice little listening post down at Fissure Site Prime he can man for them....
---
Saw someone who already got the chicken coop this morning!
---
Aslong as I can make it to the chicken coop I'll be happy.
---
Rightyo. What exactly is Bullion, may I ask? Currency?
---
I got no stims
---
Explore, level up, maybe start wastelanders quests now that you are level 25, start the mistress of mysteries also.
---
Lol. Your character goes through more phases then a teenager.
---
Even if you turn off the power, vendor still work. Only difference Is they don't appear on the map.
---
How long can you stretch a story tho? Cause wastelanders only added a few hours of story, the content is doing the same dailies from the game release.
---
Hacked weapons that people use to insta kill the SBQ.
---
The constant disconnects
---
Death respawn bug
---
Hand full of aim botters in NW/afkers that just troll the team selection.
---
Vendors will possibly be disable due to a duping exploit
---
Challenges for daily and weekly rewards for the legendary run will auto complete without giving you any rewards.
---
Server instability causes rubber banding both for characters and also monsters will regain health due to the instability.
---
And if the inventory hack ever returns you don't want to be online
---
Again what you people don't understand is: the game can be played like that. You can be an ass to others in this game and that's how was programmed to be
---
Conflicting on #2 so far..
---
Part of me wants to say yes because it's a different wallet, and since I'm paying another fee for the same month I should be justified to them ,  but part of me feels it will act as I already got my credits this month.
---
i just hit that rank yesterday, and assuming i spend the ten ranks worth of atoms i get from the board on the last day i think i'll be fine.
---
I don’t think this is true, if I’m wrong, plz provide me with a link.
---
Then why do I have I am become death quest in my competed list? And the achievement for it?
---
Bullion can be exchanged for goods and services. Bullion is the currency you use to be some sweeeeeet gear and items from either the raiders or settlers (no matter who you side with you can buy from both). It's a LONG grind though to get the rep to get the better gear.
---
Any chance you know if the Cable Spool Table can be place in other people's camps, like *some* of the Atom Store items can?
---
I use they keypad power switch
---
closest is adding a color variant to the shop. for example, the recent Fasnacht event had new rare masks, but you could buy the same mask in a different color for atoms. but the "main" mask was exclusively an event reward.
---
I wasn’t saying anything bad or good about that subject. Just what I noticed in my gameplay.
---
One
---
I wish I could make my own password on those. If you can then idk how you would do it.
---
That’s up to you. I don’t see the value personally and I have 850 hours in.
---
Omg yes! This glitch is a pain in the rear end. Having to reset the team every single match! Bethesda please fix this... along with everything else.
---
Ive had a few people boot me and when I asked they where doing it for the boost in special but didn't want to llay with others.
---
To me this is stupid just kicking players. He'll if im playing i will either join or start a building team for the INT. I dont see any one else for ages unless they are grinding out events like I am.
---
Yep this is the trick, and free of rads
---
nobody said it's difficult, just shallow and boring. Let's just hope they refine the system more in the future if they plan on expanding on it story wise.
---
This is bad..
---
I have a junkies build and use a combat shotgun. Admittedly the shotgun has "magic" stats and will one shot anything in vats - not so much without vats, but with enforcer you can cripple alot of things so they don't get the jump on you. I've had fun with shotguns but I'm respeccing a little for heavy guns/power armor. Best thing about shotguns in my opinion is it's quite versatile to switch up to melee or heavy guns on the fly. I'm having alot of fun.
---
Jad been contemplating getting it for the bungalow alone. Dont think I will now
---
We shouldn't be paying for poor quality items that never get fixed
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbuz2r/psa_scorchbeast_queens_health_does_not_scale_with/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Weren't like two of those recolour masks free to all through the shop??
---
I have never had to do this but, i think you can 'repair all' from the C.A.M.P. device.
---
For your first question, it doesn’t matter when you learn a plan, you can always make that weapon/object at higher levels despite learning it at a lower one. For your second question, the best way to get caps is to get them from the vendor bots via selling junk, weapons, outfits, etc... (You can also equip Hard Bargain and eat some grape mentats to get a few more caps per object sold.). 
---
P.S. You can do events such as uranium fever to get weapons and the miner outfits and then go straight to the vendor. Also, you can go to Fort Defiance and get all the straight jackets and sell them for ~50 caps each as long as you have Hard Bargain maxed out. Finally, you can go the Whitespring Resort and get the golf outfits which sell for a good amount of caps.
---
Ah, in my work day, so I’m hoping that someone can answer this one for me. I do know that they have been very diligent in responding to Atomic Shop items that can be built in another’s CAMP. My friend won’t scrap the satellite I built her for just this reason.
---
This replay started as calling me a liar. Thanks for that. Yes I did check for high levels and they were not able to do proper damage along with myself with the amount of lower levels involved.
---
Its really annoying
---
i think just one was actually free. another was "free" if you bought a bundle of all the others.
---
That is a great picture though.  😆
---
I’m a shotgun build. If it has +33 vats then yes. Google magic shotgun fallout 76
---
The thing about shotguns is that there is a 90% weight reduction for the weapons so you can carry a Swiss Army knife of options with your endgame being the gauss shotgun
---
I started as a PA melee build. I changed to a full stealth rifle build but decided I didn't like it so I changed to an unarmed melee build. Ive probably spent a good 100 points swapping specials around before settling on my current build.
---
This is happening a lot more after patch 20.  I was finally able to get a bloodied FFR handmade from the purveyor and because of this bug it is generally worse than a non-FFR because of the increased DPS.  Shoot a ghoul in the face 20 times and nothing happens, or their health just jumps back and forth between 5% and 25%.
---
It's been a thing with shotguns for a really long time, and with the LMG to some extent too.  If you do too much damage over a short period of time the server either doesn't register it or adds some health back to compensate, so in some situations shooting an enemy can increase their health.  An adjustment was definitely needed because at one point you could down level 80 scorchbeasts with a single burst from the LMG but whatever they did wasn't the best approach.
---
As a software developer I've been really forgiving of the devs since launch but these bugs are really just getting to be unbearable.  Making enemy health decrease when shot in the face is perhaps the most basic feature of an online game and they can't manage to get it right after all this time.
---
Yeah it happens sometimes, there's only crap in the containers anyway.
---
If you're launching a nuke you could always post here. I'm sure you'd get people joining.
---
Yeah fair enough. Even so, at least you can come up with a kinda example - which is *a lot* more than the other person could do!
---
me too. CAMP is frustrating as hell for color blind people.
---
Point the first: The SBQ does not scale. At all. Not for health, not for DR, not for anything else. This has been shown a long time ago, so please stop perpetuating that myth. The only thing that adding more players does is giving you more and harder waves of scorched when the SBQ takes off after having landed.
---
Point the second: Because of this I have my doubts about your narrative that you can solo the SBQ just fine but have massive problems with other players around - except insofar as other players constantly firing at her from places she can not land and reach on foot keeps her in the air and thus out of weapon range, and that abusing the stealth mechanics to kill her doesn't work when there are multiple players around.
---
Point the third: People who crash or lag out the servers, or otherwise violate the TOS to the detriment of others or to get a personal advantage are bad for the game. I'm not at all sure what's there to discuss.
---
I was under the impression the keypad power switch doesn't actually require the code. Doesn't it just work like a regular switched pylon for other players?
---
Why not do a bit of both 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
The trick also works on the regular water pump
---
Always a good idea to ban cheaters. 
---
Pretty sure the queen doesn't scale up the more players you have there. It was datamined over a year ago. Unless something changed?
---
This is good advice.
---
Also If you have advanced power connectors, you can run conduit through solid walls so you don't need to run your wires through angled walls/windows etc.    
---
I put garage doors in with my vendors so when I turn them off, the doors shut and the vendors become completely inaccessible. The switch is locked in my generator shed, so I guess if someone really wanted to, they could pick the lock on that, but thats easily solvable by throwing a keypad powered door on there.
---
if nearly everyone was in a building team then maybe. 
---
I did enough damage to the queen to get loot but didn't get the quest rewards. Which was balls. I love my flux.
---
Usually, two rifles, two melee, two heavies.
---
These days I've got 7 or 8 heavies, three rifles, two melee, a 10mm smg and probably one or two more I can't think of.
---
I'm having stash management issues.
---
Go to the purveyor in the Ash heap, she's at the rusty pick, to spend your scrip
---
As for what to do, begin the real grind! Perfect your build, perfect your gear
---
There's plenty of quests to do, just go in to your pip boy and get started on the main quests and wasetlanders
---
If i see an event i know i can solo im not waiting around for other players to show up. If someone does show up i do let them hit any legendary enemies we come across. 
---
But while double exp is active im rushing to catch up on my score as I dont have much time to play these days.
---
The bungalow is a gorgeous structure, and I was excited to build a compound with them when it was first released. The glitch with objects sinking into the wall, as well as the teleportation glitch, quickly turned me off of that.
---
The water wheel issue was fixed relatively soon, sure. But reports have been made about the bungalow since last year, and nothing has been done to fix it. Worse still, it’s been broken even further since.
---
Have 44 spare atm...im level 485
---
You need to build up bonds again if you switch teams. Suppose that doesn't take long at all though HaHa!
---
Some players are real idiots. I’ve noticed Riding Shotgun is having jerks not participate, but run to the bridge spawn for the leader and camp out waiting on him, one shot him, then leave the event...
---
At least up to whatever anti armor or furious give. What is that, 50%?
---
No I don’t disagree if you’re hopping from event to event, most people aren’t though and it seems like a waste, I feel like most people don’t understand that more intelligence means more xp, especially new players
---
You keep doing your thing ☺️
---
Combat shotgun, gauss shotgun, lmg, gauss minigun and gatling gun. All the time. All 3* bloodied.
---
Again, if you’re doing events consistently not a bad thing at all, was just a reminder to more of the new player base who don’t necessarily know how things work! ☺️
---
Slap a prime receiver on it and craft ultracite 2mm EC, 4x the ammo at only 50% more lead &amp; steel drastically ups the efficiency.
---
You just have to farm some flux which isn't bad &amp; can be fun.
---
Just loot every container you find. There is lots of broken ones.
---
They won't show up unless you do the initial quest for them.
---
Despite what some claim (generally Stealth 2h melee and PA Explosive Heavies) pretty much every build is viable but you have to be willing to make sacrifices to get the best out of them. 
---
I'm currently playing a Bloodied Gunslinger which is regularly bad mouthed as being useless based on people's early game experience . Yet I've killed L95 Behemoths with 3 hits, 3* Scorch Beasts, and soloed numerous 'team' events, all without having yet found a single Bloodied pistol.
---
Time, dedication, and a willingness to see what's possible as you progressive upgrade your support pieces can make a 'meh' in to a wow build.
---
They sure are still around. I seem to constantly find them in toolboxes.
---
You don’t have to put in the code, but others do
---
Yikes...
---
You can keep yourself subbed if you really care that much, but please do us a favor and refrain from commenting in the future.
---
Take advantage of double xp weekend to level up fast! Then worry about doing the quests ☺️
---
Thanks for the reply, I'll start to clear out my pip-boy and I'm looking forward to the shenanigans that will inevitably come my way :)
---
Did they change the Intelligence in fallout 76 when I started playing I could of swore you got the same xp no matter what your intelligence was. Have they changed it
---
Yeah that's fair enough. I know that the Seedy Shed and Water Wheel are the go-to gifts given to new players. Thanks anyway ☺️
---
So, this can fix the vaporazitaion nozzle? Cool, will try. Thank you.
---
It got nerfed pretty heavily so not as many still want assassin sentinel for pvp anymore plus people move around alot now so sentinel isnt as useful
---
Alrighty, first I'm going shopping at a certain mole miner and wish for the best :)
---
There are everywhere. I find three or four in every silo I run.
---
You don’t have to input it for the pylon switch if you’re the owner
---
If they add a display case there will be 10 kind of duplication glitches coming from It lol
---
Yeah I don't wait for other players most of the time, but the problem was that I didn't see any decent event. So weird man.
---
Indeed ☺️ and check out some player vending machines, sometimes there’s some good stuff for quite cheap
---
on a basic level, yes it can be viable for any end game moments, but like melee, if you're tackling the scorchbeast queen or her kiddies you kinda have to wait for them to land to be effective..
---
Hit manhunt too, with all the buff I got 8000 xp in 1 minute
---
People like that are the reason I'm glad Bethesda hasn't fix the explosive bait bug yet and why I stock pile them
---
Yeah. no rules against it. 
---
Might wanna use something like [https://imgur.com/](https://imgur.com/)
---
I really want one in real life...
---
Hmmm read the first comment on that post. Server lag could indeed be an issue to further his point which would explain why I do so much more damage in a private server. But maybe the amount of people joining does increase her DR? Wouldn’t that make sense on Beths POV? You don’t want it to be too easy?
---
Welcome to the wasteland!  Yeah, there are a lot of fucktards here.  Most aren’t but some have small brain power and do dumb shit just like they probably do in real life.
---
Am I supposed to eat my food through the mask?
---
Again is a game and people is entitled to so whatever they feel like it. If you don't like then go to your or your friends private server and shelter yourself
---
Ah didn’t know that. Well that changes things. As soon at that password pops up I scraped it right away. Didn’t know that it worked like that.
---
I’m running a unyielding AP sentinel set currently. I think it’s great. It also works for pve since it’s not tied to player damage like assassins.
---
PC?
---
I'm assuming he's talking about how the increased number of dailies is supposed to only last through the 20th
---
And this, folks, is the reason why bloodied needd a nerf, or other weapons need to be buffed. Game beung unplayable without using that   one build is not a good sign of balance.
---
Level 15 you can start wearing it. 
---
There is a quest at level 30 where you can build a nice one. 
---
Also the main overseer quest if you follow will give it at some point. 
---
Hope that isn’t to specific?
---
Not familiar with GamePass - if you're on PC find me Friday or saturday and I'll see if there's any gear I can hook you up with.
---
I think you can start finding raider power armor pieces as low as lvl. 15. At level 25, you can do a quest in the ash heap to get a full set of the excavator power armor
---
Yes, is a game set I the wasteland not real life. So who care how other players play? Ffs the SJW trying to have everyone to sit around the fire anf sing happy songs.
---
Anyone who defends dupers should share their fate.  
---
What dont you get about 'we dont want cheater period'
---
Please stick to single player games thanks.   This game is NOT for you.
---
You need to be in game for that setting to show.
---
Yes, just need to upload through a image hosting site
---
For all the times i accidently kill legendaries to fast, im sorry everyone
---
I just got the blood eagle icon, will i make it to 100
---
15 is lowest you can wear PA. You can do a quest at level 25 to get the plans to make a set plus the station. You can run around with a chassis on though.
---
Wiki says it doesn't
---
Yes. Did you ever find the tourist?
---
Not at all. The weeklys will be about 3 levels in the later tiers
---
Someone tested it awhile back and no one has to put in the code to open it. I don't know if that's been fixed or nor yet.
---
I do the same, Building team is my go to, if I feel like spamming events I join or make an Events public team.
---
Not everyone runs with the sentinel prefix
---
Stealth Boys are a thing in NW.
---
Can I put walls on top?
---
The DR buff was debunked via datamines quite a while ago. Duping causes server instability, devalues ingame items and achievements. Handing out the best weapons isn't doing people a favour, it's stealing the experience of playing from them. And they having the fucking nerve to act like they're some sort of revolutionary heroes. Also, the time spent dealing with this shit is time not being spent on new content or fixing the existing stuff.
---
Deep Pockets for the arms are currently in the PTS.
---
Of course you can, just everyone will consider you a totall dickbag
---
You cant always trust in wiki ;) Trust the gamers.
---
This long.
---
so because it's so slow would you say you can spam collect more waters with the well than the pump?
---
if so, still might be a good addition to camp.
---
The truth is that players lost nothing from these bans. We don’t need legacy weapons or god rolled fixers everywhere. 
---
Any weapon is powerful enough to one shot monsters if you build around it.
---
Until July 20th
---
There's something missing in some people that allows them to act this way. Some people just want to cause anger, disruption, fights and arguments and its sad to see.
---
In future if anyone is dropping something for another player, stand directly on top of the bag until they're in position to pick it up.
---
You can't loot a bag that someone is standing on, so if someone else tries to steal it, just pick it up in First Person and trade it if you have to.
---
Because there's so many players racing for xp, and event teams are so popular, they don't stay on the map very long as people race to one shot the bosses and move on.
---
It goes until the 20th
---
I'm around 145 and I still swap points pretty often. I'll get some new gear, mutation, perk card I hadn't noticed before, and then switch things up to fit with that.
---
I like light roleplay (that's what she said) so I go with stuff that suits my characters story, even if it's not the best thing going, because that's more fun for me than the whole min/max thing.
---
Agree on doing both. Dailies are much faster on my main (lately takes 20-40 minutes to complete), so I’m knocking those out first. With that out of the way, I’ll switch back to a low lever character for the Double XP.
---
I dunno man, it’s a big release. I have no idea why you’re being so hostile, it’s just that I don’t understand why they would put out a double xp weekend when other stuff is coming out. It’s kind of like when Fortnite released their new season on TLOU2’s release date and the twitch viewership and player base suffered massively for it .
---
I'm level 48 and have grinded a lot.  But even so EVERY game battle pass should be causal.  Everyone I've played so far has been causal but achievable
---
They so NOT drop as legendary from any legendary monster.   
---
The ONLY way to get them if from purvayor.   Same with the fixer.
---
I’m pretty sure it has, I used it to power my garage door, and nobody has closed it yet, either it’s fixed or all that have come to my base are just nice people
---
As above I've a magic quad double barrel it absolutely wrecks, you can see the jump on the queen every time I hit her but vats can be weird some time you can point blank miss over and over have to come out of vats and back in terrible in a fire fight
---
The one you build starts at 25 I believe
---
You missed the context huh? He said level 50 isn’t hard to reach and that’s true. But you don’t get level 5 unlocked at level 50.
---
I've got a bloodied heavy weps guy, a junkie's shotgunner, and an instigating stealth sniper.  They can all kill anything without breaking a sweat.
---
Get gud n00b.
---
Just last night my friend and I helped some lower level players with One Violent Night. Another high level jumps in right at the end, one shots it, and just give ya the heart emotion when everyone thumbs downed him. Why be that person?
---
The question is, does that person care at all bout what random strangers on a VG think about it? Yeah that's right. If it was my case, no I wouldn't care at all
---
I work every weekend, so I’d be happy with the occasional Double XP Tuesday.
---
This lomg
---
What an absolute tool. That sucks man, but good on ya for helping the new guy out. I definitely have had help here and there in my time in the waste land, and I try to do the same. Usually the only thing holding me back is never having any loose screws to mod weapons for them. I’m always out, got thousands if not tens of thousands of everything else. But nooooooo!  Not those! I don’t get how a modded weapon takes what 50 screws to build but when you scrap a weapon you get zero!?
---
I don't find adhesive as bad as some of the other items - I've got 30 odd bulk adhesive (I only really noticed how much was actually there the other day) so started selling it in my vendor.  There's lots of glue and duct tape around if you look through all the little towns/houses/factories etc.. 
---
I used to worry about it but quickly found myself overloaded with it as soon as I started making a note of looking around for it.
---
Nope I go to all the places you can find them and they never show up idk if it’s because I play in a group with my fiancé or what but the tourist never shows up
---
I have Imgur and log in with my Google account, quick and easy, drag and drop the image to the webpage once you've clicked New Post then add a title and share to the community. 
---
Then on the left tool bar in the middle find the social icon and choose reddit, it will give you a link in a pop up you can copy and paste into the *link* option in your post.
---
Thank you sm
---
Thank you sm too
---
Which will be plenty. From here on in you need a level a day pretty much.
---
Yeah they will probably be gone when they give the account back but who knows this a new way to ban.
---
I think you completely missed the point of the post? It’s not that they’re drawing in players, it’s that they’re making a lot of playstation players choose between GoT or the double xp weekend, and 76 will suffer a hit in the amount of players on ps4 for it. Double XP weekends are more important than ever due to SCORE, and I don’t think people understand that. I think those that see it as completely fine are probably the same people that will purchase ranks with their own money.
---
So you just want to watch the world burn?
---
I suppose there isn’t, for you, since you’re a selfish prick. 
---
And bold of you to assume I have problems with events. I don’t. I also have no problem allowing others to participate. I’m solo at an event? One shot everything. Other people are there? Nerf my damage and tag everything, it takes me 1 second to do that. It’s not hard not to be a prick.
---
I like your story. Your high-level and offer help to low-levels, great! This is something quite refreshing for me in games. Im level 97 now
---
Id like to share 3 stories iv experienced the last month that has more of the high-level douch in them. Rare, but here they are:
---
1. I accidentaly hit a robot in Whitespring because a ghoul was attacking it, now the whole whitesprings robot crew turned red on me. I was gunned down gunned down by the robots after some hiding and running. But I was full of loot.
---
Now what did I see? There was this guy just standing watching this spectacle, fair enough. But then the player stole my loot and wanished. Im a grown person, I just cant fathom why people would steal in a game?? Lol
---
2. I had claimed a workshop to get some steel. And im not greedy, just needed some. This day, a level 200 something with cloack and and high-tech weapons wanted to kick me out and he shoot me straight down. However, I respawn, and he probably wouldnt know that I had my legendary baseballbat ready. I got some good swings in and got him! Now I knew hed get mad. So I hid inside the next room and had a look out for the workshop. Now the level 200 was more careful and snuck around the area. But again I caught him by suprise and took him down with an automatic plasma rifle! The joy was huge. By then I knew he would probably win a 3+ encounter, so I left.
---
3. I meet a level 195 on an event that started shooting random players. I responded to his insults, and suddenly had a duel going on amids a lot of spectating players. He killed me twice for no good reason. I did however respawn a third time because my build have a high-dmg output. I took a 10mm sub and acctually woped his ass. A lot of players witnessed and came to the scene of his loot bag. Here is an very interesting detail that im not so conform about. These other players where quick to steal both his and mine loot bags. What a bunch of scavengers 4 real. 
---
To summarize, the joy of punishing douchy higher level players is huge :)
---
If your gonna play hard you have to kick upwards, not downwords. Its called self respect.
---
&gt;They won't show up unless you do the initial quest for them.
---
Yeah that'll be a hard pass from me. A community that continues to support a blatantly anti-consumer product despite knowing that they've been repeatedly lied to isn't really one I want to be associated with.
---
Yes, it works full range. Been using the napalmer for months, it's the only way for non-explosives
---
I see them everywhere but because they are generally considered worthless even as scrap they just get ignored. The result is when you actually want to pick one up you can never recall where the fixed spawns are.
---
Clearly, because you replied to OP and he posted about campfire tales.
---
Did not know. Thanks for the info. Been making it rain on the purveyor &amp; still no luck.
---
Ya the queen stays the same. He might have been ill informed about it.
---
Unyielding sentinel with action point refresh is god gear.
---
So I read that it doesn't work while crouching. This changes a lot for me.
---
You could always picture that player to be a raider player character. That is actually pretty cool considering the setting and lore of the game.
---
Total douchebag behavior yes, but fitting to the game nonetheless.
---
I am on ps4 and did a Queen run last night.  We had a good amount of higher levels.  As far as your title goes they did break the rules but I don't think that duping is over and the same thing won't happen again.  What would be good for the community is to fix the things that are broken in the game like adrenaline, etc.  I have never duped and I have no idea how to and would never want to learn.  I would not be surprised if I had a duped weapon in my stash but I don't think I do.  Hopefully a lot of those accounts under investigation do not get perma banned and we will see some of these players back.  But, the rules are the rules and if your gonna do stuff like that you will eventually get caught.
---
It was a lot of building teams, yes.
---
I had the scrapper perk on a low level character because I had no other good cards to put in for that spot at the time. It wasn't until after I hit 500+ steel in about 10 minutes just from low level scrapping of weapons etc. that I realized how much it actually gives. Ended up using it to scrap masses of steel, bulked it and sold to a vendor...was a great way to earn caps fairly early.
---
Ahhh I get bored and tend to move camps every 10ish levels. My rule is if I find I spot I'm absolutely in love with, i can move there.
---
Right not chilling on a bridge on Route 64 by the Morgantown station, pretty great tbh
---
Thing is I don't care. Is a game ffs. People can do whatever they can and unless they are hacking or griefieng you in the worst way, this kind of stuff shouldn't matter at all.
---
If I let actions of  stranger on  game I play to enjoy affect me, I shouldn't be playing then after all
---
Thank you, I'll try it out.
---
I have a Vampiric, non explosive, I use the standard nozzle. But if I could boost its damage, I would be even happier :)
---
The Ms Nanny at Aurum in the Whitesprings vendor strip usually sells one or two.
---
A good majority of people don’t need a team to kill anything on the map with the exception of the SB Queen. All we really need is bodies on the team for the bonus so no matter your level, you being on the team is helpful.
---
I have a bunch of broken ones on me. I find them all the time.
---
You can get a chassis at level 1
---
Can’t stick armor on till 15, and only one ‘brand’
---
No cap on XP gains from INT, but some things have XP caps—some events seem to cap at 4000 and others at 6000.
---
Worst idea of the day
---
I agree with you.  When you think about it with the right perks, mutations, and chems you can be pretty OP with a non legendary weapon.  There really is no reason to dupe.
---
No, it’s just that they did the double xp weekend on the exact day Ghost of Tsushima was releasing. A chunk of playstation players will miss out on double XP, something that is now more important than ever due to score, but for some reason people can’t seem to comprehend that trying to play tug-of-war with your player base isn’t consumer friendly. This is a genuinely confusing community filled with cynics and those with stockholm syndrome.
---
That'd make using PA convenient.
---
I play an hour a day and hardly played at all last weekend and I’m level 2 levels in front of the curve on this and have today’s daily’s and 4 of the weekly ones left to do. A level a day from here on in will get me over the line. I think when I get a weekend to actually spend a few hours playing I’ll finish the job with about a week to spare. It’s really not hard and most of the things to do you auto complete as u play. Killing legendarys. Level up. Kill creatures etc.
---
It does not, for me as a stealth commando bloodied build I use it as an extra cushion. If I do get in a danger situation I know if I’m standing I can take a couple extra hits, plus count on serendipity and dodgy to take the rest. Definitely doesn’t always work though.
---
Yeah but I dont wanna screw with everything just because the CAMP lines are hard to see, ya feel
---
Halloween and Christmas rewards are unlocking too. Fyi for those interested. Double XP weekend is the perfect time
---
Omg. Odin would never approve. Odin was a nice God in the mythology
---
exactly
---
To be fair everyone needed the masks regardless of their level.
---
Yeah everything is viable, I'm doing an explosive build currently with grenade launchers and rocket luanchers.
---
Only gun is a guass pistol.
---
I only do the event when it spawns in the location all the way to right. Closest to the savage divide. That spot has a better chance not to be bugged. 
---
Also, it seems like you can only do the event once a day. After that they glitch and spawn empty.
---
Yes, 4000 xp is the max you can get from any one activity / kill.
---
No need to search. Just go to https://nukacrypt.com.
---
They don’t have to, but generally big releases aren’t messed with, really. It’s more of a consumer friendly thing, and I’m sure people’s SCORE are going to suffer because of it. Double XP is pretty important now due to the SCORE feature, but people are going to miss out on it.
---
Did you ever unlock the personal terminal from the atomic shop? The big, tall blue one?
---
If Bethesda were selling physical goods and not digital hiding behind a TOS the size of the bible they would have been taken down by a class action suit a long time ago.
---
Ok cool then I know to stop adding XP effects
---
Spiked&gt;bladed
---
Oh no doubt, I certainly hope they fixed it. I'll have to see what I can do about testing that one real quick.
---
So I'm not sure the pylon works. I had my shop closed behind a garage door because max caps. The vending machines were off and behind a garage door. But, a public team member went to my camp and bought 2 8k items by simply opening the passworded pylon. He then gave me a fucking heart and thumbs up.
---
Im glad I was able to actively participate in a vendor like yours. I'm about 150 and my only reason to play was to get the season done. I have no desire to do much else, but I found a shop much like yours. Lots of free things and super cheap stuff. I'm talking free purified water, a bunch of 1cap nuka cola flavours, and even a few offered cheap mutations, good ones like marsupial, regen, and twisted muscles(for the melee boys out there) and I thought it was cool as shit. I grabbed a couple drinks, and a water, and the owner showed up. He was like 280.
---
I emoted a few times, dropped some of my extra food stuffs, cram, blamo, salisbury steak, etc, and some of my nuka collection (I use nuka perk, and solely heal/hydrate from nuka) and he emoted back.
---
He sent me a message(Xbox) and was delighted to find someone like me who wasn't out to essentially steal everything not nailed down. I told him my visit to 76 is temporary, running the season board game, and I'm going back to other games while I wait for legendary perks. I happened to show up, and have like 120 nukas, though I would share.
---
TL;DR- I helped a guy like you, hope it encourages more people to be like you.
---
Yup, it's eye-opening.  
---
I yanked a bloodied explosive gatling gun off my first SBQ &amp; after testing that badboy out swapped from being a rifleman to a heavy weps guy.
---
Assuming you're out of power armor start trying to collect pieces of unyielding armor.  Each piece can give up to +3 all SPECIAL other than endurance.  With 30 agility you'll be almost undetectable, and with 30 PER your vats will be hyper accurate.  The STR boost will give you a lot of carry weight.
---
On the other hand, steel can quickly accumulate in huge quantities with scrapper and just whatever weapons you pick up from kills in no time...wouldn't have to do any farming at all, just whatever you happen to pick up along the way while playing.
---
You can build a level 15 raider PA if you know the plans (i do).
---
seems like they are ramping up again.
---
My friend and i went to a nuke zone last night and we couldn't kill the queen because we were both melee and everyone was lower level.
---
I switched to my main tune and we got her to \~1% before failing. :( sad days
---
It's hard to have a vending machine up, since half the time I'm running around with close to max caps
---
I can assure you we're not watching you.
---
It literally says on the game's title screen how lomg the double xp 'weekend' will last and we're getting downvoted for treating thos post with all the dignity it deserves. Never knew plankton had herd mentality.
---
It happens after enemies are killed and turn into goo or ash piles. They seem to take a bit longer to respawn than regular kills and for some reason tend to appear as naked and/or headless, unkillable ghosts. Sometimes you’ll see them hovering over their goo pile. 
---
Sadly it’s more common lately, lots of duped Gatling plasmas being used.
---
The thing is that here you will read only read the "extremes" of gameplay experience, the worst and the best basically. But since frustration makes you much more inclined to vent and post here, positive experiences rather make you keep playing the game instead of closing it, opening reddit and writing how awesome the game is. That's why online reviews of basically anything should always be taken with a grain of salt.
---
Yes, having no text chat sucks in my eyes, too. Many other complaints about bugs, poor mechanics and so on definitely hold true, either. Still there is also the other side of the game, which is harder to describe because it's not connected to single events, it's more the whole picture of advancing your character, exploring the world, collecting resources etc. which to some people can be very enjoyable and motivating and does make up for the inconveniences those players are experiencing, too, no doubt. 
---
If there are criteria for a game which exclude FO76 for you right away, fine. Everyone has different preferences. But in the end I can only say that no amount of reading reviews and forums can replace testing a game for yourself.
---
Spiked
---
I mean, er, i don't think they're watching you.
---
Chassis @ lvl 1. First armor you can add requires lvl 15 if you find the low lvl one or someone makes it for you.
---
I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the info!
---
I would go Anti-armour every time to offset targets DR which at times can result in big boosts. Bleed damage is really only good if the base damage is low and the bleeding stacks, but with a 2h melee you'll be wanting the minimum number of big hits.
---
Well guess I’ll try it with a friend when I got time then. Thanks for the heads up.
---
😬😑😂😂🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Yea even with out the broken vats, my melee attacks also need a few more hits to register. Even when the dmg number pops up. It's annoying especially like you say. Scorched deathclaw. I punched her 4 times, dmg number pops up no health drops and that fucker one hits me. Respawn and again. That's why I always have a projectile side weapon now on my side just in case.
---
Seems likely.
---
Scorchbeasts (and other large/huge enemies) is just one source of XP :) I getting 2k a kill from high level super mutants, and we all know how many of them can be found around the map in big hordes.
---
On a pc
---
It's fine just not great at range without a magic effect.
---
Get the personal terminal from the atom shop (don't worry it's free) and you can start the misc quest to get a camera from the terminal.
---
I have the Faschnact robot, and that thing provides me with so many gum drops, snack cakes, apples, gum, etc. I love it. Plus a lot of alcohol for Biv dailies. FINALLY got the Nuka Dark recipe.
---
that's exactly what a synth would say
---
There are comments all the time on reddit about how great the fo76 player base is and I’ve definitely seen magnanimity on occasion (incl your follow up to this situation). Unfortunately, I see far more 1-shot ahole types. It feels like there’s always one at any given event so you’re never really able to just take things slowly for the benefit of others.
---
Fasnacht was the best example of this. Occasionally you’d have a group with no bad apple and everyone would make the come here emote and ensure everyone tagged the legendary sloth at the end. It’d be all thumbs up and smiles. *Most* of the time, though, there’d be someone in their high 100s making a game out of trying to kill it as fast as possible because others’ disappointment was their joy. 
---
I used to do Fasnacht every waking hour of every day for a while. Out of the maybe 100 Fasnachts I ran, only 10 were the feel good help each other type and the other 90ish were sloth races. It became the norm.
---
Also, anecdotally, I think it’s getting worse. Uranium Fever used to be run cooperatively a majority of the time. Lately, I’ve stopped prioritizing it because I only ever seem to walk out with 2 legendaries max. I never used to see people throw the thumbs down emoji in there but now it’s pretty frequent.
---
Didn’t miss anything, they’re still called legendary perks for a reason.
---
Nope, been getting 6k from quests and events.
---
If you are on PC i can give you set of lv15 raider PA. I crafted it for someone and at the end he didn't show up to pick it up.
---
I got 2 bloodied chars and a junkie. Each of them carry 8 weps. They only have their fixers, handmades and 10mm pistols (for tagging) in common. Otherwise its pretty diverse. My main uses a mixed bloodied build with perk sets for melee, shotgun, commando, heavy and bow. My wheel is full most of the time.
---
Yeah but he was talking about the special one you get from doing that quest
---
Worth it to me on two accounts. Is it worth it to you? That'll be up to you. You can always get a one month and try it out.
---
Build the Pc at you camp and it can automatically locate the tourist for you

I’ve been a 1st subscriber on PS4 since January and I can no longer imagine playing without my tent.  So many times my butt has been saved by dropping that thing in the road before I enter an area.  It’s great having a place to dump scrap or even just respawn out of the madness.  I don’t like monthly drains so I just ate the $100 up front since I already loved the game and knew I’d play for a while.
---
Yup, I have a little route :)
---
Yeah, I hate that you have to have their furniture setup at your camp to use them... I built a jazz bar at my camp, and would love to have Beckett as the bartender, but his little booth just doesn't quite fit what I'm going for now lol  
---
and I second that being able to place junk... I need some bottles of booze around my bar dammit!
---
Yes. The fall damage reduction is so minimal I'd be surprised if you even notice it. Even with rank 2 Goat Legs and two Cushioned legs you won't be immune to fall damage and I have found that you're still pretty likely to die from great heights. 
---
If you're using the SSA jetpack I always recommend getting two Acrobats legendary pieces. The whole point of the jetpack is for improved mobility so you might as well go all the way with it. Some people argue that you can time your jetpack usage to avoid fall damage but I feel that's too much of a headache and you lose out on it's full potential. It's as much of a game changer having zero fall damage and a jetpack as it is going from default hops to Marsupial jumps.
---
Email to input a single question on a small survey? Nty. I have enough experience to know imputing your email anywhere will send junk mail.
---
for best board you need legendary board to really experience board... 
---
booooooard.... boooooard it big it heavy it wood
---
boooooooard booooard better than bad, it good
---
people lurk around after the event to see what people drop and scavenge it. you see it at tons of event. this is why you never just drop something around others as its inviting scavengers. and script hunters. invite him to a party or send a messege to him first.
---
It’s optional, I didn’t have to put it in,
---
Ack I thought I had changed it to optional
---
No.
---
I think they’re the same but it doesn’t matter which gives more. I can always get enough on the first try but the water well looks a lot better.
---
You should be to log into it and select an entry for a "suspicious person". It'll give you a quest marker (and a guaranteed location) for a dead tourist to get started on camera stuff
---
With bonus experience and full set of unyielding armour for the intelligence boost and Building Team bonus, one Level 68 Super Mutant is giving me 729+ experience. So every time I kill 14 Super Mutants I get my 10,000 experience for the weekly repeatable Score bonus.

It takes less time to get 3x weekly Score bonus (30,000 experience) than one of the Nuclear Winter challenges for Score.
---
Board is life.  
---
Wait.. 🤔
---
I couldn’t hit the back button fast enough.
---
Has anyone found a solution. I sided with the Raiders and completed the heist. My rep still goes up with foundation quests but not Raiders?
---
there's always one inside uncanny caverns, set up for a shoot
---
Spiked, armor piercing is superior to bleeding imo.
---
Or let us break down legendaries and have the individual modules, have to buy the legendary plans for the weapon we want, and it increases the chance by how many of the specific modules you have.
---
For instance, if you want the explosive effect, you have to scrap five weapons with it (so no scrip from them) for a 100% roll, because each specific module is an extra 20% chance to get that effect.
---
Any real proof, like a video record with INT testing on same enemies that show that after you take INT boost you get more EXP from same enemy?
---
Nope, I don't want to go down that rabbit hole. Muting people with mics is bad enough. Vault Boy doesn't have to talk, you don't either.
---
I've got over 5k atoms saved since I don't spend them that often. Would even buy these if they're in the shop.
---
I think they give the same amount and I always get enough on the first try. The water well looks a lot better though.
---
I'd look up builds online for your desired builds, But I have a strength build when I move points around alot. I just moved some to get max intelligence for the XP boost. I would say just to start an alt if you have 30 points/perks you have to move/buy. It's more up to you though. I started playing in april and have a level 205 character. and a level 115. The level 115 got most of his XP from last double XP weekend. It's nice to have a fresh start, but more just up to you. I would still definitely look up the builds and there is one site that will allow you to put in perk cards and tell you when you need to buy each card at each level. It's just more up to you.
---
Let's make it easy for you: you can't place that object.
---
I have a 30min route myself. I do all fissure sites first, then all super mutant locations, then couple huge enemies spawn spots, then ghouls in whitespring golf club and charleston capital building. At this point fissure sites have respawned and i do them again and log off for 20minutes to wait for my private server to compelely reset. Log in with 30minutes left on all my buffs rinse/repeat.
---
O didn’t see that it was optional. Well it’s a turn off to people who don’t see that. It’s hard to read small print for me.
---
Had this yesterday the whole fight.
---
"brotherhoood eh.... not sure... maybe i should stay here, yea, gunna stay here"
---
One thing the recoil works with is when you get a big creature like a deathclaw or sloth getting right up close, aim low and go full auto and the recoil will pull you right up the body into the head...so much damage.
---
I have a quad explosive (I think it is) and it's great fun.
---
Heh, had an event pop last night, "Yao guai horde", hmm, nah.
---
Power fist is much better. But unless you are fighting the queen it doesn't much matter as they'll both kill stuff. And unless you are fighting the queen by yourself it's really ok if you do a little less dmg.
---
Glad to help! I have a Furious. Never miss a pack of cigarettes anymore, lol. You end up using a lot of asbestos. But it's worth that minute it takes.
---
That you can test yourself. Pop a mentat, thats 2 INT.
---
You see bigger numbers because when you are killing stuff at the same time when event/quest finishes the xp amount will add up. Thats why you see bigger numbers.
---
Yea you did. I didn’t see it sorry.
---
it is set to optional
---
this is the way
---
Happens to me a lot. Was grinding uranium fever and decided I would signal everyone in the event over to kill a three Star legendary and one lvl 300 player came and one shotted him. Didn’t even get any loot :(
---
Yaaaaas. Just got like 4K XP for killing a legendary scorchbeast 😍
---
No, just buy my stuff. I need stash space. Buy stuff you don't need and scrap it. I don't care. Everything must go!
---
Not sure, I didn’t do anything special, just kept trying and kept doing the dailies and choosing either “another body in the wasteland” or w/e with rocksy or “keep them for free” or w/e with Wren and now I’m about two dailies away from done with Raiders after not playing for a while. Just started moving after a couple days, Dont know if a hotfix fixed it or if it fixed itself. Done already with settlers.
---
Thank you my good man!
---
I'll edit my OP to make sure everyone knows it is optionial
---
What?! Well, what sort of chance does that give me? All right! I am a Synth!
---
orrrrr maybe those fixes would be more trouble than they're worth?  
---
like what's your idea of a solution to this?
---
Nope, one was a queen of the hunt handin.
---
Do I put the link in the title or the subject?
---
It's horribly annoying. What I find sometimes works is to slow down the button clicking a little bit. Doesn't work all the time, but it does most.
---
eso have superior servers, that's all I wanna for fo76, stronger and beef servers.
---
I’ve re-allocated about six so far.  I maxed out my Perception before I could get Master Rifleman but outside of that it’s only been small tweaks here and there.
---
so many lost opportunities, Bethesda.
---
Yes. There are several videos on youtube. And it is not hard to test yourself. Go to a spot with several same name, same level enemies. Kill one and record the xp you got. Then pop a Berry Mentat (+5 int), or increase your int by some other method and kill another.. Int increases the xp by 2%/point.
---
Any real proof OP? Why cant you trust the 50+ posts on here, and multiple comments replying to you about it?
---
Really cool I’ll go build a Pc and go get the camera thanks
---
there are some fair points of discussion.  my gripe comes in the form of thematic discontinuity.  wouldnt it be great if, the overaching theme played out in the game experience?
---
  for example, having unique events (or event modifiers and/or add'l goals), rewards aligned to a central concept (eg no ghillie suits in space, no space suits in the jungle), seasonally related enemies (eg flatwoods monster spawns more often or unique variant (ala xmas scorched), culminating in a unique once-a-year-only event.   another poster recommended (i cant rember the name) suggested using layered goals for later stages (the example given was, after stage 28, wearing/using the outfit given to kill certain thematically tied in monsters or increasing ranks/numbers of them)
---
generally, the tasks system was neat when it was introduced, but i was hoping when they said "more impactful to the way you play" that'd it'd become adaptive.  that is to say, if i never play vault 51, then those kinds of challenges wouldn't show up.  my guess, as they say, is that "the tech isn't there"
---
finally, the content i'd like to see is more along the lines of the alcohol update.  new quests, items, recipies, locations and characters.  idk, we'll see what happens when the BOS shows up.  now if they could just tie up a whole season into biv-style updates....wouldnt it be great?
---
I price everything super cheap otherwise it feels like it never sells. The only things that seem to move at a fair price for me and them are serums.
---
Yeah. Or if they did 15% each and you can get up to 75% per effect so you still rely on some RNG but not too much. 
---
That would be (3/4)^3 for all 3 effects if we craft the weapons rather that rely on the perveyor so of this was armour or the gauntlet or fixer it would be 27/64 chance to get what you want. That's 42% per attempt so even with RNG and 75% chance you've still got a much better chance at exactly what you want then
---
No. You’re be better off with this routine if you can take down Scorchbeasts efficiently: 
---
Huntersville, NIRA, WestTek - Super Mutants are the best bang for your XP buck. 
---
Then run all the Fissure Sites on the east side of the map—SB’s are big XP and there’s usually a horde of scorched there too. 
---
By the time you’re done with the Fissure Sites, enough time will have passed that the Super Mutants should respawn, so rinse and repeat, generally no server hop required.
---
OMG I love you for suggesting the deletion of legacy weapons everyone down votes me when I suggest it.
---
For what it’s worth, I’m not complaining about the level ups themselves - as I say, it’s easy enough to get around if you need to. But if people are using workarounds to do a challenge (“Why level my main from 95 to 96 for 3 hours when I can make a new character, level from 1-3 in 15 minutes, then delete it”), that challenge design probably needs rethinking. Though obviously it wouldn’t be a problem if they removed the time gating; “Level 7 times over the week” would be far more enjoyable.
---
I’m still not sure the daily logins drive Bethesda’s monetisation either. They presumably do have the data on this. But will 7x daily logins really drive that much more revenue than 3x for longer periods? Don’t know, but given other games follow a slightly different model (allowing completion of historical challenges, or allowing all challenges to complete over a week, say) it’s not a requirement of the model. Maybe it does and we’ll have to live with it, but it’s still an actively bad game design choice. Maybe it feeds into the buy-ranks option the next few weeks too. Ugh.
---
Honestly, this is the big one for me, and I hope they re-examine it for future seasons. Selfishly, as a soon to be parent, I am conscious my daily time is limited, and I’m going to have to schedule my gaming time in the very near future!
---
Glad we agree on the mode split though, that one baffles me!
---
Well that's kinda how an MMO should be, dude. Equal access to items for everyone. And btw the amount of atoms ir getting from this event is FAR more than what u get from doing those damn long ass, menial challenges to get a measly 20 to 40 atoms
---
Bro the NSA and CIA know what people search for. You're not on some list for a game the launches nukes. They are aware. Man they game too
---
haha, true. It's completely unnecessary  to tell me he's "got his eye on me" when I'm fully allied with him and just turned in his equipment for the hundredth time.
---
The key in the basement is not for hornwright hg, its for hornwright estate..
---
That could be that they needed it for the challenge. There’s a challenge to eat pre-war food. Personally, I go hunt for it myself or buy it at Whitesprings. I think low levels need it more than I do. But.... I’m also not an asshole. Lol
---
I wish we could create polls in this subreddit.. it would be really good for dev feedback, too!
---
1.  Is complete BS.    Shooting her have ZERO effect on her AI. 
---
2.  Tents are an issue but ONLY because she cant land near them or it causes her to land above ground at which point the AI goes to the next behavior.  She only has 3,  land, fly over with acid, flutter around. 
---
3.  Maybe try grasping even a rudimentary understanding of how mob AI works in games before spouting off. 
---
4. And this is the biggest one.  NEVER TELL OTHER PEOPLE HOW TO PLAY THEIR GAME. YOU AINT PAYING FOR IT, THEY ARE.
---
This doublely so. I had to find out the hard way that you had to complete the Bucket List quest first. Now I have a ton of them.
---
Good luck to people who will be banned for having legacy weapons Bethesda mistakes for duped items.
---
Wow that’s LOMG!
---
I do play it even alone. Obviously only farm the XP when alone.
---
Tell me about it.
---
I'm sure that I'm forgetting more ridiculous issues too.
---
Oh smiley for me isnt allowing to by gold bullion for 3 weeks now.
---
SQB can't be crippled so it can be forced to land.
---
Ammo converter system is just awful 
---
Favorites wheel is bugged causing you to have blank wheel.
---
What they don't seem to realise is that they can collect ore AND kill ghouls until 30 seconds to go.
---
I’m level 252,  my first kill was at 80.
---
The damage threshold isn’t the issue.
---
Sell "souviners" in your vending machine for 5 caps each. 
---
I use the model robots from the frat house
---
Worked.
---
That's what he's saying, he can't repair all because of the frog in a jar, he wants to be able to repair items but can't due to the lack of 1 material.. for example, 3 walls are broken, and your melon plant is also broken, but because you have some wood, and don't have a melon, you can't use the repair all button.
---
Sometimes people just suck. Voice chat is pretty helpful in this situation. Or have the low level join your team and follow them where they go next. Away from the jerk. Or you could try trade. Sometimes it’s weird. But you can offer them the item at no cost. That way the jerk can’t take it.
---
What was the point of this survey if it only has 1 question. You may as well just ask people to post it here. At least the rest of us would also get to know too.
---
That kinda sounds like a „You“-problem tbh...
---
Same, I think 20% exploit or dup hense the number of posts about being banned.
---
People say they don’t like PvP and this is precisely the reason why it is needed and necessary.  
---
When I see players one shotting or hogging XP I have no problem blasting them into oblivion.  Most of the time I’m on winning end of the exchange, but sometimes I’m not.  Point being, that’s your recourse.  It’s not like there’s some major penalty for dying so if you don’t like what another player is doing then let it rip. 
---
I’ve seen no fewer than 500 posts on this type of a topic.  Players that are selfish.  Players that are dicks.  Whatever.  Just like taking workshops, loot is there for the taking.  It happens.  You drop stuff or put stuff up in your vendor it’s fair game to everyone.   No different than some tool overpricing their worthless shit in their machines. No one is forcing you to buy it.
---
i agree.  having events, or even just certain events &amp; quests drop score points would be cool
---
I havent had a team show up in the last 3 times and when I do farm ore they let the scavengers die so I figure I'm just here for the exp and move on :/ it sucks but so does America
---
Yeah the challenge.
---
Bethesda SAID they fixed it.    So that was a fucking lie.
---
I still haven’t discovered the town that Sals Grinders is in according to triumphs either.
---
I think it is.  The stash box alone has freed up a bunch of space that I now fill with legionaries :)  The amount of atoms you get each month are more than the cost of the subscription.  I buy a lot of repair kits which are very helpful.
---
It’s always a waste to reallocate special points and it’s always worth having five characters for different builds. 5 times every cap limit.
---
They have no way to tell what is duped or not. Better they just delete all of that legacy item instead.
---
That won't work. 
---
There are too many ways to get around locked doors and even then it's pointless as anyone that comes across your camp will still be able to use your vendor.
---
As much as I try to love fallout 76, I read something here every day that encourages me to just not reinstall and give it another go
---
Found mine at the top of the lighthouse
---
They duped b2525 fixers this time. Then they should delete those too, to be safe.
---
Good on you man. I did the same thing for a lvl 22. Full set of heavy bos combat armor lvl 20 fixer modded out. Helped him get the free backpack at the airport as well. Had some dude vulturing when i was dropping it for him though.
---
bruh youre out here writing essays on reddit defending some chump spending ridiculous amounts of money on free DLC. the extent you are will to go to protect obvious shilling is making me think thats its YOU that the one getting had here lmao.'
---
honestly earning this stuff for free has gotten even more rewarding knowing there is a league of morons willing to shell out literal hundreds of dollars for it.
---
later whale, watch out for the harpoons 🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳
---
Okay that is a start
---
Definitely need more display shelves but let's not rush into offering to buy them so fast. A unique shelf like the Thanksgiving display would be a perfect unlockable item to offer next season. They offered some cool things like the ammo converter and clean sink this one, so every new suggestion people have my first hope is for them to be added as a future score reward at tolerable low ranks.
---
Preach it!
---
Viable how exactly?
---
All builds are pretty much viable. Some are tougher to solo end-game events and large mobs but you could go all-in with a food build and still be a killing machine.
---
There are numerous locations in the forest where one can find PA frames with L15 raider armors. Here are some of the earliest locations in the game you can encounter PA spawns:
---
&gt;!Under the west end of the bridge (near the icecream shop) there is a room with a PA stand. The key to the door is in one of the cars on the widowmaker rollercoaster in camden park.!&lt;
---
&gt;!Point pleasant has PA stand that can spawn low level raider PA gear in a garage in the NW corner of town. There is also a possible natural level 40 T60 armor spawn on top of one of the buildings in the NW corner of town. Just the frame and armor, with no PA crafting rack.!&lt;
---
&gt;!The lumbermil you get send to very early on in Duches' questline also has a PA rack that can spawn armor.!&lt;
---
&gt;!Then of course there is the PA rack at Grafton damn that very commonly has random pieces of various tiers of power armor.!&lt;
---
However,  I dont believe i have ever actually seen any PA spawn on a character that was lower than level 10-12.
---
No. How could I resist the succulent flesh of glowing ghouls.
---
I’m sorry bro is too late.
---
Also is fun in NW trying to see the nuke zone.
---
Exactly. And even without using Bloodied or Junkies. 
---
Even just a Vampire’s Gatling Gun makes a difference.
---
It's the reason nobody does it anymore. Nobody has a fucking clue how to play it properly. Same goes for the Project Paradise event.
---
You seem to be right! Tested it. 6k is max for events.
---
Not a good fix, but a workaround on PC is at least disable the grass in the INI file.
---
I did it for performance increase, but the ability to find corpses, outside at least, is huge.
---
Every weekend event goes from Thursday to Monday. Always.
---
We can have both, a free one in the season  as well as a few bundles of 3 scattered across the year.
---
3 displays - 600 atoms.
---
Had this exact same thing happen. It is a win either way. Also had one similar to this were the scorch beast killed them 😆
---
I consider Cores way more impractical. They can not be recharged or fused, hence you have to deal with those almost empty cores all the time.
---
I just did &gt;!excavator!&lt; and could have sworn it said level 30. I could be wrong. 
---
&gt;!Raider!&lt; is the one I was referring to that you get a full set of through &gt;!rose’s quests!&lt;
---
Got 1st, no angels. Same dealio. Disable the grass if you're on PC.
---
mmm, food.
---
Build a personal terminal (free in atomic shop) at your camp. It will tel you exactly where they are on a given server.
---
(shakes shepards crook)
---
it's to build certain things in a camp or workshop. highlight it
---
As some others have stated, our discord group will form public teams- but kick people to make room for friends in our discord. Plus since we're all talking in discord- we only then talk in area in game, so it may seem like we don't have mics.
---
This is awesome.
---
I've just about given up with the event. It's become all about XP and Legendary kils for the PA Heavies and Gauss Shotguns who don't care about treasure notes. Top often I've been the only ore collector amongst 6+ players who won't move an inch out the square but somehow still fail to keep the civvies alive.
---
my fo76market posts were banned because i apparently listed a hacked weapon but they didn‘t tell me which one. turns out it was just a bloodied explosive plasma rifle, which never actually dropped in game. not an obvious hack, since i didn‘t even know that, but yeah. it can suck.
---
I don't think Bethesda needs 'help' on how to fix it. It is always going to be a question of whether spending dev time on fixing something makes more money or saves more money. Until/unless this becomes a way to increase cash flow or it becomes a measurable cost to cash flow it won't be fixed. As with all software this is why things get patched and not necessarily 'fixed' quite often.
---
I'm sure the 'game design' type folks would like things fixed but there will be a 'money' person who will ultimately set the priority.
---
There is a sub page on the challenge that tells you what you need to build, select it and it will shows the requirements
---
Did Bethesda say something about it or OP just assumed it would only be a week?
---
Currently Shotgun Vats builds are pretty good.
---
Int = more xp
---
Currently all shotguns are magical in vats, even non legendaries as far as i can tell.
---
Ya OP edited his post afterward.
---
There is a static spawn of a broken camera in the commentators box at the dirt track racecourse near the county fairgrounds.
---
Stop suggesting stuff that is allready coming in the next few patches as notified by Bethesda.
---
Seems a lot of posts are about things allready planned for. It doesn't take long, nor is it hard, to actually search first or even look at Bethesda site for the game.
---
will the raids come back?
---
I've got it from queen of the hunt and scorched earth so far. 4k is definitely the max on kills. Got the same for a glowing behemoth both with and without lunchboxes.
---
Go to the sub challenge. It tells you exactly what you need to build. Go to the weekly challenge and click on that challenge to see what the 5 criteria are. 
---
From memory:
---
Build 20 lights 
---
Build 5 stairs
---
Build floor 10? Floor decorations
---
Build 5? containers or shelves 
---
Plant crops (maybe? I forget. Anyway, check the challenge screen)
---
Rad rumble is a terrible event for one reason. 
---
1.  All the mobs are level 40 and drop trash legendaries
---
 
---
Thats why no one wants to do it.
---
couse they domt play the game, I really believe since the backlash the game suffered from launch(deserved from the amount of bugs and bad decision) this is a new small crew and they don't know how the spaghetti code works so they learm as they try.
---
 As a low level, my issue is that because of the high level enemies I can’t collect ore without being killed, and it’s even worse since I basically have to wear a radiation suit because of the rads so I have like 0 armor.
---
GamePass is an Xbox One feature where you monthly or yearly to get free games :)
---
I wouldn't count on it
---
Yah i get like 5 to 10 frames in intense battles and i know it cuz of my tons of guns
---
yeah i love the clutter mod for fo4, it adds so much immersion to your build, maybe whitechapel charlie from fo4 or pretty much a bartender vendor, i just want different styles of vending machines to fit with the build
---
Monster Mash doesnt care about pacifist or team. If your teammate has the mask you can kill them. Even if you are both pacifists
---
If we were just talking about bugs and glitches I'd be inclined to agree with you but that isn't the case with 76, although it certainly has them. The issue is that this is a product that launched in a state that was completely inferior to what was promised. This is a company that lied to you about micro transactions being purely cosmetic. This is a company that lied to you about the season pass. This is a company that promised better communication while simultaneously nerfing things without saying a word. Oh and let's not forget that they even lied about the preorder bonus before the game even came out, and then just hoped that people wouldn't notice their bait and switch. I could continue since the list of lies they've told is significantly longer than what I've put here but I think you get the point. 
---
If people want to support a product that has bugs then fine, that's their choice. But when people support a product that has consistently raised a middle finger to their customer base since its release they send a message that developers can get away with it, and that's bad for all consumers. If you support devs that release games like fo76, Battlefront, COD (which I've been guilty of previously), or basically 99% of mobile games you're actively taking place in setting a precedent that fucking over consumers in the name of profit is acceptable behavior. If it wasn't acceptable behavior then the game would be dead because people would be speaking with their wallets instead of complaining on the internet to a company that couldn't care less about your words since they already have your money.
---
I literally saw a 2 star mutant fixer for 9500. Smh.
---
It is a bitch
---
You use more ammo trying to get her to land which means you run out of ammo quicker.
---
When you're running low on ammo you have to farm more ammo. This takes time. Time that you'll spend playing the game.
---
The more time people spend playing the game, the better the game. According to Bethesda.
---
I just want the foundation to actually go fully into the ground, especially when you don't have flat terrain to work on. Either that or allow it to be build within foundation tiles like it's flat ground. 
---
The snapping thing would be nice but the prefabs usually aren't build to the standard tile size so there can be complications with snapping.
---
Elaborate.
---
Raider armor is your choice, nice sets around the map like at new river forge bridge west but needs the key form Camden park. Also the power armor station isn’t unlocked until completing miner maricles, which I think needs you to be level 25.
---
My bloodied spiked board is pretty nice.
---
my advice is if someones a cancerous piece of shit, block them to never end up with them again, maybe report them for expliting if they are using the "rare" explosive laser/plasma weapons to achieve said 1shot but at the very least block them so they have one less server to connect to.
---
if enough people do this they will be more likely paired up with others equally as cancerous for the rest of their days.
---
I had one too. I was sooooo pissed🤬
---
&gt;this generation with its self entitlement 
---
I've played plenty of grindy games. At least they have new and consistent content to make the grinds fun. Fallout seems to be missing that aspect, which is why people are complaining.
---
I haven't been spamming the craft button, but I will try a different way next time to slow down the crafting.
---
NW isn't about racking up the most kills. It's about being the last person standing.
---
If that can be achieved without firing a shot, even better.
---
I know they have why i said less common but most of the ones ive played dont have this obsesion with locking stuff behind once a day  leads to intense boredom with nothing to do
---
Subject
---
Angry Turtle is running 72 int... 2.5k xp super mutants.. christ..
---
That's definitely more realistic, given this is a game where it's pretty common to miss multiple 95% VATS shots in a row, but since we're just daydreaming, I'd prefer a route to a sure thing, even if it's a long one.
---
I'm looking at it as if I was to grind for a max scrip plan, and to get 15 specific modules, just to hit on that 5% miss because RNG, I'd be done.
---
Because is a centenial... if they dint see in youtube or social media...dont exist
---
I found her a few times.  Once was by some of the coin operated binoculars near the temple.   Another time she was at the cemetery with the buried with honor daily.  Both times she was dead, so it was odd she moved.   She has a green shirt and blue visor.  Her name is Anne or Annie.
---
Wait so where are people going on the board atm?   
---
I have missed few days and I currently am close getting the second power armor paint. How many rewards I could have at most and is there any way to get at least 75% of all rewards at this point? Some people are like talking they have everything now and some say we are halfway and Haven't even crossed the first dotted line on the map.   
---
I hope Bethesda gives everyone opportunity to get all rewards,   
---
as some of us have to go to work and school and have like 0.5-1h/day to play at best. It's super disgusting to create stuff to do only for those who play 10h/day as they don't have school nor job.
---
dang ps4 and all those xbox gamepass people!
---
Ikr i just saw someone try to sell me a nocturnal lvl 25 pipe gun
---
I didn’t know arrows become community after shot. I’ll stop picking them up. Thanks for the heads up!
---
My first one was 1 star then the next one I crafted was a 3 star, refresh AP and lock picking, i don't care about the lock pick.
---
&gt; It has unlimited capacity 
---
That's never happening with an online game.
---
Can confirm it works with concrete thanks mate!
---
Best for a medic /support play style at end game
---
Nice. I've managed about 2.1k for them with every buff going.
---
I got both FW from friends that didn't run heavy guns. I haven't done Beckets Quest yet so when I do I'll have 3. I did Raider Punk &amp; Sophia.
---
Yes, you can stack 4 of them. I do it on my private server. If you or someone else opens 5th it will screw up the buff.
---
Thank you for the link!

I wish I could farm lead and gunpowder without leaving my camp like you CAN for adhesive.  
---
Why not just run an adhesive farm. ??    Would have taken you less time to set one up than type out this drivel.
---
No. You’re
---
Complaining because you have misguided math and don’t want to work towards a reward. Play the game. Enjoy and you’ll get your reward. Don’t. Spend your time here bitching and whining it’s to hard. You won’t. Simple really
---
I suspect Bethesda gave '76 to the "B" Team from the start. It simply does not evidence the talent that went into the great Fallout games. That said, I love it. It's a Fallout wasteland I can muck about in as the mood takes me. True, enjoyment requires more imagination on my part than the game developers came up with. But, hey, I loved the old MUD games. I loved the real Fallout games. When I have time to waste, I waste it in the wasteland.
---
it needs something to keep doing after finishing, even if you just reapt the same 5-10 currency rewards, cuz if you 100 now, going to take forever
---
Are you sure you're actually following the challenge goals?
---
Ah I was trying to figure out how those worked. I tried using conduits and such but they didn't seem to power anything. Had them all along some narrow platforms on the second floor and up against the walls, but no go.
---
Alright it's up,thanks for the advice
---
What? I'm talking about FO1ST **SCRAPBOX** not stash box. You could there any amount of scrap.
---
*points everywhere* but seriously most bloodied builds 1 shot just about everything like why would you want to play whasts effectively a 1 hit sim
---
I doubt Bethesda would ever give a guarantee. Maybe if there was a way to add as many modules as you want but they give diminishing returns so you never reach 100% but get close to 90% or something. Or just the 5 with 75% chance since you could grind for ages and never get whay you want but get enough to get it from the 75% example even form the perveyor
---
Well shit, i've been farming with only one lunchbox active for about 5 hours now lol. Thanks for the answer.
---
I didn't realise they were so difficult to craft, I'll drop them into my venders for free from now on, I usually leave a bag in whatever station I'm at but that's not forced to be there for long.
---
I have a decent # for intelligence with this character, but i will do a combo of intel drinks, food and drug the next time to see how that works. Thanks
---
You people are obnoxious.
---
Are you sure your friend didn't just get the 'suspended pending investigation' email that the other folks here have gotten?
---
Its backwards for me. I sided with raiders to complete the heist then after it was completed Foundation is the only one I can get the reputation to increase on!? I thought at first it was just undetectable because at Friendly rep level for raiders the grind would be slower, but it hasn't moved in over 7 days completing every raider daily including the BlackEye Mirelurk quest donating Mirelurk Queen meat every day. Anyone else still have this problem?
---
Todd Howard " It just works..."
---
I did it last night.   First time around motherlode, some of the green lit containers were empty, but after the next unlocking phase, they did have ore.  I always run around several times collecting ore.
---
Yep that was exactly my experience too
---
They datamined a hanging mask wall decoration display, gonna be good
---
Dude...  Arrows are so damn easy to make tho...  Like holy shit
---
Nope. That’s the generation that wants the world for free. Stop bitching. Get earning. It’s not even hard to do lol
---
You didn’t read anything I posted then and are just outraged over nothing reading is crucial
---
It reduces the odds of getting switched off, and if they switch it off and take you off the map, you have far fewer people coming to your base, except those who stumble upon it.
---
This is better advice. Just hard-wire it with no switches. you're not gonna have time to run back to the fort to switch it off. Take it from experience, when you want to go dark just scrap the wire or store the vending machines if you need extreme measures. locked doors can be glitched through very easily.
---
I'd settle for a ramp or stairs that snap. Got my base all laid out, tried to stagger some foundations as stairs, only to get tge "would be inaccessible" bug. Now there's 3 foundations half stuck in the ground i can't move without relocating my camp. 
---
And all I want is a ramp into my garage.
---
ok bye
---
Yea my business was not going so well while in the forest. Once I moved close to whitespring I started moving product. The Whitespring and near top of the world seem to be the area with the most foot traffic and therefor the best place to set up shop.
---
Well it isn’t as easy for me to need my damage and I refuse to play a watered down game because others refuse to quest and want end game rewards at lv 30 if you’re bold enough to go into the events you take what comes with it
---
I set up shop just before Flatwoods, I price everything super cheap now instead of free to deter people from just taking everything. Of course some still have the caps to do it anyway. Maybe I could do what your brother does an offer supplies by request.
---
From what I remember, I don't think even scrapping the wire will help. You have to scrap the vending machines.
---
GG yes
---
Why not decorate his bar with lights and signs? I was able to put the punchbowl and a fasnacht stein on his counter as decoration. You can also add lights to his bar, some wall signs, probably a lot of other stuff.
---

---
My dude i can name several games like that snd they somehow do fucking fine one of the first come. To mind being wow
---
sorry that was earlier this morning and I was a little saltier than required
---
but it still don't agree with the ideas
---
The problem is that a) This was the day before the pre-war food challenge that everything was bought up. And b) pre-war drinks and donuts don't count for that challenge (I tried). So of all the stuff I had for sale that was bought up only the four Fancy Lads I had for sale would have counted. I wound up having to eat the two pre-war Fancy Lads I had on me yesterday for restocking to satisfy the challenge myself.
---
The problem with the trade option too is it exposes your inventory then you got to deal with them wanting to trade a stick of bubblegum for your legendary and then getting butthurt when you decline
---
We need a "Hold shift to snap" option for everything that can snap.
---
I dunno, just doesn't seem to go with the look I'm working on
---
Legandaries are randomized you dumbass
---
There’s a game pass from MS for PC too. That’s what he’s talking about.
---
I really wanted to do that, with the instrument clipping through inside a porta potty, but I couldn't make it work, so I gave up.
---
I was going to have my vendors on the surface in my log cabin, and the secret base below, but no luck.
---
Maybe when we have instanced CAMPs, I'll be able to realize my dream of an innocent looking homestead vendor on the surface, with an Enclave bunker below, accessed by a porta potty.
---
I think giving us 200 or 250 SCORE for quests after say rank 70 would help a lot. They already give you scrip and treasury notes for doing dailies.
---
Why reduce when eliminating the issues is a better option. I get that you mean well but you're giving poor advice to people.
---
The best option (and really only) option to guarantee that no one buys from your vendor is to scrap the vending machine.
---
Nice. [I have almost the exact same picture on the kiddies ride.](https://imgur.com/rw0UhJs)
---
Photo mode is the greatest thing ever added to games tbh
---
They’re expensive resource-wise
---
You can set up vending machines in your camp to sell stuff to other players. It looks like a green circle icon on the map.
---
If you're feeling particularly generous, why not craft a shielded vault tec suit, or other special buffing under armor
---
I think a few have said in order to be on track to finish by last week you have to be at reward #45 by tuesday
---
Not all horde events are like this, about 75% of them you fast travel directly to the horde. 
---
And like others said, if you know the area pretty well, you can make a guess at what location the boss is at by what normally spawns at the locations. Even if the locations don't show on your map (which is the stupidest bug), if you have done that horde event before or guess the right location, the boss will still appear there.
---
Horde events are the best events!
---
P.s - I made a post about horde events, its a long read, but its all the tips I could possibly give to get the full potential out of them.
---
Some people will assume it does and just take it anyway. I’m not saying it makes it right. It doesn’t. It’s just a lame excuse as to why they would do it. I know I’ll stockpile the foods that work. But..again.. I find them myself.
---
It's always been like that. Are you sure you'll swear on it?
---
What about putting a doorway in front of it, and decorating the wall like it's the bar? It would have a kind of speak easy vibe. Especially if you put the circus trailer door on the doorway.
---
Just let them play at that level. 
---
They literally dont need anything but for high level to leave them alone and learn the game.    
---
Am I the only one around here who enjoys starting a new game and learning / taking in the experience.
---
A cinematic masterpiece
---
Or the fences or anything other than the  ground. That's the problem with bloodied builds in my opinion. Not enough hit points to survive the add mobs that come and whack em.
---
Roses raider questline gives you a full suit of raider power armor at the end
---
Farm adhesive. It’s not that hard. You can LITERALLY farm it at any camp you create while the lead deposits are extremely limited. Good lord.
---
Has it I must if misinterpreted something I've heard on a video lol oh well least I know now 😂
---
You need to shoot her so she aggros otherwise she will fly back to her spawn point and regen health. The trouble is too many people watch YouTube on how to do stuff these fucking morons have no clue how to figure shit out on their own. She operates just like regular scorchbeasts. All one has to do is observe their behavior. Too bad the average IQ has dropped in the past 25 years, most people are just fucking dumb.
---
Definitely time to level the alt. That’s what I’m going to do this weekend. I want to get all the trophies, and I still have the one for siding with the other group in wastelanders, so I’m making a new character primarily to get that done.
---
I'm the same, did you manage to find it by any chance?
---
Imagine getting your asskicked by a melee with a stealth boy
---
lol they totally take stuff out and bring it back, it's like the menu in a diner
---
I might sound a little jaded but that wasn't really trash talking. I thought SR-71 was one-time, but that's the only one I really remember because that was totally MY THING MAN and then I realized I was being a five year old and chilled tf out lol
---
Or just use a keypad switch like i do
---
I would avoid this.  
---
1) its still takes up weight in your stash.  
---
2) I promise you at some point you will be trying to stuff that legendary in your stash and is no room. Then you will just junk this stuff anyway. 
---
Until displays have a seperate inventory then I can see there is ever a reason to decorate like this.  Maybe its just me.
---
Yeah, but I go through like 1000s arrows a day if I'm running events.
---
Just curious for those, who downvote this post - what's wrong with this idea?  
---
For those who wants a fresh new character nothing changes.  
---
For those who wants to lvlup/store crap on a different character it's just a much safer and easier way to do that.
---
Honestly it would be such a positive addition to the game. I see countless posts on here of people being nice and showcasing a wonderful community spirit, only for that to be ruined by others.
---
Level locked vendors and a tipping mailbox or something where people can show appreciation of good camps would both do a lot for the game.
---
Currently there isn’t a way to place items randomly about in your camp. There are some display cases that let you assign junk and items. And display wracks for weapons.
---
Yea I agree. Give them shielded underarmor. Its the one thing they can use from level 2 into endgame.
---
Yeah, but I go though thousands of arrows a day if I'm running events.
---
even when i auto-reload, or even if I put my gatling away/bring it back out I still find there are multiple unfilled cores. I took a break during winter and heard it got fixed. nope
---
Dude we go thru 1000’s of rounds of ammo against a SBQ, quit crying man.
---
Lead deposits. Run a breach and clear. You get at min 50 led
---
Won't argue with you there, but they shouldn't have written these Raiders to be so sympathetic. That storyline could've worked just as well if it were imprinted onto the people at Foundation, and then add an actual Raider's story that made them more like the traditional raiders we know from other games. Maybe if they add some DLC in the future for it, a new Raider leader could come along and remove Meg and get them more aligned with what you'd expect from raiders.
---
I get what you're saying about the humans aren't reasonable, but they did go on to form factions and cities, Diamond City, Megaton, and the host of other little settlements we find where people cooperated.
---
Not sure how low a level you are but if you have access to the Chinese stealth armor wear that, even if you're not using stealth. Gives you damage resistance and rads won't effect you at all really. I just carry it round with me for nuke zones.
---
I just unlocked it yesterday. Haven't built one yet though
---
Low level gameplay is fine as it is, most players can quickly scrounge up what they need. If you want to really help, give em some Radaway and Canned Meat Stew, dealing with rads in the early game is a pain in the ass, and the xp buff from the stew will help boost them through the opening levels.
---
Build a adhesive farm. Endless adhesive.
---
"time makes a dumb heifer of us all"... pure poetry!
---
My main is at 97 and I haven’t changed my perk cards (aside from temporarily for crafting/hacking/lock picking/selling/teams stuff) since about level 60. And I haven’t really cared much what perk cards I chose since about level 80. My SPECIAL was where I wanted it to be at 50.
---
if you dont have one by tomorrow, i can craft you one
---
if thats the case, my psn is flavourite_hopfi just send me a message 👍🏼
---
I got 2k steel from one Lines in The Sand event as well
---
That's an awesome suggestion, thank you
---
Ok can you send me on so I remember?
---
im always the only ore runner lol
---
Whats the limit on the ESO crafting bag? I never managed to hit it.
---
He is saying drops aren't max level.
---
Lvl 20 to start but you need to do roses quest and one in the mining HQ also u need the one for the scorched cure etc.
---
The Enclave presidential items and their associated PVP event were never added to the game. No clue on what happened with the Ranger items, don't have FO1st :p
---
I believe it starts at lvl 20 with overseer quest.   Cant finish any time after that i think.   Might be hard solo at that level tho.
---
allright when i get online tomorrow ill just check your post to see if someone could help you and if not im contacting you 👍🏼
---
No???
---
Solved: I didn’t see the 2Fa request on my Authenticator...it was 4:30am
---
Thank you guys...got it🙏🏻
---
Game needs more storage space for photos
---
Do you truly have *all* mutations?
---
Empath causes you to take 6-8% increased damage (with L3 class freak). The Electrified Scales and Unstable Isotope mutations also damage you when they proc their dmg on melee hit. If you took an unmitigated hit in the back and both electrified scale and unstable isotope proc with no serendipity that is a pretty big series of hits that can chunk your health bar.
---
I will say though that for the last couple of days i have been seeing my new low level bloodied/unyielding chars hp suddenly drop at random times. And its not expiring food buffs. She will be walking along and suddenly she only has a sliver of health left. It happened several times last night.
---
I like the extra enemies. Like the scorched, mole miners, deathclaws, mirelurk queens. Just not the damn annoying little ones that run around you like the dogs, and cave crickets. By the time my gun has spun up they are behind me, so i waste alot of ammo.
---
Yes theu are for me at least
---
I do these a lot so I usually know where the boss will spawn each time, much like the other posters have already mentioned. With that being said, if you go to the "wrong" location, you still get 300-500 exp for discovering it is the "wrong" location. with 5 spots, I spend the small amount of caps to jump to each location and end up with about 1500-2k extra exp just for a few caps.
---
Lol imagine having 95% and misusing with your instigating vats pump action. This gun 1 hits anything that's not a queen or colossus. And I miss all 4 shots in vats lol
---
There's way more lead around than just the deposits though
---
HERETIC GET YOUR CONTROLLER AND START PRAYING
---
look I just think it's amazing luck that Bethesda dropped this during quarantine, because you know they sure as hell didn't plan for us to have nowhere else to go. can you imagine doing this and trying to have a life? talk about a silver lining man, I should get totes upvoted for being positive AF
---
err wait not positive, really optimistic
---
Yeah fair enough.  
---
Sorry that I misinterpreted.  
---
So i have no idea what the Sr-71 is that you're referring to. Is it just the Blackbird PA paints?
---
even with a .50 cal &amp; VATS, the tiny enemies (ticks, mirelurk spawn etc) are a real *bugger*
---
I'm already 109 years experience under my belt
---
Too bad i dont have falloutshitty1st my stash is already fucking full
---
Just buy the ammo maker or capture a led producer
---
I think it's not about how far you are in the story, but there was some sort of min. level that you have to be so that you can complete Wastelanders(20?).
---
Same for plastic and adhesive.
---
Adhesive and plastic are easy ashell to make tho
---
But you can't get a level 50 item from a &lt;50 level mob
---
"Messenger a complete waste of time" 
---
Fixed it*
---
The part about 6 people failing to keep npcs alive is my biggest gripe...
---
There is also the double score days July 23rd to the 27th that should help.
---

---
Any or all of the following:
---
* Boosted under armour (especially ones with strength for extra carry weight and early game melee damage bonus)
---
* Level 1 or level 5 BOS recon rifle
---
* Level 5 Fire Axe (will be wrecking fools for many levels past 5)
---
* Level 1 Deep pocketed, studded leather torso. All the extra limbs are ok but the deep pocketed is more important than all the armour really. 
---
* Bunch of .308 and 10mm ammo
---
* A few diluted stims. like 5-10
---
* A couple of good food items, like cranberry relish, canned meat stew, radstag or brahmin steaks.
---
You forgot textchat (servers temporarily disabled chat atm)
---
Nice
---
Same for all of these new stand alone buildings. They are fantastic, but would be even better if we could snap them to foundations. While we're at it.. how about adding in some half and quarter foundation variations, and the ability to snap floor pieces to foundations like you can in Fallout 4?
---
If you read the post youd see how much it sucks for arrows. I have a heavy weps char and can go though 4k ammo a SBQ. I have no problem making ammo for that event or general play. Super mutants also drop 1-500 5mm.
---
Exactly. The issue with heavy guns and vats is that AP depletes insanely fast, so even that aint much use against them. Thats why I kind of like the tents around. As soon as I see a load of them chasing me, nah, I just jump on the tent briefly.
---
Man I had the same shit happen to me last night. A 400 level kid in the space suit power armor trying to take shit I was dropping for low level guys. I wish I could have located his camp to nuke that bitch.
---
Fair enough but I'd rather not have to use adhesive on ammo (If used the bow, which I don't) - when you say farm it I'm guessing that's the veg starch?
---
A million times, this.
---
It's currently only possible with powered doors and pressure plates/laser tripwires, but those don't go on prefabs! And it looks a mess.
---
The skin was there since release many are waiting for the X02 and monthly they renew an item ranger skins sometimes survival tent etc at the moment its the bog wanderer outfit and nobody knows if the ranger skins will return
---
I'm at level 450\~  and I'm sitting on only about 120 spare points, so yeah I've respec'd a few times.  When the vault raids were out I moved a lot of points around to help run them better with more appropriate perks. (then back again when they shut them down).  I'd suggest getting that Alt going. Two bonus reasons, level it up for extra script and murgh gambling, and extra set of caps when you want it.  Plus your main is always gonna find gear that would be better suited for a different build, might as well have one to offload it to.
---
I dont like that idea. Getting forced to play a gamemode I dislike just to be able to access an area of the map.
---
Yes sir :)
---
Well i can give you my Word as i played with berry mentats yesterday killing scorched ghouls, and everytime they wore out i really noticed the difference. Just try it yourself take two enemys the same level and kind kill one rwmember the exp throw in some mentats and See the difference
---
Fog crawler horde is not one that you would need to search locations so next time don't pass it up
---
No they need to stop running stagger effects.  When she lands if she immediately takes off that is because some idiot is running one gun army, enforcer, or tank killer.  Staggering the queen makes her take off.
---
Yes, all... (Carnivore/Herbivore is the only exception of course)
---
I guess Electrified Scales and Unstable Isotope kills me. This "suddenly dropping health" is a constant thing, Jeah.
---
Maybe Serendipity wasn't procing.
---
I heard of a glitch/bug with healing factor as well. But I think the problems you mentioned are the cause.
---
You only need to go as far as completing the inoculation. The overseer's broadcast starts transmitting when that is done.
---
I'm still seeing plenty of people that doesn't get it. They leave the moment you switch back to building.
---
yep that's the one, they dropped it at the beginning and then it was gone for a long while, good times lol
---
anyway sometimes I think it's good for a thing to be limited edition
---
If you don’t like the build, don’t play it.
---
Ah so I have to basically convert my base in to all farm to keep up with adhesive consumption.
---
Lone wander will not work wile you are in a group, even if you are in it by yourself. And FWIW, Inspirational will not work unless you have at least one other person in your group.
---
I would love this idea. I'd love to share the junk in my scrapbox between both my characters. If I needed something on one character that the other has, just go to the scrapbox. Instead I have to get a friend to help me switch it out or find a secluded spot, drop a loot bag in a friend's world and pray they don't leave before I can switch and get there.
---
Maybe shoot better?
---
I mean, that is on the designers for not making it like that. Another thing they could actually do is have the pre-builts ignore collision when placing it on top of/through foundations. That way you can lay out your flat surface, then place the pre-built building right on top of it. Raise it up slightly so the pre-built's floor shows, or sink it in so the foundation's surface shows.
---
Oh how I miss Place Anywhere in 76....
---
I think it’s a combination of lots of high level accounts being hit in the ban wave and the level mix changing on all servers with the influx of new players
---
I agree, I just want to play the game and getting help ruins it for me. Feels like cheating, kills the natural progression and challenge, plus the game already hands some stuff out early on.
---
I would give some advice/info if they wanted it or save them from an angry mob of mutants. Maybe build some decorations or crafting benches in their camp should they want them.
---
Also I've seen too many players become dependant and unable to help themselves after you throw them some free goodies.   Some start going around asking for handouts, then for more and more. Suddenly you realize you've dedicated 2hrs+  escorting around some lazy player rather then working on the XP/Score grind on x2 Exp Weekend.
---
Right after they add a in game mail system...
---
Prime will do extra damage to all scorched (not sure what the damage +% is however).
---
Hmm to be fair then there should be a miner's collectron for ore
---
(looks at neighbor's trailer)... um... astroturf and faded flamingoes in old bottles?
---
I mean sure, but I don't see why people who have no interest in NW would want to hang around there
---
Would just be a bonus to be able to look around and see the lore stuff and terminals they've unlocked without having to queue for a match. If you don't play the game mode, you already don't have access to this content, it's just making it easier for the people who do play and have access to it.
---
BGS missed out on a huge DLC opportunity by not giving us the ability to "kill ZAX."
---
That's the real (and only) reason I lock my door.
---
I don't use it myself - mainly because I have no idea about the number of people that use it - and prefer discord for text chat.
---
You need at least level 20 and it's probably best to complete the main quest line up until Rose's raider quest. 
---
You don't have to do all of the main story quest line up until that point but a lot of things line up neatly both in terms of you getting to level 20 efficiently (quests tend to be the more efficient way to get XP at low levels) and you needing Rose's help to get access to the raiders.
---
I love the build?
---
Head inside the building after you've cleared the outside area.
---
You gunna fix the 95% vats miss chance? Also it's not about shooting better if you read the post
---
It's only metal chest peice and the rolls arnt that great I'll put it up for like 500 see what happens
---
Yes please let me know. When I’m max caps I used to just “cut the wire” to the machines
---
So, I can miss things, but Motherlode died? I don't remember that happening. Is that because you used her to help the settlers (I went raider)? I set her free during the "motherload" side quest and say hi during breach and clear (and ride the commie one sometimes), and that's all I remember about her.
---
Lol sorry XBox.
---
There’s a few gems in there. I like the postcard on the bed.
---
VATS hasn’t worked properly on charging weapons like the Gauss Rifle since Fallout 4 (released 5 years ago).
---
I joined a public team yesterday where 2/3 people were talking.
---
I immediately joined a different team.
---
At least take me to an event before you whisper in my ear.
---
I'm pretty sure to complete the story quest, you yourself must activate and launch the nuke, then complete the separate event called Scorched Earth to defeat the queen.
---
"Big Game release"
---
never even heard of it bruv.
---
I wish I was in game right now this is bugging me now lol
---
I just tried this.
---
Private world, claim workshop.
---
Built generator, keypad pylon, and terminal.
---
Wired everything up and locked terminal.
---
Relogged and switched characters.
---
Workshop unclaimed (did not claim on switched character)
---
Pylon could be switched on and off.
---
Terminal locked and required hacking to access.
---
I'll need another person to test definitively but it doesnt look like code is required for the keypad. It's a seperate object I can interact with but it doesn't seem to do anything about locking the switch itself.
---
Sure thing. Hopefully I’ll be on in 4 or 5 hours with one of my friends.
---
I'd just like to get access to the vault just to explore at my own pace. Don't care if it's in Adventure or NW mode just so long as I can dodging being forced into a NW match.
---
luckily I have my loadout &amp; buffs so my AP is always at max regen rate when I'm on the field (action perk card, high END&amp;AGI, well hydrated, well tuned, UNY armor etc), but i agree, even with my buffs, (and i do get a decent amount of shots in) it still depletes at an insane rate. makes sense though when ya consider that it's still DPS based.
---
thankfully most enemies are 1-4 shots for me so i either tag the bigger bois or straight up 1-shot those lil bugs
---
sometimes I mess up &amp; shoot another player by accident lol. that evolved into habitually turning on pacifist mode before any end-game event to avoid accidental PvP :p
---
That, or do something demoralizing to him 
---
Like make him our new personal scrap collecting protectron lol
---
Genuinely seems like that on this sub, that and the inability to read
---
One is 30 the os killervis 50.i was surprised to be hitting harder with the non primed version. I'll retest later
---
No vegatble starch and pool table balls infact you should never be low on adhesive
---
Until the XP formula in NW is reworked, I don’t think NW XP should give score. There is already too much incentive to AFK in NW. I don’t have a problem with people going AFK solo. But there are many players who AFK with full team on because they want 3 less people trying to kill them. This makes things worse for every else on the team, as it becomes much harder to win when you have less teammates. At this point, I want time-based XP removed entirely and the XP for kills massively buffed.
---
LOL, none of the teams I’ve joined have had people chatting.  Not that it matters, I’m usually in a PS4 party with friends anyways while we play and that mutes the voice chat anyhow
---
I dont caps are useless.
---
Hmmm, hadn't thought about that... May check it out! Thanks!
---
weird how ive been getting 50s then from that event maybe you guus are just stupid
---
"i want to be like bethesda...." (sniffs adhesive)
---
Thank you for your answer. I hope they do add them, but maybe they want to flesh it out and make it part of a bigger questline.
---
But then again considering how many of you bought fo1st mist of you are fucking stupid
---
Hoard Legendary modules, when you start crafting SS gear, your gonna have to craft 30 at a time to get a decent roll on a single piece. That’s what I did. I went through 210 modules that I hoarded and only got 3 decent rolls.
---
Tip: You only need 25 ore for the event to succeed. You won’t get the best rewards, but it will be a success, which means more XP and Treasury Notes. 
---
If everyone goes and grabs just one chamber’s worth of ore, the event will typically succeed. That takes 30 seconds. It’s easily possible to both farm the event for XP and complete it successfully. Ideally, wait to dump your ore until the end. If you happen to hit 100 the event will end early.
---
My plasma gatlings reload with partially full cores all the time.
---
Okay good.  I was worried I was playing it incorrectly.  I stealth collect all the ore, killing as I go.  Then I take up position near the dump spot and kill anything coming up the hall.  30ish seconds and I dump my ore.  Easy.
---
If everyone at the event is farming exp, you are then free to collect the ore.... No?
---
Way more,I've got like 46 photos I've got no intention of deleting and I keep missing out on split second photo opportunities cause my storage runs out
---
My GT and username are the same. HMU.
---
Last two I did, someone opened 7... no idea why...
---
That title... :)
---
Some players place their camps near areas with newer players and over price things hoping to get "newbs" to buy them thinking they must be rare or somesuch..or at least that's what they told me when I asked them about it.
---
I sell all my stuff really cheap - except my instigating shovel...that one's too goofy so it's pricey just because.
---
Probably leveled using glitches and bugs for score.
---
Ketchikan kid who did college in AZ, lol.
---
Tip for you btw, I doubt new players actually know what The Fixer is, you might want to clarify in your post.
---
Need to have plenty of picnic baskets available.
---
Think about a build to go for do wastelanders and then buy legendary modules to craft the armor/weapons bought with gold
---
Lmao I just watched this vid. I felt like I was the shit when I got 900 from one yesterday lol
---
&gt; Beside the fact that a perfectly flat C.A.M.P site does not exist 
---
You should try building around New Gad. It's about as close as you're going to get in this game.
---
Enclave Events not fit as public ones since you have to be a member to see them on the map.
---
I‘d like to see having two public events at the same time suited levelwise - one for low to mid and one high lvl event.
---
Or having some more like Encryptid, Riding Shotgun or Scorched Earth which players can start on it’s own.
---
Welp there goes my reason to have an adhesive farm.
---
I've missed one day so far, do everything except NW challenges, and usually level 2-3x per sitting.  I hit 37 last night.
---
Just figured it out.i have rifleman cards and the prime version I have are full auto...
---
It was time gated, but yes, it was also accidentally made available again along with the Christmas and Halloween stuff. I made a post about this the day it happened, but neglected the survivor stuff because I already earned all of those.
---
Similar to the placemat idea, adding/modifying desks and tables so that they can have items placed on them. It wouldn't cost any more budget than what it is like placing items such as plushies or plants on tables.
---
What they really need is a junk pack. Common items like picture frame, typewriter, pots, cigarette cartons, etc that already exists in the game that can be placed. I would gladly decrease the size of my camp building to be able to include more of this. Since BSG would want to make money on this, I would suggest including a common junk pack in with season rewards, and then they can sell special junk packs in the atom store that go with different types of builds (like restaurant, etc).
---
I don't see the issue. Yes it sucks but still looks awesome and is worth it imho.
---
Omg lol neeeerrrrddsss
---
Nope, some world elements can't be removed. Like big trees.
---
They need to make this a mod for the Minigun, and then I can finally make my Blain character!
---
Yeah, I just wish the ammo converter was a container instead, and you went into the console to convert everything in the container at once.
---
Also make the defensive walls snap to the outside of the perimeter components.
---
For me he found chems booze and empty bottles mostly
---
need a backup cryolater for this purpose.
---
So is chameleon
---
This is a legitimate concern that hasn't been addressed at all in game. I have noticed there is no colorblind mode for 76.
---
There's a bug that's been active for a while where all the Halloween, Christmas, and Survivor rewards are now available to be earned (but for some reason the VTU items are excluded). What that means is the challenges requiring you to earn xp are active, you just can't see them. The community
---
I would welcome any solution that would ease the pain of using my gauss minigun.  It sits in it's display rack most of the time.  The same could be said of my light machine considering how much 308 it eats :-/
---
Your statement just needs to read: I wish that VATS worked properly. 
---
I play melee, and it sometimes takes 3 or 4 times for a hit to work (and with melee, you can only swing at 95%).
---
No prob. If you have the advert posters they would make a good addon, maybe a weapon display for a guitar sword or something? There are actual instruments that you can put in display cases too. A violin, flute, snare drum, acoustic guitar (I think it can go in a case) a harmonica. These could be cool, you could use small letters to add captions. As an outfit for becket maybe the slacks and suspenders, with the sunglasses and maybe the white wolf fedora or military cap which looks kinda like a beret?
---
speaking as a bloodied build, i like to stand on the ground and be right in the centre of battle
---
most bloodied builds you'll find have DMG reduction/DMG avoiding perks in their loadout. I reckon the fence/tent standers are a mix of different builds. they just don't know how to SBQ
---
I'm getting 4000xp for Heart of the Enemy - which you can repeat over and over again.
---
That would make too much sense. They clearly didn't design it with veteran players in mind who have hundreds of pounds of ammo
---
Not the way that you probably want to. It'd bring the servers to a grinding halt. All we have are display cases or whatever "junk" camp items we already have.
---
I thought that was a daily can you keep doing that
---
I got there yesterday. I'm not expecting to make it to the end, but it's reassuring to hear a lot of people are around the same rank
---
Mine are named excavator, ultra, and t65. Super simple stuff
---
Literally anything that any American does on the internet or cellphone network is recorded and stored by the NSA they have some kind of data dragnet so let that paranoia go bro they watch everybody not just you.
---
 I don't know what kind of shit you could do that would send up red flags but if searching nuke codes does, I'd bet the NSA is smart enough to differentiate some gamers and whatever moron wannabe terrorist that thinks the USAF keeps the launch codes on google.
---
No it's not, it's a battlepass tied to dailies and they used the excuse of giving us rewards they decided for us instead of giving us atoms for dailies.
---
"Apart from all the bugs and score mishaps", yea dude, 70% of the time it works all the time, dang Bethesda is so good dude, what a well executed stroke of genius right there, dang.
---
They just need to make it so everyone in the event can loot all the enemies in the event.
---
People might argue "REEE that means lazy people will just afk and get free loot!"... I'd rather lazy people get free loot than almost everyone who's actively participating not get any loot because a level 1000 with a legacy build one shots everything before they can even look at it.
---
lol, when crafting the gun gives you a better return in ammo than crafting the ammo itself
---
Nuke their camp!!
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Musical_instrument

Check the world objects section
---
Congrats.  It's quite a grind but feels great when you finally get enough tolkens.
---
Ok I will try to do that thank you.
---
I gave my weapons alphanumeric names to keep them in order, and so I don't accidentally scrap/scrip anything (else. My precious Furious gauss minigun, the reason I dropped 500 atoms on a weapon skin (which led to another 500 when I got the pistol and wanted to stay on theme))
---
Enforcer perk with 30% chance to cripple a limb? Yeah I'm pretty sure that's not only viable but a bit OP as well.
---
I just stopped selling stuff half the time the machines are broke and the stuff that's selling takes up space
---
&gt;So you dont have to play with anyone but yourself :)
---
Sounds more as an encouragement for long term singles
---
Yup, just go up to Grant's terminal on the top floor of Fort Defiance and you can restart it
---
I really wish they would fix their item search!!! That was my total favorite!!!
---
what people dont seem to realize is that if you collect ore you can poach some legendaries before they run out haha.
---
Imagine being an uncivilized oaf and actually letting things shoot at you.
---
\*scoff\*
---
Ill be over here stealthed, casually sipping my tea in the middle of the warzone and sniping things at my leisure.
---
IDK there still is a lot to grind for such as power armor or secret service armor depending on which you focused on.  I just got all the mods for my full SS set and all the gauss weapons now I have to build either T-65 or Strangler Heart.
---
Why are you telling me this lol?
---
Are the ban waves finished?
---
Please don’t. Let’s move those rewards to other events or daily quests but that mole miner thing was garbage.
---
Right? They need to covert those shelves and other display cases into ones that allow us to show items. Otherwise what’s the point of having shelves you can’t put anything on.
---
There was one guy to whomever they responded just basically saying"yup were looking into it", but I mean bro it's time to move on for a bit, I dont think this will get resolved for you withing the next two weeks minimum, so you can say goodnight to your score season, just come back for the next one, and dont be a dïçķ and dupe again
---
&gt;How is it hard to detect someone literally flying, noclipping, and mass killing people across the map?
---
It's not that difficult to put anti-cheating measures into a competently managed game, but Bethesda's management is as incompetent as all get out and doesn't care about anything beyond filling up the Atom store with pointless tchotchkes and slapping another depressing daily grind on the game to artificially pad their "player engagement" numbers.
---
Just spent like $5 dollars bruh
---
It’s not uncommon.    I have had a dozen shielded BOS linings from forbidden knowledge.    (I am trying to collect the paints)
---
Exactly as autocompleting a few weeklies or dailies basically prevents you from finishing the season.
---
Im not a Junkie Build but for Junkies thats nice and otherwise maybe for Brewing or for Caps - selling.
---
My first right leg was unyielding, and sixth left leg. It’s possible, just some bad RNG going down.
---
How much damage needs to be done to get loot?
---
I’m new to the game but fast travelled to do an event and a separate battle was going on. People attacking a level 50 or so dragon thing. I tagged it for only like 6 damage before it got destroyed but I didn’t get anything out of it.
---
I agree duping has made everything common. Every noob has a Je or be fixer laser or gat
---
"Radstorms and Sunshine" sounds like Atom Cats poetry
---
Since NW is supposed to take place in the future compared to adventure mode, I'm hoping at some point they create a quest line where you are responsible for helping get ZAX up and running or something of the like to prepare for testing. It could even have to do with nuking certain areas to test how that would work, etc.
---
Note: I only play NW for the challenges, and haven't followed the story within all the notes and terminals, so perhaps this contradicts the canon that has already been established by that. But knowing ZAX, he could always be inventing his own history.
---
You have to convert it into stable flux, because raw flux eventually spoils and becomes inert flux.
---
They didn't disappear. They probably spoiled
---
Ffs I didn’t knowwww thatttttt
---
&gt; I subbed here before the game ever came out and have since refused to play it so I don't have any hands on experience with it.
---
Exactly bruh, no exp. Do you tell a heart surgeon what incision to make first? No.
---
Cos why? NO FUCKING EXPERIENCE!
---
So why bother to speak here in the first place. Smdh
---
I'm not even in Chapter 2 yet, because of work and life I missed a few days. Kind of upsetting to look and see that because I don't treat Fallout like a free-to-play mobile game and check in every single day, I won't be able to finish the pass. Even though on the days I can play, I put in 5+ hours on average, but that means nothing because I only get more SCORE from level ups after I complete my dailies and weeklies. Challenges should be used for big jumps in points, but I should also be getting SCORE by playing normally, like every other game that uses a battle pass!
---
Sure act like before now ppl actually did the daily challenges. And on top of that, the amount of atoms u get as a reward is not even worth the amount of time worth doing them considering the prices of the shop and not to mention the stupid ass other challenges that barely reward u. The sooner u quite expecting flawless gaming experiences, the more you'll realize that these events aren't that bad. And how the f**k else would u implement a battle pass in 76 outside of the dailies?! What? Lol. Cus u have to put in challenges for us to get score in the first place. Another Bethesda Hater Band Wagoner
---
No reason for this to not be in the game. If I can murder NPCs to the point their heads pop off and their bodies explode, I should be able to give another player the middle finger.
---
You need to have all 3 linings prior to shielded learned for it to drop. Are you sure you have not forgotten one of them? if you have you will keep getting protective as event reward.
---
I am sorry to tell you, but it is not fixed and if you are leaving goo piles, then you are part of the problem.
---
I'd imagine it's not pellets, but flechettes that are packed together - like if you took a 2mm slug and sliced it lengthwise like a pizza, so all the flechettes fit neatly together in the barrel but spread out after firing.
---
k
---
Okay so spam the place button and walk up to it. I did it and it took me hours but it will go there is you have enough willpower
---
Almost like it's some kind of evolving game.
---
I did guided meditation last night with about 6 or 7 others, int of about 32 (not bloodied) with max building, plus relish well rested and inspirational, may have had a lunchbox too. Getting 800-1000 for most kills, it was insane!
---
Yogi works for Hornwright.
---
Nothing to do with the issue OP is having
---
i wouldnt give them too much. some water, some grilled meat, some .38 ammo and let them go.
---
The uniform of douchebags.
---
For pure xp, I like to chain workshops rather than grind outright. (Private world ofc). I have a couple of defensive turret layouts that i spawn in for specific workshops. Capture for initial xp, let mobs take it from you, then warp to the workshop to finish off whatever your turrests dont kill during the retake event. You get another chunk of xp and dont have to sit through the bullshit wave spawns.
---
Once you get multiple workshops up, it is a LOT of incoming xp. And on top of that youre getting a lot of scrap, weapons, ammo, plans, etc from the quest rewards.
---
Problem solved..
---
Except blueprints have a very, very limited budget
---
Except blueprints are just as fucky and finnicky and give you the exact same problems
---
Except blueprints sometimes won't let you place it down if there's a limited object in it that's already stored
---
Problem not solved
---
This is my new life till end of double xp
---
I wasn't aware Red Asylum and Croc Pack were legendaries...
---
I mean, I got my Croc Plan on my second Mole Miner pail during the event. I didn't even know it was rare.
---
It's just anti-fallout 1st people.  Like NW posts, posts that involve asking for 1st stuff always get extra downvotes because of the salty people who don't like it.  They want the scrapbox but don't want to pay for it so they have an irrational hatred for anything involving 1st.  It's weird for sure.
---
I haven't gotten resources from that event in ages.
---
Sometimes we will remove people in order to make room for regular team members. For example, we have three people of our regular team on and we are waiting for a fourth when a random person joins. When our last team mate gets on, we will remove the random person. Its nothing personal. 
---
Also, sharing good cards can help you stay on a team. Too many random teams have people not sharing perk cards or sharing worthless cards that get you nothing. Invest in good team perk cards!
---
I keep tesla coils on a set of power armor for when I'm in a public server. Walk up and zap it for the tag and only shoot it if folk are having trouble.

---
So your saying that someone (me) cant get any xp from kills because you think they dont need the legendary ? Thats stupid considering i grinded for both of those i think you should respect the grind and dont be a dong about it
---
How so?   He got a duplicate lining.    I have received several.    It’s not the one he wants but receiving duplicates happens.
---
I spoils real quickly too if you don't have 3 points of good with salt running. Don't put it in your stash.
---
A win is a win. *-shrugs-* It's not my preferred style of play, but that doesn't matter. As long as you aren't cheating, every win is equally valid no matter how you get there.
---
Good for drinking though. better than purified water
---
But the poor guy worked so hard to get those items ...cough ...cough.
---
I won't comment on how easy or hard that would be to implement because I don't know, but I think I can say for certain that if that were implemented it would probably cause you scrap bulked items again or something until Bethesda releases a hotfix.
---
This.
---
Nifty flex.
---
This is why if you've got a private server you should use it. Too many needledicks out there trying to prove... something, I guess?
---
Well yea but you have to grind old and easy events. Doing Tea Time as full build lvl 250 isn't really  much fun. If we could atleast trigger the late game events manually...
---
This is a great idea make it just like the ESO craft bag.  There is no reason not to do this as we can transfer scrap to other characters anyways this just makes it easier.
---
oh, i wasnt aware of that. i will pick arrows up from now and put them in my vendor.
---
You missed the point. 
---
Its clearly ALL duped.
---
It's different because BoS Shielded is the last in the line of BoS linings. Therefore you will keep getting it as there are no other ones available (and it has a quite big chance also). OP is having an issue not getting the last one for raider.
---
Same it's terrible at moment as I'm constantly at max weight 😅
---
I agree with more player startable public events. I feel having multiple public events at once means that you will really split who is playing (like even with the great XP from Radiation Rumble, I had to run it solo a few times yesterday because no one showed up). But I find more people will join events like Encryptid or SBQ.
---
Who knows, this might all change with One Wasteland - if you can actually get good XP and rewards from Tea Time, you might see more people there.
---
Pro tip: make a foundation with a bunch of the stuff on it and blueprint it. When the challenge comes up again just drop a couple of the blueprint and be done in 5 seconds.
---
Here is the video proof you requested: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjX5sgjXuz0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjX5sgjXuz0). Angry Turtle is the best source for Fallout 76 info because he tests everything.
---
The wiki is filled with outdated or inaccurate information. For example, it says that the empath mutation side effect is a 33% damage increase; the in-game description is 25%. What even the in-game description doesn't tell you is that you count as a team member, so there are no penalties to the empath mutation provided you are on a team.
---
It's fair to ask for proof, but this matter is simple enough to test yourself. Kill several supermutants that are all the same level, and record your experience gain. Join a building team  and repeat. See the experience gain increase yourself.
---
Honestly - being a new player myself - I think a lot of noobs don’t know wtf this game is.  I cannot tell you how many times I’ve had low levels try to attack me on the first stretch of road.  I want to take this moment to apologize to all the long time players having to put up with the influx of new players as I’m sure we are annoying even if we are amusing to watch at times.  Also, thanks to all the high levels that have cool stuff for us new players to look at and also all of you that help us out in getting started!
---
You should’ve murdered the dude and given his junk to the low level, piece of shit deserves no mercy
---
Have you tried having him collect drugs? I'd love to know what the output is. A healthy collection of various Mentats would be nice seeing as we're in the middle of the Legendary Grind.
---
Always gather the flux last. Kill the enemies first, then go gardening, then go craft.
---
Wish the damn terminal wasn't completely useless after using it for this one thing.  Only other thing it can do is tell you if dailies are ready.....just like the pip boy but more inconvenient.  Seems like they could do some cool things with it but "nah"
---
You’re a drainer 😂 so what if the guy duped the stuff, at least he doesn’t walk around being an arse because he’s salty that he doesn’t have legacies! What an actual joke 😂😂😂
---
I think there's an armor effect that also triggers it, block damage reduction maybe?  So if you wear one piece of armor with that all shotguns become magic.
---
So what, you want a round of applause for acting spiteful?
---
Yeah I don't understand it at all I roll with a group of 4 and we can 100 percent. It every time no deaths minimum damage go public group no chance
---
It looks great, of course, that’s why I bought it.
---
But it’s also broken and bugged, which doesn’t make it worth paying for, especially considering it was broken even further after it had already been paid for in the first place.
---
I wouldn't even be mad
---
Did anyone mentioned that? PC users: use RMB.
---
No words.  Lmao.
---
I play ESO as well and their events burn me out, especially when they stack them back to back for months.  I ended up taking a month or two off for this reason alone.  If you don’t get a break you’ll burn out.
---
No but the durability bar is random when the gun drops
---
Going to take a while...if ever.
---
Mine wasn't. I got lucky.
---
Also, I'd take the level into account. A sub-100 with those 3 items, yeah there's a better chance they're duped as they likely lack the hours to have accumulated such items. But if they're a level 300 I'd figure they legit grinded for it.
---
Finally, some people have duped items they bought but have no idea they are duped.
---
I thought about crafting a load of lvl 20 fixers and vending them to noobs. Then I remembered that some people will abuse that. Yours is a better idea .
---
I use PA so I can carry junk is all. Not really a fan though. Was just looking into non PA set next. How about Urban/Forest set? Right now I just equip any legendary that drops and is better than what I have on at the time. I sort by damage and equip top 5. Hahaa. I do have an unyeilding chest that is by far the best piece I have.
---
I would love to be able to launch project paradise like we used to
---
I hate the response time and the not they use
---
Stimpaks
---
Molotovs
---
Fully modded Baseball Bat
---
Purified Water
---
Fully modded sniper rifle
---
PA was one of the things I enjoyed low level. Hunting them down, learning where they spawn, where they can be hidden. Gave me a good reason to explore.
---
Gotta catch them all.
---
Have 1 of each that you can find just from a collectors perspective, but only use the 1 set. Now if only they could be displayed safely (just like FO4)
---
Noticed that evens are buggy as hell lately.  Just did irrational fear and the handyman just kind of meandered around until time ran out between first and second hive.  Everything was dead after first hive.
---
Honestly, this Line In The Sand bug is so much fun. All these explosions remind me of Fasnacht! 🥳
---
Ive seen one spawn several occasions at Treetops in Mire.
---
Dont think so.  You will know if and when it happens based on one thing:
---
1)  when people start flooding the boards with 'my account was wiped please help with gear' posts.
---
Yup, that's the only way I can play it and have fun.
---
Also Radiation Rumble and Line in the sand
---
Maybe you ought to get better at finding bush wookiees then, instead of complaining that they're "playing the game wrong." It's a valid win strategy regardless of whether you like it or not.
---
I literally just got the idea after reading about greedy endgamers clearing out someone's vending machine of Fixers and wanted to offer something similar without all the toxicity.
---
I found some items on the ground (not on a corpse, not in a loot bag) of a Medical Scanner and Osmosis Kit. I've never had to fetch equipment for Ward for weeks now. Just talk to him and the quest completes. Beautiful.
---
Also, the Rocksy Rep bug.
---
I dig it, challenges are fun, seeing the score bar go up is fun. I figured this would attract naysayers too. I already see someone basically calling you a shill.
---
I do the BP in Apex too, it's nothing more than a bunch of challenges and in it's first state it was a super grind as it evolved they made it a lot easier to level it up. One way they do that is by saving your weeklys, some are a bit more difficult but give you a whole level (110 total) and some give a good chunk of xp. The xp needed gets reset at tuesday down to 9k and with each level it raises to a cap of 54k. So if you have all your challenges done you can still grind it out but it takes hours to gain a level. The dailies reset no matter what and just give you xp 12k in total I believe.
---
I think in time it'll change too I mean it took Apex awhile to fix theirs but now it's in a sweet spot. It has a content drip too new stuff like every 3+ months and a couple of events that are hit or miss with mainly paid skins.
---
So I'm not sure why people think this BP is terrible and I'm sure it's being tweaked. Gamers are so fucking negative, as someone said in here the other day "No one stops to appreciate what we have, just to complain about what we don't"
---
Watch out. We got a keyboard cowboy here. I’m always fascinated by people of lower intelligence like yourself. You cannot develop your intellectual comments and you will not admit when you’re mistaken. You low intelligence brings you to just calling people “stupid” as if your words are going to make someone feel like they’ve been bested by you. 
---
You clearly are clueless with this game and just vomit words onto the screen like you know what you’re talking about. You are wrong. We all know you’re wrong. Call us stupid all you want but it’s not a good look for you mate.
---
Wow.  Way to be the villain in your own story.  Grats on your junk legendaries though I guess.
---
Normally the packs do get rotated back around and quite commonly on discount, just depends if you’re willing to wait, got no ETA but would think at least a few months before it’s back again.(someone else might know better I’ve been back 6 weeks and haven’t seen any double ups on the bundles)
---
Hi have been reading the forums to learn more about the game, and keep seeing the term Fixer. What is that?
---
Bruh stop acting like a dick to a level 105 because he wanted to get some legendarys You ever heard of SCRIP ? Maybe TREASURY NOTES ? You deserve to get only nocturnal legendarys
---
Yeah. Im at line in the sand and nothing has spawned. FFS!
---
Sadly that won’t happen because that would cause major anger from the high lvs so they won’t wipe anyone S items
---
Even without the 'magic' shotguns it's viable.  
---
The fact that each pellet acts as a hit in VATS has some fun implications.  With four leaf clover you can pretty much crit every other shot so there's a lot of synergy with the luck &amp; crit stuff.
---
In Line In The Sand [this was every ghoul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9j3heYZAk8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2) When I aimed for their legs &amp; let others mop them up.  It was hilarious.

10 raw flux. 1 hardened mass, 1 glowing mass and 1 high rad fluid crafts one stable flux.  The other materials drop from enemies inside of nuke zones.  Start farming those and stashing them before you bother picking anything.
---
I do struggle with the greed on display in some vendors. The prices of some of the garbage legendaries is contemptible.
---
Assuming you can find the pieces of armor while you’re out exploring, or a person is nice enough to craft the pieces for you. 
---
Raider power armor level 15
---
Excavator Armor level 25
---
T-45 armor level 25
---
T-51 Armor level 30
---
T-60 need to be level 40
---
Ultracite Armor need to be level 50
---
X-01 Armor need to be level 50
---
Yes. A small house sized mansion.
---
It's not random. Luck affects the durability of items you loot. 
---
"*Luck is a measure of general good fortune, and affects the recharge rate of Critical Hits as well as the condition and durability of items that the player loots.*"
---
Most important is to not use turrets.
---
Don’t know who they are but now I have something to research
---
There are nukes in this game you know - Look up his camp and...
---
Berry Mentats don't exist in NW. There are a handful of combat drugs - Fury, Psycho, Overdrive, Med-X, and Bufftats - but like the perk cards, they've been modified for NW.
---
Wouldn't they come out of the stealth boy if they attack?
---
Nah- he was still firing and hadn’t caught my attention.
---
Except blueprinting an item does not require one to permanently SAVE the blueprint.
---
Except blueprints are not as fucky and finicky or the blueprint workaround wouldn't exist.
---
Except blueprints work 90% of the time.
---
I was trying to help the guy with a workaround.  Nobody said the root cause was being fixed.   Only that he could use a workaround and solve his particular problem.  Let the OP decide if this helps or not.  Nobody is arguing that the system isn't broken.
---
The AFKers annoy me too. Especially when you get one as a random on your team.
---
This, 10,000%. Ironically, the people who didn't dupe and are acting all morally superior are proving themselves to be the most vile, petty individuals in the community. Gimme a duper over these salty crybabies any day of the week 😂
---
No. I want to get recognition and expose how shitty Bethesda is.
---
Thanks, yes, I've noticed they eat up budget in a nasty way.
---
No it is not random.  
---
LUCK effects the durability when getting drops.   Cook and eat those Scortched Livers(Lungs?).  And yes this also mean Uyl helps with drops ... Just another way it is totally skewed.
---
INT effects durability when crafting.   Always craft your Secret Service armor or gold weapons with as much INT as possible.  Bobbleheads, Berry Mentats, scorched brain/brainfungas soup, full uny, building group.
---
I want them to do what Apex does which is save your weeklys. I started 4 weeks late on one season and managed to get 110 just by grinding out the saved challenges and a lot of grinding. Now I'm 9 levels away from maxing this season (not FO76) but knowing I can come in a week or two before it ends and snatch up 9 levels "quickly" is nice to know.
---
Thanks. This is a 3 star. I actually got a second 3 star bloodied combat rifle later last night. Crazy day.
---
Consider every kill in the event and the event itself give that 8%, so events with lots of kills like Line in the Sand, Radiation Rumble or Guided Meditation the bonus from the kills will definitely be more than just the bonus for the event.  For event with few mobs like Feed the People or Tea Time probably not so much but even then its probably closer than you think
---
I've got a pretty big house and shop that are well decorated. The big thing is no turrets, limited lights, and as few wires/ conduits as possible
---
&gt;goth white skinned nuka dark.
---
Huh... didn't know I wanted that.
---
I let him collect chems for 30 mins. And tell you the results.
---
Chinese helps a lot but it’s not like being in a nuke zone. Rads will climb to full bar in about two minutes game time, if that. The armor is a game changer, though, for sure.
---
MY EYES! MY BEAUTIFUL EYES!
---
Must be nice i mean for some reason I’ll finish an event and go to do another one and there will be none available
---
I built a 3x3 2 and a half story colonial style home fully furnished with a wrap around porch, internal walls, a 2x1 maintenance room, 2x1 guest house and a fenced in astroturf lawn and managed to fully furnish the inside of the house. If you watch what you use it isnt a problem, if you place too many high budget items, you will have issues.
---
It was getting popular until the 7th. Some asshole spammed chat with typical NPC messages and chat was disabled to implement some security (i guess). People can't have fun anymore.
---
For sure.
---
I don't see them significantly improving the odds unless the entire game is on the ropes and they're doing anything and everything to keep active players, so I was just spitballing the most reasonable way they could implement a guaranteed roll-your-own legendary, since I've already given up on finding my dream gun.
---
Wait yellow helps? Really? That’s honestly pretty cool
---
Dont forget to utilize the search function here. Chances are, someone has asked questions before that you may have now. 
---
Most importantly, have fun!
---
Being incumbered and being the only one to collect ore is very frustrating.:(
---
Are you attempting your own Riverside? If so, I fully approve of the idea and can't wait to see what you build! Resurrect the Order! The wasteland NEEDS the Mistress, more now than ever! (Sorry, I'm just a tad obsessed with that faction, if you couldn't tell).
---
I agree with you on this he need to stop beings a arse to a grinding player
---
all i can recommend is get discord on your phone or a tablet and use that.
---
I was just trying to male them different.😅
---
They can’t all be white blondes. 😓
---
Same. I've been stuck with my bloodied DCG with limb damage but now you can't cripple the queen or damage the limbs so being a melee build just got a lot more annoying to keep her down
---
Not likely, thats about 10k score behind
---
I agree with you on this bandit he is effectively ruining a players grind because he wants to feel a bit of joy in his sad life
---
Just special snowflake logic sometimes. we can’t sensor everything, all we can do is get over it.
---
Yeah I use unyeilding and as soon as I switch to stealth suit over weight go slow wouldn't be as bad but I always get caught by death claw with no ap left lol
---
Most people don't seem to understand what the bonuses on the teams even are. To often I join a server and don't see a Building team. And when doing event, there doesn't seem to be that many people at them, so don't get why everyone seems to make Event teams.
---
Fallout 76 bad, upvotes to the left, gold at the top ;) /s
---
Hit or miss for me.
---
only if i can drop a turd in it when . you build a freaking maze or gigantic cluttered fill trash pile and it takes 10 minutes to locate your vendors which are behind your rad shower.  or the ones over cliffs or in the air and i fall to my death due to your spawn placement.
---
Fair enough.   I stand by the fact that I receive duplicates.   The example I used evidently is poor.   Given that I am grinding a specific event that has a high drop chance.   Thing is I have received other known plans as well.    RNG is going to RNG.
---
What’s wrong with voice chat? You don’t  like hearing people burp, fart, play brain dead music, random gibberish, people yelling in the back ground, kids crying, parents yelling, blunt sounds coming form hitting the skin. 
---
What’s not to like.
---
Hmmmm....well, you might want to wait for the dailies to pop in a couple of hours, so you can get double-benefits.
---
Thank you for being one of the cool people that turn off team fill if they intend to do solo play. It's always a little frustrating to have a group of randos where only 2-3 members of the team want to play as a team, and the other(s) want to sneak off and do their own thing.
---
Not nearly as frustrating as having AFKers as random teammates, though. They annoy the hell out of me.
---
Radroaches. Easy to kill.
---
Equip Pharma Pharma &amp; Super Duper perks. Craft Stims   with those two &amp; you'll be rolling in them in no time.
---
I say complete your weeklies or dailies, and then get on tushima
---
I agree, I made a post on this a while back. We concluded that they will never ever add this into the game as if we were able to decorate with any and all junk we wanted, then Bethesda would be unable to sell small floor decorations o  the atom store as we would just find the in game equivalent and place it down ourselves.
---
So basically businessmen make games less fun.
---
I wish this sub didn't protect scumbags with the don't name people rule. This guys deserves to be called out.
---
*Gain six levels while playing with your feet while only drinking Game Fuel*
---
I’m only about level 40 something, and I haven’t even done the overseer side of the main quest either so I would have to find it from another player instead of a plan.
---
I’ll probably say the jet pack when in events it’s fun flying high sky or seeing someone do it and die from fall damage
---
I've had a few events like this also. It was a little worrisome at first, just standing around waiting for mobs that never showed. This happens frequently, as well as killing enemies who just suddenly freeze in place and can't be looted. Between that and the general slowdown of public events in general, 76 is running very strangely lately.
---
If the events rewards, treasury notes, and completion xp were incentive enough, people would probably do the event as intended. 
---
However, with xp being the key to grinding Season 1 beyond the daily and weekly challenges, players will prefer to kill and gain xp and loot. 
---
You're putting up meager rewards against potential legendaries and a considerable amount of xp farmining. So yeah, very few players will actually want to farm the ore. 
---
If Bethesda wanted to fix this, they could greatly lower the xp given by the ghouls. And boost the xp from the tougher enemies that spawn after a certain amount of ore is deposited.
---
None of Fallout's prefabs snap to anything. Bethesda has demonstrated over and over again they don't play the game!
---
I am still going to log in and get dailies this weekend yeah. But still not sure how to commit most of the time.
---
I was on a new character yesterday about level 14 or 15 i think, had to kill a few waves of scorched at morgantown airport. Thought it was weird that nobody showed up to help, but as soon as i had finished and the cargobot came to drop the box of loot on the ground, i see this level 200 something player uncloak from invisibility and start hauling ass toward the box of loot. I already knew what was gonna happen so i had to loot everything in the box before I could even tell what it was. As soon as he got to the empty box he  just fucking fast travelled away probably to another unsuspecting noob
---
Both? Get your F76 on during "peak" hours to ensure more Events are being triggered like SBQ and Encryptid to get the most out of the XP bonus. I went from 30 to 50 on my second toon in like 3 hours yesterday.
---
Plus it's meant to be something you work on for the 10 weeks as they add new stuff during the period. It's just something to do basically. I guess I'm a "MMO grind fanatic" though.
---
Right. Like I said I love the game,  but we need new stuff to do.  Grinding the same events for scrip, bullion, and score gets boring.
---
Amen - kinda over the whole 'newbie intro'. It's charitable and good on them for trying to help but real talk when I walked out of the vault ages ago the last thing I wanted is to be coddled and given everything.
---
I wanted to SURVIVE and do it off my own back.
---
Way I look at it the other game is always gonna be there if I really want those rewards....but then again I never buy stuff on launch so I'm use to waiting.
---
I was visited by the Observant Radstag 3 times in a week and then never saw him again.  Kinda miss the pale coated SOB.
---
Don't use turrets! Make your structure smaller (roofs, floors, ceiling take up a lot of budget). Then you can decorate to your hearts content!
---
They wiped high lvls before... after the first banwave in the history it took over a year for a friend to get unbanned just so he could get a completely wiped lvl 0 account back 😜
---
Every time I hear someone compare a word to the N-word, this automatically comes to mind:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwMgtDrR46M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwMgtDrR46M)
---
It was a generalization on my part. To me logically thinking, if you are at 20% health all the time it makes you kinda squishy. Not hating on the builds, just making a point that I get the appeal of fences and tents.
---
Yeah I’ve started carrying one around. Got my ass handed to me by level 20 floaters today, was a bit humiliating considering I’m a high level
---
Do you have a bunch of turrets and lights?
---
Done this far to many times to count lol
---
I think text chat would change it, but then I'm afraid of what crazy shit people would say. My last MMOs (Black Desert, not for everyone but worth checking out I'd say) server chat was just...*shudders*
---
they just hit us again xD
---
Unless you want a ton of inert flux, only farm flux for what you need &amp; have crafting mats for. Anything after that is a waste of time and space.
---
Depends on the size of the building and how much detail you want to put into the furnishing honnestly. Definitely avoid as many stories as you can because that doubles the amount of walls every level, but if you build a modest sized house it should be doable. I've build some pretty lavish fully furnished houses within budget, but I almost always hit max when I am done.
---
First time i've never had enemies spawn for an event. And now twice in a row. Gonna try another event.
---
Kinda the same story I was trying to drop some purified water and stims for a new player and a level 200+ player kept trying to run over and steal the bag. After several trys of me dropping it for the new guy and then picking it back up when the high level guy would run over I finally just left. Some people just suck.
---
Maybe the character he plays is a \*\*\*\* but he's OK.
---
Nah what am I saying - probably sells dodgy financial instruments to pensioners .
---
True. I've always loved the pin-up art style, and honestly I could see Nuka-Cola being advertised on something [like this](https://i.imgur.com/pmjczJj.jpg). Having a persona/look/girl (or guy) for each flavor would make a lot of sense and add some much needed diversity. Imagine what the face of Nuka-Cola Wild could be, since it was in direct competition with Sunset Sarsaparilla (and it's mascot, Old Festus). Some handsome cowboy gunslinger or something.
---
Yea, the Crater raiders in 76 are not really the typical savage group. Though I would argue that's why we don't see them in the "future". I guess the other ones that were wiped would be that... And other locations not struck by E.L.E.-type circumstances like the Scorched Plague had their typical raiders... Meg would be wiped by the other groups most likely. 
---
The whole world collapsed and it never recovered. People do try to form groups to stay together and survive. But the bigger groups never manage to cooperate. Things like countries, governments, police don't work anymore... The smaller hubs are there, sure, but they never become anything bigger. Even the closest thing to a new country / government on the north american continent, the NCR, failed eventually (at least that's the picture painted in New Vegas).

Here is a video that explains magic shotguns: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHu4CErJXU4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHu4CErJXU4).
---
Huh never heard of that no idea why you down voted me I simply had no clue that happened anyway I’m gonna quit if they do wipe my account
---
I am leaning this direction too. Grinding this weekend could save me several hours later.
---
Most of my budget will usually go into walls, lights, and conduits/power connectors. It is worth taking the time to really plan it out, and consider which lights are redundant because they are too close to other ones. I can imagine that internal walls would take up huuuge amounts - *especially* if you're doing the double-sided wallpaper trick.
---
Doesn't seem like it worked. Perhaps he should try, I dunno, being a decent human being. Kinda like how dupers were when they were giving people free stuff while he was sulking in the corner with the rest of the crybabies 😂
---
This sub is one hell of an echo chamber man. Say anything negative even in the slightest way and youll piss off their hivemind lmao
---
Nobody in public teams actually expect to do stuff as a team. It's just a great way to get some extra buffs. Feel free to mooch away! (since you're really not mooching anything)
---
I plan to let it run for a week or so then share the numbers,I also posted the link over on the casual sub since a number of folks there no longer hang around here.
---
Players will also move around to try and get headshots on her as she moves and to dodge spawning mobs.
---
Which rewards were these?
---
Oh. I had no idea. They sure like rng. Thank you.
---
I think it's more of a flex thing. "Look at me I've been here since season 1 and you can't get this sweet, sweet skin."
---
Hey, sorry I don’t have an answer to your question but am curious if you’re able to scrip the power armor pieces if you don’t like the effects? I will be starting my strangler heart armor set soon and don’t know how it works lol.
---
Turrets, lights and crops take most of the building budget. Also don't have anything stored, that eats budget too!
---
Exactly, (good job with the gun btw pity this bug exists) it’s getting pretty unbearable at this point. I mostly stick to building my camp for two hours then relocating, combat is just a bit too wack :(
---
On the contrary, I wish we could have a world chat, everyone just groups up in the center and we all lasted 30 minutes until we all started burning. More XP for all, cause no one's really looking for bragging rights (there are none anyway) or achievements per se. The only incentive is cosmetics and a number associated with a singular character.
---
The ones which the last one is the ghillie suit
---
8 turrets and 3 lights.
---
Fast travel bug. I absolutely LOOOOOOOVE that bug. Like alot!
---
I have noticed something strange with camps.  
---
My main has a camp setup with all the indoor stuff laid out etc.  
---
My alt I been playing is super lazy and hasn't built a single wall or floor or nothing.   I literally just dropped all my crafting tables bed stash vending machine generator etc on the road right in front of pleasent valley.   Like its the laziest camp you ever saw.  
---
More people visit hang around and use the facilities here than in my mains.  And they are in exact same spot.      Also it seems to get attacked less and just by legit wandering mobs and i dont even have a single turret.
---
Yeah exactly heres me on ps4 having the time of my life because of the loot i got from dupers selling there wares !
---
:D
---
I’m a huge BOS fan so finding their breadcrumb trail to Fort Defiance and their camp in the marshland area of the map were my favorites. Excited for them to return and see what all changes as the Brotherhood takes back Appalachia
---
Holy shit, what did you do to get cut off? Usually resorts will put up with a lot of bullshit to sell you drinks lmao.
---
You absolutely did pull the female card, not everything has to do with that. Some people are dickheads because they’re dick heads. Fo76 is the only online community I’ve been involved in where i haven’t gotten shit for being a girl.
---
🔥HOT FIRE🔥
---
I want a tip jar I can steal from when someone is selling hundreds of mounted heads.
---
I would like some garage style display shelves for my red rocket garage. Think dirty looking oil covered shelves that you can display tools on etc.
---
EXACTLY!!!
---
See you get what I mean. And the reason I thought alien for quantum was that quantum was the most futuristic of the flavors.
---
Same, but with Paper Mario ;)
---
I’m right there with you. Hit Rank 46 last night. I’m finding the dailies to take less than an hour, so I’ll probably get on at noon, knock them out, and switch.
---
At the end of the day, always do what’s best for you. Letting a game turn into a chore is a sure wire way to lose any of the joy it brings. Don’t get burned out.
---
I’m going to get to rank 100 for free, once season 2 comes out, I’ll check the rewards. If they’re lackluster (like this season), I’ll evaluate my desire to get to 100 again. As I see it, I have plenty of PA, weapon, and armor skins to satisfy 8 characters. I literally just want the wallpapers and that fireplace door... and with Season 2 surely being BoS related (whom I’ve always hated as a faction), it’s pretty obvious what the theme/cosmetics will be.
---
Anywho, rant over...
---
TL:DR - do you and enjoy your free time how you see fit. No one needs to feel obligated, in a pandemic no less, to spend their free time being miserable.
---
&gt; Also don't have anything stored, that eats budget too!
---
Wow I didn't know that. I don't have much stored but I'll clean it out. Thanks.
---
Honestly that was amazing and the production value was 👌
---
Yeah, if your definition of endgame is farming SBQ, many builds that are otherwise viable in open world would be extremely frustrating in a fight where you’re doing nothing but waiting around, waiting for your chance for a hit.
---
Top marks for stealth!
---
Had the same thing happen twice at Mama Dolce's the other day. First time I was there with 4 other people and except for the initial mobs that were there before we started the machines, nothing else showed up. I assumed it was a hacker killing everything as it spawned and I just wasn't seeing it.
---
The second time I was there by myself and same thing happened so I figured it must be a server issue.
---
Hit some of the 50s up too! 
---
Personally am level 39 but plan on leveling to 50 later. I’ve only ever played to grind levels so far by making my base near a Deathclaw spawn and resetting. Went from 15 to 39 and got bored. 
---
I have a decent amount of mats but not as many as someone who played normally would’ve had by level 39 lmfao
---
True, I would like to see it fit the theme more. Never really thought about it till now. The Ghillie is glitched for me too lol...
---
The turrets are you problem, loss them and you'll have a ton of budget back
---
Xbox Live has text chat already.
---
M8 i didnt downvote you
---
Yes, the Detect Dead spell from Skyrim should be included to complete Fallout's school of Alteration magic. It already has Detect Life with Berry Mentats.  There may as well be something useful to find those corpses that love to disappear. And Fallout 76 is already afflicted with Jeff Gardiner. With every update the game is basically becoming more and more like ESO anyway.
---
Also get stable flux as a reward for completing Scorched Earth.
---
Nope, from what I heard first unbans gonna start happening  minimum in the next two weeks
---
Meat week :(
---
It happens to me after playing nw. Restarting the game should fix it
---
Oh I know- I’m 36, so there are many other priorities in life hahaha 
---
I send the wrong ones too sometimes, but at least I’ll correct them right away- I know it’s just a game, but it’s still social and I go out of my way to not piss off anyone 🤓
---
The original post here presented the side of this happening that’s annoying as all hell- greedy players out for only themselves...and you can tell. 
---
Mine was more just that accidents and ignorance happen- I may be L50+, but before the past couple weeks with public teams, I’ve almost exclusively played on my own- rarely have a mic on, and certainly wouldn’t have known the ‘protocol’ as that guy expected. 
---
Anyway, no big deal- I slept well last night hahaha
---
I believe someone from Bethesda made a comment in their forums about it. I saw it linked earlier this week. If my wifi didn't suck at work I would try to track it down.
---
Essentially: Extra dailies were supposed to just be for weekends. Then due to people complaining that it went back down to the usual on Monday and related frustration over auto-completed challenges, they said they would do the increased number of daily challenges until the 20th. I believe it was the same post that talked about adding logging to try to pin down why challenges are being autocompleted.
---
Rank isn't entirely based on skill, though - you'd have to implement a different kind of ranking system, maybe one based on multiple factors, to have a truly skill-based ranking system. I'm level 100 in NW and I consider myself a low-mid tier player at best, but I've been playing long enough, and with skilled teammates, that I got to 100 anyway. 
---
Conversely, you have hardcore players that have 2-3 different NW characters of varying levels, just because they want to try something new - their lower-level characters will still completely annihilate the average player at their level.
---
I definitely agree that kills ought to get a lot more XP, though. At least 50-75 XP, maybe 100+ XP.
---
And regardint quit, if you love the game il recommend to just make a new psn account and quick lvl a char. At the same time already start looking to get some decent gear back by trading as long as ppl still sell them for dupe prices
---
Yes, that's part of our investigation as well.
---
I got it yesterday with this whole xp bonus I'm constantly seeing the score bar popping up.
---
He's talking about going dark, ie taking your camp off the map, not completely disabling your vendors.
---
I can slightly argue against the squishiness; with the correct perks (barbarian, ironclad, dodgy, serendipity), damage intake is nearly no problem. top that off with certain mutations (speed demon &amp; herbivore, i think?) there is an effect wherein as long as you're moving around, you auto-heal even mid battle. granted we're still killable, but it's a bit of a challenge (for mobs anyway).
---
the 20%(19%) health is the whole point in making the high defence/DMG avoidance active. to be honest it's almost like having a full health bar, in terms of how many hits it takes to die.
---
I see &amp; respect your points/opinions, but i have to disagree, having firsthand experience being bloodied
---
Yes chameleon drops
---
Yup you're gonna miss out on that and score rewards, was it worth it let me twerk it
---
did they buff yao guais, recently?
---
i've been wrecked by them recently.
---
I get it with the mouth harp. I thought I was going insane!
---
I really just wish everyone could agree to be nice and let all players get a shot in on a legendary. I'd say most people are cool about it, but some people are just so selfish...ie. the player mentioned.
---
Pretty sure the lack of sun and good looking women contributed to me wanting to move here haha. Alaska is a beautiful place though! Ive been down to Ketchikan, Sitka, and Juneau. The panhandle is gorgeous.
---
I'm not a developer so I can't speak to that system that they implemented for the autocomplete bug. I'm not sure if the same thing applies to the fast travel bug, but I can ask.
---
I'm also rank 46. I just plan to get to 80 though and use atoms on the rest. I really want that gatling gun skin so might aswell get to the end. 
---
Either way I will have fun. But my friends are starting GoT tonight too and it always fun talking about new discoveries and strategies.
---
I think I will buy a couple energy drinks and put sufficient time into both.
---
If i own two cars and buy new set of tires to one of them, do i get another set for the second car for free?
---
No I don’t really wanna do it all again I’m lv 554 and I didn’t dupe so I’m not doing it because Bethesda fucked up
---
Unyielding is a legendary prefix that can be on **any piece of armor**, wood, leather, marine, and definitely urban &amp;forest scout.  Like you've found the bloody damage bonus is game changing you'll find these unyielding stat boosts almost as good.  Though it takes time to collect the full set, and then you'll start to look for good pieces (scout, combat, SS) that also have a good 2nd or 3rd star effect.  Check out player vendors sometimes you'll find 1* unyielding for cheap.
---
+10 or +15 STR and a backpack will probably put you at 300 carry weight, not far below (non-excavator) power armor.  The additional sneak bonuses of high agility will let you avoid anyone detecting you to hit you in the first place.
---
Adrenal Reaction mutation is basically a bloody mutation, lower hp = more damage, stacking with bloody.
---
Serendipity gives you about a 50% chance to avoid all incoming fire at low health.  Throw in dodgy and your 300+ AP from 30 agility will further reduce incoming problems.
---
junkies minigun FFR 10% while aiming.  junkies .50 cal with Limb damage.  Fixer TSE.  Junkies bone hammer. Junkies Explosive Blackpowder.  Bloodied Tesla.  Mutants Bow.
---
IDK why i carry so many weapons, probably bc my stash is full.  My bloodied tesla is a 3\* if someone got a junkies tesla 38 for trade. xbox.
---
Not yet, a had 2 more friends get hit yesterday.
---
I agree if u wanna dupe and ruin an amazing game so be it but when an invincible naked ass hole punches me to death in NW that pisses me off!!
---
Was what worth it ?I bought a paddle ball of someone on reddit that’s it :(
---
This has been going of for over a month now.  At first it was weird, but now it legit feels like a punishment.  Also I get the sound of a mortar exploding when I exit the legendary exchange machine, but it feels like it's supposed to be there.
---
6.5
---
a way to restore lost items. usually happens due to the crappy servers/netcode.
---
Turrets, lights and crops use a lot of budget. People always forget to mention crops.
---
I found a flat area with NOTHING INTERACTING and I STILL CANT BUILD IT maybe god just hates me

At least you’re better than the BASTARDS who use frog legs to jump constantly and rain down explosives.

Was that worth it?
---
First of all, I didn't refer to the score system as content.
---
Second, my comment still stands, if we didn't have anything to do between wastelanders and the colossal event, I would be complaining there's nothing to do.
---
No :(
---
That is a perfectly natural response to hearing a random mouth harp.
---
No worries, but I'd consider joining building teams a bit more, either way. No one actually expects teams to work together once you join. It's more about sharing perks and increasing stats (w/Intelligence you earn XP quicker too). I am a primarily solo player also, but you can bet that the first thing I do when I join a world is find a team or create one. I'm not missing out on extra XP or a shared perk if I can help it! And sometimes, you'll find yourself actually completing a public event with a team member too! That's when you thumbs-up or wave to say howdy, and then go off on your merry way once again. My only gripe with public teams is that if you are going to have a full convo with someone in the room with you, please mute your damn mic. Literally NO ONE wants to hear your one-sided conversation while exploring Appalachia. I promise. It's really just not as cute as you must think it is.
---
i love a good bush wookie win. in my last one . i was waiting to kill the other guy. but the scorched beast said no bro you just rest i got him.
---
I think we all should get our own loot when it comes to taking down these big bosses. Some people are just trash
---
11 out of 10. It has too much water.
---
1. She'll only stagger if you are using staggering perks. She's fine to be shot at in the air, as long as you're on the ground.
---
Just do a dry run before you pop the nuke, run through WS and don't kill a single mob.
---
It would be difficult unless they had a friend on that server to anchor to, or had you as a friend.
---
Knowing bethesda, it would be at rank 200+
---
Commie bot best bot. :D
---
The good news is that if he moved it, you should be able to move it. The bad news is if he added tricky items or hung things on the wall or really expanded your “footprint” you may never find a spot. I’d suggest trying to plant it in the Whitesprings golf course somewhere, lots of flat areas with no obstructions. If it works you can remove the janky bits and find a spot you like better.
---
Agree. I want to be able to explore and read all the terminals, listen to all the holotapes, etc. but at present it's really not feasible to try and absorb the storyline. I'd love to be able to access it and browse through everything at my own pace.
---
Yea, im fine with it draining ap fast, Ive never been a VATS player anyway, in any fallout game.
---
And im not saying they are tough enemies. Its more a specific problem with spin up weapons I guess, it just makes it annoying, and I hate wasting ammo, and thats what happens with these little buggers. ha.
---
In general I find running explosive legendary effects a real pain without either Fireproof perk or Dense torso mod. With one of those you can shoot the ground inches in front of you and do no damage to yourself.
---
Curse u aqua scummmmmm
---
Plenty of people did the daily challenges, what they didn't like was the unnecessarily complicated and awkward design of some of the dailies, not the reward, nobody asked for less atoms and freedom to pick what to get with it.
---
If you think wanting good design is the same as being a bandwagoner who expects perfection you're a fool.
---
And there's plenty of ways to add score rewards that don't involve dailies and weeklies, one off challenges, playstyle challenges, challenges that favor interaction with the world in more meaningful ways than stack xp multipliers and do the same shit you've done a hundred times.
---
How about getting a bonus score reward if you complete project paradise with all 2-3 animals alive? Full health bonus to encourage healing builds to come forward?
---
How about Radiation Rumble giving some score the quicker you complete it and with as many scavengers alive as possible?
---
Meditation event, how about never letting any speaker get destroyed?
---
Enclave events giving bonus if no bots die, or if you fix all the lures quickly?
---
Bonus rewards for keeping bots in Lode Baring alive for the entire duration?
---
The list could go on and on as far as rewarding an effort with score rewards that don't depend on daily gating, you're just too busy being content with garbage and telling people who don't like mediocrity they're haters.
---
Thank you!!
---
Frequently? Within one year ago from today we have got Wastelanders, one map for Nuclear winter, mischief night and the now removed vault raid. Not a whole lot.
---
 But some weapons are good enough to break the barrier. For example, an instigating revolver can oneshoot lvl68 scorched or lvl60 supermutants without gunslinger perks. A stalker rifle means headshots all the time with no rifleman perks.
---
Ah that solves the problem?
---
4 events in a row now.
---
Radiation Rumble
---
Line in the sand
---
Bots on parade
---
Uranium fever.
---
switching server now
---
I don’t know about the snapping part but it would make the prefabs actually useful if I could place them on my own foundation blocks. Unless it’s touching WV soil I can’t seem to place any of the prefabs.
---
They should make loot for the event apply to everyone who participated. That would be an easy fix, and i never understood why it wasn't done that way.
---
He just moved the camp not the building. I swear I’ve found like 4 flat empty spots it wouldn’t build on due to “intersecting another object” that’s why I’m going so nuts haha, it’s gotta be a glitch or something it’s ridiculous, it’s not that complicated of a building at all
---
The loot she has is all yours, it is not shared at all
---
Also a good all around heavy is the 50cal, or the gattling gun for ammo efficiency
---
Well done. Not everyone cares about others and the enjoyability of their experience. I’m glad to have others like you, who do. You guys are what make the good outshine the bad and keep this game worth playing. &lt;3
---
That makes zero sense. Shut your damn ass up.
---
This is far from a AAA game. It’s a game developed by BGS’s C-team, Bethesda Austin, running off an old engine. Try to be more critical and less emotional.
---
Just follow the settlers questline when you get there, it's a very handy piece of gear.
---
That’s how it works. Only ghouls I see first trip are in the parking lot or edge housing. Tennis court areas no go. But you have about two solid hours of time to farm, hop out, hop in and repeat. Did it twice this week and had to drop one and two stars by the end and only pick up fluids to even have the room. Despite the first visit being a dud, you’re guaranteed to be full up. You can basically make one large circle each time and the legendary drops plus the fluids are usually very healthy.
---
What's this now?
---
Yes the boom is intended I guess. Not that I understand why. Maybe because the item is destroyed?
---
No. At level 40 it is 2000xp per SCORE level. We only get 2000xp worth of dailies, 2500xp now but they are going to go back and remove two dailies after July 20th. At level 80 it’ll require two days of dailies to level up
---
Hey there! This is currently a bug with Nuclear Winter. We are addressing this one in our next patch.
---
I thought I saw it there recently. It’s pretty small and easy to miss. It’s on the side of the fridge.
---
Just hit the dark matter combat rifle skin... man why the fuck can't we have skins on the fixer... there isn't even an appearance slot on it:(
---
That spawning thing has been in the game since the event been out. You can do it without the camp from fallout first if you know where to stand at. Except they won’t spawn in the middle like the camp method.
---
I believe Bethesda's naming of public teams was intended to confuse people. Bethesda is notorious for confusion, and deception, and going out of there way to take things to extremes. It's all planned!
---
.
---
Yes he is at 48 going on 49
---
playing through pc gamepass
---
I had this problem a while back, and my base was nothing more than 3 floors of 3x4 squares, and 75% total budget. All my own items, all standard turrets with no perk requirements.
---
Literally zero reason I couldn't rebuild it. 
---
Had to break it down and store everything, then rebuild it.
---
Dunno why, but it just works. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I’m a relatively new player, only about a month in. I made an alt low level character to play with my friends who are just getting into it on the PS4. I like having two characters because that means two styles of camps! Also i know WAY more now than when I started, so building the new alt is a milllllion times easier
---
Well then i can only recommend to keep calm and try to be patience with the support team as otherwise they will start ignoring you 😅 speaking from own experience as im one of them who got a lifetime ban in the first banwave of f76
---
&gt;Yea, im fine with it draining ap fast, Ive never been a VATS player anyway, in any fallout game
---
tbh I just get lazy at times. old FO/my first 90ish levels in 76 I didn't use VATS but it *is* handy for those hard-to-see ticks etc in the long grass 
---
yeah the wind-up is precisely why I use a .50 in these situations...however my other primary weapons on my heavy gunner are gat.plasma &amp; Gauss minigun so the annoyance is real lol
---
pip boy color has to be changed via .ini file (PC only)

 &gt; Hey there! This is currently a bug with Nuclear Winter. We are addressing this one in our next patch.

This is a bot providing a service. If you have any questions, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76).[](#AUTOGEN_TSBREPLIEDBOT)
---
If you want to quickly unlock the mods, craft a bunch of the gun with super duper perk level 3 equipped.  Then scrap all the guns you made for chances to learn mods.
---
The weirdest are when people make Events teams and then nobody in them does any events.  Like Guided Meditation will happen, I'll be in a full Events team, there's another Events team on the server, and I end up soloing the event after waiting a few minutes to start it (in case people are finishing up something else).
---
If there is a logic at work here, I'm missing it.
---
cant record gamplay in borderless mode only full screen
---
Problem is I can’t even place it anywhere TO break it down 😭
---
Last night I figured I'd take advantage of the double XP weekend and do a run through the Glassed Caverns.  It was populated completely with level one Eyebots.  That's a new one!  A server hop fixed it, anyway.
---
Good to know. But I guess if you don't have it done I would suggest not joining a public team. Queen fights are big XP so there is no way I'm not going to do that.
---
Should have saved them for an easy completion of "rank up in NW" challenge.
---
Loot is instanced. As for damage rifles are still very effective with the right build. Explosives are fairly pointless at that fight but something like a furious handmade will do more than enough. Heavy weapons mostly have the advantage of not reloading a lot but in the grand scheme of things they don't do much damage per hit and miss a lot. They might look like they're doing all the work but it's usually the bloodied vats builds that kill her.
---
special silenced weapon based on combat rifle but with faster movement speed while sneaking
---
Really thanks for the advice but I have no idea how I’m going to remain calm missing meat week and other events
---
You can scrap from the blueprint. You don't have to place the building to scrap it and everything inside.
---
Do the other materials spoil, or just the flux? Sorry for the dumb question, haven't really explored nuke zones yet.
---
I as well have a paddle ball but didnt get banned 😅
---
Oh yeah i forgot super duper was real.
---
Missing Equipment bug for sure :)
---
In a way, that's truly representative of how the world would actually work in a post-apocalyptic setting. A lot of people would scoop up any resources someone else leaves behind.
---
This! I like this
---
aye. some outfits don't hide the backpack though
---
Neat so now instead of having to work for something they just get the end game handed to them.   How is this better than a duper just going around and dropping stuff at people?   No really because I see the same thing.   To me you are taking something away from them, the experience.    Whats the point in playing if I can just sit around and have people bring me stuff.  You people are weird. 
---
THIS is why we cant have tradable end game items (and why nearly every other game works this way and even gold bullion).
---
How do you know he wasn’t a banned duper🤔🤔?
---
I hate all of Bethesda
---
No shit. It’s super annoying. Especially when your niece or nephew leave the room and we’re all sitting at the lobby but they are AFK because they got killed early so they are spectating
---
Love the game so over all as it stands now an 8.  it would be a 10 if the fixed some of the bugs and broken perks like adrenaline.
---
Tweet
---
Alright. Thank you very much
---
Yes, but the jet pack is visible over your outfit, while the armor is under and not visible.
---
Not at all...
---
Dunno why ya would?
---
Nor do I know why you’d think that was my intent,
---
&amp; use said response.
---
God Bless the interwebs
---
Yes and no. You can wear outfit over SS, but Jetpack still show over it. Sometimes when you swap outfits/armor pieces the Jetpack also gets hidden, but will appear again on fast travels etc.
---
I used to drop them all, now they are prime ammo scrap!
---
Yes but it does not hide the jetpack
---
Fully understand you m8, i had to go through that a long time ago...
---
I'd say a 5 out of 10. The reason is the rewards system sucks ass. You either do events and time for bullion, but then it's another whole grind trying to get good legendary roles for what your build is. 
---
I wish the rewards system let you pick one major attribute like Unyeilding or Vanguard for armor, and Explosive or Anti-Armor for guns or something like that.
---
The other thing that goes into this is the RNG. Doing Faschnadt over and over and over trying to get a deathclaw mask, I think after doing the event 100 times, there should be like a progress bar for getting one. I know that seems contradicting, but for me, I never have gotten a great or rare drop for an outfit in the game. I've done Fly Swatter since beta, and I have never gotten the responder fireman helmet.
---
What I do enjoy is the new team up options in world's. I think that's been a great feature. The events are bad, just at this point, we have only had a few new ones, wish they would revamp some of the originals into something else more fun. I'm just pretty bored with Swarm of Suitors, Tea Time, Jail Break, Line in the Sand, Distant Thunder, Powering up a powerplant, etc. 
---
Anyway just a few of my thoughts I think Wastelanders made an initial huge improvement, but the grind now isn't fun. I am taking a break here soon from it but I'll be back for the fall season.
---
Yes you can. The jet pack will show however.
---
A wife, two children, and a job requiring me to work from home prevents me from that strategy lol. From day one, my plan was get to rank 90 and rank with atoms from there. You get 2000 atoms from the board (10 - 150 atom rewards, and 500 for rank 100) and I’m a FO1 member, so it doesn’t kill me to rank up that way. Plus, the atomic shop has been lackluster, so I’m usually sitting on quite a few atoms. Anywho, 10 ranks is 1500 atoms, which the board itself pays for. I’m not against this strategy from Bethesda to make money, it just won’t be from me where they earn it.
---
Now, back in my twenties that may have been possible lol.
---
Good luck and have fun.
---
Closest you can do is build a shelf and decorate it with stash boxes and floor decor with a conduit and some rugs.
---
she gives random gifts?
---
I disagree. I find this game much more enjoyable with great gear. And still farm even having more than I could ever need
---
But there is more than 1 type of gamer out there
---
Because you can see their entire game history, outside of Fallout 76. It was an established Xbox account.
---
Suffering through the user interface is a feature I guess
---
Thanks, il try that next time, Appreciate the answer.
---
I wanted to store the individual bits and save some materials can you do that?
---
What a punk
---
:(
---
Ok thanks interesting, that could indicate the flawed code was reused from F4 and never fixed.
---
Like I said.  
---
You people are weird.
---
You confused viable with barely working. If pistols were viable people would be using them more.
---
If all hope is lost, just start a new camp, go to your stored items and scrap the blueprints you’ll find inside. That will break down all of the items and list them individually in your stored inventory.
---
Wait and try to build up to 1000 script by level 50. Even if you get a good low level legendary you will replace it with a level 50 weapon eventually. 
---
Also: get the fixer plan before you use them. That way you have a chance of getting a Fixer drop.
---
I don't think so. I think it scraps the whole thing, at least that is the way it used to be.
---
"How to nuke West Virginia this week, also how do I break into the nuclear silo and what's the password to launch the nukes". That oughta do it...
---
50k a minute? Max per kill is 4k, for quests 6k. That would be a very busy minute.
---
So the 15%'s would provide more damage reduction than the pure damage resistance from vanguards? Was thinking of atleast adding some troubleshooters to help me out with the nuke silo runs
---
you keep them
---
Since we’re sharing stories, here’s a few. 
---
1) One Violent Night - they killed the wendigo OUTSIDE of the barn. Not the main in trance. The side one by the stage. Wendigo came from that direction. They ran outside and killed it there. 
---
2) Uranium Fever - I have a personal policy. If you don’t make sure that every player gets a hit, I WILL seek out the next one and kill it in the blink of an eye. I’ve done that event and gotten no legendaries.  Not cool. 
---
3) Guided Meditation, Lode Baring, Line in the Sand, Project Paradise - Ok, not a legendary stealing story, but the gripe ball is rolling and this is actually more annoying to me right now. WTH are you in an event group and not going to events? Sometimes I do building groups for the int bonus, however there are usually one or more event groups. These events (for me anyway) require more than one person. Shortly after the notification, I jump over to them and wait. And wait. And wait. I don’t want to try these alone. To much of a pain for the reward. I’ve watched the timer to start the event run out so many times. It’s not like there are constantly multiple events going at the same time. So where are you? I can see there are 3-9 or more people in events groups. Get your ass over here!
---
Yea I suppose ur right u could do that where u get score for doing certain challenges in events. I actually kinda like that cus then u get ppl to actually rely on other players to get the score rewards from them. And yeah time gating was one thing I didn't like cus to get ahead you'd have to be a serious grinder. But I wouldn't call it garbage by any means.
---
Did it!! Thank you
---
Since you want a basement, here’s a tip that might save you some budget space depending on your location. You don’t have to fill in the basement with foundation pieces. Let’s say you’re making a 10x5 house with a basement. Normally that would take 50 foundation pieces for the basement (then 49 floor pieces for the first story leaving space for the stairs). Instead you could just put the 26 foundation pieces around the perimeter of the basement and leave out the 24 inner pieces. Assuming you’re on flat terrain you might not even notice the difference. And a side benefit is you can plant crops or have a water or resource collector down there.
---
And to me, you are weird.
---
Thank you for the replies everybody. It's time for me to hit the skies
---
There’s more to it than that. Unless you have a crap ton of the materials, you have to do a lot of farming. 
---
Even with ammosmith equipped, you make less per tap of the button than any other ballistic ammo for resources used.
---
My girlfriend and I broke up over a fight about this, she said we needed a break when she didn't feel respected as equals when I didn't want to run around doing dailies on an events team so we took some space , she had been running with a queen team for the past week and now in our get together honeymoon... I asked for a whitesprings intelligence team run and she spazzed.
---
I personally run building team up until queen is quarter and change it to event for the last minute or two.
---
I'll keep that thought in mind when you have kids and they are almost done with a Lego project or a sand castle. Who cares if I break it, it's a toy and can be rebuilt. It teaches that kid that life sucks.
---
That's how you sound. You're just an asshole who wants justify ruining the fun of others for your own enjoyment.
---
Ok so like the comments above I too had this issue till I found out if you run through White Springs and make sure kill EVERYTHING and I mean everything. Then launch the nuke. This will grant you a good spawn of the ghouls.
---
Xbox sadly. I’m like one of the previous posters..I run through Camden Park daily for the easy scrip and the couple of magazines and bobbles that spawn...I’ve already got the whole outfit and way more tokens than I need. Somebody will probably buy them eventually
---
How do you know he dont have 4 other character above 200.   And mules full of stuff?
---
You should have added Xbox Game Pass **for PC** to your title, as it's misleading. You even have a Xbox Help flair.
---
What weapons are you using? I am not having that trouble with melee weapons and VATS.
---
Yea I can understand that. Especially with how legendary weapons r done
---
No you get some as a reward. But if you die immediately afterwards you can retrieve your junk but the flux is always gone.
---
I do have a pretty sweet Vampires flamer laying around, might farm some more fuel and start using that one. Hadnt really thought about vampires, but it makes perfect sence for keeping my hp up. Thanks!
---
Let me go ahead and break this down real slowly for you since you seem to be struggling:
---
The person I responded to stated that the game needs text chat. This tells me that the game doesn't have text chat currently. I can tell this without ever having played it because the person I responded to stated that it needs text chat. I then responded by asking if it really didn't have text chat because that seems like an odd feature for an mmo to be lacking. I then followed up by explaining that I hadn't played the game, because if I had played the game I would obviously know that it didn't have text chat.
---
Now I know this might be hard to comprehend but having not played the game doesn't actually have any impact on asking whether or not a game has a feature. If anything having not played the game is almost a requirement for asking that question since if I had played it I would already know, thus making the question pointless to ask.
---
A more adequate analogy would be if a heart surgeon told me something surprising about heart surgery. As an example let's say a heart surgeon told me that heart surgeons don't use scalpels. Based on my knowledge of how surgery typically works I would find that shocking and even without being a heart surgeon myself could logically ask the question "do heart surgeons really not use scalpels?" since that's a standard feature of surgery.
---
In you're analogy I would have had to have told someone else how they should do something in the game without ever having played it, which isn't even close to anything that happened.
---
Does that make sense now or do I need to break it down even further for you there buddy?
---
Yeah I can totally understand now why they removed that effect from the game
---
You can drop your pup tent within the zone at the edge of the end of the housing on the north east side of the blast. Do this before the blast and then you can fast travel into the zone each reboot. From there you basically head south through the edge housing, down through the tennis court club bldg, out to the south edge housing, to the maintenance bldgs and parking lot, then up to the north west housing..which runs east and ends at your pup tent, one kind of big circle. Drop gear, jump server, rinse and repeat. Check all the housing and offices you can go into, they’re all full of ghouls.
---
Wait, you can't place the C.A.M.P. item itself?! How did he move it without placing it?!
---
Or do you mean the C.A.M.P. is placed but you can't place the actual building? If you mean this, look at the options at the bottom of the screen. One of them is "Delete blueprint" or something. Select that and it'll say "yo, we gon' fuck yo' house, but you gets yo' shit back" (or similar).
---
Or try selecting the blueprint tab and deleting it from there. Now I think about it, that's what I did I think.
---
Was this made before they added the extra dailies?
---
I'd say you got the win I've been working on so a big congrats on that! I've killed players to get the S.C.O.R.E stuff done or to get the achievement on XB1 but putting yourself into the fray like that is too risky when most teams don't work together and you wind up being the last person in your squad and notice that other teams are likely in mic'd party and working in unison. I've been lucky to get a .50 cal a number of times so I have the firepower to back it up but I also wind up with wood armour most of the time to go with that gun.
---
As said numerous times before a battle royale mode in a Fallout game isn't a good fit to begin with but to me, a silent, hidden and wait it out kind of game although boring is how you would to survive in a nuked world filled with marauding packs players and beasts wanting to do nothing more than kill you. To put yourself so willingly into the line of fire goes against a survivalist mentality in my opinion.
---
Well i just want peoples feedback on why or why not they feel the way they do. I’m not dead set on my own ideas, I’m always open minded. I just don’t understand why people just keep downvoting me and my post instead of just expressing their thoughts on the matter or why this wouldn’t be a good idea.
---
You don't need to be borderless. You have discord on a phone or tablet and talk on that
---
So I just made a bookmark to Nukacrypt...It doesn’t feel like you’re doing anything wrong when you’ve got the page saved you know. You never know who’s watching
---
I'll help :) GT is same as username.
---
Haha. I just turned 30. My wife supports my gaming so playing long is no issue, especially with Covid going on. As long as I keep her coffee cup filled I am good to go.
---
But yeah, enjoy. Thanks for the advice
---
I give it an 8. It’s a really great game! It does have bugs and it is grindy but after playing Warframe and coming to this the grind is what I’m used to so It doesn’t bother me. I’m happy to get 100s of hours even 1000s of hours out of a game. I’m only level 27 but I’m having fun exploring and meeting really kind people is a real testament to this community. One thing I would change is to implement a text chat to your server so you can say thing like “hey guys anyone up for Campfire Tales?”
---
Some people don’t have headsets and some people just don’t like talking on them so a text chat for the server you’re on would be nice. ☺️
---
Nothing at all except have too many lol.
---
Thanks for clarifying some of these details. I still have lots to learn regarding the perks or builds in this game. Perception and reality at not always the same. Personnaly I can't do bloodied, Im too OCD. Lol.
---
Fair enough, not garbage, but I certainly wouldn't go as far as calling it anywhere near genius
---
I have a level 55 junkies alt I play sometimes.  Did I twink her from my level 503 main I've been playing since the weekend after launch?  Yer godamned right I did, doing it all over again is so much nicer with the finer things in life.  So she has gear that a fresh faced level 55 would most likely not own.  And every last piece of it I either farmed up or bought legitimately.
---
This guy, without any burden of proof, determined this other player was a cheater and decided to be a jerk to them because of a dress you can just server hop until you get it and a backpack given out during a weekend event.  A backpack that comes from a plan.  And plans were not able to be duped in this last wave.
---
And even if he did cheat who gives a flying frick.  It's PVE, this isn't a competition.  Another players gear, legit or not, is not mine nor any other players problem.
---
Fair enough. You can never be to sure in this community brah.
---
I just want a robot on my settlement that will harvest my crops for me. Or a freezer that helps keep em fresh longer.
---
Are you kidding me and lose out on the kill exp ?!? No way F off lol
---
Why don’t you collect it?
---
Me too
---
Haha, I totally forgot about that kid. When I found him I thought it was pretty funny.  Then as I was leaving I was like "man, this is really sad..."
---
We could get him to BoS and do 1 or 2 missions for him to get acclimated.  Ex: he gets kitchen duty for being a bit of a screw up and needs help gathering tatos and mirelurk meat.  Something like that.
---
The doc posted and the various threads about it do not account for lunchbox effects, double SCORE weekend and I believe it doesnt account for the added extra dailies.
---
If you're on pc hmu, I've got a few 'collected frog' still in inventory (yes, a hoarder), same user name
---
Exactly!
---
I think of it as just putting him out of his misery.
---
Xbox and pc are both entirely seperate versions. So no.
---
Welcome friend, it’s all down hill from here!
---
First time i felt really sorry for it and i approached it thinking something different might happen. Had to blast him into pieces when he went for me. 
---
I leave them alone now. Someone else can find him.
---
Was there a second level 20something tagalong? I feel like I saw this happen yesterday. Your level and there being another lowbie was what stood out. I dropped a lunchbox to try to help everyone out (I'm stacking cranberry, kindred spirit, maxed out inspirational, leader bobble, and lunchbox during double exp event) and *something* happened but I missed it, I just saw an angry emote.  
---
If there was only one lowbie and not a second firing a shotgun too, then this dickbag may be doing this intentionally to spite lowbies tagging things in events.
---
If you read some of the text it says directly that the google doc will not account events or special circumstances like the extra dailies since the dailies will revert back to 7 at the 20th
---
The worst part is when you stop all the ghouls from being able to move using enforcer, you heal up all the NPCs with your fire sword. So you pop on the stealth suit, 4 NPCs up and go try and grab 25 or so you can succeed and suddenly 3-5 people jump in murder everything, then somehow also get 2 or 3 of the NPCs killed.
---
You aren't legit earning 50k a minute. Well done for outing yourself.
---
Well I just meant the idea of a BP was cool for 76. And when I said it was well implemented that might have been a stretch. There r definitely some tweaks but this is just the first one this game has had so I think it's just somewhat of a test run if u know what I mean.
---
Whats your GT?
---
Lmao shut up. Text chat is literally a core feature that's **essential** to any multiplayer game, ESPECIALLY a fucking MMO. I'm tired of you morons making excuses and defending Bethesda's lack of effort into the game.
---
7.
---
Buggy, but fun, with a great playerbase. It is not as far as grindy like WoW...
---
I enjoy it realy much. The engine is fcked up on high end pc, thats 1 point minus. Bugs are the other 2 points.
---
I once got gangbanged staggered locked by 3 yao guai before. no amount of armor or PA could have protected me from that.
---
yes I gave in after my 160th or so level lol. that red on my health bar used to feel so dirty 😂 I'll say it's worth exploring even temporarily, but it's your build and your choice!
---
may I recommend watching YouTube channels such as AngryTurtle, TYR, &amp; Innovsurvivalist for if you're ever needing some incredibly handy tips. they sure helped me a whole lot over these last couple years. 😊
---
Yea I've always wanted that
---
There's a text chat add-on. It's pretty great.
---
Ahh someone just tried to help me but it wouldn't let them through into the quest. I assume I have to complete it solo!
---
Lol you got mass downvoted by blind fanboys that refuse to admit Bethesda's fuck ups with this game.
---
Text chat is the most basic fucking feature you'd expect in a multiplayer game.
---
It's certainly not as good as in-person, but Oxhorn did a [lore video](https://youtu.be/la1GK1VCUxQ) showing all the terminals and such, compiled from other peoples' plays.  I resigned myself to that being good enough for me.  As u/joeyfergie said, it would be great to have some kind of prequel Vault 51 exploration quests, anyway.  Even if you don't play NW, the game lore is its own reward (IMO).
---
Yea I think after the BP, Bethesda should slow down and take time to address quality of life issues, like quest bugs and the like
---
Were you team leader?
---
shut up, narc!
---
Last time it took 4 weeks to never.
---
yeah I got 2 so far an magazine and the s.sledgehammer plan.
---
they have been like that since launch. it is their stun lock that makes them so deadly. which, when compared to 4/76 deathclaws, makes them more of the alpha preditor. #BuffDeathclaws
---
1x Beer Bottle (trash)
---
1x Bourbon Bottle (trash)
---
1x Old Possum
---
2x Radaway
---
1x Rum
---
1x Bourbon
---
The fact that it collects empty bottles is pretty bad. Bad for a Chem User it may be worth it to get some extra Chems from now and then.
---
That's kind of the idea, but until we get the instanced camps (and find out whether they connect to existing camps or whether they are in Whitespring/some other location) for the basement, and scale-wise I'm not sure what I can do. Same here, glad you like the Order too!
---
the time delay between the public events should be shortened. i cant remember the last time i saw a campfire tales or a power plant power up, or upgrade some of the generic event to public so they grant tickets and id be way more enclined o do them.
---
Ima read up on junkies and give it a shot. Thanks! :)
---
WTH, they are going to change it back to the ugly blue one with the VT on the front? That fucking sucks. I love the basic simple red version
---
I prime every Gauss shot gun I am going to keep and they are beasts.  I have a zealots and it is a monster when I fight the queen.
---
When you could infinitely disarm traps for grenades and xp.
---
Well it can only go up from here for sure so that's a good first step ey
---
I ran away from a guy who messaged me later and said "I was trying to give you a gun. Not everyone wants to kill you LOL." Not only did that guy give me a great gun, water and meds, but he taught me to lock up my own water and gave me a lot of other tips. Changed the game for me.
---
I didn't know crops were budget hogs!  I got rid of all but 3 turrets and I'm much more efficient with my lighting.  But if I scrap a few crops that might open up more decorating fun.  Pro tip.  Thanks!
---
Just shoot her legs then when she’s down do what you want with her
---
I am more of a Raider Block than a Foundation Block kind of person. 
---
*I will let myself out*
---
Awesome!
---
Zero turrets, zero spot lights, and no crops should restore like half your budget
---
Yeah I was mate, i thought I could accept help but he said he couldn't get through the door! Gamertag is CJJ1994 if you fancy giving it a go!
---
So if i kill every ghoul first? Before I run the silo?
---
I do love my instigating plasma caster. Think I'll give junkies a go, and grind up the perks needed to run instigating/VATS crit as well. Thanks! :)
---
stupid question where do you deposit the ore?  I experienced the same thing so I started collecting ore but then I realized I had no idea what to do with it.
---
You surely have enough APto vats?
---
I'll give it a whirl mate, GT is CJJ1994 if you fancy a game
---
I could see that having a relation to it, I had an event where it was only maybe 5 of us and she landed pretty often and it was the only time we were shooting at her. With larger groups she seems to land less but that could also be because more people have tents up.
---
I just hope that after the BP, we take the time to address bugs and quality of life issues. Just slow down a bit
---
There you go.
---
Yea my boy 1 shot everything
---
Aye. Forced spawning is nothing new.
---
Well, they should fix bugs like I can not step over a peble if I run...
---
Or the camp building bugs ("you can place that here, it is green... oh... sorry, it is floating about 0.00000000000001 nanometer? Screw it. But it is still green, so you can place it here...")... :)
---
wow she is the wandering guitar person correct?
---
Ofc but it’s like I’m invisible to enemies I can walk in front of them and they be like “waddup”
---
Standing on Tents or Fences should NOT be a problem either!
---
Yea the camp bs gets on my nerves too smh
---
nope she is the astronaut one. Awesome quest line so far.
---
With the amount of time it takes to grind out the bullion and modules to get a full set of what you want I dont see why it can't be superior to all other armor.
---
That basically what I want at this point 
---
fallout 76 to be a elder scrolls online re-skin lol
---
Seems like you don't load in correcrly
---
I've had a couple players drop bags of loot for me. It's very kind and makes it so others can't get it.
---
Hmmm, thanks, I'll play around with that concept. I'm going to use the PTS as a testing ground I think as it doesn't matter if I waste resources.
---
what platform are you on?
---
I have a little visual bug I deal with when I load in..  I have to re-equip and equip the SS torso chest piece so the jet pack is visible. If not the backpack looks like it's halfway into my back and the blue fire is visible without the jet pack is visible. The Jet pack is a true game-changer, love it. Actually, tonight my second character gets her jet pack :) stoked!
---
I think, and I did not know you could do this, is he is saying the team leader can change the team goal from Building to Events, so the bonds would still be in place?
---
I wonder if I can go talk to a deathclaw 👁👄👁
---
I like to creep around in fort defiance. It is spooky in there. Runner-up would be the Deep.
---
I was thinking just two stories, but the basement complicates that a little, but only a little.
---
Are you doing all events? Non public events, forest events, ect...
---
There are a few you can start yourself as well:
---
Riding Shotgun, patrol duty, a couple more I cant remember the names.
---
 If there are absolutely none that's when I switch over to daily quests.
---
It definitely takes longer to find the particular piece of "regular" armor that you want, than what it takes to farm bullions, which by now, everyone should be done with anyway.
---
Or drop the nuke and go farm westek for 20 minutes
---
The one and only sexual tyrannosaur
---
I don't suppose you have a screenshot of the main house? I might go for an unscaled version.
---
I was only using the basic boosts. If you go harder, the experience gain must be insane:
---
Leader Bobblehead with perk to increase its time.
---
Live and Love 8
---
4 x Lunchboxes +100%
---
Brain Bombs Int +7.5
---
Berry Mentats Int +5 with perk to increase its time.
---
Casual Under armour Int +3
---
Egghead Mutation Int +8
---
Herd Mentality Int +3
---
I reached the raider tree yesturday
---
It did for me, but I'll give the killing pre-run a try when I find time :)
---
Guy says don't spoil locations.
---
You go and spoil locations.
---
You are being a dick.
---
The shotgun bug.
---
I had a teammate on a building team get pissed because I was doing dailies and wouldn't watch his back on material farming
---
On the back side of the central platform. There's a big, circular orange relository
---
I'm just daft, I took that page too literally and only looked inside the business and not the trailer. Thanks, I got my magnet now!
---
also after finishing her quest line &gt;!A.T.H.E.N.A (or whatever her name is) usually visits your camp and buys/sells stuff!&lt;
---
Kill all ghoul or have someone kill them while your running silo or you kill them and have someone run silo.
---
The first Ban Wave back in January/February 2019, only a handful of players got suspended and banned. 
---
What's interesting is that it wasn't one punishment across the board. Some suspended players lost everything, they basically had to play the game from scratch. 
---
But some only lost their rank, and got to keep their gear. Some people also got to keep their gear but they were suspended for a full year, it really varied. 
---
The thing is, the amount of people hit were nothing in comparison to what happened this last week. Just my opinion, I don't have any data to back this up, but the servers are consistently half-empty now. 
---
On Xbox, I have about 60 friends that play fallout, and at least 25-35 were suspended. I don't know if they will come back either, I know a few just got the game on gamepass, did nothing wrong, and they were tagged. It's frustrating not knowing what this process looks like, or a timetable. But I think if they are going to review each account, person by person, that's unfortunately going to take awhile. 
---
My view is to punish the real scumbag people, the real dupers, the ones making real money on gameflip should be punished, not a few people trading a copy of a gun they got to some of their close friends. But that's just my opinion.
---
Yeah I hate this as well. I got a corrupted file on PS4 and I had to reinstall a week ago. Lost all my photos I took from old events like meat week and pictures I had of friends who don’t exist anymore.
---
What part about no spoilers do you people not understand
---
Yep, not a new player and just learned that in this thread.
---
Rocksy reputation bug and the camera-emote launch bug
---
You sure you don’t have stuff saved as Storage
---
I think the charge up is the issue
---
I'm sure it's not too far off but I just prefer joining an events team and doing events.  I have things like cranberry relish and my well rested bonus that I use as well.
---
 Some events all you have to do is kill one thing so I'll probably just stick with the events bonus.
---
awesome, any special items she sell?
---
That works if you're the team leader and what you want. Some people like being on building teams and aren't doing events though.
---
You’re very argumentative for someone who could easily test it yourself. People have all told you the same response, either go and look for proof yourself or take them at their word.
---
What’s the point of asking a community a question getting all the same answers and than asking them all for proof?
---
Any half decent text chat these days has tabs where you can filter with just your squad, PMs, global, and individual chat filtering.
---
These have been standard in MMOs and MMOlites for years now. There's no good excuse for Bethesda to not implement it in a game like this. Dark Souls actually has an excuse due to the nature of the game in general. All the lack of text chat does in 76 is just make it more of a damn hassle to actually cooperate and trade.
---
i just favorite wheel all my armor....
---
Give me a moment I'll have to try to pull it off of xbl.
---
If there is a delay, its because I'm at work and dont have good reception.
---
I watched some of their stuff. One thing I realized for me personally that it's more work for me than I'd like to spend. As a 30+ yr old dad with a full time job and two kids and a wife that's a full time student I don't have so much time to focus on such fine details. I went with the heavy build because it's been pretty versatile and low maintenance. I can focus on doing the grinds in the limited hours I have to play. Now, I have an alt that's level 18 rite now. I think he will be my bloody build. I have a few bloodied weapons that I can jump start him with. Definitely worth exploring and beats rebuilding a toon.
---
Same for me at the moment I’m considering quitting but also have the urge to take an axe to whoever made the bot that did this
---
Move them to the psplus storage on PS4 before you uninstall.
---
If you get the bass riff every time a message appears in the upper left, it’s something carried over from your last NW game. I just dashboard out of the game and reboot and it goes away. If you’re hearing it ALL THE TIME that’s a new one for me.
---
Yeah- I’m on board with your comment. I’m on my second character because I received a bunch of plans and stuff on my first that I hadn’t earned- it wasn’t fun. The last thing I had was someone randomly give me a bunch of the asylum uniforms in the rarest of colours...this stuff happened all the time. 
---
On my second character I’ve turned anything received around to my vendors, or give it to my husband (he’s around L160). 
---
There’s one thing I’ve kept for myself, and that’s all the large Christmas presents- they’re just fun. I know they’re still full of plans and the like, but most are duplicates of ones I already knew, so they’re up for sale (at a tiny fraction of value- I’m not out to take advantage of anyone). Ammo drops are appreciated, but I still go out of my way to craft all my own. 
---
Being given stuff that would otherwise come at the end of clearing particular quests ruins the game for me...takes the challenge out of it and gives no sense of accomplishment. Ew. Who would want that?!
---
For solar and thorn yes(it's scout armor). Strangler no because it's not legendary, it's power armor.
---
Well that explains why my laser rifle hreaks so easily! It's running me out of mats lol
---
I’m not sure if Xbox has it but on PlayStation you can start a group chat in the system or the app and chat via the app on your smartphone
---
I usually buy that combo item with tons of scrap inside with weight of 1 (don't remember the name), I know almost every recipe, so I haven't found anything useful for myself and even do not pay attention
---
Also once I've seen some legendaries there, but haven't bought them, it was kind of 1 star crap - but that was a while ago, like patch 18-19. After that - I haven't seen legendaries there
---
Doesn't work with walls though unfortunately:(
---
pretty legit with all boosts, actually i should do more but cant because of some threshold per location or something.
---
Trust me that shit wasn´t a stealth boy. He killed all of our team in seconds and the punches was like a machinegun.
---
Gotcha, thank you for clarifying
---
No, they said they'd *join someone elses team*.
---
thank you
---
Slightly better than some hacker killing sbq in 7 seconds.
---
Thanks for the offer but i just scrapped the damn thing. Didn’t even like it, but it was required for a tadpole challenge i think
---
I agree it’s frustrating. Happened to me once. Buy an external hard drive. $50 gets you 3+TB don’t need to worry about space so much.
---
The only way you could be done with the GB grind is if you cheated or if you didnt want anything but a few specific pieces.  I've gotten max GB every week since the system launched and I still have a metric crapton of stuff yet to buy.
---
Absolutely this. I get new players not understanding the dynamic but I consistently see lvl 200 plus in event teams (while not even doing events). 
---
You get a plus 8% xp gain from a fully bonded team. Not to mention the fact that that heard mentality adds another two and empath+strange in numbers is effectively better than line wanderer (thanks again to Angry Turtle for proving the math). I know mutations apply to all groups but simply making a case for public teams in general too. 
---
I am ALWAYS on a building team (to the point that I don’t even use my private server anymore). It’s just that good. Not to mention the fact that most people realize that if your in a building team it typically means “play in a group separately”. Most people don’t expect you to be social if your in that team and you can go about your business with great buffs.
---
Please guys join your local building team today!
---
I wish it would have been because that shit would have been reasonable. this motherfucker threw punches faster than the fucking flash.
---
Sweet thanks of letting us know
---
The first thing to do is to thank whatever Deity you acknowledge that these are the problems you need to deal with
---
I dont care for the big buns perk card, I much prefer to to do a agi based stealth build, then get the dummy thicc perk so the clap of my ass cheeks doesn't alert the guards.
---
You're a spooky Wasteland Ghost lol
---
yeah totally fair. I switched my main to bloodied during our last double xp event, and now I'm trying to power-level 2 other characters before hitting the main quests, so that I can experience the full story with a complete build :) I have way too much time though. especially during these times. only responsibility I got is my wee cat
---
A lot of players are fairly casual. In fact, I would venture to guess a majority are.
---
There is no timeline for when anyone should be done completing things in game. If you are that hardcore that you made it a point to grind and grind, great. Not everyone should be done collecting bullion.
---
it is a double xp weekend...
---
Then try get a full set of unyielding cavalier with ap on the secret service armor 😜 good luck m8
---
Other armor if you want to get them on your own is tougher but there you have the chance to trade them
---
Ha!
---
I'd rather just wait for the series x :/
---
I want to take an axe to Todd
---
Id love to take a room for tonight. Im on PC as well. If you don't want to tell your ign, mine is Laroon87 and Rendom87. Just add me on one of them, i sure come by =)
---

For your 'Well......Bye.' future endeavors.

\*Use Responsibly\*
---
Mate you may not get back into same server if you want to XP farm Whitesprings. Mattbullen182 brah listen I did this method every time I dropped a nuke on Whitesprings(3x a day) before Wastlanders and made it to like lvl 200. I’ve only been playing since February and I just hit lvl 420 today.
---
While I'm at camp, if I see a player under 20 (and some in the 25 range) enter my camp I've gotten into the habit of making a full set of level 15 raider power armour (25 raider and/or T-45 if they're at level 25 or close to it), cores,  stims and water for them which I put down in front of them them message them (XB1) and tell them all they need is a frame which most seem to have by that point. I've gotten a lot of heart emotes and thank you return messages. If my perk procs and I get more I'll just give it to them as well and tell them to break it down or sell it if they want.
---
I have so many of each mat now that it doesn't even make a dent in my stock, helps players out and is just nice to try and make these obvious Gamepass players feel welcome. 
---
I doubt I'll wear a clown costume though, it might send the wrong message and I put Beckett in that costume.
---
Would that solve the problem of the pictures not appearing in photo gallery ( loading screens ) After a reinstall?
---
I mean I still have the pictures it’s just It can’t be put back into loading screens.
---
He didn´t.
---
This isnt about the secret service armor anyway. Its about making everything else in the game a visble option, lol.
---
Damn....the best and worst the wasteland has to offer. Also, it's a good thing you did,  you're looking out for for the newbies. The lord work, indeed
---
AFAIK it only has 1TB of internal storage, so you’ll likely still run into the same issues.
---
Edit: quick research shows they use an expansion card type setup
---
I want the really nice ones from Whitesprings so bad. They sell plans for everything else in there. Why not the display cases?
---
I'm definitely blessed in my life. But it doesn't mean I don't have problems. I live in a 3rd world country in Africa, it has it's bad times.
---
It's probably mostly empty on the inside
---
How is launching nuke a grind though? Takes like 15 minutes if you skip some parts.
---
That's the thing, no one knows what people's motivations are. The guy in the OP's story might have thought that the OP was motioning him over to get the sword.
---
Secret Service is just worried about the gold your fine fam.
---
Gear is only going to further out scale what’s already in place welcome to an mmo no reason ss should take a back seat to anything
---
Sorry if you can't handle some sarcasm, I will try to just be factual.  
---
&gt; I don’t understand why they would put out a double xp weekend when other stuff is coming out.
---
1. Beth's responsibility is to make the gaming experience in **their** games the best they can, every day of the year.   Even on days when other games premiere, or new movies drop, or election days, or family reunions, or any multitude of other events.   It's up to the player to decide what do with their time, and it's Beth job to make sure if the player chooses one of their games, that the player gets the most out of their experience. 
---
2. GoT is only on PS4.  FO76 is on three different platforms.  Even if there was merit to the suggestion of BETH helping GoT (*which there absolutely is none*), that would punish 76ers on XB and PC who don't have access to GoT.  It would also punish PS4 players who have no interest in GoT.  
---
3.  You have to understand that on days you don't play a game, there is still stuff going on in that game for the players who do play it.
---
Yeah, this is what I try to do as well.  I just sneak around and only fight if it is part of a challenge or if it is unavoidable.
---
Some people probably get into the sneaking, but it makes for a pretty long and slow match if you are spending most of it hiding in bushes.  I'd probably enjoy the mode more if it didn't take so long and rewarded kills more.
---
Yeap I was doing dailies and play sunset overdrive (got a bit of xbox exclusive backlog....playstation only for many years)  but with team xp and other boost I cannt sit this weekend out.....draw up the grind map and have at it.
---
Lvl 45 should be fine? Lever actions max level is 45 if im not mistaken.
---
I could be wrong though and you need to be level 50 for them to be max level.
---
I’m gonna walk up to random people and say boo and disappear
---
It is impossible to knock down 13 x 4k mobs in the span of 1 minute.
---
I was with you on that at launch. Now, I don’t know the dozen things they’d break by adding it.
---
Sorry if this is a dumb question, but is it actually possible to get 4k per kill? I've been farming west Tek in a full building team and I'm getting between 300-700 XP per kill. My Intelligence is 10 if that makes a difference
---
I came across a player vendor the other day that was selling 77 at 1 cap each and another that had 10 for 2 caps, I was 87 tokens richer that day.
---
I will check when I get home, it’s been awhile since I’ve had to do it but I believe my photos went right back into the gallery.
---
Impressive production quality from a PSNer. Capture card and edited on PC?
---
Also, creative and hilarious. Even removing the trap element, it's an excellent build.
---
I hear them killing things all the time. What happens if you don't have any?
---
Same. I spent an amount of time I'm not willing to admit trying to place him on a toilet. I finally gave up and settled for a bench.
---
Edit to say I tried the porta potty too, but he kept going on top.
---
Did you watch how they played the rest of the match?  If every kill was in stealth then yes, report that fool.
---
Should be an option once you hit 100. I think it is all a simulation. Think about it. You can't go into it in adventure. When you load in you can't exit the front door. You die but you can go back to the vault and kill others you have killed before or be killed again. Zax wants data through testing but if you keep killing the test groups you have nothing left to test. It fits that everyone that is in NW is strapped into a VR chair like vault 112 and Evergreen Mills.
---
Ward. Ward never changes.
---
I can confirm that while it's not guaranteed 100% you won't get banned, I use all those same mods the other person mentioned plus [Ratmonkeys easy sorting and tagging](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/55) and [Glowing Meatpiles](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/144). 
---
The easy sorting and tagging makes inventory sorting so much better and really blends well with Bettery Inventory mod and Glowing meatpiles is an enormous help when I kill mobs. I went with bright purple as it blends with nothing in the game and sticks out like a sore thumb.
---
Overseer xp doesn't count towards it, but the Adv xp you earn from ot does count. You just ave to log into adv after nw
---
I've seen it happen a *lot* on Free Range but I think the root of it is two universal problems: how level scaling and enemy loading works (as far as I can tell). Caveat that things may have changed since I last tried to understand this game. The event takes place in The Forest which is the lowest level of the whole map meaning the sheepsquatch is gonna be the lowest scale possible. I know 'thesda was talking about universal scaling this year but I'm not sure that's out yet, so I think this still applies? idk.
---
Then, when monsters load in it seems to take them a second to get their full legendary stats or to mutate. So what happens is one level 150+ dude will take their VATS build into the event, lock on as soon as it's popping out of the ground, and blammo it's dead before it's had a chance to fully load. I don't really blame the people for doing what the game encourages them to do (get their hit immediately because no universal event loot). If you don't do extracurricular reading about it, you don't even know you're being an ass.
---
This quest in particular seems to be a constant [source of frustration](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bi7ior/stop_trying_to_kill_the_ing_sheepsquatch_before/).
---
My camp area is pretty flat (lead node east of generals steak house, south of AWOL event)
---
Because you can check game history on Xbox.
---
If he has barely any achievements, then he likely is not an alt. If his 'leave the vault' achievement was under a week ago, then he is unlikely to be an alt.

If it were me, I'd just be respectful, appeal, and write out what happened. I don't see how they can prove any wrong doing. Most of the people using the exploit just server hopped. But some players did this and they were legitimately trying to find the red dress, or to be placed in a world where there camp could spawn. All of those players got blamed and suspended and did nothing wrong. 
---
So I don't know, it'll be interesting to see what happens but there's so many players flagged it's going to be hard for them to prove who did what.
---
Quite frankly, Bethesda handled this horribly. They knew this came out on Wednesday/Thursday and they didn't do anything about it. They literally signed themselves up for more work now doing these investigations and appealed accounts. It just doesn't add up.
---
Maybe u switched from bethesda to steam?
---
I think they are all already with the right perks on them. The game anyway doesnt give anything competing you could use a stronger armor on imo 😅 in pve i can use wood armor to be op in anything
---
I miss the simple times. I love my family and wife, wouldn't trade them for anything. But... but those days of limited responsibilities were good. Enjoy them. I won't have that again untill my kids graduate and move on. I'll play games till the day I die!
---
building, but swap to events 10 seconds before public events end, and back to building
---
Also if you have a window with a bench/PA station nearby they can get in.
---
same here. Happens all the time for me. In total I think I've must of lost about 2.4k atoms over the half a year I've been playing. Not seen 1 of them returned to me, even after making support tickets every-time it happens.
---
Make sure you take maxed out hacker &amp; locksmith perks,  as you can bypass a load of stuff, and also you can deactivate all the turrets for the final section
---
Oh no rush, I appreciate you going to the trouble. It can wait til later. I'm playing around with ideas on the PTS at the moment.
---
I dont program but isnt having an overflow failsafe like day 1 shit?
---
gaining experience is one of the few things that is not broken and easy in this game. not sure why people feel compelled to gain levels faster.
---
The problem is, you often can’t tell a low lvl mule from a bona fide noob. 
---
No matter how well you try to protect your good intentions, crooks will find a way to get over on you.
---
watch this, everything explained. Not every npc for 4k but 2500xp per kill is also good :)   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfsEoh4UdGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfsEoh4UdGo)
---
because you could use them as instant barriers when we had survival servers. you could you them to trap players in places and box them in. as well as events use them to build instant monster flooding gates. so they decided you cant do it because people are dicks
---
It’s not his fault you cheated and duped knowing they have done big group bans in the past.
---
angryturtle (aka mr fallout 76 information) said once in a livestream, the ghouls die from the nuke and you have to wait for them to respawn, 10 minutes or better 15. he suggested to do a westtek oe boroughs run and then head to whitespring for the glowing glory.

Does it display properly?  I've had trouble with that on some junk items.  Find an item, think "Hey, this'll look neat in a display!"  Then I try it and find out it comes in backward, or buried halfway in the display.  I've had issues with vacuum tubes, SCORE lunchboxes, ignition cores from the Earth Mover quest @ Mt. Blair, the commendation medal from the Enclave questline and a few others.
---
Thank you, I'm a bit behind on the legendary run. This is gonna help a lot
---
How long does it take to build bonds?
---
6
---
My animal crossing. It just needs a better endgame gameplay loop, less currency caps, and less rng
---
It's nice to be nice
---
Hey there! Nuclear Winter XP does not count towards the SCORE challenge. We can look into rewording this challenge to make it more apparent.
---
He probably didn’t know what he had and scripped it.  /s
---
Thank you!! I just use PlayStations auto-capture in 5 minute clips and then edit on a computer :)
---
Yea I know that feeling when a low level monster kills you while you hack and slay like a crazy psycho on it and nothing happen haha
---
I don't have any and have had to repair like 1 light in the last 2 months
---
Well, you succeeded in getting me back into fallout, so there's that :)
---
I like that. Also would like an auto shut off feature when you hit max caps

---
the mole miner event by white springs. is guaranteed at least 2 legendaries every time the supervisor spawns. 3+ if you do it right. and its loaded with tons ot kill for scrap.
---
Mind if I ask, how come? Seems like something that would be good to do, considering there’s one for adventure mode, so why not one for Nuclear Winter?
---
Snowflakes hate the heat and the truth.
---
Have hazmat suits function like power armors where it auto equips what you had before you entered
---
People who don't discount plans disgust me.
---
i missed the beginning, started like 2 weeks before wastelanders and id give it a 9 at current state. 300 hours, lvl 160ish and still got so many things to do.
---
Wish I could display it meaningfully in a display case. When i placed it in mine, it firmly planted itself face down. Sigh
---
Edit: Spelling
---
This game has been out over 1 1/2 years, and with double and even triple xp 165 is not close to being high
---
Did i really cheat did I? That fact that you don’t realise the majority who got tagged were innocent goes to show your as I’m competent as Bethesda itself
---
Stagger incoming
---
i can confirm. i gave my friend a nuka quantum paddle ball and he got suspension for it.. im duping the stuff and nothing happened...
---
I was doing the ‘one violent night’ event the other day (on Xbox) ..now im lvl 120 but usually my gear is pretty low on damage as i only have a few legendaries that are average at best &amp; my perks aren’t all that great, however i have never felt such a level of guilt in my entire life when the final boss Wendigo came and i took it down pretty quick which meant some players couldn’t tag it in time.. in a fit of guilt i looted everything from the body, junk and all, and dropped it for them.. im sorry to that one player who gave me the dreaded thumbs down, it haunts my conscience everyday....I hope that one day my crimes can be forgiven
---
yes, and most robots
---
[edit: at whitespring]
---
sorry guys im lvl 80. one told me to go outside. But I can enjoy the outside of Appalachia.
---
I feel like I've gotten to enjoy the game more than most, and sadly it's not a by product of the actual game, but instead because of how I play compared to others. 
---
It's where 76 falls shortest in my opinion. As a camp builder, I've spent alot of time building and wandering looking for stuff to stick in my camp. Mix in questing, role playing and the occasional legendary/item grinding, I've logged a lot of hours, but never really got to the point that the currency grinds are all that's left. 
---
This is unfortunate. Bethesda needs to remedy this for the other types of players. 
---
Also, your point on events is spot on. Add a few, or even change and update the existing ones. Change some objectives. Throw in some new twists. Something.
---
Instanced. I does look like a mad dash to loot though so I can see why it looks like it may not be. Stealth commando is my favorite build overall but especially queen fights. My BFFR handmade hits for more than 700 per headshot when it’s night and I’m hopped up on chems. I do have a heavy gunner as well that does OK. I’d suggest a .50 cal. It’s my favorite heavy personally. The spin up barrel weapons make it tough to track her while moving. I feel like I waste so much ammo when I use them.
---
Thanks for the advice. You've just started my new mission. Hahaa. Finally some excitement and something to look forward to after getting my bloodied weapons. Looks like a Covid gaming weekend with some IPAs for me!
---
meh
---
About three fiddy (very common item)
---
Haven't had a turret in months. Virtually nothing gets damaged. And I get high level mutants, wolves, and radacorpions regularly around my camp.
---
shhhhhhh
---
Ah, I did not get that! I basically ignored all the news and documentation about public teams since I had no interest. I’ll definitely give them a second look. Thanks!
---
I hate it when I try to give new players something and they run away. The Clown Outfit is probably not a wise choice? lol
---
I love the high fire rate for the combats so the combat rifle and shotgun are my go to. Apparently it's that fixer thing I want 🤣
---
Everything is already viable. I do fine in a mixture of lv 40/50 t-60. Hell, if I’m not in power armor I can still get by using a mixture of mismatched armors that probably go back to lv 15
---
I haven't been able to do this event since patch 19
---
Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth
---
No unfortunately, it looks fantastic though
---
I think double XP is a possibility if you open a lunchbox, and it's currently double XP, so maybe you had 4x XP and the event completion leveled you up
---
The legendary run is not meant to be completed by every player. It mainly rewards their dedicated players while also giving casual players rewards.
---
If do not unban you up to 96h 4 days they will wipe your account
---
Uh, has the wall glitch that lets you have paper on both sides been fixed? Because on the PTS it isn't letting me place the door/wall and then swap the door to a full wall. Only gives me options for doorways in the replace menu. That would put a major damper on my plan.
---
Wow that makes sense thanks Bethesda but yeah that’s exactly what happened to me I got the paddle ball then got banned
---
95% = 95 not 100. people often think 95 = guaranteed hit. it doesn't. and even a hit doesn't guarantee critical damage hit. as for bows/crossbows. 95% is really 50% due to the bolt/arrow not moving as fast as a bullet and thus moving slower and the target moving after the release. which isn't taken into account when figuring the % of hit. for primitive ranged weapons its wiser to manually target and fire. you'll miss way less
---
We all know that innocent line is bullshit. And I laugh at the fact you screwed up typing your insult about being incompetent. Way to show yourself up!
---
Wow thanks for the fast response, I thought it looked cool and could be rare
---
xbox, ill buy them
---
How can i check this?
---
Win is win. Congrats!
---
Oh thanks for the fast response it’s a shame really
---
SSSHHHHHHHHHH!          your a DA
---
Very good to know. I need to look into them more now. Though listening to other people’s conversations is something I don’t want to hear either!
---
Thanks for the fast response I’m a bit gutted
---
Oh piss off no one wants you here and you have nothing constructive to say get lost
---
That’s called discrimination, and it’s typically illegal 😎
---
I knew what I was getting myself into thankfully. The completionist in me is still glad to have one.
---
SS is meant to be the current endgame armor to grind for?
---
Why boost other ones that are easier to obtain?
---
Thou at the same time I feel like set bonuses could be nice.
---
What’s broken with it? I used it last week...
---
I believe it's pronounced pic-i-nic. =)
---
Diminishing returns makes the increased resistances negligible *at best!*  
---
Even with a full set if SS armor with Rad Resist legendary rolls, you still can't walk into a nuke zone without spamming a RadAway every few seconds.
---
Just calm down, have a nice RadShield enema for the extra Rad Resist without suppressing those mutations, and enjoy the secondary mods that you can get that us filthy Secret Service wearers don't have access to anymore 🤷‍♂️
---
Yeah, none of those items work. The broken cameras sink in, too.
---
Wow...
---
Feel for you, have some friends in the same boat.
---
Surprising that people who have played this buggy mess are at all applauding these bans, based off code by the same people who made this buggy mess, and who have said time and again they don’t have the “tools” to help players deal with issues.  
---
You likely are in a pile of people who have triggered a ban somehow by having something the code says warrants a second look.  Now I have nothing against going after cheaters, but be quick about it, otherwise innocent people got banned due to buggy code and you’re wasting their time.  Wasting the time of paying customers... that’s just dumb.
---
Remember, this is the same group that couldn’t fix critter respawns until Fasnacht blew up in their faces, and it was because they were not testing it properly.  Imagine the kind of work that went into their anti-cheat code...
---
Thanks for the info
---
Some of us do not collect ore because we heal the scavengers.
---
Can you tell me your [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) username? Also u/fuze_is_not_OP
---
With what launcher did u start the game ? because steam and bethesda.net dont share atoms and f1st
---
🤫
---
Watched and Reported yes.
---
That’s what I don’t want! If I’m going to do it I want teammates as uninterested in actual teamwork as me!

 &gt; Can you tell me your [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) username? Also u/fuze_is_not_OP
---
Ha ha ha ha! The best! The truth is no one wants to hear you sob story about buying a paddle ball!
---
think the legendary perk will pretty much cover this, though, the ammo still weighs too much.
---
I just cleared my local saved data to increase performance and I lost all of mine.  It's dumb.  But it is what it is.  If I actually want to save any memories I just screenshot them using the xbox screenshot before I do anything like that.  It sucks but it is what it is.  I lost my whole first 6 months of the game the first time and Ill never get it back
---
Came across a magic combat shotgun as a drop. It is now my backup weapon when being a sniper won't work or isn't as fun.
---
It's only a level 40 troubleshooters, so it doesn't 1 shot everything. But it will stealth 1 shot a level 95 deathclaw, as well as non stealth all mutants and ghouls...with no shotgun perks...and that's good enough for me.
---
Edit: clarification.
---
Agreed. It would be cool though to have a chance at forging two cooperative states, then to later in the story have them fall apart and lead to the circumstances we see in the later games.
---
Go big.

thanks, that was driving my brother and I crazy

same here, double xp or giving it a try and join the clown posse in red dead online to have at least tried gettin my most beloved game out of misery.....
---
You realise you are 3 comments out of 37 on this post the world doesn’t circle around you plenty of others wanted to talk normally
---
have you broken down all your blue printed camps you have stored adn recycled all the items you have stored after doing so you will recover. a ton of camp space.
---
Yes I am, Have 4  kids :-)
---
You are right bc I meant to be referring to lewsofleads comment.  Oh well.
---
Is this on PC? Do you know if it will work on PS4?
---
Hi, I'm not a new player but I still have a lot of challenges uncompleted. Yesterday I did maybe 5 of Combat and 3 of Social and non of them rewarded me atoms. 
---
I think they might have broken the overall challenges by changing dailies and weeklies. But anyways if you get a response to your ticket, would you mind to share what did they tell you? Thanks in advance :)
---
Really though, creative and entertaining. If I died by this trap all I would be able to do is laugh. 
---
Nothing like building an enclosure of animals, only to find it was they who caged you!
---
I just want the purveyor to sell weapon types... example  3 star heavy,  3 star rifles , pistols and so on.  All I get are pipe pistols,  it’s ridiculous
---
I need to post video of it.  I might try reinstalling the game.  Thanks for the help everyone.
---
Currently Bloodied Bone Hammer. That's where I have most of my issues. I haven't noticed it on my Bloodied Switchblade, but I seldom use that.
---
Yeah. Super Mutants used to be people and went through a lot of suffering and experimentation to be what they are. I don't relish in killing them.
---
Your completely right but I don’t see why they even use a bot to tag people if they don’t check :(
---
The spawning of enemies in that location was player induced because of how bethesda programmed the enemies to spawn. You just need the fallout1st survival tent and to place it in a very specific spot close to the event.
---
The first rule of fight club...
---
I tried to make mine hold by vending machines, so I stored those, couldn't place the garage on my sloped terrain, then restored my vending machines and had to refill and reprice the damn things.  Very frustrating.  
---
(I pre-ordered, played for two months, then just recently came back, so I didn't know I couldn't store vending machine sales.  The more you know!)
---
Ohhh yeah! I recently unlocked the antler chandelier! That’ll be why! cheers
---
Its a mod for your chest armor.  So go to your work bench and modify your chest armor to see it.
---
Also did you buy skins from the atom shop or did you buy plans in game?
---
They don't care about you. Don't expect them to add accessibility options.
---
About 3 mins or so. Maybe 5?
---
That’s totally cool! When I started, I would attempt (unsuccessfully) whatever events I stumbled upon, but I didn’t actively start attending events until probably around level 40! There was just so much to explore before then.
---
If I get back in the game I have one I’ll give ya
---
I’m on Xbox so yeah I’m sure it will work if you use the normal shelf and the mat like I did 👍
---
I know mods exist, but many mods for fo4 that include things that the engine isn't built for (underbarrel attachments, alternate ammo types, etc) are fairly clunky and use weird workarounds. There's a bit of a difference between a modder making do with what they have and an officially released update, they probably wouldn't be able to get away with just modder quality
---
You PS4
---
Are you on PS4?  That's my experience exactly, but to add that Project Paradise and Scorched Earth sometimes work, sometimes don't.
---
Maybe I didnt see anything about it so ill have to try again. Thanks
---
No and don’t tell me how to play. If I want to farm XP goddammit I’m farming XP. You and your gameplay experience can go to hell for all I care **when you tell people how to play**.
---
Sorry Xbox
---
farming public event for junk legendaries. then converting those to script. then turning those into legendary modules or trading them for weapons. is something they should teach in the vault. i spend alot of time visiting camps and buying junk legendaries off people just for scrip farming.
---
For what do you want to craft the jetpack because only SS armor and the power armor (excluding excavator) have power armor and only on torso
---
I absolutely hate wendigos and totally did not need to know I have a wendigo colossi in my future.
---
These types of replies are so toxic. I genuinely feel the people saying this are horrible friends in real life. Your friend duped or made a mistake and you’re all about throwing them away?
---
You’re a jerk. You must be the most fun person to be around.
---
4k is for big stuff like glowing behemoths. The most I've managed is about 2.1k for super mutants.
---
If you've bought them from a player vendor, its probably for the Power Armors. You mod it into the Torso piece.
---
Shit thanks anyway :)
---
What is the max reward you get. I’ve only gotten level two before.
---
best response
---
I hate to think so; I think my sniper's only value here is to try to cripple her wings and force a landing, but it's hard to get a shot in when she flies overhead full speed.
---
dont catch me on numbers i ask something else. Westek, Burrows in few minutes  and event Line in the Sand. With almost every xp boost in game its like 5min = 1 level. 
---
ps: its possible its 20x 2500xp mutant or 30x 1700xp ghouls.
---
there is SO much lol. even now with the double xp i know i should be sitting around doing events but the missions on the top right keep piling up, i know how to toggle them, and i want to solve these damn mysteries
---
I agree, I find quite engaging to have more of those challenges per day actually.   
---
Also would not mind to see more tricky ones (like the "leveled  while..." vanilla challenge where you could trigger all steps in once etc...)
---
That world be cool indeed! Build up two bigger factions which then proceed to wipe each other out... Bringing even more chaos to the region :) And nature run its course after a global nuclear conflict and all the local nuking as well... And everything turns to cinder... And we get the future of Fallout 1. That world is around 100 years later vs Fallout 76. And it is a dead and very hostile place, very different from the Appalachia we see...
---
They're too busy making fake 4chan posts to monitor your search history, you're good bro
---
Me too, why do people do this?
---
150 caps for a mounted head plan that you have 13 of? Yeah I think I will pass thanks
---
I always collect ore and don’t mind doing it. as soon as one scavenger dies i stop. i don’t understand how 6 people in power armor and mini guns/50 cals can’t keep them alive.  yesterday i had a run where everyone stayed on one side, totally oblivious to the rear area.   shame because i think it’s a fun event. love doing project paradise but that rarely works out.  o well. rant over
---
If i get low level gear i directly go to a low level guy and drop to him, not waiting to scam their few caps
---
True.    
---
However, that fits into the apocalypse. People may work toward a shared goal but many will take any opportunity to gain something.
---
I bought the game on steam and i press play in my library
---
Ugh. My teammate and I were leveling up our alts and were doing uranium fever with a group of randoms. This level 290ish comes in, full power armor and a gatling somethingoranother and just starts physically putting his body in between other players and the mole miners. He one-shot (or close to it) all 3 of the Miner Supervisors just by physically blocking the way at spawn points. He did not defend the extractors or anything, just one-shot everything in sight.
---
Even 2k is a huge jump from the 500 I'm currently getting, I just need to get my hands on some egg head serums now
---
Because of score at the moment, and because of legendary perk slots
---
Thanks, saving to look over and as inspiration later. It's the sort of idea I'm going for, but perhaps a little more conventional looking.
---
I had that same issue (sort of) in One Violent Night. I’m level 102, and was there with a level 600+ player. He kept one shotting ALL the ghouls, and I didn’t get a damn thing. He went outside the hall and got the Wendigo too... I mean... at level 600+, why would you do that?
---
Magic?
---
I always open it back up so people can grab anything they dropped :)
---
Miss opportunity for a great content. 
---
First need to be a dialog option:
---
If intelligence is 15 or more
---
Give a stimpaks /water / buffout (random aid item) and the SM get well.
---
If luck is 15 or more
---
Give a random item, and SM get well.
---
Other options are
---
Atack .
---
Do nothing.
---
Now Beth need to track the outcome for the encounter (maybe 3 months? )and after that make a follow up history 
---
If the healing option be the most selected the SM will be encountered again and can live on your camp... like The actual companions 
---
If the atack option is the most selected,  create a random encounter at your camp to defend from a horde of SM.
---
Do nothing? Well the special encounter remains at is like today... no dialog no consequence no reward etc...
---
Did you use the bethesda.net launcher before?
---
HaHa, all good bud!
---
Yeah, I just double checked - I can do the first three. I remember buying the first 2 for casual and raider but don't recall what event dropped the protective linings for me. It was a bummer to get raider protective again though.
---
I don't know if they ever made it so furious damage numbers reflect the actual damage youre doing
---
not long, also switching the team status does not sever bonds.
---
Nope how can i use it?
---
I thought so too but apparently I'm in the minority on this one lol
---
I was happy with my 900 xp super mutants last night...
---
....only to wake up and see Angry Turtle pulling 2500 xp a pop! Living that good life
---
I’ve noticed that the more turrets you have, the more mobs are spawned. The mobs never really go away but I dropped my turrets down to one and suddenly the mobs became less frequent and the single turret could handle it.
---
Building only pays off for bloody builds with unyielding and high INT to begin with.  I'll stick with events teams and run events to get better payoff for my non meta build.  But yeah, I'll do building too if I'm just doing regular stuff as every little bit helps.
---
I've stopped bothering to mention it, last time bethesda addressed it was january 2019 claiming it was fixed. We all knew within 24 hours that it was NOT fixed, but they have been pretending it's gone since then. I've just accepted that some of my weapons are useless, but I'm still letting them collect dust in my stash for over a year just in the crazy hope that maybe one day they will actually fix this
---
Had the same problem, someone suggested this and it worked.
---
Launch nuke then walk across the nuke zone.  Fast Travel to Vault 76.  Log out and back in.  Fast Travel to the clubhouse. Ghouls should be respawned.
---
I've heard you can repeat this after clearing the area, but have yet to try it myself.
---
Nah the rep grind is acceptable enough, I’d rather just see a regular scrip machine at Crater and Foundation so I can get my daily gold and scrip in one run.
---
I did a bunch of challenges yesterday to get the lamp just for it to reset to 75 in the store.
---
A succesfulll vats "roll" on anything will make the chance to hit absolute, no wall and no movements can save your target from hit and arrows are no exception, and yep 95% =/= 100% but when it happen 10 time in a row it's not a probability issue, it's a bug.
---
as an ore runner i have no shame in killing the legendaries that spawn in the mines for myself haha
---
I don’t have turrets, almost lose nothing. When I had turrets I was attacked all the time. Now it’s just usually when I Ft to my camp that something spawns with me at my camp. Also for some reason the AI doesn’t like brambles so I surrounded my camp access locations with brambles and they don’t really go through unless im there and they’re agroed on me, but even then they don’t get through sometimes
---
I launched a nuke and there were 2 camps at the launch site. I felt bad for them although I did message them 3 mins prior to launching the nuke.
---
It depends how you set up your build.   
---
With AA Faster Swing speed I dont need 3 ranks each of incisor and whatever the other perk is.  Because as you said diminishing returns.   I just use one of each.
---
It's totally the tents, fences, perhaps even the bunker. I think the disagreement is because of this: she takes off instantly when she can't path to her locked on target after landing. She is always locked onto to someone, usually the person doing the most damage, and when that person is on a fence or tent when she lands, well she pops back up into the air because she can't get into melee attack range.
---
This is how it confuses people, because 10-20 people could be on fences or tents but not be doing that much damage so never get locked on, then she won't fly up and away. I know this from personal experience because whenever I do enough damage to get her fury, I make an effort to always stand out in the open in the fields, and I will never, ever see her fly up when I do this.
---
Its bethesdas launcher and if u didnt have it on there its a glitch but maybe u try and look if they are on there if not contacting the support is your last hope
---
They need to make power armor better at least.
---
beat me to it
---
oof.. then i got some bad news for you, &gt;!next update is gonna make the wendigo colossus more frequent as theyre gonna put it in an event!&lt;
---
You're still spare parts bud if you think you know anything bout a game without playing it. An no I need it in triplicate and in toddler terms. Get crackin.
---
The white shelf with a curved glass surface would do nicely as a display case. Personally, I'm using those in my diner already, and it would be nice to be able to put pies and cola in them.
---
Also, just a selection of cool, new display cases, preferably with different number of item slots - a couple choices to display 2 items, a couple more 4 item slot ones, a couple more 6 item slot ones and so on.
---
You’re so brave. Facing the negative karma like that. I mean, wow.
---
I'm actually not sure of the answer to that one!
---
Yeah I have a F mini and the numbers are the same but the hp bar drops faster after reaching half or so
---
They should put all the hackers in the same game, slowly forcing them into a death spiral of only beig able to lobby with other hackers. Make it account and IP bound. If they want to keep hacking then they will need a new address and account make it too tedious to be worthwhile.
---
I remember when I got my 1st jet pack plan all excited. I go to craft it and didn't have flux lol I was like what the hell is flux? I learned all about the flux's and how to get get them, that was a grind for the mats, learned how to craft it if I need it. Now I have a good stash of them. So OP make sure you have some violet flux handy :)
---
I get your point, but there will always been a ‘best mix’ for gear. Someone will math it out, and even if Set X has only a 0.1% advantage over Set Y, that’s what a lot of people will wear.
---
You should be good now. I’m about to hop on too so I’ll let you know just in case.
---
This company just never heard of the term QA.
---
In every other industry, they would have went bankrupt or gotten closed a long time ago.
---
I know you “read” the post, but did you really read it?

NAR Repair yard

1. Usually at least one legendary is spawned
---
2. Marine helmet plan rarely spawns
---
3. Bobblehead rarely spawns there
---
4. Some kind of "Storm" quest (don't remember exact name), where you have to kill tons of mobs = a lot of xp
---
5. Very often raiders and/or settlers spawns there = reputation farm (make sure you check every raider, very often there is a legendary one, usually with 3 stars)
---
6. Workbench is right there, you may kill everything and scrap it there = tons of new mods and steel (since a lot of weapon is dropped there)
---
7. Rarely scorchbeast can spawn nearby
---
Usually I'm just server hopping and farming there.
---
Magic Shotguns
---
Magic heavy guns that melt the queen, not so much.
---
They just need to make it so you can craft Legendary Armor of other types. Essentially, make it so each type, Leather, Combat, Robot, etc can have a Legendary Mod added to it at creation, much like SS Armor has it as a required component. If you know the Plans, you can make standard versions of varying levels, or select a Legendary Version (that's always lvl 50) that requires slightly more resources and a Legendary Mod. Then it's just like SS in that you will get a random 1-3 Star version.
---
Yes, this will bring the value of Legendary Armor down some, as Armorsmiths will be able to craft more and stock vendors with more, but considering that post lvl 50 crafted armor is worthless, it'd be a big step in the right direction, especially for those who enjoy crafting and merchant aspects of the game.
---
Bethesda should really address this by giving all participants of the event drops regardless of whether they tagged the enemy or not. The "camper" argument is just stupid at this point.
---
PA has so many hidden perks its fine.  But the carry weight in anything besides excavator sucks.   The mining should be its only bonus and all get +100 carry on top of shocks.
---
Guilty as charged. Admit I do it for the xp now as I have gotten all of the drops and have over 1000 notes. 
---
But as others said you only need 25 to succeed. Also, only need 75 ore in to get the best drops. So as others are XP grinding slap on a suit and get them!
---
That does happen when your in god mode, things arent aggressive towards you. But idk jump off of something high, respawn see if that works
---
I'm using egghead, herbivore and herd mentally for xp mutations. Class freak ( coz marsupial ), strange in numbers and inspirational for perks. Cranberry relish and brain bombs for food plus unyielding armor at low health. I've got a few characters to do this but intelligence is between 12 - 15 in special, 50 - 60 after buffs. To hit the 2k kills you also need a full lunchbox buff, without I get around 1k. I think that's everything. The video that's been linked I'm assuming is Angry Turtle so will do a better job of explaining than I.
---
Yeah, there's a YouTube video on them.
---
Basically certain effects cause each pellet in VATS to register full damage. So instead of 200 damage getting split into 8 pellets doing 25 damage, you get 1600 damage.
---
No Ik im not in god mode because I sometimes Take some random damage and also I actually just died a bit ago when the deathclaw Chris breezy me 😅
---
For the the future if you ever need a price check try the sub that rhymes with "barket days"
---
Laughs in bloodied explosive shotgun .. yeah it’s viable 2 shot a super mutant behemoth etc get a magic shotgun and a 15 % reduces damage while blocking piece of armor and one shot almost everything in vats.
---
How do you get the plan for that tall one??
---
I never used [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) launcher before i always launched it on steam
---
I think you're missing the head.
---
Oh ok will do
---
Thats because my tent is always there...... lol.
---
RIP vats
---
No, I was very intentionally comparing it to other reclaimed slurs that now make the opposite group uncomfortable.
---
So if I am in a random room of unfirmiliar straight people and I call myself Queer, there are usually a lot of uncomfortable faces.  In the same way, if I, when boarding a bus as a wheelchair user where everyone else has to wait and stare at you and it's awkward, turn to the line of all the rest of the folks who just want to get on the bus and say, "Sorry folks, looks like the cripple line is express today," every single person standing there cringes.  I have yet to see a single person, besides my brother, my sister, other young wheelchair users, or my partner, react any other way.
---
We are talking about a word where, if you look it up in almost any dictionary, will tell you it's offencive.  Any time someone goes to use it talking about a game in front of me quickly switches tracks and uses a different word.  And it is most definately a word that dehumanizes people.  A lot of people don't know this, but in the same era as Jim Crow, there were another set of equally repressive laws in the US called Ugly Laws, which litterally banned visibly disabled people from participating in public life.  They required disabled people or as the laws commonly said cripples, to effectively imprison themselves within their own homes and, if the were not capable of doing so they were institutionalized in asylums, like Alleghaney we see in the game where they were effectively imprisoned.  I don't make the comparison to the N-word lightly, and I don't say it is the same, but it has a similar history in the same time period of being used do dehumanize and subjugate people through systematic and violent means.
---
What I don't understand, every time this argument comes up, is why people are so resistant to change.  I am 100% okay with the fact that their are people in this sub who don't find it uncomfortable.  But when we are talking about a video game and even specifically talking about how it needs to be more accessible, the language we use is part of that.  In real life I am a sociolinguist who teaches doctors how they can make their practices more accessible through the use of language.  It does effect people and little changes go a long way.  And changing it doesn't hurt anyone.  It's like, if I invited you to my bachelorette party and we had planned to go get pizza, if you told me you were lactose intollerant, without you even asking, I would say screw it, lets go get Thai food.  The point still gets across, we eat, everyone has a good time, no one would even remember we were gonna originally get pizza in the first place.  Sure, if they changed the language, maybe only a few thousand players are uncomfortable (though I will note that disabled people make up around one fifth of the population and make up a larger portion of gamers because, hey, you know what you can do if you are too sick to leave bed?) but no one would leave the system.  No one would think that them changing an incidental word in the UI from crippled to injured in update 22 would be some horrifying and agregous violation of their sensibilities.  Juicehead would just have a one liner that update 22 also changes the UI dialogue for that one word and though, he didn't know it was something people were asking for, but that's alright I guess, and that would be it.  So yes, it might only benefit a small number of people, but why are people so virulently opposed to it on those grounds.  Like if werewolves were real, and I was writing a book about them and released a sample of it and a werewolf messaged me and said they found the use of the word Rougaru offensive, I would simply write back, "thank you for telling me, what about lycanthrope?"
---
So I guess my ultimate question here is, to the people who are obviously offended by my suggesting a different word be used, why are you offended?  And please don't say censorship because really, please read a book, that is bot what censorship is, but real reasons.  Why are you offended by someone being offended by something?  
---
I'm not saying boycott fallout, I'm saying, fallout is my favourite game series and I have stuck by and defended a game many have deemed dead and here is one tiny thing it could do better to be fun for everyone.  I live in a world where my body and my relationships offend people and I have to keep on going past that.  People are where they're at and I acknowledge that, so I'm not offended by their offense, I think, best try again later and move on.  Making our games more accessible to a larger variety of people only benefits our community, it doesn't harm us.  Since gamergate, when you suggest something to make members of an oppressed group feel more comfortable playing a game people freak out in a paranoid manner.  It reminds me of when Cyberpunk 2077 decided  to let you customize your body shape, genitals, and voice actor separately, people who took it as an example of trans humanism loved it and people who interpereted it as a way to make trans people feel more comfortable (which I don't get, because if your whole thing is that you hate having a d*** in real life, why would you want one in a video game? Most people I have seen wanting to use the feature are men who like to play women in games but still want relatable sex scenes and that's fine with me too.) totally lost their shit like this was the most horrifying thing they ever heard of and how dare the trans lobby do this.  Like even if it was done for trans people, who cares?
---
I get that people are calling me a snowflake, but they're the ones getting upset because a girl in a wheelchair suggested her favourite videogame could use a word that wasn't a slur to describe temorary injury.  *shrug*
---
Distant thunder is pretty quick easy xp. Don't bother with the scope thing, just go on a murder rampage. It's quite cathartic.
---
The best way to do that is to start your own team and then let other players hop in and out at their leisure. If they try to bother you then you can kick them from the team.
---
100%
---
Some people (including myself) find that character progression is the story to the game. And thus the game never ends.
---
I agree but targeting rank would be easier for Bethesda which probably wouldn't listen to this anyway and it help would a tiny bit
---
I powered up poisidon once. I did it to get power to a workshop I took. I forget but there is one where you can power it up. I did it because it was before I unlocked fusion generators. Would have been level 40 or 50 at the time. Powering it up took me like 45 mins to work out what to do and complete it. Wouldn't recommend. Would be quicker now I know how but it is frustrating.
---
I like the enclave events except the supply drop. Bots on parade is also too easy. I think it's bugged. Spawns one mob every 30 seconds and often it's friendly.
---
I’m probably not doing main quest until level 50, I want early game to last a while and not reach end game too quickly since it will probably be a tad boring.
---
1. Where do you get plans for advanced power connectors?
---
2. Where do you get plan for keypad door?
---
Tbh I can’t remember. It might of been a reward from claiming workshops.
---
Its not that, before the gam was released on steam you had to use Bethesda's launcher. Bethesda then gave free access to the steam version. Everything got carried over apart from Atom balance, shockingly (/s)
---
In game
---
Mmmmm....  relository...
---
Yes this would actually be better than snap-to. Good point.
---
Epstein... Is... Is that you?
---
Some mods work, if they are updated to the current patch, but if not, yes, the game will kick you.
---
Second this - also a great opportunity for PA plan drops.
---
That being the same, if he is this far behind and continues on his current trajectory, completing wont be possible. Double score and extra XP doesnt do much if you dont play that much. It might move him along a little further, but with how far behind he is currently, it isnt likely enough to catch up.
---
Luckily there’s an addon that hides the super shitty looking jetpack on the nexus
---
Yeah mole minor is good but not everybody shares the legendary I usually hit it once and call everyone over but you have the selfish people who one shot it
---
I find it hilarious when I try to drop stuff for new players and I do the gift emote and then drop some goods and they are running away! It’s like herding kittens having to either run and summon them back or pick it back up and chase them down!
---
Are you on Xbox? Same thing happened to me last night lol did 7 level ups in a couple of hours.
---
Some 215ish guy yesterday was one-shotting pretty much everything in every event. Mia in Campfire Tales. The supervisors in Uranium Fever. Scorchbeast in Surface to Air. I kept thumbs downing and angry facing him. He would then spam the thumbs up. What a prick.
---
&gt;sometimes more than you shoot      
---
    
---
That's kooky.
---
Lol I get it!! I remember being new haha. No need to rush and do the events. No need to rush to level up either — trust me it’s really nice to be at a level where you’re not melted by everything, but it’s better to take things slowly. I do a lot of events because at this point I’ve done a lot of the side quests and the story!
---
Delete this
---
Leaving console players out in the cold...I see.
---
Since it only takes me a few shots to kill a sheepsquatch I just drain its HP to like... 15-30% maybe half and let everyone do the rest.
---
I think its called Irrational fear. About the robot who is afraid of bees. Its quick gives great exp but his voice repeating over and over and over again is annoying.
---
I’m using a bloodied pump shotgun. Because I got annoyed at the slow bloodied double barrel. And with the shotgun perks required. I mostly kill everything in 1-2 shots. Regardless of me being 5 feet or 15 feet away. 
---
I decided to switch a few points around. And I have 6 agility. 3 points for sneak. 3 points for covert operator. And I one shot almost everything now with my silenced pump shotgun. 
---
I decided to give my unarmed bloodied build a break so I can admit it’s fun to run around and just shoot things. And ammo is really easy to make and obtain. 
---
Whenever I’m fighting the queen, I just swap out my perks and go unarmed again. That’s the beauty of having shotgun and melee perks u see the same skill tree, and fully maxed out.
---
I'd go Endurance and replace fireproof with iron clad
---
do they have deep pocketed limbs for the SS yet?
---
I've done that too, if you can CLEARLY see the others are not participating, screw it I will kill them then. I hate the people who camp out at events, or have their "special" way of completing events that a total stranger would have no way of knowing. (Like the people who apparently don't like the jukebox on during One Violent Night, etc.)
---
I’m not sure if your stash budget eats the build budget. But displayed items and items in freezers use the build budget also.
---
Not super hard, programming wise, but might cause trouble with other systems because of Bethesda's infamous spaghetti code. It would boil down to the equivalent of an IF-THEN statement. Problem is, nothing stopping someone from rolling up on an Alt to rob it blind anyhow. Can't lock out assholes, unfortunately.
---
True, but that would take more effort. Eventually you can make it more effort than it's worth.
---
Manhunt is quick and can give you as much xp as scorched earth and also riding shotgun is longer but very good xp.
---
Why? I heard that DR gives diminishing returns.
---
Yeah I don't really get some people. I only need legendaries for the challenges but otherwise I just let other people do their thing. And then there are people with a high level sending angry emotes because they missed the legendary, as if your stashbox isn't already full with legendary weapons
---
With the Gauss rifle, at 95%, I can miss 5 times in a row. The only way to correct this is to leave VATS then enter VATS again, but it reoccurs more often than not. I'm pretty sure this is a bug and not bad luck every time I use the weapon. This issue does not happen with the hunting rifle or railway rifle.
---
*Great win in my books.* That's called maximizing your equipment and utilizing great tactics. I have a similar story...
---
This morning I played a NW match and won by only firing a few rounds. The rest of my team members were under the impression that it was TDM and were all dead by the time there was 20 competitors left.
---
When the game had around a dozen players still alive, a nuke was launched which left just me and the one who fired the near winning shot. I popped a rad-x, made my way into the nuke zone/small circle, and patiently observed my opponent engage a landed scorchbeast.
---
I saw him duck behind a tree during the fight and needless to say I took my opportunity and killed him fairly easily in route to victory!
---
\*Spits out doughnut\* My god... He's playing that fucking game again.
---
Charisma for Traveling Agent. Got to love a discount.
---
With how Dr works in this game that's not a good idea. That extra 50ndr is not worth the perk points. Though he should replace fire proof with adamantium Skelton and use dense on a chest piece
---
agree magic shot guns rock
---
5 out of 10, and this comes from someone with over 4000 hours in this game since beta. If there is one thing I would change, it would be the ability to craft legendary items. Not just certain weapons or armor, but ANY weapon or armor plan you learn. Select your perks. Tie it to legendary perks. Make the items expensive to craft. Whatever. Just let us craft our own. That would permanently end the duping and real money sales problems.
---
Take it to the next level, find yourself a copy of Backwoodman 3, I have 4 currently stockpiled. It will cut the cost of crafting weapons.
---
I feel like the server can't handle the amount of people in one area. It definitely seemed like it was struggling. lol
---
HARD agree. We already have "event campers"- people who stay in spawn points to kill legendaries but otherwise don't participate in the event. If everyone gets the loot for the event, the campers win but more importantly, the people doing the majority of the effort win.
---
Exactly my poiny
---
Those were not duped haha
---
yeah gonna need that goth white skinned nuka dark girl like NOW!
---
Cant do that because of chinese stealth armor
---
so your saying the number is meaningless wheather its 1 or 95 its absolutely going to hit? and your logic of a wall, not affecting the result is wrong. if you fire a gun the result is instant as the bullets travel extremely fast vs an arrow which you can watch travel if you equip the exploding tips. you can watch the arrows try and curve around things and deflect. the % is updating as you track the target. easilly viewable as you do so. and here is the important difference. once a firearm is fired the bullet is almost instant to hitting the target. but other weapons are not the target may still move resulting in that number still changing. you can also view this with granade launchers. i use bow and arrows alot to save ammo and see this happen a ton. the moment of release those number can change and the resulting 95 in a split second can become a 0. 
---
now how the system calculates the % i have no idea but nothing is a garenteed hit with vats.
---
I've heard that, but I thought that was for super high DR, In the several hundreds? Not sure.
---
Is 76 cross play now?
---
No. I skim through reddit posts. The talk of the town is SCORE. Instead of NW, just say Nuclear Winter. This isn't 1985. You're not being charged by the letter for putting an ad in the classified section of a newspaper. I was being a lazy reader and you were being a lazy writer.
---
Man I have so much water that I’ve been dropping bags of it whenever I’m at my base for any passers by that may need some.  Once I get further in I’m going to have so much stuff available as I’m a crafter type person so my goal is always to be more than self sufficient.  Can’t wait 😂
---
Sorry did not see the stealth armor bit
---
Yea then I doubt it was you because the guy that nuked me was jumping around my camp wreck spamming the thumbs up emote, being super proud of what he did.
---
Shout out to a fellow Slocum's/Beckett's franchisee!! Glad to see more folk in Appalachia helping new players as well. Set myself up near The Wayward &amp; sell tons of cranberry cobbler.
---
I suspect that it is specific to certain weapons. Think I've ever missed with a melee weapon at 95%, but I have most recently used a cultist blade and shovel.
---
6.
---
Needs more endgame content as people have said, a way to replay Main Quests (Seriously, they are the best ones and you can only do them once for each character) would be a help there as well, more Factions, Raids,  just more to do than the same few Events over and over.
---
Bugs and Balancing... Doubt I need to elaborate here, heheh. Balancing is a biggie for me though, as I don't want to run as Bloodied or Junkie, which are by far the most powerful builds in the game. The SBQ should not be soloable in 3 seconds, sorry not sorry.
---
I've got a Anti Armor Limb Damage Shotgun and using VATS can one-shot just about any enemy in the game without any shotgun perks equipped
---
Ok, what’s your GT? I’ll be on within the next couple hours, I’ll shoot you a message
---
I typically use a brick wall.  Strategic placement can make the brick side look natural, like its part of a fireplace, or facing in where stairs lead up or inside the kitchen with the stove in front.
---
I used to do the two wall trick, but freed up a lot of budget.
---
Some level 5 guy claimed a workshop and there was a defend event on it. I went to help and he spent the whole event swinging a knife at me while I was doing all the work lol
---
If anything give them camp crafting materials, otherwise you'll just break the progression curve as they plow through the main story.
---
My heavy guy has a couple different good non-meta weapons.
---
Anti-armor FFR Faster reload Minigun is a lot of fun.
---
Prime Zealots FFR Mingun for the queen
---
Vampire FFR LMG for general murder
---
and I agree with a lot of the guys below on the Final Word.
---
Note\*\* I guess I prefer FFR to EXP when it comes to heavy builds however I also have a Vampire Exp LMG that is fun to play with.
---
No one would dupe those crappy weapons
---
Hahaha bastards still exist in game eh?
---
Sometimes, but rarely, you will get that message. It is just a bug of sorts. Relog and your mods will work. I just logged off and my mods work just fine. I had that happen to me 2 or 3 times since launch of the game.
---
Don’t use turrets and display cases they take up a huge amount of space
---
If only I could get her in my camp. The quest to recruit her is bugged in my game and support doesn’t seem to be in any hurry to help me fix it.
---
Imagine fitting individual pellets that are 2 mm in diameter into a drum of 500 rounds manually in less than 3 seconds. Makes no sense!  
---
The idea of this post is that we should have a standalone alternative, such as a 2mm drum or mag.
---
plasma goo piles seem to offer less loot
---
M0oserider
---
It's an honest question, no need to make fun of them.
---
No problem. During leveling, even when fighing packs of ghouls, I had limbs broken only a couple of times, so I dont know if that perk would be useful, plus you can just use stim.
---
Yest was ridiculous. I worked 10 hrs come home join my INT group and went from 44 to 53 in 2 1/2 hours yest.  10 nukes diff servers, encryptid an Project Paradise actually had 10+ ppl...finally did it with all lvl 3s surviving...
---
Hoping tonights the same after work.
---
Lol that mad dash is so the body doesn’t move/disappear and you get the legendary quick. Maybe doesn’t happen as much with the queen but I’m constantly doing that with regular legendaries because sometimes now they disappear after I kill them.
---
Oh yeah, because placing the vendors down again after scrapping and spending more time loading every individual item back in one by one.... Is better advice?
---
Again, it's not just about stopping people from buying, but also to take yourself off the map temporarily. There are other reasons too where scrapping the machines is a more annoying and time consuming process than switching them off.
---
I dunno, but I mess with everything I can at a camp when I see it.
---
Justice for the people!
---
Though I have to ask, why not run a set of uny? It looks like you're running bloodied anyway. And you'll be just as stealthy, if not more so
---
To answer your question, yes. The team leader can change from building to events at any time and the bonds will stay in place. We do this for Scorched Earth. Building for all the extra XP from ads and when the SBQ is close to dead, swap to Events for the completion of Scorched Earth. Then back to Building for the rest of ads, etc.
---
Then play as a raider, loot everything, don’t be a dick and steal loot from people and if you’re as selfish as that then atleast kill the people after
---
Welcome to the internet I guess?
---
You only need to log out for 5 minutes for the Private World to reset, FYI.
---
Oh
---
I might be wrong, but if I recall correctly, the keypad pylon is broken and anyone can turn it on/off
---
If a level 250 buys stim packs I'd guess something bad happened to them and they need it lol. Most high levels have so many stim packs they give them away and sell to vendors due to weight. I have had stim packs for sale in my camp just to highlight it but being on the far right of the map no one has ever bought one.
---
My vampire shotgun kills everything and gives me life.
---
Ouch
---
This is what my team does. We run a building team, and then before we complete an event, team leader swaps to events, complete the event, and swap back to building. Sometimes we might not have time to make the swap, but the INT bonus is still better than no bonus at all.
---
I just realized this off your post, so TY
---
I wouldn't put a tip jar out if it were an option. I have a hard enough time getting rid of caps so I can continue selling stuff. I enjoy the vending process, having people visit my camp, and giving them good deals. The downside is, I'm always so close to max caps and struggle to find anything worth buying, especially now that servers are flooded with new players selling their level 5 pipe pistols and similar shit. I have about 600 lbs of 3* guns and armor waiting for the scrip machine. #appalachiaproblems
---
Duped on day 3 maybe
---
Guass rifles broke AF right now anyway
---
I mean we can all have opinions. “Endgame” content usually isn’t over and done with in 30 seconds to two minutes, though.
---
Exactly! Oh and the panic when the timer is ticking down and you're RIGHT there to deposit but you run out of AP and are struggling to make it lol
---
Thanks for the test results. No really good stuff like Berry Mentats. I bet that's a rare drop like ultracite scrap is for the regular Collectron.
---
This or Strange in Numbers if you want help out your team.
---
There were ZERO nukes on my server :(
---
I got most of mine from Whitesprings, West Tek, story progression, and lots of XP stackables.
---
any extra points you don't have an immediate use for I would save for down the road in case you decide to change something about your build. They're always good to have in reserve.
---
I dont have the pieces yet.
---
It was buggy as hell for me earlier too FPS was like 3 or summit mad dog didn't spawn in at all in man hunt think severs need a cool.down or the new code is fucked up
---
did you try going right where she is? instead of fallowing the quest steps?
---
Sounds like the kind of stuff only the purveyor would dupe. You're safe dude
---
Big Al's Tattoo Parlor.  Love the flavor of a speak easy under a tattoo parlor and Biv is ALWAYS happy to see me.
---
it's hard to tell. most remotely good rolls are duped. the other two jokers might say those are crappy rolls, but back in the day people duped 2\* TSE pipe weaponry. which is hard to imagine nowadays.
---
it hardly matters, though. unless you duped them yourself or have more than 2 (?) of each, Bethesda won't touch your account.
---
 |I heard that x01 armour is good for fighting scorchbeasts. Why is that? 
---
Unless the specs have changed, Max Level:
---
Excavator: 300 DR, 300 ER, 426 RR
---
Raider: 401 across the board
---
T45: 420 across the board
---
T51 has 514DR, 514 ER,  370 RR
---
T60: 460 DR, 430 RR, 475 RR
---
Ultracite has 513 DR, 453 ER, 453 RR
---
X01 has 458 DR, 513 ER, 513 RR.
---
 I don't have T65 (yet), so I'm not familiar with its specs. 
---
You can see from the numbers there are tradeoffs for each armor type.
---
X01s high rad resistance is  beneficial if you are fighting in a nuke zone, and often queen fights are, or you are next to a fissure, which is also emitting radiation.
---
But T51, T60, and Ultracite have higher DR, which is beneficial when the SBs minions come after you.
---
You can use the Fireproof perk for protection against the SB sonic attacks.
---
I would not poo-poo Excavator - its numbers may be low, but with an extra 200# carry weight.... it's my goto, and I've survived more than one queen fight in excavator.
---
But PA is not mandatory for fighting an SB.  In some scenarios, I don't.  Additionally, I have the fireproof perk, and I generally use vampire weapons.
---
i fell your pain on the missing it happens to me alot with primitive ranged weapons. to the point i avoid vats  from personal testing the % still changes after the weapon is fired   until the round hits the target. in most cases, this is instant. but in others such as primitive weapons or grenade launcher, the round moses so slow you can physically see it flying through the air. and can lead to the % dropping and the round missing.... in your case i do not know the cause or if its just extremely bad luck or a bug. but for me its enough i avoid vats with slower moving round weapons
---
I crashed out, came back, and it was going.
---
Yea i know it is shorter than 20mins (heard before about 5mins, but never tested it) but i like to do stuff between farm sessions so i won't burn myself out. I should have been clearer.
---
I make my switches 100% inaccesible (even by myself) by glitching furniture over it and stuff like that. Then I control the switches from the terminal, which is locked and in my locked office. Sure someone could hack it, but he’d get wanted status.
---
Yeah, if they 'fix' it a lot of people will have to resort to that, but seems to be working normal on the live servers. I hope it's just a quirk of the PTS and not that they are stopping the two wall trick from working.
---
Hahaha yeah he had to DM me and meet me in my camp. He went way out of his way to help me. Another guy DM'd me and said "Stay where you are, I have something for you." I did, but I've spent enough time in spawn and die games that I was like, "He's coming to kill me."
---
nor should you haha
---
Do you have an xbox account I could send you a video on? I'm having difficulty getting it to post here on reddit, probably something with my xbox settings. I made a video of it before I moved my camp a week or two ago.
---
I haven't been getting fusion cores out of them at all for a while.
---
RMB? sorry is that a Nexus mod or something.
---
[Dmg res diminishing returns explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gikcx1/damage_resistance_and_diminishing_returns/), read first comment in the thread
---
Why are people still killing others in nuclear winter? Can't we all just get along. Hangout until the circle closes in and all get some good xp....
---
The trick is to open 3, then when there's 30 mins left open one more. When the first 3 run out, open 3 more... Just don't open 4 at once. I've had no issues with this method.
---
How much are you getting? The minimum should be around 500xp for the level 60+ bots, not including double XP of course
---
With they double XP weekend alot of people can catch up with grinding events on teams. I'm sure they'll have a 2nd double XP weekend before its over too
---
Have they patched her? For a while now she hasn't been able to be crippled.
---
yes. if you log out the timer stops while logged out.
---
Even then. If it wasn’t just legendary items, it would lead to a lot of unwanted crap, like missile just appearing in your inventory from mole miners, or scrap you don’t need.
---
Take my banned account, flip it and reverse it
---

---
i wanted to say once you shoot if the vats worked no matter what's beetween you and your target it's going to hit walls included, it's the same rule for all weapons
---
personally, i like to turn my camp items inside out.
---
The answer is technical data.
---
OK, I'll take your advice, I really like those creatures, excellent design and useful loot.
---
Yes. I log off every 30mins or so to let my private server reset and the buffs stay.
---
I'm totally going to start paying it forward. I like the idea of playing some rounds just searching for noobs to help.
---
Lmao you got it
---
You should find the reflex sight pretty fast; railway rifles have high chances for learning mods. Track what you know and what you don't at [this most awesome spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=2043760311).
---
I installed [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) game launcher, i logged into the bethesda account on it and i don't have fallout 76 on there (i used the same account that is logged on my steam fallout 76)
---
Turning into Slenderman when you got out of your power armor!
---
The problem is that she won’t advance the quest. I had to get the flight recorder, and I did (in fact, it says “flight recorder added” each time I log in), and she just repeats the same line of dialogue when I bring it back to her, instead of taking the quest to the next step.
---
Personally, I'm thinking a goth and maybe like a burlesque dancer? Black feather fans, high heels, some fancy lace things and stockings. really lean into the "adult beverage" angle. Advertisements seen in bars or maybe in garages, in game. White, ribbon lettering below the picture saying 'The most refreshing way to unwind'.
---
At least, that's what popped into my head.
---
Can confirm this sounds about right.
---
That would be pretty bad.
---
Brotherhood Fans were farming TD for MONTHS.
---
By now Im pretty sure we dont need more TD.
---
This is crazy.. OMG
---
Thx for the heads up. But for me, you’re coming a couple days too late. 
---
Let’s just hope they fix it.
---
I have the same issue. I play with my mule account on steam only and transfered when I had 80-180 aroms in [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net). Since the last hotfix, something borked my challenges, because on completion I am awarded atoms, but when I get to the store, they are reset. However they are transfered to Bethesda.net . But if I buy stuff on that launcher, I cannot use it on steam ...
---
Im just wondering about it cuz i got them for so cheap and i got them in like 2 days
---
you're in the big leagues now ;-)
---
such a less difficult game, no?
---
Yes, why balance a broken mechanic when we can just slaughter all of the new players without any effort. Ruining the game for everyone else is so fun.
---
Lol! I have the benefit of starting on launch day when nobody had stockpiles and we were all just running around in party hats wondering what TF to do and how to get materials. I can’t imagine popping out of the vault to a bunch of level 300+ people in their crazy power armor skins. I would probably run away too lol
---
Just the flux.  Everything else doesn't spoil.  Best bet is to stash a decent amount before you try crafting any.  Some of the materials (generally the fluids) drop less often than others.  
---
Also make sure you use the perk super duper anytime you make some for a chance to end up with 2 for the price of one.
---
Guided meditation. Especially if there’s a group there.
---
It’s ghoul central.
---
Lunchboxes stack up to 100%? I thought it was only a flat 25%.
---
Imagine caring about getting banned. Imagine thinking people would dupe those weapons. Imagine you can hardly spell.
---
Not just USA.  Other countries collaborate with them.
---
I'm so glad you posted this. I thought I was losing it. My husband never hears it when he plays, and looked at me all crazy when I mentioned it to him. It started fairly recently and I've had it ever since. I didn't know if it was a new "feature" with a patch, or just wth was going on!
---
Don't feel bad.  At 214, I still haven;t powered up a plant, either.   I did, however, do death blossoms (again) last night.
---
One of the Daily challenges was complete an event in a group, I spawned it at Morgantown train station, joined a random group, then death blossoms popped.  
---
Quick and easy 250 score points.  Took a picture while I was at it.  Another 250 score.
---
/me loves angler horde in the mire on my private server. Can farm it for hours and hours as long as I don’t kill the boss
---
I hate it when it gets to 5 minutes and no one has done an ore run but everything is still alive ..
---
At that point I’ll run all 4 tunnels usually come back to a failed event and everyone dead :(
---
That's a good point, and pretty reassuring.  
---
I just can't help but feel that we need a clear statement on what will get you banned, you know? I don't want to do anything that could get me banned 🤷‍♂️ Imagine a world where the laws weren't made clear, and you had to kinda guess your way around 😅
---
I do believe I had bad luck - but If you need chems on a daily basis I dont think it hurts to let him collect some.
---
If its ammo you need I would go for ammo and guns but for a Junkie Build you get ammo from the ammo generator and chems n Alc from the Collectron.
---
I mean just going and drink some old possum or rum for the strenght buff alone aint too bad, considering I dont have to actually find and keep it, I can just stop by my camp and pick some for the road.
---
I usually do the friendly option for random encounters and then kill them anyway for whatever they holding.
---
If you're talking about jet packs for power armor, go to a PA station and mod the torso piece, the jetpack will replace whatever existing mod you have on your PA.
---
If you're talking about jet packs for the Secret Service Armor, go to a normal Armor Bench and mod the Torso piece for the Secret Service.
---
You're going to need Violet and Cobalt Flux, I think it's 5 of each that you need for all of the jet packs, Power Armor and Secret Service.
---
It all definitely works on PS4
---
I don't think they are. but like I said, it's hard to tell for sure.
---
you really shouldn't worry, though. eventually you *will* acquire duped gear, unless you never trade or buy stuff off other players.
---
It’s not autocorrect you just don’t know how to spell.
---
Make sure you have a mic, and get out and make friends. Long after I have pretty much done everything, my crew has kept me playing. After the content is worn through, your fellow players will provide entertainment.
---
The SBQ gives me one star armor, pipe pistols and a furious rolling pin.
---
You know what. You've convinced me. I wasn't seeing how it could negatively impact someone. I think changing it would be a good idea. I'll try to stop using the term in my conversations as well.
---
Honestly why play it when there are other battle royale games that are actually updated. Seems strange to me that any one likes NW
---
Are you speaking from experience?
---
Maybe they're not interested in the event you're doing and are doing other events.  But yeah if it's not that then why be on an events team?
---
Sry english is not my first language and im just generly terrible in spelling
---
25% per lunchbox, up to 100% with 4 of them.
---
They really are super helpful, plus, muting people is pretty easy. Just open the social menu, click on the blabbermouth's name, and you'll see the mute option in the drop down menu.
---
It depends on the event, I find SBQ better with the building team because I get more xp per kill which adds up rather than just getting boosted completion xp
---
Yes, I deal with people like you daily.
---
Never occurred to me to pronounce that "Yogi". I always end up with something that rhymes with cow pie.
---
Well played, Bethesda, you got me.
---
I can only imagine what things looked like when this game first came out. All those keywords popped big time!
---
Also if you do gather it, the glowing mass and fluids will be under aid and the hardened mass will be under junk.  It won't auto scrap thankfully.
---
You are right about that, but it hasn’t happened to me with the queen yet. Yesterday I FT to Colonel Kelly monument to snap a pic for my daily and drop into a pack of about 15 glowing radstags. No lie, 4 or 5 legendary. By the time I got them all the bodies started disappearing and I’m fairly sure I walked away empty handed.
---
Rofl - entitled.
---
Private server. Problem solved.
---
try to go to your pipboy quest screen and refuse the quest and start again, it fixed the ra-ra one for me  perhaps it fix for you too
---
Exactly, especially playing with a team of randoms.  An actual team playing together usually dominates the game because there's usually only 1 or 2 of those per round, everyone else is essentially playing solo.
---
I use the chat mod and perk loadouts and only have to turn them off for NW mode.
---
Turrets and crops cause enemies to spawn in to attack. If you have neither you get no enemy attacks when you're not at you camp, unless you build your camp close to an existing spawn. I have one nearby spawn that sometimes shoots at my camp from a distance but it never seems to damage it and if another player draws it in (it's a low level scorched) my ally always seems to kill it before I do.
---
Death Blossoms is OK. I usually join in if a low level player is attempting it and provide backup. But there's literally no challenge for a high level player with it.
---
Thanks for the tip, I was looking for players or a community to join and have a good time with but so far my search has been for naught. It's a shame there is no guild or clan system in this game haha
---
Broke in a good or bad way cuz i can 2-1 shot scorchbeasts rn
---
It's probably possible at more events than just Line in the Sand, if you could figure out the spawn points and if they could be blocked by TENTs or whatnot.
---
Really though, the amazing thing about LITS is that even if you do this trick, and all the Scorched get obliterated in seconds, the event *still* goes on for quite a while.  When I look the Arrows I expend, basically 1 per wave, I count at least 15 waves of Scorched.  No wonder why the standard event is so monotonous.  If the last wave of 10 didn't stop us, the next 14 won't either.
---
Not if we want Public Team benefits.
---
Because Wendigo Colossus has very high dmg resistance, so AA works better (maybe) in this case. U can try it on Super Mutant to test if it was real or not
---
long story short, ZAX is programmed to FIND the best overseer, not have/support the best overseer. so once an overseer is selected and the test is done, its straight back to the start to find the best overseer again.
---
He said "every server" so he probably wants there always to be mobs for him to farm over and over.
---
FFR does work on a gauss rifle if you don't charge it. It is not a useful effect on that weapon.
---
Do..... do you genuinely not understand the fact that you can learn about things without actually doing them? Like do you seriously not realize that finding things out about a game is as simple as googling them? If that's the case then I honestly don't doubt that you really do need things explained to you as if you were a toddler.
---
So I guess the obvious question is does the game have text chat? Because if the answer is no then you've quite literally proven that I know something about the game without playing it and have negated your entire argument.
---
Please go ahead and prove to me that it does have text chat and that I'm wrong. I'll wait.
---
Most duped weapons were very specific - bloodied explosive legacies or bloodied 25/25 fixers / handmades
---
🍑
---
I suddenly want a Tombstone frozen pizza
---
Haha. Exactly. Kill faster = less deaths, less stims used, less fixing armor, less resources used, less farming time for resources, less respawning and wasting time, no retrieving loot..  massive game changer!
---
in most cases yes. but if a target is standing in a doorway @ 95% and you pull the trigger on a sniper rifle the round hits instantly. vs a bow. same scenario. the target can take one step and is now inside the doorway and the arrows move at way way slower speeds and you can watch the round impact the doorframe or wall. the % keeps going even after the round is fired its just  way more noticeable in weapons with slow velocity. and in the cases of arrows and granades the target moving closer or farther away is effected as the arch of the round does not ajust after fired.
---
For sure, I try to find a spot away from fences and tents and stand still while plinking away with my lever. After a while she focuses on me and lands, that's when I pull out my cryolator and popsicle her ass. 
---
Just don't sneak until she is on the ground.
---
maybe I need an adapter, at this point I'd pay for one
---
Make friends?
---
I don’t have turrets.
---
You mean they didn’t count on veteran players using it all to their advantage?
---
Yup.
---
Because they are bad so they have to use vats grenades and noob tubes with explosive perks.
---
I got mine earlier this week. Its the best plushie so far and the only one I put out.
---
and influence people
---
I thought it was if you used the same bethesda account
---
22 I think.  i missed all last weekend and this whole week.  
---
Hoping i can catch during double score weekend.
---
We had to kick a guy twice and block him because he joined three bloodied players and was sharing lvl 2 sun kissed ... we asked politely the first time before removing him 20 mins later he joined again.
---
People like different stuff.  I'm sure it's strange to many people that we like this game at all when there are other MORPGs with basic QoL features.
---
That's too bad about the visual bug. But I understand your excitement. I'm very happy with the jet pack :)
---
I do grasp that. But we’re talking about poor challenge *design* here.
---
Timegating: two “dedicated” players with the same playtime can receive drastically different rewards.
---
Level up challenge: Easiest to complete by creating a burner character purely for the daily challenge, basically bypassing it entirely. (IMO if you want to encourage play time like this, you’d be better off with a set “Play 30 minutes of any mode” challenge)
---
PVE/PVP: Shifting people between modes means people doing things they don’t want to do, or disrupting others gameplay (I don’t know how the dedicated NW people feel about the flood of Adventure players running in to pick locks and drop out of their teams...)
---
None of these are good parts of the system, and none of them reflect on the “dedication” level of the players working inside that system.
---
It's always been face-down, unfortunately.
---
Also about legacy, i got a jet pack raider power armour helmet and wondering if it is rare.
---
I prefer Piper...err wanderer.
---
5 minutes
---
I don’t think it gave me that option for the quest, but I’ll give it a shot next time I play. If not, I may do it on the secondary character I’m creating this weekend (double XP!) to get the trophy for siding with the other wastelanders faction and see if it works then.
---
5
---
I have all SS and T65 stuff. I got strangler back when the raif was around. 
---
The bullion grind for me is over, so is the rep grind so there really isn't much for me to do. There's only so many Uranium Fever and Tea Time i can do lmao
---
Hey the glitchy building mechanics, weird gimmicky perks, and the actually decent weapon variety make NW hilarious and fun compared to the other ones I've played 
---
Fortnite is alright, just can be a little too sweaty for me sometimes
---
I’m talking to my friend here lol
---
I found that if you fully charge the gauss rifle then enter VATS, it works just about every time , the bug seems to be if you enter VATS and then charge it always seems to miss the first shot or two
---
The real reason I run scorched Earth whenever I see it pop up.
---
Sure as hell not doing it for the lead pipes and 2 star combat armor.  LMAO.  Repair kits are nice too but I have 400 in my stash, don't really need more.
---
I put the xbox app on my phone. Any pictures that I want to save from the photo gallery, I hide the UI, take a screenshot of it, then upload it from my phone to my google drive. It's a bit of a silly method, but it does let me delete and save my images from there.
---
Hey henny good to see you !
---
And even the title got typo.. :(
---
im only doing events 24/7, fuck building and shit this isn't minecraft
---
My Intel is usually in the upper 20s, but I guess that's cool. I just like joining public parties in general.
---
It depends where you are situated. All bases will semi - frequently get attacked by "something". The game just periodically throws some dogs, or scorched against your base. Usually they just bust your crops or whatever.
---
If you are next to a world spawn however (a place that always spawns the same enemies), you may wish to have turrets - those world spawns re-spawn everytime someone new comes into the area.
---
My last C.A.M.P. had no turrets and the worse that happened was I maybe had to repair a wall.
---
My current C.A.M.P. is next to a world spawn Mirelurk pond. Everytime someone comes to visit my shop, 5 max level Mirelurks come charging out. What was an idyllic lakeside quiet spot is now the D-Day landings as waves of angry mirelurks charge over the corpses of their brethren into the teeth of 7 shotgun turrets and 3 search lights
---
Now it is - you can't put jetpacks on anything but torsos now....so if you find a piece like that, it's more unique.
---
Yes. Someone on my discord has already been unsuspended and is playing again. Though out of 50 odd members and 5/6 suspended he’s the only one back playing again.
---
Maybe he was just very very lucky.
---
try charging the gauss rifle and then enter VATS, that seems to work pretty good for me
---
I just met and started chatting to someone in my public team who I was helping defend their workshop. They were just a bit over level 60 (i think?) who was wearing an incomplete set of T-51 and when they invited me to trade and asked for some stims and food I saw they were using a non-legendary Laser Rifle. Set him up with my unused Ultracite PA modded with Medic Pump, Targeting HUD, and Calibrated Shocks. Then I gave him 50 stims, and a 3-star V/33/250 automatic Ultracite Laser Rifle!
---
Unused and extra stuff, but this guy was over the moon!
---
Happy cake day!
---
Idk :( my team was fighting the queen😔
---
Naw there was once innocents caught up in the first 2 ban waves for picking up duped items. Now...not so much.
---
Just spawn a little house with your camp lol
---
If you have the right building blueprint you can get them to blow themselves up more often than not
---
I get repeat plans all the time too (although I've yet to get a repeat BOS shielded lining) but my understanding, not really based on anything, is that once you learn a lining plan, only the next one drops for you during events (or if you have them all, you'll get repeat shielded lining plans like you have done)
---
Thanks, I have a full set of commando cards and I'm happy to change my explosive to an automatic receiver, as my main weapon is an instigating lever-action.   but I really want to try an LMG or heavy machine gun. I have a bloodied 50. cal in my shop so I might just start using that.
---
I use rather fasnaut beer stiens in my bar for that
---
Yeah I was level 25 and a dude who was level 225 came and one shot me over and over and took all my workshops. I know the workshops are PVP but like... you're 200 levels above me, let me have my 2 purified water every 10 minutes
---
I would sell some weapons like harpoon gun and broadsider. By the time I had access to those weapons I had already chosen to do a sneak rifle build based on perks. Would’ve been fun to experiment with them when I was a lower level.
---
I use a separate vendor that says "donations" above it and put a few bullets for 500, 1000, 5000, 10000.
---
I never actually expected someone to donate, I just thought it would be cute!  
---
Someone donated 5500 within my first hour of having it up O_O
---
Two-Shot hasn't been meta since BGS nerfed the damage and accuracy. I've seen the second shot travel almost 90 degrees from where I was aiming.
---
More likely, those were just Purv weapons that the players didn't want anymore. I've lost track of the number of crappy weapons I've sold to regular bot vendors, just. to get them out of my inventory.
---
Sounds like real life lol.
---
Really? I haven’t heard of a single unsuspended player yet thanks for giving me hope
---
Answer is still private servers. Even if you delete/repost. Also, welcome to multiplayer games. This must be your first.
---
150 is a fair price I’ve seen much higher.
---
How do you build bonds?
---
Was it just a server shut down? Or is the whole game down. It's just fine for me in xbox. They do take old worlds down from time to time though
---
I've found that sometimes the Sentry bots spawn as lvl 16 instead of 60.
---
Is it worth anything or did too manny ppl craft them and shoud i keep it for it to go upp in prize if it will do that?
---
Fly Swatter. Especially if you're Bloodied Range. Fast Travel to it, one or two shots, and it's done.
---
I believe you nerd exp to comment. Otherwise there's no knowledge to back up your stance. I refer you to the surgeon analogy previous. 14 years of school. Fix heart.
---
You: no exp of game
---
Wellacktually.jpg
---
Just servers
---
Like I said we all think he’s just been damn lucky somehow as he’s the only one I know of who’s back.
---
Irrational fear and surface to air events are decent quick and a decent amount of xp for how short they are. Especially during double xp.
---
Definitely cozy up there. Glad I got out too, and would love to see Fallout take a spin up there. Anchorage, either during or post war, would make for some great content.
---
It’s always fun to pop in and see him sitting ass-backwards in his chair
---
How is the t-65?
---
Well, a lot of people had them...but you can't make them anymore, so eventually they will become pretty rare.
---
Yeah but at least we know what will lead to penalties and what won't in real life. That's what I mean. Still, thanks for this information.
---
I normally play a stealth rifleman, but for the queen, I usually end up running around like a headless chicken trying not to hit other people. but I'll try stealth commando thanks.
---
Yeah I guessed as much
---
It’s a matter of finding the right partner. My wife plays with me and we have two TVs and two xboxes in the living room. The couple that games together stays together!
---
The Bow is particularly maddening.  They added it with Wastelanders, and it apparently never occurred to anyone at Bethesda to make sure it worked with VATS.
---
Helevetia....good memories of that place
---
I think it's this, just refreshing the old worlds that had been up for awhile cause I got the same thing on my private world.
---
Just south of vault 76 by the wood mill is a huge flat open field with nothing around but a few hay bales
---
I've also had the problem with vats and bows/charging weapons. I spent quite a bit of time yesterday playing with my new instigating bow toy and found a reasonable workaround for missing in vats. I found that when I nocked and drew the arrow prior to hitting vats, and then released the arrow the instant I triggered vats on a target, I hit with the 95% accuracy that was listed. If anything, I hit with a higher percentage than listed.
---
I was at line in the sand and was hitting scorched at their spawn points from the platforms, an insane distance to hit with a bow projectile. I was even hitting the sierra bravos at max projectile range. Doing roughly 1500 damage on headshots and killing more scorched than the big guns boys, they must have been "who is this guy with the hacked bow?". The key is to draw first, release the instant you lock on with vats, and if a follow up shot is needed, exit vats, nock, draw, rinse and repeat. I double checked this with my gauss rifle and it seemed to work well with it, also.
---
I usually find when I turn up and start collecting ore at least one other person joins in to try and reach 100 ore, which we almost always do.
---
If I turn up solo though...yeah I'm just going to farm some xp.  But if someone else comes in I switch to ore collecting as I'm already a good ways ahead in the season.
---
Have you (frequently?)entered an underground camp via a bass before?  Lol.  Wanna maybe corner this thing before I report it.
---
Lol that's how I feel talking about moving product in gta. I swear I'm not a kingpin!
---
They added a tracker or something a bit ago to collect data as to why this is happening. Don’t expect a fix anytime soon.
---
Stims, camp plans 10caps, modded leather armor, dog food, diesel cure, radaway.
---
They weren't yesterday, so probably not today.
---
thanks, I have a bloodied .50 cal, but none of the armor to go with it. I'll have a look for some pieces and give it a go.
---
So i shoud keep it and hope for it to be worth some thing in the future?
---
I'm just in it for the cosmetics man. Like 2 more decent matches am ill be at 100. The I'm out haha
---
Okay, thanks! Was about to log in!
---
If you *want* to sell stimpacks and rad away set up shop near whitesprings  and nuke it.
---
You're best of wearing pa with emergency protocols when using heavys. Stabilzed is a great perk
---
Thanks man.  I super appreciate it.  I always feel really guilty that people feel like I'm trying to troll when I bring things like this up.  It's nice finally getting through to someone.  I just want everyone to be able to love this game like we do.
---
I feel the same way but any smart person tracking you will understand it is for a video game once they go through your history lol. I make sure to ALWAYS put "fallout 76" after anything I search for so nothing nefarious pops up.
---
One thing, you’re not Canadian are you? LOL just kidding. How many were you looking for? I think I’ve got close to 400 over two characters. I’m really glad that they don’t weigh anything since they don’t give you an option to quit collecting the tokens. LOL
---
Thx i have been wondering that
---
I thought the Capitol was instanced
---
I finish the vault raid usually around lv. 40 or so.
---
That would be a cool alternate start kind of thing. You create a new character that finally escapes the simulation for adventure mode, and NW is what that character went through before they escaped.
---
If yer not fast, yer last!
---
Also make sure you have a garden and water purifiers labeled free.  Make sure they can see the stuff as they spawn dont hide it in a maze.if you really wanna help out hang around with a mic on to offer advice and mabye you can custom order some weapons.  Also low level brotherhood scout rifles are very nice.
---
Just play.
---
Unfortunately no.
---
I think the Free States bunkers in general were my favorite. Except for Ella's, all those microscopes and aluminum trays with nary a workbench in sight. Such a troll move.
---
Camp plans and recipes will be popular for starters. Recipes are found around the world but take time to find. Camp plans usually drop from defending workshops which not many low level players do because of the PvP aspects of taking workshops (do it once, die, vow to never again). Those are the most popular things in my shop. 
---
Also ammo such as .308, .38, .45 and 10mm. It's a shame that those cannot be bulked and sold for less than 1 cap each. I often put .38 and 10mm in free, but in small quantities otherwise it'll get snapped up by higher level players who want to resell at 1 cap each. 
---
Personally I think that placement is important but also how your shop looks. If I see a vendor in the Forest region that is owned by a higher level player (if they happen to be in residence so I can see) then I MAY visit if convenient in my travels, because they may have something of interest. If low level then it may be a mule selling high level gear, but probably not in the Forest. If the shop/camp is complex and full of atom store stuff then that actually may put off low level players (maybe?), Thinking that it may be overpriced or too high level. So, keep it simple, just some vending machines and work benches - not forgetting a cooking station and stash box.  Many times I've walked to the nearest camp on the map to scrap weapons and stash scrap only to find the stash is behind locked doors. 
---
Sorry that's long, just my rambling thoughts on it.🤓
---
are you that A-hole that kept shooting me for being defensive?  my heavy build can practically solo the defense by myself.  i default defensive until i see the other players can hold the line, THEN i go grab ore.  this low level a-hole keeps shooting me and giving me thumbs down for not "playing the game to his liking".  so i said FINE i stopped shooting and grab ore to reach minimum ore needed to succeed event, defense gets overwhelmed in about 1 minute.  then i revert back to defense, and i hold the line no problem.  i also notice while he was giving me the thumbs down, he never actually mined ore himself(he cant handle rad in that noob excavator armor LOL)
---
honestly, pissing on others because they arent playing the way you want is griefing.  if you don't like it?  leave and go elsewhere.  face it rad rumble event reward sucks; majority of people come for the xp and legend drops.
---
'-'
---
This lad right here yeah congressional Medal of Honor yeah
---
Wait 10 minutes more, better to be safe.
---
Understandable lol, I'm grinding it out for them too 
---
But I'll still play now and again for funsies, plus it gives pretty good XP and some pocket change for Adventure mode haha
---
You could get quite a bit for it now. but I'd hold off. It's a legacy item now and will probably only go up in value.
---
I built one of my vendors in a different area than the others and its controlled by a switch inside my locked house. This is the vendor I sell all of the cheap stuff for newer players since I can turn it on or off when I want, i can just turn it on when i want someone to have a good deal or some free stims.
---
actually i am, i was in a competitive clan back when counter strike was a thing, was the only canadian in an american team, they gave me that name, i kept it since then lol. just need one suit, dont feel like grinding the challenges
---
Yeah I was able to skip the pre 50 grind with my nw toon. Was good to just dive in to my commando build haha
---
I did 300+ levels using vats and i tried any weapon in vats with the build 100% dedicated to it, not saying i know things better, i tried it enough to see how it work, the only thing that matter is when you click, if the vats "accept" the shot, it's going to hit, simple as that, and if it's a grenade / arrow, it's going to become funny because you'll watch the thing making whole movements even turning and circling just to hit your target. try that on a scorchbeast making it's fast flying attack, you'll see what happen.
---
He has always done this.  You need to make sure NO ONE get in his way as he paths.  If you do get in his way and he starts going randomly in another direction you need to talk to him and he will start pathing back the right way.  Also, dont stand on the hives or he freaks out and does the same thing.
---
same here, got booted from my private world
---
I can't pull up stats of weapons in the item search, it's always been my fav feature!
---
They do stack, but the effect rolls over.  So, if a person opens a 5th lunchbox, the effect goes to *zero*, in spite of what the Effects tab says.  Pretty dumb.  And awful because, you know, when people are opening lunchboxes for big events, most of them are just trying to be nice, totally unaware that they've wrecked the buff for everyone.
---
["You ate his face??"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_8xozaLLdY)
---
the game is definitely pretty generous with stims but i always have about 50% or less life, that would be super helpful imo. 
---
At what point will i learn to craft these things or am i not looking in the right places?
---
I just got it yesterday too! I think we're pretty much on par, if anything barely a day behind.
---
Think he meant stored as in build items stored, 
---
Your stash has no impact on the build limit, except for displayed items wich double dip in stash weight and build limit
---
because you were foolish enough to be withing thump thump range.
---
I'm sorry but you sound like an asshole yourself, i'v most likely never met you.
---
No, I'm on PC.
---
I don't usually do Project Paradise, so I don't have much data on that. As for Scorched Earth, yeah, that's firmly in the unreliable category - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I've always attributed that to the server lag caused by the nuclear blast, but maybe the problem is more general than that.
---
Really? I was pretty sure it is. Did you recently loot it then try to server hop? Because the game has a habit of sometimes throwing you right back in the same server after leaving one.
---
You normally need to leave the world for 5 mins then re-enter to repopulate it for enemies.
---
How much do you think it might go for in like a year?
---
You have to be out of the private world about 5 minutes or it puts you back in the same one
---
And the log cabin - and the seedy shack for that matter.
---
That's an asshole move. Maybe that person has duped stuff, or maybe...
---
I've been playing since beta and now have six playable characters and two mules. The sixth character is level 18. I have a bunch of very nice stuff in my inventory and got none of it through duping. The characters use weapons and gear that fits their build and their level is not an indication of the hours put in to the game.
---
You don't know what lives other people are living and it's poor sportsmanship to make the assumptions you did.
---
If you rushed that 5 minutes you had after that sentry bot you would have saved your progress.
---
It saves progress once you meet the people in the vault that are behind the glass.
---
Yeah man I hate this. Throws a wrench in my play time. Since this is prime baby nap time lol
---
Just went in as another player was clearing it out.
---
then how did any of you waste your time? the people unlocking it now have to grind the exact same amount of XP you had too. i don‘t get the problem here? the rewards aren‘t tradeable anyway, so it‘s not like your stuff lost value.
---
In the words of Gandalf: “Fly you fools.”
---
It takes special plans, but it's kind of a joke at this point because most of them you could get from the Holiday Presents which have been duped to oblivion
---
Lol you only need to log out while the clock strikes :)
---
I think they did it on purpose so people can place items against the wall without them placing on top of it.
---
I didn't have to launch a nuke to get it, I was group leader with the quest active and someone in my group launched it and it counted
---
That’s awesome, I made the guess because of the GT. How many are you needing total? I think it takes 450 to buy the whole outfit with the mask. It’s been so long
---
Its easy (sort of) you get in one of these subreddits and post your platform (ps4, xbone, pc) and tell people you're looking for friends. Lots of high level players are bored to death and just LOVE helping out lowbies. (Not all though, some are serious grinders who cant be bothered out of thier routine) Fallout is good for that much at least, a super helpful fanbase (especially on reddit)
---
Pre wastelanders I would do bots on parade every time I would see it in the bog.  Would spawn small groups of level 68 mutants and almost always at least one legendary.  Now it has the issue you brought up.
---
Not sure if it was a fluke but one time I did it with a public team and when it wasn't just me doing it solo, it was spawning groups of 4 to 6 enemies at a time and none of them friendly like usual.  Not sure if this is an intentional change or just the game being weird though.
---
The problem is the design philosophy.  Bethesda *wants* daily interaction with the game, daily eyeballs on the atomic store, and the resulting cash fllow.  But they also want to attract their core audience with stuff like the Wastelanders questline.  But those two aims are too far apart - focus too much on story and world, and you don't end up with enough interesting, daily repeatable content.  That's what's happened here, I think.
---
get off reddit then, you don‘t know how it works. you‘re not even replying to OP but don‘t notice that. but your hypocritical ass that uses abbreviations tries to act high and mighty now. chill tf out buddy, you ain‘t it.
---
I’ve been giving legendaries our to people because I can’t get rid of enough in scrip to be able to play.  Got some level 15 stuff from events and some 35s weighing you down? Find a newbie and lighten the burden onto them.
---
Not with interiors at least, I leave and log right back in and go right back to farming the ghouls inside fort defiance.
---
What's the third one? I've done Poseidon and Monongah
---
You can force spawns at radiation rumble as well but it's bad spawns.
---
People will sit in the tunnels which forces the ghouls to spawn further back in the tunnels meaning it takes longer for them to get killed meaning less spawns during the event. So by being greedy they're playing themselves. 
---
BUT every now and then it forces the ghouls to spawn in the rad shower room in the middle. And next thing you know you've got 4 dead scavengers and a failed event.
---
Got booted from private aswell.
---
&gt;  i don’t understand how 6 people in power armor and mini guns/50 cals can’t keep them alive. 
---
It truly is an amazing phenomenon to witness, isn't it?
---
I'll have it today and I havent done any dailies on purpose since the first day.
---
Becuz they can't aim with guns and or play on controller or at least that what i notice...not to shame them or anything
---
Explosive is not OP but a decent build. They have downsides compared to AR's.
---
So you actually don't comprehend that you don't have to experience something to learn about it. Gotcha. And I'm guessing from your complete avoidance of the text chat question you can't prove that I'm wrong about the game not having it.
---
Before responding again you might want to take a look at these links. I think they'll help you out quite a bit going forward.

I guess we will find out soon
---
Be a carnivore

---
eat the peperoni roll on the countertop
---
have +60 carry weight for an hour
---
(ribeye steak is +40 lbs for carnivores and easier to keep a stock of)
---
you need help finding a spot or actually building it?
---
And actually the ammo converter is pretty decent for fuel as well, the only thing that isn’t decent is actually crafting it at a tinker bench.
---
Really, it's not a stupid question.  I don't think they ever actually point it out with a quest marker or anything.
---
Have the same issue. Started noticing a few days ago too (but doesn't mean the issue didn't start earlier than that) since I've been low on Atoms and discontinued 1st sub because of this horrible implementation of a battle pass.
---
The game notifies of the challenge completion and atoms rewarded, and you can briefly even see your actual balance when you go to the Atom shop, but isn't actually given to you and it will just revert back to what you had before the challenge completion in a moment.
---
[I posted a ticket about that as well.](https://help.bethesda.net/app)
---
There are also bunch of challenges that seem to be bugged where parts of them don't get ticked off when completed. Now that the possible Atom earn from 'daily/weekly challenges' is 5x less than it used to be, I feel they should have the responsibility to keep their promise on still getting atoms from the OG challenges.
---
LOL this is Fallout everything about it is unconventional especially when it comes to building🤣🤣 (for instance there are shelves that you can't put anything in)
---
Sweet, the more you know.
---
How come? Can't I just keep making better ones as I level up?
---
&gt; a power plant power up
---
Those events are triggered, kinda like how Patrol Duty and a bunch of others used to be. It only pops up when someone goes nearby.
---
Both really im currently at the junk extractor at the end of the monorail for my camp but i want to move and rebuild my base
---
Nah, just cripple him more with Enforcer.
---
you can still get 4k a kill from the sentry bots.
---
Keep the Bloodied one. With 90% Reduced Weight you can keep it with no problem or even just display it
---
How big of a jerk do you have to be to steal a soon to be low level player's weapon, they way I see it is we are supposed to help the low levels, and that one high level is a disgrace to all of us.
---
33% hit is a bugged effect for shotguns. May wanna try it out kn vats
---
It is possible to get one. Try server hoping different player vendors or one of the many trade groups online. but be warned its possibly gonna cost a pretty penny in caps just for being bloody. Last one i seen was about 4,000 caps. Then if it has any good 2nd or 3rd legendary effects its gonna drive the cost up more.
---
I'll try that, thank you :)
---
I play a on private server 90% of the time. Whenever i'm finished with my farming route i simply exit to main menu and start a private server again. Bada Bing Bada Bong, all enemies have respawned. No waiting needed. (West stek will sometimes bug out and not spawn mutants inside). Try it for yourself.
---
They do almost always return and with a discount. I've been playing since Feb 2019 and seen most bundles appear again on sale. Even items I thought were rare like the mosaic floor that was early and before I was buying atoms store stuff has now been around a couple of times for a discounted price.
---
Why are you STILL talking bruh. Let this be a lesson. You wasted time typing all this. Idc
---
no idea how maby it takes, but i thought u were selling the outfits lol not the token, i can buy u the token but cant afford 450 tokens at 20 caps each yet, just bought some serum recipes. ill let u know when i get 10k. add me still
---
So in angry turtles video, he shows how the SBQ lands more frequently in the nuke zone. So I went to into the nuke zone and fought her, she landed many times for a long period in there.
---
I was not able to cripple her, she just landed more frequently naturally within the nuke zone. Outside the zone, it was impossible to get SBQ on the ground for more than 15 seconds at a time.
---
A lot of people don't rush it on their first try.  It can be pretty tiring if you haven't done it before and don't know what you're doing.
---
your game works totally different then mine . as i see 0% up to 95%  hit chances through vats and watch the vat grey out when the targets pass between something that is in between me and them. and the round do not pass through solid object to guarantee hit the enemies. they stop resulting in no hits. idk if its a system thing, or if ive got some setting diffrent then yours. but my vats do not auto hit at low % ratings and the rounds are stopped by wall and structures if the creatures move between them and the number on the hud reflect those changes.
---
Put on the enforcer card and break his legs first.  Then make fun of him with your buddy.  Ask him "what's the matter guy?  Got no legs?"  Then snap a selfie with him, then put him out of his misery.
---
how are they supposed to make money from atoms if they don't end the 9 dailies?
---
Sometimes they don’t all drop at once
---
I thought for a moment you were saying you had a store called the observant radstag
---
and I would like to shop there
---
also tipping jar, great idea, maybe a VTU one that says COLLEGE FUND
---
 There should be 9. Maybe yours hasn't loaded properly. Bethesda said 9 dailies for a while
---
The Deep. My new favorite place, lordy is it pretty. Anywhere there is a radstorm but now, as a higher level, I find the Cranberry Bog oddly...peaceful.
---
Down by the kill box is nice
---
1 in 4 Groups on PS4 are Building Groups.
---
Thanks PS Community to be Up to Date :)
---
You're right that there are definitely ways to prop up your carry weight with food, mutations, drugs, etc.  I'm just talking about power armor.
---
If your not right next to vault 76 - nothing 😅. If you're in between the vault and the wayward, every low level piece of gear you have as well as outfits that arent easy to get early on, like arktos lab coats &amp; sheepsquatch outfits &amp; faschnacht masks. I've been gifting underarmors and lvl 20 fixers to people but those are good to sell for cheap too.
---
well i'm on xbone. But if you're looking for a junk pile location use this https://fo76map.com/
---
Click HIDE ALL and then click junk. It'll show you where all the junk piles are. There's at least two that have water near them. One in the mire and one near crater.
---
and I thought I am the only one. this week whole my weekly was also not available
---
First shot ALWAYS misses in vats.   You can be standing point blank have 95 show up and still miss everytime. 
---
First shot is most important. Therefore broke AF.
---
Saddly... Your right
---
you're opening a lot of closed doors for the rest of us
---
You think they’re still loading? I think they’ve messed up.
---
Whats good about there ?
---
Ah ok :(
---
I’m just so glad I can stop taking pictures of stuff for davenport and finding stolen modules and former raiders and radio tubes. Finished getting both factions to ally today.
---
Can you install mods from nexusmods on Game Pass installations? If so, try the [text chat mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151?tab=description).
---
I’m Xbox hence the post 🤣
---
Maybe after winning your first game
---
Not to mention my preliminary testing showed that the foundation for it is less than 3 foundations wise and more than 2 foundations deep, so matching it up would still leave something to desire in terms of symmetry
---
Waste of resources. Better off looting gear off enemies.
---
This is really the right strategy.
---
Go, collect the ore, but don't turn it in right away.  Let the event play out until it's about to end, then put all the ore in.
---
If people are feeling lucky, you can coordinate dropping some in for Floaters, and more for Deathclaws.  But often, once someone drops ore in, others will act compelled to do it too and end the event too early.
---
I’ve seen a few up to start and more a bit later happen before.
---
You don’t need to build... the buff for building teams is extra intelligence which gives you more xp
---
friend tried it and it didnt work :c
---
my turrets keep taking it down
---
not observant enough
---
I do hope then that Xbox catches up! :) a Reminder havent hurt anybody right! :P
---
Ive been playing the waiting game and catching things when they come back around too.  Saved me a lot of atoms honestly.  Most thing usually come back around but it's not guaranteed in writing anywhere they will.  Nor do we ever know when they will if they do come back around, or if there will be a discount.  It's worked pretty well for the most part  except I've been waiting for the Mr Pebbles backpack to come back around for what feels like forever and I'm kicking myself for just not buying it when i saw it.
---
Yeah I’d like riding shotgun to be a public event with a free fast travel. I’ll want to start it but I can’t solo it bc I don’t have god-tier end game weapons or build
---
Just west is the dry lake, you can build on the cliff or down by the water. Easily defensible to low lvl roamers. Plenty of stuff close by to farm.
---
I played line in the sand yesterday and every group of scorched would spawn right next to the sonic thing essentially turning it into a shooting gallery. Cleaned out the vendors caps with all the loot afterwards
---
I pre charge the shot and it seems to fix it for me
---
There is also a server seed for legendary based on the time the server is created.
---
Good luck.
---
I think it's a simulation inside a simulation
---
I see 4 as well. What is and what is supposed to be are two different things unfortunately.
---
We just need more dungeons to do
---
I got 8
---
Thunder mountain it's too right of map close af to the munitions factory
---
Never done the run. For one, I don't like the I idea of nuking things, but, even if I was cool with the idea? I can't fight that kind of robotic action. A single Assaultron will wreck me fast, and Gutsies are hyper-dangerous. I just don't have the kind fo combat build needed to survive it.
---
My fault, really.
---
Well a bunch of high level people got banned and the new game pass players don't have vendors up yet and are still figuring out the game.
---
I really hope this isn’t true..
---
Oh i know where that is now i used to live there
---
you would figure with the influx of al lthe new people they would be popping up
---
I just encountered this for the first time yesterday 🤣🤣
---
Census Violence, Heart of the Swamp, Real Blast Enclave Events (Harper's Ferry, Seneca Rocks, Abandoned Bog Town), Dropped Connection (Berkeley Springs, Harper's Ferry).
---
When I have a low level player join I often seek them out and give them any unwanted plans/armor/weapons that are weighing me down, so don't be afraid to join. I suspect a lot of players are the same way.
---
Ight bet, next search is "how to steal all the gold bullion"
---
Yes it’s the 20 most popular game on Xbox live right now...
---
For the awesome GT, I’ll just give you all the ones I have on my main. I really don’t need caps, got two mules maxed. I don’t need the tokens. Hockey is the best sport ever, IMO. And I was born and raised in Texas
---
They were doing server updates too so a lot of players backed out for the Dailey reset (so they don't bug out) and for the servers to update.
---
But now they are savages who relish the opportunity to murder and torment humans (which they consider a sport).
---
Killing them shouldnt be raising any moral issues.
---
I'm seeing 8 challenges
---
LOL yep happens to my mom quite a bit (before she got the SS legs now she just dies from her explosive gun 🤣🤣)
---
They already dodged a few ones with the canvas bag and the dark rhum fiascos.
---
I remember one time, I messed with a griefer who unwisely had their switch out in the open like that.
---
They eventually wised up and locked the door to their shed.  But didn't realize they locked me inside with it. 😋
---
Damn bro you sound salty. Try reading next time so you can fully comprehend the situation.
---
I do hope xp will scale along with damage. Makes the whole wasteland a bit more worthwhile mucking around in.
---
Oh! Okay. I’m reloading my game as I type this..... aaaand..... I have 8 now... but 4 are completed already FML
---
Honestly I just slap on the Chinese stealth suit and sneak around to grab the ore
---
I was about to ask wish platform you play on ( i am on PC ) but i'd feel it weird to make such difference in vats depending wich platform you're on ( and that's the part where i am not experimented with )
---
this happened to my wife. she became addicted to some chems, and has serums that lowered her ap to the point vats no longer worked as she didnt have enough ap at full bar to equal a single vat shot.
---
same with line in the sand
---
you shouldn’t let scott launch the damn nukes if he can’t even make em land on fissure site prime.
---
Ah the memories of playing the game at release....
---
To expand on the Legendary Sales bit from Schultz, I find that the following works for me:
---
* There are three types of legendary items: high market, low market, and Power Pairs
---
   * High market: Junkies, Bloodied, Unyeilding
---
   * Low Market: Anything else
---
   * Power Pairs: Anything that combos well, such as %25 faster fire rate or Explosive with any High market.
---
* 1 Star: 500 Caps High market, Scrip low market
---
* 2 Star: 1000 caps High market, 500 caps Low, 1500 caps PP
---
* 3 Star: 1500 Caps High, 500 caps Low, \*Do research\* for PP.
---
You can find info on really high tier items at places like [https://fed76.info/](https://fed76.info/), which has served me well enough (I tend to undersell the listed prices). Some items and combos are worth way more than expected because of various bugs or strange effects (I got a god tier %25 Fire Rate Junkies minigun yesterday, and I would not trade it for anything, because dear lord)
---
Same I only got 8.
---
Any event with lots of enemies, project paradise too
---
I saw one yesterday on my private server. Its still in the game.
---
I only have talons , marsupial , speed demon , healing factor and herbivore(I only eat melons👁👄👁)
---
I got 8 too. Where is the 9th?
---
[Boom](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Nji1wR3q5hoHOKwKQWnK5p1qhtub7O64XPGZxeimpI/edit?usp=drivesdk)
---
Monster Mash mask visual bug, I love fusing that mask with others after the event is done and take pictures of the result.
---
Yup 4 of mine also auto completed.
---
Ahhhh I never used or knew about that feature, sounds useful for sure.

There are not enough YASSSSSS gifs on the internet for this post.

Day before yesterday.

Does the counter also reset to one hour after opening a new box? So the best way would be opening a box every 59 minutes until 100%?

I agree. I regret scrapping some of my rolls for the ss armor because I’m thinking of trying some different builds. You might as well

Did you try using a floor mat on the foundation? That works with most things.
---
long ago. that was a method of xping like crazy nuke the White springs stand by teh clubhouse kill the 20+ gouls inside. log out then back in and all of them would respawn and you could farm like crazy for 30 minutes.   they kinda nurfed that
---
It collects ammo? Sold!
---
Thank you for posting.
---
Did you recently start trying nuclear winter for the score challenges?  If it's the same noise I'm thinking of it happens after playing nuclear winter and stays until the game is closed and relaunched.
---
Yeah I did that. Logged back in 2 minutes past. 4 of mine were auto completed. Guess I'm better off giving it the 15 before and after like I've been doing lol
---
Yes. If you read the world you can maximize though. If there aren’t any glitch weapons, the legendaries that spawn won’t get 1 shot. When I find a perfect world like this I hop between building and hunting until the very end, and swap to events. Massive xp this weekend. It’s amazing with public team bonuses. And I launch nukes on these worlds alllll night long. Then some sweaty level 300 comes with his glitch weapon and suddenly the luster is gone.
---
Dataminer friend of mine said that Event Teams are bugged and giving increased XP for many things, not just events which makes them better since they're not working just for event completion xp like intended.
---
That's why I join event teams even if i'm not chaining events like you'd expect.
---
There's a massive area north of grafton that is pretty flat. Only issue is that the ground looks like old coconut jizz. Scenery isn't great either.
---
Not really. I’ve seen it run right into mobs. But I’ve also followed it to the end several times
---
The bug where with the strange in numbers with bird bones full team makes you not fall and you can walk in the sky I used to walk over watoga
---
i play on xbone.
---
Dude wtf, how? 30 minutes, like you could punch a sentry bot and kill it in less time? I aint gone lie, if it takes you 30 minutes to kill a non boss mob, updates arnt yah biggest problem. Maybe check your build
---
Same. Thought they put a fix in for it. 4 of 8 auto completed. This is a big load of bull, they need to give us something for this haha
---
I went online 10 minutes after reset and it still got me.  I had not been playing today prior to this.  Lost 1,250 SCORE.
---
Anywhere you can find a mole miner
---
Honestly, I really hope they flesh out the purpose of camps more. I’d love for them to become social hubs for trading(like a portable grand exchange).
---
Dude. All mine auto completed. I’ll trade ya! Lmao
---
Lol I love that bass notification bug.
---
When you load back in you should have 8b with 4 of them auto completed. Least that's what happened to me.
---
Far to many to choose from but maybe the one where you can see the person you were playing with even though they're actually offline (I don't mean AFK I mean like they shut there game and Xbox off yet you still see the person's character) and they're not only naked but also look like "Slenderman" (as some people call it).
---
I understand not using Mic but I wish people wouldn't turn player volume down. I just want to be able to let them know something about the event
---
Give us 18 daily’s. Only 1 didn’t auto complete. Shit, gonna need a lot of score to catch up
---
No youre not missing anything.
---
With the exeption of bloodied AA will do more damage than the other legendary effects against the SBQ and the wendigo colossus.  Due to them have a % damage reduction effect.
---
The sbq and colossus have a % damage reduction on top of the very high DR. So what happens with that furious gun,  is most of the bonus damage you gain from it is being negated and than applied against that 300- 400 DR they have.  While your AA gun may have its damage reduce by the % reduction, it still drops their DR by 50% so it ends up doing more damage in the end. Atleast according to the screen numbers.
---
Prime example my junkies western revolver sneak headshots the queen for 34 damage while my AA will hit her for 41. But my junkies does significantly more damage than the AA to every other monster i come across.
---
No, arnt good enough for people to make profit duping
---
Don’t know if there is a specific spot where enemies use Combat Rifles. 
---
Top of the World, clear those scorched some of them sometimes use combat rifles. 
---
Emmet Mountain, clear those non hostile NPCs, they often have combat rifle +it’s free XP &amp; Stimpacks. 
---
Try vendor stations, they could have some mods or plans.
---
I just watched that too.  I'm actually considering moving some perk points around to up my Int...
---
The only reason explosive Legacies are so sought after is because they discontinued them "temporarily" to fix the mechanics... a year ago... Let alone all the other bugs in game like the bungalow, ammo converter, etc. Yet dupes and other cheats get fixed right away and bans come. Theirs blame on both sides. Bethesda just never owns up to fixing their side of things. Also the prior dupes have remnants still and still affect the "economy" in-game... but you know "shame" on those players for wanting their dream guns in game and wanting to enjoy the broken game a little more. It was also a day one glitch so are they going back to the start?
---
Yep, you're so busy not caring that you've responded to every single one of my responses up until now. That's a whole lot of not caring lmao
---
I get that it might take a lot of work to rub both of your brain cells together long enough to formulate an actual response that addresses a single thing I said but come on man, you can do better than that.
---
Wish I saw this earlier, I just got the bundle for the Backwoods Bungalow. Very disappointed about it and I hope it gets fixed, plus now I won’t be able to afford the bundle with the train :(
---
Very true. :D
---
Great, thank you.
---
Yeah I really need diesel cure. Lol!
---
Are we supposed to collectively pat you on the back or something?
---
Yeah man this throws people way behind. It's ridiculous
---
No and apparently neither does Bethesda 😆
---
It was there some weeks ago...
---
Kinda gutted it gets removed completely, was hoping the ghillie would make SS armour look less ugly but if it makes the jetpack invisible I'm not keen on it. Smh more broken content
---
Shhhhh, you go away now. Shoo.
---
I’ve not heard of this before, is there any proof or testing that’s been done?
---
Fax
---
Right! Like every week you need to get roughly 15 levels to complete it the last week. I’m doing well with that. But this makes it hard to keep up. Tbh
---
I always am in a full server. A bunch of new people being it’s on game pass but the only time where there isn’t many is when I’m playing until 1 am eastern us time through the week.
---
I don't think the TENTs were a part of that bundle.   I have them, but I never had the bundle.  I think they were just given out as part of 1st.
---
I have the same glitch, except I didn't got anything!
---
Seem to get a decent number of them from clearing out Camden park and also Brim quarry which is up the hill from there.
---
I’ve been playing since around May? I don’t remember seeing it once. Correct me if I’m wrong. Is there any way to check previous atom shop stuff?
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
If you were a noob toobin douchnozzle at level 1, you'll be a noob toobin douchnozzle at 200
---
They glitch out a lot when you self stack them. Even only stacking 2 or 3 I kept having the xp bonus drop back down to 25% within 10-15 minutes. I was on a private server with a mule sitting at 76 in my public team. 
---
With out a lunch box (but with relish, brain fungus soup, lovers embrace and lvl 3 inspirational) I am maxing out single creature xp (4,000) on sentry bots, behemoths and lvl 91 deathclaws and maxing out xp for quests (6000) a lvl 68 super mutant will net me 1350 and a max ghoul 850. Add one lunch box mutant hits 1700 and ghoul 1050, 2 lunch boxes mutant 2110 and ghoul 1185. Three lunchboxes gave me inconsistent numbers around 2400 for a mutant and 1400 for a ghoul. 
---
Are the xp caps new? I feel like i broke those numbers last year.
---
Edit: Autocorrect switched ghoul to goal, fixed it.
---
Rated F for Friendly
---
Players must be at *least* L250 before they have earned the right to have the RNG of finding the red asylum dress.
---
Erbody know.
---
so you do all the work and they get all the xp and loot? Nawww. I'd rather fail.
---
bro if a lvl 250 be buyin yo shit items, feel bad for then lmfao especially if its stims
---
This, tent skins are just part of 1st.
---
There is no fix. Been happening for months.
---
alot of factors can affect this #1. server stress as you may be on a server that has been nuked, and or is being used by dupers, #2. large amount of items in your stash and inventory is constantly being checked with anti cheating software #3. someones glitched the build limit of their camp making the server unstable.... and a few others things
---
@vanathru. I didn’t get the score from it. They were just “complete” so now I have no score to get except the 10k XP
---
This is my logic too
---
That people still risk logging in so soon after the reset is baffling to me.
---
That’s highly disappointing because I bought the bundle assuming I would get the tents and now I don’t want to keep this bundle lol
---
I got mine on Wednesday. He's now celebrating Christmas with Mr Pebbles in my maze camp.
---
Why is there not a lobby like every other BR game?
---
Yea heavy guns simply do a better job, and I think that’s a very logical decision on game dev’s part.
---
I know but I didn't even got any Score points from it. I now completed the only challenge that was left.
---
Lol hey at least it doesn't take as long to make up for with 2xp
---
Not to my knowledge...
---
You can buy the levels with atoms. That is the fix.
---
I know. I'm normally a 15 before 15 after. But I was lead to believe they had made it better lol. Guess not. 
---
I just don't have a ton of play time, this is prime baby napping time and about my best shot at getting them finished
---
Nooooo you can't just out dps me!
---
Haha minigun goes brrrrrrt
---
Same!
---
"Anyone else had this?"
---
Welcome to the sub!
---
Anybody named Murphy in your team? His law just fucked you over a lot. XD
---
Yah ive had thsi for a long time, bethesda dont care, valseek doesnt ever respond to anything bout this one or the respawn glitch. Its to do with healing factor. Ive had it for months, you just learn to play around it
---
Make sure to complete all dailies and weeklies as well as maximize your xp. Use a YouTube video or two to see strategies for maximizing your XP gain. Also, save all the atoms you earn because you might have to purchase the last 5-10 ranks or so.
---
Scorched use a lot of combat rifles too.
---
as i haven't gotten every item in the game memorized that doesnt help me at all. i dont know how many ap points you have, i do not know how many points you have in agility. i just know what happend to her and all it took was a med and shoe gcould vat again casue getting in game drunk messed up her vats.
---
I got like 4 score ranks last night with the double EXP. Shit was glorious.
---
Lol xD
---
I mean without getting rewarded
---
Is that why my husband always asks me to google it when he nukes🤬 Not fair. 😩
---
lol Minis are so satisfying to shoot it’s addictive
---
Makes sense
---
It’s baffling to me that this hasn’t been fixed yet.
---
Most likely that bethesda couldn't be arsed to also ghillie up the jetpack so instead they made it go into hidding. But I don't want it showing on my outfits and destroying some backpacks so I'll take that any day
---
And even if you leader or other teammates aren’t socializing with you please don’t leave, you still earn bond and get 4x xp which equals to 100% and you get xp for the double xp week so it’s a win, win for all 4 of you, you don’t have to follow them around you can do your own thing.
---
Wastelanders I believe. After the vault raid
---
Thank you I will try there ☺️
---
I have the same problem with him. He won't take the suitcase he asked me to retrieve. Keeps telling me to hush since he needs to concentrate smh Is there another ally that would help me rank up my settlers rep?
---
edit: I want to add im also on PS4 so maybe its a console prob?
---
I forgot that the PA I was running had cal shocks in them because I didn't make them, so I was used to an extra 100 already. I just need to get cal shocks in the excavator too.
---
yes
---
You have to have sided with raiders or foundation.... Soon as you have done the mission after that... You'll start getting treasury notes.
---
The mission explains what they are.
---
Same.  Guess I'm lucky no more.  Sucks!
---
Plus they absolutely shred enemies
---
Yep that's exactly what happened. Even logged out before the reset. Awesome lol
---
Thank you ☺️
---
Same same
---
There's a new shelf in one of the houses that was refurbished for WL with a really nice standing self unit that I'd love to see made into a CAMP display.  Believe it's in Morgantown and has a ton of books.  Encountered during the WL quest where you get schematics or something.
---
I wish I could get power armor up there I was going to buy t65 but it’s useless for me I can carry 600 with my armor and 575 with the only power armor that gives you a 100 carry weight. I would love to rock the x-01 or t65 but it isn’t in my plans
---
I totally forgot about the rollover and did not log out from private, surprisingly no daily was completed today.
---
Its literally a known issue.  
---
So no it dont work for you any better than anyone else.
---
Imagine if one of them wanted to tell you the code but policy states we must not know he watches
---
I also gotten this but it jumps back to my original when i enter the store, goes from 280 to my normal amount. Its ok tho not gamebreaking. It was only a visual for me
---
I’d like to know also got a zealots cryolator a while back.
---
Thank Yall for the info
---
Was it? I didn't get a message from the auto mods
---
Also I'd rather see people raising a stink about a giant issue than all the fing backpack posts we use to get
---
Ah, fair enough. Glad you got to the bottom of it!
---
I will get grinding them 🙌
---
dito, just after building up hemlock :/
---
I was just wondering about this when someone mentioned charging weapons. Thank you so much for testing this! You may have discovered something that will help a lot of players.
---
Awesome thanks to both of you!
---
They didn't fix it.  They don't know what's wrong yet so they're tracking it.  That's the message you saw.
---
You forgot this: “We also included a fix for the issue, which we enabled yesterday after reviewing information from that logging”
---
The point is that they’ve obviously made it worse.
---
I found the same one a few weeks ago...in the field next to Charleston RR station.  
---
Fixed the robot.  IIRC, she said thanks or similar, but there was no reward, etc.
---
I’m either in completely full servers or servers with 2-3 other people in them. I guess it’s just a hand grab of what they throw at you
---
Thanks for the answer
---
haha its funny because i dont give a shit about hockey but i like baseball a lot. just sucks we dont have a team here anymore. when covid is over im taking trip to ny or boston and watch a game for sure
---
And you gotta click the pie machine
---
Yea put on Bloody Mess and you turn an army of scorched into red mists simultaneously
---
That would actually be awesome
---
Last time I saw the insult bot, I killed it before it could even get a word out :)
---
I want to play but I'm afraid to log in lol
---
I don't give a fuck about doing the event I just want the XP from de mobs
---
I always bring my shishkebab and throw on friendly fire so I can heal the scavengers
---
Yeah, still do not want.
---
The event Line in the Sand is great for scorched, they should be fairly low level too
---
That's very important. I often don't even charge the Gauss rifle, but maybe the variability in how long  anyone clicks the fire button can act like a small charge time that throws VATS off.
---
An enemy spawning as legendary is RNG based. 
---
Enemies spawning as low level is because when you first load into a world it loads you as a lvl 1 and it takes a few seconds for your stats to load. Because of this enemies are triggers to spawn as soon as you load. Since you load as a lvl 1 a lot on first load it triggered low lvl enemies. 
---
To avoid this I make sure my character is in a low lvl area when I leave a public world so when I load into my private world it doesn’t really have a negative affect. Once you fast travel to a high lvl area enemies should spawn at your lvl since your characters information is already synced to the world. 
---
So to sum it up it usually only happens on the initial load into the world. Once in the world, fast traveling around should spawn enemies at your lvl when you’re roaming around the high lvl areas.
---
And you are missing the point where they said it addresses most but not all causes for the bug.
---
Reread what was posted for ITV, it says they included a fix for the issue.
---
Man I'm only level 36 or something last I played... I remember being level 19 and below and high level players were dropping stims, ammo, etc randomly for me. I was that person who initially tried to run off as my first experience with another player was they shot me dead at level 3 while I tried to buy supplies. Finding out they were not the norm was awesome. I now sell things super cheap for those just starting or will give what I can spare too. It was such an unexpected positive to an online game like this.
---
I'm usually grabbing or and trying to heal the npcs at the same time.  Frustrating as hell.
---
One more additional option, if you have a lot of scrap - just craft combat rifle and scrap it (lowest possible level).  
---
This way you will open new mods.  
---
According to the wiki  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The\_Fixer](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Fixer), combat rifle is base weapon for fixer, so all of the mods should apply to it also.  
---
If you will use this approach - make sure you have required perks for Scrapper and Gunsmith lvl 3.  
---
Also worth using chems to max INT (it also will give you more resources back)
---
On one right now :)
---
I down collect ore just because of rads, but do use my mic and ask if anyone has p.o or something to protect them from rad if they can will they collect ore
---
See, this is how you'd get that "you're a dick" emote. 🍆 Isn't that so much faster than typing it out?
---
Yep that's about the response I expected. Best of luck with those links I sent ya, hopefully they'll help!
---
Been discussed, given how the build cost works on your camp budget just realize each smaller piece would likely costs the same as a full piece does.  It would eat up budget faster, though I agree so many valuable uses. I would rather have the choice!  Lots of things to add on camp though, lots of threads on ideas and this is always on the list.
---
Not entirely.  
---
There is anti farming code in place so if you just run west tek again and again after a couple time none will spawn no matter how hard you try.
---
Well there is a challenge. You should get some atoms. You may need to win more than 1, I forget.
---
Fair enough-
---
Nope just a bit extra xp
---
Fighting a QSB and I gotta shit
---
Frequently when I fast travel the game says I have no ammo despite displaying ammo, but it also displays the wrong type of ammo. I have to switch guns and sometimes that doesn't work. On occasion after using my pipboy my gun just keeps firing until empty, manually reloading tends to fix that.
---
I feel seen by this comment. Thank you.
---
I never had this issue until today. So they’ve made it worse. I acknowledge that they also mentioned it wasn’t a full fix. This post is to encourage them to act more quickly. Being silent isn’t helpful.
---
I run bloody mess and a JE minigun, there's nothing more satisfying than deleting a hoard of ferals. (Yes its BoS T-60)
---
Sadly it is I'm right now doing my double exp without inspirational what's worse is in that nuke team there was a white knight who was head over heels gave her her number and everything been a tough few weeks
---
I normally enjoy BRs and wanted to play NW because i thought id witness some PvP and get some cool items to show off in adventure mode if i won. After 6 wins i realized i'm not getting anything for winning specifically so i stopped playing it lol.
---
For some reason I can’t open my pip boy in nuclear winter mode.
---
Aw bummer. I traded for this gun specifically to go up against those endgame bosses. Oh well
---
This bug and the bug where I couldn’t interact with quest objects in certain quests was the last straw for me honestly.
---
Absolutely amazing!!! 👏👏Bravo!👏👏
---
Haven’t done this event yet but I’ll try it tonight 🙏 thank you ☺️
---
It’s more worthwhile to farm the ghouls. Stop telling others how to play the game, if you don’t like they way they do the event then just stop doing it
---
Literally niceness goes a long way, especially for me and people alike. When a low level contest my workshop, I let them take it, and talk to them its not cool, and it enable PvP, i could shoot you easily etc. Or even people just ask, and i leave the workshop, for a daily challenge or Score etc. Just be nice. Just ask. I set up some workshops and leave everything unlocked for whomever needs.
---
This. Even without the event there’s lots of combat rifles in and around Fort Defiance, some are just static spawns so you even need to kill anything.
---
Made it worse for you, but on a macro level there seem to be less instances of it... at least less people complaining on Reddit.
---
And I agree, submit a ticket. Contact community managers.
---
You can look at the wiki.
---
No probs!
---
Wow ... well, that make sense since I set up my tent right outside west tek and tried the private world thing from there.
---
Thanks a lot! I'll try that asap.
---
Edit : I hopped in a private server while being in front of vault 76, travelled to my tent and it worked! I mostly get lvl 50-60 ones but I guess I'm just not high level enough yet for them to all be 68.
---
Thank you for your help! Had a hard time to reach my scrip limit so it's gonna help a ton.
---
That rough! Sorry that happened.
---
I had this event glitch on me as well.
---
I died with two pylons on me, my team finished the 'squatch off.  It wouldn't let me respawn or be revived.  So, I finally beat that event and couldn't get my reward.
---
I had to exit.  When I got back in I couldn't find the body to loot.  I haven't tried it again since.
---
True. I don’t suggest just server hopping one place on a private server. I usually plan a route that will take me about 30-40 minutes to complete. So once complete leave and load back in. That way each area can run it’s cool down timer like it would on a public world. Doing this I can usually use a private server for hours and always have stuff spawn at each area as I make my rounds.
---
Appreciate the support.
---
He’s the type of player that comments on a fallout 76 advertisement and says how terrible it is and no one plays it.
---
punk and gramps hang out at crater and foundation. 
---
And the wanderer wanders
---
Lol I really cannt wait for this phone to die.....that's funny
---
Those big concrete defense walls are also budget killers. I built a memorial once that needed them and was shocked by how much budget they each ate up.
---
I feel this way about everything i do in any video game. Took a long time to get the weapons i wanted,  and everything else but now that ive gotten everything i wanted, i have nothing to do. When a new fallout comes out, this will all have been for nothing. But i still love to play the game
---
Nothing worse than rolling 2 or 3 3* heavy guns and being maxed out on scrio for the day &gt;:(
---
There's a ally in creater and foundation. There's also a random ally you can find in several spot around the map, she is quite hard to find though
---
Google fallout76 settler wanderer
---
i was thinking the same thing and wondering if this is why i haven't been seeing them for sale much lately.
---
I did feed the people yesterday and the food canisters would disappear in front of me. We almost couldn't find enough to start the machine
---
Might want to just delete and repost this with the proper spelling, lol     
---
*Allowed
---
As an added bonus there's a weapon workbench inside of FD too. Plus the more people join, the more spawns you'll get
---
They ripped me off. I got the a bed from the Atomic Shop and they must have removed it so I can no longer place it. Thanks Bethesda Love getting ripped off...
---
That and I'm constantly going around buying them up lol
---
No was on purpose actually
---
Don’t nerf my nut.
---
Dude cola nut is a perk card, it can’t be loud!
---
I dig the zoo part not too sure about the whole fire trap thing.
---
Yup. I’ve got a Troubleshooter’s version with that and it’s even bette than my Instigating one, even against non-robots.
---
Dont nerf my armor
---
This is what happened to me but the high level killed me cause I had a bounty he stole all my junk I had a bunch of bulk screws on me cause I bought them off of a trader for like 987 caps and there goes all my caps😡
---
Those staircase pieces are just a nightmare. It is really difficult to understand why the building system regarding stairs/ second floors are so much worse than what is in fo4 - both in how well they actually work and what you can do with them.
---
Interesting. My tests all included a friend as well and none of the damage numbers from consecutive shots ever varied at all for either of us. Very weird.
---
Thank god someone got the joke there
---
That’s a beautiful combination 👍
---
Scortched in top of world
---
maybe because you need to find the nuka colas in the wild to benefit from it, while white night was constant due to you having armor.
---
You get the writer inside Foundation, near the water.  He'll be leaning against a railing.
---
Raider punk is another one.  I found him at raider camp.  I sided with Crater so I think that has something to do with it.
---
There is one more I know of but I don't know where to find her.  She roams around.
---
Dang, i'm a newbie and i really hate how there is no text chat, sometimes there are things that you can't express in emotes.
---
I'll always find it off how many hoops were jumped through to prevent us playing the game. Especially compared to the plodding way other areas are tended to that would actually be helpful.
---
Wait. You are on your Main 255 but never experienced a 2x XP Event. How did that happen?
---
The top of seneca rocks
---
Are you new? Like seriously finding cola is easy.
---
Happened to me too. So pissed.
---
There are trophies and statues as you progress in ranks though.  Winning a match isn't all that amazing for people with premade squads after all.
---
Yup. Got him yesterday. He's sitting on the floor watching TV bein' all cute and stuff.
---
Didn't read all the responses, but this is a know issue.  Post nuke logout and log back in and all the enemies respawn.  You have about 5 minutes to get back into your private world.  Once you kill everything rinse and repeat.  Your nuke zone will keep repopulating for at least an hour.  
---
On a side note, if you have a friend join you world, you can skip the first logout if they log in after the nuke drops. 
---
When my team does it, we run a full team and everyone takes a turn leaving/joining the team.  We also don't nuke whitesprings since Morgantown has way more mobs.  If you do Morgantown, just make sure you get the town, airport and as much of the railyard in the zone as possible.
---
? Which bed?
---
Put on the patriot liberty prime skin, a jet pack, get one of those hacked mininuke miniguns, and become an A-10.
---
Hi how are you
---
For real. Stairs were far far better in 4, I made some dope places in Hangman's Alley
---
I don’t recall reading they fixed it. I read they implemented something to aid them in finding the cause so they can fix it.
---
Yeah, I suppose that does make sense about the budget but yes - would like the choice. I hate having a disharmonious build when I’m using a skinned floor, and the bam - no skinned, janky wooden half planks because I wanted a slightly different sized room.
---
End game gear should not be tradable.  It never is. 
---
This your first MMO?
---
No sense in beating a dead horse. Down voting you for not caring until it affected you is kinda funny imo.
---

You are def 10 ply my dude
---
Did a Guided Meditation where only two ghouls attacked a speaker. After it ended, found like a dozen just standing around.
---
I think the DR on my heavy metal armor is fine, but its RR could stand a bump.
---
I can easily go toe to toe with an L62 charred ghoul on straight damage (335 dr metal armor), but if I take 2 hits, the rad damage takes 80-90% of my health bar. If I take a 3rd hit, I'm dead
---
It’s an animated game. We are playing with cartoons. That is all.
---
When you say its op explains? I just got cola nut and if its worth it im ON IT
---
Who said I haven’t cared? It’s not a dead horse. They need feedback to act on. Take your assumptions elsewhere.
---
I just came back to the game a week ago and haven't played in a year. I still haven't placed a vendor because I want to move my camp to a better spot.  My character is lvl 159 not high level but in the realm and you're right not everyone has a vendor out.
---
What?
---
Oh gotcha. I say toon cuz it's easier to type haha
---
all prefab should be able to be snapped to foundation
---
It's a glitch that people can place it. Unsure if you can get rid of it
---
Good question, heck I dont even remember but avatar, character, toon goes back to the early MMO days.like ultima online
---
I noticed this too. I was doing Collision Course and some high lvl player was crouched and cloaked one shotting EVERY scorched that spawned. I gave up trying to tag them before he killed them and just had my character sit on a chair by the crashed plane and went a made a sandwich.
---
It was a common name for character alts on WoW. That’s probably where. Could’ve originated in another game but everyone called alts toons on WoW. I never picked it up and stick with alts lol.
---
As on option - search for behemoth location (somewhere top left corner near foundation, google exact location)
---
Put your camp there and turrets, agro him, so the turrets could kill him, you will get a lot of xp, scraps and 20-50 caps.
---
Just server hop and farm him.
---
Another - whitespring golf club, but I haven't farmed there, just saw that people are farming at specific spot near window, so mobs can't reach you and there are TONS of them.
---
Yeah im getting over 200% xp its insane
---
Dude, I wish I knew what y’all are talking about, I’ve been playing throughout and it hasn’t happened to me yet
---
Looks like a salty level 300 with a glitch weapon downvoted you haha

In case someone needs/wants their information updated/accurate.
---
Patience, please. They're working on it. It takes time.
---
THIS is a creative trapcamp =)
---
There are no T60 nor gatlin laser in NW. If you play on PC, its a cheater (you should see the ones with gatlin mini nukes 😂), but PA usually spawns at the same points
---
Me all the time now. Time to show this pea soup can who's the boss!
---
Actually, I don't think that it's because of the double-XP event.  I think that it's because one of the challenges for the seasons board such as kill x number of creatures/enemies in a group, complete X events, etc.  
---
The easiest way to do this is to jump into every event on the board to finish it off.  So, I'm thinking that it's the daily and weekly challenges that is causing the different behaviour, especially for high-levels.
---
So basically you can out heal any damage in the game just by chugging a few now to max out on those effects you wanna get like quantum, grapes, and oranges
---
How does anyone get anything in battle royals,
---
Luck
---
It's all algorithm based, doing these searches most likely adds more to your profile they have on you. Once you start to build your search profile up it categorizes then most likely produces a threat result or some sort of identifier to then ping an actual person. Said person gets a report of you and why you were pinged to look at.
---
I run for ore, but I have an automatic tesla and I just run and spray and tag as many enemies as I can as I cycle through the 4 tunnels. Get XP left and right, but still collect the ore and progress the event.
---
Are you wearing then high capacity backpack?
---
Correct. They said they were having difficulty logging the events, likely because it is not occurring consistently. They added a log to track when exactly it occurs to track down the issue.
---
That is where I heard it first in my U.O. days.. I had much fun playing that ol game
---
Omg god mode legally? You have opened my eyes.... I must farm cola.....
---
As I read the last ITV there was a fix.
---
This all the way. When it's just me and an obvious pre grouped squad of people likely on voice who probably all have the best perks and gear at the end I just run into the fire so they get one less kill. I can't beat them as a solo player but I can at least not help them anymore lol. And it doesn't even matter to me XP wise, you still get a lot just for surviving that long and placing so high.
---
They’ve had feedback for months. 3 weeks into the season and still can’t figure it out.
---
I'm just shy of lvl 46
---
So you could always farm up a bunch of cranberries. Make cran relish or cran pie for XP buffs. Jump severs until you see popular events and just use a cheap ammo high capacity pipe rifle and tag every mob you see and let higher levels kill them.
---
I wish the other teams were more useful...
---
Yeah I always log out at least 10 mins before and wait till 5 past to log back in. To be sure. Have been ok so far, but it’s happened to me before when I’ve been in the middle of a NW match and forgot what time it is.
---
&gt;chance to hit absolute
---
Citation needed. This is absolutely not my experience with explosive / plasma / bow weapons.
---
Foundation and that spawn are in like the middle bottom of the map. Not the top right
---
Main quest can be a good way to level too, if you have a friend that can help fast travel to or from locations. That’s the biggest time suck.
---
Crap :(
---
You can get one from the White spring cola guy and id hop around train stations you'll find a few that way
---
Ibthink events team only works with public events too. So even more useless, especially as nobody on my events team ever seems to join me on events!
---
OP is so right! Its very strange. Even People Who dont do event are in event teams, its very strange
---
Would be nice if we could actually see how much each item takes up in a budget.  
---
Also, wallpaper on ceilings?  I want those glow in the dark stickers to shine
---
Consider yourself lucky :)
---
Only time I'd use Int. boost is for doing daily quests, I guess.
---
He did receive that one on Tuesday. But he got that response yesterday
---
We also included a fix for the issue, which we enabled yesterday after reviewing information from that logging. Our data show that this fix has addressed the vast majority of instances of this bug, and we are pursuing a more complete fix in the next few days.
---
Why do you need to remove it?
---
It's on its way down too.
---
Here's the thing though.
---
You can kill the ghouls AND do the objective.
---
I'm on the othet boat. I suck balls at battle royale and I am glad rewards are xp based not victory based
---
Agreed. Three events teams last night so I started a building team; took a while before anyone started joining. Ran a couple of events with my building team and didn’t see any of the other teams bother with them.
---
Ok. Hot damn how did i just get to 100 not knowing so much hahaa
---
I’ve run max nut for a long time. Always carrying 4-12 colas, most Nuka and cherry since that’s what you find in the wild.   I’ll do quantum’s, but usually I just sell them.
---
And no where near where it should be.
---
Cant get rid of it unless you move your camp
---
It wont get you in trouble or anything, no camp exploits will
---
I don't understand it and don't use it either. Strangely enough, it wasn't really a thing here when Fo76 started.
---
Also there are people who trade them in bulk to
---
It says they implemented something but it’s not 100% fixed yet.
---
I lost 4 challenges and 100% did not get the score for them.
---
Because its exploiting a bug and bethesda likes to ban people who do this stuff.
---
Just east of Top Of The World are two lakes. The first is right by the road outside the station, and the second a little further past, but has 3 naturally spawning Brahmin there.
---
Both are great for farming purified water for selling, the Brahmin for obvious meat and leather source, and both are great for farming.
---
As a bonus, they hardly get attacked, and it's a maximum of 1 cap to fast travel to the station.
---
Also very central too.
---
Please don't build by the Brahmin one, otherwise I won't ever get to meet you, because I live there. 😅
---
I usually start at west tek (outside and inside) then the wendigo cave and finish with whitespring ... haven't looked much for other places and I'm not even sure if the wendigo cave is a good place for legendaries but it's decent for some xp and meat down there so it's fine by me.
---
Always messing up with left/right sides, lol  
---
I meant comparing to foundation location it is somewhere top left, again - I don't remember exact location
---
It is in the entrance of my camp
---
Maybe because they're not getting the score? nah... couldn't be that.
---
I laughed way too hard on that one.
---
I hit it last night and just squeaked into the one past. You're fine.
---
Could’ve sworn the tents were in the thumbnail photo when I purchased it
---
Lol I hope you got the reference
---
Exactly it was only recently that I saw it being used here and was confused
---
We have the Public Team system and you're still inviting random players to join a Private Team? Or did you place it yourself not realising you can't get rid of it?
---
 "I don’t wear armor or power armor because it’s cumbersome 
---
...
---
 I kept getting killed "
---
If only there was some sort of connection here.
---
I believe it's hits not damage, but I could be wrong. Friendly fire works that way and I don't really notice a difference in freezing the queen whether I'm using my heavy gun perks or not. With the crystalized barrel it take one clip (25 shots) to slow her and one more clip to freeze her.
---
It was an accidental invite that I sent to some random player that I was next to instead of my friend
---
lol that’s a pretty accurate picture
---
I only have 4 dailys today.😢
---
Harpers Ferry, The Burrows, Charleston Capital Building, Fissure sites in the bog, and Glassed Cavern I add on top of West Tek for my runs.
---
Edit: And Hunterville
---
I’m really curious if the scout ghillie can be applied to thorn armor, and if the thorn branches clip through. Thinking that would be pretty cool.
---
I found it too.  Only to accidentally shoot it after fixing it.  She didn’t even react.  
---
That’s what I miss about Fallout 4 and before: AI would react to your actions.  Especially true with stealing or something else.  Now it only occurs in certain quest dialogues where you insult someone and they attack
---
And the tesla ash piles... I hate when my brother uses a Tesla. When he busts that fucker out, I try to stick close so I can loot them right away
---
i was doing guided meditation with a friend to level him up and not a single ghoul spawned, sometimes i just hate this game but i never leave
---
Interesting, did he make a ticket?
---
Same! But 2 at 30 each.
---
Yup, all from the atom shop
---
When you nuke the barrows, all the ghouls turn into glowing bloated ones, and you don't need rad gear under there. If you spend the time and cruise the whole place, you can usually get around 30 ghouls and several legendaries per run.
---
Upvote because I want to see PA with crazy backpack like brahmin or treasure mole miner.  Let it add 200lbs so I can fast travel in PA.  Would gladly give up my torso mod for this.
---
Yeah it really sucks :( happened to me too. Also submited a ticket
---
If you mean the purple, pink, green, orange, etc.
---
Then yes, they were a bundle exclusive. Might cycle back through again.
---
lmao they don't ban people for having stuff built in their camp.
---
The real question is how'd you get that far into the legendary run
---
Ya, I feel like NPCs have been fully baked into the game quite yet.
---
Well no one can delete stuff at your camp other than you.
---
I'm not really a huge P.A users so I couldn't really tell you the difference. I mainly got it to complete my P.A collection haha
---
Hell im a dick and I dont care. I hit level 333 yesterday because I'm trying to rush my score repeatable because I'm currently 15 levels behind where I should be because I've been busy at work.
---
The only things I will let players tag is legendary enemies. Everything else will die when I punch it and if you can't get a single shot in before im in melee range that's too bad.
---
Because my stash is full with 300.
---
Not just me then.  What a strange random encounter.  Ironically, it's strange because it's seemingly one of the most normal things you find in the game.
---
This happens often on ps4. Seeing 4 event teams but none of them are at any events on the map(unless all of them are allways sneaking). They dont join line in the sand or any of the good events. Its strange
---
This happened A LOT during the Fasnacht event.
---
I don't know why some people feel the need to bring God Tier weapons to these group events, it's not like you gain any extra rewards by killing it faster. The only thing you're doing is screwing everyone else out of a legendary.
---
I always kept an eye out for anyone who made the made emote at the Fashchnat event after we downed the legendary and just gave them the legendary I got. I can farm legendaries easier than a low level can, no skin off my nose.
---
Upvoted for your use of "can confirm"!
---
Yes.  
---
Did I overlook/forget a -RR for the high cap backpack?
---
it drive me bonkers i have to walkaround like a tourist wit ha camera looking for the bodies of dead guys t oget my loot. and i HATE how the game will place a corpse in diffrent locations depending on each system. me and my wife play side by side. and well kill a legendary monster. and the bodies will be in different locations sometimes.  once took me 30 minutes to find the corpse in encepid cause hers was by a tree mine was underwater.
---
Solomon's pond I believe, North of foundation a bit, maybe slightly to the left lol
---
I have no unyielding armor but using 4 lunchboxes and the double xp weekend I leveled up from ~145 to 173 in a few hours. 1200 xp per level 68 super mutant lmao
---
I believe this is the correct answer. If you can't remove it normally, then you will have to move your camp and delete it from the auto blueprint and then from your stored tab.
---
OMG, I think this is one of the best user created videos I have ever seen. That was hilarious, after the floor falls out....pan to the gorillas face, Classic. Very very well-made video man.
---
This is whyI run solo and avoid events during XP weekends. Ihave 2 hours a night max to play. And i reallly want to hit lvl 300 before patch 22. Having limited time and trying to  go from lvl 220- 300 by the time legendary perks happen. If i join a public event ill end up being an XP whore and killing everything. Dont wanna be that guy, so solo repeat grind it is....
---
Non xp weekends i try to be curtious to all other players.
---
 So my routine is:
---
Stick my tent near the behemoth by twin lakes. Put on inspirational,  join a public buIlding team, open a lunchbox, eat canned meat, equip a set of unyielding (not a bloodied build) ,RAD up if im not already and off i go.
---
Start off by killing the behomth for 2k xp+, than fast travel to huntersville kill all the muties there, and fallow the road to westek, kill thosse muties, than on to national sat array and clear that. Scrap the weapons at the bench there and server hop. Lvl 68 muties give me 500-800 xp depending on buffs and shared perks lvl 48 (or whatever they are) give me 350-500 depending on buffs. 
---
Played 2 hours lastnight and went from 220-225 lastnight, was pretty happy about that. This also included time to turn in scrip, dailys, and roll 3 peices of SS armor. I have a beautiful SS set for my junkies setup,  but want a few unyielding peices,  kicking myself for scripping them now.
---
Hmmm I thought it looked empty based on the fact that there weren’t very many people on the map. Vendors I don’t really pay attention to I pay attention to the dots representing players because I usually want to do an event while it’s populated
---
Goes back to the first gen MMOs like Ultima online, the realm, Everquest, and Asheron’s call.  I think it’s used just because it’s easier to type than character, and saying alt or mule has negative connotations.
---
I’ve got 5 fully developed characters in this game (as I do for most games I play a long time), actually there you go I just instinctively typed character, in spite of using toon for about 20 years.  I’m cured!!
---
Did the same at Line in the sand this morning. Noone placed their tent, but there was a good few people camping on top of the cliff opposite the asylum so that when the scorched spawned at the gates people were going through them. Just stood there and got the reward for the event.
---
At this point i am not even mad anymore i just log in to see what is the next thing Bugthesda broke and what the fanboys will come up to justify their emotional attachment to this shitty company.
---
Apparently today instead of the promised 9 challenges we get 8 and 4 are auto-completing for a lot of people and the fanboys says it is still the player fault for not waiting long enough to log back in. Or whatever crap they came up for the last 3 weeks.
---
I love to watch a dumpster fire.
---
This. If you also want to remove your vendors from players that happen to stumble across your camp, put them behind a powered door on the same electrical line as the machines.  One wire and vendors are gone.*
---
* Players with intent and glitching may still break in, but they are rare.
---
Build the solid community and rebuild the post apocalyptic world one noob at a time lol
---
Sorry for the late reply or reopening the tread place it on a carpet then you can move it too foundations
---
Is the crystalized barrel the best mod for this?
---
So if you are pumping out 500 5.56 rounds per minute why would they not ban you? Its a machine that's not supposed to be anywhere besides the munition workshop.
---
I play on xbox, and I've found that aiming slightly under the target usually yields a better hit chance with the gr. Having VATS pull your crosshair up slightly makes hitting more consistent, even with flying targets. Additionally, **not** fully charging a shot helps to land more hits, especially against stuff that's closer to you.
---
Click bait
---
that really rustles my jimmies
---
Flux is lost when you die. It's been that way for a while now.
---
Head to the Wayward.
---
Still at a lost trust me 
---
That event and line in the sand are major exp farm lots of exp
---
And reason why it is because you have to kill the non-stop mobs
---
Thank you!  I hope they do.  I dig 'em.
---
Maybe I’m crazy but I’ve been noticing the same type of typo ALL over reddit as of three days ago. A lot of “DonalDonald Trump does this...”, or “CybeCyberpunk has this...” like typos. I thought it was a reddit mobile glitch of some sort but now that you’ve pointed it I know it’s real.
---
In my opinion because it allows you to shoot from a distance. Without you have to be really close like a flamer. I also recommend the stock that helps with recoil.
---
Exactly my experience
---
everyone quick take off your clothes
---
I didn't read your post , just the title. Some guys have all the luck ;)
---
This is true
---
I have a punji trap in font of my newbee vendor, free ammo, food, srim packs, etc... Any one over lvl 25 who takes from it dies. Sadly, it happens a lot. A lvl 256 was emptying it machine and then pisses his pants when he died. Greed kills folks.
---
Chat . this game needs in game chat to actually resolve those issue's
---
Their ToS is teeny tiny tho
---
Or so lumpy you cant really do anything
---
Why can’t there be a strength team 😭
---
I used to go to harpers ferry for optical fibers since there's 3 turrets there ... will give those places a shot, thanks a lot!
---
Fighting Queen Shirley Bassey? Who do you think you are, Diana Ross?
---
Ah gotcha. I figured it was the one that you get from the raiders at max rep.
---
But no, they still won't ban you. Also the munitions workshop doesn't spit out 500 5.56 per minute.
---
Just ask for a refund
---
Maybe Enclave events should be free for enclave members to teleport to as I don’t usually go to them unless I’m close by. That’s pretty much why I haven’t done one in ages
---
🎤"Oh im hacking nuclear codes and you dont want me too"  🎤
---
You're a lifesaver.
---
I dont think you got the same bug as people are complaining about.
---
They log in after dailys have reset and there challnlenges are already ticked as completed.
---
I mainly used it to see which mods would help for a zero vats gun. Zero ap cost per vats shot. It's bomb diggity. But I also like to lower the vats cost on weapons that don't have ap cost reduction legendary, or that can't be zero vats.
---
I thought the stairs would snap onto that if the garage door is put on a floor. I think I had that at one point.
---
About to be there in in  a few days lol.
---
I bought that bundle, and the tents now appear in 1st as that is where you pick one, like your icon, to show/use in game.  On my other account where I also did first I didn’t buy the bundle and they don’t show up.  So you got them.
---
Shit man, that’s a pretty silly reason to break up, probably better off without 👍🏻
---
I see him pretty consistently when I claim the golf course workshop up north in the toxic valley
---
I’ve also had a bug where the jet pack doesn’t show when I’m in normal armor and I have to un equip it and put it back on and it shows
---
There's just no way you'll ever reliably track him down. The best you can do is listen for the sounds and chatter he makes while he's walking around. You can hear him before you see him. I've found him in front of Foundation more times than anywhere else, but that's just my luck and not really anything you can count on. All I can say is thank god he finally had the radiation emitter because even now I still have never gotten the plans for the rad barrel or even seen them being sold.
---
There are a couple of ways. 
---
Joining events higher than your level and tagging everything is one good way to start.  It's even better if you can join a public group, especially the queen, as you can loot the spawns that are killed by your teammates as long as you are close enough to them.  Plus there are XP buffs for being on a team.  Don't worry about dying or using Stimpacks.  The purpose is to gain XP, not survive.  And don't loot until the end.
---
SunnyTop ski lanes running course for Tadpoles is repeatable.  800 XP per run at level 9 intelligence and well-rested.  Takes about 1.5 minutes per run at 6 Agility.  Cranberry Relish and other buffs can increase how much XP you get.  If you are a fallout 1st member just plunk your tent down at the top of the hill for a free ride back to the top.
---
There are other methods but you need Power Armour and good weapons or one or more high levels with you.  Look up glass caverns and ultracite.  Also look up swimming and Spruce Knob.
---
From my experience, I've noticed the more times that I hit the creature the more it will slow down so the effect seems to stack upon itself. There is a Slight delay for the debuff to take effect and the projectiles tend to travel slower than other ammo types. I'm not sure, however, if legendary effects increase the potency beyond more damage aside from secondary effects being noticeable such as limb damage and faster fire rate.
---
Thats true. At least let us enter the vault without time pressure to examine it and to understand the lore.
---
And additonally they should get rid of the overseer rank restrictions of tapes, notes and terminal entries...
---
Cheater
---
By the time they put it back, you don’t need it any more. This is how the atom shop’s fake scarcity (doesn’t) work.
---
Rarely see him anymore either since wastelanders.  The 2 times I have seen him he has been stuck in the drainage ditch outside of foundation (under the bridge you spawn in front of when fast traveling).  Worst case scenario meat weak is coming up soon and you will be able to find him for sure then.
---
At this point I'm not even sure how many points (atom and score) I've lost lol
---
NW really was never about killing or pvp it’s really just another survival game. Honestly I wouldn’t be shocked if we eventually heard tales of an entire server teaming up to fight the extra crispy scorchbeast and just surviving for as long as possible in the firestorm
---
That is so incredibly frustrating.
---
Yeah unfortunately there is no set spawn point for him. They have guides on YouTube of the routes he takes but running around trying to find him would get old. Wish he would be at one location like a main shop every hour or something.
---
Just wander really.   Some quests point you around. But explore every building and map POI you can. 
---
My advise is if high level people try and give you a bunch of stuff dont take it.  
---
Its WAY funner in the early game scrounging around to survive this is fallout after all.
---
&gt;Update: downvoting this is a major attack against the health of the game. What are you doing?
---
This is actually hilarious and kind of exposes a really fucked up mentality behind your post OP.
---
Anyways as it says they fixed "a vast majority" of the occurrences. This is how bugfixing generally works: fixing a single thing might not fix every single thing that causes the bad thing and it doesn't fix anything forever.
---
Not even trying to side with Bethesda here, just trying to point out how far off you are with understanding bug fixing and also thinking that this post has some importance considering, again, how it's premise and conclusion are both completely missing the mark, and then thinking that people who are downvoting you are somehow hurting the game like this post is important and it's factually wrong to downvote...
---
Anyways, in summary, bad job here OP.
---
You don’t get xp on top of every kill though... just for completing the event...
---
Frankly, hunting should just give extra meat/plants, and exploration should give extra health/ap instead of their current forms.
---
The others are fine, since casual is for, well, casual play and extra luck can never hurt, role play will become useful when the next big story content drops, and of course events and building are fine (though maybe building could use a better name, perhaps).
---
I wouldn’t mind a carry weight up team, though. Or a rifle weight down perk card...
---
&gt;so I'm chiming in with everyone else that had it way worse than me.
---
That kinda sounds like you only became a supporter of a fix when the problem affected you, because you refused to speak up before then. And as another user mentioned, they've known since this was an issue. Many tickets submitted, many, many, many posts on forums and videos. They likely don't know how to fix the issue otherwise they'd have done so. Bethesda games historically have been riddled with bugs, hell Fallout 4 saves would get deleted for the first few months after release.
---
All that burnt asbestos is gonna give someone mesothelioma.
---
Lol you're cringe get your trap base ass out of here
---
I didn’t even think of this as I wasn’t playing during this event.. will he have his normal inventory chances? I just need the mirror ball.
---
Actuall fuckin cuck
---
Thanks for the support
---
Those are some good suggestions that fit the description perfectly!
---
Maybe I am. Maybe that’s what I do.
---
Isnt their a perk in nw that speeds up melee swings
---
Are you using explosives or something that would lead you into explosions a lot? I love fireproof for my characters that use explosive weapons, but not sure how useful it is for an unarmed build. Maybe something like the one with added benefits from being well fed and hydrated for bonus AP? 
---
Also it never hurts to put the extra point in INT and makeshift warrior.
---
I think Phoenix in watoga has the connectors
---
It's like I said in my previous comment, if the daily play or the score dailies are getting to you and you don't enjoy their content, don't play, send them a message. The legendary run is cosmetic, you don't NEED it. That's the same message people would say in wow and other MMOs, if you're not enjoying the game, why are you playing it or subbed to it?????
---
I’m trying to at least grab double XP while I travel around looking for him but it’s been so boring.
---
I guess he’s taking a rest since there’s a BBQ coming up in the next few weeks
---
We need the ability to fast travel in this one!
---
Tag faster bruh, no better way to deal with dicks. They aren’t supposed to be faster than you just because their level is higher.
---
the locations i have seen him the most since day one is near sunshine meadows workshop. In the first few months i only saw him maybe 3 times. Then i made a new character and i used to capture the workshop there and billings farm and i saw him more in 2 days than i did in 2 months. Plus other times i've seen him around there.
---
So mutfruit corn razorgrain etc are apl hard to come by aparently  according to your logic
---
I've seen Feed the People, but it just seems like the recurrence of events is low.
---
I saw a feed the people right before I got off yesterday
---
The only event I've noticed never show up is the Enclave event in Clarksburg
---
The 76 community is fascinating for many reasons, one of them being a near- pathological need to post FB and Reddit screeds about even the most minor of inconveniences from other players.
---
This ^^^^
---
I've only had to use it a couple times but it works like a charm. 
---
Most ppl dont memorize usernames so you guys could even end up being friends down the road and never know it lol
---
Theres a camp sized flat field at the whitesprings golf course. Roughly where the snake icon is on the map
---
its a old school WoW term. and is faster and easy to type
---
Yeah farming events for XP is pretty much a bust during double XP.      Glassed caverns, west tek, charleston capital building are good spots to farm XP.   Hell virtually any fast travel point has enemies and can be farmed for XP.  And if your character is very low level and hasn't unlocked many locations for fast travel points, then simply finding new locations will grant you double XP.
---
You should collect like 90ish ore then keep last few ore in inventory THEN farm ghouls till timer almost up.
---
how can i get a refund?
---
I have a furious Gatling laser and the numbers definitely increase after so many hits. Want to say it goes up about 12 points per shot at the max. Wonder if it’s weapon specific?
---
But like that’s the issue though, I bought the bundle but they aren’t appearing in the 1st tab. Like tents aren’t even a section there so do I reinstall the DLC again?
---
I reaply dont give a fuck what people think of me,  hell im the type to nuke vendors with really stupid prices because i have the time and resources to
---
Yeah, he will have his normal inventory.  May still take some server hopping or a private server in case someone else bought what you were looking for, but at least you know exactly where to find him for a straight week!
---
A proper cover system would be nice. I don't understand why it's not in every game.
---
Fireproof is for scorchbeasts, rocket launcher supermutants, exploding robots and cars. And since almost everything dies in one hits, makeshift warrior 2 is more than enough for me.
---
Who said I refused to speak? Wild assumption. I’m just reporting what has happened now. Being silent isn’t helpful.

The Red Rocket Bed, Also an outfit called mountain scout says I own it in the store but it is entirely blank. No idea why I got downvoted for that comment though
---
The absolute last level is 3400 score. That's what? Two days of dailies or two or so weekly challenges? Going from what you want, a level a day, two days for the last level doesn't seem that hard......
---
Seen them all pop up today
---
He has his normal inventory during the event.
---
So I still have plenty of time! I’m at 19 now!
---
They are working on banning tens of thousands of accounts... they will be busy till 2022 🤣
---
They've gained 1.5 million since last year. So no, they aren't going down
---
&gt;A succesfulll vats "roll" on anything will make the chance to hit absolute
---
That's a better citation if you take it whole, and it seems it's on PC side to my current knowledge.
---
lol double xp salty tears. mmmmmm
---
The gun fights are fun. The explosive fights are not.
---
It's not the stims that bother me.  It's the Level 10 Two Shot Exploding Handmade. That needs to be in the hands of a lowbie, not being carted off to Mamma Mumbles Incinerator.
---
You not seeing the issue is why BGS gets away with so much shit.
---
"Our data show that this fix has addressed the vast majority of instances of this bug, and we are pursuing a more complete fix in the next few days."
---
Their words. Sounds like there's a few reasons this is happening. How they define vast majority is unknown.
---
I have done a few simple rules to make sure it doesn't happen to me. So far it's worked 100%
---
Don't log in until at least 30 mins after reset (1230est)
---
Do not check anything until you enter a public adventure server (don't check the atom store the Legendary board etc).
---
Do the NW daily challenge dead last.
---
After playing a session log back into adventure mode before quiting (don't quit the game in NW and have the game reset challenges. Some said this could be an issue).
---
This all could be superstitious acts but at this point I'm afraid to break my routine and suffer the consequences. 
---
Sorry this is happening to you and others.
---
Lmao whats your score at? Thats nuts
---
Then you won’t “give a fuck” when I say you can’t type worth a shit either.
---
I’ve never thought about checking that. I’m gonna start doing that when I think a vet is acting like a noob
---
The stretched scorched/doggoheads.
---
Why does it matter that he said that? Down voting a post THATS popular and needs to be more noticed by Bethesda is hurting the community. Why would someone speak up about a problem that’s not theirs and they have no experience with it? People who have issues come here to express them so Bethesda and others notice and agree. Gtfo dude
---
This is true, 33 on shotgun will pretty much instakill stuff due to bugged magic shotgun effects. However, twoshot only adds 1 more pellet to shotguns and not like you are shooting two "slugs".
---
I join what available. On my main, I prefer event teams because, between events, I’m mostly afk waiting for another event. (Which is also why is get royally pissed when no one else shows up to events)
---
My second character is working on finishing up the main quests. I prefer building for him.
---
Found him yesterday at White springs train station
---
Another person that takes photos in excavator armour respect
---
Thanks!! I took a lot of gorilla closeups haha
---
'in retrospect lighting the match was not a good idea' kind of moment there
---
She just served herself up on a platter.
---
Valid point, thank you for pointing that out. Besides the point nonetheless.
---
Yea that's what happened to me today but it still gave me the score. There was like a 2 3 min delay but it showed up
---
Do you have the head?
---
You're wrong. Any player that's good with guns is better with and explosive build.
---
It shouldn't be so surprising especially after this long. The rare rewards aren't rare or valuable anymore (saw a rad barrel plan in a vendor for 10k last night, used to go for 30-60) so why cut off the flow of free massive amounts of XP and legendary farm for a chance at a rad barrel (but more likely 5 missiles). 
---
Also ore running lame as hell. At best you use 20-30 radaway/radx and lose out on the xp/legendary farm. 
---
It was fun at first, but much like many other game features its not super well thought out.
---
Lemme guess said level 300 was low on health? Not surprising tbh since bloodied builds literally 1 shot anything
---
I have only 8 dailies today. Everyone else has 9 or also 8?
---
Good advice
---
I think they made the video honestly. I cracked up every time u went to one of their mugshots. 👏🏼👏🏼
---
I like you out of rage you gave a full set of good armor
---
There was/is a glitch (may have been fixed) where all wallpapers were unlocked recently.
---
Look me up. Mr Grumpypantz
---
Yeah I forgot to mention that as well. There are 8 today. There should be 9. More head scratching to do.
---
These are so cool
---
You get way more than 30 in those places I mentioned but yeah you don't need rad gear in the Burrows, you're right
---
Good advice! Unfortunately I feel like a lot of players don't necessarily use reddit or online guides when playing. 
---
The issue is that the game never really clearly states that intelligence increases XP. That and the fact that the team name of "Building" sounds like it is for Workshops/CAMP Buffs. While "Event" on the other hand is clearly labled as a team for events.
---
But holy moly man, full bond building team and double XP is INSANE! I'm talking before you even add stuff like lunchboxes, perks, mutations. I level like crazy lol
---
time for simulation stimulation
---
Foundation is a consistent spot, also he joined us at line in the sand a couple of nights ago.
---
I always open it up for people to grab their junk and there is always stash boxes everywhere :)
---
These are impressive. Thanks for sharing! I need to up my picture taking game.
---
That is all incorrect.
---
That second one looks pure hollywood. Bravo.
---
How much is the exp bonus per intelligence?
---
i run bloodied no time to use a stim pack i throw them away.
---
Downvoting a post Bethesda should notice and others should notice is hurting the game. This is how they discover certain bugs by expressing it on here and submitting a ticket, making sure they see it. People come here to express their feelings of a certain issues in hoping Bethesda will notice and others will agree, so upvoting it will get it more noticed. I’ve had Bethesda comment on one of my reddit posts because it was upvoted 1k times. Gtfo.
---
Some people do not belong in this game.
---
That is one of them.
---
Look up angryturtle on YouTube. Dude has some really good vids about different builds.
---
Keep that 33 I rolled a Q 33 and in vats it is a beast
---
He was at Huntersville tonight for me, smashing the shit out of the mutants that had wronged him.
---
Vault 76
---
I did not know this, thanks. This is very good information considering 2x xp weekend. Lol
---
RDR2 dis this.  Helped a guy that got bit by a snake out in the wild and a few days later I was riding through town and he starts hollering "That's the guy!  Thats the one that saves me" or whatever.  I went and talked to him and he said "Go buy something from the gun store on me."  It was a really cool way to reward the player for being a nice guy
---
Love it. The goal of a battle royale is not to kill. It is to not \*be\* killed. You won fair and square.
---
reset is 11am i logged in at 5p.m and i had the auto complete glitch happen to me.
---
You mean the dad’s wallet
---
Seems there are a lot of mooseriders... Are either one of those characters a ZERO? Are there any numbers in your GT. GnarKole is my GT. Easier if you just message me probably. I’m on now
---
Welcome! 
---
Just gonna copy and paste my thingy
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps. 
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp. 
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. 
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod. 
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.
---

---
Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds. 
---
Plant some crops in your camp. Corn or Razorgrain. And then make soup.
---
By Story I think it’s good the enclave events are unlocked after being a member.
---
But i‘m with you about joining them - currently it’s not worth it. As the purv was at the station I always skipped the event nearby.
---
I leveled two characters during this double XP. One to 100 and one to 50 (100 for steam achievement and the other to 50 for legendary vending).
---
I realize now (having my main at level 430) that leveling is actually harder with a character under 100. Partly because of the OP players one shotting everything. Partly because true leveling right now means you have to kill 68 level hoards the entire gaming session.
---
Had it not been for my level 200 friend helping me level these two alts it would have taken much longer with more frustration.
---
So I feel those right now trying to take advantage of double XP and who are lower levels. It's not easy.
---
The shelf on the right is probably the nicest looking shelf in the game. It would be perfect as a display case.
---
Which is why it's mind boggling that it isn't actually a display case and you have to use glitches to place anything on it.
---
"iT bItHiSdIs FaUlT nOt MiNe" that they don't fix this broken game! did they know how hard is to change from your junkies bloodied explosive 3 chads minugun to a lesser one? fking money grab company man or wait for other people to shoot? wtf? is this charity now?
---
im getting better at remembering all the excuses lmao
---
Well done!  I’d gold this but I have no more reddit coins
---
Melted a Wendigo Colossus with my Gatling Laser... The ash pile despawned, never to be seen again.
---
Cryolator killing ME in SBQ event, just before it died so I didn't get anything...
---
The Encrypted bug... No respawn that kinda thing...
---
Game crashing when picking up stuff after Radiation Rumble finished, all the loot gone.
---
Good times...
---
"IT JUST WORKS"
---
You see, here is the reason why they didn't do anything. You have 2 choices when it comes to anticheat. 
---
You either write one in-house, in which case you will fail, because your anticheat will be shit( I know that for the fact, because technical state of other Bethesda software-games, is also shit)). There are exceptions to this, but they are exceedingly rare.
---
You purchase a licence to already established anticheat solution and you let them do the heavy lifting. This works if you chose right one(essentially BattleEye if you have money or easy Anticheat if you don't). 
---
But here is the thing, Bethesda doesn't want to spend any money on this game. Pre launch beta was just a working prototype of a game pushed out to make money of micro transactions. If there wasn't a shitstorm after launch, only God knows how wastelanders would have looked like. 
---
Bethesda doesn't want spend more than they need to and right now, this isn't a critical issue for them.
---
More gold of course !
---
Around 2% per intelligence point I believe
---
Oof :( I am starting to see more low levels, had to beg the few level 100+ to do project paradise, and for some reason I’ll never understand, they decided not to initiate the event
---
Thought I glitched.. I was just happy non were completed lol
---
Thanks, I'm fairly proud of that one as well. Currently set as my desktop background.
---
I once had a roof section I couldn't delete because it was supporting the other roof section I couldn't delete.  The stupid part was that these two sections were floating because I'd deleted all the floors, walls, and roof pieces around it.
---
Well thanks for that and the added chuckle. Working hard in a hot factory on a hot and stressful day, so I needed the laugh.
---
Are you like a walking theater show? Why do you need that many outfits? That's enough to wear a diff one a day for over a year...
---
I bet 80% of people still didnt run ore.
---
I was already planning to get a month of FO 1st before Meat Week started, this makes it even better.
---
my camp as it is on the outskirts of nowhere way up a mountain that overlooks the whole map. i sit at my outside fire place and just watch time pass some days doing absolutely nothing.
---
I got mine yesterday right before I logged off.  If you're behind, so am I.
---
I dunno if it’s well known but almost any event that is just waves or defending something can be done easily.  For example, Tea Time can be done by starting the event and running away from all of the pipes (but not so far you exit the event).  It seems the game needs your presence to spawn enemies.  Uranium Fever can be done the same way, start the event up and run back to the main entrance and wait.  Nothing will happen and the event will complete.  Guided Meditation can be done this way too.
---
Well.  Gotta go try this now.
---
Def should get the ammo maker if you dont already have it..
---
Thanks.
---
Hide and seek is a valid component of battle royale. There is a reason they make the survivor the winner, not the person who got the most kills. Otherwise, it would really just be an elimination deathmatch, which is an entirely different, and also very fun game mode.
---
And you'd be wrong, but do carry on.
---
Cheeky lol
---
Thought the cap was 5,000
---
Honestly the best advice is to have a higher level friend bring you through high level hoards allowing you to tag them. I leveled a 38 and 80 level to 50 and 100 respectively in one day doing this.
---
Do all the typical XP buffs keep INT high use UNY and go to places like West Tek, the burrows, WS sentry bots etc. Hit events like guided meditation radiation rumble line in the sand. Having someone sort of tour guide you through high level hoards is the best method.
---
where are these posts i dont see them and i even searched
---
Oh I didn’t know that was possible, how do you get one?
---
You dont get score when the 
---
game auto completes them for sure.
---
There’s a mod for that in fo4 I think
---
Ammo maker is the best thing you can grab. Wasn't to impressed with the gauss mini
---
I don’t know about that bed, but you should be able to craft the mountain scout outfit as long as you played the game before wastelanders was released. The headwear, however is not craftable and never has been. It was a free item for folks.
---
No I mean mine I worked around doing odd jobs for neighbors before this pandemic started
---
The real question is what did you have to do to get the Xbox taken away
---
lol i mean he’s responsible for the score loss so he should PAY
---
And I believe that’s wrong, you get an 8% experience gain from a fully bonded team of 4... 
---
people have done the numbers using these teams and using brain fungus soup...
---
Put a scarecrow down and aim a few at them.  They agro mobs then just have 1 or 2 in the opposite corner of the camp to get stragglers
---
In a deathmatch, the player with the highest kill count wins, this is not deathmatch. That is an entirely different type of game.
---
Oh I have one alright. On PC. It pisses me off when high level swooped down all the free shit I prepared for whoever needs them. I had to put a note saying "QUIT BEING GREEDY LIL SHITS. TAKE ONLY WHAT YOU NEED" It works tho. Players take them moderately leaving some for other players too :D
---
I haven't seen him since the last Meat Week but was graced with his presence after fast traveling to Foundation last night. Unfortunately he didn't have anything worthwhile on him but seeing him and Chally is a gift in it's own right.
---
I’ve got 282 of them and you are more than welcome to have them if you want them...It takes 450 to buy the whole outfit
---
Why can't it be both?
---
He took you score so he should pay lol
---
what did you do wrong?
---
How much XP do you even get from events? In my experience the times I've tried to check I've gained around 1k xp, with all xp buffs, for an event when completed. SBQ gives a lot more, at least enough to have given me the weekly repeatable each time, but beside from that I don't even see the point in switching just as the event finishes, so I'll just let it stay on building at all times to maximize xp from kills.
---
I don’t know why some people do this, it’s very frustrating! I just don’t get it...Is it ignorance? Is it a flex that you can insta-kill a Sheepsquatch? 
---
I make sure that I tag every legendary that I see, and then call others over. There’s always that one person to just overkill it before everybody gets a chance to hit it though. I hate how tense I get during events like Uranium Fever...
---
It’s frustrating that some people just don’t get it
---
It wont  work at my  pc  while  all  other  addons do work.
---
I forgot to tell my dad before I took my sister to get a soda
---
As someone who uses blocker on my heavy gunner build. I can deny that it’s broken. It’s working as intended
---
Secret Service PA if you don’t have it
---
Just made it there today, luckily you’re right on track!
---
Crap. I read some a couple of weeks ago and not sure the sources now. So I guess my question still stands, whether or not it’s working for everybody.
---
When you prime it, it uses ultracite ammo, so its referred as the primed "weapon name" or the ultracite "weapon name"
---
I know it dosent spit out that many but if you place down enough of them you can get loads of ammo.
---
Totally with you lmao how he even dare to take it away while the legendary run
---
so many downvotes, youd think i personally attacked some of you for wanting a reward for winning. yes tell us about how much skill you showed hiding in a bush or in water all the way up to the last 2 people.
---
I think you missed the whole thing about the premise and conclusion of the post false. I know it's easy and safe and snug to stick with the assumption that every negative/ bug oriented post is important for Bethsoft to see but it's just not true that every post is valuable and this is the case here.
---
Like I said, not defending bethesda, but this post is trash.
---
I usually just go find them myself. I find the cryptic coded fun to solve.
---
Well you can continue to do a suicide build but I feel like the loading screens and stuff would be super annoying if you die a lot.
---
What I don’t understand I don’t see nothing wrong with that really
---
Yeah? Good to know. Thanks.
---
How is that true? You have a fully bonded team with 8% extra xp add some brain fungus soup and you’ve got another +4 intelligence so that’s another 8% that’s nearly a 20% boost?
---
Yeah  then  i usually  put  my  mic  on  then.
---
mmh... giving access to pve though pvp achievement would not be cool \*at all\* imho...
---
lol exactly!
---
Cool trap camp and the video is really impressive.
---
Please don't reproduce!
---
Nope and I think that's a good thing in a way. The xp you get kicks in at two points: top ten and above third place. Battle Royale style gaming is about survival and I like the idea that NW allows for witty players who sneak and hide the chance to place high while bringing the value of running around with a stacked team and heavy guns down a bit. They reward players for getting second place or third place pretty damn high while chilling the 1st place position a little. 
---
Tbh keeping the rewards for 1st down makes the game a bit more fun for me. Allows my team to focus on staying alive and being tactical. Keeps the pressure down and makes it fun.
---
for real! i have a bloodied bow sneak build with all perks. he can do unbelievable amounts off damage with a sneak attack in vata. strange even at 95% i miss a lot.
---
But like grammar isnt exactly your strong suit either there champ. Imagine telling people to learn to spell when you can't even properly formulate a sentence. Imagine thinking your a sick road man cause you called a guy waste on reddit. Puss clot, guan bout yah business elswa
---
Ohhhhh ok.
---
Ok thank you👍🏼
---
Sorry, I should clarify.  I've earned about 6700 Gold Bullion, but have impulse-purchased a few items already.  I am at the 5k max currently and am looking to splurge!
---
Bring back the elder battlecoat!
---
Thats awesome
---
Not yet. Anytime they set a deadline or launch date for anything in regards to this game, add 2 months to it at least to get the real date.
---
If I'm not mistaken there's a torso PA mod that increases strength and/or carry weight. 
---
Edit: Just checked, Motion Assisted Servo mod increases Carry weight.
---
Probably just a faulty flux capacitor.
---
He wouldn't care normally he's mad I forgot to tell him first cuz what if something went wrong he wouldn't know where to find us still stupid though
---
I have 8 too
---
Google it.
---
I feel like you could replace inspirational with tenderizer or suppressor
---
Log into your account at bethesda dot net, choose Support Center near bottom of page, choose Fallout 76 and Submit a Ticket, select platform and "I need help with the Atomic Shop", "I want a refund". Then tell them when you bought the item, what's the issue and how much it cost.
---
Like it is possible to catch up but you would have to be dedicated to do so. The youtuber Angry Turtle put out a recent video about maximising exp gain and getting 4k exp for a single enemy is stupid crazy but if you could do it you could catch up.
---
Fallout collector syndrome... I wanted to keep one of everything, especially since there are things you can't get anymore if you got them once through a quest. Also I still got tons of fastnacht masks on me that I want to sell/gift. And there are a bunch of straight jackets and other expensive clothing in my stash that I sell if I can't reach the daily cap with junk/chems.
---
Yea definitely is stupid I’m sorry for you brother but if you play all day and do everything that pops up I think you’ll be able to still be up to date
---
Took my little sister to get soda without permission
---
I think that’s all of them today
---
Imagine that if you killed yourself your mom wouldn't show up to your funeral. Your mom would take a double shift before going to your funeral.
---
Alright thanks, how long does it usually take btw?
---
??? What are you on about?
---
..The Seedy Shed can be placed in other's CAMPs?
---
If i rwmember the Roadmap right i think it said in September theyll be implemented
---
No they been pushed back to patch 21 was the last time I heard a date for it
---
That's good because I'm currently level 40s and it suck to be stuff even halfway
---
I will definitely consider this. Maybe I will pick Tenderizer up later after I've leveled a bit. I just bought the game and am level 9
---
If your dad can take away your Xbox I don’t think you should be allowed to have a credit card...
---
To be fair - they broke nothing by fixing the light bulb back then. I guess.
---
As others have said but expanded:
---
- Install the [intraw](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/513) mod on pc, it shows true integer values instead of generic bars. For example camp budget max in numbers is 10k so ~10% for a turret is 1/10th of your budget or 1000. Not worth it. 
---
- [Turrets/crops/brahmin/large neon signs take ~10% budget](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aktp14/budget_costs_of_different_structures/). With none of that you free up a ton of space. Spotlights are the only exception at ~2% but all turrets are still fundamentally broken so not worth using. I am in the Mire and at worst I get attacked by a scorched officer once in a blue moon. 
---
- Use the farmable tiles as floor where you would have had a normal floor anyway if you must have crops so you are not wasting an extra floor tile.
---
- Minimize roofs as they are also a big budget eater. (my current camp has like 4-7 roofs acting as an overhang but is otherwise open air. 
---
- Certain pieces are uniquely expensive, most lights are 10% a pop. Lighting can turn an extremely unappealing space into a very cool looking one so play around with lighting a lot!
---
- Most static decorations in floor/wall decor that don't light up are typically 0.2% so you can get a lot of mileage with tiny decorations. The majority of my camp is little details in the form of smaller decorations. 
---
- I see a ton of half built camps that try to be mansions/warehouses. Keep your design minimal and not everything has to be fully enclosed like a vault and not every piece of terrain needs flooring. Tight spaces can be tricked out to appear more spacious but the best camps I have seen are tiny houses with many small rooms or open air. 
---
[Example of my camp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t52oRvimQkY), open air, try to be conservative about expensive stuff but am sitting at 9999/10000 budget most of the time. For example one trick I used is some of my flooring is carpets and since flooring is 0.5 a pop and carpets are 0.166 a pop you save quite a bit. Little tricks like that add up. 
---
Good luck, camp building is one of my true joys in 76.
---
I only have 4 dailies today
---
Absolutely. If your that low, I would wait until at least level 50 until swapping that over
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer\_rank](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank)

I tanked like 6 hits from the queen yesterday with almost no dmg
---
I don't have a credit card but I can buy Xbox gift cards using cash
---
You mean the real date to when they tell you what date they will actually release it....
---
Rip. Maybe they'll add one randomly an hour before reset like last time and I'll still miss it anyway :p
---
I was looking for this. Can confirm
---
 Draw/vatsshoot. Like that fast and you wont miss. 
---
Fuck vats is so good with that method youll grt better accuracy further away if timed right (damn telling secrets)
---
Yeah I grabbed Inspirational just for all the bonus XP there is right now. Especially with starting on a double XP weekend
---
Heavy gunner, you say? Might I interest you in the Gauss Minigun line of quality firearms? It’s the latest advancement in legendary pest control.
---
Also have 8. Half of them auto completed but yeah.
---
Old man Clemens hates shit!
---
I accidentally shot some one during a nuke on a new account. All of his buddies and himself well over 300 shot me and took all my junk which was a few hundred pounds worth. Then they proceeded to track me until I went offline and had messages from the calling me noob and shit. People are so unbelievable sometimes.
---
I have almost every mod if you want me to take a look. Il be on after my lunch.
---
My bad - I did some digging and, you're right, she cannot be crippled.  Time to rethink my approach :)  (Note: I took a break since it first came out, so I have a lot to learn.  Thanks for teaching me!)
---
Like Project Paradise, you need roles and/or communication. I have no mic to tell you that I do this, you go there and do that. 
---
I can't collect ore if you are not going to guard those settlers. I can't kill ghouls if you are going to be afk near the door.
---
I’m only like lvl 23 lol I wouldn’t be worried and don’t spend money on this game but that’s my opinion
---
That would be awesome, will you be on later tonight?
---
Same. I know the Gatling mods. DM me at same GT as this post if you see me on this afternoon.
---
Is there a way to change servers? Or, if you load into a server that's under load/bugged, you're stuck.
---
Because I like 76. I would much rather play 4 but after playing 76, 4 just feels so much more clunky and i prefer the appalachia Wasteland.
---
We can advocate for a more diverse grind. That's not a problem and I shouldn't be told to play other games because I want a more diverse gameplay lol
---
Hey bud... You need arrows? What system? I have fully specced archer cards and id love a bow buddy
---
:)
---
The jet pack is a must have even if you have one on your power armor.  It uses AP which infinitely refreshes.  HUGE QoL increase
---
The plasma caster is a heavy and I use it quite a bit.  It's pretty much replaced my gatling gun in most scenarios.

The Guass Minigun is super fun to use and completely impractical as an every day weapon unless you are super fallout rich.  I pull it out whenever I get a ton of ammo for it saved up and have a blast until I run out.  Really sucks honestly, but it would literally be all you see otherwise.
---
T65 is a definate upgrade from the other t series armors on paper. In use I dont really notice a difference compared to the ultracite I was using.  Diminishing returns and all when you hit those defense thresholds.  It does however look pretty damned cool so theres that lol
---
Farmable tiles are AWESOME.  Nothing else needs to be said.
---
Turbo fert fertilizer is AWESOME.  It makes your plants respawn their food.  Saves a huge amount of camp budget cause you dont need a ton of camp budget for plants anymore, just a few will do ya.
---
Ammo machine is meh.  It doesnt produce fast enough for my liking but it's nice to pick up a few .50 cal rounds every time I'm at my camp.
---
Floater grenades are absolute garbage.
---
Bethesda: nah
---
Are they not supposed to be there?? I’m surprised because when I was doing the main quest (the BoS one where you need to go there) there were only level 1 eyebots, the scorched and the scorchbeast... I thought the eyebots were BoS remnants left in there...
---
I read how to insert and got really confused because the rest was cutoff I was most certainly not being dirty minded
---
Ah really? Sorry, now I feel bad lol
---
Ok so on xbox your name here is the same as on xbox?
---
Yeah sorry, I clarified the original post that I've earned about 6700 but have spent a bit.  I am eyeballing the Gauss Mini, but I already have a lot of good 3\* heavies (hoarder tendency again).  Is it that much better than the normal ones?
---
Pretty much all night yep. GT is Ganuin. Another guy commented too. Whatever you like. Just message me.
---
I wonder whether two-shot would get to the slowest debuff stage faster.
---
Nice work. The photomode in this game is a lot of fun to play with. So much you can do with it.
---
Well i think that depends on the weapon and any other then the mentioned Main categories are Individual cases. For example i have an instigating 
---
+40% bashing damage combat shotgun  that does the magic really really good ( modded it automatic with Reflex sight and long barrel for minimum vats cost really a beast), on the other Hand i had a ffr minigun modded high speed so that the final fire rate was like 220 and I did Not notice any magic effect on it - &gt; Sold it for 9999 caps to someone who apparently thought its magic haha.
---
So I'd say just test it for your weapon. As its a buggy mess 100% precise Statements are Hard to get i guess.
---
I seem to remember that patch broke quite a few things, and the light bulb note generated a lot of heat because of the stuff they broke.
---
It was the PA patch IIRC. Broke the whole system for months, and a few of those bugs have only been resolved by Wastelanders
---
ive done worse. i traded a legacy 2 shot explosive rifle for scipt once. i had that gin since i was  a fallout baby. because it was ultracite. i couldn't skin it so i speed pumped the buttons and noticed it the next day.
---
I always keep my water pumps unlocked for people, I seem to always have an abundance of it anyway
---
Ok neat, that would be awesome. I'm trying to go for a rapid fire gatling gun build
---
That's good news
---
This really is a game of numbers, thanks for this.
---
So it wasn’t their brightest moment I guess
---
NOICE
---
Haha 😂 this made me laugh irl  
---
Throwin some serious shade
---
Why would you need 15 int to figure out that if you give him a stimpack he’ll get better lol
---
It's like buying cheap printers on sale. The printer with ink is cheaper than buying the ink refills, just throw away the printer.
---
I usually sell things for 1 cap below half price, but I'll also round down. I havent seen a single player end their prices in 9, so I decided to do so. Working out well so far!
---
500? &gt; 249
---
250? &gt; 119
---
50? &gt; 19
---
How much should I charge for a lvl 50 gatling laser that weighs 1.85lbs? I wanted to make it my one overpriced item in case someone with max caps feels like buying it. I've had it at 19999 for a few days now with no bites lol.
---
He could have been a synth.
---
Show me all of them
---
None of the bugged methods to blow up a camp were patched. They only patched the ability for your team to pull you into unwanted pvp.
---
Ah, you got stimpacks? Thanks bro.
---
feels good
---
Very nice. [I love this one.](https://i.imgur.com/SqAszgA.png)
---
If you can get a bloodied gauss mini Gun and if you put the right perks on its powerful mine is a two shot and I don’t really have perks for it and it’s still pretty strong
---
I'm on Xbox. How about you? Lol we can split up the recovered arrows lol
---
Omg the hilarity of the Nuka vending machine. Everyone knows the punch bowl, but even high levels are none the wiser to the machine. I stocked mine with 15 nukashines yesterday, within two hours I was down to 7 in the vendor 😂
---
Let’s put it in a way you might comprehend... imagine having to raid lucky hole daily and collect the nec acid daily to make a miniscule amount of 5.56 for your handmade at 18 rounds a pop for double the material cost
---
"radstag meat bomb"
---
Yup. If anyone is in PS4 and wants one, I'll be happy to help
---
Ahhhhj ps4
---
You shouldn’t feel bad I literally just got on to see what I needed to do for today and saw 4 dailies and was like wtf i should have 9. I figure bethtard put some hot fix out that broke more then it fixed as usual.
---
Same.  In fact I purposely planted carrot, corn, mutfruit and razor grain right on the street near Flatwoods so that anyone that was starting or just in need could easily get their starter supplies.  Also have good ol Bessie making fertilizer too because we need the Brahmin poop to make those tasty crops!
---
&gt;There are other reasons too where scrapping the machines is a more annoying and time consuming process than switching them off.
---
What other reasons pray tell would you have for making your vendor not show on the map other than to prevent people from buying from your vendor, sending you over your cap limit?
---
Nice PSA! Saved me some atoms
---
a way of doing it is to locate a person on the serve. add them to blocked list.  then hit LB exit to main screen the choose adventure. its not supposed to put you back on a server with a person you blocked in game.
---
Awesome info, thanks!  I didn't realize the Plasma Caster was heavy, so that just made my decision harder.  Sadness.
---
Then cranberry relish with herbivore is another 20% xp if you didn’t know that
---
I think my alt was around 80 when they finally started to spawn as lv68.

Leaving the door open is how i know i've already been there. :3

&gt; Evergreen Mills

Did you mean Tranquility Lane?
---
Tips time!6
---
Buy your own ;)
---
Nice exploiting/cheating
---
You make a good point. Could use an alt as a work around, seems like a lot of trouble but wouldn't surprise me. And 100%, BSG would probably break something else while trying to fix this.
---
If you're a HW user and set it to 5mm, your Gatling Gun is set for life. I've actually been making more ammo than I use in most play sessions and the excess has been going to feed my minigun during queen fights.
---
How about a Chicken leg.
---
If you’re not always in PA, the SS jet pack is game changing.
---
There's also the glitch where once you place it you can't remove it. Says something about an unknown error. Mine has been stuck and hogging up camp space since it first came out
---
Imo Ammo Machine &gt; Backpack mods &gt; 1st SS Chest Piece (Buy 2nd limb piece and Buttressed/Jetpack mod once you've achieved good rolls on first piece and repeat til done) &gt; Strangler Heart Armor (T65 is worthless w/ diminishing returns) &gt; SS Underarmor and S Lining &gt; Gauss Minigun (Penta/Prime) &gt;  Plasma Caster &gt; CAMP decorations &gt; Gauss Shotgun &gt; whatevers left
---
Bloodied Heavy Weapon user here, ended up liking SS so much I hardly use my new Strangler set now
---
 You can also convert ur existing team to another type after already choosing one. Hit start, Social, team, select ur name if host, and change public team goal. One gives more xp for Events, one gives xp for legendary kills, one for Charisma, one for END, one for INT, and one for Luck. 
---
If you look under each S.P.E.C.I.A.L. in ur Pip boy you can see what each one adds. Kinda wierd with this game, I didnt figure this out till almost level 25 w/ High levels always telling me INT for xp. 
---
(Sorry for edit) 
---
(Additional edit) Did more research and I was wrong with my OG comment. For what ever reason there is a lot of either guides, or top search results saying INT doesn't give xp.
---
i enjoy that alternative
---
Yeah I agree with you on that
---
on top of
---
now, or coming at some point?
---
Now my head is full of images about mansized floppy dicks running around in the game. It's tough for a straight man.
---
I want them to add the entire lot from gun runners, and the ammo modifications. Not just as skins or locked behind a new currency but as guns integrated into the regular loot pools, plans, mods and gun drops.
---
Hell, they could learn a lot from NW with their weapon variety. Bring back the unique weapons and scatter them around  the map.
---
PlayfulHunter has most. Always selling.
---
Do you need me to beat up your dad?
---
I’ve been offline and at work every time it’s hit me. Send a support ticket so they can gather more info and hopefully fix this.
---
It's 8 weeks now for trying to circumvent your punishment.
---
That's great. Maybe the +25%ffr makes it buggy, there's a lot of numbers popping out. Some normal, some yellow crits, so I just look at the hp bar when testing
---
People on here literally have tested the numbers and just do a search on YouTube
---
Sadly this is all of them... didn't keep the ones that were not worthy.
---
Also, I'm planning on making a second character that is a fists only build, then imma punch the scorch beast queen to death with my bare fists
---
I found the same to be true. Once I got the hang of it, the bow became a lot of fun. I’ve also found that higher PER does make it a bit more reliable and that Gun Fu seemed to make it extra wonky.
---
Yeah couldn't remember the name of the town in the simulation.
---
I would proudly fly a chicken leg flag above my camp.
---
Great comparisons, much appreciated!
---
Yes. According to what's been posted here on the sub today, there are only 8 challenges.
---
Yeah, Bethesda's apparently working on it dude. Hopefully we get a fix soon.
---
It would be nice to put a sign up that didn't take budget for each individual letters.
---
Cool. I appreciate it.
---
Beautiful.
---
We need a “it just works” flag too
---
Wow they’re amazing.
---
I hate when high level players act more greedy then the fresh players. I set up a low level vendor with three full sets of decked out lvl 10 leather armor, three lvl 10 hunting rifles, three lvl 15 pump shotties, three lvl 20 fixers, 1000 rounds of each ammo for 1 cap, and stims for 5 caps. Some level 160 comes over and goes up to the vendor LABELED "Low level help" and buys out all the ammo, stims, and one of the fixers. I felt mad, but seeing him buy a level 20 fixer made me feel bad for him, how do you get to lvl 160 and not know you can't learn a fixer plan by dismantling it?
---
People on here and YouTube have tested whether intelligence adds xp
---
I love Fallout and that is what keeps me coming back.  If it was any other game, I would not put up with half of the issues.  I don’t like the script and gold time gate, but the caps do need a limit or all player venders will be like the market place sub and everything will cost 5 mules max caps.   
---
The script is annoying when you are making armor or weapons with modules.   Modules should cost less but that is another rant.  Gold sucks when you have to login just to cash in 200 of 1000 you have.  If the current events just had better rewards that would keep us busy while having fun.
---
well always, otherwise you'll never complete the pie quest
---
You posted the first post about having only 4 dailies like one minute after the reset. Give it a good 10minutes before logging in and go straight to adventure mode, not atomshop/season/nw. And there was 8 today.
---
ok, i'll do it
---
Start with 4 ibuprofen, you’re gonna need it.
---
You do I think
---
7/8 out auto completed for me today. It’s my first time, I thought I was just lucky 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Everything after Skyrim wasn't their brightest moment
---
I had the same thing happen the other day at a vendor. I ended up messaging the guy and he offered to get it to the low level player, but he had already left the game at that point. I also had the same thing happen to me. Another player messaged me and told me she was dropping a bunch of legendaries and wanted to give them to me so I could use them for scrip or however I wanted. Another guy, who was not low level but had messaged me asking for food (which I gave him a bunch of) then ran over and grabbed them before I realized she had dropped them and gives a big thumbs up. I’m guessing he thought they were free game, but she and I had clearly moved away to another room so I feel like he should have known. Boo.
---
Yeah, I initially rug-glitched for item placement, but it became such a chore that I just considered it a wash!
---
Vault boy version of "You gotta do what you gotta do" from futurama
---
Not bad at all, the m1 Garand is a badass rifle
---
Eh boy, the last time I was in a factory it was summer, I had to wear a paint suit, and I was stationed right next to ovens! Needless to say the SBI (Sweaty Butt Index) was pushing 100%, so thoughts and prayers lol 😆 Stay safe there, hopefully your days almost over!
---
We absolutely need that
---
(herd vengeful brahmin to camps)
---
So I reloaded my game and now I have all my dailies but I’ve finally been struck by the auto completing challenges bug. Almost made it 3 weeks with no problem
---
oh, in game. grats
---
Jeez. It is very important to let your parents know but hopefully he's exaggerating a bit. A month is a bit much. Be extra helpful around the house and hopefully he'll lighten it to a week for you.
---
Perhaps observant and also suicidal.
---
Rule #1 STAY OFF THE DAMN TENTS!
---
Rule #2 Stay off the DAMN Fences!
---
Rule #3 Do not Cryo her while she is in the Air!
---
If he is pooping on you it means the person she is agroed on is not accessible ie they are on a tent, on the bunker, or on a fence or a tree and not on the ground.  If she can't access a target she poops and tries to reacquire a  target and the AI for landing loops back around.
---
this is the way it has worked since day 1 if you don't know this learn it.
---
I've read that some of the autocomplete bugginess happens when you complete the NW challenge and then do not log back into Adventure before exiting the game completely. I don't play NW at all to be able to test it, but I've seen quite a few people commenting they believe it is one of the reasons.
---
They are always watching lol.
---
Then you ask who are they? 
---
I say exactly.
---
Someone at Bethesda is going "Not the fucking doormat again" right now :D
---
I used a mic once, no-one seemed to give a fuck.
---
It's a set location though, Monongah mine. It's a neat little event, almost like a boss dungeon. Also, once it comes out don't forget there's a secret ish room after you kill her with loot in it.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
I am talking about the experience it shows on the screen when you complete an event it was the same with a full team on Wednesday as it was yesterday with double xp. Maybe I'm confused. I know I got the repeatable enough to almost finish a level, so seems like I was getting more but that number at the end was the same.
---
I have to ask: if I log out and everything is repaired in my camp, why is my camp damaged when I log back in later? 
---
Is it going on adventures without me?!
---
I’ve logged back in to concrete barriers down, dead super mutants bodies, dead mongrels - how did this happen in the login time?
---
It gets better and there are luck perks for both that help a lot
---
Thanks, I knew you would :)
---
Like a sign that just has a character limit built into it? So, only budget loss is on the sign itself.  That's a great idea.  Like, a really great idea.  Even if it was only 14 characters or something. Enough to add some flavor to camp or advertise vendor info.
---
Does intelligence actually increase experience gain? I've been looking it up for a bit and haven't been able to find anything on that, only people on reddit saying that it does, but I'm just getting more confused lol.
---
I do like to step out of PA to showcase my Flaming Bow Chainsaw and Radical mask (I usually just run around in circles chopping things up ala Bloody Mess) but it might be a nice addition to fly.
---
But how much XP is required for each level?
---
Sounds like a plan.
---
Hope you have a good time.
---
As I still am playing Pokemon Go 4 years later I would love for them to introduce stuff like I have seen there so to speak
---
- Event Days - Make a Saturday/Sunday during a certain time be an event day for specified event so like a Riding Shotgun Saturday from 11a-8p - Riding Shotgun event has no event cool down except for needing to be completed before the next one triggers.
---
- Paid Ticket Events - (ok, after everyone collectively stops groaning and downvoting, this is just a suggestion): a paid event that will eventually be put in the game as a regular event but you get some kind of guaranteed rewards during that time frame - no RNG. So some kind of guaranteed small or medium reward. Large reward included in RNG rewards after the paid event. 
---
And then just overall I would like to see more events at all. Sometimes me, my wife and brother are getting bored but would have played 12 hours if we were able to jump on and work in events one after another. Some servers it feels like this happens, others it feels like I get one event every few hours.
---
EDIT: I LOVED Faschnact and I know Meat Week is coming but events like that that replay over and over is what I miss and we need more frequently. Me, my wife and brother played SO much searching for Mole Miner Treasure Hunters and it was so exciting to hear that jingle and farm legendaries. I also know we will get the Scorched event but maybe have one for Super Mutants and one for Raiders or Blood Eagles or something for Summer/Fall so we have 1 legendary event every quarter.
---
"Hey, I'm squattin heeere"
---
Gunsmith, Fix It Good, Weapon Artisan 
---
Edit - white knight too
---
Yeah except that's not how it works at all. 
---
You really think they care about random people googling shit? You can google whatever you want and nothing is going to happen.
---
We need a designated zone where it’s just pvp
---
For higher level players who does the endgame boss frequently, you get repair kits that repairs your weapon by 150% or something. We usually have too much of them. I constantly have to drop them because it takes space on me and the weapons doesn’t break fast enough in order to use them haha. I carry around about 150 ish before I drop half of them. Then in a weeks time or so, I’ll have close to 150 again. Or well this is my experience. It would be different to people who doesn’t do the end game boss regularly.
---
When i first started i was like 'ooh ill build my camp on that island!' 
---
*Deathclaw Island discovered*
---
"Oh shi- nevermind"
---
Alot of people usually go 5 int for the perks to reduce weapon deterioration. At your level most guns are just throw and go.
---
Ah, gotcha. I was confused as to what your issue was. Something to bear in mind though is some players (like me) don't usually collect ore coz it means finding pa or switching outfit.
---
Let a high level craft/fix your stuff. Noticeable improvement. Newly 3 digits if you need help
---
With the number of people losing score to glitches they ought to keep up the dailies. I doubt its that difficult a project to have the few extra. Shit it can even stay the same on the extra ones--keep the one for buying from a vendor and killing enemies.
---
That means they were fighting a wendigo colossus.  It’s a fear emote, go help people when you see that!
---
Grandpa hasn't let me sit on his lap since Patch 20. Keeps telling me to hush.
---
I know of two perks that affects armors an weapons that makes them fix Itself When the enemy NCP attacks you, it’s in the Luck special.
---
P.S check the fallout.wikia.com page.
---
I think it’s the one when the Wendigo Colossus uses his scare attack
---
I say “game changing” in a way like jumping without marsupial was. Once you have it you wouldn’t want to play without it. I forget my PA doesn’t have a jet pack sometimes when I go to “double jump” lol.
---
We need a different gamemode. Think NW but on the normal map. Something similar to the survival mode we used to have but nothing fancy like vats.
---
I don’t touch NW on Wednesday but on Thursday they were auto completed. I also wasnt logged in at all. None of the normal reasons seem to apply anymore to this issue.
---
During my pre-1st days....
---
Bulk extra scrap and sell it to vendors. Most scrap youI use very little of like ceramic, crystal, etc. Keep some lead and steel for ammo and armor. 
---
My way wad to get down to 300 of anything I use frequently and down to 100 or less of anything that I never use really. It helps alot and you get caps. 
---
Make sure you're actually scrapping things you dont need like random weapons and junk. 
---
Dont keep legendaries you'll never use, scrip them or trade them.
---
Gotcha.  Well, theoretically you can earn 1700 atoms a week via treasury and buying from Smiley.  
---
I haven’t bought anything myself yet, still trying to decide. I won’t hit ally any time soon so trying to be strategic on what I buy
---
I’ll have to check that next time, ty
---
I am pretty sure the wiki is giving those as an example. If you are looking at [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Level](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Level), then it is saying 15880 for level 100 which would be right. My calculations show going from 99 to 100 is 15880. However it says 159800 is for level 1000 not 300. 938 is the point you cross over 150k and 1000 is 159880. 
---
I play on PS4, so I don't have access to mods that show the numbers, but I have been using the Repeatable Challenge to verify the numbers given. For example the moment I reach level 184 I look at the progress and see I am at 2039 of 10000. The last kill I got gave me 172xp. So I know I am starting with less than 172xp in my level. Then I get the repeatable 3 times. Then when I reach level 185 I look at the progress and see I am at 1498 of 10000. The last kill gave me 166xp. This tells me I gained 29459 between these two marks. Subtracting and adding in the xp I gained tells me that 185 is somewhere between 29293 and 29631. Which is clearly more than the 15880 given by the wiki. The formula tells me that to reach level 185 I need 29480 which is very close the to 29459 I achieved.  
---
You could get better numbers by doing something like boiling water to level up each time so that your base numbers would be only 2 or 3 off depending on how much xp you got for boiling the water when you leveled up. You could also get better numbers on PC by getting a mod that shows you the number for your actual xp.
---
I’m seeing fewer and fewer people in any teams and I’m not sure why. I really need the extra XP so I can get my score points for leveling up in the short amount of time I have to play every day. Am I missing something? Are there disadvantages to being on a team? The last few days I’m only had one or two open teams on a server, and most of those only had 1 or 2 people.
---
You can’t purchase that emote, but that’s a good sign because that means they were fighting the wendingo colossus.
---
FFS I’m already dreading logging in.
---
I agree on gun fu. I had to turn it off. Always missed on subsequent targets. I can switch almost as fast anyways, and I never liked how gun fu  never seems to pick the target I want next.
---
They should put that in their commercials lol...
---
Got him yesterday, looks good on the UFO slide, really cute
---
For the railway gun yes. Everything else no
---
No dude if you have searched it up in the past then it will remember so you don’t spend 20’minutes searching for the website
---
I want one! Can I move it around after it's placed?
---
I don’t like how you are referring to level 50+ players as “newbies”. Just because you are a higher level than somebody else doesn’t make them a noob. Go pull that shit with level 10 players.
---
Damn it! I still have yet to see one of these and that was my chance! Ty for the info.
---
Maybe have an "adult" discussion with your dad (I'm guessing you're really young), apologise for what you did, tell him about the situation with the game &amp; how this time away will set you back &amp; try to negotiate with him to see how you can shorten or eliminate the punishment.
---
If your dad isn't a total arsehole, he might warm to a more mature approach. Maybe get you to do some shit he's been wanting you to do/see from you. 
---
Failing that, use your mother against him :)
---
Thank god someone appreciates the classics
---
Yes you can. You can also store it. It is yours until you scrap it!
---
Nope, still the same. Only certain weapons work, but everything still remains the same. Bethesda doesn’t give a crap about us PvP players.
---
I'm at 5K Gold on my main with over 250 notes sitting in the stash. I have the SS unyielding armor, jetpack, buttressed, AP regen for the legs as well (Level 405). I was thinking about grinding for the T-65 but after watching SH games and Angryturtle my excavator will do? I might grind it anyways, I always wanted the Strangler Heart so I might grind that or both.
---
I have the T45 Nuka Cola, T60 Nuka shine, X-01 Blackbird, Excavator so I like PA's. Currently, I turned my mule into a Stealth commando and she gets her Jet Pack tonight ;) Thx to Angryturtle for the build...
---
People were doing that all the time during the "one violent night"  event it's like thanks for being lvl 500..but did you really have to be bell end and make sure no one else got a legendary off the boss?
---
  On a side note during Uranium Fever I've noticed people tag and back off from the legendaries when they spawn..so there is hope
---
Hi all, thanks for the reports that there are only 8 Dailies today. I talked with the devs and we're going to make up the missing challenge next week!
---
Find all the junk you need and keep like 50-100 of it. Anything you dont use keep less than 30 of, ya never know when some noob might come asking you to mod some random thing for him. If i run low on something i need i go get more. And my stash is only used on light objects like clothing, bobbles/mags, plans, and a few select guns i cant bring myself to get rid of. Its nice not being a horder and learing to just drop all the unnecessary shit.
---
Ah i see a pun
---
I am proof that time doesn’t matter. I had mine autocomplete the other day when logging in once for the day at 8pm.
---
Sweet! Hey I'll try to think of something I can give you in return, I'll be on later tonight.
---
All right I'll try that

 &gt; Hi all, thanks for the reports that there are only 8 Dailies today. I talked with the devs and we're going to make up the missing challenge next week!
---
While I mostly agree with you,  youI wont get much love on this sub. Normal comments range from, "its part of the game " to "always store junk before adventuring" to " stop dying"
---
For me, it's just junk so I try to store as often as I can and in the end it's usually just scraps. 
---
If you due right after queen goes down, the flux disappears so no one got it, so it is what it is
---
Nice job. You might want to leave either V9 or Delta out of the blast zone so non-PA players can participate but that's your choice. Your nuke, your rules.
---
Nothing needed in return.  
---
Let me know whenever you're ready. No rush.
---
Yeah what was all that?  It said new worlds available. Never knew this was a thing.
---
Yeah but this has been happening for at least 2 months now.  I've been hoping patch after patch it would get fixed, &amp; I've been worried to report it thinking I may get banned/accused of building a camp under the map.
---
Nice shots. My coolest pic is of my first nuke. Got a shot of it in bound before the explosion.
---
Because is a Mutant... and FEV and something about Lore :) 
---
But i let the balance team adjust the requirement of the quest.
---
I was in the lobby with someone like that the other day. It's the last remnants of salty Survival mode players. They literally join lobbies just to PvP people trying to have a workshop because they are "bored". Worst part is you have to fight them or just lose your shit because they try to contest it over and over. I don't mind that it's a part of the game, but now it's the main go to for people to engage in PvP, he didn't even repair anything after I let him take it, just moved onto the next workshop. The worst part is I made like 2k caps off the dude, moved servers because it was going nowhere for my resources, and he FOLLOWED me to the next two servers before I had to appear offline!
---
Try having my user name for all kinds of games, i would wager im on a few lists.
---
Ive actually noticed the opposite. Every time it comes up theres groups of players there doing their thing. Placing power armor sets in a row (to block the ghouls), healing the npcs and of course, grabbing the ore. I might actually have a chance at the rad barrel if it keeps up, this is on pc.
---
They would complain there are still people on here that go so far as to make up fake stories so people feel bad for them
---
Thanks! Seriously if you think of something that I can give let me know.
---
Great video!  Specific and clear.
---
Thanks. I love the visuals of the nukes. I just can't ever get a decent shot with them.
---
Kazamati does it again!!
---
Hadn’t seen much from ya lately,granted I haven’t been around much either.
---
Good too see yer still crankin out killer/fun builds &amp; makin dope videos as well!!
---
Good on ya!
---
Stay Blessed
---
Right there with you. Been sitting on 5000 GB for a while now. There's nothing else I want. Got a full set of SS Armor, and a few other goodies, but the weapons are underwhelming to me and I don't give a rat's tit about power armor... Hopefully they keep adding stuff when the Brotherhood arrives.
---
On the plus side, I haven't had to return to Crater, Foundation or Overseer's house in weeks.
---
In “theory” I don’t keep much junk. In “all actuality” I FUCKING HOARD JUNK! Haha. 
---
I’m sorry I have a problem! I can’t let any junk go...didn’t help when we needed silver and gold for the pails, and fiber optics for the Chinese stealth suit... damn you Bethesda.
---
Oh, 76 is way less stressful, but there’s still a few assholes that love to attack on sight and ruin your day. I’m glad I’ve had a good experience so far without needing to turn pacifist mode on, but I’ll dabble with it now!
---
Me too, I mean they added the plasma caster in Wastelanders which I know it wasn't the first time it was featured in a Fallout game but I'd assume mostly everyone is familiar with from Fo:NV so why not a battle rifle?
---
Look at you go, Moose...
---
Also people are fairly cool with selling junk at reasonable costs. 
---
Doesn’t help to have FO1st friends tho, they can keep everything
---
Same! Ruined my experience for the day 🙄
---
Like a massive Coliseum. Yeah i can see the raiders spending their half of the gold on a big spikey coleiseum filled with all the worst terrors the wasteland has to offer. Where would it be? The mezanine floor of course. Just takes a lil rearanging if the the occasion skeliton laying around and boom we have ourself a cespit of pvp toxcisity all crammed into one instanced area where noone has to deal with it if everyone they dont want to.
---
Just a little tip, having the "Blocking" stat on any piece of armor turns shotguns into "Magic damage" weapons. As Todd says, "It just works"
---
Perfect ty for this!
---
Compared to level 20, as I said. I myself have played since beta and is level 130. The point of the story is that a level 165 has no need for a low level 1 star ski-sword
---
My SS Jetpack glitched out during Line in the Sand. I would just jump, not activate the Jet pack, and it would LAUNCH me into the stratosphere, I would die of fall damage long before I was even close to the ground and my ragdoll body would just flail as it fell to the ground. This happened like 4 times. I was so embarrassed as my dead body just kept falling from the sky.
---
Hi thanks for the reports! I spoke with the team about this today and have an update. We have fixes in for the Backwoods Bungalow that are currently targeted for Patch 21. Hope that helps!
---
i have to switch as well. i have the stealth suit for that.
---
I don't have a static IP. Like the dude said before, in America no one really has a static IP. So again, you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Nah, I'm playing Fallout76 too.
---
Blocker &amp; Fireproof work best when you have Armor on or in PA. I’ve tested blocker without wearing armor &amp; for some reason it doesn’t seem to work as well. But, even when you have 1 piece of armor on, it’ll start working well.
---
Yeah i feel like they should have made the fixer a completely different model instead of using the combat rifle model.
---
Nope. Not the case at all. Just logged in after being off for the past 11 hours and 5 of mine were completed. Haven't played NW for a week. Dumbest thing is, it completed my gold star challenge and 4 normal ones. 1250 score down the drain either way.
---
Better use the "amnesia" gun
---
I wish i play RDR2 some day... is too expensive for my gaming budget...and steam don't put *regional price* for that game.
---
&gt; They are aware. 
---
SELF-aware, thank you.

---
Nuclear winter is still in beta mode
---
Never guna happen
---
&gt; i would wager im on a few lists.
---
Yeah, but it's not very exclusive.
---
Aside from that does the build look good for the intended goal?
---
I'm pretty sure they dont even discuss it as they are well versed in spotting false positives.
---
But yeah weird to think about it isnt it?
---
...That was supposed to cost 60 dollars, so i'm gonna have to ask:
---
1. Why is an old engine used?
---
2. Why is it developed by their C-Team, after all, it IS a Fallout title
---
3. And if it really IS developed by their C-Team, WHY DOES BETHESDA NOT GIVE THEM ENOUGH RESOURCES? It's relatively clear that the team is somewhat overworked.
---
Oh yeah, the literal one and only consequence to dying in this game. Let’s just get rid of that and give everyone a B2525 and a TSE flamer. Oh, and rename the game to “Hand Holding Simulator 76” while we’re at it.
---
would be nice if the xp we get in adventure mode from nw to count for the xp weekly. also the rank up in nw 2 days in a row is very grindy
---
Pretty sure glass dome also still allows rain to fall through the structure.
---
That kid is so dead if he ever leaves Camp McClintock. He would never make in the BOS.
---
How are you finding the responder bot? I've been playing since beta and I still haven't seen the elusive bastard.
---
I'm starting to think that's it's not really in the game at all &amp; people are just meming about it.
---
They rotate stuff in and out, with a few items that never leave. Drives up sales.
---
They rotate what is available and when and actually have rather few permanent features.    
---
It's therefore best to just save your Atoms and only buy what you really want when it's there.
---
Yesterday. Yes
---
I used to have a sign on my vendor that said thank you come again, but it didn't save when I moved my camp, so I just never wanted to take the time to do it again lol, and now I don't have the budget.
---
I did, but I guess they must’ve followed me and found me the second time before I quit. Oh well, new day, new server!
---
Same thing happened to my friend while doing an event, his dog started throwing chunks so he had to get off abruptly as the event started. When he came back he had some guy talking shit to him and continually smacking him over and over because he thought he intentionally went afk. So we spent the next two hours blowing up his camp with explosive bait.
---
God mode. It was patched the other day tho.
---
You're a low level. You're better off scrapping weapons as opposed to fixing them. I'd carry a couple of hunting rifles for when the other broke. 
---
Like the rest I have ranked up gunsmith and makeshift warrior cards. I find level 3 works fine.
---
Check watoga station, and Harper's ferry.
---
Lol let’s hope that’s the case!
---
Ahh, thank you.
---
Always "in the river" 🤣👌
---
You picked up every single one of those plans, learned what you hadn't learned, then dumped the rest at a station just like the rest of us. Don't bullshit a bullshitter 😂
---
15,000 caps and i gotchu if your on ps4
---
Lmao that’s every PVP game though.
---
Oh, I just use SS armor. No power armor here.
---
That'd be great and all, if the damned system allowed me to attach the file without any issue. Every time I've tried, I've gotten an error. Almost as if Bethesda doesn't actually want to investigate all these reports.
---
The secret FBI agent who is stalking you is playing your fallout account while you are asleep. They like to have fun also, you know.
---
That would be pretty sick actually
---
It's such a weird name. Made no sense to me at all
---
Whenever they nuke the queen check on the map to see if they also nuked that Sundew Grove forest, you know...that forest with the pink flowers that shoot spores at you? If they did, make sure to get some hits on the queen or wait until the event is over and immediately go check. If you see glowing wendigos that’s a very good sign. I like to get some hits on the queen, rush over at sundrew grove, have the wendigo colossus follow me and now we’re we’re fighting TWO bosses at the same time.
---
I waited at Radiation rumble for the entire countdown yesterday, no one joined. I did it anyway, and failed lol.
---
The fallout for this is gonna be more severe than you think
---
Why couldn’t they just create an underground building...one that we could only have access to if Bethesda let us...say maybe a Vault that is inaccessible?
---
I don't have fallout 1st because I don't feel committed enough to need it that much so I'll give you my tricks:
---
1.) Scrap all junk you get into it's base components (E.g. steel, acid, bone) and then bulk it. To get the plastic required you can go to Morgantown or Watogo high school or play Groundskeeper Willy in Camden Park. This will lower your weight quite a bit. (Helped me out at the start)
---
2.) Don't keep spoilable food or any food and drink for that matter in your stash. If your food weighs 0.1, then spoils, it'll become 0.25/0.1 lbs (depending food type). This is also useless as you should carry foods and drink for easy use, rather than fast travelling when supplies are low. 
---
3.) Don't keep spare armour/weapons unless you actually need them. Do you really need 3 combat rifles, or 5 combat armour left arms? These can eat up your stash super quickly and I would, as an overall tip, only have 3 or 4 weapons that you can carry all the time. You can sell or scrap any spares you get and save that space! 
---
4.) If you have ammo or outfits in your stash, do you really need them? Mini nukes and missiles should only be picked up if you actually need them for your weapons, and check the weight of other ammo you have an abundance of and clean them out. Outfit wise, I have 5 outfits that I use, which only adds up to about 5 lbs including hats and stuff.
---
5.) Finally, clean it out regularly. If your like me, you use your stash like a bin and throw random things in. Clean it out every now and again. I clean it every Monday, if I can't Sunday, so that I don't have to care about trying to find space.
---
Hope this helped from my personal experiences!
---
Personally sometimes I leave a waypoint in what may seem like a random place but it might be a random spawn location, or a location for supplies I like to come back to, etc. What seems like random, might not always be random.
---
It sounds like a unique weapon, but it's really a rifle weapon type like the assault rifle, etc. Its special because it basically has an intrinsic legendary effect, so if this person crafts one for you it's like a 1* combat rifle but better damage also. Anyways, because of the intrinsic effect its technically possible to have a 4* Fixer
---
The carry bags akin to those you could put on robots in FO4 would be fantastic.
---
Join the subreddit's discord, there's a bot channel to get the weeks codes!
---
Yes it does, I tested it again just 5 minutes ago, I placed wooden foundation with my Unyilding (+15 INT) armor on and I get 9 XP, I take the armor off and I only get 7 XP.
---
Its simple math and easy to test by anyone...
---
There must be games out there with balanced PvP mechanics. With a community who actually enjoys PvP.
---
Yet PvPers just sit around and bitch about not having the game or community you want.
---
True, but the bonus %xp you get from intelligence boost is only on BASE XP. Not a % bonus to the xp value you see popping up on your screen after a kill.
---
Ive been wanting to roll a gunslinger too, im just waiting for a decent bloodied weapon. Wish there was a perk for dual wielding pistols and SMGs so we could go full John Woo.
---
Nah, NV had some really good  weapon and armor choices. Just gimme Ulysses's duster, Joshua Graham's armor and .45 pistol. I would completely respec into a pistol build.
---
Shhhh don't tell people to take Sunshine.... that's my go-to workshop lol
---
Well yeah..
---
Actually I think they should leave it as it is. Part of the fun in grinding for chems is knowing where to find the ingredients.  I can usually get 30 to 50 disease cures or rad shields or whatever it is I'm trying to farm in less than an hour.  Hint, don't make the forest version of the disease cure.  Always use green thumb, super duper, and chemist.
---
I assume people don't realize INT gives bonus xp?
---
thnx
---
Sorry for bothering you this long after the post, but any ideas on grenades?
---
I stick with building group. The event bonus doesn’t compare to what I get farming
---
It does. I put the crystalizing barrel on my ts ffr cryo and It works wonders. If you ever find one it is top ier no matter what any one says.
---
Because if it was enabled the sub would be full of stupid pictures and videos of peoples camps, memes etc. That have nothing to do with the purpose of this sub.
---
Like I said, I don't play NW. Just read lots of comments suggesting it could be the reason. I think its just a random bug that affects people in different ways and everyone is scrambling to come up with theories on why its happening.
---
I wasn't trying to circumvent it I'm just trying to find a way to catch up
---
is this for a refund for a item i purchased with my atoms of the currency itself?
---
I've already suggested the re-creation of the watoga-underground arena
---
You can find the actual guy who became the first rank 1 overseer of vault 51 out in the world dead. His story is actually pretty crazy if you look it up.
---
Fallout is rad.
---
 Well when it comes to radiation rumble..Lmao no i know when you die the npcs can take your legendary weapons. You have fun.
---
As a bloodied build myself (xbox) I have this same hate for instantly killing legendaries. I instead carry a western revolver to get some hits but not wipe out enemy altogether.
---
It was his first he probably didn't realize that's how most people do it
---
It was done to avoid having the sub become a meme hellhole. You can still share pictures and videos by posting a link in the body of a text post.
---
Had this problem last night, I was the only one running ore, everyone else just standing on the platforms shooting at both hallways for XP. I've had enough of that garbage...I went to the end of one of the tunnels and killed all of the ghouls before they make it to the entrance so they get half as much XP. People need to learn.
---
Why does it seem like the higher level a person gets, the more a person becomes a dick?
---
I have that function turned on and there are still several events that I have to manually go into the pip boy and toggle to active. Swarm of Suitors and Heart of the Swamp never ever come up on my screen even after joining the events. I always have to toggle them active.
---
I’ve never actually even seen an underground camp in the wild, actually! I’ve seen videos, but I have yet to see one in game.
---
I understand. Im fairly new to Fallout 76 though. What is the purpose of this sub exactly?
---
Dang, that sucks. I’m only at level 32. I missed a few days last week. I really hope they add more opportunities for score.
---
Hypocrite we have a game mode for that people enjoy yet the rest of you sleaze balls want it gone ven thou you guys dont even play it. It is like you can't even stand the other people exsiting
---
I would really like it if there was more stuff as rewards. Like dont get me wrong i like all the materials and stuff as ranks but like. A heftyyyy chunk of the rewards are materials or currency as opposed to unique skins and camp which would be cooler imo
---
Im at 100. Got everything.
---
Justvlike small pox
---
Oh yes. Nothing to do with r/fo76 when those camps are only available in FO76. Makes sense. 
---
What would be better is to take a look at r/TF2 and r/tf2shitposterclub. r/TF2 still allows pictures and videos, but they have to be on quality and not low effort except for one day out of the week. That would be much, much better for this sub.
---
I know this not what you asked but at lvl 15 go to a ski lodge and find a ski sword.  It is a game changer and you’ll appreciate melee too.  2-3 ranks in gunsmith and white knight will help, not sure when white knight becomes available though.
---
I'm up to about 16k missing points. Good thing I spent time grinding to 54 otherwise I'd be more pissed.
---
Ah a known issue? So doubt it will be resolved then.......
---
I do log out then log in, and they are all dead still most of the time. Then i try again and half of them are dead. It literally takes me 3 log out and login attempts for them to repopulate. 
---
Its annoying since ya know. I pay £11.99 for this service.
---
perk cards your best friend
---
I have provided all relevant math and exactly what values the bonuses apply to in the link. If anyone doesn't understand it, I would recommend re-reading.
---
I was getting 2,992 xp every spawn last night at a Line in the Sand, with Herbivore, Cranberry Relish, Double Xp (What? Why? Thanks!), and a 3 person building team.
---
Thanks to my survival tent placement, the scorched were spawning in midair above the sonic beacon and we were all going ham with AoE weapons, grandes, and tesla rifles.
---
I went from level 299 to level 303 or 304.  It was great!
---
I dont even want it for the xp, that I dont care for. I just want High radiation fluid since Bethesda made that one in particular rare as shit.
---
That’s gotta be it. I had been scared to try for so long, because I’d never played BR and knew I’d be terrible at it, but it’s actually pretty fun to do every now and again. I’ve even actually managed to kill another player, but I feel a both proud and guilty when I do.
---
Try storing/scrapping her console, put in another ally, and then bring her back.
---
After a game reset, I got her quest back
---
Don't dishonor the Corps.  
---
You WERE in the Marines.  Benedict Arnold was a war hero.  Hiding your lack of scruples behind the uniform is disgraceful.
---
Same is happening to me with Gramps, not sure about other allies.
---
Ya, it isnt. But ya know, Bethesda.
---
Bloodied.
---
You can also respec your characters special points after level 50 so no need to start over.
---
Up to several days.
---
While it is less than an ideal solution, PC players can edit their clientside ini files to hide the long grass that the game uses to hide many of those bodies. Helps with framerate issues on older machines too.
---
Game will look worse, but run better and you wont lose as many loot piles.
---
Just letting you know that theory doesn't hold water. Only theory that I can go by is that Bugthesda requires some bs bug with every update. So far it feels like it's the only one that hasn't been proven wrong.
---
What you know about it baby girl?
---
Damn that is one dedicated griefer.
---
Server hop would be the next thing to do. Usually detaches you from them. If that doesn't work. You can hard block players through the console. You'll never see them again. I did this once with an ex friend who became super toxic. 
---
This is what I found for Xbox one. Scroll past their report info and it has a tutorial for blocking ppl:
---
https://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-xbox-one-reporting-and-blocking
---
Maybe take a picture of their gamer tag so you can find it easily
---
Best advise you can get. Show them you learned.
---
PvP in a Rpg game? sounds about right
---
Wow these are great!
---
TBH I find this laughable. If you nuke whitesprings in a public server. Ah no problem. They will be there. But in a private server which you pay £11.99 a month for, oh no no no, you have to hang around for 15 minutes.
---
Oh alright. Also I was trying to get my refund but I can't find my order number, what should I do?
---
Well it auto completed 4 dailys at 250 each and my score went up by 1000 so yes yes you do. I think people just aren't keeping track of there score. Cuz I bo for a fact I was on lev 49 with 0 score then auto completed 4 then I had 1000 towards my next lev
---
Haha yeah thinks they are on google lololol
---
the quest originally sent you there it has been changed try to find an updated walkthrough
---
edit: it was changed because the new BOS questline is going to be focused around ATLAS
---
Explosive heavy guns are a waste of time, change my mind.
---
The infiltrator model from The Pitt updated for 76 would be sweeeeeet.
---
Haha well If they let us put items on any shelf’s then we wouldn’t have to do to all this 😂
---
Big enough to not make an ass of myself questioning people's brains when I can't spell simple words properly.
---
Yup you should still be able to tank some melee attacks.
---
Im sad man ive lost count of how many last minute event reward snipes because of that non responsive click
---
Due to the way the game manages armor, once your damage progresses past a certain point, the penetration from the power fist starts to become worthless and the base hit of the two weapons evens out.
---
Powerfist, Deathclaw gauntles, and bear arm all end up being very close to one another.
---
Thank you 😊
---
I accidentally put the poor mother f’er down during Tea Time, was using VATs toward the tower pump and he was spawned under the power tower behind it. Popped him with a level 5 Somerset Special on a new alt. Poor guy.

They’ve been doing this.
---
Eh i always jack my prices up. Shit still sells so might as well never have to worry about caps
---
Like some fucking idiot is going to raid a legitimate silo...
---
Why dosent that make sense
---
Did you hover over each one and expand it. The emotes are specific to each slot I believe. Like my salute is with the default wave.
---
Tbh I’ve read it many times and what you’re saying makes no sense, you get +4 intelligence when you’re in a fully bonded team
---
The pie machine gives +100 mental luck
---
Oh really??? I was trying to search up if that happens at lvl 50 but I guess I didn’t search hard enough hahaha but I’m glad I asked here cause i just reached lvl 48 on my main
---
Not only the camper, some other camp objects like the staircase also suffer from the 'objects teleporting on top' bug which has been around since last summer
---
Yes. It has. -180 RR.
---
I get this occasionally rather than the normal 100.  Not complaining either since my minigun blows through the crap.
---
Everything, child, everything.
---
I can actually answer that (I study psychology). Power (of any kind) is known to actually change the way your brain is wired and lower your ability to empathize. (Although you can be resilient against the change if you like.)
---
So, if you were already prone to being kind of a turd before, imagine when you're a specced out level 300 with god tier guns and not much to do.
---
That sucks!  I've had it happen were I was still looting bodies and not paying attention and one of my team leaves/reenters and I'd surrounded by new group of bloated ghouls.
---
You kinda implied it yourself fam. Rather than creating a new thread to "spread awareness" share this on an existing post if you feel you need to speak out. It creates a unified voice rather than a bunch of tint seperate ones.
---
90% of the players in the game have traded or picked up something from the map did they are unsure of the origins of. Think about the poor sap that grinds his ass off, ends up with a bloodied minigun that he can't use because he's not a heavy gunner. Should he be banned because he traded it to someone else for a fixer that he had no idea was duped? As far as I'm aware, everything in my inventory is legit. But I have no idea where 50% of it originated from. I could be banned tomorrow if Bethesda thought like the OP. I'm just not into gloating and laughing at The misfortune of others, even if they were stupid and brought it upon themselves. Karma is a bitch.
---
Wich level are you ?
---
Because those lag worse than trying to run internet explorer on dialup.
---
imo we could use a gardening/farming/camp "dlc"/update.  make it a "minor" part of a major update set and pair it in with a bug fix focused update
---
i would kill to grow cranberries in my camp instead of having  to wait for the 255? item limit before i can harvest wild ones again. 
---
throw in maybe hydroponic's, sprinklers (passive buff grow speed), flowering plants (looks nice), some new outfits, "farmhouse" decor, release some new plants/recipes, add a new farming related event (iirc we only have the one by billings homestead?)
---
What part don't you understand then?
---
Cool
---
Releasing 3rd quarter of next year. Wearing it will cancel out your ap regen, and your carry weight will be reduced to 100lbs.

Build a water purifier or 2  also.

I did a guided meditation solo this AM and after I killed the 3 ghouls attacking the bridge speaker, that was it.  No other ghouls for 4 minutes.
---
I think you're over thinking this dude.
---
This is Bethesda we're talking about. A dev that can't even release a patch without reintroducing previously "fixed" bugs almost without fail or release new things seemingly untested given how mind-boggling &amp; obvious some of the issues are.
---
Sometime sb bugs out and refuse to land, dont know if this can happend to queen aswell. Been tanking her since 3 months after launch and way to get her down have always been stand at her feet when flyaround loop stops. Maybe that have changed since I went shotgun/heavy gun since wasteland launch.

imagine how sad yo granddaddy is in his grave thinkin bout how 2 generations down his genes became a skinny memein skinnyjean wearin pimply keyboard warrior. Probably think he shoulda bust in yo grannys ass instead. Guan bout yah business eslwa maiyute

It should clear after two days, at least for me it did.
---
Imagine if the fallout 76 nuke codes just happened to be the IRL nuke codes, and the state of panic the NSA agents must be in when seeing hundreds of people typing "nuke codes" the same day and getting the actual nuke codes.
---
idk what that does
---
That would be me.   
---
How do I move my camp without loosing what I invested in the structures?
---
Theres a funny glith you can do to make an partially inaccessible floor. Just make a normal floor with a staircase going uo to the next floor and some flooring built above the floor your on. Make a staircase that goes into a floor above so that you cant go up and then delete the original staircase. Now you have a useless staircase and a hole in the roof that only people with marsupial can get to.

SS armor shits on PA
---
I run a bloodied PA build and love it. I tried reverting to using my full unyielding set this week (to maximize double XP) and just felt so squishy.
---
You just need to wait after filing a ticket. If it starts to take more than 3-4 days, just submit another one. They'll reply eventually.
---
Was added pre sheepsquatch. They actually tried back then. Like the ”hidden” content type more then the announced. (Atleast when it comes to this game).
---
Its in the base game in 3 and nv im pretty sure
---
Thanks for this!

I want to say that "Special" ones are the top leftish and you have to press RS on the Xbox to expand the menu.

I rather them work on fixing the actual game and be release fixes for duping methods XP glitches and game breaking bugs rather then be worrying about my bungalow walls 🤷‍♂️

Auto-correct did you dirty fam

Tag everything in uranium fever and sell all the weapons.

Now this is talent that i wish i had but just don't. So keep on doing this. Cause these are amazing.

They'll usually either find a ton of stuff to enjoy looking at, or disgusted.

That's maybe more complicated than i expected, you checked in your special and cards and still have only 1 luck right ? I never met this issue sorry.
---
This happens atleast in the scenario when a super mutant picks up a minigun that fell from his buddy using one after you kill it. First user has 100, second 500. Why? Who knows. Being happening since launch.
---
Honestly, I dont care about xp, or legendaries. Either I can get other ways. I just want High radiation fluid. Since Bethesda decided that thats the one thats uber rare, unlike the other 2 which takes up shit tons of space in your stash.
---
I dont want to even waste a keycard nuking whitesprings. But the queen literally never gives me crimson flux, the one I actually need.
---
Just like she has NEVER given me emergency protocols or calibrated shocks for Ultracite. Ah well, Bethesda has to skew the RNG right? Cus RNG in itself aint enough.
---
Money sellers (dupers) never use their main account, they make tons of "mule" accounts instead. This time around I do not believe their were innocents. Just stupid people reading about a public dupe and getting caught.  
---
 On Xbox their were a lot of I'll call them robin hoods duping for fun and dropping them for people. I was just smart and never took more than 1, I wasn't banned and I know they are illicit and I use them. Granted I have a few pure legacies including a couple I didn't know were.
---
&gt;Just remove bloodied from the game at this point...
---
And then people will complain about junkie builds one shoting or melting legendaries.
---
Issue isn't the builds, it's the fact that the legendary item is tied to the creature rather than the event.
---
I have no idea what you’re trying to say. But I’m gonna assume you want caps in order to buy gold bullions. 
---
Kill enemies and collect their weapons and armor. Go to the train vendors and sell it to them. You can sell up to 1,400 caps worth of items every 20 hours. 
---
If you have any legendary weapons or armor that you don’t use or want. Try to sell them to other players. 
---
Do as many quests and events you can do so you can get rewarded caps.
---
What armor and mutations are you using?
---
Its ok thank you for responding tho🙂
---
Nerfing it sounds more viable tbh.
---
&gt;Why would someone speak up about a problem that's not theirs and they have no experience with it?
---
This mentality is dangerous, think about what you just said and how that can be applied to literally anything else. Bethesda also knows about this issue, they know about fast travel bugs and not being able to shoot or attack, server lag, Adrenaline being broken, rubber banding, etc... They are working to fix it. Do I think they should take so long to do so? Hell no! Do I understand though that they probably have a limited team working on these things and it takes time? Yeah, and that's why I stick around.
---
Theres a peperoni roll of the waywards counter? I never saw it
---
Idk if this helps, but when I do Riding Shotgun (And I do it A LOT) I use a JFFR Radium Rifle since it's mostly humans who are susceptible to radiation. I got my JFFR Radium for like only 5k caps and that was before the duping crisis. And if you're on Xbox I'd be happy to give you a 1* Junkies handmade, which is a pretty good weapon for someone without super good gear
---
The maps online arent accurate at all. His path has been updated a bunch because ive seen him in the mire, toxic valley, and even the bog. I rember looking at a few maps and it said he barely makes it out of the forest.  Hes around, just stick to the roads
---
It doesn’t have to be bloodied FYI, some glitched weapons such as limb damage and 33 Vats can do this to the imposter sheep if the ROF is high enough. I tested this before and it worked.
---
What did u get?
---
Seems like a no brainer to me. I'm just starting out so have bern playing exclusively by myself til I get settled and comfortable but even then I always form a team just for the extra little boost to xp. Wasn't sure it would work with just me and sure I only end up with the singular buff but hey better than nothing. Lol.
---
I've been a little confused though. Longtime Fallout player so I assumed Intelligence increases xp gain but I haven't seen that explicitly stated anywhere in game yet.
---
Amazing man!! What a cool shots!! 😃😃😃👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
---
Is it bass like synth bass or an acoustic bass like the in game instrument?
---
Synth bass is from the nuclear winter thing normally.  Even if you report it you won't get banned for making or going into an underground camp.  It's been a thing forever and they have never tried patching it out that I remember, they obviously don't seem to care about people building underground.  Also even if you report it, 99.99999 percent chance they will do nothing to help you get rid of it.
---
They really were dedicated, it was confusing.
---
I know to switch servers now in case this happens again. Thanks for all the help, I’ll read through the info!
---
There are no "nuke codes" in the world so i think youre safe xD
---
I run 6 water purifiers to get my cap collection up.
---
sell it for 1K or trophy it
---
Same! I put like 8 farming tiles next to the vendors and the water pumps are right on the sides of the farm tiles. My crafting floor of my house is available to anyone with a sink in it, so if anyone's starving or thirsty they have the means to make food. Figured I had to have it available to people since I have a low level vendor now, just trying to make new players feel welcomed and become part of our community. We could use the player count in this game lol
---
i think the adventure mode xp we get from nuclear winter should count, otherwise i have only incentive to do the daily and go back to adventure mode to get more xp
---
That was not because of bloodied weapon. That was someone using bugged "magic" weapon.
---
Twink refers an alt character that has been given tons of high level/bis gear for their level. Not really something that can be done in fo76
---
Or both.
---
Perfect I’ll try that when I next log in. Cheers
---
Yep, tired of no building teams, and nobody joining mine. Ah well. I still get an extra intelligence point. And the buff from herd mentality. Thank god.
---
Basically this. Also instead of nerfing because everyone on this sub has the “if I don’t have it nobody can have it” mentality, why not buff the other builds? Make them viable?
---
Perhaps.
---
Ill do this from now on. I have been so hyper focused on legendary board game i haven't had a chance to research colossus.
---
Last night I just kept running over the two train bridges leading in and out of the Charleston station and he kept spawning on the northern one.
---
You just "got" a legacy? Make sure you enjoy it because bethesda is banning players for that. Good luck!
---
I think I did but maybe pressing wrong button. I’ll try again when I next log in. Cheers
---
Save it.  Put it on a mule if you need the room.  There is a market for it, but only sell if you’re sure bloody or melee will never be your thing.  It sucks remembering back to that awsome weapon you let go for chump change.
---
Wdym
---
Jizz that has been sitting in a coconut as is reddit tradition.
---
I didn't think I would like it but ended up enjoying it.  Killed 2 people my very first match and finished 11th with my level 0 character too.  Ended up being easier than I thought it would be after waiting in a lobby with all these level 100+ players.
---
I also like having the bass bug when I go back to adventure.  It's FUNKY TIME!!
---
Anything and everything that ever comes out for a ‘limited time’ will most likely return with a discount. Sometimes they even come out new and have a discount which isn’t really a discount. If you don’t want to pay the atoms they are asking for wait a month or two. Been playing since day 1 and have seen everything return to the shop at some point
---
You can only move 1 point per level. I wouldn't call it respec. It takes time. 
---
Also 2 handed weapons will almost always out perform one handed.
---
I dont mind, as long as I get the 4x bonus they can do what they want
---
I don't think dupers will ever be entirely banned from this game.
---
Forewarning: The scrap box will spoil you.
---
Bloodied lazar rifle explode for area dmg and 15% faster reload

I am only familiar with the jizz box

I think of it as free food

Lmao I never had the bug and I know reddit can't help but the more noise you make the sooner they'll fix it.

If you're annoyed don't come on the subreddit

"Oh look I'm such a selfish guy you're annoying me with your problems, they're not my problems so I don't care"

I have a bloody melee character, but she's  perked for 1 hand. Thinking about justbgrinding some lvls so i can perk her for 2 hand and see which i prefer
---
Gold.👍
---
How do you know about that? I guess you built up an immunity to after we used it on you so many times.
---
I mean, er,  what amnesia gun
---
Honestly this. 
---
My main issue is that item grab limit. I swear I've grab a ton of things, but even a whole day later I cant reharvest my usual run. 
---
It either needs to be less or have a reset like daily's. Even if they just did this with plants. Bc world drops are different.
---
See? Thank you. Wondering when someone would say it
---
Bloodied strength build, full unyielding and backpack weight mods, 3 star bloodied combat knife serrated, 1 star super sledge, 2 3 star bloody shotguns explosive bashing and vats chance 33%,a instigating ffr ultracite Gatling laser and a 3 star bloody AA explosive crossbow lol because it go boom
---
No they do not, only Atom rewards are on the Legendary Run board itself. But the increments of 20 is odd.
---
Also how to build nuclear bomb or where to find plans for nuke is also good red flags to all kind of domestic and foreign security services.
---
Look, I did a little test myself 
---
I killed a level 14 scorched for 117 xp 
---
I then killed a level 14 scorched but took mentats before, which gave me a +1.72 intelligence boost, and gained 120xp 
---
So intelligence does boost xp 
---
So if you add +4 intelligence through the building team you get a buff worth 4 intelligence points
---
People are basically doing it for karma at this point, along with questions/rants about being banned.
---
Means something TOTALLY different to me...and much better! ;-)
---
Your telling me that I should be curious about the "Flowers By Irene" van sat outside my house for months? 🤔
---
There are as many of these posts as the wrongfully banned posts. Perhaps I should make a post protesting these posts about those posts.
---
This game is broken, duping has been here forever and it can barley be called an exploit anymore, but a Todd Howard stapled feature. 
---
Many people who have dupes didn’t get banned and are running around just fine. You sound jelly.
---
Maybe if they could glitch through all the doors it would be more viable
---
Ive noticed even in my chinesse stealth suit sense the update has been more noticable not bye alot but a bit
---
Not that i'm aware of, but I trust these guys, and the dataminer in particular on this sort of stuff cause he's the one who told me patch 20 broke Gunsmith and White Knights durability drain reduction effects
---
To trash Bethesda and complain about being banned for duping.
---
...but the sulphur fountain...
---
Yup. With the grinding and the fact I got my build done early on my second toon, I have about 120 level ups ready to go in case I wanna change in one go. 
---
Also I'm saving perk card packs because even though the new legendary perks are a bit away yet, I still wanna maximize them.
---
Emergency Protocols + Life Giver 4, your solution for everything expect poison-over-time damage.  My favorite build is my low health, power armor, heavy guns.   I sell far more stimpaks than I use.  I’m usually in X01, but I’m not sure it matters.  My Excavator works just fine as well.
---
kind of bring storage space issue back full circle...
---
Yes. Plus each level up beyond 50 means you can either pick a card or move a point. Will come in handy when you switch from ex. strength build to per/agi build...
---
Because you have to fight lag to use a Cola.
---
Bloodied isn’t the issue here. If someone is one-shotting the Imposter it’s because they have a bugged “Magic” weapon or stacked something crazy. A non-glitched bloodied build isn’t doing that. Maybe a melee if they stack a bunch of stuff, but melees are pretty rare at Encryptid.
---
Just remember to wait till 50 to do the wayward questline so the leg to get at the end will be max levand I think ( dont no for sure but think it's better chance for good rolls)  Had a kid I was helping and he finished the wayward and got TSE handmade but it was lev 15, which is weird cuz I swore tse was nerfed out
---
I search FO76 launch codes. Isn't that what its called in game anyways? Not sure since ive only done it twice.
---
Was barely gonna say delete this, nvm
---
Sell ammo for a cap
---
Yeah, an extra ten pounds. Whoopty shit.
---
What exactly did he do wrong? Glitch through a door?
---
They're already watching me. At least till I launch one outside the game lol
---
Nope, I hope people continue spamming it and it lights a fire under bugthesda's ass. Don't like it? don't open the threads. You don't get to dictate what is posted around here.
---
Absolutely. Keep in mind that until you find the proper gear you may not do as much damage as intended
---
As stated in the link, Int. does boost XP... I'm scratching my head at what you're confused about... Is it the math? I can explain any part of it in a way you'll hopefully understand. Just clarify what exactly you're confused about.
---
The first time, I did learn some, just thinking I had stumbled across someone's generosity, and just took the ones I didn't know. 
---
Because I am generous in game, by making armor and weapons for new players and dropping them around Flatwoods and such. Today for the modify 5 armor challenge, I made a full set of heavy leather, modded it, completed the challenge and stuck them in the Overseers' stash and the tool box at her camp near the Wayward. And if you look at past posts, I've talked about doing this for a long time. 
---
When I find mods for weapons in the world, I make a low level version and attach the mod. But just some weapons, like electrified hatches, flaming pitchforks, and bladed golf clubs. I think those are hilarious weapons to start with. 
---
The second time when there was over 600, with like 50 Crash Santa's, I realized what it was, so yeah, I dumped them in the river. 
---
I'm not a needy player, and I enjoy earning things in game. If you just get everything free or without earning them, kind of takes away the fun of playing the game, I feel. 
---
So first time, yes I learned the plans for the icicle lights, and several mounted heads.
---
Well then we might as well call god mode a feature as well then huh? That rationale is just idiocy, it is an unintended feature as proven by bethesda's action in banning these people, I've been playing since beta and have legitimately traded for every weapon I could possibly desire, so no I'm not jealous, just glad that lazy ass is who put in zero work get punished for it.
---
I like that idea. It'd be a nice Qol update
---
Every point is great except the first, someone did the [math](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a142sh/bulking_junk_does_not_save_you_stash_space_but_it/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and turns out you don't save much space from bulking everything excluding aluminum and lead.
---
Not saying bulking is bad though, sell the excess bulk you don't need to either NPC vendors or through your own.
---
I have an Instigating, SS Grognaks Axe that I just love for farming Whitespring or Morgantown nukes.  Normally I’m heavy guns.  Switching out perk cards for the farm is great to save ammo.
---
Foodbuilds start think they hot shit when they get ahold of duped weapons or hacked weapons. Actually had a long convo with a foodie the other night because he said he only uses his hacked .50 when he's getting his ass kicked. BF and I gave him recs, etc, to improve and not rely on hacked nonsense.
---
That's what I've been doing. I have a LOT loaded and ready to use, but there's nothing really atm that I want to use them for, so I'm saving them for whenever legendary perks are available.
---
More like AOL haha
---
Eh. Who can say. Players often yell and scream and threaten and most of them get over it till the next thing. For some players, being angry and making threats is like a job.
---
I will keep my eyes open!  Happy to hear I won't need to swap my perks out to use one effectively.
---
There are still some regular challenges that award atoms, but the dailies and weeklies no longer  give them.
---
But it's been the same gameplay, the challenges that are available right now are the easiest you'll probably see, they could have made them hell of alot harder in hopes people buy rank ups.... Yes it can get stale, but demanding a level a day doesn't equal content, it just activates the feel good chemicals in your brain. Tbh half the rewards on the gameboard, I'd rather have the atom rewards from dailies back, I'd probably get hell of alot more cosmetics that way. The captain cosmos power armor would have probably been a 1200 atom set or so, the fireplace door would be like 500 or so atoms, etc. Over the time this event is running, I could probably make enough atoms from the old dailies to buy the shit on the board twice over. You just seem to be upset that it went from a reward a day to an actual grind for the end of the board stuff. If you wanna complain about something, complain about the content that's actually being given to you, not the time gate on it. Wait to see how underwhelming the final board stretch is, the planetarium item? It doesn't even project anything, just sits there as a rotating, very very tiny, lamp thing. The dark matter PA? The white set has 2x more detail to it. The captain cosmos armors? Just two recolors of the original suit you can get already. The atomic PA paints and ghillie camos could have been a single bundle unlock each on the board. Should I continue?
---
 I think you get libby and carver at one side. Then the other 2 at the other side of the tunnel. Could be wrong, probably wrong
---
People are dumb and think that you HAVE to socialize when on a team, and you know how anti-social some people on this game can be.
---
Also, please let us snap those diagonal half walls anyplace a regular half wall can. I love those things for making interesting looking structures, but I can't really use them anywhere. Not really sure what they are for in this implementation, besides making half walls of two different types??
---
You get the token but u dont have to claim it till 50 right?
---
i dont think they ever really said. it seems to be around 2k pre level and you get this for
---
Time survived	+4 XP / minute.
---
Players killed	+20 XP / player.
---
Players downed	+10 XP / player.
---
AI kills	+5 XP / kill.
---
Elite AI kills	+20 XP / kill.
---
Nukes launched	+50 XP / nuke.
---
Revives	+20 XP / revive.
---
for the best results. learn the ways of the bush wookie... hide in a bush. dont move dont look around sit still. and let all the others kill them selves. make it ot the top 10 and you got almost 800xp during double xp weekends.
---
it is really hilarious when they think that a single weapon will play the entire game for them, even with hacked weapons doing insane amounts of damage it is still a black-and-white issue of dealing the damage to your target, stealthiness and proper tactics always play a heavy roll.
---
I don't think you're gonna get the game you want here tbh pal. It maybe better to move onto greener pastures because unfortunately Bethesda would sooner add more shite cosmetics to grind for than fun and fair PvP gameplay.
---
I probably weigh more than you lol. And I doubt you would say that to my face😂😂😂😂
---
A stranger entering your silo is pottentially there to steal the launch from you. If that doesnt matter to you then whatever but if you need to nuke somewhere specific you wana make sure noone fucks with you
---
If you play melee, save it! Thing's a BEAST!
---
If not, trade it for something more to your liking.
---
Craft serums and sell them to vendors. You'll hit 1400 caps pretty quick.
---
It's more the matter of we were already in the process of running it and he brushed past us, cheated his way through and shot at my wife. 
---
Considering running a silo is part of a quest line and there are two other silos he could have run I consider it a dick move and no smartass reply from you will convince me otherwise.
---
But they're working on it and that's good enough for me.
---
I still use it to place the windmill generator on non-dirt areas
---
I mean, none of those have been solved ultimately so you’re not getting anything, I guess.
---
Also, that line of thinking is dangerous as it sets a very dangerous precedent where they can get away with anything “minor”. And they have.
---
So they kinda exhaust the server?
---
I just love you Bethesda haters that can't seem to ever stop playing their games. And if you say you don't play their games anymore or since whatever Title was your last. That's even worse. Cause you can't let it go and just go be happy.
---
I know what you mean, stupid thing keeps walking into my Grognaks Axe... Repeatedly!
---
God mode had been Patched out the game. You wouldn’t have made a post if you didn’t care. Not all the “lazy asses” got punished. 
---
Congrats traded for every weapon you have, odds are something you traded for was dupped and now you had an Easier access to it. 
---
You sound like a teachers pet, and when other kids misbehave you’ll stuck your tongue out and make an L with your hand on your fore head. 
---
It’s a game, lost of people got banned for cheating and lots of people didn’t. Get a grip and calm down .
---
Equip, change and unequip weapons ad infinitum until it lets you out.
---
How you’re saying that the building team doesn’t produce the 8%xp buff 
---
I then just killed a lvl 14 scorched not part of a building team (before was in a team of 3) and this went down to 107 xp, thats a bigger difference then the mentats xp buff gave
---
Exactly! Events like this, especially that require cooperation that means that not all participants will be free to get a shot in on legendaries (like the hero ore-gatherers in Radiation Rumble) should drop rewards like Faschnacht did. That way, the folks that are helping also benefit, and there's less incentive to ignore objectives to spam mobs and legendaries.
---
I'm glad we were able to help! Hopefully it doesn't happen again. ♡♡
---
Shit I don't care if it's hot pink or shit brown, I just don't want it showing up on my vendor list. Even though I'm careful it gives me anxiety
---
I guess if you feel that because you’re in a silo that you now own it then okay, maybe the guy was just trying to get the launch done for you sooner.
---
Once u hit 50 every level after u can choose a perk card so have to get to 50 I’m afraid
---
You don’t stop getting points till 50 and you can still get new cards
---
You left out the shot at your wife part in your post lol
---
The weeklies. Which is the basis I'm going off of for progress; 10% each week for 10 weeks.
---
Use the shoulder buttons to pick the card you want.  Picking a stat doesn’t lock you into a card from that stat.
---
let me guess, junkie tesla rifle build with 24/7 bunny hop. Am I right?
---
Woopsie!
---
Well I'm only saying this cause both legion and talon are gone now and thats like four hundred thousand players gone now
---
Wrong again, god mode is still in the game. you're not going to sit here and justify people's actions, if duping took place in the past obviously I'm going to obtain these weapons and take advantage of the situation. It doesn't mean the game should be flooded with more of these weapons. And it should not be that easy to obtain then it should have to require hard work.

Actually no I prefered bffr handmade and catching people with plasmas when they stopped chugging
---
keep 50 or less of everything that can't be bulked (ie has a sell value) you don't need it.  Acid, aluminum, lead I never sell.  The rest bulk and sell down to 50.  One run of Westek with scrapper is over 400 steel.  You can get the rest very easy.  I'm a heavy weapons / str build so I have 1000 to 2000 lbs of weapons so I run bear arms and keep most of them on me.  I also keep too much food so through hiker is a must.  I run the chemist back pack mod so I don't need that perk (this is a waste on my part but part of my RP)

Agreed. Did Uranium Fever and three low levels just dicked around while a legendary miner pummeled me. I was waiting for them to hit him up while I watched my healthbar wither slowly. Finally said fuggit and dinged the miner. Quit complaint and be active!
---
Wrong threat... dunno how i messed that up.
---
It's not a huge amount, but there's steady income from selling purified water. It requires no effort really on your part, either, just a periodic trip to your base to clear your collecters every few minutes or so and then run it in to a vendor. It's a good method for steady (but not huge) income.
---
Yea I believe so
---
One of us... One of us...
---
Ahahaha just imagine the top secret meetings about the 5000% increase in nuke codes or nuke west virginia searches.
---
See adding paint increases my anxiety lol. If I accidentally click on drop and click wrong button its gone forever instead of just on the ground. But the look outweighs the anxiety.
---
After level 50, for each level, you will be able to choose EITHER: any card of your choosing; or the option to re-arrange your skill points. Levels fly by once you get the hang of the game at like level 70-80 and you'll have more points than you can handle. I wouldn't bother rerolling.
---
Well I'm gonna stay for the pve aspects but id at least like a challenge
---
gabba goobo, gabba goobo
---
Its not even in adventure mode. If you glitch inside its just a door infront of rocks
---
I'm just planning to load it up as much as I can. Thankfully I never really seem to use much of anything so I imagine it will last nearly forever.
---
YES!!! In fact I would pay ATOMS for grow-able wild plants, especially cranberries and firecaps at my camp.
---
I've honestly never even noticed their names all of them always die so quick and I don't give a fuck about any of them.
---
where are you getting your numbers from?
---
You need to build for power armor its can be absolutely amazing if you build correctly for it
---
respect+, upvoted
---
where is the map with the writing on it located?
---
Forbidden snack
---
I shouldn’t reddit on an empty stomach.
---
I didn't even think of that, but I also make it a point to scrap any weapons or armor instead of dropping them. Everything I use is legendary so I can just spam scrap.
---
That porta potty idea is straight oit of the men in black cartoon form the early 2000, and I love it. 
---
The trick to getting below the map is to find a spot with overlapping textures, look for where the ground or grass has a seam, and then place a foundation about 6 ft off of it and then have stairs going downwars towards the seam.
---
But u have to bound first before getting the full reward ( +4int).
---
Though learning the icicle lights certainly did up my game and make like a god.
---
I got messeged today after doing one of these posts and got helped out. They asked me a few things to try fixing that issue.
---
Thank you I’ll remember for next time, I restarted my game after a few minutes
---
I took that as a snide comment and it didn't cross my mind that it could have been an honest question.  Apologies if I misunderstood.
---
As someone else said. When you pick a special point you can change what perk card you get. So picking INT you can tab over to strength perks and pick one.
---
Also at level 50 you can chose between moving one special point to another or picking a perk card.
---
I stopped playing for about a year so never actually was around for 2xp
---
That is from the Responder's Command inside the Morgantown Airport.
---
Hey man i dont really run them thats just the consensus ive gotten from ther players. Like ive even tried to go help random people out and just be an extra gun. I usually end up getting angry emotes and threats of getting the nuke dropped on my camp. Jokes on then im right outside of foundation :)
---
You don’t have to choose a card from the stat you increase. 
---
Raise up another stat by 1. Then at the card selection screen, cycle to the other categories until you get to Strength. Choose one of the Strength perk cards. 
---
You can do this at any level up from 2-50. My last alt increased Strength at level 2 but selected Pharma Farma as the perk card.
---
Yes, but as leader you can change so the whole team benefits.
---
This is the answer right here. I didn't learn about this until I was level 60, so already too late.
---
To elaborate, pick the stat you'd like to increase, and then use the shoulder buttons to choose an actual Perk card from any stat.
---
That and as others have said, you can move SPECIAL points and continue to get perk cards past 50
---
/r/beetlejuicing
---
Yes! The real suggestions are always in the comments.
---
Incorrect. 
---
You don’t have to choose a card from the stat you increase.
---
Raise up another stat by 1. Then at the card selection screen, cycle to the other categories until you get to Strength. Choose one of the Strength perk cards.
---
I can’t send a ticket without an order number, but I can’t find the order number. I haven’t bought any atoms, I’ve earned all them, is that why it’s not showing any orders? I’m guessing I won’t be able to get a refund then too.
---
That or atleast put cutouts pointing to the entrance, I have seen a few people do this at whitsprings and it is great.
---
Hey, I usually just sell mine to vendors when I get too many to carry. 
---
I make some nuka quantum grenades and sold them in my vendor for 25e and they sold out.
---
sounds like you're just a dirty griefer the guy was simply trying to see if you wanted to do PVP, and then you go and nuke is base. the teabagging just cements the idea that you're probably 16 and don't even have a wife, it was probably your buddy who was with you.
---
If you want a challenge, you can attempt a berserker, but don’t expect the same damage output as something like Junkie or Bloodied
---
Lol talk about over exaggerating the issue.
---
The water wheel was broken. It got fixed.
---
Nuke Cola Lamp is Broken they've made a response say they are aware of the issue and a fix will come.
---
They do their best with what they are given. They send out fixes for Dupes and glitches as fast as possible. Always bringing new content. Free items. People still complain. It's because of the day and age we live in where everyone feels so entitled to everything and anything. No one owes you anything. Don't want the atome shop item? Don't buy it its optional cosmetic. They will fix it eventually or maybe it meant to be like that who knows. Not us we aren't the developers. Do we know what kind of stress and workload they are put under? No we are not the developers. 
---
Best thing you can do is to get informed, stop feeling such entitlement and realize these are massive companies and the devs are most likely not only working on one game. They aren't sitting there waiting for you to ring the bell. Have some respect amd understanding. Only so much can be done so quickly. Don't expect people to bend over backwards for you this is real life not a video game.
---
Junkies? Trying to go without mutations?
---
No worries. It's just another of those wonderful little glitches 🤣
---
Their previous active player count they had face book pages with hundreds of thousand of players on them and when i checked tues day there was like 30 people between the 2
---
So you benefit from the dupers... yet squeal an excitement that they get banned??? Like what. 
---
Many of the weapons that were dupped were patched a long time ago(explosive energy weapons) 
---
I bet when you get your hands on one now with legacies being more easily obtained you’ll have no problems making fun of them. Cognitive dissonance much? 
---
You can’t make fun of people then benefit from their actions with out seeing the hypocrisy that it’s “bad for the game”
---
I got mine a couple days ago! 🥰 its so cute
---
Ah good one, thanks!
---
Ah ok. Been a long long time since I was sub level 50. There u go. Either way u don’t have to make a new toon
---
Nocturnal build and refuse to go out in the daylight.  If an event runs into morning you have to leave before that.  Be the night.
---
Ah, a person can dream cant they
---
Shadowed Light leather, and no mutations currently.  
---
It was never an issue before, but even on my character with 12 AGI, stand fast, and 2 pieces of chameleon gear, stealth feels much less effective.
---
no questions allowed you snide smartass
---
Nah, I'm debating on like a balance between being more Tanky than Damage.
---
So do I. I keep around 30 diluted ones around but 90% of my healing comes from Purified water.
---
I tried it with a friend. They can still switch the pylon even though it’s coded. We tried it teamed and no team still same result. 😔
---
May wana delete this. Its not allowed in this sub.
---
if only i could upvote more than once
---
That's the point: It's not. The objective is last one standing, not most flossing over your murder targets. It's just that unlike every other BR game ever, they reward playing the objective and not being a bunny hopping psycho. Deaths have to happen for someone to win, that's the only way to end the game, but they don't have to happen *right now* and the game actively rewards you for a cautious play style. When  I am being a bush wookie, if I seen a lone target I can take, you bet I murder their ass... but if it's a team, I am better off not taking on two to one odds, and the game *rewards that decision*.
---
damn you're really bad at this, I had over 20 legacies before this even started including the coveted junky explosive laser. I would gladly give up every single weapon I had that was traded for in order for duping to be permanently vanquished from the game, you just sound like the hundreds of other people who want no grind no work to play the game for 1 hour a day and be rewarded with the best of the best.
---
people seem to say this daily on the sub
---
you can have Buttressed AND Dense on the chest - that will make a big difference... they take up different mod slots...
---
I had some really nice ones but they always reset and I no longer take pictures
---
Suggest doing a loop of lucky hole mine and Tanagra town a few times a week before the month is up.  Server hop at Tanagra town for acid from the cave crickets and go through the mine for lead ore to smelt with super duper.  Combine that with scrapping tons of guns with the scrapper perk and load that box up.  Should end up with enough lead and steel to make ammo for a LONG time after cancelling your sub.
---
I did this almost daily and ended with 40,000 of both lead and steel crammed in there before I cancelled.  That will make A LOT of ammo for the foreseeable future.
---
Wrong sub
---
Any idea what is making the pauldron lamps of your PA glow?
---
*ping*
---
If done right the team leader only needs to switch it to an Event team 10 secs before a event ends and then switch it right back to a Building (xp) team. Once a team is bonded there is no bond reset when a team leader changes the type.
---
Oh. Well I've not seen that my bad
---
While it wont get as much damage try unarmed with all +1Str armor or a junkies build.
---
me as well. typically i survive 1 hit . due to armor but the second im done. then i respawn and h gotot eat a little rad laced foods ar get hit. or slip off a high surface and tada nerd rage active. time to get messy
---
You can only start it on one side.
---
I leveled up three times during one Line in the Sand (109-&gt;112) with a Building group. Not even running all the buffs, just Cranberry Relish and Very Well Rested. Building is definitely the way to go.
---
And not everyone plays every fucking day for a year and a half. Anyone above level 100 would be in the high level range.
---
You stopped playing a year ago and your Level 255?
---
Im palying since release and only stopped playing for 5 months before Wastelanders. Nearly 800 Hours Playtime and I think Im around Level 210.
---
Ypu either played a shit ton of times before and XP Grinded the shit out of the game or XP Glitched of some sort.
---
Sounds to me like you lack any sort of sense of humor. I found the whole thing to be quite entertaining. Besides, there's nothing wrong with a little dip dip potato chip from time to time.
---
It's random.
---
I thought I was wrong. Thank you
---
But seriously does *anyone* know anything About those launccch codes?
---
Kinda seems like you're the bad guy in this story OP. This very pointless story.
---
I tried to didn't work
---
Really? To be the leader u have to create the team i guess?
---
lol no worries. this has become a classic in game problem that generates 5 to 10 posts a day + the two like the one we are upon. it's just part of being on reddit ive come to learn lol
---
??? Really¿? Thanks!
---
I dont even use PA on any on my characters but I agree it doesn't make sense I think every PA should have the 100 plus weight and the excavators should have an extra 50 for something, that or just allow backpack to stack with PA
---
I mentioned the one level per day because it really brings into perspective just how hard progress will slow; many people seem to constantly forget that our progress will slow down significantly at later levels. People will mistakenly see people at level 45 and think "we're about halfway done" when rank 45 is only about 30% of the way to 100 in terms of overall point value. I did not bring it up because I was fully expecting a level a day, though your willingness to attack me as if I am leads me to believe you may be one of the people described in my previous comment.
---
And, as others have said, you are mistaken in thinking we'll have 9 dailies every day for the rest of the season.
---
fair enough man do the flames or noise still happen?
---
The only way I like interacting with other players is being in events with them from time to time and buying ammo from them. That’s about it
---
Eugenie is my "Ghirl." I'll escort her any day of the week and twice on Sunday.
---
Dont judge those whose dream are unachievable, at least we have dreams, which is more than some people
---
Maybe not Junkies tbh.
---
No more nerfs.
---
It was absolutely petty and unnecessary and I loved every minute of it. Besides, it's just a game, the whole thing is pointless.
---
It seems like kind of a big issue.
---
I do that. It's a shame about bulking, but in a game that needs the stash, in my opinion, every little helps
---
Oh :(
---
green thumb for double yield harvest.and 30 minutes of farming. then chemist for double yield production + superduper. your swimming in stuff. plus allowing people to grow xp increasing food at their camps isn't quite how they want you to survive.
---
So my special and perks are setup for an unarmed bloody. Lately, I've been running every quest and challenge naked. I only use what I find during the quest, challenge or event. Then I scrap and scrip it all and start over on the next.
---
Killing the 3 large creatures was interesting. I punched the deathclaw to death easy enough by staying behind it. For the behemoth super mutant, I had to pick off his friends to get a weapon to kill him.  
---
It's been fun so far
---
Yeah - I think you’ll get around 30 DR and maybe 25 ER from that 👍🏻👍🏻
---
Thanks for the tips, I'll do that stuff for sure. I've managed to never actually need to craft ammo before between using a bloody build and claiming the munitions factory a lot but it could certainly be handy if I ever want to try out a weapon I don't have ammo saved for.
---
Stealth armor and you take almost no rads.
---
Its not a true nerf though. The xp would still be there, but only if you actually complete the required objectives. 
---
Again, lower the xp from the ghouls, raise the xp from the deathclaws and floaters. Simple
---
Aside from Junkies/Bloodied, my favorite options were Power Fist/Deathclaw/Bear Claw with Instigating plus faster swing speed. 2H best options are sheepsquatch staff and super sledge but are far too slow.
---
Me! Send toe pix
---
There's a difference between a "newbie" and a "noob". Level fifty in this honestly doesn't mean much, there's still plenty to learn after 50. I don't think he meant "newbie" as an insult.
---
These are great!
---
I did find a skeleton in an electric chair.
---
Agreed. I like to build the “peak” of my house by using a diagonal wall against a half window wall against a diagonal wall. Hate that that white trim isn’t on the half wall. 
---
(If you understand what I mean lol)
---
Carnivore based food buffing is very strong right now for melee especially with strange in numbers
---
You mean you want no mutations at all?
---
You can run 15 Strength with all 3 2H melee perks (Slugger) at rank 3, Martial Artist 3 and throw in Blocker, Barbarian or Incisor based on your preference. 
---
Agility has a lot of choices that can help melee, from Action Boy/Girl to Ninja to Marathoner. 
---
Bloody Mess 3 in Luck is a great choice as well. 
---
Get a solid 2H weapon that has something like Instigating or AA, maybe FSS or Bonus Power Attack and you’ve got a very viable base to build from.
---
They don't ever die. I'm not sure you have ever even done the event.
---
Let's get a mooooove on
---
You needed to log in with a Bethesda.net  account when you started playing, right? If you have that account linked to your Steam, or log in to that Bethesda.net account in the Steam version I believe your progress will be transferred, as it is the same account. About the atoms you've collected so far, I'm not really sure, they didn't transferred from Bethesda.net launcher to Steam.
---
I once leveled a guerilla build up to level 50ish, then changed my mind and went a total different route.  Needed about 30 levels to move points and grab the new perk cards - about 1.5 weeks as I recall.   Much faster than starting a new character.  I just kept using that bloodied 10mm pistol until I was fully ready to do the switch.  Then suddenly, at level 85, I became a PA Heavy Guns build.
---
Oh holy crap thank you!!! When I get to lvl 50 can I not increase specials anymore tho?
---
Yes. I had to redeploy my camp unit to get it removed. Wound up completely rebuilding my camp instead of a few quick tweaks.
---
I got clearance from my fbi guy. We’re chill.
---
Yeah I can only play an hour a day or two depending on the circumstances, my life doesn’t revolve around this game. 
---
I only use Reddit now to mostly ask questions regarding this game or another game I play.
---
No one cares that you got your weapons legit, you want a medal or something? 
---
You sound salty that others can get these weapons far easier then you did. 
---
So chill out dude, this game is broken and it probably always will be unless Bethesda can get their shit together and fix the game instead of updating the atom shop and making grind fest after grind fest for the players to spend endless hours on.
---
Even without unyielding, you can get a higher carry weight than PA has. It’s honestly sad that power armor is so under*power*ed in this game
---
Forgot to mention that it’s only a 10% chance the wendigo colossus will spawn at sundrew grove, but there are places where you can get up to 20% chance, but its all irrelevant to me because if you nuke those specific areas and it doesn’t spawn then you kind of wasted a nuke. When you nuke the queen, you have a guaranteed boss fight and possibly a wendigo colossus fight.
---
You bet!
---
Don’t have any serum plans yet
---
Yeah I'll be honest and say I run every chamber for ore but I will 1 tap everything in my way with no regard. Sure I'll emote and wait for a legendary thats *really* easy for others to tag, but if I have to wait more than 8 seconds for that to happen its mine, I don't see anyone running ore anymore so it's fair game to me
---
Maybe you should take a break.
---
Agreed. I had to scrap Becket a number of times while I was trying to place and decorate his bar. there needs to be a better way.
---
People absolutely should keep reporting it
---
No you're talking about amnesia ray device... which does not exist. Never existed. Ever.
---
Amnesia gun is older tech. It is a revolver that uses hollow point bullets.
---
If you'll divulge further information on this fairy tale ,you will have to be reintroduced to the Flesh Interface program. Hey we're... I am just kidding (WE ARE WARNING YOU).
---
Idk if this was him, but one time there was a max level super mutant at a bot stop (it wasn’t graham) and every time I pressed the dialogue button he said “go away little bleeder” or something like that
---
True but my main is Melee/Shotgun, and well...  that's with Mutations.  That mutation is fantastic now, since it's finally fixed.
---
At 50 you choose to either move a SPECIAL from one stat to another *or* select a new perk card. 
---
Max for any stat is 15 base (can be increased from multiple effects like armor or chems or food, etc) and a total of 56 base SPECIAL points among all seven stats.
---
This is the way to go. Let people decorate however they want, items are static so no display bug nonsense, it's no different than other small items like lamps or alarm clocks. 
---
Only issue would maybe be small items like pens/pencils or silverware, but that could be fixed with slightly larger presets like a mug with pencils or the Bolton plate settings.
---
Time to retire
---
Hmm, I've never seen order number requirements to submit a ticket.
---
Anything instigating.  You'll do damage in the vicinity of bloodied for the first hit.  The majority of all enemies will be one tappers, anyway.  If you want to mix it up for SBQ and other tanks, maybe use Furious until she gets below 40% health, then switch to an executioner weapon.  Or use AA All the time.  All that said, Id go bloody or junkie :)
---
Lol bruh, since the game been out I've taken 8 months total break. In the last 2 weeks I've played maybe 5 hours.
---
Not at all. I can still get in an enemies face in CSA and they have no idea where I am.
---
Hmm, not a bad idea.  Might note some down.
---
I went to play somethin else 
---
But if you really want to play do a character run where you only use one type of weapon
---
Have IRL friends I can trust or alts who can mule for me Weapons and armor
---
Masturbation works
---
Yes the only thing I'm not sure about is armor penetration, I haven't seen much difference in the sense of using an aa or stabilized perk. It seems about as effective with or without, so I assume all it needs is to hit to affect. Someone with more experience on that part may be able to verify.
---
But you guys just keep supporting them sooooo.
---
Not sure why they'd monitor this when the launch codes were "00000000".
---
https://gizmodo.com/for-20-years-the-nuclear-launch-code-at-us-minuteman-si-1473483587
---
The real trick of course is getting into the fortified bunker and figuring out how to use the floppy disks.
---
Might be time to move on to another game then my dude. Sounds like you've pretty much beaten it.
---
I just worded it wrong, that's the point of this running so long, with 9 dailies now. I'll add the comma. Everyone can plainly see that the score levels continue to scale though, as a marketing perspective it's how game passes are. Make progress at the start really fast and fun for people to get them a little hooked, then release the level skips when people start to hit the grind. Like I personally have never made it past level 60 on a CoD battle pass, but I don't demand more xp opportunities because I can't make it to 100, I know I'm a casual to that game and I didn't put the time in to make it to the end of the pass rewards...
---
Finding locations that have structures already built can be helpful also.  I’ve had my camp in a couple really cool spots.  There are a lot of intact houses, businesses, and raider type locations littered all over. My current cam location is over looking crater, on the hill just to the NW. it has a small house with a second floor and some nice raider deco. It has a tinker bench a cooking pit and an outhouse. I’ve built around the hut, making a wrap around porch and some other things for the second floor. Making functional unique camps takes a lot of time and effort. You also have to do some thinking and pre planning.
---
I don’t. Do dailies and log off. NW could hold my attention with a fun crew and a rewarding leveling system but unfortunately that’s not the case. I talked to some guy who thinks level 90 is halfway to level 100 exp wise. He said he won 12 matches in a row with a stacked crew and the exp barely budged.
---
Yeah I've been doing that. But for some reason I constantly think about 76 an want to log back in the when I do I end up standing around my camp an logging out again.
---
Get both.  Leader can switch team type away any time while keeping bonds. As an event is about to end, switch to an Event team for 10 seconds and then back to a Building team.
---
Hmm, maybe Instigating sounds like a good idea after all.
---
Thank you so much man!
---
Excuse me what the fuck
---
Pretty much me
---
I was going to ask the RNG on this. 10% is not bad based on the rate of nukes I drop or see dropped. I think I'm going to make more of a point to staying in the area after. Is it immediate or can it spawn any time during or after a nuke?
---
I've definitely had those weeks. Since the updates I've clearly passed them on to you. Sorry lol
---
I kept reading it was network instability, I got a wifi booster and that seems to have stopped it but not sure if this is what did it or if it was just a coincidence.
---
Its pretty bad glitch in there system, I heard of some fixes that were to not play the game around 12pm EST because that's when the dailies reset and if you're online during that time the new dailies sometimes auto complete based on things you did during that session or something
---
well at least for me legendary run, scrip bullion farm, tune the build couse I did not copy paste bloodie builds. getting new gear to try and rise the Dr/damage plans to farm, secondary missions to finish. alot of things.
---
I get what you're saying lol. I wonder if there's any easy fix they can do to fix stuff like this though. I'm pretty sure my roof will have the brown pointy bits forever, or they will release a "roof" set for atoms 😂.
---
Step down to a 1-hitter
---
Gather and cook mothman eggs to sell. Build water purifiers for water to sell.
---
It helps me to frame it more like a virtual existence rather than just playing a game, especially in times like these.
---
Log in, do some challenges, help out a noob, do my dailies, cook some food, wander around, etc. The hours can just roll by, especially if you're killing time with other people.
---
I feel like heavy weapons are just better with power armor because of the perk that increases heavy gun armor penetration by up to 36% while wearing pa and also the perk that increases heavy guns chance to stagger enemies
---
I just got it last night. I feel we are behind but if they keep the extra dailies and have a double score weekend I’m sure catching up would be easy.
---
The NSA doesn't monitor people in the United states, but I know what you mean.
---
I have yet to complete it for max reward.  Would lobe the rad barrel plan.  Cant get other players to get ore.   Frustrating.
---
I’ve been hit three times now. I’m told they fixed the problem so we should see less instances of it. Yet I’m seeing more and more posts each day now. I’ve sent a ticket each time and they don’t respond. It’s not a good light for the first run of this event that is going to continue after this.
---
Go screw yourself. I know reddit is full of assholes like the two of you. That's what I'm responding to, trash that doesn't know how to speak to people.
---
Yea seriously i am finally getting up in the ranks and I just want time to read through all the terminals and listen to the tapes! I actually really like that lore is unlocked through progression but don’t have enough time to take it in
---
Just think it be easier to have them spawn out in build mode then back when your finished. 🤔
---
Also, go through your miscellaneous and ammo tabs regularly. Sort by weight and look for the greatest offenders. Things that take allot of weight that you may not realize: gun powder, ore, mine claim tokens (.10 per token!?!?!?), flux components i.e. hardened mass, glowing mass, etc. 
---
Always check your ammo. Quests love to sneak missiles and mini nukes in your inventory. 
---
Don’t get attached to outfits and Knick knacks. If it doesn’t help your immediate survival, leave it behind. 
---
Food/aid items weigh a ton. Either get traveling pharmacy/thru hiker and keep em on your person or drop them. Do you really need 150 stimpacks and radaway?
---
And finally, forget about trading. If you don’t have a FO1ST subscription you can forget about player trading. I’m sure someone can micromanage to make this work but I don’t think it’s worth your sanity. 
---
Hope that helps, see you in the wasteland brother!
---
"force people to buy levels?"
---
Is that part of that FOMO thing that people claim to have?
---
Like any game, it is all in what you are looking to get out of it. I am working up multiple characters. That means different builds, different gear needs, different camp ideas and more. 
---
I have tried different builds in NW (currently liking shotguns) and joined up with some newer players to help them where needed. 
---
If you are not enjoying the game there is nothing wrong with that. When I feel like I need a 76 break, I have been playing the Witcher III on the side. 
---
GL!
---
Run the three faction dailies (Crater/Foundation/Davenport) for 9 Treasury Notes. 
---
Run public events for the other 11 Treasury Notes, maybe stock up on some extras for days you can only log on for a few minutes. 
---
Turn in your 20 Treasury Notes. 
---
Buy the bullion plans you need/want. 
---
Turn in legendary junk to get your 150 daily scrip. 
---
Buy legendary modules from Mama Murmrgh. 
---
Sell stuff to vendors for your 1400 daily caps. 
---
Visit player camps to see the cool designs the community comes up with. 
---
Buy stuff from player vending machines if you’re above 20k caps. 
---
Put stuff in your own machines to sell. 
---
Compete the Daily Score challenges.
---
Advance a newer character up through the quests. 
---
That’s the basics of my daily gameplay. Add in that I might find cool people to adventure with and/or new players to assist, and I can easily have 3+ hours. 
---
But if none of that appeals to you, take a break.
---
You're so *cool*.
---
why you don't wanna use mutations?
---
try 15/3/10/4/5/13/6
---
Without PA: You’ll need a little more endurance to hold your ground, whilst being bloodied. 
---
You don’t really need One Gun Army for any damage output, I’d suggest moving those 3 points to Endurance &amp; adding either Adamantium Skeleton or some Iron Clad. 
---
Replace Bear Arms perk with Blocker so you don’t get staggered and dropped easily by melee hits.
---
If you have taken 8 months break then you haven't seen the wastelander quest line.. maybe do the reputation events or farm gold bullions and get the new end game armor/weapons/pa . You can prepare yourself for the new content that is coming. 
---
More content is coming soon.. legendary perks, daily ops, new boss, expenditions, new events, interior bases and new quest line.
---
The game is taking new direction now with the wastelanders update and i have positive vibes with this update.
---
You’re welcome!
---
I was thinking about this recently. Since Excavator doesn't have a jetpack option, it should get a backpack mod instead. 200 lbs at minimum. Due to some recent changes to my character's armor and backpack, I'm overweight a lot when I enter power armor, but still have 100 lbs outside PA. This doesn't make any sense.
---
Anti armor faster fire/faster swing and vampires faster fire/faster swing weapons. Vanguard armor I guess?
---
That exactly why I kill every one I see
---
It worked for me. Made a level 1 leather chest and gave it the cheapest mod for one completion. Set it to standard again for the second completion. Rinse/Repeat.
---
GL
---
And yet the irony of a post-apocalyptic game they built to be open world and for the players to make the stories isn't being a raider about exploiting weaknesses? Lol
---
That's how it works, you get near a power plant and it begins, except if it was already completed previously on the server. It's also not a public event, just a normal one.
---
Not a Bethesda hater. Just calling it as it is. 
---
It's a bit simple minded to think that you can't enjoy playing parts of the game &amp; be critical of the company that makes it at the same time.
---
oh I have a good sense of humor, I find it extremely amusing when I'm leveling someone's camp after killing them in PVP or when I'm throwing explosive bait to level their camp when they're not there. The humor is there just own up to your actions.
---

---
This I what I currently run. Adrenaline is broke. Blocker and serendipity will counter a lot of incoming damage. With the extra avoidance perk in agility it’s a big boost
---
Full Uny with this build and your invisible. No need for chameleon or HTD pieces. 5 HTD pieces and increase agility to 15 and you’ll be able to get rid of sneak perks. Full uny increases all your stats so more sneak. More carry weight.....with under armour and a high cap small backpack pack I have 400.....exp from more intelligence. Bolstering isn’t really a good idea at low health. U want to avoid damage as much as possible with the perks. Insta is the best first perk on a sniper rifle but remember if your a commando you’ll have to change the cards to rifleman to use the lever. But at low health and insta you’ll one shot pretty much everything except boss level mobs.
---
It worked for me. What paint did you use? I used the ghillie paint on a level 1 leather arm.

It's not stated but it's true. I don't expect you to believe unless you actually experiment yourself. If you have some way of boosting your intelligence a good bit try testing on a set creature and level spawn, then compare the xp gain. Like liberators right outside vault 76. Or simply building stuff at your camp.
---
Painfully.
---
Try out ESO if you like elder scrolls, they've really improved ESO in the recent years with these huge expansions that adds quite a bit of fun new content, my favorite feature in ESO nowadays is that enemies are always your level, except PvP of course, so you're never too weak to fight an enemy, tho of course there are boss like enemies and events where large groups of players join together to beat them, the community is very helpful in-game with the in-game chat feature you can almost always find people to help you do quests, dungeons or other fun activities
---
Ain't I though? Collest motherfucker in the wastelands.
---
Just something challenging.
---
I make my own fun
---
* come up with new and interesting camps, sometimes the theme is something that I want to go gather specific items for (for example, I now have a donut shop, so I go out and gather materials for making donuts and go searching for canned coffee)
---
* I try out new builds, preferably without having to change my SPECIAL, but that’s also why I have different characters.  Most changes to builds are trying out different legendary effects and seeing how they change a run
---
* I also like hunting down sets of gear that match.  For example I am trying to find a set of Legendary Heavy Combat Armor so I can walk around without an outfit over my armor so I don’t look like trash.  
---
* I enjoy photomode, and then download the pictures and put them into a little ”journal” of sorts. 
---
* There’s still a number of plans that I don’t own, so I’ll go out and see if I can find them, they aren’t important ones so I’d rather try to get them from searching a chest.  
---
* I just enjoy farting around.  Having friends in the game makes a huge difference.  Sometimes just sitting at the camp and just chatting while not doing anything of importance is nice. 
---
*
---
Wouldnt alts be faster by one letter?
---
Other than the Order of Mysteries already being gone since you left the Vault after their destruction, I would say I agree for the most part.
---
I like the idea of making it a questline, with each wild plant requiring a new plan to craft and it being an 'item' not necessarily a crop. Firecaps need a log, ash roses need asbestos and coal, Bloodleaf can only grow in a small pond, Silt Beans can grow in dirt but need extra-strength fertilizer. It'd be super easy to talk about how each plant requires different materials due to their environments differing in the Mire or Ash Heap, and then send us on quests to acquire what they need. Overseer could do "tests" and then give us the plans for what worked.
---
For balance purposes they should probably take up a good chunk of CAMP budget and physical space (maybe a full square meter each) to stop everyone from just make cranberry XP farms.
---
Edit: Also, regrowth times are a thing. All they have to do is make the regrowth timer on these crops much longer than the normal ones. There's always people who will game the system but most won't put in the effort.
---
Do the updates fix grass clipping through foundations since Wastelanders? - only asking as it seems tangentially related.
---
Hit me up some time. GT: jss125
---
I can help you with gear if you want. I'm usually in in the evening and on weekends
---
I'm really starting to hate this event, I never see anyone try and get the ore. I would like to get the various plans for this event.
---
I’ve never had anyone else but Euginie and Kieran. I’ve done it a lot and it’s always them. I wish it would change I can almost repeat their banter at this point.
---
I just want a button to instantly kill myself so i dont have to shut my game off so I can try again to finish my score challenge.
---
I dont want to waste any more time in that mode that I have to.
---
Thats pretty bitchin.
---
I'm not an idiot.
---
Many Non-Daily &amp; -Weekly challenges still award Atoms if not yet completed. 
---
What do you mean ‘increments of 20’?  You get 150 Atoms at 10, 20, 30, 40, 49, 51, 60, 70, 80 &amp; 90, and 500 at 100.
---
My only suggestion is to remove one gun army and the points from luck and put them in endurance. You’re operating on 20% of your health. 20% of 8 end is greater than 20% of 5. You’ll have more hp. 
---
Other than that looks good. Ver similar to what I run in pa.
---
What exactly did I not "own up to?" I simply stated what happened. I didn't condem the guy for cheating his way through, I didn't name names and I didn't claim some false sense of superiority. All I said was this is a thing that happened. You want to read more into it and start tossing out insults and assumptions that's on you.
---
Same here; I carry a 'tag the legendary' weapon to pull out specifically so my bloodied deathclaw gauntlet doesn't generate unhappy feelings during an event, especially Uranium Fever.
---
Selling .45 and 5.56 will get you there all day. as long as the price is right. (I sell at 1 c ea.) Watch your cap limit though. I have definitely donated a lot of caps to the aether by putting in too much and underestimating how fast it would sell.
---
It’s a glitch done intentionally to get the event over with quickly.
---
Have heard nothing back yet
---
youve been whining so much on this sub lately. i think you may be the one no one cares about.
---
exactly, if you don't put in the time you don't deserve to reap the benefits that someone who puts in far more time than you does. So yeah, when time and effort are devalued because other people are taking shortcuts I laugh when they get punished, trading is a huge aspect of this game and should not be soiled by fake goods, if you don't put in the time or have the lock then you shouldn't get the item, period. And before you go saying, "it doesn't affect your gameplay." it does. as much as people like to ignore it PVP and competitive elements exist in this game.
---
Enough noise has been made already. Bethesda issues a statement that they are currently investigating, specifically looking at logging events that could be causing this. 
---
A watched pot doesn’t boil any faster.
---
Good advice.
---
My problem is that they have these harvesting limits AND food decays. Make it one or the other if I can't grow the crops myself. Good With Salt helps but then I have to carry everything. 
---
Keep food decay, but let us plant stuff. Make them have long regrowth timers to balance out the accessibility.
---
Smiley has been broken for months. Challenges have been broken for months. Making tons of threads doesn’t work. If it did these things would have been fixed already.
---
if you have pacifist mode on, how does this affect  you? Are you getting stomped PVP and your legacy weapons can't do the job? You said you have TWENTY legacy weapons. There is no way of determining the weapons you traded/bought on ebay are not duped. you should probably be banned forever if one of those weapons turned out to be duped right?   
---
I would not be happy you are banned forever. I would not be happy you lose all your inventory and hard work. Say you are innocent, how do you prove the weapons you have are not duped/exploited?
---
20% is less than an extra 100%, even following all the steps to boost intelligence (which can still be done whilst in an events team), I run Bloodied and have a high intelligence boost but I can tell you now I get more from events than from a building team...
---
would be kinda nice to see the challenge in nw, or how far we got, but there is 0 info in that mode
---
&gt;ctrl-f "stairs"
---
&gt;0 results
---
Well let me add the quintessential ^(***LET US SNAP STAIRS TO HALF AND QUARTER FLOORS***) ^^*please*.
---
U could run a stealth vats build which does real good dmg but in my options is less fun... also the nighttime perk(can’t remember name) allows u to do more dmg during night time can make ur sneak atm do 3.75X the dmg which is huge with bloodied weapons
---
Do you know how this is supposed to work? Once I put power to it, it opens. How do I set this up with a keypad?
---
atoms, usually
---
I turned my mule into a badass Bloodied Stealth Commando level 125 lol and my main (LVL 405) is a Bloodied Heavy gunner out of PA most of the time. It's DBL XP time too!
---
Sometimes you get to a point in a game where you need to take a break. I find playing with other people helps extend play times if they are fun people.
---
Wonder if supermutants will climb my li'l abode to get to the generator on the roof.
---
I'm genuinely curious lol.
---
Tbh if it gets much worse it will be for me too
---
Press the map button then options button and you can view your challenges. 
---
Same as adventure mode
---
Congrats! And what's with Excavator PA talk? It's awesome with It's carry capacity and mine bonus! Be proud user of one!
---
it's all right, I'm not the one in denial about wrecking someone's camp and making condescending gestures and passing it off as a Good Samaritan act.
---
Push them. They're lying to you when they say they can't do anything. They're the devs of the game. They can of course restore your score you list due to their bug. They're just choosing not to because you're not worth the effort to.
---
Only way to get them to change their mind on that last one is to make it more of a problem for them NOT to restore those lost points than to ignore the problem. Worked for lost items. Worked for wiped characters. Both of which they still insist to this day that there is nothing that they can do and yet have demonstrated that they can.
---
This is no different. If you have a Fallout 1st account, might be worth suspending it &amp; suggesting others to do the same.
---
Yeah your being more than critical of parts that don’t work. Your basically attacking Bethesda. So maybe I’m just calling it what is your doing.
---
yes. that would be a good solution.
---
Yeah till the next dupe wave comes back and hits harder than before....
---
or make it user friendly lol, i will try that.
---
I wonder if perk packs are set when you get them or when you open them.
---
Do some events, go play with low levels, make people weapons and armor, give low levels stuff that blows their minds, make new friends, trade, I dont know about you but that keeps me entertained for a few hours every day
---
Furious Ripper or Handy Blade is what I would recommend.
---
During a SBQ fight yesterday, I managed to go up 3 levels. A bunch of people popped their lunchboxes. I was shooting all the adds that I could see. I hit 65 right as it started, then I hit 66 soon afterwards, and hit 67 right at the end. That repeatable kept popping up in the corner of my screen.
---
I currently run 3 builds off of one character.  Junkie commando, junkie archer, junkie shot gunner.  I am working on armor for all three builds still.  Currently playing the shot gunner and rolling for a good junkie Gauss shot gun.  I got the bow and cross bow for my archer but still need to decide a good back up for that .  I feel you there are days when I am bored and I do just log off and play guitar.  This legendary grind right now can be fun.  Sometimes I just go for  a walk and see what kind of trouble I can get myself into.  I usually do that when I am way over weight.
---
Nuclear winter isn’t dead.
---
Okay so you need direct power to run to the outer conduit, and you need to make a switch to toggle it open and closed for your interior, if you run power straight to the door it stays open, tun the power to the outer junction box, then make a switch to alternate power on and off from the inside to manipulate the door. If you are on xbox I can walk you through or show you in game.
---
Instigating for unarmed is really good since you'll one shot pretty much everything. I would also carry around an anti-armor or furious weapon for the tankier stuff since Instigating only works on the first hit and is useless against something like the queen. Without mutations or bloodied, you'll want to focus on every single STR bonus you can. So look for armor pieces and weapons with +1 STR and get to know your food and chems that have the right buffs. Also probably worth stocking up on STR bobbleheads. Also, it will be even more essential than usual to have a faster swing speed weapon.
---
One of the versions has a keypad built in - you’ll need to have a floor placed on the “outside” to get it to place the right way around
---
Apparently there is cheaters/hackers in Adventure mode too. Just saw on Guided Meditation how they instakilled all ghouls simulaneosly. Seems they would get nice double XP weekend.
---
How are you so Calm libby?
---
Another has joined the club!
---
No but people heee want it gone for some reason
---
An hour is often my sweet spot. Some days I just run an event or two for t notes, sell off excess junk and aid items, restock ammo supplies, and call it good. Other days I go where the wind takes me. Honestly, if not for the season pass and public teams mixing things up, I’d be on a long Netflix break until the new BoS story content drops. I’m not terribly enthused about the cosmetic rewards, but nice that dumb events like Tea Time has some added purpose now.
---
Dunno don’t care.  Im not banned.
---
Aries and Rudy are probably the rarest team that travels through that tunnel.
---
 I have probably done that event close to 50 times and had those 2 Maybe 4 times.
---
 The other 2 teams are super common.
---
Geez, way to warm after I'm pretty sure so many people have bought it, including myself.
---
😂
---
I made a few changes after seeing your suggestions, how's this looking?
---

---
It would also sure be nice to be able to snap some stairs to the front of the Red Rocket station when the floor sits 3 feet above the surrounding ground.
---
Some random challenges give 10 Atoms, but it's hard to know which one do.
---
Part it a few days ago, just got past the one and only pose in the battle pass.
---
If you have to ask people to find things to do, maybe you should stop playing the game &amp; find some other thing to do or game to play.
---
Why waste your time playing a game that's not fulfilling?
---
No they just want adventure pvp gone because the game is so fucking broken that pvp is a complete shit show.
---
I like them. You did a great job dude.
---
Save it, that's a god roll
---
Again with the assuming. I didn't try to pass anything off as a "good samaritan act." I said he did this, we did that, he did another thing and we did a different thing. It's just a story about a thing that happened, no more, no less. Whatever you're reading into it is just that; you reading into it.
---
yea same tbh but 90% of this games crowd is casual so I wouldn't expect anything actually tough being added
---
The overwhelming majority of players don’t PVP cause PVP in this game is garbage. 
---
It doesn’t matter what you think people “deserve” 
---
Real life isn’t like that either. A girl can go on only fans post some booty pics and make far more money then the average hard working woman or man working hours upon hours. 
---
Is it fair? No. Is it reality. Yes. 
---
No one cares what you deem “fair” no one cares how many hours you put in to get your “elusive weapons” 
---
Get your head out of your ass and accept reality.
---
I have around 3k atoms saved, however the challenges are never that hard to do so im probably going to just do them as the event runs it's course. Maybe I can beat all of it without spending them, if so, great. If not, at least I can buy the ranks on the last day.
---
Just what I was thinking, that would look really cool too
---
I really gotta go home &amp; video record it happening.  The in game bass.  It's literally a 2 second tune or so, wearily reminiscent of the amount of time needed on a bass to sink underground.  Valid point though that I shouldn't worry about reporting it.
---
Did beserker unarmed for a while.  Was more of a farm toon then anything but it was decent enough.
---
Lol,  don't say stuff like that or he might accidentally tweet them...
---
I'm on PC but I'll give it another go after work
---
Schrodinger’s cat...
---
Honestly duping isn’t a bad thing tho, and gm is mainly used for xp glitches, the real problem is hackers in nuclear winter those are the real problem... honetsly idc about dupes bc that just let’s other people get good weapons cheaper instead of grinding forever and still never getting the dream gun.
---
And if pvp is a concern go play rust or cod or nuclear winter. this games pvp was a joke to begin with so i don’t understand all the butt hurt people complaining about the pvp... there was no balance to begin with.  Also all the complaining about a lvl 400 taking over ur workshop yeah it exists it’s called being a dick and griefing every game has people who do it so stop ur whining and grow a pair
---
with those points is almost what I run, you will need at luck shielded junk and evasive those 2 will help you a fuckin ton, and since you won't have the demon use the marathon on agility to be able to run from less AP usage. and iron clad/adamantine skeleton/ immune to narcos will be a good to have too as you sayed be a little more tanky, 2 pices vanguard 1 autostinpack(chest usually) and the one that make you run faster on both legs with +1 str on all, for weapon a 2 handed super sledgehammer ss with 20% Less damage output for 3 sec. i run that for almost 40 levels, now I'm changing to mutation to squish a little more damage there. use glow meat that gives 10% more melee damage.
---
Definitely. But if you're worried about that, don't ever play GTA unless you're willing to type things like "profit selling cocaine"
---
So legion and talon is what? A fb page for duper’s and people that buy duped? So that’s like supposed to be official numbers I’m to accept?
---
That would be great
---
Not if you’re not running events constantly
---
Given the number of idiots anything is possible.
---
Ignore my last comment. I just tried it too and it's doing the same. I would just put all Zeroes to submit it
---
Ok thank you!
---
It takes five minutes per Industrial Purifier to fill up. I run 10 and stop by my camp once an hour to collect 50. That’s 250 caps per hour.
---
Yes and no. After some events like Uranium Fever or One Violent Night, it's too short already. I've barely started looting the bodies before the next public event starts. I need more time. After other events that don't involve lots of looting, I'm ready for another public event right away.
---
Impressive.  My screensavers are all meme shit like funny stuff written at camps.
---
Lmaoo we talking bout pa, the broadsider and the Fatman are the real guns that need some love. Broadsider hitbox/dmg don’t work and the Fatman does ridiculously low dmg for what it is... like for feck sake it shoots a mini nuclear bomb it should do insane dmg
---
Reddit award for duping? 😑
---
For anyone thinking of buying ranks, wait until the very last moment. You're wasting money buying at lower ranks because the Atom cost is the same regardless of rank but later ranks cost a lot more score to level up.
---
This.  AI pathing has been a problem in this engine since forever.  You should have seen how bad it was in Dark Age of Camelot.  Pull a mob and watch it run the totally opposite direction from your group, make several random turns, a quick stop at taco bell and only then, finally, make a direct beeline for your group, clipping through any walls or objects along the way.
---
wait, VATS is supposed to work in PVP?
---
Pretty simple if you are in pa or in stealth armor which is a ton of people do a lap. I farm ghouls but I also heal the NPCs on main. My alt in stealth armor I am a runner
---
No they where pvpers mostly and some farming groups but a lot have given up since latch 20 since they can't even fight on private severs anymore. Also no i dont expect you to just accept them but you can check there Facebook groups for there member numbers
---
I really want that radiation barrel for my camp and if I show up I am almost always the sole ore carrier.  Frustration!
---
And there should be an option to go straight into another game
---
Generally, if I am working in building mode I pick up and store their furniture first and then move everything else so it despawns them and prevents them from getting in the way. Now pets like a deathclaw doing that I can't.
---
PM me if you need help. I might be able to explain it better after I've had caffeine
---
I started playing the game on Steam during free weekend. Then I bought Game Pass Ultimate and I play with the same character. All versions require you to login to Bethesda account. I think you are good to go.
---
That’s awesome! Where’d you place the tent??
---
Didnt read the op?
---
No, then there would be less events going on over the course of an hour due to the fact public events pop off once every 30 minutes.
---
One of the worst things they've ever done was making Project Paradise a public event instead of a trigger able event.
---
That suck cause atleast there where challenges from previous tutles
---
It dont matter if it was 1 bobblehead or a hundred fixers. 
---
You cheated.   End of story. 
---
Far as I am concerned they should be IP banning you and bricking your console if on xbox or ps4 its a violation of THEIR terms as well.
---
I've seen a Nuka Girl Grape cosplay and it was super cool, but the red turned into purple.
---
I wouldn't even mind just recolors. Red and off-white for Cherry, black and white for Dark, Wild is brown and orange, Quantum neon blue and purple.
---
Imagine if one of the games nuke codes where irl
---
I'm way past that
---
I got it today.
---
No no no no no what the fuck did I read
---
I don’t even play this game but I’m proud of that low level dude
---
Well, unfortunately not everyone can plainly see the scaling, as there were people on week two saying that the season will be a breeze if they were already level 20. That's why I said there will be people next week once again acting like 45 is ahead of the game when in reality it's just about par. It leads people to disregard the true pacing of the pass, even when people are crunching the numbers and realizing just how tight it is.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but CoD passes have a much larger margin for error when it comes to missing a week or so of progression, don't they? One of the reasons people complain about 76's system is that it's comparatively tight in terms of dedication. You miss a week of progress in 76, you have an absolutely massive amount of work ahead of you to catch up. Just for a single week.
---
Use a cryolator when it decides to hover over the group.
---
Plus, we will be given more opportunities for bonus SCORE.
---
No I you can search I just this week alone there are more than 3 dozen posts on here for wanting nw removed
---
Lmao i feel your pain man its it's possible they just dont get how ot goes at that point when that happends to me i take a breath and remember walking out of thos vault doors not knowing if i should go left or right what a random crate could hold of what Chinese propaganda bot might take me out
---
Elaborate. What mini are you talking about?
---
Also, probably completely different departments, and the Nuka-Girl isn’t just in Fallout 76.
---
Who the fuck are you? Lol
---
People can post whatever they want.
---
I just finished an abortion of a Scorch Earth event.  We were in the nuke zone.  She still wouldn't land for more than 15 seconds.   Some guys were perched on the building by Glassed Caverns.   I used up all my 2 mm prime ammo for a gauss minigun; had to switch to prime .50 and vampire plasma.   Other players were in the 100's.  That might be the last time I try that....   no one else over 200 and in the nuke zone.  True, I got a lot of xp from alot of enemies, but the event itself failed.   Just not getting alot of pleasure of fighting a Queen who never lands for more than a handful of seconds.
---
I know it isn't where it originated, but I have called them such since DAoC.
---
Probably because your typing in “nuke launch codes nw” and not Nuke launch codes fallout 76. No fucking cia agent of FBI agent is going to know what the fuck nw is
---
I would just keep checking the sub. There will be a ton of posts about it once it happens. 
---
(This also is true for literally anything that happens in the game)
---
Because people will buy it. Its a company trying to make money, duh.
---
Before fallout 1st I would loot literally everything, scrap it down to base parts, and carry it all on me with the pack rat perk. 
---
Now I loot literally everything, scrap it down to base parts, and store it away in my scrap box!
---
I must have missed that. But that’s easily explained, since the non-Daily &amp; Weekly Challenges still give out Atoms, many in increments of 20.
---
“Do as I say, not as I do”...Bethesda
---
It’s broken for me as well, but not at that point. Finished the second fetch of the quest and have to go back and talk to her but all she talks about is how her back hurts or something. Won’t bring up dialogue options.
---
I am always caught between wanting to help, but not wanting to keep them from gaining exp.
---
Before 1st the issue was people standing on the fence. Tents are just easier to stand on nowadays.
---
 Not really. Just look at the challenges list and they will tell you how many Atoms they award. There are two on my list that actually have blanks, but most tell you the exact amount you’ll get.
---
I just ran in to it and uh it followed me for a bit then it turned into an enemy I didn’t hit or shot it I had to destroy it unfortunately
---
Yea if my kids come to me like an adult I will always hear them out.
---
Now depending on what they did decides their fate tho.
---
Gosh I hope you never do anything wrong.
---
And IF you go with any mutations, get Carnivore and cook the meat that gives strength bonus. You get +6 I think, now, which is huge.
---
Who do you think watched them?
---
lmao watch you get hit with a false positive in the next wave. such is the price of circlejerk milk drinker.
---
That’s very close to my no PA heavy bloodied build. The only real differences are quality of life stuff and concessions to playstyle. 
---
I run all 3 rifleman perks at a single point because I run a bloodied lever action for smaller/everyday use, I swapped lone wanderer our for strange in numbers and 3 point  in Inspirational as I’m always in a team now and want more bonuses for farm. 
---
Int I run nerd rage, power user and batteries included so I can hold like 40k Bloodied ultracite Gatling laser ammo at most times and not messing up my carry weight, whilst getting the full 999 from each core. 
---
Adrenaline literally is pointless right now so you may as well swap it out for something else short term until it’s fixed otherwise you’re wasting 5 points. I swapped it for a combo of action boy, marathoner and dodgy depending what I’m planning on doing, mostly because I got the SS jetpack so I wanted more AP for that now (I was full heavy but now slightly hybrid). 
---
I also have one in good with salt in luck on top of what you have,  for all the scorchbeast meat and int boosting brains I carry now 😁
---
Same here. It here was a post a few days ago from someone who hadn’t been affected by it. Maybe if the community stands together we can get progress. I just don’t get, I don’t attack the people who ask if adrenaline or gunsmith is broken still.
---
No, there irl.
---
why don’t try to use both your brain cells when you post then you wouldn’t hurt my eyes
---
Pro-tip:  I got rid of my turrets a year and a 1/2 ago. The enemies seem to spawn far less now. 
---
 Not to mention the amount of space you save with your camp budget.
---
I got the wrath of god Howard so I wouldn’t know.
---
where can i get the US dollar easy?
---
DISCLAIMER: CAPITALIZATION IS FOR EMPHASIS ONLY
---
Ok, so here's how the building team works. All it does is give +4 Int. That is it. There's no secret little hidden XP boost that's added.
---
Now; the way Intelligence gives more XP is ROUGHLY a 2.8%exp bonus, per Intelligence point, added to the BASE XP that anything will give.
---
EXPLANATION:
---
Everything in the game has a BASE SET XP VALUE they will give you. An easy way to test/get the base XP value of anything is to create a new character (having 0 Int.) and killing a creature.
---
Killing said creature, with 0 Intelligence, gives you the BASE XP VALUE that creature at that lvl will provide. Then add Int. and kill the same creature, at the same lvl.
---
Take the difference in XP values from both kills and divide it by the original value. Then divide that by how many Intelligence points you have and you get the XP boost % for a single point of Int... which has been done and roughly works out to an average of around 2.8% MORE XP FOR EACH SINGLE POINT OF INTELLIGENCE.
---
If for some reason, you don't believe me? (Look it up to find it, or do the math yourself; as I've described exactly how to figure it out. Step by step...)
---
CONCLUSION:
---
So the XP bonus from a fully bonded building team is ROUGHLY going to be 11.2% ON THE BASE XP VALUE of anything and ONLY to that BASE XP.
---
That, as opposed to the 100% XP boost on ALL ENDING EVENT XP or even legendary kills if you're farming legendaries? Those XP boosts are added on after Intelligence, giving you just straight up double XP for them. I'll personally take a 2X MULTIPLIER to event XP than a small boost to BASE XP any day.
---
The weeklies.
---
Is that for definite or are we just wishful thinking? Because I know for a fact at the rate ive been going theres no way I'm going to finish it in time.
---
I recommend trading out rad resistant with the luck 1 perk pharma farma, which allows you to find aid items in crates, including ones already looted, namely rad away, rad-x, med-x, and stimpacks, which will help you far more than negligible rad resistance buff.
---
I also would replace the dr while sprinting with move speed when holding a pistol/shotgun or melee, as having permanent speed demon is super good for escaping, avoiding, and if you feel daring, hunting.
---
I run a melee build personally, which is very good on both defense (speed, stealth, tanking, healing), and devastating for assassinating people. And has the benefit of being very consistent.
---
Nice. I need to find an hour or two of uninterrupted time where I can grind xp
---
Go into the atomic shop and on items u can select as NW default to wear. The bottom of the screen will say which button to press to select
---
OMG this.  I spent like 40 min trying to get my Seedy Shack lined up with my foundations.
---
I wish I could just scrap all my legendaries. I am still working on reducing the number of legendary items I have. I earned so many during Fasnacht. I am down to only 112 legendary items 110 of which are 3 stars. Even if they raised the cap to 500 it would still take a while to get rid of them all I have 3362 scrap worth of items, not including the number of new items I get each day. I have started logging in scrapping all my items getting my gold bullion and then swapping to an alt so I don't get any more Legendaries.
---
I've always stuck to char. Nobody ever has an issue understanding when you say something about your char, or your alt/main. I remember toon being around even in the early ~2009 days, I knew some people played a game called toontown and I kind of always assumed it came from there
---
Thats cause youre a dick too. 
---
Thats ok karmas a bitch.
---
Under Social, go to Team, select your name, then choose the option to leave the team.
---
I just wish we could get Libby and Eugenie to pair up. Keiran is such a curmudgeon and it gets tiring listening to Carver hit on Libby all the time when she's clearly way out of his league.
---
Go to social, click the team, click yourself, leave party.
---
Who ever she is targeting while in the sky with her blasts, they should try running directly underneath her while not being in stealth to see what happens after a short bit 👍
---
Thanks. Now I'M paranoid.
---
Food decays way too fast imo
---
Lol these posts always get a bethesda response so quickly.
---
* Do not buy the screaming eagle skin - it has a fuck ton of issues
---
* Do not buy the backwoods bungalow - it has a fuck ton of issues
---
"Thanks for the reports, we'll fix these next patch. Buy them now" - And they never get fixed.
---
If you still want to know, im 80% sure they spawn whenever anyone mines out any ore in that pit, more people + more scorched
---
You can have both. A low level dark souls 2 character with a full moonlight butterfly dress and DLC weapons
---
Work your way to the ghillie suit and become one with the bush. People will hate it but i'm not trying to sit through loading screens for only 100 exp.
---
no stop saying shit like that. it should be free, it a fucking gameplay feature.
---
Yeah that should make you hold up a little bit better. 
---
If you are making this build to make Queen Runs, then do this: *Take the 2 points from STR and put them in END &amp; Add Life Giver Perk Card Maxed. Fireproof Maxed Out, Adamantium Skeleton Maxed Out.* I personally just don’t like weight reduction perks, because u can always supplement weight with backpacks when u aren’t in PA. 
---
Then, Because you won’t need Gun Smith &amp; you’ll have tons of repair kits. Move some INT points to areas you think you are lacking. 
---
If this is a build for everyday mobs, then you are probably tough enough to handle any regular enemy with that build, whilst putting decent damage.
---
Bethesda invited all the select youubers and gaming site to play the pre beta in the bunker before the game came out.
---
So this guy named Edward Snowden wrote a book on this.  I definitely recommend reading it.
---
It does work. Even on weapon mod challenges for atoms.
---
Sell broken items, it’s what they do since launch with no regard for their community...they just want that cash money
---
I like you say fix this and every thing else lamo
---
Nice  i had no idea
---
i also heared some people getting banned for doing dailys and such like normal is this true?
---
Yea. Pretty much every location in this game is a real place. There is a guy who did a tour and took photos of a lot of in game places IRL (mothman statue, pumpkin house, various buildings in Helvetia)
---
Pre fo1st it was keep 100-200 of each scrap item.   More of the items that was more valuable.  
---
Pretty much got tired of micro managing this shit and gave up on the game for a bit.  
---
Came back after fo1st came around.   
---
I would not be playing this game anymore  without that scrap box.   
---
I feel bad for non fo1st player.  They really need to make the scrap box a default game feature for everyone.
---
While I don't have it yet, it is a PA item, so you should craft (or maybe skin an existing) PA helmet.
---
Same I forgot how slow everything is at first
---
I got it yesterday and I love it I honestly made my xbox GTP it
---
[Here](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=fc46595&amp;d=l71lt2sf2sq2s32sx2sr2pg2po2ph2pi2eu0ek1eh0c72ck0ir2ik0ii0a04am2a80) is my bloodied build.  With the SPECIAL points allocated this way I can max almost all of the damage perks for weapon classes, other than pistols.  Also, when I want to play stealth I can swap Adrenaline and Evasive for Covert Operative, Sneak x3 and Mister Sandman.
---
I dunno, 45% chance to take no damage while not in PA
---
Always use incognito, and nukacrypt
---
Have you talked to euginie? She says her favourite guard is libby. It would be better if it wouldn’t be the same pair all the time. It should be random like aries and carver, or libby and euginie
---
The guy who did that is the same guy who will be rage posting here if they ever nerf the weapon he used to one shot the sheepsquatch.
---
I don't think it's possible here. Everything that changes in any way is an indoor location because they can't really do it on the exterior. They can have maybe a new underground bunker or something added to places we already have, but they can't have an exterior that changes based on your quest progress
---
Definite
---
There were some posts last week about this.  You place the tent outside the courtyard with the stairs just about touching where the stone wall/iron fence would be in the middle break.  Basically straight out from you if you had your back to the sonic generator.
---
Give him the death penalty too while you’re at it geez😂
---
How exciting! I can’t wait to see what financial surprises Bethesda has in store for season 2 with all the unbridled enthusiasm to throw money at ranking up a remarkably achievable Season 1. This game went from buy it once and only purchase optional cosmetics if you want, to getting cosmetics with in game advantages (collection, scrap kits, repair kits), to a premiere subscription, and now pay to win the season pass. The market has spoken, clearly.
---
I believe you. It makes sense for the to follow the same pattern as they did in past games regarding intelligence and what it does. It is good to have someone who has been playing longer than I to share their experience with it. I will keep an eye on the xp gains for the next few levels most likely if only just to see approxinately how big or small of an xp boost it gives though. Curious about that now for sure. I just remember in 3 and 4 and NV that i was able to figure out what kind of xp buff I was getting the more intelligence I had so in 76 i had expected to see it outlined on the SPECIAL screen or somewhere is all. Like in the description of each stat, ya know? In any case I'll continue boosting Intelligence however I can. At least for awhile. I'm at level 15 or so so far and have Strength and Charisma and Intelligence at 4 each with one point in a couple others. Luck and Endurance i believe. Still figuring things out and how stats have evolved since Fallout 4. May have to do some research online though as i haven't seen a way to respec in-game yet and if my choices regarding stats while leveling up are permanent I don't want to screw up too bad. Can't imagine playing more than one character in this game yet but again I'm only about 10 or 12 hours into my first overall lol.
---
The stalkers, 11 times out of 10.
---
this post is pretty dumb tbh.
---
I love the fact that I can say I'm stronger then powerarmor
---
Easily.
---
Yea it does suck. Let's hope the new quest lines and stuff they add make up for that though
---
Yeah i have to be quick on picking up the furniture or else they use it and im like -.- haha it is abit of an oversight from Bethesda if im honest
---
No problem if ya get bored watch some of the comparison videos.
---
not exactly controversial dude, there are major bugs and unfixes in every patch. you can pretend that this game doesnt have massive issues with it, but that doesnt make it true.
---
Make an alt, and get a friend to help you transfer excess items. there are ways to do it solo as well. You should search it here, or google. I am sure someone else has explained it better and clearer than I can.
---
The only good supermutant is a dead supermutant! You just know if you were limping along the road hurt and defenceless he would stomp on your puny little human head just for funsies
---
You may have chosen a different special point and then chose a luck perk card.
---
From my point of view it looks like karma is working on you
---
I was on the last 30 spaces on the board and had the atoms so I ranked up to the captain cosmos costume (not PA) and it shows the dome, fish bowl headwear but it isn’t anywhere to be found :(
---
That would have been great for us, but would have required a whole bunch more dialog to be written and recorded, so that's probably why we're limited to the three pairs. At least it's not just set of dialog, like most of the other stuff in the game.
---
I was not aware this existed.
---
Now thats a meme i havent seen since 2012. I see you old timer.
---
Personally I'm running heavy gunner build in PA and I hate regular minigun - too much waste of ammos (comparing to other heavy guns) and less dps (IMHO).
---
33 vats chance - IMHO is useless, you won't be using vats for this gun+50 DR / double shot - good enough
---
~~stalker perk is useless until you do PvP~~  sorry, messed up with a different legendary effect, anyway it doesn't change anything
---
explosive/15 reload- ones of  top perks
---
If you're running in PA or have enough def - I'd choose stalkers, again - IMHO
---
Tbh, it works better plus the ads around don't do much damage providing theres no Mirelurk cun- I mean Kings
---
I'd like to pass a motion that we change the term to "Potato"
---
Itf it's not a good legendary or worth caps scrap it. I drop more garbage legendary than I have the ability turn in for scrip. Just drop  all that nocturnal and mutants stuff at the train stations
---
I think there were a bunch of magnets in FO4 but this is the only one that made it into 76.
---
So good!
---
Nope.
---
I got everything I wanted from the settler vendor then went on to the raider vendor. Next week I will be visiting V79 to see if there is anything I want from there.
---
I WILL find a use for the 50 or so legendary modules I have stockpiled
---
Dont fix armor until youre over level 50 just keep swapping better/higher level peices that you pick up until then
---
I've found there's two types of NW players - Hunters and Hiders. If you actively hunt other players (which is the point of the game), there is a chance you will die, but can (slowly) rack up XP from kills. If you hide, it will be super boring, but you will get more XP because you survived longer. 
---
Also if you don't like the VT suit, you can always go naked. A lot of players do.
---
Your don't have to take all 5 ranks. Even just 1 or 2 will bump the damage as the 1st rank is the biggest damage increase
---
No I was just baked while making it, I'll edit.
---
The buff isn’t for kills in an event, it’s just for completing the event...
---
Nah Ill keep playing the way I play.
---
PvP was dead the moment legendaries were involved.
---
I knew about Mothman, Helveria etc but I did not know there was a real bunker hiding under a golf course.
---
Just perfect. Bethesda doesn't always do a good job with the roll out of new games but the stories are great and really well researched.
---
Put the fast barrel on the stalkers to turn it into a magic minigun
---
... less ammo consumed ... more time playing ...
---
The Stalkers, but not because of the primary effect. Faster reload and explosive make this a much better weapon. Just don't bother using it on the queen since explosive damage is useless. In general though I'd choose Two Shot over stalkers for heavy weapons, but Vats hit is useless for a minigun and damage resist is meh, since you're likely in power armor anyway and don't need that extra defense.
---
Someone is emotional! You ok there? I know it's hard after being forced too leave 4chan.
---
Pretty sure they wanted the challenges removed from NW not the actual mode itself removed
---
No tour just repeating the same rhetoric that people who have never fought for anything says
---
The Palace Of the Winding Path is based on the Hare Krishna Palace of Gold, too. There is a lot of real stuff represented in the game.
---
yes. noone cares about the 14 people steathboy tesla cola spammers that farm unsuspecting workshop noobs.
---
go play NW, and if you cant do that, go play a game with actual PvP, this games is dogshit and should have had a mercy killing 12 patches ago.
---
Some where yeah but the majority want it gone just cause
---
If you want to level faster you should check out your perks while queuing. I hardly ever played NW before the season pass and both of my characters had over a hundred perk packs which took me up quite a few levels (you get XP for duplicate cards) and unlocked a ton of rewards.
---
What was your original location?  At times camps can “ghost” an area and prevent rebuilding or placing.  Have you hopped to a new server to try?
---
Aww you cant use the gear you bought on ebay? Lol
---
Pvp is junk when legendaries are involved.  I have said that since survival launched.
---
ty everyone for the recs! much appreciated
---
Nmd ny dyggdxgnwmu, noklickmonk on$'d0

Spam equip-unequip a pocketed armor piece to get infinite carry weight
---
Wow. There is a non-PA Captain Cosmos variant? In this case, no idea :( Sorry!
---
Like that one motherfucker who cleared out my Pristine NukaCola Machine yesterday. Level 100+, I literally hear him taking everything out, then quickly teleported away. The lack of shame.
---
Straight ahead of the sonic generator towards the walls and gates at the front you should see two exits, on the right one theres usually a green corpse on the one you want you want to place it as close as you can behind the pillar on the right as you look at it from the building, place it when the event has began when it says getting ready for scorchbeast attack and then stand behind the fence next to generator to start it, you can move around after the first time it happens
---
Tse wasnt nerfed out, just nerfed so its not as powerful as it used to be. Any explosive effect on laser or plasma weapons was taken out of the drop pool though.
---
thanks, keep us in touch

Uhh
---
U can look up maps of all deposits. Then travel to each one and check yourself
---
Food to know you dont know what your saying. You are just copying what everyone says. I already do play nw . but id like to get to utilize my full perk deck intsead of just seven cards not everyone enjoys staring at the ground and holding the driver stop being a idiot and assuming we are all the same
---
That was really well done! Great job and thanks for sharing!
---
It's in the defences tab on the build menu
---
I always do one run to get at least level1.
---
That's sad. Best event to get hella xp and you got 0 :(
---
The Atomic Shop runs on FOMO. I would suggest visit as many CAMPS as possible, decide what you like, and make a mental note for when it appears in 2-6 months from now. When they bring back items, it's also only like a week or maybe two at a time.
---
Well play it as soon as you can. It’s one of the best games I’ve ever played
---
You can use the wooden one you find on defences.
---
Defenses tab and only works on the porch as far as I can tell
---
I got auto completed challenges today and a few days ago :(
---
I didn't log in today until 3 hours after reset and all but one of my daily challenges was completed without any SCORE
---
That’s awesome, thanks for the detailed explanation!
---
does that quest give you settlers reputation?
---
What happens in a private server stays in a private server😂😂
---
Maybe spend less time jumping in front of their billets and emoting thumbs down and more time trying to get some shots on the legendaries  yourself?
---
Sounds more like you were trying to get some PvP started to ‘get revenge’ on a new, low level player. 
---
And the horde boss doesn’t automatically have a legendary, just because it has a crown symbol.
---
Np bud thanks for answering anyway. Could have just downvoted and not said anything like some people lol
---
I got it yesterday aswell
---
You obviously aren't good at math. ^^^/s
---
 (yes that's the new excuse for this bug, that we're bad at math and can't tell that we did receive our score)
---
Many are definitely inspired by real locations and many of the stories on real folk lore and history. A coworker of mine is in his 50s and used to live in WV. His family still does. I heard many of the stories prior to the game coming out. It's funny now listening to him talk about driving through areas like Morgantown. Immediately I start complaining about the scorched.
---
How does alt have negative connotations? It just means not your main.
---
They may have fucked some lifetime challenges, then, cuz I haven't completed any yet have extra Atom. Given the SCORE challenges are bugged, I suppose it's not a stretch
---
I’m new to this too and it seems like I can empty a gauss into someone and I still get killed
---
Drop sugar bombs and cherry cola at your camp, of course. I've found being friendly to people makes them nervous and they leave quite quickly :(
---
One more who doesn't know how IP banning works.  
---
If they implement this there is a really high chance that you also will be banned.
---
Nice 😂
---
I find humor in this story good job guy
---
I don't think so. At least I never noticed the rep progress bar popping up.
---
The title literally says "nuke codes fo76" I mean learn to read man
---
I just want a new staircase that looks like something you would have in a house. I was half way through planning a mansion when I saw that we only have the metal industrial-style staircase and the nuka staircase if you bought it. I can't even imagine how to possibly make the former look 'good' in a house.
---
That's entirely subjective. Personally I find it fun to be a bush wookie. It's like playing a Metal Gear game against real people. When you're all alone with nothing to protect you but a ghillie suit and you manage to sneak past a team of four (that have no business in a full teams off match in the first place) it's a hell of a rush. 
---
Can't beat the feeling when you get down to the last 5 alive and you realize it's just you and that bitch ass 4 man team yet your hiding spot is so good they just run around randomly blowing up bushes with no clue where you are. 
---
Bush wookie wins are awesome! 50 people go in and you are the last alive without ever even picking up a gun. It is far from boring.
---
Also it can only be used on the contemporary front porch, I have a back porch that goes over a cliff and it wouldn’t let me use those for the railing unfortunately
---
Np :) I tried explaining it as best as I could, I've tried it  with my tent before starting the event but doesnt do it but always works if its done when I mentioned and if you stand there, just watch out you are in sneak they go ham on you
---
You really think a cia or FBI agent gonna know what fo76 means
---
OH OH RAMMADEUS!
---
I can craft it in adventure mode. Do I have to be a certain overseer level to wear it?
---
i'm having same issue! rose just says "I say you taking a detour to see your overseer" and no dialog starts!
---
Yes... me too. So frustrating!
---
I wish.  
---
They same can be applied for notes and folders(that are junk atm).
---
Ah ok, thanks guys.  Will keep an eye out.
---
That'd be cruel :(
---
You sure?  Some of them are super easy to complete. Like, join a group. Cook some food. Scrap a weapon. And so on. 
---
Look for the greyed-out challenges in each of the sub-menus under Challenges. See if there are any that awarded Atoms. 
---
Otherwise, you just got some ‘magical free Atoms’, which most of us would be happy to receive.
---
No, just go into the atom shop and NW favorite it, you will always wear it when you spawn in.
---
I had dreams once, long ago, before the depression struck. Now I just have bills and an addiction to a predatory, barely-finished game.
---
Maybe lmao gonna have a whole secret service team just raid us while we're sleeping for looking up launch codes for fallout
---
No I'm more interested in utilizing my full perk deck and since you clearly are new here I before patch 20 I regularly hosted 3 v3 PvP in private severs without legendaries . ive had my same gear load out since January of 2019 and at the time just like every other person at the same time eagerly awaited survival for some clean and fair PvP . I am guilty of useing sentinal assasin gear at the time but it was easy to kill if you had grenades or shot their feet I never saw the issue people claimed existed unless you are talikng about the people who willingly went into fights wearing excavator armor cause a bunch of you tubers at the time where saying it was s tier in pvp
---
Ive played since day one and have yet to launch a nuke.
---
noone cares, and your rambling is nonsense, learn to English.
---
Oh! Okay, thank you so much.
---
Very good info! Ive been wanting to play with my Instigating Gauss Pistol. Missed almost every time with vats.
---
Now i shall give it a go!
---
Nah I don't agree, then people will just leech off events even more than they do. Leaving the hard work for players wanting to cooperatively do an event. Not all servers have crazy op builds.
---
Nuke codes are real, it's always split up in two between two people very far away from each other to minimize risk, don't ask me how I know 🙄
---
Thank you so much!
---
Ya it’s under junk in the pip boy so I would assume it would be the same at player vendors, I never see it at though
---
Mine snapped just fine to a brick wall, the floor is one of those dark wooden ones.
---
Or just click on your settlers/raiders rep and click leave the team (but you may missclick and leave the world)
---
But you do need more perk cards.   You'll be able to trash one for a legendary coin so that you can evolve your Legendary Perk cards.   Just don't open the pack yet if you don't need the cards now.   Saw a rumor that we wouldn't get credit for dupe cards.   So you'd want to scrap excess cards, open a pack, scrap cards, etc.  
---
The What Rads legendary perk will be worth developing.
---
So did a different challenge after this and had the same problem, it appears to be constant for me rather than random
---
Or everytime you search up “ Secret Service Plane “
---
Can one skip the level up menu if they want to rearrange their perk cards?
---
My portfolio has been deleted twice on fo76 xbox. Im sad to this day about it
---
The fact you didnt try to understand it means you never cared to have a conversation. how about going some where that your edginess is accepted
---
Good idea. Naked has to be more camouflaged than neon blue. Lol
---
No problem!
---
Alright, but it's not like the people who have them pose with them and a frappe from Starbucks on Instagram lol
---
I had a totally opposite experience today. It was a round of Uranium Fever, must have been at least 8 players. No one was one-shotting, it was all tag and go. It was great watching everyone stand around the legendary and do nothing after they tagged it. And I'm pretty sure most if not all players were lvl 100+.
---
(Join event fast travel)
---
(Hidden crouch)...
---
(afk for 7 minutes)
---
Where can I find the skeleton holding nuka cola?
---
Somebody pulled me up on this in real life a few days ago. I couldn't give a reason. Just cause. Must be from my WoW days
---
Hmmm. I was trying to install it over the new floor....does it have to be a wood floor? I'm using concrete
---
And you’ve literally just done a long winded way of saying what I’ve said all along... you only get the buff at the end of the event, I’d take an extra 10% on every single kill while I’m playing
---
But as I said in comments from similar people if you actually bothered to read before commenting saying the same thing basically, I don’t care how you want to play, it was information for people who did not know the buff it gives or for new players and for people that don’t want to run events constantly
---
I had two friends banned from the dupe glitch early 2019
---
Friend 1: was banned for 3 months, was unbanned but had everything wiped
---
Friend 2: was permanently banned, and they told him he was never coming back
---
Friend 1 duped moderately, friend 2 went overboard into the hundreds.
---
Yes. When you get to the screen to pick a card or move a perk point just press tab and it’ll let you into the perk card screen. 
---
Unfortunately when you add in the warning to open new packs every time you go to perks cards, it becomes very tiresome and needs changing, but still.
---
I just wish there was a separate, active sub for nothing but 76 screenshots. There's only one I've found but it's basically dead.
---
🎶FRIENDS! How many of us have them?🎶
---
like One item. that includes all the keys?!?...
---
that would be convenient, and mentally stabilizing...
---
... so no
---
You and I are certainly in the minority. I thought it was funny. Wasn't like we hated the guy, wasn't like he hated us. Hell during encrypted we revived him several times and he did the same for us. Just a silly tale of petty revenge that folks are getting way too upset about.
---
Here's the map bro, happy traveling.

---
This sounds just like what I want to try on my lvl 10 alt, thanks dude.
---
Yeah, I would not be able to deal with the limit you guys have on Xbox and PS4.
---
I had the auto bug happen today but I have been writing down my score before I log off and I had just hit lev 49 on the board and had 0 score towards lev 50 logged in about 5 after 12 (est) I logged in and 4 had auto completed I was kinda pissed cuz it's my first time happening, so I go smoke a cig come back and my score had gone from 0 to 1000 towards lev 50. So there was a few minutes of delay but I was awarded the 250 score per challenge
---
How would you snap it on to a wall? Maybe it was just the certain floor I was trying to use, I used that see through chain looking floor for my overlook porch to get the full view
---
Yes it does
---
I’m totally anti-social. No headset, I hate to text chat. But I always have a team going. It’s a total loss not to.
---
Only joking, cause I could see my kid posting something like this.
---
PvP is dead, get over it or get fucked.
---
Miss that game.  Chesapeake was a hell of a fun shard.
---
there’s no cross platform because beths can’t figure out how to set it up.   you’ll need an account for each platform
---
Sorry I keep assuming PC players, but whatever the back/tab equivalent is on other systems if you use them 😁
---
I do not have a link to the comment but a couple have mentioned they want to implement one, but there has been no official announcement of it coming so I wouldn't hold your breath for it coming soon. It is likely fairly low priority at the moment.
---
Yup. Correct.
---
Perhaps my comment was a bit too generalised. Hiding can be a thrill if you let it be. But I'm sure some people just find a spot then jump on their phone until the storm moves. Personally, if I'm playing a hiding round (and not in a bush), I set my CAMP down and decorate.
---
How about you stop spreading hate you simp

That is from the hole on one of the greens in the Whitespring's golf course. There is usually a ghoul that spawns inside it.
---
This is why public events need shared kill exp for everyone in the event. Right now, with double exp, no one wants to go get ore. I normally throw on my xcavator PA to grab all the ore in every chamber, but I lose out on soooo much exp doing this. It really sucks to do the work to complete the event but get the least reward.
---
You can actually set the group to building, swap to hunting before she dies, then swap to event after she dies and get double XP for the legendary kill and double XP for the event.
---
I checked and i definitely didnt so i idk.
---
Looks like the first two comments ignored your suggestion for correcting the possibility of leeching. Just as you need to get a certain amount of damage done to the SBQ to get her loot, attach some “point” value to event activities, and if someone has met that threshold, even if they didn’t get a hit on the legendary they can loot it. 
---
Because the problem you have now is that people will rely on others to do the objectives and get set to instantly kill the legendary creature.
---
Wow, great pics and  thanks for sharing! 
---
All the quirks and headaches aside, I must say that this feature is perhaps one of the most unsung heroes of the game.
---
Yeah this would just result in a Fasnacht style respawn limbo graveyard at the SBQ trying to collect rewards all day.
---
U sure bc ive been getting random atoms out of no where
---
Get the Secret Service Under-armor and Shielded lining for 450 bullion total.  The best stat increase of all the under-armors in game.   [Strength](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) \+4, [Perception](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) \+2 [Endurance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Endurance) \+4
---
Bethesda said this change would be implemented sometime this year.
---
Actually they said they wanted to do something like this already. 
---
However since this is bethesda im sure it takes a million lines of code and 3 years of testing.
---
faction events can't be public you have to be participating with that faction to do their event.
---
If you are not or have not actually been to the bunker you can't see or participate in an Enclave event
---
If you have not started the brotherhood quest-line you can't see or participate in their events such as Distant Thunder, line in the sand, surface to air, etc.
---
Public events are not faction specific.
---
The quality of these make me a little sad I play on XBox. Just knowing that this game could be this good to look at...
---
I'm not doing dailies or weeklies tho. I'm doing combat challenges
---
I lost 2000 yesterday. They don’t even respond to tickets about this anymore.
---
Well it's not broken broken I just started and finished it this past week. 
---
Make sure you log in and out, restart your system, and wait for server reset to make sure it's not just a bug.
---
I did remember one point being confusing because I was told to go to one place but the map marker was elsewhere in the map. So make sure you're following the marker.
---
They also have back doors / you betta’ or else front door knocks on big companies like Google and FB
---
You just need a friend or private server to transfer gear, but a small account stash would be much better.
---
I felt this
---
You need to level up and get perk card packs in nuclear winter, I got the shotgunner and commando perks in nw and those weapons do substantially more damage. Check your perk load out when you’re in the waiting room in vault 51
---
You aren't getting a 10% increase to overall XP though 🤦‍♀️ jeez, you simply can't read. Glad I have wasted my time trying to fully inform you on exactly how the XP bonuses work lol. Oh well. Hopefully, this helps anybody else understand it fully.
---
I didn't really do anything particular.
---
I saw it somewhere, I tried and it worked. Maybe because I am using a different floor? Think that floor came with the contemporary plan... 🤔🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Don’t know what to tell you
---
Yes you dont get atoms for dailies and weeklies. You get score points to level up the legendary run. There are levels you can obtain in the legendary run that give you atoms as a reward.
---
Thanks that one kind of happened by accident. I went afk because my kids needed me and came back to it standing idle about four feet away and he looked just as I took the photo.
---
Thanks, I absolutely agree. What I love most is the ease of use compared to other games that have a Photomode. I would love to have the versatility of this Photomode in RDR2 or Division 2.
---
I can think of three reasons why your teammates running away from you. 
---
1. They are running to find boxes to loot (if you see the box they are running for, don't race them and try to get the box for yourself).
---
2. They moving around all the time because a player that standing still is a much easier target than a moving one. 
---
3. They're bushwookies and don't want to share the same bush. 
---
Staying a bit close to the rest of the team is good, but there's no point to follow every step they take. If one teammate takes left around a building, take the right side and meet on the other side for example
---
I am a bush wookie and a bro. I'll share my bush, sure, or drag you to another safer, bigger bush. But AFK players get the boot. They're generally the only thing I actively kill.
---
I can't remember the name offhand, but one of the earliest MMO titles to appear had graphics that made characters look like cartoons. People referred to them as toons as a result and it was a term that stuck as time moved on. It well predates the arrival of WoW.
---
Nice! I lost all of my old ones. thanks for sharing.
---
I found a nice source of lead in a good spot and have had my camp there ever since. It’s nice to always have enough to make more bullets.
---
Sorry, I don't enjoy hunting in the grass to find the body that "I'm sure it was around here somewhere!"
---
Omfg I’ve got several people to read this and you’re making absolutely no sense, I’m perfectly capable of reading and do maths at university and understand how percentages work, any xp gain is from the base xp, that’s pretty easy to understand
---
It is bugged
---
Same here:(
---
I’m running commando and skeet shooting currently. I guess it just makes the shotguns more accurate, not damage.
---
I never got anything badass like that get dropped for me when I was a nooby. That’s called luck right there. In fact it’s the same type of luck that’s involved with getting good gear the normal way!
---
I understand those things but people literally mad face me if I'm anywhere near them. 
---
I guess I'll go solo.
---
No because then ill have to fight you for it
---
If you plan to upgrade to the next Gen, I believe the devs have mentions that you will be able to move everything over without having to purchase again.
---
Lol I just hit 24 today.  I don’t team up though so I’m probably behind
---
was it thousands? were they all veteran players? and what makes it wrong?
---
Solid 8. I think it's a great, most definitely above average game. I think my enjoyment and fun factor in a lot towards that 8/10. Having a survival fallout multiplayer game with base building is a dream come true for my fiance and me. Playing the game with her also increases the fun had - as a single player experience I'd probably rate it closer to a 6.
---
There are a lot of bugs and quite frankly asinine issues that shouldn't even exist. However, I still have a lot of fun with the game, and so my rating stands.
---
I’ve used toon to talk about a game character since I was playing SWG
---
They know, the end rewards are just shit compared to farming the XP.  It's terrible design.  Did RR today, ran ore, heard some legendaries go off, got none of them.  Shit design.  Absolute shit design.
---
Honestly Bethesda did a very very good job with the scenery of the game, I give them huge props on it
---
Sounds kinda like Biv's quests for getting new alcohol recipes. I would say instead of taking up a lot of CAMP budget, just limit how many can be planted per CAMP. Essentially so that you have the convenience of 1 or 2 plants at your CAMP (essentially just to make what you need for that day), but if you want to do any bulk crafting/cooking, you need to go searching. Or maybe something like, unlike traditional crops, these don't regenerate (or only regenerate so many times). So you can plant and harvest them, but at some point, you need to replant them.
---
Came from all the other MMO players...
---
100% the reason I stopped spending Atoms. No sense in buying stuff if I can't put it in my camp. My camp is already full.
---
Is there a good lfg for a cooperative 4 man team??
---
This! Been using it since SWG
---
Future tent?
---
Oh my
---
Oh, well based on that singular anecdote, I guess you must be right.
---
Exactly Lol
---
Well, shit.
---
Yes the camp foundation thing lol , cant find a word in English for it
---
Someone said earlier that it was bugged. Guess you confirmed it.
---
~25 people complaining on Reddit anonymously apparently means thousands. 
---
Servers aren’t dead lol. 10K people on steam alone right now. 
---
It’s the #20 most played game on Xbox right now also
---
I've already had discussions about how shit the rewards are. Im not gonna pretend they're good which is why I'd rather they just go back to giving us atoms to i can buy the rewards that i personally like. 
---
This has essentially gone from giving me the option of what rewards I get, by giving me atoms and allowing me to buy the rewards I like, to telling me - "this is what you are getting, like it or dont".
---
I'm also not trying to complain about timegating, though this game is packed with it, I'm complaining about the lack of new content and the amount of grinds they're adding new endgame content to make these grinds a little bit less tedious. 
---
I LIKE grinds. I play D2 and everything in that game is a grind and its fun because there is a diverse range of content to go with those grinds
---
I gotcha. I know I see a lot of Netflix and hide posts and I agree that hiding for rewards doesn't seem all to entertaining. Now, extreme hide and seek on the other hand is damn entertaining.
---
OMG, bloodied, what an awful playstyle, completely useless.  Thanks for the scrip!
---
I'm only at Rank 12 (the leather Ghillie paint). Now that's lagging behind lol
---
I'm not sure what lfg means...
---
Ah so I should select a card each level but just not open packs? At approximately what level do people have all cards?
---
Agreed
---
No you’re getting 10% more from the base value, that’s still a huge amount when you add up for EVERY SINGLE KILL YOU MAKE WHILE PLAYING compared to just the reward xp from an event, jeez...
---
I have yet to run  into a dead server and I play nightly on xbox. I think there are plenty of people, but because they dont have an active vendor it only looks dead.
---
Its unlikely there are a lot of dead servers because FO76 is now in the top 20 games on xbox.
---
Established that it’s broken
---
tons of people playing right now, they didn't get enough imo, still see cheaters playing.
---
On the 2020 Road Map they teased Instanced Camps. I imagine the budget will be significantly bigger.
---
no, codes have been deciphered within an hour of weekly reset
---
We already have events where you get little or nothing if you don't contribute eg Scorched Earth. So it's not like they can't put in a similar system.
---
Also who cares about "leeches"? So long as enough people contribute to the event so that it succeeds, you still get rewarded all the same.
---
Seems dumb to turn down a fairer system for rewards. Would MUCH prefer that everyone there is rewarded, even if their contribution is zero/minimal VS one person one shotting the event legendary &amp; only getting the reward for themselves, even if the event fails.
---
The servers aren't dead as such. A lot less high levels but a lot more low levels. Both because bans and gamepass.
---
Try a different sub for your bartering needs. This sub doesn’t allow that. 
---
As for the nuke codes, it just depends on where you go. I used to search for them manually but now I just use nukacrypt instead.
---
who am i simping for lmao? i dont think you know that that means
---
I went a little crazy on it: I bought 35 levels with saved up atoms. Still got 1200 left. Now level 81. The combat rifle paint does not work on the fixer. I've got chickens.
---
One can only hope so right ? Lol
---
Check your stash under aid.
---
Why do you think so many people are advising to take brain fungus soup for an intelligence boost? 🤦🏻‍♀️
---
At level 26 you should have 32 special points
---
With mod called Perk Manager, you dont have that problem, it will auto hide that popup and is such a QoL thing to have otherwise...
---
Foodyhoward
---
Didn't know about this until your response.   
---
I didn't say anything that wasn't true. My sources were the facebook exploit groups and information people shared from previous ban waves. Why the fuck anybody would down vote my post, particularly on a dead thread is beyond me...
---
Anybody can look up the information themselves.  Some people have supposedly been unbanned already.
---
It used to be rank 100 to unlock everything but then they lowered it to 50...
---
I'm still sad that I joined a group and noticed one of them was at a silo. I was just like oh okay neat, nuke drop soon. Until they launched the nuke and completed MY quest for it. Was pretty frustrated for a second.
---
Just south of Morgantown on the road right under the bridge is a junk node I had a camp there for a long time
---
And just south east of crater is a spot where you can get lead and junk nodes at the same time but it's on a steep hill so need to get creative with your biulds
---
Wait why 32 i thought u get 1 special point per level
---
Absolutely. I created an alt myself to explore this concept: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/hoyxd8/created_a_new_toon_today_officer_trump_reporting/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
I quickly realized that it was unnecessary and I just went ahead and re-spec’d my main character. My alt is now a pure melee build because I want to see how OP it is. 
---
Good to know that if I ever want to do a heavy gun + PA build it’s just a few perk cards away, not a major re-spec like I just did.
---
Hm..maybe you "stole" from a loot bag that wasn't your kill? If you don't steal boxes or bags, then I think you just had some bad luck with grumpy teammates. :/
---
Same thing here since PC gamepass hit too.  Tons of new players who are still figuring things out and aren't to the point of being able to run vending.  Makes the map look empty even if the server has all player slots filled.
---
Um, why? Vault 51 should just be a NW lobby you can hang out in, edit perks, etc till you decide to queue for a match from the very beginning. Having it as an eventual unlock for adventure mode is pointless compared to that.
---
(150,000+ people die each day)
---
(life goes on)
---
I'm hoping that's a cool exterior you can build up and like a door that takes you to the instanced inside with a different budget.
---
I did this in Borderlands 2. Id give my friend all my money and respec for $10. It was sorta broken but it helped a ton. Not something a game should ever do on purpose imo especially not a current gen one since it's an abusable borderline pointless mechanic if you can bypass it that easily
---
A paddle ball
---
Nicely done. I love the caps.
---
I had it yesterday, completed all daily challenges on log in. Hadn't been into shop or NW. Logged in past the changeover time, logged out about 5 hours previous.
---
Logged a ticket and get a reply. Basically blah blah, we're aware of the issue. So 2500 points lost I reckon. 
---
Glad it's double xp weekend, so can make some up.
---
I do love this games, but it hurts sometimes.
---
Ive actually been having the same thing happen. My character is lv 120 so ive already completed all the easy atom challenges and i havnt seen any notification of completing one either. Not to mention the things ivebeen doing already have the challenges associated with them completed most of the time
---
They should totally give us a nice looking one.  I have a house setup to look more elegant and ballroom-ish with a big ol rusty staircase to go up in the middle of gorgeous flooring.
---
Did you wait 20-25mins? They will respawn around that time if nobody server hopped, killed them and left again.
---
Genius!
---
bUT... But iT dOEsN'T hUrT oTHER pLaYErs!!1!!
---
😂 I was just stating my opinion. I don't really care about leeches but it'll get to a point where hardly anyone actually does the event. I think people should be awarded by their participation rather than everyone gets everything equal. Then the whole lobby would just go afk and not participate.
---
And yet, my server last night had about 15 higher-level players and about six players under level 20. And at both SBQ runs I attended, about 10–12 players showed up, lowest level was about 80.
---
This is beautifully done
---
I don't take anything that I haven't found on my own. I think I'm just getting stuck with rude people.
---
Base combat shotgun holds 8, stinging adds 4, total 12.
---
Yeah I know. I’ve considered it before in the past, but honestly even though it’s not related in the least, with the latest banwave stuff etc I’m not willing to tempt fate with stuff that’s not officially sanctioned regarding mods, even though they’ve always been fine and will probably continue to be. 
---
Probably too cautious, but I’d rather not risk it right now 😁
---
9.  No witch-hunting. Do not ask users to go after other players in game. Do not accuse players of cheating, use [Bethesda's official support pages](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10). Do not name and shame in general.
---
Oh I do that anytime I see it, I've gotten some good weapons and armor from it, worse case a few things for the scrip machine. Got an Instigating Sledgehammer that still 1-shots loads of things at lvl 32.
---
Honestly the only reason I'm pissed is because I'll admit I bought duped items from people (OBVIOUSLY they were duped and those who say "I don't know how to tell what's duped" is a fucking liar lol). BUT, there are still MANY people I know that actually did the duping themselves and supplied other players and they are still somehow playing? I feel like they just hit people at random, or just skimmed through data instead of actually trying to be accurate. And the day after they suspended my account "pending" investigation they charged me for another month of Fallout 1st. Ah well. I know I shouldn't have bought the weapons and I take responsibility for it, just kind of mad they took my money after taking my account. It was fun while it lasted guys, ya'll take care!
---
I won't be on for another 4 hours. Pm me and I can help with some if no one helps you by that time.
---
Good work man!
---
The photo clearly shows the helmet as well as the suit. They’ve done things like this before. Why would they show the helmet and not include it. Is that explained clear enough? Or do you need to step down from your high horse to see it clearer?
---
Ty ty
---
Oh NOW you want to follow the rules.  
---
Hahaha
---
Thats rich!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I'm only on level 32, I hope I can get the plushie soon!  There's a lot of items in this run that I don't care about, but that's one I really want.
---
Yep, I'm enjoying the influx of new players that Gamepass has brought to Appalachia.  After I do my dailies, I hang out in front of Vault 76 with lvl 5 weapons, armor &amp; aid items to give to new players.
---
And overall, 95% of people I've ran across are super friendly, just a handful of toolbags.
---
I think you need an example to show what you’re talking about. Let me give it a shot:
---
The boost for INT is a constant based on the base-level, got that. So if I have INT at 10 and get 128 xp, raising my INT by 4 makes it go to 139.2 just to round up. Event team player gets the same 128 for their lower INT. 
---
Now if one does an event that’s base 1000 do say, the builder gets 1392 xp total but a full event team gets 2560 xp. A difference of 1,168. 
---
So you’d need to kill over 100 base 100 critters to make up the difference. There are naturally events with critters at base 200 and 300 but those events likely also have a higher base payout too. 
---
All the INT boosting is still a good idea, but the team buffs can’t compare. Ergo, building teams are not secretly better for xp, unless events or legendary hunting is off the table for some reason, like... maybe you’re working on your CAMP for a while.
---
I have some
---
Yeah, it wasn't appearing in aid as I said in the OP.  It was there, but not there... somehow.
---
&gt;Then the whole lobby would just go afk and not participate
---
Fasnacht demonstrated otherwise. Yeah, there were leechers but not enough that it affected the event any.
---
Totally agree! But a lot of the limitations are of course because this is more of an "MMO". So our player character is just one of the thousands. We can't really change the landscape or storyline. I think it is cool that the factions exist and some raiders etc can be your friends while still hostile to other players.
---
In regards to armor, it sounds like you haven't reached level 50, or played around with your perks fully. The perks in this game are busted, along with mutations. Early on, yeah my armor/weapons would break annoyingly. But I was also getting new gear constantly so I would just swap em out instead of repairing honestly. Late game, there were so many perks to increase the durability or decrease repair costs that I couldn't care less honestly. It feels like my stuff never breaks, and when it does, repairing doesn't even make a dent in my scrap. I love the "survival" aspects honestly.
---
Besides all that, the biggest thing this game has going for it (for me personally), is that it plays like a Bethesda Fallout game, is online multiplayer, and has CAMP/base building! Those 3 combinations make this game extremely unique imo, and a perfect match for me personally
---
I definitely like the idea of being able to change up weapons on the fly.
---
You only have to leave the Private World for 5 minutes for a reset. Been doing it since October.
---
And shared loot. It would reduce a lot of toxicity in the game.
---
Yesterday I had 2 minutes and 30 seconds left in Feed the People when Scorched Earth popped. As soon as it finishes I fast travel south (33 caps) and as soon as I load in - **The Queen’s reign of terror has ended!**
---
Sigh.
---
I'd be over the moon just with magazines and bobbleheads not using budget... 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
I mean, the sentiment is in the right place, but this still reads like a load of cringe
---
Personally, I agree with you. I don't want endgame items handed to me. 
---
But I wouldn't compare the gifter to a duper or a cheater. If it was me, I would decline the gift and let the guy hand it out elsewhere.  
---
Who knows, though. The guy might not run bloodied, so he could just make use of the explosive effect. I know I didn't run bloody until 160 on my main guy.
---
Ok, so if you understand that, then let's create a comparable scenario... If you do a small event where there's let's say 20 enemies to kill with a base of 100xp and the event completion is 300xp... In this scenario, you're telling me you'd rather take roughly 64.4xp more from 4 int boost than 300xp more from an event team?... Lmao... I get it; someone told you building team was the best, with their half-assed math, and took it as gospel 🙄 it's only good for certain instances, where no other XP boost is applicable. That's it 🤷‍♀️
---
You spelled dupers wrong.
---
^^^ Even Charlie Manson was not as entitled as this guy!  
---
If the name fits....
---
While those are bad manners for sure, in the end this is bethesda's fault. This godawful system needs revisiting.
---
Given that a vending machine takes up about half a tile, I don't see how it's possible without glitches.
---
Umm, what exactly did you think the quad was doing to your shotgun?
---
Yeah, I see your side of it but I feel others can share opinions 😂. No? I just feel events should be based off of participation and you don't.
---
Not a duper, but just added a twerp to my block list.
---
Did you look under headwear or helmets?
---
This has happened to me once 🙄Now I remove bloody mess instead.
---
Pc though, otherwise I’d be glad to help
---
Because you haven't applied enough thought to it.
---
[redacted]
---
Same people that do this are the ones who say you shouldn't be upset because it's garbage/low-level/everyone has too much to scrap for scrip. It's ok to not one-shot everything all the time. Resources aren't that hard to come by. Just make a lower level weapon for things like that. It isn't that difficult. Keep the weapon on you at all times and some ammo for it.
---
Have I said otherwise? Of course you can share your opinion, in much the same way I'm sharing my disagreement of it.
---
The players didn’t ban them, Bethesda did.
---
A fair amount of people here heard that cheaters were banned, and dance and cheer.  They don’t want to be reminded that code picked out these cheaters, and code isn’t something Bethesda is very good at in this game.
---
Don’t even get me started on how useless non-hardware bans are.  The cheaters aren’t really gone, they just lost their cheat mules, they can make another and get right back to work real easy.
---
People that got caught by the code, buggy or no, that probably shouldn’t have been?  well, we just won’t talk about those people.  They may get justice in a few months.
---
Note: I’ve not been banned.
---
Honestly, I hadn't thought about that until now. I just get high and shoot shit up lol
---
Everything needs mutations
---
lol, it depends on situation :)  
---
but basically in my childhood I was huge fan of MM
---
Lol yupp
---
If you glitch it through a doorway then put it back into a normal wall
---
Veteran for the whole 5 days they spent duping on their burner accounts
---
Thanks for the help , I didn't know, I'm going on over to the Market place sub now.
---
You can put them sideways. length ways. People can still access them. Like books on a shelf.
---
Ya feeling me?
---
Here's a couple things I picked in my time playing
---
1) Change the underarmor with things you have unlocked through NW or purchased through Atom store to get rid of the Vault suit.  You can make the change in the Atom shop. If you don't have an alternative,  I just drop the suit. You stick out less and gives you a little more room to carry things.
---
2)  When picking a location to drop, spread out a little bit from your so you can gear up better.  Often folks will drop on each other and it makes it pretty hard to get gear.
---
3) It's often a good idea to drop a little bit outside of your intended destination. This way, if the area turns out to be packed, you can better figure out your options instead of spawning on top of an enemy team. 
---
4) Try to keep a melee weapon or a crossbow on hand for NPC mobs to help avoid giving yourself away to other players.
---
5) Go into 3rd person when hiding in bushes or looking over cliff edges. You can get a better view of your surroundings.
---
6) For the sake of inventory management, try not to take too many weapons. I tend to just stick with a long range weapon (scoped lever, hunting rifle), something for close range (submachine gun, handmade), and a small melee weapon or crossbow for NPCs. After that it's just meds and grenades. (I will take the ammo though to deny my opponent hehe)
---
7) Use your drugs. Since many have fair timers, I tend to use them as I get them, especially if I am moving positions. Don't wait til the shooting starts to pop them as you'll need that time to run, shoot, heal
---
8) Stay towards the edge of ring to avoid getting hit from behind.
---
9) 40mm grenades weight more than regular ammo. Don't pick it up unless you are using the grenade launcher since you'll end up overweight pretty quickly.
---
Which ones do you need?
---
i dont know why i asked, its not like i expected something clever.
---
Pretty big but definitely a cool idea.
---
We dont need no stinking cheaters!
---
Bye Felicia!!!!!
---
I've found a ghoul can spot me from a mile off whilst I can jump on top of a super mutant without being spotted. I also can't fast travel with enemies nearby despite being hidden, but can if I'm in danger. A level 1 turret will spot me before a level 80 scorchbeast would. It tends to work in my favor so I can't complain.
---
There's a junk spot right near fissure site prime. Got a great view of nukes.
---
Just had this happen with Campfire Tales. While I was gathering sticks to keep the fire lit and a few other low-level players killed the mobs, a level 200+ guy gibbed the legendary spawn before any of us could even look at it. Dude just sat on top of the pavilion the rest of the time, to boot.
---
Shows up, doesn't help, one-shots legendary, leaves. It was annoying for me and the others who actually were participating and moving the event along.
---
Absolutely
---
Better yet, bury your fusion generator.
---
The only real downside of this trick is that you need a moderate slope to accomplish it... but once done, the generator is untargetable even by YOU! While that caveat might sound bad, you can still start a wire on another item and attach it to the receptacle sticking out of the block. That said, let's begin!

You need to be able to place the foundation pieces in question as high as they can go, which might well mean starting else where and doing the generator part down the slope. This might take a moderate amount of time, patience and fiddling but it's worth it both from an aesthetic perspective and peace of mind that your generator is safe forever (short of a nuke presumably and maybe sustained enough SB scream spam).
---
So, the long and short is that your generator needs to be centered (width) in between two foundation pieces AND between the blocks you're going to place on top of it (depth). Start by placing two contiguous blocks at maximum height, preferably on a downward slope. Stand on them, facing so that you're looking at the long side. The generator needs to be centered between the blocks AND approximately centered (depth) if you were to place blocks on top of it... which you will soon enough! This might take a LOT of fiddling, so don't get frustrated! :)
---
Once you've placed the generator, simply put the foundation blocks on top of it! It's honestly that simple. If you've done it right, only the receptacle (or part of it) will be showing and you can't target the generator at all now. You can still snap wires to it, just not from it. You might want to consider tailoring your build so that this is either a dedicated electrical/switch room, behind your vending machines or somewhere you can start a hidden power network from... I've done all 3 in my current setup.
---
I've had my best success rate across from The Whitespring station, but there probably many places in the world that have a steep enough slope to manage it. It might take a LOT of trial and error, even once you've managed to get it to work. But it is absolutely worth your time. Not only does it look SO much nicer not having it taking up all that space, but it frees you from one of the bigger worries imho.
---
Also why does everyone keep creating groups when others aren’t full? 
---
I first thought it was because they were trying to get friends into them but I’ll see someone in an empty building group on their own and there will be two others half full. 
---
Well you can ! I imagine it's not easy to implement but some games did it ; it's like an instance, even though it's outside. Players will be in different phases as long as the requested quest is not completed. Again, it's truly an amazing tool for immersion :)
---
Lols
---
I can only do 1 with a generator, sleeping bag and cooking station. It’s my self contained mini base. I have a separate building with a workbench.
---
Changed back to raider one , moved camp and it started working
---
Ya skeet shooting doesn’t help damage much I think it helps accuracy. When I play I always find automatic rifles and shotguns so I thought those would be perfect, but I’m in the same boat as you guys, I suck at nuclear winter most of the time but I got 5 kills in one match once I equipped those perks but I’m lucky to get one kill normally. Also I just spawn near my teammates and follow them around if I can, but you’re right sometimes they want to split up which is silly because I’ve won multiple times by bush camping near my team so you always have backup
---
I know right
---
Then hold "controller button". Not a huge leap.
---
lollerskates
---
I just got them to fit, the middle one is a bit wanky, but I'll keep on trying.
---
The people in DA's discord are saying "60-80%" of the playerbase got banned 🤡 I wonder what it must be like to be incapable of comprehending that not everybody cheats
---
for the extra more frugal, removing the paint counts too
---
I’d be happy with that. 
---
I’d settle for just side mounting stairs like Fo4 to be honest
---
Ugh, just terrible...
---
that these aren’t available as loading screens for my game. 
---
Thank you! The caps are definitely what took the most time as well lol. As seen.
---
Egghead

---
Thanks a lot!
---
I think enclave are fine and should have a bonus if you are part of the enclave like getting a nuke code or card.
---
They are already pretty hard and normally have 2 legendary spawns.
---
You find that type of person in any multiplayer game. Odds are he is the same guy finding a sniping perch to improve his K/D ratio rather than helping with the objective in other multiplayer games.
---
Yeah, I've been trying that, got them to fit but not perfectly, it looks a bit wanky, I'll keep on trying to get it to fit better
---
The more you know .  Thanks . Solid advice
---
Wait til you see what writers google. The results will shock you.
---
Yeah worst comes to worst get scrips and save them up
---
That's cool, would love to see a picture.
---
Thanks. I have no problem with anyone using them for that purpose.
---
These are some of the best I’ve seen, great work!
---
Or they could drop nuke codes or cards as a bonus reward.
---
Then you could even add account specific nuke codes.
---
Cool Camp and awesome production
---
Sometimes a bit wanky is all you can do.
---
*"We'll look into this, thanks!"*
---
*"The development team is aware of this issue!"*
---
*"Thanks, we'll pass this up the chain!"*
---
Curious how those palliatives appear in some threads, generally those being worked on like the various new or returned bugs in patch 20. But this problem that has made Nuclear Winter almost unplayable on PC yet still mandatory to max out SCORE points... not a whisper.
---
You can @ them all you want, you'll never see an answer.
---
Not even a worthless one like those above.
---
Or...after breaking his legs off leave him to die by a river of lava so that Master will find him and build him into a even more formidable Super Mutant Cyborg.  They could use robobrain parts and give it telekinesis-like capabilities.
---
You wouldn't get your bonds fast enough
---
Looking for group
---
Honestly Bethesda would be missing out on money if they didnt add this
---
God, that would fill your entire CAMP budget and I am here for it
---
You will get the bonus effect of the relish but it won't satisfy your hunger.
---
Every time I see these posts I reiterate my method hoping it actually works *and* helps a fellow wastelander.
---
I've logged every day so far for the challenges and haven't had a single issue. Here's what I do:
---
Log out 1130 est. Wait until 1230 est to play.
---
Make sure you were in adventure mode before the reset. Do not end your session in NW.
---
Do not check the atom store, legendary board, or social menu before logging in for the first time after reset.
---
Do the NW challenges dead last.
---
This by no means is an endorsement of the issue. Yes this shouldn't happen. Yes I wish they'd fix it (just in case someone says "I shouldn't have to do this"). This all may be superstition but I haven't had a single issue (and used to have this a lot back when it was atoms not score). Good luck and sorry this is happening.
---
DON'T stare into the turrets. Oh, and the ballistic Mr.Gutsies are strong
---
Bonds don't decrease unless you leave the team. My friends and I run a 4 man team all the time and swapping the team type keeps all bonds full, try it out. It's pretty great.
---
Nice. Well yeah, it works as an additive bonus. Base capacity for a combat shotgun is 8, so it adds +24 so your base on the quad is 32. But the stinging magazine still only adds 2 to make 34, it isn't multiplied up to 40. Generally on any quad weapon you're better off going for max damage penetration since the bonus capacity from mods will be negligible compared to what you have
---
^Shit, ^he's ^onto ^us!
---
VATS has been messed up longer than that.
---
This guy gets it
---
So screw everyone else then? Especially mute/deaf people and others just either not wanting or not having a mic.
---
No shit sherlock, some people cant afford a pc
---
Hm it does seem to be after a small amount of time like you said but it didn’t used to be like that for me
---
Use friendly fire perk and a flame weapon to heal friendly animals.   Works on brahmin too when escorting them.    
---
Very few people do this is why.
---
Oh then that sounds fucking amazing
---
because its a paint not an outfit
---
Max reward gives a chance for the Emmett Mountain Hazmat suit, and the radiation barrels plan.
---
Those are the only worth while drops as far as I know.
---
Hacking level 3 and Chinese Stealth Armor (or -damage from robots armor).
---
no they have been that way forever.
---
Take some sort of rad protection, be in hazmat, PA or whatever for a specific portion of the run. 
---
Take more than one card, it’s one and done so if you fuck it typing the code it’s gone. 
---
Consider troubleshooter armour if you think you may struggle against robots. 
---
Take the time to explore everything, as the first time can never really be repeated with the same feeling, so make the most of it 
---
However also remember that robots keep coming until you complete the mini objective in each area so if you dwell before doing that they’ll just keep coming. 
---
Prepare for assaultron head rape. 
---
Take plenty of meds, as dying starts you right at the start again. Gets annoying running endlessly through stuff you’ve already done. 
---
Pick your nuke location well.
---
The turrets are the biggest pain in the bollocks. You can hack them via terminal if you want.
---
That’ll do for now I reckon. Good luck!
---
My secondary weapon for my heavy gunner is more ammo for my primary weapon.
---
I don’t think that is the norm at all and that guy is just a dick
---
Yeah but it never really affected me before. My melee was always pretty clean
---
These are great - super artistic w/ amazing lighting!! I love taking photos in this game while exploring.
---
My bf and I started dating a bit before the game came out so my loading screens are full of photos of the two of us playing that I've taken. If we ever break up on bad terms I'm gonna be super sad if I gotta remove them all.
---
Definitely used "toon" when I played The Realm. Man, that game was terrible but I loved it so much.
---
I'm still at the rusty pick selling legendaries from the fasnacht event.  Still got like a week before I'm unencumbered.  Why is everyone caring about xp? Is there new perks or something?
---
I could've saved so many screws if I had come here first..
---
I've resorted to mass crafting pepperoni rolls and running lvl 3 good with salt. Also running carnivore, herd mentality, strange in numbers and public teams
---
That's a super dick move
---
Well you shouldn't be chasing after yogis and boo boo at that level that's for sure.  What region were you in?  Yes the guy is an asshat but I've swiped low levels materials when they were trying bleach of me in the bog events.
---
I already do this but I didn't know hacking could get you other explosive weapons I'll try that.
---
I also noticed grenades can be super strong and especially the nuka grenade has a massive radius and can down a whole squad.
---
I did that a couple days ago. Since adrenaline is borked I moved those 5 points over to int for now. That extra 10% is noticeable.
---
Emotes are a thing.
---
Different nuka girls huh? I had no clue I needed that
---
Just south of white springs resort, there's a iron and stone fence on the edge of the golf course. There's a gap in the fence and on the uglier dirt side there's a junk deposite. I built my camp there. Was able to built part of it on the golf course itself. Other perks are a cave where a yao guai sleeping, a cart with lots of rat poison on it for lead and an active fissure just down the road.
---
You just seem to feel very strongly against my opinion 😂😂
---
Oh my I have that same exact weapon.  Bloodied Explosive MG with fast reload speed. 
---
It’s not quite as silly as my QE Harpoon Gun or AAE Gatling Plasma but damn that’s a nice weapon
---
For me I sort of wish they had given us he ability to play the game pre and post wastelanders. The world was boring before but there was something sweet about the desolation. Reason being is the new players don't get to see how the world was. How crater looked before raiders took it.
---
If that change continued it would'nt be fair or as fun for casual players to see the world as it is not fair to new players coming on board. To miss a large chunk of the lore is like buying a game and only being able to play the second half.
---
I'd only like this if you could actually visit each "chapter" or stage of each.
---
I've noticed too since wastelanders, I am unable to build my camp in interesting locations. One could take over a house that already exists. Now it's part of a quest and unable to have. I liked walking down a road and seeing a random house with a real person waving to me from it's porch.
---
Anyone also thing that these gain an overseer level should be worth 500 score?? I started a new character just for that one daily, cuz the first time it took me way too long.
---
Switch leaders so the others can complete main quests with backup
---
&gt; More people visit hang around and use the facilities here than in my mains. And they are in exact same spot. Also it seems to get attacked less and just by legit wandering mobs and i dont even have a single turret.
---
I think this is a "feature".  In FO4, defenses you built would decrease the number of attacks a settlement was subjected to.  In FO76 it seems to be the opposite.  The more defenses, the more you get attacked.
---
It took a while to sink in that they didn't, honestly. I was looking on the wikia and all over for a plan I missed, or an atom item that was released in the first few months of the games life, but nope. Rusty metal or a vault.
---
While you're at WS be sure to kill the sentry bots. With double xp and a couple buffs you can get 2k or more for each one, and there's usually 3 at the hotel.
---
Damn, and I thought I was taking good pictures, these blow mine out of the water. How do you get your photomode pictures from the client to anywhere else?
---
Thank you, for understanding.
---
So what might be happening is that the server is not recognizing that people are close enough to the objectives to spawn mobs, or mobs are spawned, but are glitched and don't move from their spawn points.
---
If you were on PC you could have traded that weapon for a legacy (possibly).
---
I have a launch down to about 15 minutes, by myself.   Without nukacrypt already loaded, i’m done.  Still got 11 launch cards.  Everytime i launch, i run to my target to the nearby train station and watch the extra large fatboy land...
---
But...when i enter the zone, my game freezes and i cant find my own blast, server hopping....
---
Grrrrrrrrr.
---
Tell that to my Quad Explosive Harpoon Gun.  It’s the ultimate one shot PVP monster.
---
I think its spreads like the crud.  I had seen folks talking about the fast travel bug and I was like "What are they talking about?" It finally hit me last week and now I got it.
---
Also can no longer build in a teammates camp, except place a kit if you picked one up for a turret or defensive wall,ect.
---
Very cool!
---
Consumer unfriendly lololololololololol
---
I've definitely noticed this much more in the past couple of weeks,  PS4.
---
I guess, but then we’re just running the same quest 3-4 times, right?
---
I think they do it just F with OCD people like myself.
---
Yeah, I didn't give it a chance cause I was pissed about why I was using it in the first place. Hint, keypad pylons don't work or they let public teams OPEN YOUR SHOP AND BUY 20K WORTH OF SHIT AT MAX CAPS.
---
Clean private, join public, go back to private and enemies should be back, although when I tried the ones outside were low level (dafuq? 🤔), inside it was business as usual tho.
---
I mean to be fair the only other option was pete hiney
---
It’d be nice to get multiple upgrade slots unlocked for each PA piece, that way you could mix and match mods *or* stack them for compounded bonuses (but with decreasing returns for each stacked mod for balance perhaps).
---
Emotes only go so far and don’t do jack all for things like hammering a trade deal or making a message that sticks for something going on instead of having to repeat it a bunch of times with a poor quality mic.
---
Always level 1 but harder to kill than a radroach
---
Yeah I'll try again later. Maybe I had it wrong.
---
Oh, okay. Sorry, I'm not hep to the lingo. Lol.
---
Ask a higher level of they have the "board meeting" hollow tape and if they'll give it to you.  I just found that today, tried it and it worked.  I took it to Rose and I am continuing the quest now.
---
Level 90, I probably won't be on for a little while but feel free to add me, username is the same as gamer tag.
---
I'm gonna disagree, only because different strokes for different folks.
---
It might have been the Ash Heap, I’m not sure. We weren’t bothering that dude at all he even showed us his fancy bedroom in his house and then he chilled at his camp while me and my friend did our thing with the Yao guai
---
This looks like it could be an expansion trailer for fallout. Absolutely loved it!
---
Maybe he should stick to lower level areas for a while. However, swiping low level player junk is cunty, any way you try to slice it.
---
War, war never changes...
---
I just want to be able to decorate with junk. Hopefully with the instanced camps they'll allow us to, since the area is less resource dependent.
---
Like em or hate em, dupers are the reasons why there’s as much legacy’s as they are in the market
---
Try turning ultra low latency mode to ultra on the Nvidia control panel settings for 76. That helped my indoor stutters.
---
That was fucking petty. It's not the norm.
---
Depends on which games/communities you come from. On fallout/wow, an alt can be created on the same account. On other games, you have to create an entirely new account, or purchase one to create alts, and if you're playing honestly, there's no need to do so.
---
Really any game with any form of matchmaking, everyone calls a second account an alt (I've never heard toon on competitive games). You only get on an alt to play in lower bracket games, aka smurfing, which has a very toxic impact on players as for example a 45 minute game can be ruined by a single player. I could go on, alts are often considered mules, which are usually in place to prevent the main account from being banned, etc, in these types of games. In other games I play, an alt **always** means you're up to no good.
---
He's the reason we have to scream 'play the fucking objective' lol
---
Trading sucks in 76. I won't use it. If you really need to, there's the money shaking and come here emotes. I honestly can't see interactions between players that would need to be so detailed. I have a nice mic but choose not to use it in game because the emotes are enough for me.
---
VATS has been broken since Wastelanders release
---
It has been reported, documented and recorded all over every medium.  Bethesda will not acknowledge that a trademark of the game is broken.
---
If they were to actually fix it I might consider getting Fallout 1st, but they would rather add shiny stuff to the atom shop than fix bugs....
---
I am not going to continue the rest of this rant.
---
I love fallout, I hate what bethesda is doing to it, I wish they would sell the IP to someone that actually cared about it.
---
Thanks. I play on PC, so just have to pull the images from where they get stored under My Documents. No idea how it would work on Xbox or PS4
---
It's intentional and also a dick move by Bethesda that it can't be used in NW.
---
I was getting them for that mode and I believe quite a few others thought they could use it too. Thing that gets me the most from this is you CAN use the multi coloured skin that is a 1st exclusive but why the hell would you yet you can't use the guille skin, I'm hoping they are going to patch this
---
Why would they put a “trick” in, in the first place?? Listen to yourself. Look at the photo. It should come with the suit. Why are you arguing about that? Don’t you want more stuff like me?
---
I agree with you on that basis but if you're looking to optimize a build you need them
---
I should get 5k+ for sentry, deathclaw, behemoth etc but it caps out at 4k per mob maximum.  Still nice to have double xp going on though.
---
I mean you're not supposed to be carrying lots of junk with you *just saying*
---
Thank you. The lighting improvements that came with the Wastelanders update have helped a lot.
---
Been launching more nukes recently, it still is something awesome. Even more epic when it’s someone on the map launching it and you get the announcement.
---
Ok, so I'm not alone.  I know it's always been buggy but last night I was missing like 3-4/5 shots at 80%+ on nearly everything I shot at.  You could see the bullets flying like 3 feet over their heads.  It was supremely annoying.  I switched from head shots to torso because of the constant missing.    
---
Like it's not the 95% auto miss bug either.  You DO eventually hit them, and the hit chance fluctuates as it normally would.
---
Yeah there alot of stacking bonuses that help instagnating like extra power attack damage and lower ap cost for power attacks.
---
Thanks I will try this!!!
---
Private server next time?
---
You can’t dictate how others want to play.
---
Even if it was in adventure mode itd be an interior cell and be the same thing you described
---
everytime I read something like this I have to wonder, wtf does a level 261 need junk for?
---
I'm level 66 and I have so much junk, I don't need anymore lol especially not stuff low levels would have. It's asinine
---
For me I try to get everyone to drop with me if not I'll meet up with them later or be by myself later I've only won like 5-10 matches so far but It works out with being in the top 5
---
I ♥️ him
---
What about the fallout first paints?
---
What about them is being reset? Like the regular Tuesday reset or?
---
They could retcon that to allow for more fun.
---
Yeah just like the Area 51 Raid😂
---
Of course not but they are real just very securely hidden
---
One of the doors with the keypad built in  (red door one) doesn’t work. There is also a keypad on a pylon with a keypad on it as part of the advanced connectors  set of plans....that also didn’t work last time I checked. Might have been fixed though
---
[John Oliver](https://youtu.be/1Y1ya-yF35g) did a bit on the piss-poor job our country does at protecting those silos, so the idea isn’t as out-there as you may think
---
Yeah I think bethesda just messed up or it's just not supposed to be for NW. Which is unforunate.
---
It would be a pretty good way to hide things in plain sight though. Real manuals and guides just disguised as video game tips/tutorials. 
---
I’d be surprised if it hasn’t been done tbh. Reminds me of a few years back when there was controversy when it was rumoured GTA 5 was being used as a recruiting tool by ISIL. There were video examples but I don’t know if they were ever proven real.
---
I keep having to re-equip my purchased emotes in the atom shop.
---
Just don't hold onto stuff you don't need.
---
Bulk the Essentials. 
---
Learn where to find important components and get them when you need them.
---
Of course this takes time and effort, but I think it's a lots more authentic than storing infinite resources and adds a lot thi the apocalypse feeling.
---
How do we manage it? We cry
---
I can relate  It's why i tend to private server hop in hope to find those hordes
---
Friday reference FTW
---
THANK for the explanation.
---
Not great for mele ( I run mele bloodied unyielding) but works amazing for shotgun.
---
I love making caps as much as the next person, but I also don’t feel right up charging or even charging at value price. I want to help others enjoy the game and I don’t mind working a little harder to make caps (which usually isn’t a problem for me)
---
😁
---
Hey it's all good, I really appreciate your detailed methodology. I'm trying to make this a one-time issue for myself
---
I don't know if this could be implemented because I have never tried it but:
---
It might be cool to have a building with a garage and a pressure plate to open said garage. On top of the building is a large Mothman statue or something. Activating the pressure plate to open the garage would also activate fire traps that shoot flames out of both the right and the left side of the statue so it looks like the Mothman has burning wings. 
---
It would be unlikely that a player would get hurt since it is on top of a building.
---
I’m at 50 but I admit I spent some of my unused atoms (3 levels I think) and ranked up every time I hit 150 atoms on the board (cause it’s just basically a free level).
---
Didn’t realise rank up was available until this morning
---
Accelerated barrel is bad, the exploit is only maintained when you are consistently hitting shots on the same limb. The accelerated barrel gives it too much spread for it to trigger properly
---
lol I never thought of that :)
---
That’s my view as well, which is why I’m asking - to bring it to people’s attention, since I have seen anyone talking about it.
---
Grocer or Chemist backpack mod might be a better choice.
---
I use the grocer plus level 3 travelling pharmacy and I am basically bringing mountains of stuff with me, which also saves LOTS of stash space.
---
Definitely not the norm. That's a dick move.
---
As a level 127 or something I forget I’m actually trying to SELL some of my accumulated stuff off so I have room in my stash lol if you need junk as a level higher than me you’re doing something wrong
---
The building is probably pretty sturdy. It houses the bunker which was designed as a bomb shelter, after all.
---
I did, it isn’t in there :(
---
I had just over 4k xp for the sentry bots at whitesprings this morning..... If that helps.
---
Hahahahahahahahaha😎🤘
---
The veteran ranger and Official Bush Wookiee^TM outfits both blend in almost perfectly with....bushes. So you can either hide with the downside of having no protection, or have protection with being more visible.
---
Have you tried not getting hit by them?
---
Some are truly masterpieces.
---
I carry my excavator armour in my X01 inventory for when I go over.
---
Proof?
---
Ahh okay your probably right
---
Yeah it made me sad too 🙁
---
Hell ya! Just need the team lead to be on point is all. I usually have my buddy let me know when she goes down so I can be ready to swap
---
They are fast as fck boiiiii
---
Yea same i do not know how people manage to sell them otherwise. My plans range from 9c to 29c for the majority. Any rare one i go 49c tops. I would rather sell it and get the space back.
---
And yes serums you can always guatantee a good price for. I still usually sell at 399c and they go at a decent pace. Usually 1 or 2 for every hour of gameplay.
---
Gat Gun, hands down most efficient gun in the game
---
One of the legendary reddit posts. Right up there with the poop knife
---
This is all really good advice. Thanks a lot!
---
I get where you're coming from. Still, I prefer alt or char over toon. Sounds so childish like I'm making a character for Roblox.
---
We all just fuck around. We play this to be social and have fun, not grind and worry about what to do next. That’s just my group, though.
---
They're both pretty meh-tier. I would choose a long term build with the assumption that the stacking furious bug gets fixed, so the two shot would probably be a bit better then. Two shot isn't that good on a minigun, but if you use a tri barrel, it should still be accurate enough to use at mid range while benefiting from the damage bonus. Vats aim is worthless on it, right now it just causes the furious bug. +50DR while aiming isn't great but it's much better than reload speed, you're not ever really going to be reloading a minigun in the middle of a fight except during the SBQ fight, and speed demon would render it almost useless anyway
---
What a douche
---
Blocker is your friend
---
Works good for me, I'll clear the whole 8 minutes of radiation rumble without missing a bow vats headshot
---
Exactly my point! It's easy to just not get a hit in sometimes, being active like doing objectives or killing common enemies should defo be enough.
---
I was on the fence for mods, but once I started using them, I can't go back.
---
Perk Manager, making stuff glow so it's easier to spot, and item sorting.
---
The QoL is so much better with mods.
---
Solid Leeroy Jenkins reference.
---
I got the blueprint but it won't let me place in camp. How you do it?
---
Only problem is, I don’t use melee. I Will use it When I get a good bloodied melee weapon
---
So is hiding in a corner during AWOL as a level 16 waiting for the legos to pop.  Better believe I'm gonna put your in between me and the .50cal.sniper rifle those gutsys be packing.
---
Radiation damage, a bloodied players kryptonite. Focus on rad resist with your armor or PA.
---
Figured it out lads. Cheers.
---
Pretty much 90% of my NW time is hiding in a bush
---
It's also a bit of a selfish dick move to do so if the rest of the team isn't playing along side with you. Every time you switch to events, the rest of the team loses out on bonus max 8% XP boost during that time. Worse if you switch it early or forget to switch it back.
---
Don't expect anyone to stay on your team if you keep doing this.
---
All my plans are free apart from some very rare exceptions (fixer being the main one). Although I don’t get many now I don’t take workshops. 
---
I usually throw them all in but I find high levels 200-300 buy them all up in one and then sell them all for profit rather than it helping newbies so I just drop them now. 
---
Same goes with free meds.
---
This I know
---
Prolly toxic valley they pop up there by the graveyard pretty often.  You remember what level the bears were?
---
Bethesda has done little to fix it, people are just spamming it so they try to fix it as soon as possible because it is still broken. If it is annoying to you, just ignore them and continue your life.
---
Yeah exactly what's happened to me, makes events pointless. I only did fasnacht twice this year cos both times the sloth was instakilled, put me off doing it more.
---
No no... The perk blocker under strength will negate a large portion of incoming melee damage. You don't actually need to block. Trust me, you will like this perk.
---
Mine works fine
---
Flamethrower traps can be used to destroy buildings. I've seen videos of players that have used them to destroy everything in the camp. Theoretically you could set it up so it destroys everything except the area where the pressure plate is but you never know if the player will panic and try to escape and this get caught in the ensuing destruction.
---
This is my biggest complaint with it, tbh. I LOVE the armor, but I really miss the variety.
---
I believe that shared loot has been turned on in group and indoors, I’m consistently able to loot kills that teammates got alone at Rad Rum and same vice versa
---
Around level 60-70?
---
Agree, I use Excavator all the time because of the plus 200 weight but I also have all the other PA's in my stash (except T 65) but don't use them because of the lack of carryweight, hoping Bethesda does something like you are proposing
---
It's well established that this can happen to people, even with waiting until after the reset to get on.
---
I've always felt that the calibrated shocks boost should just be a standard feature to all power armor and if we wanted even more carry limit we could add calibrated shocks as a mod for 200 total. It's incredibly stupid that I can carry more when I'm within an inch of death wearing unyielding armor than I can when I'm wearing my T-51b power armor with calibrated shocks.
---
Look for blueprints under the stored tab. Those are created automatically when you move your camp, and contain all the items required to deploy that blueprint. If you don't want it, delete the blueprint, and you will get all those items back under stored. Don't confuse blueprints under stored vs ones under blueprints. The ones under blueprints do not use camp budget.
---
That’s because gaming is an unaddressed addiction.
---
No that’s op, it’s bad enough that you can dress like a bush
---
I think its funny when I scan bushes and my crosshairs light up red even though you cannot see someone inside. Just start blastin that bush!!!
---
Thank you very much 🤣
---
pretty sure it’s nonexistent because a lot of people just see no reason to kill each other if they have no junk on them.
---
Oh, I’m stupidxD thank you, I’ll check it out now!
---
That suit is OP it makes since you have to have it show.  Little drawback for one of the best items in the game.
---
Reread the post I mentioned it should be based on contribution, doing the objectives qualifies rewards. Although I do agree with leeches getting loot for nothing is still better than 1 or 2 people only rewarded
---
Unfortunately the only proven way to get there attention is to wave money at them, or make them think your waving money at them
---
I'm making it a point to be explicit about that part because people show up to every one of these threads with snarky ass attitude telling everyone that it's just because OP was too stupid to log out.
---
While I realize this suck, I just wanna let you know that since you're rank 44, you're ahead of schedule so you can still win.
---
This dudes camp was insane, it looked really expensive - he had a golf course on it. No way he still needs junk
---
That sounds pretty cool. The one I came across was made of fences on a roof. My camp’s fight club is just eight concrete barriers in a square.
---
Whenever I run for ore they all bloody die. 
---
God damn I’ve never passed this event. There’s never enough players in it to make it viable. Yesterday there was four of us and I thought here we go. Turns out nah one of them is going to just sit and afk above the rad showers and the rest is history
---
Oh....
---
\*adds it as a bloodied melee build\*
---
WVian here. Can confirm that the places in game exist, or are based on actual places with their names changed.
---
Edit: the Mothman statue exists in Point Pleasant and there is a festival every year for Mothman.
---
I was thinking that a smaller boxing ring, but I’ve seen people set up a gulag.
---
I want fishing
---
Add more foundations around it. One of them should "anchor" it, letting you delete the original.
---
This. It is insanely powerful.  Should have more drawbacks than it does imo.
---
I thought that basically everybody who played 76 was cool, but you self-righteous do-gooders are crawling out of the woodwork in droves acting like you've never stepped a foot wrong in your miserable, judgy lives. Just listen to yourselves. It's pathetic 😂
---
Picturing some dude looking up how to to do it IRL and all he's finding are things for fallout.
---
But I don't want to set the world on fire.
---
This reads like a creepy Craig's List add. LOL
---
Lvl 138 username same as gamertag. On a building team of 3 right now
---
Jesus how come yours look so damn good and mine look like trash
---
Unless they’ve changed it, it was a rather short distance to get team kill loot last I saw.
---
Nah, it's a trade off. Damage Resist Vs Life in the Bush. Just equip your armor when you're forced to cross a road!
---
Nuking a camp is less optimal than running the queen as far as xp goes ... i want my build group and that isnt guaranteed on private.
---
Besides this isnt at all dictating how someone plays. People are free to Leroy. And I'm allowed to nuke the fuck out of their camp.
---
Plus my lunchbox was the added-damage-against-robots one, so may as well use it.
---
By grinding harder than those unaffected. Not to mention I have no idea how many more times this is going to happen to me.
---
I'm also putting it out there because I took every known precaution and I'm still getting fucked. Every thread is packed with people downplaying the problem because they think they're smarter than everyone else and "OP must just be an idiot who didn't log out."
---
Oh ya grenades are great. You can shoot them with VATS to make them blow up early. Plasma mines are extremely strong too.
---
Yeah. tho once you get it in the game lets you take it just a little bit further sometimes, so I've been doing very minimal adjustments.
---
Glad someone caught it :)
---
I lost all challenges today except the "mod 5 armor pieces" one. First time I had this glitch, but I got contacted by the support and these nice folks helped me :)
---
Excellent pics.
---
Technically speaking we're all being watched by the NSA...remember Snowden? Yeah. You think they've stopped? Fat chance.
---
I bought the Red Rocket garage today, but can’t see it in my c.a.m.p inventory anywhere. I can see the roller door but not the building. Could someone please point me to where to find it. Thanks, and sorry for being dumb!
---
This is an amazing camp... you should submit it to DTD for Camp of the Week!
---
No one cares about pvp.
---
Show for who? The AI you're fighting? It make absolutely no sense that it's the only non powered armor that replaces cosmetics. It's armor, not a cosmetic.
---
So is a set lf unyielding, powered, sent SS/scout/combat armor, but you can still cover that up. I get the whole concept about how the suit functions  and "cant be covered" but its purely cosmetic , and it would be nice if you could cover it and retain your own personal style... it literaly would nok t hurt any gameplay at all....
---
If you stop body-shaming the charred ghouls maybe they’ll be nicer to you.
---
You were in the mire then........those some tough sons a bitches...
---
Maybe just make it some kind of 'herb' garden - all the wild fungi, all the wild berries, all the wild flowers in a planter each tightly packed. When you harvest you get maybe 3 of everything in it, 6 with green thumbs?
---
I'd not be against individual planting, but the fucking camp budget...
---
No mic, but down to use a lunchbox
---
In what way?
---
Everytime I do a SQB dhe drops nothing for me. Even if I hit her.
---
They took information from me about the glitch in order to fix it.
---
😂😂😂I was waiting for a comment like yours
---
So I didn’t get to that board tile yet. But I have the atom shop suit and I just checked and the helmet for me is under headwear.
---
1. Lay Spring Trap. 
---
2. Place fusion generator on top of trap.
---
3. Move trap (generator will be attached) to desired spot. 
---
4. Attach wires
---
5. Exit build mode and trigger trap. 
---
6. Your generator is now invincible and invisible.
---
PS4 its the norm sadly
---
Hazmat suit? Back packs? All run off the same idea.  You get insane benefits so you have to look at it...I didnt make the rules.
---
The Enclave exists,and *are* watching you.
---
What you don't see is the 20 to 30 shots I had to delete before I got one I was satisfied with. The one shot of the ghoul I took about 35 just to get that shot.
---
I’ve lost score twice, once while being logged in, so I don’t do that anymore.
---
The other time, no clue.  I’m only out 1750, so condolences are all I have.
---
I personally have a little routine I do each day while eating breakfast and then I close everything down 15 minutes before.  At this point I don’t think anyone had IDed a specific “ah ha” for those still losing score.  The fact people pop into threads to bash the OP... well that’s a larger issue with this sub, and people who are perceived as bashing Bethesda.
---
&gt; looking at logging events that could be causing this
---
It seems like we're watching the pot to try to learn why it's boiling in the first place. More reports on when it does can only help.
---
I collect bottle caps too but I would never have enough patience to do this. Nice Job!
---
Yes, if you're close enough
---
Very well may be the case, the vast majority of Rad kills happen in the main room
---
Imagine how depressing vault 51 must be if it’s not a simulation. For twenty five years, you had the best time of your life. And then the overseer, a computer that had every responsibility taken care of for you, decides that you have to kill your friends and family that you’ve been living with pretty much a third of your life. The last day in the vault is absolutely silent.
---
Have the Thanksgiving display cases been available more then once?
---
I can’t agree more about what you Said about kryptonite
---
Ewww... that explains a lot!
---
I am now inspired to do the same! No longer will I have only odd ball screenshots.
---
And you got your challenges back?
---
Yeah I have been trying to run a pistol build with this but pistols have such weird guns like a wester revolver with no scope.
---
Why they decided to put the assultron head in aswell i don't know.
---
Ya, I don't feel bad at all.
---
There isn't anyone who wouldn't happily murder me if the   situation was reversed.
---
How did you contact them? I had the exact same issue today
---
That's easy: make it no requirement at all. 15 I/L will prevent virtually everyone except bloodies from deciding, skewing the results greatly.
---
It's an empathy test after all, let the people vote.
---
Well done!!!!
---
i promise its not
---
Before 19, it was working just fine for me. I actually did a bungalow challenge to get everything you need inside of one and it came out quite well. But I went back to try again and yeah, was able to run right through the thing. Only the doorway, floor and center ceiling are solid. Bummer. https://youtu.be/jEGCYjx2GW4
---
Very nice job, these are great. Going to put a few choice ones into my photo folder to use. 
---
On another note a workshop style sharing system that allows you to share and use each others photomode photos is long overdue.
---
Didn't look at it, will look tomorrow. Don't think I will get these Chalenges to do them again, but maybe I will get the score (?)
---
A limit wouldn't be a bad idea, I just wasn't sure if that was a system already in place in the CAMPS - I can't think of anything other than Ally benches that have a limit. But 5 of each or something maximum so you can make 2 of most recipes, and have 1 for damaged crop replacement. 
---
To me, if people wanna make cranberry farms, go ahead, the effects don't stack and the food will decay, so there's already a limit. Chems don't decay but they're easy enough to find if you get the right perks.
---
I personally hate the idea of having to go out and replant them. I'd rather have a high cost initially, and then a slower regrowth for balance. If I had to repair them I'd just plant them for aesthetics and then fast travel to hotspots.
---
Yeah, I went to play NW and showed up in a pink suit lol? I thought I had the cool NW ghillie armor skins? still working on my NW build and attire.
---
Whoa, slow down there Anakin...
---
beth, please, some smaller vendors, thx
---
Why
---
So they didn't help you.
---
Sometimes you have to scrap a ton of (item) to learn a mod, and the system apparently doesn’t check to see what you do and don’t know, so sometimes the “learned“ mod is one you already know....
---
I got texted by them on reddit. It was a Comunity manager or something like that.
---
I forgot about the hazmat suit but that shouldn't replace cosmetics either. Backpacks don't replace anything though.
---
I also have a table with a sign that says "donations for other players" that I leave a bag with random stuff in. Most of the time I come back to camp there are more bags or people have added to mine.
---
Game changer.....you'll be happy you did this.
---
PCs are both better spec wise and can also be priced lower so idk what you’re on about
---
15 is the max amount of points you can allocate to a single special.
---
Did they change things? I haven’t played in a bit were there changes? That sounds like it sucks
---
You are probably still good, i never see that workshop being taken.
---
Hmm.  Not ideal.
---
You won’t get any grief from me....
---
It really does. Good With Salt perk is a must have if you want to run any kind of food buff strategy. In-game it's technically right (a few days, no coolers) but in playtime that's nothing.
---
Armor takes much longer than weapons for some reason. Keep at it!
---
-
---
Tip! Get your Treasure Maps and go hunting! You should get many many decent mod plans for both weapons and armor. Some of which are not unlockable by scrapping. Plus, you'll get loads of armor and weapons you can scrap.
---
Tip 2! If you are crafting and scrapping, only craft the lowest level arm, you use less mats and still unlock mods for all pieces in that set. Remember your Perk Cards, Armorer, Super Duper and Scrapper!
---
But i dont have any special on level 15.
---
If you get Line in the Sand and someone has their tent in the glitches spot. It'll cause all the scorched to spawn in a small area right in front of the sonic generator. Use any automatic that has the explosive legendary effect (you can technically also use a grenade launcher but I don't recommend that because it can send the bodies flying) and tag all the scorched. When they turn to meat piles just loot all so they don't get too crowded or start despawning. 
---
I've gotten around 2400 steel each run of the event this way.
---
I'd only run pistols if you're trying to challenge yourself. The revolvers have slower fire rate and do less damage than explosive weapons. And unlike explosive weapons, you have to land a precise shot with reolvers which is 100x more difficult.
---
One-shot them before they one shot you! Works everytime..
---
Just don't use a weapon or armor. Nothing to repair, run lone wanderer action boy dodgy serendipity etc. Using any equipment, mutations, or aid buffs is just a crutch
---
I have had almost the opposite reaction had some dude hold my bag for me
---
No it’s because I don’t particularly enjoy doing events, I would rather farm west tek etc or I’ll do an event where there are massive amounts of mobs such as radiation rumble every couple of hours 
---
AGAIN read the comments and read what I am writing, if you are farming events over and over then go for it, but many players don’t and the vast majority of people that are part of an events team don’t even do events, in this scenario, the building team is much much more useful, jeez people have different ways of playing and different things are useful for different people 
---
So no, I don’t think that’s good for mine and many others people play style that don’t grind events, I’d rather take the small boost for a large amount of enemy kills
---
Wallpaper on both sides of a wall so I can make a proper wall inside my house
---
Do you mean the camp device skin?
---
But you carry on being judgemental and rude that’s fine 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Man these are really good! I really like the Nuka Cola Skull hand
---
Damn, that’s the day I leave home for a while.
---

---
And how about the same option of the greenhouse on certain prefabs to remove the foundation? Circus wagon and Caboose don’t need them
---
Yeah my gf has that bundle too and I asked her to check and it’s there for her. Am I just foolish to assume that something shown in a promotional photo that is part of a set would be included in the actual bundle?
---
They run up to me sonic speed, then I shoot them with my BE weapons, and..... I always kill myself by accident.
---
Sadly even with my full SS unyielding they still do some damage
---
I mean, yeah.  But this is mainly an experiment.
---
Vats. Gauss shotguns not that great unless you use vats. At least for me it's not.
---
Bethesda dont care dude
---
Lol, dump excess legendaries on a mule! No mainly for upping score for the legendary run
---
Same,mines me sleeping in abed while chaos is happening and I got a shot of the queen going a few feet over me while Ina bed lol
---
Yeah, it was a bit of a WTF moment for me when they were added down there
---
why tho? i'm level 43, which is at least close to where a person should be to complete it. and every day i look at the board, i question why i'm putting so much into it. there's really nothing left in the unlocks that i even want. i'm just chugging along at this point for lack of anything else to do.
---
They might not be the same category
---
I don't know, [I found a couple dupers last week](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hq6nnm/for_those_curious_this_is_what_a_hacked_ingame/) and have been bumping the ticket everyday waiting for it to change from investigating. Hopefully those clowns got banned and I dont regret it.
---
How am I supposed to transfer items to a different character? Can I just drop them in a container then join the world as a different character?
---
Yeah , thanks
---
I mean they do have things in photo that are not bundled together with the other items. But I would think if you unlock the suit that they’d give you the helmet. I kinda hope it’s a mistake on their part.
---
Bruh im level 8 two weeks in i pretty much got no chance to get to the end
---
You have to leave the region before you log out. If you log out of your PW near West-Tek, when you log in again, the outside Super Mutants will be low level. Find somewhere in the forest region to log out at, then FT to West-Tek when to get back on.
---
The lighting in the second picture is just...amazing. How is that in the same game I'm playing lol?
---
Also the third picture of the Nuka Cola bottle being held by a skelly...where is that?
---
They do spawn...I think.  Some of the objectives will get taken down.  Like guided meditation you will almost always lose the bridge speaker and sometimes others, but the side speaker never gets attacked.  Same with tea time, the water tower pipe gets attacked but no others.  Uranium fever, literally nothing got attacked.  Easy treasury notes!
---
Note, this only works with the Shishkebab and Flamer. But with the flamer you have to use the bash, which is slow and takes AP. A Shishkebab can just spam light attacks and heal the animals a lot faster. 
---
The heated pitchfork may work, I haven't tried it myself. But the flaming Chainsaw doesn't work last time I tried (which was shortly after wastelanders dropped)
---
Yeah on a private server so no one makes off with your stuff, or ask a friend to hold things for you
---
Nice, I just started on game pass and I'm taking pictures of myself with every skeleton I see.
---
Alot of people complain they should be hidden....not me you get carry wt. you get to look at an ugly sack.
---
I don't think you can use atoms to lvl up yet.....sounds fishy.
---
Oh, nice to know. Thanks. 😊
---
They should work in NW absolutely, hopefully it's fixed
---
I usually put like one item in my vendor at way below it's value, and no one takes it because they don't visit a camp with one or two items.  
---
I'm level 2040. You can get there without cheating if you build for it and play lots on double xps.
---
Is this a serious question or you just trolling?
---
You can, they changed it yesterday. Look for yourself :)
---
yeah. get rid of it. I luckily rolled a junkies a few rolls later. Once you get used to missing that first time in vats it's fantastic.
---
Pro tip: get yourself a rank in gun fu
---
you're right. but i mean, my question, as i asked myself, why do you actually want to complete it? what in the rewards actually appeal to you? some of the skins are kinda cool, but the outlandish skins i always put on once and think 'this is a bit much' and then take it off. i was hyped for the ammo converter but that was the biggest disappointment of the whole ordeal.
---
I hope it works truly. It's unfortunate we spend time figuring this system out legitimately only to be punished by bugs that have been around since beta. Good luck!
---
Thanks, I really got lucky with that second shot. The lighting was perfect. The Nuka Cola shot is from the hole on one of the greens in the Whitespring's golf course. There is usually a ghoul that spawns inside it.
---
I mean im not gonna lie i want that ghillie scout armour and that plush
---
Plus sized ghouls have feelings too!
---
Tried with and without.
---
The game values it as 850 Caps bwhaaaa
---
Simply was not hitting anything right in front of it
---
When it first dropped i was like yes,going to have some fun with this.
---
 i couldn't figure out what was going wrong.
---
Then i looked at the accuracy 3%,sickening.
---
Never owned a Gun that Bad.
---
Right now i have a 90% reduced weight AP Stalkers Gauss,with 16% accuracy.Not great either.
---
Are they all this bad ?
---
To be fair.  He was right.   15 is too early for those quests. The quest reward is lvl 25 suit of pa. 
---
And your junk drops when you die if not the is no reason not to die.  I know it stings at the time but the over all thrill or survival feeling you get because of it is worth the few peices of junk.
---
Guess it's just dependa who you come across.
---
Nobody knows for sure, it is different for everyone.  Friend of a friend got one lifted today, others were months.
---
Displaying it would we useless as I could display a non legendary and have the same effect. If you don't use it,trade for something good,even tho everyone now has alnost everything from the dupe.
---
Is the plasma caster considered a heavy gun and a rifle?  I run the heavy gunner and rifleman perks. Will that fit well?
---
You most likely got it from a quest. He would have had to first set its price and then you would have to go over and accepted it. So your good!
---
Sometime between 3 days and never. I'm not holding my breath that's for sure. Also it's possible that before they lift the suspension they will delete my all of your characters and give you back a blank account to start over with.
---
Had a low level ask me to make him a mutation serum.  It was clear he had no idea how hard the ingedients are to get.  I didnt let on and made it anyways.  Always happy to help out a new player.
---
Yeah, all the time.
---
I've never seen the lighting look that good ever...I was going to say what mods are you using then I remembered this is 76...and it can't really be modded...
---
Ah I'll have to take a look around...
---
I didnt know that I do have fallout 1st so if I'm the only one on the server will my items still be in the container when I log into my mule?
---
got it. I've been told it can take over a month, and I would just the account inventory wiped
---
I already Scripped it.
---
On n first viewing it i was like Yes .
---
Devs are twisted. :-)
---
Thanks for the Tip.
---
fair enough. and those are probably way too far down the board to purchase with atoms, when that finally becomes possible.
---
go for it, the sheepsquatch plushie is in the low 40s and you got 6 weeks on the clock. use the 9 dailies this weekend, farm some xp and you'll be there quite quick.  
---
bc the plushie is cute af, i love having it sitting at my camp :)
---
Depression increased
---
Beckett is bethesda's excuse for not making deacon a romance option and i would like to see anyone try to deny that XD
---
Oh its already available for me to buy tiers and I probably will
---
I always kill him, it's the brotherhood way
---
Yeah man, just join back within a couple of minutes, and make sure you do put it into a container, don’t drop it into a world, I have my mule at the overseer camp and it’s like 2000 over encumbered so I use the container near there, train stations work too
---
I hate when you try to jump away with marsupial and they give you that little nut tap that sends your bloody health over the edge.
---
Put some goodies in the stache @ overseer's camp whenever you pass.
---
A level 1 hunting rifle doesn't do me any good but God damn! - it'll help a new player!
---
If I could up vote twice, I would.
---
This should be a general feature for all events and being in a team, if you're within the range that you can hear that a legendary has mutated, you should be able to loot it, and get experience from it.
---
As a bush wookie I find this hilarious. I'd lose my shit if my bush disappeared all of a sudden. Nice one.
---
Oh my god, I can relate so much about that!
---
Honestly, my take is that the goal was not to give her limb damage immunity, but perhaps some resistance or immunity to the instant cripple perks like enforcer, tormentor, one gun army, etc.  I think they wanted to elongate the battle by making us actually cripple her rather than just have all of her limbs crippled instantly because 10000 rounds just hit her each with a 12 percent chance to cripple something.
---
But in typical style, it just works, and now she cant be crippled period.
---
XDDD
---
I believe by "farming the horde" he means hes leaving the legendary alive to spawn more mobs and farm them for XP not just killing the legendary for gear.
---
AAAAH I NEED IT !,!!!!!!!!!! I have no xp boosting food yet so lunchboxs are descent
---
Yeah exactly my point they used to have two damage perks for the pistol and for some reason they removed them.
---
Literally dying laughing at this mental image... Good play
---
This is nutz, neither of you two are mature enough for relationships it’s seems.
---
A sniper build is a good idea in general, especially a vats commando build.
---
Rifleman also works, but do keep in mind that it is totally outclassed by Commando, so you might want to configure your build such that you can use both interchangeably. 
---
Sneak perks and multipliers are very good in this game as well.
---
If you're not carrying a Hairbrush in your inventory they seem to leave you alone.
---
For some reason they bloody love those things!
---
Your are a lifesaver. I'll try your overseer camp idea omg I'll try it with a few items at first to make sure it works. If it does thank you. I can store all my ammo and stims too. I have over 1000 hours and never knew you could do that. Guess I was too paranoid since the servers werent exactly stable for a long time. I love you!
---
Thats what I’m working on at level 42.  Perception, Intelligence, and Agility are cranked up with all the rifleman cards and maxed tank killer, but also look into maxing sneak and some other agility ones like covert ops.  A piece of chameleon armor in the mix and you’re stoked.  A lot of of my Intelligence points went to weapons and armor mods so I could build scopes, silencers, and other higher-tier mods.
---
Maybe they're like me and only playing NW for the score. In which case, meh.
---
Thats super dope bro!
---
is it? i saw people talking about it yesterday but thought they were talking about eventually, i'll have to log in to see how it works. i'll still probably do the grind until i get close enough to the end to justify spending atoms on it.
---
I did that until I got an unyielding set.  Now I can actually carry more outside of PA
---
Strange, I can solo it.  Have some challenges with Alfa sheepsquatch though.  I always do the ‘deer’ area, just focus on getting the meat back to hopper.  Level 2 is enough, gets you a friendly bear.  Then stick to it like glue and kill the waves.  Ideally get a high level to help finish off the boss.
---
Thanks I will take that into consideration.
---
But..... they don’t have any hair😂 maybe that’s why they attack everything and everyone
---
Edit: I got attacked by like 588 ghouls while writing  that comment😞
---
There are so many types of dupers even the ones that just knowingly bought duped items are getting banned.
---
I’ll probably spend atoms to get to it
---
Tank killer might help but I don't think it shows the damage on the stats
---
No, we shouldnt. Gathering wild/not wild plants was always present in beth rpg games. The routine is not that difficult u know. I always go to the same spots and spend like 20 min in total to gather it all. And that includes everyth for cranberry relish, AP buff and all s.p.e.c.i.a.l buff but  luck. As for chems u can eventially got a lot of them just looting mobs and unless u go as junkie there is no need to use ´em a lot.
---
Wouldnt be useless, may not display its legend bonuses to anyone else, but I would know..  as for dupes, i do not partake in purposeful exploitation of game bugs.  I'd much rather just play and eventualy find that golden item than risk the ban hammer because i was impatient.
---
Adjust your receiver to your cards or vice versa .)
---
This makes me want to share some of my photos that I’ve made. 
---
These look so cool!
---
yeah, that was my case sadly :(
---
how do we sumons that thing?
---
[Yes, and I love it.](https://imgur.com/MbF72iH) All I need is another toy weapon like the croquet mallet and my toy aisle is complete.
---
Lmao what have you been doing all this time? And btw it takes 2 hours most to get lvl 20
---
There are still a lot of high level things. There is one terminal that is over 100 I’m pretty sure. They made the rooms more accessible, but not the actual lore.
---
Sneak attacks cause 2X damage, and you can bump that up a little with perk cards too. 
---
Also, you can mod the actual weapon too.
---
I upgraded my Back pack with the Grocers Perk.
---
Saved me 3 points in Thru Hiker.
---
What is Really annoying though.When someone launches a Nuke,and i jump in to Power Armour.
---
I am instantly extremely over weight.And have to go back and put Thru Hiker Perk back on again.
---
Take it off again when i get out of Power Armour.
---
i have a shit ton of atoms actually, from just not spending the 1st atoms, so i'm with ya on that. i just want to hold out long enough to make it worthwhile.
---
Totally agree, maybe the lack of jetpack was justification for the extra 100lb carry weight set bonus.  I like the PA backpack idea, but would want it on other PA types so I wouldn't have to still be married to excavator.
---
Yeah just stick them in the 20 minute loop, if you want more have some that have to be activated.
---
Luck and by nuking certain points on the map. This was in the sundew Grove near primr fissure
---
I loved galaxies.
---
I count 8 for a total of 2250.
---
I just don’t think im gonna make it without having someone literally guiding me through this but thats never gonna happen
---
sweeeet
---
Where did you find that picture of "help" spelling in boards
---
I wonder if we can pacify them if we have that grey toupee in our inventory. Is that even still in game?!
---
Use explosive bait to blow his main generator
---
Yes!
---
Egg.
---
I've noticed that higher level players buy my 5 56 ammo.
---
I try and gift them 5.56 plus a few chems and maybe even some heavy mini nukes.
---
I might be level 45 (today!) but that doesn't mean I can't be nice
---
White springs vender
---
Haven’t played in some months, what is SCORE actually? Everything I’ve seen makes it sound like lootboxs
---
That is on top of the red rocket and flatwoods.
---
I’ve not seen this event for days, count yourself lucky
---
I'm pretty sure I bought the plans from whitesprings resort shopping mall. I'm not sure which bot though
---
Thank you!!! This is great tips
---
Older than WoW. I played Anarchy Online in 2001 and the clan I was a member of was comprised of veteran EverQuest and Asheron's Call players.
---
They used the word 'toon' about their characters.
---
if you wanna get a sneak shot in vats go into vats, exit vats then enter vats again. Most of the time i just aim down sight kill enemies
---
How low? It's a nice gesture but Starched Genes unlocks at 30, so anyone below that will have to play very, very carefully until they reach that point.
---
I just bought the helmet, I didn't realize how expensive that power armor is! 
---
And is there no mods for the helmet?
---
Does an automatic receiver have a higher base damage?
---
These are great. Thanks for posting!
---
You know.... you start it by yourself. Talk to vinny at the tunnel
---
Here is my stealth rifleman build.  Later you will want to swap out rifleman for command if you want to maximize your damage.  Earlier on it may be better to go rifleman as you use less ammo.
---
You want a Instigating weapon that does double damage when the target is at full hp.  With sneak and that weapon type you can oneshot many normal monsters.  
---
Good luck!

---
Big Grahm absolutely annihilated a glowing wendingo in Lewisburg today 👍
---
Imp or Reb?
---
Yeah I did that when I was starting out, just drop something in there of no value like some water or something to get used to it, no problem man! Enjoy being able to play again 🤣
---
If it were triggerable no one would do it or even trigger it. Look at Encryptid so many people complain about not being able to complete it.A  
---
The only reason people do it is for fixer plan, what do we do project paradise for?
---
Level 24.  He was determined to make it work.
---
wait, are you level 8 in game? or legendary run? if you're super low rank in game, then yeah i understand if it's overwhelming.
---
Hahahahaha!
---
I have all rifleman perks, tank killer equipped, hardened receiver.... shouldn’t the base damage be higher than 91?
---
That was the first MMO I ever played...Never really was a huge Star Wars fan though. I mean the movies are good I’ve seen them but I’m no diehard. But yes that game was awesome
---
Having spent seven years playing WoW from 2004 - 2011, no one used 'toon' as a replacement for 'alt'.
---
They mean two completely different things.
---
I miss the og bottles
---
The Excavator PA is supposed to be used for mining right? Which means it's supposed to have lots of weight moving capabilities. So it should be able to carry 400, 500+ our original weight limit. 2x/3x our max
---
No sadly im level 71 in game and level 8 in the leg run
---
I have that equipped but I think you are correct that it doesn’t show up in the base damage
---
All my photos from beta got deleted by the game unfortunately. Nice pics !
---
i'm on ps4. i pressed O to cancel the trade. it could be that my internet connect was lagging and the player put in that item to trade for free, and i didnt see it when i canceled the trade... i remember seeing the cash register emote icon at first from the player, as if... oh well, if the player had a problem he could have sent me a message on psn i guess
---
I don't know when people have all the cards.   If you're happy with what you've got now, don't do anything.   Just save everything until those legendary cards are released.  That way, you'll have flexibility if Bethesda throws some wrinkle into the mix.   Nothing's truly fixed in stone on these things yet.
---
I've got about three packs saved.   There are a couple cards I would really like to have, but I'm holding off until the Legendary Cards are released.   It's not that far off.   I'd be irked to discover I'd messed up my chance to get another level of What Rads.
---
They both do. This is my go-to lite cap sink to hit 500 and sell another serum. Many players don't know the plan so they consistently sell in my vendor.
---
No score is like a new currency ish, you earn score to progress through the legendary run, you can do dailies to earn 250 score, weeklies for 1000 and there’s a repeatable for 100 score for every 10000xp you earn
---
you get the atoms for the steam subscribtion but the atoms from the bethesda subscription wont transfer. i suggest buying stuff on the atomstore on bethesda and then just continuing playing on steam
---
Auto receiver works with commando, hardened receiver is the best for rifleman. Also try Bloody mess, and after patch 21 Adrenaline should be fixed.
---
Automatic has higher damage per second, but less per shot. Also an auto receiver wants Commando perk cards, not rifleman.
---
You start with one point each so that 7 points
---
Commando is nice with the Fixer, it's got a low vats cost and you'll be getting many sneak and crit multipliers if you set your cards right in agility and luck. It's important to be sneaky with a base Fixer, but it's plenty powerful when you are.
---
Try website nukacrypt.con
---
I would love a keyring
---
\*Laughs in Emergency Protocols\*
---
One "toon" imp, the rest Reb. My favorite was my crafter, I ground Mustafaar for the rare plans, made millions, and had my own firespray!
---
I drop all misc and holo items, along with every note that isn't a plan or has a silly name
---
My friends and I do events, flux and legendary nuke runs, dailies, and camp building together. 
---
It was a bit difficult doing the Wastelanders questlines together since you can't complete a lot of the sections at the same time, but we went through them the first time just switching back and forth between team leaders.
---
Jokes on you, I used to own a Zero accuracy TSE combat shotgun.  I sold it to a collector for a crazy guy mask to complete my collection.  
---
You could shoot that thing and hit something behind you.  I obviously had no perks to help it at all, but still.  ZERO.  It was a nice conversation piece though.
---
But back to the gauss shotty.  I see a lot of them when I see shotgun builds, so people are getting them to work.  It could just be that 2shot is having it's way with the reduced accuracy.  Otherwise, vats would be my only guess, cause lord knows the bloodies have plenty of that with all the ap and hit chance of unyielding.
---
Grahm has them
---
Yeah. The whole party no longer auto flags when a member is attacked. 
---
They did it to prevent “griefing” as if it was some widespread, rampant issue (I’ve played for 315 hours and never seen it occur). 
---
But it makes the organic PvP exponentially shittier.
---
Did Bethesda email your friend? Or did they just try logging in and where suddenly able to?
---
 You start with one special point on each special at level one.  So at level one you have 7 special points.
---
 Every level after that you get 1 point
---
oh ok. then you should be good. just join groups for that xp bonus, the weeklies this week were super easy, and stay on the dailies. i finally broke down today and made a new character to level up in game and to level up in nw. super cheesy way to do that. but literally walk a new character to wayward, kill a couple enemies on the way and you'll level up, and one match in nw if you survive the first couple storms you'll level up. that's now gonna be how complete those dailies from now on.
---
Wow. I'm a little jealous of the clarity and resolution you can get on PC.
---
I never got one, but came across to 5 unyielding pieces looking for it
---
Ok and how does that explain anything?
---
Duping is bad. It devalues actual players time. I have literally every single weapon and armor set I could ever want across three toons. I have obtained it all by trading (duping fucks the market up) and by grinding and hard work. Duping is basically everyone spitting in my face, saying I'm a loser for doing it the legitimate way. Fuck that. 
---
PvP exists in, and was advertised as being a part of this game, and whether you like to participate or not, there are those like myself who do. In adventure mode because of the freedom and open world. I didn't buy Fallout for a Battle Royale. Duping ruins this aspect as well because everyone has top meta gear and unlimited consumables. 
---
Tldr: Duping is bad and negatively impacts multiple faucets of this game.
---
Just offer faction rewards for the events. Distant thunder probably needs a second or third spawn to artillery.   
---
For all 3 events they should spawn other types of scorched creatures too.
---
As much as i dislike this mode and only play it for score i wouldnt want this (but secretly do) because it would hide what type of atmor we are currently wearing.
---
"New here"... thats rich.
---
 Legendary gear makes for shitty PVP.  That is the reason survival failed.
---
Yeah what everybody else that commented to this said. My main is a shotgunner, over 340 levels with em... Didn’t add blocker until 250 probably. It’s fucking amazingly helpful. For me especially because I got to be in their face, but for the charging fatties as well
---
Killing bugs and molerats is hard when you can use vats effectively.  Explosive fixes that.  It also procs one gun army, crippling just about everything you shoot twice as fast.  Great for team play and exp sharing.  If it's a ballistic heavy weapon, they break so slowly that the explosive effect isn't much of a detriment on the durability.  And I think some explosive miniguns are bugged too, and can melt the tankiest of enemies.
---
I love doing this as well, I use my 105mm ProSnap Deluxe Camera to take pictures of neat things
---
Every time I’ve done radiation rumble the first thing I do is collect the ore. I could care less about the xp. If I need xp I just server hop at white springs. Real easy.
---
Bring all of your best weapons, at least one melee, tons of ammo, stimpacks, food and water. Wear power armor. Expect to spend at least an hour in there. And bring a friend if possible
---
I like the camera. I just wish I could do the same kind of filters and modifications that you can do with photo mode on them.
---
PvP is in the game. It is part of it, and being "garbage" is an opinion. 
---
What you compare makes no sense, because a woman doing such, is doing so withing legal means, and completely legit. A man can get on a cam and jerk off to make money too. So let's not be sexist. 
---
Just as in "real life" video games have laws written in the TOS. Dupers are lawbreakers akin to real life, and deserve the law to come down on them.
---
The game deems what is fair. And duping is not intended by the game.
---
It definitely happened.
---
Ok so before we have this agruement please show me proof that there is a legendary armor gear combe from that period that was unbeatable. while you do that I'll pull the 400 plus post about people whining while they are farming exp on survival.
---
True indeed
---
It literally took me 40 tries to get a Junkie's (J1015R), and 8 of those were Assassin's. Ughhhhh
---
I was saying if you have 32 special points then you did not miss out on getting a special point.
---
I've never stuck around on the respawn screen more than a couple of minutes, this really works? I always get so frustrated when it happens. Fortunately the last time it happened, I was able to close app and join my team again AND loot the imposter squatch after rejoining the session.
---
I'm just a returning newbie that hasn't played since release in 2018.
---
I got to level 12, I think, then just let the game lie fallow.
---
The bug to hit up the Fallout universe got a hold of me so I jumped back in about 10 days ago and it's interesting relearning it all.
---
Now I just got to level 31 and have much more to figure out.
---
Such as, why is Grant's Saber a level 1 sword that only does 15 damage yet it's located in an area with level 62 mobs? It was a hairy, stealthy trek getting in there.
---
Attempting to decapitate enemies when I have no melee modifiers for this quest line is a real pain.
---
But I digress!
---
Still, encumbrance and all, it's been fun returning to the Wasteland.
---
That’s awesome. My pistoleer was my favorite. That game had an awesome community as well. I was all reb, but my brother did have an imp spy
---
I just made some level 1 leather armor, costs nothing rare, and slapped the cheapest +resistance mod and misc mod on it I could for 3 pieces, just cost me mostly leather and steel.
---
I'm not reading into anything. I plainly read your post, and used my knowledge of the English language to derive its meaning.
---
Bethesda acknowledged it and there working on a fix . Until then enjoy missing 95% vats hits constantly !
---
Ok but why am i still not getting special points?
---
Those are really nice, thx for sharing :)
---
Only wish XBOX could hold more than 10 at a time smfh...
---
Same I never picked it up either lol. Just know some games it’s good to have em and others it’s bad :p
---
Simply stated, via math, which teams are objectively best for XP gain and YOU wanted to refute that. Said nothing about whether YOU SHOULD do anything. Play the game however you like and I'll do the same.
---
In the meantime, it would be nice if they made Ultracite 2mm lighter. Eesh.
---
So you don't have 32 special points?
---
Low levels are the best.
---
I've, sort of, adopted a level 12. Logs on every day, does some quests on their own (no idea what gender, we both don't use mics) for about an hour and then comes to my camp and follows me around or wants me to go to a specific spot on the map for the next 30 minutes. I guess they can only play 90 minutes a day. 
---
Thanks to the group thing, you see their custom destinations, so I make it a point to go there and help with whatever the goal is.
---
They're now level 23 and the only thing they ever agreed on taking as a gift was a modded out level 20 Fixer and some ammo. 
---
Everything else, with the exception of my backup, remains untouched on the floor. I really like how some low levels just want you as bodyguard. :)
---
Of course, there are some bad apples, which I assume to be either spoiled brats or, more likely, toons, who get so greedy you don't need a mic to understand that they want your entire inventory. Last who did that got lured into the Bog and left at FSP while a SB emerged and started screeching. :)
---
33% Vats on a minigun is quite useless
---
Someone uses cannibal perk I see.
---
I never said it didn’t. I implied that it was never this widespread issue that needed to be addressed.
---
Hold up ill count
---
Jeez. That's messed up, it looked like it happened to you multiple times in the same session. Maybe that server was toast.
---
I'll do that and you carry on with your self-righteous high horse mentality 👌
---
I didn't to be honest, I've got lone wanderer maxed and go solo. My wife needs help sometimes and so I have to be able to drop out and help her. Now, that we have that out of the way, what is V9 or Delta? I dropped it right on top of Prime.
---
It sucks for sure, I had to redo one camp 17 times to get it near perfect. Never build into a sidewalk or cement/brick embankment it seems.   
---
As the other person stated sometimes you can build out from the offenders and take them up and all the others pop right up. BUT that is only if you are not into a sidewalk/curb. I dread moving my camp but I am going to to do it since I found a sweet spot with a nice prefab building and cars for my diner/gas station.
---
I don't know, angle perhaps?
---
Damn right they would.
---
It's a step in the right direction. Very few people used teams woth strangers at all before because of that, now everyone is on a team.
---
There are more things that should be done and options to implement to help people who want to PvP between willing participants, such as PvP teams and the use of Pacifist option to see who gets flagged for PvP instead of not flagging anyone else, and there have been many such suggestions bith here and in the PTS forums, but this change shouldn't be rolled back. The diffidence would kill the Public Team system.
---
The acid damage is worthless because bethesda cant work out what pc modders worked out months ago
---
Seriously PC modders had a fix for the the lag that stacking acid caused, but a team of game devs couldnt
---
So they just decided to nerf it into the ground
---
Yeah when I go into the burrows them MFs be running at Mach 10 speed compared to the rest of the ghouls in the world🤣
---
I always have my Excavator PA with me.
---
Yep. It's been talked about on here for a couple days now.
---
Oh I thought this was going to be a scrochbeast appreciation thread, bush wookie until the beast see who it is attacking kill win the game.
---
Well you still would have shown  up in a pink suit, the paint you were hoping for wouldn’t have shown up until you got armor anyway
---
Ah well, 6 levels only relying on RA Diluted and avoiding Decon Arches seems doable during a double XP weekend. :)
---
Funny thing is.. I've put down more settlers for insulting me than raiders, that feels REALLY backwards to me. Its weird (and kinda funny) that the raiders for the most part are the NICE ones, and the foundation people are mostly jackasses.
---
I’ve asked him to get the email from his friend or to post here.  People need to know Bethesda is doing stuff if they really are, and not sitting on their asses.
---
It’s a nice hobby :D
---
Thanks man
---
Thank you very much!
---
There are a few vendors that sell some of the more premium items. Secret service armor, gauss shotgun, farmable roof tiles are some of the more popular ones
---
Thanks man!
---
Awesome pics
---
I never said anything was unbeatable. I was just stating nobody wanted to play with a bunch of overpowered over geared PvP players.
---
 I played survival a few times and every single time it was the same 4 people either killing everybody else or each other over and over again. 
---
 People who weren't lucky enough to get the good drops stood no chance in PVP.  Who in their right mind would want to play a mode like that, other than the overgeared people?
---
 PvP works far better when everybody is on the same level gear wise.
---
Don't be sorry, we're in this Wasteland together!
---
Once you're finished the Wastelanders quests you can use it to buy items, from a few places, that are not available to acquire anywhere else in the game!
---
Yeah same. NV style.
---
I have 34
---
Buying plans that were just added to the game.  Some of them let you craft your own legendary items but some are just things for your camp, grenades, power armor, backpack mods etc.
---
There sure is but this MF didn´t show himself even after he hit us. Is there something in-game that makes you permanently invisible while killing several players with hand combat?
---
This dude cheated for sure but I do understand People questioning me since I´ve not written a full page essay on why I really thought it was cheating.
---
look at the Fallout 4 section of the [wiki](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) a lot of it has been transferred over and tweaked a little bit from fallout 4, just like how luck works with the perfectly preserved pie
---
I’m in total agreement with you. The general move seems to be to make “tough” enemies just super bullet sponges or with a little attack gimmick rather than requiring strategy. Only real exception is the Imposter Sheepsquatch, which I love. I wish only a certain amount of damage could be done to SBQ and then you get a wave of enemies, then next damage phase, next wave, and then last phase of attack. Like don’t let her land at all for the first phase followed by humanoid scorched, have her attack as currently normal for phase two followed by scorched creatures, and then keep her ground-bound in a lunge frenzy confined to right next to fissure site prime at the end with maybe 2-3 other scorchbeasts sonic blasting and crop dusting overhead. On one hand, more difficulty in play. On the other, (assuming a rebuffing of explosives) a couple real opportunities to rock mini-nukes and make a difference. Make enemy loot event-wide and it would make healing a viable contribution, with hopefully keeping the event in the nuke zone and it may take care of the potential event camping.
---
If they carried out a hitbox resistance rebalancing of some enemies, like how Mirelurks have much higher damage resistance across their carapaces than their faces and legs, things like Sheepsquatches could be made less spongy on the belly and Deathclaws much tougher on their heads and backs to make combat more interesting instead of relying on buffing/nerfing weapons excessively.
---
Pretty great, and I thought my photos were cool :)
---
Fridays are my Mondays
---
Hope more people sees it so it won´t happen to them.
---
Yup, this is almost the exact set I use. I use daddyo instead of daytripper however.
---
In a game where npc's respawn and you can kill them with no faction hits? Everything dies. Any raider or settler I see out there I usually kill em, for the exp and loot, as they'll just respawn anyway. Raiders though early game its for the chance of getting handmade guns.
---
This season has all armors in ghillie version. If you want to stay hidden and protected you only need to get far enough in the Season to get the Marine Ghillie paint, then go into NW and search containers for armor.
---
Oh shit really? I had no idea... thanks for sharing This. I actually think I did this exact thing in a queen fight a couple days ago
---
Very cool, those look great! I love the deterioration on them!
---
Thanks!!
---
Personally I like that the strangler vines and leaves show through the paints, you can make some unique combinations.
---
Strangler hellfire is very unique and looks awesome.
---
Thanks a lot! 
---
Funny actually, I had to make them look used or else the paper print on the caps would have been to visible. 
---
It’s a win win lol
---
I love how the words shaped as a cascade spell "cascade".
---
Great camp build c:
---
I’ve been on there a couple times :)
---
So you don't actually need the code fragment pieces to set a nuke off? you can just look up the code and toss a bomb somewhere?
---
Bloody Mess as well.
---
yes, for most of my characters it's there on a plate, I'm not really sure when it starts spawning or why.
---
My biggest pet peeve is how no one keeps the scavengers alive even though they're up top shooting. I know from my own experience, at least in the servers I've been on, its me and like 2 other dudes actually keeping them at bay besides tapping them and going for legendaries. My dad is always the runner for the most part and a couple others from our team do as well to make sure we get the full reward. I even run if need be, but I'm just a better shot. it's not hard people just don't want to do it I guess.
---
Wonder if there will ever be a yearly mothman festival in game?
---
It was pretty widespread in my experience.
---
So are you level 28 now?
---
They're called congress men and they help run the US.
---
Not just the big areas, but little tiny out-of-the way areas, too. I'm born and raised in California, but my father was in the Navy so we did spend some time in WV when he was stationed at Sugar Grove. The in-game location is nothing like it. However, Hillfolk Hot Dogs is based on the real-world [HillBilly Hot Dogs](https://www.hillbillyhotdogs.com/). If you like this sort of thing, the podcast series Vault Boys WV does a good job of comparing FO76 to the real world.
---
Dang, I come here every day and this is the first I've heard of it.  Thanks OP.
---
I just swapped mods on a single piece of armor back and forth. I was surprised it worked.
---
I wonder who they'll need us to pillage and kill.
---
Took me like a month to grind out the gold to get it, just to be disappointed with it, couldn't find any info on it beside apparently old information, I'm currently buying all the raiders stuff, so I guess once I have it all I'll test everything out a post a review on it so no1 else can have buyers remorse. If you haven't tried the dynamite yet it's a waste threw it at a ghouls for 2 times no damage the 3rd did about 75% damage 4th no damage again, and 5th finished it off. However the dynamite bundle seems to be a bit more effective so far did about 80% damage but atleast it actually hit the thing it was by
---
This guy gets it, the government watches everyone pretty much any chance they can, and the internet is a beautiful tool to make this even easier for them to do.
---
Alt + F4
---
Shouldn’t have read this while eating food🤣
---
Indeed. I downvote everyone I see
---
Why’d this get removed lol
---
I keep eyeing up 3D Printers... It's hard to resist...
---
Then you did not miss any special points.
---
Once you pick a special point after you level up you Don't have to take a perk of the same special point.
---
 Example: You can pick one point in strength and still pick a luck perk card
---
Lmao 😅
---
lol. do the same until double xp is over. It is very simple.
---
I love this location, and introduce it to lower level folks just looking for their second camp spot as I ‘port them around the map to check out spots that will be helpful to them.
---
I don’t think there’s an easy way to tell, when you get close to level 100 it seems to be about 5k per level which without double XP takes hours and hours for each level even with high finishes. It gets brutal.
---
I'll add Gun Fu, Tenderizer and the perforating magazine.  May not show up in weapon stats, but it will increase your damage output.
---
That’s how they find me...It’s only happened A couple times that I’ve been ticked off while in a bush. But I figured it was from using a terminal
---
I agree on the when everyone was on the same level part. But at that time the gear was abundant enough that people could piece together PvP sets they just didnt want to or feel like they should, which is fine. But when those same people start purposely exposed  themselves to the stuff they complained about who is at fault. No one forced people onto those servers to fight pvpers on survival
---
Uhhhhhhhhhhh.... ok...?
---
I got my strangler heart from the raids
---
It used to be amazing, you learnt how many bullets to put into something, and the acid would finish it off
---
I haven't wasted bullion on any explosives, i bought the gauss shotgun and minigun. Then bought the secret service armour and mods
---
Now ive got 3k bullion saved in case something good comes along, and slowly working my way through t-65
---
Lots of people are listing the items, but not where you can spend it:
---
Regs in Vault 79, Samuel at Foundation, and Mortimer in the Crater Core will all sell you plans that you can buy with bullion. 
---
For Samuel and Mortimer, the items they offer depends on your ally level  with the settlement
---
Those armor skins are not usable in NW. There is no option to favorite them.
---
With the inclusion of the cultists, I surely hope so!
---
"Dear Google, how do I do nuclear war for non crime reasons"
---
There's an emote in ESO where your character pulls out a bird and flips it in the palm of their hand. It's delightful.
---
I stroke it's balls every day before leaving Camp. It's my lucky charm.
---
Bloody mess and adrenaline don’t show up under the base damage though right?
---
Amen to that!
---
Oh yes i understand you!
---
Lol my post was removed. What a bummer
---
I don't own the camp object, but I usually see these things floating with the stair entrance at the end of a floor piece in a doorway.
---
Haha, thank you!
---
Haha hairbrush
---
You have some great screen captures.
---
Basically all I was saying as you may have picked the wrong special point and then picked a luck perk card. You may have thought because you picked a luck perk card you would have automatically had to have picked a luck special point.
---
 Which obviously you didn't because you have the right amount of special points for your level.
---
Serious.
---
Lol lvl 40 try lvl 8 as someone with a job and family I only get to play a night or 2 week.
---
Does anyone’s basic level 50 fixer show over level 100 base damage with just mods and either rifleman or commando perk cards equipped?
---
I mean, I'm sure that's how Bethesda imagined it too. But they're 2mm. That's really f*cking small. I would think they would lose all energy as they leave the barrel at that size. Although, I'm no scientist, so what would I know. 🤷‍♂️
---
But I'm sneak they cant see me oh fu..........
---
damn good work, sir.
---
Hmmmmmmmm ok ill try to level up again and ill report back.
---
Bloodied 40%Swing speed combat knife is what I'm looking for
---
The following things take up more budget than most people expect:
---
* Defenses (Turrets of any sort)
---
* Crops
---
* Water
---
* Lights
---
* Displays
---
* Walls, Floors, Ceilings
---
But there is more to it as well. Most people build large scale. Look at OP's image. That house he built? It's 3x3, and probably 1x3 of that is taken up by stairwells. It takes a lot less stuff to make a 2x3 feel lived in than some 5x5 palatial monster.
---
Guessing by the few images we have, it kinda looks like they're light on the lighting and power lines. Power connectors are not too bad, but they add up quickly, same with letters of any sort.
---
Finally, the premade buildings add a lot of style for remarkably low budget. I regularly make places like this without any real problem.
---
How you use a space matters just as much as what you cram into it.
---
Totally agree! That's awesome that you take newer players on tours of potential camp sites!
---
Looks great! Good job! Curious, how long did it take you build?
---
Haven't reached 100 on nuclear winter yet
---
Some grump probably reported it and it was autoremoved by the bots, honestly don't worry about it captain.
---
Like... Just wanna print Xenomorphs. Or cool life hacks for the house.
---
Too bad you cannot eat downed players anymore :(
---
Me, I put it on a chair and moved that chair to a bar to make it look like it was running the bar.
---
Thank you. I really do, tho I’m in no rush to experience that grind again lol
---
The ammo machine is great even if your using ultracite ammo u just set it on 5mm or 5.56 and just let it craft and add the ammo to ur shop it makes more 5mm before being full and people usually buy it all
---
I shared this with 2 discord channels I'm in
---
They really are bitter about the atomic baldness...
---
It’s on the Bethesda website, I think it’s coming up pretty soon actually
---
You could do that?!?!
---
Yeah I still have to ally foundation but I’m gonna take a month or 12 off before I even get the energy to start that grind again haha
---
&gt;go ham
---
What makes this even better, is that human flesh reportedly tastes most similar to pork.
---
In terms of the gauss minigun, SD does not work on legendary crafted items; which includes secret service armor, gauss weapons with plans acquired from gold bullion, etc. 
---
SD does indeed work when crafting non legendary armor and weapons. It has been stated in patch notes before, but updating the perk card to mention legendary items are exempt would be kind of nice to avoid any misconceptions.
---
We are running only 2 or so at a time to keep this from happening :(
---
I’m carrying a lot right now. I’m gridding events so I carry everything I need for all the events that I grind. Handmade, lever action, shovel, shepherds crook, guess rifle, camera, gamma gun for PVP.
---
Oh yeah i forgot i bought that and the farmable tiles 🤦‍♀️
---
It’s not ham. It’s delicious long pig. 
---
Sharing the perk card in a team and converting your wasteland friends to the ways of Lecter is sublime. 
---
A sweet sweet nocturn and a chilled tick blood sencerre. FFFTFTFTFTFFFT.
---
cannibal niggas be like
---
This is brilliant, may have to try this on my next build.
---
Do you mean at the top of stairs on a second floor piece?
---
If you haven’t already and find the chance, spend a day in No Man’s Sky photo mode.
---
Oh cool, I reached level 40 yesterday.
---
One day ahead!
---
These are so cool! I love the one with Daguerre. I like to take photos of glitches that happen so my camera roll is full of ghouls with their head inverted and one of a gulper phased inside a tent at Dolly Sods lol
---
Thank you! It took a couple days honestly. I had to break it down and replace my CAMP unit a few times deep into the build when I couldn't remove or replace certain bits due to the crazy random restrictions that sometimes pop up.
---
Also worth note, that sheet is only accounting for the base dailys and weeklys if I recall. it ignores the score for XP gain (which you'll get through gameplay) and ignores the increased number of dailies they added for catchup. I could be wrong, of course, but fairly sure that is the case. I know even my wife, who does no extra grinding and missed a full day at one point, is above the expectation mark.
---
I highly recommend you check one of the "bonus XP" threads on food buffs and the like and consume them before you play, to ensure you get more SCORE from XP gain. It's also worth note that XP is based on level of foe killed and Int level, so higher level characters will have an easier time earning that spare Score.
---
I appreciate it!
---
Thanks! :D
---
yeah daytripper is like -1c and -1L I think so it's really minor
---
What do they mean then? I have also played for 7 years, we hit #31 world/13 west in MoP :p. But I started mid-2011, so we played at entirely different times. Anyway, I rarely ever heard alt, and when I did, both words were referring to a non-main character, same account, generally played for fun.
---
Umm excuse me? Care to elaborate?
---
Agreed... but why does it trigger if it’s not in the pool? Other than Bethesda not being thorough, that is...
---
Probably yeah...
---
But that would be crazy cool! I can only imagine how many things I would do with a 3D printer if I had one.
---
They are that stinkin' you get a disease without touching them! (*That's what she said* before someone chips in).
---
it is the best scenario to farm xp. More players leech off events more xp  I get.
---
Wanted to get everything in the raider before I did the settler stuff but that's one that I'm highly looking forward to, and my 2nd character I'm working on the secret service armor, but the strangler armor in it's current state is just trash I'm starting to think I should just throw on t51 or t60 till I can get the t66
---
Radiation Rumble. I have a fully buffed Bllodied build character. With Cran Relish and Well rested, and an Int of 40, I gained an entire SCORE level and a half just doing that event and getting my hits in on the ghouls. It is an insane XP run. I note that the event failed (three stealth snipers are tough to finish the event and handle the mobs :) )
---
Alas, I still need to pick that game up. Been too focused on FO76.
---
I think you misunderstood. It's that I can't be arsed to switch.
---
500 rounds with my minigun and they're still at 3/4's health.
---
" I just don’t think it’s sensible for me as an adult to spend $180 on lunchboxes with crap rewards. " Then don't. This post makes no sense.
---
Handmade 556. Fixer for 45. Honestly if you get some good legendary effects on them that's all you will ever need. I do suggest a heavy gun for the queen fight though. Less reloading when she's on the ground to get you damage in so you can loot her
---
I'm not sure what you mean, but I usually see them at the edge of a floor piece with the bungalow floating. Maybe the stair on the bungalow allows it to place whereas the rest of the structure doesn't? I don't own the object so you will have to mess around with it yourself.
---
Mostly we search for bugs and do funny things with broken game mechanics or grinding and do the 2 before.
---
On what do you play
---
A good critique needs an opposing opinion. In your opinion where/how can I improve?
---
he is partially right, but bethesda isnt banning people for just having legacy weapons, they just recently had a banwave of people having duped items. but legacy weapons are known to be duped a lot, so you might have a legit legacy weapon or a duped one, depends on where you got it from tbh
---
Where do you get the fixer from? I've only ever had a level 30 one that someone dropped me
---
I thought mine were good.. these are just incredible! I love the Nuka-Cola skeleton shot!
---
You get a prompt that defaults to "Don't drop" if you click to drop a painted or otherwise destroy-able item.
---
Ah okay, I think I passed on that one as it lowered my charisma too much where I couldn't share lv 3 perks. I'm a heavy gunner so str and agi don't matter as much.
---
Aw man what a good picture. I got a few but either explosions or a massive tree were taking up most of his glory
---
I've wondered the same thing myself, but Bethesda gonna do what Bethesda wanna do. SD has been that way since the ability to craft legendary items has been around, seems like they have no intention of fixing it. Idk what I would do with 2 identical, non tradeable items anyway. Free scrip!
---
If you're not interested in the lackluster rewards, don't do the grind. Don't spend real $ either. Problem solved.
---
You can revive anyone, they don’t need to be a friend. Go to a high level event or follow a low level player around. Someone is bound to get downed.
---
You running lifegiver for the extra hp? It doesn't work super great on bloodied builds but sometimes that extra 10 or so life [assuming you're around 20%max hp] can be the difference between being one shot or two shot.
---
Thank you, I got hold of some egg head serums earlier today, that mixed with a building team and farming West Tek I managed to get from 37 to 41 today. I heard about food buffs but I haven't checked yet. thanks for the info. I seriously don't know how I've lasted so long in the wasteland without reddit
---
Junkies builds are fun imo. Any viable power armor like ultracite, xo1, t51 or t65 give loads of rads resistance so you'll hardly need to pop radaway
---
I hope you gunned them all down. I hate those damn clowns trying to ruin the "PvP" mode. And they say "Go PlAy NuClEaR WiNtEr" when we try to PvP adventure mode. 
---
Why play a game mode where you're just hunting for cattle? I'd play sheep herder deluxe if I wanted to chase livestock. Put up a fight for fuck sake.
---
That's why I have a blueprinted "sound weapon" that I place all around them and trap them with, giving away their stupid position if they are on my team. It is a generator with powered speakers on top and wired to it, it goes "ehhhhhhhhhhhhh!" Nonstop and will wake babies sleeping.
---
Local vault dwellers complains his low hp builds dies too fast, more at noon
---
You know there's a whole mode for pvp right?
---
So you don’t plan to earn ANY score over the next 7 weeks?
---
I won’t be. 
---
I apologise if my post confused you I was just saying how I felt and wanted to create a space for discussion. I’m genuinely interested to see if there are others in the same boat as me and what everyone’s thoughts were about the Legendary Run.
---
i'm not an A-hole.  A-holes bitch on reddit because others arent playing this game like how he wants to.  bossy much?  i never grief others, i do what i gotta do and never hurt people around me.  im also one of the guys who will never intentionally 1 shot a legend in an event, i shot once and wave people over.  if i see jerks in an event, i simply leave.
---
Would u settle for the option of having the vines show threw or not
---
Just an FYI. RadAway: Diluted has a chance to remove mutations.
---
If they want to be completely safe, their best bet would be to milk brahmin.
---
Oh you mean livestock hunter? Or bush searcher? Because the whole "PvP mode" is ruined by either cheaters or pacifist clowns who want to play hide and go anal.
---
Thanks bud. I actually got 200 stimpaks from a v kind player so am happily exploring nod. Tho knowing me they won’t last long lol.
---
Oh no. I understood perfectly. You'd rather fail the event than spend a few seconds putting a stealth suit or hazmat suit on.
---
I like the funky time too. I don’t mind it, really, I just thought I was going crazy there at first.
---
Just the Enclave is watching.
---
Quite a few events I've participated in recently has involved people bashing the legendary whilstvemoting it's over here
---
Then on the other hand a knob always one shots eventually
---
Cola Nut is your friend.
---
I like the thought of being able to buy the reward you want with atoms but they’d have make it so the higher rewards unlock over time so everyone won’t have tier 100 on day 1 or maybe make hard earnable tickets (through challenges) that let you choose what you want to unlock instantly free of charge, the challenges should be available from day 1 or a few days after a new season release, make the tickets only usable during the one season and if you have any of these tickets banked at the end of the season you should be able to exchange them for something preferably atoms. It’s dumb you have to pay 180 especially given the atom shop AND fallout 1st which a lot of people sink ridiculous amounts of money into. It’s just greedy looking at least (if they put the money into fresh future content I wouldn’t be so bothered)
---
Did you kill anything else at the same time? 
---
I get 4k with lover's embrace, brain fungus soup, cranberry relish, inspirational 3 and double xp; nothing else makes it go higher. I popped 3 lunchboxes, a leader bobble head, an intelligence bobble head, berry mentats and an xp magazine to kill super mutants and sentry bots still only gave 4 k.
---
Edit: grammar
---
Hi thanks for great tip re cheap source at high players camps. Will hunt them out )))
---
And did you read the part where I said "I don't want Battle Royale from Fallout?" I'm guessing you didn't.
---
So why should i carry some random.  His gun does even  get pass the armor.  The last guy wasnt even being a distration of a bait pile.  If he would jumped on mic asked me to boost him shit i woulda handed out ammo but they slide over and hide in a corner and tag enemies and get the xp and drops at my expense.  I dragged a lvl 23 around a nuked WS last night letting him tah everything while i tanked all damage and i was more than happy.  But if you hide in a corner i am more than happy to bring the action to you and get some mats to repair my shit.
---
If you wanna play and grind it out then do it.  If you don't then don't.
---
If you want to buy all the way to the end then do it.  If you don't then don't.
---
I mean I know a few people who have duped and they drop the weapons for lvl 10s, which gives players a reason to shoot to lvl 50 and actually continue playing this grind of a game. The game has nothing to do once u do the missions so at least some of them tryna keep player base active. 
---
And u trade weapons so guarantee they duped so who cares, it allows people to have something cool and powerful instead of only one person. 
---
And if pvp is so successful how come the mode they added directly for pvp got deleted a few months after it was out????
---
N book n be n be no bb bb mm m mm mm mm mm mm mm m.? My mm mm.
---
. Me mm mm mm mm mm mm aazmt
---
I had stuff dropped for me but I sold it all to the vendor since I didn't know what scrip was and I was leveling super slowly. Now I'm nearing 40 and I wish I had some of that stuff just to see what it was.
---
Some people accidentally lock the terminal instead of the box
---
I've seen a few locked terminals but not the actual storage box. I used to accidentally do that. Could just be me
---
Thanks. Really good advice. Appreciate it.
---
Meat week’s coming back in like a month lmao
---
Awesome camp. Well done!
---
You can only use one bobble head at a time BTW
---
And no it was a single sentry bot kill..... I also had double xp, 3 lunchboxes, 29 intelligence, leader bobble head, lovers embrace and canned meat stew with carnivore.
---
Hey Jonny I think I did some of this already. I have the small backpack recipe which is 10 weight capacity. PS johnny guitar is one of the greatest films EVER))))
---
Possible solution: Make it so PA doesn't unequip armor or backpacks, just hides them.
---
Keep it bro. That is God tier gronk axe.
---
If you think your tweet puts you in a good light, it doesn’t.
---
Being able to choose would be cool, but considering the vines showing is probably a bug I’m sure you’ll get your wish soon enough.
---
Its mad. You'd have to sand down figurines etc so they looked decent. Buy an expensive one to ensure its good quality output. But... Its sooo cool. Imagine selling on ebay, simple put together models that folk can assemble and paint themselves. Mega!
---
Has anyone see calibrated shocks for ultracite?
---
Your still on about this?
---
Yes. I'd rather leave it to others who are far more concerned than I, about the minute intricacies of a videogame.
---
It's your choice really. Fail or not, other people will do what they want, as can we all.
---
If you shoot something you can loot it.  Are you asking why can’t you loot an enemy you didn’t attack?
---
They could probably print their ToS out and beat a person to death with it.
---
C'est la vie
---
Hey thanks for tips. I haven’t explored workshops much at all yet. Captured maybe one farm but struggled to gain resources and then it disappeared when I changed worlds so the concept is a bit confusing but I’m getting there. 👍👍👍
---
It does look good with the raider x01 style armor you can purchase tho
---
To be honest, for me it depends on the group. If we have enough folks to hold the line, sure. But a lot of times, it's something silly, like three stealth snipers. The ghouls are shockingly tough, so unless one of them is over powers af, it's not going to get done, so I just farm away.
---
Just happened to me for the first time, logged in like 6 hours after reset
---
I think he's asking if he can have an 8 player team for private servers so if he kills something , his team also can loot it
---
You see those "sheepsquatch ate my brother" posters? Interact with one and you'll be sent on a fairly extensive side quest which gives you the fixer along the way
---

This is all I got
---
Plus, with speed demon mutation, you heal when you move. I think you need at least level two though.
---
Oh okay sweet thanks
---
The encrypted event you can get the plan for but it’s a rare drop I only got a lvl 50 one by buying it off someone
---
By the looks of it. No they don't.
---
I like this idea! 
---
My problem is that I don’t have time to grind so giving us the option to do a few challenges and turn them into rewards we actually want seems like such a good solution.
---
Hey Scott I think I was doing exactly the opposite. i have been exploring too much and hoarding and not finishing enough quests. finding a balance now👍👍👍
---
Mine is on the couch \^\^  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/UDrrZKn](https://imgur.com/a/UDrrZKn)
---
Yea, it’ll be a repeat for the others. I agree that it sucks that the quests don’t count for all in one shot
---
Oh sweet, another question, are any of the energy weapons any good in an Automatic build?
---
No clue why a basic feature like staying as a team is broken, or fast traveling either. Smh.
---
Art teams and bug teams are definitely separate, so they can work on both simultaneously if it calls for it.
---
That said, god, I wish they had Power Armor stands.
---
You clearly aren't enjoying the game. Why not try some more pvp orientated? Eve Online or Planetside 2 would be perfect for you. Both are (limited) f2p. Try them out chap, you have nothing to loss!
---
Edit: I did not read your entire post but I got the gist. Please include a TL:DR in future.
---
Hey there. I’m a bush Wookiee, but in Adventure I’ll gladly fight someone else if that’s what they want. It isn’t my fault that you get more experience by just staying alive longer than you do for killing people.
---
Ah ok.

I have 18 of the same keys and other things in the misc tab.  Can't drop any of them.

Hillbilly Hotdogs was slammed with hillbilly’s when my family and I took our 76 vacation. So many hillbilly’s. Smelled like hotdogs.

There is a nicer looking iron staircase as well as the nuka stairs and vault Tec stairs that I know of. Plus the contemporary porch stairs that come with the building kit

😟

I mean it’s not that much much gore just particle effects and the thing you’re eating gets skinnier

I think bloody mess does but not adrenaline I’m pretty sure adrenaline is broken right now

xXDarkNuke111Xx thanks for all those presents and building an ammo machine in my camp!
---
Bush wookie lover go play nuclear winter
---
No it doesn’t hold enough, if you run down the road a little toward Flatwoods there’s a truck with a good container in the back, that’s what I use
---
I've seen someone do that before.
---
Heh, it predates WoW.  It was used early in Everquest and before even that.
---
I just don't think losing out on the damage buff from your heavy gunner perk cards is worth it.

The same thing just happened to me. I can’t advance from here, so I’ll have to try another time.

In Portland Oregon there is an old time restaurant named The Bomber. Great food and tons of nostalgic stuff inside. Even used to have a real bomber at the place.
---
Anywho...they had a contest one time that said text “bomber” to #. My husband and I laughed and said... you know if you did that ever button and gizmo in Washington DC would suddenly go off...even ones they never knew existed. LoL. So I feel that when you look up the codes
---
Super Duper absolutely does work when crafting Legendary SS Armor and Gauss Shotgun.  It has worked for me many times.
---
I know I can’t take much damage, but 1shotted from a ghoul is too much
---
I wish it can be used in power armor :(
---
Feel entitled much? You play the game how you want, other people play the game how they want. Get over it and go back to Fortnite.
---
Oh my godddssssd
---
When I played WoW, and Anarchy Online before that, an alt was any character other than your main.
---
My main was a Druid, my Priest was an alt.
---
'Toon' just meant any character, really.
---
Often people would say "Let me change toons" if they wanted to play a different character.
---
Cheers Ru. I built a new one now and it’s definitely work in progress but I like it lol. Feel free to come say hi. 👍👍👍
---
AFAIK, this isn't accurate. If you are on a private team (I haven't checked public) and you are close enough to your team member you will get a loot drop. You will not get XP unless you tag the target.
---
Well there's the Death From Above, that's when the nuke is launched. This is the quest right before it
---
General consensus is shotguns w limb, 33 vats, or bash. Heavies with high rate of fire (over 200) with junkie, instigating, stalker, medic as primary or ffr, limb, 33 vats as secondary. Armor with blocking increase also makes ALL shotguns magic.
---
Pretty sweet.  I bet some of those could by Bethesda as the loading screen.
---
Throw a scarecrow out there. It’ll scare them away.

Well that's fuckin' dumb

If you were banned tuesday, its only friday. You along with hundreds of others prob got banned, prob sent tickets in, alongside the hundreds of other "tickets for errors/glitches/etc". 
---
Its not unreasonable to think that they just havent got to you yet. Or if you REALLY didnt do anything maybe they want to doublecheck? Idk. Its been 3 days. 
---
At the end of the day, it sucks if you are innocent, but it is to me a random redditor like so many others claiming to be innocent. That is why it wont go very far here. 1, majority of people wont believe you or dont care 2, the official forums are made for this, not reddit. 
---
Hope you get your stuff back if your innocent my dude, i know id be upset, but on the other side 1 less person ruining the game gone is always good.
---
I know right!!!
---
Theyll be a separate bundle to buy
---
Yeah, I mean I don't see the huge need to even include the option to lock the terminal cos people can't even use it to do anything. Probably comes under a normal terminal like the one which controls light boxes but meh. Doesn't hugely matter
---
If having a powerful weapon ready for them is the only thing keeping them playing, then they aren't gonna play long in the first place. And I don't want those type of "instant gratification" scrubs in the Wasteland.
---
If everyone has cool and powerful, nothing is cool and powerful. It's an MMO based around looting, and trade. Everyone isn't meant to have everything. Only children want that.
---
Survival mode failed for numerous reasons. And it was not because of non interest of the players. It was the decision to make predictable spawn points, rewards that encouraged non PvP players to participate, but get slaughtered and complain, the map markers encouraging camping and hiding for "time survived," the blanket damage caps, which gutted 90% of builds other than heavy and commando, and were much stricter in survival as opposed to adventure. Alot of PvP players quit after the nonsense, and the remaining went to adventure to PvP eachother and others, because of the caps being less harsh. It was 110 on adventure and like 90 on survival, I don't remember exactly.
---
Those are the reasons survival got removed. Poorly managed, and an afterthought when adventure was updated.

How in the hell am I being self righteous or on a high horse? 🤣 are you an idiot? You’re the one that’s got aggressive and said there’s no other way to play but your way, I LITERALLY SAID, if you’re playing events all the time then you do you, this is for players that don’t want to do that... just wow man, stop wasting my time

---
If whole team gangs up at events and is doing them efficiently it's bettełlr exp. Getting around 2k-3k per event, some events like defending workshops are Hella good.
---
No its addressed, Bethesda models their game heavily around it obviously.
---
The cards apply to all heavy weapons though, even if the have the explosive legendary effect.  When the perks say "non-explosive," it's just exempting things like the missile launcher/fat man/etc.
---
Delicious glowing flesh! Who needs to carry food lol

Best bet is nuka grape. -400 plus heals 400. No chance to remove mutations. Gotta get to whitesprings though.
---
"Maybe I've selected an event I should've waited for other mid tier players to show up to..." "No... No it's the beginners who are wrong."
---
It's a trophy now, not a game. A social badge.
---
Well, when I am on their team, they are kinda messing up how I want to play a team based mode.
---
My game must be bugged because I get no increase on damage from them. So I scrip every explosive gun
---
I first got the weapons, then the ss armor so I could obtain them from seasonal events and the purveyor. After that I got the underarmor and then the ammo machine. Is all up to you though. I do recommend unlocking the weapons first though.
---
No you commented saying that I was completely wrong, argued against against ap buffs, didn’t listen to anything I said
---
IT IS THE BEST XP GAIN FOR PEOPLE THAT DONT DO EVENTS ALL THE TIME, WHAT DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND ABOUT THAT? 
---
And FYI, you did absolutely no math, you just made a bunch of inarticulate and confusing points
---
The area is just inaccessible, if I’m not mistaken. There are a few areas at WS that are, atm.
---
Nice, I tried uploading some earlier today but I had too many pictures, maybe I'll get back to it and upload all of mine, going to be gone for a bit
---
Water is it's under appreciated second cousin.
---
Wait, you can have more than 50 photos saved?
---
Abomination, also wth how did you make the pic look so good
---
i just pick up cranberries and take the 5% extra from cobbler. dont want to spend too much time farming for boosts
---
Oh the staircase is the worst. I’ve had to rug glitch most anything to sit underneath!
---
That wasn't your complaint or title, they're doing it wrong and I would agree whole heartedly.

Leaving because of the change to PvP isn’t really the subject. Though I’m sure they’re overlap because of wanting god more items.
---
My second attempt at making a plasma caster netted me a b2525 laughed so hard.
---
I'm just down the street in that open parking lot, but yeah that spot you mentioned is popping I see a lot of camps there.
---
Too bad we can’t have another person’s pics between platforms. These are really something else. Great job
---
There’s literally no need for how toxic and negative you’ve been since the start, being passive aggressive, ITS A GAME
---
Oh I'm not questioning your maths. I just like wearinng PA.  Never wore it in Fallout 4. So mentioned this for other PA users.
---
Make sure if you moved your camp you also check for newly created blueprints. You need to destroy them so you can access the individual camp items so you can remove them.
---
Older MMO slang, back at the turn of the century when I was playing EQ toon was slang for character. Also if you had an alt you gave high end gear it was called a "twink"
---
Maybe because it's not there? Kinda hard to read something that's not there, so your guess is as good as mine.
---
I was going to try to get some score when I can but i know realistically that I won’t be able to grind as much as I’d like. It just comes down to the fact that the rewards are not worth the grind that I would need to invest when my time is so limited to begin with. It’s a shame. I literally just want the camp items but it’s okay it is what it is. Was just throwing my opinion out there
---
Personally, the *Withered* variety are the worst. They creep me out and seem to move the fastest.
---
I hear about it every damn time NSA comes up, my sig worked in the same field and building as that little traitor. They get really upset when you accuse people who work in the tunnel of monitoring Americans.
---
To be fair, mine is not the first post on the issue. I would highly encourage you to seek a refund of your Atoms with customer support. Explicitly state that the broken nature of the bundle is the reason for your request. Another comment on here lays out the process very easily! :)
---
Be prepared to fix that puppy often. Do not use the splitter as it breaks your gun 4x as fast, though it is fun as hell shooting pew pews.
---
I cant even imagine the bush deleting and all of them being like👁👄👁
---
I mean we can eat normal food and drinks no problem while in PA... why can't we ear corpses?
---
If they're planning to do that, afk in a bush, it is very easy to choose NOT to fill teams. It is simple.
---
These posts are so stupid.
---
I actually thought it was wiser to have as much junk as you can for emergency purposes lmao
---
I think the desertion you are seeing is partially due to the influx from gamepass diluting the server, and the high level players just knocking out the daily challenges and logging, which takes ~1 hour now, if not less.  I was on a server last night full of 200+ so there are high levels still out there.
---
Sometimes I drop one as a misclick and I don’t bother (or sometimes even notice) to fix it until I’m actively using it again.
---
Then say ten or as many as you can things Bethesda gets right and you really like
---
Ah, turd ghouls. The literally look like shambling poop automatons. Shit golems; there is clearly evil sorcery behind this.
---
I still do this when I run the event. I know it doesn't do anything but it feels cathartic to give them a smack on the rump to try and speed them up.
---
MODUS is going to have a bad day.

Yea, instead of stim'ing them

no.

Did i steal your 3 plastic and 7 lead.  Im sorry bro ill gove it back.

I already said that people shouldn't bush wookie on teams but thanks for your input.

Do we think future DLC?
---
That is very true. I just liked the mental image hehe
---
World is on fire, we’re just fanning the flames.
---
It sounds for me like it does, but when I count, it's the exact number I crafted.
---
I would kill for a veribird to fly me around the map like FO4. I know it’ll never happen but a guy can dream.
---
I was very disappointed  with the Gauss Shotgun in terms of missing target, but also because it is slow to fire/reload etc.  I gave up and went back to my heavy build.  Shortly thereafter I acquired a Bloodied LMG and primed it.  This thing is the boss.  Dropped a super mutant behemoth like a bag of shit in 3 sec.
---
Tbh, if I were to get fo 1st, it'd be for the ranger combat armor. But the scrap box seems like the most important one and it kinda sucks that it's blocked behind a paywall ngl
---
dude, I have a full time job, and I'm already ahead of where the math technically says I'm supposed to be. It's not hard to get somewhere.
---
Lol get rekt by Bethesda ya goof
---
There were also metal stairs with proper railings at some point on the atomic shop, as well as red wooden ones (with metal railings) as part of a red rocket bundle I believe. But yeah, it’s basically just industrial metal or bust  :/
---
It would be great for the Bramin herding. I am happy to herd the animals to the farm and let others kill the bugs and wolves. But sometimes I do not have enough time to successfully get them there and then switch weapons and take a few shots at the Sheepaquach before they die. 
---
Without players herding the animals the other players wouldn’t get diddly. LoL. 
---
I will say, if they do implement this, I can only imagine the grumpy people at One Violent Night when it no longer matters if they 1-shot the windigo or not since everyone who participated would reap the rewards. Lmao
---
I tend to kill anything with the silhouette of a mutant as soon as it is within sight. Took me more than one encounter with this guy to realize what his deal was.
---
It only works if you can't count.
---
Yeah I cant get it to work. Twice I've put an item in storage with unlimited weight and when I rentered private world the item isnt there.
---
Yep, all two shot shotguns have awful accuracy and seem to do way less damage, at least with my testing between two double barrels. One with two shot and one without. The one without when hitting a vats headshot would do like 255 damage per pellet where the two shot would only do thirty fucking six.
---
I do have some weapons in my chest. I should probably sell the ones that aren't related to my build
---
“I have a feeling that it’s only ever used as a noun (e.g., the act of using or doing something)”
---
Thats a verb dumbass. Go back to 1st grade.
---
Your response is perfect. Really. Seriously. You've made it bro. You've done it. You're a high enough level to talk down to players who just started. Be proud, and keep stealing from them. Soon enough, everyone could be as toxic as you. Good job.
---
Welcome to Fallout 76, the biggest combination of "That's fuckin' dumb" and "That's fuckin' awesome!" you'll ever find.
---
Really? I do this all the time
---
If you a duper, you deserve a ban. That's all.
---
Maybe try again.  It's tough since it takes 2 legendary modules!  Do you have it maxed?
---
The Cannibal *Perk*, you mean.  I thought I missed a new location.
---
Please fill us in on the difference between a duplicate and a replica.
---
Oof, this is hard lmao
---
I don't play fallout to fight players. I'm just not fast reactive enough to shoot other players, so I'm not gonna waste my time on it. Move on and deal with it.
---
Do you think I have time to catch up? I haven’t done the math and I just thought it was a lost cause. How many hours are you playing a week?
---
"I ate his liver with some silt beans and a nice nukashine."
---
This is the worst one yet
---
Need a bit more endurance drop one gun army for sure. Adrenaline is broken currently so maybe pick up tenderizer and dump everything else in endurance, more survivability though personally I hate going below 6 in agi for dodgy.   
---
Being completely honest as a heavy gunner you play in hard mode without PA. Stabilized is a very much needed perk for HGs otherwise you can succeed with much easier builds .   
---
Nothing wrong playing in hard mode though just expect to triple your ammo consumption.
---
Wait I think a first aid box works i lost about 150 worth of scrip but that's nothing haha.
---
See, *there’s* the vital piece of information that, if it had been included in the OP, would have made you sound less like an asshole and more like somebody who’s simply annoyed. I’m sorry that people don’t then team fill off. I try my best to every time. But whenever I see that I forgot to do that, I’ll actually play with my team as intended.
---
Gamepass is Xbox only though, no? I’m on PS4. And you’re right, there are plenty of 200+ there, but to me it appears nowhere near what it was before.
---
You know with all these feelings in this sub im starting to miss the dupers.  And thats saying alot for me.
---
So you paid real money for some ,, unobtainable ,, item ? Even it was 99% duped, you made a real money trade. That, stand alone, is a ban / law suit material, mate.
---
&gt;No, it's not. We don't measure power output in millimeters.
---
Yes, we do.  is measured mass moved a distance per unit time.  Horsepower is 550 pounds moved 1 foot in 1 second.
---
trying to out lawyer bethesda....LOL
---
If you're a herbivore, Cranberry Relish gets you 20% bonus xp (25 with Strange in Numbers), and Brain Fungus Soup gets you 4/5 more Int, so about 12/15% exp if I recall. Resting in a bed gets you another 5% xp. Those lunchboxes give 25% XP, to a cap of 75% (I did a queen event and three of us popped lunchboxes, I gained shocking amounts from that). Going over three lunchboxes was bugged and I assume still is.
---
Carnivore, I can't say, I don't use it so I didn't memorize it, but strikes me as much harder to farm up.
---
they buggered the map icons with the last update. it used to clearly show which places where workshops and it told you what of resources the workshop had. For instance grafton steel has a steel extractor you can power up and it produces steel. I think it was like 60 an hour. IDK! i hardly ever go over that way.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Workshop\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Workshop_(Fallout_76))  slightly older list as Spruce knobs is no longer a workshop
---
I should have warned you that workshops are pvp zones. Anyone can stroll up and start fighting you.
---
Guess i'd better sell some mini nukes then lol
---
I don't. Got my eyes opend with fallout 76 and lost every faith in this company.
---
They are just completely incompetent have no clue and shit on their costumers. Fallout 76 was my last Bethesda game for sure
---
I think it’s the same as other in game items in that you have to grab a certain number (150?) and then it resets. I don’t think it’s time based
---
It's also crafted under energy.  It's not technically not energy, it is energy.
---
These comments are so smart and constructive though..
---
Hear hear, brother
---
My friend and I just do the original content together that isnt instanced and when one of us is offline we'll do the wastelander content. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ the repetition of doing instanced quests in a group made it monotonous after a while. It's fun picklocking peoples camps together so we flag for pvp, you should give that a try!
---
On weekdays, maybe 2-3, but I get all the dailies done in about one and a half, and on weekends, anywhere from 4 to 7. (Sometimes the gain a level one takes longer than the 1.5, but I've started skipping it if it does take too long, though only needed to once since I resolved to do that)
---
Now, to be fair, I have no life due to a certain pandemic keeping us all indoors, and you might have things you do outside of work. 
---
Could you catch up? Honestly, no idea. But you could get a few things, and honestly, for me, half the fun is just that I like 'achieving' a thing - it's nice to hear that little SCORE sound for doing stuff I'd already be doing, and the Legendary Run has made me play a lot more events than I'd have bothered to do, same with claiming workshops (i'd never have bothered if not for Legendary run, since it never seemed appealing. Turns out? Kinda fun)
---
EDIT: I should also clarify I ignore the NW one about half the time.
---
You're the one getting butthurt over beginners, *beginners* dude, trying to figure out the game. Good luck on your quest.
---
Jeeze
---
https://youtu.be/gOBYZlq-7ZU  here’s a YouTube video if that helps
---
Not yet though. It's Fallout 76, nothing works fully on launch.
---
Survival of the fittest, as it should be.
---
Thank you for all the tips you gave me. I'll be sure to check my inventory the next time I log in. Thanks guys
---
Yeah they had a huge influx of new players and they need a lot of new PvP quality gear and we'll unfortunatly buying stuff wasn't safe either
---
rofl
---
Rofl!!!!
---
“Why can I feel a breeze..?”
---
Oh nice, I’ll look into upgrading bloody mess some more (I haven’t upgraded it yet). Just need to grind a little more to acquire the cards plus move additional points into Luck.
---
I almost have the raider tree. I’m excited about that.
---
I dont get how one could get so worked up over it though. If someone benefits from my doing i think id be happy. They aren’t taking anything from me. And what more could a lvl 250+ want
---
20 hr cool down period.
---
Nice. I didn't even know that Grape was an option, haven't been lucky enough to find it yet!
---
BuT yOu NeEd tO GaThEr tHe OrE!
---
I run melee so what i do is basically hitting them, and then moving back so that they cant get to u(works 2/3 of the time)
---
No mate. I just started playing yesterday.
---
Character-locked only
---
Anyone know where that aerial "help" is located?
---
True it would eat up build cost but I want it lol
---
Check out the The Whitespring Sentry Bots ;)
---
I like Alcohol, Psycho, Daddy-o, Day Tripper and Mentats. Its like -3 to cha and -1 to the other stats. No perks needed really
---
I swapped the colors back and forth on a piece of forest scout armor, pretty much found it by accident while repairing my gear. ;)
---
atoms :)
---
Wait till you get the revive in water one 😂
---
Are you saying if you maxed out a card you want to drop it from 3 down to 2 with the use of a perk point?
---
That is on top of the Red Rocket Station in Flatwoods.
---
&gt; wanted to experience some of the “Unobtanium” that is basically impossible to acquire at this point in the game other than by using $USD...
---
It wasn’t unobtainable,  you just didn’t want to work to obtain it.
---
I haven't played much with them because other ammo types are easier to find
---
Definitely not the norm, but unfortunately you will run into douchebag keyboard warriors like u/tmo1983 who live in their mommies basement that do this shit so they feel like a real warrior. Since they are bitches in real life, they try to take out their sorry ass feelings on new players.
---
Hmm my inteligence bottoms out in the 40s its generally in the high 50s. I will have to run some more tests. I can try on a public server later tonight when I play maybe that will make a difference.
---
I reeeeeeeeeeally want that chicken coop....
---
When you start saying exploit isn’t a verb you already lost.
---
Soooooo I'm boned?...and need to do the 1 daily quest for the settlers for half an eternity?
---
All the settlers items are locked. Ward is the only daily quest, but you can also do photo opportunity, take pictures at crater, and give them to Ward for a little extra rep. 
---
Also, if you get Retirement Plan as the raider daily, convince the raider to join Foundation.  You'll get a bit extra for that as well.
---
Only if people stop using SS. Wtf.
---
There is no rules on how to play, except just to make it number 1....
---
I dont care what u say, dont care what u do...but unless they change the dynamics of the game, I will be a proud bush wookie for life.
---
Dude is just mad he cant make it as far as bush wookies......rofl
---
I don't know, I feel like we're saying the same thing, just wording it differently lol. To me they are interchangeable and mean the same thing. Anything other than your main raiding character was an alt or a toon, based on how comfortable you were in team speak: the girls would say toon, guys would say alt, generally =p.
---
Is that the blue rad suit that they wear?
---
They removed that? wtf :\\
---
That's only like 5 USD. Ezpz
---
Can confirm I got it to work. It just doesnt work on overseers cache or desks for some reason. Now I can make use of 2xp thank you!
---
Yeah. Decently rare. I've seen people buy them for 10k caps or more before.
---
From what my spouse and I have experienced with private works, there seems to be about around a 15 meter range around the mob killed, where loot is eligible to other team mates. Which isn't *too* bad, unless one of us gets snipe happy.
---
To be honest, what annoys us the most is that it doesn't apply to XP as well. So many times one of us has accidentally gibbed mobs and the other get nothing out of it but some pittance of loot off the corpse. If they're close enough for loot eligibility, why not the XP.
---
Sure it means leechers become a thing. But this is basic in almost every online game for decades. And it's also a private world.
---
That'd be so cool.
---
r/lostredditor
---
I just got mine, had about 20 legendary modules saved up to go for it, got a bunch of garbage, only to find out it's a garbage weapon anyways.
---
It takes skill to be a successful Bush Wookiee
---
Yeah some containers can be a bit dodgy, just park your mule at somewhere you know it works and use the same box every time, enjoy! ☺️
---
So much for transparency...
---
I’ve yet to find a combat with exploding bullets ... I love the combats
---
No, sorry if I confused u, u would drop from 3 to 2 and then u would get ur perk point back
---
Da heck is happening here
---
Can you check you dms with me
---
Everyone is so mean to you... :/ now I'm nowhere near smart or anything I'm basically at a 5th grade level but as someone else said "if you duplicated you deserve to get banned that's it"  I didn't duplicated but I did end up trading some duplicated stuff out so I don't know if I'm eligible to get banned but how I see it is only the people that did the duping deserve to get banned.
---
Server hop worked the last time i tried, i manually left the mine, teleported away, server hop and entered it back and i got like 700 ores ( maybe missed some,i did a speedrun )
---
That makes building a build pointless if you could change it on the whim
---
Agreed! The sharing mechanic for both loot and XP is kind of bewildering considering the standard that's been set by other titles for years.
---
Blocking stat? Do u mean perks or ? 
---
How do I do that ?
---
Last time I was there, I was farming it server hopping. Is it fixed now?
---
I just run automatic and heavy build it does work, frog legs is a must perk tho it’s super helpful
---
Good post.  I’m the same, Miss the odd daily but not stressed about completing.  A few nice c.a.m.p bits and skins.  I don’t use PA and the ghille stuff looks a bit shit. I think it’s great that Bethesda are doing this stuff, kept me logging in each day.
---
Just heavy gun.  But, once configured properly it has excellent range....which is what I meant about a sniper.  Run stabilized as well.   It’s really changed the way I play at the moment.  I enjoy standing back and unleashing hell from a distance.  My favorite part of the game now is thrashing mobs at queen fights from the top of a tent.
---
these are amazing. I have a few I'm rather proud of but these by far outweigh mine! thank you for sharing.
---
I want that firefly glass jar
---
Next frame: OP Loots Paperbag, 30k Violet Flux...
---
To Be Continued...
---
Think my favorite would have to be the fireplace door.  Sure pretty much all of us here know about it, but I can not tell you how many times someone has come to my camp and not realized what it was as they searched for my vendors.  
---
The wallpapers would be a close 2nd though.  They are stunning in the darkness of the Mire.
---
Hi, i just stated that im not gonna protect a random trying to boost off me.  But the insults are welcome!
---
Of the entire thing, all I've been interested in is the clean sink, huge plushie sheepsquach and the fireplace door.
---
Seconded. I think every other BR does that and it feels lacking without that ability.
---
Sweet, I didn’t want to delete the post but I didn’t want it out there anyway thank you. I know you’re a bot
---
Damn...
---
Thanks for the answer ^^
---
And 
---
Thanks Bethesda T.T way to needlessly block access  to items
---
But it makes it easier to switch builds so u don't have to waste so many hours trying to invest in other stats and cards
---
Yaaaaaay....
---
I would like them to run around and distract at least one of the mob.  Not hide in the corner.
---
Everybody felt this
---
I helped them figure it out thou.  Dnt hide in a corner and not help.
---
&gt;the clowns who ruin Nuclear Winter mode by afk hiding in bushes.
---
Why the hell does hiding automatically mean that a player is afk?   The term "AFK" is thrown around here to the point where it is completely meaningless.
---
AFK used to mean "away from keyboard."  These days, it just means "any play style I dislike."
---
There's times when I hide in bushes, but I turn the team fill off if that is going to be my strategy.   Some people don't, but if NW is really that important to you, and you take it so seriously. then you should have been able to form a team of reliable players by now.   You shouldn't be so dependent upon random players to get the job done.   When you team up with random people you have never played with before, and their mic is off, you don't get any say in what their play style is going to be.  That is just how it goes.
---
I often hide but I am never AFK. I find some bushes right next to the storm. I hide in them. When he storm moves, I move.  That is not being AFK and has nothing to do with being AFK.
---
I don't consider myself a bush wookie. I play the mode as intended mostly.  But this is double XP weekend, and I want to get to level 100.   Turning on Aqua boy and hiding at the bottom of Grafton like virtually guarantees 200 XP. If the storm moves in you favor, you can get more.  Going into the match guns blazing like Rambo can win the match, or it can get you killed early in the match which means very little XP.   I am level 82, and this is how I plan to play through the double XP weekend.  When double XP is over I'll probably go back to playing it as intended.
---
HEY BETH!!!!
---
Can we also get a toxic goo pit that i can bred and spawn my own super mutants to kill so I dont have to farm WesTek?  kthxbye!
---
Do the fertilizer Grenades work with wild plants?
---
/r/bento
---
I have only ever encountered it in the grove after nuke.
---
You're just a bunch of New Agers! Get off my lawn! ;)
---
Shhhhh. That's my farming spot. There wont be any left if you tell everyone :p
---
Once yer at higher lvl you have so many perk cards you are fine.
---
I know what he means. However, expecting someone that is new to understand that intricacy of the game is unreasonable and unrealistic.
---
They probably don't read Reddit where people bitch about the way everybody else plays the game
---
Not tryna be a dick but this games pvp was doomed from the start and the duping is never going away either bc Beth games always have tons of bugs
---
M1 would be amazing, especially for rifleman... they have the MG42, so that WW2 era weaponry would make sense
---
epic meme fellow ledditor! May you have many upboats!!! XDD!!!
---
There's one under a power pylon near the mothman museum which is pretty good, nice flat area because it's on a concrete base. I stayed there for a while.
---
You have to change the audio settings to hear people.  Turn up voice and 50% on most of the other settings.
---
It gives improved stealth AND faster movement speed. Should it be considered a 5 star when maxed?
---
They don’t need reports that it happened. That can review the systems and the accounts and see that. 
---
They’re aware of the problem.
---
I know. Which is why im mentioning it.
---
If you want it. Please spread the word.
---
Hard to have a prequel to events that are happening right now or haven't happened yet. 
---
NW is set at a date years ahead of where we are post wastelanders.
---
What happened before and during is well documented in the lore you mentioned.
---
You should make it clear that you don't want them as skins, you want them as separate weapons not just a combat rifle and 10mm pistol skin. Please bethesda we want world war 2 themed weapons please i don't care if i have to grind for them with gold bullion please just make sure to add the iconic *ping* sound  when reloading.
---
I just wanna hear the ping for the reload on the M1 tbh
---
If it makes you feel any better I just moved and haven't been able to have wifi installed because of covid so no internet for the past month. I haven't even been able to play since before the update.
---
Love it!
---
A good amount of people are being more careful with them now that the double xp is going.  When I was grinding out the season it was generally only a matter of asking random players around level 50 if they had any lunchboxes.  If they had them they were always willing to use them either from not knowing what they did or not knowing of the double xp event on the horizon.  
---
Still, I would just audibly ask every so often when around a group of people.  Sometimes people start popping them.
---
But it still applies if u want to transfer points to another stat. And there r many different builds with even more variations. Even at the 300s ur not gonna have everything u might want or need for a build.
---
They had one on new vegas as a rare weapon, so no idea why not on here.
---
I get about 375-400 lead ore each run with excavator
---
Shouldnt that reset it?
---
Reached the giant plush yesterday myself.
---
Was looking ahead again today and realized...
---
What happened to the skeleton camp item? Could have sworn that was a Legendary Run item but can't find it om the board now.
---
How is it acquired now? Rilly need skeletons for my base. And any other Halloween plans I can get ahold of.
---
That’s why you can have multiple characters...not multiple personalities.
---
sounds like you have a magic shotgun check turtles vid on them

The troubleshooters has the "magic" +50% limb damage which causes more damage than intended.
---
i don't have it yet, but i'm eagerly anticipating the Jangles Backpack. though i'd be lying if i said i hadn't wanted a clean sink since day one. also once i realized the Sheepsquatch can actually sit on couches and chairs he jumped very high up on my list :)
---
And here I was doing the casual groups for the luck boost / better drops. Int definitely sounds better in most cases  
---
TIL - awesome
---
i'm going to be so upset if it doesn't come with a little chicken to walk around camp.
---
I thought the magic got patched?
---
You know exactly what I meant. Besides, no, we don't, that's mm combined with other units, not pure mm.
---
Amazing
---
You poor thing! Hope you’re staying safe and well. I think I’d go crazy if I didn’t have internet. What have you been doing in your free time?
---
you've got the fireplace already? that's a lot of grinding my friend.
---
I would love the junk cannon or whatever it was from 4. Thing was a blast , just sayin
---
What other weapons have they added from players asking for them?

What happend to your account?

Ty!

Okay I'll check that out thanks.
---
That'd be great
---
Not at all? He's talking about [this](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Jonah_Ito) NPC.

Yep, I have a level 5 instigating shotgun which did double damage for all the pellets which carried me through the early game

I think each vein counts as 1 but I’m not 100%. You could hit lucky hole; then the nuke silos, fire dept, vault tech university, prison yard and the motel... circle back at that point.  That will net you a lot of lead.

Sneak and the photomode filters
---
My friend is a soldier who enjoys playing fallout and has come back after a long tour because of the pandemic. He owns both of these weapons irl, and in multiple occasions told me he would love to see these guns in fallout 76. And he was real sad when he came back to the game to find that they hadnt come. But he understands the reasons why not but would still love to see them make their appearance.
---
I work full time, so that's helped. But other then that I just watch YouTube on my phone (thankfully I have unlimited data - just not on my hotspot) and my boyfriend has an unreal DVD collection so I've been borrowing about 10 at a time lol. Movie night every night.
---
Main is 300+ it was taking a ton of time and effort to level up. So i created a new character. Joined the character to a Building team (for best results wait for the 4x multiplier) then hitup Flatwoods and did the first mission and got a level up right there. Next day did the next mission set. I found just doing the early missions and keeping this character was easily hitting my level up requirement until around level 6-7 then it got to be a bit more of a grind. So i just deleted it and started another one.
---
I'm on the supersledge! The bleeding in my eyes just works!
---
My session today, I went up seven levels to bring me to 200.  
---
3 nukes in a row, a few Whitesprings, Westeks, and various events.
---
"Funny meat"
---
Maybe I’ll try to go for the crystal as well then and then just drop it. I’ll test that tonight.
---
You can have different stack sizes of the same card. I have gunsmith at 5 for crafting, but also have it at 3 to run with along with other cards.
---
The slug buster in vault 79 it’s starts at semi but you can up grade it
---
A double XP-Score at the same time weekend!
---
Annnnnnd creating a new character just to make a different build would take way longer than just changing your existing characters build so that's kinda pointless
---
would require all new ammo, 30-06...
---
Okay sweet
---
Prepare for imminent disappointment :s
---
Can hit up the can traps too for a nice boost.
---
Yea i know but I thought this was just an idea I'd run along reddit cus it just popped into my head
---
I mean most people aren't really viewing gaming as an addiction.
---
Kinda pointless to be able to change your full character on a whim because it “doesn’t work for you”. Champ up, make another character, and quit whining because this game takes work.
---
Mine was 89862.... Good it's random. Make it fun to try and find it
---
The lighthouse by vault 76. Landview light house.  A few copper figures in the bottom. Then head out past the covered picnic area for some copper veins in the rock.  Definetly ned excavator armor. 
---
An even better place is solomons pond. Head there, walk out the back porch of the main structure and head north. 10 copper veins on the ground and in the cliffs
---
I have 105 perk points just sitting around. Patience and it gets easier (and pointless)
---
Yeah my bad I got mixed up with the names but it's weird that it completed from a teammate for you
---
It says level 25 in the title, not special at 15 points. Honestly, i'd either relog and try again or send a ticket to bethesda and see if they can help in this situation.
---
Wasn't the magic patched out?
---
3 star donkey punch. Go for 40% faster swing, +1 strength
---
True. But it would be fun.
---
https://aridenkane.com/fallout-76-best-copper-vein-locations-for-good-farming/
---
No because its listed as a single effect. Other legendary effects also have multiple effects, such as Weightless (Weighs less and doesnt count for Chameleon mutation) or Explosive (Deal extra damage and deal area damage)
---
Hey if you have a backlog of movies here’s your chance haha 
---
Did someone say Harry Potter movie marathon? :P
---
Yah, Wish I could hotkey Lying Out pose, it's awesome in NW lul
---
How about we can do it for free, it is dumb and frustrating and will even be more so if they don't change how we rank up legendary perks.
---
by just being in the group
---
Would LOVE to see that on the news
---
Wobble baby wobble baby wobble baby wobble
---
I totally forgot about excavator armor for mining! Thankyou!
---
Cool if I "steal" some of these as inspiration? Cool. 10/10
---
You try asking?
---
Nope, sounds like an textbook case of the auto-completion bug. They're still working on a fix for that.
---
Baffled you would want this nerfed lol
---
Go to that ungrateful bastard's camp and explosive bait it to the ground
---
Yeah but if you are clicking shit fast you may hit that too. Did that once before when i was trying to get rid of extra weight and dropped a bloodied plasma caster. Luckily was able to get another one fairly easily
---
but then someone can come along and just shoot you in the back and take it
---
It helps tbh.
---
Im actually currently rewatching all of the fast and furious movies lol. But yeah I literally told him to give me anything he has seen that I should watch and have about 7 movies I've never even heard of lol. Should be an interesting weekend off.
---
what do you get for it, like what is the actual point?
---
Man, this one time I was in a forested area in the dark casting everything in silhouettes. I snuck up on a super mutant and quickly dispatched him with a 1 shot. Then noticed a second super mutant in the distance. 
---
So decided to sneak up on him too, then all of a sudden as I'm like half way to him this thing barrels down on me at mach 9 scaring the sheet out of me!
---
I was all like WTH super mutants can't run like that. Then at the end realized it was a charred ghoul as it one shots me.
---
Is very surprising at how this game can jump scare me at the most random of moments.
---
Especially hate when super mutant hounds leap out of my razor grain unexpectedly right at my face.
---
Like WTH make some  noise yo!
---
Once you get a better feel for what you need it's actually quite easy. I must have 200-300 plans, 6-8 stored weapons for a rainy day, a hundred serums, 10 or so outfits, 4 suits of PA, various fasnacht masks/collectibles, various ammo, full suite of scrap junk. When I'm not overrun with surplus scrip legendaries or consumables to dump my character is about 140 lbs and stash about 675.
---
Get rid of junk you never use and easy to get (cloth wood steel etc). Keep all others 100 or less, that is plenty for most. Double check the stash doesn't have unscrapped junk. 
---
Don't have any more gunpowder than you need
---
No mininukes, missiles or 40mm grenades. NO LOOSE PA PIECES! 
---
Don't hored legendaries unless under 1lb. I never have/need more than 2 days worth of scrippables in my stash.
---
The point of a build isn't about how long it takes for u to make it, it's what u get out of it, so ur approach makes no sense whatsoever. And u don't gotta be a prick abt it cus I'm not "whining" just throwing out a suggestion for the community. It's called quality of life, something this game needs, look it up.
---
With a distinct lack of therapy available in the Wasteland, the merciful thing is to put a bullet in his head. And then loot him.
---
well that's a shame, thought he'd walk around the coop like the brahmin does.
---
More advice: If you are public team leader then make sure to be changing your team's focus appropriately! Building for most things is great, but flipping the team's focus to events near the end of the event nets you significantly more exp than keeping it in building. Also, do not sleep on the hunting team focus! I've been partying up with my friends and when we were hunting for collosus spawns we fought a legendary deathclaw spawn, flipped over to hunting team and killed it and we netted 4k exp from the kill. That's absolutely insane exp.
---
Srry if it confused u but I mean that we would get our old perk point back by ranking it down. Would that be kinda busted? Just want some feedback
---
I'm hoping to see perk load outs soon. Can't even guess at the number of times I've rushed to an event to do battle with ammosmith and super duper on...
---
255 according to angry turtle's studies.
---
Im a level 252 and i never tried to play it once because i heard there was a possibility you could lose your main weapon if you got killed. So i wanted to wait until i heard they fixed that glitch. I see the event start from time to time but i never see more than one or two people at them when i play. I guess i should try it out next time and hope for the best!
---
Hahah I feel that one mate
---
I understand y they did it cuz come on how is a guy in a women's bathing suit and giant mascot head stealthy but they should make the outfits limited to the stealth related outfits like the gilli suit or silver shroud outfit or even the garb of mystery (skin only not buffs)
---
I had hoped so too, there is chickens in  the coop, they just dont free range
---
Some of them are pretty rare and I understand selling them for a bit more but not all of them
---
Don't forget about changing to hunting team when appropriate. It's sleeper OP if your team runs across a high level legendary spawn out on the map.
---
Haha, you're right. As if all of 2020 wasn't already enough. Does massive doses of radiation kill viruses and stop certain communities from voting? Asking for a friend...
---
Got it and love it sooo much XD
---
How much weight did u actually save with that mod over the 120lb carry one?
---
Since none of the prefabs are made to the standard size of foundation pieces, people would just complain about the side they aligned the snapping to. Doesn't matter which way Bethesda decided to do it, people would complain that they don't snap the other way.
---
Thank you for your insight! It’s interesting. I think for me personally I don’t like the fallout 76 gameplay I find it a chore and so I literally would be grinding. I have to decide whether to invest my free time in more ‘work’ so to speak. But hey I might turn out to enjoy workshops and and public events too? I guess I’ll have to hop on after work and see how I go. 
---
I totally get what you’re saying though. I love the feeling of accomplishment and I totally get it it’s kind of why I enjoy building so much. I’ll go collect all my resources and make an awesome camp and I’ll love it for a few days but then I’ll tear it down and move to do it all again 
---
Ah yes the global pandemic haha It’s actually got me working more because we’re so stretched thin at work.
---
Yea eventually u would have that but this might help for some mid game folks who don't got a lot of points
---
&gt;  during that time
---
What time? It literally takes less than 30 seconds to do. And if your public 'teammates' aren't playing as a team then they weren't your teammates to begin with, so screw 'em. Besides, you can even do this strat without being public team leader. As long as you're bonded to a team you don't lose that team bond unless you leave the server. That means you can jump between teams all willy-nilly and not be penalized as long as you've already sat in one or two of them long enough for a bond. So you can hop from a building team for your constant exp and then hop over to an events team and get more exp, then hop back to your building team.
---
And if you die with unyielding and join a friend before respawning or just change server you can actually double the unyielding bonus.
---
Yup, i run a bloody melee and these poop demons are the worst.   Everytime i miss one a get 1 shotted, i respawn, wipe the blood from my face and growl "round 2 M'fer"
---
Vampire , fast swing weapon ( combat knife is the best) with vanguard armor . As long as you can hit something , you’ll be unlikable
---
when shes still  suckin after you nut
---
Np. And use super duper when smelting. Youll have 100 plus copper after hitting these two places.
---
Yeah I was thinking over time or if you manage to grind enough score new challenges will open and for each one completed you’ll be rewarded a “ticket piece” and depending on the rarity/tier of the item you want it’ll cost 1 or more ticket pieces or a “whole ticket” which is formed by joining an x amount of ticket pieces so you could get more rewards that you want with hopefully less time if you’re unable to spare it.
---
What is a donkey punch?
---
Well according to this community and every angry American and English man on gamechat when doing the event, yes, it does
---
Ah so it’s account wide progression?! This is a good idea!
---
Just wait until OP learns you can craft tens in these in only a few seconds later on, that are overcharged.
---
Do you have a junkie rifle build you can reference?
---
I don't have the blue line over my name tho. Or is it not supposed to?
---
Yeah i have instigating explosive combat shotgun. Its awesome. I dont even need perks in vats.
---
It's a common drop from Campfire tales
---
I doubt many people have a copy lying around due to how common it is
---
Now if we were allowed only ONE character I could totally understand your point.
---
I was not trying to be a prick, but it did come off as
---
whining.
---
\*fast travel behind you\* Nothing personal kid
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
Yes. Would recommend only claiming rewards as your main character. Lunchboxes, Bullion, Scrap Kits, Repair Kits, Caps, Perk Packs all go the the character that claims the reward.
---
The ONLY way to see where you are is at the end of a match, and even then it’s just an estimation. 
---
Just wait until you blue screen and don’t get any XP after spending a half hour in one match, it’s the most fallout thing ever.
---
I can spare one. IGN Mad_alenas
---
This took a dark turn. 
---
I like it.
---
Sweet, thanks again! You guys are awesome!
---
But...besides the excavator, the PA isn't designed to carry excessive weight...they were designed for combat, so a backpack mod would kinda not fit the mold of the PA. That mod would be considered a QoL item....this mod is a horrible idea
---
If he kept hitting you or shooting you on purpose nah I do it too if people won’t leave me alone it’s self defense.
---
I’ve just got that raider tree. You won’t be disappointed. 
---
PS It’s a lot bigger than I imagined it would be and also on the plus side, it uses next to no budget at all :-)
---
I agree I think anything that Bethesda can add to keep us invested is a good idea. There’s just a fine line between fun and meaningful progression and grindy 
---
I don’t think i’d have such an issue if the events and dailies had an overhaul. I think the social teams is a good first step!
---

---
I was playing a match earlier and I'm crouched, Ghillie suited, in a bush and some random guy also Ghille'd up runs into the bush with me and crouches right in front of me.
---
And we just stare at each other, obviously seeing each other.  I had a gun on me, not out, but could have easily shot him point blank. As much as a suck at PVP, even I couldn't miss that. We both twitched a little, adjusting slightly as we are making sure we're as deep in the bush (phrasing) as possible.  After about two minutes I turn the fire is moving in so I whip out the pistol and shoot a ghoul that was wandering too close and sprint off to the next safe zone.  I just couldn't shoot a fellow bush wookie.
---
Chances of these cunts being on our servers are minimal. ;)
---
So?
---
I know a good ptsd therapist
---
Yeah there is its called chameleon mutation
---
I know i was testing out a unyeilding armor
---
I think if you find a sufficiently bushy bush, that the target recognition doesn't work.  But if you have a limb partially out that yeah paints the crosshairs red.
---
This 100%. Netted 10k exp from changing the team to hunting team, then events team afterwards. Holy moly the exp was mind blowing.
---
Nothing they said was ‘being a prick’. 
---
Someone disagreeing with you doesn’t make them ‘a prick’.
---
I.. want.. it.. ALL!
---
Err I mean, hanging tree, fireplace, and chicken coup are my top 3.
---
Point taken, but that is the description of an effect. There is no explosive effect that does extra damage without causing area damage (for example).
---
Movement speed and harder to detect are two separate effects which are available independently, albeit with slightly different parameters (fixer version being better). The way I see it, it has the equalivalant of 2 extra minors (and one isn't even normally found on weapons)
---
Lemme guess kept moving?
---
Got one when i first fought the sbq
---
At the point he started calling you names I would have taken his loot and nuked his base.
---
I dont know how to respond to that
---
Now’s the perfect time. They’ve made social interaction easy even for me, who generally hates that sort of thing.
---
No problem I hate when people do that too and I understand accidents but if you can see them hitting you over and over then it’s on them.
---
"You have contracted rad worms" and ah yes charred feral ghouls the bane of my fucking existence for the longest time
---
I swear they make them stronger for radiation rumble and guided meditation! Anywhere else I shred them!
---
I wasn't trying to whine just trying to thro out a suggestion. I know we r gonna get perk loadouts soon so that would probably make this suggestion invalid. But I have no problem grinding levels to change a build. I kinda like seeing it come together. This was just a thought that ran thru my head. Srey for being a jerk in my last few replies it was uncalled for
---
He's in the animal crossing sub
---
Sexy hand?
---
sometimes it helps but if you add stairs doesn't work.
---
The legendary run is like a battle pass so you unlock 100 different tiers with different rewards, it’s all on the Bethesda.net website
---
You weren’t a prick. And OP was definitely whining.
---
Probably would do the same
---
Yeah 2 foundations and 1 stairs now all of the peices are stuck
---
Luchboxes!!
---
I’m on Xbox one and the official Fallout website said that buying ranks would be available on the 14th, yet the option is still greyed out 3 days later. Is there a solution yet?
---
lol!
---
You need to have at least one piece of armor with the legendary perk "Reduces damage while blocking by 15%". For some reason it has a reaction with shotguns, it's very weird. There's videos on YouTube of "Magic" legendary effects that just push weapons to cause insane damage for no reason. Almost how you can get "Magic" queen killing weapons like a Stalkers minigun with an accelerated barrel. As long as it has over 200 fire rate on non shotguns and one of the "Magic" effects it will melt her, like it doesn't compute damage reduction correctly. I can go to a scorchbeast queen solo and melt her with said minigun, it says I'm doing 2 to 6 damage per bullet, but her health bar says otherwise.
---
What’s the go-to mods I should get for it?
---
Don't bother repairing the pipes in the radiated area. Once you go through the decon shower turn left and you'll find a locked door that you can pick. Once through that there's a terminal to hack which allows you to progress to the next area. Saves a lot of time.
---
\#2 and #22 are the best, i think. I thought about doing something like this too; a show and tell with my album. But flipping through it, most of the pictures are of strange bugs or crude humor.
---
[This](https://i.imgur.com/Vi9Zmhy.png) is probably my favorite picture that I've taken since Wastelanders
---
I love these!! Can I use one as my background? :)
---
Massive, Huge, Gigantic map to explore with all the fantastic sites and sights Fallout games deliver. It's worth the price just for that alone. That's what we're paying for. Ignore all the moaning and complaining.
---
This. A Fallout world where you can do whatever you want.
---
Play alone, play with friends, play with random people you've never met.
---
I don’t typically hide in a bush, knock out rewards quickly sometimes but that’s good to know. If I can’t get my brother and niece and nephew to play and then I go solo but that’s not very often
---
Perk Cards and the Guille paints.
---
5 violett flux
---
Fundamentally impossible....they must be unequipped, as the inside of the PA wasnt made to accommodate armor, let alone a backpack
---
Hunting team is actually insane, it just requires more finesse to work with since you need to be changing your team goal on the fly for it. But the pay out in exp is very, very, very much worth the effort. No joke. Hitting the 4k exp caps on legendary sheepsquatch and deathclaws thanks to it.
---
Yes and no. He he was bugged in someone's camp, so he was stationary and passive, but he was doing the typical looking around and twitching. I took shots of different angles with different filters until i was happy.
---
Maybe if they rework workshops the power plant event could be more fun.  
---
Lets say public event for power plant then each workshop acts as a tower defence local event.
---
Survive as many workshop waves as you can.
---
I know two people with legacys attacked me but they couldnt handle a gauss minigun i posted it
---
Imaging if you stumbled upon the real codes?
---
Make 76 IRL
---
Don't worry about it Bethesda already taken care of it. Those 10 fusion cores will be used up in the course of one scorched beast queen run or a couple decent fire fights. Unless you use the "power user" perk. Every Saturday I farm at least 20 fully charged fusion core and even though I only play for a couple hours on Saturday &amp; Sunday and maybe 1 hour a day during weekdays I'm still down to my last 4 cores by the next Saturday. That's with me picking up the partially used cores scattered around the map as I play.
---
Man, puts my dozen scorchbeast groin shots to shame
---
A player had a level 50 one for sale for 250 caps.    
---
I snagged it last night b/c I had the one from the quest which is max 30 I think. It was only doing 86 will all the Rifleman perks maxed.
---
If u can get it, tasty squirrel stew is same as cranberry relish, but fir carnies
---
I got to 49 and then just bought to 97.
---
Tbh, I have had nothing interest me on the atom shop for months now and between work and home renovations I just haven't had the time that is required to invest in it. 
---
Think it was a double edged sword if I'm being totally honest. On one hand I was relieved to juat have it done, but now that it is done I realised that all I was doing in this game was getting things for the sake of getting things. 
---
Looking forward to taking a break and getting back to life 😊
---
As a follow up:
---
I realized I couldn't even MAKE ultracite .308 as I bought the gun and didn't have the recipe. So I got LMG plans, downgraded the receiver and promptly went to a Nuke zone and helped take down a Scorchbeast Queen.
---
Even with a standard receiver, Furious LMG tears SHIT UP!
---
Plus it's 90% lower weight, so there's no reason for me not to carry it around.
---
I'm going to be working towards bringing it back up to Prime level again, but that's down the line.
---
True but I'll probably slap an Automatic receiver on it
---
Ok this time it worked but at the cost of my knuckles.
---
I hid in a bush and filedmy taxes. I consider that afk.
---
Do the "Load Bearing" Event and collect all the copper ore inside the mine. Should be about 30-40 per run. And there is a green footlocker around each of the robots withe a bit of extra scrap.
---
You just need some acid to melt down the copper ore.
---
At least it solved my plasma caster ammo shortage ;-)
---
With the right perk load out you can get up to 3.75x multiplier while sneaking
---
Thank you :) yes
---
Alright will give it a go, thank you 😉
---
My 2nd character is a Stealth/Sniper.    
---
A level 50 Fixer, Two Shot Combat Rifle, and the Brotherhood Recon Rifle. I don't remember the effects on them but they all do at least 116 damage per shot or more.
---
Really? Do you use a gatling laser? Because I'm amazed power armour alone would do that.
---
And to find good vendors
---
But with sneak multiplier its 341
---
Since I added Aquaboy, absolutely.
---
I was down to last 4, against a team of three, down in a tiny circle that included a deep enough section of river to swim in.  I was swimming zig zag for a good 30 seconds before the finally got me just riddling the water with bullets. They had to have gone through a half dozen grenades too.
---
I understand if you like to challenge yourself with weapons that require precision but you should try an explosive build if you haven't. Have you ever tried an explosive build with the cards I listed? It's really fun.
---
There are only a handful.   I’m using primed receiver and aligned sniper barrel,
---
Is there Vault 51 door in adventure mode? Never found it. Where is it? o\_O
---
How do you use cosmetic stuff in NW?    
---
My main char is always  in the t-shirt/jeans I have as her base layer.
---
Thanks so much!
---
Did you stack bar counters? How?
---
I saw a guy who got perma banned on Wednesday get it changed to a temporary suspension.
---
It’s that limb damage, Works magic
---
Are you sure its not Maxwell?
---
The first glow in the dark wallpaper. Just got the plushie. Also looking forward to the hanging bug lamp, chicken coop, and fireplace
---
3*'s never were 3* all the time...
---
I just love my new plushi friend. Hes almost like the dog they refuse to give me XD
---
Have one sitting by the fireplace and one next to my bed

There really awesome I want to put some of mine up but idk how to.
---
There's a perfect little spot at mama Dulces where the water is covered with leaves. You can hide there but I feel like people are catching on and just hitting it. However I have won games swimming and doing nothing at all
---
We had like 10 people we gotterdun
---
Maybe i just havent seen it
---
New River Gorge Bridge usually has a good amount at the large truck wreckage towards the middle.
---
There's a bunch of bags on top of the monorail elevator... There's another couple in Hawks Refuge

You can get Foundation reputation from other sources than Ward. 
---
Choose to take pictures of Crater during **Photo Opportunity** and donate them for free to Ward.  (+75)
---
Donate the reward from **Vital Equipment** instead of taking the caps (+50)
---
During **Retirement Plan**, tell the Raider to go to Foundation. (+25)
---
That’s an extra 125-150 Foundation rep daily added to the 200 you get for standard completion of **Vital Equipment**.

Oh ok
---
Nope just PA. The game eats through them pretty quick especially if you're taking alot of damage(which kinda makes sense) but still I've gone into a nuke zone with 20 fusion cores spent only 15 minutes there and walked out down 5-6 cores. Thats why I never leave home with less than 6-10 cores. I'd hate to get caught in a major fight and run out of juice.
---
6/10. It's good, could be much better
---
Yeah on PC. Also this isn't 611 photos it's just some random photos from a 611 day time span.
---
Hey we all love this game and have expectations...many that haven’t been met. I apologize too if I came off as a jerk.
---
Added. Could you travel to me?
---
Glad you got it sorted out. Be safe out there
---
If you buy something you’re expecting to use it, why should they give you atoms back because you ‘changed your mind’
---
Sure. Where's your camp?
---
Ok thanks for ur help!
---
The MG-42 used 7.92×57mm Mauser rounds in WW2 but it's still in 76 so it's not completely impossible
---
Edit: Just checked and apparently .308 rounds were interchangeable
---
Monorail elevator and bog town, u should YouTube them. There is a pretty good guide with a few other locations and u walk away with like 100
---
Not sure what that accomplishes? I mean you will probably be dead in 20 minutes  tops. And that is only if you are very very lucky.  If you don't  keep moving to keep your character out of the storm, you'll more likely be dead in 2-5 minutes.  And that is only if another player doesn't kill you.  Then what? How can you get back into the match if you are afk?
---
better none of them to get her ass land faster. anyway i ve nuked prime 8 time for past 2 days leaving delta safe and only once she died in the air bcz of being staggered the whole time.
---
Nah, early help is fun. I was way in over my head when I was trying to capture a base 60 levels ago (lvl 75 now). Didn't have enough fire power to kill all the gouls trying to get to the roof I was standing on. A lvl 100 something came flying in, killed everything, dropped some stims and other loot and flew out. 
---
Saved by a bunny hopping, bloodied wielding, jetpack wearing maniac in power armor.
---
Bethesda needs to fix an issue with NW where after every game every team is disbanded before friends forget to be friends. The most annoying feature of this update.
---
hmmph yeah that too. i did go into the settings one time to lower it when i was up late one night and didnt want random ppls voices coming from the tv, lol. oops.....
---
Uncle Sam emote. So I can point directly at something.
---
Durn. Fun stuff fo show thi
---
Well you see when a man SAYS he loves a women...
---
Thanks, I was lucky and it was just me and my friends and one rando, we all took turns luring it to each other for pictures
---
I was lucky one time now that I think about it if you can get the stairs below( top part on the foundation) you can normally remove the upper stairs and then the lower and it can unlock the foundations. Could also help to change stairs if you have other skins. I know my nuka ones lock a lot of foundations so I swap to RR normal or metal. Not sure about the double wide vault ones as I don't own them.
---
I'll sometimes do that when capturing workshops for any score challenges since I Believe the defense events get extra XP. That being said I usually teleport if I see other folks doing public events.
---
In the 3 characters I do have plus my first one during the Beta which was all messed up it never hit. Explosives are in Explosive boxes and laying around    
---
If you're trying to get more you'd have to hunt or craft them.
---
I wish we could just get the Vault 51 items for CAMPS. So much stuff in there that is nowhere else. Like stoves that turn on
---
I prefer alchohol (brock beer), buff, psycho (psychotat), overdrive, and mentats.
---
Best part is, when u use them for combat, u lose the negatives
---
I was very surprised by that and very happy also.
---
Welp, I guess this is a lost cause. Bless your heart.
---
i'm sure i wouldn't have the budget for it anyway, but thanks for the info :)
---
Got it, unfortunately too late 😂
---
Automatic ones are always lower and without significant recoil reduction you'll have to shoot in burst or burn a lot of ammo.
---
"or craft them."
---
How do you craft stuff in Nuclear Winter?
---
Kanawha cemetery too. 5 or so bags in the shed
---
old email, wanted my 76 to be attached to my other email, my new email
---
I'll be there as soon as I can. Got booted.
---
are British levels different? like, metrics?
---
Yes please make these separate weapon and not just weapon skins. I would love it!
---
Good idea. It would make it more worthwhile to join the defend event if massive waves of enemies came at you.
---
Also, the “are you gonna shoot me now” at the end of the event is priceless.
---
You get the plans to make them as a rare drop from encrypted event and after you learn the plan you have a chance to get one at legendary vendor
---
Massive con is the spawns being bugged.  I once spent over 30 minutes as it was doing a defence because I refused to give up until I found them all and in the end I had to give up anyways as the very last liberator was in a place I could not get too.  I even desperately tried throwing grenades against the wall with the improved radius perk equipped to no avail.
---
I don't understand, why was he a duper?
---
That's weird. And kinda sucks.
---
Yeh we measure thing in british levels which are 1.6x smaller then American levels so its gotta be said
---
With the new seasons patch and allowing public teams it makes the game alot more fun for me personally. It also helps those who are new to the game. 
---
This weekend is a good weekend to begin with Double XP going. Not sure how the PC community is as I am on PS4. But you do hear about how this community is very helpful to those just beginning. 
---
Jump in and give it a shot. Don't think you will regret.
---
true, well at the moment you can take peoples workshops during the defence.
---
So my friend just made an account and cant comment yet. So i will comment for him. He Would love to see some mods for the garand. Not much, but he would like to see the quick mag, no extension mags, and I would love to see the hardened, and hair trigger receivers make an apearance on this gun. Legendaries would be cool. But he would love to see them be un-scrappable like the fixer. Legendaries would be nice. But i would like to see them put a twist on this. I also think that the lowest level for it should be lvl 1 and do 40 dmg and the lvl 50 should do a minimum of 75 damage.
---
It's all good ik there's a lot of ppl out there who don't like the game at all so we got our love for it in common and ik ur weren't trying to be mean or anything so all is forgiven
---
I actually have tried a few builds the sniper load out, the camp in a pond and hope I don’t get spotted build, the grenade spam, the Tesla spam, and a “pa” build but rn I’m having a blast just using automatic/heavy build... haven’t tried a melee or a shotgun build yet(both seem like hell but with a stealth boi probs op)
---
What does Bethesda do that you think they get right, or really enjoy.
---
But also would lime to see non legendaries get a sort of keepsake status so you cant scrap them.
---
The mounted heads dropped like water, that’s not a sign of a super. I farmed the mole miner treasure seeker heavily and had multiple of each mounted head
---
Great work. Can tell a lot of time went into this. I find myself spending a good hour or two just looking for that perfect locale 😂.
---
You're not a bad person, you just need some kind of reaction from random people on the internet. Positive or negative, it doesn't matter.
---
Or why even go thru the decontamination shower?
---
+karma
---
Having 20 of each mounted thing isn't a sign of duping. Someone who put a lot of time into the game can amass that amount legitimately. There's no point in duping those since they aren't rare or valuable. You might not be a bad person, but you did something bad to a possibly innocent person
---
yeah it's so annoying. It mostly happens and the nuclear plants, they just need to tighten those spawns.
---
I also notices the nuclear plants have their own enemies which confuse the AI during the defence so maybe remove the scorched from the plants.
---
This happens to me every.single.time. I usually just hang out and let everyone else collect, then finish the event with them.
---
Everytime someone says too I am transported to 20001
---
How have you raised your damage ?
---
Or... Get the courage and start your own Team.
---
He had 18 tattered Field jackets 
---
And 9+ bloodied flamers 2* with same attributes.
---
It helps if I further the context
---
That works too if there isn’t an existing one.
---
I just logged out of the game and then loaded back in and all the other challenges were there and  completed. I missed out on some SCORE, o well.
---
That's what I did. I was afraid he would do bad things to my camp.
---
Really interesting angles and lighting that bring a new perspective! Love the work
---
Even if there is. Control your own destiny.
---
Hahah wish we actually had a karma system but not sure how you'd do that on an MMO
---
I was actually thinking that just yesterday at poseidon how irritating it was trying to find the scorched I need to kill while killing scorched I didn’t need to kill.
---
Also settler random encounters
---
That makes a lot of sense. I play league of legends and I was finding that I would spent a majority of my time grinding for prestige skins for champions that I wouldn’t even play. 
---
And there’s so many games with these battle pass systems that require us to invest so much time. It’s literally impossible to grind multiple battle pass systems so we have to make the call on if it’s worth it or if we get any value out of investing our precious time.
---
Had to double take;
---
thought it said "I hate those fat ugly human people" for some reason
---
A complete moron is in charge of the real nukes. Trust me, you’re not the one they’re worried about.
---
Ooops! I’m so used to being on the market sub haha! Either way +karma!!! Haha
---
You have to do about 1000 damage to the queen to get loot from her. Just tagging isn't enough.
---
It works with stairs too. It's the best way I've found to remove problem stairs/foundations.
---
My bases are usually unattached to the ground, so I always have issues with anything I add that is. I've tried every work around to keep from as scrapping my base for the 100th time.
---
I'm still not sure how the glitch works for the scorch spawns it works but I went up 6 levels (254-260) doing Line in the Sand today. I was getting close to 10k exp per horde spawn and there was ALOT of spawns. I had a full builder team, Well rested, 100% from lunchboxes, +8 Int from SB brains, 10% from Canned meat stew, and +5 int from those mentats. It was amazing. Those 6 levels I got in 10 minutes
---
I took a picture of the  blocks that spell out drugs at the winding path. It's a good memory lol.
---
How? I've heard that making and scrapping gatling Lasers gives Cores but it didn't work when I tried...
---
I didn't know that. But  I'm  like nonstop doing damage to her and it makes no difference. Nonstop loads when i try to loot her
---
You also get XP when team mates complete certain quests. It’s not a lot, but it’s another benefit!
---
You can also fast travel to a team mate (sometimes getting you to an event for free). So far I haven’t found a downside.
---
They probably have a small team as others have mentioned because the game didn’t fare well at launch and would have fallen short of projected revenue targets as a result.
---
This was heavily exacerbated by the amount of misinformation and toxicity various youtubers and overly vocal players spread early on which was designed to warn people away from the game.
---
There was just such a tremendous amount of hate and memeing that went on driven by cancel culture in order to stick it to Bethesda.
---
This definitely affected their revenue and in turn the amount of resource available to pump back in the game.
---
It’s a self fulfilling prophecy.
---
Zax Protection, collects soiled and bloodied Vault 51 vaultsuits, bones and blood packs!
---
To ask the obvious:
---
What if those weapons were duped back when ?   
---
I also highly doubt anyone in support has the access or knowledge to look into technical stuff and databases.
---
Sweet I went up like 3 levels at radiation rumble. I'll definitely try. Me and a bud are gonna nuke whitesprings on his private and server hop on it over nd over again lol
---
I really just want guns that make sense. The shotgun compensator is upside down! The mag capacities are ridiculous the ammo calibers.... you know what, never mind. M1 and M1911 would be cool.
---
OML hahaha I feel that one mate
---
Member.
---
It's a trade off. Benefits Vs Looks. My less favourite sister knows all about it.
---
The city of Watoga isn't a real place, but it wasn't established until later, so we still have a few years before we have to tear down the forest and build a city there.
---
OH so you think ALL Wookies are warriors? That's offensive.
---
If they were duped I would of been suspend or banned already since I had them through all of the previous ban/suspension waves.
---
'Testing' - you mean implementing and experiencing bug after bug after hot fix after bug?
---
Worth noting that you sometimes want several copies of a card, at different levels.
---
I have a lv3 demo expert for my gauss shotgun build, and a lv5 demo expert for when I want to craft things, or just derp with 40mm
---
Yeah and the constantly respawn. Why did they stick so many scorched right beside the workshop?
---
You showed him alright!
---
Isn't there an option in settings?
---
8 bags behind the main building at Charlie
---
Between Fallout and Hitman searches, I’ve gotta have a moderately sized dossier somewhere
---
Hey, what did guy kil you with? Legacy, kinetic, melee.?
---
I always join or start a Bulding group then share Inspirational level 3 with everyone.
---
Enjoy!!
---
It took A LONG time for me to get mine to at least half-decent...and even then, it’s not perfect. I got separate concrete foundation blocks riiiiight up against the building. But naturally the spacing doesn’t work for both the front opening and the side door.
---
Eventually, I was like, this is as good as it’s gonna get.
---
Better to fill an existing team first. You get more Intelligence/XP with more people on the team.
---
Thank you!!! 💗
---
It's not the amount of resources available, it's the willingness to put resources in. Other than that, yup, it's true.
---
Ate you a duper? Lol.  Jk.
---
Tab right all the way over.
---
The donut counter can stack with each other, well that’s what they say around here, I haven’t try it yet.
---
I may be remembering wrong, but I do know the drop rate was modified very early on to be worse.
---
Yes I understand you can't grind enough to get to level 100. What with work and all
---
But if you just play once a week, you should be able to get all of that days daily and possibly all of the weeklies. That over 9k score. Do that from now until the end and it'll get you over half way there. 
---
It's still a steep price but it'll save you a ton.
---
Who has that much Charisma!
---
Are you a real photographer, it seems like it. These are amazing, honestly. Amazing job.
---
I thi k you need to use the shoty for the back up on The heavy biuld and for my stealth cammando I use a B2525 10mm auto pistol but if you dont like bloodied maybe two shot or furious instead. Sure the damage isn't all that high but the fire rate is insane and such low ap cost makes up for it I think
---
I have 15, haha. I could share a lvl 5 perk card if I wanted but there are not really any good ones.
---
Just got one by myself at around lvl 300 and it was a good fight. Lots of ultracite .308's and grenades though.
---
Should have dropped a pool cue (or two) and had them fight to the death ala The Dark Knight.
---
obviously lol, got 3 explosive gatling plasmas and 1000 deathclaw fashnacht masks
---
The sloth was like level 15 or 20 and only 1 star if I'm remembering correctly. I didn't bother with it at all.  The rewards for completing the event though were max level, got a junkies ffr fixer, beserkers explosive RW handmade and a hunters fss +1str sheepsquatch club, all the rare masks and a shit ton of treasury notes.
---
There's a script on pc that'll click back into another match for you and do nothing during the match. You can leave it running for a day or so and be at level 100
---
Just allow the backpack to work in PA. I get why armor doesn't, but where the hell does the backpack go when you get in?
---
Some of these are absolutely fantastic!
---
It makes me wonder what the game is trying to do there, supposedly melee attacks in this game are literally just a bullet with a range consisting of a single point. Does it just not move your hitbox when you jump 10 feet into the air, or...?
---
Ever looked under the energy ammo in the chem bench?
---
Yup, days wasted and no reply. Just a generic copy paste on twitter too
---
My medic has 15, he finally gets to be used more with public teams
---
My fave is the Atoms. It's the only thing I want from the board.
---
Yes, but seems like Cores cost a lotta Flux.
---
This^^
---
But to be serious I would save your caps and get to friendly with the settlers so you can roll your own gauntlet weapons but if you find a good deathclaw or mole miner gauntlet use thoose
---
Auto recievers reduce vats cost by a massive 50%. Also the zero vats bug was sadly fixed but you can still get a tiny vats cost with the right attachments
---
a lot of players do this thing without showing off.
---
It’s so bs. And literally most People don’t bash Bethesda for this.
---
If you grind out those 100 score for 10000 exp challanges then maybe. Someone did the math and even with doing every daily and weekly you still would not have enough to finish. Something like 5000 score short. So doing the 100 score challenge is a must. They didn't include the extra challenges we have been getting or the double score weekend coming up though. If you can reach level 90 without spending any atoms you could use the atoms gained from the battle pass to progress to level 100.
---
It's getting tight. You'd have to do every daily/weekly challenge from now until the end and really grind this weekend and double score event. I think you'd have to be at level 40 right now to just keep up.
---
But don't worry about things like hitting 100. Give it your best go to get as much as you can possibly get! If you feel it's getting tight you can purchase the remaining levels with atoms you've earned through playing. (When they allow purchasing).
---
Unfortunately it still doesn't cut it. I can loot all the ore with minimal rads in a hazmat suit. With PA, I have to hit the rad scrubber after I've barely finished a tunnel.
---
Oh that makes more sense.
---
Voice chat?
---
this late in is doable, but you will need to max your xp buffs and farm like crazy
---
Their customer service is atrocious. But I’m not surprised they aren’t great at it since they also aren’t great at with the endless glitches/bugs/unfinished content in the games 😂
---
Maybe don’t run around at 20% health and then bitch about getting 1shot
---
This is also my advice, join a team first. If none available then start a new one.
---
The most likely reason is probably your build not being optimised. When I started I ran a shotgunner build and still managed to loot the queen.  Maybe join a team and hope one of them does enough for you to be able to loot her.
---
I managed 21 levels in a day and a half so I don’t see why not especially with double xp this weekend and double SCORE coming soon
---
Plus you can top up with atoms
---
If you're going to buy it just wait until the end.
---
Some challenges like join a team, build this and that could save you a few dollars in the upcoming weeks.
---
At the end if you still want the rest and don't mind the price, buy it.
---
Multiple radios fill my camp with music
---
The building with the hole in the side of it in the Abandoned Bog Town has more than 10 bags of concrete in it. That’s my go to place whenever I need concrete.
---
Maybe it's just me but why are you guys hoarding so much? Doesnt seem fun wearing poop armor and doing poop damage bc you wanna carry a million pounds of garbage 🤣.
---
Thanks for your help, I’ll give it my best shot
---
I got permabanned two days ago and I don’t know what to do to appeal to have my account reactivated, I responded to the email and they haven’t gotten back to me, nor have they gotten back to me about the 8 months I have left on my year of fallout first I already paid for
---
You can still do it. Especially with double xo this weekend and double SCORE weekend coming up
---
You're not allowed to use ANY armor paints in NW and it's intended to be that way.  You need to be able to see and quickly identify what armor your opponents are using in NW so you have an idea of how much damage you're going to be able to do and how much of a threat they might be.  This is why apparel doesn't cover up armor in NW and equipping anything strips you down to your underarmor.
---
Wouldn't this be exploited really bad? This basically means that if I had 1500 atoms, I could potentially just buy and experience everything then return it. 
---
They do refunds for accidental purchases but to just return an item you've had for weeks for a full refund? 
---
I have my fair share of items that I wish i could return, but I bought them on purpose and it's usually a few weeks until I regret it. But what can you do?
---
The x-01 power armor is good 
---
Another trick I use is rename the armor to “AAA + slot name”  so like “AAA left arm” 
---
Sort it by alphabetical order and equip it quickly
---
Have they confirmed that you can spend atoms to top up? Not questioning you, I’m just asking
---
Don't bother with any mods but the prime receiver. The fire rate on the OG barrel is great, and has the range of a sniper. The gunner sight is unnecessary if you run stabilized, as the crosshair is tiny.
---
Yeah it started yesterday 
---
150 per level
---
Any advice for doing that? I’m not sure how
---
Exactly... at *least* free scrip or a reason to not have to repair, then scrip the almost unusable one.
---
Need to put what system you play on so that people know if they can help you.
---
Love this♡
---
Alright, Thanks for your help
---
Yeah, you could at least get to the ammo converter.
---
